From the outside, the restaurant looks really nice with a nice awning and patio area.  So much so that we were afraid we were underdressed for the occasion.  Turns out the inside is very simple with wooden tables and chairs and red-white-blue decorations, which was fine since it was more the dining experience we were dressed for, thought it did come as a shock from seeing the outside.  There were three other tables already there when we arrived, but was otherwise pretty not-full for a saturday night downtown.  \\nLooking at the menu, it was very clean and simple, not a huge number of choices, which I actually prefer since it cuts down on the thinking time and usually means that they can do those dishes well.\\nGoing through the menu, there were some pretty interesting choices, such as \\"korrito,\\" \\"bulgogi sandwich,\\" etc.  Items that were very representative of their \\"korean-american fusion\\" concept.  \\nFor the appetizer we ordered the \\"roasted mackerel,\\" which turned out to be more of a sampler than just fried fish.  There was of course the mackerel, but also something similar to the traditional seafood pancake served at most korean restaurants, but with tofu, as well as some peppers stuffed with mung bean and green bean \\"hummus.\\" The only problem was that it took at least 20-30 minutes to arrive, which wasn't helped by the fact that we were starving.  Not sure what took so long to get the food out since out of the other 3 tables there, 2 of them were pretty much done with their meals by the time we arrived.  Perhaps the appetizer, which was not described adequately at all on the menu, had too many components?  The taste was pretty good, or maybe we were just really hungry, but we quickly cleaned that up and waited for our next dish.  \\nI ordered the \\"monk salad\\" and my friend ordered the \\"bulgogi.\\"  The food finally arrived 15-20 minutes later and we were a little surprised on the size of the portions.  We expected them to be larger, but they were definitely enough to fill us up (probably because of the rice).  The monk salad turned out to be pretty similar to traditional bibimbap and was pretty delicious, with a couple of pieces of fried tofu, corn salsa, lettus, soybeans, rice, and of course the korean spicy sauce.  The bulgogi was pretty sub-par, definitely not done as well as at other korean restaurants around town.  The mean was not sliced thinly enough and definitely was not as tender.  Tastewise it was marinated well, but was a little dry and chewy.  \\nOverall, the food was decent.  The service was incredibly slow.

But what was unacceptable is that when I finished the shashu, I bit into the egg and the middle was cold. Not cool, COLD. But, it was partially set. An egg sets between 130 and 140 degrees. This had clearly been soft poached previously and stuck back in a fridge.  they lied right to my face and claimed that the issue is that it is only cooked for 30 seconds and meant to finish warming up in the broth, and that it was the traditional method.  (I lived in japan for 3 years and cook J food at home, I know what is and isn't traditional).   I accept that even the best restaurant will have an off day.

I got a White Sangria and was so happy with the taste, it was not overbearing with alcohol and not watered down with juice, I was impressed! We knew pretty quick what we wanted for out appetizers and entrees and placed the order together. The server timed the meal to perfection, with allowance for us to have our appetizers finished and a little time between the entree coming. I was in shock in how perfect it was timed, because I know it is not easy to do!  \\nI had the P.E.I. Mussels for my appetizer, and OH WOW, the cider sauce was amazing and the bacon was perfect (well really how can you go wrong with bacon?!) and the crostini w/ the mussels was toasted to perfection and so good to dip in the cider sauce. My boyfriend had the Beef Medallion appetizer and the balsamic sauce with that was to DIE for!  This being the opening to our meal set the pace for a great dinner. For my entree I got the 5 oz. Filet w/ Crab Cake and Roasted Veggies. I was craving a decent steak and that is what I got, cooked to a perfect Medium, the Bearnaise sauce was divine and the roasted veggies were perfect! My boyfriend got the Veal Chop and picked it clean, he was thrilled with his meal and we both cleared our plates! The best part about the meal was we were full but did not feel disgustingly bloated full, and had room to bring dessert home! The Molten Chocolate Cake was so good and the Espresso Panna Cotta was seriously flavorful. Another comment I have about this place is the noise level, it was amazingly quiet and you were able to have an actual conversation, I loved it! I hate a place that is so loud that I am unable to hear my dining guests, it was a HUGE plus for me. No loud music and acoustics allowing guests to chat. I cannot wait to come back here again, thank you for such an amazing experience!"},{"name":"Bistro du Midi","address":"272 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Mixed .... the oysters were very fresh and presentation nice enough but on the small side.

If you come on a weekend definitely expect a long wait, especially with a group of 3+... My boyfriend and I came on a Friday evening and waited 45 minutes so we just walked around the plaza. We started out with veggie gyoza which were so tasty!! They really melt in the mouth and are nice to share while you're waiting for your ramen. It was probably 15 minutes of wait time before we got our bowls. I usually get the miso broth here but tried shoyu for the first time. (It was good but I think I'll stick with miso.) The bowl comes with lots of veggies!Their pork is pretty thinly-sliced and not as fatty as other ramen places I've been.

The flavour was great, the meat was tender, and the server gave us two portions of the pickled radish. Was so good that I went back today and ordered the spicy cheese (boneless) chicken.

I am a chef, and my husband works as a manager for a well know theme park in Orlando. Needless to say, we have standards. Upon walking into the resturant, we had to park next door at the matress store, due to insufficient parking. The store owner didn't seem to mind, so that was fine. However, we walked in, and we're met by a horrible stench that smelled like mildew and eggs. It was cluttered with picture frames, tee shirts, and plaques with Bible scriptures. It was cute, but excessive. We were seated in the back of the resturant, which was dirty, and cramped. I felt seating could have been arranged differently, but that is just me. We moved tables, and sat down at a ripped booth seat, and a 20 year old table. There was dust covering the shelf that sat above our table. Our waitress was very kind, our service was awesome, but  when we ordered, we found a couple of things wrong. I ordered coffee, and picked up the sugar shaker, and found a long piece of reddish-gray hair in it. I didn't want coffee any longer. My mother in law went to the restroom to find throw up all over the bathroom stall, on the wall, and on the floor, it had not been cleaned up. The busser cleaning tables had the towel he was cleaning tables with sticking out of his pocket. That is in violation of health code. All towels used MUST be put into a sanitizer that is replaced every 3-4 hours. We received our food. My eggs tasted like water, the grits looked questionable,  my silverware was dirty, the toast looked like Walmart bread. I loved the waffles. My father in law and my husbands grandfather got the chicken livers, and within hours of them both getting home started violently throwing up, and pooping themselfs. We will be contacting the Health Department in the morniing since this is now a case of food poisoning. I will NEVER come back to this resturant ever again. This was someone's dream to open a resturant, and it just isn't working, due to lack of proper management. It is very sad.

I've been to a couple other places in Surrey (Obviously, Vancouver would be better but with what I've had in the area) this is the one to go to. Superb service is everywhere in Surrey but what puts this place apart is the quality of the ingredients. Being from Seattle, not a lot of places have Hamachi, this place doesn't either but they recommended me the most similar palate~feeling fish to hamachi and I was satisfied. I also had it as a to go order, but they filled each order with quality and fullness that I appreciate. The only reason it is a 4, instead of a 5 is because I ordered 2 ame-ebi(sweet shrimp) which were extremely good, but they also put the sweet shrimp heads into my to go box. Usually I'd be happy because it shows how fresh their ingredients are and how 'pre-live' they were before serving. The problem was the 'unfrozen juices' flowing from the heads of the ame-abi (sweet shrimp) that were dripping into my precious other sushi(s) into my into box. Half of them were leaked with a slightly fishy smelling liquid from the heads of the sweet shrimp. Aside from that, Superb, superb choice from local sushi. If you are dining IN, i suggest you ask the owners to deep fry the ame-ebi (sweet shrimp heads) because the intestines (miso) they contain are considered top quality food ingredients. Raw, they are bitter - cooked miso shows an depth bitter quality that is subliminal of fine dining. Only those who know, and have experienced it, will know of the flavors I speak of. The rest of you: I strongly urge you to try it out. Intestines of things we eat doesn't sound appetizing, but honestly that's the flavor concentration points true foodies need to look for, but overlook.

One friend got the fried green tomato app. It was soooooooooooo damn good. Perfectly crunchy on the outside & the shrimp mixture on it was a great touch & flavor profile. Worth every bit of $12. I chose the Berkeley House salad but with the cornflake fried chicken. The chicken was great. The salad needed dressed more. We got to the restaurant probably around 11, and I wouldn't consider much of the menu to be brunch but more lunch.

At first the place was dead, as you would expect, but the restaurant quickly filled up. I was a little bummed that there were no Happy Hour deals but it turned out to be unnecessary because the prices were very reasonable. We picked a handful of rolls, the favorite being the Lobster Crunch. It had nice flavor with an outside crunchy coating of tempura flakes. One roll we got that we wouldn't get again would be the Hawaiian Roll. Although it sounded neat, Coconut shrimp with a mango-ish dipping sauce, it just didn't work. I can't recall the other rolls, so I guess that means there weren't any stand outs. Overall the sushi was fairly fresh, not as high quality as Shari or Amura but it is a very good option for this area. The ordering was a little tough, this is the only sushi restaurant I've been to that doesn't give you that little sheet of paper to mark your sushi rolls. With two giant pages of rolls to choose from it can be tough remembering what you want to order! Service was just ok; it took a little too long for drinks to be filled and food to be brought.

And giant comfy easy chairs.  I could be wrong, but I think this makes them the only place in Downtown Crossing that does, apart from the ones in Borders that are always full.Other most important thing: THEY HAVE BAKED GOODS, which means at last I'll be able to get a decent cookie downtown. (Seriously, there's nowhere.)  They didn't have the full repertoire of baked goods today, since they were doing a soft launch, but I got a slice of coffee cake and it was delicious, fluffy and almondy.  They were also giving away free coffee, hot or iced.  I got iced, and it was excellent.The inside was bright and airy and definitely the kind of place you'd want to spend time hanging out in.  They had a big bunch of yellow flowers on one of the tables.  Lots of bar/countertop seating, plus tables and the aforementioned couches.  There's more seating in the back.  The barristas were really cheerful, too. (\\"We're giving away free coffee to let you know we're awesome!\\")They also do tons of paninis and wraps, as well as soups and quiche.  At least one of them was making the whole place smell delicious when I went in, so I'll definitely be back to try them.  I also want to try the baked muffin tops, which are less than $2.

I've eaten across the spectrum- cheap, quick meals to \\"fancy\\" dress code type places. Sushi Nami combines elements of all these meals. I can wear my jeans, yet still feel as if I am having a nice meal.The food that arrived at my table looked gorgeous- it's obvious the head chef and owner spend a lot of time collaborating and training their chef's to create & present dishes that are visually quite astounding. However, as a Vancouverian, I am used to food that appears beautiful but tastes atrocious.Sushi Nami was anything but. The veggies and fish were fresh, the temperature perfect and the rice to condiment ratio was impressive. It's like this place has got it down to a science. The seaweed is perfect, not too chewy and not paper thin.Despite living in Vancouver all my life, my fondness for fish just isn't there, However, I tried some fish as Nami and loved the fact that it was fresh and didn't have that stale fish taste. Despite all the above reasons my favourite part about this restaurant is their selection of vegetarian rolls- extremely clever combinations that are like a small bite of heaven. Divine. I ordered the rocky mountain roll and couldn't even tell you all the ingredients that made it near perfection. The sauces blended together perfectly. I'm not surprised that a old medalist is coming up with these impressive creations.Not too sure what price issues people mentioned. The general rolls are quite similar to other places... with much much better quality & freshness of food and the special rolls are reasonably priced for just how much stuff you're actually getting. C'mon, let's be real, some places call an avocado and yam tempura roll \\"special\\" and slap an $8 price tag on it. I couldn't tell you everything that was in my special roll because there was a lot going on. I didn't have any issues with service- it wasn't overly friendly or rude. I did appreciate the ice in my water glass ( I have been served many warm glasses of water at other restaurants) and the fact that I was not bothered continuously by over eager servers.I'm still dreaming about this roll, so I will definitely be back soon!"},{"name":"Weather Up","address":"1808 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Great drinks and amazing service - the only drawback was the chef or management.

Definitely a fun, fun atmosphere. The fresh salsa they give you at the start was absolutely amazing - had a bit of a kick to it (and we like / know spicy food), and was incredibly fresh. Tasted like it was just made. The chips were a little thinner than I'm used to, but still pretty good. I had the Chicken Flautas and my husband had the Chicka-Chicka Boom-Boom. His dish was far better than mine. The Chicken Flautas barely had any red sauce on them, were pretty dry (definitely over-fried), and came with only a tablespoon of guac (although it was very good guac). I found myself eating his food more than my own - the sauce on the Chicka-Chicka Boom-Boom was incredible. The dish was soft, warm and delicious.

Do not huffily say \\"I can only carry so much.\\" When you are asked to refill a water glass, go ahead and see if the rest of the folks also need more water and don't make them hunt for you. Try coming by the table to see if anyone wants a second drink. Make sure all parts of a person's entree are ready and bring them together. Don't serve the fajita toppings first, wait five minutes and then serve the sizzling platter, and then wait another few minutes before bringing the tortillas.

The service was poor, original we order 6 dim sum- and the waitress told us 3 of them are no longer available . 2. I also order a steam fish, however the waitress came back to me and told me that they ran out and see if I want Chinese broccoli or some other dish. I said no.

I'd ask beforehand for the number of pieces of corn or potato if you choose either to make sure everyone gets a piece.The Louisiana mild was spicy and garlicky. The noodles soaked up most of the flavoring but the mussels were huge and the shrimp tasty.

I received beef broth, with onions, peppers, carrots, and a very very small amount of ginger placed on top. That was all the ginger in the dish.

Then he had to be asked twice for our drinks which he got wrong.  One of ordered the BBQ plate which comes with Corn Bread and a side.  We asked if we could substitute another side for the corn bread since it was listed as a \\"side\\" on the menu.  Aaron said we could, so we did.  When the meal came there was no corn bread and both of the \\"side\\" we selected.  When the bill came there was a $2 charge for the substitution.  My thinking is, of course we can pay for anything we want on a menu, when you ask if you can substitute something and are told you can, you should either be told there was an additional charge for substitutions or there should be at no charge.  One couple had a Scout Mob and gave it to him with their check (two couples, two checks).  When Aaron returned, he applied the ScotMob to both checks and we had to wait another 15 minutes for him to return with the correction.  As we were leaving the other couple, who recommended we go to Smoke ring said Aaron was really bad last time they were there as well.

Reminded us of wedge fries from Jack in the Box (which we really like) with mildly spicy queso.Oh, Wed is $5 wine night so we had a nice glass of both chardonnay and merlot from the list of $5 wines.Then the movie started and it was even harder to see our food.  Souh of the Border Salad was a good size and the drssing was a nice complement.  The grilled chicken was a little done and slightly charred.  Crispy Chicken Tenders were also generously portioned.  Good BBQ dipping sauce. We did the $3 upgrade to sweet potato fries and they were nice but we might try the regular fries next time. Didn't seem like any of those items were served at optimal temperature. Guess that's what happens when everybody's order goes in at the same time.

When I was taking photos of the place, she looked up at me, smiled, and excitedly asked if I liked the Chinese New Year decorations.  She was like a little kid.  There has to be a male period because I get weirdly sentimental when I witness kindness.  I must have been ragging hard that day because tears of happiness streamed down my cheeks.  I told her I liked it and I meant it.  It looked like I made her day with that simple statement.Sometimes I miss my funny, patient Mom.  I wish she could visit more often but Toichi's manager can be my Boston mom in between Dubai gynecologist Mom's visits.New mom made sure to keep my complimentary mug of tea full while the chef himself came out of the kitchen and took my order.The chef is friendly too. It makes you feel like you're having sushi at a friend's house.  On one occasion, I saw the chef talking to a regular and helping him call a taxi.  Yes, a taxi.  The customer was really old and could barely operate the landline phone.  The word \\"Uber\\" would have probably triggered flashbacks of World War II.The chef helped me out as well, mainly by explaining what was in the rolls I ordered.  It's hard to tell from the photos in the menu, which doesn't have descriptions but is more colorful than full color manga.  I've tried enough rolls to know what the overarching theme is: Richness.Most of the specialty rolls have mayo-based sauces or fried food in them.  I once compared tempura in sushi to having a horse in the house.  It doesn't belong there.However, Toichi's Green Monster roll works because the crab stick is modestly sized.  I hate when the chef thinks the maki is a slutty size queen and jams a whole Japanese spider crab in there.What's the right size?  It's up to you.  It's a matter of personal preference but my test is to look at the cross-section of the roll and see how much of the roll it fills up.  50% to 60% of fried food inside the seaweed is enough.Toichi's chefs also made it fresh for me, so it didn't even taste deep fried and oily.  The miniscule amounts of oil I did taste had no 8-hour-old, reused flavor.  There was a little bit of cucumber in there for freshness, and avocado and roe on top.The Green Monster roll didn't really need the sauce.  The sauces are the chefs' own creations and they're proud of them but they're sauces I could make at home.  On the Green Monster, the sauce is drizzled in a zig-zag pattern so you don't have to mop it up with the roll if you don't want to.But you should definitely use soy sauce.I'm usually more conservative with soy sauce than David Duke is towards black son-in-laws but I highly recommend using it with Toichi's heavier rolls.  I'mma tell you why.Have you ever been to a state fair in Indiana?  I have.  It's like fried food come to life.  Vast people with legs like cheese curds ooze around with corn dogs in their hands.  Sometimes they have their kids with them.  The kids are invariably beautiful and chiseled, so blonde and blue-eyed, it makes Boston white people look like Maori tribesmen.  When getting drunk at a state fair, you're grateful for glimpses of these skinny teenagers to offset the depressing fatness around you.While Toichi's heavier rolls are not depressing, you need something peppy to cut through the fat from the avocado, mayo, and tempura.  Soy sauce and wasabi do the trick, though Toichi's wasabi is not as powerful as wasabi in other restaurants.  You can scoop a good marble-sized blob into your mouth before you feel a kick.You'll need this strategy for the Phoenix roll.It's a much lighter salmon roll with a house sauce on top.  The chef who brought it to me suggested I don't even use soy sauce because the sauce mixed with the caramelization from the torched salmon was enough.  While I agree with him, I did add wasabi.With the mild wasabi coalescing with caramelization and the mayo-based sauce smoothing it out, the Phoenix might be my favorite roll at this place.On my way out, new Mom excitedly offered me some Chinese candy.  I haven't eaten candy for years, but I couldn't refuse.  I took two and she said, \\"You don't want no more??\\"Her eyes told me that she wanted me to fill my pockets and socks.  Smiling and genuinely apologetic, I thanked her and politely refused.  I felt bad for some reason.  I'm a fruit.Keep in mind that most sushi places are quick and efficient, as is Toichi.  They don't need to smile or chat.  The food is the focus of your visit.

They also served a nice little salad to start. I ate about half of the pad Thai and took the rest home, portion was good sized. \\nI have to say some of the best Thai food in Orlando, and great service.

I was pretty overwhelmed with it--but of course in a good way. We had the spicy tuna salad appetizer which wasn't bad--portion was a bit small though. The spicy tuna salad was a mix of tuna and seaweed salad and other sauces combined. For lunch I had the Hakata yakinuku ramen (r6 in the menu) and I thought it was bit below average. The soup was on the saltier side. Also lacked the bamboo shoots which is one of my favorites. Either way, wasn't bad--especially with the frigid temps lately. It'll definitely warm you up. Overall, the ramen wouldn't stop me from visiting here--the service was great. Ii would probably try something else next time since they got tonzzz on the menu to feast on. \\nCheerzzzz and enjoy."},{"name":"JW Marriott Orlando, Grande Lakes","address":"4040 Central Florida Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"JW Marriott Grand Lakes is grand and HUGE AF.

Nonetheless, the outlet shops are not too far away (about 15 minutes.) The hotel's pool area, is very nice and great for people who plan to bring their children or family along to the conference. They have a lazy river! They have a starbucks, gift shop, and a few restaurants on-site. They are very spacious conference spaces at this hotel.The actual hotel rooms are nice Marriott standards. However, our room for some reason did not have a blow dryer. I didn't bother to investigate if it's per request because I ended up borrowing my friend's. As a conference hotel, it's a great option!

You can taste the coconut, but was not too overpowering. It did add a sweetness to the rice. Everything was beyond delicious! I'm so glad we got a chance to check this place out before we left Portland. I highly recommend trying their cocktails especially the mango one.

Good stop for souvenirs if you're trying to buy people stuff from Portland (there's a section in the front with little Oregon themed things), there's a rare book room that you can look into, and pretty easy navigation system if you're looking for a certain book in particular.The only thing that is unfortunate is that sometimes there's a really long line of people trying to buy books, but honestly bookstores are uncommon nowadays and Portland is a rare city that hasn't stopped reading, so it's beautiful.I honestly don't think anyone isn't satisfied with this place, like what is better than spending a few hours pining through new books? There's other locations of Powell's but none are as big as this one. If you're visiting from out of town, it's totally worth paying for parking to take a little stop in here.

It's a great choice for lunch and dinner, but brunch is really where it's at. They have great bloody marys and mimosas, plus your other standard drinks. If you're with a group, definitely go for one of the fishbowls. They are crazy good. The Nook has built a lot of their menu around their totchos (basically nachos made with tots instead of chips), but I am also a big fan of the coca-cola BBQ sauce.I particularly enjoy eating on the porch. They have several bigger TVs, so you don't have to crane your neck to check on the score, and it's a fun community of people.Big downside: little to no parking.

So I may not be the best person to ask about Japanese restaurants. I like mainly Southern, Carribean, Italia and Soul Food, but I have travel to a few countries, so I can give my honest opion about \\"Taste\\". The line of pending customers was so long that about 20 people were standing outside. This was on a Saturday at about 4 pm, so I guess you can expect a crowd. I didn't do the Japaense (Sushi or Sashimi) menu. So I mainly experienced the Steakhouse part of the restaraunt. I did tried my friends Sushi and it was okay. Now it could be that I have become spoiled after frequenting Nakato's in Atlanta. But even the under $10 Hibachi Grill on Tara Blvd can compete with this place. In my opion and it's a buffet style restaurant!The salad came out with one of the best tasting dressings I have ever had. I sooo want that recipe! I think it was a Miso Ginger dressing/sauce but I could be wrong.  The waiter came out a few times to ask verify with the other B'Day girls they type of Sushi they wanted. Probably my fault because I have a food alergy and so they were making sure that I wasn't going to eat any of one of the Sushi meals.The waitress carded EVERYONE that had an alcoholic beverage. I applaud her for that. But I was driving so no phot check for me.The Chef begain to cook and gave us all a pretty good show of his chopping and food throwing skills. Just FYI ladies.......I had to check my new wig to make sure it wasn't on fire once or twice because his fire/flames got a bit out of control once or twice. :)I ordered fried rice (Which costs more than steamed), Chicken and Filet Migon with Terriaki sauce. I thought the meal was WONDERFUL! The rice came with veggetables and a scrambled egg, of course. I removed the mushrooms but kept the rest. The steak was medium well, chicken was done. It all had a great taste!I ordered 3 Birthday Fruit boat things at $9 each for my party as we were all celebrating February birthdays. This also came with a $10 gift certificate for a futre visit.

The design of the restaurant is different and the location is very convenient for a business meal, but the food was just ok. Our party of 5 tried a lot of different things on the menu, but unfortunately nothing was worth seconds. The pork was cooked well, but served in a very small portion; the lamb was tender but lacking in flavor; and lastly the chicken was small and lacked flavor as well. The sides we tried were good (broccolini and fried cauliflower), but the most disappointing was the duck fat fries...they were just potato wedges; very underwhelming.We did have some of their cocktails to get our meal started, and they had great names (the trashy Italian being the table favorite!), but the overall taste didn't impress anyone so we didn't order seconds on those either.Unfortunately no one was up for trying dessert after the lack of enthusiasm for drinks and entrees so we opted out of ordering anything. In hindsight, the dessert menu had the greatest selection of choices so we should have tried something, but I personally don't feel like we missed out on anything special.Overall, the Commonwealth had a great, friendly staff, but the food just wasn't up to par with other restaurants in the area.

Once inside, you can definitely see the wear and tear of use on the place. The chairs were a little rickety, the menus slightly crumpled. It seemed like it was going for the very opulent classic look, but it somewhat missed the mark. There was an interesting selection of cocktails along with a limited bar menu.

I have this fear of rejection and that's too many steps where someone can tell me \\"what the hell are you talking about?\\" or \\"get outta here.\\"My first venture into the GA Chapter Room began with me and a friend upstairs at the hostess stand at Taco Mac. I asked where it was but it was loud so the hostess asked me where it was or what it was. Well-played hostess. I asked where and she told us to go down the sidewalk and look for a door with a monkey.So we headed down and couldn't find the place. But just at the right time my friend looked back and saw some door on it with what looked like an ornate monkey logo. Bam! Basically it's directly under TMac and there is a walkway off the sidewalk to get to the door. We went there, pressed the red button and we were ushered into a magical land.I've been there a few times now and there is a light menu. Same wings as TMac but the fries are thicker cut and better. Don't say you heard it from me but once we were there for a while and told the manager we had to head upstairs to get more food. Basically he let us order whatever we wanted off the TMac menu and they brought it downstairs. Score. That's service.They have a rotating selection of uncommon/rare beers on tap plus a nice selection of equally excellent bottled beers. Lots of high gravity stuff. Of course the curry tasting beer was a bit overspiced for me but the selection is good nonetheless. Last week we had the Aventinus 2006 which is not an easy find. It was fantastic. Jeremy (the manager?) talked with us for a while and educated us on their beer selection.The staff is nice, the atmosphere is great, it's dark-ish, reasonably clean, a few TVs with college/pro games on but not too loud (games usually on mute with music playing) and a great hangout.

There is also the bar option for those who want to drink other than coffee. We ordered a guava pastry, cinnamon pretzel, cortado, and cafe con leche. The cortado was a bit more bitter than we hoped but it was nice and hot. The cafe con leche was delicious! Not too sweet, great coffee flavor, and a nice pick-me-up at the airport. As for the pastries, the cinnamon pretzel stole the meal! It was soft, fluffy, and not too sweet but tons of cinnamon.

No peanut flavor, which is the way I like it. I really did expect it to be bland, since so many spots around Boston make it that way, but it was darn good! That fact I wish it came with more sauce, means I like it a lot. It might seem pricey for such a simple dish, but dan dan is $13-16 at fusion spots Blue Dragon and Night Shift, and around the same amount at Mala, Sichuan Gourmet, Five Spices House, and Mary Chung.

That is where you should put this barbecue. Preferably in your mouth hole. Then you should chew it and blast off on a rocket ship of smokey spicy tangy Texas deliciousness. Let's jump into the good stuff:Creamed Corn - Why is this #1? Cause it is absurdly tasty and you can guzzle it by the gallon. You should eat it until it hurts.Brisket - You ever been punched in the throat by a moist delicious flavor filled side of beef? No? Well, then you need to try Rudy's brisket.Service - The counter service guy was so nice I asked him to be my best man. That is saying a lot cause I am already married, which means I will have to get a divorce and remarry. Still, it would be worth it to have him in my wedding.Turkey - Screw Thanksgiving. Eat this turkey year round and never eat another slice of inferior poultry again.The BBQ Sauce - Skip the iced tea and just drink this straight. It pairs well with pretty much anything, so go slather your kale salad in it and then give the rest to a carnivore.Price - I ate like a king for under $30. 3 meats (1/2 pound each), 2 sides, a drink, and fixings. This was enough for a family meal. Saying that out loud makes me simultaneously proud and ashamed.So those are the highlights. Why isn't this a 5 star review you ask? Well for a few small reasons:Ribs - It was late in the day and they were a bit dried out. They were tasty, but not the best.Beans - But seriously who cares about the beans? They weren't bad, they were just boring. I would skip them next time and double down on the Creamed Corn.Overall - The Q here is above average and if I were just rating it on the meats alone, I'd probably go 3 stars, but a restaurant is more than just it's proteins.

The broccoli was almost cold and not steamed quite enough, so I ate one or two pieces. It did not appear to have been stir-fried.

Got refills before glass was even half empty. Waiter was very nice and knowledgeable. We weren't rushed through anything. Food: delicious. They serve complimentary bread with olive oil. The filet mignon was perfectly cooked and came with a delicious sauce. French fries are a must-try!! They're perfectly seasoned and come with 2 dipping sauces. The fries are perfect for sharing between 2-3 people. The octopus starter was also really good too. Only con - portions are rather small, even for a French place. Dessert: delicious!! As above, portions  are a little small, so if you love dessert, you should get 2 orders to share between 2 people (rather than sharing 1 dessert). Noise level: it's pretty quiet in the restaurant. I really don't like loud music when I'm trying to have a conversation with someone over dinner. This place was perfect. Price: it's actually not super pricey.

But, if you've done your research, expect to wait some time before getting a table. Thankfully, they use a texting system which is fairly advanced and reliable. There are also a fair amount of businesses and bars nearby to kill your time making the wait a little bit more bearable. Our wait was estimated at 2.5 hours and they even seated us well after closing time.When you do make your way into this restaurant and sit down to look at the menu, prepared to be confused. The mastermind behind this restaurant and those associated with it spent some time in Thailand learning the language and culture. The menu is huge, but also many of the dishes are in Thai with no English counterparts. Thankfully, there is an extensive description for each dish, but either do plenty of research beforehand or expect to peruse the menu to a great extent before ordering with your waiter. I went for the dish with pork belly and pork shoulder (the Kaeng Hang Leh apparently). It was quite the hardy dinner and had a wonderful spicy character. I had to order the rice separately, but all together, my dinner ended up being $18.50. I was able to finish the entire meal, so the portion was perfect. As pointed out this meal was pretty dense, so I'd recommend ordering some vegetables with it as well. We didn't order any drinks here, but did have their drinking vinegar next door at Whiskey Soda Lounge. This alcoholic drink is quite unique and may not sound very enjoyable, but I surprisingly found it to be very delicious. Vinegar isn't too overpowering and it makes for a great mix in any cocktail. I get the sense that the locals are pretty much over the idea of Pok Pok and the wait that comes with it. Still, I think Pok Pok warrants at least one visit. I hear they have one in LA now, so hopefully I'll have more of their food in the near future."},{"name":"Golden Lotus Chinese Restaurant","address":"8365 S John Young Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"food is good compared to other chinese restaurants nearby. parking is in front of restaurant. nothing else is impressive."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I first read about Pok Pok in Food & Wine magazine before moving here.

Mostly because every time it's been totally worth it! I can't comment on the dining room or lounge areas since I always find myself noshing on their outside patio. My first experience was the Cornish game hen with Thai chili, lime, lemongrass and cilantro. *WOW* the flavors were amazing! The meat was thoroughly shellacked with glaze and pulled right off the bone as if it was braised for hours. I devoured the little bird, so many flavors had permeated into the bones that I sucked them clean as if to draw out their precious life-force until only two small ones remained on my plate. Squab is definitely something they do right here so it's imperative you order the fish sauce wings. Hell I may never go back to buffalo again! I've also tried a variety of noodle dishes with ingredients or names I can't pronounce but what I can say is everything I've put in my mouth has been delicious!If you're skeptical about supporting a Thai restaurant run by a white guy you'll miss out on so much but I will gladly take your place in line."},{"name":"Chez Filet","address":"8255 International Dr, Ste 144A","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Very nicely prepared food and great service!

The server explained that the menu is designed as a tapas/sharing experience (no problem), and then explained that most people either order 2-3 dishes per person or else order the $65/person six-course tasting menu. Very helpful guidance.But after that, things got a little weird. We asked for some examples of what's on the tasting menu, in order to make an informed decision between that approach and the published menu. \\"I can't tell you that.\\" But how do we decide between that vs. ordering a la carte if we have no information what we're choosing between? \\"I can't TELL you because that's part of the APPEAL of the tasting menu, that it's all a SURPRISE.\\" But I do have some allergies and would feel a lot better NOT being surprised. \\"Of course we wouldn't give you something you're allergic to! Maybe you two should just think about it for a while.\\" And then . . . she walked off! No \\"let me get you some drinks while you think.\\" She just left.So there we sat, still with no idea what we were choosing from, as the waitress actively avoided us, and even avoided making eye contact with us, for the next 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile we sat there at an empty table with no drinks, staring at each other, watching other people being served their food, and mostly trying to figure out if we'd committed an unforgivable sin and they were just going to freeze us out until we took the hint and left of our own accord because we weren't cool enough for this place. But having watched what food arrived at other tables, we got a better idea what was on the tasting menu in a roundabout way (wouldn't it have been easier for everyone if she'd just told us upfront?) and decided to go for that after all. To save the rest of you that trouble and give you a general idea what to expect from the tasting menu:\\n- Homemade sourdough bread with creamery butter and maldon salt [on menu]: Terrific! Really really good. I assume they do this every day, so it's something you can count on.\\n- Charcuterie plate with homemade salami, pickles, and kimchi [pickles were on the menu, but salami was off-menu]: Also really good.\\n- Pan-seared peppers with shaved almonds and olive oil [off-menu]: Not bad. Needed a bit more seasoning. My wife liked this more than I did.\\n- Garden-grown tomatoes with fresh basil and feta cheese and anchovies [off-menu]: Probably the best-tasting thing of the night. The tomatoes were fresh-picked and lovely, just like out of your own garden, and unlike some other dishes, appropriately seasoned. \\n- Buttermilk fried chicken thighs (boneless) with a homemade cucumber and yogurt sauce [on menu]: Pretty good, although it was a little bland, and there were some bone fragments in one piece.\\n- Roasted radishes with fermented rice broth [off-menu]: Okay, but the broth wasn't remotely \\"bursting with umami\\" as the waitress claimed and the whole effect was dull. The staff were clearly more enthusiastic about this dish than it deserved, setting an expectation it failed to meet.\\n- Spaghetti with ground pork ragu in a carbonara-like egg sauce: Satisfying in a comfort-food way, but unlike most of the other dishes, actually TOO salty rather than under-seasoned.\\n- Fresh ripe figs with honey and yogurt: Really nice.\\n- Homemade torrone nougat: A nice ending.Some other observations that may be helpful in your visit:\\n* Reservations are recommended, but easy to make (even same day) via their website.\\n* As other reviewers have mentioned, the prices seemed a tad high, especially considering the inconsistent food and wine quality. I would have been a lot more forgiving of some of their faults if this had been an $85 meal for two rather than a $198 meal for two.\\n* The tasting menu was indeed a good deal: about the right amount of food for two people, and at a cheaper cost than ordering everything separate -- especially considering it was even more food than \\"six courses\\", depending on how you do the math. \\n* I'm pretty certain the wine we ordered was corked (i.e. had oxidized in the bottle). When I raised this to the waitress, rather than trusting me or tasting it herself, she defended it and said it was supposed to taste that way (online wine reviews confirm it ISN'T supposed to taste tart in any way). Maybe other staff members are more responsible, maybe not. Perhaps better to stick to the beer.\\n* The music was very loud, so conversation is a little difficult.\\n* Although being very supportive of vegan and vegetarian diets, they struck me as far too lackadaisical regarding other eating restrictions like allergies or religious constraints. Especially the refusal to talk about the details of the dishes until after they were served. Proceed with caution -- they seem not to care much if they send you to the hospital, because the \\"surprise\\" effect is obviously a higher priority to them than your health."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Cool place to go with a fun atmosphere and nice selection of cocktails.

It was Monday which apparently means Tiki night so I obliged with some kind of fruity froo froo drink that was torso length and harbored a paper monkey on a palm tree paper umbrella. I've loved the space ever since it was the Shuck Shack but the layout does pose two issues. If it's too hot, there's no way you want to sit outside and be sweaty mosquito bait. If its too chilly, you sit ass to elbows in an odd booth and speak to your friend sitting really closely next to you trucker-style. Second, a decent drink takes a long time. Like a long long time. So if you're in a large party and people order haphazardly, you can all expect to have drinks at different times. It means constant interruption and a too long time between drinks. I don't want them to cut back on their quality but maybe there's a limited menu if it gets too crowdy? Honestly their menu is so huge anyway it could be cut down to about half and still be extensive.

Let me start this by saying that I work in the service industry, always tip 20%, and RARELY complain... so I don't take reviews like this lightly!! For anyone local to Vancouver, don't take visitors or friends for dinner here... drinks are fine! I went with a friend on a fairly calm Monday evening while the restaurant was half full, and after asking to sit outside we were placed at an awkward table stuck right beside the server's station, with a clear view of a number of empty 4-seaters. Not ones to complain, we brushed it off as zoning for servers.\\n Our waitress was really sweet, but as the rest of the staff was awkwardly hovering around it made relaxing tough. The drinks we had were great, and kudos to the bartender for great flavour profiles, but that's where the good news ends.\\n I ordered the appetizer mussels/clams and requested to have the garlic bread side modified to fries, and (remembering that the restaurant was NOT busy) the waitress winced before letting me know the chef 'doesn't like' doing modifications. Now, if I was changing something crucial to the dish, I could understand refusal. Removing the pieces of garlic bread from the top of the dish and bringing a small side of fries though? It's an extra two seconds. The server didn't come back to notify me one way or the other, but when our food arrived I had received my full dish plus an additional side of fries. The seafood tasted slightly antiseptic, and the fries were the small leftover bits you get at the bottom of the basket, so both really underwhelming.   Then the bill arrived... \\nDrink=well worth its $10.50 price\\nMussel/Clam dish: $24.99... not worth it.\\nSide of Fries: $4.99... (why?!)  I tipped 18% because I wanted the server to know I appreciated her attentiveness and time. I would not have wanted to otherwise!! This brought my bill to just over $50 and that is money spent on a lesson learned. I won't be returning any time soon!

What a beautiful transformation of the old HCPasta locale. They basically only re-purposed the shell (well, they did keep the pizza oven) and filled it with tasteful, elegant d√©cor that lends to the inviting ambience. Very streamline, minimalist modern with a touch of rustic flare. 827Ray's has creatively divided the large space into two sections: the main dining area with tables, bench seating, and a fireplace if you desire a more intimate setting AND the bar area, with low table seating, vaulted ceilings, and tons of natural light for a more casual affair.   They offer fine farm fresh cuisine with some French influence, a vast selection of wines, full bar, and about a dozen beers (they need to step up the local ATX craft selection though!). 827 certainly waited until there were as close to 100% prepped before even doing their soft launch! Impressed! Complete lunch, dinner, and brunch menus available; and well-staffed...albeit the staff definitely needs some more training and practice (e.g., drink order wrong three times, couldn't answer some simple questions about menu items [it's not that large]); however, they were all very cordial and professional. I'm sure as time passes, the quality of service will improve. Please take into account that any criticism in this review is from an experience on their very first dinner service, so I'm being a bit forgiving and optimistic. I have every faith that anything that wasn't perfect will be quickly rectified. The owner and manager really seem to take great pride in the space and their cuisine, as both stopped by more than once to check on our table. Upon entering, the hubby and I were quickly greeted by a host. She offered seating in either of the two areas and we opted for a four top in the bar area. Drink orders were quickly taken (took quite a while to receive). As we perused the menu, a couple that we know walked in and of course we invited them to join us. Me and the hubs decided to share a few small plates and an entr√©e. Our friends both opted for steaks (one undercooked and one over - meh).*From the \\"Oyster Bar:\\" Ordered 2 \\"Cocktail Crab Claws\\" @$3 each. \\"What king of crab?\\" \\"I don't know. I'll have to check.\\" Returned...\\"Stone crab.\\" Me thinking...\\"wonderful! They must the very small ones, but what a treat!\\" Skeptical of the low price point I asked three times \\"STONE Crab, correct?\\" \\"Yes, Stone.\\" Nope. Just two, cold and soggy sad little SNOW crab claws. Lol! They were out of the \\"East Coast Oysters\\" which were Blue Points (she had to ask; later told by another server they weren't out?). I'm not too sure how successful the \\"Oyster Bar\\" will be, but we shall see. It's nice to have the option, if executed well.     *The beet salad was good: crisp, peppery baby greens, roasted beets, orange supremes, (could've used a tad more) bleu cheese, slightly over-dressed with sour vinaigrette. *Roasted Bone Marrow: Very large portion for only $12. Came with dressed frisee (over-dressed), large slices of bread, and cherry rosemary compote that was frankly...icky. The bone marrow itself was excellent though! Fatty, buttery goodness smeared on toast - mmm. *Oso Bucco: So so good! Perfectly braised, mouthwatering flavors, served on top of a large portion of blanched broccolini, smooth and rich potato mash and square chucks of cooked potato (thought this was particularly odd, but all was still very tasty). I want this dish again RIGHT now! ($19 -wow!)Overall: Serene setting, polite service, good and some GREAT eats at reasonable prices (a few a little high for what you get)...it can only get better from here IMHO. The waitstaff and kitchen have several kinks that need to be worked out; however, I think they'll figure it out pretty quickly.827Rays is SUCH a welcomed and much needed addition to the Lake Travis area.

The food was good, the bangers and mash was a familiar flavor while the scotch egg, though different, was pleasantly good.

I wanted to give the establishment some additional time to get the house in order before passing judgement, but the experience was exactly the same the second time so I think it is fair to light a fire under these guys.We arrived later in the evening around 8:30 on a Friday as we surprisingly discovered this location is only open until 9 PM. The restaurant was still pretty busy this close to closing time, and I wonder why the hours aren't extended until at least 10 PM on Friday and Saturday. *shrug* We quickly placed our order with the young girl at the register who had to refer to the menu as she had no idea what we were talking about when we ordered the 'Well D'Onion', a \\"signature\\" burger of theirs. We had a seat at a table near the pickup counter and waited for our food. This was at 8:40.  The restaurant is a cell dead zone, there is no service inside and it appears that they have WiFi, but it requires a password which isn't posted anywhere.. why? I don't want to have to ask for your WiFi password, so just make it open or don't have it at all.I stated earlier that this place was pretty busy even though it was really close to closing time, and this is probably because this place takes FOREVER to get orders out the door. We watched probably half a dozen people pick up their order, only to either be called back by the manager because something was left out of the bag, or the person picking up realized the order was wrong and brought it back to the counter. During this time, the manager was visibly upset, pacing back and forth behind the counter, barking orders and yelling at the staff. There wasn't anyone working above the age of 21 behind the counter except the manager, so I feel for these kids. Whatever training program this company has in place clearly isn't working as these people visibly had no idea what they were doing and there were way too many people just idly standing there doing nothing. Fast forward twenty minutes and our food shows up, lo and behold it's wrong, good thing we checked before leaving. After informing the staff, we waited another ten minutes (they are technically closed at this point) for another burger patty to be cooked after the kid was finishing up cleaning the grill. The guy asked what kind of cheese we wanted.. I don't know, the cheese that comes on it? He didn't know what kind of cheese came on the special burger. Okay. As a concession, we received a half hearted apology from the manager and the rest of the leftover fries that no one was going to eat... cool. We walked out the door at 9:15.The food was just alright. As other reviews state, the fries are straight up bad. The burgers were cooked fine but were kind of boring. Honestly the best part of the meal was the potato bun. I'd rate these burgers on the same level as Wendy's, and I'd probably go the extra few minutes down the road to the Billerica Wendy's over this place. A \\"large\\" shake is laughably small, no bigger than the smallest size drink at Wendy's or McD's. Five Guys is way better in all areas.There is just no reason to go here when you can get a fast food burger at a lower price for about the same quality.

I order the ribeye which very tender and paired with the creamy mashed potatoes which were not flavorful at all. The meal did not wow in any way so that was a let down given the hype the restaurant carries. Another thing I found odd was once the bill came the check had already been completed in full by our waiter to include their 20% gratuity. I was present with a table of for women and we each paid our own tab. We didn't bother to mention because the service was wonderful and we planned to leave that anyway. I do understand that some places included a mandatory gratuity on large groups (which I didn't think four people would count as), it is usually printed on the menu or bill and ours was not.

I want to love this place, but like a major league power hitter, these guys strike out almost as often as they connect. The first strikeout is the $90 per person charge for the tasting menu. To be honest, it's probably 15-20 bucks too much given what you get. Some of the offerings aren't much more than an amuse bouche. The second strike out is the all or nothing approach. You can't order the tasting menu unless everybody at your table orders. They offer some horseshit explanation for this, but I stopped listening partway through. Hoity toity blahbarble. Then you get the food. Everything is, at the very least, interesting. Most of it is fantastic. There are some things, however, that come off as a local chef trying too hard to be a trendsetter, which one can respect, but then there's something like the pork belly steam bun that is oh-so-6-years ago. seriously, bub?

The 110 Grill seemed like the least worst of the chain restaurants around, so we gave it a try.

I'm allergic to mushrooms and have been getting better about saying this when I'm out (places are surprisingly bad about always telling you when mushrooms are in something), so I was impressed to see my food come out with an allergy flag in it. I made a reservation online for a Friday night, though I am not entirely sure we really needed to do that. Service was great and consistent throughout the meal.Their beer menu would have been better if it told you basically anything about the beers; like an idiot, I had to ask the waitress if she could tell more than the name of a beer and where it was made. It turns out that if in doubt, it's an IPA right now. I finally got something from nearby Widowmaker that I hadn't tried at Widowmaker itself (where we had been right before) and, surprise, it was an IPA.We got the crab rangoon dip appetizer, which sounded AMAZING on the menu, but in reality....was fine. I never would have guessed it was supposed to be crab rangoon dip had you just placed it in front of me without telling me what it was. For my main, I ordered the fig and blue cheese flatbread, which was just about every single food I LOVE all piled into one dish: figs, blue cheese, arugula, caramelized onion and a balsamic drizzle.

Eat here about 6 times a year when I am in town. For all that time I have been a very satisfied customer even telling all my friends about it. Sadly, tonight was my first disappointing visit. Noticed almost all new staff. Did not recognize any servers. My guest got a drink that he discovered after sipping for a bit was in a disgustingly filthy glass. Staff took care of it and manager came by to apologize. Nonetheless not a great sign. A creature of habit I ordered my usual steak. Waited an unusually long time for entrees. My steak was cooked to order but was not as warm as I expected. Have to wonder if it sat for a while during our long wait. Odd thing was the restaurant was not crowded at all. My one guest was a first-timer to Mitchell's. The other was a local and regular. He and I agreed the quality has obviously dropped since the acquisition by Landry's. What a shame. There are many good alternatives in Columbus. I guess I'll be eating elsewhere from now on."},{"name":"Kizuki Ramen & Izakaya","address":"11830 NW Cedar Falls Dr, Ste 128","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Came here with my family on a Saturday afternoon. It is probably one of the best ramen places outside of Portland. There tend to be a wait, but when we came, we only had to wait for about 5 minutes! I had their garlic tonkotsu (most popular dish), and I absolutely love the broth. It is filled with garlic flavor. The noddles are chewy. The egg is perfectly cooked (soft on the outside, and runny on the inside). When you bite onto the piece of seaweed midway through the ramen, it automatically refreshes your palate with the saltiness before you take another bite of the savory ramen. The bean sprout and bamboo was a perfect amount (although I wouldn't mind for another helping of it if it was free). Customer service was absolutely lovely, and the price is very reasonable! By the time we were done, there was a line of people waiting for a table, so we quickly left. Definitely one of my favorite spots during a cold day."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Moonshine has by far the best southern food I have had the opportunity to try in Austin.

It comes with shrimp, some type of white fish, and scallops, along with some veggies such as tomato and onion. I got it with a side of cous cous which I definitely recommend, but it was way too much for one person! If you're with another person, share one order of cous cous unless you're very very hungry.

(We left and came right back after loving the donut holes). We went in at a time where it was not busy at all. There were maybe 3-4 tables occupied at most. I loved the donut holes but the way we were treated not only leaves a sour taste in my mouth but makes me want my money back.

Granted, there's a decent relatively cheap lunch menu. -Location: The restaurant is located in a little strip with a sketchy ice cream stand and a strip club. There's another Korean restaurant down the street, but I haven't visited yet.-Food: You get a couple of your standard side dishes: kimchi, radish kimchi, cucumber, bean sprouts. The kimchi is not fresh tasting, not surprising since there aren't a lot of customers to eat it. They have a menu that ranges from tofu soup to bimbimbap to korean bbq. My kimchi soup was mediocre at best and came with less rice than other places. We also had a lot of fruit flies circling around our table when the food came incessantly. So I'm not sure if the people here fail to keep the place clean?-Ambience: Besides the fruit flies, there was nobody else eating lunch the whole time we were there at noon. The waitress was reasonably nice but doesn't compensate for the less than fresh food and fruit flies everywhere. Maybe bbq is the way to go and not the other entrees, but the cleanliness is still a big issue, especially when they didn't do so well on their health inspection."},{"name":"Oath Pizza - Coolidge Corner","address":"276 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"Expected it to be similar experience as Blaze pizza.

Realizing that we have only been one time and that I would like to preface my rating with the fact that while we would much rather find a great home grown restaurant than participate in the mass crawl to the over population of chain restaurants, this was a very unexpected great experience.  I expected to dislike everything Cantina Laredo.  And am being generous of the 4 star rating here due to a couple of menu items.Negative(s) First:  They should not sell the tableside quac so hard and act like it is a well kept secret.  And if you get the guac, you may want to request a dash of salt cause it is very, very bland.   The other menu item to sincerely avoid is the Enchiladas de Mole.  Wow!  This was overpowered with chocolate.  It was almost inedible.  We personally overhead 2 tables return the item and another just complain.Now for the good news. . .Drinks:  The margs were exceptional with none of that oversweet marg mix.  Ours were perfect.  Notation that we upgraded the tequila to a mid-range Anejo.Chips and Salsa:  They serve 2 salsas with chips.  Both were very good; although not a lot of heat.Drinks:  Did I mention the margs?Entree:  The Fiesta Grill was very, very yummy and well worth the $22 bucks.  It is a lot of food though.  It can easily feed 2 people.Dessert:  We weren't going to have dessert cause we were really full.  But our adorable waitress suggested the Mexican Apple Pie topped with a brandy butter and cinnamon ice cream.  Didn't sound too great but we thought we would try it.  We absolutely loved it and ate every bite!Overall a great experience.

The menu is EXTREMELY extensive with lots of great options! Ultimately my party and I decided on Surf & Turf Benedict, Breakfast nachos & Oreo buttermilk pancakes. We were anxious to get those first few bites & boy when we did all 3 of us were in HEAVEN! The surf & turf Benedict was cooked to perfection, the lobster meat was plentiful and sweet. No complaints whatsoever! Same for the Oreo buttermilk pancakes. While the breakfast nachos were great with flavor there was a-bit of a mix up with there being no eggs that came with it, despite eggs being order. HOWEVER, our server Mandy was INCREDIBLY kind & apologetic to the whole situation and fixed the issue immediately. The owner made it her business to come out & personally serve us the eggs which was a nice touch because well, she didn't have to! It gave us a chance to compliment the food & how great it was & to just make small conversation which I thoroughly enjoyed.

I've tried both the Chicken Rich Ramen and the Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen. I prefer the latter, since I like stronger flavors, but the Chicken also has a very heavy flavored broth. The primary criteria for good Ramen imo is the broth should have been cooked for many hours in the kitchen. You can tell they've definitely done it here. As for appetizers I tried the Chicken Karaage, it's delicious. I have yet to try others.Tip: They have the option between traditional and low-sodium broth.

While poutine, I believe, is more of an eastern/Montreal specialty, I'm not going to pass up gravy, fries, and cheese curds. Since our layover was from 1am to noon, we were limited in our chance to explore beyond our hotel and thus the YVR Poutine Crawl was born. Here are our rankings:1. Canucks Bar & Grill (USA terminal/AFTER security): Above and beyond the best we had, but we figured this would be the case. They offer a classic poutine, and a version with mushrooms and bacon. We got the latter and thought the mushrooms were chewy, but the bacon was a good addition. The only bummer with this was that Canucks Bar & Grill had surly staff and they seated us RIGHT in front of constantly buzzing kitchen door despite tons of other seating. They have no Canadian beers on tap, but a bunch in bottles.2. A&W (National terminal/BEFORE security). This was our first taste and I actually really liked it. The cheese curds were squeaky and not too melty, the gravy was good and plentiful, but the fries were a tad soggy. I thought I would like soggy fries better, but crispy actually taste better!3. Burger King (USA terminal/AFTER security) The cheese curds were melted and the stringy gooey mess was delcious, but a pain in the rear to eat. We basically needed to use our hands to pull it apart. The crispy fries were a bonus. They do technically offer bacon for $1, but they were out.Honorable mention: White Spot (National terminal/BEFORE security): They serve poutine, but  only once breakfast is over at 11am. **Note: It is VERY easy to walk between the National/USA/International terminals.

The long line outside this small Italian restaurant is a pain to wait in but I assure you it is worth it! My friend and I were seated at a community table. Service was quick and provided by one guy. He was incredibly friendly and full of suggestions which help if you're feeling a little overwhelmed by the menu! My friend and I ordered the scallops and mussels linguini in Diavolo sauce (spicy tomato)! Note that this is NOT on the chalkboard menu so if this is something you'd like to try, let him know! We also ordered the squid ink noodles and started with their famous friend calamari. The calamari was prepared perfectly. It was tender, not chewy! The squid ink noodles with the minced calamari and garlic white wine sauce was an absolutely delicious experience. Don't forget to ask for extra bread so you can dip that fluffy sauce sponge in your pasta and scoop up the rest of that saucy goodness. Lastly, cash. Bring it.

Overall, a subpar experience. Especially when you realize that the average plate is ~ $14 for the tasting menu. Started off by waiting another 15 minutes past our reservation to be seated. That's how you treat guests who are forced to prepay for dinner and gratuity a couple of weeks before walking in the front door. When we were presented with the 1st course our server said \\"this is our take on the blooming onion\\" setting the stage for the rest of the night.  What we were given was a mini bouquet of flowers about the size of a half dollar that was served with a dollop of creamy garlic sauce. I get the joke, the flowers are blooming and it tastes like mild raw onion.The 2nd was a grilled fern about the size of 1 single green bean. Only thing special about this is the way it looked. The 3rd dish was some sort of cabbage with little bits of shaved cow tongue. This sat atop a hard shell tortilla about the size of a Tostitos chip. To be honest, it was good but the mood and the experience were quickly getting away from us. I will say that courses 4 through 6 were good. However it took over 1.5 hours before we even hit the halfway mark of the tasting menu. These dishes consisted of lamb, halibut & duck. All of which were tasty but were also very small. I would guess about 1-2oz portions. By the time we finished course 6, we had been at the restaurant for about 2 hours and 15 minutes. I think the Kitchen and wait staff started to realize just how slow they had been serving us. There were only 2-3 other tables left and we still had 2 more courses to go. Courses 7 & 8 were meant to be dessert. Course 7 was a strawberry cream puff and it was absolutely delicious. Had the night ended there, it probably would have been best. The last dish we were served was just plain off. When brought out, it definitely seemed interesting. My guess is that it was a coconut oil sphere that was hollowed out on the inside and then \\"infused\\" with.....flower flavored water. My fianc√© and I both cringed when tasting it. No exaggeration, it was one of the worst things either of us have ever had. As a recap of what $115 per person buys you\\n#1 - a flower \\n#2 - a fern that resembles a single green bean\\n#3 - a single nacho topped with cabbage and cow tongue \\n#4 - 1oz of fish\\n#5 - spoonful of pasta topped with duck \\n#6 - Lamb about 2oz\\n#7 - strawberry cream puff\\n#8 - waxy ball filled with flower water. \\nAt the end of the night, $200+ later between two of us; we both left hungry and tired, and considered ordering a pizza when we got home."},{"name":"Hakata Ramen","address":"673 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"The weather here in Boston inspired me to go with this place.

I actually waited about a week to write this bc I was pretty annoyed with my experience and thought I might be overly harsh if I reviewed them right away...\\nSo, we just moved to Austin from the north east and we're looking for some good sushi. After reading the reviews online, we were super excited to try this place! I \\ncalled in to order takeout and the guy who answered was super friendly and helpful. We offered 2 of the Truffle Maki, 1 Crispy Salmon Maki, and 1 spicy edamame. The Crispy Salmon Maki was pretty good (4/5). The edamame was fine but not spicy which they said they can adjust when you eat in (fair enough). That leaves us with the 2 orders of Truffle Maki... we were so excited about this that we ordered two rolls and it seriously smelled and tasted like old meat that sat out for 3 days. When I called to let them know they were super nice and apologized and explained to me that they don't usually allow takeout orders for sushi bc their are hot and cold elements involved or whatever. Ok fine. That totally makes sense! Then they told me that if I wanted a refund on the 2 Truffled Maki I would need to physically bring it in to their store to prove that we didn't eat all of it... ?! ... yes, they were serious. At this point it was pretty late at night and we live a solid 20 mins away so they agreed to let me just email them the pictures of what we had left of the sushi.

Pretty much guaranteed you will spend more time in here than you planned.Clerks are friendly and there are helpful info. stands placed conveniently.  There are a couple entrances, too.  \\nMy latest transaction was a little unusual to my normal wonderful experience here.  I purchased some Holiday greeting cards and some LED string lights on a random whim.  When I went to use the lights later that week - I found 1. they were not the twinkling kind (my fault) should have read the package closer (as I just bought exact brand that do twinkle at another retailer). When I was trying to open the battery compartment, it broke.  So, I examined it and was not too satisfied that it wasn't exactly what I wanted and then later the item broke without any negligence on my part. I decided to see if I could return or at least exchange - I was willing to take a credit in the store.  They were $9. I had the receipt and had purchased within the week.  The first clerk I approached didn't really try to help, she just called a Manager over - I was shut down quickly even though I explained and said I'd be open to other option besides a REFUND. Odd, that because they cannot resell the item, they couldn't return - most retailers will at least accept a broken item and offer a credit - that's why they have Reclaim.  She was a bit rude as well, then offered to call another manager over.  He approached the counter, heard me out and immediately offered a refund.  Wow!  Appreciate the service.

As I was waiting to pick up my order, entrees were being served to some people at the bar and the portions were huge and oversized. Easy leftover meal. I can justify the price if I can eat on it twice. I was also thinking, it's Moonshine, they know how to cook really delicious comfort food and so I was anticipating some lovely roasted chunks of turkey and some really great bacon.No deal.The mixed greens themselves were about the total quantity of a side salad. 1 small sliced egg, about a tablespoon and a half of BACON BITS, real bacon bits, but seriously, bacon bits? 4 TINY slices of avacado, 7 halves of the small grape tomatoes and about a quarter of a cup of diced, pressed turkey breast.

This review is not on the owner's personality she is  lovely and really wanted to do a good job and tried to please me, however she does not have the skills to deal with someone who stretches their relaxers past the recommended 8 weeks period.I stretch my relaxers for 4 months at a time because this gives me 2 inches of new growth which minimizes the chances of the relaxer overlapping on previously relaxed hair.  I also like the strength and length I have been able to retain by not relaxing my hair too often.  There were some things that Blessing did a great job with, I will start with those:1. Applied the relaxer only to the new growth and started from the nape which is the coarsest part of my head. 2. Did not repeatedly comb through the relaxer which is a no no if you aren't going for bone straight.3. Use a wide tooth comb to get through the extra thick sections without \\"warming\\" the relaxer up which can cause damage.\\n \\n4. Sectioned hair and sat me under the dryer until hair was 70% dry before blow-drying which is really good.  Blowdrying soaking wet hair causes damage.Here are the things I was unhappy about:1. Did not use enough relaxer for the amount and thickness of my hair. 2. Did not use the back of the rat tail comb or hands to smooth the relaxer into my hair which would have helped it take better.3. She jokingly asked if I would be willing to detangle my own hair.  When I saw her reach for a cheap plastic brush with those little round plastic knobs on top, I actually started detangling my own hair but she did not stop me or insist on doing it even though I was paying $165 for the service.  4. It was very awkward and uncomfortable for me to detangle my own hair while she was blow drying it at the same time.  At one point, I asked her to please pick up the section and hold in still while gently combing from the ends up.  I could feel her combing and brushing my hair flat against my back, which is not proper technique.5. I was given a protein treatment after the relaxer but my hair wasn't deep conditioned when it was rinsed out.  When I asked her why, she said because it wasn't a hard protein treatment. That deep conditioning is only done after a hard protein treatment.  Sounded good to me but when it was time to blow dry, my hair was VERY hard and stiff.  It didn't feel soft like I am used to it feeling after being conditioned.  Either the protein treatment wasn't all the way rinsed out or it was just dry and in need of deep conditioning. What ever the reason, I didn't feel Paul Mitchell products were good for my hair.  I take my daughter to SuperCuts and that's the brand they use, I prefer Kera Care or some other line specifically for black hair.6.The right side of my head and a section of the back was completely under processed.  When I pointed this out, she said it was because I didn't want her to comb the area.  I did not want her to comb my fragile edges because they tend to break, but the area I was talking about was the side and back of my head and besides, she was already done with those area when I asked her to stop combing back my edges.  I think she may have gotten tired by the time she reached the other side of my head.I need to mention that Blessing offered to have me come back in 3 weeks to do a corrective relaxer on the side and back of my head that didn't take but I will pass. I just don't think she has the experience to do my hair properly.  If you are getting regular 8-10 week touch-ups and a simple blow-dry or roller set, this place is fine, but if you are texlaxing virgin hair or if you like to stretch your relaxers, I don't think this is a good place to have it done.  I was charged $95 for the texlax, 30 for a trim (wow) and $20 for the protein treatment and I left $20 tip.  $165 and I was so disappointed.  Newbury St. prices without the Newbury Street results.I called a friend afterwards and she recommended I try Arthur Harris Salon on Newbury St.  I met with Arthur a couple days later and amazingly, he was able to tell me so much about my hair.  He spent and hour touching, looking at and talking to me about my hair which I realize did not happen at Salon 27.  She didn't even touch my hair when I went in for the consult.  That should have been a red flag.

Hidden up in the trees in the Oregon College of Arts and Crafts campus out on W. Barnes road, the Caf√© is a great spot for a casual, and delicious, meal. The menu is very limited, with new items daily. There are usually 3 or 4 breakfast items to choose from including a delicious and innovative benedict, a pancakes option with seasonal fruit, and an omelet. The kitchen is flexible, and if you have a vegan in your group they are always willing to throw something delicious and filling together. On my most recent visit, for Easter Sunday Brunch, the menu consisted of a salmon benedict, pancakes with strawberries, an omelet with fresh asparagus and other veggies, and a spring lamb bourguignonne with poached egg and herbed polenta. Everything has an intense depth of flavor, based on vigorous use of herbs, seasonings, and seasonal ingredients. Everything I have ever eaten at Hands On is downright amazing. The lamb bourguignonne was fantastic, with a rich sauce, some pork belly for flavor, a few seasonal veggies, and succulent, perfectly tender morsels of lamb. With the poached egg on top and the herbed polenta, it was well beyond what I could have hoped for from the unassuming caf√© setting. A meal at Hands On is always an experience as well. When seated, you are presented with a small plate of sweet breads and a half-grapefruit with a candied-ginger sugar seasoning. The service is always friendly and on-point, the coffee is string, black, and constantly on refill, and everything fits together just perfectly. With a vibrant and cozy interior and an outdoor patio amidst the trees for sunny days, there's a vibe for just about any occasion.  The Caf√© is attached to the OCAC gallery and gift store, so there are amazing and beautiful works of art and craft to peruse while waiting for a table or while digesting after a meal. \\n \\nHow I avoid more meals at this place is beyond me. Possibly because it sits just off my radar, or maybe that it's an out-of-sight, out-of-mind type of deal, I'm not sure. Regardless, the 2 or 3 meals I enjoy here each year are simply not enough. This morning's meal is a strong reminder of why I need to get out to Hands On more often.

My husband and I came to celebrate our one year wedding anniversary and we giggled over the huge picture (and only painting in the restaurant) of Kevin Rathbun looming over our table.  Our service was good, but when we tried to strike up a conversation with our server, he was too formal for our taste.  The food was average--I had the strip steak MR and it was bland and overcooked.  My husband liked his fillet and his creamed corn--but the creamed corn at Parish is just as good.  My mashed potatoes were horribly over salted and inedible--I was incredulous--did they not taste it before they served it???  I wanted to send it back, but I suffer from restaurant guilt from being in the service industry for years and I ignore hairs, bugs, and even a finger nail once (EW, it was in my drink and I threw it away). Lastly, it was horribly overpriced for what it was...I like the original Rathbun and Krog Bar, but I will pass on Rathbun Steak.  We left and went to Kroger for ice cream after we overspent on bad food...next year, I am putting on a pair of jeans and going to a bar for our anniversary.

Not to die for but good. I also had the pretzel app along with the grits and crawfish app. They were both deeeelicious. The cocktails were incredibly proper. That's very important to me because many places that do happy hour tend to deliver half-assedness along with their half-off food and drinks. Their (version of) old-fashioned was the best I've had in a long time. I tried a couple other cocktails and they were all pretty superb.

I replaced my eggs to eggwhites, asked for it to be cooked with minimal oil, and asked for sugar free syrup which they had no issue with.My overall experience exceeded my expectations and I would definitely recommend Slappy Cakes to everyone.

I had the sablefish with Indian spices and it was fantastic.   My crab cake to start was superb.  It came with a truffle mayonnaise (and I am not a truffle person) so they subbed it with something that was SOOOO good.   Then my dessert - pumpkin spice latte cake.

We were sitting in the mezzanine where there were 2 servers in the section which both served us. It's possible that one of them wasn't our main server- but not even a minor acknowledgment that she heard her OR letting my mom know that she would get her main server.

He handed over a heavy Styrofoam platter that I could easily guess weighed about 2 lbs. When we opened it, we were treated to a rather aesthetically pleasing Pad See Ew. It contained a combination of julienned carrots, bean sprouts, cilantro sprigs, broccoli, thin slices of beef, and an generous serving of flat rice noodles. Served on top was a nice sprinkle of chopped peanut bits and a lime wedge for good measure. I was surprised at how much food we got for $5.00, easily feeding two people or one very hungry person. The noodles were soft and far from greasy. The sliced beef was tender and flavorful. The added bonus of all the vegetables really gave this dish some texture, from the springy and refreshing bean sprouts, to the crunchy broccoli. Combined, it had the the perfect level of sweetness, making for a rather pleasing Pad See Ew that I'm sure many will appreciate.I have to venture to say that Thai Sky serves a Pad See Ew that is a step above the norm, and possibly even doing better than a lot of Thai restaurants on 9th Ave in New York City and Elmhurst in Queens, New York.

The chicken wings were fairly ordinary, didn't necessarily knock our socks off. We couldn't finish the steak salad because it was overpowered with fish sauce, lime and basil.

He's already declared his intention to seek out the NYC (where we both currently live) outpost to have the wings again!The parents and I got three dishes to share family-style: \\n-Half a Kai Yaang Tuua chicken\\n-Kung Op Wun Sen\\n-Khao Man Som Tam (A substitution for the Som Tam Isaan, for which the crab wasn't available when we were in -- frustrating, given that it's one of Pok Pok's signatures, and you'd expect they would keep ingredients for that in stock) We found the chicken very good, the Kung Op Won Sen to be underwhelming (very few shrimp, pork belly over-charred, and basically no vegetables in the glass noodles), and the Khao Man Som Tam to be so-so (great coconut rice, decent but somewhat too salty pulled pork, and a great papaya salad). And, overall, everything was very, very salty.As a side, we got a sticky rice for the table. This was served in a plastic baggie inside the bamboo container, which is a little gross--personally, I hate to be served hot food in plastic containers, as heat causes chemicals to leach from plastic.My boyfriend and I also got drinks: Tamarind Whiskey Sour for him, and a Mango Alexander for me. I found his to be pretty good, and heavy on the tamarind, which is authentic as a Northern Thai flavor; mine was like an alcoholic lassi, which was good until it sat for a bit, and then the water in the ice started to separate out from the rest of the drink, creating a weird ring around the drink.An annoying non-food-related note: service was both slow (for taking orders) and somewhat rude. We asked the waiter to take a picture for us, and he was very brusque about it, in a way that made it seem like he felt he was too important to be taking photos for patrons. Not a great look.

The sauce was good. The white rice was made well. Not mushy.\\nPad Thai: I took two bites before my bf stole it and inhaled it. I really liked it. Shrimp weren't rubbery, which is impressive, bc the shrimp is overcooked in every Chinese place ever.\\nSugar donuts! YES!  only disappointment that they don't add cinnamon with the sugar nor do they use any honey or syrup. They were perfectly fried and then packed in sugar..which is fine.. But they could really take it a step higher with a few added spices. I'd still eat this until I got diabetes tho. \\nAnyway that's my review.

The server was friendly and knowledgeable.  We started with an appetizer which was called the \\"Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail\\" for $19.  We were served with 4 very average, slightly over cooked shrimp.  We chose the Prime Porterhouse Served Tableside for $89 and requested it to be cooked medium rare.  We had to send the steak back as it was mostly bright red and bloody.  It returned only slightly less bloody and the meat was a bit chewy and unremarkable.  The sides which were explained to be shareable were no larger than a single serving and the Brussel sprouts were undercooked and hard.  We ordered the cheesecake to be shared for desert and we were presented with a small round piece of \\"cake\\" that had an undesirable texture and a crust that was unappetizing.  The accompanying raspberries were mushy and the blackberries were hard.   I paid the bill and retreated to the men's bathroom where I unfortunately somehow managed to leave my cell phone.  When I arrived at home I discovered that my cell phone was missing and quickly called the establishment.  The phone never materialized, much to my chagrin.

OK  Now that the negatives are out of the way let's talk positives.  The salsa had a really great flavor and just the right punch to it. We were hungry and destroyed the chips almost immediately. I ordered one of the lunch specials and really wish I could remember what it was  called.  It was delicious. It was a chicken dish with chorizo sausage and a cheesy cream sauce on it. It was surprisingly delicious, It had a mix of spices that just worked very well together. I will definitely order this again but it was good enough that I would feel confident enough to venture to try a new dish as well.  My dining companion had beef enchiladas and they were also equally delicious. It was obvious that both dishes were seasoned throughout the cooking process not just cooked and some spices thrown in at the last minute.  Both were great choices.Now I always say that a great judge of a Mexican restaurant's dishes is their beans.  I like both the pinto beans and re fried beans although many don't offer just pinto beans. Well their beans were good.

Drinks:  There are numerous options of interesting cocktails. I ordered a Mai Tai, since I haven't had one since the mid 2000s.  The Mai Tai was tasty with frothy foamy pineapple juice.    Atmosphere:  Dark, funky, classy.  Cost: The cost is mid to high, but I suspect in this area, for a fun cool place like this, it is expected."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Came for raw oyster bar.

It's a no frills, 20 seat restaurant on Hanover street of the north end. I always get the black ink pasta but have gotten the other red sauce dishes before as well. This time we got a full size of the aglio oglio (ground squid in a scampi like sauce) with the squid ink pasta. And an appetizer (half size) of the squid ink pasta with Alfredo. Split between 2 people this was perfect as the Alfredo is really rich and creamy and I don't think I could eat a full size of this. Regardless this is a great place if you like pasta and seafood. The service was what you would expect from a place like this. Snappy and brief waitress who had a lot of things to do. If you're looking for a place that is buddy buddy and will talk with you while you have your meal. Not your place. And I'm fine with that. This location is a little more expensive and more busy than the Brookline location( which I personally think is better!) and likes are always long during a weekend or dinner time."},{"name":"110 Grill","address":"170 Forbes Rd","city":"Braintree","stars":"4","text":"Had an amazing meal there and my server, Melissa was so wonderful and helpful.

Yes, it's expensive. Yes, it's tiny. Yes, the service can be spotty, that's because there's /one/ waitress doing everything in the whole damn restaurant. The place is an exercise in minimalism and simplicity and (I think) aims to prove that the best meals derive from good ingredients, love, and honest hard work.So first, the wait. It was long, real long, just like other restaurants on the North End. Since we had just come all the way from Fenway after having had a couple beers on an empty stomach, we were able to amuse ourselves for the 45-50 minutes required for us to secure a table.Well, let me rewind. At first, we weren't even sure we were going to get a table. The people in front of us in line told us that the chef was not accepting further customers after them due to their 10PM closing time (we showed up at 9.) But I thought this was balderdash and went in to ask the man himself.Me: \\"Hey, so the girls back there told me you're not taking any customers after them. Is that true?\\"\\nHim: \\"Well you know what, I think we can squeeze you in. WE ARE OPEN, MAN! You get in that line!\\" *rockstar pose while mashing up hundreds of cloves of garlic in the Robo Coupe*\\nMe: \\"So let me get this straight. You are\\" .. *my own rockstar pose* .. \\"OPEN?\\"\\nHim: \\"WE ARE OPEN!\\" *rockstar pose times two*So once we got in, we laid out our plan of attack. Since there were four of us, we decided to order up four appetizer portions (since 2 appetizers = 1 entree), and go big with the Lobster fra Diavolo (suggested service for 2 people.) We got these appetizers:- Clams casino (stuffed baked clams)\\n- Fried calamari\\n- Squid ink pasta, aglio e olio with ground calamari (the best! THE BEST!)\\n- Squid ink pasta, puttanesca (more like squid ink pasta with fajita veggies, but still tasty nonetheless.)And the Lobster? Amazing. The whole skillet was plunked on our table with still-bubbling diavolo sauce, linguine, shrimp, calamari, mussels, clams, and most of all, 1.25 lobsters (body, tail, and claws.) We ate like people have never eaten before. (Well, mainly, we ate seafood like Asians usually eat seafood -- really messy, lots of gusto, offending the people around us with our slurping noises.)Over the course of the meal we also ordered two glasses of wine (total, not each.) Total came to $40 a person with tip included and I felt that that was a very good deal considering we ordered the single most expensive dish on the menu and even got two $7 glasses of wine.The whole time we were there, I also felt that the honesty and sincerity of the staff really made a difference. It's the difference that made the plastic wine cups endearing, not tacky. A snooty restaurant could do the same thing and I might be offended. But I felt very at home here -- and I feel like that's how you should feel at any Italian restaurant."},{"name":"Rudy's \\"Country Store\\" and Bar-B-Q","address":"11570 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I've always loved BBQ and Rudy's is one of my favorite.

I'm a NYer, in the area for business and walking aimlessly in Allston area looking for a bite to eat. Its 11am and there's either nothing around, or nothing open. But instinct told me to keep walking and sure enough I find this little hole-in-the-wall diner.  But that's the thing, its no dive!  Its got its own flavor, both in ambience, service, and FOOD!  Look, I come from a long line of small-diner lovers. My uncle even owned a tiny coffee shop I used to love.  But this was the find of the century.  It had people's random sketches of all kinds of art work, on check pad paper, all over the walls.  A house artists or whatever the patrons make?  Who knows, who cares. It was cool.  The sign above the kitchen said, \\"No Whining\\". No punctuation, just matter of fact. lol. BADASS.   The music was Hard Rock on the radio, which I love, but low volume enough to not be a disturbance. The waitress, Jennifer, was manning the whole floor operation by herself, waiting tables and the bar, answering phones, serving and smiling the whole time. Not to mention her full sleeve-tats, both arms, that helped give this place the out-of-the-box, hip, cool, trendy biker feel wrapped in a hometown-style diner. And then there was the food.Menu didn't look like anything was going to be different than every other diner in America. Glad my eyes deceived me.  I only had the chance to order the HOMEMADE Corned Beef hash, eggs with cheese and homefries, with rye toast. Holy shit, it was so good!  Like all original takes in this combo, and all perfectly delicious!!!  The corned beef hash was indeed homemade (I asked to double check, and I did double receive!), the eggs were light, fluffy and cheddar cheesy, the homefries were actually more like crispy chips, clearly made from thinly sliced potato circles, and then the best part? I love rye toast. But this was MARBLE RYE TOAST. lol. what a twist. What treat!  Look, its a hard place to find and kind of off the beaten path, but if you're in the Boston-Allston area, looking for an original experience with original food, get to Allston Diner. Ask for Jen (she used to work there years ago and is recently back.  Get there soon so she can give you the same hospitality she gave this tourist-actor-adventurer!).  And order anything...if my breakfast was that good, I'm sure all their items are original takes on classic foods. Only open to 3pm daily, 2pm weekends.

It was perfectly baked and the chocolate and sugar combination were so good. The lemon pound cake was also quite tasty.

I thought it was, which is why it took me so long to try it out, but I've come to find out that it can be enjoyable for adults as well, if you do it right. Step 1: Make sure everyone in your party is 21+\\nStep 2: Make sure nobody in your party cares about making their own pancakes (if you're all adults, you know you can easily do that same thing at home - without the wait)\\nStep 3: Pry your way through the loud crowd of families waiting for grill tables and head straight for the bar.\\nStep 4: Sit at the bar and enjoy your meal - generally without a wait (it's a seat-yourself situation).Sure, you don't get to make your own pancakes, but unless you have kids with you, do you really care about that? I go out so I don't have to make my own food at home. And even if you sit at the bar, you can have them make the same pancakes for you in the back - just choose your fixings and go! And yes, they have some interesting pancake fixins (Bacon! Blue cheese!).If you don't want pancakes, the non-pancake section of the menu has a lot of interesting items on it, some of which you don't see often in Portland like chicken Tinga and my all-time favorite toad-in-a-hole. I grew up with toad-in-a-hole (aka egg-in-a-hole aka gas-house eggs) and rarely see it on menus, especially in Portland, so I was super stoked to see it on the Slappy Cakes menu. The food is generally pretty good (nothing mind-blowing) but the prices are also pretty high. Most of the breakfast item prices run around $10-$11, which is a couple of dollars more than most breakfast places in town. So if you want to get your hands on some Tinga, you're going to have to pay for it. For those prices you could go to Country Cat and get \\"some serious gourmet shit\\" (as Jules would put it) without much of a wait. If you're willing to brave Montavilla, that is. The one cocktail I sampled was the bloody, which was spicy and stiff but lacking in the depth I usually like to have in my bloody. I'm guessing the scratch mix is primarily tomato juice and hot sauce. I'm a fan of having some other seasonings in there to give it some body. But it's made with New Deal (a favorite vodka of mine) and served with a smile, so I can't complain too much. Some of the other cocktails looked interesting as well. Our service was great when we sat at the bar - prompt and attentive. Our wait was nil (while those waiting for grill tables were still waiting when we left at the end of our meal). Our food was decent. Our bill was a tad steep. For that, I think an A-OK 3 star rating is quite right from the perspective of kidless folk looking for a solid breakfast. If the prices were a couple of dollars less expensive (which would be fitting for the quality of the food), then it would be a 4-star experience."},{"name":"Taipei 101","address":"3050 Alafaya Trl, Ste 1008","city":"Oviedo","stars":"4.5","text":"This a good little hole-in-the-wall type place with yummy things on the menu.

Food quality has pretty clearly gone down of the past few years. Prices, however as we all know, are an inverse relationship in this case. If you love seafood, this place should be a treat for you!They have tons of options here. They have grilled protein options, udon soup noodles, sushi/sashimi, noodles, proteins, and desert. Once again with these places, it's hard for them to focus on one specific dish and perfect it -- it shows. The buffet food is honestly not good. Because of the wide variety it is hard for me to go through each dish. The proteins were incredibly dry, many of the other stir fry or other dishes came out bland. I personally couldn't consume the seafood, but with the other people I was with, it was clear the sushi cuts were a bit off and just not as much as before. Aside from the main lines are the udon noodle, barbecue, and desert lines. The udon soups tasted quite filled with MSG. Barbecue, like the main line's protein, came out quite dry and unfulfilling. Desert, well simply just not good. It seems to me that this place focuses exclusively on seafood and still does not execute that well. For the prices that they charge here, it's definitely not worth a trip for those who don't intend on consuming seafood. Even if you are consuming an entire seafood course, still, quite expensive for the lack of quality.Service is pretty alright since it's pretty hard to mess up a buffet style service.

There was no meat (besides the egg) in my dish even though this was a non-vegetarian dish. In addition, it was mostly rice and lacked the traditional filling. Tendency to be stingy with the condiments especially the kimchi. They expected us to share small bowls of condiments among 3 individuals. The kimchi tasted bland, as if it didn't ferment long enough.\\nI believe it speaks volumes that I have had better quality bulgogi and bibimbap in a college town compared to a restaurant in Austin.Service: Probably one of the worst service experiences I have had. This is a big reason why I am giving it a low review.\\n1. In general, they are not welcoming. Observing the waitresses, you can tell they treat non-Asians differently. I understand there is always a language barrier. However, it is an issue when you blatantly ignore other patrons.\\n2. Our waitresses put in the orders of 4 tables that arrived after us even though we were ready to order. In fact, we had to leave our table to go get her so we could put in an order, she kept ignoring our table the whole time.\\n3. When are food was served, we asked the server if we could have another side of kimchi since she gave us 1 tiny bowl (fist size) to split among 3 individuals. She was mean about it, telling us \\"no, that we need to finish the small bowl first\\". This is basically equivalent to telling someone to share a packet of ketchup among 3 individuals. How dare you, we are paying for our food, and we are asking for a simple item.\\n4. Our actual waitress never checked in on us, and at one point, we actual had to get up from our table to request an extra condiment for our order.\\n5. They messed up our bill when checking out. Even though we told them correctly our orders, they supposedly screwed up on the charging. However, they informed us of this after we already paid. She actual came to our table when we were leaving, asking for another dollar because she charged the wrong dish to friend B. I understand mistakes happen, but she had the audacity to tell friend A that she can pay the difference back to friend B.

I must say, this was one of the MOST PERFECTLY PACED multi-course meal I've ever had. Side note: Hitachino beers are cheaper here than at most craft beer bars around town. They're $8 per serving and they also carry the red ale with the white ale. We got there around 7:30pm or so and it was not too busy for a Friday. We were seated promptly at the sushi bar and offered hot towels. We got around to ordering fairly quickly and the chef asked us if there was anything we don't like or have to avoid. The mister had some serious health issues lately and so he didn't want any fried things or spicy things lest it upset his stomach (he just had a big bout of stomach stuff happen last week). I am not a big mackerel fan unless it's steeped in salt and made into a mackerel prosciutto (a real thing at another well-known sushi/sashimi establishment around town) or just grilled. The course consisted of 11 dishes (it was more than worth the money) and we were served the following: Mozuku or Okinawan Seaweed in cold broth with quail yolk - In my ravenous hunger, I forgot to take a photo before popping my yolk open to mix it together. The seaweed threads reminded me of buckwheat noodles and it was pretty fun eating it. Very slimy though and I was grateful for a small portion. I really would've liked a crunchy aspect as it was really hard to eat due to the texture. Taste was 10/10 though. Kampachi (yellowtail in ponzu sauce with serrano peppers on top) - This dish is always one of my top faves. I would have to say this was the best kampachi I've had in a very long time. Yellowtail was buttery and slightly firm and the ponzu sauce had an even balance of yuzu to lighten the flavor. Tuna tataki - Instead of pan fried garlic, we got I believe pea shoots (maybe? someone correct me if they see a different green on top of my photos), no sriracha and instead, some black pepper. Honestly, I'd eat this version over the one advertised in the menu. I'm not a huge fan of maguro but it had an almost butter like texture that was well complemented with the greens, pepper, and light touch of ponzu. Jellyfish something? - I couldn't hear chef very well and I think I heard jellyfish. I wasn't entirely sold that this was jellyfish as I've had a lot of jellyfish in my life and it's more of a soft but a rubbery crunch rather than this crisp crunch that you get. It was nonetheless very good. Truffle aioli fresh salmon - So, their salmon quality was off the chain last night. This was easily the best sashimi quality salmon I've had in a VERY LONG TIME. It was buttery and it almost felt like foie gras in my mouth. It had a very luxurious mouth feel and taste was out of the world. Small sashimi platter - We received chu-toro, sea bream, red snapper, salmon (yaaaaas), and some fresh sea scallops. I was surprised that red snapper was my favorite over the chu-toro as I'm a toro killer. The red snapper was served with a dollop of sriracha and fresh scallions. Small nigiri platter #1 - We were instructed to eat from left to right. I believe it was sea bream with freshly grated wasabi with some soy sauce, otoro with a jalapeno on top, and a lime zest and juice poured yellowtail. It was just absolutely perfect. Otoro melts like butter in your mouth and it absolutely my favorite cut of tuna (I mean... it is king fatty tuna after all). Small nigiri platter #2 - All nigiri were torched (and this is like a big thing now in Korea and my friends have been raving about \\"fire nigiri sushi\\") and it went from amaebi or sweet shrimp with a fried shrimp head, torched yellowtail with lemon slice, and torched wagyu beef with scallions. Mister raved about the yellowtail. I normally HATE any raw shrimp but due to the light torching and the sweetness it was really good. We also normally don't eat shrimp heads but man, I think I'll start as it was very umami and buttery. Wagyu, need I say more? Rare steak on top of perfect sushi rice. Chilean seabass with oshinko (soy sauce pickles) - a little overdone for my taste but excellent nonetheless. Very large piece of fish as well (about the size of my hand and due to my very long fingers, my hand is fairly long). Duck breat with miso yaki - unnnnnngh, most perfect duck I've had in a while. Medium rare with just a bit of umami from the miso and just a bit of perfect salt. It sat on top of a stone heater that kept the duck at a perfect temperature throughout. Mochi ice cream - I felt like this is where the meal could've really shone with a yuzu sorbet instead of mochi ice cream. Felt like a clean palette cleanser would've been better than something that was this heavy. All in all, fantastic experience and I'm glad it's a hop and a skip away from our place."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I did not expect this brunch place to be buffet.

The hostess, a petite female with heavy makeup and piercings, was smiling and cheerful when seating the group in front of us.

My girlfriends and I attempted to ask for seating for our party of 5 as the last of us trailed in but she was dismissive, seemingly looking for the males in our group to speak to over us. By that point I was highly annoyed. However, everyone else from that point was very professional and friendly. As for the food. I ordered the salmon with a baked potato and my husband ordered the ribs and grits. I have no complaints about the food! The salmon came with this sweet/spicy vegatable topping that was like nothing I'd had before. So good. I also tasted the grits...it's different.

The drinks and food are pretty good, but the servers aren't always polite. While I was waiting for a table before a game the other night I attempted to get a drink from the bar. The bar, however, was about 3-4 people deep in almost every direction, so I tried to precariously stand behind the guy who was sitting to the left of one of the service stations, and leaning or stepping forward whenever the bartender was asking me a question about my drink, etc. Meanwhile, my co-worker was standing a couple feet back from the bar and about 2 1/2 ft away from me on the opposite side of the service station, to make a clear path. A girl with a snake tattoo on her forearm walked by and told us not to block the service station. We weren't blocking it, we were both well aware we should not block it and were back and off to the side, but she just kept on walking. About 4 minutes later, after a couple of other servers had come and go without issue or complaint to our positions, I had received my drink and the bartender put my receipt, pen, and credit card on the actual service station, and although I was anxious about blocking someone (I've worked in my share of restaurants), I knew it would only take 30 seconds to sign and tip. But wouldn't you know, that same server with the snake tattoo and dark hair walked by just at the right moment and actually put her hands on me, lightly pushing me towards the guy sitting to my left, saying \\"I told you not to block this station!\\" and then walked off before I could even react to having been pushed and scolded like a child. She didn't push me hard, but to have her put her hands on me at all like that was out of line. The funny thing was, she didn't pick up any drinks, and when I finished signing the receipt and turned around, there was no one waiting to access the station. So, she did it just for the satisfaction of being able to scold a customer. Sometimes people working in service positions will have a building up of resentment towards their customers, and being able to tell them they're not allowed to do something feels good. I get it. I had the satisfaction of telling a few people they had to put their shoes back on and take their feet off the table in front of the fireplace during my career in food service. But believe me, I was nice about it, and never physically pushed a customer."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing!

You really don't need to add much to it...and probably shouldn't.

Considering how awful the service is, I imagine the owner does not either.We were \\"seated\\" by a very unfriendly, very oddly behaving hostess who did her duty by pointing across the restaurant and saying, (more like curtly grumbling), \\"that two-top over there\\". She did not hand us menus. She did not bring us menus (ever). Just pointed and grunted. We were surprised she didn't snap her fingers like a dog trainer.So we went. And we sat. And we sat...And we sat...For at least 17 minutes we sat... With nothing. Not a drink. Not a request for a drink order. Not a piece of bread. Not a single greeting or even a telepathic acknowledgment from a server. Or even a busboy. Not even a menu. Well, actually we did get menus, But only after waiting 15 minutes in exile then getting up and asking for some menus. Only after this did anyone bother to slam down a carafe of water on our table (without saying a word).There's really nothing desirable or pleasurable about dining out at a restaurant with such abysmally horrendous service. So after about 17 minutes we got up and walked out. We heard a server asking the hostess about our empty table and where we had gone, literally as we were walking right in front them on our way out the door. That's how attentive these morons were.  After we sat at the table for over 17 minutes and we were standing, literally, less than a foot in front of them, they didn't even know we were the ones sitting at the table.We should have known. The owner's response to heavy business is not to handle the guests that his/her small kitchen is capable of and take good care of his/her guests. It is to add more tables. As many tables as can fit on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. Then add some more down the sidewalk in front of the business next door.  Where the sidewalk is dark and tables are crowded by random patrons milling around waiting for a table. They could choose to have an appropriate amount of seats at their restaurant. They could choose to properly train their staff to be at least minimally competent at their jobs. They could choose to do any one of many things that make dining our worthwhile and pleasurable.

Especially at a location where there's a strip club right next door? I was willing to overlook the sleazy location and trust the ratings on yelp (big mistake) to give this place a try. But I can really care less if they served the best quality meat in the whole world grilled over wood-fire with a limited number of side dishes (5-6 total) and horrible services like this one, because I ain't going back. Ever. Wish I could give this place zero stars.When our group of six people entered the restaurant, not one worker greeted us - instead, one stared at us and waited for me to announce that we need a table for six. She merely pointed at one of the rooms nearby, which was very dimly lit (turn some lights on, this isn't a fancy Italian restaurant). I let this one slide since Korean restaurants aren't known for their customer service in general. Maybe we got unlucky and got the worst server there, but this lady had some attitude. We ordered different types of meat (galbi, bulgogi, pork) to grill at the table, thinking that we could actually grill it ourselves. Once the meat arrives, our server lady puts it on the grill that has not been fully heated from their oh-so-wonderful charcoal. Aren't you the smart one? Then she takes away the tongs from our table and places it on a cart outside our room. Thinking that this was odd, we took the tongs back into our room to grill the meat ourselves. Guess what happened next? She comes back into our room, snapping that she should do it herself so that meat will cook faster before the fire dies. The galbi she had grilled was clearly undone. Please don't ever try to food poison your customers so that you could cook the meat faster before the charcoal runs out because you are too lazy to replace the charcoal. If the fire from charcoal dies, you replace it. That's your job. So we politely requested that we would like to grill the meat ourselves at our own pace (can't believe we even had to ask). This request was eventually made (after snapping at us about how she can do it better than us) and the fire had to be replaced after a short while. She gave us only one set of side dishes for six people, so we made her refill it at least five times. The meat itself was fine. But EVERYTHING else was just terrible - location, atmosphere, service, side dishes, etc. We should've just went down the street to Cho Sun Ok instead.

It is a bit disappointing that they can't seem to find a good buttermilk batter. I recommend trying the seasonal or a flavored batter.They do have other things on the menu, but we've only had the pancakes and some sides. We usually get some scrambled eggs and breakfast potatoes. It's nice to have a few sides to munch on while your pancakes cook. They also offer a ton of mix ins and toppings for your pancakes.

Located at the heart of Gastown, Coquille focuses on¬†quintessential seafood and shellfish dishes. This year, it joins the Dine Out Vancouver and offers an extensive menu for locals and visitors to try. And recently, I won a giveaway of $100 gift card for Coquille from Tourism Vancouver. Therefore, we decided to visit this restaurant to enjoy our first ever dine out of the year.Coquille has a simple and elegant store front, with a historic flavor from the lights in Gastown. It is a spacious restaurant, with comfortable seating and a bar, where diners can enjoy a sip or two. Although it is a high end restaurant, it has a rather relaxing ambiance, with an aesthetic view of Gastown surrounding the restaurant.Though Coquille is only serving the dine out menu during the festival, we were amazed by the wide selection of appetizers (including oysters), entrees, and desserts that we can choose from. Unfortunately, the overall dining experience was quite disappointing, due to the quality of the seafood and the dish itself.For the appetizers, we chose Mussels Steamed with Cider and Coquille Ceviche. Coquille Ceviche features whitefish, shrimp, and octopus, with a garnish of citrus and red onion to elevate the dish's flavor. It also pairs with some chips on the side to balance the acidic flavor. I usually love how refreshing ceviche is, with the hint of acidity. However, this dish was not my cup of tea. The citrus flavor was overpowering the dish, and I couldn't taste the freshness from the seafood. It was very sour that I had to put down my spoon and stop from eating. Mussels on the other hand was a warm and hearty dish, but the mussels were fishy and overcooked.As for the entrees, we decided to Roast Scallops and Bouillabaisse. Due to the strong acidity from the appetizer, I sticked with a soup-based entree, bouillabaisse. This dish features fish, shrimp, scallops, clams, and mussels, with crouton rouille. For both of the entrees, the scallops were undercooked, with a cold and raw center. The chef remade the dishes for us, and the squash gnocchi was quite delightful. Unfortunately for the bouillabaisse, as there were a lot of elements in the plate, not all ingredients were cooked perfectly. Though the shellfish was cooked perfectly this time, the fishiness remained. The fish was overcooked as well. The stew was seasoned perfectly, and I really like the shrimp and the crouton.Lastly, we chose Baked Rice Pudding and Soft Serve Sundae for our desserts. For the sundae, diners may choose among vanilla, strawberry, or swirl for the soft serve, with a choice of brownie and hot fudge or strawberries and jasmine shortbread. I liked the rice pudding, as it was subtle and not too sweet, just perfect for me. Sundae was not too special, but I really like the simple garnish of jasmine shortbread crumbles.Overall ImpressionI was quite disappointed with my first dine out at Coquille Restaurant this year. As a high end seafood restaurant, I would expect all ingredients (at least the seafood) are fresh and prepared perfectly. Unfortunately, we could not agree to that. They gave us a coupon of BOGO entree for lunch or dinner, so maybe I might return to try again when the regular service resumes.¬†Taste : 2.5/5¬†* Service: 3.5/5¬†* Ambiance: 4.5/5¬†* Quality-Price: 2.5/5"},{"name":"Jolly Roger","address":"1340 S E 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great little find.

Let me explain:I have tried four times to come here- weekend nights, weekday afternoons, everything. Each time it was packed.  So, I gave it one last shot.  And, they put me to shame and forced me into a five star review.  The service was great from host to server to manager (more on that).  Yes. It's busy. Yes you'll probably need to wait. But once you sit down you know why. The place is busy in a good way: the food is delicious and although there are some indulgent choices you don't feel like you need to do more cardio just because you chose 110 Grill. Now- an interesting twist- this place is super allergen conscious.  To the point where if a member of your party has an allergy, a manager will oversee the preparation and serve the meal/entree themselves.  Truly a considerate protocol.  I am allergic to nuts (not very sensitive) but the staff didn't make it a big deal and there was special attention to the food. The servers have always been fun, helpful and responsive.

The champagne complemented the flavor of the oysters beautifully and I will admit I'm not an expert on oysters but these tasted like they had been caught that day! But the real star was the main dish: the lobster roe pasta. An impressive size and a modest price with an impeccable presentation. There was not a single ingredient I could think of to add (or remove for that matter) to this dish. It was truly a masterpiece of flavor and presentation, the vegetables were perfectly cooked, the sauce was unbelievable, everything a perfect 5/5. The only negative thing I can say was that my server was very short with me and seemingly in a hurry (even though they just opened for dinner and there weren't many people) and I had a lot of questions I wasn't able to ask.

This is my second time at Rudy's, my first being in Houston. It is a different type of way to serve BBQ where you go up to a counter and order like a cafeteria style. You get a crate of food and some wax paper for plates. There are bench style tables inside and outside to enjoy your food on. The winner of all foods is the moist brisket. So moist and juicy, my mouth is salivating even thinking about it. Perfectly done. The ribs were decent and flavorful. The jalepeno sausage had a nice kick of flavor. For sides, I love love cream corn. You don't see this item at many if any other BBQ places. The potato salad and coslaw was decent too. Ask for as many pieces of bread you want too. I would not really recommend the beans, they were a bit too watered down. There is BBQ sauce you pour yourself by the cupful. I enjoyed this meal immensely and was way too full when we were done.

Let the worker know what meat you want and how much, and they'll get the meat cut on the spot and weigh it for you. You can let them know if you want a little more/less! If you're unsure of what meat you want, they also let you sample!! The workers are SO friendly I got so much love for the service here. Sides like coleslaw and potato salad will be on the left side of the counter in the refrigerated section. If you want other sides like creamed corn let the worker know and they will bring it for you. And ALWAYS ask for white bread it's gonna change your whole existence. If in doubt get more white bread at the time you're ordering since it's hard to go get more when you're midway through your meal.Once you're all set up, the worker will pack your items into a crate with some wax paper which will be your table cloth. Head over to grab some onions, pickles, bbq sauce, and utensils. They also have a handwashing station. After this settle in for a feast :')You MUST hit that brisket when you're here. I also enjoyed the St. Louis ribs but they were secondary because I'm more about the brisket. The brisket reaches its final form when you make it into a sandwich. I put a ton of pickles/onions/sauce on the brisket in the sandwich and the elements all come together so beautifully. I miss it so much :( THE CREAMED CORN THOUGH!!!! It is just perfect in between bites of brisket sandwich. I love the sweetness of it and how it is hot!! Must order. The coleslaw is more of a nice to have that I sometimes include in the sandwiches.

Me, I always have trouble deciding but the lady who greets you at the counter (Christina) was so happy and ready to help me out with the menu and immediately asked if it was my first time and I said YES! So what you do first is decide which meatball you would like, from traditional to Reuben to vegetarian all the way to the lamb meatball, yes lamb folks! Then you choose a sauce, roasted tomato, pesto, creamy provolone, marsala, and spicy pork. Lastly you choose a side, ranging from creamy polenta, penne pasta WITH gluten free option available, shoppe focaccia, and white bean ragout. After some thinking I told myself ok, I'm gonna just go through the menu in order screw it. So today I started off with the Nonna's Traditional Italian meatballs, with the roasted tomato sauce, on a bed of penne pasta.It was FANTASTIC! It was soooooooo good the tomato sauce tasted amazing beautifully rich and hearty tomato sauce I was in heaven with every bite. The penne perfectly al dente, and the plate comes with an arugula salad called 'Shoppe salad' and a piece of focaccia. Even the salad was to die for I absolutely loved it, and everything else on my plate. The meatballs were fabulous! Amazing texture and flavor that would never fall apart on you. I can't wait to come again! Which will probably be tomorrow thanks to me living 3 mins away! One quick last thing, the fabulous owner knew it was my first time and let me try something new which is both gluten free AND vegan, it was a beautiful quinoa avocado cucumber salad.

From the footage, my wife and I figured they were on Lake Underhill, just off of Goldenrod; and, decided to stop in on Saturday.  We got there just before 2:00 PM, figuring we'd missed the lunch rush; and, at first, it seemed that we had.There were just a few people ahead of us, which gave us time to figure out the menu.  I ordered the Stoppe Triad, which is three meatballs (your choice of 3) served on top of pasta or polenta (I tried the Penne Pasta), with sauce.  My wife ordered the Stoppe Trio, which is three of the same meatballs, served in a similar manner.  She opted for Polenta, with no sauce.   Both dishes were served with a Stoppe Salad.After ordering and finding a seat out front, the place was absolutely mobbed, with a line out the door.  One of the servers asked everyone to line up down the hall, so as not to disturb the diners, which I sincerely appreciated.  Three people worked the line until everyone was taken care of; and, a dining room in the back provided much-needed seating.My three meatballs included the Lamb Meatball, Spicy Pork Meatball; and, Nonna's Traditional.  My wife opted for three of Nonna's Traditional.  Nonna's Traditional Meatball is a very good meatball, firm but fluffy, moist; and, served in a tasty tomato sauce.  The Lamb Meatball was a bit denser, very flavorful; and, served with a tzatziki sauce packed with Mediterranean spices.  The Spicy Pork was quite light, not too spicy; and, served with a spicy tomato sauce.For dessert, my wife opted for the Cannoli, which she said was one of the best she ever had; and, I had the Rum Balls (a bit pricey; but, 3 to a serving; and, I took two home!)My only complaint; and, this is because my chemotherapy has rendered me immunocompromised.  During the rush, two salads were left on the counter, over which servers passed food, patrons were placing orders, and money was exchanged to settle up checks.  This absolutely horrified me; and, I would have refused them if they had been presented to me.

It's a really cozy place, much more sit down friendly than the gastown place but the menu isn't much different. The waiter was also really nice and the outdoor patio was heated really well for how chilly it was that afternoon.I ordered the Souvlaki Platter ($32) which came with four skewers and an assortment of delicious vegetables. The vegetables were cooked in just the right amount of olive oil and the rice bedding was a nice cushion to  the dish. Out of the four skewers (shrimp, chicken, pork, salmon), salmon was the most unique tasting but chicken was my favorite. The salmon had a firm outside but nice flakey inside, and the chicken had a nice lemon touch to the olive oil coated skin.Overall, this is a solid spot to take anyone out in gastown. The meal wasn't jawdropping, but damn I was satisfied going home with a full stomach and a memorable dish satiating my brain. I'd rate this a strong 4/5 advising them to come up with a few more unique dishes to add to their menu."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Some of the best oysters I've ever had in my life.

I tried both the Dry-Aged Beef and the Greek Lamb burgers.Dry-Aged Beef: the patty was WAY over cooked, and because of it, had little flavor. BBQ sauce was good but that's the extent of it. Cheese and bacon hardly had any taste. Bacon was two small, paper thin pieces. Onion ring was ok. I'd rather eat a Western Bacon Cheeseburger from the national burger chain than this burger, and save a few bucks to do so. Greek Lamb: Another over cooked patty. Lettuce and tomato was just gross and didn't seem fresh at all. You get 10x better lettuce and tomato on Shake Shack or In 'n Out burgers. Not much flavor for this burger largely because it was over cooked. I was expecting a flavor similar to a gyro, but it was not to be. Was hoping for so much more from this place.

Due to their excellent frying skills, the avocado kept its shape and was not greasy.  The pablano ranch that accompanied the taco was more than tasty -- a perfect match, with its cool ranch flavor and an added kick of heat!  This is one of the few places that actually seasons their beans, a nice surprise to my dinning partner and I.  We could see further tastiness behind the counter, where the employees were roasting tomatoes and peppers, mmm, talk about really bringing out the flavor.  Tasty; so tasty that my dinning partner claimed it was one of the best burritos he has had thus far.Original:  While in some ways, it looks like a Chipotle & Freebirds put together, Torchy's has it's own energy and flair.  They offer a decent variety of tacos, all of which can be customized.  I haven't come across this type of variety anywhere else.  This is a perfect example of the originality you find in Austin.Roomy:  Yes!  My little personal bubble remained in tact.  There is plenty of indoor and outdoor (with umbrella covered tables) seating.  Unlike other locations, there were plenty of tables, that weren't all scrunched together.  There was also a nice bench located near but out of the way of the ordering counter for individuals to wait on to-go orders.  Awesome job with this one Torchy's, now the to-go people don't take up tables for those dinning in, nor do they feel like they are standing in the way.Creative:  Their menu boasted of a nice variety of creative combinations.  Freebirds and Chipotle don't even come close to Torchy's creativity.  This creativity was also displayed through Torchy's wall art.  The wall by the sodas, was covered in brightly colored roses.  Another wall offered a nice plasma screen tv, with metal and rose covered wings.  Bright and super cool artwork, with different shapes and colors, hung from the center of the ceiling.  The multi-colored words on their menu was fun to read and added even more brightness to the area, and was actually helpful.Helpful:  The staff are very helpful.  Although my taco came in a corn tortilla (which was highlighted on the menu by being written in a different color than the other ingredients of the taco), the guy made sure I knew that it came on a corn and actually recommended that I do flour instead.  As a flour lover, I was more than happy to take his suggestion.  He was also helpful with describing and recommending which salsas/sauces work best for a particular order.  This place is so customer friendly, that they provided a take-home-your-leftovers area, equipped with all the necessities to pack up your food without having to fight for someone's attention behind the counter to bring you those materials.Yelpalicious:  For all the above reasons and more, Torchy's is totally yelpalicious.  It is a great Austin original, but this location in particular was the nicest I've been too.  The food -- awesome.  Prices -- affordable.  Definitely a place every Yelper should check out.Super:  When I left, I was showing off a nice smile.

Maybe the locals like it but I thought it didn't belong. The chicken fried rice was ok. It was fresh and moist but lacked little veggie pieces I'm used to seeing. Not a big variety in it. I tried a curry and the sauce was thick and a good flavor but I found the portion size to be on the small side. Also there were hardly any peppers etc in it. Mainly just the meat. Many things have an up charge which is annoying. The menu seems a little overpriced for what you get. Service was just ok.

HOWEVER, be sure to eat it with rice! Otherwise it's too salty (hence mixed reviews on the fish sauce wings) but if you eat it with rice it's really good! Neua Naam Tok (Flank Steak Salad): 5/5\\nThis was my favorite dish at pok pok! It's basically steak with lemongrass/mint/greens. It's small but your mouth literally explodes with all the kicks in the salad dressing. It's good to eat with rice too! Pok Pok Special: 4/5\\nThis comes with papaya salad, rice, 1/2 roasted chicken and some sauces. Chicken was okay but the sauces were pretty good and it's just nice that it comes with the rice and salad to eat with your other orders. Kung Op Wun Sen (the noodle dish): 3.5/5\\nThese noodles were nice to have with the meal but I wouldn't say it's out of this world.

The bacon was meaty and the eggs were fluffy and buttery just like I prefer! Coffee was okay. Not an extremely big plate as I was expecting from the pics I'd seen, but it did the job. Service was a little odd. A random person would bring me something and then another person would bring my brother or cousin the same thing (why not just bring 3 honey butters simultaneously to the table?)

The seating has numerous tables as well as large benches for shared seating. My one annoyance was the prices. They were a little on the high side. I spent about $12 for a chicken biscuit and coffee. They advertise many times that everything is handmade in the building, and I'm quite sure it is. I'll say this, the food is downright delicious so maybe they can justify the price. I ordered the Farmer, and it did not hold back on the flavors. Imagine infusing an apple pie w a chicken sandwich. The biscuit is so comically tall that I was forced to disassemble it and eat it w a knife and I'm quite sure you won't find a better biscuit in Orlando. I'll probably return and try the cheaper biscuit/egg combo. They have an odd system of calling out when your order is ready, instead of your name they ask for your first job... in my case, forcing a restaurant to call out \\"chick fil a\\" when my order was ready. Sorry, but you brought this on yourself.. This place is a welcome addition, but the prices mean it's less likely a place I'll go randomly for breakfast, but instead save it for a time when I want to catch up w a friend who's visiting town...Update: I just ordered the biscuits and gravy w eggs and it was a generous portion of what may have been the best gravy recipe ever. $8, seems high but considering the size of the plate and the quality I'd say it's worth it.

I got the roasted garlic and black pepper butter, and I've also heard good things about the hollondaise sauce and the bleu cheese butter. The sides were also amazing, as was the wine selection.It was dimly lit and a little loud which makes it a little hard to have a larger group there, but probably a good date place if you're ok with shelling out the dough for it..."},{"name":"Pho Dai Viet Restaurant","address":"4279 Roswell Rd NE, Ste 206","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"OK Vietnamese food for a premium price. If location is most convenient for you, then Pho Dai Viet will satisfy your Vietnamese food itch. However, if you aren't against driving to Buford Hwy, you will find much richer, tastier Vietnamese food there.I ordered the spring rolls (2 for $5) which were okay. They weren't great by all means because there weren't any herbs in it. Next up was the medium pho (~$12). The pho itself was good. Nothing blew me away but definitely hit the spot.The decor is AMAZING. Very nice looking restaurant with a very clean modern vibe. There are lots of window for natural daylight and the menu is designed beautifully.Parking is ample since they're located in a strip mall.I will come back if I'm in the area and can't make it to Buford Hwy."},{"name":"Counter Culture","address":"2337 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Counter Culture is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Austin.

We drove all the way in from Wimberley to come and eat. Shame on us.So we show up around dinner time and are ready to wait the dreaded hour it normally is. I'm pregnant and once that hunger nerve strikes, I would willingly eat my fist if told it was my only option. We walk in and it's actually kind of dead inside. Normally you can't find a seat to sit and you stand until someone gets up and basically catapult over them to sit. The host tells us an hour- hour thirty minutes. Ok. We'll wait. We grab our buzzer and sit down. My husband grabs us some waters and popcorn for the wait. So the hour goes by.. thirty more minutes.. twenty more minutes. Buzz. We are finally called up to go to our table. They start walking us outside. Oops, forgot to tell us that was our only option for the evening. I wore some flats because my feet are swollen and wasn't really equipped to be cold but whatever! I just wanted some good food. As we walked into the tent they had up it felt mildly warm so I got excited.. Until they took us to the farthest table in the corner of the room which was freezing.Since we can't drink right now.. :( The waiter brings us two waters and we were ready to order because we just had two hours to look at a menu. The food comes out and it's pretty under-cooked but I was so ready to eat that I didn't care. We both have worked service industry for several years and would never send anything back. We've eaten the wrong dish more times than I can count with my fingers.Our waiter was alright.. Not that he did anything wrong, He just didn't make us feel very welcomed. He recognized I was really cold but laughed and said, wish I could turn on a heater but no can do. Thanks, dude. I ended up sitting with my feet in my husbands lap.. You probably could have broken off my toes. I did find the candle on the table to be helpful so I could feel my fingers. I'm sure not everyone was cold but the tent was unzipped in our section so the cold breeze can't blowing in. This used to be my favorite restaurant on the planet.."},{"name":"Ford's Garage","address":"3210 Margaritaville Blvd","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4","text":"Tried the Meatloaf this time.

Ended up ordering another lb. of crawfish and my husband ordered more muscles and shrimp. Had been to other restaurants in area and they didn't compare. The portions also seem bigger than the others around. The muscles and shrimp were a great size and very fresh.

It's these reviews and a great write-up on DD that made us stop here on a whim on a Saturday night.  I unfortunately had a horrible experience from start to finish.  The experience was so unpleasant from the moment we walked in the door to the moment that we left our table, that we didn't get beyond trying to order our food.  So, this review has no reflection on the quality of the cuisine, because due to the abysmal service, we never made it that far.Let's see....we walked in and the waiter (a thin, white male about 5'7' with a graying top knot) acknowledged our presence.  He did not greet us with a smile, there was no sense of being welcomed.  It appeared that we were bothering him.  We gave him our name and then stepped out on the deck to wait.  Once we were seated, I informed him that I have a milk allergy and therefore couldn't have anything with milk or butter.  He replied incredulously that, \\"EVERYTHING here has butter.\\"  I asked if they could cook the fish in olive oil instead of butter.  He said, \\"I'll see\\". I told him that he didn't seem very enthusiastic.  He told me, \\"It's your dinner, not mine.\\"  I asked if I could sub the peach cornbread for potatoes or rice, because I knew that the cornbread would certainly contain milk and he said disdainfully, \\"There will be no cheffing\\". At that point, I told my husband that I would not be eating there and we stood up to leave this fine establishment.  As we gathered our things to leave, instead of an apology, he said, \\"What?! You asked for no butter.  I'll get you no butter.\\"I have never gone to a restaurant and felt so unwelcomed.  I've never gotten up and walked out of a restaurant.  I've never been spoken to by a waiter like that.  Both my husband and I were very friendly from the beginning.  The waiter however was extremely distant, rude and clearly not happy to be serving us.  My husband, who likes to give everyone the benefit of the doubt....said maybe that's just his personality, maybe he has Asperger's.  That's NOT the case because he was friendly and smiling with other people at the other table's, just not ours.I think what made this even more insulting was because it's such a tiny place, that it really is like dining in someone's home.  So, imagine walking into someone's home, who makes it abundantly clear that you were not invited to dinner.  Maybe the food is delicious, maybe this is a great spot....but just be prepared that you may not be welcomed.On a happy note....given that there are numerous restaurants in this area, my husband and I went to a different restaurant in downtown Decatur and had a great night!"},{"name":"The Bodega Fish, Chicken & Shrimp","address":"5425 Old National Hwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Good Food!!

For myself, I had the BBQ Brisket Burger with no red onions. The burger was very well cooked and delicious. The onion straws needed to be fried more, as they were slightly soggy/limp. The fries were delicious. The only other complaint I had is that my soda was only refilled once and left empty while I had 3/4 of my burger left to eat. Never refilled during my time I was eating.

The biscuits arrived before our entrees, and they were delicious clouds of fluffy biscuits paired with a divine honey butter. Upon taking my last delicious bite, I was presented with the roasted veggies and quinoa bowl I ordered. Great flavor (though way more quinoa then I could finish) and the poached eggs were cooked to perfection! The hubs ordered the salmon benedict, and it did not fail to please!

It's AT a gas station (not a truck stop or converted gas station -- it's a working gas station).Inside is a carnival atmosphere. Seriously, you stand in just like an amusement part and grab your drinks from tubs of ice while you wait. Then you get up to the counter and order by the lb.The staff were REALLY nice to us and made a big production for us as we were newbies from out of state. This included some of the tastiest BBQ samples I have ever EVER put in my mouth.Unfortunately, we had already decided what we wanted AND I found the samples confusing -- even if I WANTED to order what we sampled, I couldn't find it on their menu (board). So we just went with our 1/2 rack of baby back ribs and 1/2 lb of spicy chopped.Let me make it clear that all the food was REALLY good BBQ. And I'm going to give it 3.9 stars. And the stuff we sampled was easily worth 4.2 stars.But what we ate was NOT the best BBQ in Austin (as their Yelp rating would have you believe). And Rudy's sauce is just so much vinegar w/ some other stuff added in.

They don't take reservations either or take your name down--you pretty much have to do it the old fashion way and wait in a line for your turn. I promise you, the wait will be well worth it! Once we got in, we were served bread with butter. The restaurant doesn't have paper menus either, but they have a chalk board with all of the pastas and appetizers available that day. We walked in knowing that we wanted to try the squid ink aglio olio, and we were absolutely blown away by the pasta! From first bite, I loved the perfectly al dente texture of the squid ink pasta and the fragrant, saut√©ed garlic aroma. The ground squid inside the dish tasted almost like a squid pesto, and I literally wanted to spread it on bread with the olive oil and the garlic. We also got the mussels siciliano as an appetizer and they were good too, with a fragrant lemon aroma and very simple ingredients. This place is honestly a huge hassle to eat at, but trust me, the homestyle feel of this place will be well worth any wait.

We waited about 15 minutes by the counter PATIENTLY and nobody entered the restaurant at this time.  Finally the woman behind the counter told us that the table by the window is \\"AVAILABlE\\" for us NOW!  YEAH, we got our table finally.  But at the same time THE MAN IN CHARGE asked a guest who sat at a table by herself to move to the table by the window.  OMG!  We arrived at the same table at the same time.  We looked at each other, then we decided to give her the table take her previous table in stead.  It's my birthday and I just wanted to ENJOY a good meal with my friends.   Guess what happened next?  THE MAN IN CHARGE showed up and asked us to move to the table next to that lady after we all sat down started browsing our menu.  He started taking our water, so I guessed we HAD TO MOVE NOW or we won't have water to drink??  FINE, it's my birthday and my friends told me that they are ok to move to another table, which is in the CENTER of this restaurant.  FINE!!  It's my birthday and I don't want to fight with ANYBODY over a TABLE!!  Then, the most ridiculous thing happened.  We wanted to order one dinner combo to try their famous noodle and wonton along with other seafood dishes that we came here for.  The waiter simply told us that because they are BUSY (still 5 tables vacant), so they cannot sell the dinner combo to us.  We asked if the dinner combo was sold out, and he said NO.  They just cannot HONOR the price at this time.  So they are going to charge more if we REALLY WANT to order this combo.  UNBELIEVABLE!! At this point, we chose to leave the restaurant and told them we will never come back again.  They seemed mad too because we gave them lots of troubles....We went to Downtown Kirin instead!!  (THANK YOU, Yelp!!  We were able to secure a table at downtown Kirin because of the Yelp app). Surprisingly, the food, the service and the price at downtown Kirin was way better and cheaper than this small RUDEST restaurant.  We had a good meal and a great night in downtown Vancouver.  Again, I want to echo Geoffrey M.: \\"If you want decent food, but want to pay $$$ for the worst service ever, this is your place! \\""},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"3410 Camp Creek Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"The ridiculous chaotic way that this company handles the drive thru makes things worse!"},{"name":"Austin Tea Xchange Cafe","address":"13011 Shops Pkwy, Ste 600","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"Absolutely love this place!

Been back on a few occasions and disappointment each time. R2 ramen is never spicy anymore but I still tried to finish it (I paid for it, better finish food as an Asian American). Lack in presentation and the last time I went (a few days ago), they cheap out on corn in my ramen and other parties. Sushi served with no ginger or wasabi. Chashu bun lacked in flavor. Other appetizers I have tried this year just plain ol' suck and does not live up to its expectations. I have said in the past years that this restaurant has potential to improve itself but to me, it's slacking more and more as each year they survive. TV that has one image all day long is a waste of electricity. Servers are becoming more rude. A few days ago, I refused to sit at a table on the booth side because I can see stain on the booth seats (someone had their period perhaps) and there's no way I want stuff on my light pink dress. They gave me an attitude the whole time I was there and hopefully the servers didn't spit in my food for refusing to sit somewhere for the first time in my life at a restaurant. Good luck to the two party who came after us that day... I hope you don't have a blood stain on your ass. The only reason why I think this restaurant survive is its convenience for the locals or for those who don't know the taste of food of the world. Overall thoughts: never coming back. Officially done with this restaurant. There's a much better ramen restaurant around the corner. My cousins and my significant other don't want to give this place another try due to the lack in flavor and quality of the food Hakata Ramen serves."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This is a great Sunday brunch!

Modern style tables and seats with dimmed lighting. This restaurant seems to be pretty upscale just by looks. I am actually surprised that there is no required dress code. This is an ideal spot for a date or play dress-up with the girls. The bar is perhaps the most impressive with shelves and shelves of various hard liquors, beers, and wines. My party came here for the oysters, clam chowder, and yup, specifically the Lobster Roe Noodles! You can choose from a few oysters and clams from the bar. The price ranges depending on which one you prefer. I liked the Island Creek which has a salty aftertaste. Very tasty! It would be very helpful if they have a list of oysters and taste description as a resource. Clam Chowder is not ordinary. It comes with smoked bacon and biscuit balls. Texture of the chowder is more soup-like rather than the thick, creamy texture we are used to. I thought it was interesting and tasty since I am not a clam chowder purist. Lobster Roe Noodle was the showstopper! It was incredibly tasty with big pieces of grilled lobster tail and claws. Noodles were orange in color and tasted like tomato-basil. Braised short-ribs hidden under the noodles were so tender and so flavorful. I noticed from pictures that they use different vegetables depending on their availability. I would have loved brussel sprouts instead of the snow peas I got but it all depends on your luck. Nonetheless, it was worth the try!Service was unsatisfactory on my end. I understand that it was a busy weekend night but some things are just unforgivable, like how could you forget to serve bread without butter or olive oil; the server just dropped the bread quick before we could even ask for it and took almost thirty minutes after sitting down to take our order. To be quite frank, my overall experience is really worth 3.5 Stars but really had to round up for the impressive food."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Okay, so I'm going to tell you that ALL bookstores deserve a five-star review and we NEED to support these businesses.Now that I'm going to be a hypocrite to that last statement, here is my review.

These better be some amazingly delicious wings! Since most of the dishes were meant to be served family style, we settled for the fish sauce wings and Neua Naam Tok (steak salad). I ordered a side of their coconut rice.The wings were definitely flavorful.. maybe a little too flavorful.. to the point that it was salty. The chicken was cooked perfectly though and we still enjoyed it. After tasting the wings, my boyfriend decided he did need a side of rice to go with his meal. The wings weren't as overbearing when eaten with rice. The real winner though was the steak salad! It was seasoned just right and the beef really soaked in all the flavors and was tender. It's probably the best beef salad I've ever had! Their coconut rice was also delicious, it had just a the right hint of coconut flavor.I would definitely recommend trying this place out if you're in Portland, not for the wings but for their Neua Naam Tok (steak salad).

It's true, the books can likely be found cheaper on Amazon (meh), but isn't it more fun to buy a used book and wonder how the previous owner got it, whether or not they read it, how many avid readers' hands it's passed through, where it has traveled, and whether or not you will connect? I'm just saying, this store can be a wonderland for anyone looking for that new/used book smell who has time to kill. They have posters of plants/algae/herbs on the top floor for sale ($4) along with a rare book collection for you to peruse once you get the pass to go inside. They have lots of mugs and local items (for you to take home as souvenirs on every level. Every book genre is here, trust me. They don't always have used versions of a book, but they have many search stations available for you to search for a specific title and figure out where to find it in this multilevel maze.

Today I took my sister here for an early lunch (they opened at 11:00am today) since she is visiting for the holidays and I had been telling her about how good the ramen is. Since I was afraid there would be a line during lunch (since it's the holiday weekend), we were there about ten minutes after they opened. We were seated towards the front with a small table for two. After placing our order, I realized with two full bowls of ramen and four appetizers, the table made for two people might have been on the smaller side so I asked our waiter if we can change our seats to a bigger table (for four people) to fit all the food (the restaurant was still 80% empty and it was not busy yet). The waiter explained that they \\"don't normally seat parties of two at a bigger table because what if a big family comes in?\\" I pointed out that there was a couple towards the back of the restaurant who was enjoying their meal at a bigger table that was meant for four people. The waiter, looking flustered, looked over to another waitress who told him that she only seated them there because \\"all the small tables were taken\\" which, if you remember the time we got there (ten minutes after they opened), is false because there were two more small tables by us that were available for seating (and the couple is enjoying their food long before we placed our orders). Our waiter, after nervously muttering something, said that he \\"should probably let us switch to a bigger table now\\". (Why was it so difficult?)We got a bigger table and received our ramen way before the appetizers - the appetizers came when were almost done with our ramen. The cherry on top of this growing uncomfortable dining experience was one of the servers spilled a dish of the potato croquettes (with sauce) onto my sister's purse and coat. After this, we felt that the staff were too intimidated to approach us to ask us how things were (so while other tables had check ins from their waiters, we were basically ignored). Overall, the quality of appetizers have gone down (the pork gyozas are lukewarm and the vegetable tempura portions became smaller - and this is a dish I have ordered every time I have been there). Maybe due to the holiday weekend the manager is not in for quality control. But I was honestly embarrassed about raving about their food and service to my sister (who is from out of town), when the experience was below average and ruined her coat and purse (we were given another plate of potato croquettes as an \\"apology\\").

Mango Mango is located off Buford Hwy in Pinetree Plaza next door to ICENY ice cream. Plenty of parking spaces in the lot, but very limited number of seating in the store and they do have bar seating against the wall. Although, I would advise not going in a group of more than four.The servers there are very nice and prompt in handing you the menu. If you're looking to dine in and there's not a table available, you would have to wait to be seated. They do to-go orders but it doesn't seem like you would get the same amount and the packaging were generic plastic containers. On our first visit, we ordered the mango sundae (two scoops of mango ice cream, whip cream and a choco Pirouline stick), snow white mango juice (half mango juice & half snow white) with sago and pomelo, and a mango mille crepe to-go (I gave it to my sister to try so I didn't get a chance to taste it) because they were running a promotion where you got a free mango juice with sago in their custom Mango Mango Dessert bottle if you spent $20+. Sago is similar to tapioca, which it has the same starchy, chewy texture, but it's clear and comes from palm trees and not a root. The \\"snow white\\" juice is a coconut blended mixture. The second visit, my friend and I ordered mango juice with sago and herbal jelly, snow white mango juice with sago, pomelo and ice cream (my friend asked to get it without the pomelo but our server must've not noted that because it had pomelo in it), and a mango mille to eat there. Not sure what type of cream was used for the mango mille, but I would advise not to order it. It didn't have a mango taste and it just wasn't pleasant. I wish I would've tasted the one I got my sister before we ordered it again. On both visits, the servers were busy to get people seated, but I had to call the servers over to get our order since we sat there for awhile. It didn't take too long for our orders to come out, but I can say for both visits, the juice almost had little to no flavor in both the mango and snow white juices. Portion wise, my friend says it seems a little less than what you would get at Summer Memory Station (in Duluth off Pleasant Hill), which would be the closest comparison to what both places sell. The mangoes used did seem a little too overripe, but still worked with the desserts. I wouldn't hype this place up too much but I would want to come back to try other things on the menu because some of their other dessert options remind me of certain things I've gotten in China & Taiwan."},{"name":"Joe's 320 Cafe","address":"320 Spring St W Roxbury","city":"West Roxbury","stars":"4.5","text":"Yummy fresh food for breakfast or lunch.

Hope was shattered 10 minutes into their set when four dudes planted themselves in front of me and all lit up their cigs.  No problem, we'll move.

Not to sound condescending to the young folk, BUT some people like to go and LISTEN to the actual music.  There was PLENTY of bar to go have your conversation.  About 30 minutes in, when we didn't want to fight our way to the front of the stage so we could actually hear, we left.  The tickets were $15 each, so not an investment.  Definitely a huge fan of the Futurebirds and want to see them live again, but I DO NOT recommend this \\"venue\\" for live music unless you fight your way to the front of the crowd directly in front of the stage.

We were quickly seated at a large table (opt for another table if you go - there will not be room for several people to comfortably make pancakes). The decor is cute - modern, lots of orange chairs, long benches, artwork. They were blasting some James Brown, which is A-Okay in my book.We were served quickly, and given the scoop on how things work - most of us opted for the buttermilk pancake batter, which comes in an 8 oz. squeeze bottle. It was very good - you have many choices for mix-ins. Desmond opted for bacon crumbles (a boy after my own heart!). Owen chose the pancake batter with pumpkin - I tried it & it was good - not too spicy, but with a decent kick. The Big Man & I chose some buttermilk batter with an add on of satsuma ginger marmalade - it was unusually good! We also split a Classic Breakfast - 2 scrambled eggs, 2 slices of bacon, some fried potatoes (not great) and what is possibly the world's smallest English muffin - picture the tiny 'silver-dollar-sized pancakes', now transform that to a hocky puck-sized English muffin. As The Big Man said,\\"LA sized portions?? In Portland??!\\"So the English muffin left something to be desired. Everything else was good. It became very crowded, with our server buzzing around, asking if we were finished (3 times). It was time to go, yet I don't think we were lingering - just wanted to finish what was on our plates. Would I return??  Well, let me just say that this is NOT a Pancake Breakfast. This is more like pancake tapas .  If I want pancakes, there are many options in PDX. If I want tapas, I would go elsewhere. It is pretty unlikely I will be ordering tiny pancakes and liquor in the same meal. Worth checking out if you simply must have pancakes & you like to make 'em yourself...but not in your own kitchen, and you don't like to clean up the mess and you want the option of mixed drinks at 8:00 a.m. Go...see for yourselves.

Portions are perfect - lots of great pasta choices, excellent bruschetta, excellent charcuterie with the best fava beans around, delicious green salad with a great olive oil and vinegar dressing. The dally specials are always good choices and if they have ravioli of any kind - order it! Last night was spinach filled with a combination of proscuitto and mortadella in a mild tomato sauce. One of the fun staff makes the ravioli and he does a fabulous job. We finished with tiramasu tres leche - divine comes to mind. The staff are really nice and friendly and always have a smile for you. You ofter hear them speaking Italian and it just adds to the whole atmosphere. Make sure you call for a booking but if they can they will fit you in if possible and you can wait while sipping on a prosecco. There are tables outside if the weather is nice.

Service has always been great. They're prompt and nice. The reason this restaurant isn't getting the four stars that I'd give it for dine-in service is that both times I took an order for carry out I discovered a hair in my pad thai. The first time I chalked it up to an accident. The second time I decided it must be a quality-control issue. It's completely gross and makes the whole dish unpalatable since who knows how long that hair was being tossed around in the pad thai while I carried it to my apartment.

I had the combo fajitas (chicken and steak) and they were absolutely delicious. The portions are huge and extremely flavorful. I went back on a Thursday night with my boyfriend, we sat at the bar and this time was served by Omar. Omar was fantastic! We ordered the pulled chicken taquitos as an app, for something so simple they were full of flavor. For our meals we had the chicken,steak and shrimp fajitas with an extra order of corn tortillas and  also had the empanadas (appetizer) one chicken one beef. The fajitas are just absolutely amazing, everything is so fresh and full of flavor. The empanadas were delicious, I would recommend the chicken.A must try is their house made hot sauce. IT IS AMAZING! It has a nice heat to it and complements the flavors of their food. If they sold bottles of it we would have bought some to bring home.I will be recommending this place to everyone.

The Kung Op Wun Sen, as well, was quite delicious, especially the bean thread noodles.One of the servers/hosts/employees helped us quite a bit with ordering, and made some great recommendations, including the KOWS.The peanut sauce was amazing and you should always order a side of it. Like: if you're reading this right now, and you're near Pok Pok, just go and order some peanut sauce. It's important. The not-so-good:Our server made mention of a missing sauce (the pic shows two, when there should be three) with our Kai Yaang and said she would bring it. She never came back, even to check in. Also, though this is family style and prices as such, the portions were not family sized. We ordered two dishes, peanut sauce, and sticky rice, and it really wasn't enough. Especially the sticky rice. A side order (no rice came with our dishes) was (I believe) $4, and it portioned out two small scoops. I would suggest ordering two sides of rice if you're eating in, and possibly one per person, depending on how hungry everyone is.All of that said, I'm super glad I tried it, and the food and atmosphere was lovely.

They advertise themselves as \\"rough-and-refined\\", which I feel is something that sounds good on paper, but could be tough to translate into the room and onto the plate.  Not the case here, they nailed it.  The room itself, which made me want to redesign my entire house, perfectly reflects the theme.  Wood, in differing shades and textures, and nothing lost in the small details (like a single placed 'brick' of honeycomb poking through the wall behind me).  They've made excellent use of the long and narrow space, with an open concept kitchen lined with barstools. The details here are what really made it for me.  Everything from the menus to the place settings and glassware were simple yet beautiful, and fit the room perfectly.  Music was great as I barely noticed it was there (in the best way possible).Service was great, friendly and fun.The cocktail list was lovely, as they've kept it small and interesting.  We tried the Vieux Bor√©al, which is a rye-based cocktail, with one of my favorite presentations I've seen yet (I wont spoil it, try it yourself), and the Marigold's Gimlet, gin based with a perfectly placed marigold flower floating on top.  Both were fantastic .  The wine list, as the server pointed out to us, is comprised of all-natural wines (a step above organic), which can seem a bit off or fizzy at first, but mellow beautifully in the glass.The food was beautifully presented and tasted very fresh.  We tried the Urban Digs Egg, the Fried Chicken and Pickles (YUM), and the Pork Belly Ramen.  Flavors were great, and the three dishes were enough to fill us up, although I would thank the ramen for that.  The ramen was a healthy sized serving, the other two dishes could have used a little more food on them.  Both were delicious though.Will definitely go back with friends to try more of the menu, or solo to have an after-work glass of wine and bowl of ramen."},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent vegan restaurant near Central Square in Cambridge.

The atmosphere is cool, with new age murals on the walls, and a young vibe. The lines are long but move quickly. The choices are myriad, each chock full of health. This time around, we ordered Demi portions of The Green Goddess and The Swami, and a couple of smoothies - Harvest Alive and Maca Malt. We found a spot in the basement, catching up on family, politics and relationships.A girl in a tie-dye shirt and rainbow streaked hair brought us our food and drinks. The Harvest Alive smoothie was my choice - I sipped it tentatively and sighed in appreciation; it was earthy and deliciously healthy. Then I tasted my cousins Maca Malt - it was a little too sweet for my taste. To each his own! We shared the Demi's - both were excellent. The Green Goddess was crunchier, full of broccoli and kale, the Swami sweeter, nuttier and grainier. No one bothered us while we ate. We chatted in peace, enjoying our food and drinks.

The amazing.  Yes it's been said.  But the Edamame dumplings.  Just.  Heavenly.  Flavors are harmonious and the truffle oil is subdued, it never takes over the whole dish.  I can say with fair certainty that the next time I dine at true food I will probably order ONLY the dumplings.  I have little desire to order anything else at this point.  Anyways, if you go here.  Get it.  This is the sole reason I'm giving this place 3 stars.The good.  The market soup.  I believe I've had a tomato basil and a butternut squash soup, 2x each.  Both were good, came out room temperature (i prefer a little hotter than that) and maybe a little too on the creamy side.  Still good though.  The brussel sprouts are also pretty standard, tend to come out mushy like they were overcooked or spent a ton of time under a heat lamp.  But I can't say they taste bad either.Cocktails and drinks.. really good also.  Top notch stuff. The not so good.  The pizza.  I just can't understand it.  No amount of work transparency will ever convince me a small individual thin crust pizza is worth $12+ as a starting price.  Sorry.  Vegan quinoa burger, didn't taste bad but for me and the other person who ordered, the thing just crumbles apart.  We ended up eating it with a fork and spoon.  One of us threw up afterwards, they weren't pregnant, they blamed the pizza, I can't say either way, just the facts.Service has gone from passable to downright rude.  The first time we dined there I think we were seated with an hour before closing, got our waters 30 minutes later, then getting our orders taken 45 minutes after being seated.  Took our orders, said it was last call, and didn't come back until giving us our check.  I've also had the salmon, grass fed burger, lasagna, spicy panang curry.. Nothing to write home about for the price. This place actually reminds me a lot like eating in Whole Foods - good healthy drinks, somewhat overpriced food.

Not because it was good but it was because it was a HUGE platter of tater tots with topping on it, something we did not order.  Most places would usually let us have it since it is their mistake but the server just took it back and we had to wait longer for our food to come out.  Not sure if it was the wait or the poor service but the food did not taste so great and we did not enjoy our meal as much as the lunch out on the patio that we had on our first visit.

For market price, the coffee here beats Starbucks and Milano any day (I like Milano a lot but the barista's consistency can vary).The barista takes real care in calibrating his shots, and it helps that the beans are roasted right on the premise-that usually says a lot about how serious the proprietors are in getting their beans taste and smell just right.This is an established neighborhood coffee shop under new younger owners. So expect to see continual changes to decor and seating while it tries to find its character. I am more in favor of coffee shops that get their core offering (the coffee) right first before getting over burden with the ambience or looks. That being said, would love to see this place succeed and attract more than than hard core coffee drinkers. A more well-defined ethos that echos target customers' identity and value and a strong visual merchandising design will likely boost popularity.

That baked potato was the best part of the dish, which is sad because its a side item, and the fried dish wasn't even the highlight.

They actually shelved along WITH the new books.. so you can actually just go look up books that you actually want and BONUS there might be a slightly cheaper used copy! No trolling through a table of unorganized used books, no luck needed at all!\\nThey also have a coffee shop attached that makes a mean mocha.

First came the chicken wings which were devoured. SO good. As the waiter said \\"those things pay my mortgage\\". Other items we liked: Mushroom salad, pork belly curry, papaya Pok Pok, Kai Yaang, glass noodles with prawns, Neua Naam Tok (Spicy AF beef). Pok Pok has some classic Asian beers as well as some really cool drinking vinegars which I recommend trying.

We love trying new vegan spots and I've heard so many great things about CC so I was super disappointed after our meal. I gave 2 stars because although the service was extremely slow, (we were there for 1.5 hours and it was pretty much completely empty) our server was really friendly and helpful. We got the artichoke dip to start and it was not good. Basically a spicy paste with no flavor and came with cold toasted wheat bread. The first piece of bread I ate was rock hard and tasted old. We ordered the special, which was a vegetable pot pie and then the breaded seitan with gravy. For the sides we got jalape√±o cornbread, potato salad, and the roasted \\"sweets and beets\\". The cornbread and sweets/beets were pretty good however the potato salad was just huge hunks of potato and had very little flavor. The pot pie, however, was disgusting. It had beans, lentils, peas and potatoes in a watery flavorless sauce with some sort of thin crispy dough on top. It had no flavor at all, other than tasting vaguely of dirt. Just sort of a soupy, weird, watery goop masquerading as a pot pie. The seitan was somehow even worse. My husband described it as lukewarm play-dough covered in bland, watery gravy. The only thing I ordered that I actually enjoyed at all was the brownie sundae and that was honestly a hail mary after a terrible meal. I hope that my experience was not the usual because I can't imagine anyone repeatedly eating here.

I went there today with a friend from one of the Macarons Francaises MeetUp Groups in Atlanta...because  we were alerted to do so and were told the macarons were \\"good.\\"We eat Macarons...every week. We travel to find good macarons  and discuss them at tea parties. We love them...but we're not \\"in love\\" with these. They are however, \\"good.\\" If you're looking for a replica of Alon's or Maison Robert, this is not it. They look the similar (a bit smaller) and though  the package says the date they were put  in the bag, I'm not sure when they were made? Same day or day before/night before -unclear.Given that there are tons of Macarons bakeries in Atlanta like the long established Alon's Bakery, Maison Robert, Doucer de France (to name a few) we were shocked that this bakery said they were the 1st in Atlanta -we want to know, 1st what? 1st Macaron supplier? or first to focus on the macarons? We're just curious.Other observations:\\n-Unlike many of the other macarons shoppes in town, these are pre-packaged/assorted macarons. You can't go up to the kiosk and say, I want 7 pistachio macarons...you  have to buy whatever is in the package. The plus  side is you get to taste several different kinds, bad side is if you want to get more of that kind you just have to buy more bags that feature those even if there are only two of the kind you want in a bag of 5 or so... but there's a plus side to even that...they do cater and take request. You just call ahead of time and arrange for them to be picked up.Also:-The  packages are very pretty...clear bags with beautiful branding.\\n-The Kiosk assistant is very nice, her name was Aja. Very beautiful young woman who  was engaging and informative.\\n-Macarons seem to be priced  at market value\\n-These are a bit smaller than the macarons at surrounding bakeries\\n-The pictures  online are much brighter and bold compared to the small kiosk in the mall, it could  use  a boost of light and celebration as these are the beloved macaron, right?\\n-The taste is subtle, the macarons' initial burst of fruit come after a few chews\\n-This macaron is a little bit drier than most, the top part is delicate and light compared to others which seem to be a bit dense and heavy to hold.\\n-Great location\\n-Great varieties"},{"name":"Jolly Roger","address":"1340 S E 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I used to like this restaurant.

The open kitchen concept is a nice layout and there is plenty of seating so yay for no wait time for a table. I mainly come here for the chicken which is always bomb but decided to also order the Little Gems dish on their specials menu during my last visit. The Little Gems dish was described to have sungold tomatoes, salted duck eggs and herbs so I figured it would be a dish centered around the duck eggs. When it came out I was disappointed to see it was more of a salad and the duck egg part of the dish was more like a small sprinkling of crumbs on top. Seems like a poor description from what was advertised on their board. The salted duck egg was barely in the dish, and the little crumbs they sprinkled on top barely added much to the salad. I'd come back here for the chicken and curries but will ask the cashier for more detailed descriptions next time I order something else."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"It always smells like fish in here.

I walked in with my spouse and the young Indian or Spanish girl didn't even look up she was too busy texting some other employee noticed it and had to say hello Red Flag number one. I should have turned around and left but yet I tried to be optimistic and give the restaurant a chance. THEN she never spoke to us she just sat us right next to a random couple we didn't even know at the hibachi table WE NEVER TOLD HER THAT WE WANTED HIBACHI. You ask customers are you eating hibachi or sushi before you seat them, so then my spouse told her \\"um we are eating sushi not hibachi so that's when she sat us at the regular table, she gave us pieces of paper to order from never said have you all ate here before? Or let us know how to order with the papers...NOTHING. That was red flag number two. Then another waitress a young black girl came over. No personality no interest in being there or serving. We should have got up and left when these things occurred but once again we were trying to give your restaurant a chance. So on to our food we order the volcano roll, Atl roll and dumplings...waitress couldn't even tell me what kind of meat was in the dumplings the black male bartender over heard her telling me the meat inside was beef but the bartender said it was pork, I was asking because I don't eat pork and I wanted to verify so after listening to them argue about it being pork or beef the bartender came over and said ma'am that is pork inside of there. The sushi was messy and sloppy it all was the same sushi with different toppings thrown on top of it, the ginger and wasabi looked like it been sitting for days as if they would just take it off a used plate and throw it on a new one, it was hard and old. The tap water tasted like mop water...this was truly disappointing for our first experience and embarrassing for a Japanese restaurant.

I have made the run out to lock hart and had Smitty's BBQ which I personally consider to be the best in Texas. I also smoke my own meats from time  to time and understand the importance of having a deeply rich smoked flavor. This is where Rudy's fails. You can get extra moist brisket, which is a good thing but all of the BBQ here is missing that super smoked flavor that BBQ just needs. I have come to suspect that they steam the brisket here and that's why its so moist. I cant give them more than two stars because they are lacking in flavor and that's the most important thing. I'm not a big fan of BBQ sauce but Rudy's sauce isn't that bad. It still has a bit too much tomato and not enough kick for me but its not that bad, just kinda mediocre. I know the same owners run mighty fine burgers which is decorated similarly. They seem to have put all their time into deciding what makes burgers taste good and just slapped together their BBQ store without even trying to make it good.

When I come in with high expectations, I usually get disappointed. This, did not. First off, they takes resos. Now you can secure a delicious meal without the worry of lines or wait. I hate waiting (I do it though lol). Secondly, the ambiance is romantic / high class but not snobby. Dim lighting, candle-lit dinner. There is a plethora of tables and a huge oyster bar with bright light shining on the oysters that wraps around the center of the restaurant. The space between tables is the perfect amount. I've had multiple experiences where tables are shoulder to shoulder to maximize party space; this was comfortable and you couldn't overhear anyone else's conversations.Service was on point. After we got seated, a waiter came by and introduced himself as our substitute waiter for the time-being because our assigned waiter was a bit too busy right now to help us. For such a large restaurant, they really have the communication down. And it wasn't like we waited a very long time before he attended to us. Between all of our courses and two rounds of oysters and drinks, we got attended to the perfect amount of times (even with the switch of waiters), and with excellent timing. I never felt rushed with my food, nor was my plate cleaned away too quickly. Lastly (and most importantly), the food. \\n- OYSTERS: We had 6 oysters, each 2 being a different kind. Our favorites, naturally,  were the farm-raised Island Creek ones. So much that we ordered another 6. They were SO JUICY and fresh - and I slurped them right up with no needed sauce or seasoning. \\n- LOBSTER ROE NOODLES: This truly lived up to its raving reviews. Lobster pieces were meaty and plenty. The short rib was tender and cooked to perfection. Noodles were al dente and not too saucy. There were small pieces of pumpkin (LOVE) that were cooked through and soft. During the moment, I thought there could be more noodles, but in hindsight, it was the perfect amount as you don't want to reflect back to these noodles with a \\"I was soooo full, ugh\\" feeling. \\n- SCALLOPS: Holy moly, these babies were uuuuge! I have tried cooking scallops at home, and just like spinach, the size before cooking is deceiving. If you don't watch how long you cook the scallops, they turn into puny little things! I am amazed at the magnitude of these scallops. Meaty, tender, and seared for the perfect amount of crunch at the top. \\n- BANAOFFEE DULCE DE LECHE PIE: I haven't had pie this memorable in a while (or as unique)! There was caramelized bananas along with regular bananas, NOT too overpowering of a flavor as the rest of the pie had a sweet creaminess and coffee flavors. The crust was also very well done. Plus, they wrote 'happy anniversary' in chocolate sauce as we had listed the special occasion through Opentable. Good service once again!\\n- APPLE CIDER DONUTS WITH CHAI TEA ICE CREAM: Yissss. 6 delicious bite sized donuts with sliced apples on the slide, and chai tea ice cream to pair with. The donuts were the perfect size since any bigger, it would be too doughy. Since my trip back, I have been recommending everyone to this place. I would come here again, fosho."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Best oysters I've ever had!

But the service, every time I've been here, is consistently disappointing. De Dutch touts their Dutch version of pancakes (pankoek), which are amazing, as all pancakes should be. I usually order the \\"Canadian\\" breakfast, but just last visit had the Classic with \\"De Bakon\\" -- which is $3 cheaper, and just means that the bacon is cooked into the pancake batter, instead of having it on the side, like the Canadian does. If it's really that big a deal to anyone, get the meal. If not, get the Classic, and it's essentially the same thing. The service however, is consistently lacking, whether or not it's busy. I almost prefer it to be busy because at least then, I can justify the lack of service. Otherwise, it doesn't really make sense to me, and becomes annoyingly noticeable. I can tell you that you'll see your waiter/waitress when they (finally) come to take your order and (sometimes) when your order is delivered to your table. On a rare occasion, they'll stop by your table to check up on you (typically only ever once during your meal, no matter how long your stay or how many people in your party), before you have to flag someone down, to flag down your waiter/waitress to pay your bill. I usually come here on my own but, have on occasion, come here with a group of co-workers, and at various times during the week... I still haven't discovered the magic time during which I might get decent service.

Just walking through the doors you see a difference from other girl and screen type theaters. Their box office is a set of computers where you can purchase tickets or y ou u can join their online rewards, order your tickets ahead and print them at one of the computers when you arrive, which is what we chose to do. They have a nice bar with seating inside and out, where you can sit and enjoy a pre or post movie drink. When it is time for.your movie to be seated they let you know so you can head to your theater. Ince there you are greeted by a server who assists you with finding your seat and then proceeds to explain how the dining service progresses throughout your movie. They also show the magic button that will summon a server if you need anything. The seats recline, sadly not far enough back so despite your feet being elevated you are still almost sitting straight up, but the seats are still comfy. Even if you dont want to dine on their delicious menu you can still order popcorn and drinks and they will be brought to your seat!\\nWe enjoyed the 2 for $29 deal which included an appetizer and 2 entrees. I had the Veggie Flat Bread and the bestie had the fajita salad. We shared a 1/2 order of chicken nachos to start. Everything was delicious. My only complaint is that its not as dark as a regular theater so people can see their food and the servers wear white shirts so it makes them extremely visible which can be a distraction when they come through the theater to assist people, while the food runners wear all black and less distracting. I do look forward to returning for future films, but saving the dining for special occasions and stick with popcorn.Enjoy!"},{"name":"Seoul Doogbaegi","address":"1031 Kingsway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"My Vancouver go to soup and rice joint.\\nNotable for their radish kimchi and yummy potato banchan.\\nGo-tos are Spicy Beef Soup and Gamjatang for two.\\nService are slow during prime hours and there is maximum only on a good day only 2 servers on the floor.\\nThis family style korean resteraunt does serve alcohol.\\nYou should call and check if they are open as sometimes they close early."},{"name":"Sweet-Stack Creamery","address":"25 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"We feel like we deserve a treat after our horrible experience going to Atlanta taco and margarita taste.

When you walk in you feel like you're down south. The music isn't mainstream but I heard some jazz notes here and there. Gave it an authentic feel! The downside was that Brighton Music Hall(?) is right next door so you could hear the bass against the wall to the point where the booths were vibrating. It didn't really bother me much but I did notice some customers were a bit peeved. My two friends and I ordered the Pick 3 combo: 3 seafood choices and two sides for $43 Louisiana style medium spicy. This was worth it because individually it was $15(17pcs) for the shrimp and $13/lbs for crawfish. We did two orders of the shrimp and one order of the crawfish. We opted for the side of garlic noodles and cajun fries. There's something about the garlic noodles that made it really addicting. I couldn't stop eating it! But if you're on a date make sure you carry some breath mints or gum because it is really, really garlic-y. Service was really good and the food came out quickly. I would say that initially I didn't think there was enough sauce in the bag. The seafood at the top were kind of lacking some sauce love so we had to do a couple of turns throughout the meal to get them coated. The size of the shrimp was pretty big (I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews). I have also tried Shaking Crab and Holly Crab. To be honest, I think I prefer Holly Crab at the moment out of the three."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Powell's books has been an invaluable resource for my research in serial killers.

We didn't have a reservation (on a busy Friday night), but they were able to accommodate us immediately. The ambiance was quite nice. However as soon as we were seated that was when things went downhill. There was another couple that arrived 10 minutes after we arrived and sat at a table next to us. They must have been regulars because immediately they got the VIP treatment. Our server was very attentive to them. So much so that it seemed she forgot about us. I kept trying to make eye contact with her so she would realize we were waiting very patiently to place our order. She was polite and friendly enough, but her lack of attentiveness really bothered me, especially considering the fact that this restaurant is on the expensive side. Now on to the food itself... we ordered raw oysters, the 1/2 Maine lobster, clam chowder, and lobster bisque. The raw oysters were fresh and delicious, as was the lobster. However the lobster bisque was quite thin and runny. The flavor was on the more bland side. It definitely needed some thickening and better seasoning to bring the lobster flavor out. The clam chowder was not bad, but it wasn't particularly anything special either. I would say the only unique thing I enjoyed about it was the fact that it had fresh, crispy bacon bits in it. I could definitely see myself going here again to give it another chance.

On a rainy Monday morning I popped in with a friend, waiting for about five minutes for one of about eight tables to open up. It smelled really yummy inside, which is a good thing, since I smelled like their food for the rest of the day. The server was very helpful, offering a half serving of biscuits and gravy so I could still have a coveted slice of coffee cake. The coffee cake flavor of the day was blackberry, which really just meant it had a couple of blackberries baked into it. I didn't really taste them, but I was in love with the texture of the cake. It was moist and chewy, almost like a macaroon or a flourless cookie. My biscuits and gravy were fine. The sausage in the gravy was real chunks, not the tiny crumbles you usually get. The meal is served with their yummy library fries, nicely seasoned and roasted, not fried. The biscuit was too dry for my liking, but I was already stuffed so was perfectly happy leaving it on the plate. The freshly brewed decaf was excellent - didn't even need cream.  Not sure why I got attitude when I tried to pay a $30 bill with a $50. I was asked if I had anything smaller. You know it's the smallest denomination that will cover the bill, right?Ok, I just read that their biscuits are made with yams.

We all ordered the coursed meal, so the waitress, Dinee, only needed to deal with our drink orders. She had a bad attitude all night, even telling us she didn't want to be there. There were a couple water bottles on the table so we could fill our own glasses, but they went dry early into the meal and were only replaced once when asked. The food was quite good, even though the server didn't know what was in each dish when asked. At the end of the meal, there was a big ordeal to get the bill split up between us. She split it up for the three couples at the table, but rather than further splitting it for the last few people, she dropped the check on the table, threw her hands in the air, and said \\"fuck it, you deal with this.\\" We had to call over the manager to further separate the bill. Because of the size of our group, though despite the terrible service, they auto-checked the 20% gratuity on all our bills. I changed it down to 15%, something I never do (my girlfriend is a server so we never go below 20%). A couple days later, I noticed on my credit card statement that they still charged me for the 20%, which I had to then deal with through the credit card company. In the end, we were out of the restaurant by about 10pm, not too late for the server to still join in on New Years festivities, but we didn't see her again after she dropped the check in a fit of rage. While the food was good, it was a terrible experience and I know that none of us will be returning to Suzette for any more meals. All of us there wished we had gone somewhere else so we could have had a better New Years experience.1/10/17 - RESPONSE TO BUSINESS OWNER:First and foremost, claiming \\"harassment for rejection of sexual advances\\" is an absurd and ridiculous response to claims of bad service. Insinuating the \\"author of this review\\" was overly sexually aggressive and can't properly form unbiased opinions about service is inappropriate and unprofessional practice from the owner of any business. For the record, I was sitting with my back to the wall at the center of the table, and two people needed to stand up just for me to get out of my chair and go to the bathroom. I was in no position to \\"grab her around the neck and shoulder, then around the waist, and finally around the waist and belly.\\" I was also not the caller, and was not made aware of the content of that discussion.Secondly, I'd like to address the drink situation. Of the 9 of us, 3 people did not drink any alcohol all night. Of those of us that did partake, we each had a maximum of two drinks, and were well aware that the servers were abiding by Oregon laws and not serving two drinks at once or over serving. We had two wine glass style bottles of water on the table, which ran dry early on into the dinner, only to be refilled once when we asked. Since we were eating a drawn out, coursed meal, having ample beverages on the table should be assumed. If it were of the preference of the wait staff that no more alcohol were to be served, inquiring about other non-alcoholic drinks would have sufficed. Leaving a table thirsty for any beverage before the meal is done, especially when we were the only table (or one of two, depending on time) is a sign of bad service in my mind.I'd like to add that since Dinee was the primary individual that we dealt with over the course of the meal, the one that asked for and brought us drinks, and the one that served us our check, I assumed she was our waitress. If she was being asked questions about the meal that she didn't know the answers, or was stepping outside of her standard roles of bartender, our actual waitress should have stepped in. Don't blame that on your customers, that's a managerial mistake. Lastly, and this is an important one, if members of your workforce see sexual misconduct in the workplace, I am under the impression that they have a duty to say something about it. Inappropriate advancements are never acceptable, especially from a customer-to-employee basis. If \\"It was witnessed by two other staff members,\\" someone should have either relieved Dinee of her position or said something directly to the table/patron. Standing by \\"as the groping became more and more brazen\\" is a pretty bold statement about your managerial incompetence and business ethics. Don't try to put that on me, the reviewer, who didn't witness any of this.After sharing my thoughts about my experience at your restaurant, I was hoping to put the experience behind me. But being specifically called out for 'harassment for rejection of sexual advances' from a business owner is a new one for me. I sincerely hope this ordeal instigates some internal discussion within your organization about how to deal with your employees as well as how to better respond to the community in which you service."},{"name":"JW Marriott Orlando, Grande Lakes","address":"4040 Central Florida Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The grounds and pool are beautiful but when we ordered a few cocktails at the pool we were completely disappointed.

Staff very attentive although their English is a bit limited (some of the waitresses, not all).  You will always see many Koreans patronizing this place, which is a great sign.

I was visiting my cousin and niece in Portland and we came here for lunch at around 11:30AM. We had two orders of their wings because almost every reviews on Yelp mentioned the wings. We would have ordered other dishes if we had other people. The wings were enough to fill us up. One order was spicy and the other not spicy so my niece could eat it. The spicy wings were supposed to be spicy. They weren't spicy at all!!! I don't expect any dumb down spicy at a thai restaurant. I'm well aware that this is fusion but still. I even got some fish sauce and chili pepper, those weren't spicy either!!!! the wings were super SALTY. I think I ate enough sodium for three days. What is the deal? The wings were one of the worse wings I ever ate. HIGHLY HYPED!!! make them crispy at least. For all six \\"natural\\" wings $15. Over priced. They didn't taste or look natural to me. Also, for $15 you could have at least give an order of rice with it! $15 for not so good chicken wings is ridiculous.

They don't have nearly enough customers to offer a buffet option.I arrived way before the end of their lunch buffet option. When we got there they were still doing the buffer but seemed like they werent going to refill any of the items on the buffet bar. There were a couple fried dumplings yoh could tell had been sitting out for a whole. Meats and etc out too looking dried out on the top and never replenished with a fresh batch. It was a horrible buffet bar. The sushi bar was good enough to satisfy my craving but the rest was a total let down.If you're not going to upkeep what you have out there on the buffet don't even offer that. Stick to what you're good at and just do sushi by the plate.

I will now list the only one good thing I can think of about this place - the live music and flamenco show. Good quality and great entertainment. Besides that everything sucks A few of us arrived way before the rest of the party. No bread or anything while we waited. Server just kept asking if we were ready to order and we kept explaining we were waiting for the rest of the party. They finally arrived and we placed our drink orders. Took forever to get first round of drinks and refills weren't any quicker. I first ordered patatas bravas with sauce on side and arroz con pimientos. First the potatoes came with sauce on top and had to be made. Next came the arroz and for the first time in a long time I had to send something back. For $5, it was the smallest serving of rice ever. I know it's a tapa but this was like the size of the palm of my hand. Ridiculous. Not only that but it was greasy, crunchy and no flavor. I've had rice a roni from a box better. Had to send it back and asked for grilled veggies instead. Waited and waited and waited. By the time the bills were about to be handed out, finally got the veggies. By this point it was so late and I was so annoyed I had lost all desire to even eat it. This whole disappointing experience cost me $20 for a small bowl of bland potatoes and some grilled veggies.

There's definitely a focus on quality ingredients and creativity that's pretty rare from restaurants in this area. That being said, there definitely is room for improvement. My boyfriend had the lasagna and it was a smaller portion than what one would expect for lasagna. The cannoli were great, but a bit small too. I ordered some penne in a creamy provolone sauce with Mac and cheese meatballs, which was pretty decently sized for me, but the side salad and focaccia were pretty small in comparison. Also, they use disposable plates,forks and cups, which might be costly in the long run, environmentally wasteful and drive away some customers who expect normal cups, plates and utensils, though I wasn't personally bothered by it. You can't really get a soda or cup of water here except in a bottle because they lack a soda fountain.

My favorite thing on the menu is the chicken wings, they're probably Pok Pok's most popular dish, but for good reason.

We were given red chili roasted peanuts and pandan infused water while we looked over menus. We came here for the highly acclaimed Fish Sauce Wings, but also decided to try out their Papaya Salad as we enjoy it at many other Vietnamese restaurants.Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings (6pc - $16.75): When we asked about how spicy the spicy option was, our server said its a mild spice, but she heard from other coworkers and customers that it was above just mild. She even said the Papaya Salad was more of a medium spice than these wings - we like spicy food and can handle it pretty well, so we got the spicy option. Definitely more of a medium spice, not mild - still very tasty though. However, the price definitely took away from the experience. Pretty absurd to charge almost $3 per wing...didn't think it was that worth. Still happy I tried them since they were so highly talked about, but I wouldn't get them again.Papaya Pok Pok ($9.75): Like I said in the beginning, we decided to give their Papaya Salad a try since we enjoy it at other Vietnamese restaurants. You usually get a full plate, fairly stacked high for around $8-$10. This was not the case for Pok Pok. You get a small dish, half of which is covered by a large wedge of cabbage, and then a small portion of Papaya Salad next to it. It was good, but if you're all about sharing food \\"family style\\", this is definitely not enough to share if you have more than 2 people.Servers had initially given our food to the couple seated next to us, and it wasn't until we noticed they weren't touching the food and looking around for their server that we asked if that was what they ordered.

I drove from Tampa (a 2 hour drive)with my mom and two sons just so we could try what I'd been seeing for months on Instagram. I must confess I don't remember how I came across their account on Instagram but I thank the IG gods. I did not try anything that was less than i expected. In case you didn't know, Wave has its normal menu and it's \\"off secret menu\\". It's not really a secret because if you follow their social media you'll see what yummy items they have to offer. We started with the pork belly boa bun and it was incredible. It was juicy, sweet, and had an amazing crunch and pop of texture from the pickled vegetables inside it. Then we tried the California roll and it was fresh and delicious.  My entree was the sushi hotdog. I'm not sure if you're familiar with this dish  but I'll take the liberty to explain what i experienced. The hotdog bun is spicy crab wrapped in seaweed and fried. This gives it a great crunch. They cut this open and place avocado on one side, cucumber to the other side, filled it with spicy tuna, topped with seaweed salad, and spicy mayo. This honestly was to die for. The next dish which my mom ordered was the sushi crunch wrap. This was amazing too. I fear I'm not giving these items a proper discrimination so i won't try to explain this one. What i will say is that i did try this as well and it was simply divine. I loves  every bite. I did not try the sushi donut but my son almost licked the plate. All joke aside, this restaurant was worth the drive and worth the wait time. There wasn't much wait time when we got there but I'm sure it can get quite busy. Please know that if there is a wait when you get there ...it is WORTH IT! I drove 2 hours and was not disappointed. I will definitely be going back.

The gravy did have a kick to it... something I did not expect!  It was filling and I so wanted to take some home with me!   The coffee also was good and was nice to have that maple taste to it. The restaurant itself was decorated well in a rustic fashion.  It was super clean and well lit.   They do have free wi-fi which is a nice touch too!  It is a little louder than most places due to the hard surfaces but not so loud you could not have a conversation.  Atmosphere = 8Food = 10Service = 10This was everything I expected and more.  I so wish they would build one on the west side of Orlando!  I would gain 10 pounds!  The food was good and the staff super friendly.  I can't wait to go back again and try one of their chicken items.

Finally got my chance for my birthday lunch. \\nOnce we entered I immediately knew the owner was behind the counter.

I decided to try their meatball smash with egg and their stoppe salad. My food was very good, full of flavor and cooked perfectly.  \\nWhile food quality was on point, I do see things that maybe could be tweaked a bit. I'm not really a fan of ordering at the front counter, sitting down to eat and then going back up to the counter afterwards to pay. I feel like it should all be done at one time, especially for lunch when more people tend to be in a hurry. Also, for checking in on Yelp you get a free cannoli. However, I was told that they hadn't made any yet that day and was offered a biscotti instead. I was completely fine with that, but I later noticed that they ended up charging me for it. \\nAll in all a good experience for my first time and I would definitely try this place again. I still need to give the crab meatballs a whirl. Thanks Meatball Stoppe and congrats on the recent episode of Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives.

We were seated right away even though we arrived slightly early. We basically ordered an appetizer, two entrees and some sides to share between three people. Lobster fritters- A good appetizer. It tasted exactly how I imagined fried lobster to taste. Wish there was a different sauce other than the honey mustard it comes with on the plate. \\n \\nDry aged steak for 2- I kept reading how it was the best deal on the menu. It is a good deal. It's basically a porterhouse steak which is a strip and filet. It comes already cut for you along with some of the steak's jus. We opted for rare, and it was cooked perfectly. The steak was well-seasoned and very tender. Truffle butter accompaniment- I probably wouldn't get this again. It tasted good with the steak but did not make much of a difference. Colorado rack of lamb- We ordered this medium rare, and it was tender and not as gamey as some lamb. Very good! Jalape√±o creamed corn- This was my favorite side. I loveee very sweet corn! Creme br√ªl√©e- My favorite dessert anywhere! Warm apple and cherry crisp- Very good. Not sure if there were apples in there, but the cherries were tart and delicious!

The ambience, service and decor is all nice at this place. It's a very casual walk-up and order style restaurant, with tacos, burritos, and other simple Mexican fare. I would dare say some of the food tasted fairly authentic, but there was one thing that really detracted from the quality of several of the dishes.And that was the gooey melted cheese on the burritos and tortas. While some people love runny melted cheese, this is not something I expected to find on Mexican food except maybe at an El Torito's or Taco Bell or other some such Mexican American chain that some gringos love but that I love to hate. It's just not my thing after having real Mexican food in Mexico. Why is there no queso fresco or other crumbly authentic Mexican cheeses like Cotija around for food like this? It would be so easy to fix, to make the food better by a factor of ten. Alas, this is not the case.\\nWhile the torta bread was light and crispy as it should be, the chicken mole filling, while tender, had little flavor of mole, and the oozing cheese was just not doing it for me. My son's burrito had the same gooey cheese. My sopes were good, with crema Mexicana on top and the absence of cheese made them the one really satisfying dish I was easily able to finish off. So ok, this is Mexican on a budget, and the guacamole and chips were good too. But it could be so much better with so few changes. I have to beg to differ on the cheese-just swap it out for some cotija or queso fresco, and all will be well at Maisal."},{"name":"360 Pizza","address":"2712 Bee Caves Rd, Ste 106","city":"Rollingwood","stars":"4","text":"In an ever so vibrant age of amazing eateries in the city of Austin, I find myself wondering if I'll ever receive what I'm paying my hard earned money for at 360 pizza.

So if you're coming here they definitely get the ratio right on sweetness to satisfying. We ordered two sets of the chicken wings and sticky rice. But both agreed and 3rd wing would have been even more amazing. They give it to you at an upcharge of $3. But we went with the roti instead. Although we got confused and it didn't come with the curry so we ended up getting it at the table after. The only set back was the sticky rice. I feel like it was over cooked or not soaked long enough. It got hard and really chewy versus your softness with typical sticky rice, so it's texture was all off - better dipped in the curry though. The flavor of the chicken is always very delightful and honestly my parents say that hat yai fried chicken is way better than pok pok.

From the outside it looks like an abandoned warehouse you have to be pointed in the right direction for the door and told that this is the right place.  It is Valet parking only, you don't get a ticket the valets just remember you and run to your car when they see you come out the door.  Inside is where the magic happens.  The lighting like most upscale steakhouses is pretty dim with nice mood lighting.  The ceiling were really high (it actually used to be a warehouse).  It was a Thursday night, It was fairly busy but I was able to get seated right away even without reservations.  The service was one of the best I have ever had.  The staff seemed to work as a seasoned team.

However, it certainly won't be my last.From the moment I stepped through the door, I felt like I had stepped back in time (all in a very good way).  I was immediately greeted at the front counter with a warm friendliness as if I was a frequent customer. I was then welcomed to take a seat wherever I preferred.  I planned on eating my large pepperoni (with extra sauce and extra cheese) and ice cold canned Cherry Coke at the restaurant.  Soon after sitting down in a very comfortable old school red leather booth, I was greeted by my server, Ashley.  Ashley could not have  been kinder, friendly, or anymore attentive.  Her service was perfect and old school too in the way that she clearly and genuinely enjoys being a member of the Rubino's team and providing customers with the best possible service.  She checked on me at the perfect frequency to see how I was doing or if I needed anything.When my pizza (large pepperoni with extra sauce and extra cheese) arrived pipping hot at my table, it was even better than I imagined.  The cracker crust was the perfect crispness and had excellent flavor to compliment but by no means overshadowed the rest of the pie.  The sauce is clearly original recipe and I image tastes just as wonderful and identical to as it did when Rubino's first opened many decades ago.  I had ordered \\"extra sauce\\" upon outside recommendation and that was the perfect amount for my tastes.  The cheese (I had ordered extra cheese, again on outside recommendation) was the perfect amount for me, delicious and natural tasting, and the perfect consistence (gooey but not runny, and producing a nice string when serving yourself another delicious, hot, slice).  The pepperoni was the delicious and the old school style of cupping pepperoni that children of the 1950s through 1980s will fondly remember.As I enjoyed the above described deliciousness, I also took in and enjoyed my surroundings.  In addition to my physical surroundings feeling old school in a very welcoming and comforting way (and too rare in today's world), I realized that my fellow customers were old school too.  What I mean by that is that there were families having real conversations, not sitting there glued to their iPhones.  It was also clear that many of the parents had been coming to Rubino's since they were the age (or even younger) that their children are now.I was hoping that I would have leftover pizza to enjoy for at least lunch (and maybe even dinner the next day).  I did ultimately have four pieces left from my large pepperoni pizza but that was not going to be enough for me, so I ordered through Ashley (who again was the perfect server, which is sadly too scare in today's world) a large combo pizza with mushrooms and extra sauce and extra cheese to go.When I requested my bill, Ashley brought me the old school, hand written bill (I love it!) and I paid her the $29 and change (plus her much deserved tip) for the two large pizzas and two ice cold cans of Cherry Coke in cash (Please note that Rubino's only accepts cash or checks.  This was perfectly fine with me and I knowing this in advance I brought enough cash).  I did overhear that there is an ATM or two close by.  As I left Rubino's in possession of my leftovers from my pepperoni pizza and a fresh, pipping hot large combo with extra sauce and extra cheese, and said \\"thank you\\" and \\"see you later\\" (this was certainly not \\"goodbye\\") to the wonderful staff, I knew that I will become a regular customer of the Greater Columbus treasure that is Rubino's.  While I was enjoying my first (of hopefully many to come) wonderful Rubino's experience, I did observe that they appear to do a steady business of carry-out orders, even on a weekday.I am writing this review while doing a little \\"desk dining\\" of the combo pizza which I brought for lunch.

Finally, I decided to stop in for dinner before getting into the highway traffic. \\nI was very excited about the menu, seemed like everything was made to order and they took your wants and needs seriously. (gluten-free menu available, vegetarian options). However, it seems that night they were off their game but made up for it.The Atmosphere: Causal, large setting. Lots of variety in the space. Seems like it can handle small and large parties alike, along with a good amount of bar space for guests. They also have a small outdoor space that looked quite cozy despite being close enough to the highway. Great stop if you want to get out of traffic or enjoy a meal away from the mall before or after shopping or work. The Food: I don't think I'll be craving this food by any means, but it satisfied my needs. We ordered the Nachos with BBQ Chicken for an App. Came out, and there was no chicken on it, we decided to eat it anyways and by the time the waitress came back to order, we were already almost done with it. We did tell her, and she advised we would not be charged. Very appreciative on that aspect since we just ate chips and cheese with BBQ sauce! Main meal: I got a turkey burger and another got a regular burger. The turkey burger was very bland with very little seasoning, it was so bland i ended up only eating half of the burger and all of the bun, but I enjoyed the sides of veggies and rice! However, my friend asked for no onions, no lettuce, but he ended up getting both on it. This would have been fine to pick off, if the onions weren't encased in the cheese, making it impossible to remove. Again, we told the waitress and it was rectified, but my biggest concern was that it seems like they take care of the customers and what their needs are, but 2 of the 4 items we ordered were incorrect. I would be worried about allergy specific needs not being able to be met, or the gluten intolerant people getting gluten bread by mistake. Our errors were obvious, but other errors might be more difficult to spot. I also say this because my vegetarian friend ordered what she thought was a vegetarian dish, and she got chicken on it! So, to all my food specific people, check this place out, but just triple check the order.

But who cares who's in charge so long as the experience is worth the tab?  And at this echelon of the pricing scale, the experience ought to overshadow any thoughts of ownership. Regrettably, that is not the case here.  At least not yet. We were asked to submit all plate/course orders at once so that the kitchen could plan an appropriate tempo of coursing. Wonderful, we thought, finally a place that encourages the Italian pace of a meal. 12 minutes after placing our order, all plates arrived simultaneously and without comment. Tempo?The food itself was terrific - thoughtfully prepared and with well-sourced ingredients. The portions, however, appear to be the result of Instagram-focused intentions rather than a real life diner's satiation. Double that for the wine. Finally, like the service and food, the atmosphere is an almost. LED/fluorescent  lights in the soffits, kitchen, and back hall would be at home in the basement bathroom of a government building.

The bartender was no where to be found and when he did show, he was careless and lacked a sense of urgency. As he served the guy with a beer, he returned to the back booth hidden from service.

This location in Buckhead can be found inside the Lenox Village shopping center along with Roasters and Yogli Mogli.I would put Sushi Kiku in the same category as Ru San's -- cheap sushi in a casual yet trendy atmosphere.  They have a lunch buffet ($11.99 weekdays, $13.99 weekends) and play club/dance music just like Ru San's.A popular special is half-off sushi and rolls, Tuesdays through Saturdays, dinner dine-in only.  When I heard of this long-running \\"deal,\\" I thought it was a gimmick.  What kind of sushi restaurant would offer half-off sushi 5 out of 7 nights a week?It turns out, while the sushi is indeed sold at a 50% discount, the original prices are inflated, so you end up paying about the same as you would at a comparable sushi restaurant.  It's pretty much a gimmick to draw customers in.Examples:\\n2 pieces of maguro nigiri (tuna) are $6.29 (half price ~$3.15)\\n2 pieces of hamachi nigiri (yellowtail) are $6.29 (half price ~$3.15)\\n2 pieces of ikura nigiri are $5.99 (half price ~$3.00)\\nMost rolls are between $10.99 and $12.99 (half price ~$6.00-7.00)I feel sorry for anyone who actually purchases the sushi here at full price.  At original pricing, the rolls are a better value.  The nigiri is overpriced, especially for the quality of fish you get.Speaking of quality, it's passable, but not top-of-the-line sushi.  If you want authentic, high quality sushi, go to Sushi House Hayakawa on Buford Highway or Taka in Buckhead.  Sushi Kiku specializes in value sushi, along the lines of Ru San's or suburban strip mall sushi.  I will say, though, that Kiku's fish quality is better than that of Ru San's.  If given the choice, I would chose Kiku over Ru San's.I've tried many of the nigiri here including the salmon, scallop, ikura (salmon egg), tuna, and red snapper.  I've also tried the \\"Viagara\\" roll (cucumber, avocado, crab, and eel covered in three different types of tobiko - small eggs), futomaki (thick roll with crab, egg, cucumber, and more), and tekkamaki (tuna roll).The nigiri are sufficiently fresh and flavorful.  Sometimes, there's a bit too much rice on the nigiri pieces and it's not soft enough (too dense).  The Viagara and tuna rolls aren't bad.  I wouldn't recommend the futomaki.  It falls apart easily.  I enjoy ordering futomaki at other restaurants, though.Service is good and the sushi and rolls come out in a reasonable amount of time.At night, the ambiance is dimly lit.  Very much a casual date spot.  There are two bars, one regular and one sushi.  There's also a back room designed for groups.

Be sure to make reservations well in advance, since this place is so popular. If you don't have a reservation, I've heard time estimates of 1-2 hours. They print their menus on a daily basis, so when you make your reservation, you can have them customize your menu (birthdays, anniversaries, etc). I was running a couple of minutes late for my reservation, so I gave them a call and they were extremely accommodating. Food: loved it all. For two people, we split a bowl of clam chowder, two oyster sliders, half a dozen oysters, lobster roe noodles, and the lobster roll. All were amazing. Fresh and high quality food. Both the lobster entrees had very generous portions of lobster meat, so it was well worth the price. We couldn't come here without trying the oysters of course, and they have a large selection.

Shigezo has comfortable seating and a welcoming (if dark) interior. It is expertly staffed and everybody wants you to feel at home from the moment you walk in the door. The lunch menu is limited, with about eight selections (they are thinking about expanding it down the road depending on the mid-day traffic.) That didn't bother us at all since we had come for the ramen. They have one ramen of the day at lunch currently; this one was in a base of chicken/vegetable broth, and it was packed  with noodles that were to my mind ideal, along with a fair amount of veggies and a very lean, very tasty slice of pork. The flavors were delightful, and a small pinch dish of Japanese pepper mix was offered on the side. The $9.00 portion was ample and could even be shared by two, especially if you had an appetizer or salad to split along with it. We're going to go back for dinner, where there is a broad selection of everything from izakaya-style skewers and bar snacks to full entrees. The ramen is only $0.50 more at dinner (unless you order the bigger size, which would definitely be to share,) and rice plates appear to be a great value. In fact, dinner doesn't cost any more than lunch, so I would only think of this as a two-dollar-sign restaurant. You can run up the bill with more exotic sushi and small plate items if you like, or a bottle of $195 sake, but it is also quite possible to dine economically here. The menu seems to be designed to support as simple or elaborate a meal as you might want. The whole vibe, as mentioned by others, is of complete authenticity - - not surprising since the company is in fact Japanese and operates similar establishments there. They've basically transported  one of their restaurants to a new country, and I think Portland should be honored to be the beneficiary of their first outpost. I know I'm happy about it!"},{"name":"Nagoya Sushi","address":"9175 148 Street","city":"Surrey","stars":"4","text":"A friend and I wanted to grab some sushi near where we work, so we settled on Nagoya sushi.  We must have come just before the lunch rush, as the tables quickly filled up, with people coming in to pick up their food as well, which was promising.  They have an extensive menu with lots of different items.  I had the sunomuno salad and sashimi - there was nothing special about the items; portion size was average, the sashimi came as generous slices, and it didn't give me the runs, which is always a good sign.  My friend ordered the ramen - I highly suspect it to be the prepackaged kind.  They have bento boxes available at lunch, if you're looking for a decent meal at a reasonable price.  This wasn't the best sushi I've had, but given our location, it's not bad.

I even realized I made a slip up (forgot 2 ppl in my reservation...oops) day of and they were able to accommodate the larger party.Pok Pok is located inside of what looks like a home. We were seated inside the house (upstairs so a little tough for those with difficulty...would recco you request seating downstairs next to the bar area). The decor was kitschy and the music was loud, but the food was phenomenal. Our waiter was the typical PDX hipster, not super enthusiastic but got the job done and checked on us multiple times as well as refilled our waters/our special request for hot water. As a group of 8 we ordered doubles of the following:- Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings: So good!!!! Worth all the hype and MORE. Tender, sticky, with just the right amt of sweetness. Loved this!- Kai Yaang Tuua (whole roasted chicken): It's the whole chicken so some of the pieces tend to be drier than others. Comes with a bunch of dipping sauces, so that helped. Other than that, decent but unmemorable. - Kaeng Hang Leh (Northern Thai sweet pork belly and pork shoulder curry): A Chiang Mai classic! Everyone kept pouring the curry sauce over their rice - it was THAT good!- Kung Op Wun Sen (prawn and pork belly casserole): prawns were seriously large and it was served with vermicelli which sopped up allllll dat sauce! Topped it off with a few Thai iced teas and a Pilsner (beer...when in PDX!) and we were all happy and full!

The strawberries and blueberries were also sour . 5 egg whites and turkey bacon: egg whites were good. Not sure how anyone can go wrong with that. The turkey bacon wasn't my favorite. Perhaps the brand? Eggs Benedict: egg was slightly over cooked. Not as runny as I like. But flavor and everything else was spot on. Chicken, bacon, & eggs: my brother loved it! Steak omelette: it was good. Although My dad asked for no cheese on the omelette , they still put it. But he still enjoyed itService: great! Would I come back ? Absolutely. And will try other items off the menu"},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is awesome.

I actually created this account, just so I could write about my experience here. Typically I would never write a poor review about a place because I hate making a fuss and complaining about things...but I really felt compelled to write this review. I've always heard a ton of hype about how good the food is and I figured that I should finally check it out. When ordering the Vegetarian version of the Khao Soi yesterday, I asked the waitress if I could substitute some of the soy with vegetables because I don't really like soy. Her response to me was \\"vegetarian doesn't mean vegetables, it means no meat, so no\\". Not only was it rude, but she said it in a very condescending, pretentious way. I understand that they may not offer substitutions, and that's okay. A simple \\"no, sorry or sorry, we don't offer any substitutions\\" would have sufficed. Plus, Ive been vegetarian for 15 years now and I absolutely know what it means. It then felt awkward the next couple times she visited the table...I couldn't wait to get out of there. The curry soup broth itself was really good, but totally overpriced. I ended up leaving hungry after only eating the noodles and taking out all the soy chunks and gross mushrooms (which were the only vegetable included).

I like to stick to my basic cheeseburger with fries, but I've also tried the royal red robin burger which includes an egg and bacon and is equally satisfying. One thing to note when eating here is that the burger patty choices are either pink or no pink. Thus, there is no option to choose between the typical rare, medium rare, well done, etc. However, my burgers are never too dry (I always order my burgers with pink) and even come with a burger wrap on one end so my fingers don't get too messy when I eat it. Next, the fries are usually pretty crispy and cooked to perfection, but the bottomless option isn't as great as they sound because the fries fill you up quickly (I occasionally skip out on the second serving of fries) and the other side options, such as broccoli and yukon chips aren't as appealing. However, if you're willing to splurge and not go for bottomless sides, then the onion rings are another great option. I'm very picky about my onion rings, but the ones here definitely met my expectations. The breading wasn't too thick. It was crispy and seasoned well. Lastly, the customer service was great! There were ipads to order and play games on. I only scrolled through the ipad to see what it had to offer, but it charged us $2 even though we didn't play any games. The waitress quickly resolved this for us. Thus, the delicious burgers and great customer service keep me coming back."},{"name":"Chuy's","address":"8123 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Yikes. Heading over to Taco Bell would have given me a better dinner than Chuy's. If you're a local like me, do not go here. It's tourist trap for those who do not understand that better Mexican restaurants are in abundance in Orlando.I came here with my family to have an enjoyable Mexican meal. Mexican chains are usually simple and do not disappoint. As usual, we were welcomed with the ordinary chips and salsa. The salsa was delicious and fresh but what was really disappointing was that each time our waiter filled up our nachos, there were five nachos on the bottom of the bowl which were not fully cooked. You can't really get worse than salty, uncooked nachos.For our main portions, we ordered the Tacos del Carbon, the Enchilada, Chalupa and Taco meal and the Chuychanga. The Tacos del Carbon were very simple tacos, nothing special. My Enchilada, Chalupa and Taco meal arrived to me on a plate that seemed as if a hurricane had come across. The beans, enchilada, chalupa, taco and rice were all mixed up in this huge jumble of nonsense. The chalupa tasted like a Mexican pizza from Taco Bell without any sauce; the enchilada was just nasty, and the basic fast-food taco was the best thing I ate that night. My companion said the Chuychanga was awful, forcing me to question why I came to eat at Chuy's in the first place.To all the tourists out there on I-Drive, Don Pablo's down the street is better. Taco Bell is better. Even Del Taco near Festival Bay is better. To all my fellow locals in Orlando, if you want real Mexican in Orlando and want to skip the chains on I-Drive that cater only to uninformed tourists, then head over to Azteca d'Oro or Agave Azul.

That's not saying much here in Austin, as it beat out the likes of PF Changs, Magic Woks, and that little eggroll stand on the Drag.  If you're looking for authentic Cantonese cuisine, this is the place to gnosh.So you want to open your own successful Chinese restaurant?  Just follow these simple rules:Rule #1:  Force your customers on the waitlist to loiter outside with all the smokers and ex-cons.  Setup a bottleneck in the lobby area so it violates half of the city's fire ordinances.Rule #2:  Hire rude waitstaff.  Maybe call up some overseas relatives so you don't have to pay them as much.  No training is necessary as you want to maintain a high level of craptastic service.  Although you want to make them watch a few Randy Moss highlight reels to perfect that look of apathy.  Be sure to teach your bus girls how to fling half-filled plastic cups of water into the cleanup bins to maximize splashing on customers.  Rule #3:  Make sure the tables and seating surfaces are as sticky as possible.  Bowls, plates, and chopsticks must have leftover food particles for extra flavor.Rule #4:  Gotta have fish tanks filled with tilapia, crabs, and assorted crustaceans.  Overstock them so they don't have room to move around.  PETA members don't eat at Chinese restaurants anyways.  Don't clean the tanks either -- the murky poo water makes it more authentic.Rule #5:  Cook up some good eats.\\nDin Ho abides by all of these rules but really emphasizes rule #5.  We usually order the prix-fixe dishes on the back of the menu (dinner for 6, 8, 10, etc) and chow down family style.  They've got several big round tables with lazy susans which is perfect for large parties.  Just spin it until you see something you like -- it's the MSG Wheel of Fortune!  Peking duck with the green onions, hoisin sauce, and steamed buns is my fave.  Be sure to wedge a piece of the fatty duck skin in there.  Beef and chinese broccoli, seafood soup, snow pea leaves, pork-stuffed tofu, and walnut prawns are good too.  There's usually a lobster and/or whole fish to round out the gauntlet.  You can always pad your order with some greasy BBQ pork or chicken.*** Tip:  large parties of six or more?  pay cash and get a 10% discount off your total bill."},{"name":"Counter Culture","address":"2337 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I did enjoy the Mac & cheese balls. & it's all vegan!

They returned the very next day in the morning and the meals were shown to Jerry who denied them a refund as he said they should have called first. That's his policy. He didn't tell them himself, just made the asst mgr do it.  These are two senior citizens who felt they should drive back over in 95 degree heat because that was the right thing to do.

Wow! This is like a one stop shopping for everything you could possibly need, grocery wise, health, and beauty item. When we first walked in the produce was on the right and there were so many many options as to what we could choose. They also have a lot of help yourself type of items. Just to the left of the produce, there is a section that has these little honey filled straws. A friend of mine from work but some of these and share them with us. She cut off the bottom and top tips and use them as a sort of straw for her tea. As the honey drips down the straw into your tea you stir it and then use your straw to drink it and get the last of the delicious honey. There must've been 15 different flavors of honey. There was also bulk items of candy, spices, coffee, and so many other bulk items too many to name here. The middle of the store is your basic shopping area with things that you need to buy for your pantry and snacks. The back of the store has amazing beef, fish, and poultry selections and very good prices. They also have a butcher shop in the back which has amazingly delicious looking items. They have help yourself salad bars, sushi cafe, ramen cafe, hot food, all different selections of olives. They also have a deli area with hot foods. And you can sample whatever ones you want. They also have a sandwich and pizza area.  I had a taste of the pizza and it was amazingly good. They have a bakery area. They have a caf√© area where you can sit and enjoy your food purchases.  There is also a wine and beer section where you can buy a glass to sip while you shop. They have a really neat idea of a prepackaged meal for two for about $15. You just take it home and heat it up. And I was talking to the chef in the deli and he was telling me how everything is prepared in the deli from scratch. He was very proud of his store.

They're just one of the small details that contribute to Barlow's upscale, Gatsby-esque vibe. It's a beautiful bar, and would be an ideal venue for a special occasion or a hot date. The cocktail list at Barlow is legit, with both originals (\\"inspired by the heyday of cinema and jazz,\\" according to the menu) and classics. I'm generally drawn to spirit-forward cocktails, so I went off-menu with a Oaxaca old fashioned, a twist on the classic subbing out Mezcal for the traditional bourbon. It was fantastic, and I'd order it again in a heartbeat. That being said, there were some originals on the menu that caught my eye, particularly the Ghost World, which combines Japanese Whiskey with mint and apple. And even if you don't order a perfect martini for yourself, you'll surely enjoy watching them prep one for another guest; the glass is chilled with liquid nitrogen, which is dramatically flung against the marble bar to create a foggy effect that'll catch your eye. Finally, one of my favorite details about their cocktail list is that each selection offers up two different spirit options, between middle and top-shelf labels. It's a good way to help budget your boozing dollar. I've never eaten at Barlow, but it shares a kitchen with Picnic House, one of my favorite restaurants in town, and one that I consider woefully under-rated. The menu looks to share a number of items, which guarantees you'll be eating better here than at many bars in the area. You know what?

Been back and forth with this restaurant but recently when they added a bigger variety of ramens and ramen combos, I decided to give it another try with hope that the food is a lot better. Spicy Hakata Chashu Ramen is good and gets spicier as you continue to eat it. The regular Hakata Chashu Ramen is just okay. Hakata Temperura Ramen is okay too.I don't remember the other ones I've tried but all the ramens has an after-taste of saltiness. I find myself drinking at least 2-3 glasses of water and sometimes I can still see lip stains on their glasses (eww). Takoyaki (aka octopus balls) are delicious but I recently found out it's all pre-made. Shrimp wrapped in potatoes is interesting. Sushi are always good and fresh. Presentations of entrees are always on point. However, I care more about the food. Prices are reasonable and if you get the daily ramen combo, just be aware that the size of your ramen bowl will be smaller than what you normally get if you just get a ramen bowl BUT you do get a lot more food overall for the same price of a ramen bowl.Street parking and parking in the back of the restaurant.They accept credit cards.There's 2 televisions (maybe just 1?) here but nothing is played... ever.You can now order online through foodler!

I started with the soup of the day, a very nice chicken soup  and my wife had the house salad.  For dinner she had the Pan- Roasted Salmon with roasted corn on polenta (excellent) and I had the Lamb Tagine, which was a delicious combination of braised lamb shank, grilled harissa ribs and fried lamb belly on Moroccan spiced couscous. For dessert we had a delightful version of bread pudding a la mode.

I had fallen in love with this grocery chain when another one opened on the other side of town (which was way out of the way since we had moved to SODO), so my expectations were high for this location. To say the least, I've been blown away by the quality of food, service and variety of options available. Other locations have not quite hit par in comparison to the SODO Lucky Market. Their meat selection has never failed us. Our family especially enjoys their sausage selection - even the out of towners request them! Personally, I'm a big fan of the chorizo. The olive bar and hot bar always look clean and well maintained. The cheese selection.. oh, the cheese! (sums that up, I think)I love that all locations do carry at least a handful of locally sourced options. As a household we also appreciate that there are enough gluten-free options to accommodate our family's needs (fianc√© was a delicate tolerance for wheat, so we are \\"gluten mindful\\"). I've personally visited and shopped at several Lucky Market locations. Since our recent move to the UCF area, we've given a couple of closer locations a shot and have come to the conclusion that the SODO location is the only one in which we will shop.

I would give this coffee shop 5 stars if it weren't for one employee. I have great relationships with all the other employees - Fred, Alberto, and Nadia in particular always make my day and I look forward to seeing them. In the past I used to go to the other Bennu on MLK all the time in college. Eventually one of their employees, Aimee, was so rude to me and so passive aggressive that I vowed to never go again. She played terrible emo music nonstop, and she always acted like you were an idiot if you didn't order things exactly as they came. Basically her whole demeanor was very patronizing. Over time she and a few of her friends made it a place I disenjoyed going to because they were always the entitled barista stereotype and made me feel bad for getting coffee.When Bennu took over the Dominican Joe's on soco next to my apartment I was upset because expected it to be a rude place for their ride baristas to be rude again - and I loved Dominican Joe's. However, they proved me so wrong. They were so nice I totally changed my mind - but when I told people I like Bennu I always clarified I was talking about the Soco location. Most people who know Bennu were skeptical - they had similar experiences at the other location, and when we met for coffee they all expressed how surprised they were the staff was so nice.For some reason they moved her and now she's back, jerking up the place, at my favorite coffee shop. Today I asked her for the same thing I always get, espresso with some topo on the side (which is how Espresso is supposed to come Bennu) and she told me they don't do that. Then when I said they always do she made a big show of bringing it out to me at the register and acting like it was such a chore to have to come up with a price for it so I felt dumb. I don't like to feel dumb or like an inconvenience - I go far out of my way to be sweet to people and tip everywhere I go because it matters.I won't be going in if Aimee is working - which is a huge inconvenience because Bennu is right next to my apartment - but I can't stand her and I won't contribute a cent to her jerking up my favorite coffee shop."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I've been here once and probably won't come again.

If I ever spend 60 dollars for 2 people at a thai place, it better be filled with prawns and crab or fish, BUT no just some chicken wings, noodle soup and a 16 dollar plate for tiny slices of boar.

When we tried to order a few more items of dim sum (4 more items to be exact), the server went off on us. Literally. She was yelling that we had ordered too much food (which we truly had not) and that we would have to wait because other tables were ordering and we would have to wait for their orders to be fulfilled before we would get ours. We would have waited, but with that attitude and demeanor, no thank you. My meal was ruined and I definitely will not be coming back ever. My business will go elsewhere to an establishment that serves better dim sum and provides better service. \\nMy suggestion for the restaurant is to make sure that they are adequately staffed on the floor and in the kitchen during and a few days after the holiday season to accommodate the higher influx of customers. There were only 3 people working the floor and who knows how many in the kitchen.

It was almost opening time, so I sure there wouldn't be any issues. It was early in the week, and the place had only been open about 20 minutes before we walked in. There was a few patrons bar side, and we were told to pick any seat we liked.Our only target was the burger with 1/3 lb of cheese. We also got mac & cheese (talk about redundant!) with an bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer. The shrimp- delicious, and the dipping sauce had a great kick to it.  I always keep my expectations low when it comes to Mac & cheese at a sports bar, but this one was actually pretty decent. A good serving size, that my friend and I both had to take with us- because we couldn't finish the burger plus the Mac.The burger was cool, something I was happy to eat once. It had a rather flat patty and the bread was a little burnt, but figuring out how to eat it was fun in itself. Most of the cheese is fried to a slight crisp, sorta like eating a thick potato chip of cheese.Since all my friends saw my Instagram pic, (@burger.heaux)  they also want to try it for themselves.

It was supposedly marinated and grilled, and therefore took a full 20-25 minutes for preparation. Um, what? Fish takes *minutes* to grill. It cooks faster than a chicken thigh. Also, it had not one iota of grilled flavor. It tasted like it was baked- which would take forever* and then tossed on the grill at the last second to crisp up the skin. The only memorable thing was the hot fish sauce. It was very spicy and very flavorful. But the insult came at the end of the meal. We asked for mango sticky rice ahead of time. The table next to us overheard us and ordered it before we finished our meal. When ours came out, the mango was starting to rot and mushy at the bottom. We sampled it to be sure, even though it was visibly disintegrating and had that distinct odor of rotting fruit. We sent it back to the kitchen, and what happened next made us feel terrible for our waiter.

I stepped forward having arrived at least 15 minutes before them.  After some hemming and swallowing, I was told no...parties one one never get a table even though they have a number of very small two person tables.I shortly was seated at the counter.  The real impetus for this review is not the waitlist screwup, but the very sad vegetable tempura with two added shrimp tempuras.  There was no crispness to any piece of tempura was served.  A top notch Japanese restaurant serves crisp tempura not a soggy bowl of limp veggies and shrimp.My advice is to request your server order \\"crisp tempura please.\\"  That could result in real tempura.On the positive side both the gyoza and steamed pork buns were very well prepared and delicious.  I totally enjoyed them.  They turned a one star review into a three star."},{"name":"The Meatball Stoppe","address":"7325 Lake Underhill Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Mediocre at best. We used a Groupon voucher which limits which foods you can order, but this was not a problem for us due to a good amount of options. We had ordered calamari as an appetizer and weren't informed until 10 minutes later that they had ran out. The server offered to substitute with the focaccia and we agreed, but we were still charged the price of the calamari. The meatballs were cooked well and our baked ziti was good, but the rest of the food was too salty. Due to the Groupon voucher, when we received the bill we were informed of an 18% automatic gratuity.

I have heard about the legendary waits for this small original outpost, so we arrived before they opened and ended up being seated almost right after they opened at 11:30am.Cute interior, friendly staff that is clearly used to dealing with out of town customers and people who are not used to eating Thai food, although they'll make it clear to you that a lot of the dishes aren't true Thai dishes, but an amalgam of Thai/American/Vietnamese/etc.We wanted to taste some of the famous dishes, as well as old standbys we know and love.  The Spicy Wings were good, not outstanding, as they were a bit too sugary and dry for me.  But, total drinking food. The Som Tam was good and had some nice heat to it. I would have preferred the tiny shrimps to have been a bit more crunchy, as they frequently were in Chiang Mai, but still good.  The Sai Ua and all its accoutrements were great and just how I remember it! The winner, for me, was the Laap Meuang, which was full of delicious flavor. This is the not that traditional Issan style many are accustomed to, with fish sauce, lime juice, etc. This is the Lanna style, full of dried spices, a variety of offal, and pork blood. Don't be scared away! This is what gives the dish its dark color, depth of flavor, and high nutritional value! Lol!Good service, even though the place got packed within 15 minutes of us sitting down, and a great (but overly filling) lunch!  Although it seemed as if the server understood me when I threw in a few Thai words, he didnt respond or acknowledge my Thai, so that was a let down.  They also didn't seem to kick up the food to the spice level we were looking for. Everything was still good to great, but I fear they may cater more to the standard American palate in some cases (though some of the dishes themselves are authentically Thai).I'd go back again for sure!"},{"name":"Friendly's","address":"1469 Providence Hwy","city":"Norwood","stars":"2.5","text":"Our family of four was completely ignored for 10-15 minutes after we walked up to the unattended hostess stand.

It did not! I'm not sure what else was in it, but def an experience to try that. I also had a som drink of theirs. It was mixed with celery and I hardly tasted that. It too was a refreshing drink paired with my meal. For my first time drinking som, this was amazing!The pork belly pot paired with the coconut rice was unbelievably delicious. The fat gave it so much flavor and the rice was perfect!The wings of course were so addicting I even returned home to make it myself. I'm also cooking it for thanksgiving.Overall, the most unique and delicious foodie experiences I've ever had.

It seems like the landscape around the University is constantly changing over the years (I've been around for the past 6 or so) but MadMex has been one of the only spots of constancy I can go to and enjoy a good time ever since I was a freshman or so in 2010. If you do decide to go for Late Night Mex (1/2 off), you need the majority of your party to be seated at a table (or you can wait at the bar!) And it's usually pretty busy so beware some wait times and rushing waiters/waitresses who might be more on the fast-paced side.

There were only a few dishes that didn't consist of fish, shellfish, etc.I ordered the roast chicken, which ended up costing $50 (when I asked if I could just order a single portion the waiter failed to mention we'd be charged for two people). This, in and of itself, is fine except that the chicken was devoid of flavor; sadly, any rotisserie chicken I've purchased (even Costco or the local supermarket) was more impressive.

Pretty over priced at $14 for 6 wings, but it is something I would definitely order again. The balance of sweet, salty, and spicy was there...just the way I like it!The kao soi was a disappointment, but I have had homemade kao soi in Chiang Mai. I found the soup to be way too runny with little depth of flavor...it was very one note. I also despised the deep fried Chinese chow mein noodles on top. NO. They should deep fry the same egg noodles that they use in the dish.Papaya pok pok salad was actually tasty. Be warned that it is incredibly fishy (on purpose), so if you are not accustomed to that type of flavor, don't order it. Anyhow, I liked how fresh and crunchy it was... a nice respite from our otherwise heavy selections. It really needed more citrus, though. Ask for extra limes.Hoi thawt is similar to a Vietnamese banh xeo, except kind of soggy. It is described as a \\"crepe\\" filled with oysters and bean sprouts. I did enjoy the flavors and they didn't skimp on the filling as there was oyster in every bite. However, as I mentioned, it was soggy. Maybe the crepe could be a little thicker, fried for a bit longer, and the oil better drained prior to plating it? Or maybe the fillings are too wet? Lastly, the sticky rice. I absolutely loved that it was served in a bamboo container...it totally reminded me of Chiang Mai! Unfortunately, it was a little too sticky and too chewy, though I still gobbled it up because... it's rice.

The fried green tomatoes were okay. The breading was a bit too much for tomatoes. We split a blackened catfish entree for 2, with grits and rice and beans for sides. Seasoning and sauce were good on the fish, sides were just alright we didn't bother to finish them. \\nHard lemonade is pretty good, and was more of a lemonade mojito since it came with crushed mint leaves.

If you've never had Peruvian food, I'd suggest trying Lomo Saltado, as everyone seems to enjoy steak, rice and french fries over a juicy sauce - this dish will give you a solid beginners introduction to what the cuisine is all about. My issue with ToP has been the slow service. While the restaurant is located very close to where my job is, I can't exactly come here unless I know it may take more than an hour. Service moves at a different pace here, and maybe that's okay if you're not in a hurry, but that's not often the case for lunch-goers. Overall, the food is good (though not GREAT), but it is better and more fairly priced than other \\"fancier\\" Peruvian restaurants in Central Florida - specifically talking about the one in downtown Orlando.

Don't. Get.Arriving at 8 pm on a Saturday night to an HOUR AND A HALF WAIT (for a buffet...), I figured, \\"dang, this place must be crazy good!\\" Unfortunately, I didn't feel very partial towards it at all.I'm only slightly ashamed to say that I ate my $35 worth of food, trying pretty much everything, sans the fresh mussels and some of the salad bar options (because the plates were empty the entire hour we were there) and really only a couple items stood out as worth retrying.SUSHI:\\nI tried a very wide variety of offerings- I'd say, close to 12 different rolls- and unfortunately, the majority of them tasted almost identical! Why offer so many options if they all taste the same anyway. My biggest turn off here was the cream cheese ratio- there was WAY too much cream cheese in the rolls, overpowering the taste of the other ingredients and making them heavy and creamy rather than refreshing. \\nUnless you really love cream cheese, stick with the sashimi options- but BEWARE THE HIDDEN WASABI!SALAD BAR:\\nThe options here included Seaweed Salad, Cucumber salad, tuna in a green sauce, roasted eggplant salad, and a number of other more obscure dishes that I can't describe because the platters were empty our entire dinner.\\nThe seaweed salad was perfectly adequate, but nothing special- the same could be said for the cucumber salad, eggplant, and ceasar salad.\\nThe Tuna in green sauce might have been the best thing on the entire bar. Fresh, flavorful, refreshing.HOT BAR:\\nFried crab legs, udon noodles, teriyaki chicken, Kalbi beef, fried shrimp, vegetable tempura, dumplings, etc.- Again, I didn't particularly like a single thing here. The Fried crab legs had no meat on them, the udon was extremely peppery, and I didn't like the flavor of the Kalbi beef at all. The dumplings were strange- I really can't explain why.SOUP:\\nCrab soup and Miso (rotating flavors)- the crab soup was terribly thick and viscous for a broth based soup.DESSERT:\\nThis was perhaps the redeeming factor of the whole place. They have a crepe station, and the lady working it was quick, friendly and made it delicious! \\nAnd they have GREEN TEA SOFT SERVE ICE CREAM. This was my favorite item in the whole buffet. (I don't feel like that is a good thing.)\\nOther offerings include mousse, jelly and cheesecake shooters, cakes, cookies, and jello. We tried a few of these, but none were fantastic.Overall, I'm glad I made the trip to Nori Nori to experience it for myself, but I would never spend the $30+ again for food I found to be very mediocre.

Overall I feel their pizzas are over cooked and the crust doesn't have much flavor or chew. Definitely avoid this place if you see kids in any type of sports uniforms.

Then, upon arriving I still had to wait an additional 5 minutes to get my order and when they came out they had actually given me a Chicken Biryani instead of my Chicken Karahi and they were also out of Lemonade. When I notified them of this they gave me a Lamb curry additionally to compensate and gave me a pop. Needless to say, I left as a very happy customer due to having the extra Biryani and it was definitely very tasty.I will give them a pass on the mix-up as this was in Ramadan near Iftar time and things were probably very frantic.

Their gluten free base and cross contamination control are some of the best I have found in the area. However, I went to pickup 3 pizzas that I had ordered last night and my experience was far below standard. I arrived just before my order was supposed to be ready and was told that they had run out of basil to dress one of the pizzas. When I asked if I could change it, I was told that it was already made (ok). The server behind the counter said that she could go out the back and cut some up, but it was apparent that this would have been a significant imposition so I declined the offer. I then proceeded to wait for 20 mins for all of my pizzas to be ready - whilst the 2 that we're ready sat out on a bench. As it turns out, the final pizza I was waiting on sat, ignored from the oven for at least 15 mins. Needless to say, by the time I got them home they were all cold and the meal was unpleasant.

It tasted unique and homemade and it gave a nice flavor to the sandwich. I wasn't a fan of the type of Swiss cheese they used, but it was a pretty decent Reuben overall.My friends got breakfast. One built her own omelet. She put tomatoes, mushrooms, and onions in it. She got hash on the side and two biscuits, which were fluffy.My other friend got 2 buttermilk pancakes with 2 sausages and an egg. You can choose to have links or patties, but she got the patties. The pancakes were fluffy and buttery and the sausage was tasty. She felt like the egg was cooked in bacon grease. Not a problem to her, but she could taste the flavor in it. It's possible that that's true or that they cook bacon on the same spot as everything else.Great prices though! Everything is below $10, so you don't have to break the bank!!

The recent change in ownership has really downgraded the quality of service along with food. I used to go here often to dine, but after today's visit I really would be crazy to return. Food: The food was ok. It wasn't great. If any thing, it was under seasoned. Service: Absolutely abysmal. We were greeted at the door in Chinese when the lady at the front, who I hear is the boss, assumed we were Chinese. My friend politely stated we were not and she gave him a dirty look before passing us quickly to the server. The service was going ok, but then the server dropped our pan chive dumplings directly on the hot chili sauce. That proceeded to soak the bottom of our fried shrimp dumplings. The server quickly picked up the pan chive dumplings with HIS HANDS and ran to the kitchen. The boss lady stared at the hot chili mess on our table and basically did nothing to clean it up. I had to use my one and only napkin to start cleaning the sauce. She then took a napkin from another table to quickly swipe it before leaving. I was never handed another napkin to replace the one I used. The server returned in 2 seconds, which I highly doubt is enough time to either clean the dumplings he touched with his hands OR to offer us new ones.This is the icing on the cake that has solidified my personal decision to never return. When we got up to leave after signing the check, the server literally reached across my friend as he was walking to grab the check and look at it. This completely blocked my friend from leaving. I seriously question whether the server's action is necessary or professional. He basically was seeing what tip we gave him since it was too long of a glance for a signature check. I tried to give to best and detailed review of this place. Sorry if it was long. TL;DR: Don't go here unless you want overpriced underseasoned food and to be blocked from walking out by servers who want to check what tip you gave them.

I didn't feel the same way leaving this place; more than half of what you pay probably goes to \\"ambiance\\" here... It certainly feel the experience was worth only half of the cost.I was in Atlanta for only three days for business, found this place on Yelp and I liked what I saw so decided to check it out rather late in the evening.  Parking ramp is in the back of the restaurant.  The first door around the corner is their main entrance.  Walking in, definitely gave you the feel that it was going to be one of those places with a personal chef & personal server dedicated just to you.  That feeling went away shortly after when a young female came in; not sure if she was in high school or college, but the loud conversation between her and the sushi chefs gave me the feeling like she is the daughter of the owner, talking about her classes.  Well, there goes the expensive \\"feel\\" to this \\"ambiance\\", so at this point you are just eating at a regular sushi joint but pay 3x as much.  She continued to chat loudly with one of her girlfriends by the entrance for the rest of my time there.Also, not sure how one of the Yelp photos show a plate of 8 sashimi pieces of 4 fish selections (2x each) because their sashimi menu is priced for 4 pieces per type of fish.  And, their sashimi cuts are thin, look half as thick as shown in this photo that I copied from a previous Yelp guest here.  My two-cent is price what you want, but the sashimi cuts have to be thick, not flabby like a Nigiri cut served without rice.I did like one of their rolls:  the Salmon Skin Roll, topped with eels & avocado.  I typically love salmon skin roll as well as dragon roll at other places... and the Salmon Skin Roll here is very nice combination of both crunchy salmon skin topped with eels & avocado much like a dragon roll.  Very tasty!!My waitress was very courteous.  However, after I paid & tipped 25% (not that they saw it yet in the check), I left the restaurant with not a single person saying thank you or goodbye... Not the sushi chefs (they saw me leaving), not my waitress (she was busy talking to another server so I don't blame her... but the sense of awareness from a staff at an expensive restaurant would never let a server miss a guest coming or leaving), and that chatty daughter with her friend didn't even bother moving away from the entrance so I could leave.I am not from Atlanta, but even if I am back in the area I won't return to this place.

Rather by saying, \\"Can you come back?\\" -- What about \\"Would you mind coming back to get it, please?\\" Or even better, \\"Would it be okay if we deliver to your appartment if it's okay with you?\\" (Maybe go an extra mile to delivery a drink or something to make it up and impress your customer while deliver the rice noodle).\\n3 When the customers did end up going back to pick it up (for the mistake caused by YOU), maybe see that as your last chance to make it up, rather than just a plain \\"sorry\\".This is jsut a very unpleasant experience overall, regardless of what the food tastes, they failed at the customer service big time.

The shrimp spring roll felt like it was missing something, maybe it was just too many rice noodles compared to ratio of herbs and meat, not sure. They let you choose up to 3 meats for their pho. Honestly at that price point though, I'd rather go to Buford Highway so you're really paying for the convenience of not traveling further. I get that it's more expensive to have a location ITP, but for me it's hard to justify paying the ~30% increase ($7-11 if you go 5 miles further.) All that said though, I probably won't come back because I hated the customer service there. Two separate people came by to push us to order more food (just opened and I guess business is slow). One of their new, young waiters would not leave us alone. When I told him I was just here for a snack, he pushed me to order more saying that \\"it's just the weekend, you have the whole week ahead of you to lose weight.\\" WHAT??!! Why would you ever say that to a girl? I had to say no 3 more times to his suggestions of drinks, appetizers, and other entrees before he finally left us alone. I hate it when people in the service industry don't listen, and especially when I've been clear and said, \\"no.\\"  It seems unfair to penalize the restaurant for this one waiter, but personally I find it hard to dissociate him from the restaurant and the food was not enticing enough for me to come by and give it another chance.I won't come back."},{"name":"Burgerim","address":"155 NE 192nd Ave, Ste 107","city":"Camas","stars":"3.5","text":"This was our first time here and this place did not disappoint.

She has certainly done her part to help restore our confidence in the JWM management team. Below was my previous review:\\nNice property with good restaurants as well as great pool area / lazy river as well as good kid's activities. We were upgraded to a large suite (pleasant surprise) which - when we entered - looked pretty nice with plenty of room which was great given we have two small kids.  However, we experienced substantial noise issues at night whereby somebody was scraping large objects  (chairs?) across the floor above us until late in the night - almost as if they were setting up a conference / event room area above us. In addition, we could hear water running in the room next to us (faucet(s) or washer(s) in a utility room?) that kept our young kids up through the night. We called the front desk and customer service number multiple times (at least 6-7 times) to inquire about these issues, but no one ever picked up and/or the call would transfer to a number that gave us a \\"fast busy\\" signal.  We also had a kitchen area with water on the floor due to a leaky ceiling - kind of gross when you walk into a water puddle when entering the room. We could have managed through all of this without much fuss except that when my husband called the \\"manager\\" (Andre Murray) to provide feedback the manager literally did nothing as it relates to addressing the situation (he didn't even call back to offer an explanation for the noise issues).  During checkout, my husband wound up having a second - and this time heated - discussion with him and another manager and - based on that discussion - we probably won't be staying at this hotel again as management didn't appear to have any real interest in proactively addressing (or even following up to explain) the reason for the issues.  Very reactive management team for sure - really disappointing especially given this is a JW Marriott. By the way, had the manager followed up and showed even a tiny bit of interest in explaining / addressing the situation (versus doing nothing and leaving it to my husband to bring the issue up again during checkout), this negative review could have been entirely avoided, and we probably would have rated this hotel as four stars."},{"name":"Fryday","address":"2883 Shaughnessy Street","city":"Port Coquitlam","stars":"4","text":"Worst service ever.

I ended up ordering the morning sunshine and berry godmother which both were so good, the berry godmother was more on the tart side but they both were sweetened to perfection, not too sweet and not too sour. It's weird because it has this thick creaminess to it but doesn't have like a distinct yogurt taste to it, idk what they put in their smoothies but they're crack. I did try a few sample of their raw juices, they're  pretty good, interesting combos like most raw juices. You can definitely taste the the natural ingredients and freshness but it's not as good as their smoothies ofc due to all the sugar that's probably in their smoothies lol If you're ever in Austin, you gotta try at least on their smoothies.

Not sure, but I've never been disappointed or been served anything inedible.  The trio of fish is always a winner, depending on whether you like the seasonal vegetables on that day.  I've had the scallops twice and they were expertly cooked - seared and lightly browned on the outside, rare on the inside, just like they should be.My husband had the lobster pappardelle, and it was savoury heaven!  The other thing I like about VFC is that they don't seem to dump dill all over everything \\"because it's seafood.\\"  Screw dill on seafood!  Bleah!

No one flavour dominated, it was just perfectly balanced, refreshing and tasty.Good location and service, yummy food and drink, what more could you want?  The patio is great, but even if your table is inside, it's a nice room with lots of visual interest.

Try to go on a weeknight or get there decently early.  Even if you get stuck in a line, though, hunger is the best condiment!  Your food will just taste that much better.

We went on Easter Sunday around 4 in the afternoon and they were not hugely crowded, but they are off 192 and not as visible as other places. So the first thing you notice is a couple old Ford's out front and then some nice automotive decorations inside. We were greeted upon entering and seated immediately. They have an extensive beer menu and they do flights. The menu itself is bound in leather and not too large. They specialize in hamburgers but have other wonderful items. There were 4 of us and we visited a few sections. I had the Chop Shop Salad, no onions or ranch. I went with Italian instead and it was excellent and filling. My first child had the Meat Loaf with white cheddar mashed potatoes and green beans and it was above and beyond. My other child had the Berries and Gorgonzola salad and it had a wonderful aroma and they said it was excellent. Their friend who was with us was going to have they basic cheeseburger but while reading the menu found the Jiffy Burger and made a face at the thought of it. I explained why it could be an interesting choice and they decided to try it. It is a cheeseburger with bacon and peanut butter. While it was a but messy they devoured it and we're glad they decided on it. I need to try it next time now. Make sure to visit the restrooms. Just saying.

There's a party of four came in and they were being seated right away. We asked the host and pointed at some empty tables at the lounge area and if we can take those. She basically said no with an attitude and she doesn't know when the tables will be ready for us. She asked if we want to go to their sister restaurant next door and stressed that they have kids menu. Are kids not welcome in this restaurant? No, we are here for the raw bar. I told her that we waited almost 2 hrs and she replied and say \\"No, it's only 1&1/2hrs.\\". Seriously????? We don't want to wait any longer and asked for two separate seating between a table and the bar area. She said ok and throw her pen down with an attitude.

As I read the reviews, my mouth was watering in anticipation of my visit.When I got there, I saw that the combinations during lunch (maybe that's their same menu all day) were priced a little higher than what I normally see, even at the chains, so I got 5 street tacos with the (asado type) beef.  I could tell that their ingredients were of good quality.  It's just that I didn't care for the preparation and the taste.  The street taco platter was o.k., but not memorable.  I also ordered a side of rice.  And it, too, was just o.k.The service was very amicable and expedient.  However, have you ever been to a Mexican restaurant where the food didn't come out quickly?  The place is quirky, with decorations from Mexico and, instead of watching some mindless TV show, they have what appears to be a travel documentary of Mexico showing in loop mode, so you get to see some really scenic places while you're eating your food.I now have to add my jerky L.A. styled comments.  This place is near the Silicon Forest and I was able to observe some intense hipster tech types come in for take out while I was there.  I have a feeling that this is sort of a place for those \\"in the know\\" in that general area and it cracks me up how, the whiter and paler the person, the more they like street food fare for which the heat is really turned up.  From what I've seen, this correlation appears to be hugely inverse.  (I'm sure Don Asado can deliver on the heat if a person wants them to.)   When I worked downtown, there was a guy I worked with who was a Nordic version of a younger Ron Howard with whom I'd have lunch once in a blue moon.  I wanted to go to Pioneer Place's food court, to a burger or pizza joint, or for the lunch specials at Brasserie Montmartre.  He wanted to go for Thai.  I told him I'd be out of commission after lunch if I did.  But he kept on and on, \\"but the sauces, the flavors, the spices ...\\"  And, here, this guy was about as interesting as watching paint dry but needed to have his food spiced to the hilt. He then got passive-aggressive on me and didn't bring up having lunch together anymore.  So, back to Don Asado, I think that there are some local folks and area employees who frequent this place because \\"it's really cool, man.\\"  To wrap up after some editorializing, I find that Don Asado is an o.k. place.  They are on a side street parallel to TV Highway and they are closed on Mondays, at least in winter. The employees are friendly and attentive.  Perhaps they have other menu items that are more interesting than what I had.  However, based on my visit and scanning the menu, it's a 3 star locale but I don't see myself returning because it's quite a ways from where I hang my hat."},{"name":"VINIA Wine & Kitchen","address":"444 West New England Ave, Ste 119","city":"Winter Park","stars":"5","text":"This is an amazing place with an an amazing couple running it.

The first I thought this could be a decent place to grab a bite to eat. The second time not so much. I wanted a sandwich and it had been a while since I ordered a tuna melt. Thinking this would be an easy thing for them to manage, i ordered the one off the menu. The menu didn't describe what I received. It didn't mention that not only would the sandwich be open faced, but that it would be served on a tower of 3 pieces of unevenly places cuts of white bread. They couldn't be cut into with a fork and knife, and if you can see from the photo, the sauce they used was on all sides of the bread, not allowing for me to fold it over and eat with my hands. What a mess. The cheese was barely melted on top. When I complained to the waiter, he said this was the way they served it here.The manager gladly comped the sandwich and I ordered something else. This was a couple of weeks back so all that I can really remember was the sandwich. I also found the restaurant a bit too corporate. The waiter seemed to be automated in his introduction, his recommendations and the very weird rewards card speech, which interrupted my conversation with my sister about my cancer recovery. He just walked up, dropped the check and started into this two minute spiel about the receipt acting as a invitation to receive benefits from the restaurant. When he later returned to take our payment, he didn't return with the receipt so we could sign up for rewards. Overall a substandard experience. I feel the kitchen, with my tuna melt, was trying to be a bit too creative. Sometimes a tuna melt is just a tuna melt. My mother, who happened to order a salad with shredded Brussels sprouts on my first visit. Happened to comment to me that she returned another time, ordered the same dish, it can out drastically different.

We had never been, so this was our first trip here, so we said so, and we were greeted just as warmly and explained the menu and process.  My wife and I decided on a meatball sub, small side salad and large combo with mushrooms, so sans the anchovies.  Salad came out, it was simple but plentiful, with plenty of dressing and then the meatball sub and  pizza.  It was glorious.  Toppings covered it, but it was balanced.  Meatball sub was great, nice dense meatball, with a great sweet tomato sauce covered in melted mozzarella.  They closed the sandwich while toasting it which makes the bread crisp yet chewy.  It was great.  So wonderful, I could only eat half, because the pizza was calling me. I'll say that my favorite pizza place in Columbus has been changed now.  Rubino's was that amazing.  The sauce, on the cracker thin crust was mesmerizing.  The in-house made sausage was sliced thin, like a ham, and spread over the pizza, the pepperoni makes little grease bathtubs.  The veggies were sliced thin, long ways and balanced the taste of everything.  This really made for a great experience.

It was missing a couple of layers that are usually present, but had a delightfully piquant quality and excellent sauce accompaniment.Ceviche Mixto was a huge mound of mixed seafood in a mildly spicy creamy lime sauce. The shrimp and fish were good, and the calamari was excellent.Pescado a la Chorrillana is a large serving of nicely battered and fried fish topped with onions, tomatoes and cilantro, and served with a mild sauce.

Allston Diner was the first brunch I had after moving to Boston and it stuck. I was hooked. I was a regular. The servers gave me a particular coffee mug (RBG, baby). I ate too much chicken and sausage gravy. I put too much syrup on that fluffy, crispy, delicious cornbread waffle. I had the servers roll me out on a dolly. I loved every single damn minute of it. Then, one day, the owner informed me that she was leaving. I was sad, but I didn't fully realize the catastrophic consequences of her decision.Today, I went to Allston Diner for the first time in about a month, which is the longest stretch of time I've gone without visiting. It pains me to report the following:- The food is awful. It's like they took every spice out of the kitchen. The fried chicken was utterly flavorless, as was the sausage gravy. How can you even make sausage gravy flavorless? This might be the most impressive change, simply because I had presumed it was impossible. If you like Eggos, you'll love the waffle! It's soggy, tasteless, and is reminiscent of something you'd have at a Best Western continental breakfast at 9:59 AM, just before they shut it down. Do you enjoy a nice bit of hot sauce with your meal? They have airplane bottles of Tabasco that will definitely completely satisfy that craving. Do you like your coffee bitter and never refilled? This place will be a dream come true.- The service is... sad. Not just \\"sad\\" as in poor quality, but sad on a deeper level - one that's accentuated by the memory of the truly amazing staff this place had before. The current servers are impersonal, inattentive, and have no life behind their eyes. In hindsight, maybe I should worry that they're being held captive.- The ambience is nonexistent. All of the energy and life in this diner has been exhaled, seemingly permanently.

We loved the peanuts, and since our entrees were taking longer than expected to arrive, ordered an additional portion. Such a unique flavor combination. On a whim, I ordered the Cha Ca \\"La Vong\\" (catfish) and it was absolutely phenomenal. The fish had a great fried exterior with a melt-in-your-mouth center. Peanuts, cilantro, and lime really helped tie the dish together. I had never had Thai catfish before, but I now crave it regularly!For the table, we also ordered the Papaya Pok Pok. This was not the best papaya salad I have had -- we did not finish the salad. It was very dry and could have used additional tamarind.

A very kind police officer hung out behind him for a bit for safety then decided to shove his car while in neutral into the center lane so he would decrease the likelihood of getting hit.  Eric R. and I stood in the hot sun watching it happen, then got Jeff L.'s car towed to the dealer.

Jeff L. got a half chicken and half jalapeno link, Eric R. and I got a 1/2 lb. of turkey, and Eric R. also got a half sausage link.

In summary: overpriced, terrible service and mediocre food. Read on if you want details.\\nIt has truly been a long time since I went somewhere and felt compelled to leave a bad review. Our family had raved about this place so we were excited to try it. They mentioned sometimes the service was not good if it was crowded, so we chose a Sunday afternoon and were please to see only 3 tables. Despite this, it took 10 minutes for someone to come over and that was just the start of it.. first they wouldn't accommodate meals for our children, then our food came and was,  I am sorry to say. so disgusting.. I am truly not a picky person but this was inedible. The chicken tasted like the bottom of a smoking pot. There was grease everywhere (see pictures). My kids' food was a grease fest too..  the manager did not apologize . She blamed the waiter for the slow service on being new and went on her way. To end it all, I got the bill and they had added an extra 2 meals and ran out card. Had I not asked for an itemized copy of my receipt I would've never known because it wasn't provided to begin with. So, all said and done we spent over 100 dollars for one of the worst eating experiences ever.

In all we ordered about 25-30 tacos as the bill after tax came out to about $120. This was an unexpected late night at the office and not a conference or meeting that we could have better prepared for. A gentleman introducing himself as a manager offered to carry the tacos out to our car for us. Then it became interesting. The manager basically as politely as possible became very offensive. He 'appreciated' our business but then proceeded to chew us out for placing such a large order on a Friday night and inconveniencing '50' customers. ( No way that many people was standing in line waiting for tacos. Additionally he complained that we didn't tip. I'm sorry, I'm a really good tipper and while I might have been nice and put 10% on the bill, this place is a casual fast serve joint not table service.   When you are paying $4 per taco and $2 per coke for a place that is basically an upscale Chipotle,  tipping should not be required. I've even read the business profile on Yelp! and they claim they pay their employees a decent wage.  Why the guilt trip then?The gaul of this manager was out of this world. I didn't say anything because I wasn't the person who organized and placed the order but I can assure you that I won't be inconveniencing anyone at Torchies Tacos again because I will never be returning.

The menu has plenty of options on there so I didn't feel like I was stuck with something. I ordered the meatloaf with a baked potato. I rarely order meatloaf at a restaurant as I love the one I make at home, but this was delicious! Really filling and perfect comfort food. My friends tried various things, such as the ribs, mac n cheese, burger, chicken and waffles...everyone loved all of it! No gluten free dessert option unfortunately (maybe I could have done a scoop of ice cream?). But honestly I was so full it didn't really matter. My friends all split the peanut butter pie and apple crumble. The peanut butter pie was the star!! That thing looked sooo good, and it was gone almost immediately.

Thanks to Michael L. for referring me to this lovely seafood restaurant! When one walks onto Granville Island, under the Granville Bridge, this is the first establishment you encounter on Anderson Street on the north side of the street. They have a beautiful outdoor patio area overlooking the water, with bright red umbrellas, and the restaurant interior has a wall of windows opening up to the patio and the harbor views. Truly lovely. Our server was friendly and very attentive. I'd love to give her a shout-out but she never introduced herself, so I never got her name. Despite this oversight, she was great. My kid loves oysters, so we started with a half dozen on the half shell. (We'd have preferred to get fewer, as they were really only for her, but you have to order a minimum of six). They were fresh and good. We shared the mixed grill, and all components of that dish were delicious and perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned: the salmon, the prawns and the scallops. All were wonderful. They offer an excellent selection of drinks here, including many cocktails. I tried two or their three offered sangria types and they both were great. Their dessert menu looked terrific, too, but we were too full. The food here is not inexpensive, but I don't think it wise to scrimp on seafood. It's important for it to be fresh and cooked well. And here, it was. Plus the ambiance and service was above par. This is a great place to go for a nice dinner, particularly if one is celebrating some event. Their happy hour menu looked enticing, offering decent prices on many drinks and small plates.

It routinely takes a half an hour for a latte here.  This place is actually based on GA, so it's an interesting study in chain coffee shops disguising their nonlocal origins.  Furthermore, they don't train their baristas properly.  This is pretty clear because they routinely use coffee beans that are far past their freshness window and can't foam milk to save their lives.  I once complained about buying a bag of coffee for nearly 20 dollars only to find out that it was a month old (past two weeks is usually getting bad for fancy coffee) and the barista symbolically placated me but had no intention of discounting anything at all.  She claimed that she'd speak to her manager.  Yeah.  Right.  Maybe you should get someone's contact info if you say something like that.  Otherwise it is an obvious empty gesture.  Screw this place.  Still, this place is the best in Lynn, which is on the rise lately.  I figure in like 3 years, someone will open an actual decent coffee shop here in Lynn and drive this place out of business.  I tolerate it because I'm looking for good coffee in Lynn but this place exposes more of its weaknesses with each visit.  Conclusion: about as good as a Starbucks, which, as far as coffee in MA goes, gives it a 5/10\\nI took extra points off for their horrible food.

For the wine we had a 2005 french burgundy that was excellent.My wife had the pasta and wild boar ragout which was excellent.  Not too heavy but great cold weather food.

The people do everything nice and purposefully. The Bloody Marys  showed up looking short and scarce. We looked at each other like ''ok, this is an unfunny joke - what airline are we flying?\\"  A single lime garnished a finely salted rim, but what they lacked in stature and flora was surprisingly made up for in pure flavor. The lime vodka brought out tremendous notes from the pepper, tomato, and everything else in the mix. The fine salt was surprisingly mild, and it was an all-around wonderful sipper. \\"Why not try the three egg omelet with figs, prosciutto and goat cheese?\\" That's a trick question - it's what I had to get. But if there is an answer, it would be because there is a plethora of other delicious choices - like Lobster and Avocado Benedict. No, I did not get that, although I sure wanted it. The side option of a garden salad is a very nice touch for any of us seeking to cut carbs, and it's also delicious. Wife went for a beautiful corned beef hash Benedict, which was a great choice itself. You might find yourself surrounded in conversations a little different than other places, and that would have something to do with being right next to the cradle of the highest tech learning around, MIT.

Prior to eating them, I thought, \\"Nope, I'm only going to eat one and a half, maybe two, but definitely not three.\\" I bit into the first sandwich, then proceeded to eat all three. The aroma of cinnamon, chili, garlic, flew through the air. The chili was rich, topped with a ton of shredded cheese.

We kind of decided to make some type of Korean food binge a tradition on NYD from now on. The place was empty except for one other table but I guess the holiday had something to do with it. Our server was very nice, friendly and fast. We had the dumpling appetizer and just loved the sauce. Our server brought out more of the sauce when we asked for it, once we got our bulgogi and spicy pork. All of the banchan were good, but we didn't get to have our favorite: pickled daikon. Maybe next time they'll have it :) But they did have spicy cubed radish and kimchi of course. Yum yum.The meat was tender and flavorful but we have to be honest - there is better meat at the place on Colonial that rhymes with.. Tin Lung. But Korea House is so close to where we live, we are definitely going back here more often. Plus it's cheaper than Tin Lung, despite the recent reviews stating that prices have changed. The added bonus? It doesn't stink and is very, very clean. (Tin Lung is the place you go to when you feel like smelling like smoke all day.

On the day we stopped by my \\"favorite book store\\" my daughter found 2 of her most sought after bucket list books but they were about 1/10th the retail price (Auggie and Me and also a Harry Potter Hard Back). My son begged me for an old Johnny Cash Album. Powell's has ton of gift items, new and used books and also a decent music section. Interesting side note... my parents attended a fundraising concert the year I was born and Mr. Cash and his lovely wife both asked my mother if they could hold me! She gleeful obliged and I have never been the same. As amazing as it is when I was about 5 my parent's took us to another Johnny Cash performance.

I was working at a home show nearby, and I had gone through my trusty yelp app with the woman in the next booth to see what was in the area other than the rip-off of a concession stand they had at the event.  We stumbled across this place and...surprise!  They had falafels!  I was all of a sudden in the mood for a falafel, but it was busy and we didn't have time to venture out.  Concession stand it was!  But oh no EP!  I didn't forget about you!  The next day was slower, and we were more beat up at work from the long hours, so we were taking longer breaks.  I ventured out in the snow, and finally spotted you,  unassuming, in a strip mall of all places!  You don't belong in a strip mall!  You deserve better!  After the very nice gentleman offered to explain the menu, I got to work and described what I wanted on my sandwich.  When I got to the end I had the choice of THREE different hummuses, and some ridiculous number of sauces.  I chose the burbon chipotle sauce.  I grabbed my free bag of pita chips from the rack (there's a yelp check in offer there), he explained to me how to eat my sandwich, and I was on my way.  Oh, you thought there was only one way to eat a sandwich didn't you?  Silly rabbit!  Nooo, they have special packaging there that allows you to eat without getting it everywhere!  I wasn't a huge fan of the pita chips, there were just alright.  They were homemade, and you could tell, with some of them not being cooked all the way and all.  I got the jalapeno cheddar, and I didn't care for the seasoning.  It was bland.  But if that was the worst part of my meal, bring it!

Because it's Texas, you city slicker - and because it should be against the law if you don't try Moonshine while you're in town.I had a meeting here during a work outing and we decided to grab dinner. The service was top-notch, and my waitress was a pleasure to talk with. She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu, even so far as to suggest each part of the meal and give examples of what you'd like based on taste. I grabbed a nice blonde ale while waiting for company, but eventually settled on the BBQ ribs with rosemary french fries. The ribs - which were a full rack - came in two huge portions (I don't have photos because I was focused on eating, fool). Each portion was bigger than both my giant man-sized fists combined and it fell off the bone. They use an apple-based BBQ sauce that makes the meat melt in your mouth. The fries were fresh and tasted delicious, but they lacked any sort of distinct rosemary flavor. All in all it was a great experience. We partook of a peanut butter pie slice for dessert that was big enough to feed the three of us plus some. Originally there was a wait for inside seating, so we sat out on the patio.
