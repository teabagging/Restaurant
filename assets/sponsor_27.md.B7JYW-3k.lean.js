Mostly, I've walked away with a bit of heart burn and a mean Mexican Martini induced buzz.  Let's start with the food- they serve up all your Tex-Mex standards like burritos and enchiladas but it's their monthly specials that really make the trip worth it.  What separates Trudy's from the rest of the Tex-Mex joints in town is their specials menu, some items were so popular that they made them standards.  One of which is still my favorite, the stuffed avocado.  It's a deep fried avocado (yes, I said deep fried) that's stuffed with chicken then covered with your favorite sauce (mine is Verde) then covered with what I call \\"Texas Glue\\" (Jack cheese).  I really like the way that dish is prepared and always leaves me satisfied.  One thing that really does bug the heck out of me though, is the fact that they serve your side salad in the same plate, which is scalding hot!  Who the hell likes hot lettuce?  ~argh~   Try the \\"Borracho\\" (durnk) beans, they're deelish.  \\n\\nReason number two why I end up at Trudy's is their happy hour in their funky upstairs bar.  Order their legendary Mexican Martini, but I recommend getting tequila that is not their house pour.  Try the Herradura Silver!  If you're there for happy hour, I highly recommend their fajita nachos and the chicken flaquitas.

The server without even apologizing took the pita from the table, put it back in the plate and left the table. One of my friends who got disgusted to eat the pita bread that fell on the table and asked to replace it.

I ordered online and noted in the instructions that I had a $5 coupon.\\n\\nWhen the food did arrive (late, taking about an hour and 20 minutes) I saw that the receipt did not reflect the coupon. I called in to straighten it out and got progressively upset as I was told that I did get the discount, then that it didn't apply to deliveries, then that it didn't apply to online orders.  The coupon of course says none of that.  They wouldn't reimburse me $5 to my credit card but said that they would next time.  I really disliked being lied to, as the story kept changing with every sentence that came out of their mouths.  I didn't see the same friendly service that other reviews saw.\\n\\nNever ordering again from here isn't a big deal either.  My wife and I both agreed that the food was bland, and not just in a spicy hot sort of way.  The pakora was dry, the naan soggy.  I thought the saag was ok, but other than that everything was just disappointing.  I even thought the mint chutney was blah.  I had put in the instructions to add extra mint chutney but didn't see it as a big loss that there wasn't.\\n\\nThe pictures of the place looks clean, and we were hoping for something better.  Definitely not ordering from them again."},{"name":"Avalon Diner","address":"16106 Marsh Rd","city":"Winter Garden","stars":"4","text":"The food is decent, but the reason I only gave it two stars is because their portions are ridiculously small. Twice I have ordered take out breakfast and both times portions were ridiculous. The home fries and hash browns aren't enough to feed a child. The side order of bacon gets you two strips of bacon, same as the sausage. The toast and muffin were almost burnt both times and barley had butter on them. Each omelette meal is about $9, plus bacon/ sausage $3, for two meal comes out to $23, but for the price portions seem very cheap.

We were told my the (very rude) hostess that she wasn't even \\"close to ready\\" for us.  So we grabbed some seats at the bar, figuring we'd have a drink.  It took 15 minutes for us to be greeted by the bartender.  The bartender was very slammed as he was the only one there, so we understood at first.  However, the manager (Sam) kept coming behind the bar to try to help, and he got into an altercation with the bartender which lead to the manager saying \\"I'm the manager I'll do whatever I want.\\"  The only reason I know his name was Sam is the bartender repeatedly said \\"Sam, Sam, Sam\\" over and over again while he was arguing with him.  Not exactly the ambiance we were looking for.  We were finally sat at our table around 7:45 and told it would be 15-20 minutes before a server could greet us.  So we sat there awkwardly at a table in the middle of the restaurant, no one even offered us water until we got up and asked.  Once we were finally greeted by a server, it took another 20 minutes for her to take our order (she never actually asked us if we wanted drinks) and then about another 30 minutes before the food came out (which was underwhelming and mostly burnt).

You can watch them cook everything in the open kitchens, and vegetarians take heart: there is a totally separate kitchen where they cook veggie dishes.\\n\\nOn the minus side, the atmosphere is closer to a high school cafeteria than a real restaurant - don't go here if you're looking for a swank place to impress a client, but a group of close friends can have a great time.

The show was hilarious, offering a range of comedians with different styles, the drinks were very tasty and interesting, and the food was delicious.  It was a great night.\\n\\nAmbience:\\nIt's a restaurant in a brewery (affectionately called a warehouse by the performers).  Cozy, a touch of rustic, and with a large hook(?) hanging over our heads, it was simplistic done in a very hipster way.  The stage was small, but close and personal.  There are a few long tables where everyone sat together in their respective groups and a bar.\\n\\nShow:\\nVery solid show by the Liquid Courage Comedy Club.  They offered many comedic styles, giving us a range to choose our favorite performer to choose from.  Many raunchy jokes, but, hey, what did you expect?  It was great.\\n\\nFood & drinks:\\nI came here for the comedy show, so was not expecting to be so happy with the food!  The groupon came with two cheese pizzas (other toppings cost more).  We ordered:\\nCheese Pizza: the best I've had in a while.  The pizzas were smaller and thin, but not paper-thin.  The cheese was so nicely cooked, more cooked than others - which I enjoyed since the charred touch works so nicely.  It was cheesy, but not oily at all, the ultimate metric of a great pizza.\\nBasil Pesto: it was made with pesto, tomatoes, mozzarella, with a balsamic drizzle - copied from their menu.  It was so good!  Always a fan of pesto, but that balsamic drizzle was slightly sweet, which offered a great balance.  Perhaps it was a touch too sweet, but I definitely left wanting more of it!\\nDrinks: we had a flight of 8 drinks, which I don't remember all the names to.  But their sours were very nice (peach-flavored one; passion-fruit seasonal offering).  They also had a coffee-flavored on that was surprisingly good as well.

I go to eat good food for a reasonable cost.  wagamama failed on both those counts.\\n\\nI ordered the Beef Massaman Curry, described as \\"...in a mild, fragrant massaman curry sauce...\\" The dish was anything but \\"mild\\".  I've enjoyed massaman curry dishes from Thai restaurants, and while they occasionally have a little zest, I'd not say this curry is a hot sauce elsewhere. I mentioned this to our server and she acknowledged that wagamama's version is indeed hotter than the usual Thai fare (she'd worked in a Thai restaurant before).  Even after mixing in the entire bowl of rice, I was unable to tame the heat enough to eat it.  When the manager came over at the end of the meal and asked how we'd enjoyed it, I told him how hot it was, and he also acknowledged that in his estimation, the heat was comparable with one of their hottest dishes, Firecracker shrimp (\\"a fiery mix of [ingredients] and red hot chilies\\"). The menu's description of the massaman curry as \\"mild\\" is significantly misleading.   Beyond that, the quantity of beef in the dish was unexpectedly small, given the $16.25 price tag, and not a good value for the money.\\n\\nThe Mrs. ordered the Chicken Raisukaree with no peppers and no red chilies, for $14.50.  In spite of the no-chilies order, she also had an exceptionally spicy dish, and with only five and a half small chunks of chicken.  Due to the heat, she also was unable to finish, and she was similarly unimpressed with the portion size.\\n\\nThe manager comped my meal, and I suspect he might have comped my wife's if she'd complained instead of just saying she was finished, so overall I'm satisfied with how we were treated by the staff.\\n\\nBut again, on both counts of flavor and portion size for the cost, wagamama's didn't meet our expectations.

There is a pho joint, the Shalin Noodle Restaurant, a tacky sushi spot, and - finally - Peaceful Restaurant. Like many people who have dined here recently, I heard about this little cranny of a restaurant from Yelp and was excited to discover that a decent Chinese eatery has opened in the False Creek/Fairview area. \\n\\nWe asked our perky and assertive server (who has a serious weakness for pork belly) for recommendations, since the menu is extensive and intimidating. We didn't order everything that she suggested, since most of it involved (you guessed it) pork belly, but we did order the Beef Roll, the Ginger Eggplant, the Sesame Chicken, the Szechuan Noodles with dao xiao mian, and the Pork Belly with Cabbage (which our waitress *made* us order). This is a Mandarin, northern Chinese restaurant, so they use wheat-based, hand-cut noodles made in-house, which are available as small \\"cat ears\\" (mao er duo), long sheared strands (dao xiao mian), or thick hand-dragged strands (cu mian). The noodles are often al dente, and they held Peaceful's sauces very well.\\n\\nThe Beef Roll appetizer was probably my favourite item, although every dish was fresh and clean. The Roll's paper-thin five-spiced beef, crisp green onions and sweet hoisin sauce were united and enrobed by a light, flavourful pancake. It was like a Chinese burrito! My second favourite was the Pork Belly and Cabbage (!), which had an incredible texture. Mixing thin slices of marbled pork belly with wide swatches of pressed tofu, leeks, garlic, onion and green onion resulted in a gustatory adventure filled with crunch and spongy succulence.\\n\\nThere is so much on the menu that our table wanted to order, so I'll have to go back.

Waste of time/money."},{"name":"Grant Park Coffeehouse","address":"753-A Cherokee Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Its reviews like this that makes me wanna review a place without having to give it stars... b/c I really wanted to add another \\"5 stars\\" to their high reviews. But unfortunately I can't... I'll do the summary first:\\n\\nSUMMARY: Nice spot, great local neighborhood place that has a large variety of foods. Great service, great prices. Seems to be a good bit of healthy options (and natural type options).  All (or most) things are made fresh onsite-- gotta love that! I think your food ratings will depend on what you get and how hungry you are when you go. If you go there and get a lunch-- sandwich, chips, drink, and dessert you'll probably love it. If you start mixing and matching too much like me... you may be a little disaapointed. \\n\\nD E T A I L S. . . . . \\n\\nLOCATION: I will it admit, It was a little journey getting there... had to hop on 85, get off on MLK/Turnerfield, etc etc ended up on Memorial Drive, passed by Tin Lizzys, Ria's Bluebird, The Jane, etc... then ended up in the cutest little neighborhood. Passed Grant Park, then literally across the street from the main entrance/parking for The Zoo lies Grant Park Coffeehouse. I thought it would be an overcrowded super small place, with hard to find parking, but it wasn't. It's right at the corner and there's a lot of parking on the street (and about 4 spaces in a little \\"lot\\" of some sort on the side.)\\n\\nDECOR: Simple, classic coffeehouse. Matches the style of the neighborhood. Cute old-school mini mural outside on the brick. A few tables, I think just two outdoor tables to eat, about 2 or 3 inside tables, and a small \\"lunch counter\\" type area w/ 3-4 stools. \\n\\nSERVICE: Great! The ladies were so nice and sweet. Please keep it up, it's great to see smiling faces and great attitudes when trying a new establishment. \\n\\nFOOD: (I got a few things)\\n-- Grant Breakfast Pocket: this was just okay... definitely like hot pocket, but bigger. I may have liked it more if the bread was a bit more soft, like a soft golden flaky type crust. ($3.50 or so, I think...)\\n\\n-- Smoothie: they have all kinds of flavors and you can make your own. Unfortunately they had no Strawberry that day, so I got Raspberry mixed with banana, and it was too sweet. I should have added blueberries or something to make it more bitter, evening out the taste. Their smoothies are made from some type of puree (what I was told), so the texture  (once mixed with water and ice) is more of a liquid slushy type texture opposed to a thick smoothie (made from fruit).  It taste like a slushy too, a fruity slushy. (around $3/$4)\\n \\n-- Chocolate Chip Cookie: not my favorite. I like softer cookies, this is the hard thick large kind... not the subway kind that can be heated up and made soft. ($1.50 I think)\\n\\n-- Turkey Wrap: the highlight and redeeming savior for me. I've had so many bad wraps over the past year, the last bad one I had was from Chickfila-- yuck. Hard and dry and bad. This was soooo delicious and fresh, and all around amazing. I was gonna tell  them to make it into a sandwich instead since I've been having so much bad luck with wraps, so glad I didn't... this was mm mm good. ($6)\\n\\n-- Strawberry Shortcake Ice cream: it looked amazing. But was just okay. I'm a fanatic for Ben and Jerry's strawberry cheesecake ice-cream, so that's what I thought of when I first saw it. But the taste are worlds apart. \\n\\n\\n\\nOTHER: I got the LoafDeals for Grant Park CoffeHouse, and there was supposedly also a Groupon Deal too. The Groupon Deal notes that there are limitations/stipulations, but Loafdeals does not. So when I presented my coupon she told me that you get $5 off each visit for 4 visits (opposed to $20 at once). I guess that's there way of trying to bring you in there more than once, but honestly it's pretty silly and makes no real sense. If that's a rule they want they should be 100% certain to have that in the description of there coupon deal before buying it, otherwise it's like a \\"bait and switch\\". \\n\\nI would also advise them to include their entire menu on the website, maybe updating  it quarterly or even just once a year. The website gives  very general view of what they have, but their menu is actually quite huge-- all kinds of drinks, desserts, sandwiches, etc. Upon entering I only looked at the menu on the wall behind the main counter/cashier. But low and behold there was an even bigger menu on the wall behind me."},{"name":"Bakersfield","address":"733 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"With a bit of trepidation, I visited Bakersfield with a few friends for dinner tonight.  \\n\\nOur server, Allison, was great.  She was easy to talk to, knowledgeable about the food, and she checked on us just often enough.  Big bonus points!\\n\\nThe house margarita at $6 was great.  It leaned a bit on the sour side; however, given how so many establishments land firmly on the sweet side with drinks, I didn't mind.  \\n\\nChips & queso with added chorizo highlighted the appetizer round.  The guacamole was certainly reasonable and worth ordering.\\n\\nMy only (slight) issue was with the tacos.  Of the eight tacos on the menu, most were $4 each for a 5- or 6-inch diameter taco.  I was more surprised that 75% of the tacos included pickled red or white onions.  For me, when taking into account my margarita, the meal certainly favored my sour taste buds.  \\n\\nTo be fair, two tacos plus half an appetizer was plenty of food.  Three tacos by themselves would make for a reasonable meal.  \\n\\nI was happy we sat at a \\"real\\" table with chairs that had backs to them.  The whiskey barrel tables surrounded by stools give character to the place, but they didn't look terribly comfortable.  \\n\\nFinally, the word \\"whiskey\\" is included in the restaurant window, yet the drink section of the menu has no mention of whiskeys at all.

If you are familiar with other Taiwanese restaurants in Atlanta, Bento and Kan Pai, usually those are a bit old-fashioned large family restaurants located in the suburbs where you get large quantities on the cheap.\\n\\nAh-Ma's is quite different, in that it is located near Piedmont Park in a busy shopping center next to Trader Joe's. and is very small (10 or less tables) in size. You will notice if you go during any weekend time, that it will be very busy, so it's been pretty successful in hitting a unique niche in midtown. \\n\\nAs for the food itself, one might look at the menu and think that it is really cheap, but I would view the menu more like tapas or tacos than full meals, so expect to order at least 2-3 items per person if you want to feel full. The first thing I always order in any Chinese/Taiwanese restaurant is hot and sour soup. Obviously hot and sour soup isn't really \\"Taiwanese\\" but nevertheless its fresh and not overly salty (which happens when the soup has been in a pot for too long and the water's boiled off).\\n\\n we ordered was the chicken nuggets, a staple of cheap Taiwanese food. The nuggets themselves are tasty, although having  varieties of dipping sauces would make it a lot more flavored. As for the main attraction, the baos are fairly tasty, whether its pork belly or fried chicken bao the meat with the bao itself has more of a thicker, fuller taste than tacos as the bao itself is more doughy and thick. It's Taiwanese street food served in a very clean, simple manner.\\n\\nPrice wise, it came out a little over $15 per person, which is  on the expensive side for what is essentially street food, but its worth a try for the novelty of eating at something other than tacos/tapas once in awhile."},{"name":"Buk Kyung II","address":"151 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"3.5","text":"(My review might be a bit dated, since I had last been there 3-4 years ago, so maybe it got better) Sad to say, but for the longest time this place gave me the impression that all Korean food is supposed to be bland. \\n\\nMy friends and I always gave the restaurant the benefit of the doubt if we had a previously unpleasant food experience, but we always end up regretting the decision to try their food again.

This wasn't the case. The salad  bar was was half empty and you can't even compare this salad bar with the Fogo De Chao's salad bar. The hot bar was not a bar at all, there was white rice, green beans, black beans and a couple of fried plantains.\\n\\nAnd the meat. The meat was chevy even though I've tried medium well parts as well as medium and rare pieces. I did not enjoy their meat except the chicken parts. But I would hate to pay $30 to eat chicken. I still can't believe people compared this place with Fogo De Chao. Especially for price, I would much prefer to pay $50 and enjoy every piece of meat than paying $30 and only to enjoy the chicken.. Also during the time I stayed I didn't get to try many of the meats on the menu, and I found myself waiting for awhile for the meat to come..\\n\\nAnother thing was, on the menu there was a note that said, if you were to being wasteful with your food, a %15 percent would be added to your bill.. I was amazed! People go to these kind of places to taste everything and to eat the pieces they want, not because they want to eat sparingly.\\n\\nMy suggestion is, if you want to experience a Brazilian Steakhouse, keep your $30 and save $20 more and go to Fogo De Chao for the perfect experience where the meat keep on coming, where they replace your mashed potato and cheese balls more than you want, where the salad bar is always full with quality stuff like parmesan cheese, smoked salmon etc, and where they don't tell you not to be wasteful since you are spending a lot of money.

My dad's made yearly trips to Columbus since before I was born for Origins. He's gotten one of the cool collectible pint glasses every damn year. We've quite a collection growing. I could tell you stories going back years of the experiences I've had at Barley's, but instead I'll just list how I feel.\\n\\nFood:\\n- Sauerkraut Balls: What a classic! I order it every time. Nothing like fried sauerkraut, some mustard and a cold beer.\\n- Burgers: I've built my own and I've ordered the Clevelander. These babies are hefty, but they're for some reason never cooked to my liking. Always a tad overcooked with not enough pink. However, it's never been sent out like a hockey puck so I don't make a huge fuss. \\n- Mac & cheese: the bomb diggity. I absolutely loathe tomatoes but their mac and cheese is one dish I'll actually eat them with. The sauce is mostly white cheddar so the tomatoes are a nice contrast. My only complaint is that I never seem to have enough of it!\\n- Fish & Chips: they're okay. They do it well enough for an American restaurant. The batter is too heavy for me, but there's a lot of food for the price. Also, they never seem to give enough tartar sauce. I want alllll the sauce.\\n\\nBeer:\\n-Christmas Ale: my third favorite winter beer, after Great Lakes Christmas and Madtree's Thundersnow. It's the perfect beer to get me from tipsy to sloshed after a Blue Jackets game. (Depending on how the game went, sloshed is sometimes the goal.)\\n- Blood Thirst Wheat: I hate fruit, but I don't mind orange infused beer. (Moerlein's Blood Orange IPA is the only pale ale I'll drink). It's nice and refreshing for those summer months where Barley's AC is hit or miss.\\n- Russian Imperial Stout: my non-summer go to. It's a typical stout and does what it's supposed to. I appreciate its consistency as a beer.\\n\\nService:\\nHit or miss. Some days you can tell the servers are overwhelmed and you want to give them a pass, but other days it just feels like they know they're going to get their money either way so they don't give a damn about being nice to you. I've never had an outstanding experience with a a server, but I've never had a truly horrible experience. It's just kind of blah.\\n\\nI'll continue to visit Barley's.

It never hurts to mix in a little beer with dinner on a family trip. Plus the restaurant appeared family friendly.\\n\\nFortunately one of my roommates from college, who now lives in the Columbus area, was able to join us for dinner. I asked him to meet us at 5pm for an early dinner and I'm glad I did. We actually didn't arrive until after 5:15, but he was able to secure a table in the crowded restaurant for our group of 5. It seems there was a Columbus Blue Jackets game that night at the nearby Nationwide Arena and a good chunk of the crowd was obviously headed that way.\\n\\nThe inside of Barley's is not very large, but they have managed to pack in a bunch of tables along the front and right sides, along with the back corridor.  There is also a large bar with plenty of beers on tap. I started with their Centennial IPA, which I thought was a pretty darn good beer. I also later sampled one of their Russian Imperial Stouts, which was also good. I didn't enjoy the RIS as much as the IPA, but both are worthy of ordering again.\\n\\nFor dinner I went with the Jamaican Me Chicken sandwich which combines jerk seasoned grilled chicken breast with Jamaican relish and pepper-jack cheese ($9.99). The chicken was a double breast and was well cooked. I was hoping for a little more spice from the jerk seasoning, but overall the sandwich was good. For my side dish I chose their cheddar and potato pierogies. I think this was my first experience with pierogies. Unfortunately it might be my last experience with them though, as these didn't really do much for me. Overall they were fairly bland and uninteresting.\\n\\nMy old friend had The Wedge salad - crisp iceberg lettuce wedge with diced tomatoes, smokey bacon bits, balsamic marinated cherry tomatoes, red onion and crumbled gorgonzola bleu, then drenched with our bleu cheese dressing and a drizzle of balsamic reduction ($6.29). This salad looked really good and from what I'm told it tasted great too. I'm intrigued by the balsamic reduction that is added to the other somewhat typical wedge salad toppings.\\n\\nMy wife had the Turkey Nut burger - ground turkey seasoned with parmesan and herbs, topped with pecans, and served with spicy mayo - Barley's classic for nearly two decades ($9.79). She chose to have a side salad for $1.29 extra, but it was a pretty large and fresh salad. I didn't try any of the burger, but again I'm told that it was a good sandwich. We also had orders of kid's cheeseburger and grilled cheese (both $4.99).\\n\\nOur service was actually much quicker than I was expecting from the crowded restaurant and bar.

I then called the restaurant  to pre-order the Hot Chocolate Lava Cake which requires 30-minutes notice.  I asked if I would need to tell the server about the dessert again when we were there.  I was assured that no, and also they would note that it was a surprise. I clarified that yes, all of it, including the reservation itself, was a surprise.  I thanked her for understanding and noting this.\\n\\nOur waiter mentioned BOTH surprises to my husband.  He mentioned the ship cruise mere minutes after we sat down.  I gave him a 'shut up' look and he seemed to get it, as he walked away looking a little ashamed.   I think I was wrong...halfway through the meal, he asked if he should put in for the Hot Chocolate Lava Cake.  Nice.  My husband just laughed.\\n\\nIt was funny...on the other hand, I had really planned this day and wanted to enjoy some moments which I didn't get because of this one, incompetent person.\\n\\nAdditionally, when we ordered, he used our menus to note what we ordered.

I don't know if that has to do with there being a lot of people packed into a little place or those infamous copper pots hanging all over the walls making it look like your Italian grandmother's kitchen.\\n\\nI am a big fan of lots of tomato sauce, and they put more than an adequate amount on their food.

The food and drink lived up to what our friend said.  It was ok and reasonably priced for downtown.  The chips and salsa were very good and I like the fact that every person gets their own bowl of salsa.  We had the tacos.  Tasty.  I had a domestic beer and my husband had red wine.  My husband and I were in the downtown area looking for a place to go for appetizers and light drinks before a concert on Friday, Oct. 4, 2013. Between 6 - 6:30pm.  Initially we passed this place but saw someone we knew near this restaurant who recommended it for the $5 margaritas and the tacos which were half price during happy hour.  We were greeted by the hostess (good) and we told her that we would sit at the bar.  The female bartender (don't remember seeing a name tag) came over almost immediately and greeted us (good) and asked what she could get for us.  She explained what food and drink was at happy hour prices and gave us a menu.  She took our order, brought us our drinks and never came back for anything else.  It wasn't like her shift ended and she left.  She was in the bar area the whole time we were there but just decided to ignore us.  While we were waiting for our food, 2 guys that she knew and apparently all the other wait staff knew too, came in and sat at the bar next to us.  She laughed and talked with them and when our food came, the head bartender (I'm guessing) asked who the food belonged to and she motioned in our direction.  He brought us the food and went on about his other bartending duties.  This is happening right in front of us.  She continues to talk to these other 2 patrons.  She went outside a couple of times, came back in and talked to these 2 patrons some more, had a drink herself, talked to the other barthender but never said another thing to us.  We finished our food and drink and actually wanted to order another drink but she never asked.  The other bartender who gave us our food eventually came over and said, \\"you guys are mighty quiet. Everything ok?\\"  We said yes and my husband had a question about the wine which the bartender answered and he ordered another glass of wine.  I ordered nothing else and was second guessing our decision to venture in at this point.  At this time we also told the male bartender that we were ready for our bill which he brought when he brougt after he brought the second glass of wine.  Needless to say, the tip was miniscule based on the service we got.  But here's a tip to other consumers:  You may want to think carefully about spending your hard earned in a place where you're basically ignored.  The hostess thanked us on the way out and said have a good evening.  This review should be higher because of the other employees but I can't do it.  I've worked in customer service most of my adult life and just can't get past being ignored no matter how good the food is or what other employees may have done."},{"name":"Sweet Carrot","address":"1417 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Good not great.

Cold mashed potatoes??\\n\\nI got a couple of bites worth of 5-6 items and most of it was actually decent.  \\n\\nWe were ready for the hot sides and meat, though, and sat for about 10 minutes before the first selection (rump) was brought out. \\n\\nThe \\"meat supplier\\" was very knowledgeable - more so than the oriental owners and our waitress (she was really just awful and didn't know much English).  Eventually, the only items we failed to see were the chicken hearts and bacon wrapped filet (unfortunately).  \\n\\nPerhaps, the one thing that they REALLY failed at were the hot sides.  There was no fried polenta or warm mashed potato.  Instead, there was fried banana (not that great when compared to others), potato STICKS, white rice, and black beans.  Yes, those last three items I mentioned are correct.  They literally had potato sticks - like the kind you buy in a can at the grocery store.  And, yes, black beans and rice.  No seasoning on the rice and black beans were straight from a can.  So incredibly cheap and tacky.  \\n\\nI could go into other details, but it's not worth it.  The meal just wasn't worth the cost - even with a travelzoo or scoutmob discount.  I'll stick to paying for a decent slab of meat that comes with sides that are also enjoyable.\\n\\nBTW, I only mentioned ethnicity since this is a Brazilian restaurant and most other similar restaurants actually have some Brazilians working those restaurants.

Fast forward to this week when my husband and I were up near Easton-- we decided to venture out to Drelyse again based on the awesome Yelp reviews. We had just as amazing service (and food) with just the two of us walking in off the street as I did with my big group of students studying African literature. \\n\\nThis time, I ordered the beef and peanut butter soup and it was fantastic-- a little bit of a kick but not super spicy (I'm not a big fan of hot-spicy food). I ordered mine with white rice, but I think it'd be even better with the jollof rice or fufu (like a soft dumpling). If you want to eat your meal with your hands, the owner will bring over a wash basin for you to wash your hands at the table. My husband ordered the goat stew with jollof rice and the rice was delicious-- I think I'll be getting that next time! You can get the jollof plates (rice, tomatoes, onions, and a little side salad) with beef, goat, or chicken, and you can also sub in chicken or goat in the peanut butter soup. I heard the owner discussing whole fish tilapia with some other customers on the phone (they also do carryout!) but it seemed like most people dining in were ordering joffa plates or peanut butter soup, too. \\n\\nDrinks are served from a cooler: water bottles, bottled juices, ginger beer, beer (including Tusker)."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"3640 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"My boyfriend and I went today (a Thursday) at 11:30 a.m. and there was actually an empty table!

There are 5-6 options under each category. \\n\\nWe order the Arancini ($5) and the peppers and sausage ($5). Both were good - but the arancini left a little to be desired. For our meals, we ordered pasta. I got the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese (half order $13) and my husband got the Ravioli (full $26). We had asked the waitress when she took our order what the difference between the half and the full was. She indicated that the half was served on a bread plate and the full on a regular plate. The was exactly the case - the full seemed like the same amount of food as the half only on a bigger plate.  However, I must say that the food was very good. \\n\\nWe completed our meal with the Crostada ($8) - a warm apple costada with vanilla ice cream. Also good. The bill for the two of us for two antipasti's and two pasta dishes, along with one coke (I had water) and a dessert - was $63. With our groupon we paid $25 with tip.

But this was no ordinary hotel, in no ordinary city, and may have been my favorite part about my visit to Portland. I was traveling alone for work, and the hardest thing about eating at Clyde Common was not having someone next to me to gush about each of the plates of food I tried.\\n\\nI sat at the bar and became enamored by the bartender as I watched his careful preparation of some of the most interesting cocktails I've seen. I didn't try one and opted for a tasty local IPA instead, but watching the precision and details of spraying each drink with the lemon zest oils certainly made me want one. \\n\\nThey had many vegetarian and some vegan options which always scores big for me. I decided to have two small plates so I could try more than one thing. My dreamy bartender recommended the seasonal vegetable platter (highlighted here: http://bit.ly/mUdetP) and although I was hesitant about it being exciting, I wanted to lick the plate clean when I finished. It had poached pears, pickled root veggies, and was lightly smothered in this delicious sweet yogurt sauce...sweet and savory. \\n\\nNext I ordered the broccoli rabe with ham, egg, and pistachios. Sounded like an interesting combo (like many of their menu items) and all their meats are hormone-free, grass-fed, etc. so I went for it. It was another masterpiece that surprised me with the egg debuting as soft boiled, rolled in bread crumbs, and deep fried. It was perfection...crispy on the outside, yolk spilling all over once I dug in. The rabe was perfectly cooked and the ham added a nice salty touch with hints of the pistachios.\\n\\nThe atmosphere here is warm, but crisp and simple. The bartender was friendly, but stoic and dressed to perfection. The menu is innovative with the resulting food a pleasant surprise to your palate."},{"name":"Jiko - The Cooking Place - Temporarily Unavailable","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I admit it. I'm a food snob. I'm also a wine snob, and I'm a stickler for proper service. I don't expect five star dining when we go to IHop at three am, but if I'm dropping a lot of money on a meal, I want it to deliver. Jiko does. It is, without a doubt, my favorite restaurant in Orlando, and in my top ten list in the country. When we have out of town guests who are foodies, this is where we go. When we want to celebrate, this is where we go, and when we just want an incredible meal...you guessed it.\\n\\nAfter reading a lot of the reviews here, I feel I need to address a couple of things. First of all, it's 'Jiko', not 'Jiko's'. The name is neither plural nor possesive. Second, yes, the filet with mac and cheese is good. However, you are wasting the opportunity to taste some out of this world, imaginitive cuisine if you don't step out of your comfort zone. Get a steak at Del Frisco's or Bern's; try something different at Jiko.\\n\\nThe menu changes seasonally, but the last time we were in they had a market salad with a perfectly poached egg on top that was to die for. The flatbreads are always good, and the chef's special never fails to please. If that doesn't appeal to you, try the BBQ chicken with caramelized onions and a four cheese blend.\\n\\nThe wild boar was the stuff that foodie dreams are made of, served over a polenta-like starch called 'mealie pap' and surrounded with a tomato-onion sauce and finished with white truffle oil.  The Taste of Africa is a trio of breads and three or four different dips that is a great introduction to Southern African cuisine, which is heavily Indian influenced. Some are spicy, so be aware.\\n\\nIf you are a carnivore, the short ribs served over a truffled potato puree are insanely good. The ribs aren't fatty and fall apart at the touch of a fork, and the potatoes are heaven.  I normally don't order chicken in restaurants, but one of our less adventurous friends did, and it was spectacular. Crushed potato, perfectly cooked green beans and a mango chutney were just right with the peri-peri rub on the chicken, which was savory and delicious without being spicy.\\n\\nThe duck is exceptional; breast meat cooked med rare and served over a mix of spinach, potato and mushrooms that have been tossed in a ridiculously good, slightly spicy curry. The plate is finished with a port wine reduction that made me want to go into the kitchen and kiss the saucier.   The perfectly cooked shrimp in a coconut cream curry were served with the most outrageous, aromatic basmati rice I've ever encountered. However....if I were to have one last meal on earth, it would be the halibut at Jiko. It's lightly dusted with corn flour and then cooked to perfect, crisp happiness. It's served over seasonal roasted vegetables and the plate is surrounded with a tomato buerre blanc that is as close to heaven that I've come.\\n\\nDesserts change pretty often, but the last time we were there we had a coconut bread pudding that had us battling over the last bite and something called 'just one cup', which was a gorgeous chocolate mousse shaped like a coffee cup with a tuille cookie 'spoon', chocolate shaving 'steam', white and brown cookie 'sugar cubes' and a little cream pitcher filled with a chocolate sauce to pour as you wished. Imaginative and delicious.\\n\\nThe wine list is exceptional, and they offer a great selection by the glass. The sauvignon blancs are particularly good, as are the chenins, which South Africa is known for. South Africa does a good job with syrah and cab., but the merlots are, in my opinion, less than stellar. The service staff is incredibly well-versed about the wine list. Give them an idea of what you enjoy and what you want to spend and you'll be pleasantly surprised at what they will come up with. Don't be afraid to try something different. South African wines are very affordable and a good bang for your buck.\\n\\nThe room is beautiful, and if you make a later reservation you don't run as much of a risk of being seated next to a family with a stroller as you do earlier. They ask that gentlemen wear collared shirts, and I was thrilled to overhear the hostess ask a man to remove his baseball cap. Apparently, hats aren't allowed in the dining room! What a pleasant surprise to see that some places still hold people to certain standards of decorum. Now if they could just force people to check their cell phones at the door.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nI've rea"},{"name":"Rontoms","address":"600 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Was a little worried about the whole 'hipster' vibe based on the reviews, but this place was awesome!\\n\\n4 beers and delicious tomato soup with a grilled cheese sandwich for $20.

Located on west 4th and Tragalfar in the heart of Kitsilano, Q4 serves an array of  Italian cuisine.  This is a great place to bring your first date or your girlfriend. The d√©cor and ambiance of the restaurant is classic and vintage yet romantic and seductive -  rustic iron chandeliers, candlelight mahogany tables and a beautifully hand painted floor. The entreprenurs behind Q4 recently opened their sister restaurant, Q4 al Centro, at the L'Hermitage Hotel in downtown Vancouver.\\n\\nThe pasta night features 10 different delicious pasta from their menu for only $10 on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday evenings. Below are the selections:\\n\\nSpaghetti Q4- For Italians only\\nFettuccine Ghiottone - Fettuccine with minced chicken, brandy and cream\\nGarganelli Arrabiatta - Garganelli with pancetta, mushrooms, fresh tomatoes and peperoncino\\nFusilli con Rucola - Handmade fusilli with shaved beef tenderloin, arugula, fresh tomato and parmigiano reggiano\\nLinguine Frutti di Mare - Linguine with fresh daily seafood in a white wine, sundried tomato cream with peas\\nFettuccine ai Funghi - Fettuccine with wild mushrooms, minced chicken and pancetta in a rosato sauce\\nGarganelli Vegetariano - Garganelli with chick peas, brocollini and fresh tomato\\nSpaghetti Bolognese - Spaghetti with minced beef, veal and pork in a red wine tomato ragout and shaved parmigiano reggiano\\nLinguine Vongole Pomodoro - Linguine with baby clams in a white wine pomodoro with basil\\nFusilli Salsicce  - Hand rolled fusilli with chorizo sausage and Portobello mushrooms in a tomato ragout\\nI started the night with the Insalata Caprese ($9.95) - Fresh bocconcini with vine ripened tomatoes and basil infused extra virgin olive oil.  This dish was very average - the quality of the mozzarella and tomatoes was sub-par. I ordered the Spaghetti Q4 ($17.95)  for my entree and it was delightful. If you enjoy spicy and garlic, this is a MUST TRY. The spaghetti was cooked perfectly al dente combined with lots of garlic, grounded chicken, black beans and finished with chili and olive oil.  My boyfriend had the Fusilli Salsicce -  the tomato ragout was average and not a lot of chorizo sausage in the pasta. The portion size for the $10 pasta are decent - I thought  it would be an appetizer size but in fact, it was a full entree size.\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience at Q4 on their $10 pasta nights. If you ask me if I would visit Q4 again on a regular night, my answer is No - I would go to La Quercia for my Italian fix.

I also never would have ordered the bolognese, because, pasta with meat sauce? Yawn. But the giver of the certificate urged me to try it, and I trust her recommendations. Now you should trust mine.\\n\\nClearly I enjoy food, but I'm not the world's biggest eater - especially with a pasta dish, and especially when I'm taking my time and savoring, I have a tendency to fill up. I'm happy to take the remainder home. But there was no remainder for me at Teatro. I could not. stop. eating. the bolognese. When the pasta was gone, I sopped up the rest with bread. I'm not ashamed to admit I would have licked the plate if it were less classy of a joint. \\n\\nI'm vaguely aware that there are other things on the menu, and I'm sure they're just ducky, but I only have eyes for the bolognese. \\n\\nBack to what I said before about it being a place I wouldn't have picked out, it's because on the surface I took it to be pretentious and obnoxiously trendy. It's nice when I can get over my own snooty preconceived notions because really the experience couldn't have been more lovely. I was perfectly comfortable in my jeans and button-down shirt-- if you are looking for a relaxed, casual dinner, it's possible to have one at Teatro-- don't let yourself be intimidated by the decor or the very long wait. If I had, I would have missed out on one of the most amazing dishes I've had in the city.\\n\\nA few tips: yes, it's a little pricey for your typical dinner-and-a-movie date, but it's worth it if you can put a little bank aside (or better, get someone else to pay). As for the wait, I was able to make a Saturday night reservation on the same afternoon, but it wasn't until 10. We went to a movie at the theater next door, and by the time we got out, it was time to eat. We received a discount by presenting our movie tickets which meant more bang for our buck, plus I was beyond famished - all the better to tuck away more of the bolognese.

I told the guy in the truck that I needed my food quickly or I would need a refund. He had the girl in the truck calculate my refund which totaled $12.15. This was short of the $13.50 I was charged plus I had given a tip. He was very rude about the whole situation. He told me I should expect long lines at this event. I think he should think about his own advice and be more prepared if he is invited back to this event. The other trucks handled their lines much better, taking names and handing out the orders by name. This truck had no record of who ordered and was offering out food to those who had ordered much later than I. As I left, he told me I should go to a restaurant next time.

I've made a point to tell the staff the times I've been there picking up food by myself that I am deaf and will not usually hear them call my name, but they've never made an effort to even gesture my way. One guy wrote something resembling \\"deaf\\" on my bag and from what the guy waiting behind me told me the person putting my food up just yelled that along with my name.

It's where my wife & I go not only for special occasions (in slacks & a jacket) with groups our just the two of us but also for a casual night out (in jeans). It's the whole package: the interior & ambiance transports you a neighborhood bistro in Paris; the staff is always friendly & welcoming not to mention efficient, attentive & knowledgeable; the food is fresh & consistently spot-on, all together classic, simple, elegant & unpretentious.\\n\\nOn our most recent visit, my wife & I along with two friends, my dad, and my mother in law went there as usual on Christmas eve this year and as always had a fantastic experience. A bustling night, we had beverages at the bar while we waited for our table: the ladies had kir royals and the gentlemen drank Maredsous Belgian ales.

Then entrees: ruby trout, salmon & shrimp, and lamb tenderloin. Then finished with desserts: cr√®me caramel, cr√®me brulee, profiteroles, and a round of espressos.

For dessert they have strawberry short cake. Soft drinks, iced tea, coffee, tea, sangria, and beer are also included. I will say that it was all you care to enjoy but our waitress never really stopped by our table so we could get more. Was fun but it's a do it once for the experience type of deal.

My brother probably would've ate the entire plate if he had had the option.\\n\\nThe chopped spinach salad had warm bacon dressing, chopped chicken, chopped egg, bacon, chopped red peppers and avocados. I wasn't a huge fan of this mix, I think I would've preferred it without the red peppers and the heat they brought. But overall, the salad was pretty good.\\n\\nI thoroughly enjoyed my creamy lobster bisque.  However, I think the sherry in the bisque was overpowering. But I did note that there were a ton of lobster chunks in the soup. And who doesn't love those soup crackers?

If you dropped them in all at once, you'd be left with a soggy mess towards the bottom of your soup bowl.\\n\\nThe macadamia crusted mahi came out with peanut sauce with a hint of Frangelico, mango relish, and soy glaze drizzle.

He really enjoyed his dish.\\n\\nJoe ordered the 10 oz prime rib, and I was so surprised at this slab of meat that came out.

However, aside from the confusing service, I had an overall pleasant experience.\\n\\nThe restaurant's ambiance is great, both the interior and the outside patio area, which faces Lake Eola.  We were at first told the by the host that there was no room in the outside patio.  We decided to go and look for ourselves and we found two empty tables (for two) in the corner (which comfortably sits three).\\n\\nWe then took it upon ourselves to re-arrange the chairs and create our own space because the host apparently left his brain at home that night.  At any rate, we were very pleased with our corner and the view we had.\\n\\nIt took about 15 minutes to get anyone to come to our table to ask us if we needed drinks or appetizers.  I had to find someone to let them know we had not yet been served (-1 star).  \\n\\nThe waitress was very apologetic and very kind to us which was nice.  She was at times way too apologetic though and if I had a dollar for every time she said, \\"I'm sorry\\", I would have paid for the entire dinner by cashing in on her guilty conscience.\\n\\nWe started off with the drink specials, it was happy hour still.  We had the Chardonnay and Cabernet specials which were not bad.  I don't know the wine they used but it was decent.  We ordered the BBQ flatbread as an appetizer, that was a good dish but in hindsight I would have tried something different.\\n\\nFinally our main orders came out, both my friend and I got the 16 oz. Rib Eye with roasted potatoes and veggies (see my uploaded photo).  The meat was cooked very well, it was very tender and the Bleu Cheese crusted topping took it to another level.  The only small problem was that I thought the meat came with a lot of fat in it.  My beautiful date ordered the Salmon, which was quite good.  I tried the sweet potato fries she ordered and was pleased with the taste but would not personally order it.\\n\\nI was then able to finagle (don't judge now) a free dessert based on our bad \\"experience\\" with the service at this restaurant.  We were awarded two plates of Ice Cream with what I think was a brownie.  It was good but I only had one bite.  I wasn't in the mood for something sweet.  I may have ragged on my waitress on this review but I made sure she got a great tip for making up to us throughout dinner.\\n\\nIn conclusion, go here for a good meal in a great ambiance.  The ambiance makes this place more so than the food.  Great for a day date, especially if you sit outside.  Great for a nice night out too.

They will serve a burger cooked Medium if you ask.  However they make you wait about 10 minutes longer.  A lesser cooked burger should not take any longer than a more well done burger.  If anything, it should come out faster.  You guys have a line out the door most of the time, so I KNOW that you're not putting meat on the grill for you as you order.  Just take one of the patties off sooner and problem solved.  \\n\\n2. Quit shredding your pickles and give me more than just 4 little pickle strips.  Are you guys running the pickles through your french fry machine?\\n\\n3. Speaking of fries, I know you're proud of that \\"special machine\\" that you bought, but I can't say that I really dig the fries very much.  They are too tiny.

Finally I was able to score a beer and so was one of my friends but they brought him a teensy weensy pint glass...apparently a taster by accident. I will admit it made his hands look Yuge.

There isn't much that we like better than a good, hole-in-the-wall, authentic Mexican place, so when I read the great Yelp reviews for LC, I was thrilled. I told Sweetie all about the place. Neither of us could wait to try it, so we rushed on over.\\n\\nUnfortunately, we were entirely underwhelmed by the experience. I will say that we plan to wait 4 to 6 months and then try the place again. Hopefully, at that point, I will be able to write a better, updated review.\\n\\nFirst thing we noticed when we walked in- the dining room was visibly dirty. Other than the table tops themselves, which appeared clean, everything was grimy. The floor, the walls, the bathrooms (ick!), and the light fixtures (which were coated with a thick, brownish dust). The place didn't seem to have had a good, real cleaning in a very long time. Almost made us leave right away, but the kitchen was visible and it didn't appear too terrible, so we ordered. The person at the register wasn't particularly pleasant. She was the sort who never says hi or smiles, just stares flatly while waiting for the order. Another (slight) turn-off.\\n\\nThe food was entirely mediocre. It fell on the low end of the spectrum compared to similar restaurants we've tried (both in the U.S. and in Mexico). The Jalisco breakfast burrito (eggs, chorizo, cheese) could have been good. But the filling wasn't cooked well. The griddle must have been way too hot, because the eggs were of that very thin, tasteless, almost grayish consistency that results. The chorizo itself was fine. And the cheese must have been mixed into the filling prior to cooking, because it was unidentifiable either by taste or sight. Sad thing is, if cooked correctly, the burrito would have been decent. And, at $3 it would have been a good deal.\\n\\nThe smothered pork burrito wasn't very good either. It was small, and only slightly smothered. The pork itself was fine, but there wasn't much of it, and the burrito as a whole was entirely eh. It came with a few (maybe 5) chips, and a little salsa. For what we got, $6.50 actually seemed high.\\n\\nThere was a little salsa bar with 3 salsas. The pico de gallo was fine, but the other 2 (a green tomatillo and a roasted red) didn't taste good. At most authentic places, the salsas are so good that I could drink them down plain from a cup. But the ones here, we tried and then set aside.\\n\\nThis place should rethink the details (apart from the food). First, get a scrub brush and cleanser and scrub the heck out of the place, floor to ceiling. Second, get some light fixtures that aren't clear glass, so that the glare of the bulbs doesn't blind the seated patrons. Third, say hello when people walk up to the counter, suggesting that you actually want them to be there. Fourth, get rid of the flimsy, plastic, compartmentalized elementary school plates. Fifth, get some better plastic cutlery. (We don't mind plastic utensils in a place like this, but the kind on offer are the smallest, thinnest type, as if made for children. Sweetie had a hard time even holding on to them while eating.) \\n\\nI wish LC all the best. I have great respect for people who are trying to create a small business. And a place like this in specific? We are its target patrons. So, as previously mentioned, we will give the place time to (hopefully) work out the kinks. Then we'll try it again.

We were all taken back by how icy he was towards us. We then proceeded to wait for about 5 mins. The restaurant was not busy, so we were confused by how long we were left standing there. There were servers standing behind the bar that almost seemed like they were trying to ignore us. The situation felt really uncomfortable.  As I was about to suggest we go somewhere else, a server came to take us to our table. She was pleasant, but by that point we all felt very unwelcome.\\n\\nWe placed our orders for food and drinks and everything came out in a decent time period, but my \\"Pulled Plant Sandwich\\" and my friend's burger were already cold. While everything was delicious it would have been nice for the food to be hot. The portions were also pretty small considering our $70+ bill.\\n\\nWe finished our dinner around 8:30pm and proceeded to wait for almost ten minutes (our server was no where to be found) until we could find another server to bring us the check. We wanted to split the bill, so my husband calculated our individual totals and wrote them on the back of the receipt for whoever rang it up. When a third server came to collect our cards my husband explained to them how we wanted it rang up and that the totals were on the back of the receipt. Despite all of this, the server just split the bill in half. We decided not to raise an issue because it was close enough to the totals my husband wanted and we were honestly fed up with the lackluster service. As we were finishing up, they began to turn off the lights while we were still inside and start closing up. It wasn't even 8:45pm. \\n\\nI was very underwhelmed by my experience, lack of service provided, small portions, and high prices.

Chin Chin's dish was made with only white-meat chicken (which I prefer), and was full of flavor - just enough spice, and a sauce that consisted of more than just generic soy sauce.

I'm sure there is a regular crowd who likes to eat here. I'm not one of them (yet :)), but yesterday I wanted to treat my aunt, who is sick, to a comforting carryout lunch from Bob Evans. I've never experienced such a carryout cluster-fudge before. There were half a dozen people all hovered around the same counter either picking up food or paying for their dine-in meals. No one knew who was in line for what, or if they even were in a line. I literally asked each person in line if they were in the line to pick up carryout and everyone shrugged. The person taking payments for food was also on the phone taking carryout orders while all of our carryout food got cold on the counter. If you're calling in ahead, it should be a quick and easy process. Bob Evans seems to have had more than enough time to figure out processes for this. I'm sure it can't be this bad at all the locations. Hence, further backing up my theory that Canal Winchester restaurants, save a few good ones like Shades, are allergic to money. To top it off, my aunt's 1/2 of a ham and cheese sandwich had a half slice of bread for the bottom and a quarter of a slice on top, so all of the innards of her sandwich were exposed. How does that happen? Didn't you just make a whole sandwich and cut it in half? How would the top slice be half the size of the bottom slice? How is that acceptable? Did you look at the sandwich before you wrapped it up or did you just say \\"eff it\\"?

They also have a full alcohol menu here, as well as a small bar with a few seats.\\n\\nWe started off with the scallop hokkaiyaki, which consisted of delicious baked scallops, crab sticks and roe.\\nNow let's talk about the soba. One thing I like to judge my noodles on is how soft the noodles are. Too soft- that means the noodles have been overcooked. Too hard- I won't even eat it. Well, the soba were cooked perfectly al dente, it was amazing. The amount of uni was decent. I think the uni came from Maine or somewhere in the states, which tasted different from uni that is from Japan. I hate to say this but Uni from Japan is better, but these weren't bad.\\nHow to eat cold noodles? Dip the noodles in the dipping sauce or \\"tsuyu\\".\\n\\nOne thing that was interesting that they did (and that I have seen in Japan), is pour sobayu (the water that the soba is cooked in) into your leftover dipping sauce to form a delicious broth. The sobayu is not plain water, it has some taste because the soba was cooked in it.  Don't worry, if you don't know what to do with the tea pot of sobayu, the waiter will be sure to explain it to you. The soba is labelled as \\"homemade\\" on the menu, so I wonder if they make the noodles inhouse? \\n\\nThis place reminds me a little bit soba-ya in NYC, by the way."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"LUNCH AND DINNER REVIEW\\n\\n1. Lunch\\nBasically lunch at BOG works like a quick service. Once you are brought inside the castle, you order on electronic menus. They're a bit confusing but the staff is very helpful. After you order, you can choose anywhere to sit and the food is brought to your table. \\n\\nWhen I visited I ordered the braised pork and the strawberry cupcake. They were both delicious. The meal was filling and satisfying.\\n\\n2. Dinner\\nDinner works a bit differently. It works as like a fine restaurant. Once you a brought into the castle, a CM will guide you to your table and you'll meet your server. Our server was amazing, he was constantly checking up on us and full of personality. After ordering your drinks, you'll receive some rolls. I wasn't crazy about the bread (I personality prefer wheat) but it's nice to have especially when you're starving. I ordered the braised pork once again lol. (Keep in mind, these visits at BOG were different years. I didn't have braised pork twice in one day!) The braised pork from lunch vs dinner is so different. My meal came with fresh vegetables and mash potatoes. OH MY GOODNESS. I have never ate something better. It was so full of flavor I couldn't believe. The veggies were a bit crunchy but the pork and mash potatoes were literally to die for. For dessert, I had the famous Grey Stuff. It was good, don't get me wrong but I did like the strawberry cupcake better. \\n\\nBOTTOMLINE:\\n-it's EXPENSIVE! i mean REALLY expensive!! I'd advise to only go if you really want too and you don't have a strict budget. I don't recommend this to large families. I've only been twice because I was on the Disney Dinning Plan. \\n-I preferred dinner over lunch. \\n-Service was awesome. \\n-Food is totally worth it.

The buhna that my boyfriend ordered had a was in a very tasty sauce that mixed well with the rice and naan, and the chicken tikka I ordered was brought to use table side still sizzling in its iron skillet and then served up by the waiter. I was quite surprised by how large the servings were once I was the big chunks of chicken tikka the waiter was doling out. The naan was light and fluffy and fresh, the rice wasn't sticky at all just light and fluffy and even the lentil soup (which I'm usually not a big fan of) was rich and tasty.

Bills that arrive on little silver plates.\\n\\nFood -\\nAppetizer: #100 gyoza $6.25 - chicken gyoza were 5 to an order, pan-fried, tasty, but even better were the #99 duck gyoza $6.95 - which were definitely deep-fried, juicy and tasty, and came fanned out 6 to an order even though the menu stated 5.\\nEntree: #71 chicken katsu curry $11, looked like a little brown turtle with a small pile of greens sprinkled with the red pickles.  #72 yasai katsu curry $9.50, came with the same mound of curry topped sticky rice, but with a single panko breaded deep fried slice of eggplant, and three slices of similarly treated sweet potato/butternut squash (too hard to tell which was which).  One thing I noticed as I perused the menu, was that while there were several vegetarian options marked with a red \\"v\\", the Wagamama dishes that had meat often offered very little vegetables, so I was glad when a friend was willing to split the two curry dishes, so we both ended up with some meat and some veggies.  The curry sauce was tasty, but pure sauce - no hidden lumps of vegetables there!  The portion was decent for a light supper, given that the two of us had also split an order of gyoza.\\n\\nSpeaking of portions, however, two of our party had a hankering for a hamburger after finishing their entrees - a noodle soup (I think it was #35 edbi kare lomen $11.25) for her and a chicken katsu curry for him.\\n\\nIf you're celebrating a birthday at Wagamama's, a few FYI/warnings:\\n1) They wouldn't keep the cake for us in their fridge, in fact, they brought it back to us and held it up where the birthday boy couldn't miss seeing it, asking if it were ours.\\n2) Due to fire codes, they couldn't light the candle for us... later, after we had already sung 'Happy Birthday' over an unlit candle, they said, well, we could light it ourselves if we wanted too.  Unfortunately none of us had matches or lighters.\\n3) Although we were a single large party, we were presented with checks by table - we were three tables.  That's great for normal dining situations when everyone expects to pay for what they ordered, but something to keep in mind when the party wishes to treat someone.\\n\\n10/24/09 visit -\\nDuck gyoza $6.95 were 5 to an order this time, but still yummy.\\nEdamame $3.95 came with your choice salt or chili and garlic salt and arrived with an empty bowl to hold the pods.\\nI ordered the absolute wagamama combo #91 for $14.25:\\n1) chicken ramen $9.50 included a moist plump grilled sliced chicken breast in a bowl of tender noodles, a handful of tender leaves, and a tasty broth\\n2) 3 chicken gyoza ($6.25 for 5) were light and tasty\\n3) melon fruit juice $3.95 tasted healthy and the juices separated over time so you have to stir it back together - okay but I probably won't order it again\\nBaked stem ginger cheesecake was light and creamy with an obvious ginger flavor and a sweet graham cracker crust."},{"name":"Thai Fresh","address":"8409 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Another awesome meal at Thai Fresh.\\n\\nVerdict on Tom Kha Martini.....delicious!\\n\\nHad sleeping prawns, pumpkin curry with vegetables and drunken noodles with shrimp.

Why wasn't I blown away...?\\n\\nI've been torn for days between a 3 star and 4 star rating, but decided on 3 stars because my expectations were so high from all of the other over-hyping, yet Sweet Carrot fell short of my expectations on a few dimensions.\\n\\nI'll explain why \\"the Clint Eastwood way\\":\\n\\nTHE GOOD - healthy, fresh, tasty food served by very friendly people in a very cool, hip environment.  There were at least a dozen people working the Friday lunch when I stopped by.\\n\\nTHE BAD: as noted in other reviews, for customers wearing clothing larger than a Size 4, the portion size of proteins is ridiculously small.  $9-$10 \\"street food\\" should fill you up, not require that you buy a second item.  I got a $9.95 Stuffed Corn Cake with smoked turkey, and it was delicious, but it was probably only 2 1/2 ounces of turkey.  I was still a little hungry.  So I got \\"Alone In A Boat\\" artichokes for $4.95.  They were truly delicious, but for $5 bucks I got like 6 or 7 little 1/8 slices of an artichoke heart, breaded lovingly in cornmeal.  \\n\\nThe artichokes were delicious, but the price-to-value-ratio felt more like I was at Cameron Mitchell's overpriced Hudson 29 on Lane Avenue in UA than a food truck that has \\"made it big\\" and gotten their own storefront.\\n\\nAgain, all really tasty stuff, but management needs to reduce staffing a little and use the savings to increase the protein portions.  Industry norm for food cost is 25% of retail...  I'm guessing that Sweet Carrot is closer to 14%...\\n\\nTHE UGLY:  Parking sucks. Period.  And there's no way to make it better other than by adding good signage.  They have a small parking lot attached to the (former grocery) building, but it isn't marked well and isn't noted as one-way or two-way (as least that I saw).\\n\\nI initially drove past the building, thinking I could park \\"around back\\", only to pull into the tiny car repair lot next door, which is congested and one-way, and had to back out onto Grandview Avenue (no small feat).  I'm guessing this happens a dozen times per day, and the little car repair shop is tired of it.  It's also going to cause a bad accident for a Sweet Carrot customer one of these days.\\n\\nPark across the street in the huge, empty Giant Eagle parking lot and walk across Grandview Avenue.

The warmly decorated restaurant has an orange and bright blue color scheme which was inspired to resemble the serine African sunset. The restaurant also hosts an open show kitchen complete with coral colored wood burning ovens.\\n\\nWe started our evening by splitting a cold appetizer, we ordered the Roasted Beet Salad from the vegan menu, which was made with 3 different types of beets, candied beets, golden beets, and roasted red beets, the salad was topped with watercress and Frisee and a beautiful burgundy colored blackberry Shiraz Vinaigrette which was drizzled over the plate. The non vegan beet salad came accompanied with pistachio crusted goat cheese and thinly sliced Serrano ham, so our server, Mike brought out a side dish with the two non vegan ingredients for my aunt to enjoy! She raved about the creamy cheese and the slightly salty ham.\\n\\n\\n\\nNext we had our hot appetizer, a delicious Puree of Sweet Potato Soup made with pineapple, red pepper, and  grated plantain fries. This soup was delicious the combination of crispy fried grated plantains topped with the velvety smooth soup puree had a unique texture.\\n\\n\\nOur server also brought us out each a basket of bread. My basket contained whole wheat flax seed focaccia and thin crispy papadum bread. Both breads were delicious! My Aunts basket contained the whole wheat flax seed bread with a side of creamy honey butter,which she raved about. It took some serious willpower from both of us to resist eating our entire baskets full of bread.\\n\\nNext it was onto the main event. I selected the Egyptian Kushari Entree Made with Lentils, Israeli couscous, fresh chickpeas, tomato sauce, almond,and a a light Harissa Vinaigrette. This dish was great, it had a slight kick to it but the vinaigrette seasoned couscous topped with the spicy chunky tomato sauce and slightly salty sliced almonds made for a wonderful combination of flavorful ingredients.\\n\\n\\nAfter Indecisively changing her mind several times my aunt finally selected the Grilled Wild Gulf Shrimp Curry served over a bed of coconut basmati and seasonal vegetables, topped with plump raisins in a durban curry sauce. She loved her dish especially the combination of spicy curry sauce with the plump raisins which provided a bit of sweetness to the dish.\\n\\nThree courses later we were quite comfortably full, yet there was still one course to go and I wasn't stopping until I had it. My Aunt on the other hand claimed she was too full for dessert, yet a run down of the items on the dessert menu by our server seemed to make the idea of dessert suddenly attractive to her. Within five minutes of being handed the dessert menu she had decided on the warm coconut bread pudding topped with caramel rum sauce and accompanied by the house made caramel ice cream. Despite being full she finished her entire dessert, somethings just don't deserve to be wasted!\\n\\n\\nI selected the Sorbet, a selection of three house made sorbets, creamy coconut, red raspberry, and sweet mango topped with a selection of fresh berries.

Excuse me while I fetch my brown bag, sir...\\n\\nAnother drink special shout-out would have to be their $3.25 Monday night well- drinks. You can't beat that in Atlanta. $3.25 would get you a Bud Light at most places, but they like to keep it real at Amsterdam!\\n\\nI generally have a comfortable, happy time here. Huge screens surround one-half of the bar, but they aren't showing football, folks. More like 80's rock videos with a touch of Gaga, Britney and Duran Duran. Sounds like you should wear your drinking pants, right?\\n\\nThe atmosphere could be compared to Smith's Olde Bar, but without the obnoxious crowds. ;) By this, I mean to imply that the business is clean, with clean bathrooms, eclectic crowds you might find in EAV, but meeting centrally in the Highlands. You can smoke indoors, but it's not stuffy considering the VERY tall ceilings. \\n\\nNot to forget, they really out-do themselves with holiday decor. Right on!"},{"name":"Joe's Crab Shack","address":"3720 West Dublin-Granville Rd.","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"My son enjoyed the food !

Hold Out for the Good Stuff;Hold Out for Paris Baguette!\\n\\nHadn't been to Paris Baguette since last summer, when they were making their cronuts with a strong coffee cream filling. They switch flavors seasonally and now the fillings are Orange or Lemon . (They are made in this location and are put in the cases ~ 1PM. They often sell out but there were maybe 10-12 total at 4:30PM today, Monday.) It's very noticeable to me-the improvement in their cronuts. They are no longer greasy, and have a beautiful crisp exterior and light layered inside. The robust citrus fillings are not made with flavored oils, but with the 'real thing' (the orange cronut filling and glaze taste just like fresh OJ.) Pretty perfect, in my book.\\nAs might be expected, if held overnight, they become heavy and not so light, but are still tasty. Their Red Bean paste filling in a fried Mochi ball, (w/o sugary adornment), was really terrific. With ample not-too-sweet filling and the addictive chewiness of fried glutinous rice flour dough, it was also imbued with shadingsofotherflavors.\\n\\nThe cinnamon Syrup Bun was an interesting cross between a flour based cinnamon bread and a mochi roll , but I found the sweet filling rather indistinct. \\n\\nGreat to see the improvements at Paris Baguette (in the Central Sq. H Mart.) They have a very large product line and the items in their well lit and well labeled cases- are consistently\\nneat and attractive. It's certainly not unusual that the words 'Quality Control' and 'Japan' go hand in hand. That's quite a feat (like Santouka Ramen in Harvard Sq.), successfully extending a successful chain halfway around the world, but it looks like Paris Baguette had done just that.\\nI hope youall will try it soon.\\n(But pleeeeeze, PB developers, don't open a new shop closer to me, because I would be in REALLY big trouble then. )"},{"name":"Ah-Ma's Taiwanese Kitchen","address":"931 Monroe Dr, Ste A-108","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I love this place!

This place is always packed and the wait time can get long, but luckily they take reservations unlike the Allston location.\\n\\nI always go for the soft tofu soup but their soft tofu combinations seem like a good deal as well. You get a bunch of banchan side dishes (kimchi, fish cake, potato salad, bean sprout etc) and theyre pretty good. Unlike the Allston location that has unlimited banchan refills, you only get one refill. \\n\\nI've tried their beef+kimchi tofu soup and beef+seafood tofu soup ($12.99 each). Next time I'd probably get their been tofu soup.  There where whole shrimps and small clams in the seafood soup but since the shrimps had shells on they were harder to eat. I like beef over shrimps so even though the seafood was fine I'd prefer to order the beef only next time. Since the overall flavor of tofu soups is spicy, I couldn't distinguish the taste of the kimchi from the rest of the soup.  I've always gone with the medium spicy level (you can customize your spiciness level--yay) and its spicy enough to make my nose runny but not overly spicy.  I don't often crave soft tofu soup but soup is good/solid.  \\n\\nThe last time I went the soup was not as hot as it usually is. You get a egg that you can add to your soup, and usually that egg cooks itself in the hot soup. Last time it stayed running the entire time, and people at my table were not down to eat raw egg.  I don't think it happens that often or maybe only when it super busy. Overall, not a big deal. \\n\\nService is alright. They refill your water and banchan, and thats standard and all I ask for.  During peak hours it can be hard to get a waiter's attention, just fyi. It's hard to compare Kaju to Bonchon (another Korean restaurant in the same building), because there is isn't a ton of overlap in their menus. Bonchon doesn't have soup but Kaju doesn't have chicken.  I haven't had their bbq or sushi so I can't compare those either.

Not to mention it was so uncomfortably loud in the little room that I think I may have uttered three sentences the entire 1.5hrs  to my friend sitting across from me. This time I ordered the seafood chowder & a wedge salad (I was looking for light fare that rainy day, I know boring, so really how could that be screwed up?) After waiting 20 minutes for just our order to be taken I received luke warm seafood soup & the most pathetic wedge salad I have ever seen. I am not exaggerating when I say that there were 3 crumbles of blue cheese & about 10 tiny chopped up pieces of tomato on the salad and well, wait that is it, pretty sad $5 salad if you ask me (in my world all wedge salads come with bacon crumbles as well :) I politely asked if I could have a regular salad like my friend (his looked soooo much better) & got the ugliest look from our waitress, 15 minutes later no replacement salad & I ended up eating a $5 luke warm CUP of soup for lunch & that was it because well I ran out of time! My friend had the beef sheppard's pie & thought it was only decent since it was made with ground beef? WHAT is that normal? 1.5hrs later I was late getting back to work & still hungry. \\n\\nI won't be back a 3rd time! My best guess is this place will eventually go under just like the others that had preceded them in that location. Oh! Wait I do have one good thing to say, the interior is on the pubish cute side. I really did like the decor, but could have done without all the boobage busting out of the waitresses shirts (there you go, perhaps the only good reason to try this place!)"},{"name":"Happy's Bar & Kitchen","address":"1363 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I just DON'T get the atmosphere.

Now that's funny!  He could have been snotty about it, but was really cool.  He also let us try some sorbet that he had made himself and then topped it with some liquor that made it even more delicious.\\n\\nChecked this place out last night, having heard nothing about it, and it blew me away.  The waiter gave my friend and I a little \\"overview\\" of the menu which was actually very helpful.  They have several great looking salads, some original appetizers, and several main course and side dish options.  I had a chicken thigh that was perfectly cooked and served with some roasted peanut something that was delicious.  The white beans were also perfectly cooked (not overly cooked mush or undercooked chewy) and the presentation was simple and interesting.  The service was phenomenal, and the space is clean and unpretentious.  It looks like the menu will change regularly, and they have options for both seating at small tables upstairs, or shared seating at large tables on the main level.  A fully stocked bar, and well-balanced wine list, and no attitude.  The food is creative, delicious, and reasonably priced.

BUT today, the gal in front of me placed an order; and the one girl cashier; out of two employees (other was the cook) told the gal that was trying to collect her change back from her order, \\"since you don't have change, (in broken English) I can't give you change, I ran out.\\"\\nLong story short, the customer said to keep it. It was 50 cents but I wonder how many people the cashier did that to today. \\nSo when I got up to order I asked the gal would I get change back and she answered, \\"No, no change.\\" I proceeded to tell her to call a manager to get some change in the register. I also told her she needs to tell people upfront to warn them first, or ask them to pay with a credit card if they didn't have the exact change. \\"This\\" employee didn't seem too concerned whatsoever, because she didn't respond! \\nI placed my order and watched as the cook was preparing the food. They advertise homemade tortillas but I noticed they were taking tortillas out of plastic bags. I saw the name brand items sold from the market. I did ask the cashier, (which by the way; was  touching food and utensils with dirty money hands that she never washed) if they did catering, I had to rephrase the question in three different ways, because either she did not understand me, or had no knowledge of customer service, so she looked at the cook and he had to answer me. I started to look around the restaurant while I was waiting. It was pretty disgusting, just  like behind the food counter. \\nThe cashier, said something about me in Spanish, the cook looked up and laughed while looking at me.  \\n\\nGood thing my family member that is an infection control nurse didn't come, plus my husband having cancer, I felt I didn't want his immune system to be compromised, so I ate the non-meat order when I got home myself. \\nCleanliness today was horrible!  The cook laid my burritos on top of order checks that have ink on them before wrapping them to-go. Because being short staffed; there was food over food, and counter tops that didn't looked like they had been cleaned off for hours. Objects were set on top of the counter tops that were non-food items, nothing was being wiped down! I think I was  making the two employees nervous to be honest with you. When I went to the salsa bar I didn't even bother to put anything in the container, it just looked like it hadn't been cleaned or filled up for hours. I looked on the side and noticed plates and trash overfilling in the used dish area. It's a shame that they can't hire more people. I felt like I was pressured to tip when the cashier said, \\"press the screen for a tip.\\"\\nIt's remarkably funny how she knew how to say things that pertained to collecting money, but couldn't graciously say, \\"I'm sorry, let  me find out your question for you.\\"\\n\\nI'm going to make a call to the manager, I sure hope he/she take these issues seriously, because I would like to continue eating there.  \\nI really am concerned about the public, and I always do my best to help protect each and every one of you folks out there by mentioning the serious unsanitary issues.\\nSo don't be shy, if you see something that is not up to par that could be dangerous to your health; speak up, we have the right."},{"name":"Take Sushi","address":"4528 Hastings Street","city":"Burnaby","stars":"4","text":"I've been a huge sushi lover since I was a kid.

They literally took over an hour just to serve my brother in law's his sushi cones. Granted, when we were there, they're getting busier but seriously, some of the people who had arrived after us actually got their orders before his damn cones arrived. So I don't really see how it would take them that long just to serve his damn sushi cones. \\n\\nAlthough despite how their food is not that bad because I had much worse then theirs, but it's just that it their fish doesn't have real freshness taste and smell to it. Like if it had been sitting in the freezer at least a few days longer than it should've been. So most of the tastes that the sushi should've had was completely gone. \\n\\nThis place isn't a terrible place to visit but out of all the places to go to, I would not recommend this place at first if you want good sushi. Consider going to Samurai Sushi beside Oakridge Mall or somewhere else with a good fresh sushi reputation before coming here.\\n\\nLastly, I dislike how the changes on their menu. I was here last year with my mother and our in laws to celebrate mother's day and I ordered a deluxe combo. But then I came back here again on mother's day this year and ~\\"surprise surprise\\"~, they changed their deluxe combo slightly and not for the better, in fact, it's much worse.

Can I recommend kicking out one of the other restaurants in that plaza?\\n\\nAnyways, the food is great. It's a pretty short menu, and I plan to get through the entire thing at some point. The beef noodle soup was delicious, probably the best I've had in Atlanta so far. Compared to the one in Chinatown, it's a little less salty at the cost of slightly less quality noodles (Chinatown pulls their own). The beef noodle soup can be a meal in and of itself. There's a beef stew (the spicy one) as well, and I plan to try that some time soon.\\n\\nThe restaurant's \\"main attraction\\" seems to be its bao. They're a little on the pricier side for a college students (5 bucks and up for a single one) but quite tasty.

The sour and spicy is great, it's got an almost unbearable amount of peppery flavor.

The taste is about average.\\n\\nThe biggest issue with this restaurant is their abundant use of MSG or something similar. Of course, I didn't take sample of their food and take it to national lab for analysis, but from my whole life experience eating Korean foods, I can sense that they are using it and using it abundantly. Whenever I eat their food for lunch, I look for water the whole day through the night and I do not feel good.\\n\\nIn the past decade or so, many of the restaurants in Korea have modernized and departed from using MSG or similarly unhealthy chemical. Many of them now use natural ingredients instead. I'm truly hoping that Buk Kyung will follow the trend and try to offer something that is as tasty without using MSG.

However, if you want more of a \\"club vibe,\\" I highly recommend going somewhere else.\\n\\nCame here for a friend's birthday and here are some notes about D6:\\n\\nDress Code: Everyone here definitely dresses up! Ladies, think heels and dresses. Men, go for dressy shoes, nice shirt, and dark pants. \\n\\nAge Range: Definitely the older crowd ---think mid 20s - 30s+\\n\\nInterior: No \\"real\\" dance floor. Place is primarily made up of private booths for parties. If you just wander in to chill, you're limited to just a small area that is near the bar, the pool table, and a narrow strip of carpet near the DJ area. A really cool feature about this place was the hidden back room that is located behind a bookshelf. Do note: access to the backroom is really limited so unless you got a table back there, the most you can do is take a quick peek before you get shooed away by the security guards. \\n\\nBooths/Table Service: Highly recommend putting in a reservation! Booths were decent, most tables had long couches for seats. As for table service, it was meh. Our server wasn't around for most of the time and when she was, she didn't seem too friendly. Average price for a bottle was in the hundreds, so be prepared to drop those $$$\\n\\nMusic: Meh. Most of the beats were top 40, some EDM, and overall, I wish the DJ played a more consistent style. \\n\\nDrinks: Can't speak for the cocktails (didn't get a chance to try any) but I can say that the bartenders here are quick and friendly :) \\n\\nRestrooms: Ladies room was pretty clean throughout the night!

There are so many more options than any other Indian restaurants that I have tried. I tried the Mango Lassi  (always my fave!), Goat Haleem, and Rasmalai. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I want to mention, however, that this place was very crowded when I came.

I ordered my food \\"to go\\" but manage to get a table. \\n\\nWhile I was eating at my table with food in my mouth, I was asked by someone at the next table if they could have my table when I was finished. I swallowed my food and said \\"yes, when I am finished.\\" This was about 1/3 of the way through my meal. More than half of the 7-8 people from this table then stared at me through the rest of my meal, squirming through their chairs and pointing at my table when I was finished with each portion of my meal, to where I had to turn my chair away from them to check emails on my phone post-meal. One lady was even standing at times, turning toward me and staring at me. Another table asked for a chair, and then thanked me and apologized for bothering me while eating, which I appreciated. But I really would prefer someone asking the question when I do not actually have food in my mouth. I did go back inside and complain to the cashier/order taker about the behavior of the people at the first table. The lady cashier said she was sorry for my inconvenience. \\n\\nThis should have been a 5* experience, because the staff was perfect to me. Unfortunately, a crowded place sometimes needs crowd and courtesy control, and I believe Zyka needs door and/or inside signs to say that guests should not be harassed while eating, to make the experience a comfortable one. This is a majorly crowded place, and there are no signs telling people to try to not disturb seated guests while waiting for a table.  No one should feel rushed because a party very much wants 2 tables and cannot get it immediately.

My review may be a little biased because the owner of the store is a family friend and so whenever we go out to eat for Japanese, it'll probably be here.\\n\\nThe owner is a young man by the name of Jason and it is a family run business. They have your typical sushi (dynamite, california, yam, etc), as well as udons, teriyakis, tempuras, miso, and so on. Their tempuras are delicious (the mom makes it in the back) and do not have that nasty greasy feeling to it at all. They always get us to try appetizers (the green seaweed salad, delicious, not really sour like some places). The miso isn't bad either.\\n\\nMy favourites (before I turned vegetarian) is this tuna dish and their calamari salad. The tuna dish is a large piece of tuna, that's been half cooked. So the outside of the fish is cooked, but inside is still raw and the entire dish is half submerged in this sauce. I really really enjoyed that. Also, the calamari salad has a really great mixture of greens that seriously compliment each other with a tasty dressing. They also have a lot of special house rolls (I don't even remember the names of), but they are all freshly made, some are very colourful, with a drizzle of sauce on top. All the sushi is at a decent size and the rice is consistently good.\\n\\nLike I said, cause we are close friends with the owner, service is fine. But I do notice that the other new waitresses they employ are not always very friendly.

It doesn't sound like a natural pairing, but this is no ordinary steak and mac and cheese. The steak comes out buttery and juicy. As fillet mignon is the leanest steak you can get, the fact that this is full of flavor and taste is astonishing. The macaroni and cheese is made with a red wine reduction which gives this a mild flavor, not at all like the blue box stuff. \\n\\nMy favorite appetizer is the Taste of Africa which is a variety of dipping sauces and breads.

We ordered a quesadilla for an appetizer thinking that it would be a normal size quesadilla like you find everywhere else... wrong!

It's hard to get a ticket - shows often sell out months in advance. It's hard to get to - you'll need to drive (or take a bus or two) to the Fort Wilderness main lot, and then take a 15 minute bus ride inside the campground to the show (you can also take a ferry boat from the Magic Kingdom). It's hopelessly dated - the show hasn't changed much in 40 years and features standards like the Hokey Pokey and Oh My Darling, Clementine. And they like to make fun of their guests (yes, that's me in a pink tutu in the photo).\\n\\nYet, even with all this, it's still a unique Disney experience that everyone should see at least once: 90 minutes of pure, old-school Disney Magic. It's been performed over 30,000 times and seen by millions over the last 40+ years. It's a family tradition for many Disney guests who come back year after year - and it may be the most fun you'll have on your Disney vacation. It's a great place to celebrate a special event - birthdays and anniversary are recognized early in the show. \\n\\nThe show takes place in Pioneer Hall on the northern end of the Fort Wilderness campground and resort site. Pioneer Hall was built just a few years after the Magic Kingdom opened and was painstakingly constructed from over 1000 hand fitted pine logs brought in all the way from Montana. Originally conceived as a place to gather, eat, and possibly show nature films the management at Disney decided to make some money off of it by hosting a dinner show aimed at those who couldn't get into the Polynesian Luau show. The budget was so tight back then that the original cast consisted of interns.\\n\\nThe show - a mix of vaudeville, audience participation, old time Americana, and classic Disney - is a pure blast. A cast of six is accompanied by a talented duo of musicians on piano and banjo. The cast is amazing and can sing, dance, improv, and even do pratfalls. Although the cast rotates (perhaps even from show to show) they are always some of Disney's best and they clearly enjoy the work.\\n\\nThe meal is a big part of the show. Corn bread and salad are waiting on the table when you arrive. A selection of drinks is included with the ticket price; there's even beer, wine, and Sangria for the adults at no extra cost. Neither the food nor service approaches gourmet fine dining - but everything is tasty and hearty. Fried chicken and ribs are served for the main course and both are excellent. There's a good selection of sides as well: corn, baked beans, and mashed potatoes. Dessert is one of the few changes that's been made to show - it's now Strawberry Shortcake, and the wait staff joins the show for its presentation. \\n\\nTickets are expensive enough that it's hard to call it a bargain, but if you come hungry, have a drink or two, and consider the value of the entertainment then you'll certainly get your money's worth.\\n\\nThe end of the show was a special highlight. It's the story of Davy Crockett, filled with plenty of un-BEAR-able puns. I was selected to be Davy Crockett's angel, the \\"star\\" of the show. I was taken backstage (by the cast, who were really friendly), dressed up, and given my instructions. My big moment on stage was a lot of fun and something my family will never forget. (The cast will interact with much of the audience, even those on the balcony, but to have the best chance of being on the few invited on stage you'll probably need to be sitting in the good seats up front)."},{"name":"Gami Sushi","address":"10111 Number 3 Road, Suite 126","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"We come here from time to time because it's in our hood, however they're quite busy that it is hard to get a seat.

And just to be clear this is mostly a review of service, not the food. It was a Thursday night so we knew to expect a wait. It was quick, 20 minutes or so. We were seated in a big comfy booth, a pleasant surprise since we were only a party of two. I was excited for a great meal tucked away in this corner with my fiance. The first five minutes were fabulous and then it rapidly went downhill. The server came over, regrettably I cannot remember his name. First impression, two thumbs up. He greeted us in under two minutes of being seated (servers recently don't seem to know this is really important to the guest) and he asked us if we had any allergies and if we had visited before. We happily told him it was a return visit and he took our drink order.  I ordered the fabulous Fresco, mmmm and it was at the table in three minutes...awesome, right? But no Coke for my fiance.  We put in an order for an appetizer.   While I was sipping on my drink, I gazed longingly at the chips the other tables were munching, wondering if our server was going to keep going in and out of the kitchen with empty hands, wondering if we were going to get the chips, the Coke, or even move onto the next step of ordering our entree. The wonderful appetizer came, dropped by a runner or another server.  It was as good as remembered from our last visit. But the chips never came, the Coke never came and the server just kept walking back and forth right by us with nothing in his hands!!! Doing nothing. Not helping anyone else, not clearing, not cleaning, certainly not asking us what we wanted for dinner!Unfortunately for the restaurant, it has an incredible menu with great food being made in the kitchen, but the front staff has to be as good! \\n When we had finally had enough waiting, with our appetizer plates still piled on the menus we had yet to order our entrees from, my fiance went off in search of a manager. You should never have to get up  at a restaurant except to use the facilities!\\n  While he was on his search for sanity, I finally flagged down the server and explained that the service was unacceptable and that we never had gotten our chips or had our order taken. He then told me it was Temezcal's new policy that the guest had to specifically ask for chips at the beginning of the meal. \\"Really?\\" I asked.  He said it was a new policy, just started \\"a few weeks ago.\\" Maybe when we stated at the beginning of the meal that we had visited Temezcal before, we should have said it was more than a few weeks so we weren't privy to the new policy. Unlike every other table with chips surrounding us, they must have all known right?  So by now we just want to leave.   But we can't. We need to pay for my drink and the app.  So we asked for the check. He brought us the chips!!!! I understand, check and chips sound alike but finally a kind manager just let us go. Thank goodness. We ran out, fearing this kid's stupid was contagious. I have never been so frustrated on what was supposed to be a relaxing evening out. \\n  I have reached out to the restaurant via FB messenger numerous times, asking about the new \\"chip policy\\" with no response which is what led to actually writing a review.  I got a shady answer from a sub par server so I was looking for some legitimacy and received no answer.  So if you have infinite patience, are willing to put up with less than stellar service and are daring enough to chance going home hungry, go to Temezcal.

It's really hard to narrow down all of the dinner choices in Boston; even when you try to focus on just one specific neighborhood, the choices are far too numerous to be fair. Luckily, my friend and I worked together to choose Teatro.\\n\\nThe venue itself is pretty small - just one long room with 3 rows of tables going all the way down. They do take advantage of the space by placing the tables pretty close together and having the tables against the walls use bench seating to save room. The high ceilings would normally indicate a loud dinner, but they have canvas hangings on the wall to absorb sound, so it's never too loud to hear your dinnermate. Even though they were running a little late for the night, our waiter never made us feel rushed and worked hard to make sure we were happy and comfortable. \\n\\nThe menu is not extensive - maybe 5 or 6 choices for each of the 5 or 6 course options, plus a handful of sides listed on the bottom, and a couple of specials. We quickly narrowed in on the prosciutto flatbread ($16) and decided to share the burrata ($13) and meatball ($13) as well. We also ordered a glass of prosecco and a glass of the red sangria. Both drinks were divine but the sangria was pretty strong, just as an FYI.\\n\\nWe were given a cone of bread with a side of hummus and the burrata came out quickly. One piece of toast was obviously not enough for the burrata but we had the bread as well, and ended up asking for a second serving of the table bread. The burrata itself was a good size and there were 4 grilled(?) cherry tomatoes and a balsamic drizzle to dip the bread in. YUM. Shortly thereafter came the meatball, which was actually 3 large meatballs on top of a few strands of sage handkerchief pasta. We each ate one and took the 3rd home. Lastly was the pizza, which hard large slices of prosciutto over honey fig jam, gorgonzola crema, and watercress. I am not usually a fan of gorgonzola but couldn't taste it past the meat and jam. It was 6 squared-shaped slices, each about the size of a drink coaster (4\\"x4\\" maybe) - definitely more than a personal pizza, but we would have been left hungry had we not ordered the other food. \\n\\nAt the end of our meal, we still had most of the second cone of bread, some hummus, some burrata, a meatball, and half of the pizza.

The egg rolls were less noteworthy - too many flavors competing for prominence, which meant the duck confit and foie gras were lost.  For his entree, my friend ordered the Reel House Burger with the Crab Louie add-on.  It was flavorful, but was ordered medium rare, and came out very rare.  I ordered the sauteed sea scallops, that came with a really, really good brussels sprout tabbouleh, topped with a caper berry vinaigrette.  As good as the tabbouleh was, it did NOT make up for the fact that this $30 entree consisted of 3 average sized scallops.  3 scallops.  $30 for 3 scallops.  If the restaurant can't make the price point work for them they should take the entree off the menu.  When we complained, the floor manager told us that we were not the first patrons to do so - which should tell the management and the chef that if they can't make the price point work for them they should take the entree off the menu.

It was different than we thought, 2 huge fried balls we thought it would have been various smaller ones but it made sense since they were stuffed with meat inside. We order the mid size pizza and had it split as the 4 cheese white and margherita. I'd put this pizza pretty up there might be the best I've ever had and I've had some pretty amazing pizza in Brooklyn. If I ever find myself at Epcot again I would definitely eat here!!"},{"name":"wagamama - prudential","address":"800 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Wagamama is very upfront about what they are, a noodle place where you sit at communal benches with super fresh food that can have you in and out in next to no time. Perfect for a quick lunch with some of you co-workers if you work in the tower, especially if you are sick of the other options available inside the prudential center. \\n\\nI like the fresh juice, the crispy stir fry and the excellent broth in their soups. There are a few problems with the place though, but the upfront nature with which they address them makes it seem quaint and quirky.\\n\\n1. You are going to be sitting next to strangers, and they can be very close. But they tell you this up front and the whole place is bench seating, so it can be charming in a you just put your elbow in my soup kind of way.\\n\\n2. The food doesn't all come out on some sort of schedule. It is possible to get both your appetizer and your entree at the same time, because that is when they happened to be finished. You might get your entree before the people you went with because you ordered meat and they ordered tofu, who knows. They tell you this up front, so it kind of makes up for it.\\n\\n3. It is impossible to flag down a waitress. They are running around that place like crazy trying to serve everyone, and as the place just opened I am sure they are trying to get the system down.\\n\\n4. In the same vein as flagging down a waitress, it take a waitress 5 minutes to find you a fork. All of the place settings have chopsticks, which I like to use, but sometimes the people you go with need forks, it took our waitress 5 minutes to find a fork. (maybe she didn't know where they were kept, or she got sidetracked or whatever but still a problem)\\n\\nAll in all I think this place is a step below P.F.

Waypoint is a new restaurant that just opened three months ago by Michael Scelfo, the same chef behind Alden & Harlow. Even though this is a seafood-heavy restaurant, I chose the lamb roast because I wanted something meaty--and it ended up being one of the meatiest meals of my life. I was literally served with a mountain of glistening lamb, and just the sight of it was mouth-watering. I recommend the dish (which costs $64) to be shared among three people. The mound of meat is covered by a thick layer of fatty lamb that melts in your mouth. Even beyond that layer, the meat is so tender that it falls apart with the lightest pull. It is a carnivore's dream. But the dish is also a good balance between meat and veggies that are equally flavorful: it is surrounded by a ring of anchovy, marrow beans, pickled lemon.\\n\\nNeed another reason to go to Waypoint?

In order to stay and play games for 2 hours everyone at the table must order, so enjoy a pizza. If you go at prime hours there is going to be a wait so plan accordingly. Don't be upset about waiting because soon you too will playing a game eating pizza. The games are fun and are meant to be played with a group.\\n\\nThe pizza was so good.

Between ppl coming to eat there, stopping to get fish from the market, and the phone ringing, I can't believe there aren't more reviews on here! The lobster rolls were on round buns that were toasted and, at first, you think they're small for the $14.95 you spend. By the time you're done with the overstuffed roll, the fries (I'd get the fries, not the roasted potatoes) and the coleslaw that's included in that price PLUS the great clam chowder, you'll be plenty full - the 'cups' of soup are bowls instead. I recommend the chowder over the crab soup - didn't really taste crab in the soup. The bill was about $40 for the two of us.

I would also recommend this bar to 21 yr olds who want to dance to pop music with other 21 yr olds. One Friday evening in which I stayed way past happy hour, I noticed a lot of foreigners who looked barely looked 21, as well as a group of much older people (+/- 60) who were all getting down on the dance floor in their own respective ways. So if you're into a diverse crowd, this is your spot (after 9pm). Surrounding the dance floor are two \\"cage\\" type dance areas. I thought these looked pretty fun, however, I noticed  the DJs turn dudes away from dancing in there, which I found to be sexist. -1 star for sexism. I did enjoy the selection of pop music that played later in the night (around 9pm-12am). The drinks become considerably more expensive once happy hour ends, and the \\"shot bus\\" starts up. I'm not sure what the \\"shot bus\\" is- it actually looks like a leftover prop from the Real World Portland.\\n\\nSo, I like this bar during happy hour, and for when I want to go dancing with my *girl* friends.

There was water on the floor that someone who was standing around could have easily cleaned up. That's a lawsuit waiting to happen. Now to the food. If you claim yourself as an Irish Pub you better have some damn good fish and chips. These frozen French fries and piece of bland battered cod was below average. The buffalo chicken wrap had a weird flavor. Finally our server came and gave us the bill while we were still eating. The total amount she was supposed to give us back was $16.78.

Those are decent. We've never had any issues with service until my most recent dinner there. \\n\\nI was there with 3 other people. They all ordered tofu soup combos and I'd been craving shabu and decided to order one of their meat combos. As they brought out the plate of vegetables and sauce accompaniments (garlic, peppers, etc), I started to get a really bad feeling about their shabu. The vegetables did not look fresh at all. The leafy guys drooped off of the plate and actually touched the table surface and the other vegetables and quantities just looked so sad. The sauce accompaniments looked like apple sauce and green colored apple sauce. What really tipped the scale was when the broth came out and was a plain, murky brown with one sad chili pepper floating in it. The menu lists a few different broth flavors: regular and vegetarian are free, and other flavors were an extra charge. The waiter did not ask which broth I wanted. The broth tasted like garbage. My friends could see on my face that I was really disappointed, they tried the broth, agreed with me, and encouraged me to change the order asap. \\n\\nThis was my first time returning food. I don't like the idea of doing it, but I was encouraged to and knew that I would not enjoy my meal otherwise. Before my entire meal came out, we asked the waiter if I could change my meal, and he literally ran for the manager. Below was the conversation:\\n\\nME: I've changed my mind about my meal. Could I order something else?\\nMANAGER: The meat is already being sliced for your shabu, so no. \\nMY FRIEND: Could you use that meat for something else? \\nMANAGER: No, because we do not use lamb meat on anything else on our menu. \\nME: Could you use that meat to make anything else on your menu, just for me? \\nMANAGER: No, it hasn't been marinated like our other meats. \\nMY FRIEND: Well, this wasn't what she expected for it to be. We've been to other shabu places, and the broth doesn't taste like this. \\nMANAGER: This is Korean shabu, and this is how it tastes. You should have seen that this is Korean style on the menu. \\nME: My friend is just being nice. This broth simply tastes bad and as if it's been really watered down. \\nMANAGER: This is the same broth we have been using the whole day, and we have not had any complaints. If you want, we have seasonings to add to the broth to flavor it, but those are an extra cost. \\nME: So to make the broth taste better, I have to pay an extra charge? Never mind, I'd like to just cancel my order. I don't want anything else. \\nMANAGER: Well, we will still have to charge you for the shabu because the meat is already cut. \\n\\nIn the end, they brought out the shabu meal, and I sat there and did not eat any of it. I gave them a chance to improve my experience by letting them know from the get-go that I would not be happy with the meal. We even gave them a suggestion for how to not waste the precious cut meat. If this restaurant does not care for their customers to enjoy their meals there, and is only worried about the cost of a couple slices of meat, then I am truly disappointed and hope that they fail to make way for a better establishment in this location.

For the OCD side of me this may be the perfect burger and more often than not sits atop my burger charts.\\n\\nThe fries are cut fresh at the restaurant and are probably my favorite fries anywhere, although I will say that I hate getting to the bottom of their fry bag.

Wasn't expecting it, but WOW, this place knows what they're doing and they do it well. Such a simple yet unique menu and every ingredient that went in our mouths was absolutely delicious. No lie. We arrived on a Saturday at noon and there was no line and a handful of customers both inside and out...as soon as we ordered and sat down there was a line going outside the door! But since the menu is so simple and the staff is so large the line went super quick and everyone got their food within 5 minutes so I was very impressed.

The meat was tender and flavorful, the coleslaw was crispy and not too saucy, and the corn salsa and drizzle of homemade sauce on top were delicious. But that corn cake...OH MY GOODNESS.

My husband is a light eater so the portions were great for him, but the prices are so low you can easily get it loaded (adding a scoop of their mac n' cheese) or order an additional menu item all for what a normal lunch would cost at a greasy fast food joint. Unbelievable!\\n\\nI ordered a side kale salad (I requested no slaw or salsa on top) and a bowl of the Brunswick stew. Seriously, I was in Heaven.  I was surprised at how much food I got for such low prices: only $4.50 for such a large bowl of soup AND a large  grilled roll that soaked up the juices perfectly?! Insane! The stew was literally full of smoked shredded brisket and pork, corn and peas and a flavorful tomato broth. I can't even properly describe how tasty this stew was. And the kale salad was so beautiful and tossed lightly in their homemade dressing that was slightly sweet and absolutely-out-of-this-world delicious. \\n\\nI can't wait to visit again because the breaded artichokes, deep fried mac n' cheese balls and tasty looking little desserts are already calling my name!"},{"name":"La Stanza Diva Ristorante","address":"315 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"3.5","text":"I wanted to try this place as someone who has lived in Woburn all of her life recommended and also my brother in law had a good experience.\\n\\nMy over all experience was no more than \\"meh, I probably wont come back again\\"\\n\\nDeep fried alligator: I had it before (in Newburyport, MA) and I definitely enjoyed it. Its really hard to mess up deep fried dishes unless oil is not hot and item being fried absorbs too much of it. It definetly wasnt the case hover it would have been a better approach to put the sauce on the side instead of over the fried items as alligator pieces got soaked and musy very quickly. I still would recommend this appetizer if you ignore the reviews and happen to go to La Stanza.\\n\\nFrutti di Mare: Portion was good enough to share with two or even three. There were plenty of seafood ( Littleneck clams, scallops, squid, shrimps and mussels). Pasta was perfectly cooked Al dente. However seafood was waaay over cooked; not all of the ingredients require same amount of cooking; I am not sure if the problem was cooking them at the same time in the sauce. Mussels were inedible, while shrimp and scallops were ok. With such tasty ingredients its really hard to mess up a dish but I would have to tell you, definetly would not recommend.\\n\\nHouse salad special: Nothing to brag about though Gorgonzola and walnuts are always my favorite in salads.\\n\\nWait staff: Very friendly and accommodating.

Upon arrival I thought the place was gorgeous it had modern decor and very elegant. I expected to be wow'd, but to my surprise is was just the opposite. I attended this restaurant for my best friends birthday and we booked a private room (Even more of a reason to have been blown away). My visit started out on a good note, orders were taken for the 5 course meal and the staff was friendly. Once the first course came out it was about 45min until the next course followed. This was a trend throughout the night. There were meals that weren't cooked to the requested temperature and it took them 30 min to make accommodations. Once the staff realized everything wasn't up to the guests standards the service went downhill. They weren't attentive and didn't seem to want to please guests that were paying $120+ per person. The icing on the cake was that once we paid the waiter came back to tell us the bill was short when in fact IT WASN'T. AT THIS POINT AND SEVERAL OTHER INSTANCES THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.

I generally feel regal, myself, as a patron of this establishment.\\n\\nAfter living in Barton Hills for three years I moved down the street from this joint and started hitting it up for breakfast on rushed workdays. The tacos are pretty good. The egg:meat ratio of the breakfast tacos is a little unusual (more meat than most) but it's not gourmet white people charging you $5 per taco kind of style. The salsa is fine and the flour tortillas are fresh. All their tacos are pretty good.\\n\\nWhere Porfirio's truly excels is the workmanlike efficiency on the line. Stopping in to order, even if the place is full with workers doing the same thing as me, never delays me too much on my morning commute. Porfirio's will serve you with the quickness at normal society taco prices. Two breakfast tacos won't set you back more than $6, and that's assuming you aren't a knob and tipped out a buck or two. \\n\\nAs an added aesthetic bonus, the logo is a personified jalapeno pepper that wears a sombrero and is muscle-built.

We got the vegetarian broth and basically loved everything about the place...the food, decor, all of it. \\n\\nBUT....a strange thing happened as I was nearing the end of my meal.\\n\\nI started to feel this odd, heavy pressure on my forehead, and felt my face warming up. \\nI waited for a while but it only intensified.\\nI put down my spoon and said to my friends \\"I think I'm reacting to something.\\" As far as I know, I have no food allergies. I have definitely eaten at standard Chinese/American, and more upscale Chinese restaurants, many times. \\nImmediately, one of my friends turned to me, put her finger across her brow and said \\"does it feel  really heavy here, like there's a weight, because that's what I've been feeling\\" YES, exactly. She was super flushed, as well. The third friend had no such reaction, but said she had noticed my face getting red but thought maybe I was too close to the steam, or something. \\n\\nWe are into food (we all have degrees in nutrition) and had already tried to decipher the spices floating around in our broth because it was so tasty. \\nI asked the waitstaff if maybe the broth was made with MSG, and that was what was causing this? It had delicious umami flavor. He said no. I asked then if he could learn what the ingredients were of the broth. We were mildly curious and it was not a comfortable feeling, but it wasn't like our throats were feeling constricted, (which would have greatly concerned me)\\n\\nWhile the waiter didn't really seem to know much about the individual ingredients, I was impressed that he went into the kitchen and came back with photos of the bins that the ingredients came from. They were clearly marked in english and were nothing that would give rise to concern. But that didn't mean it wasn't disconcerting, to say the least, that two of us reacted this way. \\n\\nMy best guess at what happened is that they perhaps purchase some sort of veggie stock, or an umami enhancer that is glutamate-derived, but not technically mono sodium glutamate. Perhaps someone on the lunch crew put too much of the enhancer into the broth, and maybe the veg broth is not ordered often so no one else felt it, and I did drink a LOT of the broth, perhaps more than the average amount??...it seems strange to me that 2 of the 3 of us would have this reaction. This is only a guess. But the broth is very clear for something with such strong flavor--no way just that handful of spices thrown in for 5 minutes could have created such a flavorful broth (which I loved)\\n\\nThe flushing and forehead/sinus heaviness lasted about 20 minutes then dissipated, and I was fine (same with my friend) \\nAs no one else here on Yelp has remarked on this I would guess it was a one-off event, or I've just learned that I'm super sensitive to it (and my friend too, just a coincidence?). But I'd also probably have a smaller portion of the broth next time, and stop if I started to feel that again.

And their incredible attention to design detail. Back when I started college, some Disney employees who had worked on designing and creating the atmosphere of the Animal Kingdom Lodge visited my college to discuss the process. It was truly amazing, and I have wanted to go to this hotel since. I've been to Disney about 4-5 times since, and hadn't made it until this April.\\n\\nThe restaurant is tucked away in the lower corner of the level. It does not have a overlook of the 'savannah' with the animals, but it does have large windows that overlook a pond at the hotel. It is very beautiful inside with comfortable seating and a nice soft light.\\n\\nThey have a really amazing selection of wine that is made primarily in South Africa with a map to show where the wine comes from. I chose a white German style wine that was delicious. \\n\\nThe bread they serve is one of the highlights of the meal for me. The Ethiopian honey bread is one of the best table breads I have ever had - and my husband loved it too. The foccacia which is topped with flax seed is good, but nothing to write home about until you add the 'tandoori' spiced butter. We enjoyed this part quite a bit.\\n\\nNow the part of the meal that I must insist you order is the African flatbreads. These little pizzas, so to speak, were SO delicious. We chose the African spiced fire roasted chicken and it was amazing. The dough is well cooked and tasty, the chicken was perfectly cooked, the peppadews added a great taste, and the 'zough' sauce added a delicious spice unlike anything we have ever really had before. And bacon to add to it. I could have eaten like three of these. I would come back and order this alone.\\n\\nThe low point of our meal was our steak. The oak grilled filet just didn't compare to any other steak we have had at Disney, let alone some other places. I found it to be dry and tasteless and without enough sauce. The sauce itself was great - but there wasn't enough of it. The risotto style couscous was too starchy with the steak and hard to eat - the mix of the two ideas was weird and not my favorite thing. I avoided eating it.\\n\\nWe finished our meal with a cheese plate. The cheese plate was good, but again, not in my top. The selection and cheese itself was good, but the pairings were fairly normal and nothing I couldn't find even back here in Pennsylvania. But still good and a great finish, especially after the disappointing steak.\\n\\nOverall, I really do suggest this restaurant. It's a good one, but stick to the more 'African-inspired' dishes like the wild boar tenderloin, flatbreads, etc. The location and decoration alone is worth the visit."},{"name":"Grand Day Cafe","address":"1284 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"If I could eat breakfast here daily, I would.

One of the downfalls of tablet ordering is there is no communication so it was really awkward.

It's a pretty small space and all the tables were taken so we figured it must be pretty good since people kept coming in. We didn't have to wait long - maybe 5 minutes? - since there was a table leaving as we walked in. \\n\\nI ordered the basic Japanese Ramen - the soy-based soup - and my bf got the Mentei special where you can combine ramen and a rice dish. He got the fried chicken ramen and pork over rice. We also ordered takoyaki for appetizers. \\n\\nFirst, the takoyaki. It was pretty bad. It was not what I expected from my previous experiences with takoyaki. There was one tiny piece of octopus in the whole thing and all I could taste was the batter. I was very very disappointed. \\n\\nThe Ramen: I admit, I haven't had Japanese Ramen all that many times before. The first time I remember enjoying it was at this place in New York and since then I always go there when I visit NY. But MenTei..... the pork was so chewy and bland. The soup was meh.

I was able to get a 12:45 - 1:15 window for lunch and I'm super glad that I did because the restaurant was no longer taking walk-ins when we arrived. \\n\\nWe pre-ordered our food when I made the FastPass+ booking so we were directed to a counter where they confirmed our order and we paid using our Disney Dining Plan. Afterwards, you're given a receipt and told to find a table in the section that you want to sit. About 15 minutes after we ordered, a waitress pushing a covered trolley came over with our food. Everything was still piping hot! \\n\\nMy mom had the Salad with Seared Tuna and it was pretty good. The tuna was seared perfectly. I had the Braised Pork dish with mashed potatoes and green beans. It was so good! The pork was tender and moist and fell apart the moment you forked it. The beans were crispy and the potatoes tasted great with the pork sauce. I loved how it was still hot when it arrived. \\n\\nFor dessert, I had the Master Cupcake with \\"Grey Stuff\\". They say that the \\"grey stuff\\" is super-whipped cookies & cream panna cotta.

More importantly the service was chilly and unhelpful at best. It was a little uncomfortable to talk to the employees to ask for help with the broken down system or just plain normal chit chat (like a 'how are you' conversation). \\n\\nPerhaps by now, the arcade games have been fixed and the kinks with the pay card system has been taken care of, and the employees are nicer/more personable but we won't be returning after such an awkward, and unpleasant afternoon.

It came lukewarm, almost cold. I was in a bit of a hurry and the salad arrived shortly afterwards, so I didn't send it back to be reheated.

It was brutally cold outside and despite my honest intentions to explore Boston as much as possible, we ended up running from pub to pub, getting few shots of Jameson meanwhile , taking occasional pictures and swearing not to complain about Chicago Winter ever again. \\n Our dinner at Artu was rather spontaneous decision, but it was a good one. This Italian restaurant might feel small at first, but when you sit down, it is not that bad. You might actually begin to like their warm, cozy atmosphere with dimmed lights and smiling strangers, greeting you as if you were a good , tipsy old friend.\\n We had a bottle of Argentinian Malbec for two, Caprese salad for appetizer and  I don't remember what else, but everything was quite delicious. We spent little bit more than $100 on dinner (plus tips) , which is probably what you would pay in any downtown restaurant of this scale. \\n  The service was delightful (and I never use word \\"delightful\\" , but in this case I must, because it suites our waitress perfectly. She was witty and sharp and I would love it if she left the restaurant with us and became our Boston guide for a night)  Unfortunately I don't remember her name, even though I'm pretty sure that I told her \\"I love you\\" at some point of our conversation. \\n  Overall, I enjoyed Artu a lot. But I am one of those people that get all sentimental during the Holiday season and if you give me a glass of wine  and a good company I will love you to death. So, I'm sorry if my memories of this place are little blurred. \\n\\nP.S. My husband just told me that he had Pork Chops with peppers and pasta (it was on special)  and I ordered Veal with Potato Gnocchi , but I wouldn't know because he ate all of it while I kept talking how much Artu reminded me of Old Europe and  all that. See, I told you.  But at least now we have second opinion that confirms my 4 star review. :)"},{"name":"Ginger Root Chinese Cuisine","address":"136 Adams St","city":"Newton","stars":"3.5","text":"Sadly, I can no longer recommend ginger root. I started going there two years ago and the food was the best in the area. Over the last year, two things happened at ginger root. First, the goldfish in the aquarium in the restaurant slowly started dying off, until there were no fish just an empty tank with algae. The quality of life for the goldfish seems to coincide with the quality of food at the restaurant. A favorite was always the general Gau chicken. In my last order, most pieces were hardly chicken at all, just very chewy brown things coated in batter. And that was after mentioning that my previous meal from them was not particularly good. \\n\\nI have noticed that their dine in meals tend to be better than their take out.

Via Napoli had only a five-minute wait.  We were seated and served in the spacious dining room by a friendly Italian waiter.  Though the restaurant was quickly filling up, Leonardo patiently answered our questions.  \\n\\nWe started our meal with a family salad of fresh mixed greens scattered with Greek olives, marinated mushrooms and little red peppers that were both sweet and spicy, all tossed in a light balsamic vinaigrette.  The children got individual pizza margheritas; the adults shared a 20-inch pizza, half Italian sausage and half carciofi (artichoke.)  I asked for the addition of prosciutto for extra protein.  This was the best pizza I've ever eaten, with a thin, chewy, yeasty crust, fresh mozzarella, and  wide ribbons of delectable prosciutto.  I had thought this would just be a snack, but it was filling enough to be dinner.\\n \\nThe meal was more expensive than I had expected; instead of $7 a bowl, the family salad was $7 per person.  The total cost averaged out to $2O per person.  That may be a lot for salad and pizza, but it was a bargain compared with other Disney restaurants.  Crystal Palace was $52 per person, and the food was not as high quality.  (I guess you pay more for the photo ops with Winnie the Pooh.)\\n\\nA word of warning to my fellow Americans.  Via Napoli serves authentic Italian style pizza, which means most of the choices are \\"white,\\" with cheese but no tomato sauce.  Toppings are applied lightly, and there are no pizzas here piled with meat, unless you pay extra.\\n\\nBut as I said, this light fare was very filling.  We came hungry and cranky, and we left very happy.\\n\\nOne more thing is worth a mention.  I didn't notice that there was an automatic gratuity, so I added a generous tip.

Perhaps if you are a veg/vegan or enjoy having flavorless food that does not entice, but merely fuels your body, then I suppose this is the place for you. Do not order anything with chicken in it, unless you like chicken for the texture only; there is nothing blander than the chicken found here. The menu points out that the chicken is grilled, but I'd bet money that it's boiled and then thrown in an oven for no other purpose than to dry out. After all, it IS mostly a vegetarian spot, so I guess you can expect that they don't know what to do with meat. But it also seems that they don't know how to flavor anything (hence the very well stocked do-it-yourself sauces and flavorings on the side. Think Sriracha, soy sauce, flax, etc).\\n\\nI had a good Quesadilla there once. Which is why I'm giving it one star. But that was just cheese and tortilla.

He went one above that and brought out a small sample for my brother to try so he could see if he liked it or not, which he did! It was a bit spicy for him though so he still got it on the side and he dipped as desired.

It was just very bland. There was nothing exciting about it. It wasn't flavorful like I was expecting. It also said avocado in the description but it was an avocado pur√©e which is very different than actual avocado. The sauces were under the corn husk, too so a lot of the sauces got wasted and I had to try to scrape them off of the corn husk. Now I know. I definitely wouldn't order this entree again in the future. \\n\\nI am a big dessert person and there wasn't one dessert on this menu that I liked. I tried a spoon of my brother's chocolate dessert but it tasted so strongly of guava (or something along those lines), which I hate, that it ruined the whole thing for me. \\n\\nI gave this restaurant four stars despite my underwhelmed personal feelings because everyone else at the table (all 4 other family members) were wowed with their selections.

Quite a mouthful, literally!\\n\\nBroth - Get half house and half spicy for the best of both worlds. The spicy broth was sooooo good!! Possibly one of the best spicy hot pot broths I've had... ever! I wish it was a little less full with the chili peppers though because it got in the way of the actual food.\\n\\nMeats - Honestly, all the food came out together so we weren't too sure of what was what. We just threw everything in the pot and yolo'd it. We got a mix of hand sliced fatty beef, lamb, and lamb shoulder. Everything looked amazing pre-hot bath and tasted fresh and amazing. The only bad thing I have to say though is that the meats were REALLY thin. The pieces broke off in the soup pretty easily. Also, maybe it's just the way it's presented but some platters of meat looked like there was way less than others.\\n\\nSkewers - I got the beef and it was deliciously spicy. It has some numbing spices on it so it may be a miss for the non-spicy eater.\\n\\nDrinks - The set menu actually includes just about all of their drinks so I thought that was pretty nice. Winter melon green tea was delicious and, oddly enough, tasted as if though there was boba in it (almost like KFT). Recommend!\\n\\nOther stuff - The veggie bowl was very sad looking. All green and yellow - where was the tomato and enoki mushroom like other places?! Chinese fried dough tasted better dunked in the broth for 10 seconds, and the yam mochi was delicious.\\n\\nService - Here's where most of the stars came off. We sat down for maybe 20 minutes before we got a hold of anyone!! This is after I had to ask someone to give us the Dine Out menu too. The table next to us came after us and they got served before us, what the heck. Throughout the entire night, flagging down any waiter/waitress was seriously a struggle and we didn't have a sole person helping us.\\n\\nTLDR: Broth is amazing and food is great, for the most part.

We both had the Master's Cupcake, a chocolate sponge cake with the \\"grey stuff\\" (whipped cookies and cream panna cotta, for those wanting to know), which was delicious.\\n\\nWe were encouraged to walk around and take pictures, which we did. Service was wonderful and our food got to us quickly. But lunch is their quick service, so things may go relatively slower at dinner. After we left, we realized our son's \\"Glow with the Show\\" Mickey ears had been left behind. I told the cast member outside the restaurant and he escorted me back in to check under a podium. It wasn't there, and he asked someone else. She wasn't aware of it, but immediately went on her walkie to inform all the other cast members. I went to the table we sat at in case it was still there, which it wasn't. But within seconds, a third cast member pointed to another one who was headed my way with the ears. The fact that they had been on top of it and were so willing to help was very impressive. I know that's Disney standard anyway, but it was especially meaningful considering those ears were the *only* thing my son wanted and asked for during our trip.\\n\\nIt was such a great, beautiful, and delicious experience from start to finish.

The place had a live acoustic singer playing covers.  He we good and had a wide range of popular material and sang/played loud enough to enjoy, but not so loud I couldn't converse with old friends.\\n\\nThe food served was good.  Good enough I would come back.\\n\\nBeer options were plentiful, and cocktails were made and served promptly.  Which reminds me, service was a legit concern based on what a few other had said...but I thought the service was outstanding.  We had 2 waitresses that kept coming over VERY regularly serving our group.  If the place wasn't good, we definitely would have left after a few hours and either went to another bar or to my place as I live somewhat close by where we can make noise, drink and not deal with b.s.  This wasn't the case though, everything was good and before I knew it it was closing time.  One thing I loved about the place was it's location-it's not on top of another bar so you don't have to deal with that.  It's close to a lot of other places in many directions, so it's great for gathering mixed groups and hanging out and being able to talk.  I like to be able to have a conversation, listen to some music, get a drink quickly-ish and not be beat up price wise.  I assume there are others that like this too.  If that's the case, I recommend the place.  It probably gets stupid busy occasionally and because it's a large place it's probably a little better than some places that have a poor design-I am definitely going to consider going back some time with a smaller group-ideally when the acoustic singer is playing.   \\n\\nHope this helps."},{"name":"JoLa Cafe","address":"5915 SW Corbett Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great spot to grab something to eat with the limited choices in this area.

My boyfriend and I came in August 18th, 2015 around 9 o clock at night. Place was quiet and slow which was perfect because we wanted to make a meat/cheese board for dinner and needed some help. We were travelling from Tucson and I always make it a point to stop at a local grocery store to try a location's goodies before I leave. Since portland is foodie heaven I expected a lot from this place especially with its great yelpy reviews, but although the staff was friendly enough, they were simply unhelpful.\\n\\nHere are the problems we experienced at this store. \\n\\n- Non-existant or very small amount of locally grown veggies and fruits. The store advertised a lot of \\"organic\\" but not too much locally grown goodies. Produce was also either mealy and over-ripe or not ripe enough.\\n\\n- I asked for a good local spreadable cheese and the man I first asked admitted his inexperience and told me the cheese man just left the store so he went ahead to his manager I believe and asked him for help. I wanted some good local cheese and the manager pointed out that the Cowgirl Creamery was local and that their \\"Mt. Tam\\" cheese was from the region. I'm sorry but Cowgirl Creamery is from San Francisco, I would know.. because I was born and raised there. So no help there... \\n\\nOk moving on.. I went ahead and asked for some cans of their stump town coffee, Bre M. I believe (the girl who checked us out) went around the store twice looking for it, but there wasn't any to be found... so she suggested that we go to the coffee bar to ask for it. I went up the coffee bar and I told the man behind the counter that we wanted a lot of ice coffee for tomorrow morning so we didn't have to stop for coffee before our road trip. He apologized and said that all he had were the 12 oz to go cups and almost began to pour the coffee into them before I stopped him and said to use the growlers behind him. He said that he forgot that those were there.. and then started to pour the coffee into it. \\n\\nAfter spending a total of $88.37 on some coffee, wine, candy, bread, salmon dip, salami, and cheese I felt totally disappointed in World Foods. The price of their goods and their selection was not proportionate to their terrible knowledge of their own goods. I ended up blindly picking a cheese, their produce such as the tomato I bought was mealy, and their papaya for $3.79 was overripe.

I had two glass of wine.  She ordered two, but when our waiter discovered she wasn't enjoying the second one as much as the first -- the 2nd was his recommendation -- he replaced it for another glass of the wine she had ordered first.   We thought, and he pretended, he was being very gracious, befitting a fine establishment, when he took her full glass away and offered another selection (not even at her request -- I simply indicated she'd enjoyed her first glass more).   Imagine my surprise when I discovered we had been charged for three glasses of wine for her.   A minor offense in the scheme of things.   Such was not all however.  Despite indicating to the reservation hostess, after some discussion of pros and cons, that we did not wish to be seated at the chef's table (too close to kitchen, very large table for two), we were seated there when we arrived and no other two-top tables appeared available.   We could see some sort of plywood box (spare bench seat?) right next to our table.  How does that (the plywood) happen in such a restaurant?!  The sparse decor is nice, but the lighting is a bit too spartan, and the visible concrete finish work and painted utility conduit around the top of the restaurant's high walls was jarringly inconsistent with the prices on the menus.    Total bill was about $285 with tip, which ranks at right about the top for Boulder dining.  Frico Caldo was amazing and the rest of our meal was excellent -- on par with great restaurants anywhere.  Portions were small, and there was a considerable wait between plates -- we were there for 3 hours -- but in good company, I did not mind.   Staff was wonderful except for wine and reservation mix-up.   Frasca and the Flagstaff House are in a league of their own in Boulder, but for my money, the Flagstaff House offers a world-class experience, whereas Frasca needs quite a bit of work outside the kitchen.  Notably, I did not complain about any of these offenses while at Frasca, so I cannot offer any insight into how they might have been resolved.  In my view, complaining during a fine dinner ruins the experience for the diners, and I'd rather make the best of things and hope my date is enjoying her evening, not noticing the problems.  In the finest of restaurants, the standards should be so high as not to compel a single complaint -- I've seen it done, and know Frasca can do better.

I noticed that they add 50 cents to get your soup to go... but that wasn't really an issue for me, I was just curious about why, just soups, 50 cents. \\n\\nI tried their new fried vegi spring roll and  a noodle soup. The guy who took my order asked if I was Chinese, I said Korean-American and then he offered me a fork... seriously? I've never been offered a fork in place of chopsticks. Eating with chopsticks is a matter of honor! A fork?!?! I'm not sure if it's like this in other countries, but if you can't use chopsticks in Korea... you might as well be an animal. Just using chopsticks poorly or holding them close to the bottom is considered to be...I'm not sure what the right word is... one would appear unrefined. It was a hard insult to swallow, but I tried to assume that he didn't mean anything awful by it. Later, I found out that one of the Asian girls who works there can't use chopsticks... maybe that's why he offered me a fork... I don't know. \\n\\nOne of the things I liked about this place is that hot tea is the standard beverage. You are not shivering on a cold winter day with ice water there. I didn't get a refill, but I was eating soup, so I didn't really need it, and I didn't really finish it until the end of my meal. \\n\\nI was there at that 3pm slump between lunch and dinner, so everyone was sort of relaxing. It was nice. Everyone was very friendly, and super attentive. My food came out very promptly. \\n\\nThey have a list of shakes which include all sorts of interesting flavors including the following: soursop, taro, avocado, longon, lychee and mung bean and coco. There are more common flavors too, I just wanted to mention the less day-to-day ones. These sounded like the perfect way to cool off the tummy after eating a hot soup, so I tried red bean and coco with bubbles. MMMMM! It's so delicious! It might be my new addiction. \\n\\nWeird thing I noticed: You are requested not to flush your toilet paper in the bathroom... I just went in to wash my hands, and the sign making that request just sort of stood out to me as odd. \\n\\nAnyway, when I left I was thanked, wished a good afternoon and invited back again.

They have plenty of parking for the building but it can still get full on weekends. Especially during dinner hours. And the building itself looks dated from outside but they keep it clean inside the restaurant. \\n\\nThis is how it works. You order your food from the menu(ask for today specials) and pay for it. They will write down your name and call the name when food is ready. Meanwhile you pick up your jug of water, plastic wares, styrofoam plates & find a table for your party and wait for the food. I find their method of announcing names very confusing, I don't know why they wouldn't just call the number in our receipts. \\n\\nAlso, during weekend dinner time, it gets really busy with long lines of people ordering food and others waiting around tables for the person eating to finish and leave. And get used to all the stares from those who are waiting for the table, if you are someone who takes your sweet time to eat. Especially on Friday it gets crowded around 8 pm, as people start coming in after finishing their paryer at nearby mosque. So if you want to avoid crowd on friday and saturday, go for lunch time or dinner before 8 pm. \\n\\nHaving said all this, food here is cheap and delicious.

If I were to complain, I would say the Nehari and other stews are quite oily.

Now that it IS open, I'm slightly mixed.\\n\\nFirst off, it's not a place I'd go for a morning coffee.  It's kinda pricey for the small amount of coffee you get, and a small is quite small, especially for a morning coffee.  I could pay more for a larger size, but if this was going to be an everyday occurrence, I wouldn't do it.  I guess I won't be getting my coffee here then.\\n\\nHowever, they do have $3 goodie bags that include about 4 day-old pastries.  Not bad, the croissant lasted 'til the next day (so it was about 2 days old) and was still fantastic.  The muffins lasted for a few days, as well.  (I put a tissue/paper towel in the bag to soak up extra moisture.)  Only thing is that I didn't really care for the muffins.  The blueberry muffin had a lot of blueberries but I couldn't taste much, and it has corn in it which was tough to chew.  Maybe it was the day-old thing, but it was also falling apart and thus wasn't very appealing.  There's also a lemon-poppy muffin which was still moist on the 3rd or 4th day and had a good lemony taste.  Not my thing though.\\n\\nSo why 4 stars and not 3?  It's pricey, but it's perfect for sipping and chatting.  My boy and I went to grab a mocha and chai tea at Crema, and, though we spent more than usual for a mocha, it was still cheaper than the Burdick's mocha and not as sweet.  We loved it's semi-sweet quality and concluded that they probably use Burdicks chocolate anyway.  And like others have said, the decor is gorgeous, warm and inviting.  Fresh flowers in rectangular shapes (I love!), brick walls and a lot of seating.

Let's start with the pricetag. It is $24/adult for any breakfast entr√©e, and $14/kid for kids' breakfast entrees...as in, you could order a bowl of cereal for your kid and it's $14 (in addition to fruit and pastries). I have a hard time swallowing that pricetag since this is not even a character breakfast, but I pre-ordered breakfast for us to save time (had the option to do so online before the day of) which was a kids' scrambled egg breakfast for my child and a \\"gray stuff\\" cupcake for me, so my wallet didn't feel totally gouged as I got out there spending around $20 total for the both of us. My child's breakfast came with fruit and additional breakfast pastries so I munched on that to get my breakfast fill. I booked this reservation solely because it gave us earlier entry into the parks (park opening was at 9) so I could grab some photo ops on Main Street/in front of the castle when it wasn't too crowded, in addition to being close by Snow White's Seven Dwarves' Mine Train to get a jump start on the line. Is it worth the pricetag to dine here again? Probably not if you're talking about breakfast paying out of pocket. If you're on the dining plan, then there's definitely \\"value\\" in booking here.  If we return, we'd probably either return if we were on the dining plan or solely for lunch (which would be less expensive paying out of pocket)."},{"name":"Chart House","address":"60 Long Wharf","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"We took my father here for a surprise birthday dinner last night and it was amazing! His birthday usually falls around Boston Restaurant Week so he's been lucky to partake in some pretty swanky eateries over the years. He's fairly big on seafood so the Maine lobster was the selling point when trying to narrow down the selections. As usual, I didn't really care if he chose to eat off the RW menu or the main one, but I wanted the option to be available for everyone. \\n\\nThe complimentary valet was a major two thumbs up - parking downtown is always a headache and some of those garages are just expensive for no reason. For dinner, we both had the crunchy coconut shrimp w/rice for our entrees and it was superb. My house salad appetizer was hands down the BEST salad I've ever had, period. I don't know if it was the radishes, extra veggies or their vinaigrette but I literally wanted to lick my plate clean - it was that good! We also tried the crab stuffed mushrooms - huge mushrooms tops stuffed with shredded crab meat and cheese...heeeaven!! The rest of our party loved their selections as well, from the clam chowder and stuffed scrod to the surf and turf, we all left happily stuffed! The only problem was the bar service, our drink orders seemed to take forever, which we couldn't understand since it they were so simple - wine. But I would definitely recommend this place again.

Very nice relaxing environment with groovy wall art.\\n\\nThe foods nothing to shake a stick at either!   Pad Thai (the ole stand by) is quite tasty and a huge portion, and the Thai Passion Noodles is excelent.  \\n\\nAlso a number of good choices for you veg heads.

Trivia night and half-price appetizers, if you play. \\n\\nI've tried pretty much everything on their app menu by now, but here's the most recent \\"tastings\\".  Here's the breakdown:\\n\\nNachos - great deal and lots of food - enough to share among 3-4 people.\\n\\nBBQ Chicken pizza - tasty!\\n\\nFresh mozzarella and pesto pizza - yum, yum!\\n\\nMixed sliders - start from the lightest (chicken), pulled pork next, and sirloin (or steak?) last.... best one is the beef. \\n\\nBuffalo Popcorn shrimp - wasn't crunchy so that was a let-down, but the sauce was very flavorful and not too spicy.  \\n\\nCrab cakes - em, not so good - bit fishy and \\"old\\" tasting.  Lemon did not help. \\n\\nLocally-made sodas are a great choice for when you want some bubbly without the buzz.  (i.e., great on DD nights)\\n\\nBeers: Right now, I like and recommend their Kona Coffee stout and Chocolate porter on tap... go if you're thirsty!  \\n\\nThe one with herbs de provence was way too strong and perfume-y - even with the expectation of a strong \\"herbs de provence\\" flavor and even though I really enjoy a good lavendar ice cream at times, this was way too strong... a Junipery-explosion for me. \\n\\nThrow a couple of sides of sweet potato fries and greasy onion rings and you're ready to eat and play!"},{"name":"Potbelly Sandwich Shop","address":"10515 N Mopac Expy, Ste 300","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"If I could give this establishment a negative star review, I would.

We saw Toulouse pop up as an option for brunch and were hooked after reading through the menu a bit. Escargot, was awesome. Beignet's and the espresso sauce, amazing. Croque Madame, delicious. And the eggs Florentine, equally delicious. \\n\\nWe paired with a half off bottle of Rose that made for a great meal. The service was fast, coordinated, and extremely helpful. \\n\\nWhen we come back to Austin we will happily come back to Toulouse!"},{"name":"El Azteca Mexican Restaurant","address":"1784 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"So far in GA, I haven't been overly impressed with the Mexican food, and El Azteca was no exception.\\nWe had to waited longer than the time estimated by the host.  When we finally got our table our waitress was not very quick at serving us.\\nThe food was nothing exciting.  The refried beans were kinda plain, the salsa was ok, but the guac was also plain.  The \\"enchilada sauce\\" tasted more like marinara - just a plain tomato sauce.\\nFor the price, I'd go somewhere else."},{"name":"Buffet Palace","address":"12570 SW Center St","city":"Beaverton","stars":"2.5","text":"Wasn't impressed at all!

Couldn't be beat for everything we got- around $4 a plate, and we got tons. All day service at that, and on a Sunday there were still people piling in.\\n\\nThe staff are really attentive, and come by often to refill your tea, your water.

Every staff that took a plate, brought a glass, or refilled a drink engaged us in a way that made us feel appreciated and welcome but not imposed upon.  \\n\\nAll the waitstaff were knowledgeable about all the dishes and any wine we asked about.  All their wine suggestions were spot on and we thoroughly enjoyed them in addition to the meal.\\n\\nAll the food was everything we'd hoped for.  Good serving sizes and full of flavor.  \\n\\nThe evening was everything we'd hoped for and more.  I've never experienced such a mindful and thoughtful waitstaff.  We talked about the meal during our entire drive back to Denver.  If Frasca made a regular meal feel so exceptional, I can only imagine the thought and care they apply when you DO say it's a special occasion."},{"name":"Papagayo","address":"331 Great River Rd","city":"Somerville","stars":"2.5","text":"Waste of time and money tonight. Did not enjoy one thing. Was expecting the best mexican, i know its mediocre, but at least make it a hit meal! Ordered the queso app, came out luke warm, I could stick my finger in the middle of it without any bother. Also got the steak fajita, after waiting 30 mins to order dinner, it came out in 5 mins, you guessed it, cold, steak had been cooked off in advance, fajita plate was cold, aren't those supposed to sizzle? (They are, i used to gook tex mex, it wiuld sizzle all the way to the table) Anyways, didn't think it would get worse until the bill came the the house marg pitcher was $40, get out of town!

Reservations are a MUST. The best way to get a reservation is to set an alarm for yourself to check as soon as the next day's slots open. Days open up 6 months in advance. However, sometimes you can get lucky if you check with them at the front.\\n\\nThe food here is definitely above average and while is priced high, as is everything at Disney, it is not as expensive as you might expect. They offer only one vegetarian entree, but several starters and sides are vegetarian. Their kids' menu is, of course, very impressive and diverse.\\n\\nThe best part is the interior. The grand ballroom (main dining room) has a window made to look as though it overlooking the French mountains, completely with a faux snowfall. Side dining rooms including the gallery and the \\"West Wing.\\" Guests are encouraged to stroll throughout the restaurant and view the other rooms. The West Wing, where you can view the enchanted rose from the film even has thunder and lightning flashes.\\n\\nWrap up your visit with dessert (yes, the grey stuff is delicious) and a photo op with the Beast. If you can manage to snag a reservation here, I highly recommend you take it and find a way to make it work into your schedule. Don't be afraid to ask for more bread and butter.\\n\\nI do have one complaint and that is that there are so many empty tables in the restaurant every time I've eaten there! I feel like they could do a better job to ensure the dining room is in maximum use and therefore accommodate more diners. But like I said, other than that, a worthy Disney dine."},{"name":"Mighty Fine Burgers Fries & Shakes","address":"10515 N Mo-Pac Expy, Ste 105","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Very, very good.
