I really liked the Popeye and Olive characters taking pictures with people, but that's not a ride LoL! The water rides were also fun, and we got SOAKED! \\n\\nMost of the 4d was lame. Spider-Man was the best in that category. Simpsons was kind of bad, I fell asleep twice in Shrek, and Minions wasn't all that good either.  Twister was by far the worst attraction/ride I have ever been on. It really needs to go or be improved.  Don't waste your time on Twister. \\n\\nThe Harry Potter rides were just ok. Nothing special. The decor and details in the buildings were incredible though. We did not pay the extra money for the train. That's just too much dough.  \\n\\nSome of the employees were very helpful. Others were clueless. Not the park's fault, but still annoying. For example, at a Rocket, the employees directing people into the line were too busy talking to each other, and we somehow ended up in the express line. We got to the front and obviously didn't have an express pass. Thanks guys.....at least the guy taking the passes let us through anyway.  There are several other examples but I really can't recall anymore---Water under the bridge. \\n\\nThe one major plus was the lines were short.  The end of September is apparently a great time to go. I hear the average wait times for some of the better rides are 2-3 hours during peak season. No way, Jose!!  You would spend the entire day in line, only getting on 3 rides, 4 if you're patient enough.  To make that worse, some of there rides make you remove all of your personal items, so......no phone to pass the time.  \\n\\nMaybe I'm just getting old, but Universal is definitely more for kids than I thought.

Either way, I always get the chicken and chips, and the chicken has always been tasty. There is nice outdoor seating, but since the place gets a lot of traffic during the meal hours, it's good to have someone save a seat outside for the rest of you. I like the outdoor bar connected to the outdoor seating as well - the happy hour from 3pm-7pm is decently priced for being on Disney property. The menu is effective, the service is okay, but I wouldn't suggest sitting inside as it isn't well-maintained.

Recently we had an asparagus dish that was comprised of both roasted and raw asparagus that was simply to die for.  I had never had raw asparagus! Delicious!  \\n\\nTheir wine list is consistently good, and like a growing number of places in the area leans towards natural and low-intervention wines.

My mother and I were in town for 48 hour trip and this was where we decided to have dinner.\\n\\nFood-wise, it does not live up to the hype; though atmospherically, the open kitchen and the choices in low light and furniture all lend an intimate cadence to your meal. (But more on the open kitchen later). The service was also impeccable; but good service should be the cap to a fantastic meal, not the most positive part of a dining experience. +1\\n\\nWe decided to get the 6 course tasting menu and started out with a few drinks. Whoever the bartender is, he probably saved the night, to the extent that the one drink I ordered thrilled me in its perfect balance of liquor to mixers ratio. It was a perfect cocktail. +1\\n\\nAn amuse bouche arrived of kona kampachi with some sort of apple gastric, radishes, and microgreens. It lacked seasoning, but that was forgivable, despite the fact it did absolutely nothing to amuse my palate. 2/5\\n\\nOur first course was a scallop sashimi dish with olive oil, more microgreens, olives (castelvetrano? I don't think we were ever told), seasoned with salt and fresh black pepper. This was decent, but while the amuse bouche was underseasoned, this one was overly salty. Indeed, the salt was a little overwhelming to something as delicate as a raw scallop. 3/5\\n\\nOur next course was an Atlantic cod served over pieces of uni, a poached local oyster, microgreens (what else), and a sauvignon beurre blanc. This was also incredibly salty, and while the beurre blanc was good, I kept needing my water to help wash it down. It overwhelmed the fish and uni. 1/5\\n\\nThe third course was a housemade pasta with 40 year old age parmesan and a poached egg. I thoroughly enjoyed this course and loved how the unctuousness of the raw yolk as a sauce helped balance out the nutty, saltiness of the parmesan covered pasta. This is where I need to start speaking about the kitchen and the expediter. (But the food itself was 4/5.)\\n\\nSo, open kitchens are great, but they also open themselves up to be observed, particularly by people who love food (like myself). I loved that everyone tasted their food as they were going and re-seasoned as needed. What I was not thrilled about? While /everyone/ else in the kitchen threw away tasting spoons as they tasted, the expediter used the plating spoon to taste and then dip it back into the pot or pan to continue plating. And then tasted some more. I'm sure this has happened before in my life, where a chef or expediter has done this very behavior in a closed kitchen, but you'd think there'd be some more care in an open kitchen scenario. He did this for /every/ dish that you could taste. :P It was incredibly gross and not what I would expect of a restaurant that has as many accolades as Craigie on Main. I would have mentioned something at the time, but my sister was desperate for my mom and I to love this place and I really didn't want to burst her bubble; since this is/was her favorite restaurant in Boston. But really? Disgusting. -5 (ETA: and really, what do you say in this kind of situation: um, could you please ask the expediter to stop doing that?)\\n\\nThe fourth course was a beef two ways: seared tenderloin medallion with a beef tongue and some sort of red wine sauce on top of pureed turnips. I love my beef rare. I joke about how I like it mooing still. What I don't like is when blue beef (and this was blue) is so difficult to cut (as a tenderloin cut) that I have to wrestle with it with my sharp steak knife. I left most of this plate untouched. It was not up to the caliber I expected. (0/5)\\n\\nWe also supplemented our meal with bone marrow, as I love bone marrow on toast; it's like a fatty, rich, yummy meat butter. The bones were under roasted, leaving the marrow more gelatinous than buttery. It was disappointing. (2/5)\\n\\nNow this is where I am not sure what happened. I've never been in a restaurant situation where the intermezzo/palate cleansing course is an actual course. I'm assuming, though, that's what it is, because otherwise I'm left with 5 courses rather than 6. The palate cleanser was delicious, down to the basil seeds in lychee jelly. But it seems like it'd be hard to mess up sorbet. (5/5)\\n\\nDessert was done in 4 ways, as we had a party of four and each person got a different dessert. I loved mine; a pear tart with a butter 'butter' (like butter flavored peanut butter type deal), with an almond ice cream, goji berries, and rice puffs. The other desserts were tasty, but not my style (but my sister loved hers, and her fianc√© seemed to like his, and my mom ate all hers), so I feel the server did a fantastic job at deciding who got what; or made a fantastic accidental choice of it.

I mean, I appreciate right-sized portions, but this is like one of those times where you want to look around and see if you're on some kind of hidden camera show (e.g. Punk'd, Candid Camera). \\n\\nWe did a the 4 course menu. You can pick 4 or 6 and it's chef's choice, they'll just check if you have special requirements so it will be appropriate. If you're vegan, don't even bother... you pay just as much but will end up with very expensive salads, or a charred branch of broccoli (with nothing else).

We were seated in the upstairs dining room, and it took 10 minutes to even be acknowledged - no hello and welcome, no water poured, no \\"would you like a drink\\", nothing (and the dinner rush hadn't even started yet).  Our waiter appeared very few times throughout the evening, tried to sell us the most expensive item on the menu, was clearly disappointed when we wanted something different, and then had to be flagged down for anything else.  We were simply looking to enjoy a memorable evening out, and yes, in the end, after spending nearly $250 on two steaks, sides and a bottle of wine, the inattentive and unprofessional service made the entire experience memorable - memorable enough that we will not be back again.

YAY!\\n\\nI ordered the pork chop dinner with red beans and rice and green beans.  I wanted to see what real soul food was like.  I just didn't understand how soul food could be different from regular red beans and rice or how green beans could be *that* tasty.

The decor was very bright and spirited, pun intended. \\n\\nWhen my food arrived, Miss Lola brought it out with a smile.  I immediately dug in, and I couldn't describe the feeling.  It was like I was a part of Miss Lola's family, and this was our typical evening meal.  Kind of like dejavu,but not really.  Or maybe it was more like time warp or maybe being in someone else's body.  It had that \\"This is what your life was like\\" except I never had it before.  Whatever it is, it was cool.  Soul food makes you feel something supernatural.  \\n\\nThe green beans were strangely awesome.  I didn't know green beans could taste so good.  My pork chop was also really yummy, seasoned and crispy on the outside, moist and tender on the inside.  And the cornbread.  I usually hate cornbread, but I liked this cornbread.  It has some kick to it.  Wow.  Really awesome. \\n\\nWhile other reviewers might complain that it really isn't a \\"top notch\\" eatery, I beg to differ.  When you come to Lola's, you're like family.  You're not a customer.  You eat how your mother might have served you, informal and with some warmth.  Miss Lola does not claim to serve only prime cuts of meat; that's not the point of Miss Lola's.  I say she serves her food with some soul.\\n\\nWhen I was done.

Lest you plan on a hefty dry cleaning bill.\\n-Do not plan on going anywhere fancy afterward. You will smell like Korean bbq for at least 24 hours following your foodventure. You may accidentally find yourself picking up men as they follow your scent, though.\\n-Do not eat for at least 5 hours prior to meal. You will need ample storage space for all that meat.\\n\\nA large group of friends and I prepared ourselves for the stomach training session for Thanksgiving that is a Korean BBQ outing. Threw on some outfits we wouldn't be afraid to stain with beef marinade, and focused on what was ahead: Beef, beef, and more beef. And some pork here and there. Maybe a veggie or two.\\n\\nWe were given a little walled-off room to ourselves--think a cubicle for BBQ lovers--where we grilled pork belly, bulgogi, chicken, and nibbled on a dozen different Korean side dishes. Pork belly was thin and dry, but the star of the show was the Diamond Beef. I believe this is their highest grade of beef, with the best marinade. They brought that out last, probably because they knew the other meats were simply opening acts for the main star. \\n\\nThe staff was friendly, albeit a bit frazzled (understandably so, when you have a dozen people  asking you for water, napkins, gochujang, etc. at once), and we definitely got a decent bang for our buck. 10 different meats, plus a dish of japchae, and we walked away with stomachs about to burst, palettes unbelievably satisfied, and a bill for $27/person."},{"name":"Kal√©","address":"50 SW Pine St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"If I lived in Portland, I'd eat here daily.

The service was excellent, as usual though and my party and I had a nice time.\\n\\nThis is a chain restaraunt with soft lighting and music that makes it perfect for a business dinner. For my personal taste though, I just don't gravitate towards the antiseptic feeling chains that overprice their food and have the service staff behave just a little too formal that it feels forced. Don't get me wrong - the food and service will be fine, if you are treating a client you are almost guaranteed a positive experience. However for almost any other occassion, the prices, beer menu (would it kill them to carry just ONE craft brew...), and overly formal environment are a little much for me.\\n\\nJ. Alexander's is pretty good for what it is: A trendy (if overpriced) chain with above average food and service. I would reccomend anyone to go see for themselves."},{"name":"Upper Crust Pizzeria","address":"20 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"My life would be incomplete without the Upper Crust.  \\n\\nWhat's not to love about the crispy crust, fresh toppings and outstanding flavors?

Much larger than Medina, I sat at the bar right when I got in and was warmly greeted by the bartender/server. Upon receiving the menu, I was impressed by their Belgium Beer selection...if only I didn't drink 12 hours straight the day before, I totally would've ordered one.  \\n\\nI ordered 2 Waffles with Maple Syrup and Mixed Berry Compote on the side (toppings were an additional $1 each but worth it), a Fried Egg over-medium, and some Mixed Fruit to complete my breakfast of champions. Those waffles...crispy on the outside but so, so chewy and a lot more doughy than traditional American waffles. It was absolutely delicious. I preferred the maple syrup over the compote a little more. I'm craving them badly as I type this review out. Eggs were cooked nicely and the fresh mixed fruit came with the berry compote on top, which if I knew, I would've asked for without, but still good nevertheless. \\n\\nService was excellent.

I'm vegan and gluen free, and the selection is amazing for both meat-eaters and for me.  They cut out the guesswork, as well, clearly indicating what is vegan, what is gluten-free, etc.  They have this gluten free bhakri, which satiates my craving for nan.

Deep down inside you want all you can eat BBQ and sides! Included are brisket, pork ribs, sausage, bread, potato salad, beans, coleslaw, onions, and pickles. Pro tip: feel free to request specific cuts of the brisket. I always ask for some of the burnt ends. Between the regular and spicy sauces, go for spicy. Don't worry it won't burn your face off, it just adds a slight kick. In case you happen to have room after the endless meat, make sure to get some cobbler! Another pro tip: Refill on the meats and take it go!\\n\\nThe location is beautiful. Enjoy the scenic drive out to Driftwood, TX. If you get lost, just follow your nose. The trail of smoke will guide you to bbq food coma bliss. While you wait, you can walk around and enjoy the grounds.

The minute they found out that Austin has a few joints which are known for amazing BBQ, we had no choice but to try at least one of them out. So with the suggestion of our Uber drive the night before and amazing yelp reviews,  we decided to drive 30-45 minutes to Salt Lick BBQ. My husband and brother were ecstatic to eat there. We waited 45 minutes to be seated. The ambience and outdoor environment is amazing. They have outdoor seating while you wait to be seated with live music, popcorn and also PET friendly. You are allowed to bring your own booze so its great. Once we got seated, we ordered the combination platter to try brisket, ribs, and the sausage. Lets just say we walked in dying for amazing ribs, but walked out loving the sausage, then brisket, then finally ribs. If you do decide to go, just get the sausage, brisket, and some sides. Skip the ribs, as they are JUST OKAY, but the other two things were BETTER then OKAY. Honestly, the food was not up to par from what everyone was raving to us about. \\n\\nI would definitely go try it out, if you out to try all the BBQ joints, but if you only have limited time and can only get 1 or 2 fit in, I'd try Franklins BBQ in downtown Austin.

It's a shame that the people who say that Mike's and Modern are better like them because their taste-buds are used to the fake, high-fructose corn syrup, preservative heavy type of sweet that so many Americans are used to and think are good.  \\n\\nIf you want to get closer to real Italian pastries, Maria's is fantastic.  They speak Italian there, first of all, so nobody is going to look at you like you are from Mars when you call the mini-ricotta pie a pasticiotti like you should.  It's refreshing.  Their special pastries for the saint festivals and holidays are always delicious too.  Their zeppole for St. Joe's are to die for.\\n\\nTheir cannoli are very good and are filled to order, which is nice because you know it hasn't been sitting under a hot light all day.  \\n\\nPeople who actually live here (like me) go to Maria's and that's why it's good.  We know a tourist trap when we see (or taste) one and Maria's is definitely not a tourist trap.

I have a pretty high bar for food and this place is definitely above average.  \\n\\nI'm guessing some of the variation on rating is the food content.  I haven't tried them as they're not really my thing so I can't speak to the onion rings, wings, etc.  I've tried the pizza once and it was ok - probably just average (which in my delivery radius is one of the better places) but still good.  Have tried a couple of sandwiches and for the price they are worth it. Can be too cheese heavy but then again, it was a grilled cheese.  \\n\\nHowever, this restaurant shines on the \\"Mediterranean\\" portion of the menu.  Items I've ordered and recommend are the grape leaves, hummus, greek salad, vegetarian platter and veggie wraps that fall in that cuisine.  If you have the option, choose the tahini over the balsamic (again, sticking to the cuisine).  When I ordered the first time and saw the massive size of the salad and sides I assumed the food would be mediocre at best.  The hummus (a giant tub for $3.99) is far better than anything you can buy at (I'd argue any) typical grocery store.  The salad is composed well and ingredients quality and proportioned well.  Throw in the modest delivery charge and minimal dollar minimum and this place is a definitely in my regular rotation.  \\n\\nOh and they actually pay attention to the comments you write on your order.  For example, no coleslaw turns into extra fries and they've included hot sauce every time I've asked.  Minor I know but I've had \\"extra sauce, light cheese\\" go ignored by countless pizza places.  \\n\\nHope someone finds this useful and gives Olive Cafe a shot."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This was the most amazing pizza I ever ate!

The butternut squash ravioli are sweet without feeling like candy and every pasta dish I've had whether from the menu or off the specials are delicious.

Their whole concept is around making their pizza exactly as it was made in Naples years and years ago. All of their ingredients are from the Campania region of Southern Italy which shows how committed they are to creating pizza the traditional way. Even their hand made ovens were shipped over from Naples. \\n\\nYou order your pizza as you walk in and there are a few tables in the front room to dine at. There are also more tables in the back room where you can watch the pizzas being made and cooked. Seating is first come first serve and this place can get really crowded, so try and avoid peak times. I have heard it is BYOB/W as well, but I went at lunch with co-workers and breaking out a fine bottle of Italian red didn't seem appropriate. I highly recommend eating at Antico as the pizza is best fresh out of the oven. They also have a station by the kitchen that has bowls of fresh grated parmesan, red chili pepper flakes, fresh garlic, and other spices available to top your pizza with. This is a lot better than other pizzerias that offer the standard shakers at each table. The pizza comes really quick and is AMAZING!\\n\\nI tried Lasagna (meatball, ricotta, romano) pizza, but I will be back to try some of the other ones.

Almost every spot in the dining room has a view right into the working kitchen. This feature makes the dining experience both fun and intensely intriguing. In so many other restaurants your order goes off into the great unknown, only to have your food magically appear with no real connection to its creation.

It it obvious, to watch him, that he is seeing everything five steps ahead. Mesmerizing.\\n\\nThe food...ohhhhhh the food...I started with the Trio of Terrines. The foie gras was other worldly. Our waiter helped steer some decision making for us when ordering dinner. It was remarkable to have a waiter that actually stopped for a few moments to explain and discuss the menu with you. I decided on the Beef Ribeye, partially because of the accompanying roasted bone marrow. My wife opted for the Sable-fish in miso broth with razor clams and squid. Both were very well executed. The beef was one of the finer pieces of meat I have ever come across. The bone marrow and creamed spinach were both rich and flavorful accompaniments. The final piece to our dining puzzle was a last minute decision. At the waiter's suggestion we opted for the brussel sprouts roasted in duck fat. These just sounded too good to pass up. I mean, how can you pass up anything roasted in duck fat? To say the least, they were spot on.\\n\\nWe ended with a gingerbread cake with fresh ginger ice cream and a pineapple sauce. The contrast of the sweet pineapple and fresh ginger ice cream on top of the warm gingerbread cake was heavenly. \\n\\nThe meal, overall, was aces. Though the prices are steep, the full experience is more than worth it. Craigie is a must for any foodie...especially those excited about snout to tail dining. My only regret is that I did not opt for the half roasted pig's head, though the look on my wife's face when the option was presented to us may have made up for that...priceless. \\n\\nIf you have not experienced Craigie on Main, now is the time.

We were full with our dishes and freshly squeezed OJ. \\n\\nTheir french dinner menu is innovative and has experimental aspects to their dishes. They play with combining different textures and ways to represent the different aspects on their dishes. For example, having a frozen smashed fruit with their bread and pate dish as a palette cleanser. Some were great, but some dishes didn't work out. I found their pate to be very strong and robust and not as smooth as other resultant's pate (e.g. Fable). The main flaw with most of the dishes was that the flavours didn't harmonize well. In most cases, certain flavours overpower in the dish and made it unpleasant. Sometimes the sauce served with the dish didn't complement the flavouring of the meat at all. Overall, their dinner menu only wowed me with dessert. The coconut cloud dish was wonderfully light and flavourful with a great enjoyable texture. \\n\\nAlcohol: their beers are delightful to try and my dining partners enjoyed their mixed drinks."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Raglan Road\\n\\nBased on the reviews, we booked reservations here for our first night in town, and we were not disappointed!\\n\\nNote that this venue is located in Downtown Disney, which as of our visit in May 2015 was massively under construction.

I have lived in Ireland, and I can vouch for the authenticity. I would note, however, that this dish tasted far better than most I have had in Irish pubs. The ham was tender and flavorful, while balanced perfectly with the, yes, yes, heavenly sauces. The sides were spot on, and this is an incredibly filling dish. \\n\\nWe also ordered whiskey cocktails with dinner, and sadly, I forgot their names! I think mine was the whiskey sour and the other one had lemon.

I thought there should put garbage debris and pools of stagnant water lying around.  To make it more realistic I thought Universal Studios would put a panhandler mannequin lying on the floor with a filthy blanket as a prop and all his Earthly possessions, and a sign \\"please help me I'm homeless.\\"  I even came up with pithy stuff of how the exit signs are red and the subway map was way out of date, which displays the ignorance of Universal Studios' lack of knowledge of New York City.  The replica skyline of New York was nice although there should be more renowned landmarks as United Nations, Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building.  I enjoyed the ride, but thought maybe the tour guide should be abrasive, blunt and/or abrupt, which adds to the realism of a New York flavor.

I was immediately taken with the huge seating areas, and the wonderful lake view. The coffee was good too.\\n\\nBut, over time, I realized that going to Mozart's every other day was taking its toll on my wallet. $3 for coffee? Ouch. For my caff-fiend friends, it's a good deal because they'll put away like four cups a visit, so the bottomless coffee is worth it for them. But usually I only drink one cup, and even tea (my usual cheapo 'camp-out' cafe buy) is almost three bucks too. So, I have to be really committed to heading out there for a while to make it worth it. If they had a cheaper single-serving option (different cup maybe?) it'd have 5 stars all over it. (When I do get coffee, I just get a 1/4 cup at a time so it stays hot, and that way I can also taste the different blends, while not drinking so much caffeine that I'll be shaking in my flip-flops on the drive home.)\\n\\nThere are, though, a couple options that make the hit on the wallet a bit less: single-shot espresso, single macchiato, steamer (if you're in the mood).\\n\\nIt's definitely a solid 4 stars though, regardless of the price, for being open late, having live music, and again the wonderful view (though sometimes you have lots of birdy and insecty visitors if you're on the outdoor deck). I usually end up here at least once a week to tackle some personal projects, kick it with buddies, or just read and unwind.\\n\\nOne secret: they serve Torchy's breakfast tacos on Sunday mornings.

All three visits have been relatively consistent. First and foremost, parking is a nightmare during dinnertime. They have a tiny lot, so most of the time you have to park down the street (if you can even find a spot!). When you go in though they have a counter where you order with a large menu hanging down. All three visits, the cashier has always been friendly and have offered suggestions. They only have bottled soft drinks, so if you're like me and drink a lot with your meal, you need to buy 2-3 drinks. After you order, you go into a back room where they have a large open kitchen where they're making the pizzas. It is community seating. If you come with a big group or at the height of the dinner rush, it can definitely be a challenge finding seats and you may end up eating standing up. However, the pizza definitely is worth it. I've had the San Gennaro which has sausage, sweet red pepper, buffalo mozzarella, and onion. The pizza is always hot and fresh. The cheese is nice and melted and stringy. I love the big pieces of sausage and sweet red pepper.

Once we arrived we were promptly seated and our server brought us over some water and immediately struck up conversation and made some really great drink recommendations (hats off to the bartender, I ended up ordering way more drinks than I initially intended because they were so damn good).  Our server then began to tell us about the restaurant as we mentioned it was our first time there, he informed us of the incredibly rigorous process they go through to get ONLY the most sustainable, clean, fresh fish available- he was so persuasive in fact that I allowed myself to try some of my fiance's roll which did include fish (and it WAS incredible).  My vegan rolls did not disappoint either, I think I tried every vegan roll there- mostly because after my initial order our server brought me one of the rolls I didn't order FOR FREE just so I could try it (he also comped one of my drinks because he felt like he took too long to get it to me- a sentiment I did not share, I thought he got it to me in a reasonable amount of time for how busy they were). I can not wait to go back but I will intentionally save Bamboo Sushi for special occasions so it can remain so special to me (and because with how delicious the food and beverages are it's quite easy to spend over $100 on just two people)."},{"name":"Chambar","address":"568 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"If you are willing to spend a pretty penny, go to Chambar!\\nIt's not the most ideal place for vegetarians, but if you eat seafood it's definitely quality.\\nTheir mussels are amazing and so is their extensive drink menu.\\nI recommend the blue cheese and pear martini, it is quite an experience.

It tries to be elegant, classy, and what I think they thought Mozart's very own residings looked like, but after staring at the thicks layers of paint, every piece of molding has been painted rustoleum gold, and the display cakes in the windows are graffitiedwith finger prints imprinted,but the baby grand piano in the corner wraps it all up the enviornment in which it doesn't feel as outdated as your conscience is trying to play it off to be. \\n\\n  Now, the food. I had some breakfast sandwich (I think it was called the wolfgang) which consisted of smoked turkey, thin sausage, swiss cheese, and two fried eggs topped off on a nice croissant. It's a heavenly breakfast sandwich. Perhaps I'm biased, because in the past I have made breakfast sandwiches very similar in my own homestead like this, but it was delcious.

Way over the top, and way phony. Seriously, it was like nails down the chalkboard. \\n\\nAfter we ordered two burgers and two fries, we sat waiting for FORTY FIVE minutes. No exaggeration. Forty five minutes. This was the same case for the 30 other people who were sitting, but not eating.

He'd cook a set of patties until they were done, but instead of dropping another set of patties, would stop to dress all the just-finished burgers. After they were done, he'd THEN drop another set. This is basic line cook 101, and this guy either didn't know, or didn't care. He seemed to care more about what music was playing at an obnoxious volume. \\n\\nSpeaking of which, when the dining room was filled with 50% families with young children, I'm really not sure that Ozzy, Mot√∂rhead, Danzig, the Misfits and death metal is appropriate. Eventually that 'set' was over, and the other employee started playing hip hop which was filled with 'my bitch' this and 'my bitch' that.

Don't miss it if they have it on special. \\n\\nGarlic Bread... oil just dripping off the bread, I would have been satisfied with the house bread to sop up all the delicious sauces. Let's face it, there is garlic in everything. \\n\\nMain dishes: \\n\\nPesce del Mar with Linguine and Fra Diavolo sauce. No pictures... I was so excited. My apologies. But use your imagination and picture muscles, clams, scallops, and shrimp bathing in a spicy marinara sauce, all for your pleasure.

Tender bites of chicken layered with cheese and sauce... just like my mom used to make. \\n\\nLinguine Carbonarra: peas, prosciutto, and cream.

The dumplings are plenty however the pork filling is small and slips easily from the dumpling wrapper as these little wontons fall apart - a spoon is necessary to eat the dumplings. The chicken broth is also lacking the traditional richness that makes this soup popular - there is no essence of coriander, clove, anise and fish sauce that are so frequently used in this bowl of broth.\\n\\nThe whole experience is an unfortunate introduction to a cute little spot in Arlington Center.

I feel the same way when I see other contrived and marketed oxymora, like \\"Low-Fat Pop Tart\\" and \\"My Spouse & Best Friend.\\" \\n\\nSo judging from the food, this place must be one good bar. I thought my first taste of a beer-battered onion ring was great, until I wasn't able to bite through the onion, and it just kept coming out of my mouth like one of those weird handkerchief tricks. I discovered it was a long sliver of cooked onion skin, which can be difficult to chew. My \\"Beto Burger\\" wasn't bad, just overcooked and over-salted, and my lunch companion could only finish half her club sandwich before giving up on it. Incidentally, we're going to stop here for a moment and do a little sidebar sequence: \\n\\nPeter: \\"Nyah! Why doesn't this guy ever say who he eats with?\\" \\nLois:   \\"Because he'll only do that with an ROTDC or UYE, Peter!\\"  \\nBrian:  \\"You got anything on that remote lower than Mute?\\" \\n\\nBack to our story: I'll cut them some slack for the food, since they've only been open a few weeks and may still be tweaking the kitchen. As far as the bar part goes, it's a huge place with a great patio, but neither of us were drinking at 11:30 in the morning, so I can't tell you anything about the booze. I guess I could have asked some of the people in there who were drinking. And they do have nine TVs, but seven of them are clustered around the bar counter itself; if you're going there to watch sports, I'd consider getting there early. \\n\\nRight offhand, I'd give this place two stars, but I'll make it three because our waitperson Audrey was sharp, personable, and genuinely nice.

The restaurant recently moved to the newish West-field Mall. A lot of people in SF were not too happy about it, but it was great for me, as I could go for lunch. When I found out we were moving to Atlanta, I think I went to Straits 4 times in 3 weeks. On one of my last trips, I saw the newspaper clipping, saying that Straits would be opening in Atlanta, with the help of Ludacris. Boy, was that a good day.  :o)\\nSo, we took some friends on Friday night. I knew it was going to be different than the SF location and that they would probably be playing loud music, but the food is soo good here, nothing else mattered. The interior was pretty cool and I was so happy to see that they had a nice wine selection. We were seated upstairs and I had raved the whole way there about the food and now I was starving.\\nI was put in charge of ordering the food and the husband ordered the wine. Well, first he tried to order some Sake, but the waiter had no idea what he was asking for, so he went with wine. I ordered all my faves and a few new items. The place was full, but not packed. We put in our order and our first few dishes arrived, without the Jasmin rice. No big deal, as I really wanted it to go with the basil chicken. Everyone was enjoying the food and then it pretty much stopped coming out. The plates were cleared and we sat and sat. Oh yeah, I forgot about the wine, as did the waiter! When he did bring it out, he poured my husbands glass to the rim. By the time he got to the fourth glass, there was barely a taste left for our guest. Not good.\\nIn the mean time, I noticed that Ludacris was walking around the room and he did stop by to say a quick hello. Kinda cool,but I was here for the food and now I was wondering where the rest of it was??\\nFinally the basil chicken came, but without the rice. We waited, then we asked 3 different people. Nothing. We decided to eat it without the rice and when the waiter did bring it out, the Chicken was gone. By then we finally got the attention of the women working the floor. She said no problem and she would get us another basil chicken. She did, but they charged us for it! We still had the garlic noodles coming, the item that I  had gone on and on about. They were as good as I had said, but would have been better with the rest of the food!\\nI have to say this was some of the worst service I have received in a long time. I was so embarrassed that I had recommended the place, I kept apologizing to our guest. Thank god the food was good, but I won't be coming back anytime soon. My advice to Ludacris, fly your employees to SF, so they can learn how to serve food and wine!\\nBTW, my best to the chef, as the food is incredible!!"},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Went on a Friday night.

Nothing extraordinarily good or bad to report, until recently. We had a large group here for a dinner party. We were seated at a hibachi table, only to see a small COCKROACH scurry across the table right in front of us! They apologized, wiped the table down, and moved us across the room. \\n\\nAs we all sit down at the next table, ANOTHER cockroach scuttles across the table and over plates right in front of myself and my husband. A waiter, and another person from our party were witness. My husband quickly swatted the insect off of the table, on to the floor, and squished it. The waiter came out and wiped down the table again, and gave us new plates. \\n\\nHowever, a waiter (stupidly) said something along the lines of explaining that they were fighting an infestation? And that they hide between the tables and the hibachi burner, so when they turn the heat on, they run out. SAY WHAT??? I'm sorry - but if you KNOW that you have a problem with bugs, CLOSE THE DOORS and BUG BOMB the place!!!  Not wanting to cause a scene though (or have to find a new place for 15 people to have dinner at 6pm) we didn't say anything and just let dinner continue. \\n\\nHowever, I only ordered sushi (which was delicious - hence two stars, instead of one). I didn't want to eat ANYTHING off of that hot, silver, bug-stage of disease. And I know for a fact that someone else in our party did not eat a single thing, despite being moved and her not knowing of the second cockroach. (Also, she ordered steak and was served chicken. But whatever. She wasn't going to eat food from a cockroach motel anyways.) \\n\\nI also gave them two stars, instead of one, because: they moved us, apologized, did their best, the sushi was delightful, and in an attempt to make up for the cockroach incident they comped my husband's dinner. But I suppose that's the going rate for an exterminator now. Unclear. \\n\\nAt any rate, no one in our party that night will ever go back.

Well, it's located in a new neighborhood that people are still discovering. But it's definitely good. So I think readers should go give Kika a try rather than snicker about them not getting big crowds every night.\\n\\nThe spousal unit and I have been there a couple of times in the last month.

Our first visit we tried a few others. All very good. \\n\\nThey have good wine they pour by the glass, and great mixed drinks (the Kika 350 was very tasty).\\n\\nMoreover, this place is friendly.

I mean no one is dim-witted or mean-spirited enough to abuse restaurant workers as a matter of course, tip horribly - and then lash out like caged weasels when they write nasty little missives trashing \\"the help\\" here on Yelp.

Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed it but there where quite a few things lacking.\\n\\nThey are missing the boat in the Jurassic  Park area completely! There should be a ride with the jeeps and encountering the dinosaurs. Most of the area was games and food stands. Im not one to want to get soaking wet or for rides with steep drops and those seemed to be the only ride options for this area. An 85 foot drop into water (think splash mountain) isn't what I wanted to do. They did have a gliding ride but that was only for children. You HAD to have a child accompany you onto this ride. Im guessing due to weight restrictions. They did have an area inside where you could see baby dinos being born, and we had a good laugh when we made dinos of our own mixed with our DNA but the rest seemed to be focused mostly towards children. \\nIf they updated this like the harry potter area, it could be great!! Throw in some life sized dinos, a jeep ride, more up to date technology in the interactive part and perhaps a T-Rex replica in the middle of it all and it would have been much more awe-inspiring. \\nbut our entire party left this area wanting more. I am hoping with the new movie coming out next year that they will put some money into this section of the park.\\n\\nI do have to commend them on the foliage in this area, beautifully well done!\\n\\nThe mummy ride was by far the best ride we went on. I somehow got talked into doing it (im terrified of rides) and even though I screamed all the way through, I would go on it again. You could feel the fire and the effects where great even for an older ride! The only wait we had was just running through the line. The waiting area could have been a bit lighter though, I tripped a few times on some stairs because I couldn't see. Its a roller coaster type ride with turns and some smallish drops but it doesn't go upside down. I think at one point you do go backwards. There where props I think used in the original movie throughout the line. I definitely recommend this ride to anyone willing to try it. I would even wait in line for it again!\\n\\nThe men in black ride was terrible. Super out-dated and the instructions on where to shoot the aliens that where not in the target practice where non-existent. The cart would randomly spin near the end of the ride which while it was a bit fun seemed out of place. All in all it was poorly executed, old looking, and overall just \\"eh\\"\\n\\nWe saw one of the parades with spongebob in it which was fun. We happened upon Patrick Star later on in the day and when I approached him to get a picture he started running away due to his break time. I understood and found it funny that he actually RAN from me but come on! No one else was around and I just wanted a picture. Im still laughing about the guy running in a Patrick suit though.\\n\\nWe also saw the live animal show featuring some of the animals in movies (although I HIGHLY doubt they are the actual animal stars). But if you need a rest from the heat and sun, this was a cute and enjoyable show.\\n\\nI took a whole entire star off for the fact that I couldn't find a band aid for the life of me. My shoes decided to cut into my heel and I was bleeding all over them. I was told there where people in red and a white cross on their shirt walking around the park with band aids but I never once saw someone. We had to ask 4 people in different stores for them as they all kept telling us to go other places. One lady told us to go to the store with Storm on it but she meant Rouge. Come on lady you work here and you don't even know your super heroes? But each place had to scramble and look for band aids and turned up not having any. \\nWe finally made it to guest services and waited for an eternity until we finally figured out that we could just go to the side and ask for them.

Are you willing to wait in a long queue for a while so you can sit inside? Do you have enough cash to pay a little less $20 for your dish? If you said yes to all of the questions above, this place has your answer. If you are looking for just the one and only place for a seafood pasta dinner in the Italian North End, where the prices are moderate for a meal, then this is probably one of the best choices. \\n\\nIt's been about two years since I last ate at this place, but I finally got a chance to revisit again after hanging out with a couple of people I know from the Toronto area that were visiting. I decided to get the $19 Fruitti di Mare, which had mussels, shrimp, calamari, clams and scallops. I decided to get Fra Diavolo Sauce, which is a red tomato sauce with a little spice. The people that I know got the $20 special dish where you get half of a lobster, with mussels, clams, and shrimp doused in the Giacomo's sauce, which is a red tomato flavored sauce similar to the Fra Diavolo sauce, but with no spice at all. The pasta served was linguini, which is a thin, flat, wide, but curvy noodle-shaped pasta. \\n\\nPasta portions continue to be excellent. One pasta dish should be enough to fill the stomach of a very hungry man. The seafood is freshly cooked and tasty. I liked the Fra Diavolo sauce more than the Giacomo's sauce mainly due to the spice in the flavor. The Giacomo's sauce was good, but tasted almost like an ordinary but good quality tomato sauce. The shrimp was meaty and plump, and the calamari had a nice tender texture. Lobster is freshly cooked, and I spent a considerable amount of time eating every piece of meat on my lobster piece. Scallops were tender and also tasty, but were not too big. The clams and mussels were tasty, but are really small. \\n\\nWe also had a small plate of Calamari as an appetizer, and it is probably one of the tastiest calamari dishes I had. Nice and crispy on the outside, and tender and chewy on the inside. The sauce provided made the calamari even tastier. Bread portions are a little small, but I got my stomach full from eating a lot of the pasta.\\n\\nSince this place is really popular and the queues are long, I think a good time to come here is probably on a weekday at around 8:30 PM and not on a Friday or a Saturday evening. The wait was considerably shorter on a Monday than on a Saturday. Service is actually good, the server was really nice and able to answer any questions you may have. They are really nice enough to give you some tools to help you eat your lobster. They only take cash, so make sure you have some $20 banknotes in your pocket. The bathrooms are small, and it feels like you are actually going down the deck of a boat when you walk to the bathrooms. \\n\\nOverall, this place continues to be a representation of Boston's seafood pasta dishes at its finest. If you are looking for a spacious and big restaurant, this is probably not the type of place I would recommend, but if you are looking for an almost excellent seafood pasta dish at a moderate price, and you are willing to sit at a small table, then this is a great choice."},{"name":"Fairmount Grille","address":"81 Fairmount Ave","city":"Hyde Park","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here for the first time last weekend with my boyfriend and we weren't too pleased with service and the food.

The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the environment might not be right for everyone. Basically, you order your pizza at the counter by the door when you come in. Then you enter a fairly big room with long tables and the kitchen and ovens in the back. It's all open, so you basically eat right there where they are making the pizza. It's crowded. This is why some people may prefer to just get the pizza to go. It's family style tables and you have to hover over people while they eat so you can grab a place to sit as soon as they get up. It's also BYOB, so don't forget your wine opener!\\n\\nWe went after the huge snowstorm in Jan, so figured it would be a little less crowded. No such luck. There were people standing everywhere, all the tables were full, and people were standing against the walls eating their pizza out of the box. It's a fun environment, but you have to be pushy! Don't feel bad standing over people while they eat to stake out your table, otherwise you will never get a seat. \\n\\nMy recommendation- DONT order your pizza first. Go in and wait for a spot to sit, then once you get a spot at a table send someone to order your pizza. This is because the pizza comes out super fast (we ordered two pizzas and it took 5 mins), so if you order first and try to wait for a spot to sit, your pizza will most likely be cold by the time you get a seat."},{"name":"Broadway Station Sushi","address":"1638 E Broadway, Suite 101","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Lovely staff, fast, reasonably priced.

First, the service was unbelievably slow. It took roughly 40 minutes to get our dishes. There were only 5 tables occupied with one server! Terrible service! The chips were stale, but edible. The best part of the meal was the salsa. It was pretty tasty. I tried the fish tacos and they were just okay. I could have picked any fish taco stand and it could have been just as good or better. As for the chicken enchiladas, they were bland. The grilled chicken was on the dry side with no spices or any kind of marinade. Just plain chicken wrapped in corn tortillas with a mole sauce drenched over the top, with a squiggly line of crema to add to the presentation. Sure, it looks pretty, but $15 for three enchiladas, you better add some flavor. The sad part is, it took 40 MINUTES to get my food on a dead night. Hoping the delay was because they really spend a lot of time preparing your food, I was totally disappointed. RULE #1, if there isn't anyone checking whether the chips are fresh or stale, that tells me right there, this place is not run very well.

Fortunately we found one, but unfortunately it was too loud (completely understandable) and decided to wait for them to call us. Since it was so crowded we decided to at the patio by the heaters to allow new customers to enter. We wait over an hour and notice people coming in after us without a reservation are seated before us. Looked at phone, no phone call or missed calls. As a result we walk in a stand with the crowd behind the reservation counter. After another 10 mins or so they realize that we have been there far too long and ask for our names. After looking at the reservation list and flipping back some pages, they realize they forgot us. They offered to take our wine order to remedy the situation, but they didn't even offer to take the order after handing back the menu. The hostess then says the next table will be ours, and she walks us to the nice patio area but once we get there, another party has occupied the table. Then we wait again for another 10 mins, and she walks us back into the bar area and offers us the same table we found on our own an hour and a half earlier. Heard the paellas were good...but didn't want to wait close to another hour in the room we had decided not be be in an hour earlier.

That goes to show you how good this place is. \\n\\nA few tips for first timers\\n-place is small, there's a chance you'll be elbow to elbow with someone else not in your party\\n- cash only\\n-in cold temperatures, dress warm because there will be a wait.\\n-open for dinner only\\n-giacomo sauce is dish licking good\\n\\nYou wont regret visiting here."},{"name":"Jim's Restaurants","address":"9091 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"My family and I were at this Jim's location two days after the Charlsie negative review.

This is the first thing the host/hostess will ask when you walk in through the door and maybe it's just me but felt like I'm given a condescending silence when I reply \\"no\\". In majority of SF restaurants there are portions of the restaurant or a number of tables dedicated to walk-ins. But most of the restaurants here we were either quoted a long estimated wait time for a table or offered the bar once they found out we did not have a reservation.\\n\\nServers here are extremely friendly and we had a nice chat with the server at the bar which where we we ended up sitting. After he found out we were from SF he talked about how he enjoyed his visit there and how his home country in Europe (didn't say which country) is filled with boring old castles. I couldn't disagree more. \\n\\nFood here was good but not 100% convinced this is true French (Parisian) cuisine. But I could very well be wrong. My husband enjoyed his steak and frites. He mentioned the beef tastes very different than what we'd  get at home in the States. A large portion of fries accompanied it. And I thought we Americans served large portions! \\n\\nWe didn't have space for dessert so we skipped it. \\n\\nWe were initially skeptical about this restaurant as it sounded rather touristy but was overall pleased with our dinner and time here.

Coming back from Japan a few months ago, my husband and I have had a harder time finding good sushi, and Bamboo did not disappoint! Our server was so knowledgable and friendly and gave us some really great recommendations- the MSC Albacore Carpaccio was to die for. We usually go for nigiri over rolls, but the Garden of Eden roll he recommended was quite possibly the best roll either of us have tasted. The ingredients complimented each other so well yet seemed so strange and different. As he mentioned, the roll didn't even need soy sauce or wasabi, it was perfect on its own- it was actually really spicy, which we love, but the heat level may be too high for those who like it mild. The speciality nigiri orders we got were good, but not as impressive as the carpaccio and the Garden of Eden. I had a nigiri order of their special habanero infused masago roe with a quail egg atop, which was fantastic! Again, our server was so helpful and gave me a complete breakdown of each type of roe they had. He also made us each a blackberry lemonade that was very tart and unique. My mother-in-law ordered a Spider Roll, and the taste of it was great, but none of us are huge fans of the \\"futomaki\\" large style rolls that are too big for one bite.\\n\\nOverall, I fell in love.

Plenty of meter or nearby lot parking also makes for an easy dinner out. \\n\\nLots of options for great fresh oysters, and their crudos, ceviches, and tuna tartare are all very good. The menu changes a bit so its tough to recommend any one dish. The hot lobster rolls are loaded with fresh lobster and the roll is toasted perfectly, fresh bluefish was excellent, bucatini with shrimp and brocoli rabe was a tad on the salty side but still tasty, and seared bass was cooked perfectly and made a nice fall entree with pumpkin and apple. \\n\\nNot a fan of the clam chowder simply because i like a more traditional chowder and theirs stands apart from the chowders we have around town by being more smokey and meaty and lacking much of a clam flavor. If they simply named it differently, i might enjoy it as a row 34 chowder, but once you tell me its clam chowder i have a lifetime of expectations to draw from and their chowder just comes off wrong. \\n\\nNo cocktails, but if you're a beer geek, they have an impressive selection of rare sour and wild beers, including several on tap, and several unusual pale ales and german beers.

I didn't realize how much of a regular she was until we walked in and she knew literally every employee that was working that night. We got a seat at the bar and I was told it was 1/2 price bottled wine night (it was Sunday).....after the day I had at the Georgia Dome, can you say hells yeah? I had the pleasure of being taken care of by two cool ass bartenders, Grady and Michael C. They were very knowledgeable and personable, which I can really dig. I forgot the bottle(s) of wine we had, I do know they were red and I was told by my friend to \\"trust\\" her, and I'm glad I did....they were very good. On to the food, I wish I would've saw the platos principales portion of the menu, but I missed it. I ended up getting a Spiced Beef and Chicken Empanadas, which were really good (the beef one was slightly better though, but not by much). I also had some of the Spinach Chickpea Casserole and for dessert, I had the Warm Chocolate Hazelnut Indulgence & Coconut Ice Cream...also very good dishes. Like I said earlier, I wish I would've saw the bigger plates b/c i'm a 225lb man and it would've taken me about 10 empanadas to get full, which could also kill the pockets at the same time. They're not the most expensive tapas I've ever had, but they're not cheap either.

I lived in Austin for 10 years and never made it out to Driftwood, but tried the Round Rock location and wasn't as impressed. Then I moved to NYC and my passion for Texas BBQ intensified (you miss what you can't have, I guess)... And every time I come back I try at least 2 new establishments. \\n\\nMy friend (fellow Texas BBQ enthusiast) & I finally made the trek out on a Wednesday for lunch. I knew that we would do the AYCE option because we both can put down quite a bit of meats in one sitting. \\n\\n*The AYCE \\"system\\": no matter what, they bring out a \\"sampler\\" plate for you filled with three cuts of brisket (\\"burnt\\" ends, moist, lean), sausage, and ribs. I don't know if this is because this was our first time, but I was informed that I can't just get started on lean brisket and ribs. \\"Trust the system\\", they told me. What? I am not sure that telling a lawyer-to-be to trust the system is a good idea when we are taught to push the envelope. #hangry\\n\\nFINE. I will \\"trust\\" the system... Only because we drove out here, I am weak and malnourished, and you hold all the BBQ and hence the bargaining power. \\n\\n*The BBQ: \\n-I ended up liking the burnt ends (so flavorful!) to my great surprise since I don't love burnt anything. \\n-the sausage was okay. Good, but nothing OMG-they-better-serve-this-in-heaven about it. \\n-the ribs were really good. They fell off the bone and weren't just filled with fat. \\n-lean/moist brisket. This is a divisive topic, but I always love lean brisket better... It's harder to make flavorful without throwing a bunch of salt at it. My gauge for how good the brisket is in addition to \\"The Experience\\" itself, is also dependent on how nauseated I feel after getting stuffed on BBQ. If I feel SO GROSS, they've oversalted the BBQ. If I feel like I can eat another 10 plates and BBQ still looks good, they did a good job. Salt Lick Driftwood did a good job.\\n\\nThe Verdict: so amazingggggg. I cannot believe we ate so many plates. I would name our waiter too for the good service but I don't want him to get in trouble for giving us more BBQ after we had already had 7 plates. See the pictures... We had mostly brisket and yet our plates still were stacked with rib bones. This is likely why I am single? Haha.

So, we got there around opening, but she wasn't there. Fair enough, as she has several signs on her door that say basically that if she isn't there, she's out feeding the homeless, and she'll come over if you call her. Well, who can argue with that? So we waited about half an hour to see if she would just show up, but she didn't so we were about to call her when a man who was in his car who must have already called her told us that she would be there in about 20 minutes. So we were okay with that since we had time, and we chatted with some semi-regular guests who were also waiting. But when Lola gets there, you know Lola's coming. First you see a little yellow short bus coming down the street, and then you look in the window and you see Lola cheerfully waving at you. So she stopped and let Eli (her business partner) out, and she went to do her thing, and then Lola parked and got out, and then proceeded to hug every single person who was waiting outside. I normally am not a touchy person, and I especially dislike hugs, but coming from Lola, who was at that time a woman who I had never spoken to, seemed oddly natural. So then she let us in, and we took a seat, and she has all sorts of quirky decorations, and a sofa piled up with clothes that I assume she was donating. Now, I should say, that it was a charming little place, but I was a bit apprehensive since I've never been much of a shellfish fan, and the menu sans shellfish dishes was fairly limited. I asked for the Chicken po'boy, but she apparently was out of bread, and she was very apologetic, but it was fine. So I got the fried chicken wings with Mac and Cheese and candied carrots as the side, and my friend got the crawfish etoufee with mac and cheese and cabbage as sides. So, I will say, it did take a little while for the food to come out, but Lola's is not a place that you would go if you were in a time crunch, and frankly, it's not the kind of place that you would want to go if you were in a time crunch, because it's as much about the experience as it is the food. Now seems as good a time as any to mention that the general air of the restaurant is that of a family dinner in someone's home. Normally I'm not one to converse with other patrons of a restaurant, but it's something that just happens at Lola's, and it feels totally natural given the atmosphere. So if you go in, you'll be there for a while, and if you're waiting for your food, you don't mind that it takes a little while. As we were the first batch of patrons to come in after it opened, nothing had been made yet, and suddenly, the smell of soul food permeated the air, and we all knew what that meant. Oh my goodness, that smell. So after a bit, the food came out. It looked really good, and I was excited. Now, I know that fried chicken is a touchy subject for some people, and I can't say that my life has ever been deprived of good fried chicken, but I have come to terms with my prejudices, and I am prepared to come out and say that Nubian Queen Lola can say that she has made the best fried chicken that I've ever had. Oh my goodness. It was perfectly seasoned (it was a bit salty, which I really like, but if you're sensitive to salt, then it might be a bit much for you), and the skin was perfectly crispy, without so much as thinking about being mushy in any way (if there's one thing I can't stand, it's mushy chicken skin!), but somehow the inside was perfectly juicy, on wings no less! I don't know how she does it! She's magic! My life has been changed forever! And the mac and cheese, my only regret is that it was so sadly overshadowed by the chicken, because it was up there as some of the best mac and cheese I've ever had. You know that wonderful feeling when you take a bite of mac and cheese and you have to twist your fork several times to get the resultant string of cheese in your bite? That was every bite of Lola's mac. Oh my goodness. And the cabbage and the carrots were delicious too. I simply can't say enough good things about the food. And the cajun iced tea. I'm not normally one for tea with any kind of sweetener in it, but I guess it was tea mixed with mango juice and this and that, and it was yummy yummy yummy. \\n\\nSo, we finished the food and let her know how good it was, and a little while later, she ran out of the kitchen with a little fortune cookie dish, and told us that we had to try her pecan dessert, which was kind of a soft praline type deal, and that was delicious too. So we paid (a bit extra for donation purposes, as is suggested), and then she hugged us again, and we were satisfied."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"This place has had the best BBQ food that I have tasted.

Beautifully silky and buttery with plump shrimps in the center and Parmesan crisps for a salty texture. Sweet green peas were thrown in to provide a different taste to each bite. It was definitely rich and flavorful. The Shepard's pie on the other hand was a bit too heavy. The mashed potato was a bit cold so it acted like cement and the beef mixture was greasy.

No need to ask for extra pita - they provided an ample supply.

My guest ordered off the lunch menu and he got a cheesesteak sub.  I didn't see where there was an option to do a combo so we ordered drinks separately. \\n\\nOne great thing that I would like to point out is that they use real eggs on their sandwiches.  They fry them hard so that there isn't any runny yolk. Love that they have chosen to use the real thing instead of the liquid egg mystery that most places use.\\n\\nThe meat is placed on the grill to warm up.  The bagel is toasted nicely.  The only thing that I was a little disappointed with was the amount of steak and egg you receive.  I was expecting a little more meat on my sandwich.  The sandwich itself was really good!  I'm usually not a bagel fan but this was worth it. \\n\\nI tasted the cheesesteak and that was very good as well. You can get whatever toppings on it.  You have to get their macaroni salad.

We ordered family style and shared.  Giacomo's separates their menu by type of pasta - so there's a linguine section, fettuccine section, vegetarian section, etc.  You choose your pasta, your seafood, and the type of sauce you want on your pasta (there's Giacomo's, Fra Diavolo, Pesto, and some others).\\n\\nFrutti di Mare with Giacomo's Sauce ($19): we got two orders of this because everyone said this was the best thing here.  It's the best Frutti Di Mare I've ever had!  Chunks of mussels, clams, shrimp, and scallops mixed with linguine in a creamy tomato based sauce.  Next time, I would want to try the Frutti di Mare with the Fra Diavolo sauce because I actually liked that more than the Giacomo's Sauce!\\n\\nHomemade Fusilli with Lobster and Shrimp in the Fra Diavolo Sauce ($26): this isn't on Giacomos' regular menu, but was on the Specials menu on their blackboard posted in the restaurant.  The fusili is homemade.  It had a very chewy texture and you'll see very few similarities from those sold at your typical market.  It came with large chunks of lobster and shrimp.  At first bite, this dish doesn't taste as good as the Frutti di Mare, but upon further inspection, I found the tomatoey Fra Diavolo Sauce to be quite amazing.  Next time I'm putting that sauce on linguine, which would probably pick up more of the flavors in the sauce.\\n\\nButternut Squash Ravioli ($15): creamy and sweet (maybe a bit tooo sweet) and comes smothered in a delicious mascarpone cream sauce.  I bet it'd be spectacular to dip bread into this heavenly sauce.\\n\\nWe also got the Large Fried Calamari appetizer ($10).  The batter was crispy and it came with a nice tomato dipping sauce.  They fried the calamari along with some peppers to give this dish a nice little kick.  \\n\\nEverything at Giacomo's was fresh and delicious.  The pastas were all perfectly cooked to Al Dente and the sauces were flavorful.  There's probably not a bad thing on the menu, but if you were to get ONE thing, get the Frutti Di Mare.

I wasn't really sure what the place was all about, so I grabbed a to go menu and let people go ahead of me. When I finally did get in line, it was a bit chaotic. But, it was lunch hour, so that's to be expected. I ordered the Chilean Zucchini bowl, and was glad i asked about what the Yumm sauce was. The guy who helped me at the counter pointed me to the bottles of it in the cold case, and I was able to read the ingredients. Turns out, the sauce has an ingredient on my no-no list. Instead of the Yumm sauce, I got it with the avocado and cheese and stuff. I also ordered an ice tea. This is my bog complaint. The cheapest beverage on a menu for a restaurant to make is ice tea. When you A) charge me $1.50 and B) you don't say on your menu what size said drink is, and then I get it and it's tiny, we have a problem. Again, the overhead on ice tea is ridiculous. You can give me a bigger size for that price, or I'll be happy to walk the half block to Mickey D's and get a proper size tea for a buck. My only other complaint was the chaos of waiting for a to go order. There was no place to sit or stand really, and since it was the lunch rush, it just screamed, of the half dozen or so of us milling around, that we were in the way. I would suggest a little more organization on that end. As for the food quality, it was actually pretty good. I didn't actually get to eat mine until I got home to Hillsboro a couple hours later, but it was still tasty! AND the container it was in didn't open up in my bag or leak. Always a good thing!

It was perfectly cooked, fried golden brown, and tender on the inside. We had the Zuppa di Pesce, and homemade Fusilli with Lobster and shrimp. Amazing! The Zuppa served two, but could have easily feed the three of us. Everything came steaming hot, the accompanying linguine was al dente, as was the fusilli, and the sauces complimented the seafood on both dishes.

We were told by a woman at the door to go sit in the back corner, no friendly greeting, or attempt to walk us to our table.

Well this is one of those places I've neglected to write a review for.  I mean after 140 people what more can I add. \\n\\nNow normally I stay away from the Sports Bar scene, simply because as a Marketing guy, I know Sports Pubs and Bars are geared directly at one type of customer, and 90% of the time that customer is not me.  I love the Blazers, but 9 out of ten times I've happy to watch them at home.\\n\\nOkay on to Blitz Ladd.  First off, it's huge inside, much much bigger than it appears from the entrance.  Sometimes this can be really off putting as places like that are filled with silly games, gimmicks, and annoying.  Blitz does it right.  Even if it's pretty busy, you don't feel overwhelmed with noise.\\n\\nThe service here is excellent.  When servers aren't extremely busy, they go out of their way to really make you feel welcome and taken care of.  That means a lot.  Especially when you come mid-week and it isn't busy.  Sometimes at sports bars you get neglected as if they won't get tipped much for the night, so you don't matter.  At Blitz you never feel that way, you feel really glad you went.  \\n\\nHappy hour is pretty awesome.  Great food menu and the value is excellent.  Good deals on pints as well.  You can drop by for a game or get together with a few friends and not spend $10-15 and feel like you got ripped off just because you went during happy hour.  The nachos are my favorite.  Amazing plate with three sauces!\\n\\nOnly thing that brings it down a notch here is some of the decor.  You have this nice old building, fireplace, huge well lit back bar, tons of tv's that are well positioned, and then it gets a bit trashed up by tons of signage.  Posters are plastered everywhere, and although they need to have some of it, it gets way overdone here, and resembles a dive bar more than a sports bar.  That being said, it doesn't take away from the overall ambiance and won't keep me away.  It's just a shame they don't have some cool murals or something instead.  Also, if you can't handle a hipster vibe, you probably need to choose somewhere you'd be more comfortable parking your yuppie mobile.   \\n\\nOverall, I'd say this is one of the better sports oriented places in the city, and luckily they have multiple locations."},{"name":"Broken Strings Brewery","address":"1012 W Church St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Great brewery and staff.

Also, they don't help with your chair.  I'm really not picky about this, because I love dives as much as fine dining, but if you have white tablecloths and bottles of wine in excess of $1000, probably should step it up a bit on the service front.  (oh, and on that note... we saw a bottle of red that we often buy for $45 or so that was marked at $180!  I get wine markup, but whoa.)\\n\\nNext: Wine selection.  The list is unbelievable... but... while the waiter did try to help us select something, it wasn't quite what we wanted.  He checked in the with sommelier, came back, checked in again, came back... etc.  He must have gone back and forth between the somm and our table 3 times until we finally found something we agreed on.  Wouldn't it have just been faster to send the sommelier over?  \\n\\nFirst course: I had the tuna carpaccio.  Delicious.  Loved it!  My husband had the meatball... good, but the ricotta cheese it was plated on was cold.  Didn't send it back because we weren't quite sure if it was supposed to be cold or hot... also... we had been so picky about the wine.

Why pay 10 bucks for toast?\\n\\nI've yet to try any of their desserts and probably won't.  The only reason I ever go here is because it's wicked close to my apartment (the Newton Corner location) and I feel better about myself for walking 3 blocks to get crappy food rather than ordering via the Internetz or phone.

This is a pretty cool spot with tons of potential, but I have to say I think they are really just getting warmed up and have some kinks to work out. Please do not translate that as THIS PLACE SUCKS because it doesn't, THIS PLACE WILL ROCK ASS soon. They have an awesome GM team with tons of experience who worked at Bukowski's in Back Bay for years - these guys are working on it.\\n\\nThe spot: It's hard to get past the Deli Haus memories and these guys had to literally pull out all the walls, ceilings and flooring to get the grease out of the air. It's all sort of NYC high end bar-esque right now as they are still working with new lighting and looking for artwork etc. The bar is aluminum and there are tons of stools for bar pounding. And I'm a sucker for jacket hooks and foot railings under the bar, they got it covered.\\n\\nThe beer: A full range of options from PBR to Stone Cat to Lagunitas but no Guinness (it's a cheap Bukowski's thing, they stock Murphys instead). The prices are a little uppity, 2.99 for a PBR is a rip off so if you want cheap just get a good value like a Dogfish 60 Minute IPA for $6.00 or a Miller for $3.50. \\n\\nThe food: Pretty damn good, a very fun menu. They have these cool little sandwiches like sliders that are sloppy joes, they call them Sloppy Josh's - a homage to the cook. The also have a kielbasa sandwich with baked beans, some decent entree options and ahemmm fish taco's. I got the soup of the day and half sandwich for $6.00. Most of the prices are reasonable, you will find bargains else where - this is Kenmore and the new Kenmore is expensive. If you want something cheap to go with your beer they have cheap big ass fresh pretzels and cheapo dogs for $1.00. \\n\\nOverall - I liked this spot. It was laid back and nice and dark. It needs to be broken in and this will take some time but I am willing to head on over there and help them polish them bar stools up real nice and shiny. Give it a few weeks and I think they will get another star."},{"name":"Walnut Cafe","address":"3073 Walnut St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Well.

The cook did a good job and presentation was fine. \\n\\nTASTE: The lobster bisque was the exception to our mostly flavorless meal.  It had good lumpy fatty flavor. I did wonder if the cream base's natural sweetness had been augmented with sugar, however.  Our entrees were the taco combo and the chicken is your best bet as the difference between it, the shrimp, and fish is nearly indistinguishable, but they weren't as stingy with the chicken.  I do believe I could have fit all the shrimp in the shrimp taco on a 50 cent piece.  Ironically, the lack of main ingredient in the shrimp taco did allow me to notice the subtle flavors of the asian slaw, which was tasty. The sides were pretty ordinary and a reasonable portion.  I had the seasoned fries while my wife had the black bean & corn \\"mix.\\". I tried it, but didn't find it appetizing since I'm not a fan of cilantro. While there was nothing wrong with the Piri Piri sauce, it wasn't that great and a mystery to both of us why it's their centerpiece.  It either covered up a more desirable flavor or took center stage to cover the awkward absence of real flavor.  As a frequent fan of spicy foods, I know the difference and the Piri Piri wasn't different enough or spicy enough to even distract me from the other shortcomings.\\n\\nCOST: Price and sanitation is where this establishment fails.  Two taco combos, two soft drinks, and a bowl of soup came to $26.81.  They're definitely suffering from an identity crisis serving food on china, drinks in styrofoam cups, napkins from a solitary condiment stand, wine in stemmed glasses, at wobbly grunge-crusted tables.\\n\\nTMI WARNING: Sensitive readers may wish to skip this final paragraph.

Diners can choose between Hibachi Grill seating or traditional tables, and there are a few seats by the sushi bar as well. \\nI'd long ago given up asking \\"What's fresh\\" at seafood restaurants, only to be reproached with: \\"Everything's fresh, ma'am,\\" but Nakato highlights the freshest items on their sushi and sashimi menu, something I have never seen at any Japanese restaurant in America. I excitedly ordered several of the highlighted selections, including succulent Maguro tuna, the blander hamachi (Yellowtail), and some fish I'd never heard of, including shima aji (jack fish) and saury (a type of mackerel). I don't consider myself a fan of mackerel or other oily fish, but the saury was incredibly tender and aromatic, not redolent in the least. I also tried a house special oyster maki that was kind of interesting, which is to say not for the timid, and California rolls so fine and good they should have been reviewed by Ernest Hemingway instead of me. Ernest surely would have liked our waitress, a beautiful young kimono-clad woman who made pleasant conversation and checked on us frequently. Paul ordered a lunchbox-style meal with Beef Teriyaki and ate everything except the Edamame beans, which left more for me. There is a full bar with an extensive menu of sake, wine, beer, and cocktails. Desserts are surprisingly Western, but this is Atlanta after all. We polished off a \\"Tartufata Cake\\" which seemed more like a classic Napoleon and enjoyed a quiet but convivial atmosphere in the traditional dining room by a window overlooking a Japanese garden."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Weekend day, around 5:30, only had to wait about 15-20 minutes before my BF and I were seated. \\nInside, it does feel a little cramped, but definitely still spacious enough to enjoy your meal (ie. enough arm room). \\n \\n-The calamari was the BEST I ever had.

My years of research honed my appreciation for Carolina style pulled pork, which was definitely my dish of choice.  East vs. West?  Whole hog vs. Shoulder?  I'm not that picky.  But I do love how all Carolina style let's you really taste the flavor of the meat that has been seasoned with a vinegar sauce for smoking, and then provides a vinegar based sauce to accompany the meat.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.\\n\\nAt Estelle's there is no tasting the meat in their Carolina style pulled pork.  The meat is drenched in a very overpowering vinegar sauce.  No appreciation of the skills of the pitmaster, only for the person who made the sauce.  It was like mixing great Mexican carnitas in a vat of Tabasco.  The sauce is meant to enhance the flavor, not cover it up.  For the price of the plate, I was thinking they would have nailed it, but it's a shame Estelle's doesn't let you get any of the flavor of the meat.  Maybe there is a reason they want to mask the flavor of the meat...\\n\\nEverything else we got was really good.  The flank steak appetizer, the cornbread, the watermelon salad.

Enjoy the nice weather, chat casually with your friends, appreciate the sights and sounds, and what not. It is not that the line is not long- its just you have to be prepared and think of it as a feature, not a bug. \\n\\nWhat about the food? For starters, the free bread was excellent- really, there is nothing I appreciate more than delicious free bread. I had the butternut squash ravioli, and my friend had a chicken marsala. I only had a bite of the marsala (which heretofore had been consistently confused with chicken masala), but the flavors were good, and I had no real comparison to other chicken marsala (uni dining hall being the other source). The ravioli had a nice rich sauce and I mean there's not much that can go wrong with ravioli. In the end, both were great, and reasonably priced I felt- it wasn't cheap but it wasn't too expensive either. The portioning was also quite good; there wasn't an abundance of leftover starches, but there wasn't too little to leave me hungry either."},{"name":"Alborz Persian Cuisine","address":"3300 W Anderson Ln, Ste 300","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I gave Alborz another shot yesterday at lunch.

And I've had a lot of good food. But no meal has struck me as so creative, so flavorful, and just so darn delicious in a very very long time. Worth every cent. Thank you to the Chef, Tony Maws. That James Beard award was well deserved!\\n\\nWe weren't too hungry so decided to order a la carte, and got 2 appetizers and the roasted chicken designed to share between 2. The starters were so creative - lasagna style pasta with mushrooms and the ragout of early summer vegetables. The pasta was very unique, made with coffee instead of water for additional flavor in a delicious meat sauce that we mopped up with bread. The ragout was basically a medley of fresh veggies mixed with fresh flower petals, razor clams, ham, topped with a half cooked farm fresh egg in a foam sauce. Very refreshing and different from what you would see anywhere else.\\n\\nThe main entree took ~35 minutes to prepare in the oven, but when they brought it out it all made sense. I'm not a huge fan of meat, but this whole roasted chicken for two was PERFECTLY cooked. Even the chicken breast meat became tender, melt-in-your mouth morsels. The creamy gravy sauce had mushrooms and apricot mixed in, making a very interesting but delicious complement to the meat. This chicken could have fed a family of four. I also love that they bring the whole roasted chicken out for your inspection, and then bring it back to carve it all up for you so you can just enjoy the meat. They also plate it with the mushrooms and the gravy so you get the fullness of flavor in every bite. Highly recommend this dish!\\n\\nOverall fantastic dining experience. I haven't experienced such innovative twists on food in a while, and I am so glad we ate here.

The employee working the window tried to take my phone inside, telling me that the POS at the window was not in use. I told her I was not going to answer my phone, citing privacy concerns.

I also don't feel that it's an acceptable expectation for a customer to hand their $500 device to employee to carry through the store.

She brought the salads over as soon as they were ordered while other couple waited for their entrees. When the entrees were ready she threw the plates on the table and said \\" want cheese\\" and proceeded throw a spoon full on top. Food was ok. Butternut squash ravioli with prosciutto and asparagus ha no prosciutto and the ends were chewy. As we were half way through our 2nd round she placed the check on the table ( never asking if we needed anything else) and starred at us across the room until we placed the money down. As soon as the money was placed she rushed over and asked if it was all set before we could put on our jackets we were pushed out the door.

Nonetheless it was still good. I loved the arugula on it. My suggestion would be for them to ease up on the sea salt they put on the pizza. \\n\\nI'm one of those people who have to order dessert at the end of the meal.

I love Thai food and find Atlanta lacking but this small unassuming restaurant is always a treat.\\n\\nThe menu is split between Thai and Chinese so people that don't enjoy the strict Thai flavors have options. I personally bounce between the Basil Chicken and the Pad Kee Mao, both of which are spicy, while my girlfriend sticks with the curries--she's vegetarian btw. If you like spicy but want to be able to control the burn it's easy to skip over the peppers since they always do large chunks and don't over stir so the seeds remain in their husks.\\n\\nThe specials are usually very good. A friend had basil steak this weekend and was very happy. They are also vegetarian friendly and offer tofu as an option for any dish if you ask and have a few tasty vegetarian appetizers. Servings are generous and I usually find myself having just a bit too much at each meal and if I order an appetizer there will be a to go box. My girlfriend however always has a meals worth in leftovers whenever we go.\\n\\nThe service is good but a little odd. You are never sure if you should pay at the counter or the waiter--it does vary visit to visit. Also the place is a small hole-in-the-wall so don't expect much beyond good food. It is very popular so there is often a few minutes wait so keep it in mind for excellent takeout if you just want a meal you call ahead for and run home with. Parking is a bit scarce in front but after 6pm you can use the lot next door.\\n\\nIn short when I have a Thai craving Little Bangkok always hits the spot."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"One of my few but completely well deserved 5 star reviews.

The pork was glazed in this delectable honey glazed sauce which I just had to also use to dip my bread. The potato salad was a nice surprise, because who ever expects potato salad to be extraordinary? It was - not mayonaisey at all. For dessert, I got to sample all the tasties - pecan pie, and two cobblers - blackberry and peach.

My friend's dish was more substantial, but I wouldn't have wanted to eat his dry fish anyway. It was also filled with bones, which our waitress neglected to mention. We had the Bouye juice and an order of vegetarian nems to start, but were impressed only by the juice, which was like a sweet, creamy nectar.\\n\\nDessert, a delicious and sizable crepe filled with some exotic fruit (and a couple raspberries for good measure), made me buzz in a way our other dishes did not, though I may have just been experiencing a high after my run-in with a pseudo-celebrity.

They should have a \\"sommelier\\" of sorts for the meat and cheese if they want this concept to succeed, and they need to double the size of their menu.\\n\\nThat said, the service was outstanding, the atmosphere was decent, and the food was tasty.  I highly recommend the balsamic onion jam, the bread was perfectly toasted, and HOLY CRAP the chicken liver mousse was awesome.\\n\\nI wish their sandwiches were on their dinner menu, as after the meat and cheese course my friend and I wanted to split something else.

Nothing to blow anyone's socks off, but a classic American starter (thought it was a bit small).

You choose one side order, garlic mashed or creamed spinach, and I opted for the mashed (if you do go to Ruth's for a date during RW I would recommend each getting a different side and splitting, as the portions for the side are pretty large). I ordered my steak rare, while my co-workers ordered medium rare and medium respectively. \\n\\nThe filet (7oz?) comes out on (apparently) a 500 degree plate sizzling in clarified butter. Borderline, gross, but ok. Fortunately, my steak was cooked perfectly, but one of my co-workers steaks was over cooked and the other was unevenly cooked which was quite disappointing. The corn fed beef was high quality, but my steak was over seasoned,  too much pepper.

Sometimes people just don't make sense, I had to say, considering how empty Yasu had been when we handed in our sizable order including its lone special request.

But, as a southerner who doesn't have access to many great italian joints, this place was tops. \\n\\nSince i was travelling alone, I thought it might be easier to get a table, but basically when I got there a line had already formed out the door.  So, I joined the back and eventually a server came out and checked in w/ everyone waiting. I think if a spot for one was open then, she'd have let me in, but as it was I just waited my turn.  It was about 20 min. \\n\\nOnce you get inside, the servers are very nice and cheerful- if a bit brusque simply because they are working hard. However, I had at least 3 of them come by and chat w/ me- probably because I was on my own, but it was nice.  The tables are definitely wedged together, but it adds to the 'fun'. \\n\\nI was so tempted by the butternut ravioli, but there was a fusilli special w/ lobster and shrimp that I had to try instead.  I ordered w/ the Giacomo sauce, which is a fra diavolo with a touch of cream.  It was absolutely delicious- and as much as I adored the seafood (which came in huge chunks), I actually picked out the pasta the most.  perfectly al dente and covered in sauce (but not drowned), it was divine.

The service is consistently horrible; our last visit we had 4 different servers and the last one forgot we were her table.  When a quesadilla took over 1 hour to come out (that was after we asked about it), her response was \\"well, we're busy and when we're busy the kitchen gets backed up.\\"  We go during busy times and it is always backed up; you'd think they would make adjustments to make it better.  It took forever for our drinks to come to us and we only ordered beer; again the excuse was \\"the bar is busy; and other customers are ordering where I pick up drinks, so someone must have taken it.\\"  You would think that after going there for over 1 year most Saturdays during football season and getting the same type of experience we would have learned our lesson earlier.  The fact that this type of service has been going on for several years shows the lack of customer service and wanting to make it a better dining experience for patrons.  I guess the management and owners have the mindset of people are going to come anyway, so why worry.

Point location is closest to my office, so that is where my review will focus.  With so many options around, you know the lines mean that what is inside, is worth the wait.  \\n\\nWhile the salad bowl are always prepared fresh in front of you as you wait, the sandwiches are as well.  The grilled roasted chicken sandwich is filled with fresh greens, peppers and onions and the grilled cauliflower melt is a unique choice that is surprising good.  Even a standard item like a PB&J is extra special with raspberry jam instead of traditional grape jelly,.  BTW - our gluten free coworkers enjoy their gluten free options for bread as well.  \\n\\nWhile there (or maybe for you mid afternoon sugar rush) pick up some of the sweet treats that flour offers.  They tempt you as you wait to order and then wait for your lunch, so be prepared to give in to your sweet tooth desires.  Cookies of all varieties as well as decadent tarts are as good as they look.  We enjoyed the Belgian chocolate brownie and homemake Oreos that look more like Whoopi Pies.  And if you like cupcakes, you have plenty to choose from.

The kimchi flavor and pork belly was tasty, but it was a little too soft and not crispy enough. The dan dan noodles were way too salty.

Our cocktails were so-so - I always feel that the menu should explain whether they are served up or on ice, but perhaps that's my bad for not asking. \\n\\nThe food was bland. First course of tomatoes and burrata was fresh albeit uninspired - the tomatoes held their own, but the burrata lacked any punch or flavour. The second course disappointed: Four mangey shrimps arranged next to heaping bed of cilantro and mint, with a sort of mayo sauce, and grilled octopus stuffed with veal bland both in presentation and spice.\\n\\nThe main course was the low note. The market steak. It was well cooked, but the quality of the meat was poor. Not juicy, not flavorful. Encrusted with too big and too many hunks of salt.

Italian eateries certainly range from small and simple to large and eloquent; I find that somewhere in the middle is where you end up getting the most consistent and delicious food.  I've had great dishes in the North End since i've been here, and I've had some mediocre ones.  Frankly I go there now not on the sole hope of possibly getting a mouth-watering dish, but for the atmosphere and top-shelf booze.  Frankly my best experiences with italian dishes have been in my own house or at home in general by family-run restaurants in a normal sized town.  What i have yet to find up here, however, is a place that consistently serves good italian food not in a fancy setting (since i haven't gotten that anyways, i could just say good italian food)\\n\\nWell I found Alfredo's; and i am very thankful i did!  I was told of this place twice, once for the consistent pizza (have yet to try), and another for the pasta.  Well one night I was not in the mood to cook my own pasta and was out of sauce anyways, so i took a chance and ordered  chicken linguini alfredo with garlic bread for delivery.  The food came relatively fast, and the bill was downright cheap!  Great prices, good delivery...now all i needed was the food to taste good.  \\n\\nGo figure; it was indeed satisfactory.  The dish wasn't the best i've ever had, but to be fair I have a love afar with the alfredo dish back in my home town.  On its own merits, it was pretty darn good!  Pasta was cooked perfectly, the chicken was delicious, and the sauce itself was just flavorful enough to be noticed and enjoyed.  The Bread, om the bread....it must be a consistent thing here in Boston's italian community because it is godlike.  I may just order the bread used for making garlic bread without any of the fixings, and still pay for it!  \\n\\nSo i digress; i will be eating here again many times and hope the next dish is just as good or better than the last!  4.5 stars guys, you've earned it!"},{"name":"Ocean Wave By Harry And Sons","address":"820 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Reliable, inexpensive sushi AND thai with a great ambience.

Tons of tvs, they play anything you ask for and there's a sweet fire pit"},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I will start this review by pointing I've been a resident in Spain (many years ago) for about 2 years and I tried almost everything in spanish cuisine. Barcelona can be described as a good approach of what a tapas bar is (or should be). I will say they have some flaws in the execution though (hence the 3 stars). Preliminary note: This restaurant is in a very hot spot in Atlanta (at least nowadays), so, it is crowded most of the time. Keeping that in mind and since I'm alone for dinner (business traveler) and I always sit at the bars, I have to say, the restaurant seems to be having some staff issues. Then taking a closer look at the bartenders, I realized the problem is not the personnel but the bar set up. Sounds the restaurant has some lack of space for bottle storage in the bar and the bartenders had to go back and forth from the racks at the back of the bar to get the ingredients for their drinks. There were 3 bartenders at the bar, plus 1 bar back guy and they collided all the time with the amount of traveling they have to do. Please do not blame it on the bartenders, the culprit is not theirs in this case. As a matter of fact, they were all very attentive. With that said, I will put the services outside of the equation and focus on my meal experience.\\n\\nEven before I could order my drink, a bartender gave me a plate of Patatas Bravas to try. It just came out of the blue (I did not even order it, but seems someone rejected the plate and it ended before me). I really appreciate this bartender handled that plate which was really good, even when I am not very fond of very spiced food. I orderer a glass of Tempranillo and a plate of cold cuts and cheese. The Jamon Serrano (prosciutto cured in paprika instead of salt) was average, so was the sobresada (soft pork sausage), but the manchego and the quince preserve were pretty good. I will have to say, the Jamon Serrano tasted more like Prosciutto than Jamon Serrano, but I enjoyed it anyway.\\n\\nAfter that, I ordered, gambas al ajillo (garlic shrimp) with a glass of Muscat. The wine was very good, I cannot say the same thing about the gambas. First , the gambas in Spain are the really tiny small shrimp, not the shrimp we find here in the fish markets which are kind of couple of inches long. Gambas are around 3/4 of an inch. I know it is very difficult (amost impossible) to find those in the US market but at least, the execution can be perfected. First. the shrimp is not clean (ok, ok, I can de-tail the shrimp myself, but the purpose of the gambas is that they come already cleaned, at least in Spain they serve them that way), and then, they lack of seasoning. Gambas al ajillo are supposed to be garlicky (I think I mentioned this in another of my reviews here in Yelp!). Anyway, I will stay away from Gambas on my next visit. After that I ordered Albondigas. Those were cool. Kind of under seasoned but they tasted pretty much like a very good meat ball complement in spaghetti. I really liked them. I was in a rush to go back to work so I could not experience anymore about this restaurant. I paid the bill, greet all the bartenders and leave. \\n\\nOne thing I have to point is the ambience.. it is very loud and vibrant, kind of hectic, though. Looking at some people around me it sounds more like a place 'to be seen' than a place those particulars enjoy going to. Anyway, if you can bypass that and the fact the place trends to be loud, I will say Barcelona is a good option when it comes to Tapas (I will really reserve my opinion on some other tapas places around Atlanta in this review, you'll have to check my other ones).\\n\\nSalud y pesetas, tios!!!"},{"name":"Scratch","address":"149 A Ave","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4.5","text":"I found this restaurant on Yelp and took a chance on it.

We ordered two specialty pizzas and ate at the restaurant. The crust was burnt and crunchy throughout. The sauce on the margherita pizza was obviously directly out of a can. Perhaps Hunt's brand - that's my best guess. They threw entirely too much garlic barely minced, barely cooked into the sauce. The cheese was not fresh and they cooked the basil right in with the pizza - so it came out a wilted brownish color. We also ordered the shrimp specialty pizza. It had been overcooked so long that the cheese had those little craters that cheese gets after it's been bubbled and re-bubbled so many times. And for $16.95 a pie? Terrible.\\n\\nI don't understand WHAT the other reviewers are saying. Maybe we came on an off night. Maybe the chef was off and his cousins were filling in for him.

I'm always apprehensive to try new places to eat, but when I called ahead to make sure they knew someone with a gluten intolerance was coming in with a large dinner party, the host said they had accommodated this type of restriction in the past and he would let the chef know.\\n\\nThe atmosphere here is chill but modern, and we were seated upstairs in a long table underneath a glass ceiling after a very brief wait.  I flagged down the waiter to tell him that I had called beforehand, and he seemed a bit confused by what I was saying.  Maybe it was just his character or perhaps he was new, but when someone says \\"Yeah...yeah...that [salad, entree, etc] should be ok, I mean, yeah the chef knows\\" in an almost patronizing tone, I feel a bit uneasy about the food that's placed in front of me.  However, we literally went through almost the entire menu to discuss what kind of sauces and side dishes and appetizers would be appropriate for a gluten free diet, and after 10 minutes of Q&A and celiac education, I felt a bit better.  \\n\\nDespite the sort of spacey waiter, the restaurant pulled through. My dinner party ordered a bunch of appetizers, and they changed the recipe for the Buffalo Chicken Fingers so that I could eat them (ie, no flour in the batter, and grilling them separately instead of frying).  For an entree, I chose the Pan-Seared Salmon, minus the lemon butter sauce. I was reassured my dishes were safe to eat, and they were both tasty.  \\n\\nEveryone else seemed to enjoy their meals, which were a range of entrees and sandwiches.  There were a few minor issues -  they ran out of lamb for the Risotto of the Day dish. The waiter was slow in serving the drinks, but I give him credit for handling a large party, especially with my constant questioning.  They also turned up the music quite loud towards the end of the meal, I guess it turns into more of a bar crowd after 10-11, but it was kind of distracting. \\n\\nI would try Daedalus again, but maybe with a smaller group.  Calling ahead definitely helped, and it was great that the chef was able to de-glutenize whatever I wanted to eat.

I haven't traveled the world, but I have traveled and lived all over the United States - and nothing compares to this pizza.\\n\\nYou know, the flavor doesn't jump up and slap you in the face and you're not so impressed at first by the presentation... But the reason everyone raves about this place is because of the perfect simplicity. \\n\\nThis pizza is the way pizza is SUPPOSED to taste.\\n\\nI took my son, for his birthday today, we went in at 5pm - and there was plenty of parking and absolutely no line. I was terrified that it would be too packed and a hassle to order and find seating from previous reviews - but nope.\\n\\nWe walked in, looked around, and I said \\"only ones here, what the hell?\\"\\nWe go to the counter and since we have no idea how this process works exactly, I just tell the cashier we want something without meat. She recommends the Marghertia pie and I say sure. Grab a coke and we sit down at this huge community table alone. I had no idea there was a backroom until I heard someone calling our number.\\n\\nWe had been sitting down for less that 2 minutes - and our pizza was ready?\\nAlright, so we walk to the back, sit down at an empty table (I'm so relieved I don't have to fight for seating) and our pizza is put down, right in from of us.\\n\\nNo plates, just napkins. \\nHell yes.\\nI look at it.... Looks a little floppy.\\nWhat the hell is that?\\nBest in Atlanta? Yea, we will see.. \\n\\nONE BITE. SOLD.\\n\\nI guess I had built up these expectations that I would spontaneously have a foodgasm after biting into a pie from Antico - and it wasn't fireworks or lightening - it was just right. Like after you eat here, you're thinking \\"THAT'S WHAT PIZZA IS SUPPOSED TO TASTE LIKE!!!!\\"\\n\\nThe ovens are imported, the ingredients are imported, maybe the kitchen staff is imported? I have no idea - but they were wonderful too. Came and joked with my son and I. Extremely polite, friendly and helpful.\\n\\nIt's roughly $20 a pie - but the ingredients are flown in from Italy!! Totally legit! Why not have fresh produce and herbs? Hand tossed dough? \\n\\n\\nThe communal tables? I see and have heard complaints about that.... But, really, who cares? Don't you go out to eat to be social? If you didn't want to socialize you should order take out or delivery and leave more room for people who enjoy society. lol - it's an entire experience. Sitting next to people, enjoying great food, maybe sparking a conversation or a new friendship? Cheering for a game or having a debate?

Well, not twice anyway.\\nThe ambience/cool factor of Barcelona totally lives up to its reputation, but I much prefer less hype and more value.  The food was certainly acceptable and even good at times, but not worth the money or the hassle frankly.  Most dishes are pretty small, even for tapas.  One notable exception is the mussels.  They were absolutely delicious and bountiful.  If I recall, they were around $10.  Based on other dishes, I figured we would score about 5-7 mussels for that price.  Instead, we got around a dozen or so.  They are served in a surprising red sauce with just enough kick to have you reaching for the accompanying grilled bread to chase away the heat.  Speaking of bread....The bread served to the whole table was by far the most stellar thing about barcelona.  It comes to the table fresh from the oven, piping hot.  It is heavenly.  The server did not bring butter which initially puzzled us.  He returned a few minutes later with a saucer, an Olive Oil bottle and the biggest pepper mill I've ever laid eyes on and commenced to creating a little Italian butter tableside.  It was nice and all, but the bread was really just too good on its own to foul it with the oil.\\nwinners at our table - beef empanadas, mussels, \\nlosers - bibb salad w/ almonds, hangar steak (tasty, but tiny) \\n\\nI doubt we will return, but if we do, it will definitely be for the patio.

The open kitchen with the hearth ovens is a fun thing to watch so my cousins stood there in awe as the adults had some wine - perfect situation.  \\n\\nThe pizza itself is delicious.  My only complaint is that the pizzas as a whole are not consistently cooked - meaning some pieces or bits of the pie are less cooked than others, and you'll have sections of crust that are a little too charred for my taste.

The sausage was spicy, but somewhat mild--which is fine with me.  I had a couple oatmeal stouts to wash it down.  The oatmeal stout was very thick and rich in flavor, dark brown in color...and had a nice head.  I highly recommend this place for bier advocates!

I did try a Uala chip, instantly regretted not choosing it as a \\"base\\". Not really impressed by the quality of fish, it's not bad but I think Poke House has better quality fish. Everything else is the same with most poke places, it was nice to see mango being offered with no additional charge.\\n\\nIt's a one size bowl, I was stuffed after my meal. The bowl was okay, maybe I should have chosen another sauce to enhance the flavors. I think they offer poke on toasted bread? Would like to try that sometime. \\n\\nTLDR: Not bad.

While all of those are yummy, it can get a bit redundant at times. But at Bamboo Sushi I got the 310 roll, one of the many choices a vegan girl can get at this restaurant. This roll came with fried tofu, roasted peppers, cucumbers, asparagus, yamagobo, avocado and an amazing shiitake glaze. \\n\\nI ate the roll so fast that I immediately wanted another one, but was way too full and satisfied, especially with the few Orient Express drinks I had (also amazing, wish I had one in my hand right now\\". \\n\\nThen a few months later I came back to celebrate my friends birthday, and the first place I suggested we go was here.

I stuck to the classic salmon and tuna rolls, with the go-to chicken teppanyaki rice plate and a udon noodle bowl. I tasted only MSG in the soup, and the greasiness in my coveted chicken teppanyaki gave me a stomach-ache. Gross.

Very shortly after sitting down we were greeted by a cheerful waiter named Rob. Patiently and knowledgeably he answered our questions about both the menu and the drinks list. We decided to do the prix fixe menu which is $67 a person and allows you to have an appetizer, entree and dessert. They brought bread to the table and our appetizers of fried clams and another of linguine came out shortly after. They both were of a very normal size for an appetizer and were delicious. My husband ordered one of the special cocktails and I ordered a locally made farmhouse ale that was fairly new to the menu, both drinks were excellent.\\n\\nFor our main course I had the Vermont Pork cooked 3 ways which also had red cabbage, barley and mushrooms with it. Again the portion was perfect and all the flavors were a true delight. My husband got the Craigie burger and loved it. For dessert my husband had the 3 flavors of sorbet which were delicate, fresh and full of fresh fruit taste. I had the beignet which is a type of deep fried doughnut which was unbelievably amazing! Warm, crispy on the outside, moist and light on the inside with a light dusting of cinnamon and sugar. \\n\\nHonestly I cannot come up with even one thing to complain about from our evening at Craigie on Main. I am very picky about service and I thought the waiter, his helper and the manager who I spoke with briefly when he checked to see if our table was enjoying ourselves all were attentive and courteous. \\n\\nRegarding people's complaints regarding portion size I just don't know what to say. I have a healthy appetite, I'm not one of those people who just picks at a salad and I was unable to finish all of my main corse or my dessert. If a diner is looking for the typical american main stream experience that you will get at a place like The Olive Garden or Applebees then yes in comparison you are going to say the portions are small. The plates do not come mounded high with more food than a human should reasonably consume in one meal. But was I left hungry or even wishing that maybe there had been just a little bit more, no absolutely not. In retrospect I wish I had not touched the bread they brought to our table because then I would have been able to finish the rest of my meal which was definitely the best part.\\n\\nIn respect to price, no it's not a cheap meal. I would expect that most people going know that they are going to be spending more on a meal than they might in other places. If you are in need of having a less expensive night out while still enjoying the excellent food offered at Craigie you could have only a main course and dessert or a main course and appetizer only. You could also have no alcohol or just one drink as opposed to many. These options would allow you to enjoy a great meal for less than it would cost if you did the tasting menu. As I mentioned we each had the prix fixe menu option, we had 3 alcoholic drinks and I had a coffee with dessert, before tip our bill was $165. This is within range of other restaurants we have enjoyed dining at in the area.\\n\\nI very much want to offer other diners an honest review by which to judge this restaurant as I know how helpful it can be when deciding. I walked in the door of Craigie on Main with great trepidation the other night and came out with a full belly, a smile on my face and the memory of a truly excellent dining experience. My husband I would not hesitate to go back or recommend it to friends."},{"name":"Langbaan","address":"6 SE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I had a great experience at Langbaan the way they set everything is kind of a feel of a speak easy but restaurant style.

The first time I went, I did not feel like the food, though good, justified the prices, which are steep.  I thought the ingredients were common, and the prepartions nothing special.  Upon returning, I found the ingredients still fairly unadventourous, but they had been transformed into much more exciting, and certainly delicious dishes.  \\n\\nThe best example of this is the chicken, which was stuffed with sausage and accompanied with a combination of fresh and cooked apricots, served in a generous portion.  Sure, the chicken is high quality, but the kitchen deserves the credit for making this humble protien extraordinary.  Similarly, the octopus app, though very traditional with green olives and chorizo, was excellently cooked, which is not something to be taken granted for at all.  \\n\\nFor completeness, here are my impressions of other dishes:\\nSunchoke volute - outstanding, though the caveteli did much, much more for me than the cockscomb\\nPork 3 ways - very nice, but nothing too exciting here\\nFried smelt - good, but a big budget production that delivered more in sytle than taste\\nAsparagus - very good, and the egg was delicious, but this dish was a little too plain...some multigrain breadcrums alone may made it pop more\\nPig tails - excellent, even if a little pricy for what it was\\nMonkfish - yawn\\nChocolate marquis - truly memroable; loved the beet ice cream\\nBengiets - too good \\n\\nSome nice other touchs worth noting: nobody does a better amuse bouche, the bread basket is quite generous--though I would gladly trade quantity and variety for the bread to be warmed up, and I was very surprised the butter wasn't salted--and I LOVED the horchatta!\\n\\nOverall, I find the service pleasurable, though I have experienced some mis-steps: one server that was just too familiar and casual, another that didn't alert us to specials and make multiple errors on our check.  On both visits, timing left something to be desired.  And the atmosphere is nice, but I have found it drafty on both visits.\\n\\nMy second meal was the best dinner I've had in serveral visits to Boston, and I found the value much better than on my first visit, so I would highly recommend it for sure to experienced diners; however, I wouldn't recommend it for a special occasion or for people that only can afford to go out occassional for expensive meals...too big a risk based on the inconsistency I experienced.  I would certainly return.\\n\\n(5 stars for Boston, probably only 4 in NYC...no offense anybody)"},{"name":"Sea Thai","address":"3812 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I know there have been a lot of reviews of this place.

It limits you to two entrees, but it is pretty tasty, and I guarantee you that you will still be full upon leaving the restaurant.

Could be steelhead trout.  Anyway, it's all good!\\n(3) Vegetable - varies, but is usually some sort of stir-fried bok choy.\\n(4) Eggs and tomatoes - they always have this.  Comfort food.\\n(5) Steamed fish with black bean - they have this dish about 1-2 times per week and I highly recommend it with white rice, a veggie, and fried shrimp.\\n(6) Salt & pepper fried shrimp - it could use some more salt and pepper, but it's really good anyway.\\n(7) Chicken and mushrooms - good standby.  Always delicious.  Sometimes they just do chicken or pork with broccoli.\\n(8) Soup - the soup is good, but I often try to take it easy on my body and environment by forgoing it (comes in styrofoam).\\n(9) Bring Cash! -- and tip the ladies.\\n(10) Do not double park in front of the restaurant.

It is divine and naturally sweetened by the overnight simmering of the ginger itself. And everything else!  It is all just so delicious... \\n\\nI have tried the Tom Yum (vegetarian style) and we had to ask if the broth was indeed vegetarian because it was sensuously rich and complex.  Then another day I had the Thai Coconut Milk soup and it was just as good.

One of the dishes we ordered was the fettuccine with prosciutto. The meat in the dish was definitely not prosciutto. The whole dish tasted like maple syrup, leading us to believe the meat was probably honey baked ham or something similar.

They took our coats and led us to an open spot on the ramp down to the bar.  They gave us a drink menu and poured us glasses of water.  And that summed up the entire evening.\\n\\nNow, I know this seems like a little thing, but it was a fascinating piece of service psychology.  Instead of \\"go to the bar and wait\\" it was \\"you're our guest from minute one, and we're going to look after you.\\"  Honestly, we didn't even really need glasses of water, they were just establishing that space for us and nobody else.  Even if we didn't have a table yet, it was: \\"Right now, this is where you belong.\\"\\n\\nOur choices in drinks were complimented.  Later, our choices in food were complimented.  Our waitress seemed the entire time to be assessing our level of food knowledge, without judging it.  When things arrived they were explained, but only lightly.  With our appetizer plate of pates she listed what everything was but didn't say \\"this is x, which is y made with z.\\"  Again, they have a lot of confidence.  \\"We know you wouldn't be here with us if you didn't know what we were talking about.\\"  But never cocky.  Never \\"you're lucky to be eating here.\\"\\n\\nI should mention the food.  The pates were excellent, great mustard, great selection of sauces, lots of toast points.  My Chicken stuffed with Chicken sausage was expertly cooked and delicious.  They offered a side dish of marrow, which I'd never tried before and jumped at.  It was a huge beef bone split length wise and grilled, and when I asked what kind of bone it was (one of those questions that sounds incredibly stupid the instant it leaves your mouth), our waitress treated it seriously enough to actually go back to the kitchen and ask.  Turned out it was a femur.\\n\\nObviously, this is a five star restaurant with very good food and impeccable service.  But when I was done with the meal and getting ready to leave, I found myself comparing this great place to others I love in the city.  If you'll indulge the \\"seduction\\" analogy I started earlier, I think I can classify it this way: Craigie on Main is a one night stand.  It's an amazing night you never forget, but it isn't a \\"form a loving partnership that lasts for years\\" kind of place.  No matter how many times I go back, this place is too well-done, too indulgent to ever think of as \\"MY place.\\"  But for that one night, it will make you, as a diner, feel special, loved and respected all at once.

My husband had a Dosa (basically an Indian pancake filled with spiced potatoes and peas, delicious with the sauces they serve) which was HUMONGOUS! I think his lunch was only $8, so it was more affordable than our regular lunch buffet. They also have an add-on for lunch customers to get dessert for $1.50 (I would've had the Galub Jamun if I weren't already stuffed). Oh - and they DELIVER! \\n\\nThe service was fantastic, and they also had a free wi-fi network.\\n\\nI now have a new favorite restaurant in Orlando, and so glad that it's in the Winter Park area & reasonably priced.

After 20 mins and watching the kitchen, our name was called (seems like you have to be paying attention to your food).  The poached eggs were ICE COLD!  My cheese was cold and on the side (because they forgot to put it on).  We almost ate it just because we didn't want to wait another 15 mins but I sent it back.  It came back warmish (cheese on the side, again, SMH).  I did see the sad eggs get pulled out of a warm water bath and again, SMH, the wet dripping eggs were slapped onto a sandwich that would become soggy.  I did get a free cookie for my troubles, it was decent.  Also, while waiting for my replacement, other patrons were asking \\"hey, where's my sandwich, it's been 20 minutes!\\"  The cinnamon roll we bought was a 6/10.  Espresso is a 7/10.  I guess pastries and coffees are safe here, but I would stay far from the sandwiches or things requiring assembly -- will take forever and likely, will get messed up.

I had the chicken sour cream enchiladas with hot green sauce, AMAZING!! My fiance had the carne adovada enchiladas. The pork just fell apart! \\nOh, and to find a place here that serves sopapillas...well Adobe Rose does and they are the soft pillows of deliciousness they are meant to be, whether you fill with honey or use them to sop up the extra yummy chili on your plate.

Their coffee was especially good as well, the lattes were smooth and flavorful but not too sweet, bitter, or overwhelming. I wish I could have tried everything! Their sandwiches look really tasty and the flavors they have and pair together seem unique compared to most cafes and sand which shops.

We were seated by our 8:00 reservation time after grabbing drinks at the bar, but then waited a good 10-15 minutes for our server to arrive. He took our order and we had our food with little wait time. My husband ordered the Pizza Carciofi and I had the famed Gnocchi. With much regret, I hate to report that my gnocchi was sub-par. The flavor was so mild, bland, and boring. And the pizza, too, was bland and overly soggy in the middle, as another Yelper stated in their review.\\n\\nGenerally, I don't complain. We usually have fantastic food and don't need to complain, and when it comes to my Little Italy experiences, I've never been let down. I explained all of this to our server, and his response was, \\"Was there anything wrong with it?\\" Well damn! I said no, that it was just ok, missing flavor and greatness.  He told me that perhaps it needed more salt or Parmesan. Well, no, it needed more than that, but was I supposed to argue with our waiter? Not my style. So, we got free tiramisu. This isn't what I was looking for, but at least it was something. I loved the atmosphere. They're a fast-paced establishment with a great vibe, but the food needs work. \\n\\nBased on so many other positive Yelper experiences, I would hate to steer people away from this place, but tonight, it is what it is. I wish they would have sent someone else over to talk to us before bringing out free dessert. I think offering to comp my entree would've been more appropriate, but in the end, they make more money with this solution.\\n\\nI'll leave it up to you all. You may have a decent experience.

Why, well I am a veggie and  I hate eggs and greasy filling breakfasts that will just make me feel sick all day. So, I searched for my usual fruit and granola and was happily surprised to find more than one  thing.  Finally, a menu I could enjoy, it was like a ray of sunshine.  I ended up getting the blueberry corn pancakes.  The short stack was more than enough, the pancake was bigger than my head.  I left with a slab, a rich brownie with peanut butter frosting.  I just wanted to try a nibble, but couldn't stop.  I just had to hide the brownie from myself.  \\nSo, back to the non disgusting menu for people like me (hate eggs and I am a veggie), there is Dick's Bagel, a bagel with swiss cheese and tomato, I found potatoes with dill and veggies and waffles and pancakes and so on.  Yes, dill seemed popular on the menu, one of my favorite herbs that seems to lost popularity.  Finally, options not ruined by gross eggs and bacon or egg and meat substitutes.  I think these are available, but if I hate eggs and meat I don't want to eat substitues that taste like eggs and meat.\\n However, these options are available.  So, if you are like most people you will find super good breakfast food.  My friend had some type of egg thing with dill and a side of grits.  \\nPlus, the atmosphere is laid back and cute.  The carpet is a little gross and it is in a strip mall.  But don't be fooled and give it it a try.  I can't wait to go back and try something new.

This time around was much softer with raw yolk and more bold soy marinade flavor.\\n\\nThe pork, was so-so. 2 thick slices of char siu that looked like it was charred after sliced up. That explains why it was on the dried side instead of soft and juicy. The pulled pork was salty.. Tad too much.\\n\\nCondiments, mostly a la carte.

But there were only like 5 items to choose from so your options are very limited- plus the prices were too high for what you get! \\nI can't imagine a worse business model! The space had so much potential but they wasted it with lounge seating and lots of unused areas. With a location making them the only restaurant at the Moda Center, they could capitalize way better on the space and locale. \\nThe rules of this place made no sense! They had tons of patio seating but said that you have to have an indoor table to order food.

On the night we visited there was a large concert so the place only got more packed as we ate our food. When we finally got a table and found a waiter to take our order, he said he'd come back later to take our payment- big mistake. We had to literally grab a Moda \\"event coordinator\\" (who was mulling around oddly) and ask them to pin down the waiter so we could pay and leave! We even told him \\"hey, we could leave without paying and no one would know!\\" To which he responded that it was up to us! He wouldn't have even stopped us! Finally the manager came by and promised the waiter would be by next to close our tab (why couldn't the manager do it is beyond me since he also had a tablet).

The few of you who have read my other reviews should know that brevity isn't exactly my strong suit.\\n\\n   The pizza is the obvious draw here, and the menu is essentially nothing but pies and calzones (no side salads here). But, while waiting for my pizza to come out of their 1000 degree oven I found myself irresistibly drawn to the dessert display.\\n\\nIn true authentic Italian form, they have a wide variety of cannolis available. The unique toppings include everything from pine nuts to coconut and graham cracker. I couldn't resist the graham cracker topping, nor could I even wait until I got through my pizza to break into it. As you can barely see from my iPhone picture above, they do not pipe in the filling until you order your pastry, to keep it from getting soggy. These were fantastic...one of the best I have had in a long time. Highly recommended.\\n  \\n   Because Antico was originally intended to be a take-out only place, and that the crust has a tendency to get soggy on the drive home, it was strongly recommended to me that I make a point to put down a couple of slices at the standing room only table.\\n\\nAfter getting my Diavaola pie (spicy sopressata, pepperonata, and buffala) I proceeded to dump about 15 of the red peppers, fresh garlic, and some parmigiano cheese on top and dig in. If you can't handle a little heat, I wouldn't recommend the peppers, but I like a little pain with my meals, so I loved it.\\n\\nAs expected, the pizza was amazing. I don't know that I can say that it is the best I have EVER had, but without a doubt it was in the top 3. The crust was a little thicker than Varasano's and Fritti's, but given that it had to survive the trip home without becoming a sloppy mess, I think it was just right. The char was great and the flavor was on point. As many others have pointed out, I found the toppings to be far-and-away superior to some of the other Atlanta pizza powerhouses. Though I have never been to Italy, and therefore never had \\"authentic Italian pizza\\" myself, my girlfriend has and her first reaction was \\"this taste more like real Italian pizza than anything I have had in Atlanta before.\\"\\n\\n   After getting home, I took a que from Jimmy's post at Eat It Atlanta, and threw it in the oven for 3 minutes at 400 degrees. I have to say, he was spot on. After the drive home and waiting 20 more minutes for my dining companion to get home, the crust quickly returned to its original crunchy goodness. I would say this re-heating move is a must for anyone that lives further than 5 minutes from Antico.\\n\\n    All in all, I would highly recommend this, the hot-new-pizzeria-du-jour, to anyone that appreciates a good slice. Given that I work all of 10 minutes from here, I intend to go back as often as my wallet will allow."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"I am amazed at some of the positive reviews here.

The wait staff was friendly and helpful, and overall helped create a memorable evening.\\n\\nWe started with the Sea Vegetable salad.  The seaweed (arame and hijiki) was flavorful, but not overwhelming, because it had been marinated then mixed with radish and carrots, which gave it a nice crunch - a nice refreshing way to start the meal.\\n\\nThen, we were blown away by the rest of the food.\\n\\nI should start by saying that, except for the rare veggie burger, I'm not a big fan of attempts to turn processed bean and grain into something that intentionally resembles some kind of meat product.  I'm sometimes bemused, but, especially with seitan, more often just underwhelmed and befuddled.\\n\\nSo, it was with some small trepidation that I allowed myself to consider the Pan-Seared Sesame Encrusted Seitan Strips.  Wow, what an eye-opener. It was filling and bursting with flavor; served with a miso and horseradish dip that was the perfect complement.  I was about 2/3 of the way through them when I realized that they tasted a lot like steak tips, but way better, and without the heaviness that steak usually leaves me with.\\n\\nThen, there was the Baked Millet Loaf with a vegetable and tempeh sauce. Except for the baked millet itself, the dish actually bore no resemblance to its menu description, but thankfully, was delicious anyway.  The millet loaf was more flavorful than we expected, accompanied by one of the best sauces I've ever tasted, with minced tempeh and vegetables perfectly cooked in a rich (I think) tomato base - it reminded me of a sauce I once had with an unforgettable ossobuco in the North End.\\n\\nFinally, we had a side of the sweet potato fries.  These were also exceptionally good; we found the bbq sauce they were served with a little too strong, but they were happy to bring some organic Heinz ketchup in its place, which was perfect.\\n\\nA few small wishes --\\n\\nAlthough they did have grilled asparagus as a side dish, I would have liked to have seen more green vegetables as sides, maybe grilled broccoli or brussel sprouts.  I would have rather ordered that than the fries (good as they were) to better balance the richness of the seitan and millet dishes.\\n\\nI also think that the seitan strips and the veggie sauce for the millet loaf probably had more oil than was necessary.  Of course, oil is one of the ways to produce the mouth feel and flavor that can make veggie dishes tasty, but still, I think that a bit less oil could have been made to work as well.\\n\\nDespite these wishes, this was some of the best restaurant food I've had, and at a very reasonable price ($35 for two, w tax)  I'll be back."},{"name":"The Dogwood","address":"11420 Rock Rose, Ste 130","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"The waitress seems to be annoyed with us.

Each dish was beautifully plated, skillfully seasoned, and came out at exactly the right temperature. All of the flavors were complex, evolving on the palate. Our water glasses were never empty, something I really appreciate when it's 90+ degrees every day. Our lovely server was personable and knowledgable about the menu when my friend was on the fence about what she should get. The server even gave us $10 gift cards at the end of our meal! \\n\\nWe couldn't have asked for a better experience and personally thanked the chefs as we were leaving.

We went during happy hour but also ordered dinner and appetizers from the regular menu.  \\n\\nFirst the sushi.  I feel silly for expecting so much given the very cheap happy hour menu.  The sushi rolls were poorly rolled with tons of rice and they were very sloppy with the rolls falling apart.  Some of the fish for the nigiri didn't look so fresh so we were afraid to eat them.  Finally, frozen tuna was used :(  For those who gave 5 stars, I am not sure why!!!???\\n\\nThe appetizers were good though which is why I am giving 3 stars instead of anything lower.  Skip the miso soup and ramen.  They use the same broth for udon as for the ramen it seems.  The fried rice is actually good as was the tofu appetizer.  \\n\\nThis is a hole in the wall place where many seek it out for the cheap happy hour but the rolls and nigiri just did not look or taste appetizing.

This was not the case: neither the food nor the service would warrant 1 Michelin star. Although the staff was very attentive and friendly, the dishes arrived irregularly sometimes more than 20 min between plates. It seemed as if each dish in the tasting menu was submitted as a new order: one would think that the chefs would plan the plates for the entire menu and have them arrive with some regularity. not 40 mins for the 2nd dish and 20 mins between the third and 4th plate, etc. After about 2 hrs and half-way through the menu, we told our waitress that at this rate, that the final plate would arrive at 1am (we were seated at 8:30pm).\\n\\nRegarding the food, although each plate was carefully and skillfully prepared, creativity was lacking. I always look forward to chefs that successfully combine flavors in unexpected ways using interesting ingredients. There was an over salty tendency that diminished flavors of the otherwise interesting rabbit ragout. the grilled fish was very good as well, but the final dish of spare rib, pork croquet, and pork belly was heavy and perhaps not the right choice for the final plate. Finally, each plate in the tasting menu should stand alone, but also contribute to the progression of flavors among the series of dishes served. These plates appeared poorly integrated.\\n\\nOverall, we did not have a very good experience at Craigie on Main and we're not likely to return."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Went on a Monday night and the wait was only 10 minutes.

(As a side note, after we found parking a few blocks away from the restaurant, we walked in and gave our name for our reservation. The lady at the front looked in her book and told us that there was no reservation with our name on it. I tell her that I got a call that day from the restaurant confirming the reservation. She tells me she is sorry, but she can seat us when something comes available. Then I look onto my phone and show here the number that called me...yup, not their number. Apparently we walked into another restaurant instead of Craigie on Main. Awesome...we looked like idiots.)\\n\\nAnyway, once we walked the extra block to the restuarant that actually says \\"Cragie on Main\\" on it's windows, we were seated right away. I knew immediately that I would love this restaurant. The open kitchen is almost larger than the entire dining area. There were bar seats right at the kitchen, but we were seated around the corner at a nice two seat.\\n\\nOur waiter came over and asked us if we had any questions. We said no, that we were both going with the Chef's 10 course tasting. Then the waiter asked us if we had any likes and dislikes. He told us that Craigie on Main is a \\"head to tail\\" restaurant and pondered if we were ok with eating items like sweetbreads. Of course we are fine with it. We told him we love pig cheek and he said he'll definitely try to see if we can get some pig head's in our meal. (Each chef's tasting is catered to each table apparently. Though throughout our meal, I did notice other tables getting some similar dishes, but that's ok.)\\n\\nI will now recount what we ate, thanks to the printed menu we received at the end of the meal. I told our waiter we were food bloggers (he noticed us taking pics of everything) and he said he'd get us a menu. That was nice of him.\\n\\n#1. Three Chilled Seafood Preparations\\n\\"fresh uni, lime pickle vinaigrette\\", \\"foid de lotte au torchon, sea trout roe\\", \\"lobster salad, hackleback caviar\\"\\n\\nRight off the bat I'm freaking excited. Monkfish liver, something I've been dying to try for the last couple of years. I'm so glad we get to try something new. First the uni. It tasted like most uni I've ever had, which is to say smooth and creamy and very good. The lobster, which Abby absolutely loved, had a tiny dab of caviar on it that made the dish for me. And the monkfish liver...it was everything I had hoped it to be. Foie gras from the ocean is the best way to describe it. So good...so rich and decadent.\\n\\n#2. Salad of Big Eye Tuna Sashimi\\nLaying on top of a red onion-shiso salsa that was so good, Abby used bread to soak it all up.\\n\\n#3. Grilled Hawaiian Walu\\nOne of my most favorite plates of the night. Walu, a fish I've never heard of before, was meaty and very flavorful.\\n\\n#4. Red Chile and Sesame Marinated Salmon Kama\\nThe collar of a salmon. Again, something I've never had before. Other than the small bones that hid inside the piece we were given, this was a fantastic dish. The crispy skin and the delicate flesh were perfect together. The bones though, could not be ignored. One of the only knocks during our dinner.\\n\\n#5. Pork Belly and Cepe Tortellini\\nMy least favorite plate, mainly because I didn't like the pumpkin puree too much. The pork belly was very good and I was wishing we had a little bit more of it...\\n\\n#6. Grilled Pork Belly\\nAsk and you shall receive. The pork belly was perfectly cooked and I enjoyed the pomegranate seeds that accompanied the meat. I did not, however, care for the glazed chestnuts. No matter, the pork belly was scrumptious.\\n\\n#7. Vermont Organic Lamb 3 ways: Roasted Loin, Braised Belly, Crispy Confit\\nAbby hates lamb. If there's one protein that Abby refuses to eat, it's lamb. She liked the lamb at Craigie on Main. Nuff said. (An incredible dish, though the sausage was just ok, the braised belly and roasted loin were unbelievable.)\\n\\n#8. Jasmine/Rooibos Tea Infused Panna Cotta\\nLet's just say we didn't like either and leave it at that.\\n\\n#9. Olive oil and Taza Chocolate Mousse or Long Island Cheese Pumpkin Parfait\\nMy chocolate Mousse came with a little candle for my b-day. That was nice. The mousse itself was very rich, but was a good size portion that I wasn't hit with too much sweetness. Abby loved her pumpkin parfait. Abby also ordered a cup of tea, that came with it's own pot.\\n\\n#10. Chilled Phttp://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/central/each Mousse\\nA very nice way to end the dinner. Very light and refreshing.\\n\\nOverall, a fantastic meal. Other than the bones in the salmon, nothing to really complain about. The service was at times slow, especially when we were waiting to pay the bill and leave, but since we weren't really in a hurry it didn't matter.

Definitely messy, but that's what the tray is for.  I also had a nacho tots side, and did the free chili sampler.  The beef chili reminded me of my grandma's chili for chili dogs.  mmm.

I ask my bf if he just witnessed the same thing I did. Yes, he did. The only difference between us and that other couple? We are white and they are black. They seated us close to this other couple and the situation continued to bother us through dinner. As we were standing to leave, I asked the woman if the bartender actually made them pay for their drinks at the bar and she said yes.

The setting is beautiful along the water (and will be better once construction sites become buildings) and it's a good place to hang on a summer night. I went during the Boston Dine Out week. Our table sampled  apps (beets, meatball, and a roll up), entrees (veal and porchetta), dessert (cannolis and tiramisu - dry and bland). Overall the food was fine but for those prices I downgrade that to a solid meh. My point of comparisons are that the hubs' family is half-Italian, I've traveled through Italy, and enjoyed hidden gems in the North End, Little Italy, North Beach. Service was quite attentive and professional but food delivery super slow, which is unusual since Restaurant/Dine out week revolves around limited menus. Drinks were pricey ($15/pop).

The fries were decent but I wish they were better.  I also want some sort of sauce.  They have Belgian fries on the menu but only offer 2 dipping sauces -- where is the sauce?

Each time I have returned, it has gotten progressively worse in terms of food and service.  I thought the worst experience was when I invited a group of 8 to go here from one of my clients (visiting from Vancouver).  The server pushed the largest sized paella on us in addition to the numerous tapas and it was not only substantially more than we needed but it was so fishy that we left most of it there at a hefty price.  Fast forward 9 months and I decided to give it one more chance.  Four of us arrived at 5:30 when it was half empty and ordered cocktails, bottles of wine, dinner and dessert.  We left at 7:30 but when we were still finishing our dinner, we were asked if we wanted dessert and while we were still eating dessert they dropped off our check.  We still had our bottles of wine to finish and they took the signed receipts with tip and the server looked at it as he was walking away.  The manager even came by as we were still finishing to briskly say thanks for visiting (in other words time to go).  If this restaurant had amazing food they wouldn't even be able to warrant the cocky attitude.  I don't know why I bothered to give them another chance.

The bathroom smelled like baby powder and was very clean. The whole place was pretty clean actually, which shocked me because when I came here a few years ago, the place was, well, not so clean.\\n\\nIt took the server a few minutes after we were seated to even get our drink order, even though the place wasn't busy at all. My friend was rather hungry so this wasn't a good way to start. He's a stickler for customer service and doesn't mind not tipping someone if they don't do their job. I was also tired of hearing him complain about being hungry. I ordered their chocolate pie with my steak patty melt. At first my friend was laughing at me. I thought the server (and I'm giving her some credit with that title) would bring it out with the rest of our order. I was hoping anyway, because, like I said, my friend was hungry, and I don't like to share. She didn't. She brought it out first. Thanks, so now I can either make my friend watch me eat, or share. I have a soul, so I had to share. I had a feeling that she wouldn't be on her game too much, so I was hoping that after we got done with our meal, I wouldn't have to flag her down. I was wrong about so much...\\n\\nOur server-person was kind of creepy. She didn't really do too much, and would just stare at us from behind the counter. We'd be sitting at the table with empty glasses, and she'd just be staring. We even had to flag down another server, like a real one, to refill our tea, even though she was right there. If you're going to be looking right at us do something! If I wanted someone to just watch me eat I wouldn't have shared my pie!\\n\\nWhen my patty melt arrived it was good. It comes on rye bread and I love rye. It was nice and crispy with grilled onions and a thick piece of meat. Even though I like everything well-done I like that you can choose how you want it cooked. \\n\\nBut then there was more staring, and more empty glasses. It was bad to the point where I had to convince my friend not to complain. I didn't want another IHOP incident and it was going in that direction pretty quick. Finally she came back around and we ordered another piece of pie to split since I shared mine earlier. More staring, the check, more staring...\\n\\nThis is where I don't know how to rate it... My friend said that all the times he's been there he a.) got really good service from another server, b.) he said that you pay at the table. She brought us our check, but didn't say to pay at the register. So we waited, and waited, and more convincing my friend not to complain, and more staring...finally we walked right past her to the register. Would have really liked more instruction on that one.\\n\\nI'll be back though. Hopefully she's knew, either way I'm going to ask to not have her as my server.

I came upon Acitron, a new Mexican bistro in Arlington, that we've been interested in trying for some time now. I put the voucher in my purse, and we hopped into the car for the 3-minute drive to Arlington Center. Upon walking into the new bistro, we were immediately aware that we should have made a reservation weeks ago! The place was hoppin'! Hoping for something to open up, we approached the hostess and asked for a table. To our chagrin, there was just nothing for us due to upcoming reservations, but the three elderly women at the bar were paying their bill...albeit, slowly...and we could sit at the bar if we so chose!\\n\\nWe've never been known to turn down a seat at the bar so we patiently waited for the women to gather their belongings. It was like watching an episode of the Golden Girls, acted out in front of us. Goodness! After about 10 minutes, they were finally bundled up and ready to go, so we took our seats at the bar, where the bartender, who later introduced himself as Mo, was shaking margaritas like it was his job...haha, wait a minute. :) We placed our order for margaritas into the queue, for my husband, a Jalapeno margarita, and for me, a Blue Sky Margarita. It contained tequila (of course), blue curacao and a splash of Amaretto DiSarono. It was delicious...but stay tuned for the best drink of the night...it's coming up soon.\\n\\nWhile we enjoyed our cocktails, we glanced over the menu and immediately realized that this was going to be a tough decision! Everything looked SO good! There were plates being brought from the kitchen that made both of our mouths water! While perusing the options, we received a bowl of what I can only imagine was homemade salsa, as well as some tortilla chips which were still warm!\\n\\nWe decided on sharing the Queso Fundido Con Chorizo as our appetizer. This sizzling skillet of chorizo, poblano pepper strips and sauteed onions mixed with four different kinds of melted cheeses was to die for! It was ooey, gooey, and delicious! It came with some fresh from the oven tortillas which really complemented the dip, as well!\\n\\nBy the time we were almost finished with our appetizer, it was definitely time for round 2 of the cocktails. When we sit at the bar, we like to ask the bartender questions, and tonight was no different. My husband asked for something different, keeping with the bold flavors that he already experienced in the Jalapeno Margarita. Well, Mo really delivered on this request...and I got one of the same! Instead of tequila, he used Mezcal, something neither of us had much experience with. The smokiness of Mezcal is bold and delicious, and paired with his own version of a dark and stormy, this was probably one of the best drinks I've ever had! It was like...a summer's night, in a glass! Refreshing, savory and bold...only three of the MANY words I could use to describe this cocktail!\\n\\nWhen our entrees arrived, we were excited to dig in! I ordered Camarones En Mole De Tamarindo, a shrimp dish with a tamarind-based mole sauce. The shrimp were cooked to perfection, and drenched in the sweet and savory tamarind mole, served over a piece of cornbread. Since all of the entrees come with two sides, I opted for a vegetable medley which consisted of mushrooms, cauliflower, peppers and a delicious sauce, as well as a Poblano Pepper rice which was fluffy and spiced to perfection!\\n\\nMy husband decided to go with Conchinita Pibil, an axiote seed, spices and fresh orange marinated pork dish, served roasted and shredded, and garnished with pickled onions and scallions. For his sides, he chose the refried pinto beans, and Elote, which is grilled corn on the cob with chipotle aioli, cotija cheese and spices on top. \\n\\nWe were full, but we had to order a serving of Tres Leches for when we arrived home. This dessert was rich, delectable, and definitely fresh! The perfect ending to a delicious meal!\\n\\nThe plates were aesthetically pleasing, the food was delicious, the staff were extremely friendly, and I don't think I've had such good Mexican cuisine since the last time I was in Mexico, and that was a long time ago! Everything about this meal was awesome, and I can't believe it took us this long to give it a try! If you want authentic, fresh Mexican cuisine, definitely give Acitron a try...but don't forget to make a reservation! \\n\\nAcitron is candied nopales, which are the fleshy, oval leaves of a prickly pear cactus."},{"name":"Moberi","address":"1755 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":":( I sure hope the woman working today was just having a really really shitty day because she was a total ass hole.

It was not busy. We decided to sit at the bar. Someone brought chips and salsa to our table right away. We then sat there for 15 minutes! 15 minutes and NOBODY acknowledged us. Several people walked by us, nobody so much as brought water. We had to say something to the hostess, who got a waiters attention. It still took a while before our drinks to be made and one was just a beer on tap! Food was mediocre, at best. Do yourself a favor and by pass this place and go up the street to Lunada, the service there can be sketchy, but at least the food is great and they do not charge you for extra chips and salsa."},{"name":"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","address":"3825 Lake Austin Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Overrated!!  The food is crappy, and there is only one bathroom for like 1000 people.  Always a line-up.

This was my first time in. Initial impression, very clean and the staff was pleasant, not busy. Food prices were ok. I think some of the other reviewers may not have ordered a sandwich in town lately, or maybe they eat a more of a fast-food chain? The wait, yes, was a bit on the slow side, but my food tasted very fresh, as their name would indicate. In addition, eating at other places in the area you will experience a similar wait. In all, I liked my chicken sandwich with bacon and avocado. The bite of my husband's prime rib \\"gyro\\" style wrap was also good. I will go back."},{"name":"Keke's Breakfast Cafe","address":"282 Moore Rd","city":"Ocoee","stars":"3.5","text":"Nice, always fresh and big portions!!

My mom told me about them, and at first I thought, \\"That's a bit steep for one naan bread, but I'll grab two to-go anyway.\\"  \\n\\nThey brought them out in a paper bag the size of an H-E-B shopping bag.

Pricey food and beers await those with expense accounts and money to burn.  Food satisfies, though portions are minuscule, as are the beers.  We went for a special treat before heading to the airport.  There are better venues, though, and I don't think I would go again."},{"name":"The Albert","address":"918 Austin Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Our family eats here frequently.

As we entered the restaurant, we couldn't help but notice it was more on the fancy side. We got seated right away since there were only 2 more parties. We ordered drinks right away. Most of us got beers. However, I guess the waiter miscounted and he was one beer short. It took him 10 minutes to bring the next one....\\n\\nAs for the food. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai. Everyone else ordered different dishes. But the main point here is that we waited for about 40 minutes for our food. 40 MINUTES!! Not only that, but the food didn't even come together. 2 people had to wait for their food while ours got cold by waiting.\\n\\nThe Pad Thai was pretty good though. Maybe it only tasted good because I was starving. The portion was smaller than what I'm used to.\\n\\nThey need to hire more workers. Service is really slow.

Waiting to get a drink from a bartender that would rather clean and chat with other people for 20mins OK. Having 2 5$ drinks and being charged $20.00 on my card after the fact OK. Leaving repeated messages for a resolution to this problem and never getting a call back. PRICELESS. \\nIt's only 10 bucks so in the end it just means they will never see me again and they get a crappy review on Yelp.

We had initially wanted to go to Zaya but some how it is closed now. So we decided to give another local Inman Park place a try. Wrong idea to have. \\n\\nOur waitress was not very concerned with us for one. She did do a good job at keeping our water glasses full though so she got a decent tip. \\n\\nThe food... to say it was disappointing would be a understatement of a major degree. My friend had the 3 chicken tacos and I had the 3 fish tacos. I love fish tacos so getting fish tacos that were neither flaky, fresh, and lacking any seasoning what so ever was a crying shame. My companions dish wasn't any better. Neither of us could stomach eating more than 1 and a 1/2 tacos before just deciding to give it up. The tortillas i had hopes for as they were corn and not flour but they failed to make them taste of anything other than cardboard. The black beans were good but you get a thimble full of them so cant give too much credit there. Chips and salsa were standard fare and not bad. The only saving grace was the appetizer, we had the lump crab and habenero fritters and they were amazing!!! \\n\\nAll in all, we will NEVER frequent this place again. People should have been fleeing this place to go next door to Zaya to keep it open. Get Mexican from a hole in the wall place or stay home and make tacos from a ol' elpaso taco seasoning, it WILL taste better than this place.
