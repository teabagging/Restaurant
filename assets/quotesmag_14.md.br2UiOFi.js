With that consideration noted, my second thought on walking past each diner en route to our table was \\"that looks good - that too - oh, and what is that;\\" in other words, the product they are putting on the table looks outstanding even from afar and the restaurant smells nothing like an \\"oyster shack\\" but rather like the upscale bistro that it is - a bistro of bivalves if you will.\\n\\nWith the paper menu already perused during our long wait it would be a short time before our server, a pleasant young man with an astounding knowledge of the myriad types of raw oysters and other seafood combinations on the menu, would arrive at our table with glasses of ice water.  Not an enormous fan of raw oysters myself but pleasantly seated with a direct view into the kitchen I listened as the province, flavor profile, and texture of each oyster was described and within moments one of my co-diners had selected a half dozen that would arrive shucked on ice and by then the rest of our order was decided and we were left with perhaps a twenty minute wait during which beverages never reached less than 1/3 empty.\\n\\nNoting already that service was extraordinary throughout our meal, I will note that the small kitchen's pacing was unfortunately less so - an issue for myself particularly as I ordered a warm appetizer and warm main course with both delivered simultaneously leading to a conundrum as to which would suffer from the air conditioner blowing directly over our heads.  While our server noted that this \\"shouldn't have happened\\" even as he delivered the food and tried to make up for it by granting our request for a sample of the a la minute clam chowder it unfortunately did happen and the thin milky lacking both salinity and texture really did not make up for a lukewarm $25 main course.\\n\\nFor my co-diners the first ordered the Vitello Tonnato sandwich with roasted veal, tuna tartare, cucumber salad, and spicy wasabi mustard and the second a plate of seared Georges Bank Scallops with Braised Pork Shank, Sienna Farms Root Vegetables, Brussels Sprouts, and Chanterelles.  Graciously allowed to taste a couple bites of each I'll note that despite my feelings about veal/beef in general, the Vitello was actually much more like a creamy and subtle tuna tartare sandwich than veal - as a matter of fact, if anything the veal mostly served to make the standard tuna seem more textural and fatty; toro-esque if you will and while I personally feel a heftier bread would have helped, it was still quite good.  Moving on to the scallops - they were almost so good that they made me regret my order as the caramelized scallops married perfectly with the slightly sweet pork while the root vegetable and chanterelle combination did likewise with the caramelized Brussels.\\n\\nFor my selections, save for the timing issue alluded to above, the flavors at Neptune Oyster remained spot on for both appetizer and main course - the first, the house special Neptunes on Piggyback.  Described as \\"Crispy Oysters, Berkshire Pig, Golden Raisin Confiture, Pistachio Aioli\\" and served beneath greens and atop toast these lovely plump oysters arrived perfectly crisp on the exterior and briny and sweet within.  Paired with the tasty shredded pork beneath, sweet raisins, and a splash of acid from the aioli I personally could have done with more oyster and less bread considering the price, but all things being equal this was a surf n' turf combination done quite right.\\n\\nFor my main course I simply couldn't resist the hype. Described simply as \\"Maine Lobster Roll with toasted roll, hot with butter, fries\\" and checking in at $25 all I can say is that the parts I was able to eat hot were everything you'd expect from hot buttered lobster - no more and no less.  Ample in portion and with the bread nearly saturated with butter while still holding its form I only wish more places in Boston served their lobster rolls in the manner as opposed to cold with Mayonnaise.  Was it worth $25?  Probably not, especially as I was not wowed by the fries - but it was quite tasty and prepared perfectly with a great meat to bun ratio and plenty of butter.\\n\\nWith the check divided and paid our exit from Neptune would be almost precisely one hour after we entered the door and even then the wait time for those leaving their name at the door remained \\"an hour to an hour and a half\\" and all things being equal I'd say the experience and food was worth the wait at least once-but looking back in retrospect on my trip if I were a local I'd probably not return anytime soon unless I lived in the neighborhood given the quality, size, convenience, and reservations system of their new competition near Fenway - Island Creek Oyster Bar."},{"name":"Pho Pasteur","address":"682 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Second time here and this time is with my sister.

I should mention that I've waited this long because I've always heard from friends that it's an expensive place with almost no vegetarian options.  I'm not concerned about it being an expensive outing but being a strict vegetarian, I am not quick to blow $100+ on a place I am skeptical about.  But just a few weeks back, we had met a foreigner who was visiting Portland and had won a $120 gift card to this place and needed to get rid of it.  So he sold it to us for $40 since he had to leave the country the next day and had no interest in trying to rip someone off on Craigslist with it.  So we finally decided to try it, seeing how dirt cheap it would now be and hoped it would be a nice, fancy experience for me, as I spend 8 months a year in college across the country in a city with absolutely no decent restaurant (yay dangerous college towns).  \\n\\nThe moment I walked in, I was impressed by the ambiance.  The odor of the restaurant reminded me of the lavish restaurants on cruises I have been on- it was a good sign.  The dark decor with large panoramic windows was appropriate and the bar (although I'm not 21), looked nice with a piano, although was slightly loud.  Thankfully the noise level was very low in the main seating area.  \\n\\nThere were a couple of things that annoyed me.  We made a reservation and as we walked in, we requested a table by the window (since the view is supposedly amazing).  They told us they don't make specific table reservations and we would have to wait 45 minutes for a window seat.  Apparently people head to the bar if they really want a window seat but seeing as I'm underage, we decided to take a non-window table.  Maybe this is Portland City Grill's way of getting some extra cash, getting people to the bar to wait for window seating.  The view was pretty nice, nothing new however for a long time Portland resident.  \\n\\nThe vegetarian food pleasantly surprised me.  You have to ASK FOR THE VEGETARIAN MENU- don't settle with the one option on the main menu.   We ordered the squash noodle gnocchi, the gently fried tofu ramen noodles, and the linguine with white sauce, as there were only four vegetarian options.  We also ordered a sushi plate.  My mom ordered a strawberry daiquiri.  The drink was fantastic, the sushi plate was excellent (it came with this great, light teriyaki sauce), the ramen noodles were good (although a bit salty), and the gnocchi was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  I have had gnocchi on a previous cruise and it wasn't great but man, PCG got it right.  The squash noodles make such a good combination with gnocchi.  However, the linguine with the white sauce wasn't good- much too plain with no flavor and too much lime. \\n\\nOnto dessert, which was the second shortcoming.  PCG has literally the lamest \\ndessert menu I have seen for a restaurant of its caliber.  Even PF Chang's has better options (Great Wall of Chocolate is pretty good).  Here, all they had was a cheesecake (which I would much rather have at the Cheesecake Factory), a creme brulee, cookies, monkeycake, donuts, and a few other options.  Literally nothing sounded good: donuts (are you kidding me? Voodoo is right across the street).  I'd honestly pass on the desserts here and head to Papa Haydn's instead where you'll get a real dessert menu.  I had a Starbucks Frap for dessert which in my opinion looked much better than anything on PCG's menu.  \\n\\nHmm what else?  Oh yeah the service.  We lucked out, getting a very humorous waiter who was pretty much perfect.  He entertained us, was knowledgeable about the menu, and made our experience nice. Service is a problem in a lot of restaurants but PCG got it right.\\n\\nOh yeah, this is probably not a place for kids.  You have to have a developed taste for this kind of food and there was only one youngster in the entire restaurant, who I noticed just drank a strawberry daquiri the entire time.  No use spending $20+ for an entree that doesn't taste like Panda Express.\\n\\nFor the calorie conscious eater, the gnocchi is a good option.  Very light, not too salty, and not too fattening.  Order a drink and eat enough to avoid the desserts, which are not worth the calories.\\n\\nSo yeah, I had a good experience.  Bill came out to be $81.50, pretty low since we didn't go all out on drinks and had no dessert so I'll have to come back again.  I enjoyed the gnocchi and highly recommend it.  Still a bit disappointed about the dessert menu but enjoyed the fancy outing which I don't get much of in college."},{"name":"Garrido's","address":"360 Nueces St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is top notch for Austin dining.

I had only heard positive things from friends on the Domain location so was in much anticipation for this location to open. I love the idea of this spot with all the TVs and a brunch buffet; however, it did not meet all the expectations I was hoping for. I have only been there for brunch twice now so my experience is based on that alone, but the reviews are correct in that it does get extremely packed for brunch so make sure you arrive early or not starving because it will take a bit to get seated. The buffet is good- nothing amazing but good and they make sure to keep the turn around of the food pretty fresh. My favorites are the chicken enchiladas, migas and sausage. If they are out of something you can just ask and they will have a new one out pretty quickly. The mimosas are $1 but they are pre poured so they are never served very cold, in fact they are more like room temperature. I mentioned something to the server about this but she explained to me that since they are so busy and want to get people their drinks quickly they pre pour them, she then offered me some ice. I prefer cold champagne not room temperature and not watered down with ice so that was a bit disappointing. The pineapple one is by far the best and strongest of all the options. My friends had the burger and said it was comparable to Hopdoddy but I am not too sure about that. I will have to try that out myself. It is very loud during brunch so if you are looking for a quiet brunch this is not your place. They also have a DJ on the patio during brunch so it is more like a club atmosphere than a restaurant one. I know they have weekly specials so I will have to try those out but for now based on the brunch experience I would say this place is just average."},{"name":"Pho Pasteur","address":"682 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We stopped by Pho Pasteur for a light lunch.

It didn't help either that the spinach, feta, and sausage were all very salty - the fries were fortunately bland so they went well with the sausage and the hot dog.

Both my mother and I ordered flavored tea, which I understand takes a while to mix the flavoring into the tea. But it took 10 minutes to receive our tea.

After 25 minutes we asked one of the waitresses in the area how long it would be. She left, came back, and unapologetically stated that it would be a while longer. At this point I was already half way through my second glass of tea. I saw the family of four that was seated around the same time we were and they had received their meals. Ten minutes after we asked how our food was coming, one of the waitresses brought our meals. The flat bread was stiff and overcooked, and the chicken sandwich was cold. Since both waitresses asked how our food tasted, I suspect the communication between employees is poor. We were brought the check and nothing was taken off the bill. In my waitressing experience, if someone's food took a long time, we would suggest they get an appetizer, remind the guest we haven't forgotten about them, or at least comp the drinks.

THEY'RE BAKED. i'm all for healthy eating, but if i'm going to eat a doughnut, just give me the real deal. and if they're not fried, then i'd like to know that up front. (mainly because then i can eat 3 instead of 2 in one sitting and not increase my guilt/shame level.) like most foods, doughnuts are all about ratios. there needs to be a balance of sweet flavored outside, to light cakey/yeasty inside. revolution really missed the mark on that in both ratio and texture. a yeast doughnut should weigh a few ounces, not a few pounds. and a cake doughnut should be fried, not baked. again, the flavors are very exciting, but the execution could use some improvements."},{"name":"Patrizi's","address":"2307 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Went here because a friend and I were craving pasta but our usual place we go to was closed (oops late evening cravings).

Our waiter was very knowledgeable and helped with my wine selection. Now on to the meal. I ordered the filet with heirloom tomato risotto and saut√©ed spinach. My wife ordered the diver scallops with chanterelle mushrooms and trofie pasta. Her dish was fantastic, fresh scallops and the execution was perfect. Well seared and the pasta was excellent. My dish was however 1/2 great. My filet was good, perpetration was good and the flavor was spot on. The accompanying risotto was, well it was Chef Boyardee. It was comical, you would think with risotto being culinary 101 that at a restaurant touted to be one of the best in Disney it would be great. On to dessert. I had almond encrusted cheesecake and my wife had the chocolate mousse with bourbon creme. These were great and the saving grace of the meal. One final criticism is the coffee. This on the menu reads \\"Pressed at you're table\\". For 6.75 this should be Jamaican blue mountain. What we got was Florida swamp blend. The odor of disemboweled swamp rat is still in my nose.

Either Match knew that pens and sharpies don't fit in those itty bitty clutches, or they made a bad design decision.\\n\\nI don't mind paying $12 a pop for a good martini. However, after 3, I expect to be something other than stone sober.

Lobster clambake. If you are looking to impress, do this! It came with the largest lobster I have ever seen outside of a museum--they say 2 pounds, but this thing was at least that, maybe more. And just because it's big, it is not tough! the tail was split and it had been well-cleaned, but the claws were intact and took some serious work. Clams, tender and delicious corn on the cob, potatoes, and thin slices of chorizo fill the rest of the plate. We asked for melted butter for dipping, to supplement the sauce that was under the whole plate, and this is the right call, imo.\\n\\n Our group also ordered the cioppino, which is magnificent. Lots of seafood in a strongly flavored saffron broth with rice. (You can add lobster for $10 more, but we had lots of lobster at our table already.)\\n\\nAnd also, we got the incredible lobster roll. You may think that hot dog buns are de rigeur, but the toasted brioche roll is actually better. Great juicy chunks of lobster overflow from this beauty, served with warm lobster meat dipped in butter.  The french fries that come with the lobster roll are delicious in a dark and greasy way. \\n\\nAs an appetizer, since we had recently had raw oysters, we decided to try the scallop crudo--and it was a great choice. 4 beautiful plump fresh sea scallops, topped with a tiny orange supreme and a thin slice of hot red pepper with a drizzle of olive oil. Quite memorable and a great choice if raw oysters are not your thing. \\n\\nTheir beers are over-priced ($8-9 for bottles of beer), but still, beer goes very well with the seafood here. \\n\\nYou have to plan strategically to eat here. Around 4 pm, one member of the party has to go in person and put your name on the list, and then you will be called at maybe 7  or 7:30pm and told that your table is ready, and you have 15 minutes to show up."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"We came here for dinner around 7pm on a Friday night.

Needless to say, I was not pleased especially since this is a semi-fine dining establishment. We called the waitress over and I showed her the hair and she apologised and took all the dishes back to the kitchen. We waited about 10-12 minutes for them to replace our meal. \\n\\nThe food was tasty enough but I was a bit grossed out by the hair experience given that the 'Italian Kitchen' is not a 'hole in the wall' restaurant. I asked for the bill and what surprised me was that we were charged the full amount for the meal and not offered a discount or complimentary item for this mishap. Is that normal in these kind of fine dining restaurants or any restaurant for that matter?

As described, it's loud, hot, borderline chic but tries real hard.  My waiter Chris was great; very attentive, helped me out with wines I struggled with and guided me through the menu.  My experience was rough but he kept his positive attitude and really provided good customer service which included a complimentary dessert as he was aware it was not going well.  \\n\\nI don't complain about wine as it's a personal choice and Chris took care of me to find my taste, as many of the Italian wines they have by the glass($7-$35/glass) exhibit tannins not to my liking and are too tight.  \\n\\nI sat at the bar, big mistake.  Open kitchen concepts are great but force the head chef and floor manager to be in control of their respective areas.  The chef had good control of his team and the plating was very well done.  The pasta station was sloppy, careless and not a lot of attention went into the preparations, it was Italian fast food.  The complimentary meatball had a great texture and flavor, but the spice kick was unwelcomed.  The burrata is great and nicely prepared.  I was losing my appetite due to the wine, atmosphere and kitchen issues so I went with a pizza.  Nice, thin, crispy  crust but with cold arugala and cold Parma ham, no cheese and not much flavor.  \\n\\nNow about the open kitchen.  First, way too many staff and managers hovering in and around the bar.  I was there a painful hour plus and the managers had not enough focus or attention to any of the tables.  One manager, Sean I believe spent all but 10 minutes of my time there hovering over the plated food, sometimes grabbing the plates and pretending to drive a bus or something bizzare, laughing, leaning and talking directly over customers prepared food.  Then he spent time drawing cartoons, horse playing with the head chef and a few of the chef's closest proximity workers and generally did nothing to help staff or customers.  My observation is that this is a young team with little to no experience and they need serious direction, training and development.  When not goofing off they were watching football highlights on tv, which the Yelp site states they do not have one.  One manager that also did little of anything was goofing around behind the bar, not paying attention to the guy delivering clean glasses and hit his arm resulting in a few broken wine glasses.  He just blew it off, no aparent need to apologize.  Again, the managers seem uncomfortable in their setting due to little experience.  While eating my pizza, the burrata prep station directly in front of me starts spraying down his station directly at me, spraying no less than 20 times at 9:20pm.  I think I'm on a hidden video by now. Then Sean, head chef and two others (not my waiter Chris), gather at the end of the bar near the Peroni tap and do a shot.  Sean then proceeds to come back and hover over more food and check his emails on his phone. Another manager goes outside to make a call.  The other manager is eating standing up at the end of the bar by the wine cooler.  \\n\\nIt was a one and done experience not to be repeated."},{"name":"Food 101","address":"4969 Roswell Rd, Ste 200","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The best thing here by far were the fried green tomatoes.

Shortly after, Jorge approaches with my wedge salad AND a little cup of the gazpacho to try because I was on the fence about it. That is some serious customer service and I was so grateful for that cup of cold soup..even though it kind of felt like I was just spooning chilled salsa into my mouth and I was glad I didn't order it.

The reason why it wasn't great was because there was a ridiculously long line for a table by the window. Expected right? Typical? But a 45 min to an hour wait?.. Ah, pass. Get me as close as you can to the window tables without actually being on one because my appetite was not there to eat the view so.. We managed to take a picture before we left and before this one table got occupied. So based on photos, we could've simply said, \\"Hell yeah we got a table seat.\\" But really, no we did not.

The owner acts as though he's doing you a favor when he gets you in to the point where if it wasn't for the food I'd never go in there. I like to sit at the bar on a hot day because it's marble and it cools you off while you wait for your food but the bad part is you have to watch the smug owners attitude the whole time.

It didn't disappoint. The space is warm, lovely and unpretentious, with just the right amount of Portland whimsy thrown in for good measure. \\n\\nWe started with the foie gras, which is served on top of a medallion of \\"smoked waffle\\" and then sprinkled with huckleberries. Huckleberries make everything better. \\n\\nOur other starter was the endive salad. The bitterness of endives is always tough to navigate, but Little Bird did it right, with generous amounts of maple syrup providing a nice counterpoint that balanced everything out. Delicious, crisp, and a perfect winter salad. \\n\\nFor the mains, I went with the much-lauded burger. My partner made the wiser and more inspired choice of the poussin with pot pie. My burger was very good, but I can't get down with burgers served on ciabatta. It's never made sense to me. It tastes fine once you manage to get it in your mouth, but the hardness and thickness of ciabatta makes it a bad bun choice. One bite, and your burger starts sliding out the bottom and then the \\"rotate and hand clamp\\" dance begins. One star off for making eating a burger an unnecessary chore. \\n\\nOn the other hand, there was nothing wrong with the pot pie. Note that it's *heavily* peppered, but we thought it worked beautifully. Another great warm and hazy seasonal dish and perfectly satisfying. \\n\\nAs one would expect from a place like this, nothing to complain about with respect to the service. \\n\\nGood work, Little Bird!"},{"name":"Magnolia Cafe South","address":"1920 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"24 hour restaurants are the best kind of restaurants, especially when they have the BOMB spinach and artichoke dip!

Maybe not as peppery as the previously mentioned \\"Best In America\\" place but not disappointing by any means. The moist is wonderful (melt in your mouth, blah blah blah, etc etc etc) and is reminiscent of Black's brisket's consistency. I dare say if you like Black's brisket (and some don't!) you will like Vic's. \\n\\nSides were sides, but I enjoyed them. Potato salad was comparable to Rudy's. Normal stuff, but I always like it.

Jalapenos are .25 each so probably a bit overpriced, but the price is typical of BBQ places who charge for them. I wish they wouldn't. \\n\\nThe thick sauce is also self-serve. There is spicy and mild/medium. The spicy is a little darker. I couldn't tell the difference between the two once I tried the spicy.There just wasn't much unique about it, but I would eat it again.

I have never bought it at a store or kept it in my house either. But when I get it at a BBQ restaurant, for basically free, I devour that white bread goodness. It just feels so wrong!\\n\\nOne complaint on Vic's. I ordered a couple of sausage links and they didn't get put in the bag.

I wasn't sure if I was actually charged. Not going to deduct a star, because the food was good, price reasonable and staff was friendly.

Most the dishes are fairly heavy & may not be for everyone.  There's a theme of decadent, if not experimental flavors.  At times the flavors appear especially intense, if not unessential.  It doesn't always work, and it's not going to appease everyone.  Nonetheless, I give them credit for taking risks, and I feel bar the burger, things work for me.\\n\\nWe started with a dozen Kumamoto raw oysters.  I'm not a fan of raw oysters but my dinner companions seemed to enjoy the dish.\\n\\n'Foie Gras Torchon' came with a truffled shallots (similar to caramelized onions), a pear jam, and generous slices of brioche toast.  The shallots and jam isn't smothered on, so it's up to you to apply as much as you fancy.  I really enjoyed this dish a lot, as I felt the interplay between the flavors worked well.  The pear jam was probably a bit more sweet that I'd have liked, so I used little of it.  Quality of foie gras itself is very good.  it's dense, buttery, flavorful.  Not greasy at all.  Portion size is very generous, and the price at $16 presents a good value.  While not on the regular menu, I believe this special is usually available with different condiments.  Great dish!\\n\\n'Butter lettuce with radish and Pernod vinaigrette' salad can be a controversial dish.  I loved it, but my another of my dining companions didn't.  The greens are awesome.  The Pernod (absinthe?) vinaigrette can be a polarizing element, as the flavor has a pronounced anise & liquorice flavor to it.  To me the flavors were robust, playful, yet blended well together.  Very solid and impressive dish, but not for everyone.  I also felt that it was strange and disagreeable to bring out the salad AFTER the foie gras, as the salads were more subtle in flavor.\\n\\n'Beets, m√¢che, hazelnuts, goat cheese cream' salad was more accessible to all of us.  The subtly sweet flavors & texture of the wonderfully fresh & juicy beets worked well with the goat cheese & hazelnuts.  I felt this was a more conservative dish from the restaurant, but effective nonetheless.  For a salad, it does come across as heavy, but that's consistent with the overall theme of the eatery.\\n\\n'Le Pigeon' burger ($12)\\n(Dish Rating, 50%)\\n\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GrD-6IvFYMNdAGyFC_hXwA?userid=OWtjsyPKWUu7La7uOyC6Rw\\n\\nA-Ok burger.  I feel that the center of a burger should always be the patty.  The patty was cooked rare as requested, but was unremarkable otherwise.  When I asked the server what cuts of beef was used for the ground, he said 'sirloin'.  More emphasis was placed on the condiments.  \\n\\nCondiments ought to complement it, not steal the show or overwhelm the patty imo.  Here I felt the horseradish, roasted red onion, & cheese (not sure if it was a blue, but appeared to taste like it) had a presence that overwhelmed the  bland burger patty.  \\n\\nThe bread used is charred French roll, which I felt was distracting in that it was too tough in texture.  The complexity of the dish would have been more effective if the emphasis would have shifted from condiments to the patty, or at least on equal footing.  \\n\\nFries were likewise unremarkable and a tad over-seasoned. The good thing about the burger here is the portion size and value ($12), but then again I would not be here if those were my objectives.  Too many distracting elements, none that work well.\\n\\n'Baguette, Jambon de Paris, Gruyere, Dijon, Greens' sandwich were pretty good.  The french bread here was flattened to resemble more of a Panini.  Although a tad salty for my palate, the flavors nonetheless blended  in well.  I do feel that the dish would have been stronger if the temps were hot, but it's fairly solid nonetheless, and the $7 is very reasonable.  No wows, but good.\\n\\nService here was below average.  Our waiter (some bald dude) was not consistently attentive.  At times, he disappeared for over ten mins, and the pacing of the dishes was horribly off.  After our salads, it took us approximately 30 mins to receive our entrees.  We spent almost three hours here, with the majority of the time waiting for our dishes,  This is bordering on offensively bad service, and what I feel needs the most work.  I was also not pleased with the fact that nobody answered when we called ahead to check if the place was busy.  The restaurant appears disorganized.  Perhaps they are short-staffed on all fronts.\\n\\nDining environment is a cheerful play on the existing bistro theme with a tasteful decor.

Since I've only been here during lunches, I wonder how happening this place is during night time.  It looks like a nice, trendy spot for dinner.\\n\\nThe food here tastes good. It's not out of this world, but it satisfies the cravings. The Gyro with Pita comes wrapped in foil and is hot. You have to be careful when you handle it. \\n\\nI like the texture of the Pita, it also has a nice flavor. The meat is seasoned well and the rest of the fillings seemed fresh and also had nice flavor. The lunch plate I got comes with a bag of potato chips. You can't choose the bag, they just give you one. \\n\\nThe servers are nice and the food is good enough. I mean it's not an exciting place for me.

Now, that being said, I can hear the vegetarians on Yelp saying, \\"I can't eat at a BBQ place!\\"  Now, let me tell you: I have friends who are vegetarian/I was vegetarian myself.  While the menu is severely limited if you're a non-meat eater, there are still things on the menu that are sooooooo good.  Like the mac and cheese.  Or if you're a pescatarian, the buffalo shrimp.  Oh dear god my mouth is watering as I write.\\n\\nSecond, there's the beer.  With two bars stalked full of locals, seasonals, and belgians (on tap and in bottle), who wouldn't be able to find something they don't like?  They've got a full bar, too for those non- beer drinkers.  \\n\\nThird, it's a great place for group gatherings.  Be it for dinner or drinks, the space is great to have a group outing.  And \\"underbones\\" (the downstairs portion) offers a completely different atmosphere from the upstairs dining room and bar.  It's quite possibly one of the best places in Davis to wind down with a beer.\\n\\nA few other things to know: If you want a night in, Redbones delivers (and they do it by bike if you live nearby).

The Tavern wings and Garden Pizza were both seemingly safe choices, but both turned out to be disappointments. The Tavern Wings were definitely overstated on the menu. A plate of three total wings consisting of the drum, flat and flap all one piece is less than appetizing and very difficult to eat, had but a drizzle of the House Hot Sauce on the first wing only. This sauce tasted like a simple mixture of honey and ketchup. The other two wings were dry, simple tasteless fried wings. The Garden pizza looked like a burnt piece of simple dough with half-grilled vegetables and smothered in mozzarella cheese. I think the vegetables were green bell pepper, mushroom and white onion. Not very flavorful either. Aside from the less than stellar meal, what really ruined the dining experience was the several (6-7) staff members who came out to the patio promptly at 11:05 pm (they close at 11 on Fridays/Saturdays) and started stacking chairs loudly and slamming the furniture around - our obvious signal to vacate the restaurant. This was completely rude and definitely set the tone for this review. It's a shame that this restaurant was such a letdown. I definitely have no incentive to neither return nor bring any of my clients here. It's unfortunate that my colleagues and I who work in the corporate building adjacent to the Tavern are unlikely to dine here again. A few suggestions: keep the tavern fare simple and flavorful and drop the prices by a couple bucks, emphasize the drinks and relax the atmosphere with expanded and leisurely hours, consider Sunday brunch - it's a tavern after all, not the \\"fine\\" dining of Citrus across the way. I know it's owned by the same people, but they are really doing themselves a disservice by creating a replica across the street instead of a trendier, casual and inviting alternative."},{"name":"Italian Kitchen","address":"860 Burrard St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I love the food here.

It is insane!  There is a large party with a video camera set up, and they are having some sort of roast meets a bachelor party meets a family gathering - it was horrible.  To make it worse, our table was RIGHT next to it all, I am willing to bet our confused faces are captured for a lifetime on their lovely video.  The staff did not even bother asking us if we would mind being sat there or prefer to wait for a different table.  We had to scream to have a conversation with the person to our immediate left or right, and forget the person across the table or down two chairs, that conversation was just not going happen.  When there was actually a lull in the \\"party\\" next to us, the staff was vacuuming around us and under our chairs - I thought we were going to be asked to lift our feet!\\n\\nOur server haphazardly took drink orders, not actually asking everyone, and then did the same with food orders.  Shockingly, from what I gathered (via peoples faces and my lip reading skills), our food came out as ordered.  Apparently there was more chaos with drinks being yanked out from under the noses of my companions by the bar keep and given to another table (ridiculous) - but our end of the table simply fought for elbow room and keeping our ear drums in tact.\\n\\nAfter finishing our food, one of the servers was trying to get us to move and free up chairs, even though we had not received our check, our plates/table had not been cleared, and we were still finishing our drinks.  I personally told both her, and our server, multiple times, that both the table and chairs will be free as soon as we get our check but, \\"we can only move out of here as fast as you move.\\"  Once again, they vacuumed around us and tried to take chairs from our table with jackets on them when people were simply in the washroom - it was uncalled for and rude.\\n\\nEventually, we received our bill, we were out of there within 5 minutes - and off to an establishment that actually wanted our business.\\n\\nHonestly, as I am sure you can tell by the review and rating, I am really taken aback by the service at Redbones this last time.  \\n\\nI go to Redbones quite a bit, I talk it up to all my friends, I even organized this night out for 10+ people - my chance to show them Davis and the great BBQ joint and this was the display.  :(  I was so disappointed!  This was hands down one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had.\\n\\nI am not giving up on Redbones because the food in amazing...but I am a little gun shy now, to say the least."},{"name":"Mary's Cafe","address":"3209 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Yum!

Unfortunately, my metabolism is pretty slow and I have a fairly sparse bank account so I can only go there once or twice a year.\\n\\nWhen I heard that the owners were opening a cheaper and larger version of Le Pigeon, I was extremely excited. The ability to eat the best French-ish cuisine more than a couple times of year makes me really happy (but my cardiologist, not so much). I waited to go a few weeks after Little BIrd opened so that I could have my birthday meal there, which is appropriate since I had last years birthday meal at Le Pigeon.\\n\\nI must say, the space is phenomenal. It's large, but not overwhelming. You don't have to wait too long for a seat even at the busiest times. Furthermore, the wait staff is just as pleasant as they are at LP but there is MORE of them!\\n\\nI started with the foie gras (meat butter) with sauternes jam and white bread, and it was prepared to perfection. It was rich, but not to the point where you can't finish the small serving. The sauternes flavors in the jam really came out, with those classic flavors you'd expect of honey, flowers, and lemon peel. Absolute astounding.\\n\\nI'm a big gnocchi fan, so I went with that as my main course. It was flawless, with that perfect spongey and creamy texture, but not too gummy or dry. The herbs and mushrooms gave a nice freshness to the richness from the chevre and gnocchi. \\n\\nThe wine and beer list was one of the best I've seen at a restaurant of this caliber, but we did end up bringing a bottle of Johan to pop over dinner. Next time will be a great opportunity to sample their offerings.\\n\\nAnd of course, they had to sing to me because it was my birthday.

The BF started with the prime rib soup - the taste was delish.  He really enjoyed it, but the noodles were a little too mushy for my taste.\\nAll was redeemed, though, when the prime rib was served.  I got the regular cut, nice and pink in the middle, with a hint of salt crust.  So yummy.  \\n\\nOn a side note - broccoli was served with the meal, and I noticed that the chef dipped the pieces in what I thought was hot water before plating it.  I thought this was genious - how many times have you gotten veggies served with your meal and they're cold about 3 seconds after the plate was set in front of you? Give it a nice hot water bath, and voila - broccoli served warm!  After eating the first bite, I realized it had to be more than hot water, the flavor was amazing...turns out it was dipped in steaming hot au jus - so dang good!  Even better, it was crisp, not mushy. It's how I want to eat broccoli from here on out!

Her bowl had croutons and cheese crusted on top as you delved into the soup.  The only French Onion soup that I had had previously was simply onion broth by comparison. \\n\\nMy lady friend chose the roasted pork chop forrester with a peppered mushroom sauce. It was delicious.  Everything worked together.  I chose the cornbread and mustard-encrusted salmon with a beurre blanc sauce.  This dish practically melted in my mouth.

We had reservations and arrived at 5:30 pm and the restaurant was almost empty.  We ordered two bottles of wines, appetizers, soup, and main entrees.  I guess the waiter realized early on (his name was Alfonso judging from the receipt) his gratuity was automatic so decided to subject us to slowness as well as general oddness (he seemed quite put upon when we asked for extra baguette  with our soups) and gave us a smarmy reply at the end when he gave us our bill (we had complained of the crappy slow service to another waiter who was very attentive but unfortunately not our waiter and told him of our complaints).   \\n\\nThe sad part is the entrees were really good but we had to inhale them since our three year old was getting tired and we honestly didn't think dinner was going to be a nearly one and three quarter hour affair.

I didn't really care much for the smell of lit incense as I walked through the door. Found it to be overwhelming and it took away from the smell of the food that I was going to enjoy. It's a small establishment with minimalist decor, maybe too minimal because it felt cold - the lack customers also did not help the ambiance. We were greeted and sat right away because we were the only customers and service was very speedy.\\n\\nWe both ordered the testing menu which consisted of spinach gomae, somen with tempura prawn (choice of hot or + $3 for cold noodles with sesame sauce) and 5 pieces of omakase nigiri; plus we added the eggplant agedashi. The gomae was too sweet and had a gummy texture, I didn't enjoy this dish. The eggplant was much better. I think the eggplant could have been cooked a tad longer, but the dashi had great flavor. Then came the nigiri which was chef's choice. The fish was very fresh, which is of course key for sushi. However, I thought the chef's choices were underwhelming. The fish pretty much all had the same texture & flavor. The second to last course was the half portion of homemade somen. On this day I ordered the somen (cold) with sesame sauce. I never tried it before so, why not? The flavors were excellent. It has the same texture and thickness as vermicelli noodles. Awesome on a hot day. The tempura was standard, but it was a good compliment to the cold noodles. Finally, dessert was matcha ice cream with azuki paste that looked like house made.\\n\\nThe testing menu nigiri did not sell me on returning to try their premium omakase nigiri. I will probably be back to try their homemade udon if I'm in the area, but don't think I'll go out my way for it."},{"name":"Pho Pasteur","address":"682 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The food is decent.

We see a new restaurant and after scouring the menu online, if we see at least three items worth trying, we're there.\\n\\nSince we were unsure about whether we needed reservations on a Saturday night, we called ahead, and brought a Restaurant.com certificate. The restaurant was empty for a Saturday night at 9 pm, but we sat on the \\"patio\\" which looked like an outdoor area converted to indoor seating. There was one other couple in the same area. Our server was polite and bubbly, and very helpful in selecting a wine and drink. The boyfriend had a LARGE bowl of the Homemade Oyster Stew ($10). It is made to order and comes in a very large portion. So much that half of it went home with us for the next day. For the entree, he stuck with the Crab Cake Appetizer ($15). When they came out they were almost 100% crab meat, no bread crumb fillers...and delicious, served with an Asian sauce.\\n\\nI had the special of the day which was Lobster Risotto ($20?) and came with a side salad. The taste was impeccable. I'm a risotto connoisseur of sorts, always whipping up new recipes with it, and thought it was to die for. Slight downfall though, half way into the deliciousness my server came running out, remembering that I had ordered my salad without onions due to my allergy and informed me that there was red onions in the broth. Talk about disappointment!\\n\\nThe chef came out and talked with me about how he prepared it, how long they were cooked and said if I felt uncomfortable he would make me something else. I pushed my limits, ate a few more bites, then just got scared and decided to wrap the rest up for someone to enjoy as leftovers. (Note: I did end up having a slight allergic reaction, but the taste was worth a few hives!)\\n\\nThe dessert special of the night was a Bacon Pound Cake with a Bourbon Gelato. Being that the boyfriend and I recently took a tour of Woodford Reserve, we were all about it. He thought the pieces of bacon on the cake were a bit too large but the cake was ooey,gooey, buttery and had the right amount of saltiness with the bacon. Combined with a taste of the gelato, it was perfection. The gelato had a rich bourbon flavor, but not so much that you felt like you were taking a shot of it. \\n\\nBistro satisfied not only our foodie palates but the way the chef, manager and server went above and beyond to notice my avoidance of onions in the salad could be a food allergy and warn me of my risotto really impressed me. I normally ask if dishes include onions, but forgot this time and am so impressed and grateful at the extra steps the staff took to piece everything together and warn me. \\n\\nOnly qualm I have is that they were wrapping up the kitchen at about 10 pm on a Saturday, but that's typical of 90% of the restaurants down there.\\n\\nI'll definitely be back!!"},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food.

Luckily it did not cut me, but when I reported this to the manager they offered me more food! I wouldn't want to risk more glass, who knows where the rest of it is in the kitchen! What sort of restaurant has broken glass in the food they serve? I have worked in several upscale restaurants around Boston over the years and this situation was not only unacceptable but it could also be grounds for serious action, considering the risk to me and other patrons, but it was poorly handled by the staff. This could have ended very badly for me, but luckily I regurgitated it. My friend stopped eating her food out of concern, and the manager offered me something so I just had a glass of wine. The waitress then came over and asked if she could get me anything else? No thank you. Neither of them seemed very concerned by this. Then she immediately proceeded to serve us with the BILL for my friends meal!! I was infuriated. We were asked to PAY for this experience?

With it being our first time, we didn't realize there were 3 options, their regular, a spicy version, and regular ketchup. (We found this out from a different server, Lisa). With the chicken, didn't realize it was fried, no big deal, it was still very good. Just wish these were a bit more vocalized.\\n\\n3. Also the pita, I would have preferred more sauce on, only because it was so huge, it was decently dry in most places - I would probably just order a sauce on the side next time. \\n\\nThe reason for my 3 star unfortunately was for the service. Our server disappeared after bringing our food out and didn't ask how everything was or if we needed refills. Luckily Lisa spotted us and offered to refill our drinks for us.

I'm a pizza freak, so I had to check it out asap.  It's a great looking restaurant, a huge space, lively crowd.  Passed by a glorious looking pepperoni pie on the way to our seats, which got me even more pumped about the pizza...\\n\\nWe started with the Grilled Artichoke app, which was excellent.  Our Margherita, however, was not.  When I hit up a new pizza spot that is supposed to have a great pie, I always try their Margherita as a test.  What better way to assess the pizza, right?  Well, this one was below average.  The crust was definitely the high-point.  It was light and fluffy, yet charred just enough in many spots.  The sauce, though, lacked flavor.  It almost tasted as if it came from a can.  I understand that traditional Neapolitan pizza doesn't have a ton of mozz, but there was barely any cheese on this one.  I actually think that one of the quarters was bereft of any!  And, the cheese didn't seem high-quality, either.  It definitely did not seem like the creamy Buffalo Mozz that I expect from this style of pizza.  Overall, I'd give the pizza a 2 of 5.  Oh, their olive oil was quite tasty - we asked for some to enjoy with our bread.  \\n\\nThat said, we really liked this place and would go back for a drink and a bite if we found ourselves hungry in Southie.

It made me feel nostalgic and wishing I was once again awkwardly fondling  Kathy F in her Benetton Rugby shirt. \\nThey have  a cheap wine by the glass for under 4 bucks, a daily beer special and great TVs for watching the games.

I had the chicken and steak fajitas and they weren't bad at all.  My boyfriend had the Huasteca a la Charlie's with steak.  I thought it was pretty good.  The only problem I had with this visit was that they don't give you a lot of tortillas to go with your meal.  The waitress was non-existent, but I cut her some slack because it was busy.

I also ordered the Huasteca, but I had shrimp.  The daiquiri came with a cherry (why?!), but he said it was good.  I took a sip after a lot of prodding (I don't drink) and I didn't taste any liquor, which could be a good thing for people like me or a bad thing for people who get easily effed up.  I was pretty pleased with my meal.  The only problem that I had was my rice was not cooked great.  It was a little crunchy and I love rice so that's a borderline cardinal sin.  But, when added in the tortilla with everything else, it was unnoticeable so I didn't raise Cain.  Also, my boyfriend had the great foresight to ask for additional tortillas.  Again, the waitress was incog and I didn't have an excuse for her because it was not packed.

Unfortunately, like so may of the other reviews, the quality is lacking in most of the dishes.    Burritos are smothered in salsa or sauce which make the the tortillas soggy; the side of yellow rice with corn had strange a \\"buttery\\" taste that normally isn't present. On a small note - there are no chips and salsa set on the table - you have to purchase them as an appetizer. It's such a standard item in many Tex-Mex restaurants that is seems odd not to provide it.

We were able to meet the head chef Rafih who was an absolutely delightful character. He is such an educated man who has a passion for sharing the history and culture of his origin. Once the group arrived we were directed to softly lit, expansive room with beautiful tapestries and low to the ground tables and seating. There were lovely rugs covering the floors giving the entire space a warm, welcoming feel and an exotic ambiance.  Our host explained to us the five course meal and we were left to choose our main course. Once we had all ordered a large pot was brought to the center of the table where warm water was poured over our hands to prepare for our meal without utensils. Our wonderful chef who sat with us off and on throughout our meal explained very humorously that to eat with our hands we were given two chopsticks and the thumb is used as our insurance.  The first course of assorted Moroccan Salads with a Side of Red Harissa was served with Moroccan Bread -Whole Wheat & Honey, & Moroccan Crackers (Fekkas) once this course was enjoyed we were served Appetizer B'stella- Filo Dough Stuffed with Cornish-hen, Roasted Almonds, Spiced Eggs and Cinnamon. I would have never thought to serve a savory filling wrapped inside a flaky puff pastry with powdered sugar and cinnamon but they complimented each other so well, it was delicious. During the appetizer course of our meal we were treated to a spectacular show of talent when the belly dancer entered the dining area.  At the end of her performance we were served our main courses which varied from Cornish-Hen Tagine with Green Beans, Sweet Peas & Baby Carrots Baked in Saffron Sauce Moroccan Preserved Lemons also Grilled Filet Mignon Black Angus Beef Kebab, Grilled Quail, and Couscous with Lamb or Cornish-hen Garlic & Olives and finally the sweetest option was Cornish-Hen Tagine Baked with Apricots, Ginger, Cinnamon & Honey Sauce Roasted Almonds & Sesame Seeds. During the main course Rafih joined us it was so nice to listen to his stories. After the main course we once again washed rinsed our hands at the table only this time we received a splash of rose water and orange blossom water this acts to remove the aromatic qualities of the spices on our fingers. Once this was complete we were treated to Chef Rafih's Signature Dessert of puff pastry stuffed with chocolate and dried fruit this was served with Fresh Fruits & Moroccan Hot Mint Tea. At this time we enjoyed one final performance from the belly dancer who this time invited my daughter up to dance this was so cute and really made my little one feel extra special.

I also grew up eating great homemade Indian food and have never been fully satisfied with restaurant versions.  However, here at Vindalho everything was light, fresh and full of flavor and had a great twist on lots of traditional foods.   The chutneys and naan were awesome (naan was made to order not from a big premade basket in the back kitchen).

I was super impressed and I am looking forward to making Rising Son a permanent fixture in my brunch rotation.\\n\\nThe restaurant is located in Avondale Estates in the cute little strip of shops and restaurants on Avondale Rd. This is not a neighborhood I visit often so I was excited to step outside of my normal path and dine at Rising Son. The aesthetics of the restaurant are quite impressive. The decor is simple but beautiful with local art (some for sale) on the walls. The bar area is stylish and inviting and the overall atmosphere is kind of upscale hipster if that's a thing? That's what I'm calling it anyway.\\n\\nThe service was great and it was so refreshing to be able to walk into a brunch-serving establishment and be seated right away. This is a rarity in Atlanta. Believe you me, the promptness of seating must only be related to the fact that this location is not as \\"prime\\" as some of the more jam-packed places in Atlanta. It was definitely a \\"wait worthy\\" brunch.\\n\\nWe started off with some great coffee. They serve Batdorf and Bronson, which is always delicious. They do not currently offer espresso drinks but our server advised that an espresso machine is on their short list. I ordered the vegan grit bowl for my meal. It was SO good. It was a gigantic bowl of grits topped with a scrumptious blend of green veggies and vegan gravy. I learned that a lot of the veggies used are grown in the owner's garden. Wow! My partner ordered the frittata which was topped with home-grown arugula and shaved parmesan. Both dishes were beautifully presented. I would love it if Rising Son would expand their menu to include more vegan options but the fact that they have one dish that is so outstanding is impressive.\\n\\nParking was easy. We were able to find a spot in the back and didn't have to pay so we took advantage and checked out some of the nearby shops.

When I asked the staff what was taking so long, they gave me very curt, impolite answers. They also lied to me and gave me a variety of excuses before telling me they had actually lost my order. I grew more frustrated after 45 minutes of waiting. When I asked to speak to a manger, the staff was very unwilling to allow me to do so and then they all avoided me when I tried to ask again. I did leave my number with one staff member, as I was assured I would receive a call from the manager. No call. No apologies. No attempt to rectify their mistakes.

I don't understand    that, but maybe that's just me-- I don't love cigarette smoke in my vicinity when I'm trying to enjoy a meal.

It's also bigger in size, or at least it seemed to be and features and it should since they are owned by the same people.\\n\\nThe menu is different than Publick House, and I thought was more upscale, with dishes featuring mussels, duck, cod and even short ribs. Having purchased a Groupon-like deal for that establishment with a friend, we proceeded to go there for dinner and to redeem it.\\n\\nWe were not able to sit at the terrace without having to wait at least 45 minutes and decided to forego that idea and head inside instead. After being seated near a window, we were given both menus and glasses of water. We decided to share an appetizer, which in this case was the highly recommended chive fries, which came served with a beer & blue cheese fondue.\\n\\nThen I decided to get the roasted chicken breast, which came with roasted fingerling potatoes and succotash hash. The chicken breast was served with some au jus as well. The appetizer was pretty good, and fairly creative, sticking to their beer-theme and the chicken was good although far from great.\\n\\nAlthough a tad expensive, the food was pretty good and so were the beers we had. I didn't expect to have a bar experience there, having gone to Publick House quite a few times, and this was pretty much on par with Publick House in terms of quality and service.

Get out of your slow-cooker mindset and throw some hickory chips in there.  Then, take some bong hits while you wait the 8+ hours for it to smoke properly over low heat, then finger-pull it apart when it's falling off the bone.  Got it?  Not hard!  Smoke + stoner patience = perfect pulled pork.    \\n\\nRedbones pulled pork is yet another nicely-textured, but uninteresting, New England pulled pork sandwich that lacks the smoky punch and the vinegary bite I crave from truly good Carolina-style barbeque.  \\n\\nDirty rice side dish was poorly spiced and needed a bit more tomato and green pepper for texture.  Not to mention more chicken innards (mmm gizzards & livers...)\\n\\nHowever, hush puppies were very very good and served with New England's culinary touch of real maple syrup. \\n\\nCozy, friendly atmosphere, with friendly and helpful, though scattered, service.  \\n\\nRedbones is pretty good for these parts, but I'm sensing over-rated.

Knowing I'd never spend that kind of money on a dinner myself I decided on it.\\n\\nWe made reservations for 9pm, I figured later would be less busy, We got there a little early and were given one of those vibrator things they give you at Olive Garden or Outback Steakhouse, I was kind of suspicious then.

I'm guessing he's new.\\n\\nI chose a steak because there wasn't anything super exciting that wasn't seafood.\\n\\nMy steak was cooked perfectly but the sides were the issue. I got the blue cheese mashed potatoes since I thought eating a baked potato in a fancy restaurant would be a bit weird and awkward. The food came at a good amount of time. \\n\\nMy mashed potatoes came with 4 or 5 stalks of asparagus leaning on them. The asparagus was more than over salted, it was inedible and downright disgusting, my friend's were perfect and he tried mine and was shocked that it was so bad, you could see the salt on it. The mashed potatoes were super salty as well. Granted I'm not a huge salt fan but again for such an expensive place you'd think they'd get their seasonings right. \\n\\nWe told the server about it and he was sorry and asked if I'd like some baby bok choy instead, I agreed because I'm a fan of bok choy. It came covered in butter or oil or something and was better than the asparagus but not fantastic in any way. \\n\\nAfter we decided to have desert and I was kind of sad at the small choices and decided on the Creme Brule, it was OK. nothing fantastic about it and not disgusting.\\n\\nI'm pretty sad that my friend paid so much money for a meal I could get at any steak house for 1/3 of the price.

I had some family visiting Austin last weekend and they had seen a travel show that profiled Magnolia Cafe and wanted to try it out.  I thought...what a great way to introduce them to Austin!  Well...not really.  Yes - we had a large party and understood that we had to wait a while for a table on a Saturday morning.  But, the guy who was taking names for tables was absolutely the rudest \\"host\\" we have ever experienced.  When we tried to get an ETA on the table.... he totally ignored us...just flat out wouldn't look up and acknowledge that we were speaking to him!  We weren't impatient or rude, we just wanted to know are we talking 15 minutes more or 30 minutes more?  We had kids with us and they were starting to get cranky.  By this time we had quite a bit of time invested, so we decided to stick it out.  When we were finally seated we ordered several plates of the \\"special\\"....a Texas take on eggs benedict.  It seems that the cooks at Magnolia don't understand how to poach an egg.  Of the four plates that we ordered, one had the eggs poached properly.  We sent two plates back because the eggs were hard-boiled (at $8 a plate....I kinda want my eggs done right).  Mistake....one plate came back with such runny eggs that it was inedible.  Needless to say, we gave up at that point.  The waitress was nice enough to credit us for the inedible plate....a nice gesture.  Our out-of-town guests were very disappointed with the entire experience.  Rude front line, slooooow service, and very mediocre food.  Magnolia needs to ditch the front line guy ... no he's not cool ... he's just rude.  And, they really need to get the egg poaching down if they're going to offer eggs benedict...jeeze.

The hostess assured us there were vegetarian options, and of course, they most likely could've made us whatever we wanted, but I think there was literally one veg item on the menu...a cheese enchilada or something. Upon looking at the menu we decided we'd just have some drinks and maybe do some cheese dip and head out. Our server brought us our drinks, a beer for my fiance and a margarita for me...I think? The margarita I ordered tasted virgin err I couldn't taste a drop of tequila. Frown. I just went with it, knowing we weren't planning on committing to this place.

I explored menu's and called places. Yakitori Jinbei was the only place I could find that didn't have a menu made of only meat based broths! They had a wonderful dish of Ramen made with a flavorful soysauce based broth and when we got our order they'd piled extra vegetables on top just for us! The veggies were bean sprouts, cabbage, small bits of radish, squash and zucchini. While it may be a bit overly salty for some, it hit the spot on a cold night AND it was super filling. My husband and I joked that we couldn't imagine how rich the meat varieties were. For the meat-lovers out there, I'd seriously suggest the Ramen with the pork slices. The pork just smelled so good and they fell apart when our neighbors touched them (bad vegetarian I know). The atmosphere is understated, simple and laid back. We went on a Saturday night and thought we'd have to fight crowds, but this little place while having a steady stream of customers, never filled more than 3 or 4 tables at a time.  I'm deducting a star for two reasons: 1.  When I asked if I could replace tofu or an egg for the pork the waitress said they could only substitute chicken (is it so hard to put a few slices of tofu on top, really?). 2. The website menu didn't work so I had to call and ask. The website may not be that big a deal for most, but as a professional artist it's a pet peeve when I can't see the menu.

I did witness they're delivery to the plating station after all. \\n\\nWhile we enjoyed our meal at the counter, we took notice of another kind sir working the grill. He was the Hash Ups master. I don't know how many orders went out before we finally broke down and got some of our own. Well worth the risk of getting a stomach ache. Some of the very best hash browns I have ever eaten.

It was fairly full of trendy people on my visit and it's a cool, swanky looking place with a 1950's \\"googie\\" coffee shop meets IKEA influence.

You may want to defer. \\n\\nI tried the open faced egg sandwich (which combines rye bread, scrambled eggs, goat cheese, spinach, and bacon) and the parmesan grits from the brunch menu. It was interesting combination of flavors that I couldn't resist trying, but unfortunately didn't quite live up to expectations. \\n\\nFor starters, the grits were too rich and salty. Parmesan might work well on a pizza, but it's entirely too much in grits.  Also, If I'm eating breakfast, or brunch, I'm not sure I want something that intense that early in the day. Flavor wasn't the only problem either. The grits were very clumpy, which is absolutely unacceptable. C'mon!  It's grits! They're not that hard to cook! \\n\\nThe bad-ness didn't end there, though. The sandwich was a weird combination of strong flavors that didn't work well together (rye bread, goat cheese, and bacon) and ingredients that added absolutely nothing (the eggs and spinach). If this was my restaurant, I'd fire whomever created this dish and pull it off the menu at once. \\n\\nOverall, a lot of stylish decor and little in the way of good food.

I think I ordered a San Francisco something or other.  It was not overly sweet despite the lemon creme liquer in it.  Confession time, I like creme liquers.  Have you ever had Amarula?  DELICIOUS.  I digress.\\nOne crazy martini was enough for me.  The same cannot be said for my BFF, who ordered four different martinis.  I'm sure they were all delicious, despite the fact that they did not remain in her system for long...\\nOverall, I would say Match is a good place for a girls night out.

I have visited here many times over the years. I feel Chilis is constantly rebranding itself, and they seem to have a new menu or food options each time we come. But this option does see some heavy traffic flow, yet wait times are not usually long, and the restaurant itself is well maintained. \\n\\nThe 2 for 1s are still the best value. They offer a wide selection of what you can get for that offer, so its a real money saver. I prefer either the margaritas or the blue long islands. The drinks are tasty, but nothing extraordinary. I love their bean dip. I could eat that all night. As for the rest of their food, again, its decent but nothing memorable. Chilis is a place to go for drinks and food as an easy, inexpensive stop without settling for fast food. They can usually accommodate larger parties (like 8+) without too much of a hiccup. Our server tonight, Greg, was great. He joked with our group, and was really personable.

The variety of meat balls in particular were great (beef, shrimp, and fish).\\n\\nI liked their separate DIY sauce counter where you got to mix your own hot pot dipping sauces. They had all the staples, soya sauce, black vinegar, chili oil, chili sauce, peanut sauce, and satay. They complemented the broth well. I always stick to the spicy side. There were a ton of peppers and garlics thrown right into the soup.\\n\\nI was quite satisfied with the hot pot service at Little Sheep.

I always push for this place when going out with a group because I know there's something tasty that won't leave me feeling like a fatted calf.  \\n\\nOne polishing point for our waitress, however.  Never offer dessert while one or more people at the table are still enjoying their meal.  This is my pet peeve and it happens all the time in Austin restaurants.  What's the deal with that?  If my husband has a forkfull of chicken in his mouth, don't come over and start talking about dessert, please.  I wish managers would train wait staff in this regard.  Wait till all people finish eating and then come over and talk about dessert.  It really is off-putting and makes everyone at the table feel uncomfortable for the person still eatiing, and makes that person feel rushed.

This past weekend I visited again and to my surprise the local friends I was staying with have never been to Neptune (*gasp*). So we made it the wknd's mission to go.\\n\\nHaving waited in line for Neptune previously, I know that if you want good food, then the classic saying rings true: early bird gets the worm. It opens at 11:30 so you better get there by 11 to avoid a long wait. We woke up a bit later than planned and arrived around 11:15. There's (obviously) already a long line outside.\\n\\nWe did not get in as the first wave of patrons but luckily was told it should only be an hour wait (only is key because don't be surprised if you show up later and end up being told it'll be a 3-4 hour line). I left my cell # (they call you when the table is ready and you have 5 minutes to keep your table) and we went to a nearby bar/restaurant and killed time w/ a bottle of prosecco.\\n\\nAn hour later my phone rang. We rushed back and was seated ~15 min later. We ordered 5 varieties of oysters, cherrystone clams, as well as 2 warm lobster rolls, and a Johnny Cake (cornmeal flatbread; here added w/ honey butter, smoked trout tartare and sturgeon caviar) and a bottle of wine to share for our party of 4.\\n\\nFood:\\n-EVERYTHING is amazing. I love oysters and this place just has an incredible assortment of them. Added bonus: there are descriptions for each variety so you know what you're getting yourself into (i.e. medium vs large, high salt vs. medium salt, mineral vs. buttery vs. citrus vs. sweet finish, etc.). I absolutely love Kumamoto oysters and it delivered again this time.\\n-Lobster rolls: it's a given that ones here are godsend. It's less buttery than lobster rolls I've had at other places but I actually prefer this, as it really allows the sweetness/freshness of the lobster meat to prevail. \\n-Johnny Cake: Save your stomach space for this. To be fair I've never had johnny cake elsewhere but this is just an amazing dish. Unlike the lobster rolls, you can definitely taste the honey butter in this, but that's a good thing. I suggest getting this to be shared.\\n\\nService-- Very good. Considering how popular/busy this place is, the waiting staff can easily, if they want, be passive aggressive and rush their patrons along to allow for faster table turn-around time.

I ordered take-out that wouldn't spill since after work, I needed some food for a short road trip. Walking in the door, the setting seemed fine, an eclectic mix of modernized tables compared to Penang, but comes across to me as a bit more tacky save the booths on the right... and then a moment later, I slipped and nearly pratfalled onto my back. BE CAREFUL OF THE FLOOR. They had my order in a timely fashion and already set aside.\\n\\nThe butcher for the hainanese chicken was fine, though the chicken itself was a bit dry in comparison to Penang's, which the meat is much more juicy and slick beneath the skin. Hainanese chicken is the steamed chicken served with a chili sauce that I believe is different from the 'white cut' chicken I talk about since the 'white cut' chicken goes through a blanching process that renders the skin of the chicken white. The chili sauce that came with it had a sweet and peppery kick, but I wish there was a bit more. Also ordered the thai basil noodle, which was ho fun (wide clear rice noodles about 3x as wide as fettucine) tossed in a chili sauce with chicken, shrimp, Chinese broccoli, and onions. It was a bit lacking in Chinese broccoli (like 3 tiny pieces in the whole thing the size of half my index finger), but flavorwise, it was alright, a balanced dish in terms of not driving away customers with tamer tastes while having enough heat and curryish spice to keep those wanting such somewhat satisfied.\\n\\nI'll try this place some more, the 'wetter' dishes that I couldn't get due to my situation. But so far, it's alright. They just need to make the floor less slippery! Oh... and this seems to be the only restaurant I've seen in Chinatown that has TVs set to sports channels.

One of my favorite things to eat here are the crab claws. Fortunately I've always gone when stone crab season is in. Big Fin sells you claws individually and by weight. If you want to indulge in a titan size crab claw you can for the hefty price of $80, but hey its worth it right? As much as I love stone crab I always opt to do the Alaskan King crab claws because I feel like I get more for my money. My sister and I share the pound serving which brings for decent sized claws. \\nThe crab meat always comes out whole and in lumps (you know it hasn't previously been frozen). Something else to note is that service here is also always on point. Our server had great presence and made sure we were all having fun throughout our meal. We also had the restaurant owner come over and made sure we were liking our meals. We were surprised that the owner and not manager came over, so that was a special moment for our evening.

Whether the temp is too low in the oven, the timing is off, or the oven needs a cleaning, the time they're used to cooking a pizza leaves it a little unevenly cooked and kinda doughy for my taste.

My friend got the sampler trio which consisted of jambalaya, chicken gumbo, and a crawfish pattie (like an empanada). The plate was wiped clean! \\n\\nDessert was the pi√®ce de r√©sistance.

Well, maybe except for the wait. I love seafood! It's kinda my thing.\\n\\nThe goods: \\nI ordered 3 different types East Coast Oysters and they were amazing. I wish I could tell you what they were, but I insisted on letting the waiter choose them for me. On a side note, if you don't know what's good just ask the waiter/waitress. The Oysters were shucked on the halfshell and placed on a bed of crushed ice served with condiments. Not bad for approx $2.50 a pop.\\n\\nThen there was the HOT or Buttered Lobster Roll. I can't even begin to tell you how awesome this thing is! It's a good amount of lobster chunks in the roll served with fries. The fries are also very good and are often overlooked because the lobster roll just eclipses it. The roll is $25 and is worth every penny. When the lobster roll hits your lips it just melts in your mouth. The lobster topped with warm butter very tender and the roll containing it all together is moist. It's pretty much a perfect combination. To top things off I had a Peroni to finish it off.\\n\\nThe ONLY complaint:\\nThe wait was a little long. Give or take an hour or so just to get a table. Luckily for me I had a layover for 3 hours and got a seat at the bar right away.\\n\\nOverall:\\nIt's a quaint little place that has a knowledgeable waitstaff with passion for what they serve. From talking with some locals and outsiders like myself, I've found that this is probably the best hole in the wall place. People are friendly and the food is amazing. Good place for good seafood, if you can find it.

There are a bevy of burrito places around town: Chipotle, Moe's, Willy's and a newcomer to the area: Q'doba.  And I've tried 'em all.  And Chipotle's the winner, hands down.\\n\\nMaybe it's because their products are organically grown, ethically raised, and hormone free.  Maybe... or maybe it's because their spicy vinaigrette for the salads has crack secretly mixed into it.  Whatever the reason, I think their salads are awesome.\\n\\nEven though, whenever I go, there's a line, this Chipotle knows how to move people along with speed.  I can get in and out in under 15 minutes tops.  The staff working behind the glass are friendly and listen to my requests as they're building my salad.  Ingredients are fresh and you can see them continually making more batches of everything to bring up to the front. so that's really reassuring to consumers.  And it all tastes hot and fresh, even when I get it to go.\\n\\nThe only downfall of Chipotle in general is that they charge extra for guacamole.  Normally, I just go without because paying an extra $1 (?) for guac's a rip off.  Other than that, they're reasonably priced and good quality when I'm in need of a quick bite.

Case in point, the $36 lobster guacamole was basic at best for the price.  It was table guac, which isn't usually much more than about $12 at most restaurants, but the amount of lobster meat wasn't worth the extra cost, in my opinion.  Don't get it twisted...the guac was divine...it'll just be hard to justify that sort of appetizer spend again.  \\n\\nSo, Paddlefish is known for their craft cocktails, so of course we had to partake...I started with a blackberry jalape√±o margarita, rimmed with black Himalayan salt, and it did not disappoint!  The only feedback I'd give is that the salt rim, while creative in design, was not very functional, as the glass was salted down the side, rather than around the rim, so most ended up making my hands sticky instead of my lips smacky!  I'd suggest this cocktail with maybe a special request for the salt rim...it's what I'll do next time, as I'll definitely have it again!  My husband had a whiskey & he was quite pleased, so we'll leave it at that for the booze.  \\n\\nFor the meal, we split one of the Seafood boil buckets, and it was way too much delicious food, even though we split one of the build your own buckets.  My only wish is that they'd offer a preset combo that doesn't include the meat because we didn't want the chorizo this time around, and we had to pick a combo that we otherwise wouldn't, if all options were included on the pick two menu.  The other items were available on the add-on menu, but at that point, the amount of food would have been obscene!  Good thing we're not shellfish (see what I did there? )...we left the rest for some other seafood lover!  \\n\\nCall me a shrimp, but I can only handle one cocktail, mostly due to sweetness, so at this point, I switched to a nice Sauvignon Blanc.  I was happy to see that they offered something other than Kim Crawford, but still from Marlborough, so I tried the Fire Road and was pleased as punch!  \\n\\nAt this point, we were about full, but we haaad to try the dessert, right?!?  We got the rich, flourless chocolate cake, with mascarpone & raspberry coulis...Holy Wow this dessert was amazing.  Rich is an understatement...we nibbled on it as much as we could, then even had some the next day and still never finished.

No problem.\\" So that just hyped me up even more. This wiener comes out and I have NEVER seen a sadder wiener. It lacked in toppings, flavor, and size. The amount of food I got for $14 vs the tables next to me was ABSURD. Massive wieners come out from the kitchen topped with green sauce goodness, melted cheese, and what looked like delish corn. And here I am, Janis Ian sitting here with a small ass wiener and Regina George (Lincoln in this case) is just literally ruining my life.

Of the small plates I sampled, the lobster naan was outstanding, as was the stuffed quail with a delicious lemon yoghurt sauce. Good wine selection with some unusual South American wines by the glass, and sufficiently robust to stand up to the moderately strong flavours.

The doughnuts are great, especially the filled doughnuts like the peach sliders, figgy doughnuts, etc. I'm dying to know  their recipe for the cream filling! The only caveat is that the last time I was there the fried doughnuts I bought had a weird off-putting smell to them- kinda fishy like the oil was rancid or something. It's the first time I've noticed something like that though.\\n\\nThe reason I'm giving this place three stars is because of service and availability. The service certainly leaves something to be desired. Each time I've been the staff has been more than friendly but incredible slow. Last time I went during a slow afternoon and they managed to lose my order in the time it took to put cream and sugar in my coffee. There were three young women standing around the front talking to each other and one in the kitchen chowing down on a doughnut in the window.\\n\\nAs to the availability, I know they close when they sell out so they recommend getting there early to get the best selection. And fresh = best and I know they're not a Dunkin Donuts (don't want that anyway). But if you get there too early the filled doughnuts aren't available yet and if you get there too late the selection is limited. There's a sweet spot where you can find all varieties but I haven't figured out when that is yet. I love following them on Facebook and it would be helpful if they consistently posted what is being serving that day.\\n\\nOverall, I'm glad Revolution Doughnuts is here and I look forward to them working out the kinks so they become a Decatur mainstay."},{"name":"Golden Dynasty","address":"11128 SE Foster Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Great food!

This place usually gets busy at the noon hour and closes close to four o'clock. I would recommend coming early or right before closing. The only reason I rarely come here is because of their prices.

After strolling through the main dining are on the way out to the patio, I was already impressed with how comfortable Barcelona felt on my first visit. For what is often regarded as one of the finer dining experiences in the German Village area, Barcelona is not the least bit stuffy or pretentious. On top of that, the enclosed patio here is one of the best in Columbus that I've ever been to. A seat out there may require an excessive wait if you don't make reservations in advance, but the scenery out there is truly something to behold. \\n\\nThe dinner my friends and I decided on was kicked off with a plate of the chickpea hummus, a selection that wowed everyone within minutes. The texture of the hummus was creamy but highlighted with vegetable chunks here and there, and was served with warm flatbread chips that were better than anything I've ever had at Happy Greek. I chose the Noodle Paella for my entr√©e and can say with confidence that it was one of the finest dinner entrees I've ever encountered while living in Columbus. The blend of broccoli and seafood with a light glazing of garlic was evenly flavored and tasted like nothing I've ever had before. Needless to say, you have to try Barcelona to know what all the rave reviews are about. Spending upwards of $50 on a meal and drinks is likely, but if you're in the mood to give yourself a rare treat in a stunning setting, you owe it to yourself to do it here."},{"name":"Redbones BBQ","address":"55 Chester St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"PBR ON TAP!!!! any place that offers this is fine by me.

The baked beans that came with the ribs were packed with flavor. I had the baby back ribs. I've never seen so much meat on baby back ribs in my life. Sauce came on the side which was a nice treat.

We had made reservations ahead of time, which is nearly a requirement - especially on a Friday night! They even decorated our table with \\"Happy Anniversary\\" confetti, which was a wonderful little touch that we all appreciated. I had ordered (and paid for) flowers through Open Table when I made the reservations, but somehow they never found their way to the restaurant. It was at no fault of anyone at the restaurant, but the hostess was apologetic and the manager made sure to introduce himself and apologize. He even brought out a large floral arrangement that they had in the back as an attempt to make up for the mistake. \\nI had requested a window table, but they let me know ahead of time (in the confirmation call) that the tables only fit four people, so our group of 5 would have the next best option. They seated us at a round table that faced the windows, which was great, but I would have preferred the large booth overlooking from behind. I disliked how loud the restaurant is, but it is large, so it's understandable. \\nOur waitress was great, I wish I remembered her name. She was the perfect example of a wait staff professional throughout our entire meal. \\nWe started with the crab cakes, which were phenomenal. Everyone was happy with their dinner choices, but nothing was remarkable. I had the aged top sirloin, which was a little lack luster for a $45 steak. The mashed potatoes are nothing special, nor were the green beans. Dessert, however, was great. We had a blueberry cake with blueberry ice cream - yum! The restaurant even brought out a complimentary dessert for my parent's as a little anniversary gift. \\nOverall, we had a great time. PCG went above and beyond to make sure we have a special evening, and we are so grateful to them for that. I definitely recommend PCG for celebrating a special occasion, they will certainly make it memorable."},{"name":"LOCAL Public Eatery - Kitsilano","address":"2210 Cornwall Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Location, location, location. This place has that going for it. If all you care about is sitting out by the beach, then it's a go. Worst service I've had in awhile.\\n\\nLocal has been on our Vancouver 'bucket list' since moving to Kits. We really wanted to sit on the patio (who wants to sit inside on a beautiful summer night?)...which added up to waiting for an hour for a table on a Monday evening. Generally, waiting that long for a table has great rewards. However, I didn't find that to be the case here. I'm now baffled as to why this place seems to always be busy.\\n\\nThe patio was decent sized for Van with rustic wooden tables and heaters that would have been nice on a chilly night. The view was pretty much of Cornwall street. You can only catch glimpses of Kits Beach through the tree branches.\\n\\nAlthough the menu was quite small, our waitress didn't have a very good handle on the menu and when I asked if I could have a protein burger, it was a no-go. How hard is it to slap some lettuce on a burger? Anyhow, it's not on the menu and I get that...so I ordered the chicken Ceasar salad.\\n\\nMy salad was descent, but there was very little chicken on my chicken Ceasar salad. Maybe 5 strips. What chicken there was was grilled well with a charbroiled flavor and the dressing was good. Lettuce was crisp. I would have liked to have seen more chicken than croutons. \\n\\nOur service was negligent at best. I got the overall sense that the service was disorganized and chaotic. It ended up to be the hostess who eventually brought our food to our table after we received someone else's order. Chaos. Granted, we noticed the tables around us (with other servers) had quite nice service. Must have just been our sloth of a waitress. We had to flag her down twice. Once for ketchup and another time to pick up an incorrect order that was brought to our table. She never once checked in on us. We then waited nearly 30 minutes for our check after we had finished eating. Our waitress was nowhere in sight to even flag her down. I've never been so tempted to just get up and leave. \\n\\nThe washrooms were a little confusing for my little blonde head. There's a row of 'one-holers' with hyrogliphics next to them to indicate whether they're male and female. Ends up the men's room is the \\"i\\" looking symbol and the women's are the squiggles furthest to the right. Washrooms were nice with modern touches once I figured out which ones to go in.\\n\\nNever again would I wait an hour for a table here.

You have the option of parking off street but that is very limited due to the other neighboring restaurants in the area. There is also a parking garage not too far(behind Shin Sushi) but I'm not sure the restaurant validates. But doesn't hurt to ask!\\n\\nThe restaurant is very clean and inviting with outdoor seating but we opted for seating inside at a hightop table. In the center is a large bar that is the focal point of the restaurant but there are tables throughout the space.    They have some great Happy Hour specials and I appreciated that even though I arrived with minutes to spare, our server, Camaren, raced over to let me know that HH was ending in 2 minutes. I don't think most servers would go out of their way like she did at that moment, so I totally knew this was going to be a great dining experience. And I was pretty much right. \\n\\nFor starters, I ordered the smoked fish dip ($10)  which I was told was made with mahi mahi. It came in a glass jar (it was actually pretty deep) on a tray with a sleeve of saltine crackers and some jalapenos strewn. You can also ask for extra jalapenos if you like to go crazy. This was probably my favorite thing that I had here. My dining partners ordered the bruschetta with bacon, beans and arugula  and the poutine which had duck gravy and smoked meat. While I couldn't partake in trying due to my dietary restrictions--they raved about both so I can safely say they were enjoyed!   As far as entrees go,Yelp Eliter Lani G. and I each ordered the Fried Chicken entr√©e. At $15 this is one standout of a deal. When the plates came out, we stared in bewilderment at how massive the dishes were. As well as kicking ourselves that we didn't just share a plate. It came out with 2 massive pieces of beer brined chicken thighs in buttermilk dredge with pickles and homemade hot sauce. It also comes with a potato salad but since it has bacon-- I opted for the housemade, handcut fries instead . Camaren didn't give me any issues about substituting and there wasn't any sneaky fees on my bill either.   Anyways the chicken was sooo good-- crispy and juicy on the inside.  I barely finished one and had sooo many leftovers for when I got those hunger pains later in the evening. ;)   \\n\\nWhile the menu has many items that are heavy on the meat, there are a handful of salads to choose from as well as a garden pizza. If you don't eat bacon, etc  just make sure to ask about dishes as some incorporate a small amount.  Camaren also mentioned a Sunday Brunch to us that may be worth checking out. \\n\\nOverall, this meal was quite enjoyable (thanks Camaren for the stellar service) and a great value. My cocktail ($1 off due to HH), smoked fish dip and MASSIVE fried chicken plate came out to $31.95 before tip.   Annnnd, I had a second meal to bring home.  :)"},{"name":"Joey D's Oak Room","address":"1015 Crown Pointe Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Absolutely terrible experience!

This place is a gift from the heavens. I always wish for a dollar each time someone asks me where I get my protein, but now that wish has been fulfilled. VEGAN SOFT SERVE. All kidding aside (I eat enough kale, lentils, chickpeas and whole foods to balance out even a nightly FoMu trip, not that I'm advocating adding that to my diet), this place is incredible. It's a great addition to the little vegan strip on Cambridge Street. We frequent Peace O' Pie, Grasshopper is practically a vegan institution, and my husband loves the seitan sandwich at Deep Ellum. There's even a vegan taco at All-Star Taco Bar. Allston, what gives?\\n\\nAnyway, FoMu has amazing options for hard ice creams. Most are coconut based, but some are nut based. They indicate quite clearly on their menu which flavors are based on which, and if there are any potential allergens. Some flavors the night we were there included: Salted caramel (First of all, vegan caramel. Hold the phone. Second of all, Salted. Caramel. Ice cream.) The also had mint carob chip, avocado, carrot cake thai peanut, and a personal childhood favorite- black raspberry. They have plenty of the classics, too. \\n\\nToppings review: Basically, if you dream it, it's there. Mochi bits, agave-sweetened gummie bears, dark chocolate chunks, certified vegan jimmies (rainbow and chocolate), coconut 'marshmallow' creme, nuts, fudge, caramel sauce, etc. \\n\\nMy husband got the salted caramel topped with certified vegan rainbow jimmies. It was incredibly savory and had a strong, buttery caramel flavor. It had little bits of irresistible caramel mixed in, and I tried to snag a few without making it too obvious that I was fishing for the good stuff. \\n\\nBack to the softserve: The night we went, the flavors were chocolate and peanut butter or twist. TWIST! I got mine in a cake cone topped with chocolate jimmies. The cones are all gluten free. Unlike most twists where the flavors meld into one indistinguishable glob, I could taste distinct stripes of chocolate and rich peanut butter. It was smooth and perfectly 'twisted' at the top- just as I remembered cones of the past being. The jimmies tasted of dark chocolate tidbits, and the cone was light and just sweet enough. \\n\\nSizing was very generous, and pricing was on target with other local dairy (read: cow's milk/cruelty based) ice cream parlors in the area such as JP Licks, etc. They do charge $.25 extra for a cone, and toppings are $1.00 extra for dry, $1.50 for wet. A little steep, but the toppings are quality. They also have pastries from Veggie Galaxy, MEM tea and milkshakes and sundaes. \\n\\nAnyway, if I haven't convinced you, I've at least made myself hungry again.

The server looked disgusted and stated that he wouldn't be able to accept it on the phone--only hard-copies.

Service was O.K. Food was a little below par. The FALAFFEL Apetizer i tought it was good but the GYRO was just O.K. I never had a GYRO where the PITA was chewy! it seems to me that the PITA Was Microwaved so not a fan of microwaves; overall though it was OK ( meaning 3* ) The reason why i give this place 2* is because the waitress added a 20% TIP to our check. In my opinion she deserved 15% ( Do not get me wrong I do TIP and TIP well if service is spectacular) my standard is 15% regular service 18% service beyond regular 20%+ Spectacular service! well service was just OK. I told my friend i would come again PRIOR my check. I mean it was OK. However when I asked why 20% tip the waitress said: It is just restaurant policy (when using a \\"COUPON\\"). I am sorry if ur restaurant has a policy on TIPPING that is just wrong. My service was average so normal = 15%) I normally tip 18% however is the principle the customer  is not allowed to make a judgement. End of the DAY I told my friend I wouldnt come back ( after i said i would ) It is sad to me this BUSINESS decission ( YES ONLY $1.00 Difference ) made a huge impact on this place. It is fine i can go and take my business elsewhere. Which is what i felt when i went to this place. If you cannot afford a GROUPON then dont advertise. To me the whole point of this is you advertise youself people go if the like it would come again. I wouldve but after this NEVER.\\n\\nE"},{"name":"Garbo's Lobster Truck","address":"12709 N.

They had the Netarts from Oregon and my favorite Shigoku Washington oysters! They were about $3 a pop and tasted very fresh.\\n\\nA boul of Soupe du Jour - Pureed celery root with apple and butter crostini - it was alright, lots of celery flavor!! Literally like drinking pureed Celery smoothie.\\n\\nFoie Gras Torchon - I was disappointed with this one. We live in California and foie gras has been banned since 2013 so we really want to eat it again while we were in Oregon. We didn't realize that this was a pate, so it was highly processed and lost a lot of the real foie gras flavor to it. It was served with some bread.\\n\\nChicken-Fried Trout - A whole trout fried in batter, topped with pickled carrots, herbs, radishes, and dijon with butter lettuce for wrapping. I've never had trout like this before. It was certainly unique. Crunchy, fried and tasted like chicken. I really enjoyed it and couldn't finish it because it was a whole fish! It was fun to wrap them in lettuce, but be careful, there are small bones in the fish. \\n\\nHeirloom tomato salad - freshly sliced giant heriloom tomatoes with cheese, fresh tasting but nothing too special to it.\\n\\nCassoulet - a stew like dish with duck leg, pork belly, sausage and white beans, a total dude dish man. My boyfriend ordered this because he wanted something with hella meat in it and this was perfect. The portion was huge and piping hot. I almost burned my tongue from it. It tasted very Italian, very hearty and delicious, a perfect dish for the fall season! \\n\\nCarrot Popover for dessert - Pistachio crunch, cream cheese ice cream, pistachio puree, and ground cherry. I love this because it was very pistachio-ey, one of my favorite things. The cream cheese ice cream was soooo yummy and paired well with the crunchiness of the pistachio. It was hard to enjoy because I was already stuffed to the max!\\n\\nThe service here is great! The staff are friendly, attentive, and professional.

For lunch I ordered Mofongo with wine garlic wine sauce and Carne Frita. My husband got the Chicharron with rice and bean. All the food was great. Alcapurrias were a nice surprise. I really like plantains and loved the tad of sweetness with the beef. Tostones were spot on. They were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. There was a dipping sauce that I wasn't sure what it was but it reminded me of a ketchup mayo mix that I actually like to use with french fries. I enjoy plantains so much that I even got it with my entree. This was the first time I had mofongo. Mashed plantains with wine garlic sauce was so yummy. Mix in some pieces of fried pork and I was pretty content. We all really enjoyed our food and enjoyed hanging out and visiting with each other but then we were wondering where the server went.

Aprisa manages to impress you with the authenticity, simplicity,  and freshness of their ingredients. I suppose this is the part where I mention that I am a Mexican, and that I know a thing or two about tacos. Aprisa got about a thousand points in my book when I unwrapped my no-fuss, one dollar tacos and found that: 1) they used two small corn tortillas (no gargantuan flour tortilla here; if you're looking for the Chipotle-esque, parachutilla, go there) and 2) there was a freshly cut lime wedge carefully packed in with my two tacos.

I'll stick with bottled beer, thanks.\\n*Offering food? How about something edible and not something that looks so disgusting it made me throw up in my mouth a little.\\n*Showing off your venue?

The chips are lime flavored pita chips branded with Aprisa, which was a different experience. The guacamole was probably the best I have ever had at a fast food or restaurant. The spicy salsa (which people bash) is really the leftover seeds from what they strained the red salsa from so it's a little bitter and has more of the roasted or burnt taste.Therefore, it's going to taste funky and if you like stuff spicy, don't get it. After a while the taste grew on me but the initial taste was overwhelming and almost ruined the steak burrito bowl for me. The steak, on the other hand, was juicy and tender...yum! My partner got the tacos with chicken and those were pretty tasty. For me, the big test is how long something stays in my system before I need to find the nearest porta potty ha!

I've only been twice so far and I'm simply overwhelmed by the selection of well......everything.  Thankfully, I have only ever ventured in after 9 PM.  I know this isn't ideal or even possible for everyone but if you want a pro tip, this is certainly it.  I'm sure it's a nuthouse at 2 PM on a Sunday and I'll be staying far, far away at that time.  \\n\\nThe food court to the right when you walk in has at least 10 food stalls, anything from pizza to sushi made fresh in house.  I actually took the wife here on a \\"date\\" and she loved the sentiment while enjoying some decent sushi rolls (kelp and brown rice, anyone)?  Going into this area alone is an adventure and one doesn't even need to do any real grocery shopping to enjoy a great part of Wegmans.  We sat upstairs in a lounge area with a fireplace and TV.  They also have a separate room with a kids romper room, booths in another area and small tables that align the second level.  You can see it in one of the pictures I posted.\\n\\nI guess I shouldn't be surprised but still am at the amount of organic offerings throughout the store.  They even have their own line of organic milk which is nice to see, at a decent price of only $3 for a half gallon.  Kudos to also putting milk and eggs up front in the store so people don't have to lug to the back of the football sized warehouse to get some staples if that is all that is needed.

Boy, was I disappointed.  First, let;s get one thing straight:  this is not Spanish food.  The \\"Spanish\\" items, except for those ready to serve (cheeses, jamon, etc) are simply nothing like you would encounter in Spain.  Still, the food has always been very interesting and nicely prepared.  Not last night.  Maybe the menu, which was pared down, was a Sunday-only menu, but it was extremely limited.   The gazpacho was horrendous.  My wife, who has had gazpacho many times, both in Spain and in the U.S.,  said it tasted like canned tomato juice with and bit of other veggies.  And whose idea was it to pair grapes with tomato?   Stay away from this dish.  Mussels were excellent but the chistora sausage in the dish was just links, not diced so you could taste it with the mussels.  Lamb shank was very good (although it may have been bought from a perveyor already cook-ed sous vide) but had not been browned before braising so sat there grey and unappetizing.   By the way, the menu listed it as Cordero a la brasa.  A la brasa means grilled, not braised.  They should know this.  The accompanying sweet potato/corn dice was actually pretty good but had nothing to do with the lamb.  Calamari was good.  Jamon serrano de bellota was one thin slice, machine cut, and served indifferently. This wonderful ham should be cut in small one-bite slices so they can be savored as they burst into flavor while melting in the mouth.  Never machine cut it.  Shows a lack of respect to this incredibly good ham.  All in all, the food was bland and disappointing.  It was also expensive for the quality and portion size (have they cut portion size for some reason?) The service was from a very I-know-more-than-you-do kind of young man.  Alas, he was under-informed about the food and the wine, acting as if waiting tables was somehow beneath him.  All in all a very bad experience.

There is a lot of things this place does right and would warrant 4 stars, but customer service is not one of them.\\n\\nDropping a buck fifty for 2 people with $17 in drink means we came for the food we had heard so much about.  All in all it didn't disappoint.  Perfect ambiance, great host.  Reasonable, knowledgeable  and proficient-ish waitstaff.  Some dishes wowed (the duck was memorable for sure, mushrooms the same).  Some were not as memorable.  That is my fair review of the Resturant.  Now the negative...which is not just my singular bad experience, but instead a comment on how they treat customers.\\n\\nThe waiter brought \\"the special\\" salmon I had ordered.  Looked good, I dove in and it was somewhere between barley warm and just room temp.  All of it.  Salmon very rare...not even a question.  I asked the server if this was what the chef intended, he wasn't sure and took it to be re-fired.\\n\\n10 min later, after watching the rest of the table eat, it appeared.  It was hot and it still had the bite I had taken out of the salmon.  They couldn't have been bothered just to re-fire the order that had been sitting so long before it got to me it was plain cold.  That's not the end -- the manager brought it to me making a pouty, sad face (wtf?) set it on the table and left.  No words.\\n\\nLet's move on - at the bill I asked the waiter if he ever got to the bottom of how the chef intended that dish.  He said it should have been hot and cooked a touch under medium.  I then took a look at the bill....let me first say at the most I would expect the manger to buy my one scoop of sorbet, at the least a \\"sorry we didn't deliver this time, please give us another try\\"...that would be the least I would expect.

The biscuits are a perfect, flaky, doughy texture to set the stage for the rest of the ingredients.  If you're like me and you always have to go big when trying a new place, then you'll also need to try the Reggie Deluxe since it's the largest, most delicious item on their menu.  If you don't feel like you'll be hungry enough to eat this towering biscuit with fried chicken, cheese, egg, bacon, and lovely country gravy, you will after waiting in line for 30+ minutes to eat.  Don't let that deter you, it's certainly worth the wait!\\nI hear their other biscuits are just as enjoyable of you're still aiming at a smaller bite for your brunch experience.  I know the cocktails are also a hit, since I tried the Bloody Mary and wasn't let down.  They also have a bourbon tea, mimosas, greyhound, and other daily special cocktails, as well as a few local draft brews.\\nFor the food and drinks alone, 5 stars no doubt.  As for the mechanics of this place, 3 stars, and here's why.  You must order before sitting down, and once in the door you have about 3 minutes to look at the menu above the register and put together what you want to eat, what sides you want, and what drink you'll have.  Too much pressure.  Also, once you order you must wait for your drink which is made immediately at the front counter, then go and find seats, since their is no hostess, you are on your own.  When we found a table, it was very dirty with jam or jelly of some sort all over the table and biscuit crumbs tossed about the area.  There are no wait staff to buss the tables since people are expected to do this themselves, but we didn't have a rag or anything to wipe our table down so we had to wave someone over to get them to wipe our table off, kind of a hassle.  I understand keeping overhead lower by limiting staff, but someone needs to at least keep the tables clean and clear for guests.\\nI'm a fan of this place for the food and drinks, and I'll probably definitely be back, but I might be making my order to-go!"},{"name":"Lincoln Tavern and Restaurant","address":"425 W Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Always heard great things about the brunch, it was AMAZING.

The scallops were pretty good, but the fish was decent at best, nothing we would want to come back for.  Management needs to change the carafes to make it easier to pour - it wasted so much time to have to wait for the waiter each time to pour.

I was so excited to hear that they were opening in Atlanta because I never got to visit them when I lived in NY.  I had a buddy there whose hobby was eating.  I say this only half in jest but she absolutely adored the place.  Every single time she went, I had other plans and never got to go with her.  She described the guacamole that they made at the table with drool rolling off her chin.  When I heard they were opening here, I did a little jig.  The first time I ate there the whole experience was great.  I had a frozen pomegranate margarita and some of the most delicious mole sauce.  My friends seemed to really enjoy the place as well.  Then we went back to try the tableside guac and some of the other entrees.  The guac was really good and the entrees were okay.  The service was just okay.  The next few times I went there it was a continuing roller coaster ride.  Once the guac tasted more like lime than guac, and the hot sauce wasn't hot.  The pork I had was tasteless.  It was becoming very unmemorable and I'm a pretty decent cook and felt I could do better.  The last time we went it was just okay which was very disappointing.  And then there was the waiter who seemed like he lacked in personality or was heavily medicated.  I know sometimes these type of restaurants for some reason like to hire people that look good but really aren't good waitstaff, but this guy was neither.  It was very frustrating and since the food wasn't really that good we made the decision to take our business elsewhere and not return.  Alright I'll try to end on a more positive note -- the decor is really pretty and they have a cool water wall."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Everything is served family style here.

The hostess lost my reservation for 10, but quickly seated our group with little to no fuss.\\n\\nThe buffet itself is a little bit of a letdown because I've had much to compare with. The India House buffet in Chicago is much more delicious, has greater selection, and the naan is more authentic. We went at 12:30 but the salad at the salad bar had already run out...they refilled it in due time, but not quick enough. The chickpea salad was great - but something you could recreate at home. Some of the other hot dishes were actually cold and though the tandoori chicken tasted good, it was NOT authentic stuff. \\n\\nUnfortunately the naan at Mantra is not chewy with some crunch like most other Indian places. Their naan is rolled flat in a MACHINE (fail) and then baked. The naan is more like a cracker. Though it tasted fine, the cracker was no naan and it lacked so much stone oven flavor...I was disappointed. \\n\\nOverall, I'd go back if I had cravings for some curry and it was good for a big group. The atmosphere was hip, young and lively, but I wouldn't call this place authentic or mind-blowing whatsoever.

This didn't bother me too much as brunch dishes are pretty universally friendly, but I'm an herbivore, and he's an omnivore, so if this had been at dinner, it would have been annoying.  My frittata came out first and the combination of the buttered leeks and butternut squash was great. We polished off almost all of it before the steak and eggs came. I can't vouch for the steak, but the eggs were filled with cheddar and everything was on top of cornbread in a skillet.

The appetizers (cheese plate, crackers, grapes, beet salad) had flies hovering around them which was rather unappetizing. \\n\\nFor the price point, we mostly got small bites which were not filling. The tomato soup amuse bouche was delicious! The meat sliders were juicy and flavorful-- cooked perfectly. The shrimp sliders were strange in texture and felt really processed. Poorly executed. The flatbread was so-so with prosciutto and arugula. The lamb kebabs were fine, a little gamey. Overall rather blah mediocre menu, and we were all still hungry. \\n\\nThe desserts shined though! Three different desserts which were all very good including the bonzo and the praline cheesecake. The waitresses seemed very unaware of the menu, and when asked what the dessert was.. she responded, \\"some nutty cheesecake thingy.\\" LOL.\\n\\nAlso, my friend is vegetarian for religious reasons, and as you see on the above menu, the only thing she could have had is the amuse bouche. So she asked to order some vegetarian pasta. The waitresses checked, and said yes it would be okay. Lo and behold when the check came out they charged her the full pre-fixe price and said the pasta would be \\"comped\\". No one had communicated that when she ordered the pasta. So we asked about it to the manager. The manager came over and said that this was the deal made when the venue was booked. Alright fine. But then he disappeared and came back with a check just for the pasta.\\n\\nTo OUR SHOCK and DISMAY, he went BEHIND HER BACK to the main organizer of the event who ended up paying for my friend's full price pre fixe meal that she did not eat. He did not tell my friend he was going to do this. So instead of just communicating to her that unfortunately the full price would have to be paid, he went and charged NOT ONLY for the previously \\"comped\\" pasta but also for the pre fixe meal. Sometimes an apology is sufficient! My friend would have been willing to pay the pre fixe price if there was just COMMUNICATION!\\n\\nAnd just so you know they add 18% gratuity AND a 3% \\"party fee\\"...

The bacon was too firm so It was difficult to take bites of the sandwich that had a little bit of everything. The cheese was a problem for me because there was nothing done with it. What I mean by this is that the cheese was not melted at all, and it was just a slice of cold cheese on top of the chicken. The biscuits themselves were good in my opinion. They were soft and not dry at all which is a problem that many biscuits face. The best part of this sandwich was definitely the gravy. The gravy was super delicious and I think made every part of the sandwich better. It was good that they gave so much gravy too, because otherwise I would consider the sandwich to be fairly plain. \\n\\nOverall, this would be a place I would try again.

The restaurant was busy due to the bruins playing but we were sat within ten minutes. I ordered a blue raspberry hooteraid and two of my friends ordered a pitcher of beer. When their drinks came out and the rest of the drinks arrived I still did not have my hooteraid. Our waitress did not take our food order till after 35 minutes and by that time I still did not have my drink! We tried to get her attention several times but she refused to make eye contact with us. When we finally were able to place our food orders I asked if she knew when my drink would be ready and she said \\" oh right. What did you want again?\\" So she clearly had never put it in.  When I did final get my drink it had almost no alcohol. If I'm paying for a $8 drink it better have a decent amount of alcohol in it otherwise what's the point? Another thirty -forty minutes later we get our food. Four of the people I am with were doing endless wing night, and they all agreed their wings sucked and were much smaller than the last time they had had them. They had freezer burn on them but were hard and disappointing. Another friend got an $8 plate of wings and after eating just half of one she couldn't stomach the rest. Our waitress completely avoided our table to the point where I was stacking all of our dirty plates and other waitresses were coming by to get them. We never got water refills, and every time we would search for our waitress she would be at the table across from us talking to the guys at that table. Because the wings were so bad  and not filling at all someone in my party ordered a burger. He ordered it medium but when it came out it was black and burnt to a crisp. Sides of ranch were never brought over to our table, and when we were finally given silverware ( over an hour into sitting there) it was disgustingly dirty. A pipe above us was leaking so every five minutes we would get dripped on by god knows what. Our visit to hooters should have been 1  1/2 hours tops, Not 3. My friend who had bought eve $8 wings asked if she could have a to go box for them and the waitress quickly said \\" we don't do that for endless wings\\" and took her plate away, but my friend didn't have endless wings. She had normal wings from the menu? But the end we were all so fed up with our service and the quality of our food that we called over a manager. The only reason I'm even giving hooters one star is because the manager listened to what we had to say and gave us  1/2 off our bill. Needless to say none of us will ever be going back to hooters.  It was overpriced for freezer burned small portions and very shitty drinks. \\n*also after talking to my friends three people went home and were sick after eating here.

I don't live in the West End, but come downtown regularly, and have eaten at just about every place on Davie Street. I wish there was a better option for pasta in the ghetto. I've probably gone to Luxy ten times, and each time I'm disappointed, but I come back because I love pasta and continue to give this place yet another chance. Call me crazy. \\n\\nI ordered the special, which was penne with okra, mushrooms and chicken in a tomato sauce, at a one-third discount from the normal menu prices. Okra seemed like an oddity, and the waiter suggested subbing broccoli for the okra, which sounded like a good idea. I liked the idea of saving a bit of money, too, as I can't help feeling ripped off when I order pasta at a restaurant. All the pastas at Luxy come with garlic toast and caesar salad, and the servings are enormous. At the regular price of sixteen dollars a plate, I was expecting at least a decent plate of pasta. Unfortunately, quantity doesn't make up for quality.\\n\\nMy garlic toast arrived at the same time as the salad, and was cold by the time my pasta arrived. Bland white toast covered in garlicky butter flecked with (dried?) parsley. The romaine in my tiny caesar was dry and bitter, covered in too much overly salty dressing and horrible packaged Kraft powdered Parmesan-type cheese.\\n\\nMy penne was a disappointment that I couldn't finish, not because there was too much of it, but because it wasn't very appetizing. The sauce was incredibly acidic, so much so that my eyelids were sweating, which made me wonder if they really do make it from scratch. Just pure acidic tomato with no complexity and no sweetness. Nice-sized slices of chicken, but which tasted like it was boiled, with no flavor to speak of. A few mushrooms and bits of crunchy broccoli and that's all she wrote. When I asked for cheese a shaker of the aforementioned offending powder arrived. For a restaurant that specializes in pasta to serve that packaged cheese product is unacceptable. My advice to Luxy: go to Bosa, get some blocks of Reggiano and some rotary graters for your servers.  Using proper cheese will improve both your salads and pastas immeasurably.\\n\\nI will say that I've never had a problem with the service here, and this night my server was particularly accommodating and sweet, despite my dissatisfaction with my food. He offered me a free tiramisu, which did improve my rather bruised mood by that point. From his apologetic manner I got the feeling the staff kind of know that their food isn't that great. \\n\\nI must be a sucker for punishment, and I'll probably return to Caf√© Luxy next time someone suggests it or I'm craving pasta while stranded on Davie. They would immediately be replaced in my books if another much-needed pasta place appeared on the street. Until then, I have two words for the owners: Parmigiano-Reggiano."},{"name":"Boston Pizza","address":"808 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Awful customer service.

They were pretty good, nothing special about the ubiquitous sauce (spicy mayo).    \\n\\nMain Event 1:  Breakfast Burger (1/2 lb. patty, cheddar cheese, smoked bacon, fried egg, homemade salsa, onions).  It was very good, loved the bun - it's on the sweet side and they grill / toast it.  Disliked the lettuce (it's the cheap shredded kind out of a plastic bag - yuck!).  \\n\\nMain Event 2:  Shlee Burger (1/2lb patty, jack cheese, caramelized onions, avocado slices, lettuce, tomato, onion).  It was good, not great, but good.  \\n\\nDessert:  Homemade Ice Cream Sandwich (Two chocolate chip cookies with Amy's Mexican Vanilla Ice Cream).  How could you go wrong with this combo?  It came to us warm, a healthy portion, but one of the cookies was another flavor (not chocolate chip) and they also ran out of the other dessert options (brownie + ice cream).\\n\\nService:  This is where they drop from 4 to 3.5 stars - - our waiter was nice, and quick w/ the order taking, but gone for long periods of time and tapered off towards the end of our meal.  We had no silverware, had to ask for napkins, and at the end waited too long for water refills.  He wasn't lazy, just got busy and didn't keep up the pace.  Side note:  their billboard reads:  \\"Now hiring experienced waitstaff\\" - - just in case anyone needs a job, they're looking for ya - - maybe you can help get them back to 4 stars? \\n\\nAfter the calculations it looks like we saved about $2 with the ARW Menu - - that's a free load of laundry.  Overall, this experience was good but not over-the-top or mind-blowing.  If they stepped up their customer service and got better lettuce (lol!) then I would likely be here more often.

The vegetables were good as well. I also had hunan chicken. It prob was the most bland I have ever had. I also asked for xtra spicy.......................... yea so that didn't work out.

Without her [indirect] suggestion, one would've missed out on the best Lobster Roll in all of Beantown!\\n\\nLink to Leighann's Profile (like we need it):  http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=hBicl52tMVsTecdZSVL-lQ\\n\\nEvery city has a \\"best\\".  Whether it is a sports team, steakhouse, neighborhood, cocktail lounge, or gelateria, one stands above the rest.  Seeking the most delicious and flavorful Lobster Roll, I was directed to Neptune Oyster by Lady Leighann.  Luckily, Leighann's suggestion did not only deliver, it exceeded any and all expectations\\n\\nThe Decor...  Two words, \\"Dark\\" & \\"Marble\\"!  Upon first entry, patrons will discover the uptempo vibe of this establishment to be both homey and relaxing.  The lively, upbeat atmosphere of the restaurant suggests a low key, good food establishment that's meant for patrons looking to converse at unabridged decibels.  Although the restaurant itself is petite in nature and somewhat cramped, the ultimate feel of the establishment is that you're here for the food and the conversation.  Don't expect high end white table cloth service at Neptune Oyster, here, it's all about the food.\\n\\nThe Food...\\n\\nEast Coast Oysters:  Buttery to the touch, clean to the taste!  The natural sweetness of the East Coast Oysters protruded during consumption.  Although hearty and slightly bitter notes were detected, the overall impression of the Oysters was derived from its complexity and sweetness.  A slight application of lemon juice provided the welcoming acidity, which helped to insinuate the Oyster's delicate texture and bold flavor.\\n\\nCherrystone Clams: Scrumptious & Meaty are two terms that immediately come to mind.  At first taste, patrons will find that the delectable musky flavors from the Cherrystones are complemented well by the superbly clean finish.  Topped with cocktail sauce, the cherrystones provide a slightly bold bitter flavor that's enhanced by the mild tart / tanginess of the condiment.  Perhaps the most acclaimed remark that can be rendered to the Cherrystones is the textural contrast derived during consumption.  Boasting a buttery smooth outer texture, which alleviates to a meaty center, the Cherrystone clams provide an accompaniment of varied consistency.\\n\\nCold Lobster Roll w/ Boston Lettuce Salad:  The visual appeal can be summed up with the 5,000 character constraints of this review.  Of course, I'll leave the visual aspect to the picture taken of this roll.  As for the taste, at initial consumption, patrons will find that the excessive (and somewhat insurmountable) portions of Lobster meat applied in the compilation to be both welcoming and humbling.  Each individual bite revealed a progressive quantity of scrumptious lobster meat.  As for the flavor, the perfect balance of mayo to crab meat provided both a slight tartness which helped with amplifying the natural sweetness of the lobster.  Furthermore, the perfectly cooked texture of the lobster meat helped with escalating the crustacean's natural delightful flavor.  Lastly, the substitution of French Fries with the Boston Lettuce Salad provided the welcoming flavor contrast of acidity, earthiness, and slight nuttiness to the application.  Overall, the Lobster Roll was superbly executed with no technical or presentation flaws present.\\n\\nHot Lobster Roll w/ French Fries: Similar in presentation to the Cold Lobster Roll, two significant differences are noted...  The first being the roll was hot.  The second...  Mayo was substituted with warm unsalted butter.  Initial observations of the roll revealed that the heated application helped to elevate the natural sweet scrumptiousness of the Lobster.  The application of the unsalted butter in lieu of mayo helped with the magnification of the lobster's juicy consistency.  Further consumption of the warm lobster roll will provide both a mild detection of saltiness and peppery kick, which helps with enriching the delicate properties of the lobster.  The side of French Fries accompanying this application provided a welcoming crunchy textural contrast and mild starch profile to this dish.\\n\\n35 minutes later and the best meal ever consumed in Boston was complete.  Despite the wait time being 45 minutes to an hour, having a chance to sample Boston's Best Lobster roll was indeed worth the wait.\\n\\nNeedless to say, this is the first restaurant I am hitting up when returning to Beantown!\\n\\nNotes on Neptune Oyster:\\n- Wait times can vary from 30 to 90 minutes\\n- Seating is cramped, suggest leaving large baggage behind\\n- Although the lobster rolls were pricey ($25 each), it's best to get two and share both the Hot & Cold.\\n- Get anything other than the Lobster Rolls and you're doing yourself a disservice"},{"name":"Wai Wai Restaurant","address":"26 Oxford St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Wai Wai is not so much a hole in the wall sort of place, it's more a hole in the ground sort of place.

The kids loved the fountain and pond by the front. Food was standard Asian buffet fare. There was also a chef in back preparing special to order dishes. We just had the buffet, so did not try that. I would go again, maybe sit at a different booth. I would recommend them for a fast lunch or dinner with lots of choices.

They serve drinks out of big pickling jars.  They play good music.  There's no negative space in the restaurant whatsoever, and if you sit at the bar in the dining room, you get to watch all the food being made.  You can get hushpuppies, a bbq pulled pork sandwich with a plate of potato salad and beans, and pecan pie for under $20, all at an awesome and engaging location.

The lettuce, dressing, cheese and croutons were great but my chicken was slightly raw. Chicken isn't suppose to be pink. They obviously didn't temp it before sending it out. Our waitress was very helpful. The manager had me fill out an accident report just in case I got sick, which I did today. The manager didn't seem to care about what happened and she wasn't aware about health codes. The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because of how friendly and courteous our waitress was.

I ordered a combo salad to start and  a small beef soup.  My friend ordered a shrimp and veg dish which she seemed to enjoy.  All dishes were brought within (it seemed) two minutes, crowding the table and even though the place was not packed, we felt rushed.\\n\\nThe salad was crunchy and good -- I would have liked more time to enjoy it without worrying about my soup getting cold.  The beef soup came in regular size ( I had ordered small) which is way too much for me and I hate to waste food.  It was almost devoid of vegetables and had large pieces of tripe (or beef tendon?) which were unchewable and upon which I nearly choked.  The broth was bland and the bean sprouts on the side dish (the garnish we all look forward to) were slightly slimy and off-flavor. The rice noodles were in a clump and essentially impossible to eat.\\n\\nI understand that this restaurant has a terrific location and good prices, but I will not be making another visit there, as the quality of the food has been worse every time."},{"name":"Com Vietnamese Grill Restaurant","address":"4005 Buford Hwy NE, Ste E","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"My husband and I are C'om regulars. What's not to love about this place? Every single ingredient tastes unbelievably fresh. We always order the special c'om, which is - you guessed it - their specialty. It's a fantastic display of vietnamese cuisine: white rice rests beneath teriyaki-marinated beef (or any other protein of your choosing), fresh sliced cucumbers, shrimp meatloaf,  shredded carrots, a fried egg and other tasty treats. Pour some fish sauce over the whole thing, mix it all up, and you've got yourself a flavorful and hugely filling dinner. \\n\\nWe went last week with my foodie best friend from NYC, who ordered b√°nh hoi, her regular Vietnamese choice. The dish consists of flattened rice vermicelli noodles that you place on pieces of lettuce and layer with fresh herbs, beef and the same fresh vegetables in the special c'om. Basically, they're Vietnamese lettuce wraps.  She said it was the best b√°nh hoi she'd ever had - and that means a lot coming from someone who believes the best of everything is in NYC. For dinner, C'om throws in complimentary dessert and it's actually good. The dessert is the right size, consisting of a small piece of mocha cake for each patron and a scoop of ice cream - usually coffee or mocha flavored. It's the perfect way to end the meal and annihilate post-dinner sweet tooth.\\n\\nThe food isn't the only thing that's near perfect at C'om. We have never had bad service there, no matter who our waiter was. They're friendly, attentive and quick to bring out orders.

And the thing is they don't care to improve it since the business is doing very well and they always get ton of students come in. \\n\\nOnce, had to wait 50 mins for food and even then they botched it up completely. The Manager is the worst. Served naan while waiting for the dish. By the time dishes came, naan was cold and when asked to replace, the manager frowned. The manager or may be owner, the gray hair guy. \\n\\nSecond, Ordered a combo meal for pickup. Came home to find one item missing. When called to inquire, the manager guy picked up and said we don't offer that item for the UT campus location...when the menu clearly lists that item as part of the combo. Didn't bother to argue further as it was late. It's shameful that an Indian business could be worse in customer service compared to some shady Chinese restaurants. \\n\\nIf you can tolerate and go past the terrible customer service, then you would enjoy the food.

My churrasco steak was moist and delicious, but the meat was too chewy. Meanwhile my husband's bistec encebollado was dry and lacked flavor. I loved the rice mixed with sausage and beans. And the fried cheese with guava was delicious. But the yucca app was bland. And they forget the pastel altogether. I wish they had more fresh fruit juices on the menu (most were not natural). The music was lovely but the ambiance was a little dingy. The flan is rich and creamy. Lastly, although they had high chairs and were welcoming to the little ones,  I was disappointed that the bathrooms had no changing stations."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Overall great experience! Arrived at Neptune on a Thursday evening (October 29) at 5 pm expecting to wait. Took about 15 minutes before anyone took our names. We were seated within 20 minutes. There is a bar across the street to grab a drink at while waiting. Had several oysters (good descriptions of each on the menu), fried clams, and split a lobster roll. Food was as good as expected! Felt slightly rushed just because it's a small place."},{"name":"Happy Lamb Hot Pot","address":"4755 Kingsway, Ste 200","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3","text":"I have always been a huge hot pot fan but convincing my not so (food) adventurous other half to have hot pot is another story.\\nHowever, we managed to convince him to come tonight and even managed to find a deal on Groupon. If you are looking to check out this place it's a pretty good deal. We had the Little Sheep Deluxe Combo for 4 for $90. It was a good selection of food for the price. We figured if it wasn't enough food we could always order more. They also have an AYCE option as well as al a carte. The best part of this place is that they are vegetarian friendly which can be a challenge at hot pot places. Often times you are stuck cooking with just boiling water as your vegetarian option. The meat eaters enjoyed the spicy original broth. Mine was mushroom broth, and although I am not a fan of mushrooms I must admit the broth was tasty. We left happy and stuffed and did not have to order any extra food like we thought we would. The only disappointment were the sauces. For myself and my husband we found the sauces lacked flavour and selection but our friends enjoyed them. Service was also good as our server was friendly and even refilled our drinks without having us ask. Lastly as I write this review and referred back to our combo special I realized she forgot our lychee goji berry pudding :("},{"name":"Grasshopper Cafe","address":"229 Bunker Hill St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The best breakfast spot in Charlestown.

Flour has many healthy and convenient options available for you to grab and bring back to the office, though there's a bit of seating at shareable tables and bars.

I felt pleasantly full at the time, but got hungry again after a few hours.

Watch out for long lines, but at least they make your food reasonably quickly!\\n\\nI thought the space was extremely crowded, even though this is apparently the largest location.

I showed up at 5:20 and was told by a very rude waitress that you were closed. I explained to her that I had made a reservation and that my entire party was on their way.

I was a regular here while a student at UT, but after moving away for a few years and then moving back, I took my girlfriend here bragging about how she should expect the best Mexican food she's ever had, and while it wasn't BAD per se, it wasn't even close to what it was 8 years ago.  \\n\\nFirst, the margaritas used to be the best in town, with fresh fruit pulp accenting every sip.  But my girlfriend's strawberry margarita had much more of an artificial syrup vibe (seriously, where can you find a good margarita anymore?).  And while my chili relleno was alright, the beans were surprisingly dull, and to my memory the beans used to be so good that every bite would beg the question of why anyone would ever eat anywhere else.  \\n\\nAgain, the food isn't literally bad, but the effort just isn't there anymore.
