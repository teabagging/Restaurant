This place is a must-visit when in Portland, even if it is your one splurge meal as it was for us. I've always been a fan of Peruvian food, having fallen in love with the country and its people after many visits over the years. Andina, however, keeps Peruvian food interesting even for seasoned lovers. Their menu is a combination of traditional dishes and modern twists, with flavors from Spain and other South American countries. Our waiter was extremely helpful in offering a brief overview of the menu, which can be overwhelming because of the numerous options. It's been a while since I've wanted almost everything on a restaurant menu, and it was an exciting feeling! The things I tried on their menu were: yuca frita, chicharrones de langostinos, causa morada, anticucho de coraz√≥n, and seco a la norte√±a. ALL amazing! \\nYuca frita should be familiar sounding even for those who know no Spanish- it's fried yuca (which comes with a delicious green salsa). Would recommend for those who like convincing themselves that they're eating the high-fiber version of French fries. Pretty sure these are actually healthier, though. Chicharrones de langostinos are quinoa-studded prawns, and I made myself like them even more by repeating to myself that I was eating quinoa instead of breadcrumbs. These come with a light sweet and sour sauce. Causa rellena is a traditional Peruvian dish of filled potato- the chicken version we ordered came with layers of Peruvian purple potato. It had a delectable lime flavor and just the right amount of creaminess. Without a doubt, the most adventurous dish I tried that night was anticucho de coraz√≥n- marinated beef heart kebobs. When I first saw this dish on the menu, I thought it was beef chunks shaped into hearts. It was only right before we ordered that I realized we'd be eating beef HEARTS- yes, the organ. I usually can't dissociate myself enough to enjoy eating internal organs, but the beef heart did not taste like animal insides and was made even more scrumptious by the spicy salsa that came with it. Would highly recommend trying this dish, if only to say that you've eaten the heart of a cow. It seemed like the most popular entr√©e was the seco a la norte√±a (lamb shank) because we saw many plates going to other diners, and this dish did not disappoint. The lamb gets more tender as you work your way inside, and it comes with rice and beans. \\nBecause it was a splurge night, we ordered the canutos de quinoa y maracuy√° for dessert- such a great decision! You get two quinoa-studded cannolis (I don't recall that Peruvians love bejeweling their food with quinoa, but regardless I'm a fan of the prominent place of quinoa-studded dishes at Andina) filled with passionfruit mousse, as well as a scoop of mango-lemon sorbet. This cannoli is pretty different from your standard Italian cannoli- definitely on the lighter side, which I loved. I guess I'm a bit biased since I will eat anything with maracuy√°. Andina has my full approval, and if I ever visit Portland again, it would be one of the first places I hit up."},{"name":"Milestones Restaurants","address":"1145 Robson St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Too bad this place closed down.

Especially the radiatore, anchovy, chili & broccoli ($23 CAD), which is a nice radiator-like pasta with crunchy bits of anchovy that are totally in perfect balance with the stellar broccoli (which seemed more like broccolini, which I prefer) and a wonderful spice kick (5 stars). My co-eater and I shared the tuna crudo, stracciatella & the pickled mushroom app ($14 CAD), which was small but delicious (5 stars)--a great few pieces of fresh tuna with some lovely fresh cheese and delicately pickled little mushrooms. We also shared the meatballs (3 for $15 CAD), which were good but nothing special (3.5 stars). My co-eater's main dish was the fregola sarda, braised fennel & mussels ($24 CAD), which was a fresh spaghetti-like pasta with seafoody stuff on it. I did actually try a little despite not being a big seafood fan beyond simple things like salmon and flounder, but I can't tell if you'd like it. My friend liked hers well enough and ate it all, but noted that the tuna app was the best part of the meal, so maybe give her main a 3.5-4 stars? Aside from a few glasses of wine and some weird orange drink in a bottle, we also got the panna cotta for dessert ($7 CAD). It was very well made--a very mild but high quality chunk of Italian flan decorated with what looked like a homemade cherries in juice thing. The syrup wasn't overly sweet, but for whatever reason, I didn't want to eat the cherries. But, the dessert was good overall, though I would mention that if you're going for the gold in the sweets department, this dish won't deliver. \\n\\nBottom line: Excellent food (mostly) and worth a stop if you have time and don't mind an imperfect neighborhood or ambiance. In fact, next time I'm in Vancouver, I'd venture back even though my pattern is to often try new places. That says something, no? Yes, yes it does."},{"name":"Sushi Me","address":"3655 SW Hall Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"For me, it was fairly tasteless fish and rather warm, which made me worry.

I mention the time as I think brunch at a brunch place on a Saturday morning at 11 is probably the busiest time to visit. This fact definitely colored my experience.\\n\\nThe way The Paramount works is that you stand in line to order your food, pay, and then you can sit down. It's not a system that I necessarily mind but the place is so small and the line was so long that invariably we were all jostled around for the 40 minutes we waited to complete the transaction. In addition, there were restaurant employees pushing big carts of dishes through the same line so it was uncomfortable to say the least. It's not the employees' fault; it's the terrible layout of the restaurant.\\n\\nHowever, most of the food was very good once we sat down to eat. My father-in-law's blueberry pancakes were fantastic, as was my bacon, blue cheese and spinach omelet. The home fries and toast were both tasteless. The Paramount serves Rao's coffee, which is a nice touch.\\n\\nI only visited The Paramount as I had plans on Beacon Hill.

The hostess took our cell phone number so that she could call us when a table opened up. I put my phone on vibrate as I didn't think I could hear it over the noise of the patrons and the live music. There really is no waiting area. The door opens onto a balcony and you either go left to the restaurant (if you have reservations) or you go right to the bar (if you want to try your luck). There are two separate hostess stations. People lined the balcony as they waited, listening to a trio of musicians playing in the hallway. Women would shake their body as they walked past them on the way to the restroom.\\n\\nLuckily, our wait wasn't too long and we were seated at a table by the window in the bar area. The bar was packed and so were all the tables around it. To my right, at a corner table, two girlfriends with shopping bags piled all around them were sharing a large chocolate dessert and to my left a couple (she in a short skirt, he in a suit) spent almost the entire meal in silence.\\n\\nWe started with the cebiche de pescado 5 elementos. I thought the five elements would be five types of fish, but I think it referred to the number of ingredients in the dish (lime, salt, onions, cilantro and the fish itself). So, I expected something more elaborate that what came to our table, which was a basic, simple ceviche.\\n\\nWe continued with the anticucho de pulpo, a grilled octopus kebob that was, unfortunately, very rubbery and almost inedible.\\n\\nWe shared the soup of the day (shitake mushrooms) that restored our faith in the restaurant. It was very rich and would have made a great sauce for a steak it was so thick and mushroom-y.\\n\\nFinally, the entree was a seco a la nortena, or lamb shank cooked in the Northern Peruvian style, served with a bean puree. This was quite good.\\n\\nWe completed the meal with a trio of creme brulee pots we couldn't finish, despite our really wanting to.\\n\\nNow, to what makes this a four star place rather than a three star.\\n\\nI had two drinks that night:\\n\\nFuerte De Tamarindo, a whisky / tamarind nectar concoction, with orange / lime slices served in a glass with a tamarind sugar rim.

For dinner, the Seafood medley which was supposed to come served on pasta with a white wine and herb sauce.  the chef must have forgotten the 'wine and herb' because it was served in a plain buttery cream sauce.  that was both strange and disappointing.  the silver lining here was the heaping mound of seafood, mussels, scallops, shrimp and half of a lobster tail.  i guess that made up for the cream sauce because i tore into it like a wild animal, leaving the pasta to its own devices.  i made a vain attempt at the dessert, because, well it was included, but i couldn't get more than a few bites of warm apple cobbler (fresh apples not canned - woo hoo!) before waving my napkin in surrender. \\n\\ni gave the Oyster House three stars for atmosphere and because the food was average, not exceptional.  but i recommend it because of it's singular charm and the half moon bar in the entry where you can plop down, tease Sean and slurp oysters. mmm..."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I came to Portland to see what the hype of these doughnuts were all about, but I didn't see what was so special besides the cereal and bacon toppings.

I am not to big in my britches to admit when I am wrong. And Y'all... I was DEAD wrong on this one. We quite literally devoured the pizza..in the car...and pondered why and how the first visit could have possible been a miss...my husband deduced it was probably because we took the slices home and reheated them...DING, DING!! Yeah....having a freshly made, hot and crispy, chewy slice made all the difference in the world. The plain slice - perfect...tangy sauce, melty cheese...the crust..the CRUST! On the white, the ricotta was perfectly dollops on top of garlicky spinach.  The cheesecake was fluffy and tasty...very surprised at the quality - I think there was some lemon in it?

A definite must for anyone who is serious about food and cooking.  You cannot have a bad dish at Lenoir.  The food is fresh and so creatively inventive in its pairings -- it beats all other Austin restaurants (and there's some stiff competition here) and many beyond.  For example, the caviar and miso flan currently on the menu comes served with seaweed and small oysters, and looks like a mini aquamarine environment rather than a carefully crafted dish.  It was the most inventive thing I've ever eaten in Austin, and delicious, too.  The quinoa carbonara was divine -- I could have had 6 plates of just that.  Despite the small space, the decor results in an airy feeling and minimum noise, and you don't feel like you're sitting on top of anyone.  The bar is our favorite spot since you get great service and are able to talk at greater length about the food with your server.  All staff are gracious and not overbearing in knowledge or time spent with you.  We were even lucky enough to have a chat with Todd, owner and chef, who served us.

She was very nice and aimed to please all of her tables she was waiting on. While sitting there, I sat and watched the cook in back area. I saw the waitresses try to tell the cook their orders several times and he would be rude and shut them down. They were VERY short staffed with only 4 people working while we were there. I ordered the All Star breakfast which came with hash browns, bacon, eggs (I like mine scrambled), toast and waffle. I ordered our toddler a kid's waffle and bacon and my husband ordered the Texas cheese steak with no onions and his bacon on the side with chunks and cheese over his hash browns. It took forever for the food to come out which was understandable being that they were short staffed with only 1 cook. Luckily Alicia asked if we wanted her to bring out our toddler's waffle first so he could go ahead and eat, which was a great idea. When our food came out, my hash browns were burnt. The bacon was burnt to a crisp!!  They put all of our bacon on one plate. Alicia even thought the food was unpresentable and before I could ask her to send my food back, she said she was going to send it back to be remade right. My scrambled eggs were over so brown on the outside and in the inside, they were so gooey. It was like the cook made me an omelette that was raw in the middle. The waffle looked good. As Alicia took my food over to the cook, I could tell he was upset that she brought it back. He saw that I was eyeballing him so he fixed his demeanor but he was still talking trash. At that point, I told Alicia to cancel my order off the ticket and just charge us for my husband's and toddler's food and drinks. I didn't want him to cook me anything with an attitude like that! I wish I would have taken a picture of the plate before it was taken away. When Alicia brought out the new bacon for my husband and toddler, it was not done. She said \\"it's medium\\". I've never ever heard of bacon being cooked \\"medium\\". I've always eaten my bacon completely done. She took it back to be put back on the grill and when it came back out, it still wasn't done. My husband ate 1/2 a piece and gave our toddler the other 1/2. That's all that was salvageable. I asked for the cook's name because I had grown so frustrated with him by the time we left. The last straw was he took his phone from his shirt pocket with the gloves he wore to cook customers food and then continued to touch food while having a 10 minute conversation. Talk about cross contamination!!! I snapped a picture of him. I also snapped a picture of how filthy it was behind the counter. The floor was a complete mess and the trash can was overflowing.

I added corn to mine, which I thought was going to be baby corn because that's often used in ramen, but it was kernel corn. I ordered the Sprouting Up Ramen bowl and made it \\"spicy\\" but it wasn't too spicy. The brussel sprouts are AMAZING. I don't know how they do it, but the brussel sprouts made the soup just ten times better... The pork was so tender. My only slightest complaint was that the soup was a bit salty for my taste. My friend got the same thing but she really enjoyed hers. I would definitely return to try other options. I also got the salad + pork gyoza. The salad came with a house dressing which is not your typical Japanese ginger salad dressing. It's a soy and ginger based. It was definitely different. I don't think it's my preferred salad dressing, and being soy/ginger based i'm not sure a lot of people would like it. However, the waiter did warn me that it was different, and I'm usually up for trying anything. The pork gyoza was pan fried and it was sooooo delicious.

I appreciate that the pork is probably very high quality, and it was very juicy, but without the sauce, it had no flavor. It was more like roasted pork butt. It was also served much closer to room temperature than I usually like. I ordered the kale only because I am trying to get magnesium in my diet, and it was okay but not full of flavor. I liked the beans - they are more subtle than most, and they  may have been firmer than most people prefer. I believe the bread is house made, but it would have been better toasted.

Everything was excellent but I have to give a shout out to the collards and tomato pie being among the best I've ever had and the souffle being one of my new favorites.

It is the most important meal of the day you know...\\n\\nI do like breakfast and eat a nice balanced one every morning that I make in my kitchen. Did I mention I'm a good cook? But every now and then I yearn to go out to a real breakfast place - not a restaurant with a few breakfast sides. An honest-to-god breakfast place where the coffee keeps coming, the griddle stays sizzling and the smiles don't stop. So go to Waffle House.\\n\\nYes I know there's only two in Austin, neither one of which is super convenient but I'm not eating out every day so who cares. And IHOP? Listen, if you're from the South like me, you go to Waffle House. There's no point.\\n\\nI stopped at 8800 out on 290 East this morning. With SX in full swing, and a mid-morning stop for the All-American plate, there was exactly one seat at the counter available at 10am today, with 10-15 people milling around inside and out waiting for tables. I'm a counter guy though - I like to watch them work and enjoy the crowd. And talk about authentic? They cook the food six feet from you - I dig that: you can watch every move.\\n\\nThe food? Just what I wanted. Two eggs over easy, hash browns (loose), sausage, waffle and a side of wheat toast along with the bottomless black coffee for $10. That's a good deal folks. And the service? Kendra, who like all servers at this store seems to abound in patience and good humor, took good care of me despite the crowd and the rush and the two millennial prima donnas next to me who complained about the wait, the plate and the lateness of the order despite the fact that there was not an empty seat in the whole place. Kendra brushed it off, smiled and took good care of them.\\n\\nHow busy can this place get? This morning four line cooks never stopped as six servers kept calling out orders (Pull one bacon...) and two busboys did not get a minute to breathe. It was rocking.\\n\\nHere's what you get: good food, cooked right, served hot with plenty of attention. Here's what you don't get: silly decorations and aesthetics, goofy menus or attitude from your server. This mornings the plates lined up for serving (as the orders are called out the prep cook pulls each plate and dresses it lining them up in sequence so the other cooks know what each takes) was never less than ten feet long. And I never once say any of the cooks, servers or busboys raise their voice, snap at one and other, complain, begin to lose it or anything. Much like Gene Kranz in Apollo 13 they just continued to work the problem.\\n\\nYou want breakfast? You go to Waffle House.

I arrived right when they opened one day and we had to wait thirty minutes to get our order taken when we were the only ones there.

A counter with 3 cash registers and 2 spiraling display cases full of all unique creations was basically all there was. There was plenty to look at on the walls. I felt like I was in a doughnut themed Amoeba record store. \\n\\nThe cashiers are very friendly and surprisingly quite patient considering the line of anxious customers that is likely non-stop throughout their shifts. Prices of the doughnuts are not cheap considering they are doughnuts. The actual taste of the doughnuts was quite tasty and very fresh (almost too fresh because some of the chocolate frosting smeared on most of the other doughnuts) although the uniqueness of the doughnuts are merely cosmetic. Still you'll get a good chuckle out of some of their creations.\\n\\nAll things considered, as a tourist Voodoo Doughnuts was worth the visit. The price and the wait are some of the biggest deterrents to this Portland attraction. \\n\\n*Taste ~ 3.5 stars\\n*Value ~ 2 stars\\n*Novelty ~ 4 stars\\n*Customer Service ~ 4 stars"},{"name":"Bar 145","address":"955 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"It strikes me as somewhat odd that a server would charge one price for a round of drinks, and then have a bartender confirm our suspicion that the actual price is lower. \\n\\nUpon confirming this suspicion, the bartender said she would make sure the proper price is charged \\"the next time,\\" without offering to fix the situation at hand.\\n\\nAs if there will be a next time.\\n\\nCool story, kid.

I am not to concerned about what oil is in the fryer as long as its changed on a regular schedule. To get high marks in my book the \\"shell\\" of the old fashioned should have a crunch to the ridges then a solid inside the teeth can cut with ease without it breaking apart or so tight you have to pull. (Having any heat left from the fryer is an added bonus if found) \\n\\nThe marks above is my overall impression of the Old Fashioned's I had here, one glaze one chocolate.

Calvin is definitely not poor with the prices at this restaurant.  For my 1 glass of sangria, crispy beef entree and toasted cake dessert, I paid $48 pre-tip.  That's not a moderate restaurant.  And I feel robbed.  \\n\\nThe red sangria was the best part of my dining experience.  It wasn't as good as Spanish sangria and it was mostly ice but it wasn't overly sweet and the wine used didn't overpower the fruit.  \\n\\nMy entree was the crispy beef and at $22, I expected more than a half-cup of rice and a plate of well-cooked vegetables swimming in a very sweet hoisin (?) sauce.  I had maybe 5-6 beef tips in the dish, not enough by any means. And the pieces were very small, like the small pieces of meat you get at Panda Express.  I'd get a better plate of food at PF Chang's for almost half the price. \\n\\nMy friend ordered the fried chicken with lobster mac and cheese and collard greens.  Now that was a full plate of food!  And the chicken and greens were cooked perfectly. If you decided to visit Poor Calvin's order that.  Not the crispy beef.  \\n\\nMy $14 dessert was the toasted pound cake.  The server rattled off the ingredients but there were so many that all I got was pound cake and ice cream.  I wish I had listened.  The ice cream was a buttery, nut flavor that tasted fine but was drizzed in a bright lime green sauce that hardened.  It didn't have much flavor so I'm guessing it was just bright green sugar.  (Sometimes no garnish is better, guys.)  The cake was sugar-toasted and I wish I had understood this because I ended up scraping all that sugar off leaving me with a lot less cake.   The bananas were overly-sweet because of the sugar and caramel (?) glaze they were covered in.  The strawberries were fresh but had been placed on top of the sugar/caramel glaze and that took away from their flavor.  \\n\\nThis meal was expensive and depressing. I'll pay for good food (see my review of Marcel's.)

The evening of the dinner, Alana came out of the kitchen to introduce the course, explain the ingredients and where they came from, and how it meshed with the dinner.  Being a cook, my GF loved that.  Dinner took almost four hours.  Living in Europe has gotten me over the American eat-and-run dining method; I've learned to take my time over dinner and enjoy it.  This was worth every minute.\\n\\nAnd worth every penny.  Or, should I say, hundreds of dollars.  And it WAS hundreds of dollars.  But we talk about that dinner to this day.  A memory of an evening that's worth far more than the money.\\n\\nAnd beyond this, I've never had anything that was less than excellent here.  \\n\\nAnd for people that judge a meal by the money it costs: Alana's is actually cheaper than a lot of higher-priced, big-reputation, overrated restaurants around town (I'm thinking Lindey's here)."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Another hip restaurant from the folks that brought you One.Midtown.Kitchen, this place draws a seen and be-seen kind of crowd.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere is very sleek and urban, but the food fails to live up to expectation.

In fact, the only negative would be the slightly overcooked, rather dry chunks of chicken in my entree.  (I did make mention of the overdoneness of the chicken, in hopes that the kitchen would keep this in mind when preparing it for other diners.)

It's on my list of best doughnut places.\\n\\nSo two tips for eating here.\\n1) Their menu changes every day, so if you want something in particular you need to call ahead (24 hrs in advance).\\n2) There's usually a line out the door and around the corner, but don't worry, it moves quickly. From what I saw, this place fills up and clears out in a cycle of about a half hour. \\n3) MOST IMPORTANT: There isn't much space in the store to sit or read the menu. They ARE patient and do answer questions about what each doughnut is (we asked a bunch), but the faster you can order the better. The best option (keep in mind #1) is to look at the menu online and have a couple doughnuts that you want picked out. That way, you have some to order even if some aren't there that day. Better yet, just order one of each!\\n4) They have a little seating area shared by the neighboring business. My recommendation is to plan on sitting for a bit and grab some coffee to go with the doughnuts.\\n\\nDoughnuts We Bought:\\nCaptain My Captain - so yummy! My favorite of the bunch.\\nVoodoo Doll - really good, and gets my vote for easiest to share\\nPortland Cream - simple (in comparison), but delicious!\\nTriple Chocolate Penetration - chocolate overload, but oh-so-good\\nTangfastic - a bit disappointing actually. The one I got was a doughnut with vanilla frosting. Half of it had sprinkles of Tang and half had orange sprinkles. I wish there was more Tang.\\n\\nI'll definitely be going there again.

While the fries were gone in an instant, the hummus left a lot to be desired. It was edible at first bite, but a strong fishy aftertaste hit seconds later.\\n\\nAs for the Restaurant Week part of dinner, there were highlights... and there were lowlights. For my first course, I went with the corn nicoise salad. Bland salad featuring one lone anchovy drizzled with lemon basil vinaigrette didn't exactly bode well for the upcoming courses. Next up was the scallop ceviche, which again was a letdown, since it was lacking flavor in general. Thankfully, my main (grilled quail with raspberry mole sauce) and dessert (watermelon shaved ice) evened out the aforementioned two starters. The tender quail surprisingly paired well with the mole sauce, and the shaved ice served at the conclusion of dinner served more as an excellent palate refresher than cleanser.\\n\\nMy friends who ordered the trio of chilled soup shooters as starters and lamb as their entrees didn't fare so well. Two of the three soups were off in the sense that they were bland, and the lamb was served lukewarm with blueberry \\"chutney.\\" Calling the sauce chutney was an overstatement, imo. The rabbit, on the other hand, was phenomenal and marinated to the point where the grassy smell was eliminated while preserving its juiciness. The other dessert option -- corn creme brulee -- was a fabulously executed one too. I would have never thought that the words corn and creme brulee could be used side-by-side until I tried BCB's take on the classic dessert.\\n\\nFor some odd reason, BCB decided to offer dishes on the Restaurant Week menu that are not part of the regular menu. The actual menu might be more substantial but for now, BCB stands as a-okay in my book. Service was on the slow side, but with Happy Hour and Restaurant Week occurring alongside, it was understandable.

That's coming from someone who doesn't especially like fried chicken. It's very lightly fried so it's not terribly greasy and it's got some good spicing to it. Probably why I like it - it's certianly not your traditional fried chicken. The chicken is reasonably priced as well.\\n\\nStick with the chicken though.\\nEverything else on offer is either bad, overpriced, or both. The mac and cheese is fine, but overpriced. The slaw that came with my chicken was tasteless. The bread that came with it was just awful, soggy and kinda disgusting. The peppers were bad as well. The drinks are way overpriced, amazing how quickly the drinks added to the total.\\n\\nI didn't try the waffles, so no comment there."},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I really like their vegetarian and vegan dogs.

It's a fun atmosphere, and a great date. And, to top it off, amazing, mouth wateringly delicious, make you drool they're so good rice crispy treats. The reason I give a 4 star here instead of five is that this place is just too damn popular! As much as I love their pizza and adore the rice crispies, I just don't like having a 2+ hour wait for my food. Luckily Home Slice To-Go is right next door, so you can get your pizza fix in just 15 or 20 minutes instead of hours, as long as you don't mind enjoying it on the curb (which I don't, I'll enjoy pizza just about anywhere)."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"It is with a heavy heart that I write this long overdue review. Mary Mac's Team Room was one of the first restaurants I truly fell in love with when I moved to Atlanta, so it had a special place in my heart. However, I'll start with the good and end up with the bad.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the food. Its rich, homey, minimalistic Southern comfort food. Its not too salty, its not too greasy, its just the right amount of everything that makes their food stand out. If you've never been, you'll be asked, and as part of your \\"initiation\\" will be brought out a nice cup of pot liquor with one of their fresh corn muffins. For those that don't know, pot liquor is the broth that collard greens and boiled in and sopping it up with a corn muffin is the traditional Southern way to do it. You'll get all the muffins (and cinnamon rolls) you can stomach, but don't go overboard with it because you really need to save room for the food.\\n\\nNow for the bad...I can't ever in good conscience go back to Mary Mac's again, and it was one bad experience that ruined it for me. Every year as sort of a last night feast, my friends and I that have gathered at Dragoncon would go here and eat until we were nigh unto unconcious. This past year, we did our normal ritual of going and ordering the Southern Feast because really when you have 8 people to feed, the feast is just the most economically feasible way to do it here. We got to the restaurant around 6, waited about 20 mins. to be sat (they weren't incredibly busy that night) and immediately ordered. Then we waited...and we waited some more, and after an over 2 hour wait we still hadn't received our food, but were consistently reassured it was coming the entire time. The manager, who we asked to speak to refused to give us any sort of discount on our meal, so we just got up and walked out. The service was terrible and so was this guy.\\n\\nAll in all, that experience really soured it for me after having been so many times. If I'm not made to feel valued as a customer, what's the point of me continuing to put my money in a place? The food is good, but there are other great places for Southern food in Atlanta. Maybe if the management changes, I'll consider it, but being forced to find new, awesome places to eat is a challenge I'm enjoying."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"First off, the Pizza here is fantastic.  The price is reasonable and the atmosphere is great (very South Austin laid back)... it's unfortunate though that a place like home slice falls short on service.  Like a lot of hot restaurants in town they are very proud of their food and from my last experience, operate under the \\"we don't need your business\\" mindset.    I tried calling ahead to save a table when I had family come in from out of town who wanted to try something \\"Austin-y\\".  The gentleman that answered the phone seemed distracted and disinterested in talking to me. \\n\\n He did make sure to tell me there was no way to make any kind of reservation, even if we were coming from Pflugerville.. ok, fair enough.  Not all places let you hold tables ... then when I asked him what the wait was like (Friday Night... and I expected him to say it was busy, but sheesh what is the harm in asking, maybe we'd get lucky).  Well, I might as well have asked him if ice is made from water because he gave me a huge sigh and an answer along the lines of \\"really dude? Like you have to ask?... it'll be at least 45 minutes, sir\\" Ok... Like I said I was expecting that answer, but there's no need to be rude about it... what if my mother, who is 58 and lives in a tiny town in South Texas and hasn't heard all the rave reviews about Home slice or doesn't comprehend the trendiness of  \\"SOCO\\" had called in... she would have no clue that Friday nights are beyond packed there... point being, no reason to be rude or assume the customer knows anything about your establishment.  \\n\\nFinally, when he made a last ditch effort to get me off the phone by feigning an attempt to be helpful by asking \\"well, how many people do you have I'll see what I can do...\\" I told him that we'd have a party of about 13.. Now, I know that's a large group and that usually with a party that large you're better off at a larger establishment that can handle a group that size... but this is Austin! Land of amazing restaurants..my family doesn't want to roll in and eat at Chili's...they can get that at home.  Like I said earlier, I knew what the answer probably would be , but again... what's the harm in asking?  Turns out rolling in with a large group gets you another sigh from the host, and a declaration that our 45 minute wait time would increase to at least an hour and was there anything else he could do for me?  I told him no, and ended up taking the family to another good pizza joint in Austin, Mangia.

It is run by the same restaurant group that owns One Midtown Kitchen after all.  Spot on!\\n\\nTwo Urban Licks was a well deserved celebratory dinner after I moved into a new apartment.  My parents had come to town to assist as well as a very good friend, and we were finally done - the furniture had been moved, most everything had been unpacked, pictures had been hung, lots of trips to Target for odds and ends had been made, and a bottle of champagne had been opened.  It was time to relax and eat well.\\n\\nSo I made a last minute reservation at Two Urban Licks (literally an hour before we wanted to arrive), and they were able to accommodate my party of four no problem.  That was pleasant surprise number one. \\n\\nPleasant surprise number two occurred when we pulled up to what seemed to be an abandoned warehouse area in the Old Fourth Ward.  For an abandoned warehouse though, there were a lot of nice cars parked outside (Aston Martin included).  We'd arrived.  All the most desperately trendy and cutting edge restaurants are in the most unlikely, unassuming spots aren't they?\\n\\nUpon entering said dilapidated warehouse, a giant flower arrangement and glass wall of casks of wine greeted us.  We were then whisked around the giant bar / open kitchen in the center of the restaurant to one of the many table / booth seatings to one side.  We had an excellent view of the giant grill where they rotisseried and flame grilled many of the dishes.  Such a cool vibe.\\n\\nOur waitress greeted us promptly and told us how Two Urban Licks works: all the casks of wine we saw upon entering, the specials of the night, how the menu was laid out, etc and left us to get started browsing.  She was very knowledgeable about everything and very helpful throughout the night - great service.\\n\\nEven though we'd had some champagne prior to dinner, everyone was in need of more libations (trust me, moving could easily make you an alcoholic).  It was different red wines all around, and along with that came freshly baked ciabatta bread and vinegar and oil to dip it in.  Boy, that bread was HOT!  Beware of burning your fingertips at first.\\n\\nEverything on the menu sounded really good, but I finally ended up choosing the braised lamb with peas, broccoli rabe, swiss chard and mint pesto.  My mom ordered the seared tuna with edamame, cucumber, bok choy and a spicy sesame dressing.  Both my dad and friend ordered the bistro steak (the most popular entree on the menu) with whipped potatoes, roasted peppers and a corn chimichurri topping.  \\n\\nThroughout dinner we shared and traded plates so I got to try a bite of everything else and it was all excellent.  I was quite happy I'd chosen the lamb - it was fall off the bone tender and so tasty, but the tuna and steak were both very good too.  The tuna was a little spicy, but nothing you couldn't handle or ask to tone down a bit.  And the steak was cooked to medium perfection.\\n\\nAfter the main entrees were cleared, our waitress dropped off a dessert menu with the casual mention that the rum soaked raisin bread pudding was her personal favorite.  Sold!  Four spoons later we were all happily digging into a healthy-sized bread pudding with a large scoop of brown sugar ice cream with pecans on the side.  So decadent, so sweet, so good.  I could have probably eaten one on my own (definitely wouldn't have needed to, but I could have done it).\\n\\nAll in all, Two Urban Licks was fabulous.  It was so perfect for the occasion and just what everyone needed.  I look forward to going back to that dilapidated warehouse in the future."},{"name":"Alchemy Caf√©","address":"625 Parsons Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"So this juice bar has a great selection of juices sandwiches,  smoothies,  etc. Small, trendy, delicious.

Pass it by many times but there is virtually no parking so haven't been able to stop.  Finally drove by and had a spot.  That was the highlight of my visit.\\n\\nFirst off, the menu prices are quite high for a food trailer  with such a limited menu.  4 pieces $8, 8 pieces $12, and 12 pieces $22.  That is with a roll and no sides.  The side dishes kind of sounded interesting, but I really just wanted the chicken so I opted for the 12 piece to go.  I was warned that food is cooked to order so it takes a little longer, which I have no problem with, so I waited about 12 to 14 minutes thinking that my food would be fresh and awesome.\\n\\nDidn't unwrap anything there, just sped off home smelling the unusual (not bad, just not what you expect fried chicken to smell like, so that is good) scent of fried chicken, thinking I was in store for a fresh take on spices and breading!\\n\\nGot home and unwrapped - very disappointing!\\n\\nFirst, the size of the order given the cost shocked me.  The chicken pieces were tiny and only boneless breast pieces, thighs & drums.  The breast was cut into about 2-3 ounce pieces.  I could not believe it!\\n\\nSecond, and most importantly, I saw that the pieces of chicken had burnt (as in real black) edges.  Generally, this does not happen in a fryer!  One of two things happened  Either pre-cooked chicken was re-heated in a hot oven, or the chicken was soaked in buttermilk or milk and then overcooked in the fryer!  This was not the fresh preparation I was expecting!  I was furious at this!  The chicken was way dried out and absolutely no crispness.\\n\\nThirdly, I did not find the flavor and taste of the breading/seasoning to be anywhere near what I expected.  Very muddy mix of seasonings and not very bright or pop.  The seasoning was red and paprika/chile/cayenne based, again not what I expected.\\n\\nFourth, the rolls were cold yeast raised manufactured rolls like you would find in the bread aisle of a supermarket.\\n\\nSome context:  I was there at about 3:30 in the afternoon on a weekday.  There was absolutely no other customers there.  Also, I am not a fan of the Cajun style fried chicken seasoning like at Chick fil a, so if that's what the flavor profile was attempting, it may just be my taste.\\n\\nI'm don't think I will try this again.\\n\\nPS:  I took a photo but then went ahead and synced my phone which somehow deleted my pictures."},{"name":"Panda Buffet","address":"11940 SW Pacific Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"2","text":"My family and I just had dinner here on Tuesday at 5 pm and we were satisfied.

Soft drinks were included in the meal and the soft ice cream was cold and firm, enough to easily stack it four inches high, a lot better than what you can get at McDonald's and as good as other soft ice cream vendors with much higher prices.\\n\\nTo be objective on the down side management could clear the clutter from the cashier area, the first impression that you get upon entering. We thought that the people bussing tables were slow to clear them but when you keep prices as low as this restaurant does you can't afford to hire more employees. Also, the finishes were dated and worn but, once again, the owners would have to charge more to make improvements like these more often.\\n\\nDespite these shortcomings we enjoyed our meal. There were only about seven tables dining so it was actually quiet and peaceful, a lot different from the lunch time rush that other reviewers have described. If we expected a Jin Wah Beaverton experience then we most certainly were going to be disappointed. At $6.50 apiece Panda Buffet is a great value.

Living in Canada hasn't offered me much exposure to authentic food from the Southern United States. Cultural references to dishes such as fried green tomatoes made me wonder if they were as delicious as their name sounded; my own attempts at preparing cornbread left me yearning for an ideal to work towards. As such, my recent visit to Atlanta for a work-related meeting seemed like the perfect opportunity to sate my culinary curiosities.\\n\\nI started to research my dinner options after my Saturday sessions at the conference. I approached Steffone, an affable security officer at the Georgia World Congress Centre, to seek his recommendations. He offered a list of his preferred Southern restaurants, which included Mary Mac's Tea Room. I decided to give Mary Mac's a try.\\n\\nMy 2.8 km sojourn on foot from the conference centre to Mary Mac's whetted my appetite nicely for my feast to come. I was greeted at the front desk, and informed that a table for one would be available in 15 minutes. Opportunely, a table became ready after just several minutes of waiting.\\n\\nMary Mac's consists of separate dining rooms, each of which has its own unique atmosphere. Tastefully arranged photos of celebrity diners can be seen throughout the restaurant. My dining room's walls were pumpkin in colour, and lined with a white trim. Paintings depicting rural scenes were also part of the d√©cor, and lent an authentic touch.\\n\\nTameka, my server, swiftly made her way to my table to introduce herself. After I informed her that it was my first time in Georgia (and at Mary Mac's), she exclaimed, \\"I'm gonna spoil you tonight!\\"\\n\\n\\"Excellent,\\" I thought to myself.\\n\\nI decided that I couldn't let this traditional meal pass without iced tea (the \\"Table Wine of the South\\", proclaimed the menu). Tameka agreed with my selection, and promptly returned with a refreshing glass of the beverage.\\n\\nFirst time visitors to Mary Mac's are offered a complimentary serving of bread and \\"pot likker\\", a soup made from boiling greens. My bowl of pot likker was hot and savoury. One should crumble cornbread into the soup for optimal enjoyment.\\n\\nThe yeast rolls were warm and buttery. I appreciated the sweetness of the crisp-yet-crumbly cornbread. Although being served cinnamon buns prior to a main course seemed a bit odd at first, their sugary deliciousness made me forget about any initial hesitation.\\n\\nIn truth, I minimize my bread consumption on most days for health purposes. However, I'm willing to indulge on special occasions. In particular, I regret nothing about consuming more dry carbs during that evening than I would in a typical week.\\n\\nMary Mac's has a unique system in which a diner writes his or her order on a slip of paper. I later learned on the restaurant's website that this tradition was originally devised to prevent faulty orders, and to keep track of customer numbers. One should not misinterpret this as apathy on the part of the restaurant, as servers seem to only be pleased to offer their advice and opinions on the menu.\\n\\nI indicated on my order sheet that I wished to have fried chicken for my main course. I selected fried green tomatoes and fried okra for my two included sides, and asked for an additional bowl of cheese grits.\\n\\nTameka nodded approvingly as she looked over my order sheet, and took it to the kitchen.\\n\\nTameka arrived with my main course shortly afterward. The serving size was generous. I would venture to suggest that Mary Mac's has established my personal gold standard for fried chicken. The sound of my bites into the crispy skin was a treat for my ears. The meat was tender, flavourful, and succulent.\\nI found the combination of the okra's unique texture and their deep fried state to be interesting. The fried green tomatoes had a mild tartness that was quite enjoyable. The cheese grits were rich and creamy - I understand now how this dish is considered to be a comfort food.\\n\\nBy this point, I was nearly inebriated with satiety. But, abdominal distension be damned, I asked to look at the dessert options on the menu.\\n\\nTameka informed me that the peach cobbler and bread pudding were popular desserts. However, her personal favourite was the blueberry cobbler. I followed her recommendation, and ordered it a la mode.\\n\\nThe blueberry cobbler was a lovely conclusion to my meal. The dessert bowl was filled close to the brim, and initial dips of my spoon into the cobbler led to overflow of the syruppy blueberry filling onto the dish below. Perfection.\\n\\nThe total cost of my meal was just $24.61 - a fantastic cost/deliciousness ratio. Dining at Mary Mac's reminded me of listening to a well-composed melody - just as the notes of the Beatles' \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" and Elvis Presley's \\"Can't Help Falling in Love\\" flow so perfectly from one to another, so did each gustatory vignette that evening. My experience at Mary Mac's was excellent in all aspects, and I offer them my strongest endorsement."},{"name":"Folk Art Restaurant","address":"465 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This is easily a 5 star establishment and I could eat here everyday.

The decor is very kitschy and I love it! almost everything looks upcycled and repurposed, they even have some stadium seats you can sit in while you wait. Although there were 4 tables ahead of us, we only had to wait about 15 minutes so don't run from the line.\\n\\nThe seating for 2 people is not that great...

His interaction with us literally had me thinking in my head, stars are dropping like flies! (Is that terrible? hey at least I always walk in with a 5 star attitude!) I had some questions and he had 0 answers. I asked if i could sub a tomato for another vegetable and he says \\"um I don't think so.\\"-- well can you find out? I asked what his favorite things were and he said \\"I dont eat the majority of the food here.\\" No smile, No laugh, NOT JOKING.

The vibe and atmosphere made me think of chain noodle shops in China..and you better be ready for all the asians there! I came here with a friend at around 6PM on a Thursday, and it was already packed. The space is limited, and the place is extremely young and trendy. In the center there's almost a sushi-bar like setting, and surrounding that are closely packed diner-like seats. \\nAs for the food, it's not bad for a ramen place in sandy springs, but definitely can't compare to California or Asia counterparts. The broth is quite flavorful, which is a definite plus - as real ramen/noodle bowls value broth more than noodles, and the noodles are delightfully chew (not soggy). The amount of condiments provided is decent for the size of the ramen bowl, and true to its simplistic form characteristic of Japanese Ramen dishes - simple and rich. \\nThe takoyaki was extremely good btw! There are real pieces of octopus in there with surrounding batter fried to a deliciously golden crisp! \\n4 stars only because its a little on the pricey side for a handful of noodles and cup of broth (its more quality than quantity here), and I'm spoiled by cheap noodles that I've had elsewhere.\\n\\nTIP: savor the broth!"},{"name":"Via 313 Pizza - West 6th","address":"600 W 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"My wife and I had a date night.

The set up of the restaurant is weird when you arrive. No one at the door to greet you. Ok fine. Can you at least put a sign at the door? Please seat yourself? Or go to the bar? I spoke with the bartender she informed me to just pick a seat. I sat down and no one gave me a menu so I eventually walked to the bar. I ordered my meal. Vegan hash & gluten free pancakes. My review is only on the vegan food. It was the worst vegan restaurant food that I've eaten. The vegan hash was simply boiled potatoes with vegetables & no seasoning. How can this restaurant be in college park (with majority of black people living there)& not season their food? It was so bad I seriously asked if I could show the cook how to cook the potatoes. How can you fail a simple dish? The pancakes were not good and dry. No oil was on the pancakes either. Let's talk about the bill. This restaurant is playing a game with the menu. The price is listed for everything on the menu except for the vegan hash. So when I got the bill I flipped out for having to pay $8.99 for boiled potatoes. The manager was rude. Didn't want to give credit on my bill for this crappy food. Finally she took off those horrible hash browns(boiled potatoes) but I would never try to eat at this place again.

I've been to Burnt Fork 3 times--once to dine in for weekday lunch, and twice for takeout dinner on a Saturday night.  \\nThe atmosphere is a little lacking, but the food is amazing.  I've eaten at Community BBQ (not impressed), and Fox Bros BBQ (my favorite/tie with Burnt Fork).  Burnt Fork is different, though.  Here's their spin, and it might help explain the vegan/vegetarian options, as well as their tendency (I've read in the reviews) to run out of items: they serve many organic options, and their meat is locally sourced and humanely raised.  With small, local providers, there is going to be less consistency.  It has never been an issue for me, I am not a fan of ribs.  I like brisket, pulled pork, and chicken, and they do all of these superbly well.\\nTheir portions are on the small side, but again you are paying for QUALITY, not quantity.  This is not like Fox Bros where you are going to need to fast for days before and after, wear elastic-waist pants, or unbutton your pants after eating.  You will, however, get some really tasty, grass-fed beef brisket, and Berkshire pulled pork.  The collards and kale are delicious, the coleslaw perfectly not too sweet or mayonnaise-y, and their fries are organic and hand cut.  Their sweet potato chips are to die for. I LOVE their sauces--there are four to choose from so you will surely find one that suits you.  Ask the server for recommendations--I was steered towards a great combination of the vinegar sauce plus another one, and it made the perfect combination.\\nIf this kind of eating appeals to you, then go to Burnt Fork.  I personally care about the kind of meat I eat, even when I eat out, and don't want to feel uncomfortably full and as if my arteries are instantly clogged when I eat BBQ.   That's why Burnt Fork is my first choice for BBQ in Atlanta and Decatur."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"A little off the beaten path.

I recommend only going for dessert. Lunch and Dinner are not worth it. \\n\\nHowever, when I went there recently, the hostess wasn't friendly or welcoming at all. Once we were seated, the waiter informed us that there was a minimum amount that we needed to spend. I became a little upset because I had not realized this. I hadn't thought to check because there was no minimum the last two times I went. Both times were at night around dinner time. That was many years ago so things must have changed. It was not worth the price. \\n\\nI recommend going once to see the view of Boston at night but check their website. After I had to pay the minimum, I went online to check.

My mom has ordered a cake for my birthday from Susu almost every year! I love their cakes and they do a great job decorating however we ask them (I'm 21 by now so it hasnt been anything too elaborate we've asked for, just simple and cute and they've done it well). The reason I love their cakes is the BUTTERCREAM FROSTING! It's seriously the best I've ever had, anywhere, anytime, ever. I'm not a fan of the super sweet regular frosting and that has made me never be a big frosting fan. But Susu's buttercream has turned me completely around on frosting ever since I took my first bite. The actual cake part (I always get chocolate) isn't always spot-on. This year it wasnt as moist as it always is, but overall it was a great cake. If you're a buttercream guy or gal, get ur cake or cupcake from here! It's seriously amazing."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"A little more expensive per donut but I believe they were worth it.

During our dining experience, I was able to try a few dishes:\\n\\nChicken and Dumplings: very creamy, buttery, carbolicious.

It smelled great, but I'm sorry, I just can't handle liver unless it's a spread.\\n\\nFried Chicken: Light, crisp coating. Juicy insides. I loved seeing the steam rise after I tore off a piece of the chicken from the bone.\\n\\nFried Green Tomatoes: Very interesting, very tasty. I've never had green tomatoes, but I liked their firmness paired with the breading.\\n\\nFried Okra: I was slightly disappointed with these. I grew up eating okra in every shape and form, and I can honestly say that I've had better fried okra. They were a bit too greasy for me.\\n\\nSweet Potato Souffle: Oh man, this thing was SWEET. I thought it was a side dish!? Oh well, not going to complain because it was delicious. However, maybe they should consider moving this item to the desserts section?\\n\\nPot Likker: This was very savory, and bold in flavor. I really liked it. Then I found out it was basically leftover stuff from cooking other things...which made me love it. Hahaha, guess that's why it's so flavorful...all the flavors have basically been concentrated in this dish!\\n\\nPeach Cobbler: Great crust, it was rich and buttery. The peach filling was ooey and gooey and came out piping hot. Not as peachy as I thought it would have been though. I expected a peach explosion in my mouth, but all I got was a little bang.\\n\\n\\nOverall, this place is A-OK with me. I just wish I had other foods and places to compare it to.

The worst thing about Paramount is the wait. If you arrive hungry you'll be miserable because the average weekend wait is 30-45 minutes (I've waited upto 1 hr 15 minutes).  I always have to pregame brunch here with a bowl of cereal or a Twix but because the best thing here is the food it's always well worth the wait.  My go to: huevos rancheros done over easy, no frills.  This is everything you would expect from good old huevos rancheros.  If you're trying to satiate a sweet tooth the pancakes here are thick and fluffy with a high proportion of whatever you get mixed in; I recommend the banana chocolate chip pancakes.  The price is right and the portions are perfect.  More often than not, I walk away from brunch feeling a little ill because I ate too much, not exactly the way to start an ambitious weekend morning, but this never happens at Paramount.  For sides the fruit bowl and the sweet potato fries are both delicious, it just depends on what you're looking for!  The milkshakes here are great but a little on the expensive side so I usually stick with chocolate milk or bottomless coffee.  Honestly I don't think you can go wrong with anything here. Everything is fresh and looks delicious as the chefs prepare everything in front of you while you wait (which is tough to stomache, or not rather, when you're starving).  The other neat thing about Paramount is their seating policy: it's cafeteria style so you wait in line and you're not allowed to save seats.

Their beer selection was lacking, especially with the lack of cocktails. The selection was off the wall and the one beer I wanted, they were out of. If I wanted a crazy beer list, that would be my destination. My evening was to have a drink before dinner, then work my way into my meal with wine. Ah.... that might sound like not a big deal to you.

With that came fruit-nut bread and a delicious potato pancake which was surprisingly different from the ones I might make at Hanukkah time.  Though all of that was wonderful, the danish pancakes stole the show.  They had a pancake's flavor and a biscuit's texture, slightly larger than golf balls, lightly powdered sugared and accompanied by syrup, lingonberry jam, and a perfect lemon curd.  Pretty much a joy to eat.\\n\\nOther notables: Tall glass bottles of water on the table so you never run out and deliciously strong Stumptown coffees and espressos.

Well yelp, I'm here to break the news to you....all that glitters isn't gold. Just because it is the most popular venue, doesn't mean it has the best tasting food.  That was the case with Mary Mac's.  It is always busy...always!  The parking is very limited too..... On the weekends, forget about it!  Lines look like Six Flags!  Now ask yourself is it worth the wait for those long lines on the weekend? I say HELL NO!!  Pretty spacious dining though.  When you take your order, you write it down with a #2 Pencil on a piece of paper. Ummm ok alright... Had an Arnold Palmer and let's just say I can make a better batch.  I had the fried chicken (saw all the reviews for that) , side of mac and cheese and the greens.  All three was just blah...No flavor on any of them!  So I say to myself \\"who are writing these gassed up reviews?\\"  To be fair, the service and hospitality was spectacular!  That I will give them.  That was a strong  A++  Unfortunately the grub didn't equal out to the service...probably saved the review.  I guess if you are a tourist or local, it is something to get off your bucket list.

Prior to arriving I made a reservation at Abe and Louie's just in case we couldn't get in. Well fortunately that wasn't the case as we were seated after a brief ~10 minute wait, though not after being reminded multiple times of the $25 minimum - great, yeah, I get it...\\n\\nSo we're finally seated, but without a wine list. Have to wait another 10 minutes to see our waitress again. We put in an app order and look the wine list over; nothing is really jumping out at us (though they do have a decent selection). Ended up going for a better California Cab by the glass off the drink menu and got it with our apps. The good news was the lobster bisque was very good; bad news was the wine I ordered was from a bottle that was either a day or two old and already opened or was left out overnight. You could taste it - bland, stale, dry, nothing going on. \\n\\nTheir main menu is okay. From what I remember the selection left a bit to be desired - especially at their prices. I ended up opting for shrimp scampi, which was mediocre. Again, for the price and where this restaurant thinks they stand on the high end dining scene, it could've been much better. (I could have gotten the same dish for half the price at a take out place called Lilly's on Mission Hill - great pasta place by the way.) The lady friend ended up getting chicken pot pie which, I'll admit, wasn't bad as they had an interesting take on the dish. \\n\\nAnyway, the time comes for the check. I'm not one to study the check before paying so I just give her my card before she has a chance to leave the table. She gets back and I go to sign when I figure out something isn't adding up - we ended up getting double charged for an entree or a couple drinks or something, I forget, but it was substantial in relation to our two person bill. I flag the waitress and she reverses the charge and comes back with a new check and an apology. Mistakes happen, it's understandable, whatever. \\n\\nMy two star review reflects not that the restaurant is horrible (the food is mediocre-to-decent, at best), but because of the poor service and the fact that the expectations they have set are so high. And I really don't get it either. They have a phenomenal location that is so unique, how hard is to have great service and good food? So while the view is killer, if I want to spend that type of money I'm going to Abe and Louie's or AFC every single time. Same prices but the food and service are literally 10x better. Won't be coming back except for maybe drinks at the bar to enjoy the view."},{"name":"Waffle House","address":"8800 US-290","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"I think the place is okay if you ask me.

Walk past Katana, discuss eating here but never actually eating here...UNTIL TODAY.

For appetizers we got the bang bang shrimp and beef short ribs. Neither one of us was disappointed. Mouth watering and great flavor. For dinner we ordered the New York steak with extra vegetables ( no rice- bc we worked out, easy on the carbs). Was yummy as well. Then, me being the person I am, just casually asked what was on the dessert menu to the waiter. The moment he said tempura ice-cream I ordered it without thought. It was a reflex! My bf was not excited about my decision, so I asked the waiter for ONE SPOON only, and he obliged. Needless to say, I have zero regrets about my dessert decision and neither does my BF (who I reluctantly shared my dessert with) but I refused to accept another spoon....why? Because principles, that's why! \\n\\nLiam, our waiter was great. Service was fast too! It is on the pricier side, so get ready.

There are two display cases in the store that showcases their wide variety of donuts and it's pretty entertaining to read some of the names. I particularly enjoy the donuts that have all kinds of different cereals sprinkled on top, though I've never tried them. One thing to note is that you can only pay cash here, however, they have an ATM inside. I'm generally wary of companies that only work in cash because it seems sketchy, but this place is good and I keep going back!

The first time I visited Black Creek was actually for the rehearsal dinner of our wedding, courtesy of my new in-laws. Everyone was extremely impressed by the food (even my brother-in-law, who is a notoriously picky eater), and I was also thrilled with the service. The owner paid a visit to our table to congratulate us, and the servers kept everyone's wine glasses full. I also particularly like that this place has a dedicated parking lot since I am the world's worst parallel parker.\\n\\nMy husband and I finally returned yesterday evening with a gift certificate we've been holding on to since Christmas. We had planned to use it to celebrate the purchase of our first house in Merion Village (right down the road from Black Creek), but when that window had passed, we intended to go for our first anniversary. Missed that one, too, so we ended up using it for a random date night!\\n\\nSince we had some \\"free money\\" to burn, we went all out with cocktails, an appetizer, entrees, and dessert (can't remember the last time I got all that in one meal!). Husband ordered the Thyme Gimlet, which he totally bogarted despite the fact that I generously let him sip my St. Grandview cocktail (Watershed gin & St. Germain Elderflower liqueur). I think it's safe to say both drinks were great! We then ordered the Pancetta Pear Crisps as an appetizer, which were the perfect start to the meal. There are four crisps on the plate, which was great for the two of us. There is nothing particularly Spanish about this appetizer, but it still reminded me of tapas we got in Madrid, and I got nostalgic.\\n\\nWhen it came to meal time, I ordered the Duo of Lamb while Husband opted for the Seared Day Boat Scallops. I don't get to eat lamb that often (a fact that torments me daily), so I had the server recommend how to have it cooked (medium rare). The lamb was fantastic with the reduction, and came with mashed potatoes and zucchini as sides. I'll admit, I wish the sides were a bit more interesting, but they were not bad by any means. Husband was feeling generous enough to give me a substantial piece of one of his three large, perfectly cooked scallops.\\n\\nI had the rest of my lamb meal boxed up so I could save room for dessert. Our server (who I finally decided bore an uncanny resemblance to Trip van der Bilt of Gossip Girl, but with facial hair), recommended their \\"special\\" dessert, a bacon bourbon cr√®me br√ªl√©e. It was wonderful, though I didn't get the \\"bacon\\" flavor. A great end to the meal!\\n\\nOur bill came to around $90 before tip with all of that, which I think is completely worth it for the quality of meal and service we received. We will have to go back for the fixed price dinner Monday-Thursday when we don't have a gift card handy! My only regret is that I accidentally left my boxed lamb meal on the table when we left! I've been consoling myself by telling myself it wouldn't have been as good reheated... right?!

I also got the takoyaki, which was a bit battery but OK, and the negitoro maki, which was fine but a bit sparse.\\n\\nThey give you only 6 rolls in a set and tend to skimp on the filling, so if you're more of a rolls person, definitely go to the much-cheaper-for-more-quantity Wild Sushi across the street instead.

I became overwhelmed when I saw the menu. It was a little challenging to navigate however our waiter was willing to help. I took about half an hour trying to figure out what I wanted. I had never had a single thing on the menu and I went to the restroom as a panic attack ensued as my husband and I do not get the chance to eat out very often. As I was in there my husband asked for a recommendation from the waiter. The waiter recommended a snapper fish. When I emerged from the restroom the snapper fish was on its way out of the kitchen and my husband told me that it should be an okay pick for me. When it emerged it looked beautiful, but the skin wasn't something I had ever seen (we never eat at nice places like this). So I took a bite and did not find the skin to my liking. I began to peel the skin away and try it without the skin. Still not to my palates liking (I'd never had it before so I did not know). I tried one more bite and I couldn't eat any more- I put my fork down. At that point a manager/ head server popped up next to me, gave us fried rice and hush puppies up and said \\"nothing worse on date night then being disappointed- here this is on me tonight\\". It was so sweet. I cannot eat hush puppies, but my husband tried them and said they were awesome but filling and could only eat one. I tried the fried rice and it was really lemony and I couldn't eat it- too sour. I went to the restroom and as I was gone the manager checked in with my husband and asked if he could make me \\"anything else- anything at all\\". My husband replied that we were fine and we appreciated his care in customer satisfaction. Two different servers checked in on me (male and female) and I  assured them that I had just never had many fish and it was not their fault. When the bill came the manager took my food off the bill. My husband assured the waiter it was because I have had little to No fish experience. I agreed. My husband also shook the managers hand as we appreciated his care and dedication to customer satisfaction. As a military couple, bills are a little snug at times, we rarely eat out at nice places because of this. However my dislike for my food I would gladly sip another delicious jack and coke there to enjoy their employees who truthfully care about the customer experience.

Often times though, that can be where the experience stops with them. I don't know what it is with McMenamins and service and on almost every occasion I have visited one, I find myself scratching my head in disbelief. Maybe they believe that people will just come no matter how good or bad it is and for the most part, I think that's true.\\n\\nThe main reason we came this time was to have dinner at the Courtyard Restaurant because it's one of the only places left in town and maybe even on the planet, that still has wild salmon on the menu.\\n\\nBefore dinner we decided on a self guided tour of the school, trying to imagine what it might have been like to be a student here. There are lots of photos on the walls, of children having a good time, mingled with other works of art that take one on a great little journey.\\n\\nWe ended up at the Boiler Room, I guess the latest bar attempt at the school. The one thing I noticed was that it was somewhat quiet, which gets them a few bonus points. The gal who greeted us at the door was very helpful with answering questions, talking about the beer, etc. She even offered to get my mate a Terminator, which is a very good stout, so kudos to that employee.\\n\\nNow, if you want to talk about the Courtyard, that is an entirely different story. As I said before, we'd been once before for whatever reason and decided on a return trip to test out the wild salmon waters. How else can I sum it up but to say that the service here is notoriously bad, bad, bad!!! Our pager went off, summoning us to the host that our table was ready. But when we got there we waited over 5 minutes to get a table and the hostess actually forgot about us. What? In all fairness though she was very apologetic and was falling all over us, suffering untold embarrassment. However, when we got to the table we waited at least another 5 minutes before anyone showed up to take a drink order. He was helpful enough, though, and somewhere in all that he could have redeemed himself... not! As for the salmon? Well,,, it was way overcooked which for a piece of fish, no matter the variety, is ruinous. It was flavorful and served well along with mashed potatoes and broccolini but once you cross the overcooked line, there is no going back. It pains me to pay a premium price for something that is less than perfect and such was the case here. Then to top it all off, he never returned to the table for a refill or to check in with us to see how we were doing. Major fail.\\n\\nWe will probably return here again, maybe for a meal or a movie or just to hang out in the Boiler Room.

There was plenty of clam meat, and the chowder itself was satisfyingly thick.  But it didn't exactly rise above the rest, especially in New England.

Yes it's a high end restaurant but really there's not even a need to dress up or anything. We saw people's in there wearing shorts and informal wear. I ordered the vegetarian Wellington which was alright the first few bites but I didn't end up finishing all of it. The price point for the food seemed a little high considering they don't even make it fresh. All the food is already made and just warmed up and served. You can't take out anything from the dishes you ordered. The view was really nice for us because we got a window seat but not so great for those sitting in the middle or away. Yes you can still the Boston Skyline but the window tables make the experience much better. Overall the vibe of the restaurant was great and all but the food was not up to expectation since we are paying a premium price for not so premium food.

I love the way this pizza is put together - the physiology of these pies makes them my Austin fave (so far). The crust is thinner than others, more crisp/cracker-like, with just the right amount of sauce, cheese and toppings to harmonize - i.e., not too much. \\n\\nI'm especially a big fan of the margherita pie. Plenty of garlic and LOADS of fresh basil put Homeslice way out front for me.\\n\\nAre the ingredients (sauce, cheese) less than top-shelf, as some others have penned? In all likelihood, I imagine, but for me that is no matter: A bite into one of these √ºber-thin slices is an experience of unity between crust, sauce and cheese. The harmony is spot-on, so I'm not gonna worry so much if the tenor is wearing a cheap suit. Some of the very best pizza I've had elsewhere has been pretty humble stuff.\\n\\nYes, there are caveats, to be sure. I'm not crazy about waiting over an hour amidst the throngs of SOCO hipsters for a dinnertime pie. That long a wait can easily build one's \\"this better be good\\" expectations to the point where, unless you're totally committed to thin-crust Nirvana, as I am, you're likely gonna want that hour of your life back.\\n\\nThat leaves me to mostly order slices of Margherita pie during off-hours, and hope some daily special slices are on offer (i.e., other than cheese or pepperoni). That strategy has its hazards: I've had some slices that seemed like they'd been hanging around a little longer than usual, that haven't been heated enough, etc.\\n\\nBut I'll continue to go back and suffer through those inconveniences and imperfections for pie that is put together in a way that \\"just does it\\" for me."},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"After reading all of the raving reviews on Yelp i was dying to check this place out.

Two ordered the Quattro Formaggi (one was GF), one had the Funghi, and one had the gluten free Maiale.  All were very happy with the starters, wine, and pizzas.  The quality of the prosciutto, greens, mushrooms, tomatoes, cheeses, really made for flavorful pizzas.  The wheat crust was reportedly chewy, flavorful, and not too thick.  The GF crust seemed rice-based, thin, dense, chewy, crispy around the edges, with no weird sliminess or canines I have noticed in other GF crust.  Our gluten sensitivities are bothersome, but we do not have Celiac Disease.  We did not suffer from \\"wheat hangover.\\"  We finished with an assortment of sorbetti, gelatti, an amaro flight and tea. All were happy with their requests.  The sorbetti and gelatti flavors were concentrated and unique.  The amaro flight had intense, amazing flavors which nicely finished my meal.  Taylor's service throughout our meal was stellar--she was friendly, patient, helpful, unobtrusive.  Locale's style of pizza style is less hearty than a typical New York or Chicago pizza.

There was no lavendar in the lemonaid, it tasted like any lemonaid anywhere, and the oatmeal was HORRIBLE.

While we made the tail end of the happy hour, their happy hour menu left me somewhat wanting.  Your choice is three skewers or raw oysters.  We had the octopus skewer and oysters. When the waitress mentioned the skewer size we opted for two but one would have been plenty for two people who just wanted a taste. They had set the super tender octopus on a potatoes that were like a spoonful of rough mashed potatoes with bits of crunchiness. The octopus was really delicious but the potatoes were so salty. For some reason, they must have salt as the second ingredient for their dishes.  We also had the raw oysters which was nothing spectacular.\\n\\nFor our main course, we opted for some entrees. If you're looking for authentic Peruvian cuisine, I'm thinking this is not the place. It's refined and they use ingredients like soy and oyster sauce. I had the beef tenders with stir fried onions and tomatoes with french fries. The ingredients tasted really fresh but something was just not jelling. The beef seemed overcooked. Also, if their pulled their salt content half way back, the food would be twice as good. \\n\\nThe restaurant is beautifully set - very romantic and warm feeling to it. Feels perfect to be in Pearl District. The service was flawless.  Their regular tapas menu is expensive!  When the small plates start at 10 and you need a few plates to get going, it's gonna hit your wallet.  Not very inviting to try many different items like I usually do at tapas restaurants.

The raspberry drizzle really bring out the caviar on top and made the wonton bursting of flavors.

A friend was visiting ATL from out of town and chose this place, so Huz and I went- thinking we'd buy a drink or two and call it a day. BUT...Poor Calvin's has changed our mindset. \\n\\nAs soon as we walked up to the door, the smell of yumminess was hard to resist. We ordered several small plates- the beef satay, the basil spring rolls, the fried goat cheese, and a side of FGT. The peanut sauce for the satay was tangy and smooth. The fried goat cheese came inside kale mashed potatoes on top of a fried onion ring and fried green tomato. No words can describe how amazing it was- ooey, gooey, crunchy, and savory at the same time.  The basil rolls- meh. Good, but wouldn't get again (it was missing a crunch/wow factor- maybe some avocado or cucumbers in addition to the lettuce and carrot could liven it up?).  FGT- yum, but nothing standout; wish they were served with a spicy side sauce. Oh and the house made ginger beer! If you are suffering from the yellow dust known as \\"spring\\" in ATL- this drink will clear up your sinuses, fast!\\n\\nOverall, the presentation of the food was lovely (although we wondered why there were so many decorative sprigs on a plate) and the ambience was great for a date night or a meetup with close friends. While a bit pricey ($9.00 for fried goat cheese!?)- the portions are HUGE and the food is delicious. Next time we'll come back for the dessert :-) \\n\\nTIP: The parking situation is a little strange at first, especially if you are not familiar with the area (we aren't). Turns out street parking is 2 hours unpaid on Piedmont- just make sure your parked in the right area.

I got a single burger with an abundance of the \\"free\\" toppings- grilled and raw onions, jalapenos, tomato, lettuce, ketchup and mustard... If you add their premium toppings its a buck each so if you're not careful ur burger can come out hella expensive. A small fry was 2.97 plus the salt and vinegar topping which was not remarkable at all and was an additional seventy cents. I at first thought they forgot the topping because I didn't taste salt nor vinegar. my bf got a double cheeseburger with an egg and his total with the cost of the fries was 11 bucks.  I would pay that much for farm burger but the quality here was exactly like five guys, not that thats a bad thing, just knowing you can get it down the street for five bucks cheaper makes it less tasty.

Virtually everything was perfect from the service to food to drinks. Woah.\\n\\nThe first thing I ordered was a pisco sour... and it was amazing. Tart, strong, refreshing, complex... everything I look for in a drink. Definitely got my seal of approval. I also loved the bread and assortment of chutneys/sauces that were provided to us. They come in mild, medium, and spicy, and all of the sauces were amazing. I think my favorite was the green, which happened to be the spiciest. \\n\\nFor appys, we decided to go with oysters on the half shell. The oysters were really fresh and I loved the sauces that came with them (the portabello in particular was great... the meatiness of the mushroom paired nicely with the oyster) but I have to say I wasn't incredibly impressed with how the oysters were served. Whoever shucked them did a sub-par job... but really, this was the only imperfection of the evening, so I'm okay with it. \\n\\nFor entrees, I had the quinoa crusted scallops which were quite delicious. The scallops themselves were gargantuan! The quinoa and seasoned coating provided a nice texture and flavor but didn't take the spot light away from the delicate flavor of the scallops. The pasnip and potato puree and the wilted spinach served underneath the scallps were also great. Well-seasoned but subtle. I think the most memorable thing about this dish was the presentation which was very well thought out, clean, and artful. It was a dish that was almost too pretty to eat.\\n\\nThe other people at my table also enjoyed their meals (and I enjoyed them too based off of the bites I stole). The lamb shank was probably the star of the evening. It was so tender and hearty yet not excessively rich. My friend always, always orders this dish... I think it would be hard to stray from this dish in the future since it is 110% the best lamb I've ever had. While I enjoyed my scallops immensely, they don't even closely compare to the lamb. I really, really wish I had ordered that!\\n\\nFor dessert the table shared a mousse and the lemon-goat cheese cake. The mousse was incredibly decadent, rich, smooth, and creamy. Fresh berries complimented the heaviness of chocolate. The lemon-goat cheese cake was really light and refreshing and the perfect dessert for a warm summer night.\\n\\nThroughout the night service was exceptional. The place was packed and my party was really late for our reservation, but we were in no way rushed and the flow of dishes and drinks coming out was perfect. \\n\\nI really can't say enough good things about Andina.

They have cashiers who can help you but it's hard to tell which donuts are which unless you ask.  The menu is also displayed on the wall but it's hard to match each description to the exact donut in the display case.  I felt like it was almost too much for me to keep asking the cashier what each of the donuts were in the case and what was inside each of the donuts.  \\n\\nThey definitely have unique flavors and pretty much anything sweet that you can slap on a donut.  We ordered a regular chocolate donut so we could compare a regular donut to a regular donut shop back at home.  And we also ordered another chocolate donut that had peanut butter and rice krispies on top.  \\n\\nThe rice krispies were stale and the donut itself was not good.  The regular chocolate donut was okay but overall, both donuts were super sweet.  I guess we should've ordered the Maple Bacon Bar but overall, I think this place has really super heavy donuts that are too sweet and too rich.

Luckily they had room available at the bar/chef's table so we didn't have to wait. However, if you decide to come with a group, I would definitely recommend to make a reservation on a busy night. The interior is surprisingly very large, beautifully decorated, with lots going on -people moving around, lots of loud talking, live music in the corner, and smoke puffing out from the kitchen which is cleverly located in the center of the restaurant. I thought it was really cool to be able to sit at the bar surrounding the kitchen, and see how each dish was collaboratively made starting with the cooks, to the sous chef, to the executive chef, and to the waiter, who delivers the finished product. \\n\\nThere's not a ton of items on the menu -which I like, because it means they know what's good.

We made a reservation for a party of 5 at 8pm on a Saturday night, and it took them a few minutes to get our table ready when we arrived. We had Happy Hour earlier that day, and weren't super hungry, so decided to order some small plates to share:\\n\\n-Complimentary Bread w/Trio of Dipping Sauces (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/andina-portland?select=rbduOv-jgkSe-3xymviQMw#rbduOv-jgkSe-3xymviQMw): Yum! We loved the trio of dipping sauces. Some were spicier than others, which worked out well since some of us like spice whereas the others don't. All three were very flavorful, and it was difficult to stop eating the bread.\\n-Pimiento Piquillo Relleno (Sweet Piquillo Peppers Stuffed w/Quinoa, Cheese, Serrano Ham, Small Size, $10.50, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/andina-portland?select=rbduOv-jgkSe-3xymviQMw#tLxgV4mziTRn-59A-ssyWw): Yum! Surprisingly, this was one of my favorite dishes. The piquillo pepper is cooked perfectly, and the stuffing was flavorful and delicious. A must order!\\n-Conchas a la Parrilla (Grilled Diver Scallops w/a Tamari-Brown Sugar Butter Sauce, Crispy Onions, Medium Size, $20, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/andina-portland?select=rbduOv-jgkSe-3xymviQMw#bfRdMX9g9t65J15t61CqJQ): Also delicious! The sugar butter sauce went perfectly with the scallops and crispy onions, and I could've eaten a whole plate of these. A must order!\\n-Palta Rellena de Cangrejo (Avocado Stuffed w/Crab, Topped w/a Poached Prawn, Medium Size, $20, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/andina-portland?select=rbduOv-jgkSe-3xymviQMw#2TIapX6fDTLXPiYqA9gjUA): Good if you like avocado! There was a good amount of crab, and both the crab and prawns were cooked really well.

I'm not a huge fan of causas, so didn't fall in love with this dish, but it was good. The crispy breaded prawn was probably my favorite part.\\n-Mixto Chorrillano (Shrimp, Mussels, Scallops, Octopus, Fish, $16, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/andina-portland?select=rbduOv-jgkSe-3xymviQMw#ZLtSnThA6FIu7OEtVdXrEg): I'm also not a huge fan of ceviche, so this was my least favorite dish. My friends enjoyed it but I wouldn't order it again.\\n-Melones Con Aji (Gin Shaken w/Lime Juice, Sugar, Fresh Cantaloupe Juice, Served on the Rocks w/a Float of Cucumber Water, Lime Zest, Ground Hot Peppers, $10.50, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/andina-portland?select=rbduOv-jgkSe-3xymviQMw#TbZVb_NfYiLSF_K2L624Ow): LOVED this drink! I substituted the gin for vodka, and it tasted great. The cantaloupe juice was refreshing, especially with the float of cucumber and lime zest. Highly recommended!\\n-Mojito de Pina (Pineapple Amber Rum Shaken w/Fresh Crushed Pineapple, Lime Juice, Basil, Cane Sugar, $10.50): I tried some of my friend's drink and thought this was good, especially if you really like pineapple. However, I liked my Melones Con Aji better!\\n\\nI really enjoyed the flexibility of the plate sizing at Andina- you can order pretty much any dish as a Small, Medium, or Large portion, and they adjust the prices accordingly. This allowed us to try a variety of different dishes. Service was good, and our server made some good recommendations. The food can take a little while to arrive though. Although Andina is definitely on the pricier side, the quality of their food is worth it! I will definitely be back at some point when I travel to Portland again.

This bright, inviting tasting room is a mecca for beer geeks all over and I would recommend bringing any visiting beer geek here in a heartbeat for a world-class beer tasting experience. The beers here border on the unusual and fascinating and are conditioned to age. Your friend that only likes Bud Light? They're not gonna like it and you two probably won't speak again if you bring them here.\\n\\nOnto the men! er, beer:\\n\\nAdam's my boy. He's dark and alluring and has a great chocolate quality to him. What woman doesn't like chocolate?  Cherry Adam is all the above, just more delicious with the addition of the black cherry. I got to try some vintage Adam on my last visit and he only gets better with age, and you all know I like my men slightly older...\\nWhen I'm in a more eccentric mood, I like to spend some quality time with Fred. He's a big boy at 10% and will leave you full. Speaking of which, most the beers have a pretty high ABV here. I'd recommend the walk the dog taster tray with 3 oz each of Greg, Adam, Fred and Blue Do it if you are short on time and want to try it all and still be able to stand up straight afterward. \\nSpeaking of big beers, don't forget to try their 11.5% barleywine, Doggie Claws, very fruity and boozy. \\nMost recently I had a fling with Bob,a delightful chap he was- their sour made with peach, apricot and cherries.\\nI couldn't do this review without giving some significant love to Blue Dot, one of my favorite IPA's in town that is big on citrus. This is probably the easiest beer to obtain offsite as well. \\nThere's also a lady in the midst! In the summertime, the crisp, clean Ruth is my gal. \\nLast and well, least, there's Greg.He's all yours ladies (and gentlemen). His squashlike character just doesn't do it for me.  \\n\\nUntil our last visit, I always saw Trumer Pils on tap here if you are in the mood for something lighter. They also offer cider. The vintage bottles are for on-site consumption only but are worth it if you have the $$$ to try them. Be sure to check out the rotating From the Wood tap of barrel aged beer. \\n\\nI didn't feel like I could do this review justice until I had tried their food. The menu is definitely along the lines of beer snacks, small portions, small prices. I really enjoyed what we had, the tender brisket and the ooey gooey mac and cheese which we added pancetta to for $2 extra. Worth it. Do it. The brussel sprouts were the perfect addition to our meal. Next time I've just got to try their Chuck Norris duck wings. How can you not with a name like that? We also saw the meat and cheese platter pass by and it looked delectable and would make a superb complement to the beers. \\n\\nWe always sit at the bar and usually have the pleasure of being waited on by the lovely, bubbly Wendy, but on our last visit we had another guy who was equally endearing and great to chat beer with.

After downing some coffee downtown I visited to realized my old favorite wing place had went way down hill. Every table was dirty from the night before, and we're talking about 11:30 just after lunch opening. So, that leads me to believe that the night Hooters gals didn't clean up. And, the morning openers didn't lift a finger at least in our section to prepare for the next days guests.\\n\\nI pressed on with the wife not so happily dining with me. At this point she is exclaiming Golden Corral would have been a viable alternative.  I've got fond memories of the old Northcross Mall location. The manager Randall swinging by appreciating our business; dang that location was top notch. This Hooters  experience on this visit was depressing. I feel like stabbing a plate of chicken wings right now.\\n\\nI used to think the Three Mile Island was the bomb. Today, recalling old memories it didn't pass go. The difference was the amount of sauce on the wings; a whole lot less than the olden days. The wings used to be submerged, dunked, and drowned to perfection. I'm not exactly sure, but I think the cooks have switched to one of those low pressure spray bottles with a suppressor. The spice level also wasn't what I remember. \\n\\nOne more short paragraph of negative and I'll move onto what I liked. I realize Hooters used to be the only wing game in town. These days with Pluckers and other chicky wing outlets taking a bite out of Hooter's breastesses has to stop the sauce expansion somewhere. The General Tso's option was the correct consistency but was too sweet and lacked the correct spice level. Shouldn't have listened to the waitress on that suggestion.\\n\\nFinally, the 1lb snow crab legs was the redemption of this visit. All the clusters cooked to perfection with drawn butter. No milky solids left over in the butter, a step that most restaurants overlook these days during preparation in exchange for speed. BTW, the old combo plate that combined the crab legs, wings, and fries was sorely missed on this visit. I think it was around the $25 range back in the day.

A true, self respecting, Southern local does not eat grits from a bowl, especially a miniature one. And they were cool, not as in hip, as in cold in temperature. Maybe it was the gigantic whirlybird of a ceiling fan circulating over our heads. Ceiling fans should be used on a porch to shoo away the flies, not inside the house.

First of all screw Chicago and their pizza casseroles, this bread has crunch. This isn't a New York pizza joint so don't expect flavorless thin crust with overly piled toppings on a monster pizza.

It has a unique flavor that's slightly bitter at the edges and contrasts nicely with the toppings. The sauce is spicy tomato sauce, a little more suited for the discerning Austin pallet. The pizza is served Sicilian style with racing stripes on top of the cheese and toppings.\\n\\nMy picks:\\n\\n1.) The Detroiter. Two types of pepperoni, sauce and cheese. It's fucking delicious!! Try it with a Deep Ellum IPA or a Pearl Snap.\\n\\n2.) The Cadillac: sweet and salty. It's figs on a pizza. OMFG! It's delicious!\\n\\n3.) The Greek: Shaved Ham, Olives, onions and feta.

We had been wanting to try Mary Mac's for awhile and decided to go there instead. BIG MISTAKE! My fianc√© and I have grown up in the south and we have grown up eating southern food. The food was absolutely AWFUL! The bread that they brought out was dry and hard. The only thing that was good from the bread basket was the pecan rolls which were okay. We ordered two appetizers: deviled eggs and Brunswick stew. The deviled eggs had an awful taste, and the Brunswick stew was way too tomato-y for Brunswick stew. For dinner we decided to try to their sampler which means we got three entrees and three sides plus two desserts. For the three entrees we chose their fried chicken, meatloaf, and chicken and dumplings. The fired chicken tasted like they forgot to season at some point in the cooking process. It has no flavor. The meatloaf was absolutely dry, crumbly, and had an awful tomato sauce on top. The chicken and dumplings would have been okay if they had made biscuit like dumplings instead of pasta/noodle dumplings. But unfortunately we have never liked noodle dumplings. The three sides that we got were creamed corn, mashed potatoes, and macaroni and cheese. The only side that we liked was the creamed corn, but we have had better canned. The potatoes were dry, and there was no cheese taste to the Mac and cheese. It was dry and looked like it was leftover from the day before. For dessert we got bread pudding with a wine sauce, and banana pudding. The banana pudding tasted okay, but the color was so off putting it was unappetizing (it was gray). The bread pudding do not taste like traditional bread pudding where you can taste the egg custard you bake it in. It tasted like cinnamon and that was it.

Knowing German food well, I will warn you up-front that I am a bit picky when it comes to stateside imitations so here goes ...\\n\\nThere was a short wait when we arrived even though there were numerous empty tables, so I went to the bar after a long day on the road to order a cold German stein of beer. I must have stood there for at least five minutes while the bartender frantically bounced around right in front of me, ensuring to take care of the servers at their station at the end of the bar, but ignoring me completely. Not even so much as a \\"hello\\", some eye contact, or \\"I'll be with you in a minute\\", so I went back to the waiting area empty handed.\\n\\nIt took our server a good ten minutes to greet us once we were seated and she seemed so rushed that she ran off to order our Pretzel Fondue ($13.25) before I had the chance to finish inquiring about the menu and telling her what I wanted to order. I did get the chance to order a stein of Spaten Optimator ($8.95), a dark, robust German \\"bier\\" (7.2%), which took another 10-15 minutes to arrive.\\n\\nMy wife and I decided to share the fondue and because they are closing for good on December 31st, I wanted to sample a few different menu items before they cease to exist, so I ordered the Munich Feast ($24.25) to share as well. The server had \\"the feast\\" split into two plates, each with half portions of the weinerschnitzel and creamy paprika mushroom sauce, pork cutlet cordon bleu, a wurst of some sort, sp√§tzle, red cabbage, sauerkraut, and a Bavarian pretzel.\\n\\nThe fondue came in a soup cup with two pretzels, not in a pot heated by flame. The cheese was tasty enough, but lukewarm, especially after 10-15 minutes. The pretzels were big, salty, warm and soft, just as they should be. Not a bad effort for a German restaurant doing a Swiss dish.\\n\\nThe Munich feast would have been too much food for one person, but the portions were most likely far smaller than the standard orders because the cordon bleu was tiny and the weinerschnitzel not a whole lot bigger. The biggest thing on the plate was the unidentified sausage, a rather cheap and benign variety looking like a big hot dog, only tastier. The sp√§tzel was OK and the red cabbage/sauerkraut decent, but everything was, like the fondue, lukewarm and unimpressive.\\n\\nBased on the speed in which both the fondue and feast arrived, very quickly, it seemed obvious that everything was pre-made, maybe nuked or stored in a warming tray, then thrown on a plate. Maybe that is why they are closing or it could be because they are closing, they just do not care any more because that was the impression I got from the staff and the food.\\n\\nThey will apparently be demolishing the beautiful building in early 2017, so make sure you visit during the last 5 weeks of 2016 and this Portland institution's existence if you are in the mood for fair, lukewarm German food and mediocre, apathetic service ... auf wiedersehen Rheinlander!\\n\\nCombatCritic Gives Rheinlander A Parting 5 Bombs Out Of 10 ...

Two of ATL's most influential restaurateurs, Bob Amick and Todd Rushing opened Two urban licks in 2004 as a follow-up restaurant to One.midtown kitchen. At the helm of Two urban licks is the home grown Executive Chef, Cameron Thompson, who learned his fiery American cooking talents from fellow \\"Buckhead Lifers\\" Kevin Rathbun (Rathbun's, Krog Bar), Hilary White (the Hil), and Scott Serpas (Serpas True Food).\\n\\nWhen one walks into this swank dining place, they are grabbed by the sounds of live blues, spirited chatter, and the smell of sizzling spices. Our waitress and tour guide for the evening was Janice Rice. She started our engines with a carafe (thief) of Andrew Geoffrey's Cabernet Franc from the one of a kind \\"Wine Wall\\" which holds 42 barrels, yes barrels, of wine from California. The rich dark cherry, cedar aromas with bold flavors of dark chocolate, pepper, and plums proved to be the perfect match for Cameron's creations. In addition to the unique wine program is the fruit infused cocktails hanging above the bar. Try the appealing Sergeant Pepper Margarita- WOW!!! And you'll sing a song and not sing out of key....\\n\\nThe outrageous small plates are meant to be shared, so try several. The crowd's favorite is the Salmon Chips- smoked salmon with chipotle-spiked cream cheese over homemade potato chips. My fav, the Thai Tuna Tartare- on a fried wonton chip is an avocado puree mixed with diced blue-fin tuna, lime, mango, and a classic aioli that is spiced up with sriracha- get it and you will understand. For meat lovers, there are the incredible Lamb Lollipops with a black grape chili jam, and the lip smacking slow cooked Baby Back Ribs dressed with a spicy, not hot, cider bbq sauce with a side of tangy apple coleslaw. The outstanding Shaved Calamari made with an Indonesian style sambal syrup, or the plump Flash Fried Oysters with Creole mustard-tartar, are not to be missed- both are yummy!!!\\n\\nAs Janice was delivering our entrees, it was fun to watch the organized chaos of the open kitchen with its 14-foot wood pit rotisserie tower, but then I noticed an amazing view of Atlanta's skyline lit against the darkness of the night. Too bad it wasn't warmer outside to take advantage of the outdoor dining. OK back to the food... The succulent trio of enormous Scallops sat on top of a bed of Logan Turnpike gouda grits, and the Tanglewood Farm Duck Breast with the cayenne sweet potato puree, were to die for. Get a side order of the creamy, garlicky Collard Greens and the NY style Mac 'n' Cheese. Also, the American Shrimp was prepared in a classic low country style with house-made Andouille sausage, mussels, corn on the cob, okra, and potatoes in a nice \\"Nawlins\\" citrus broth that is dipping good...\\nSo what's Two urban licks??? It's an intown oasis that provides an escape into the evening with others who seek a good time. To sink into the soft booth seating with lots of pillows, dine on food that screams flavor, sip delicious wines, and share laughter with friends are simply the perfect ingredients to a fun-filled outing.

I had a lot of it when I was little. So when I heard of XLB, I thought that I must go and visit. I went with my girlfriend today.\\n\\nWhat we ordered:\\n- Xiao Long Bao, of course\\n- chive and mushroom baozi\\n- sesame noodle salad with tofu\\n\\nWhat I liked:\\n- The skin of the XLB was spot on: thin, slightly chewy, but not so thin that it would be hard to pick up with the chopsticks (in China, it is common that the skin is so thin that it breaks when you pick it up and the juices all flow out). I personally consider the skin to be probably the hardest thing to get right with XLB, so kudos! \\n- The XLB did have some juice - not as much as what I've had before, but still a good amount, and it's not so hot that it burns your tongue.\\n- Service: I'm used to having my XLB with only Zhenjiang black vinegar (I saw bottles of it lining the shelves); the dipping sauce I got with my XLB was vinegar + soy sauce, so I asked for pure black vinegar, and they happily gave me some.\\n\\nWhat I didn't like:\\n- Yes, they got the skin spot on, but I did not care for the filling. XLB should taste rich and meaty, strongly of pork, slightly sweet with rice wine, hint of ginger, and well-complemented by vinegar that cuts through the richness. This tasted... Vegetal. Celery-like. Maybe too much green onions? The texture is off too: the filling seems to fall apart and does not hold together; if I can distinguish between individual pieces of ground pork when I'm chewing, that's not right.\\n- The skin of the XLB was great - but what happened to the skin of the mushroom and chive baozi?! Those baozi should have a soft, pillowy, well-risen dough; these baozi are flat, poorly folded, and the skin is gummy and dense, as if it did not rise properly AND not fully cooked through. On top of that, the filling was too bland. I have bought frozen baozi, 6 for $2, heated up in the microwave, that tasted better than this.\\n- The noodles were bland and tasteless. Napa cabbage, when wilted, has a strong, off-putting smell that dominated the dish. Tofu was bitter, which sometimes happen when it's not blanched when used in salads. I don't know what the almonds are doing there, but they add a weird aftertaste that did nothing to save the dish. The only way to eat it was by drowning it in chili oil, and even then, we couldn't finish.\\n\\nVerdict:\\nOver-hyped. If you've never had XLB before, please do yourself a favor and go to Ding Tai Fung in Seattle for a proper introduction and first impression.

After all, we're from Round Rock, we would need to book a flight...why travel so far for \\"just a hot dog\\"?\\n\\nAfter finally convincing my wife and telling her my fellow Yelpers highly recommended this place, we took the trip and reached Frank at around 6:30 pm and it was just starting to get packed. The environment was very Austin, almost like it was supposed to be in SoCo. They had a great selection on beers and of course, hot dog styles. I got the Carolina and she got something on the specials menu (they rotate specials weekly). We shared a large basket of waffle fries and a corn cup. \\n\\nService was very friendly and quick. The corn cup was incredible and full of flavor, a must-get. The waffle fries were good and the basket is so big it could feed 3-4 people. Once the hot dogs arrived, my wife took her first bite and you couldn't miss the WOW across her face. I had the WOW and the I-Told-You-So look. Frank really did live up to its expectations.\\n\\nWe ended the night with an order of the chocolate chip bacon cookie. My wife had been on a cookie baking spree that would make the Cookie Monster look lazy, so this was something we just had to try. And it hit the spot! Salty, sweet, soft, warm, all the characteristics of an epic cookie!"},{"name":"Carlita's","address":"1101 NW Northrup St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I was excited to see a new taco spot pop up in the neighborhood (I live at the NV which is 2 blocks away) but the excitement was immediately followed up by major disappointment once I started eating. The quality of meat they are serving here is not good. I got the chicken mole, pork shoulder and pork belly tacos. I weigh like 200 pounds so finishing 3 tacos for me is easy peasy but I didn't even want these tacos. The pork shoulder was decent (gotta give credit where credits due) but the chicken was not even editable. My girlfriend got the steak taco which was borderline disgusting since the meat was too tough and chewey.

You enter the restaurant in the bar area and it was happening. Lively, soft lights, good vibe, elegant, young-ish. This leads into the dining area with an open kitchen (and a dining counter! love a dining counter!). The lighting was a bit brighter which made you feel like you had definitely transitioned out of a bar and into a dining room. Though it was full, it didn't feel crowded...or noisy: my major pet peeve. (Who wants to listen to a bass line all night which is all you can hear when music is played loudly in a noisy restaurant. Even Ron Carter would agree.) \\n\\nWe ordered specialty cocktails (loved the Orchard Collins), and, in the first round, fluke crudo, seafood escabeche, broccoli rabe, and curried hot crab. Portions were on the small side, but I LOVE THAT. Prices were commensurate with portions and this gave us a chance to taste lots of dishes. Second round: duck breast, pickles and dip, charred octopus. I won't critique each dish but will say that the overall emphasis seemed to be on simple but bold flavors, a refined earthiness, and careful plating. I realize this sounds pretentious (of me, not the chef), but that is the best way I can describe it. \\n\\nEach dish had a unique flavor profile so that even when a particular dish (pickles and dip) was not awesome, it was still interesting. When it was awesome (fluke crudo), it was sublime. There is a lot of potential here, IMO. I hope the chef(s) keep working the rough-refined New England thing they've got going on. \\n\\nService was both attentive and spacy as the evening wore on. Whatever.

She had lemonade, I had an americano and we split some waffle fries with sour cream, bacon and cheese.  I thought my sausage was good, and there was a nice play between the savory/slightly spicy sausage and the BBQ sauce in the bottom of the bun.  The roll it was served in was a nice change to the plain-Jane white bun.  I didn't think the ounce of mac and cheese on the top was particularly flavorful, and I didn't think it added too much to the meal.  It would have been better in a slightly larger portion and on the side.  The mini corn dogs were really good, and we liked the fries as well.  The lemonade was too tart for my kiddos taste, and the coffee was right on the mark.  (If you follow my reviews you know I'm picky about my coffee.)  \\n\\nWhat makes this place shine for me, and why they got a fourth Yelp star, were the two people who worked at the restaurant that we interacted with; the hostess and the waitress.

We decided not to send it back again because we didn't trust the kitchen when food gets sent back repeatedly.  The server informed us that since this was a special basil hollandaise sauce that it kept on breaking and had to be cooked at a lower temperature; also from the time the kitchen plated it the entr√©e must have cooled down by the time it reached out table.

The second time, I needed a place to take my foodie boss when he was in town. Score at K&D! \\n\\nHe raved about his meal & still mentions the great food there. Now, I did give K&D five stars, but I will tell you that the trout I had on my second visit was just \\"good\\" but not \\"wow\\".... It did not live up to my first visit, when even the little beet salad on my plate (just a little garnish practically) was so insanely good that I could not stop eating it and still recall it as one of the best salads I've had... So, I will allow room for the negative comments about food that's not perfection.... I think that since the menu is constantly changing, there is the possibility in the mix for the sublime, but also for the occasional dish that underwhelms.\\n\\nAlso notable.... Two different servers on two different visits & yet they were both friendly, accommodating, and knowledgeable without a whiff of irony or smug hipster pretentiousness (Sad plague of every \\"good\\" restaurant, but never the truly great ones- the internal monologue always the same- \\"I am doing such an incredible job of pretending to care....while at the same time holding my arm 'just so', to better show off my tattoo.... and vaguely rasping my beard in annoyance while you make your final wine selection\\") OK, I get it- the subservient role that pays your bills eats your soul and your barely concealed seething over having to be nice to A-holes is purposeful, but I am always exceedingly polite to wait staff & I am not patronizing.... Oh, wait- K&D has managed to hire people who are seemingly happy! (Gasp!) Still attractive hipster types, (who else?) but I never dealt with a 'tude from anyone: hostess, bar staff, or wait staff. How refreshing... \\n\\nThe space is relatively small inside, but it makes it feel cozy, not cramped. There are more tables than it would seem when you first walk in. (There is a big outdoor patio, too, but this felt more like a singles bar than a part of the restaurant... An interesting dichotomy). The open wood grill kitchen adds a fantastic energy to the room, whether you pay attention to it or not, and the intensity and seriousness of the cooks is an interesting sideshow on its own if there is a lull in convo. \\n\\nBottom line- love this place. Some of the experimental dishes might not be on par with what the chef is capable of at his best, but I would rather enjoy a seasonal menu with new surprises than have the kitchen turn out the same \\"perfected\\" dishes each visit.

While waiting, no other guests left the restaurant, and yet, when we were finally seated, we five adults were seated in a small square table for four people.  Basically, all they did was add a place setting to a table. Moreover, while waiting for our table, we were informed that there would now suddenly be a $24 minimum per person per table.  The website clearly states that this charge does not happen until 8pm, yet the staff said they have suddenly decided to change the rules, without any warning.  This is unfathomable to me.  Finally, we made sure to order enough food to meet the minimum, even though we had dinner plans afterward, and, rather than bringing the food out appropriately in a reasonable order, and given the ridiculously small amount of space on our table, all the food was brought out all at once.

The dinner menu is quite a bit different than what I found online. It is far more expansive in the restaurant. This is an old institution in Boston and reminded me of the old adage: \\"200 years of history unimpeded by progress\\".\\nWe were seated 30 minutes after our reservation time. Navigating around the restaurant requires egress up and down narrow, steep stairs that are potentially quite dangerous for seniors-narrow, steep, short foot treads on every stairwell. \\nMenu offered multiple seafood and other options. My Seafood Newburgh was perfectly executed comfort food. Scallops and Shrimp were perfectly cooked, the sauce was tasty but not distinctive. I also ordered a cup of clam chowder, which was good, but not great. \\nMy biggest complaint regards their wine list and corkage policy. It is common practice in California and in most progressive dining scenes around the world to permit diners to bring a special bottle of wine to dinner and pay a corkage fee to compensate the restaurant for service and loss of revenue. That is apparently not allowed in Boston (with some exceptions). To add insult to injury, the wine list is so paltry and limited that it would be an embarrassment to most restaurants with a similar history, menu, and reputation. I have seen sandwich delis with a better wine selection. The lack of selection and limited choices made it clear that the restaurant simply does not want to be bothered with managing a decent wine program. \\nThe restrooms were some of the most disgusting I have witnessed in the United States. The upstairs men's room was filthy and unattended to, while the downstairs men's room smelled overwhelmingly like fresh vomit. \\nService was acceptable, but the next time I am in Boston,  I will opt for enjoying quality food and wine in a more comfortable dining environment."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I really liked it!

Years ago I had our office Christmas party at UOH and I remember it as OK, nothing great.  My friend and I often drop in for oysters and beers at the bar.  The oysters are excellent, shucked right in front of you.  The beer is cold, and the shuckers/bartenders attentive, the clam chowder good, the oyster stew not so good.  However when you dine in its a different story.  I haven't had service this bad in a long time.  We sat in the seat yourself bar area.  There were two open booths, both dirty.  We sat for about ten minutes before our table was cleared.  They wiped it with a dry cloth, leaving sticky dried spills on the table.  The booths are small, they are old - from another time when people were a lot smaller but that is OK, it goes with the antiquity of the building.  In fact a picture showing the bar from 1930 reveals nothing has changed at all in at least the last 80+ years.  Anyway they set the table with 4 placemats but 3 spoons and 4 napkins.  We asked for a wet cloth to clean the table and another fork.  Evcentually someone came back with a dry cloth and rewiped the table, no improvement.  Whatever.  We asked what kind of oysters they had today, she said Blue Point.  This was strange because every time I sit at the bar they always have two varieties.  We ordered 2 dozen oysters, two beers, and two kids meals and 2 sprites.  She brought the beers on a wet (spilled beer) tray.  She put the glasses on the table without a coaster or wiping them off, now the paper placemats are wet.  I wiped up the mess with my napkin.  Now we are short one napkin and one fork.  Something is wrong with the sprites.  Its not sprite, tastes like lemon tonic.  We send them back and ask for 2 waters. The food comes out in a reasonable time.  As my wife and I are both former servers, I feel there is nothing worse than being served your food but not having essential tools..  You sit there looking at your food but you can't eat it because you don't have a fork or napkin.  The oysters are on a plate that is way too small.  This means they have to stack them and the grit from the outside of the shell gets into the oyster below it.  There are no lemons, the cocktail sauce is too small for a dozen, they are designed for a half dozen plate.  The server should put 2 on a full dozen.  There is plenty of horseradish, equal in volume to the cocktail sauce.  Eventually we do get a fork, napkin, lemons.  I go to the bar and refill my own cocktail sauce.  I eat the oysters and try to spit out the bits of shell and grit.  After we eat we stack all the plates to aid in  the clearing of the small table.  No plates are ever cleared from the table.  The bill comes, the sprites were not removed.  On the way out I hear a server call for a half plate of Blues.  I check with the guys at the raw bar, sure enough they have Blue Points and Wellfleets.  We would have liked to get half and half.\\n\\nBottom line, avoid the dining room, sit at the raw bar.  Really I should post 2 reviews, 1 star for the dinig room/sit down, and 4 for the raw bar.  I would give the raw bar 5 stars but the seats are small and its tilted a lot so you have to prop up your plate with a stack of coasters so everything doesn't slide into your lap.  I order a lot of oysters at many different restaurants and clearly UOH has the freshest most consistent oysters around.  They have the volume to keep it that way."},{"name":"Panahar - Bangladeshi Place","address":"3375 Buford Hwy NE, Ste 1060","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Having lived in Philly for the past 4 years, I really loved finding a BYO in Atlanta since they're pretty few and far between.

The establishment is a small house with an extension porch that serves as seating. The seating is in a tight space so if you need space this is not the place. A table for two will require you to work in a very small space with little elbow room. I will tell you it is wise to make a reservation as this place is very busy. The hostess were awesome. They gave us a realistic expectation of when we could be seated (1 hr wait) and they work you in through reservations. You can dine at a table if there is roughly an hour available before the next reservation and you need to be mindful of the time as you will not get to over stay your seating. That's what you agree to with no reservation. It was totally ok for us as I said the space is tight and not the most intimate although it is quaint. \\n\\nWe stood in a tight space behind the people sitting at the bar. When I say tight I mean your will stand with your back against the wall so people can walk past you and the people sitting at the bar and not step on your feet. Once we were able to grab a seat at the bar the bartenders were awesome. So attentive and my drink was made perfectly. We would have opted to sit at the bar but if I didn't mention it before let me stress the space is tight. We didn't want people on top of us as we ate our meal so we opted to not dine at the bar and go with the work in between reservation. The overall atmosphere is cozy. \\n\\nWe were seated on the porch at a small table near the outer edge near the doors. They had a cute fire burning stove with gas logs I think burning and provided some nice heat. The food presentation was beautiful. My friend had the lobster fried rice and I had the soft shell crab dish served in a hollowed pineapple. My friend said the lobster fried rice was great. My fried soft shell crab wasn't the freshest and I felt the breading overpowered the taste of the crab meat. The jasmine rice I had was cooked to perfection and the taste was great along with the curry sauce from the pineapple. Our waitress was pleasant but not the greatest with her attention to our table. We had to request she clear off the table as it's small and doesn't afford much room for too many plates (4 at that time) and glasses. We also had to ask another waiter to get our waitress as she was busy with other tables and her attention span seemed stretched at times. \\n\\nOverall this experience was decent. The prices for the dishes seemed a little pricey but I understand for the area it's in line. I'll try this place again in the Summer with a reservation  but it won't be a go to spot for last minute dining. It's worth everyone trying it at least once."},{"name":"Pescatore","address":"158 Boston Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"My very first dining experience in Boston, and I was blown away!

Service was great."},{"name":"The Backspace","address":"507 San Jacinto St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Backspace had a very quiet baptism into the rapidly improving Austin dining scene, and one thing that has already got me agog is their  mercifully late kitchen hours.  \\n\\nI really loathe eating anytime before 9PM on 'dinner-as-an-event' night, and *truly*, fuck having to dine out in this town and be out of the restaurant at sundown (slight exaggeration, but you get the point).\\n\\nAccording to one energetic staff member, their loose closing time is 12:30, or when the dough finally runs out. As my wife and I were leaving the restaurant at 11PM on a Friday, it appeared that Backspace was still going strong for the night.\\n\\nThe space itself is really a nod to SF or Chicago side-street dining and the interior reflects that. The inside is considerably tiny -- about 10 tables, which are manipulated by the staff in various set-ups to accommodate differing group sizes, and an additional (and sizable) stainless steel bar that seats appx 10-12.  The advantage here, is that the bar has much more room for small plate apps and pizza boards, though sacrificing a bit of the 'cozy' factor.  It is plainly apparent to me now why Backspace doesn't take reservations. They can't.\\n\\nImmediately upon entrance, you will notice the gorgeous oven that looks amazingly proper behind the bar (-- which also serves as the entire kitchen/prep area). This thing is a machine! -- and it warms the complete restaurant, which is obviously awesome on a cold night like its been lately, but might make for a bit of discomfort in June and July.\\n\\nOne thing i found very cool right off the bat was their single tap of Peroni. I don't know really know many Italian beers, but i effin love me some Peroni (and especially Moretti). It appears they are going to rotate a singular tap between those two -- a clever touch, I thought.  Who needs a Fireman's 4 so desperately, anyway?\\n\\nThey have several apps that sound outstanding, but we skipped them on this night in favor of two green salads (the brussell sprouts w/ pancetta plate piqued our interest most).  But holy smokes, the salads were sweetly presented and tasted incredible. Backspace uses pickling vinegar as the house dressing (as you would find in a jar of Mezzetta) and it was just remarkable with pickled cauliflower and pickled sliced beets on field greens. Finally an inspired salad starter at an Austin establishment. Sheesh.\\n\\nWe ordered two pies -- The Bianca and (what should be the pi√®ce de r√©sistance of any true Neapolitan joint) The Margherita. We added prosciutto crudo on top of the margherita as that is my perfect pie (full disclosure here: I'm spoiled by Pizzeria Bianco's master chef Chris Bianco's margherita pie -- and have waited SEVERAL 3-hour stints in front of his restaurant for it). Both pies were truly outstanding. The Bianca's creaminess was nicely cut with the perfect amount of citrus-y arugula piled on top. The margherita was suitably moist in the middle without being dreadfully soggy (hi, House Pizzeria!), the crust was nice and chewy, the mozza noticeably fresh, and the prosciutto a beautiful endowment.\\n\\nWould I call it the best Neapolitan I've ever eaten? No. Not yet.  Simply, there are not enough bubbles and shaping is a bit off at this early stage. In regards to flavor, the pies were very memorable, but there is plenty of anticipatory room for improvement (to be fair, to which restaurant does this not apply?) when everything gets seasoned by experience a bit more. \\n\\nIf this is the foundation on which to jump off after only 3 weeks or so, they are in fantastic shape. I'll definitely be returning as it looks like Austin finally *FINALLY*  has a true Neapolitan pizza spot."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"really liked the bacon donut and the oreo one! it is not overly sweet but still very tasty. the original one is good too"},{"name":"Grindhouse Killer Burgers","address":"1842 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"too over hyped, I went here to get a burger and after a recommendation from a friend decided to try this place. the restaurant/bar is nice clean and the service is great. the burger i was a bit disappointed when i saw the size. the flavor is good, but the size didn't cut it for me.

It wasn't so smashingly amazing that we would return next time we're in Boulder (we were on vacation), but there were nice touches enough that I'd recommend checking it out.  It has a casual yet gourmet menu feel.  \\n\\nThe bartenders all looked really young - lol.  My husband and I split the Appetizer (\\"Contorni\\") of \\"Peperoni e Tonno\\": roasted red pepper rolled around a tuna-caper mixture.  They were tasty and fresh.  They were also $4.5 for 4 to 5 little rolls, so my husband was joking, that's $1 a bite :) \\n\\nWe then shared the pizza \\"Diavola provola di bufala-basil-salame piccante\\" for $14.  See that description?  The entire menu is like that.  The entire thing is in Italian and it's pretty confusing if you don't speak Italian.  The word descriptions help only because a lot of Italian words sound like English (as above in the example).

I've seen them all and if you know what to look for, they are painfully obvious. I was a regular at the old I Love Sushi on Cedar Hills. Then they moved to Hall, so I said what the heck, same people same food right? The answer is a resounding NO. Not to offend the other positive reviewers, but if you love this place than you aren't a sushi aficionado. They used to be Korean sushi focused and if you love Korean food you would have loved the place. I don't happen to be a Korean food fan but my sis lived in Korea for 18 months, and she was impressed by their food, especially their homemade kimchee. It wasn't dumbed down bland and barely spicy like the kimchee in the new place. I guarantee they now buy it in bulk at Owajimaya down the road since I have bought the exact same kimchee there (exactly once, it was bland, not at all spicy by Korean standards, and mushy).\\n\\nNow the conveyor belt side of the restaurant pumps out inexpertly prepared sushi from inexpert chefs. I compare it to the belt junk at Marinepolis. You can't tell the difference between the two. Just to be sure the place sucked, we tried the belt junk our second time. The first time we had to ask to be seated at the sushi bar which is partly hidden behind the divider int he middle of the main room. You would think ti was like the old place, but it wasn't quite as up to our expectations. More made up rolls, but not the quality of the old location. I wish these places would quit throwing 7 kinds of non-sushi on a roll with one kind of fish and charging a hell of a lot more for something with so many flavors they all disappear into mush in your mouth. Not to mention slathered with \\"sauce\\" which kills the flavors even more.\\n\\nHowever, the chef on the sushi bar side knew what he was doing, and might have been the owner for all I know. A couple Japanese gentlemen were twirling their cigars and lapping up stuff the chef evidently prepares on request, since it wasn't on the menu. Typical for these places if their food is decent, but I would have liked to see it on the menu, not just on their plates.\\n\\nBUT, the kitchen staff was unbelievably incompetent. They made every screwup in the book, from the wrong drinks (regular instead of diet coke, a completely different sake than what we had ordered), to the wrong food (a simple appetizer), and, after they finally figured out what we had actually ordered, brought out well after we had finished our meal. This is apparently not unusual for them - they screwed up two other table's orders while we were waiting, and that was just the nearby diners that we could overhear. Finally the apps and the miso were crappy and cold, I wouldn't order anything from their kitchen unless you like pedestrian Japanese.\\n\\nEven though our experience was pretty crappy, I can recommend heading right for the sushi counter and bugging the chef for the freshest stuff, it is worth the price. As far as the conveyor and the kitchen food - caveat emptor, my friend. See if you can him to stray off the menu, it's a common trick we use to get the better plates that aren't \\"Americanized\\" junk. So 3 stars for the \\"real\\" sushi bar & chef (still zero for the kitchen and servers)."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"YUM YUM YUM, I love coming here when im in Austin, after a day of kayaking this place hit the spot.

To wash it down, I had a mojito and hubby a margarita.  All yummy!\\n\\n~\\"Second course\\": We moved on to a smaller size \\"mariscos\\" (chicharrones de langostinos-- crispy golden prawns studded with quinoa, served with salsa agridulce) and a smaller size \\"platos de verduras\\" since at this point, I needed some greens! (esparragos peruanos-- grilled asparagus brushed with chimichurri).  I believe I ordered a glass of sparkling rose to go with this set.  Hubby felt that the quinoa breading on the prawns was a little too heavy, but I loved it! I thought it was an ingenious way of using quinoa and I am looking forward to trying it at home :)\\n\\n~At this point, the desserts looked intriguing, but we really has no more space in our bellies so I ordered them \\"to go\\" and shared with family back in Seattle the next day.

You go to the counter order your burger, drink, fries and find a seat...  You usually have a few minute wait, no biggie.  You get your burger & fries wrapped in paper and in a paper bag.  For the longest time, I thought it was pretty wasteful but now that I think about it, this place doesn't have any trash (literally, there is no trash can).  Everything you get as a customer is compostable, what a great idea.  Now no one has to do dishes and there is pretty much nothing to clean other than the cooking utensils and the gril every night.

The children's plates came first, then we had to wait much longer than I expected for our dishes. Probably because they were out of everything I originally wanted. Halfway through our meal my wife had to flag down our waitress for Parmesan, it wasn't offered at first. I didn't like my plate, it lacked in flavor and the tail-on jumbo shrimp seemed overcooked. My daughters really didn't touch their plates, but they are finicky eaters anyway.\\n\\nWe waited an exorbitant amount of time before we had to flag down the waitress again for our check. I was surprised to see we were charged for milk ($2.40 x 2). When I questioned the waitress, she sniped it says right here (pointing to the children's menu) \\"except juice and milk\\". Total wording stated: \\"Includes free refills, except juice and milk\\".  That is open to interpretation. I don't expect free refills on milk, but I do think it should be included in the price when worded like that.\\n\\nI didn't bother to complain.

It was lightly battered  really crispy chicken breast pieces, and it wasn't the usual tempura-ish batter I usually see at Chinese places.  Then the pieces of chicken were sprinkled with sesame seeds when they were still hot out of the batter, and then covered with a very thick, earthy, dark, and pleasantly sweet sauce.  I opted for steamed rice with that.  The crab rangoon came 4 to an order, and they were big triangles of wonton wrapper with the usual filling.  They were nicely browned, crispy, and not real greasy, despite being deep fried.  ~$10 total.\\n\\nI also got to taste the best hot n sour soup (each serving made to order) I've ever had, and the crispy chicken loin was freaking amazing.

My wife and I have been to Don Dario's several times.  We were there tonight (2/19/11)with my mom and I felt compelled to write this review after we left.  We ordered the beef fajitas and the Senorita Plate.  Our fajitas were a little tough this time and we weren't going to say anything.  Our waitress, Amy, happened to ask how they were since we slowed down on eating them.  I let her know that we thought they were a little tough but, it was no big deal.  Amy took care of it.  She let the manager on duty know and he handled it.  He offered to take them off of our bill, he offered to make us new ones, he was basically willing to do whatever it took to make sure that we were satisfied.  We took him up on his offer to remake our fajitas so that we would have some to take home since we didn't eat much of the first platter.  My wife, my mother and I were all surprised at how they handled it.  We will definitely be back and I'm sure it will all be great again.

The ownership is loud and irritating, and most of the staff seems stoned or confused. I ordered a 3 piece chicken meal when there were only 2 people in front of me and not even a single other person in the sitting area. I expected at least a 15 minute wait which is the norm there. I ended up waiting for 43 minutes. The guy behind the counter KNEW that it would take 40+ minutes because they had a large call-ahead order that showed up 20 minutes after I sat down. Common courtesy says to let people know about that, but neither of the two people ahead of me nor myself were informed. I work nearby so I have gotten their breakfast tacos in the past as well. Both times the chicken was undercooked on the inside and in one instance it was cold, pink, and mushy. Other employees at my office have complained of their orders being messed up frequently, and in one case more than once in a day! She called back to have them fix the order and they STILL screwed it up. The hallmark of food truck service is good and fast food. This was mediocre at best and I've never waited so long for three pieces of chicken and a roll that came out of a bag. Please don't waste your time here and go somewhere more respectable.

Until yesterday. I don't know if they're under new management or what, but I will not be recommending them for brunch as I have in the past.\\n\\nMy wife and I came in right around 10am and were pleasantly surprised that it wasn't as busy as usual for a weekend brunch, especially a 3-day holiday weekend. There was no one at the host stand, which had a sign reading \\"please seat yourself\\", so we did. We went out to the back patio to find 3 tables open (clean and ready to be seated), sat down, and about a minute later a server came by. I thought she was going to ask us what we'd like to drink, but instead she told us to get up and go back to the host stand to put our names on the list because there were people in front of us who would be seated first. This was all relayed in a very condescending tone, my wife and I have both worked many service jobs so we know exactly what that kind of tone means -- \\"how dare you try to cut in line\\" -- but we were just following regular restaurant etiquette.\\n\\nSo we get up, go back to the host stand, which still says \\"please seat yourself\\" and wait for someone to show up. Mind you, there are at least 6 front of house people on the clock milling about, but none that can be bothered to put us on \\"the list\\". There was no one else waiting and plenty of open tables. We decide to turn the sign over to \\"Please wait to be seated\\" since people are now filing in behind us and we don't want to be \\"skipped in line\\" again since there's actually a line now. The host finally shows up and asks for our name to put us on the list, inside or outside. We ask to be seated outside, at one of the 3 open tables that we already know are there because the sign said the wrong thing, and he didn't apologize and told us it shouldn't be more than a few minutes. This guy couldn't have been out of his teens and clearly had no idea what he was doing, but none of the other waitstaff could be bothered to help even though there were maybe 8 parties sat and plenty of servers to go around.\\n\\nHe finally took us back to our table, on the patio, and we asked if we could sit at one of the other two still open (the one they sat us at was next to a couple of dude bros shouting loudly and that wasn't the vibe we were going for) but the host just looked at the other table and didn't say anything?? \\n\\nThe whole experience was very bizarre, especially considering how many times I've been in the past and received great service. No one ever apologized and I thought maybe I just took it the wrong way, but the more I think about it, the more it seems incredibly fishy. I wonder if the fact that my wife and I are both women had something to do with it? This is Austin after all, and I don't encounter discrimination at restaurants generally but between the rude tone, straight up being ignored for five minutes, and not getting an apology, it really rubs me the wrong way."},{"name":"Top of the Hub","address":"800 Boylston St, Ste 52","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I normally do not write reviews for restaurants after a bad dining experience, but after my fiancee and I have eaten at nearly all of the top-rated restaurants in Boston--Dante (Cambridge), Zephyr (Cambridge), Fleming's Steakhouse (Boston), Capital Grille (Boston), North End (Strega, Lucca, Giacomo), Stella (South End)--and it was a very special occasion (her 26th birthday), I felt compelled and have earned the right to write this review.  To preface this review, I made my reservation on Opentable and made the request online to make it a special experience and next to a window because it was her birthday.  I even made the reservation 1 month 1/2 in advance.  I also had Boston Coach chauffeur us to the restaurant.  I thought it would be the perfect celebration given the amazing views, service, and cuisine.  But, boy, were we in for something different.  \\n\\nNone of my requests were met. Our night started out in dissatisfaction when we were seated a row away from the window seating.  After our first request to be moved to a window table, our server told us that we should get in line and the wait would be another 45 minutes for a window table.  She suggested that we could go to the bar and have a drink before our meals. How crass I thought?  I told her I made the request a month-and-a-half in advance, it was my fiancee's birthday, we had a driver transport us to the restaurant, all to no avail.  My fiancee told me it was fine, and we could just sit where we were, but I could tell she was disappointed.\\n\\nSo we decided to stay put; however when we saw 3 open tables open up near the window, I decided to ask again.  I thought for sure with the vacancy near the windows, our special occasion, and our reservations made nearly 2 months in advance, they would move our seating.  Yet, when I asked another server, he said with rather Italian accent that they \\"never accomodate requests for window seating--for no one,\\" but he said he would ask a manager and see if it was possible.  Our server and the one asked returned, and they told us that could not do it, even though 4 tables (now) were open, because they were going to be seating those soon, and once we \\"started eating\\" we could not be reseated. How unhelpful the service was I thought.  I was not aware that it was against restaurant policy and code to move a party once they had started eating for a special request. I reiterated my plea that it was her birthday, the reservations were made a long time ago, but all I recieved was the same response except stronger now: NO!\\n\\nNow onto the meals.  While we watched longingly as 5 tables vacated, we were served our Spicy Lobster Soup, sub-par at best.    It was not spicy, too creamy (it felt like we were just drinking heavy cream), and the bowl and plate lacked any creative garnish.  The salmon was bland, certainly not worth their asking price of $28.  Chef Ramsey of Hell's Kitchen would have been up-in-arms about it and dumped it in the trash.  My fiancee's dish, the lamb, was cooked but flavorless.  Overall, neither great service, nor cuisine, and, for that, we declined dessert at the same time and asked for the check.\\n\\nThe final disgrace came with the bill.  Our server had the gall to say, \\"have a great birthday,\\" to my fiancee as I was autographing my name on a $110 Bill.  How rude, how terrible I thought.  It was as if they had not listened to a single thing we said the entire night.  I thought fine dining was about excellent service and cuisine, and the Top of the Hub delivers on neither.

I have to say, a fair bit better than MoJo's, just down the street, about the same cost, and free refills on your coffee (which you don't get at MoJo).\\n\\nThe decor is very classy, with lots of original art, crystal lighting, and a cool bar with three TVs.  There's a second dining room in back that will hold about 40 and looks to be capable of private events (with a continuation of the decor).\\n\\nOverall, I'm very optimistic and will be back to try for dinner soon.

I had a good laugh because here is a guy who refuses to eat most veggies (claim they mess with his stomach) and thoroughly destroyed the sweet potatoes and broccoli (not sure if Bok Choy or Chinese Broccoli...definitely not regular broccoli). My mom and I shared the Seafood Melange; which is black squid pasta in a slightly spicy cream sauce with a mix of scallops, shrimp, etc. and the Fried Chicken (which I had had prior and knew would impress the folks). So much flavor in these dishes. Chicken perfectly crispy like I like it. The greens were a little sweet as pointed out by my mother. We both liked them but for some that may be unexpected/unwanted. The Melange is quite delicious. Hard to describe the flavor but I'd say it's like an Asian Vodka Sauce type of taste. Needless to say everyone enjoyed their eats. \\n\\nNow I footed the bill which stung a little but you gotta start to repay the parents as some point. That being said, I really think this spot is somewhere between 2 and 3 dollar signs leaning more towards 3 even though Yelp claims 2. Do I think it is worth it...hmmm...sorta. But if the traffic this place gets now dictates then maybe i'm just too frugal. For those of you that like me have a hard time paying $30 for an entree (and the portions are not large imho) I encourage you to come at lunch time. Their prices are quite a bit different and I don't feel as though the portions are that much less. The cost is probably the only thing that keeps me from giving this place 5 stars.\\n\\nBy the way, the services has always been good from Day 1. I do miss seeing the black owner around (I believe he was the face while the asian gentleman is/was the chef). I have never seen the 3rd owner. Anywho, I will continue to rout for this place and come for special occasions."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Awesome food and vibe.

The broth was deep in flavours and it wasn't overly salty. It was also sprinkled with lots of onions, green onions and cilantro - I love it when they aren't stingy on cilantro! I had the steak and tendon for toppings. The steak was tender and thicker cut, which gave more meat subsidence and it seemed like a decent amount given. The tendon was flavorful, soft and a nice jelly texture. Finally, the noodles were perfectly al dente - chewy and had a lovely bite texture. Of course, complimentary fresh bean sprouts, juicy limes, jalape√±os, and the mythical red chilis (not many places give these). \\n\\nIn the end, my belly was full and my hunger was K.O'd into a food coma. The service was friendly and quick. They accept credit cards and there is plenty of free parking. There's a patio outside, I wonder if they'd open it up for pho in the summer!

Didnt care for the duck and olive crocchette. The best part was indeed the pasta, I had the squid ink trottelle with crab and shishito. I did feel it was oversalted which took away from it, I dont mind the salty dishes but it needs a balance and it absolutely distracted from\\nThe crab and pasta. I also could have done without the shishito, felt it over complicated the dish and it didnt need it. Oh! The panna cotta was real good, friend started sticking his spoon into before I could snag a picture. On the positive the restaurant is very cozy and the service was great. Prosecco was served in cups which was kinda cute. I prefer flutes always but the gimmick is a nice attempt at fun and casualness and it worked.

The hostess told us 10-15 minutes wait time for a table but did not offer to let us sit at the bar.  45 minutes later we were seated, not a big deal, these things happen, the restaurant does not control how fast people get up when they are done.  However, several minutes after we had been seated,  we had to ask for water from one of the servers pouring water at an EMPTY table next to us while our water glasses stood dry having never been filled.  Whistles wet, we now ordered food and drink. 20 minutes later the house made ginger beer arrives at the table (we were still waiting on the other cocktail we ordered).  The \\"ginger\\" beer was nothing more than old lime and soda water, an embarrasment, I dont know who considers day old limes with brown edges and soda water to be a ginger beer but apparently thats what the people at Leaf think because they tried to charge us for it once we received our bill.  I'll sum up the highlights of the rest of our experience... falafel on the benedict was oversalted and overseasoned to the point of being inedible, egg scramble arrived without vegan sausage.  We spent over 2 hours at leaf due to the delays.  The staff communicated very little to us about the problems, did not apologize for the mistakes, and charged us full price in spite of the mistakes.  I worked several years as a food runner and a server (and so has the rest of my family with me at the time) and frankly the level of personal accountability and hustle was so sorely lacking from this establishment as to be an embarrasment to the rest of us.  The servers even complained about it being a busy morning to the table next to us... sweetie please, this was the end of brunch/lunch shift, complain at 2 am after working your 3rd double shift in a row, not after 4 hours of \\"labor\\".

In keeping with the local \\"working class\\" image they're putting out, they feature a bunch of taps from local craft breweries (33 Acres, Howe Sound).  They usually have draft Merridale cider available as well - one of the better BC craft cideries. Also, the place is just around the corner from both Brassneck and Main St. Breweries, two blocks from 33 Acres, and very close to the lively Mt.

As far as lunch or dinner, I have never eaten here that was any better than just \\"acceptable,\\" and some of it has been far worse than that.  Recently I found myself not able to eat the dish that I ordered.  This particular item was just downright unpleasant and I just couldn't stomach it, which is just not something that should occur at a restaurant.  Although I'm a bit of a foodie, I'm not a picky eater and I can't remember ever returning food before.  I don't think this should happen at any restaurant that took a basic pride in its food.  The kicker was they charged me for the dish, despite asking if it was OK and me having to tell the server that it was not.  \\n\\nIf you look closely you'll notice that this place is kind of dirty.  The furniture, etc... is really shabby and worn-down, which is in keeping with the hipster vibe.  Fruit flies abound.  All in all, it's a fun bar but a poor restaurant.

It's only a few years old and can be found on the north side of Cabbagetown Park, on the ground level of what looks like a modest-sized home.  The store specializes in single serving size desserts and cafe beverages, such as coffees and teas.\\n\\nCupcakes and cake pops are among the business' most popular items.  They're baked fresh in-house every day and flavors rotate daily.  Sweet Cheats likes to refer to their cake pops as \\"Cruffles.\\"\\n\\nOn any given day, you might see roughly 15 different cupcakes and 15 different cake pops beautifully presented and available for immediate purchase from behind a glass display.  Examples of other goodies for sale are brownies, cookies, macarons, cheesecakes, chocolate mousse cups, and fruit tarts.  Some of the non-sweet stuff consists of bread products like bagels, muffins, English muffins, croissants, and breakfast sandwiches.\\n\\nSeveral coffee beverages are offered, iced or hot, such as espresso, latte, and mocha.  There are steamers (flavored steamed milk), teas (e.g. chai tea), and fancy or \\"gourmet\\" hot chocolate.  Also, there's always special or seasonal sweets and beverages to try, such as hot apple cider in the winter.  Each time you visit, it seems like there's always something new on the chalkboard.\\n\\nThe prices at Sweet Cheats are comparable to other Atlanta area specialty cupcake shops, meaning they aren't cheap.  A single cupcake is $4, a half dozen is $23, and one dozen is $40.  Cake pops are $2 each, $12 for a half dozen, and $24 for a dozen (no discounts if you buy more).  Expect to spend about $3-4 for a caffeinated drink.\\n\\nI've tried many of Sweet Cheats' creations.  In general, the desserts are indeed very sweet -- admittedly, almost too sweet for me, but I'm not a big sweets person.  Though flavors vary, the cupcakes (and other treats) seem to be quite rich and decadent.  No corners are cut and I don't believe any artificial ingredients are used in the recipes.  It's all real eggs, butter, cream, and sugar.\\n\\nSweets I've tried include:\\nSweet & Sinful cupcake\\nCreamy Crunchy Bliss cupcake\\nSweet & Sinful cake pop\\nBlueberry macaron\\nHeath bar cheesecake\\n\\nThe \\"Sweet & Sinful\\" cupcake is a cheesecake-flavored cupcake with shortbread cookie, a strawberry, and a strawberry buttercream cheese icing.  It's slightly \\"lighter\\" than the other cupcakes.  Its cake pop counterpart is equivalent to putting the cupcake cake portion on a stick and dipping it in chocolate.  No strawberry or icing, but the rest of the flavors are replicated.  Both the cupcake and cake pop are delicious.\\n\\nThe \\"Creamy Crunchy Bliss\\" cupcake is a white and chocolate cupcake with Oreo bits baked in.  On top is an Oreo cookie and a buttercream cheese icing.  It's addictive, luscious, and succulent.\\n\\nThe blueberry macaron I tried was very good.  I wouldn't put it among the best macarons I've tried in Atlanta, but it's right behind.  Perhaps it's because I ordered the macaron towards the end of the day when it wasn't as fresh.  Either way, one thing I noticed about Sweet Cheats' macarons is they are bigger than the average macaron.  The macaron had great flavor, though I wasn't completely sold on it due to its relatively harder/firmer consistency.  Don't let that steer you away though.  If you're a fan or macarons, try one.\\n\\nThe Heath bar cheesecake is stellar.  It's hard to go wrong with crunchy chunks of toffee and milk chocolate melded together with tasty, creamy cheesecake.  Of the sweets I've mentioned in this review, I recommend both the Heath bar cheesecake and the Creamy Crunchy Bliss cupcake.  Good stuff.\\n\\nThe beverages aren't bad.  I've tried some of the seasonal drinks such as the pumpkin pie mocha in the fall and the caramel apple latte.  I really enjoyed the caramel apple latte.  It's soothing/refreshing and not overly sweet.  The pumpkin pie mocha could've used some work.  I could taste the pumpkin pie, but the drink was too bitter.\\n\\nLike other local dessert shops, Sweet Cheats has sturdy, stylish, and functional to-go containers for all of their sweets, down to containers tailor-made to store and protect single cupcakes.  The business also ships (minimum order one dozen cupcakes) and delivers (minimum order $40).\\n\\nThe store space is intimate and casual.  It works well as a meet-up spot for small groups.  Free Wi-Fi is available (password: sweet9512).  Free parking can be found in the small parking lot behind the building or along any of Cabbagetown's residential roads.\\n\\nService is great.

The sweet potato souffl√© was average but good and served as my dessert for my meal.  \\nThe only negative feedback I can offer is that some of the staff were a smidge negative and there seemed to be some drama in the restaurant that evening.

I liked the flavor of the broth, the consistency of the noodles, and everything else that was included with the ramen (egg, pork, cabbage, bean sprouts, wakame). The broth was quite thick though, and towards the end it got to be a bit too heavy and salty for me. I still powered through anyway since it was so delicious."},{"name":"Merrill & Co.","address":"1 Appleton St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Went at 7:30 with two companions.  This is a very trendy, young and upscale crowd.  The food is mostly small tapas style dishes to share.  The lighting is dim and the ambiance is loud.\\n\\nWe started in round one with the hamachi crudo, the uni french bread, the farmers salad and the golden tilefish.  The kitchen was careful to send the dishes out one by one, which was a pleasant surprise.\\n\\nThe hamachi crudo was delightful, a light sprinkling of sea salt and an unidentified bit (mushroom?) on each piece elevated it from straight up sashimi.  One of our favorites for the whole evening.\\n\\nThe uni french bread followed, lightly toasted and buttered french bread with pimento and a thin layer of uni across the top. Completely unlike uni in your favorite sushi bar, but you still had the flavor of the uni.\\n\\nNext was the farmers salad, which was surprisingly delightful.  The dressing was savory and touched every element without pooling in the bowl.  The asparagus had been shaved with a mandolin, to good effect.\\n\\nThe golden tilefish was next, we ordered this (instead of fried oysters) on the strong recommendation of our server.  Most like a sea bass or rock fish, this was served on a bed of black mushrooms with a soft-poached egg.  We asked for and got some toast to soak up the last bits and you will too! \\n\\nI was drinking the st. ambrose oatmeal stout, and my companions shared a flight of sherry, and then both got one of the house signature cocktails: the pimm's cup slushie (rum, ginger, mint, citrus).  \\n\\nWe ordered another round starting with the catfish croquette.  Three pieces were delivered, and This was tasty but not as light as the earlier dishes.  While I finished my portion, my companions did not.\\n\\nNext was the pork belly, predictably fabulous, but the dill yogurt sauce and caramelized baby carrots that accompanied the dish would have been a winning dish by themselves.\\n\\nWe ended the savory part of the meal with the burgers.  We received three pretty little sliders with a fat and generous patty.These were a little disappointing, coming out overcooked and without any pizazz.  I finished mine, but my companions did not.\\n\\nWe shared the chocolate nutella torte, which was surprisingly tasty, with just a bit of crunch from the flaky crust.\\n\\nDown one star for the burger, the catfish, and the fact we couldn't hear each other."},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We love Frank.

The huevos rancheros are pretty delicious! And very filling! I ate it all! They also have hot sauce at the table. The banana caramel French toast is so good you savor every single bite!

Not a fantastic selection of beer, and it's all bottled. Then we realized there were lines out the door here on weekends, and I checked Yelp only to find that ALL reviews were for breakfast. For the price and how good it tastes, definitely worth it. We did the whole wait-45-minutes-thing one morning; I got waffles with fruit (which was a heaping, fresh portion!) and the boyfriend got an egg sandwich. Both were delicious and reasonable (about $10-$15 each with non-alcoholic drinks). They had a special for mimosas that day too, I think $5 a glass?

We called \\"no pick up orders until 9:30pm\\" so we called back at 9:30pm \\"the kitchen is closed now\\" and on top of that, when we told the hostess that she had told us we could order after 9:30pm she said \\"I don't know who told you that, but that's not true\\" ...uhh you told us that 2 hours prior...\\n\\nHuge mistake on my part for depending on them for dinner tonight because now everything else I could eat was closed. \\n\\nSo I asked to speak to a manager and spoke with Jesus. He was kind enough to listen to my frustrations, apologize, and explain the new hours & rules. I wish I had spoken to him earlier. He also promised to speak to the hostess and get to the bottom of this mixup and fix it (only time will tell if he'll keep his word on that front). He offered to put in an order for hot food for us, on the house since we had waited almost 2 hours to order and we're scrambling to make dinner plans. I honestly don't know how to feel about all of this, but he says he's new to the company so maybe under new management things will get better. \\n\\nOne added star for his empathy and willingness to fix the situation. I hope this review can end up at 5 stars one day because I do truly love the food and it's one of the things I can actually eat out (I have an extensive list of food allergies & sensitivities), plus it's closest to us than any other restaurant... but right now I'm still a bit skeptical. We'll see. \\n\\n--------\\n\\nPREVIOUS:\\n\\n2 stars mainly because between Nova and Katana, Katana definitely has the better tasting sushi. \\n\\nBut literally every time we've gone or interacted with a worker at Katana, it's been terrible customer service. Here's just two of the worst experience we've had out of the many examples we have: \\n\\n1) We clearly state and emphasize that I'm allergic to sesame and ask for a California roll without sesame seeds. Easy, right? No other sushi place mixes this up, but Katana has mixed it up twice. Which would usually be okay except for the fact that the second time this happened, they tried to PICK OFF the sesame seeds from the roll instead of remake a new one. I insisted on a new one and it was obvious that annoyed the workers. PLUS the restaurant was empty and we were made to wait for our food while the waiters finished their conversation at the bar... even after the mix up they were talking and laughing away while the roll was sitting there ready to be brought to our table. My boyfriend was already done with his roll by the time my new roll got to the table. I had to stand up, walk up to them at the bar and say something to them. This was the worst experience and it was obvious that the waitress didn't care.\\n\\n2) Every time we call to order pick up, usually between 8-9pm, we're told that we can't order until 9:30pm. That's fine. We call back at 9:30pm and are told that they did last call and that we can't order... what? This has happened multiple times and it's extremely frustrating. Doesn't matter if it's Wednesday or Saturday, busy or empty. We've called and been told that they can't take pick up orders because they're busy. So we begrudgingly come in and end up being the only 2 people sitting down in the entire restaurant...We live 2 minutes away and prefer to have our sushi dinner at home, but apparently they don't care and would rather lie to not have to service someone. \\n\\nI could go on, but for the price we're paying I expected at least decent customer service. We're going to start trying other places in the area and hopefully find a replacement."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"A bit of background: I am from Seattle so we don't have many places like this.

Both fun and friendly, personable and talkative! Awesome dudes!!! Yes we're off to a good start. The two women at the front made sure we were seated, even though we were 45 minutes early. We sat downstairs, amongst the energy of the restaurant, and  three minutes later we are greeted by Brian, our server. ASK FOR BRIAN'S SECTION WHEN YOU GO!!!! The BEST server EVER!!! He filled our water glasses and promptly  took our drink order. We had The Castaway, coconut, spiced rum, pineapple, fresh ginger and lemon. Brian's knowledge and description of the food made us taste it even before we got it! Our appetizers: Salmon Chips, homemade chips smeared with chipotle cream cheese and tipped with flaked smoked salmon mixed with red onion and lemon juice then topped with just the right amount of capers. Second appetizers: Shaved Calamari, lightly fried with a cilantro aioli drizzle. Literally made our taste buds dance! The server assistant, Jacqueline, brought us our appetizers and had amazing stories to tell us of all the fantastic food and desserts she had tried. She was the BEST also...and like Brian, a real foodie, which was refreshing. \\n\\nThey have amazing entr√©es and are known for their slow roasted brisket. Sounded so DELISH but when Brian described the big ass burger (and yes, that's the name), we sat there in amazement. The burger: ground SHORT RIBS, lettuce, tomato, red onion, ketchup and pickles...with succulent homemade onion rings with light batter so the onion was prevalent and sweet. Wonderfully delicious. Also, we ordered a side of Gouda grits!!!!!  WHAT???? Grits made with my frikkin favorite cheese??? GOUDA!!!!! Are you kidding me???? The taste of the Gouda with the grits made it irresistible. My bestie and I could not stop feasting.\\n\\nDESSERT TIME!  They have a pastry chef so all desserts, including ice cream and sorbets, are made fresh in the restaurant. We ordered the peach crisp, which normally comes with bourbon ice cream, but we opted to get the vanilla instead. Sinfully delicious and the perfect end to a perfect dinner. The service was so great that we asked Brian to get the manager. The manager Andrew, recently in a bike accident and  equally as awesome as Brian and Jacqueline, came over and we gushed about our awesome dinner but most importantly the amazing staff.

OK, I know some people look down on \\"Americanized\\" Chinese Food, but I kind of consider it a \\"category of its own\\", and I like it for what it is.  Anyway, I was careful to not order anything that's included in their \\"Combination Dinners\\" because those items are usually already made in advance and kept warm and ready to serve.  I ordered Vegetable (Meatless) Foo Young and House Lo Mein. . .two items that I know would need to be freshly made.  The Vegetable Foo Young was very good!  We got three big freshly made patties that were grilled just right. . .not too pale and not too browned.  The House Lo Mein consisted of thin noodles stir fried with beef, chicken, shrimp, BBQ pork, and veggies.  It was loaded with ingredients and the serving was large.  Our meals included steamed rice and hot tea.  Everything was quite tasty and service was friendly. . .we enjoyed dinner very much."},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"461 N Central Ave","city":"Hapeville","stars":"4","text":"Well, it's your typical Chick-Fil-A, but not really your typical Chick-Fil-A because it is, after all, the first Chick-Fil-A ever.\\n\\nThey offer the same awesome service that you'd get at any other chick-fil-a location, but you add the fact that this place opens 24 hours/day (except Saturday when they close at 10 pm and they don't open Sundays) so you never have to worry about having a chick-fil-a craving at odd hours of the day.\\n\\nThey have free WiFi and they also offer food that you won't find at your typical Chick-Fil-A and they have two sections for dining.

What is all the hype and long lines I always see about?\\n\\nThe family (Wife, kids, Brother) and I decided to venture into Portland for the afternoon to be \\"tourists for a day\\".  We opted to hit up both Voodoo and Big-Ass Sandwiches truck which are across the street from each other.\\n\\nI already knew the line for Voodoo would be an hour or more long and I kept telling the family, no doughnut is worth an hour wait.  I don't care, it's not worth an hour wait.  \\n\\nIt just so happened the wait at Big-Ass was the same today (around 1:00 p.m. arrival) but we split up and luckily received both orders at the same time.  \\n\\nWe sat down at the picnic tables Voodoo offers and other than the homeless guy digging through the trash can eating previously eaten doughnuts, the stay was comfortable.  A nice couple from Indiana joined us, which made for some nice conversation.\\n\\nI ordered the Maple Bacon Doughnut and the \\"Cock N' Balls\\".\\n\\nFor those of you who decide Bacon on a doughnut is something you cannot stomach and shouldn't be on doughnuts and verbally make it known on Yelp, I say your palate isn't refined enough to post reviews to begin with.\\n\\nAlso keep in mind, Have you ever had breakfast consisting of Pancakes with Bacon and Eggs?  If so, then why are you against a a Voodoo Bacon Maple Doughnut.  Afterall, doesn't the maple syrup you put on your pancakes, sometimes run over onto your bacon?  Enough said!\\n\\nI found my Maple Bacon Doughnut to be Heavenly.  This yeast raised doughnut with a sweet maple glaze and two strips of smokey bacon to be perfect.  The doughnut was soft, the glaze not overly sweet and the bacon cooked nicely.  The whole doughnut was creamy and buttery.  I will definitely order this again.  The saltiness and smokiness of the bacon complimented the maple glaze perfectly.  This is a must have if you visit Voodoo.\\n\\nMy \\"Cock N' Balls\\" err I mean Voodoo's Cock N' Balls doughnut is about the size of two \\"log\\" doughnuts covered in chocolate and filled with a triple cream filling.  I was too stuffed from the Big-Ass sandwiches (you can find my review on their Yelp page) and the bacon doughnut to dig into this, but I will enjoy it later and will post more.\\n\\n**Update** Just dug into the Cock N' Balls.  Chewy, Chocolate goodness with triple cream oozing from the sides when your mouth bites down.  I'm not a huge chocolate fan, so curious how this would be with a different frosting, hmmmmmmm.\\n\\nI didn't try any of their other doughnuts, but future visits will change that.\\n\\nThe only thing keeping me from giving Voodoo 4 or 5 stars is my lack of trying their other doughnuts and the Hour Long Wait.  However I understand they are open 24 hours a day and have another location across the river which is not as busy, so I may venture over to the 3rd Ave location during the Midnight hour and if the lines are short and the other doughnuts are tasty, I will update with 4-5 stars."},{"name":"La Antioquena Restaurant","address":"3861 Lake Emma Rd","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is fantastic!

When the guy asked me how many were in my party, I told him there were two of us and that we'd be happy to sit at the bar if needed. He proceed to tell me how busy they were and that there were actually many people ahead of us waiting next door. Since I had a time constraint, I asked how many people were ahead of us and about how much time he though it would be before we were seated. He proceeded to tilt his ironic trucker hat back in disgust, point at the list in front of him and inform me in a snide tone, \\"It's the weekend, here, you know.\\"\\n\\nI informed him that indeed I knew it was the weekend and that I would be celebrating this fact elsewhere.

It's one of the finest and best preserved elementary schools in Portland, and I love that there are multiple bars, smoking lounges and pools in such a large building. McMenamins did a great job overhauling it for public use, and I appreciate their efforts to preserve historic buildings all over Oregon (and now even outside of Oregon). \\n\\nMy honest opinion of McMenamin's food and beer is three stars, and is the same pretty much across all of their locations. Their beer is good, though they've been making some of the same stuff for decades and it's obvious. I like to change it up and get a Rubinator (Ruby and Terminator Stout mixed), and some of their seasonals are pretty unique. Otherwise, just like Rogue and Full Sail, their standards aren't terribly exciting especially in a city that is world renowned for craft beer. \\n\\nThe last time I went a few days ago, they were running some specials for J. R. R. Tolkien's birthday and I got the Return of the King burger. It came with a side of cajun tots, which are admittedly the best item on the menu. The burger was pretty solid, though doesn't really stand out all that much from other places. Our service was friendly but hectic. There really wasn't a host stand to get a table and we had to seat ourselves, then our server was overworked and a bit frazzled. It all worked out though, and we got our food and drinks in a reasonable amount of time. \\n\\nThey apparently also have soaking pools and a cigar lounge. I haven't been to the pools but I did smoke a cigar in the lounge (I think it was called Detention). The cigars were reasonably priced as were the drinks, though the room was fairly small. A great place to relax and smoke in a nice, calm environment. \\n\\nI'll be back to Kennedy School even though I'm not the biggest fan of the food or drinks.

The service and atmosphere were still good but the execution of the food was mediocre at best. \\n\\nThree examples follow:\\n\\n1) A hamburger ordered medium-rare was brutalized - cooked to beyond well done. The bun was not toasted and was crumbly. For nearly $20 (with avocado and a fried egg) it was one of the worst burgers-to-value we have experienced in Portland. A $4 burger at Little Big Burger is much much better. \\n\\n2) The French dip was completely unacceptable. The meat was cooked to beyond recognition and was cut thick and therefore somewhat chewy. This was one of the worst French dips we have ever eaten. Arby's is better by far. \\n\\n3) The house smoked salmon was more like salmon jerky - chewy and dry. As a result the salt content was exaggerated and was quite unpleasant. Very disappointing to say the least. \\n\\nI am hopeful that these are just transitional issues with a new head chef.

Once they took our name they told us that we had a choice of waiting in the waiting area or go walk around the town and they would call us when our table was ready. The waiting area was a small bar with a lounge like area with tables. We decided to sit at a table in the lounge area. Abby was so wonderful and came to see if we needed any appetizers or drinks. We ordered 2 glasses of Moscato, salted baked shrimp and lobster. The food was really great and the wine was even better we just ordered a whole bottle.

When our server Rebecca did come to take our orders she was so shocked and confused that we had put the wine in the water glasses and just would not let it go. When ordering the main course I ordered for my boyfriend and I. I ordered the scallops and the sword fish. Rebecca did not say anything about sides or asked me if we needed anything else. Rebecca took our order and ran. The portions of our food were very small and I do not think that the service or the portion of the food was worth how much we spent.

Big windows, you can see through people eating. Sort of inviting. There's a patio with some people.\\n \\n \\nIntro: I enter in, and the restaraunt design hasnt changed much, the bar is still smack in the center, with surrounding tables all around. I come in, and the bartender is chatting away at whomever is at the bar to bother notice me there. A half minute later, a waitress comes by and seats me, almost exactly where I was last time! I get a menu, laminated, and... a wine list on a crumpled up piece of paper. What was THAT about? Were they trying to be decorative? Can you AFFORD to make more photocopies? They're still selling Vietnamese food here, although a bit more upscale then when I was here when it was Saigon.\\n \\n \\nD√©cor: It's actually pretty bland. The walls are boringly painted I find. The table Im at is uneven. I put my foot down on the base on the floor to stop it from wobbling, the waitress comes by and fixes it. Steel chairs, not bad.\\n \\n \\nClientele: A mix of all types. Mostly upscale though. \\n \\n \\nService: 2 waitresses seem to serve me, alternating.

Oh, and I DIDNT use the water bowl. haha.\\n \\n \\nMain Course! \\n \\n \\nFor the main course, I get the Pho Bo, which is a rice noodle soup with beef slices, brisket, meat balls, assorted herbs and  bean sprouts. In an interesting \\"Thanks for thinking of that\\" moment, they put the bean sprouts on a seperate plate beside the soup. I didn't wind up putting any of them in. The soup, when I get it, smells very lemongrassy, sort of weak noodle smelly, and didn't really smell all that great. When I tried the noodles though, they actually tasted not all that bad. the meat in it was, as predictably, boiled tasting and not great, but the broth was sure spicy. It actually was a nice combo of 3 different things into one. I don't finish it, the broth is a bit much after awhile.\\n \\n \\nI\\nAfter:Waitress brings the bill on a nice plate.. And curiously, a business card. They might have suspected something when I took a pic of the shortribs haha.\\n \\n \\nTOTAL OF BILL: $20.87\\n \\n \\nWas it worth it? Not really actually.

The oysters ranged in size from itty bitty to scary big and were just ok. The one clam on the plate was ok. The mussels were dry and the shrimp looked like they came out of a frozen bag from Kroger (no offense to Kroger here- fine at home but not at a seafood restaurant!)  This is basic stuff that a seafood place shouldn't screw up.

In this random box, you get a dozen (I think) donuts and they make the assortment for you.

I would say the observation deck on the 50th floor offers a nearly identical view.  I would expect that a restaurant this class and elegance would serve us fresh food made to order.  The oysters were marginally fresh but still good...not great, just good.  We ordered beef carpaccio.  It arrived and almost immediately she says she doesn't want to eat it.  I look and agree, we probably shouldn't eat carpaccio that is dry and stuck to the plate, and the arugula was wilted and about to start turning yellow.  I'm not sure when it was made but I doubt it was made that day.  We let our server know of the problem when he returned to our table and he took it away slamming the plates loudly as he gathered them up from the table.  I was irritated by the noise but ready to order a different appetizer.  My wife had never been here and she always wanted to eat here.  She looks at me and says \\"I don't like the service here, the food isn't fresh, the server is rude and has an attitude.  I really appreciate you thinking to bring me here but let's just get the check and go to C****** G****\\"  We did get the check and leave having only had drinks and one mediocre appetizer.  The only thing the Top of the Hub has going for it is the view.  A restaurant with the same quality of service and food would die at street level and nobody would ever miss it.  Management did want to speak with us about our experience.  After they heard about it, they tried to encourage us to stay and we declined.  They promised when we return, they would take very good care of us.  It is a nice gesture but I really do not think we will come back.  You would be much better off not going to Top of the Hub but visiting the observation deck instead and then eat somewhere producing much better food and serving it with exceptional service at ground level."},{"name":"Broder Caf√©","address":"2508 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Broder is adorable and delicious!

I got out-voted on sending it back. The salmon plate had barely enough salmon to cover one piece of bread, so it was $14 for 4 bites of salmon, a hunk of cream cheese & veggies. Pretty outrageous. The pancakes were good, and the fried chicken sandwich was also heavy on the bread & light on chicken. I don't mind shelling out for a great meal, but at portions at Laundrette have shrunk to the level where the price is not justified. We essentially paid over $50 for a carb meal.

The staff running the floor loved Journey or maybe 80's music in general. I always get a kick out of youngin's liking the music of my generation like it's their own. Anyhew, after reading one review that mentioned the drink 'The Whole Enchilada' I had to have it. I love spice, I love bloody marys and this was soooo good. I had to have a second (did I mention we were on a walking vacation?) We started with a waffle fry nacho, nice change from the traditional tortilla chips, fries were hot and crisp, toppings were plentiful and tasty. We were undecided which dog to order and our waiter recommended the Moontan (off the specials menu), which is what the hubby ordered. I ordered the Sonoran Dog. I wish I had ordered the Moontan. Not because my dog wasn't good, but because the Moontan was so dang good, the sausage was some of the best I ever had. I would recommend if you order the Sonoran ask for it on a plate. It came to me in a basket and when I tried to use a fork and knife (because of all the toppings) the whole thing rolled over on its side and I almost lost toppings to the table. (Three second rule right? (it had nothing to do with the first Whole Enchilada I swear)) . \\n\\nTo end this excellent early dinner we ordered  the flourless chocolate torte.

That was not correct and it heavily impacted Melanie's meal.\\n\\nShe also ordered the Tomato Basil Soup and when I heard that, I ordered one too. She didn't care for hers because she thought it was too thick, more like a marinara sauce. I, on the other hand, thought the soup was awesome just the way it was. Bold, hearty and full of flavor - they could've served it in a 55-gallon drum and I wouldn't have been disappointed.\\n\\nI ordered the Blackened Flounder with Flat-Top Mac & Cheese and Potato Salad. The fish was cooked exactly the way that I like it - flaky and tender, yet still juicy and not dry. The blackening was just the right amount, enough to add a little kick without overwhelming the natural flavors of the fish. The Flat-Top Mac & Cheese held no surprised other than it was tossed on a grill for a few minutes but that in itself made it different. The Potato Salad might have been a bit too creamy for me, but I enjoyed the taste and flavor.\\n\\nI think this one ended up being a split decision.

During this visit, my boyfriend and I were subjected to unequal treatment and highly unprofessional conduct by the manager/owner, James. Prior to this occasion, I had visited the restaurant on at least 10 occasions. Up until most recently, the food and service was always excellent. I would even say that it was one of my favorites in Atlanta. \\n\\nDuring this visit, the food was good and our waitress, A.J., was pleasant. However, from the moment that we walked in the door, the manager, James, was condescending and unprofessional. And, he judged my boyfriend based on his appearance. We did not have a reservation, but we were willing to be patient and wait for available seating. Approximately 45 minutes after waiting, my boyfriend asked James the approximate wait time. He stated in a dismissive tone, \\"a long time.\\" When my boyfriend asked how long, he refused to give an answer and ignored him. At approximately 8:45 p.m., a table became available because of a cancellation. We were seated. We ordered an appetizer, drinks, and entrees. At approximately 9:15 p.m., the waitress brought the check without asking us if we wanted dessert. So, I asked for a dessert menu. (I love dessert.) \\n\\nShe told me that the manager, James, told her NOT to give us a dessert menu because we needed to be gone by 9:30 p.m. I was shocked to be told that I could not order anything else from the menu and that we needed to be gone by a certain time. James came over and explained that he needed to give our table to someone that had a reservation. When I asked him whether the reserved tables were allotted a certain amount of time to eat, he could not respond. He simply stated that WE NEEDED TO LEAVE. We asked the other tables whether they were told they had a time limit to eat, and they said \\"no.\\" So why were we being treated differently? \\n\\nI had been to this restaurant with reservations and as a walk-in, and was never told I only had 45 minutes to eat. In response, James said in a condescending manner, \\"I've been doing this for a lifetime...My policy makes me a good amount of money.\\" When we responded that customer satisfaction was just as important, he told us we needed to leave immediately and not to worry about the bill, just leave. Then, as I was putting on my coat to leave, he brought in security to escort us out. (Totally uncalled for.)\\n\\n Then, after stating he would comp the meal, he said, \\"So, you're not going to pay for your meal?!\\" We responded that we had money and gave him a credit card. Then, he pushed the card back to us and ordered us to leave with the security escort, and instructed us not to come back. (Notably, we were outside of the door before 9:30 p.m.) \\n\\nJames should not be an owner/manager. He was extremely unprofessional, flippant, and condescending. He could have said, \\"I am sorry we have to rush you\\" or \\"Could I wrap a dessert for you to-go?\\" But, he was dismissive toward us from start to finish. James lacks in customer service skills. I have never been thrown out of any restaurant or any place (for that matter), and treated with such disregard as a customer. This was truly one of my favorite restaurants, but I will never return.

We called to make a reservation early in the week and were told that they don't do, ( not take) reservations, but you can come in and put your name down earlier in the day. Ok, so a friend of mine was in the area, went to do what they told me on the phone and was scoffed at. They apparently don't \\"do\\" that either. When we got there, we were told it was an hour wait, not terrible, so we stood in the hot sun for an hour waiting for a table. The drinks weren't bad. The patio waitresses are snobby though, or at least ours was. Not sure why the inside bar was for diners only, which if I put a reservation in, I am a diner. While we were there there were a number of people who were NOT diners at the bar. So it seemed very pretentious to me. \\n\\nOn to the food, I can sum it up quite quickly, mediocre. The appetizers were ok, the meatball dish wasn't bad, a little salty. The Frites were good, and the mussels were also good. I got a burger, so I didn't expect much and again it wasn't bad, just not noteworthy. the rest of my table got the Octopus, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, all of it again was good. Nothing was great, or WOW this is so good I'll come back here again after spending $150 a couple. \\n\\nThe ice cream sandwich dessert was the best thing we had and that was a dessert. \\n\\nObviously, this place is a east side hipster haven and they can have it.

The soy sauce is a ginger soy sauce & I don't like ginger so that wasn't to my liking.  My Mango Jalape√±o cocktail was light & sweet but was a little too light on the alcohol.  There is a nice kick of heat to the drink so that is a plus.  I tried my friend's Fried Chicken & that too was just ok.

The menu apparently changes all the time so that in effect means there are always specials. We tried the tuna seaweed salad, which was very tasty as well as the spring salad, which came with a brilliant smoked Gouda dressing over tasty in-season strawberries and a variety of nice fresh veggies. The complementary warm bread fresh out of the oven with the balsamic infused olive oil was delicious. \\n\\nFinally, we shared two of the classic main dishes that our waitress Sidney told us are usually on the menu: the roasted chicken with mac & cheese and the slowly smoked beef brisket with corn and jalapeno side. We had a hard time deciding which one was better. They got the brisket just right with that perfect tender peel away meat that almost tastes like pork. The chicken had an amazing lemon and herb soaked crispy skin and was cooked to perfection.  The brisket maybe wins because the side is better - the baked cheese on top of the mac & cheese was good, but otherwise the noodles kind of lacked flavor.\\n\\nAs it was my birthday the meal included a free desert of my choosing. We chose a bread pudding pineapple creme fraiche thing that was also delicious.\\n\\nThis place is not cheap ($20+ entrees) but you have to pay for good food and in this respect, I think the prices are fair (especially given the location and atmosphere). A few other \\"did you know's?\\":\\n-This place has bocce ball courts outside that would be great for groups either waiting for the food or just enjoying some beers on a hot summer day\\n-You can bring one bottle of your own wine that they will uncork (only a few places in ATL do this), afterwards for additional bottles there is a fee but still this is cool\\n-They are serious about ID's as even though it was my birthday (29th and I pretty much look my age as well as had a picture of my passport on my phone), I forgot my ID at home and I was not allowed to actually drink the wine we bought. Sidney, our waitress, who provided excellent service, was sweet about it and felt bad, so no hard feelings there.\\n\\nOverall this is a great place to check out if you haven't been here before or want to try some of the other menu options as I am sure we will in the future.

First, the space is fantastic. Plenty of comfortable seating, both indoors and out and floor-to-ceiling windows make the inside feel like your outside as well. I adore the rustic-meets-sophisticated decor and the smoky wood-fire grill aroma that filled the air.   Service was top-notch.  Our server was excellent, very knowledgeable and attentive.   Perhaps because it was a Monday evening, we had no service issues.   We started with a few of their signature cocktails, I went for the delicious Mexico City Blues (was a cross between a margarita and a spritzer, a little grapefruity and not-to-sweet).    We shared the grilled artichokes and smokebox cornbread to start.  Artichokes were perfectly prepared and the cornbread was slightly charred, smoky and spicy (jalapenos).    My entree was the \\"boyscout style\\" trout - it is wrapped in extra crispy bacon and was probably the best preparation of trout I have ever had.  Others had the scallops and spring vegetables with gnocchi.   We shared a side of the dirty potato salad which was really like deep fried home fries, so yummy.   Everyone was pleased with their entrees.  Full but needing something a little sweet, we ordered one sticky toffee with 4 spoons to share.  It was heavenly. If I have the opportunity to come here again the next time I am in Buckhead, I may have just an app and dessert! Oh and cocktails of course.

You will need a heavy dose of sauce that accompanies the bun to stimulate your taste buds in any way.\\n\\nBeef Ho Fun is your standard fare Chinese food with a slight American tinge to it. Shanghai Pork and Shrimp Noodles was the one dish that was unique with a fusion-esque taste that was well-balanced and satisfying. However, the servings sizes are much smaller than your average Chinese restaurants. Try dumping your food (before you eat it) into the Chinese take out container they provide, and you'll see that it only fills the box halfway. I require two bowls of noodle intake before starting to feel topped off, and at $10 a bowl, this can get pretty expensive. Not good value.\\n\\nThe service is fast and the staff is friendly. The interior is an odd mix of modern and Asian gaudy with large gold colored animal silhouettes stenciled across the walls. When you walk in you're greeted with an imposing back-lit, wall-mounted menu complete with homemade photos and bad handwriting.

It looked like they were using quality ingredients, but the preparation fell short. \\n\\nFried rice was left unstirred on the griddle way too long until some of it was actually hard and chewy, and the shrimp was over cooked to the point of being rubbery. I didn't order salmon, but someone else at our table did and it looked over cooked to me. The chef never asked the salmon customer how they wanted it cooked, just the steak customers. If you are a salmon lover at all, you know that it is perfectly acceptable to specify a degree of doneness just like a steak. \\n\\nI don't go to a Japanese steak house for the show, but that wasn't so great either. Our chef tried twice and couldn't execute the basic maneuver of tossing an egg in the air and making it land on the edge of the spatula to break it. He also dropped his spatula a couple of times while simply twirling it. Personally I couldn't care less about the chef's showmanship, but I know for some people that is important."},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Four starts for the food. \\n\\nBut the website says that you can either park in a lot and get validated, or use their valet parking.

So we figure we'll just use the valet. We drive around twice, and there's no sign of a valet guy. We wait probably 15 minutes and finally find a guy, and it still takes another 10 minutes for him to finally take our car. Then, he gives my boyfriend his personal cell number and tells us to call him 15 minutes before we want our car. I've never heard of such a system. Bizarre.

We were greeted by two little boys in matching plaid playing putt putt on there front greens.  The outside courtyard is so intriguing that I almost wish we had to wait so we could have enjoyed it. You walk in at the oyster bar where punch is flowing, the fire is burning, and people are enjoying lots of small plates.  If you order a beer, you get an Optimist koozie! So wonderful. We were quickly seated though as we had called ahead to make a reservation. \\n\\nThe large dining room is exactly what I want out of restaurants.  It was large, crisply clean, cozy, comfortable, elegant, and slightly nautical.  On our table we found two black napkins and two white ones.  It turns out they give guests wearing black the black napkins so the white ones don't shed on their clothes- Such a simple and clever way to make guests happy. They also quickly brought us water, drinks, and manna from heaven.  Actually they were buttered rolls, but I'm fairly sure they were what manna from heaven would taste like. \\n\\nAfter being overwhelmed and wanting literally everything on the menu, I decided on a cup of she crab soup, oysters, and a side of beets. I'm pretty sure the frothy and rich she crab soup was made by the hands of Poseidon himself. It came with something called \\"shrimp toast\\". I really wanted like three shrimp toasts to dip in my soup.  It was scrumdiddlyumpscious. \\n\\nEntrees come a la carte and it is recommended that you order a side, appetizer, or oysters to go with them.  I prefer small plates because you get to try more different things.  I had a mix of sweet East coast and deep set, briny West coast oysters. They came over ice with herb mignonette, lemon, and fresh horseradish. Typically I prefer the salty more mineral oysters, but these sweet East coast oysters were amazing. I strongly recommend getting some oysters to share with your table. My beets were just the icing on my cake.  They came in a large portion with cheese, herbs, and peppers.  Their spiciness was a great compliment to my sweet and rich oysters and soup. \\n\\nThe service was spot on.  Our lovable waiter made sure we had everything we needed.  He kept our waters full, poured our wine, laughed with us, and didn't miss a beat. I can not wait to get back to The Optimist.

Furthermore, the \\"mixed vegetable\\" dish was about 12 pieces of gai lan (for $12!), the soup was really uninspired, and the tofu and eggplant dish, while tasty, could have used more variety. Not only that, but it took forever (over an hour!) to get all our dishes -- no apologies or anything for the wait time. If not to make things even more annoying, this place is CASH ONLY.

Instead, customers make their way toward the back counter, dodging other customers who already have their orders in.   Under this mish-mashed system, expect to get a coup of soup, on display at the first counter, in about 10 minutes.\\n\\nAs for the food, my chicken-pot-pie soup was fine.

My boyfriend picked me up from the airport and offered to take me out to eat. We were going to go somewhere nice, but I was just so tired that I wanted to go somewhere casual so I could slouch in a booth and not worry about the fact that I looked like I had just been traveling.\\n\\nWe decided on Old Bag of Nails in Grandview. And it was just what the doctor ordered. This location is located in this cute little strip mall looking place. We easily found a place to park. This was about 8 or so on a Wednesday night, so it wasn't very busy.\\n\\nRight when we walked in the door, a forceful blast of hot air hit us from the heater on the ceiling right inside the front door. I wanted to stand there forever. It was much colder in Ohio than D.C. and I wasn't used to it yet. My boyfriend stepped away because he thought it was too hot. \\n\\nThe inside looks like a quaint little British pub or something along those lines. It's a little dark, a little cozy. It was definitely the kind of place I wanted to be in at the time. A great place to relax and enjoy the food. There were a few TVs in here but it wasn't too loud.\\n\\nWe were greeted by the hostess right away and we requested that booth I was so longing for. She seated us and I got all comfortable. The hostess then returned to be our server. We got our drinks - my boyfriend had a Goose Island Honker's Ale - she did check his ID and then the beer was served in a bottle. I just wanted water and lots of it, and she offered to put lemon in it for me. When she brought our drinks, she had two extra beers in her hands and as she put them down we were confused. Then she said, \\"Oh! These are for another table! That's what happens when I take two orders at once!\\" It was funny, and certainly not a problem. She was really nice and attentive.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I decided on the mini pretzels for an appetizer. After we ordered those, I just couldn't decide what I wanted to order. I wasn't terribly hungry and I was so loopy from lack of sleep and full body exhaustion (if you went to inauguration, you know what I'm talking about - and we didn't have seats!). The waitress came back about three times to ask us what we wanted and I had to keep telling her I needed more time. It didn't help that I decided to tell my boyfriend all about my trip at that moment - I couldn't focus on food. Finally I got my act together and chose some mini burgers. Here, you have several different choices for the mini burgers: Cheeseburgers, hot burgers, pulled pork, etc. I went with the hot burgers. I felt bad for making our server come back so many times, but she was really nice about it.\\n\\nOur pretzels came out and they were piping hot and so delicious. They looked and tasted just like the mini pretzels at Mac's, if you've ever had those. They are just little soft pretzels, still in that pretzel shape you know and love. Sea salt is sprinkled on top (which I always pick off) and they come with this kind of spicy cheese sauce to dip them in. They are so good. I think you get about 10 of them.\\n\\nAfter a reasonable wait, our food came out. My boyfriend got the turkey reuben. It came with this big pile of fries. Right away I had to steal some of them. They looked and tasted so good. Perfect fries. His sandwich was pretty big - he was starving and it was just big enough that he couldn't quite finish it all.\\n\\nNow to my food. I had three mini burgers - the hot ones. All looked so delicious. They had melted pepper jack cheese all over them - very cheesy! With sauteed mushrooms all mixed in with the cheese. They were served with toothpicks stuck through them so they wouldn't slide around and a single jalapeno was placed on the top of each bun. I put the jalapenos on the burgers. There wasn't any sauce on them, but they didn't need any. The burgers were cooked just right and were so juicy. As I mentioned, they were very cheesy so I could taste it in every bite and sometimes had long strings of melty cheese when I took a bite. There were plenty of mushrooms and it was just so delicious. I also ordered onion rings instead of fries. I don't really understand why onion rings always cost a little extra. But they usually do. Here, I only got 4 onion rings with my burgers. They were big, but it seemed a little crazy to only get four of them, and you're paying extra for them. But, they were so good. The batter was crispy and crunchy and they were a bit greasy. When they were served I didn't see a sauce with them, so I asked if I could get some. The waitress brought me a cup of Chipotle Ranch Sauce. I don't like to dip onion rings in ketchup or anything like that. This sauce was a perfect compliment to the rings. I wasn't as worried about only getting 4 when I started eating them because they were pretty filling. I had to get a box for the rest of my food. The food here couldn't have tasted better. It really hit the spot and I will definitely come back."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"My boyfriend and I come here once a week at least.

Came for Sunday brunch and was overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of stale/mass produced food. Our server was nice, but most of the service relied on ancillary waiters to bring out the assembly line of brunch food, resulting in poorly timed courses, a looong wait for coffee (read: two courses into the meal), and occasional confusion. I cannot comment on dinner, but overall everything at brunch was much too heavily salted with too much butter and had clearly been sitting around on a warming plate/oven for a while before it was served. The complimentary pastries were abundant but at least a day or two old. The only dish that was worth eating was the shrimp and grits. I can only imagine that if they provided half the quantity of food in the prie fixe brunch and had 10% higher quality ingredients and made the dishes semi-to-order but kept the same price, this place would have much more satisfied customers!

Old bag was a staple in middle and high school (think late 90's early 00s), but with all the new, innovative places to eat in Columbus, this local chain falls very short.

Very generous in size (large salad portion and the amount of chicken they give you is very good) and my first time having hot bacon dressing. Very stick and really not my taste in dressing. Second time I got the buffalo chicken wrap, side salad and their soft pretzels. The soft pretzel dipping sauce is cheap liquid cheese. Then they give you slices of jalape√±os. ????  Huh? On the menu is was listed as a jalape√±o dipping sauce but reality was far what I had assumed. My side salad was made with iceberg lettuce. Who the hell makes salads with iceberg lettuce still? It's 2013. Get it together. Took a few bites and threw it out. My buffalo chicken wraps left a lot to be desired. Yeah it's pretty basic I itself but man out some updated twist on it. Cheddar cheese is really unnecessary when it's slathered in bleu cheese dressing. Oh and the 8 inch hair embedded in my wrap?! Yeah tasty.

We love the eccentric bedrooms -- classrooms cut in half, decorated with murals unusual furniture  -- and the even more eccentric, thickly decorated walls.  Turning a spooky old school into a lodging and conference center is inspired.  I've never taken advantage of the soaking pool but the tiny \\"Honors\\" and \\"Detention\\" bars and the movie theater are fun and comfortable.  (Also, in case you've read all the reviews -- you're not going to have to share a bedroom. All the guest rooms have their own.)\\n\\nReading other reviews, there seems to be a lot of complaint about the food at the Courtyard Cafe here.  Regulars who actually LIVE in Portland may know better, but when we've been - typically for breakfast - it's been competent.  There's better food out and about in Portland, but if you just want pancakes before setting out on a road trip, or a beer and a burger at the end of a long day, it should be alright.  \\n\\n(And by the way, they may not rank in Portland, Seattle or other larger towns in the Northwest, but if you're on a road trip in completely unfamiliar territory in Southern Washington?

The donuts are fine, average donuts that you'd fine in any bakery.   But combined with the long lines and massive hype, I was not expecting an average donut.   Apparently, a trip to Portland is not complete without a stop to this famed donut shop.   Being a tourist here myself, totally feel like I was conned into stopping by.   We sampled the bacon maple, chocolate glazed and plain donuts.   When trying a new junk food spot I always order and bite into the most basic item first, as this is usually a good test of the quality of the establishment.   The plain donut can be described as, ordinary.   After all, it's just a donut, nothing more, nothing less.   The famed bacon maple was pretty bad in my book.   Way too much maple.   I mean, the place does have variety going for it.  Literally, there must be like 30 different donuts to choose from.    But the real issue I had with the place was being such a famed tourist stop, Voodoo,  after 6pm becomes a mad house.   Line stretching down the block, homeless people loitering around and alot of drunk idiots waiting to gobble up some donuts.   If you do plan to stop by Voodoo, either go in the daytime when the lines are reasonable, or be prepared for the madness in the evenings.  My opinion, just go to Crispy Creme and save yourself the hassle."},{"name":"Tatsu Japanese Bistro","address":"1441 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I don't usually write reviews but because this place has quite mixed reviews, I thought I would put my 2 cents worth.

Recently dined and our meal was an all time low. The muscles (our go-to appetizer) was less than stellar. The muscles were gooey and the sauce had none of the garlic taste we've grown to love. We ate about 1/4 and then left it there for the waiter to take away. The cheese plate was anemic. The short rib dinner was flavorless and actually needed pepper and salt. The pine nuts distracted from the meal as well. The pork chop was over done even though a pink center was requested.

Both delicious and highly recommended.  The clam chowder was thick and creamy and had nice chunks of fresh and tender clams.  The sampler came on a bed of rice and had a combination of oysters rockfeller, grilled oysters with cheese, baked stuffed cherrystones, clams casino, and shrimp scampi.

Or just bad at consistency?\\n\\nWhere this cafe is located, I have suffered through some truly awful establishments.  Does anybody remember '200 Deli'?   Yeah, well, best not to.  Then this place came along with their odd moniker (it's not on the edge of the river by any stretch, so is it named after the disturbing 80's Keanu Reeves murder movie?) and slowly earned some grudging respect from me.\\n\\nI was going to write a four star review of Rivers Edge based solely on their stellar Cobb Salad, which I get about once a month for lunch.  But about one time in five they just drop the ball.  Okay, it's still an edible salad and at $6.25 it's even a pretty decent value given the options around the neighborhood.  But WTF, Rivers Edge?\\n\\nMost times there is a luscious and primly sliced half-avocado in this corner, facing against off a whole sliced hardboiled egg in that corner.  This time the avo is just a few ragged chunks and the egg has shrunk by half.  The lettuce looks like maybe it just overstayed its welcome in the kitchen by a half day.\\n\\nThe bleu cheese crumbles are still good and plentiful, as are the crispy bacons.  And this time the roast jerk chicken is thin-sliced, tender and tasty, as it usually is, but one time it was huge chewy chunks.  The garlic bleu cheese dressing, although it always has a strange light-brown hue to it, is house made and delicious.  At least that part they get right every time.\\n\\nMaybe it's like one of those messed up relationships you keep falling back into because it's convenient and the memory of the good times is just so compelling.  And then for awhile it's good and you think, hey this could work and then some shit like this happens and you say I'm so outta here.  \\n\\nI'm sure I'll be back in a few weeks.  I may switch it up and get the cheeseburger, which is also good.  And that will be enough to convince me that somehow this time things will be different.\\n\\nGod dammit, Rivers Edge.
