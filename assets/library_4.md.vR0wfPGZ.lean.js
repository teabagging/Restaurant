I mean if you compare living in Gwinnett County and dining out to Cobb County, you will know what I mean. Okay, okay, I'm talking about the Asian cuisines. I cannot just go to the International Market and grab a bubble tea or banh mi so that's why I complain and usually just eat plain old sandwiches at work. Thanks to Yelp, I can just search a cuisine or particular dish. So I did just that and found Lahore Grill.\\n\\nSince Lahore Grill was 3.7 miles from work according to Mapquest, I thought I'll give it a shot. I went to lunch solo and have some \\"me\\" time. The address has it on South Cobb Parkway but it's not directly on it, you have to turn into Terrell Mill then it will be located on your left hand side in a shopping strip. You cannot miss Lahore Grill, the restaurant is has mosque-like features if that makes any sense. There is also a Punjab store that has halal meats and groceries. \\n\\nAs I walk into Lahore Grill, I see a sign that has \\"You can seat yourself.\\" I decided to sit on the left hand side of the restaurant, which the restaurant was a lot bigger than I thought. You will see the buffet and there were a lot more items than I thought. Everything was labeled. I wanted to try the vegetable pakora but both times I got up, there was none. There was no tandoori chicken but there was chicken 65!! Yes!! I also got chicken makhani & many other dishes that I cannot remember the name. The makhani was yellow in color and more buttery than I've had and to my surprised it was all white meat. I'm used to eating it with dark meat and the sauce being more flavorful and orange looking. I also ordered the mango lassi, it was soooo good.\\n\\nI enjoyed listening to Bollywood music while eating. I turned back and saw B4U playing Son of Sardar, Yes Boss, & Jaan-E-Maan's music, lol. After stuffing myself, I finally got up to pay. I noticed another room that looked very loungey with colorful pillows. I'm assuming it's for hookahs and a fun evening night out.\\n\\nIf I'm craving Desi food, I don't mind going back to Lahore Grill. For only $7.99 for lunch buffet, there is enough variety to choose from. It's not my favorite but definitely worth it for the price and for the mango lassi."},{"name":"Beansprout","address":"270 Medford St","city":"Malden","stars":"3.5","text":"I have only ordered takeout from this place.

As I am DF/GF, I asked if they had gluten free bread (nope), or if I could substitute for something else for the toast.  \\"Hashbrowns,\\" I was told.  \\"Bacon,\\" I counter-offered, hopefully.  \\"For $5.25, because bacon costs more than toast,\\" I was told with great seriousness.  I agreed.\\n\\nNow, the food:  at first, I was mad.  The takeaway container I was given felt like it was empty - and when I opened it at the office, it nearly was.  The portions are SMALL - but I suppose I shouldn't have expected more for $5.25.  There were two microscopic eggs, approximately 10 hashbrowns (yep there were so few I could count them), and two thin strips of bacon.\\n\\nThe reasons I am not mad:  I got a freshly cooked, made-to-order breakfast for roughly the same price as a Tim Hortons sandwich or McMuffin, with (hopefullly) less salt and additives.

I'm generally a fan of this Atlanta-based fast-casual chain because the restaurants are quick, affordable, reliable, and healthy. This Fresh To Order has its own dine-in space, separate from CNN Center's open food court. It has booths and tables, a long, cushioned banquette, and TVs playing channels other than CNN such as ESPN. It's more cozy and quiet and I prefer it to CNN Center's often hectic and bustling food court \\"outside.\\"\\n\\nFresh To Order serves approximately a dozen different panini sandwiches, nearly 10 salads, about 20 assorted fresh and healthy entrees, a few burger alternatives (not made with beef), as well as soups and sides like grilled vegetables and wheat berry rice. Sandwiches, which come with potato chips or sliced apple, run about $9 each. Salads are about $8 each, small plates $5-8 each, and entrees $10-15 each. All dishes are made-to-order in the restaurant's open kitchen and are supposed to be delivered to your table in under 10 minutes (that was indeed the case for us).\\n\\nBeverage-wise, there's beer and wine, Coke products from a fountain machine, and a neat selection of housemade teas and lemonade.\\n\\nI've tried a few items here and have enjoyed them all. They are:\\n\\n* Coconut Curry Salmon - fresh coconut curry sauce, roasted corn nut relish, garlic mashed potatoes\\n* Ale Laced Chicken Tenders with BBQ sauce and honey mustard dressing plus garlic mashed potatoes\\n* Almond Crusted Seared Tuna - Asian slaw, dijon vinaigrette\\n* Market Salad with Fire Grilled Chicken - mixed baby greens, Mandarin oranges, candied walnuts, golden raisins, apples, toasted almonds, balsamic vinaigrette\\n\\nThe Coconut Curry Salmon is tasty. I like the creamy and flavorful light brown curry sauce. The salmon is fresh, not fishy, and nicely cooked with an appetizing consistency. The corn nut (almond) relish adds a nice crunchy texture. The salmon comes with a small mixed green salad with balsamic vinaigrette dressing and a side. I like the garlic mashed potatoes because they are simple and comforting.\\n\\nThe Ale Laced Chicken Tenders is another simple dish that is satisfying though I have been unable to taste any of the \\"ale lacing.\\" Fresh To Order's fried chicken tenders remind me of elongated Chick-fil-A Nuggets because they look and taste similar, right down to the lean meat and breading. I think they taste fine without sauce, but the accompanying honey mustard dressing isn't bad. You can also ask for BBQ sauce.\\n\\nAt $6, the Almond Crusted Tuna is a solid value. This small plate contains about a half-dozen slices of tuna that have been appropriately seared with succulent, soft, pink centers. The Asian slaw is made out of crisp and crunchy red cabbage and carrots. The dish is topped with chopped green onion and a savory dijon sauce. It makes for a decent app or snack.\\n\\nIf you like salads like me, then I suggest adding a \\"small\\" side salad to your order for two bucks. You can order a house, baby green, or Caesar salad. Balsamic vinaigrette is the default dressing. I put quotes around small because these salads are more of a medium-sized salad. The baby green salad comes with mixed baby greens, golden raisins, candied walnuts, and blue cheese crumbles. It's just like the restaurant's Blue Cheese Fig Salad, but without dried figs and golden peppadews. The salads also come with a yummy, soft, buttery half-croissant on the side.\\n\\nThe Market Salad is actually pretty filling. The Fire Grilled Chicken is not very tasty, but it's lean and healthy. The salad is satisfying as an entree.\\n\\nService is good.

There is a new kid in town and her name is Hanabi.  \\n\\nI was intrigued by the four and a half stars and Yelp. It was enough to compel me to drive out of my neighborhood and up to the Northcross Mall. Typically this is only done when I feel a drive to Guitar Center coming on. And that only happens when I have lost my way in life. But there was nothing gone astray tonight.\\n\\nWe started off with a cucumber sunomono. Outstanding fresh flavors. We followed it up with some grilled veggie dishes. And then came the sushi. My wife had a negihama roll. She commented that it was the best and freshest she had ever had. I got a $34 sushi combination (Matsu) which consisted of 12 nigiri pieces and 2 rolls. Amazing value there, and the fish was very good. The pieces were quite large too. I especially appreciated the escolar, with fried garlic chips and the yellowtail. But it all was outstanding and very sharable. In fact, the only way I could get through the Matsu was to start halving the rice about half way through.\\n\\nThe logo resembles anime as opposed to something more sophisticated. And the mall setting definitely does not lend itself to a hot date. We did not get into the drinks, so I can not comment on that. But I would not be going to a mall to drink anyway.

Overall, it is decent, but isn't fantastic.  Let's break it down:\\n\\nGrilled Cheese:  2 stars\\nPastrami w/ Emmental, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing:  4 stars\\nService:  3.5 stars\\nPrices:  2 stars for prepared food, 3 stars for to-go cheese, 2 stars for other grocery items\\nTo-Go Cheese Selection: 4 stars\\nAtmosphere: 4 stars\\n\\nFirst, the not so good.  We ordered a grilled cheese sandwich.  Keep in mind that this place is about cheese.  All about cheese.  It is the entire point of the place.  We figured the grilled cheese (which is the very first set of items on the menu) would be CC's signature sandwich.  A sandwich showcasing fantastic cheese.  A real showstopper.  What we received was anything but that.  We looked at the paltry little sandwich placed before us and were surprised.  Okay, we thought, it doesn't look like much, but it will taste good.  Not really.  Not bad certainly, but not particularly good either.  It contained asiago and fontina.  We love good cheese, from the subtlest to the stinkiest.  This cheese was nothing special.  And there was very little of it.  Melted, the cheese was less than 1/8\\" thick.  The sandwich came with potato chips.  For $5, it wasn't a good deal at all, either substance or price wise.  Wouldn't order it again.\\n\\nThe pastrami was good.  Would order it again.  The meat, cheese, sauerkraut, and dressing all blended together nicely.  And the bread (whole wheat baguette) had a very nice texture.  The price was rather high.  And for $10, CC could serve a few chips on the side.\\n\\nService was not consistent.  The older gentleman who appears to be responsible for portioning the cheese that is offered for sale is very knowledgeable, courteous, and helpful.  Excellent employee.  The person who I believe to be the manager is courteous and helpful.  (But I feel bad for him because he appears to be very stressed out.)  The rest of the staff could use some training.  (This will probably come with a little more time, since the place is newly opened.)  For instance, the grilled cheese sandwiches come with lettuce and tomato as free options (which is very nice).  However, that option is listed underneath the last of the grilled cheese choices on the wall menu, so we didn't see it because we selected a choice higher up on the list.  When we ordered, the young woman at the register never said, would you like tomato and lettuce with that?  This may be a small thing, but it would have been nice if she'd asked.  But I will say that she seemed pleasant enough.\\n\\nCC offers a nice selection of cheeses for sale.  Not huge, but well-selected, which is good.  (I don't need all cheeses, just the tasty ones.)  The prices are comparable to, or a little less, than those at, say, Whole Foods, but noticeably higher than the prices at Trader Joe's (though the selection is considerably better than that at TJ's).  If I need a particular cheese in the future, I might visit CC to purchase it.\\n\\nI understand the reasoning behind CC.  Buy cheese, eat prepared items made with cheese, etc.  A little cheese world.  (Mmmm, that sounds tasty.)  But cheese is a very perishable and expensive substance.  I wonder if the rather high prices for smallish quantities of prepared items are heavily subsidizing the to-go cheese side of the business.  Don't know if that's true, but if so, that's somewhat too bad.  Bringing down the prices on the prepared food, or enlarging portions a bit, would be helpful to the consumer.\\n\\nDon't know if we'll go back for a meal.  What we'll probably do is wait a few months, let the place settle in a bit, and then give it one more try.  I do wish CC the very best.  Despite some flaws, the place is clearly trying to do a good job."},{"name":"J Buffalo Wings and Bar","address":"2580 Windy Hill Rd SE, Ste 400","city":"Marietta","stars":"3.5","text":"My boyfriend and I use to come here all the time.

SO glad I found this place!"},{"name":"Petunia's Pies & Pastries","address":"610 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I'm only giving a mediocre review for Petunia's Pies and Pastries based on two things: quality and service.\\n\\nQuality: I have celiac disease and have been eating gluten-free since 1994. Believe me, I know how difficult it is to make great gluten-free baked goods. Rice will absorb as much water as you can throw at it, and things made with rice-flour-rich gluten-free flour mixtures will pull water right out of the air.\\n\\nLong story short, I ended up ordering baked goods with fruit for both eating there and to go. (Fruit is very wet, so my choices were part of the problem here.) The pear/apple cobbler-top pie I had in the store was good but nothing special, and the crust had taken on a too-moist, cakey texture. Later that evening, the \\"cake\\" in the apple coffee cake was so wet it was like I'd set it in a bowl of water. The Whoa-Reo cookie had absorbed all but a thin layer of the previously thick buttercream filling. All in all, this was not an experience I would willing pay $14 for in the future.\\n\\nI should note that I've had versions of all three pastries many times in the past. I've never encountered quite the problem with moisture that I found there. I see it as a rookie mistake, really. There are gluten-free flour mixes that are not so rice-flour heavy, and that stand up to time and moisture better. I'd expect a baker to have nailed this down before they ever opened a storefront.\\n\\nService: The young woman who waited on me was visibly not \\"into\\" my friendly chitchat (so I shut up, oooops), and (at 12:30 pm) she just didn't seem to be very awake. The clientele already in the bakery were young hipsters; perhaps she did not know what to make of this 54-year-old lady and her friend.\\n\\nI had gone online to see their menu, and had my heart set on the Bumble Berry Peach Pie. When I got there, there was none, so I chose the pear/apple cobblertop, instead. It was disappointing. I thought the menu online reflected what was available in the store -- if it says differently somewhere on the site, I didn't see it.\\n\\nIn any case, according to my sales slip (Trans. #41140, dated 2/21/14), I was charged for a slice of Bumble Berry Peach Pie instead of what I actually got; same with the Whoa-Reo, I was charged instead for a Thin Mint Brownie. The difference with the cookie resulted in a $1.25 overcharge.\\n\\nIt's far enough out of my way that I haven't bothered to get back there to let them correct the overage. I have no doubt they would do so, and be appropriately apologetic about it. I just won't be going back.\\n\\nI know Petunia's is getting rave reviews and I'm all for it! The more access to gluten-free foods, the better. I don't think I'm holding them to a too-high standard, though, especially in the service dept. If they work at it, they can overcome that moisture problem, too.\\n\\nGood luck, Petunia's."},{"name":"Gladys Knight's Signature Chicken & Waffles","address":"529 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"We stumbled upon this place after being at the worst club in the entire city of Atlanta-The Verve!

Yummy!  There isn't a lot to the interior as far as design but I don't require that in order to eat lunch at a BBQ place.  I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich, green beans, and baked beans.  When the sandwich was served it smelled really good.  I have to say that I wasn't prepared for the mustard based sauce but it wasn't bad.  The green beans threw me off because they were (what looked to me) to be sauteed like what you get from a Chinese restaurant.  I've heard some folks say they like them but they didn't work for me.  It was too conflicting for my taste buds.  I was expecting more of the 'green beans with bacon fat' taste.  The baked beans were ok but nothing like, \\"OMFG!  You have GOT to try their baked beans!\\"  For those who are price conscious, the total was $8.63 without a drink because I usually just get water.  Will I go back?  Maybe, because my hubby will want to try it.  But I will know not to order the green beans next time.

I wouldn't rank it with Uchi and Barley Swine but I would place it in the camp right behind them.\\n\\nThe location used to be a pizza joint, an effect you can still somewhat feel and the reason why I knocked a star off.  The reason being is that there really aren't a ton of seating options available in the true indoors.  This means that a lot of their seating is located in the back area of the restaurant which is all enclosed patio spaces.  Since we are currently in the winter time they have plastic covering the opening all around the wooden ledges and heat lamps distributed everywhere.  Still, this makes Salty Sow feel less like a fine dining place and more like the casual pizza parlor it once was.  Being winter it felt very drafty even with the heat lamps.  If weather is too hot or too cold you may want to sit inside.  Just be aware that inside seating is reservation only and harder to come by.  This will probably end up being a frustration for those looking for something a little nicer in environment.  \\n\\nThe food is really awesome.  The famous brussel sprouts are most likely cooked in bacon fat and are very nice.  The pork is outstanding.  I ordered an item off the special menu that was Ahi tuna.

I went for the smoked salmon salad with feta. Though the salad didn't look tough enough to take me on, it was deceiving.

Very attentive and very professional. \\n\\nThere was SO MUCH on the menu that we wanted to sample, but we settled on trying a salmon croquette - just one (they have meal orders and then they have orders where you can just order a small portion). It was bland and fell drastically short of expectations, and was kind of okay... well, not really, but it wasn't our meal anyway. \\n\\nHubby ordered the fish and grits. The grits were perfect southern grits. The fish was lightly seasoned to the point where you know the seasoning is there, but you wish there was more of it. Doubling whatever seasoning they put on it would have made it perfect. I ordered the Midnight Train, which was wings and a waffle. It was good, but the chicken was like the fish: you could taste the seasoning, but it was very skimpy, almost bland. Doubling the seasoning would have made it perfect for me. \\n\\nAll in all, we would love to go back! There are a lot of things on the menu that look delicious and that we look forward to trying. I also look forward to bringing my out-of-town guests here, because I think they'll like it, too! \\n\\nNote: Beware the parking \\"situation\\".

I do have a few issues with cranking out a normally tender, delicious seafood item that is now battered and smothered in fluffy, pancake-like blanket.

This tiny crustacean was surrounded by a nice crisp and light batter, but I mean... you are paying $10 for 5 tiny shrimp and lots of egg/flour. Unfortunate... but it is certainly unique.\\n\\nNow, I can definitely say that the names of the items are way more appealing than they the grub actually is. For example: the mac and cheese boasts three cheese sauce tossed with crumbled oak-smoked bacon and lone star farms goat cheese. This mac was very saucy, but not creamy or thick enough, having a little too much runny characteristic. Also, the flavor was a tad too light. The noodles had a great shape, but just a little too much softness. I did like the goat cheese and the tanginess it provided. Unfortunately, I only had 2 bits of oak-smoked bacon in my entire dish.\\n\\nTo underline the point: the fries advertised golden fingerling potatoes, truffle oil, served with aioli dipping sauce.

They've got some strange eccentricities, which I will cover, but overall this place makes me feel like I'm eating at my Italian in-laws place.\\n\\nLet's tackle this \\"minimum order\\" thing. Here's how it works:\\n\\nThey impose a \\"one dish/person\\" minimum. That dish can be an app or main. These dishes are meant to be shared. Two people get one app and one main, that's pretty standard. If you just get one dish, they charge a $7.50 sharing fee (basically making up for the lost profit/large portion ratio).\\n\\nSecond, they have an upcharge for \\"homemade\\" pasta. I'm not happy about this. A good Italian place should make their pasta to begin with. I'm glad they have the option, but, especially with the already decently high prices, homemade pasta should be a given.\\n\\nAlright, I got those out of the way.\\n\\nThe food at Giorgio's is really good. Service is good, sauce is just right, and the environment is great for groups, family gatherings, dates, etc. You will walk out pleased.\\n\\nI had their eggplant parmesan and lasagna. Awesome! Really delicious and filling. Their olive oil was good and the wine was a perfect compliment.\\n\\nUltimately, I'm still looking in North End for the true gem of Italian fare. Is Giorgio's perfect, hell no, but it's the best I've had while visiting.\\n\\nTIP: Make a reservation ahead of time. They fill up quick and it's not that big of a place."},{"name":"Is'Original","address":"1671 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Food was great, Staff was awesome.

There were tons of tiny bones and we asked the waiter and he said, yea there could be bones. Well, I think something needs to be printed on the menu about it or they need to debone the meat before it's put into a stew like dish-- that was $18, not cheap.

This bakery specializes in typical French and American pastries and cakes. Prices are more than reasonable. They are large enough to share or you can pig out by yourself. \\n\\nThe corner store is essentially two rooms. The first is where you order. It is a bit poorly set up.

The pastries that you'll want to try are in a case to the back right. If you order to go, they have nice boxes to place them in if they are gifts (to others... or yourself!). The second room is the bar and seating. Plain decor. Nothing special with drinks, but they do have Greek coffee. There isn't any table service. You pick up and bus yourself.

I referred friends and co-workers too as choices for pastry shops in Boston are limited.  However, after each order I promised myself  Not to go back.  All their cakes( Mango, Jamaican, hazelnut)  are way too sweet and have  the same flavors -like they use the same syrup for the composition. Only the texture differs depending on the presence of more or less mousse. The baklava is too sweet and again flavors are uniform regardless what type you order- the Serven shop in Watertown has the best quality.  The Italian cookies are dry and have same texture.  Overall the quality of cakes is far behind the Konditor Meister in Braintree- which is probably the best place in Boston area to have exquisite treats offering unmatched quality and price.  Athans is overpriced, likely the lack of choices- only Cafe Japonaise is near by- allows them to overcharge their clients.   Most of the servers at Athans  are students- plain happy to have any job which does not involve McDonalds- however this implies they lack  proper training and the courtesy needed in this field.   Since Athans opened the cafe next door the place is crammed with students looking for a place to unwind and meet- laptops are everywhere.  Ordering a cup of tea is a big to do. They will offer only one cup - if you ask for two the girl will look at you with terror in her eyes as \\" I will get fired\\" . She will call the owner on the phone to ask if she can give you a paper cup to take the left over tea ( I believe it makes sense in a winter evening if you did not finish it and you paid for it ) The owner will tell you over the phone  you are cheap- even his Greek accent does not compensate for the lack of gallantry !

Last week I decided it was time to try it out...after all, the menu did look fantastic. There was no wait on a Sunday night the weekend of the 4th, not too bad. The restaurant is small, but so are many others in the North End, didn't bother me. The \\"Piattini\\" idea is great, and it was fun to share small plates with the 3 others I was dining with. I highly recommend the Wild Mushroom Risotto and the Japanese Eggplant. The wine was also great...some bottles were $25, a steal for the North End. \\nOverall the food was great and I was very satisfied, as were the people in my party....I cannot give the restaurant above 2 stars (though food-wise it deserves 4) because of a TERRIBLE experience with the service... My party was just finishing up, our bill had been paid, and as we were taking our last sips of our wine before getting up our table was approached by one of the male servers (he may have been a bus boy) who asked us VERY rudely if we \\"minded leaving\\" because \\"there were people outside who had been waiting an hour\\". Mind you, there were no people waiting that I saw, and we had only been sitting/eating at our table for an hour...we weren't overstaying our stay at this restaurant. We were also very good patrons, so we were shocked at his request, his tone, and the fact that he would say that to paying customers. My family has worked in the restaurant business for years, and a server should NEVER approach a table and tell guests to leave, even if they are finished. Because you know what? We paid to eat there just like anyone else would, and we were so disappointed in this ending to our meal that unfortunately we do not want to eat here again...a shame since the food is really good. I made a comment to the manager on the way out so hopefully he dealt with the rude server, but who knows. \\nAll I have to say is great food....but I would like my $140 back because I was incredibly offended by the service.

It was just SO BLAND. Maybe I got a bad batch because literally everything else I have had here have been SUPER flavorful, to the point of almost too flavorful. The Pad Thai was just tasted ricey.

The shrimp was still partially in it's (crispy) shell, but butterflied, so easy to peel off and had really good flavor.

They also have salads, which I'm looking forward to trying.    \\nThe service was fantastic, they had plenty of staff and were constantly checking on us and coming by to take away our trash for us.  \\nThe only reason for the 4 stars is I felt they went pretty light on the toppings; next time I'd like to see the toppings more equally distributed throughout my pizza.  \\nTheir house lemonades and iced teas are a nice touch.

The experience was not great.  First we went to the bar to wait for the rest of our party to show up.  Before I was greeted by the bartender, I was greeted by a swarm of fruit flies.  After fanning away a few of the attackers, I ordered a bottle of wine.  The wine list is very small but well thought out.  I then pointed out to my wife the 50+ fruit flies which had congregated upon the illuminated back bar wall.  How the staff was oblivious to the infestation was mind boggling.  We sat by the street window.  The decor is nice and trendy but nothing that was not done 5 yrs ago.  We started with a chip and dip.  The ranch style dip was good but the chips were all stuck together which happens when potatoes are not prepared properly.  Next was the Fried Buffalo Oysters.  The oysters themselves were fine, it's a fried oyster after all, but the accoutrements were horrible.  The celery root was bland paste and the dipping sauce was a very thick mayo garlic that tasted and looked old.  I liked the spin on buffalo wings but the execution was poor.  Next was a lamb dish.  I just tasted the lamb.  It seemed as though it had been sliced thin and sitting in a warming pan in some broth.  It was tough and flavorless.  The last item was the ribs.  At this point, I was drinking a lot of wine since the wine was the best part of the meal so the all I recall was the ribs themselves and not what came with the ribs.  The ribs were that gooey sauced asian style of rib.  They were tender and tasted fine but nothing special.  The service was fast, attractive and attentive, the only highlight of Abby Lane.

Then he gave us the menu told us 'I would like to tell you our most popular dishes try not to interrupt I want to get through this quickly.' No Joke. He did tell us he was new there and still learning but the service we got was very poor. It took another 20 minutes for us all to receive our drinks. The worst was when dinner came. After putting the parmesan on each of our plates a small amount was left. The server stated 'oh she likes parmesan cheese' to my girlfriend and the runner then dumped the reamining on her plate causing the bowl to fall out and drop into her food. He then proceeded to pick it up with his hand say 'oh good theres no glass in it and start to walk away' Luckily the manager was close by he went about replacing it said he would take care of it and offered us free dessert. That is when things got worse. After we ordered dessert (which we weren't planning on until it was offered as recovery) there was strawberry on my friends plate to which she has an allergy. We politely asked for a new one minus the strawberry garnish. The runner stated 'you went your whole meal without mentioning the allergy that's your problem'. He then proceeded to argue with us when we apologized said the menu didn't mention it and we didn't plan on dessert. He got in our face and we had to tell him multiple times to leave it was very embarassing and unprofessional. The manager came back over and proceeded to tell us 'sorry about your problems everyone else seems to be having a great time.' They did end up comping our meal but it was still such poor service the food couldn't save it. Once again though everything we ordered was great we got the giant meatball, chicken parmesan, and campanelle. I myself got the soup of the day which was great.

Pressed is a very small cafe, with only a limited bar area for seating. There's usually a space to sit; but, if you come during peak hours on the weekends, you may have to order to go.\\nOf all the avocado toast in Boston, Pressed is probably my favourite. 7-grain Iggy's bread is toasted until lightly crunchy, then smeared with their proprietary avocado smash, sprinkled with pumpkin seeds, and drizzled with pumpkinseed oil - which is what takes their avocado toast to the next level. The sprinkle of paprika is the cherry on top of an excellent avo toast.\\nPressed also recently introduced the curry chickpea toast, which is delicious but not as addictive as the avo. The greatest difficulty here is choosing between the yummy, dessert-like AB&J Tartine (almond butter, chocolate hazelnut spread, strawberry jam, topped with sliced fruits) and the Avocado Smash Toast.\\nI also love their superfood shakes. My favourites in order: Charge, Purify, Defend. If you ever need coffee with some nutritional boost, order the Charge - it's SO GOOD. The Purify is great for whenever you've had a day/night of overindulgence and need something to cleanse your system.\\nAs for the non-made-to-order foods, I wasn't impressed with portobello, cashew ricotta, apple-onion jam on baguette. The filling was fine, but the onion baguette was soft and slightly mushy from sitting too long in the refrigerated section. I recommend you stick to their made-to-order foods.

We came here on a Friday night dinner, called ahead and told them we have a party of 6 coming. Once we called, we waited for a couple of minutes before we sat down. They have a really big menu, but we were mainly there for the lobster dinner combo, so we ordered the 2 lobster combo that came with 3 side dishes, and we ordered a fried rice on the side. They started off with the soup, which did not have much in it, mostly just water, and the side dishes came out. We ordered string beans, chicken, tofu pork belly dish as our side dishes. Tofu pork belly, they used the roast pork as their pork belly, was pretty disappointed, as I was looking for pork belly. Chicken was really tender, and the string beans were good. Now to the LOBSTER. Lobster was a big disappointment. There was a fair amount of meat, but the flavor was absent. No taste, bland, and was surprising. There were tons of garlic in the lobster, but man, was it missing the taste. We paid about $20/person, but would not come back for the lobster.

When we were finally seated at the bar we were literally on top of the person next to us. All the discomfort would have been worth it if Carmelina's lived up to it's reputation food wise .  I started with a beet salad that was very bland while my husband had seafood in red sauce which was average at best.  I had been craving carbonara but we couldn't make it to  one of our favorite restaurants in Portsmouth NH (see my review of Massimo's).  So I researched what restaurants in Boston had great carbonara which brought us to Carmelina's.  What a disappointment!  It was a bowl of overdone greasy pasta with tiny little pieces of cooked egg in it.  There was no pancetta (or flavor) in it at all.  I literally had 2 bites & pushed it away.  My husband had a traditional chicken parmagiana which was fine.  But you can pretty much get good chicken parmagiana anywhere.  Service was fine also.

I really want to like you, but you are making that very hard. Why?\\n\\n1. The drink situation. There is an insane policy that if you order more than one drink from the bar, you must be able to point out the recipient of the second drink to the bartender. Why is this? What if my boyfriend goes to the bathroom and asks me to get him a drink while he's gone? Or, more likely, what if you leave a table to get drinks for your friends? Sorry, you cannot do any of those things. Also, the reason you would even have to leave your table to get a drink is stupid--there is no drink service to the tables. Remind me why a casino would not want to make sure its clientele had easy access to drinks again, please.\\n\\n2. The table minimums. I am not the gambler here; my boyfriend is. I enjoy standing around the craps table drinking, learning, and watching him play, though. I cannot, however, do that at this casino. I can't stand around with him drinking because I am always forced to walk all the way back to the bar and wait in line for another drink just for myself, as I covered in #1. I can't stand around learning and watching him play either because all the tables are $15 minimum at night. One night, he lost $100 in 15 minutes. Of course, he was prepared to lose the money he came with--that is not the issue. It's the 15 minutes that is the problem. He's from St. Louis, where there are about six casinos. One of them has $3 craps during Happy Hour! The others have $5 minimum tables at night. For the past year, we have been driving to St. Louis to gamble there instead of at the casino 10 minutes away. Despite the long drive, we have a much better time, and we get our money's worth. It doesn't hurt that it's a nice little weekend trip, either.\\n\\n3. The bar/stage area. What in the world is going on here? Why is the giant screen, which is great for watching games, directly above the stage, where they book bands to play during a game? We were there last night watching the Final Four games, and when we got there at 6:15 PM, there was a baseball game on the giant screen, and weird other stuff on the eight other screens surrounding it. The Final Four game was playing on a screen by the tables, and it took them 10 minutes to change the giant screen. We had to ask the manager twice to turn on the second biggest college basketball games of the year. Then, a band came on around 7:00! At one point, the band was playing, the game was one, and there was loud music coming from either the OH restaurant and/or the bar. It was obviously impossible to hear what was going on in the games, but it was also weird to want to listen to the CCR cover band while trying to pay attention to a basketball game. Both ideas, a giant screen for sporting events and a live band, are good ideas, but the execution for both is poorly thought out.\\n\\n3.5 The restaurant. I had a really great experience at the OH restaurant the first time I went about a year ago. I got a burger and my boyfriend got the carbonara. We went back again on a double date with friends, and three of us got burgers and my boyfriend got the carbonara again. The food was really good, but the three of us who had burgers got sick. One of us got so sick immediately that the evening was called off early. It really pains me to include this because I did think the food was good, and I'm hoping maybe there was some other reason the three of us who ordered the same thing got sick. Hence, 3.5. \\n\\nIn conclusion, I do think it is possible to have a good time at the casino. We had a good time last night. Unfortunately, it is very easy to NOT have a good time, especially if part of your night includes gambling. We've never had good luck gambling here, but maybe that's just us. It seems a little like the casino thinks they can do whatever they want, and they can. They are the only game in town. The good thing is, there are other games in other towns, and it's a good excuse to get out of Ohio."},{"name":"Yard House","address":"888 SW 5th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Great beer selection with over 100 open taps.

My review of Two Chefs and a Table (TCT) was one of my first on yelp and I now regret my failure to first email the restaurant with my concerns prior to posting negative comments. It is very true that mistakes do happen (to err is human) and I did have a number of very positive experiences at TCT before that which I detailed below.  On balance it was rash of me to dismiss the restaurant due to a solitary negative experience.  If I do take the restaurant up on their offer to have me visit again, I will write a follow up review.  In the meantime I am reflecting on the disproportionate impact that negative reviews by anonymous reviewers like myself can have on well-intentioned (and this case highly innovative) proprietors.  I really do appreciate the owner taking the time to write to me, an indication that he or she both cares about their business and listens to their customers.   I have bumped my review to three stars from two, an assessment that is more reflective of my overall dining experience at TCT over several visits not only of my one unfortunate morning meeting with a piece of chicken that was prematurely out of the oven and onto my plate.  \\n\\nOriginal Review 7/2/11\\n\\n\\"I discovered this little gem of a restaurant two or three years ago and it quickly became a favourite.  With only seven or eight tables, it has an intimate ambience that's about a million miles away from factory restaurants like milestones or the like.  Every breakfast I had there until my last was above average, usually boasting creatively cooked local ingredients.  \\n\\nUnfortunately it was that last terrible experience that has led me to knock my rating down from what would have been five stars to a stingy two.  I ordered fried chicken and waffles, which I've discovered are an unlikely but heavenly combination.  The first few bites were close you're eyes, take a moment to savour, delicious.  Quite simply, a wonderful start.  Then I noticed .... the chicken was quite raw in the middle.   Damn.  \\n\\nOnce I got the attention of our server the meal was taken away and they comped it.  Really that was the least they could have done.  I don't know about you, but for me raw chicken is about as gross as it gets and I really felt they could have made more of an effort to make amends.  \\n\\nOn weekends like this I feel a little sad that I won't return, as I'd grown quite fond two chefs and a table.   Perhaps this was a one off but even so just once biting into a raw piece of chicken is one to many times for me.\\""},{"name":"Mi Tradicion","address":"111 N Stygler Rd","city":"Gahanna","stars":"4","text":"If you're going to do this restaurant, I wouldn't hit it on a Friday night.

Down below they had a live singer who was providing some comforting and relaxing tunes for us to all enjoy. After quickly browsing their happy hour menu ( great craft beer prices btw) we decided we would get some sushi along with our ramen.

If one is looking for a decadent, sumptuous, ridiculously expensive and delightfully nostalgic meal in what could be a restaurant scene shot on the set of Madmen season 1, one need look no further than Hy's Encore!\\nIt has been renamed since they shut down in order to renovate. Having eaten here several years back, I'm glad to note that they merely stripped off the old and replaced it with exactly the same thing, only new! It is still just as cozy and old school: all wrapped in leather and dark carpeting. Imagine a windowless subterranean den in some mansion in New England! One can almost smell the cigar smoke of days of olde!\\nWe were there as guests of one of my wife's colleagues. He is a true Bon vivant of South African decent, and had been wanting to take us to dinner as a gift to commemorate our nuptials last spring. This was the first time we had been back to Vancouver together since the wedding and he felt Hy's a perfect venue to celebrate; and celebrate we did!\\nThe evening began with the 3 of us being seated at the back tucked away in a corner. This was a great location for conversation, as the place gets a little loud with the inevitable cacophony that accompanies a busy restaurant filled with people making merry.\\n  No classic steakhouse meal at Hy's is complete without an amuse bouche of cocktails and cheese bread. My lovely wife chose a Kir Royale, while our host and I chose dirty gin Martinis straight up. The cheese bread at Hy's is everything one might hope for in a pre-dinner snack: hot, gooey, salty and delicious! I'm sure my arteries are as we speak drafting me a nasty email!\\nTo start, my wife selected the Caesar salad made table-side of course, while Host chose the butternut squash soup. I had muscles in a white wine bacon cream sauce. All were pleased with these selections and we paired with the locally vinted Blue Mountain Pinot Blanc. We also had a bottle of BC's Blasted Church Cab Sauvignon opened and breathing for when the grilled beast arrived!\\nThe Meat. That's really why we are there; for the fire grilled steaks, and Hy's brings it!\\nBoth my wife and our Host chose the 8oz fillet mignon while I opted for a 12oz New York strip grilled RARE!  At a place with a reputation for fine cuts of beef the likes of Hy's, I like my meat cooked so rare that if a decent Vet was at hand it might have a chance! Now I don't actually want it bleeding onto the plate, but as long as it is warm inside I like it purple! This steak was so tender it melted in the mouth. It was lightly seasoned, and the natural flavor was beautifully enhanced by the fire grilling it had lightly undergone. Host had a mashed baked potato and veggies, my wife had veggies as did I. The veggies were a colorful mixture of seasonals, lightly  saut√©d to retain some crunch. We shared some saut√©d spinach as well. Needless to say the food was perfect and along with the wine we ate like well-healed gentry!\\nNo room for desserts we opted instead for apr√®s dinner drinks: Host had brandy, my wife had port and I chose a moderately priced single-malt scotch. Of course Hy's has huge selection of tasty boozes so don't be shy- no one judges at a fine steakhouse!\\nBe assured we left more than satisfied and quite pleased to have had the good fortune and pleasure to have been treated by our Host to such a sumptuous feast! A joy to have dined with a man who loves to dine out!\\nIf you are inclined to splash out a bit on an old-school decadent steakhouse soir√©e, treat yourself to a meal at Hy's, your belly will thank you, your arteries will give you the silent treatment for weeks!

It's peaceful, clean, open and easy to find a place to sit and enjoy tea alone or with friends. The tea is pretty good, never bitter, and the matcha is pretty good in the lattes, and especially their matcha pastries. I've had a couple of their pastries  each time I've been here, and the matcha cake roll is my favorite as it's sweet, light and not dry! My favorite drink here so far is their iced matcha latte. However, my least favorite drink was their nitro iced green tea. It may have been my high expectations thinking that it would be frothy and creamy like ice nitro coffee, but it was not. The nitro fell a little short of my expectations of it being more like a simple ice green tea and nothing nitro like. Overall, I love the inside, and it makes a GREAT place to do work on my computer with free WiFi, and makes a chill environment to focus on my own. The pastries are great and delicious, while the drinks are a hit or miss depending on what you choose to order.

Everyone was very attentive and made us feel anxious to return!\\n\\nNow for food...!!! We ordered the Spicy Shrimp appetizer (big portion for an appetizer as it came with angel hair pasta) and it was goooooooooooood! Just the right amount of spicy kick! Then for dinner we had the Muscles and Calamari, and Crazy Alfredo... Flavor for daaaaaaaaaays!!! Muscles were fresh and flavorful! The pasta was cooked to perfection and the meat was tender and packed with spices. \\n\\nP.S.

Caso Fundido was tasty as were the blue corn tortillas. Ceviche Especial was also quite good and savory. Unfortunately it seemed as if the rest of the meal was phoned in. I had Mole Amarillo with Duck. It was served cold and I had to send it back. My daughter in from San Diego had camarones which were fine but the tamale served with them was cold. She did not want to send that back since the shrimp would not be any better than when served. My wife's Chili Pasilla looked like a deflated football bladder on the plate with barely a third of a cup of meat inside. Not too impressive or particularly flavorful. My son's Tinga Poblano was fine but no better than Curra's at half the price. When my mole returned it was only maybe 5 degrees warmer. The duck was nicely cooked but not integrated with the mole it was floating in. The chayote was undercooked and raw in the center. I can't describe how disappointed I was in this meal. It seemed as is the Exec Chef had put together some nice recipes and turned it over to someone with inadequate training and little pride in their work.

They said 45 minutes, I waited about and hour and it took maybe another 10 minutes or so.  A suggestion I would have for people getting one of these pies is to call in ahead of time and be patient because these are not traditional pizzas that take a couple minutes.  They do take a while.  Had the $20 appetizer platter and I liked it.  Also got the meatball sub, which was excellent.  We had leftovers in the fridge for days.  The guy at the counter was from my area (Allentown, PA) and was a really nice guy.  I think people need to be more patient and if you are in a hurry make sure you call prior so you don't get pissed.  No reason to bury this place over something like that.  Too often people so easily bury a business without thinking that this business greatly, along with all of the people who work there.  If a place deserves it, by all means.  If you do it because you think you are going to get a deep dish pie in 15 minutes, you are an idiot.  The food is good here and they were friendly to me.

Normally I'd find that intrusive and annoying, which I kind of still did, but I dislike uptight dining experiences more.

It tasted OK, average crust, but both were significantly over-cheesed, the mozzarella melted together like a continuous dairy spackling.  The crust was flat in flavor, and under-proofed, leaving few air bubbles that make crust flakier and lighter.  Instead it was kind of chewy and dense.  If the basil on the margherita was fresh, it was lost by being baked into the pie and reduced to mushy flavorlessness.  I detected nothing sun-dried about the tomatoes, though the entire pie still tasted OK, as a standard sliced tomato, cheese, mushroom pie.  They were both just that: OK.  Better than chain pizza, better than frozen, but nothing special, nor anything to rave about.\\n\\nWe were hungry, and we ate quite a bit of the pizza, but all three diners pronounced the experience supremely average.

What kind of restaurant complains to your face about the amount of tip you leave when they had poor service and asks for more money?\\n\\nThe answer?

This little trailer on Rainey Street about a block south of the Lustre Pearl is serving up some of the best  Mexican food in Austin.  \\n\\nI went here with some friends for the first time last week.  We started with molotes and empanadas.  They were good, but both on the small side.  I preferred the molotes with the pork in them, but that's just me.   We also tried some of their tostadas, and those are just to die for.  We ordered a bunch of different ones, and each was delicious in their own way.  We liked them so much that we wound up ordering all the tostadas on the menu.  Our favorites were the vegetables in red sauce (chileajo?) and the chicken in green chile sauce (tinga verde?). \\n\\nIt's a little pricey for food from a trailer, but far from unreasonable.  4.50 for two tacos or tostadas and about the same for their appetizers.  Considering how good the food is, this is a fantastic deal.  You're getting an amazingly good taco or tostada for about 2 dollars.  Nowhere else in the city is offering something so delicious at this price point.\\n\\nSome facts: Only open for dinner right now, but they said they'd do lunch in the future if they started getting more volume.  You order at the trailer and they'll bring you your food.  They have outdoor picnic tables to sit at, but only 3 or 4 of them.  I haven't had any trouble getting a seat yet, but that may change.

The Duck Fat Fries were crisp and tasty and the addition of the egg and sauce added a richness usually not seen in fries. However, the Bone Marrow was amaazing. The portion is slightly strange and on the small size there were 2 bones and 3 small slices of bread to slather it on. If you're willing to splurge a little, treat yourself to this!\\n\\nI ordered the Candied Pork Belly for my entree after seeing the rave reviews, but it wasn't as impressive as I expected ): The flavor was real strong, but it was also really salty. I was definitely filled up, but again, they don't give you too much. I tried a bit of the beef shoulder and the duck and I'd have to say that the duck was the only one that tasted very unique.\\n\\nWith such high ratings, my expectations were super high so maybe that's why I was left a bit disappointed by the food (don't get me wrong though, the food is still great).

I will preface this by saying that our family has eaten at almost every Vietnamese restaurant in Portland Metro Area including Vancouver and Pho Thanh has to be by far the best Vietnamese restaurant we have been to. They also offer other Asian cuisine such as Thai and Chinese. \\n\\nThe chefs are \\"old school\\" from Vietnam and not only serve the freshest ingredients but the sauces are uniquely fresh tasting and are not overpowered by the over use of soy sauce. You can taste the fresh vegetables and meats and the sauces are delicate enough to not shrivel the palate. I talked with one of the cooks and he explained they have a repertoire cataloged in their minds of everything from French cuisine to Asian recipes all with the special Vietnamese flair you could find only in Saigon \\"back in the day\\". \\n\\nThe service is excellent and super friendly and very willing to explain in detail what is involved in every dish served. What I especially like is their willingness to modify the dish to serve the customer's taste. Some days I am in the mood for a lot of garlic some days little garlic and a lot of cilantro, some days I like a heavy stir fry sauce and other days I desire very light sauce and if asked they will accommodate. \\n\\nFor a restaurant recently reopened under new ownership, new management and with new chefs they took off running without a stumble. They are experienced restaurateurs and know exactly how to provide excellent customer service and above all excellent food. Weekends can be hectic as it is a popular time for extended families to meet there for lunch and dinner but the service never waivers. \\n\\nIn additional to the excellent Pho one of my favorites like another reviewer's is the Banh Xeo (Vietnamese crepe). The menu description does not do the dish justice and there is enough on the tray to easily feed two if not three diners. In fact the menu descriptions do not do many of the dishes justice. For example, the Tom Mat is described as glazed walnuts and shrimp in special cream sauce. The dish is absolutely delicious, the shrimp is saut√©ed and there is a sweet light glaze on the shrimp along with caramelized walnuts and even my description does not do the dish justice just know that whatever you order you cannot go wrong. I am glad I no longer have to drive across the river for good Vietnamese food I just have to drive down the street for the best Vietnamese food in the area."},{"name":"Kipos Roast Beef","address":"117 Water St","city":"Wakefield","stars":"4","text":"In a town with so many sub places, Kipos has always been my standby.

It took a good five minutes for our waiter to saunter by and ask for a drink order. Another five minutes to bring it and we had to stop him to order food before he slipped away again. He said perhaps four or five words all night. His role apparently was to respond to our requests and then bring things, and in between walk by without looking our direction in case we try to get him to do something else. He did bring us a bottle of water once, but then he grabbed it and took what was left to another table that sat down near us.\\n\\nThe people I was with liked the pickled appetizers and the fried green beans. Some that had been before commented the pickled dish was smaller than it used to be, although they gave you lots of green beans. I had the hamburger which was recommended by a friend. It was cooked right, with a great bun, and shoestring potato fries, which I prefer over the thick cut like the ones at Black Star. All in all a good burger - was it Amazing? ...No. It was on par with Fuddruckers but at $11 a little more pricey, although you do get to sit around hipsters patting themselves on the back for discovering this hidden gem. For dessert we tried \\"milk and cookies\\" and \\"Smores\\". The former consisted of a half glass fo regular milk and one chocolate cookie as well as one oatmeal cookie. A friend we were with commented the cookies are now about half the size they used to be when the place opened. Why they would cut back on something so cheap as cookie dough baffles me, but aparently they did - apparently $5 doesnt cover the cost of a half glass of milk and two big cookies, so they had to make sacrifices. Similarly priced, the Smores consisted of two small graham squares over a large spoonful of marshmallow, chocolate drizzle and lardo. It was rich, but once again tiny. Since there were four of us and we told our robot we wanted to share he brought us four spoons, which made the whole experience even more comical.\\n\\nSo, in conclusion. The food I had was solid, it wasn't spectacular, the service was medicocre, the portions small - apparently shrinking tapas plates for everything including desserts (except for the green beans), and the prices relatively high for some of the items."},{"name":"Tortilleria La Sabrocita","address":"850 E Rundberg, Ste 100","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Authentic.

My family and I are long time patrons of Floramo's and I must say this was the worst dinner ever. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because of our waitress, Sherry. She was terrific even though she had no support from the manager and a kitchen that was really off their game. \\nOn a snowy Friday night we were seated quickly. We ordered drinks which came promptly. We ordered a ribs/steak tips combo, a chicken bona boca, and an eggplant parm. We received salads, and then Sherry came over with what appeared to be two entrees. One of which wasn't ours. She took them away and then came back delivering two other entrees. We were told that the third entree would come shortly. \\nThe ribs were overdone and dry appearing to have been cooked and then reheated. The top of the ribs peeled off like a Slim Jim. They were drier and chewier than usual but the hungry member of our party ate them anyway. Not a good thing when their motto is \\"...where the meat falls off the bone.\\" The steak tips were cooked medium as we had ordered. The eggplant parm was chewy as if it were not done enough. We sent it back. In the meantime, the chicken bona boca arrived and it was fine. The SAME eggplant parm came back again and looked like the kitchen had made an attempt to cook it further in the oven? In any event, it was cooked unevenly with the cheese on top now being burnt. Half of it was still undercooked with the other half appearing to be somewhat cooked. We decided to leave that thing alone and concentrate on the chicken bona boca. \\nWhen Sherry came back to see how things were, we told her that the eggplant was not good. She offered to wrap it up but we declined. We further indicated that it seemed that the kitchen was off its game and she agreed. Apparently, Sherry spoke with the manager who told her that the eggplant appeared to be cooked and that we would have to pay for it. After giving a credit card for payment, Sherry told us that the manager agreed to credit the bill. We discovered that the credit was for $7 - half the cost of the eggplant parm entree. \\nWe never received an apology or a visit from the manager. Sherry was very apologetic, and we appreciated that. \\nThis visit was a huge disappointment. I have to say that I am in no hurry to revisit Floramo's any time soon. I hope that this experience was an anomaly rather than what I can look forward to in the event I revisit Floramo's in the future."},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious.

When I stepped into the restaurant, I was impressed by the design of this place. It looks like a 50s diner, with employees dressed like people from the greasers. Everything on the menu is vegetarian. \\n\\nI don't mind eating vegetarian if the dishes are good enough for me to forget how yummy a delicious burger is or how juicy a piece of medium rare steak is. But everything I tried at Veggie Galaxy made me regret not eating meat that meal. I shared the Eggs Benedict and Stuffed French Toast with my sister. The hollandaise sauce for the Eggs Benedict is not the traditional sauce that you get. I don't even think the sauce at Veggie Galaxy is egg-based. The sauce is not as smooth as the traditional hollandaise sauce and also the spices that they added in the sauce made it taste like a mexican dish. The english muffin also had a different consistency as the usual english muffin from other restaurants.\\n\\nThe French Toast on the other hand, was also kind of different than the usual French Toast you get at other restaurants. The stuffing was good at first but after the third bite, I thought it was very sating and cloying. The stuffing was made from berries mixed with this sour and creamy sauce. It was really hard to finish this dish. \\n\\nThe waitress also seemed very agitated. She was kind of impatient when I was trying to take some time to figure out what to order. I also saw her raising her voice at someone at next  table.

Isn't that their job...to know about how long it would take to get a table? We stayed at the bar. I had to reach across to get a menu myself because the bar tender didn't seem to care whether or not I wanted anything.

It was always a favorite of mine.\\n\\nMy fiance' & I dined here last night (8/31/12) and, I have to say, service and food have gone downhill. majorly We were seated promptly but we weren't even seated for literally 1 minute before our server pounced on us wanting our drink order. I know that may be a good thing for some but I'd like a few minutes to at least look at the drink menu and wine selections. I asked her to come back and, when she did, we gave our order of drinks (beer for him & a very potent raspberry hard tea drink for me), calamari appetizer, and our dinner orders. \\nOur drinks and calamari came quickly. The calamari was hot but it looked like mozzarella sticks. More compressed squid meat than real calamari. It was OK taste wise but I've had better at Stanford's before. Also, they serve it with battered red & green pepper now. We had known this and asked for no peppers. For our dinners, the Brit had 1/2 rack of BBQ ribs, french fries, and cole slaw. I had their special of flat iron steak and 1/2 stuffed lobster.  We ate our appetizer and then waited. Meanwhile, someone behind us ordered something sizzling (I assume the chicken fajitas) and it came out smoking. The whole area we were in filled with smoke making many patrons, including us, choke and cough. This wasn't the last time it happened either. I saw it happen several times during our meal in other areas. We should have been gasping in delight over our food...not to get oxygen. \\nWe waited for quite a while for dinner. Our server came by 3 times to tell us it was coming out in just minutes each time. It was a good 30 minutes after the calamari before we got our meal and I was sadly disappointed. The \\"steak\\" was 5 small 2 inch slices and was so over salted and peppered that I had to dip it in the butter for the lobster to get some of the seasoning off. I still grimaced when eating it. The lobster was small, which I knew it would be, but the majority of the meat had been removed for the shrimp and cream cheese stuffing. There was approximately 2 ounces of lobster meat. I know 20.00 is cheap for surf and turf but that was pretty dinky. You do not get a choice of side dish either. It's a small potato gratin that wasn't bad..just small. This meal is good if you have a good sized appetizer and also a good sized dessert afterwards. Definitely not filling. \\nThe Brit's meal was fine for him. He loves Stanford's ribs and was not disappointed. Their cole slaw leaves something to be desired for me. I've tasted better from Reeser's to be honest.\\nWe ordered dessert of Apple Crisp Ala Mode as I was still hungry (that's saying a lot as I generally don't finish meals & we don't order dessert often. I'm a classic doggy bagger). It was decent enough but the caramel sauce they put on it was overly sweet. Sweeter than caramel sauce needs to be. So, for a meal costing almost 100.00 for 2 people, it really was maybe worth half that. I've definitely had better meals here and better service. I don't know if they have a new chef, new management, or just have changed their practice of food prep but I liked it better just a few months ago when we had gone here. Definitely not one of the favorite restaurants anymore.

So many choices, but I didn't want my wallet to hate me.\\n\\nI started with one of the \\"Whoa-reo\\" sandwich cookies ($2.50), which came in vanilla, salted peanut, or thin mint buttercreams. I chose the Thin Mint one this time. Just an outstanding product here. Two soft, chewy chocolate cookies (with chocolate chips) made me wish I got more than one. Amazing velvety buttercream. An unmistakable Thin Mint presence but not overpowering.\\n\\nBeing a cinnamon roll fanatic, I couldn't pass up Lisa's version of the cinnamon roll ($3.50). It looks like a thick sugar cookie in appearance, but has that springy, chewy nature that reminds me of a gluten-filled cinnamon roll. Inside, you can see a weaving, free-form trail of cinnamon and sugar. Tons of cinnamon in there! From what I was told, the cream cheese frosting uses tofu. Would have fooled me. Again, the frosting was on point, controlled sweetness.\\n\\nOh, and you can get your espresso and alcohol fix here. Cocktails, wine, and beer!

But it is the same water glasses and, more importantly, some of the same cooks... presumably those in the country legally... or at least willfully.  Typhoon was a favorite of mine and any of my friends.  We were shocked, outraged when the behind-the-scenes goings-on were revealed.  But, we were also, selfishly, sad to loose that great food.  So, we were delighted to visit Thai Bloom and find so many of our old favorites faithfully recreated.  \\n\\nMy personal Typhoon favorite was Drunken Noodles with Beef and Mushrooms.  I rationed myself allowing myself to have it only every-other time.  Well, I can't remember where I was in that regime, so I decided to allow myself to begin anew.

I'd feel okay about ending things here and just let an average burger be an average burger, save for one thing: The signs lining the dining room proclaiming love from Zagat Guide, various magazines, newspapers and the like.\\n\\nOkay, Five Guys, if you really want to walk the walk of a four or five star burger place rather than just hanging up some posters that talk the talk, listen close to my advice:\\n\\n1. That's good, fresh beef you have and you show the discipline and control not to overcook it... good, but... you could take a half second to season it more and get a hint of grill char on there without drying things out. Your main ingredient is on the right track, just save it from the doldrums of blandness.\\n\\n2. Next is that bun of yours. Try toasting it (or toasting it more) with a little butter or margarine on the face. That would give the bun better structure to hold the sandwich together (less mush), better texture in the mouth and better flavor on the tongue. \\n\\n3. You're proud of the extensive list of condiment options available on every burger for no extra charge. You have both grilled and raw onions - how about both sweet and dill pickles? Many of us believe dills are essential to a proper burger, and those sweet ones just don't do it for us. Just sayin'.\\n\\n4. Find a way to offer a small side of fries along with a burger. I understand every batch is made to order and I can respect that. However when fries cost an additional $3, you may risk elevating your full-meal price point to a level where you're going to be judged by even higher expectations.\\n\\nAll that aside, Five Guys, you're pretty A-OK just as you are. Just take down those silly posters and cast aside the pretense and pressure of being anything other than a totally average burger shop. You'd be in plenty good company."},{"name":"Casablanca Restaurant","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Great menu and wine list.

The Caboose is extremely generous with the toppings, as you can see, the cheese is quality, the sauce non-offensive, and the crust holds up well upon delivery, through consumption, and even when left out on the counter overnight, and eaten the next morning (the true test for me on how good a pizza is). Their crust is not thin, and not thick, but crispy and chewy at the same time, with a hint of buttery flavoring goodness.\\n\\nNo puddles of grease, no congealed cheese the next morning, and probably my favorite thing about the whole experience, is a really excellent grade of hand-pulled Italian sausage, packed with flavor and with adequate amounts of fennel (to my taste).\\n\\nThe other pork toppings are equally up to my standards. The mushrooms and black olives, not so much, but I really don't care about them anyway.\\n\\nI don't really rate the places I go to, other than to say as I have here, whether they meet my preferences, or not, and perhaps that helps you decide whether they meet your own ideals.\\n\\nNo online ordering.

Finally we had time to give it a go. Very pleased that we did. The interior of the establishment is very hometown, local bar feel - like a delightfully downgraded TacoMac if that makes  sense. It had all of the pleasures that a large sports bar can afford, with a personal feel. You can seat yourself in any of the large booths or tables. The place is well lit but cozy. You can see the bartender greeting and chatting with regulars, and that was quite wonderful. Made me want to continue coming here. \\n\\nBeer selection wasn't too bad - definitely not what I would consider top notch, but there were a few crafts beers for decent prices and a couple on tap. Food selection was also pretty good - your standard bar and pub food - burgers, wings, salads, chicken sandwiches, and apparently they have some of the meanest tater tots around. (Can't believe I just said that) I ordered wings and fries, and was told that the wings were jumbo... definitely weren't jumbo in my opinion. To me they seemed a standard size and they only had like three sauce selections. I just got the Buffalo because I don't believe in BBQ or Lemon Pepper on wings, but I couldn't choose mild, medium, hot, etc. It was just one flavor. I was a little disappointed in them because they felt overcooked and crunchy and the sauce was a little boring. The fries were delicious but tricky, they are string fries so in order to feel like you are taking a legit bite, you have to stuff about 12 in your mouth. By the end of five minutes, they are gone. \\n\\nThough the food wasn't my favorite, it seemed like there was enough options left to try that I didn't leave feeling like I wasted my time. I will definitely come back and try other things like the burgers. Too bad the prices are a little high - for the same price I could easily find better tasting wings and a side of fries. You had to add three bucks for fries here. \\n\\nService was so-so. Our waitress was really nice and helpful, but it wasn't anything super special.

Overall the food was very good with minor criticisms.  The kitchen should work to ensure that all items on the plate are as good as the others.  The brunswick stew was a bit too thick and sweet.  This, probably a result of continuous cooking on a steam table.  The stew could have possibly been thinned with a bit of vinegar which would have had a better result.  Fish and Chips entree was very good.  The cod fish  filets were hot and not oily at all.  The fries however were too old and no longer crispy.   The pulled pork entree was rated very good as well.  A traditional bun instead of the buttery/oily Texas toast would have been preferred.  The small pate buffalo wings were also very good.  The server advised that they had run out of celery.  Since there are two grocery stores within a half mile, this (as minor as it was) should not have happened.

They don't. If you have a bill of $20 something, they'll say you need to have an order or $30 or more to use debit. FREAKING DEBIT COSTS 5 CENTS PER TRANSACTION.  A freaking order of $20 something or more paid with mc or visa will cost 40 to 50 cents per transaction. Not that expensive. They are deceiving customers into thinking they take mc and visa. But when it's time to pay they reject your form of payment and will only take cash. They will say anything to reject your visa/mc payment. what if you were one of those people who don't carry a spare cash fund and only have debit and/or visa? They'll probably send you downstairs to vancity to withdraw cash to pay the bill and if you are not an exchange network or acculink member you'll have to pay vancity 2 bucks to take out cash to pay for your meal. If You ever decide to eat here, make sure to bring cash with you. They may claim they take credit and advertise on their door they take it, but in reality they actually don't take it. Now if they slapped a sign saying they only took cash then I would be fine with it. But to deceive people like that, I'm totally not coming back again.

I think part of the reason was because I had always assumed they meant waffle fries and not an actual waffle. Once I heard it was an actual waffle, I felt compelled to go. Chicken and Waffles??? I had never had such a combination before, so we gathered a group up and decided to try the famous Atlanta establishment.\\n\\nThe wait was pretty long, with the line spilling out into the sidewalk. I've actually seen people crowded around this area before, but I never realized that they were all waiting to get into Gladys Knight's. I just thought they were loitering. The wait was nearly as bad as waiting to get into a brunch place in Atlanta on the weekend. Occasionally, the hostess came out to call names, it was like the lottery, \\"is it me? is it me?!? awww....\\" Finally, it was our turn. How exciting! We even had one group try to pretend to be ours to take it. I gues s you can't blame them for the attempt.\\n\\nThe interior was relatively nice. It seemed to surprise most new comers - I had heard several people in line comment on it. The restaurant is clean as are the bathrooms.\\n\\nService: From start to finish, I have to say that the service was great. Everyone was very polite, professional, and personable. We questioned our server when he didn't write a single thing down for our large group, but he said that he had not done so all day. When we were all done ordering, he quickly repeated our order back to us flawlessly and proceeded to the kitchen. Our order came out in a timely fashion and everything was in place. The only thing remotely flawed about the drink orders is that they did not refill drinks very often and our glasses were taken away from us when we they did so, which is a nono in most restaurants. Still, I loved the service and our guy was awesome.\\n\\n\\nFood: Some food was better than others. If you go, I suggest getting the fried chicken and a separate waffle rather than the midnight train, which comes with wings.\\n\\n    * Things we liked:\\n          o Sweet Tea : not the best but pretty good and not too sweet. It is better than the Uptown, which is their version of the Arnold Palmer\\n          o Fried Chicken: I liked their fried chicken. It wasn't out of this world, but it was pretty darn good. It was fried evenly on all sides and came out in a beautiful golden color. It was also not overly greasy or salty. I only wish that it had just a bit more crisp.\\n          o Baked Chicken? I didn't get this, but the person at our table devoured it so I'm assuming it is pretty acceptable\\n          o Grits\\n          o Fried Corn\\n          o Black Eye Peas\\n          o Corn Bread\\n          o Waffle\\n    * Things that were just okay\\n          o Wings: The people at our table liked them but weren't raving about it or anything...in other words, the wings aren't worth the long wait in line\\n          o Mac & Cheese\\n          o Mash Potatoes\\n    * Things I'll never get again\\n          o Collar Greens: Surprisingly, these were not that great. I do like collard greens, but these were a bit tough and there was something about the taste that didn't work for me. I've had hospital greens that have tasted better. (but to the defense of the restaurant, the hospital greens I had were pretty good)\\n\\nIn summary, I'd go back again if a friend were in from out of town or if the wait happened not to be so long. The service is great as well as welcoming. It's something I suggest every Atlantan do at least once.\\n\\nfull review with pics: http://vyatl.blogspot.com/2008/06/chicken-and-waffles.html"},{"name":"Harp & Celt Irish Pub & Restaurant","address":"25 S Magnolia Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"An awesome Irish dining experience.\\n\\nI came with a friend of mine to Harp & Celt for lunch. It is located on Magnolia near downtown Orlando, so it was a very easy walk for us from work. When we arrived, the first thing I noticed was the interesting setup for the restaurant. There are multiple areas associated with this restaurant: one side is a more bar-focused area, the other side seemed to be more dining-focused, and an upstairs area that wasn't open at the time. I've also driven by and seen people in an outdoor area that is adjacent to the restaurant. One thing for sure: this place has plenty of seating room!\\n\\nWe sat down on the bar side and starting talking with the waitress. The interested part of this side of the restaurant is the lower ceilings, so you don't feel engulfed my the largeness of the venue.

She strongly recommended a Guinness and fish and chips, which I had already heard were very good, so I ordered that combo. After immediately receiving my drink, I only waited about 10 minutes to receive my meal.

You'll get what I mean when you give this place a try! I had my fair share of Thai food.. especially around allston, brighton & brookline. Everyone seems to love dok bua but I never thought it was anything spectacular. Before Bangkok Bistro, I used to go to new rod dee but it's a cash only place, so it's so inconvenient to always have to hit up the atm beforehand.. especially if you're starving.

Ever since I tried Bangkok Bistro, I will not go back to any other Thai places because no other thai places can compare to Bangkok Bistro's awesome delicious food, greatly big portioned entrees & exceptional service. \\n\\nSome of the dishes I really recommend are their crab rangoon, pad thai, drunken noodle, grapow noodle w/ beef, spicy eggplant, pineapple fried rice, mango fried rice, indonesian fried rice, crispy chicken and many more. As for drinks, their thai iced tea is the best one i tried so far and definitely a drink I can have everyday and not get sick of it. After the delicious entrees, you gotta reward yourself with a well deserved dessert. Definitely try their fried ice cream.

It is very affordable, and most of the food we've had, while not exceptional, has been good enough.\\n\\nThe restaurant's decor doesn't really have a theme.  I think they're trying for a lite-island theme with ceiling revolving fans and a large fish tank by the bar, but it is several steps below Bahama Breeze in cohesiveness.\\n\\nIt's not one of my favorite restaurants, but since it is in my neck of the woods, it is right now, one of the best choices for the BVL/Hunter's Creek area, as along as you're not expecting anything fancy.\\n\\nService has been pretty good, though the ladies at the bar need to chill a bit with the public chiding of trainees.  I felt so bad for the young lady trying to survive the hectic environment that I tipped her extra, because the teachers were being impatient and mean, talking and laughing about her behind her back, but foolishly in front of the patrons.  They probably didn't remember every first days of any job and how you are so freakin' nervous, you keep making mistakes.  Maybe management should remind them.\\n\\nAnyway, Cheddar's is probably another option if you're considering chain restaurants like Ruby Tuesday's and Friday's.  It's not going to beat Abuelo's down a block or the casual fun of Jimmy Hula's a couple clicks away, but it is better than the local Logan's, Chili's, Olive Garden (random service quality), and Macaroni Grill.\\n\\nGive it a try if you drive by and don't see a lot of people waiting outside it.

I bit into something that wasn't supposed to be in my meal (bone, glass, metal?) and broke a tooth!  The manager was very apologetic and told me to contact them as soon as I had the tooth fixed.  I tried, but the owner, Sari Abul-Jubain, dodged my calls for about 2 weeks before finally telling me, \\"That COULDN'T have happened here (thus accusing me of lying), and, besides, we don't take responsibility for any accidents like this.\\"  He was as unfriendly and unreasonable as he could be.  So my group not only spent $300+ for overpriced, average food and drink, but I had to lay out another $700+ to have my tooth fixed.  This was REALLY an overpriced meal.  You can get better, cheaper Middle Eastern food in lots of places whose owners treat their clients with genuine respect and who wouldn't dream of not taking responsibility if an accident happens in their establishment.

I then asked where the restroom was and was kindly given directions. I knew that moment that I was going to have a wonderful time.. first impressions are Uber important.

The food was UNBELIEVABLY SPECTACULAR. . The brizzomo (sp?).. aka sea bass was delish. Throughout our dining experience we were asked how everything was by managers... not just one but at least 2!!!!  Now I want to share where my dining experience went from wonderful to exemplary!!!  In order to not bore you with the finer details, I will give you the synopsis. I was having trouble with my parking ticket and was trying to use the validation that one of the general managers gave me but kept getting errors. The parking attendees were rude and didnt care. She wanted me to pay 20.00. Ahhh!!! Thankfully MIT the GM gave me his business card so I called him. Another GM came down to the parking lot and took care of it and made sure I got out of the parking lot ok!!! Who does that these days???? No one except DOLCE. Thank you again for making that experience that could have been awful - great!!! So if you are contemplating going then I hope this review convinces you to dine and experience DOLCE.

The service was not very good.\\n\\nLong version:  I went to Community Smith as part of a group of 4 people on a recent Saturday night.  We sat at a table in the back, which was fine.  We noticed pretty quickly that the service was a little odd.  \\n\\nFirst, the waitress came to take our drink orders. She took orders from two people, and when the other two people in the party expressed the slightest hesitation about knowing what they wanted, she departed to put in the first two drink orders and left the other two people in my party high-and-dry.  That might have been ok if she had come back immediately, but it was probably another 5-10 minutes before she came back to complete the drink order.\\n\\nWhen she did come back, she didn't immediately try to take the drink order for my other two dining companions. Instead, she launched into her description of the soup of the day, and when one of my companions expressed an interest, she said \\"oh, great, you want that?\\" and took it down as an appetizer order and then decided to take appetizer orders from the rest of us. We went along with it because we were caught a little off guard.  Only after completing the appetizer orders did she take the drink order from my other two dining companions.  The waitress left before taking our entree orders. \\n\\nFast forward to 10 minutes later, the drinks arrive along with our appetizers. Our entree order had not been taken yet.  Only after the appetizers were delivered did the waitress take our entree oder.  The pace at which orders were taken and food/drinks delivered was just bizarre.  Despite the service problems, the appetizers were pretty good. The calamari was very tasty, though I think the squid was sliced too thin. It would have been a bit better with fewer but larger chunks of meat.  The chicken soup was excellent.\\n\\nI had a flat iron steak, which was wonderful. Everyone in my party loved their food (red fish, scallops, and pork chops). But even then, there were service hiccups -- for example, the person who ordered the large pork chop was never even offered a steak knife and was left with a simple, non-sharpened table knife.  \\n\\nAfter we finished our entrees, the waitress disappeared for about 20 minutes and never so much as offered a dessert menu or otherwise followed up.  I had to flag her down to ask for the check because our 2 hours of free parking was almost up.\\n\\nI'm not going to rush back, but I'd be willing to give it another shot. Hopefully the service will be better next time."},{"name":"Old Tyme Italian Cuisine","address":"612 Boston St","city":"Lynn","stars":"4","text":"The food here is average.

Seriously. Don't bother. The food was terrible. This is the furthest thing from \\"fine dining\\" that I can imagine, and I can't even believe they are still in business. They serve FROZEN VEGGIES with your $30 entree. (Really??) The bread baskets are grey and fuzzy around the edges from being dirty. The salt shakers were so caked up with moisture inside that we had to unscrew the cap to get any salt. \\n\\nTo be fair, lamb kabobs were okay as far as taste goes, but all of the meat was overcooked and tough (had ordered the combo trio of skewers). The bread was hot and fresh and tasty enough - I'll give credit where credit is due.\\n\\nThe bathrooms were sub-par and there are drill holes punched in on all the walls of the partitions. There were no paper towels in the handicap bathroom so I had to go to the main sink to get any to dry my hands. Again, fine dining? Really?\\n\\nThe server was nice enough, but when we asked for recommendations she said that everything was good, and what do we like? Chicken? Seafood? Spicy? When my husband said he liked spicy food, she proceeded to tell him that nothing on their menu is spicy. Um. Okay. So why even mention that as an option?\\n\\nThere were only two other couples in there on a Sunday at around 5:00. I would be surprised if this place was in business next time we make our way to Orlando. Very dissapointed. Waste of our time and money.

I was slightly worried about our dress attire since I was in my work clothes and he was dressed very casual (it was a last minute decision to go to a nice restaurant.) Although everyone around us was dressed nice we felt completely comfortable in what we were wearing which was a relief. They took our jackets immediately upon arrival and we were seated ten minutes before our reservation time. The decor is warm, festive yet classy, and seemed updated and very well kept for such an old area in Boston. \\n\\nEverything we ate was amazing including the complimentary bread, olives and pesto. We got the tartar for an appetizer which was light, fresh and flavorful. I got the veal with my side customized to fit my liking. He got a seafood pasta dish and was very pleased, especially with the texture and consistency of the pasta. He can be very hard to please when we go out to dinner which usually causes anxiety in me since I know it takes a lot for everything to run smoothly between all parts of the restaurant. We also both got dessert and tea. Not a single crumb was left behind. Neither of us drink and it was especially nice to not have a sever try to sell us when we didn't order alcohol which is a problem we often run into. Our server was simply there to allow us to have a nice experience catered to us. \\n\\nWith that being said, service was OUTSTANDING! I believe our server's name was Irma (I apologize if I am misremembering.) A warm and incredibly friendly woman from Ireland. I've worked in restaurants for the last eleven years and it is not often you see a server have the kind of hospitality she has. She was incredibly friendly, on top of table maintenance, not overbearing, funny, helpful, knew the menu very well, and almost made us feel like we were family she was hosting at her house and not like an order taker at a restaurant just waiting for her tip at the end. She's a real professional and has natural qualities that I have to work on at my own job. I not only thank her for such a great experience at Mama Maria but also for reminding me how I should be leading the restaurant I Work at and the kind of service I can only hope my coworkers and I give when people come see us for a great experience. The bussers did a wonderful job as well. \\nI couldn't give this a below perfect rating! Check it out for yourself.

I inspected and analyzed the cheese for soft meltedness. I nibbled on some chicken for even doneness. Well... IT DID LOOK ALRIGHT. Thanks for asking!! I have no doubt they would've redone it if I'd had any complaints!\\n\\nLet me start at the beginning. A BOGO offer in the mail got me to check this place out. It's basically like Subway, but for pizza instead of subs. And I think Pieology is better at pizza than Subway is at subs. \\n\\nI was somewhat wary after seeing some of these Yelp reviews, but ended up being pleasantly surprised. \\n\\nI got there around 7pm on a Monday, so there was a bit of a line, but it moved quickly. Tip: the outdoor patio has a great deal of seating, and I think is under utilized. Also, they have chairs for babies inside!\\n\\nI was excited to build my own pizzas with unlimited toppings for $8, and I liked how they had all the options laid out on the walls right by the line (check out my pics). By the way, this place may be an option if you're into gluten-free crust or vegan cheese!\\n\\nI also really like how everything from the crust making to the saucing to the cheesing to the topping to the baking is in plain sight. As such, I don't understand the other reviewers' complaints about too much cheese and so on. The staffers are VERY fast-paced and efficient, but they're attentive and literally asking you what you want: surely you can politely insert a \\"maybe less cheese please\\"!\\n\\nAnyway, I really got experimental because of the unlimited toppings: I cheesed my herbal butter + red sauced crust with mozzarella and Gorgonzola, then I topped it with banana peppers, sun dried tomatoes, basil, and mushrooms + pepperoni, sausage, and spicy chicken (well-endorsed by Hailey, an awesome / friendly shift leader!). My friend just topped hers with black olives and regular chicken, and then we checked out. \\n\\nLike I said, the manager brought out our pizzas :)\\n\\nMy friend and I were both happy with our choices, and we each had to take half a pizza home. I'm sure my recipe isn't for everybody, but I'll be repeating it for sure! Based off my visit, I think this place is good at what it does. There was no line when we were done. \\n\\nMinor cons: I really did not like their music (kinda old mainstream pop: think literally Miley Cyrus Bangerz), and there were no paper towels in the restroom. \\n\\nAs were leaving, the pizza makers smilingly said their thanks and have-a-good-days, and it sounded genuine, and then we stepped out into a glorious, cozy sunset with our very happily full bellies.

The shiny, new terminus building totally takes that away.  The Flying Biscuit lost its quaintness and uniqueness at this location.  If you see my review for the Midtown location, it was a totally different experience. I went with several friends for brunch this time. While we didn't have to wait long, the place was packed. I ordered the trusty pancakes because I knew I'd like them.  That's the reason for star number one.  The oraganic oatmeal pancakes with peaches were yummy.   But they tasted just like soft, fluffy oatmeal cookies - no syrup needed. So I wouldn't put them in the same category as pancakes.  The reason for star number 2: the mimosa. They give you a mini bottle of champange with your OJ, which I thought was nice.  But that's where the positives end.   The namesake, biscuits, weren't good at all. They were doughy and tasted uncooked.  Plus, my friends warned me not to try the jam, so the biscuit kept sticking to the roof of my mouth.  What's a biscuit without jelly?  The \\"salsa\\" on the eggs was marinara sauce.  Nobody in the group liked the bloody marys.  It was made with sake instead of vodka. And a spicy okra leaf instead of celery. I would rename it something else, anything but a bloody mary.  I was going to stay for a 2nd mimosa, but the waitress never came back. So we left. We were in a larger group, so we were prettty loud.  The other tables were only parties of 2 or 3, so they were all pretty quiet.

They utilized the majority of the previous Panera bread floor plan including former kitchen with very little need for a kitchen of their own making the main space quite spacious. It's relatively good acoustics and white noise hum for the space and the number of people in it when we visited. People were studying, eating, on dates, and socializing--young, old, families--nice mix that wasn't clashing much. \\n\\nService was decent with lots of folks delivering food utilizing numbered signs after ordering at the front. The lines are quite long and plenty of people snagging first come first serve seating. We found a spot outside of peak hours but barely. I suspect this will die down over time. Some reorientation or expedience in waiting line could be due--mobile cashier with iPad and square reader?\\n\\nFood was fairly decent with some hits and misses. The bento boxes had legit miso soup -- flavorful and complex unlike most generic sushi restaurant mixes. The brisket was great. The karaage was lightly fried and a little wet/medium cooked chicken on the inside. Nice for some but I bet many people might get skeeved out by it. The hand rolls are pretty small but Scottish salmon had great balance and umami. The roll cakes were a surprising hit. The matcha good but the yellow cake with custard was great. The matcha and sesame cookies were okay. \\n\\nDrinks were alright. The complex black tea was nice but agreed with other reviewers that the matcha was quite watered down. \\n\\nPrice was a tad expensive for what you get. Some things were so quality despite the size (Scottish salmon hand roll) that it made sense. Others -- whether the tea or matcha -- was not.

Steak was okay but nothing you cannot get at Ninety Nine.\\n\\n4. Baked Seafood Casserole was good but flat tasting and cole slaw very dry.\\n\\nSummary, Foley's is a nice local restaurant with nice decor but a bit overpriced for food that is average at best. You can get the same meal at Ninety Nine for less money."},{"name":"Domino's","address":"553 W Main St","city":"Plain City","stars":"2.5","text":"There have been some changes over the years in Plain City pizza offerings.  Some places have closed, some have reinvented themselves.  And now we have a chain.  I know some people don't want them coming in, though McDonald's has been here for decades.

And it looks like they have expanded their menu, and they have quite a few things besides pizza.  Pasta, sandwiches, wings, and \\"specialty chicken.\\"  I tried an Italian sub, and some chicken.\\n\\nThe sub was good, not great.  Decent bread, good meat and veggies, toasted just right.  The chicken was a little unusual: chunks of breaded boneless chicken, topped with cheese and whatever toppings come on your selection.  I got tomato bacon, and there were large chunks of both, plus some ham buried in the cheese.  Hard to eat without a fork, and a bit messy even then, it was pretty good.  Tender, tasty, and filling.  It'd make a nice shareable appetizer, or meal.\\n\\nService was good.  There is plenty of parking, and a few tables inside.  Prices are reasonable.

Our waitress, was unknowing of the bottle delivery and continued to chat up another table and do whatever. Now, on a Monday night, if a table orders a big bottle of wine from the cellar, I think as a manager I would take that opportunity to greet the table and open it if the waitress was pre-disposed...especially after 20 minutes.\\nWhen she finally brought the bottle to the table, the wine service was a little off...loud popping of the cork, 10 year old wine and didn't decant, cork left on the screw and right into her pocket.

Several other reviewers have stated that these guys rush you out of your table after they are done preparing the food and serving it to you.  I am now in complete agreement with these people.  The food was just as great as it was last time - great Magical Dining Month Menu by the way - and our chef was personable and entertaining.  But the hostesses were absolutely awful; particularly the lady that came by while we were around halfway finished eating, asking to box up all our stuff mid-meal and to bring our checks.  It was clear that it was an attempt to pressure us all out of the table so they could seat the next group.  I get it, a business is a business and you're in it to make money.  But if you're going to run a restaurant and advertise it as a high end quality place, you better be prepared to let your guests take their time to eat, drink, and enjoy themselves.  The hostess was so awful, in fact, that she ran off before I could give her my Kobe Rewards membership ID - so essentially I was screwed out of getting points that I could have used for a discount on my next time here.  The hostess rushing us essentially ruined what could have been a great experience to the point where it became frustrating and disappointing.  The way it stands right now, people might as well just order stuff to go, because that's basically how fast you guys rush us out of our tables anyway.  If anyone in management is reading this, please either change your policy of rushing people out of their tables or, if that is not your policy, please instruct your hostesses to stop doing that."},{"name":"Abby Lane","address":"255 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We came here before a show.

So, the parking lot was busy. There was only one other party waiting ahead of us, however, and the hostess told us that our wait would be about 15 minutes. So, we took the buzzer and waited. As the waiting area filled up with more and more parties, nobody was seated about a half hour. We figured that it's hard to predict sometimes. Then, they seated a large party that came in after us. Again, we figured, oh well, maybe there was a large table available and we are just a party of 2. Then, after a very long 55 minutes, they seated a party of 3 that came in after us. We left extremely frustrated. The 2 young women at the hostess station who were trying to manage the growing crowd, the constantly ringing telephone, and seating people simply seemed to be in way over their heads.

The restaurant was not particularly busy (this was written during the \\"Arctic Blast\\" of January 2015) but that did not keep the staff from being attentive and friendly, but they also weren't overwhelmingly attentive due to boredom or anything like that.  \\n\\nI had a Maki Sushi lunch combo with spicy salmon roll and barbecued eel roll.  I sat at the sushi bar where I could see my lunch being prepared, and the chef was very professional and precise with his preparation.  It was fun to watch.  \\n\\nThe meal came with a miso soup.  It was hardly as salty and overwhelming as a lot of miso, and came with some seaweed (I believe) torn up into the bowl.  It was flavorful and delicious, possibly the best miso I've had.  And it was nice and warm on a cold crappy day... :)  \\n\\nThe spicy salmon had a very clean flavor to it.  Sometimes I find that spicy sushi is just a smattering of spices and herbs on top of a regular roll, but that was not the case as this salmon was actually of a delicious chopped-and-seasoned salmon.  There was not a lot of mayo flavor as you sometimes get either.  It was not too spicy but just perfectly warm.  \\n\\nThe barbecued eel had a more understated sauce than I am generally accustomed with my eel, and that was very nice.  It was slightly, not unpleasantly, sweeter than I am used to as well, but it did not overwhelm the taste of the eel itself.  A little soy sauce made the entire bite delicious.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere was sparse but fun - this would be a great spot for a group of people, for sure ."},{"name":"TenOak","address":"409 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"If you're a Whiskey lover like I am, then Ten Oak is a pretty cool place to chill and enjoy yourself.

The first two times everything was good. Pizza was good everything was decent. Not spectacular, but about what you expect from a chain pizza store. My last two experiences with this particular location have been horrible. Whoever writes the schedule for this particular store is incompetent. The last time I placed an order it took more than an hour and 35 minutes for my pizza to come. When I called the store they told me they only have one driver.  The driver called me several times to keep me up-to-date on the delays and apologized repeatedly. I paid for the order and ate it, and it was fine. Tonight however my patience was that an end. I placed my order at 1:53. It is now 3:29 and there's no food here yet. That's an hour and 35 minutes. I called them and canceled my order. The guy on the phone said \\"well they're already on their way\\". If they ever show up at my house I'll turn them away. I'm not paying for a pizza that I ordered an hour and a half agoNo way.

Of course they wouldn't seat us without the rest of the group but I was sure to ask for seating for 15. We waited roughly 20-25 mins for the remainder of the group to arrive and be seated, to have them now tell us that they can only put 10 together and the other 5 would have to sit at a booth across the isle from us. That kinda pissed me off because they had 30 minutes to tell me that my party wasn't going to be able to fit together. I was asked about boosters and high chairs when I first arrived but I was not told that they only seat up to 10. We tried to make that work for a few minutes but then was constantly reprimanded for being in the isle. Or shall I say trying to conduct our meeting from across the isle. We eventually packed in tight enough to fit us all around the 2 tables they pushed together and ordered. They charge 1.50 for Tea and Lemonade refill by the way, in the south! One person didn't order, another ate in his lap and one person didn't get their food until 10 mins after all the other orders came out.

I made a reservation and we were seated promptly although it was apparent that my request for a nice table, as we were celebrating my wife's birthday, was not read as the hostess had no idea what I was talking about. She did try an accommodate us the best she could though. We were served bread and water very quickly by a new young girl very cheery and it was her first night. Our waitress came over a few minutes later with menus etc. I then wanted to order a bottle of wine but our waitress totally ignored the fact that not only were we waiting for her but the table of four next to us was also waiting to order their meal. They had been there for awhile. Our waitress decided that her social life was more important than her job and was talking to a couple at a table for about 15-20 minutes before she decided to get back to work. She came by our table and I had to flag her down to get our wine order in. Then she went to the table of 4 and one of the guests indicated they had been waiting for awhile. The waitress snapped back with \\"I was right over there!\\". As the night went on we finally got our meal and were ready to have coffee and dessert but our waitress showed up with the bill so I said \\"I guess we're done\\". At this she asked if the girl who served us our water offered us dessert. I thought this odd seeing the girl was not our waitress but I felt she was getting thrown under the bus for our waitress's incompetence. Again it was the girl's first night and she was very good, in fact I wish she had been our server for the night. This other waitress had an attitude of arrogance right from the beginning of the night. Anyway I paid the bill, left a tip and we went to another restaurant to finish our night. While there the shift manager from the Pietro called and said she heard that I was \\"disappointed\\". Kudos to her for calling but when I explained what had happened she basically said thank you and that was it. It was clear to me that our waitress was essentially covering her butt and threw the young girl out to take the blame when IMHO it was the waitresses' lack of competence in her job that was to blame.

We also received jalapeno corn muffins which were moist, but could have been a little sweeter to offset the tons of peppers in them. I got the shrimp and grits (~$17). 5 medium sized shrimp and a ton of grits and cheese. The taste was good, but I could have done with a few more shrimp. My partner got their signature burger (~$17). It comes with a bbq sauce which he asked for on the side; it did not come on the side. We were pretty hungry so he just ate it, but I could tell he wished he'd said something. It was a burger with a bunch of stuff on it but none of it had much flavor unfortunately. \\nOur waitress was very bubbly and I wish I remembered her name because she was great.

My family and I couldn't decide what to order so we ended up ordering eleven different things: 5 appetizers-3 pastas-2 main courses-1 dessert. It was a culinary exploration of their menu and an amazing experience! \\n\\n1. foccacia: fantastic! best foccacia i've ever had. it was cut into six slices like miny pizzas with a nice balance of cheese and vegetables and a perfectly crispy crust. \\n2. burrata: this was one of the daily specials and my favorite dish we ordered. the burrata had a wonderful flavor and was very smooth and creamy. \\n3. prosciutto and salami plate: really nice portion of prosciutto and 3-5 different kinds of salami. perfect appetizer for two (even if it's your only appetizer) \\n4. foie gras parfait: good, but not particularly remarkable in any way. \\n4. octopus carpaccio: this was actually the only disappointing thing we ordered - it looked absolutely delicious in pictures and on the table, but the flavors just weren't there. pretty bland and something we wouldn't order again. \\n5. ricotta gnocchi: the gnocchi was good but what made the dish was the pork cheeks. There were several small slices of the meat and they were very tender and flavorful.\\n6. tagliarini w/ mushrooms and olive oil: this was a highlight; the mushrooms were delicious and the dish was light and well balanced \\n7. linguine nero: the seafood atop the dark noodles was delicious! the lobster pieces, in particular, were absolutely mouthwatering \\n8. halibut: so by this time, we were getting full. I remember that the halibut was well cooked but overall, just OK. good size portion of fish. \\n9. short rib: this was another fantastic dish with white truffle butter and potato puree. the meat was very tender and we received quite a large portion of fish. \\n10. tiramisu: just OK. i had just had some homemade tiramisu earlier in the week and I couldn't help but think that that one was better. to be fair though, we were all very stuffed at this point. \\n\\nIn summary, I'd say the must-order items are as follows: Foccacia, burrata, prosciutto/salami, linguine nero, and the short rib entree. This is a lot of food. All of it will be presented beautifully and with excellent service! \\n\\nTry your meal with the negroni or the Cal y Canto Tempranillo!"},{"name":"Hanabi","address":"2525 W Anderson Ln, Ste 120","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"My gf and I live very close to Hanabi and we've driven by a couple of times since we noticed it. We weren't sure if it was a restaurant or some type design office from the outside (it's Japanese food). So today we decided to drop by and see how the place was. I would describe it as comfortable, pleasant, and aesthetically pleasing.\\n\\nWhen you walk in you're greeted by almost everyone working and you may get \\"welcome\\" in an assortment of different languages. I believe the owners are Korean though because I could understand when they were speaking to a few Korean customers in Korean. So the place is very clean and comfortable inside, if you hear a loud cracking or a bang don't be alarmed it's just the bamboo wall settling haha.\\n\\nMy gf and I ordered the lunch Bento Box. I'm normally not a fan of these \\"boxes\\" because I feel like usually the potions are small and the box is just there to make you feel like you're getting enough. Surprisingly the Bento Box was just right, not too much to where we needed togo boxes but just enough to satisfy me.\\n\\nI got the Filet Mignon and I asked for medium rare but when I got it the meet was a little more rare than medium. It was ok though because I'm not picky, I asked for their spicy sauce and it came out like the mayo sauce some places have with a small kick. It was very tasty, you get 1/2 a California roll, miso soup, ginger salad, 2 spring rolls,  your main meat and rice. It was pretty well portioned.\\n\\nMy gf got the Teryaki Chicken, now I was skeptical about this because I'm used to seeing teryaki chicken that is so brown from the sauce anything that doesn't look like that, in my mind, can't be teryaki. I was wrong, this chicken was slightly tanned but tasted delicious, easily the best teryaki chicken I've had in the US. SHe had the same sides in her Bento Box otherwise.\\n\\nThe sides were good, the salad was fresh and...well umm salady, and the spring rolls were really hot and fresh, we also enjoyed the cali roll. Oh! Before I forget, we also had the Mocchi Ice cream, oh my gerrrrrd so delicious, we had Green Tea with some strawberry sauce, man that was so yummy. It's really cold if you try to eat a whole side at once so take it easy and just enjoy it.\\n\\nThe service was good, our server was pretty outgoing and funny. He was also knowledgeable about the food which is a plus. We saw the dinner menu which is about 10 pages more than the 1 page lunch menu so I think next time we'll give it a shot at dinner time. Hanabi is new and just opened less than a month ago so they're offering 15% grand opening discounts. This place is definitely worth a look.\\n\\nP.S.\\nThey have alcohol, it was too early for me at lunch though."},{"name":"Bin 26 Enoteca","address":"26 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Wow!

The free appetizer was either breaded scallops (5 pieces) at $3.95 or fried squid rings (5 pieces) at $6.95.  I picked the fried squid rings as it cost more.

The bowl of soup and noodle was quite big and the deep fried pork katsu tasted great. The herbed pork bone soup was excellent as well.  The food that we ordered was not too salty.

That's all. We read a review that persuaded us to check it out. We called ahead to reserve a table and they didn't even ask for a name. When we arrived, there were three people dining and four unbussed tables. They sat us at the cash wrap. The waiter was a little helpful with helping us pronounce wines from their list, but that's where I draw the line. He had only been working there for 2 hours and their was another kid making pizzas while talking on his cell phone. His name was Bruno. This kid told us to get a calzone because he hated making pizzas. So we decided and pizza despite his recommendation. Then our original waiter left us and went home. The owner came up to us when we were in the middle of our meal and asked we got any bread? So he went over to the oven, toasted 3 sloppily cut slices of bread and walked the plate over to us, craming it into our already over packed counter space at the cash wrap. Did I mention they never gave us plates after our salads so we ate our pizza out of dirty bowls. All the while, Bruno going back and forth between his cell phone and pizza making and the owner hovering over our meal. \\n\\nThen some strange man asked to take a bunch of pictures of us with Bruno and the owner for publicity. Bruno was not happy to have to be in these pictures. My sister then, at an attempt to be nice, complimented the owner on the success of having just opened his business. He told us they've been open for 3 years! Then he turned to calculate someone's tab and literally said, \\"does $28 sound about right?\\" and the diners responded with honesty, \\"No it was much more than that?\\". This guy had to have been on drugs. \\n\\nWhen we packed up our things and paid our tab, we asked Bruno how he liked working here and he said he hated it.

Very rude, if we are going to drop over $100 for 2 people, the service needs to improve significantly.

This last time,  I was in the area and ordered carry out during lunch time.  I just got an order of pad thai, since my little kids were with me and sitting in seemed too much of a task. My toddler cant handle spicy so I ordered a regular pad thai with chili sauce on the side. When I went to pick it up after the lady told me it would be a 25 minute wait, I went in 20 minutes, the food was sitting there. The lady at the front desk was a bit short and not very friendly. She stated my total which was $8.95 , ran my card and walked off leaving the receipt on the counter to sign. ( oh and I should mention before walking off she stated your food is behind you on the counter sitting there) I thought she was going to come back to take the restaurant signed copy but she did not. \\n\\nI grabbed my food and quickly took a look at to verify. It looked ok but it was not very hot like it had been sitting there a while. When we got home the food was pretty cold by then and I live about 10 minutes away which was still not bad but when I tried it the flavor just tasted very overpowering of fish sauce. Also there was no chili sauce on the side. It was definitely not the best chicken pad thai I've had and there was a very strong bitterness about it I could not point out what. My toddler who usually loves pad thai did not like it at all, and kept complaining it tasted weird. Unfortunately this experience was not the best given the unfriendly staff, mediocre food, and forgetting the sauce on the side. Maybe their carry out is not the best choice for this place and its only worth it if you have time to sit in and dine. or since I haven't been here in over 6 months maybe the quality of food has gone down.

But we came on a late Tuesday night and was seated upstairs next to the window, which was great because it looked out on the cute streets of north end and Paul Revere's house. My wine (a chianti) was marvelous and I wish I remembered the brand and year. However, it went downhill from here. \\n\\nI started off wanting the clam pasta, which the server told me was out. That is always disappointing, and it took me a while to choose another one, which made the waiter impatient. I asked the boyfriend if I should get the salumi, which the waiter just took as my order and then rudely asked me if I had decided on an entree yet. The servers for the tables next to ours were hilarious and excellent so I think we just got a bad apple. As for the food, it was a real roller coaster. \\n\\nOur appetizers were very average. I had the salumi plate, which I couldn't help but feel like they tasted like deli meat. Even the prosciutto was not terribly flavorful. It also came with panzanella that added nothing to the meats except confusion of flavors. How do you mess up charcuterie?? I will never know but it happened. The boyfriend had the veal meatballs, which were also equally as plain and average. I don't even really remember them. The main course was significantly better for my boyfriend, who had the summer ravioli, a beautifully made ravioli filled with corn, which was so delicious that my boyfriend immediately forgave the restaurant and declared he would come back again. My pork tenderloin was also a very generous portion, although slightly overcooked. The white bean and kale that came with it was underwhelming and the kale was oversalted. My dessert was phenomenal though- a Concord grape panna cotta that had this delicious delicate flavor yet was still incredibly creamy. This was my favorite dish of the night. The boyfriend had berries and cream, which is also hard to mess up,and it was okay. \\n\\nOverall I really wanted to like this place, but the rude service and the underwhelming food actually made this a very mediocre experience. Mostly the service is what gets me because based on other negative reviews of this place on yelp, it's not an isolated incident. I'd certainly give this place another chance, perhaps on an earlier and hopefully less crowded night."},{"name":"Amaya's Taco Village","address":"5804 N Interstate 35","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I love this place, my favorite spot for crispy tacos.

The tortillas were sticking to each other, I just could not deal with the food.\\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered tacos, chorizo con huevo and huevos rancheros and those were a disaster too. His taco was so greasy, dripping with grease that he couldn't muster up to finishing it and the huevos were not cooked all the way for his huevos racheros.

It's an assortment of fatttt scallops, plump and crisp shrimp, fish fillets and other perfectly seasoned seafood, served in a basket that's made of fried taro. Another interesting dish everyone should try is Fried Milk that's served with condensed milk as a dipping sauce. It is definitely a dish that will serve three people or more.

Very pleased with my whole experience here. Met some friends here  on a Thursday night. There was a playoff NHL game on as well as a Red Sox game so we opted for a sports bar setting. Everything was great. Plenty of free on site parking. Plenty of TVs (but not sensory overload). Enough to have all the major sports events visible from just about any seat. Fairly busy which is usually a good sign. We sat at a high top in the bar area (love high tops). We were served by one of the bartenders. She was fabulous!!  Very attentive, a real professional. Drinks were well crafted from martinis to mixed drinks. Not once did any of us run dry during our stay. The food was great. All of the dinner options were very reasonably priced, steak tips were cooked to order. Everything we ordered from drinks to dinner arrived quickly and right on time. Our food was delivered by a different server which tells me the place is well managed and they understand the importance of delivering the food hot and efficiently. Great teamwork!!

Creativity that they pulled off with amazing tasting dishes. I can not say enough good things about this brunch pop up.\\n\\nWe almost didn't make it here since we had originally planned to go to Screen Door that morning. Of course they had what looked like a three hour wait before even opening. I quickly pulled up Yelp and found this spot was within walking distance. I sprinted over in fear that they would have a ridiculous line as well. They didn't! Now that I have eaten here I don't understand why this spot didn't have a three hour wait, but it worked out well for us!\\n\\nDon't be put off by the fact that the menu is pretty limited. Everything offered is done to perfection so they don't need an extensive menu. Brunch is $20 per person and you choose one drink, one savory item, and one sweet item. Drinks offered include coffee, caramel hot chocolate, tea, and several juices. Orange juice can be upgraded to a mimosa for only $3. There is only one savory option that is vegetarian, but it was a generous portion and my friend loved it. Additionally, there are some sides available like Biscuits and Fries Dusted with Ranch. A smaller menu, but everyone will find something they like.\\n\\nThe whole experience is also very personal. The menu includes the story of all of the people that started the pop up. The waitress (who also designs the coloring sheets for kids) is very friendly and warm. She made us feel very welcome and took good care of our group. It felt more like eating a breakfast friends had prepared for us than eating at a business. For me this really added to the overall experience.\\n\\nMy breakfast was Caramel Hot Chocolate (awesome), Crispy Pork Ribs (with cheesy grits, avocado, slow poached egg, and chimichurri), and Poppy Seed French Toast (with cherries and ice cream). The Pork Ribs had a great seasoning that created a great flavor and they were baked to the perfect amount of crisp. The egg was perfectly poached to create liquid gold on the grits and avocado. It was a very unique combination of foods that worked well. My French Toast had a nice crisp and the cherries and ice cream on top were very good.\\n\\nI tried my husband's Open Faced Croissant-Donut Sammy (with bacon, egg, and cheddar) and really liked it. It was a great flavor combination. The Graham Cracker waffle was very tasty and had a nice crunch from the graham crackers.  One of our friends ordered a biscuit on the side and insisted I try it. Wow. The biscuit was absolutely amazing and I'd definitely recommend getting a side of biscuits.

It was always a good time with a down-to-earth atmosphere, and we've recommended it to others based on that.  We went last night for dinner however and it was quite poor.  I would give it one star if not for the previous experience.  There was a reserved section for a party and they were busy, so the slowness of the kitchen was understandable although our server didn't warn us prior to ordering.  Two friends got burgers and I the seafood pasta based on assurance from the server that it was good (for $18 it should be).  I was surprised when the burgers came out as they were tiny; the patties not coming anywhere near the edge of the bun.  As someone else noted the fries were all nubs and pieces, and were soft and flavourless.  Neither friend was very pleased and one said his \\"sucked\\".  For a $15 burger in Vancouver it should be memorable, if not very good, however both were poor.  The seafood pasta did  have a lot of seafood, especially prawns, which were cooked well (not over done) however the sauce was too thick, bland, and cooled very quickly.  Not something I would ever order again which doesn't say much for it.  There was trivia on for the party who had reserved space so we had to deal with it even though it wasn't trivia night, and couldn't participate.

The quality is always great, the portions are plentiful, and the service is fantastic.  \\n\\nBangkok Bistro closed the doors to its original location in Coolidge Corner over a year ago.  It has been a long, painful wait, but they are finally back in our lives.  In the interim, my fiance and I explored a multitude of Thai places to get her favorite dish, and it was never the same.  I usually order drunken noodle or pad thai, and admittedly, I've also been disappointed with other Thai restaurants as far as they measure up to Bangkok Bistro.  Indeed, the months without Bangkok Bistro were dark and full of terrors.  Thankfully, our waiting is over. \\n\\nThe new space is cozy, clean, and comfortable.  They've added three large, HD televisions, but they keep them muted to not take away from the ambiance of the dining experience.

My grandmother would have walked straight into the kitchen and showed them a thing or two. \\n\\nI definitely don't recommend any of the chicken dishes-- even if you soaked the chicken in water and then saturated it with sauce, it would still be hard and tasteless.

We had the quail and ravioli and the pasta w/rabbit.  They were both phenomenal.  The appetizer was a specialty handmade mozzarella that came with varied types of tomato, olive oil, and a crostini.  Since they don't serve bread we had ONE crostini piece - which was insufficient (and confusing).  This dish needed a few more - it would have made eating it a little easier.  We ordered the bread basket afterwards (after realizing they weren't going to automatically provide one), which would have gone well with it.  Personally, I don't fee you should be charged for a small bread basket  - especially in a place like this.  That was disappointing.  I liked the wine selection and our server was spot on but not intrusive.  It was difficult to understand him due to his heavy accent - that would be my only complaint about him.  Since it was our first time visiting Vancouver we had some trouble finding the restaurant; I wish somebody (especially our concierge ) would have thought to mention it was RIGHT next to the fire station in Yaletown.  Oh well. . . . we would probably go back again.  The menu looked awesome and the specials were tough to choose from because they sounded so good.  I wish we had room for dessert, but we had to pass.  Don't be in a hurry when you come here because it takes a while to get everything.  Not an unreasonable wait time - but longer then I would have expected.

I had cased the joint online prior to my visit and thought our prospects were good.\\n\\nThough the walk in that lay-you-out-flat wind was a drag, the end result was not: Aspasia offers a lovely (if small) menu of Continentally-influenced American food, with an intimate space, unobtrusive staff and a shockingly-reasonable wine list. Any time you buy the most expensive Bordeaux available and still pay only sixty for the bottle, you know you're in good shape.\\n\\nThe food though, is really the highlight. To begin, I have a secret technique, learned from my father, for determining whether a duck confit is going to be good. Take your fork gingerly in your dominant hand, and rest it on the skin of the thigh. If it doesn't immediately pierce the skin (it shouldn't), lift the fork a centimeter or two and lightly tap the skin. If at no point the skin breaches, but in fact resounds with a light popping noise, you've got yourself a mean confit. Aspasia's passed with flying colors: the skin gleamed like a thinly sliced piece of toffee, sounding as said piece would if tapped.\\n\\nThe other dishes were equal to the confit: Joe's cauliflower bisque came with a perfectly seared diver scallop and a headily aromatic garnish of cauliflower cooked with saffron. Taylor and I ordered the Trio of Pork, getting a wonderfully braised short rib, a delightful medium-rare tenderloin and apple-wood smoked bacon, with what could be the best damned cabbage I've ever had: only the stuff I've had at Chicago's Tru is its equal, and the check for two at Tru was six hundred bucks. The bill for three at Aspasia--with three courses a-piece, a bottle of wine and a round of coffee--was two hundred. \\n\\nSo for those of you who don't live in Boston: when you visit, make sure you hit Aspasia--you will have a wonderful, low-key time, and you can always repair back to Harvard Square to shop at the Coop or drink at the Kong. For those of you lucky enough to live in or near Boston: check out Aspasia on a date, where the intimate setting and seductive food will significantly increase your chances of having a warm body to curl up next to you--early December cold or no."},{"name":"Smokehouse 21","address":"413 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"It was good but a little pricey for how much food I got Mac and cheese was bomb though. had kinda a random beer selection"},{"name":"Spoon Eastside","address":"749 Moreland Ave SE, Ste C-105","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Solid Thai food with great service, cozy atmosphere, and nice cocktail menu.

The fried okra was as delicious as I expected to be. My friend ordered the same meal but she chose to have french fries with hers. She enjoyed the meal as well. And the meal only cost us $8.51. One thing I noticed, was that when I walked into the restaurant all I smelled was the faint aroma of food cooking. And it was a good aroma. Usually when you walk into restaurants that are as old is this one, you can smell the old musty odor and old food smell from the kitchen and dining room that were not cleaned properly. I have a very sensitive sense of smell and I have walked out of a restaurant before because of the odor the greeted me at the door.

This last time, we wanted to buy a few Kumamoto oysters. Our request was met with negativity: \\"you can't buy 12 of them\\" My husband and I looked at each other quizzically - what? After a few more strange exchanges, the sales clerk finally explained that 12 of them were \\"reserved\\", adding snarkily \\"people reserve them\\" like we should know this. We only wanted two. I guess they could accomodate us then. The other thing that bothers me is that they don't use latex gloves. They just use their bare hands handling our fish. And, they don't bother labeling the package when you buy multiple breeds of oysters. They don't care whether you get to know the names, apparently. The one time my husband asked them to please label two different bags, they mixed up the oysters in the wrong bags so the exercise was futile. These folks just don't care to provide friendly helpful customer service. You are privileged to be able to buy from them. That is their attitude.

After waiting several years for them to expand further and further south, this location opened literally right down the street from my apartment. I've come here several times since they've opened, and the service and food is everything that I'd come to expect from my experience with Culver's back home. The staff is great!  They are all very friendly, and they definitely take care of their customers. Many times staff members will strike up a conversation with you while you're waiting for your food. The employees keep this place sparkling clean, and keep the good food coming.\\n\\nThe food is just as good as I remember. I've never had a bad meal at any Culver's, and this location is no exception. The food is delicious, and it's all cooked fresh to order instead of made beforehand to sit under heating lamps. While this does take a little longer than somewhere like McDonalds, it's not that much longer, usually a couple minutes tops, and is well worth it. I'd be willing to wait 10 extra minutes for better food cooked to order, however it never takes long.  The Butterburgers are all good, and I definitely recommend the Wisconsin Cheese Curds.\\n\\nCulver's is also the only place around my area, that I know of, that has TRUE Frozen Custard. Frozen Custard is very popular back home in Wisconsin, and I was surprised when I moved down here to find that there were no frozen custard places, and most people had never heard of it. There are a couple places that claim to have frozen custard, however in my experience it was soft serve ice cream or gelato. Culver's does have the TRUE Frozen Custard like you can get in The Midwest, and if you've never had it before, I urge you to try it. \\n\\nOverall if you're looking for a fast food place that has great food, definitely check out Culver's. It's hard for me to even call them a fast food place, because they are so much better than places like Burger King and especially McDonalds. The food is much better, the service is much better, and the restaurants are much cleaner.  I can honestly say that I do not have a single bad thing to say about Culver's, and that is based on my hundreds of experiences in various Culver's locations throughout Wisconsin, Illinois, and now here in Florida. I've never had a bad visit, I've never had bad food, I've never had a wrong order, and I've never felt like I wasn't receiving good service. It may cost a little bit more, and take a minute or 2 longer for the food to cook, but it is very worth it in my opinion. If you've never had Culver's before, definitely check them out.

Our other child had two pancakes which had the taste of tostitos.  All in all, our food was not awful as I said, but it was nothing special and there was absolutely nothing to bring me back.

He's Greek and wanted me to try some Baklava, which they have a huge assortment of and is DELICIOUS!  We just stopped in again last night which prompted me to write a review, realizing I haven't yet.  I've never dinned in at Athan's so I can't comment on that part but their pastries are out of this world.  Every time we stop in I always get a big box of Baklava and eight of their mousse tortes to take back home with me.  I live all the way in Fall River, so I don't have the  luxury of stopping by whenever.  So I always make sure I get enough to bring back with me.  Some of my favorite tortes are the Sarah Berndhart, Jamaica and Citron, and the tortes are not too big yet not too small.  They're the perfect size for an afternoon (or morning, night...pretty much anytime of day) delight!  They all have a Tiramisu texture to them, they're layered with mousse and cake and soaked at the bottom.  Pricing is reasonable and I think worth what you're getting.  We usually end up spending $50.00 for the Baklava and the tortes.  Also the inside is so quaint and cute!  The staff are always super friendly and very helpful.  I might be moving to Boston very soon and if I do, I will definitely be making plenty of trips to Athan's!\\n\\nIf you're around the area, it's definitely worth it to stop in and try something.  There is much more there other than just the Baklava and tortes but unfortunately I can't comment on their other products yet.  But as soon as I try some other sweets from this place I will be sure to give my opinion.  I'm pretty confident they will be just as amazing as what I've already tried.\\n\\nI really don't understand the other people on here complaining about the service.  The staff here are always welcoming and very nice.  Also I read someone's post say that the reason for the unsatisfactory service was \\"maybe it's because they're European...\\"  What does being European have to do with anything.  Very rude comment.  In my opinion Americans are the ruder of the two.  And another thing is the complaints about the way you have to order at the counter instead of getting table service if you choose to dine in.  Like I said up above, I've never dinned in here but any other bakery I have ever been to is the same way.  It's not a restaurant, it's a bakery.  You order at the counter and wait for your name to be called.  If you would like to be waited on then I suggest going to an actual restaurant and ordering dessert.

I had dinner at the relative Coolidge Corner newcomer Hops N Scotch over the summer with mixed results. More recently we found ourselves in the neighborhood on a weeknight for a few cocktails, and me not being the kind of guy who can ever refuse ordering a burger I haven't had, dove right in to what I anticipated to be an ordinary burger. It's not due to a lack of hype or accolades, but the Hops N Scotch burger just doesn't sound very exciting, especially for a place that has an interesting Southern spin on a lot of their dishes. Why no love for the burger though? I had dreams about a Pimento Cheese topped patty with fried green tomatoes and maybe some Cajun spiced fries. Some sort of twist would have been preferred, but I digress. After talking it over with our fine bartender, I was informed that I could in fact have the burger with pimento cheese, in lieu of traditional options such as cheddar or American. Pimento cheese, for the uninformed, is a Southern staple that is basically a cheese spread (usually sharp cheddar) mixed with roasted red peppers and mayonnaise.  It could be spiced further or it could be as straight-forward as that. Additional add-ons such as a fried egg and bacon are also available for $2 a pop.\\n\\nThe burger appears as normal as a burger can get, with a cone of fries on the side; there isn't much to judge based on appearance alone. But looks can be deceiving, as I quickly discover a well prepared and properly seasoned burger that is pleasurable if not mind-blowing. I was informed that they apply a spice rub on the patty itself (containing a few dry spices and mushroom powder) but that is entirely undetectable. The beef is slightly robust and beefy without hitting you over the head with a sack of suet like some other burgers are. It is simple but because it's seasoned and cooked the way it should be, it's very much a success. The pimento cheese adds a nuance of tang that is most welcome and different, and melts much better than I thought it would. A brioche bun is a minor stumbling block; it is warmed but not buttered and has an inherent sweetness that offers no benefit to the burger. It's too crumbly but overall isn't too large for the patty like brioche buns often are. The fries are perfectly salty and crispy. Again not offering anything different (a missed opportunity in my opinion) but executed the right way.\\n\\nFor $13 you get an above-average burger that is completely enjoyable if not unlike other nondescript burgers around town. Compared to other neighborhood gems such as Lineage and Washington Square Tavern (some would argue The Abbey) it's basically a less exciting burger at a very similar price point. But sometimes all you need is a well-cooked and well-seasoned burger to get you through the night. It's definitely a burger I can recommend and is completely tasty; just don't expect too much more than that."},{"name":"Mrs. Jones","address":"2255 Dorchester Ave","city":"Dorchester","stars":"4.5","text":"I picked up dinner here in the summer after having read all of the wonderful reviews.

I spent over $50 for one beef rib and a half pound of brisket.  The rib tasted exactly like the brisket so I wish I would've skipped the rib and just gotten a lot more brisket.  Unfortunately they count the weight of the rib bone into the price of the rib so I'm pretty sure I paid for at least a pound or more of bone instead of meat.  It was probably the best BBQ beef rib I've ever had but at around $40 it wasn't worth it as that's getting into a really large expensive cut of steak while ribs are supposed to be a cheap cut of meat.  Oh well the free market reigns supreme and in the crazy Austin BBQ scene this is one of the top dogs at the moment commanding long lines and they sell out of everything so they get to charge what they want for now.\\n\\nI arrived on a Saturday right before 10:00am (after giving up on the very substantial line at Franklin Barbecue) and already there were around 20 folks sitting down at the picnic tables waiting for the line to begin.  The line didn't actually form until around 10:30 and I was able to get in at around fifth in line but several of the folks in front of me actually had other people in their groups so that made my position slip back a bit.  By the time La Barbecue opened at 11:00 the line had grown to well over 100 people and kept growing.  They have FREE beer here on the weekends and the keg was tapped right at 11:00 so that made standing in line much easier.  Most folks seemed to find the beer less than good but hey FREE beer is free beer so I'm not complaining about that.  They also had live local music for the crowds entertainment so it was a nice festival atmosphere for the hordes of BBQ junkies.\\n\\nOverall the BBQ was fantastic and the brisket was well worth the price but the ribs just seemed like a total waste of money as they tasted exactly like the brisket for substantially more loot.  I polished off my rib and brisket in under 2 minutes and wanted more brisket but I wasn't getting any due to the line so I went to Rudy's later that day for another pound of extra moist.  If you've got lots of time to waste and can wake up very early the Franklin and La Barbecue are worth the experience once or twice but the legions of BBQ groupies don't make it conducive for a regular carnivore indulgence.

I sat on the second story, which was very dark (it was later in the evening) even after the waitress turned up the lights and lit the candles.\\n\\nAs for food, this is an Asian fusion place so I'm looking for more interesting dishes rather than authentic cuisines. For appetizer I had the salmon sushi panini, which is basically a spicy salmon roll wrapped in breaded rice patties. This was actually super good! I think I could just order 10 of these to eat!  For entree I ordered the Rishi burger, which is a 7oz burger patty topped with truffle mashed potatoes, bacon, a sunny side up egg, and brown Japanese curry. The burger also came with a side of truffle fries. The presentation of the meal was very nice. A big juicy burger was placed in front of me and they had to give me plastic gloves to eat the burger! However, the burger lacked flavor. All I could taste was the Japanese curry. At least the meal was filling, but definitely not worth the $14.\\n\\nOverall, I think the restaurant had some good ideas for their menu items. That's a plus since it's a fusion restaurant, but the burger I had lacked flavor and was overpriced.

It took at least 10 minutes to recieve our drinks, 30 minutes for appetizers and 45 minutes for my co-workers to get their entrees.  My food did not arrive for at least another 20 minutes.... I ordered fried rice.  When I did recieve it, the rice was soggy but I was willing to get over that until I crunched into a nut!! It was filled with them and nowhere on the menu does it describe nuts being in this dish.  When I tried to return my meal and voice my concerns to the waiter/owner (one in the same.  His name is Rick) he didn't even ask me what the problem was.  The first thing he said was, \\"you are going to have to pay for it anyways\\".  I did NOT ask him to remove it from my bill, but tried to order a new dish.  He just kept saying he had to charge me for both.  I said \\"fine, but for future reference, you might want to list on your menu that there are peanuts in this dish\\"  His response was,\\"they are cashews and there are green onions in it to, but it doesn't say that either\\".  We told him he was being rude and he said \\"You probably think I am being rude because I am right!\\"  Who says that to a customer?????  He then proceded to tell me that it clearly states on the menu that if you have a nut allergy to let your server know ahead of time... Why would I say anything about nuts, if my meal doesn't say there are nuts in it??? I just don't like them in my food, so that is why I spefically ordered my meal that clearly didn't have nuts in it according to the menu!

In this case however the service was so awful I was beyond irritated, and the food hardly compensated. \\n\\n I am not easily impressed by the fact the portions are so small they seem like they should taste delicious but no matter how many drizzles or creams you place on my plate I can not ignore the fact my food was just not good.  Perhaps it was the fact that by the time the rest of my table got their plates I had my food sitting in front of me for over ten minutes so it was dried up and rubbery (I had the stuffed calamari).  I would assume by the two mediocre pieces of Calamari that they could at least cook them so they wouldn't taste like a tire but appearance is deceiving.  \\n\\nUnfortunately our waitress also ignored us for the first about 15 minutes we were sitting, and in a place that accommodates approximately 15 tables it is hard to not notice a table of four staring around distressed.   The only way we got her attention was by asking the hostess where she was.  After we placed our drink orders she forgot half the order which was only waters all around and then when we requested waters she brought ONE!  Our meals came out separately with several minutes in between which is a huge pet peeve of mine.  The first meal that came to the table was mistakenly given to our table then removed a few minutes later for another table.   \\n\\nI will never return here because you would think $140 would fill up four people or at least be delicious but alas I left starving and annoyed with just how long we were there sitting twiddling our thumbs."},{"name":"India Pavilion","address":"17 Central Sq","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"My wife and I are regulars here and it is great.

Generally, doing so has scored me a 20% discount off the food ordered, so why not?\\n\\nTheir Vegetable Combo Thaali $14.95 comes with a choice of soup, any two Vegetable Specialties, Dal, Raita, Rice, Poori or Paratha, & a choice of Gulab Jamun or Kheer, which for me is plenty fo 2 meals!\\n\\nThe Chicken Soup ($3.95 a la carte) (chicken, fresh vegetables, lentils & tomatoes) had a bit of heat, and the tender chicken bits resembled diced chicken tikka.  The vegetable seemed to consist basically of corn kernels.  I preferred this soup over their Mulligatawny Soup.\\n\\nMy selected Vegetables Specialties (requested mild) on this visit were the Malai Kofta ($9.95) Vegetable balls cooked in delicious mild cream sauce and the Paneer Chilli Masala ($10.95) Paneer sauteed in a creamy tomato sauce with bell peppers, onions & tomatoes.  So I accidentally ended up with a heavily tomatoed meal.  If I had known that the Malai Kofta's cream sauce was a red sauce, I probably would have opted for the Saag Paneer to accompany it.\\n\\nBut still, I enjoyed both veggie selections and the dal, though I preferred the cream sauce of the two somewhat.  The vegetable balls tasted good though the balls themselves were rather soft and lacked substance.  The diced vegetables that accompanied the cheese chunks, however, were perfectly firm.\\n\\nThe twin poori arrived plump and filled with air.  The top layer was crisp, while the bottom half more malleable for folding.  It was a nice change of pace, but I think I will return to the paratha.\\n\\nFor dessert, the kheer (rice pudding) was sufficient, though it did not rate high in my experience of the sweet.\\n\\nOn this visit, their ladies room unfortunately had this awful smell.  But I mentioned it to them, so hopefully they'll deal with it.\\n\\nThought for a future visit:\\nDahi Papri appetizer $3.95 - A medley of chickpeas, tomatoes, cilantro, potatoes, homemade papri wafers, tamarind chutney & raita (served cold?)\\n\\nAddendum - in eating the leftovers, I came to realize that the Paneer Chilli Masala (thought requested mild) still had a touch of heat that had been overshadowed by that of the soup in the first go around.\\n\\n*** 6/2017 ***\\n\\nI returned for the Dahi Papri $3.95 (A medley of chickpeas, tomatoes, cilantro, potatoes, homemade papri wafers, tamarind chutney & raita; served cool).  It arrived as a good sized portion mounded on a plate, and I found it tasty with a nice light crisp texture from the light puffed crackers.  I enjoyed it very much though I felt the ratio of papri wafers to  the rest of the ingredients by volume to be perhaps a 2:1 ratio.  I wish they would adjust it to have more of the vegetables.\\n\\nFor my entree, I ordered  a mild Chicken Mango $11.95 Chicken tikka cooked with broccoli, & tomatoes in a sweet & spices mango sauce, which came with a nice heap of rice in a covered metal dish.  Beneath the orange sauce, I found perhaps 4 chunks of chicken and 3-4 small broccoli florets.  Their mild variation turned out to be a bit too spicy for me.  A small dish of yogurt was brought out to help tame the heat quite successfully even as it added a nice creamy sweetness to the meal.\\n\\nPerhaps half the meal went home with me.  Sadly for the leftovers, the papri wafers grew sodden, though the appetizer still tasted super.\\n\\n*** 11/2017 ***\\n\\nFor my dinner, I ordered the Dahl Papri $3.95 (yes, again) and the Kashmiri Sweet Pulow $8.95 (basmati made with dried fruits, nuts, raisins & honey, served with plain yogurt).\\n\\nI figured I would try to finish off the appetizer due to the papri wafers which do not hold up well to the sauce overnight, but the flavor, though tasty, was too strong and the portion too large.  It was meant for sharing for sure.\\n\\nThe rice dish was lightly sweet, and the yogurt added to the experience.  While I could see the small halved red berries and sensed what seemed to be coconut in the flavoring, I guess the nuts must have been minced so small as to be invisible.\\n\\nI hankered for the cheesecake on their dessert menu (Jaipuri Cheesecake - cheesecake draped in the colors of Jaipur, drizzled with a homemade honey ginger syrup & garnished with pomegranate preserves), but that was not to be.  Turns out, though listed on their menu, it is no longer available, at all, not just that evening.\\n\\nPerhaps a scoop or two of their ice cream?  But those, it turns out, come by the bar.  Huh?  Popsicles!  Mango, Kulfi, or Saffron?  My mango ice cream $2.50 was served upsidedown in a pretty glass footed cup.

I preordered based on recommendation from reading reviews and blogs etc., but when I came in to pick up the order, they were out of beef ribs......  I thought the whole point of pre-ordering was to have your order semi guaranteed to be there and to not have to wait in line...  So this was the only place I was planning to try beef ribs since I hear they are the best here.  So I was disappointed that it didn't work out.\\n\\nThe brisket was once again unbelievable (seems to be a theme in Austin).  The pulled pork was the best I tried in Austin, and probably the best I have ever had anywhere.  I also tried the sausage which was again, really good.  I should have written this earlier and I can't specifically remember the ribs, but I think they were also really good.  They must have been, b/c my overwhelming feeling after la barbecue is that everything was top notch.\\n\\nSo I've changed my mind and moved back up to 5 stars.  They had free beer while they cut up the meat and put together the order.  Yes, free beer.  There was a catch though.... you had to show id.  That was it......  Really?  What sort of magical place is Austin?  I wish I went to UT for undergrad.  I could actually see myself living in Austin.  Anyway back to my review.\\n\\nGreat food, free beer.\\n\\nIt is basically just a big food truck and there are picnic tables outside to sit on, so it isn't a fine dining experience, so don't go there looking for that.  There was a line (which I skipped) but there were only about 20 people in it on the day I went.\\n\\nI was disappointed and a bit miffed about the beef rib, but I guess they won a good review out of me by having delicious food, a pre-order system (that apparently is only good for skipping the line) and free beer.\\n\\nWhen I return to Austin, I will visit again.

But, the food...that's another story.  Great quality meat and knowing how to smoke that meat, makes for pretty tasty fare.  I've tried every bbq place in the Portland area and nothing compares to this  little 22 seat place.  Wish they'd open something on the East Side--they'd be slammed...maybe someplace where someone can actually find a parking spot.  But I digress...the spare ribs are sensational, as are the brussel sprouts, and the chicken is juicy and smoky and perfect.  Some may not like the vinegarery greens, but I do.

I asked for a combo plate of beef and chicken kebab and was told that only chicken and lamb were available which I was completely fine with as lamb would have been my second choice. My friend ordered the falafel sandwich. Her sandwich totaled to around $10 and mine was $14 which is definitely on the high end of what I've paid for these types of dishes so my hopes for good quality were high.

It was also served with a side salad and tzatziki sauce. I usually stay away from the pita bread and rice but as I was on vacation I was excited to finally indulge but to my disappointment there was no pita on my plate. I went up to the door to ask for some and found that it was locked, before closing time. I knocked on the door and the clerk looked displeased as he made his way over to unlock it for me. When he did I asked if pita came with the meal and he shook his head which seemed both rude and a bit ridiculous as I had paid $14 for my meal. \\n\\nI went back to eating my dinner and found that the salad had a very bitter taste to it which was a disappointment as I always look forward to the salad in my Mediterranean dishes. While there was plenty of meat, many of the pieces were too tough to cut into and lacked flavor. The tzatziki was too bland to make up for it. I ended up eating a lot of the rice to fill my hungry stomach. As for my friend's falafel sandwich, I didn't try it but she said I wasn't really missing out on the pita as hers was very thin and wasn't soft or doughy as pita usually is. I tried some of the pita and definitely agreed with her. \\n\\nAfter reading the reviews and finding most of the kebab food trucks to be closed I was really looking forward to some kebab from Arabian Nights but I must say I was led astray.

We came here on Sunday night and there were only a handful of tables occupied.  We each started with a mango lassi ($3.50), which was served in a small juice glass with ice.  I had the baingan bharta (eggplant) and it was pretty bland. The chicken tikka masala was good, but it would be odd if an Indian restaurant couldn't get that dish right. The portions were on the small side and they were served with an even smaller dish of rice.  I asked for more rice, which wasn't a problem, but I just found it to be strange since rice is so inexpensive.  I rarely say \\"I don't know,\\" but Raja is definitely in the \\"I don't know\\" category for me.  The owners were cordial and they have been open since 1980, so they're obviously doing something right.

My last experience there was really sub par. I ventured down yesterday in the pouring rain to get lunch here. I placed my order behind several other people, so I knew I was in for a wait. After waiting 20 minutes my order came out wrong. I'm usually very tolerant of error (I'm getting food, right? I'm not going to starve), but when I asked if this was my order, and if it could be corrected, the person who took my order suggested that this version would actually taste better so I should be happy they messed it up. This is the absolute worst way to handle customer service in this situation. \\n\\nAfter standing in the rain for 20 minutes for cart food my tolerance for this was really low. In the very least apologize for the error, and if you really want to make a difference, do something about it. Shyam offered to remake my dish IF I had a gluten allergy (I had ordered a stir fried rice noodle dish and received a pan fried wheat noodle dish).\\n\\nShyam, do yourself a favor and find someone else to take orders. The person you have now doesn't seem to know the menu, and may end up ruining your reputation and business.
