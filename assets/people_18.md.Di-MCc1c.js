Outside of Taiwan, the Ê≤πÊù° is hands down the best I've had - and that's from having grown up in LA.

If you're really adventurous, try the fried chitlins. They're fried with just the right amount of crisp and salted to perfection. Good appetizers to whet your appetite would include pork ear salad, seaweed salad, and the soy bean noodle salad. To finish off your meal, I highly recommend the tofu jello with light syrup.

The steak and shrimp were served with 2 tasty dipping sauces that masked any shortcomings on the quality of the meat. One was probably mayo based and the other tasted like ginger and soy.\\n\\nThe cooking show was pretty average, I think most of the time they try harder when there are kids at the table and our table was full of adults. The place was packed mostly with birthday parties, families with kids and suburbanites. The worst part of the night was that we had to wait 50 minutes to be seated after making a 7:30 reservation.

The chicken was cooked and breaded perfectly, layered with a just the right amount of cheese. The bread worked perfectly; I would have appreciated just a tad more sauce on the sandwich. Still better than any chicken parmigiana sub I've had in Central Florida within the past six or so years.\\n\\nWe decided to try the loaded fries as there's lots of love for them in reviews and, while they were tasty, the packaging for delivery retains all the moisture so that crispness we were looking forward to wasn't there. I guess people complain about too much salt, but these were under-salted. The bacon and mozzarella were nice with the potatoes, but that side of ketchup it came with could have been marinara sauce instead!\\n\\nAll in all, it was a really good experience.

These were delectable, but guac and queso fundido should always be good at any mexican restaurant worth its chops.\\n\\nOn to the mains! I had the crispy fish and the mahi mahi tacos (note that it is 1 taco per order). They were great! The crispy fish wasn't over-fried (which is always my concern). And the tacos were satisfyingly large. My compatriots were just as happy with their mains (grouper and 2 other types of taco I can't remember).\\n\\nTo drink we had their negronia tequilana (essentially a tequila negroni), their house margarita, and their strawberry basil margarita.

We were seated quickly, but that was about the only nice thing during our visit. We were judged from the get-go and it lead to a terrible night. Let me provide some context - I was in town for an event. We were definitely dressed down for dinner, and we're young, but this was still a group of professional adults who know how to behave themselves in a restaurant and frankly, I think we were great guests. \\n\\nThe first problem was splitting the check. Asked the waitress from the beginning for a split check. She flatly told us, \\"We can't do that. I mean, I can ask my manager, but we've had some issues with splitting checks to it's policy not to.\\" The manager looks at us and refuses. Okay, fine, we'll figure it out.We move on to ordering. The waitress was hardly seen. The man who had been pointed out as the manager was taking some of our drink orders - and those drinks took forever to get there. One of our people took roughly half an hour to finally see some kind of drink, and it was only a soda. Another waited about the same amount of time for a bottle of beer. \\n\\nWhile we're waiting for everything, some of us catch the waitress rolling her eyes at us. I got some dirty looks - why, I have no idea. She honestly had an air about her the entire night, and was not shy about giving us attitude. I guess it goes back to us being judged from the moment we walked in.Anyway. We get our food, despite painfully slow service.\\n\\n Fast forward to the check. I volunteered to take the responsibility of manually splitting the check among my party - something I should have NEVER had to do. That is THEIR job, and I as a customer should not have to waste my time doing it. Splitting the check with pen and paper was taking a while, so two of my friends get up to smoke - leaving their credit cards with me so I could go ahead and take care of the bill. A few seconds later (it's important to note, these moments were filled with more dirty looks from the waitress), security approaches them outside and makes sure they're coming back in. While this is going on, a police officer with a light scans over our table and stares us down. This place had treated us so badly from the beginning for a reason - and they pounced on us so quickly - they thought we were going to run out on them. Unbelievable. I pride myself on being great to my customers in my profession - and that very much includes NEVER judging them right off the bat! I finally manage to sort out our check and hand over all of the cards for everyone to pay, our group comes back, and closing up our dinner took forever (but at this point, that was no surprise.)It does get a little better (read: worse) from here.\\n\\n You see, most of the customers at Stats that night were from our event. I had one person from a table of 9 tell me that their check was split automatically, no questions asked, no problem. This once again points to them judging us from the beginning, the whole \\"no splitting checks\\" thing is obviously bull if they did it for a party larger than ours. I also heard from another group of diners that they were double charged and then told their charges couldn't be voided, and were given gift cards instead - which is illegal!I sincerely hope Stats realizes that they treated a lot of professionals very badly that evening, and word is spreading.  \\n\\nI will not be back - and I have warned everyone I saw here looking for a place to eat - don't waste your time on Stats!"},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Food is absolutely INCREDIBLE, and totally worth more than the price!

Let's put it this way, by the time we left the restaurant (pleasantly full and satisfied with our dinner), the young couple standing behind us were still in line!

One of the nicest things about this place is that everything is priced in eaches so you can easily order any combinatrion of tacos you want - as opposed to 2 or 3 of just one type.\\n\\nThe first thing I'll say is that this was way too much food. I was expecting some small measly tacos and instead found I was pretty full midway through my second taco. The second thing I'll say is that I didn't love the steak - while the flavor was good the meat itself was VERY fatty and kind of turned off me off to the whole thing. Everything else, however, was amazing. I would highly recommend both the fish and shrimp, as well as the specific tacos I ordered which were both bursting with different flavors. The rice and beans were really good as well (note: it comes drizzled in lava sauce) - perfect complement to the tacos. \\n\\nThis place is comparable to most other fast casual places in terms of price, wait, beer selection, etc. but I'd say the food is well above average and what makes this place really stand out."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Simply the best in Boston.

The \\"real\\" Salt Lick is out in Driftwood, not on 360 as I've seen on other reviews.  I was \\"dragged\\" out to this place in the middle of nowhere (back in 1990 when I first started going there, it was almost scary how long you had to drive through BFE to get there), by some college friends who were locals - I am eternally grateful.  FM 1826 - the road you take to get there off 290 - is now lined with subdivisions.  The delicious smell of smoked bbq meats starts hitting your nose about 3 miles away - euphoria for the senses.\\n\\nI actually *strongly suggest* going on a busy Friday or Saturday night.  They used to have this old hillbilly/hippie guy who played acoustic guitar barefoot while you sat outside, drank and waited for a table.  For me, that was half the fun of going to The Lick.  Oh yeah, and BYOB - Hays county is dry.\\n\\nThe food is to die for.  The bread is simple white sliced bread (like out of a grocery store loaf) but nice & moist & squishy, and good for soppin' up the sauce.  The coleslaw is good, and even the pickles are tasty.  However the REAL treat is the meat.  I personally am not a huge rib fan, but I could eat plate after plate of the sausage & brisket (I do eat the ribs too, just not as many - my husband eats only the ribs).  There is nothing not to like about this place.\\n\\nI hate that we now live so far away... just writing this post makes me want to hop a plane for a quick round trip to Austin just to stop at the Salt Lick.  Oh... there is an on-line catalog available of food that can be shipped.  Been there, done that - it doesn't do the \\"real thing\\" justice.  That being said, the bottled BBQ sauce (both regular and habanero) are great gifts, or just for grilling at home.\\n\\nI have brought tons of people to this place myself, and told everyone I know about it.  I even had one friend who was visiting Austin on business, take his clients to the Salt Lick for the first time - and they were locals!

The dinner also comes with beans, potato salad, cole slaw, and fresh bread. The meat was very inconsistent with little smoke flavor. There was a lot of the meat which is probably why they are so many 5 stars, but the quality was not there. The sausage was very good, and the sauce was also very good which salvaged the meal. The sides were bad; the beans were too salty; the potato salad had little flavor; the cole slaw was good, but also basic.

For dinner, I got the lobster rav ($16) and my bf got the frutti di mare with fra diavolo sauce ($19). The frutti di mare was decent, but the seafood didn't have much flavor and the clams (as another reviewer noted) weren't very good and tasted very fishy (minus the one star). Also, although the sauce was tasty, they may have given him the wrong sauce b/c it wasn't at ALL spicy. The ravioli, however, was the best lobster rav I've ever had. I didn't think a garlic cream sauce sounded like a good match for the dish, but I'm so glad I tried it. I could have licked the plate! My bf wished he would have ordered that as well. \\nThe bill was only $52 which is very affordable considering we were in the city, both had alcohol, and ordered an app. Overall, I'm so glad we went and I'd def go back soon if I didn't have to fight for parking!"},{"name":"Reds Backyard Barbeque","address":"2-58 Hazelton-Etna Rd Southwestm","city":"Pataskala","stars":"3.5","text":"We are always game for trying new restaurants and supporting local business'.

Jane orders the fried rice with a bowl of egg drop soup. We get the soup a few minutes later and its in a huge bowl with enough soup for 4-5 people! The fried rice was definitely delicious, not a soggy greasy mess like some Chinese places serve.\\n\\nI attempt to order the Chinese sty;e pork belly (bacon) with jalapeno, curious because I've never known bacon or jalapeno to part of Chinese cuisine. Amy Ma informs me they were out of bacon that night. I then asked what kind of fish the various \\"fish\\" dishes featured. She did not answer my question, but asked if I liked spicy food (very much thank you :) and quickly recommended the sliced fish in hot oil. \\n\\nRemembering reading about it in a yelp review I decided to go with that.

This moderately spicy dosa is served with curry potatoes, a fragrant sambhar with large pieces of potatoes and eggplant, and a coconut cilantro chutney whose freshness rounded out the dish nicely.

This is a town of many worthy falafel but this ranks right up there with the very best I've ever had...perfect crunchy exterior, tender and flavorful innards. \\n2.) The vegetarian \\"fiesta\\" platter had a whole array of excellent offerings including my new favorite hummus as well as an incredibly fresh and flavorful mosaka that had our resident vegan moaning in yummy ecstasy the entire time he was eating it.  \\n3.) The two meat specials were spectacular: Succulent, perfectly cooked lamb grilled and then sauteed with spinach and mushrooms and a creamy wine sauce, and an amazingly tasty version of kibbeh with tender spiced minced beef and garlic in a crunchy bulgar wrapping and a creamy sauce that was so good I wanted to bathe in it.\\n4.) DESSERT!

When I asked him what the national liquor of Lebanon was, he told me it was araq, which he couldn't get here because of the arcane Oregon liquor laws, but that it was really similar to Sambuca, which he then brought us on the house.  (Oh yeah- they have a full bar, too. Woot!)\\n\\nMy only caveat here is that 7 people ordering at the same time meant that the one cook in the kitchen was a bit overloaded, so the pace was... \\"leisurely.\\"  It wasn't excessive at all, and we weren't in a hurry, but this is, perhaps, not a place to go if you're someone who prefers an expedient experience.

You could taste the richness of the flavors of each ingredient, and the bread was perfectly crisp without being too crunchy.

Our waitress was attentive and cheerful, without hovering or being remotely annoying. She didn't rush us at all, but she was there when we needed her.\\n- Great selection of desserts. I wasn't thrilled with the fritters (aka churros) mainly because they were very fried (i.e. crunchy) with a kind of doughy interior. I prefer mine light and flaky like funnel cake/fried dough.

Not so delicious was the catfish entree...I know it's the chef's specialty (at least that's what I was told) but it was served on top of the oiliest/greasiest collard greens ever!

Thats just cool and a different concept specifically if you are hosting a small group.\\n\\nc)  Another note about the deck upstairs, they have these like mini fireplaces (thats the best i can describe them isnt it a shame?), but basically a group of you can go up on a colder atlanta evening and sit around your own mini fireplace over cocktails...thats hot!\\n\\nd)  Parking is validated, so you can park in the building across the street, and its a good look.\\n\\nWhat I dont like about Stats:\\n\\na)  They have one of the most confusing menus that I have ever seen.  Honestly, they try to make the menu look like a sports page, and my dumb azz couldnt find the food, and thought I was reading the damn sports page.  Cool effect, but I think a lot of ppl are confused by the dumb azz menu.\\n\\nb)  The food is average at best.  Have had the burger, a salad and nachos at this spot, and they all were nothing to get excited over.\\n\\nc) The nachos:  I like the concept, give em a pile of all the b.s.t hat you can throw on their, and try to make our \\"own spin\\" on the nachos by putting actual chicken wings in the damn nachos...and now we have made a name for ourselves by having the biggest, sloppiest, stupidest nachos in the city of Atlanta.

The food came in a decent amount of time, but the noodle soup came with a surprisingly large amount of noodles but almost little to no soup. When we asked the waiter if she could add some more soup in it, she took it almost before I finished, seeming as if others have asked the same thing before. She took my bowl, and went to a vat right in front of the kitchen where she ladled more soup into the bowl. Do they use the same soup for all their soups? That in itself seemed dubious. The food wasn't much better. The soup was almost tasteless, the fish balls a little too fishy, and the noodles smelt weird and tasted equally as weird. As for the shrimp dimsum, the wrapping was extremely doughy and the shrimp seemed equally as mushy.

Even though it was busy, he was always stopping by to check on us. He took our drink order and got us some appetizers. They came out pretty quickly. Then we ordered our food based on his recommendation. It was like a combination plate with brisket, sausage, and ribs. Then it came with beans, cole slaw and potato salad. He gave us a few different pieces of brisket to because you can get it different ways (like more fat or less). I loved everything.

(sorry). The meat itself, though bathed in liquid, wasn't tender and fall-apart done, but rather a bit stringy and didn't have the complex, beefy taste I like. I suspect they trimmed off too much of the fat or simply didn't slow-cook it long enough. Also, I like it when it's served with a few pieces of sliced french bread on the side, but this is a minor quibble.\\n- Though the appetizer of Name (pronounced \\"nya-meh,\\" the n taking a tilde) was delicious,  my enjoyment of it was cut short by my main entree arriving after I'd barely taken one bite of my appetizer. I really hate that, and it was all the more galling since everyone around me got their appetizer and entree in well-timed succession, not all at once. grrrr (Incidentally this appetizer is like little fried hashbrown cakes or Jewish latkes, but are in fact made from the white yam that often goes into Africa fufu along with cassava, or yuca.)\\n\\nPambiche's food is not bad, mind you, but it didn't leave me much desire to return.

However, whenever I travel to a different part of the country that specializes in its own style of regional BBQ, I make a point to check it out if at all possible.  So while on a weekend vacation to the Texas Hill Country, we asked around for the best BBQ restaurant in town, and we were consistently directed to the Salt Lick.\\n\\nWhen they say that everything is bigger in Texas, they truly mean it when it comes to this place.  Holy crap, it's enormous!  We went on a chillier evening, so we were forced to sit inside, which was nothing special in my opinion.  The outside, however, was nicely manicured and seemed like it would be an amazing place to sit and hang out on a nice day.  I also found it interesting that this place is BYOB, although they have a small \\"liquor store\\" on the premises where you can purchase a beer or bottle of local wine.\\n\\nLooking through the menu, I wasn't sure what to get, so I decided to order a sampler platter at the recommendation of our server.  The portions were huge as promised, but the food just didn't do much for me - nothing compared to the BBQ I'm used to back home in Kansas City.  The brisket was just ok, and the pork ribs were decent as well.  The best meat I was served was the sausage (which is not something that I typically order at a BBQ joint), so that was a pleasant surprise.  My biggest disappointment were the sides that came with my meal.  Potato salad was pretty good, but the beans were lousy and the cole slaw was some of the worst I've ever had.  Lastly, and maybe just because I prefer Kansas City BBQ, I was disappointed by the lack of sauce on all the meats.  They did have additional sauces available on the table, but they weren't all that good either so I decided against smothering my meats in the sauce as I would have typically done at other places.\\n\\nI admit, this review could very well just be a matter of personal preference, but if this a true reflection of Texas BBQ, I'm glad I live in Kansas City."},{"name":"Austin's Pizza Guadalupe","address":"2324 Guadalupe","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Gross.

However, it doesn't end just there - there is a wide away of French, Belgian and North African/Middle Eastern influenced food.  \\n\\nBut let's start with the mussels - they are excellent.  Since they are one of the marquee items for the restaurant, of course they need to be perfectly cooked, which they are.  With a large group of diners, I was able to try two versions, the Coquotte and Vin Blanc.  The latter was a perfectly executed version of the most common preparation of mussels, whereas Coquette added in some wonderfully smokey bacon lardons which brought another dimension to the tender shallots. \\n\\nFor my main course, I had \\"Tajine d'aziz √† l'agneau\\" - a braised lamb shank with honey, figs, cinnamon & cilantro, served with cous cous and zalouk.  When the waiter removed the tagine top, the aroma of the cinnamon and cilantro quickly wafted up.  This is a very unique, exciting dish with a falling-off-the-bone lamb shank surrounded by a richly seasons broth, topped with a large piece of bok choy.  \\n\\nAgain, thanks to the large dining party I was with, we got two of the chef's tasting dessert plates.

Quite a varied experience here, averaged out to a 3/5 rating, but the price raised expectations, and lowered the rating.\\n\\nWe got there really early, 5:00 or so, no wait for a table.  But here's an interesting start to the dinner... the floors were so slick my wife had to make her way very carefully to our booth.  I didn't find them as slippery, but they were very slick.  Throughout the night we noticed other patrons - and even some of the waitstaff - walking carefully.  Grease?  Wax?  Very unusual.\\n\\nOur server was friendly, helpful.  He gets a 4/5, ok.\\n\\nThe glasses he brought out for water were all dirty/spotted.  Hard to tell why, but to the point where it was distracting.  We asked for new glassware, and the gent (not our server) who brought new glasses only replaced 2 of the three glasses.  I guess he figured that the one our server had filled before we complained was ok.  Anyway he never asked.  We also noticed that much of the silverware was also very spotted.  But didn't want to say anything more at that point.\\n\\nFood: I had a delicious Mule cocktail.  Ordered the ceviche and found it too complex.  \\"Chilled bay scallops, marinated shrimp, fish, fresh pineapple, coconut, cilantro and guacamole, seasoned crisps for dipping.\\"  Sound good, but they fail to mention the heavy spicing in the ceviche sauce.  The great thing about this dish is how fresh the seafood is supposed to be.  But the heavy-handed spice (which I swear included cumin) just hid any flavor from the seafood.  Add the \\"seasoned crisps\\" and it wasn't what I expected.\\n\\nIronically, I was warned about the lobster roll I ordered because it wasn't \\"traditional.\\"  The server explained that is was made with wasabi and rice wine vinegar.  It sounded good, but when it finally came, I could barely taste the wasabi or vinegar at all.   The cole slaw accompaniment was good, very tangy.\\n\\nWe also got a burger: 2/5, dry, meh.

He heard that the Craigie burger was the best in town and 2. I was feeling under the weather and he's convinced that fatty burgers cure sickness (Is this what they teach in med school?) We arrived at 5:30. I thought that my husband was being consider and planned this so I could go to bed earlier, but now that I've read through some reviews, I've learned that it must have been because there are a limited number of burgers served a day. The actual number of burgers Craigie limits itself to seems to be somewhat of a mystery since various reviewers are throwing out different numbers (18, 20, 25?). The point is, it's limited and in high demand.\\n\\nThe burger came out and I immediately knew I would have trouble holding it. It wasn't wide, but it was pretty tall. When I tried holding up the burger, the patty started sliding out of the buns because the juice from the patty made it slippery. Then, the bun started falling apart because it was soaked in juices too. When I was finally able to bite in, the meat looked on the rare side even though we asked for medium rare. There was a puddle of oil and blood forming on my plate so I had to place a piece of bread on top of it to soak it all up so I wouldn't have to look at it. I, along with my plate, was a total mess. It was one of those tricky situations where I couldn't place my burger down because I would cause a bigger mess, but then I really wanted to put the burger down so I could grab a napkin so I could wipe my grease-covered hands on something.\\n\\nTo sum it up, the burger itself was good, but a little too fatty for me. I've had better at a couple of places in SF and even within Boston, I think the burger at Radius (now closed) was a better fit for me. The potatoes wedges were great and the red vinegar pickles were amazing.

The first time I went was around lunchtime and I walked in, waited to be seated like the sign told me to do, and finally gave up and approached one of the two servers chatting behind the bar, who waved vaguely and told me to just sit wherever, and seemed almost annoyed at me for interrupting (their chat did not seem to be work-related).\\n\\nThe second time I went we had three different people waiting our table -- and no one managed to fill up my water or my husband's coffee, even though it seemed like the rest of the staff were mostly standing around talking to each other, including our actual server.

Service is usually pretty good, the beer list is much better than it used to be (and much better than a lot of sports bars), the prices are decent, and I just had the big poppi burger which was a hungry meat lover's dream.  The place is packed with flat screens everywhere you look, so there aren't really any bad seats in the house.  They have a big movie screen that drops down in the back for the big game too, which is pretty cool.  My one gripe for the game watching experience is the sound.  Sometimes it's not on, and other times it's just not up to par.  You can miss a lot of what's going on if you can't hear it.  There are usually a couple beer specials to take advantage of, and it seems like there are always reps for various breweries and liquor companies lingering around willing to give out samples.  On my last trip my group got free bottles of black star beer to try, plus an additional bucket of 6 bottles for $10 afterward.

The staff was very nice but there was only one waiter for the whole place-someone didn't show up to work!!!  The manager was very friendly, but it seemed like the restaurant got away from him.

Then, my main dish was to die for. I got the stuffed mofongo with shrimp in garlic sauce. I can't even describe how rich and perfect the sauce was, how big the shrimp were, and how incredible it all tasted when paired with the plantain mix in the cup. It was so much food, and I managed to stuff most of it in my belly because I couldn't handle wasting it.

We took notice of everyone else's pizza and it was clear this place doesn't bake their pizzas consistently.  Folks sitting next to us had completely burned crust on top (ours was only charred on the bottom), while another couple had a pizza that looked perfect.

We normally visit sushi happy hours around the area for sake and sushi specials, but I was craving hibachi, so we went in late afternoon. \\n\\nWe stood in the entrance (all food is ordered up front and then brought to your table) for quite awhile as we both like to really get to know a menu, and several staff members asked if we needed help and/or offered to guide us through the menu.  We didn't feel rushed however, they took orders from people flooding in behind us, they just recognized new guests to the place and wanted to help out - very friendly service without being intrusive.\\n\\nWe ended up deciding on some sushi rolls and my boyfriend ordered the lunch special (just about to end) which came with soup; when I ordered my side of hibachi veggies the hostess/cashier offered me the lunch special of veggie hibachi, which had more veggies and came with soup as well - definitely great for the price and such a helpful suggestion!\\n\\nWe sat at a table and our carafe of sake practically followed on our footsteps to meet us there.  The soup came out fast and was SO FRIGGIN GOOD.  The hibachi veggies with white sauce were exactly what I wanted, and enough for us both to share.  \\n\\nThey let me design my own sushi rolls since I despise avocados and they seem to be in a lot of sushi rolls everywhere you go - I had tempura shrimp, eel and cream cheese with eel sauce, which the staff sent out as a side cup, which was thoughtful because I mentioned I wanted a decent amount.  My boyfriends spicy tuna (?) roll was very good as well - he said the tuna was very fresh and of good quality, but could have been more spicy.  \\n\\nThe dining room attendants were attentive, and quick to clear our used plates but didn't hover or really even interrupt our conversation - which we both really liked.  We made sure to re-tip our attendant and sushi chefs as we left.\\n\\nOverall - a great place for fresh casual sushi and hibachi without an overwhelming menu.  Friendly staff, expert service, total thumbs up to this place!\\n\\nQuick side note on why they received only 4 stars - the bathroom didn't lock completely (single stall) and someone almost walked in on me.

We wanted a nice sit-down place for brunch to catch up that was kid-friendly, but not necessarily kid-oriented (so no Rainforest Cafe or T-rex).  Raglan Road in Disney Springs fit the bill nicely.  The place is gloriously huge, beautifully outfitted to look like an old-fashioned, old country bar.  Disney is really good with the ersatz ambience scaled up for the masses.  Had a delicious Blood Mary with Ketel One and bacon dust, \\"The Cure,\\"  they called it.  Decent amount of vodka (which I would expect for a $15 cocktail).  We made a reservation at 10 am through OpenTable.  Weirdly, while I was sitting outside the restaurant waiting for the doors to open, the restaurant cancelled my reservation.  I called, they said they hadn't (but clearly, my OpenTable app had notified me that they had).  It wasn't a problem since no one was really there are 10 am anyway.  By the time we left, though around noon, the place was filling up.  I'd keep an eye on your reservation if you're going at a more popular time.  Service was friendly and efficient.  We did have little ones, so there was a little extra work on the waitstaff's part (dropped silverware, lids for cups, spills on tables, etc.), but they seemed either good with it or resigned that this is a part of your life if you work at a Disney location.\\n\\nThe brunch dishes were upscale and modernized versions of popular Irish dishes.  The gratis bread service is brown Irish soda bread, crusted with rolled oats.  It was traditionally not sweet, very dense, addictive with their little dipping dish of olive oil, white sugar, and (we think we heard) Guinness vinegar. We got a side of the classic slices of Black and White Pudding.  We started with the Dalkey Duo, battered and deep-fried cocktail sausages with a mild whole-grain mustard sauce.  They're so not good for you, but delicious, nicely spiced, plump mini-sausages, kind of can't go wrong.  The \\"Irish Egg\\" (a take on the Scotch egg) was surprisingly a poached egg covered in sausge, rolled in breadcrumbs and deep-fried.  I don't think they told us that on the menu (and they really should, for the immunocompromised persons).  We were OK with it, and ate it all, it was a very good mix of creamy, salty, and little tartness and crunch from the pickled cabbage garnish.  I had the \\"Pork Hash Tagged\\" (\\nbraised pork belly, scallions and potato hash topped with two fried eggs).  Perfect for brunch, was crispy cubes of diced pork belly and potatoes, charred scallions, a little smokey, well-fried crusty bits all around, and some good over-easy eggs (so the runny yolks can sauce up the plate).  The \\"Salmon Prone to Waffling\\" looked like a behemoth.  We were surprised that the smoked salmon wrapping the grilled salmon filet was also cooked, we were hoping for a nice rosy, cold-smoked or raw cured slice salmon (like gravlax or lox).  The consumer of the Dubliner Mac 'n' Cheese stayed that the dish could be \\"cheesier\\" when we asked her worldly (for a 5 year old) opinion.

Every Tuesday, Rocco's offers their Taco Tuesday specials which include $14.99 all you can eat tacos, $5 Margaritas and their $15 pitcher of margaritas. A pitcher will get you around 6 margaritas and at $9 a piece on a regular night, this special is a steal.\\n \\nThe menu offers not only tacos, but an assortment of appetizers as well. Be sure to try the Mexican Esquites- which is mexican street style corn on the cob topped with cojita cheese and cilantro;  you'll be wishing you ordered two. Another appetizer that you cannot miss is the table side guacamole. They no longer offer the half portion, but no fear, you will find yourself eating the whole thing as it is made to order at the spiciness you prefer.\\n\\nIf tacos are your specialty, they have specials every night that are not offered on the menu. But be sure to try the chorizo and the carne asada tacos as they are guaranteed to fill your stomach and leave you wanting more.\\n\\nOn some special nights, like the restaurant's anniversary or the ever popular Cinco de Mayo, you'll find the man and the legend himself, Rocco Mangel, on the bar sporting his even more popular white disco shoes pouring shots of tequila for everyone in the restaurant. (Granted, if you are doing a tequila shot contest, he WILL make sure you have a designated driver and/or take your keys.

We washed it down with coffee (decent) and Diet Coke (what was I thinking?).  The food was spectacular.  I can't even say whether I preferred the sweet stuff or the savory.  It was all just ridiculously delicious.\\n\\nWe actually dug into the sweet stuff first, since we got it right when we ordered and we couldn't bear to just look at it for more than a few seconds.  The long awaited sticky bun did not disappoint.  It had delightful texture, and the toasted pecan and dark caramel goop was insane.  I do think the insides could have been fluffier, and I'll bet the bun would have been even better if we'd gotten it warm.  As for the banana bread - oh sweet Jesus the banana bread!  It topped the sticky bun with an incredible moist crumb studded through with nice chunks of gooey baked banana and crunchy bits of walnut.  It was the kind of pastry that could disappear by the loaf from a single family kitchen - not too sweet and sneak-a-slice-at-midnight delicious.  We saved some of both pastries to eat as dessert, and they lost none of their appeal.\\n\\nBut the savory stuff was at least as impressive.  I love a good sandwich, and Flour is two for two.  The BLT with applewood-smoked bacon was a stellar classic with great crispy salty bacon and some lovely tomato.  The winner, though, was the grilled portobello melt.  I suspect that some of the edge came from the grilled bread, which is, by the way, an option for any sandwich for a small price.  The bread was fantastic, crusty with a presence that the regular bread of the BLT was lacking.  I suspect, though, that the portobello melt also had more flavor.  With fresh mozzarella, juicy roasted tomatoes, and some of the most vibrant basil pesto I've ever had, this sandwich burst with every bite.  The mushroom, of course, was the key ingredient, and it had the perfect resistant texture and earthy blast of flavor.\\n\\nNew paragraph now for the best quiche I have ever had and it's not even close.  Even as I ate, I could not believe how exquisite it was.  Nothing unusual as far as ingredients go, just tomato, onion, bacon, ham, and pepperjack cheese, but it was perfectly done.  The crust was just thick enough, just hard enough, and the egg was creamy and fluffy in a way that I wish I knew how to replicate.  All the extras worked together, and the pepperjack gave the whole thing an ideal amount of heat.  The quiche came with a lightly dressed salad, which contributed a subtle acidity.  I cannot believe I felt this strongly for a quiche.\\n\\nMuch of our lunch conversation revolved around how amazing the food was, and at such a good price.  That heavenly quiche was $5.50, that brick of banana bread an easy $2.25.  If I lived in Boston, I would make Flour Bakery + Caf√© a regular stop and marvel every time."},{"name":"Pio Pio Restaurant","address":"5803 Precision Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food, very gracious and attentive staff, family oriented atmosphere.

It's Restaurant Week in Boston so she could have picked just about any great restaurant in the Boston area.\\n\\nOnce seated, we noticed \\"Happy Birthday\\" confetti was spread all over the table. The Restaurant Week menu was value priced at $33.12 for a three course dinner with a choice of four different bottled wines at the same great price of $33.12.\\n\\nOur wait person was Ben and he approached the table acknowledging there was a birthday girl at the table. So far, so good. Then Ben asked us whether we would be ordering off of the regular dinner menu or off of the Restaurant Week menu. We answered we would be ordering off the Restaurant Week menu and everything went down hill fast from that point on. I don't know about you guys, but I absolutely despise it when a wait person prejudges you as a poor tipper because you order off of a value priced restaurant menu which we never asked the restaurant to create for us in the first place.\\n\\nThe highlight of the evening was the meal itself... Ruth's Chris is consistently great no matter what city you choose to dine at. Boston is no exception. The Lobster Bisque, Filet Mignon and side dishes were prepared perfectly and the quality was nothing short of superb.\\n\\nThe low lights of the evening included Ben, who did a great job of ignoring our entire table for the two and a half hours we were there, the wait person who bolted from the men's room toilet stall without washing his hands (which is enough to make you lose your appetite mid-meal), The empty water glasses around the table that were never refilled and of course, Ben bringing the check to me before our dessert dishes were ever cleared from the table and without asking anyone at the table if they cared for an after dinner cocktail or perhaps a cup of coffee?\\n\\nThe other highlight of this disappointing dinner service experience was my conversation with Brian who is the General Manager of the restaurant. Brian seemed genuinely concerned about our dining experience, he took the time to listen to what I had to say and he rectified the problem immediately to my satisfaction (in fact he exceeded my expectations). Brian seemed to understand the fact that his product is of high quality and that the human aspect of the dining experience can very easily make or break how customers feel about the restaurant brand and whether they will return against not, refer a friend or choose to eat at Morton's, Smith & Wollensky or some other premium steak house in this city.\\n\\nMy message to Ben... Quit prejudging your customers because you don't know what type of gratuity they may leave you based on what they order, how they look or how they are dressed.

I wish that I had just gotten myself one whole bowl of that. \\n\\nDessert: dessert was fine, we got a chocolate torta and brown butter panna cotta. It was all tasty, and luckily it was on the house because they made a mistake with our reservation and we had to wait to be seated.\\n\\nWhile some of the pizza was a bit disappointing, I had some really delicious things on the menu.

I've been going here frequently since they opened and it's been thrilling to see how they've grown, adding additional concepts nearby creating Atlanta's first truly authentic Little Italy.\\n\\nWhat's happened at Antico Pizza is phenomenal. They have introduced to us the traditional Italian experience of ordering a pizza and eating it anywhere that you can manage to elbow into a free spot.  It's not a new concept, but like anything that comes along at the right time in Westside Atlanta it's become a highly desirable experience of social interaction among people whose immediate concern is to get this freakin' amazing hot pizza in my mouth as soon as possible while enjoying the effect of everyone else around me doing the same. \\n\\nIt's addictive... this bond that that you feel as you fold your slice, take a bite, have a blissful moment, refocus your eyes, and then look around to see that everyone in the place is experiencing the same eyes-roll-back-your-head good pizza moment. \\n\\nThe blissful crowd consists primarily of people in their 20s and 30s, as well as people who are older but still feel 20s and 30s-ish. The rest are fun to watch as you read their discomfort of being in a strange new place. What's this? What do I do? Where's the Ma√Ætre d'? They're easy to spot, so you offer to give them the run-down while you wait in line with them to place your orders. Once the how-to is received, some are ready to go like like they just picked up a secret navigation strategy. For others, and you can tell it in their eyes, there's just no hope, although I've tried.

For the $36 you pay, they definitely give you your worth of lobster. The quality was really great, and the ratio with the butter was amazing. Great with the bread too. I wish I did add a tiny bit of salt to bring out the taste of the lobster though. But overall amazing. Tip:  substitute the chips for 242 FRENCH FRIES!!!!!!! (thick kinds). They were so amazing - the best french fries I had in a while. \\n\\n-Oysters - wow. For someone from the West Coast, it's really quite a treat to try oysters from the East Coast. They just tasted a lot sweeter, but also gamier. I just feel that oysters on the East Coast seem to have more character in general compared to the West Coast ones. We ordered a dozen, and they were well worth the $2.50 each.\\n\\n-Calamari - how Calamari is supposed to taste. Loved the seasoning on it - well salted with lots of flavor. Also slightly on the spicy side too, from the pepper. Great with the aioli sauce too! Good crunch, not overcooked at all. My pet peeve is rubbery calamari. \\n\\n-Clam chowder - really awesome clam chowder. I wouldn't say it's the BEST I ever had, but it was definitely pretty good and satisfying. it's more of the chunky style. What I liked about theirs particularly was the salty chip they added into the soup.

So, naturally, when I finally moved to Austin, it was high on my list of places to visit. It's a little out of the way, so you may have to plan the trip, but its location speaks to the experience - it feels like you're headed out to a family retreat in the highlands of Texas, without actually having to \\"rough it.\\" \\n\\nThe waits can be long, commonly pushing 45-minutes or longer, and you won't get seated until your entire party arrives. A few of us were running late, but gambling paid off, and only two in the party had to live through the wait. Waiting isn't all bad though, due to The Salt Lick's BYOB policy. You can sit out in the garden with a cooler full of your favorite beer or wine and strike up a conversation with the other waiting parties. \\n\\nIf the wait doesn't suit you, and you're feeling a little rebellious, you have the option of heading over to the take-out window and ordering right away. When your food comes out, you can grab a seat outside and enjoy one of the regular live music acts that performs on the outdoor stage. With your own drinks, and a few friends, this could easily become the best picnic you've ever been a part of.\\n\\nThe seating inside is fairly communal (hope you made friends outside), and unless you have a larger-than-average party, you're like to sit at the same table with people you've never met.\\n\\nThe menu is simple: meat, and how much do you want. They offer a \\"family style\\" dinner for $20 per person which includes all-you-can-eat portions of your favorite three meats (you can choose from sausage, beef brisket, pork ribs or turkey) and a couple of sides. The real deal, though is buying by the pound. We fed three people for just about $35 and still had leftovers to take home. \\n\\nIt doesn't take long for your food to come out (they're constantly cooking and just slice off portions as orders come in), so even if the wait outside was long, you know as soon as you sit down that you're only a few short minutes away from sweet, delicious, authentic Texas barbecue. \\n\\nThe real draw to any barbecue place is the sauce, and The Salt Lick is no different. It comes in two flavors, regular and spicy habanero. At the risk of losing all of my credibility and the respect of the greater yelp community, I offer the following statement:\\n\\nI, Spin, would willingly be drowned in The Salt Lick's spicy habanero barbecue sauce, if doing so would solidify its reputation as the single greatest sauce ever conceived of by humankind, and ensure that future generations know and understand the impact with which sauces can affect our lives, social relationships, and general state of contentedness. \\n\\nAll-in-all, The Salt Lick lived up to and even surpassed my incredibly hyped-up expectations.

This is one of those cases. \\n\\nI was on a business trip to Boston this weekend and saw that this place had a ton of positive ratings so decided to check it out with a friend. My family runs Italian restaurants, so I have a VERY keen eye for what should and should not be on the menu, type of service and etc. I was really excited to try Boston Italian as I have never had it, and really wanted an awesome experience.... I didn't get this here. \\n\\nLet's start with the menu choices:\\n\\nMost of the selection is very basic dishes, heavy Boston influence, and heavy on the seafood. After once glance at the menu, and looking at what people were eating at the tiny tables I didn't think I was going to be in for anything amazing. \\n\\n\\nCustomer Service: \\n\\nThe sad part is after waiting for 2 hours to eat, we were talked to rudely... shoved out of the way when we were trying to come in to order and told to get out. We placed our order to go, as we needed to get to an important business meeting as waiting in line had taken too much time. We were informed the place was cash only ( would help to have this posted on the door for people not from Boston) and went to get cash. \\n\\nMy friend and I decided to just to try another restaurant as this seemed like a massive hassle, and the food didn't look/smell worth it. SO GLAD we ended up trying another location as we had a MUCH better experience at La Famiglia Giorgio's which is around the corner. They were friendly, the veal was AMAZING as it was cooked perfectly and the selection of sauces, pastas and fresh food was just to die for. \\n\\nSorry Boston Giacomo's seems to be all show and no go, not worth it."},{"name":"Escobar Restaurant and Tapas","address":"327 Peters St SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"A ghetto fabulous attempt to create a bougie experience that I can go without in my lifetime. Drinks are overpriced due to the menu, fancily, describing a special drink selection. i.e Rum and coke $12. Witnessed the bartender mix up a drink, pour it in a tall glass in which it didn't fill and proceed to add ice until it appeared to be a full glass. Ladies restroom is messy. Paper towels everywhere. Toilet seat is loose. Fancy faucet connected to the wrong type of sink bowl. Don't turn the water on too much or water everywhere. Hookah server inconsiderate of our request to order hookah. We have to tell the bartender we want to order hookah. Hookah server sends over hookah with bartender. No menu of flavors or even price. We had no option(s). Just \\"take it or leave it\\". Hookah server came  by apprx 30 minutes later. No hello/hi. However, just request for payment. Another bartender who seemed to be working our side of bar never greeted us but gave us 1 drink menu and sent another bartender apprx 25 min later to take our order. No sorry for the wait etc. The first bartender then went on to dance in a video posted to Instagram flaunting and counting one dollar bills. Just know my dollars did not go into making that video. However, do know gratuity is auto charged. In my head some locations do this bcz they know their service is sub par so they find a way to get those tips without earning them. \\n\\nI want to add by saying this. I looked into the owner(s) Instagram and the fact that expensive clothes, shoes etc are displayed does not mean you can run a business depicting that lifestyle. 2Chains and his business associates had the right idea.

More likely than not, we'll be visiting there again before we head home.  Last night my husband enjoyed a humongous hamburger and I had the \\"Jax Special\\" Pizza.  Tonight we split an order of hot wings and a cajun chicken pita pizza.  The wings were HOT, but not so hot we couldn't enjoy them- they were pretty much perfect, as was everything else we ate.  The selection of beer was the best we've seen in this area of Florida, and if they for some strange reason don't have what you want on tap, they most likely do have it bottled- with something like 200 types of beer, total.

US was like my second home when I lived in Orlando - typically visiting at least once a week with my Premier pass. After experiencing Hollywood's version, it was easy to say that Orlando still takes the cake for this one. \\n\\n   The Rides: There are so many classics, and a great range of thrill seeking and family-friendly rides. There's only one roller coaster, the Rip Ride Rock It, and it is my absolute favorite here. You get to choose the music it plays before you ride, and it takes a video of you the entire time (I can assure you that this is absolutely hilarious afterwords.) I love how themed they are also, and how they can truly give you a feel that you are experiencing the classic Universal films within the ride. \\n\\n   The Food: Pretty general park-type greasy food from pizza to burgers, nothing really too special. There are, however, a lot of choices between quick stops and sit down restaurants. Being a huge fan of the Simpson's, my favorite is Krusty Burger, where you can choose from so many options that they mimick from the show. \\n\\n  The resort holds two parks: Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios, and I HIGHLY recommend you visit both, as each have a great amount of entertainment to offer. At Islands of Adventure, you have the world famous Wizarding World of Harry Potter (You have to go whether you like it or not,) Marvel City, Jurassic Park, etc. Studios will bring their movies to life with Despicable me, E.T, Men in Black, and many more classics.\\n\\n   A few other notes: I love the locker options for the rides. They allow you to use a locker for free for about an hour while you ride nearby rides. If you come in the summer, it is typical that the lines are going to be pretty long. If you come in the fall/winter/spring, you can get through the lines fairly quick, especially on weekdays. Aside from the parks, the CityWalk is gorgeous and offers wonderful restaurants like Margaritaville, Hard Rock Cafe, and many more. If you ever visit in October, you HAVE to go to Horror Nights. Hands down the best Halloween experience I've had.\\n\\n  Universal Studios will always be on my list, and every time I leave, I'm always anticipating the next time I return."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Me and my girlfriend drove down here from the DFW area.

Attentive and genuinely friendly, which I was happy to find to be a common trait everywhere I went in Austin.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the food definitely did not live up to the hype.

I've never been to the bar but I like the way it looks.\\n\\nI usually get the Steak Salad which is hearty and full of fresh greens. For an entree you have to get steak... I mean it's a steak house after all! I loved the filet mignon. It was cooked to perfection and came out on a sizzling plate smoldered in butter. Very tasty. The sides we ordered were family style. The mashed potatoes and asparagus were delicious. For dessert I've had the chocolate torte and the creme brulee with berries. Both were delicious and on par with any other fancy restaurant in Boston.

How could you not?? The beautiful artwork, the amazing chandeliers... it's beautiful.  As the night progressed, LAH went from 5 stars to 2.  Let me tell you why:\\n\\nThere's no opportunity to really appreciate the artwork around the restaurant because that would mean that you would have to disturb someone's dining experience.  How awkward is that?  \\"Excuse me, can I interrupt your conversation to tell you to move your head because I can't see that piece of art?\\"  I was not comfortable doing that, so my friends and I just sat by the bar and enjoyed our cocktails.\\nThe food..... so ridiculously overpriced for the quality AND quantity of food.  Two men next to me ordered the scallops entree & you could smell a disturbing fishy smell from a distance.  They took one bite & returned it to the kitchen; completely dissuaded me from ordering any entrees.  If anything, order the yucca fries and the flatbread pizza, but they're both not filling whatsoever.  \\nOnce it hit 9PM, there were so many people standing near the bar that I was getting shoved left and right.  There were people reaching over my head to grab beers, spilling drinks on me.... just not what I expected from a \\"high-end\\" place.

A friend told me about Barcelona, so I made a reservation for dinner before seeing a play tonight.\\n\\nWe made reservations for 6:15 and were promptly greeted and seated by the hostess upon our arrival.  Our server, William, quickly came to our table and made a cursory attempt to explain the wines.  The wine menu is overwhelming.  We finally chose a wine and William told us that we had made a good choice.  I would tell you what it was, but I can't remember.  It was a chardonnay though.\\n\\nWe ordered the mushrooms, beets, calamari, redfish and corn salad tapas. When William asked us if we enjoyed our tapas, I told him that we loved everything but the mushrooms.  They were way too vinegary and had too much tarragon.  Neither of us liked them.  He asked if we would like something else to replace them and we told him \\"No.\\"  Shortly after, a Prince Harry lookalike delivered some beef empanadas on the house.

While William was taking our order, he accidentally knocked over the tiny amount of wine left in my boyfriend's glass, which hit the candle on the table and caused was to go everywhere.  William immediately ordered another glass of chardonnay, but my boyfriend asked for coffee and ice cream instead.  We were given a token for a free tapa.

Thought the crab cakes were over salted even paired with the local organic grilled vegetables and salad. Chicken pesto pita was much better choice- an oily but tender chicken with salad, set on fluffy pita bread. I felt the food was a little overpriced for its taste- perhaps the quality and ingredients are what qualified it for its 15$ sandwiches and 18$ crab cakes etc. I'm giving this place a 3.5 out of 5 stars. \\n\\nWhat we got: \\nJumbo Crab Cakes: it was two generous 2-3 inch thick cakes and it was definitely mostly crab! Some places put more stuffing and fluff than the crabs itself, so it should be cake crab, but this is definitely a crab cake. However, it was definitely salty. I remembered putting it in my mouth and then the salt hitting me to where I had to quickly put down some grilled vegetables to somehow alleviate the sodium burden I had ingested. The flavor was probably very good, but I felt the salt overpowered the original flavor. The grilled vegetables I will give credit for being colorful and super varied. There were zucchinis, onions, tomatoes, carrots, and made the dish popping and colorful. I appreciated that it was local and grilled and tried to balance the crab cakes. They offer a sandwich out of the crab cakes, and again, my rule is that if it comes in a sandwich and you order it without the bread, it's a good way to test and see if it needs bread to mask an otherwise too powerful or salty taste. In this case, we went breadless and it was salty enough to bring half of it home to use for toppings on a rice dish later. I give this dish a 3/5. \\n\\nPesto Chicken Pita Wrap- I definitely thought this was a better choice than the Jumbo Crab Cakes. The pita bread was good - didn't have a cardboard too stiff kind of feel that I think pita bread can have at certain places. The chicken was very tender and the pesto definitely made it more succulent. It came with spring mix which balanced an otherwise super oily rolled up pita well. I definitely recommend this wrap over the jumbo crab cakes if someone had to get a dish here. The flavor here was a more soothing and simpler flavor. \\n\\nI wished that the food came in china plates and actual silverware since it's a sustainable and organic place- it came in plastic boxes which is fine, because they tried to have recycling and trash but I saw many customers disregard the signs and tossed indiscriminately so I think it may be better to go the dine in route better if that is a choice."},{"name":"New India Cuisine","address":"2304 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Really good service and we enjoyed the food.

He always waits too long to make a reservation for my birthday, and with this restaurant's popularity, location, and it being the worst month of the year (graduations, weddings, showers, etc) it was very kind of them to squeeze in such a large group at a nearly decent hour (9 pm). So, kudos for being accommodating and understanding the panicked husband. I believe they did make him complete a contract for such a large group, so fair warning.\\n\\nThey are located right on the waterfront (hence the name). Decor is modern, with lots of windows, very appealing for me. They also had a $10 valet, which was the same price as any other parking in the area, so it's well worth it to use that service. We were able to enjoy drinks outside while we waited for our very large group to finish arriving, and for our table to be ready. The sangria was absolutely perfect! They do have a lounge area where a bachelorette party had congregated. It was a little warm in there but it was VERY busy (lounge and restaurant) so we were happy to be outside in the fresh air.\\n\\nInside we were seated at a very nice, longer table near the back where we had privacy, and nice real estate (not near the kitchen, the entrance the bathroom, etc). It has the trademark TV's on the walls playing movies, sports, etc but nicely enough we were seated far enough away that our group could converse without the distraction.\\n\\nOur group had latecomers and we used the time to review the menu. I've been to the Strega in the North End and the menu at the waterfront has some similarities, but also modifications to make it a little more upscale. Everyone ordered, we all selected a variety off different meals and loved every bite. Not a single person out of 14 had an issue with their meal. And of course, the bread and olives beforehand helped tide us over (yummy!). \\n\\nThey were also kind enough to accommodate a guest bringing an outside dessert to celebrate the special occasion, so thank you again! Overall the waitstaff was very attentive, pleasant and knowledgeable. Drinks were always being replaced and out food came very quickly. We also never felt rushed, despite the fact that we were there close to 2 hours. \\n\\nThey do add on an automatic tip with large groups, so beware. And it looks like they have a policy of not splitting large bills between several cards, so I would check in on that before bringing a large group. \\n\\nEnjoyed every minute of our experience there and we will definitely be back! Great job to the manager and his staff for helping to make a very nice, memorable evening that all of us enjoyed!

Ruth's Chris did exactly that. I ordered the Steak House Salad, NY Strip with creamed spinach, and Warm Bread Pudding with Whiskey Sauce. The New York Strip was cooked perfectly at medium rare on a sizzling, buttered-up plate that kept the steak hot and buttery the entire time. The steak was succulent, tender, juicy, delicious, and orgasmic. One of the tastiest piece of cow I've ever had. The steak house salad and creamed spinach was decent, nothing to rave about. The warm bread pudding was soft, and had just the right flavors.\\n\\nThe service was impeccable as expected.

I would recommend if you're a veggiesaurus to just come here for drinks, but the beer is a bit more expensive here than most other bars in the neighborhood so that seems kind of silly.  \\n\\nAlso, I certainly don't mind getting carded (seriously people, you're in a college town, just keep it on you all the time and take it as a compliment), but one friend of mine almost wasn't allowed entry because of her military ID, something that should be accepted most anywhere.

Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu: food, drinks and dessert.  \\n\\nWe started off with the seared ahi tuna and sizzlin blue crab cakes.  The ahi tuni was dee-lish!!

Crunch, taste, all the meat - perfecto! \\n\\nFor dinner I had the bone in fillet.  Woooo was it sooo good! Most fillets are so small I can take 4 bites and it was gone.  But this one here...big, juicy and dang... all the rich beef flavor just partying in my mouth.  Very tender too, no muscle strings just pure goodness of medium rare meat.  I also accompanied my steak with blue crab stuffed shrimp which was damn good too.  \\n\\nFor a drink I ordered the \\"new fashioned\\".  I was surprised how good it was considering rye & whiskey are my taste bud's worst enemy.  It was full bodied, rich with some fruit flavor.

Although, I do remember we also had a plate of asparagus which was really good until it sat too long on the 500 degrees plate (all of our dishes came out in 500 degrees sizzling plates). And the bread that they gave us? Holly molly goodness!  It was warm, hard on the outside, soft and sweet on the inside.  The best bread ever!  \\n\\nWe also ordered a bottle of Norton Malbec wine which paired very well with all of our dinner.  \\n\\nThis place is really super duper good top to bottom.

This time we came in on a Friday, so there was a dude checking IDs at the top of the stairs, a packed patio, and the bar looked pretty crowded. My boyfriend and I were able to find 2 seats at the bar though, and were attended to quickly by the bar tenders. Afraid a single hotdog wasn't going to be filling enough for him, my boyfriend and I decided to order the special appetizer of the day - chicken tenders. Due to our difference in taste (I love buffalo sauce, he prefers BBQ) we asked if half could be tossed in one sauce, half in the other. The bartender suggested having all three options of sauces (BBQ, buffalo, honey mustard) all on the side to dip - sold! This time my man ordered the Boston Strangler and I went for the Belgian (cuz, who doesn't love garlic mayo?). Again, this place did not disappoint!\\n\\nI read a few reviews about the slow service.

My best friend even taught me the secret technique of eating it with the right amount of butter, syrup, and got sauce (it's a dying art that must be kept alive). \\n\\nI digress, I came across this restaurant using my handy dandy Yelp app after searching Chicken and Waffles. \\n\\nThe service: I walked in and there where only two other people in the restaurant.

I could tell who the person was that was supposed to be my server and she definitely seemed like she didn't want to wait on me. My rule is typically 10 minutes. If I haven't been acknowledged in 10 minutes, then I politely leave and never return. Right at the 9 minute mark as I started to gather my things, the server (who I guessed correctly) came over and took my order. I order the sweet tea and chicken and waffles. \\n\\nThe food: the chicken and waffles was everything I never knew I needed. The chicken was fried to perfection. You could tell they seasoned the chicken AND the flour they fried them in (which isn't done more often than you would think). The waffle was definitely in my top 3 of best ones I have EVER had. It wasn't your typical batter. They definitely put a little sumthin extra in it. It almost has a malted flavor with something else. As a pastry chef, I can identify what the flavors are but out of respect, I don't want to give away their secrets. But those waffles are worth the visit alone. The sweet tea was pretty good too.

You're looking at a late 20's through 30's crowd where no one's vomiting drunk and there aren't crying pubescent girls like downtown college crowds.\\n*Those are the only pro's....\\n\\nCon's: The food. I wrote professional food reviews for years and I can only imagine what they'd look like for this place. My grilled ham and cheese was burnt to a crisp, the salmon taco tasted like regurgitated seafood, the eggs were raw (clear, raw eggs) in the bennies, and the biscuits from the biscuits and gravy were so hard I wiped one off and banged it on the table (it didn't break). Almost everything else I've had either had hair in it or tasted like it came pre-frozen and over deep-fried. It's been super disappointing to have a place great food options that are cooked so poorly. Soooooo, my suggestion would be, eat brunch somewhere else and come here after for drinks.\\n\\nSecond, WATCH. YOUR. TAB. And if you work here, and you're reading this, SO MANY people are commenting on this issue and I'm nothing short of shocked that it hasn't been fixed yet. \\n\\nMy friends and I have all had the same issue here; drinks are added to our tab all the time that we didn't order. I know I didn't order Deep Eddy because I'm allergic to it (people can be allergic to certain impurities found in very specific brands). And I've never once ordered whiskey because it tastes like warm cat urine smells to me. So those weren't mine. I didn't say anything when it happened the first couple times because I honestly didn't notice. I can drink, well, so it's not unusual for me to have a decent tab. It wasn't until a close friend said he was noticing this issue that I started to pay attention. Once, my friend and I tested this and both opened tabs on arrival, ordered our separate drinks on our separate tabs, and what happened a couple hours later when we close was amazing. His bill was $0 and for some reason, every single drink he ordered was on mine. Simeon double-checked (but had not been the one we'd been ordering from, he's always very nice) and reported that while my friend had a tab open, both of our orders had been put solely on my tab. When confronting a manager, Jessica, we were told, and I quote, \\"Well maybe the bartenders are just comfortable with you guys....\\". What?!?! What does that mean?? It's ok to pad my tab then?? Or just to plain not pay attention when we order? When my friend confronted her about the same issue, she told us she watched the camera of us drinking for several hours on a Sunday (she watched several hours worth of drinks in a little bit over one hour, somehow....) and she accounted for us ordering what was on his tab with the exception of the whiskey. She admitted we didn't order that and it was an erroneous charge. So, management knows it happens, and she made a pathetic attempt at an apology, offered my friend exactly $9, and walked off. She was rude, unprofessional, and seemed to lack not only accountability, but any sense of management skills. \\n\\nMoral: When you drink here, seriously, write down everything you order and dispute the receipt of its incorrect before you leave. \\n\\nSummary: 90% of the food we ordered is either burnt, over-fried, or just gross. Always check your tab for accuracy. And if you do come here, eat somewhere else first then come upstairs where the bartending staff is energetic and the people are friendly. Look for Sam downstairs, or Eric, Jenny, or Sunny upstairs. They'll make sure your day drinks are quick and ice cold!\\n\\n*But still watch your tab (and seriously, there are multiple reviews about this very issue)...."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"When I told my mom we were going to go to a restaurant where it was customary to wait an hour for a table  out in the cold and they turned over tables within 45 minutes, she said \\"not with me.\\" But we were traveling without her :(.

The meal comes with 3 huge chicken wings. (We took two in a to-go box.) The service was very nice and personal.  It is such a cute little place with lots  of character.

But, the service this past Friday at this location exceeded our expectations. Giovanni, a server in the front area of the restaurant was so attentive and all around great that I felt compelled to look for his name to write this review. He brought drinks before we were totally out, and when he didn't know a beer question, went and inquired after I ordered something else. He went above and beyond! We've also found The Ambassador Bridge Pizza, that was once just a monthly special, now a menu staple and it is by far the most delicious combination. Sausage and Pepperonis with a healthy spread of the red sauce and dollops of their flavorful, homemade Ricotta. We also add jalapenos to this pizza, because I like it spicy.

The parking lot is all dirt as well as some of the waiting areas outside the restaurant. These aren't negative things, but observations that should be examined before going. For example, you wouldn't want to wear white shoes when you go (or white shirts for that matter!). Why all the fuss? Because the BBQ is DELICIOUS. It is often referred to as the \\"best BBQ in Texas\\" and I find this to be true, but like religion and politics, BBQ is a private matter best left to your own judgement.\\n\\nThe Salt Lick offers two modes for the adventuring diner: all you and eat and by-the-plate like any other BBQ place you can think of. I always dine with my girlfriend or with a buddy, so in my reviews I always write about the price for a couple. I feel like this is indicative of how most people eat out. That said, you can eat comfortably for two around 25 dollars here (excluding dessert). Plates of sliced or chopped beef sandwiches run around 10 dollars or 11 dollars if you want beans, slaw, and potato salad with it. Rib plates vary in increments starting at reasonable rates. They get you with the sodas though, it costs around $2.15 for a Dr. Pepper here, so you're better off bringing your own beer.\\n\\nThe all you can eat plate for $17.99 is perfect for someone who has starved themselves for the past 3 months or those with insatiable appetites. This is a stupid, huge, wasteful, amazing, joyous buffet of everything the Salt Lick has to offer. You get ribs, brisket, bread, beans, potato salad, cole slaw, and probably around 5 other things I forgot. Jesus, I'm getting hungry just thinking about this meal.\\n\\nThe staff are usually pleasant and friendly, and sometimes the din of people dining can make it hard to hear, but they certainly won't get any medals for being the best. One of the few times I had an issue with something, I got the impression that they just didn't care. It's hard to knock this business for getting the cold shoulder twice in 10 years, but I know that good help is hard to find and it certainly won't hurt their rating here.\\n\\nYou need to go. Don't go on a weekend. GO HUNGRY and enjoy."},{"name":"Pizza Caboose","address":"3276 NW 185th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I went in there on Saturday night for the dinner buffet.

We'd previously stopped by for dessert and drinks and had a decent experience, so we were hoping to be impressed since the location is so convenient for us.  Sadly this was not the case\\n\\nWe walked in at 11:50am and the male host told us the wait would be about 10 minutes.  No problem at all; I told him my name for the list and he didn't write it down.  I thought it was odd and asked him if he wanted to write down my name, but he told me he had it in his head.  Guess he's just super good at hosting?  No matter, we grabbed our drinks from the bar from the very friendly and prompt bartender, then went back to sit near the host stand so we wouldn't miss hearing our name.  \\n\\nAfter 30 minutes of watching table after table walk in and be seated almost immediately, we checked in with the other host since the original wasn't there anymore.  She checked the computer and said it would just be a few more minutes until I was called.  Clearly this was a lie, since my name was never entered into the computer or any any list for that matter, other than the very efficient one in the first host's head.  \\n\\nAfter the 40 minute mark ticked by, we were bizarrely still the only people hanging around the host stand, so we decided to leave.  As we walked out, the original host quite lamely said \\"Sorry about the wait, people just aren't leaving.\\"  Say what now?  Did he think we hadn't been watching table after table leave and couple after couple be seated before us for the past 40 minutes?  In essence, we stopped by Aquitaine to spend money at their bar (which after all this they didn't even offer to comp...), waste 40 minutes, be lied to and forgotten about twice, and leave.  Really unfortunate experience, and sad because I was hoping find a go-to brunch place close by.

I loved how you can take as much garlic, chilli pepper and parmesan cheese as you want without having to ask the waiter to bring it for you.  I don't think this is a pizza place where you can come with a large group of people because its hard to find a place to sit. However, if you are 2 or 3 people then it's much easier to find a good seat. As soon as people finish eating their pizza you have to take their seat because you don't know if there is going to be another seat available when your pizza comes out.  I ordered the margarita pizza but my crust was burned , and some of the slices were a little soggy but it didn't taste bad at all. Coming from New York I expected this place to be a lot better, but I have tried other pizza places in Atlanta and this place is the best pizza place in Atlanta. If you go there on a Monday night anywhere from 6pm to 7:30 there will not be a huge line and you will get your food in less than 15 minutes.

Hmm, it better be worth the drive. \\n\\nThis vacation also included a trip to San Antonio,so he suggested we drive to Salt Lick on the way back. Well, my mouth is watering in anticipation.

You can see all the meats: brisket, ribs, chicken, etc. The smell was intoxicating. I couldn't wait to be seated. We took a quick look at the menu but we already knew we wanted the family style all-u-can eat brisket, sausage and ribs. This trinity was also served with potato salad, cole slaw, beans, pickles & onions and Texas-size bread. \\n\\nThe meat is the star of the show. Don't get me wrong about the sides. They were all very delicious. Tasted homemade. You can even make your own sandwiches, but you don't want to fill your belly with the sides. The brisket was moist and flavorful & smoky. The sausage had just the right amount of spice and good balance between meat and fat. The pork ribs were fall-off- the-bone and finger-lickin' good with enough sauce to coat and not mask the natural flavors of the meat itself.\\n\\nWhen all was said and done, we were satisfied.

Row 34 is the finalist from the Boston Globe's Munch Madness this year. After I browsed the reviews here and checked out their website, it seems to be a good candidate. \\n\\nI showed up around 9:45pm after my event. They sat me down immediately at the bar. The hostess was very helpful and courteous. She reminded me that the kitchen is closing soon so I should put my order in quickly. I ordered 3 oysters (Howland's Landing, Pleasant Bay, and Katama Bay) for appetizer, and roasted striped bass with grits, mustard greens, and bacon for main dish. \\n\\nPros: The oysters were fantastic. Fresh and clean taste so that I can really enjoy the flavors. The striped bass was cooked perfectly and good serving size. The decoration and the layout of the restaurant are arranged beautifully and very comfortable.   \\n\\nCons: The service was disappointed. The waitress at the bar was very slow of bringing me the menu. It was not that busy when I arrived. She did smile when she approached me. She didn't greet me at all and just dropped the menu. I also had to try to get her attention again to have the missing menu for the oysters. I then got a glass of beer which is supposed to be given to the person who sat next to me. That's where I asked for a drink for myself. Since, I was reminded by the hostess to place my order soon, I tried to follow the instructions. The waitress was taking her time processing some completed orders at the cashier machine, one at a time. I noticed that the hostess was looking at me and looking back to the waitress, and wonder what the waitress was doing. So, I finally put my order in through her. I then got my drink and said thanks - the waitress didn't even look at me and responded. I kept reminding myself - at least she was smiling. Now I had time to look around. I noticed 1) the wait staff didn't look happy at all. Sitting at the corner of the bar, I got to see the wait staff picking up dishes. No one had a smile. It seems like they didn't want to be there. A minor thing: my chair had a piece of a broken metal back. I kept hitting it but I decided to let it go. 2) A small group of people sitting next to me at the bar were not happy about their orders didn't arrive together. Especially, the servers (different than the waitress) didn't know who was getting what. A friend at my event happened to walk in and decided to sat next to me for a drink. He got a beer and paid it by cash. Then he realized that he never got the changes back. The beer is about 7 dollars and he gave a $10 for the check. He would just left the rest as the tip. He was not thrilled about the waitress assuming the tip. Back to the food: although the bass was cooked perfectly, the grits tasted under cooked. The mustard green was a bit saggy. It just made the fish look bad... \\n\\nOverall, I am disappointed. With the money I paid (still with 20% tip), I expected better taste for food and better service. I probably will try the winner of the Munch Madness, Eastern Standard to see if it is better. As a whole, I gave a 2-start rating since it means \\"Meh.

Wait, there isn't a problem with using French to describe Italian food, is there? To be honest though, the pasta was very forgettable. The chicken and peppers with onions in marinara was too watery for me, and the chicken taste and texture felt like it might have been frozen.

All that time, I thought the restaurant was a random low-scale (up-scale wanna be) place. Little did I know that it was actually a quite famous upscale place.\\n\\nCheck out my girlfriend's blog. She has some really nice pictures of what we had!\\nhttp://beanosbeantown.blogspot.com/2013/12/new-orleans-and-craigie-on-main.html\\n\\nI heard from a few friends that the place is actually quite nice and especiall the bar was pretty nice. I went there a few days ago with my girlfriend to check out their bar. We went around 10pm, well after we had dinner. The place was still pretty packed both with pople having dinner as well as grabbing drinks. As soon as you walk in, you can see their \\"open kitchen\\" and see all the chefs working busily, which I especially liked. Everybody from the host, waiters/waitresses, bar tenders were very nice and welcoming.\\n\\nWe had to wait a bit for the bar. There were only about 10 seats or so at the bar and it is first-come-first-serve. My girlfriend had a cocktail called sunrise something... and it was probably the most delicious cocktail I have ever tried. I had a somewhat dirty martini and it was excellent as well. We also tried their $18 cheese platter... but I didn't like it too much. 3 not so large slices of cheese and they were ok. Nothing special.\\n\\nWe heard so so much about their famous burgers from friends. (Presumably the best burger in Boston if not in the whole U.S.) We were so curious that we returned the next day to try their burger and bone marrow.\\n\\nKey is to come for an early dinner. They open at 5:30PM on Saturdays so we went right around 5:20 and waitied. The door was actually locked and we were the first in line. Within a few minutes, people started lining up. They all looked like they were coming for the burger.\\n\\nOnce we got in and took a seat the bar we ordered a burger with a fried egg and bacon. Price = $19 + $3 (egg) + $3 (bacon). Bone marrow ($10) had 3 pieces of oven roasted (?) with salt and pepper + maybe some spices.\\n\\nTo be honest... the burger was just ok. It was definitely rich. Not too big in size, but a bit tall. But it feels like it lacks.... something. It doesn't taste that special. Some might not agree, but I actually would prefer shake shack or in-n-out or one of those burgers over Craigie on Main. The bone marrows were pretty good. Pretty good portion actually for $10. Very rich but I guess that's bone marrow.\\n\\nOverall... The ambience is good. Some cocktails are quite good. Burger is just ok.\\n\\nI will update if I save enough money to try their regular dinner menu. Hopefully the 8 course tasing? :)"},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Every time I'm there, I always say, \\"Wow, I should make it out here more often!

For an appetizer, I highly recommend the escargot, which takes a few minutes to prepare, but is worth the wait. My two favorites is anything they do with swordfish and the scallops. The scallops are consistently perfectly done, while the swordfish is as well, as long you specify that you want it medium or moist. Otherwise, I have found that the swordfish can get dried out and really loses a lot of it's flavor.

It's actually a very big place at the end of the Walmart plaza in Dunwoody. It was a back and forth for me between the Belgian Waffles Bananas Foster style and the Pancakes. The waffle won and I'm so glad it did. It was fluffy and great, the bacon was big strip and 4 strips not the traditional 3. The server was more about getting the order right, and being quick than being personable which made it kind of hard when it came to trying to get her attention about extra condiments and silverware, but the food came out right so I can appreciate it."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Looking for a great Irish pub and entertaining place to go while vacationing at Disney?

It's not really prawns it's tiny shrimp.  \\n\\nThey do have a good selection of Irish beer though.  The nice aspect of this place is that they have great entertainment.

The plate was $10.95 + tax + $2.00 delivery... Fair enough. I tipped the driver $3.00. The meal was SO small I was appalled... No rice (which was OK) and filled with a ton of green peppers, cabbage, stalks & celery. There were no mushrooms, chestnuts and barely any peapods (what i think of as Chinese veggies). There was minimal protein and the shrimp were SO tiny I almost couldn't stab them with a fork to eat. The sauce was so bland and thin with NO flavor. I ate the meat, as the beef and chicken were OK, and dumped the rest. This was the worst $16 I have ever spent... and definitely didn't satisfy my craving for chinese.\\n\\nI realize I should have known this would be trash but I have paid far less for way more food and satisfying veggies. \\n\\nThey didn't even include a fortune cookie!\\n\\nDO NOT go here."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"My wife and I had lunch at the Atlanta Breakfast club.

I should have opted for the chocolate chip. \\n\\nFinally, the reason this place gets 5 stars is the egg sandwich. I adore egg sandwiches because I can sneak protein into a carb-cheese fest. They make their egg sandwiches on great bread with EGG SOUFLE! Seriously, they class it up even further with a thick slice of tomato, some greens, and this amazing mustard sauce. The rest of the sandwiches are pricey ($7-9 is what I saw) but the egg sandwich is only around $5. Plus, if they cut it in half, you can attempt to save half. They do reheat well but I usually just devore it.\\n\\nI don't love their beverages but I have only had an ice tea because things are pretty pricey here. \\n\\nThe parking is terrible and there aren't a lot of options.

In addition, the bread service they provide with the guinness glaze in it is excellent.

There were a number of large groups so they squeezed the 6 of us into a table for 4. We asked if they would be able to accommodate us and serve us or we were prepared to go somewhere else happily. They insisted. It took about 20 minutes to get water at the table. Then it took about an hour and a half to get our food. Meanwhile other tables were getting their food before us even though they arrived/were seated after us. At no point did the waitress apologize. Nor did they offer anything for the situation. When everyone's food finally arrived,  mine did not. They simply forgot it. The eventually brought me something when everyone else had already finished eating and I am fairly sure it wasn't what I had ordered. They then forced us to pay an 18% gratuity.

The food lived up to the hype. We had the #4 which was rotisserie chicken, rice and beans as well as the fried yucca and a couple of empanadas. The chicken was terrific. Tender, and falling off the bone.  If I was just reviewing the food, I would give 4 or 5 stars.\\n\\nThe service though was something else entirely.  When we walked in, we were greeted immediately and shown to a table. This was a late lunch and just after 3pm, there was one other table there, just finishing their meal. Aside from this, they were empty.  We spent several minutes looking at the menu and figuring out what we wanted. After deciding we put down our menus and waited, and then waited some more. Aside from seating us, no one had been by to check on us or to see what we wanted to drink. This was more than 10mins after we'd sat down. This was despite there being 4 people at the bar area looking at something on the counter, chatting with each other, or on their cell phones.  All the while, they had taken plates away from the other table, brought them coffee, and their check but completely ignored us. My wife even began staring at them hoping someone would make eye contact and finally come over. Still nothing. I finally turned around in my chair and did the  same. Still no change. After several minutes of this I got annoyed and tired and decided we were going to leave. When they saw us getting up to go, that's when someone finally came over and asked asked if they could get us something.  Being annoyed that they took so long and no apology I said I didn't know as no one had been by, checked on us, offered USBA drink so I didn't know. The response I got? \\"Well I'm here now. What can I get you to drink\\". Seriously? That's how you respond? I was a server and trained servers for 5 years, and work in handling upset customers.  After this I felt annoyed, disrespected, and not like a valued customer. As we were both tired, I just decided to let it slide and order.

If I am not willing to take the chance I order a beer.\\n\\nThe chips & salsa:  In the past the chips have reminded me of stale Tostitos.  The salsa somewhat makes up for the chips, but I often decided it wasn't worth the calories to indulge.  HOWEVER, the past couple of times we have visited they used a different kind of chip, and while still somewhat generic, they are better than the ones before.\\n\\nThe food:  Stick with the enchiladas and you will be fine.  I vary between the bean and cheese enchilada and the carne adovada enchilada with both the red and green sauce.  Both my husband think the chili sauce they use is pretty authentic to New Mexico.\\n\\nThe beans and rice are only fillers, not much to write home about.  Again, I usually skip the sides and save room for the sopapillas.\\n\\nWhile the sopapillas might not be as good as I have had in Santa Fe, they fit the bill here in Portland!  We usually end up getting a couple of orders.\\n\\nThe service:  Good if they know who you are, bad if they don't.   There is usually only one server on the floor (the owner) and he does not get in hurry.  Don't give him an impatient look, it will only delay his approach!

The dishes ranged from a simple dish of charred shishito peppers with thickly chopped bacon to the more adventurous sea urchin creme brulee, but everything was incredibly delicious and fresh-tasting.  The standout dish was an albacore carpaccio, which featured the most tender fish I've ever tasted...definitely try it!\\n\\nThough the food was amazing, the service at Bamboo was what impressed me the most.  Small touches--the hostess taking our drink order during our 10 minute wait, the sushi chef noticing that we were waiting for our server and taking our order--made us feel very welcomed, and we appreciated the opportunity to sit at the sushi bar to watch our food being prepared up close.

I always imagined my first (and probably only) experience at Craigie would be for the infamous burger. Luckily, my favorite dining partner enjoys tastings as much as I do, so this first time at CoM was a special one.\\n\\nThe restaurant feels far homier and rustic than I expected. I loved the immediate view of the kitchen upon entering. As soon as you walk in the plating line is right in your face -- you can hear and see the chefs squabble, rush, and improvise in plain site. It's pretty awesome.\\n\\nI was a little disappointed that our table was far from the kitchen, but because of it I was able to concentrate on the two most important things: the food and my date. \\n\\nMy new plan of action for tasting menus is to avoid filling up on drinks. I spent a long time perusing the cocktail menu to make sure I picked the best one, as it was the only one I planned to drink throughout the evening. I ended up with the Old Cuban: Barbancourt 15 year rum, lime, mint, sugar, angostura, sparkling wine. It was perfect.\\n\\nDespite the 5-star rating, I have one tiny complaint with Craigie. Throughout the evening I kept wishing I had brought a pen and pad with me to take notes on the food. We noticed about halfway through that all of the other tables around us were offered a pen and paper to take notes during their meal. I'm sure it was just an oversite, but I really do wish we had been able to take notes without have to take out our phones!  I'll do my best to recount our fabulous meal from memory but I'm sure I'm missing tons of important and unique ingredients/preparations. You'll just have to go see for yourself! \\n\\nAlmost immediately after letting our waitress know we'd be doing the 8-course tasting, we were delivered a big basket of bread and an amuse bouche highlighting salmon and mango. After, that the courses started to roll in:\\n\\n1. Raw course: fluke with apricot and creme fresh\\n2. Foie gras and rabbit rillette with mushrooms and toasty sourdough bread\\n3. Black rockfish with oysters and mushrooms\\n4. House made whole wheat noodles topped with a soft boiled egg, provolone cheese and mushrooms\\n5. Sweetbreads with crispy onions and turnip\\n6. Venison with brussels sprouts\\n7. Basil seeds and sorbet\\n- \\"shot\\" of a yummy frozen yogurt treat\\n8. Two desserts to share: chocolate panna cotta with avocado and banana cream and ice cream, and I have no clue what the other dessert was, but it was delicious!\\n- banana bread truffles with the bill\\n\\nI really loved that each course featured seasonal, local food and while presented beautifully, still had a rustic feel to it. Take a bite, close your eyes, and you could be in some New England cabin eating the deer your uncle just shot outside. Really! You could just tell this food was truly farm to table.\\n\\nCourse #4 (pasta) was definitely my favorite of the evening. Seriously, if I could eat that for dinner every day for the next ten years I'd be one happy camper. The venison, rockfish, fluke and panna cotta were all at the top of the list as well. The sweetbreads were my least favorite, but that's just because I don't like sweetbreads.\\n\\nService from start to finish was great. Our water glasses were always full, and I think we heard from just about everyone who worked in the restaurant -- each course was presented by a different person!\\n\\nCraigie is an obvious high recommendation to anyone who enjoys the tasting menu experience.

I experienced more flavors in one meal than I can even remember. Highlights were the fried pig's tails, bone marrow, and the fruit galette for dessert. The presentation is nothing short of art, and the care Chef Maws takes in each component shows why he has won so many prestigious awards. I also tried a few signature drinks that were amazing in their own right and fit the overall feel of the menu. \\n\\nAnother thing that is superb about this place is that he sources all of his ingredients from local, organic farms, and he posts those farms right on the menu so you know where your food is coming from.

I have been trying to go to Cragie on Main since it was Cragie St. Bistro.  Unfortunately it is not the type of place that (apparently) you can just go to dine without reservations.  I bit the bullet and made reservations a week prior for my wife and I and another couple equally appreciative of world-class cuisine.  Cragie on Main requires a credit card to hold reservations, $25 per person if you cancel prior to 24 hours in advance if they are unable to fill your table - based on the number of people the on a Saturday, losing any money due to a late cancel doesn't really seem feasible.  \\n\\nWe arrived just prior to our 9:00 PM reservations; our table was not yet available, so we headed to the bar for a few cocktails.  Good list, I would recommend the 1:2:3... The bar was packed and apparently has its own menu, made a mental note to come back and check it out separately.  \\n\\nWe were sat at approximately 9:15.  Our waiter arrived shortly there after to go over the menu.  When you have prepared yourself to spend over $100 per person on a single meal you expect a certain level of competency from your gastronomic guide, our waiter (his name escapes me) exceeded our expectation.  Not at all rushed, genuinely interested in our questions, confident in his recommendation without a hint of condescension.  We inquired about the 6 course tasting menu ($90) but unfortunately all members of the table must participate, and my friend and I were unable to convince our dates, a shame, I'm sure it would have been fantastic.  We settled on a four-course menu for $75 and frankly could not have ended up more pleased.  My meal consisted of Pork belly, Sashimi, Venison & a cheese plate to top off the meal.  Each course was unique but each shared a common quality to expertly prepared dishes, uniquely paired components that stand out independently but come together to exceed the sum of their parts.  No dish exemplified this more that the sashimi - Assiette of Kona Kampachi Sashimi.  \\n\\nAll in all I was very impressed, and my meal was among the best I have ever had.  It was about $215 for the both of us, and frankly paying that seemed quite reasonable.

Because holy crap, that was The Pizza for me.  Maybe that's the issue here - everyone has their own Antico Pizza soulmate, and I have just found mine.\\n\\nBecause seriously, almost everything about my pizza was perfect this time.  The only slight issue I had was that half of it was a little too charred, but not like the first time I visited where it was burnt to a crisp.  This time, half the pizza had a good char and half had more than I would prefer, but it was still okay.  The crust on that side just wasn't as tasty but the burnt taste didn't overpower the pizza.\\n\\nThe toppings and the flavors on the Diavaola pizza were phenomenal.  I've complained in the past that toppings weren't generous or well-distributed enough, but they must have had a new pizza baker today because there was plenty of pepperoni and more cheese than I remembered having on my other pizzas at Antico.  I was also happy with the amount of tomato.\\n\\nMy pizza was VERY oily, but trust me, that's not a bad thing.  The flavor of the oil married harmoniously with the hot peppers and garlic and tomatoes and it was a thing of beauty.  I really loved those peppers.\\n\\nThe only reason I'm withholding a fifth star at this point is that I still feel like the pizzas are inconsistent.  You can go one time and get a pizza that's unrecognizably burnt, and then go the next time and have a pizza that's a borderline religious experience.

So I went in and ordered said special and was a little off put when I wasn't asked what toppings I wanted and the guy just tossed two slices of pepperoni in the oven. A few minutes later I had a box of 2 slices and a cold 20 oz of Coke in my hand and was out in my car. I opened the box and was disappointed. These weren't normal slices of pizza, these weren't even normal slices of mid-west pizza.

The food wasn't bad, but certainly not on par with the high price point.  The drinks were also just ok.  My lemongrass mojito didn't taste much like lemongrass, and my friend's mango margarita tasted like Kool-Aid.  After spending $100 on Asian food, I expect to be wowed.

WAAAHHH? *\\n\\nFound this restaurant located in an unlikely location on a very industrial strip of Pemberton Ave.  It is fairly close to my old reliable nuts, dried fruit, and Persian bakery spot called Afra (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/afra-bakery-and-market-north-vancouver#hrid:eQ2qw0vf9-F-CbUrxd-JmQ) and I've always meant to try it out.  So glad that I finally did!  \\n\\nThe khoresh gheymeh bademjan was a wonderfully flavourful stew of chicken, eggplant, split peas, tomatoes, limoo amani (dried lime), and saffron.  The chicken was so tender and nicely highlighted by the rich flavours of the stew.  The eggplant, which had a delightfully sweet flavour, was served in long thin slices on the top, making for a very pleasant visual plating.  I'm fairly convinced there was a touch of honey added to the stew as well, but it wasn't listed as one of the ingredients.  This was served with a huge plate of fluffy Persian rice that had a very pleasant buttered flavour.\\n\\nI really appreciated that the friendly waitress (yes, friendly - I don't know why some previous reviewers on other sites complained about the service, as both waitresses were incredibly helpful and friendly) asked if I would like the beef barg kebab juicy or cooked through.  Of course I ordered it juicy, and was really happy with the choice!  They take the fillet and cut it into thin strips marinated in a saffron mixture that they then skewer and grill.  It was deliciously tender, just the right amount of char, and extremely flavour packed.  It came with a similar plate of fluffy Persian rice, a grilled tomato, and a small side salad that had a very pleasant dressing that had distinct hints of mint (nice touch!).  \\n\\nI appreciate that all of the kebabs on the menu tell you exactly how much meat they include.  Given the precision of telling you how much everything weights, the beef barg was ironically listed as 330 kg (close to 750lbs for those of you that are old fashioned!).  While it was a very generous portion my guess is that it was probably 330 g, not kg!  Most of the kebabs are either 450 \\"kg\\", 420 \\"kg\\" or 330 \\"kg\\" - plenty to share when you include all of the trimmings.  \\n\\nEnded with a cup of Persian chai, which had a very pleasant hint of spicing, and of course had to sample the desserts as well.  Had a combination of bastani (a rich housemade Persian ice cream flavoured with saffron and rose water and covered in pistachio dust) and faloodeh (a sorbet made of vermicelli, rose water, lime juice, a little starch, and also covered in pistachio dust).  The dessert was refreshing, and the perfect end to a lovely meal!  \\n\\nThis is now my favourite spot for Persian food in the Vancouver area.  I look forward to returning and trying the lamb, which I spotted on another table and it looked amazing - and the menu promises a full 450 \\"kg\\" of it!"},{"name":"Ichiro Japanese Restaurant","address":"12011 2nd Avenue","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"My husband and I came for dinner here.

The flavor was the problem. I took a taste, and thought, \\"hmm, this is ok\\". With every bite, I became disenchanted. The flavor was lackluster overall. I had never tasted a curry that was under seasoned before! I thought curries were to be an assault on the taste buds! Where was this Hardcore Cooking Style? The texture of the curry was thin, like a broth versus the thick sauce I had been used to in every other curry I've had before.  So, that's what they meant by taste the ocean...\\n\\n\\nWell, the ocean doesn't taste like much other than salt, and this didn't even seem to have that. I told the unnamed waitress that it didn't taste very good, so she walked away and brought salt and pepper shakers. What the heck am I gonna do with these? I added some of each, and the dish was still unpalatable. \\n\\nI picked at it for a while and eventually, the waitress came back and asked if I wanted to take it home to which I replied, \\"No, but I would like to have it taken off my bill.\\" At this point, she looked astonished, like she didn't expect this at all. She silently wandered to the back, where I could hear her boss yelling at her, saying \\"Why didn't you offer to get him another dish?\\" I wish I knew.  (To the owner: I didn't even get offered another dish, I was just ignored by your server until I decided it wasn't even worth eating anymore)\\n\\n\\nAt least they took it off my bill. Never again.

The eggplant was amazing and had all the flavors, textures and tastes that you'd expect/want. The pizza was a little oily and the crust was a little burnt.

Bonus: splitting the bill and paying under $20 for everything.\\n\\nDrinks: Like Florentine, Antico Forno surprised me by having an actual cocktail list in addition to the usual wine/beer only that seems to be characteristic of most North End establishments.

So I'm really all about it when a chef and/or a bartender select my food and drink for me. This made the fact that I could walk in at nine on a Sunday night, sit at a bar, and have an incredibly knowledgeable group of people prepare four tiny cocktails and six courses of food in sequence pretty much fantastic. The fact that, while waiting for our food, we sampled the first three miniature cocktails and couldn't decide which was best seemed like a good sign. Even better, the delightful bartender, who knows how to handle a shaker in a way we just don't see in Kansas City, responded to our request for \\"something to work with our food\\" (our food being a six-course meal of the chef's unknown and random choices for the evening) with something incredible, lovely, and that did in fact go with the food. Managing that was a feat in and of itself, as the courses were as varied as possible, from delicate fish to possibly the finest chicken I've ever eaten. I'll admit that, when the main course came out, I was a little sad. I wasn't sure chicken could hold up the deal after the prior couple of courses. I mean, I'm the kind of girl that normally doesn't order chicken in restaurants because I actually can handle chicken pretty bloody well at home. But this time? This was so beyond my capacity for cooking and creativity, and I have no idea why. But it was mighty fine.\\nThe funny thing about that is that we actually were given two different preparations of chicken, and I couldn't tell you which was better. The breast option was the most tender thing I've ever eaten, and absolutely mouthwateringly juicy. The other version was a thigh with the most perfectly crispy skin that every calorie counter in my brain switched off and just savored.\\nThe desserts were also phenomenal, and clearly working with the spring seasonal fruits available. And the dessert drink, which the bartender had saved for us, was like a creamy dream, but a dream that packed a punch.\\nMostly, Craigie on Main fulfills my demands for what makes phenomenal, not just great, food. I don't need foods about which I don't understand. I don't need preparations so complicated I would never be able to handle them. I just need wonderful, fresh ingredients prepared beautifully, keeping their individual flavors but working together on the plate. Basically, I just want simple food prepared beyond the norm. And Craigie on Main takes that one step further, with slightly complicated, extremely well-cooked food. \\nAnd I didn't have to pick any of it, and that's certainly something."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place was suggested to us by locals in Atlanta (and were from Chicago so we have some high standards in pizza). \\nWe were with a big group so we just went ahead and ordered 4 pizzas- while we were waiting for the pizzas we were able to sit our large party at the seat your self tables. \\nThe pizza was fresh and amazing- and the condiments are also amazing. \\n\\nDefiantly will be revisiting the next time in town!"},{"name":"Native Bowl","address":"4233 N Mississippi Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The Mississippi bowl is probably one of the best vegan bowls in Portland.

Not only have I eaten here well over a dozen occasions throughout the years, but they also catered my friend's wedding and I've used them to cater events I've hosted at Georgia Tech, etc.  \\n\\nFOOD:\\nThe food is good, the cooks can cook, these are actual born and raised Jamaicans. That said, they can be hit or miss, it just totally depends on the time you come and maybe the day. If you come during the main hours the food is hot fresh and tasty. If you come during the end of the day before closing it may be lackluster. \\n\\nI've had everything from here.... Jerk chicken, Curry chicken, Brown Stew chicken, Escoveitch, Red Snapper, Oxtail, Curry Goat. All solid choices depending on your palette. \\n\\n- Sweet and Sour chicken is my go-to dish. I love it, especially when it's hot and fresh! This is the ONLY Jamaican spot that has this dish. I order it with rice&peas, cabbage, plantain and cocoa bread. This is the only Jamaican spot that cooks my plantain perfectly, and their cocoa bread is always fresh. (knock on wood)\\n\\nThey have a signature Calypso punch that my friends love, I always opt for the D&G soda, champagne cola. \\n\\n- When you get catering from them they have these little mini patties that are awesome! Mini chicken and beef patties that are super tasty and delicious. (This item is only on the catering Caribbean menu though)\\n\\nPRICING: Great prices of course, you won't break the bank eating here. :)\\n\\nATMOSPHERE/DECOR:\\nUnfortunately lackluster. It's a nice restaurant space, the layout is solid. Lots of tables, booths, even a private room on the side/back for private parties and events. But the coloring is white and beige. In its hey day the conservative coloring made this quite the classy caribbean spot, now it just looks sorta plain. \\n\\nSERVICE: \\nLaid-back, chill, and nice. These are those super chill, friendly Jamaicans you've seen on TV. They say, \\"Hey mon\\" \\"no problem\\" and they're the original sayers of, \\"no worries\\", lol.

From Midtown I usually take Marietta Street going towards CNN Center/Centennial Olympic Park. It's off Walton Street, a one way street, there's metered parking on the side so parking can be very very tough depending on the time of day. If I go to dine-in I usually end up parking in a paid-lot that's about  a block or so away. The street is narrow and small. As other's have stated it is easy to miss this place, but just look for big windows that have \\"Calypso Cafe\\" on it. \\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nOverall, I've always been a fan of Calypso Cafe. Your experience may differ depending on the time of day, but they do have great food.

I think I've exhausted the summer menu though now that it's September and am eager for the autumn/winter menu.\\n\\nI had the frito pie with veggie chili and it was tasty as always.  \\n\\nI was slightly annoyed with this visit because I was told by the bartender that I was not allowed to play a card game I had due to some legal thing with establishments that serve alcohol.  I was playing Fluxx, which is like as non gamble-y as Old Maid or something.  So ok, maybe there is something with their liquor license that forbids them to allow patrons to play cards, but I feel like I've played cards at numerous other bars before.  Plus the guy didn't even card me when I ordered my drink.  Priorities seem weird.   Ah well.

Memories of India on Turkey Lake Rd. is much more authentic and more properly prepared. My main dislike of my lunch experience was the service. Talk about being invisible. The men waiting table there need to understand that the women who visit there are just as valuable to their business as are the men. I found the two men waiting table to be rude, condescending and unbearably slow. When I am having lunch during business hours I do not expect to have to wait over 20 minutes for the tab, only to see the waiter take it to the register and set it aside while he chatted and waited on a man.

Well, the sandwich came out open-faced which I really wished they had stated in their menu description.  I know I'm being particular, but I'm not a huge fan of open-faced sandwiches especially ones that are smothered in melted cheese.

We are slowly working our way through all of Columbus' brunch spots, and Surly Girl was this month's pick. I actually did not know that they did brunch until a woman I recently met told me about it. I have to admit that I usually steer clear of bars (because I'm eighty years old, apparently) and, sadly enough, the Short North (because my parallel parking is atrocious). But I was assured that there would be bountiful free Sunday parking in the lot across the street. This is true! Do not fear, bad parkers!\\n\\nI had an idea in my mind that Surly Girl would be, well... surly. Meaning, I was expecting a rude waitstaff. Especially since I'm not a super alternative chick with colorful hair and tattoos all over (if only!). Thankfully, the staff was friendly even to a vanilla bean like me, and I was much more at ease when we were greeted with a smile. I wonder if things get surlier in the evenings?\\n\\nI really enjoyed the kitschy rockabilly-esque decor, which was still Christmas-fied even though it was after the new year. My table had glitter in it! Yay.\\n\\nI knew from scoping out the menu that I should expect mostly southwestern options for brunch. I went back and forth between a few things before landing on the Black Bean Huevos 'Surlitos' with added pork. It was pretty good, but I wished there were a little more flavor (maybe more ranchero sauce?) and slightly fewer beans. I ended up tossing the accompanying roasted potatoes into the mix for something extra. I found it a little bit unruly to eat because it's so huge. I ended up taking half home, and when I reheated it, I added some cheese and a little Sriracha, which I thought improved things. So I'm not knocking it, but I'd like to go back and try something else.\\n\\nAnyway, while I doubt I'll venture here for weekend drinks any time soon, I'd like to go back for another meal and what I've heard are pretty good cupcakes."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"I went here expecting a lot due to all of the great reviews.

The lot was totally empty ... was the restaurant closed? ... thankfully, that was not the case, we had just arrived ahead of their opening time of 11:30am.  We were inside, seated, and ordering from our friendly, and most-helpful young male server in just a matter of a few minutes.  I had taken some potential menu item suggestions with me, which really helped a lot, as the menus (two of them) are rather long, and it would have taken quite some time to order (at least for this, our first time dining there).  Here is what was ordered and shared:\\n\\n--  Ojing Uh Butter Goo Yi (grilled, butter whole squid):  squid is a big favourite of daughter and I, and this  preparation and presentation was perfect - the whole squid sliced from tentacles to tail, and then re-assembled as 'whole' on the plate, and served with a dipping sauce.  Good looking, fresh, tender, and tasty.  \\n--  Yaang Neom Tuk Dong Saan (crispy rice cake, in sweet chili soy sauce):  the rice cake presentation looked much the same as tried in other Korean restaurants, but was prepared a little differently, with the sauce a tasty, sort of sweet & spicy, and the textures of the cakes a little chewy.  Colourful and tasty.  \\n--  Soon Sahl Gaan Jaang Chicken (crispy, deep-fried, boneless, soy chicken):  wow! what a fantastic preparation of chicken - breaded, nuggets of boneless chicken, crispy on the outside, wonderfully tender and sweet on the inside, with such a flavourful soy-based sauce.  So well-prepared, and so tasty.\\n--  Dol Sot BiBimBaab (purple rice, sliced meats, and salad, in sizzling stone bowl, w/bowl of stock on side):  I ordered the bibimbaab mostly to get some rice and veggies (what the Koreans usually refer to as the 'salad' in their bibimbaabs), and ordered one prepared in the stone bowl, for the 'sizzle' and extra taste these preparations seem to provide - it came to our table looking great, very colourful, nice aroma, and sizzling away.  A fine addition to our meal - colourful and very tasty.\\n--  and the supplied banchan (side dishes) of kimchi, seaweed, and fried onions.  And an example of the fine service we received, our server took the dishes away, and replenished each of the contents, without any asking or prompting on our part, when 'he' noticed they were getting empty!\\n\\nMy belated birthday lunch at Pocha Korea Bistro was a fine treat, and big hit with the three of us.

Fuck no.\\nI recall back in the olden days, certain acquaintances were given popcorn tins every Christmas. Gigantic cylinders filled with two or three or four varieties of popcorn, only one of which - the caramel-coated - was suitable for consumption, days or weeks after being popped.\\n\\nCaJa (pronounced simply Kah-Jah) is no better.

Nothing to snack on while dancing on Orville Redenbacher's grave. Pimento Cheese is not so great; a failed execution. There was also a Peach flavor that simply didn't work and a spicy variety - perhaps Jalape√±o - which was just OK. One thing all the flavors had in common: The popcorn itself tasted old. Spongy.

A failure on every measure... except perhaps the one they probably care most about, given the prospects for a business' first year. We'll see how this trend holds up over time.

In my opinon better than the still very good Congolaise (tomato based coconut cream sauce).  \\n\\nThe other entrees we got weren't as spetacular but still delicious and lastly we were able to sample the dessert of the honey creme brule - again very good.

The long line around lunch time is just an indicator that the food is good, though as a new yorker i'd like it to move about five times as fast.\\n\\nThey have a wide variety of menu sandwiches, but of course you can build your own. I was delighted to see multiple vegetarian sandwiches on the boards, and went with the three cheese (i got jack, cheddar, and provalone), with some fixins. \\n\\nNow, my New York friends may not appreciate me saying this, but... Reuben's did it right. In New York, deli sandwiches are chronically overloaded. Maybe that works better for meat, but for cheese it means you're, well, eating a big bite of nearly solid cheese. Reuben's three cheese sandwich had plenty of cheese, but the lettuce, tomato, and chopped pickle (!) all fit in too. Their deli mustard is also plenty spicy, which is yet another plus.\\n\\nThis was one of the best meals i had in my week in Atlanta, and i highly recommend it (at least for vegetarians)."},{"name":"Estelle's Boston","address":"782 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Brian Poe, you disappoint me again.

My friends and I ordered the tasso ham hush puppies and fried pickles as starters, and then the fried chicken, the brisket po-boy, and the shrimp po-boy for our entrees.\\n\\nThe worst tasting had to have been the brisket po-boy. It was extremely greasy, the meat dry, and it was bland overall--I do NOT recommend. My shrimp po-boy was okay, but not what I expected. It was mushy and needed more seasoning as well as something crispy (maybe a crunchy slaw in addition to the corn chow chow already on there) to give it some zing. The tasso ham hush puppies were okay and came with a nice chili-honey sauce, but I tasted no ham, nor did I chew any. The fried chicken was okay, but the accompanying mac was very bland and the bechamel cheese sauce too flour-y.

When I called to make the reservation (and make sure our rooms were near one another), I was pleased to find out it wouldn't cost any more than reserving it online. That's a plus, as so many hotels have online-only rates which you can't get if you need to call and confirm they can meet all your weirdly complex needs (sometimes I have weirdly complex needs, guys).\\n\\nThis is a European style hotel, for the most part. Meaning that yes, you will most likely be sharing a bathroom with the floor. On the plus side, there are 4 bathrooms on every floor and only 10 or 11 rooms that share them. I never had to wait to use one, even to take a shower in the morning.  If that skeeves you out too much, they DO offer rooms with private bathrooms. Just make sure you get a King suite.\\n\\nThe rooms are all different, each themed after a song, with hand-painted walls and headboards and vintage light fixtures hanging from the ceiling. It is well-maintained, unique, and really just a fun stay for younger adults.\\n\\nThe things I didn't really like about this hotel are as follows:\\n1) It's really dark. I mean, seriously, dimly lit. Half the bulbs they use in the light fixtures are tinted orange and don't really emit much for light.\\n2) The beds are VERY FIRM. My (admittedly sensitive) back was killing me by the end of the trip.\\n3) The rooms are teensy tiny. Not much more furniture in them than the bed and one chair. Though they provide hooks all over the place, storage is still a challenge. I'm just glad my travel makeup bag is designed for camping so it hangs on random things.\\n4) There is quite a bit of street noise, even on the top floor of the hotel. Between drunk people acting like petulant children and deliveries being made in the middle of the night, it can be difficult to get a full night's sleep. Bring earplugs or pick some up from the front desk.\\n5) The guy in the soaking tub who was \\"looking to mingle\\" (his words, not mine). Seriously, dude, cowboy boots and jesus hair do not make me want to talk to you.

If you're not staying at this hotel, go to one of their restaurant/bar things attached and drink the Ruby Ale. Just do it.\\n2) Speaking of the bar... I watched the bartender ACTUALLY refuse service to someone who was WAAAAAYYYY too drunk. I've NEVER seen that before in any bar anywhere. And I was glad he did, because the drunk guy was a total douche. (Guy totally got kicked out, too. Such a douche...) We tipped well that night.\\n3) Really inexpensive for the area.\\n4) The staff is lovely. They're sweet and really pay attention to your needs as a guest.

I am usually a glass-half-full experiencer of untried restaurants and bars.  However, Harvard Gardens was really disappointing when we went for brunch this past Sunday.  The service, food and prices all left me feeling really unenthusiastic about the Harvard Gardens experience.\\n\\nService: Our server was very sullen and inaudibly soft spoken.  After every order - food or drink - he would bring us our check which was totally unsolicited and gave the impression that he was ready for us to vacate his booth.  That is a serious no-no to me, particularly because we were continuing to order each time and the restaurant was not busy in the least.  Maybe it wasn't the server - is that HG policy?  Either way, the management should squash that practice ASAP.\\n\\nFood: The portion size of my expensive (more on that later) huevos rancheros was tiny.  The eggs benedict tasted like the frying pan's plastic coating and the hollandaise had zero flavor.  Neither dishes were particularly delicious, which was distressing given the cost.\\nI was excited to try their raved about truffle fries - but they were never delivered without an explanation.  Lastly, if you are going to name your Bloody Mary, you better make sure it's good.  Theirs was not.\\n\\nPrice: Boston has a wide variety of AWESOME brunch places that charge $10 for a delicious brunch.  For that reason, I was really surprised by the expense of the breakfast items on the menu.  Huevos rancheros consist of some very cheap ingredients - eggs, beans, tortillas - and the expensive ingredients used by HG were doled out in a very small portion - avocado, cotijo cheese.  For $15, I would expect enough huevos to feed two people and be amazing.  These barely fed one and were meh.  \\n\\nI work in Beacon Hill and have always wanted to try Harvard Gardens.

The appetizers were very good. I think my favorite of the bunch would be the ahi tuna, but the grilled beef and chorizo is up there too. I think the only complaint on my end was that the halibut portion was too small. I would've preferred something a tad larger, but the overall taste was excellent. It was cooked perfectly. I tried the steak and it was perfectly rare. Everyone loved the mussels since we made sure those were all gone. Oh and the french fries served with it were gone too. Haha. The lamb shank was HUGE! I'm talking HUGE. When it came out, I thought someone ordered two portions. All I know is that my buddy enjoyed every bite.\\n\\nOur group had a mixture of drinks including wine and some cocktails. I had the Bellevue Hotel which I really liked. It tasted like a Cinnabon drink because of the cinnamon/nutty flavor. I know to some it might sound unappetizing and to others it might sound great, but it had a good balance. Another drink that was ordered was the Do√±a Sol, which had a mix of Thai basil, lemongrass and orange. This was pretty pungent with flavor. Both drinks were very strong, which is a very good thing. I wish I could've tried their other cocktails, but that's for next time.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE = 5 Stars: We were welcomed into this dark and mysterious place with a bunch of smiles and greetings from the workers.

I was wrong. the cool and elegant atmosphere of the front continued throughout the restaurant. The decorations made it feel very sleek and mysterious... dark, but not too dark... just the right amount of dark. Haha.\\n\\nConsidering the atmosphere, you'd expect a level of stuffiness, but everything was very laid back and flowed like a gentle stream. Our dinner seemed to have flashed by so quickly because we enjoyed ourselves. \\n\\nSERVICE = 5 Stars: The waiters were very attentive to everything... from checking on us to ensuring we had plenty of drinks to even clearing the empty plates. Their service didn't skip a beat and it made the night that much better. Not to mention they were extremely personable and made you feel at ease.\\n\\nRECOMMENDATION: This place is one of the best restaurants that I've ever been to anywhere.

We did know that New India wasn't a buffet, but still wanted Indian food and had heard good things about it from a friend, so decided to try it out.\\n\\nOur opinion is that it was fine, not great, and kinda expensive for what one gets. I've eaten at many different Indian restaurants (some outside of Texas, even), and I kind of feel like this one seemed more \\"homestyle\\" than most. That adjective isn't an insult, I've had some very good \\"homestyle\\" Mexican food, for example. The food at New India really did seem like stuff that I could easily make given the time and the ingredients (I do cook Indian food at home, but not all that often since the preparation is often time-consuming), but that's not a bad thing per se, just different than what I'm used to with Indian food. \\n\\nSo anyhow, on to a description of our actual meal. We ordered tap water to drink. We noticed that the restaurant had bottled and canned sodas rather than a fountain, and that many people who came in to eat weren't prepared for the restaurant's BYOB status and had to run across the street to buy alcohol. \\n\\nWe decided to get samosas as an appetizer. They were okay, a bit lighter on the breading/wrapper than I'm used to (often the part that makes or breaks a samosa for me), and mostly tasting of spiced potato. For some reason the waitress felt she needed to give a detailed explanation of the sauces provided with the samosas, even though they were just the usual tamarind sauce and cilantro sauce that come with samosas and such. She also had assumed that we would have questions about and need help with the menu... I'm not sure why, but I did wonder whether it had to do with all of the elderly folks in the restaurant... maybe this is a common place for older people to try their first Indian food and they therefore need a lot of explanation? I prefer to eat my samosas with raita, so I asked the waitress for some (though it was listed as costing the princely sum of $2 on the menu, the same as extra rice), and she seemed surprised that I knew what that was (neither this waitress nor I are of South Asian ethnicity). When the raita arrived it was a small amount and very very chunky, mostly veggies rather than yogurt, which was a bit disappointing. We didn't eat much with the samosas since we'd ordered our curries medium-hot and figured we might need the raita to cool them down. \\n\\nMy husband ordered our old standby of Saag Paneer and I had decided to try the \\"Malvani Coconut Chicken Curry.\\" We shared the dishes since that made it slightly more like a buffet. We also asked for two orders of \\"naan\\" (this naan has no yeast, so the texture isn't the same as other naan).\\n\\nThe food was again, fine not great. The menu had said that the saag paneer was available with or without cream, but the waitress didn't ask our preference before walking off, so I guess it was left out. It did have good spinach flavor, though the large paneer chunks included were near-tasteless (I think I would've assumed they were tofu if I didn't know better... I do like tofu, it's just that paneer and tofu shouldn't be indistinguishable). I'd assumed that my chicken curry would acquire flavor and creaminess from the coconut component (my favorite thing about the coconut curries I've had and made previously), but it didn't have much coconut taste at all and the meat seemed like some sort of cut-up chicken breast patty. Both dishes did seem to be at the requested spice level and were in decent portions, including the ratio of meat/paneer to sauce. \\n\\nOur meal had not seemed extravagant in terms of what we received, so the $40+ total seemed high for 2 small samosas, one vegetarian curry and one chicken curry, a side of raita (which at most restaurants would be free or around a dollar), and two orders of naan. We may go back to New India if a friend wants badly to go or if all other restaurants on South Congress are too crowded and we are really hungry, otherwise I don't think we'll be back."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Best pizza in Atlanta (and I've been told better than the pizza in itlay). \\n\\nFood: if you eat pork, I'd recommend the San Genarro. The peppers are both sweet and spicy and the sausage is perfectly cooked. If you don't eat pork, I'd go with the Pomodorini which is a white pizza with cherry tomatoes that are melting on top. All Antico pizzas have a thin crust with char on the edges. Most pizzas will run you about $20 and they feed 2 hungry people well (3 if you're not as hungry). \\n\\nPRO TIP: use the toppings station in the kitchen area. I like to mix garlic, Parmesan, red pepper, and olive oil. People who LIKE Antico don't use toppings. People who LOVE Antico do. \\n\\nQuirks: they won't change any pizza (substitutions, removing toppings, adding toppings, etc) so don't bother asking. \\n\\nAmbiance: this place is informal, crowded (unless you go at an off time), and loud. Listen carefully for your number. You'll eat off your pizza tray. There are rolls of paper towels to use as napkins. There are also cups that you can fill with water at the sinks if you don't buy a drink or BYO wine/beer which is allowed!).

Both tacos were on flour and I opted to get lettuce and tomatoes on the chicken taco. The chicken fajita taco and salsa were mediocre pretty mediocre. The chicken didn't taste that fresh although the tortilla and vegetables were fresh. The included salsa, one a green sauce and one a red sauce were also not particularly flavorful although both were spicy, even for someone that indulges in spicy food pretty regularly. However, the breakfast potato taco was excellent. The potatoes and cheese tasted fresh and the tortilla had the same fluffy, chewy quality of the one used in the chicken fajita taco.

Such payments and their size are a matter of social custom. \\n\\nIn countries where tipping is expected (the United States for example), complicated unofficial standards and customs have developed over the exact percentage to tip, and what should and should not be included in this calculation. In other cultures where tipping exists it is more flexible and no specific assumptions of the tip amount exist.\\nSome believe the custom of tipping helps to improve service, as workers may receive higher tips from satisfied customers. In the United States, some employers pay workers with the expectation that tips will make up the difference. The practice of tipping is controversial, with numerous criticisms. Some have criticized the inherent \\"social awkwardness\\" in transactions that involve tipping, the inconsistency of tipping for some services but not similar ones, and the irrationality of basing tips on price, rather than the amount and quality of service."},{"name":"Volare Restaurant and Bar","address":"388 Broadway","city":"Revere","stars":"4","text":"Fan-fucking-tastic.

It extolled the new wine bar's virtues: namely, no glass of wine more expensive than $8, and tapas for $3.95.  She and I have been to most wine bars in town, and drink more than our fair share of the vino.  So when she said she wanted to visit this new place, I was all about it.\\n\\nSo I felt somewhat guilty when I called my brother and he invited me join him and his better half at Simplicity; my girlfriend was working, and thus unable to attend.\\n\\nAll was not lost however, as I'll definitely be back--and next time, with my lady in tow.  I had a fantastic time at Simplicity.\\n\\nAll in all, I tried three different wines and several tapas.  Sipped a Gewurztraminer, a sauvignon blanc/ viognier blend, and a delicious torrontes from Argentina.  The by-the-glass list covered a surprisingly wide range of varietals from around the globe, and if I'm not mistaken has only one example of each grape or blend.  Each was quite good, and I think I may have begun a serious infatuation with torrontes. \\n\\nThe tapas (3.95!) were equally impressive.  I could live on roasted garlic--they remained in the skin with tops chopped off, caramelized in the clove.  Absolutely fantastic.  And the garbanzo beans with rosemary proved distracting: I wasn't even hungry and kept revisiting the dish.  Same goes for the manchego cheese tapa.  \\n\\nService was attentive without being intrusive, relaxed without being too informal.\\n\\nMy only beefs are the relatively early closing time of 11pm, and the very basic ambiance.

And part of me feels there really is no words to best describe how this place is, but I will do my best. I guess I'll start off by just stating the fact that Lola is amazing. And somehow she has managed to take that, and transform it into what we see as a restaurant and just plain damn good home cooking. Upon entering, your eyes may roam around her decorations and all, but when you look closely, you'll begin to notice letters of high praise and various city awards that she has won for what she does. Heck, the Chronicle gave her one titled \\"Angel Places On This Earth\\". And after the two hours I nearly spent there with fellow yelpers, I can totally see why. Lola is a one woman show - she's the hostess, the waitress, the chef, and the checkout woman. I had ordered the fried catfish and have to say I was no where near disappointed. Portions were plentiful, the cornbread was to-die-for, makes me with I could just by the cornbread by the pan. Between everybody, orders ranged from the pork chop, shrimp  & catfish po'boys, and crawfish etouffee and fried catfish, and there wasn't a complaint in the house. In addition, it was totally awesome to have seen how busy she was yesterday for lunch. all tables were occupied, and there were some people that came in & left because there wasn't enough seating for their group. Heck i think I remember seeing a couple people just getting it to go. Another thing I noticed, is even though how busy Lola was, and how you may have to wait a few extra minutes for her to come take your order, not a single person in that place was rude about the wait. There are very few places that I know of where people don't mind having to wait a little bit longer for any type of service. However if you have good company to chat it up with, like I did yesterday, then the time passes and you don't even realize it. Plus you can just get lost looking around at her numerous decorations and letters and awards as I know I did once or twice. And as Susie G. put it, extravagant tipping will make you feel like a better person leaving this place. Simply cuz you know that it is going to help her as a business owner, but also as a good citizen that she is to close down her business on Sundays to feed the homeless. So I can't really stress enough to visit this lovely hidden gem in Austin and help out a woman who is doing some good for our fabulous city.

That's what WIngs is like.\\n\\nI'd write something about their interior, like how comfy their chairs were and now awesome the art was, but seriously, this place was made for food.\\n\\nConsidering that we were at a restaurant that specialized in wings, we indulged ourselves in some.  They have a pretty awesome variety of flavors and spices, and they have a lot of different dipping sauces.  We tried a pound of Tokyo wings and two pounds of Spicy buffalo wings, while washing it all down with a pitcher of Stella Artois.  The Tokyo wings were pretty damn bomb, but the Buffalo wings KILLED us.  Our waitress was kind enough to split half of our wings as two stars and half of our wings as three stars on the spice meter.  They have the usual five star rating for spiciness, and I can usually handle spicy pretty damn well, but consuming their three star wings was like drinking a bottle of Tabasco straight.\\n\\nRegardless of the intestinal burn that I experienced later that night, I would definitely come back to Wings again.  The waitresses are cute and talkative, the wings were bomb, they show sports on the tvs, there's a fully stocked bar, and they blast hip hop.

I thought this was a quick service, and maybe it was at some point, but once I saw the full parking lot and inside, I knew I was wrong. Families were waited to be seated so I just grabbed a seat at the bar. The manager? Took care of me. He was very helpful and nice. I got my mango juice (frozen from concentrate and blended) and he put this sauce duo in front of me. It's a great tactic. Not only a conversation starter, but since it's there, you might as well order apps. The green sauce is supposed to be very spice and the white is a garlic sauce. I didn't try them until I got my guac and tostones. The guac was amazing and fresh as can be! I ordered it mild, and added both sauces to it, food amounts, too. The green sauce wasn't as spicy as he claimed (is it bc I'm not Latino? Maybe). My nose was running, but I was no where near needing to chug water. The guacamole is in the top 3 of orlando for sure. Right up there with the $14 Rocco's tacos. Idk how spicy the hot would have been, but next time I'll try it. For my meal I ordered the number 1: quarter chicken, maduros, and rice and beans. The rotisserie chicken had a delicious crusty skin and the dark meat was juicy. White meat is $1 extra, I believe. Anyone that would order the white meat probably orders their steak well done, too. The inside needed the sauces, but not in a bad way. Rice and beans were good. I wish the saffron rice had more saffron. But the sweet plantains! My favorite part to dip in the sauces ( obviously a mixture of both) and they give you a healthy (oxymoron?) portion of them! Score!

The service was too fast to believe that the food was cooked to order, so they probably just put it together fresh. the table bread was tough cold and dry, but the garlic bread we ordered was soft and tasty. The food was very good with the lobster ravioli and the \\nziti with chicken and brocoli deserving special mentions. THe eggplant parmigianaand the fusili siciliani were good too and there is a vegetarian section which gives plenty of meatless options. The service was rude and entirely lacking. There is no parking anywhere nearby and the haymarket T Station is super expensive. A big drawback is that the place is cash only and luckily we had enough to cover the bill but be warned... the menu is short and simple with a few daily on the chalkboard above.

There are condiments aka garlic, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, and hot peppers by the ovens to which you can help yourself. \\n\\nKnocked off one star because of two reasons. First, I understand this can't be helped but they don't allow split pizzas-aka one side one style and the other half another style. So if you're a veg eater and your Boo eats meat, you gotta just get two pies.\\n\\nSecondly, why are the dang pies so expensive?! This isn't NYC. For a pie, the price is anywhere from $18-20.

Beware- When I tried adding this option to the lunch orders they did not accept the lunch add on as it is only for those who choose to dine in. This is not noted on their menu and it is not advertised properly.

I still think it is amazing but the service on Saturday mornings is absolutely horrible!!!! It's so bad that I think if the owner actually saw what was going on, he would be mortified. \\n\\nI went in this past weekend 2/17/12 with my husband on our way to grocery shopping. We got seated immediately which was shocking since most of the time we're waiting by the door for 15 minutes in a place that has zero customers or maybe one couple at the most. After we were seated our waiter came over quickly which was great, we thought this would actually be a good breakfast experience at this place for once. Nope. Right after seating us, our waiter proceeded to walk outside to begin washing the windows. There's a good number of windows at Red Lentil and we figured it would take him at least 15-20 minutes to wash them. We thought maybe someone was going to take over for him. Nope. We sat and waited and watched him wash the windows. My husband was getting annoyed because this is not the first time we've had crappy service here while getting breakfast. He just wasn't taking it anymore so he literally went halfway in the kitchen to see if there was another waiter. There was. He was practically hiding in a back room, not sure why. The wait staff outnumbered the customers so we couldn't understand why it was so hard to get someone to take our order. \\n\\nTo make a long story short, the guy took our order. Got my husbands order wrong. Never came back to fill water or ask if we needed anything else (condiments, coffee fill-up etc.) No, he was too busy talking to this couple who he was obviously friends with about some stupid paper flowers the woman made. It reminded me of an episode of Portlandia no joke. \\n\\nThe time before this was not much better. The waitress pretty much told me that what I ordered was too much food for me and I wouldn't be able to finish it. I had to argue with her to get what I wanted. That should never happen. I'm a fitness lover and I'm slender but I eat a lot to compensate the calories I burn and I just thought it was rude and inappropriate to comment on my eating habits. To punish me for ordering all this food (which really wasn't that much) she mysteriously lost my order even though my husbands food came right out and our orders were put in at the same time. The place was not crowded only one other couple so we concluded she did this to get back at me. It was really bizarre. She apologized with a smug looking smile but my husband gave her a look as if to say \\"cut the shit, I know exactly what you did bitch.\\" The smug smile she had on  her face disappeared quickly after that and she could barely look him in the eyes. We have very rarely had a good breakfast experience at Red Lentil it's usually a combination of rude servers, a long wait to be seated or have the order taken despite very few customers (they're all going to Deluxe Town Diner across the street, which is where we're going from now on), and just an all around feeling that we are somehow inconveniencing them by being there.

Sounds fun. However, you can't sleep in a fun concept. This is a hotel first and foremost, and as such completely fails to provide the basic amenities one would expect, especially given the premium price.\\n\\nThe most glaring issue is the lack of bathrooms in the rooms. From what I could tell, of the 30ish rooms available, only six have a bathroom in the room itself. The rest of the rooms share a bathroom in the hallway. This is quaintly, and misleadingly, described as \\"euro-style\\" by the hotel, which caused my German girlfriend to respond \\"If you pay $150 for a room in Europe you can sleep in a castle. AND you'd get a private f---ing bathroom\\". \\n\\nThe rooms themselves are generally unpleasant. Though stocked with funky artwork and moody lighting, they are extremely cramped. No closet space or drawers are provided to store your clothes, and the quality of the bed is equal to what you'd expect from the cheapest of chain motels. The walls are thin enough to hear every cough from the adjoining rooms, and the windows are so drafty that the below-freezing air outside could just waft in like it owned the place.\\n\\nAs a Pacific Northwesterner, I have loved McMenamins for years, patronizing their many restaurants and even staying at their Kennedy School hotel on a couple of special occasions.

And, even though there was a peppercorn crusted New York Strip on the menu, I decided to keep with the healthy theme and avoid it. For starters, Lady Steakhead and I tried the Crab & Grilled Corn Fritters and the House Smoked Salmon Crostini. The fritters were served with a spicy aioli and for some reason, honey. And while the fritters were good, the salmon was definitely the winner. I wish I could find smoked salmon like that from a store somewhere.\\n\\nFor our entres, I had the Hawaiian Moonfish, a fish I had never even heard of before. It's a white fish, with a consistency like tuna. In fact, like tuna, it can be served medium rare. It was served over vegetable quesadillas with a rock shrimp cream sauce. I loved this dish- everything went together extremely well. Lady Steakhead was delighted to see a Cioppino on the menu- a sort of fish stew for those not familiar.

The best way to explain it was that every bite was just, loud.\\n\\nAs it was lunchtime, we had the buffet, and I managed to try just about everything I could find. To start on a positive note, the Chicken Tikki Masala was the only thing that actually made me look forward to the next bite. It was fine, but that might have just been in comparison to the other dishes. The Veggie Biryani, and the Chicken Biryani was plain and just unappetizing. The, I guess fried mushrooms, were not gross but were spicy which did not make much sense to me. The curry's were very bad as well as the other masala dishes, including some kind of raw banana thing that was just terrible. Halai Kabab was the last entree I tried, unfortunately, as it was very overcooked and tasted like it was drowned in a bottle of mustard. I know it is supposed to taste far less... loud than it was.\\n\\nThe naan was too far overcooked and the dessert dish was plain and just a bowl of mush that tasted vaguely like a... mango, maybe?\\n\\nI did not like this restaurant and am really upset that it did not live up to my expectations coming in. There were many people inside the place so I thought it would be at least somewhat appetizing, but unfortunately it fell far short. I have to give it about 3/10, and will be back only because I cannot believe how bad it was given how many people were there."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Love this place !

The process of making our reservation via OpenTable was smooth and painless. We arrived on time and were seated immediately.  We were given a drink menu and a food menu. I can't say that the evening's selections particularly moved me, but my husband and I were able to find entrees to suffice. For starters, we ordered the white shrimp. They were served - with heads intact - on a smearing of grits. To quote my husband directly, \\"it tastes like I'm eating from a bait bucket.\\" I myself would not be so harsh, but the appetizer left little to be desired. Second, we ordered a white Caesar to share. Unfortunately, the dressing was so salty that I couldn't tolerate eating more than a third of the salad. Third, my husband ordered  the beef shoulder (\\"vaca frita\\") and I ordered the striped bass. I can't say anything specifically bad about the meal, just that it was mediocre at best. Prior to the meal I ordered a \\"class of 75\\" mixed drink which was tasty and my husband and I both enjoyed a glass of reisling with the meal. We were also served water with the meal. My husband asked to have another glass brought to the table because the first glass he was given smelled of old milk or \\"pond water\\" as my husband described it...  We closed the meal with a piece of tres leches cake which was good, but not as good as mine. In all, the cost of our meal totalled  $142. For that price, we would opt to go to Goblin Market in Mount Dora, The Chef's Table in Winter Garden or the Backroom Steakhouse in Apopka.

I was particularly concerned about the price. However, we have now dined her two times in the last 10 days or so, and have been very pleased. \\n\\nOn our first visit we were actually headed to Sweet Tomatoes next door. While in the Sweet Tomatoes parking lot, we decided we wanted fish instead and decided to at least go in and look the menu. I am glad we did!\\n\\nOn the first visit, we ordered two appetizers (the calamari and stuffed mushrooms). Both were very good. For entrees we had the Jambalaya pasta (my partner really enjoyed it), the scallops carbonara with penne pasta (I loved it! the bacon didn't overpower the dish, and the scallops were sweet and cooked perfectly). Our friend had the seafood combination, which he said was good. My partner and his friend had the clam chowder (my partner said it was the best he had ever had) and I had the seafood stew, which was super tasty, but could have used less tomatoes and more fish. \\n\\nWe also had two desserts: the bread pudding, which I thought was good, but not great, and the Marionberry Cobbler, which is worth raving about. \\n\\nTwo appetizers, 3 bowls of soup, 3 entrees, two desserts and 3 sodas = less than $75. Maybe its because I am new to the Pacific Northwest, but after living in both San Francisco and the Washington DC area, $75 is cheap!!\\n\\nHow to describe the service?? Well... They were very busy. We waited for a table for about 20 minutes. Once we made it to the table, we waited a bit for our order to be taken, but not too long. The food did take a while. I wasn't timing it, but maybe 20 minutes,. Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable. However, she epitomized the dizty blonde.  She got our orders mixed up, forgot requested items like glasses of water and hot sauce, etc. She also dropped a partially filled dish while clearing the table. Normally I would ding a place for this type of thing, but she was so sweet and so friendly, and really was trying very hard. I just couldn't be upset.

I feel like a thick layer of chili oil in the bowl is often an indicator of using a tom yum paste. This soup had the layer of chili oil but also had some nice lemongrass and kafir lime flavors. It was not exceptional but not bad either. $5\\n\\nThe papaya salad is a decent size/value for $6.  The shredded  green papaya is tossed in a solution of lemon juice, sugar, salt, and fish sauce. The lemon juice is strong in this papaya salad and their is no basil to balance out the acidity. Overall, it is a nice appetizer and sometimes it comes with some tasty crunchy green beans. They were not present in this order however. \\n\\nThe chinese broccoli with garlic is a new item on their tapas menu. It was a small portion but only $4 and thoroughly enjoyable. The bitter green vegetle element was complimented nicely with roasted garlic and light oyster sauce.\\n\\nThe nam sod is always a good choice. The flavors are balanced well and the minced protein is presented with lime juice, mint/herbs, dry chili, sugar, ground nuts, and a healthy serving of fresh shredded ginger.\\n\\nOne of my favorite entrees on the menu is the Smokey Pot. It is one of the more simple and subtle dishes at Seathai. It consists of glass noodles, cabbage, shrimp, chicken, cinnamon, star anise, and ginger cooked in a hot black pot. The flavors all intermingle and the result is a comforting and soothing herbal noodle dish. \\n\\nThere is some noticeable overlap in the flavors and sauces Seathai uses for their dishes and some are better than others.

Word of advice...get there early because you are likely to wait about an hour and bring cash. Also the smaller the party, the better. If you have more than 5-6 people, the wait may be longer since the place is so small.

You have one job and that is to make fall off the bone tender ribs, perfectly cooked brisket, and over the top sides.... Don't get me started on the sides. \\n\\nI guess this is what food T.V. and mass media do to restaurants. I'll leave it at this, is salt lick spent less time worrying on cutting the pickles to cater to overly pretentious \\"foodies\\" who can't distinguish good food from crap, they could in fact pay attention to what has made them popular to begin with.\\n\\nI'll just enjoy the bocce ball and my shinner for a minute, so I don't feel ripped off."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"The fish and chips was excellent!

It clearly feels like the workers are trying to leave as soon as the restaurant closes at the expense of offering the full Cafe Yumm menu. I would get it if I came in 10 min before closing but earlier than that is just poor service for a college, fast-food eatery."},{"name":"Nakato Japanese Restaurant","address":"1776 Cheshire Bridge Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Update:  Woah!  They got bad.  \\n\\nFirst review:  I am trying to come up with something bad to say about the sushi rolls or other food here.  Nope, can't do it.  A common sushi roll is about half the size of the rolls you get here.  Brown rice, no problemo.\\n\\nI was staying at the New Hollywood W and someone suggested this place for a quick lunch - I came back 3 times during the week of my stay.  You will be happy to know that they have a creative Sushi Happy Hour - which means sushi is almost half priced.  Check on the times.\\n\\nEnjoy this find.  Just came back and what 4 years can do.  Busier and not so good anymore.

Great!\\n\\nI've been looking for an elevated Vietnamese place and I've found it.  They are located where two other restaurants have failed but if they keep up their quality, they should do fine.\\n\\nI came for lunch on a mild Sunday.  It was busy but not packed.  The outdoor patio is communal seating, family style table.  Indoors looks clean and upscale with individual tables. \\n\\nThey have a lot of things on the menu that are not at your typical \\"fast food\\" pho.  I did not try the pho as I wanted to experience a different side of this cuisine.\\n\\nThe Son-in-law appetizer is amazing.  A soft boiled egg encased in a light crispy batter with a tamarind sauce that is sweet but not too sweet.  The runny yoke was perfect.  I loved this dish.\\n\\nThe wok-seared beef on rice was really tasty.  The dish didn't need the typical sweetened fish sauce but it does enhance the flavor.  The beef was cooked well and the accompany salad pulled everything into a clean, crispy and tender masterpiece. \\n\\nIf I have anything negative to say, it would be that the prices are higher than most Vietnamese restaurants but this is Yaletown.  And while I won't come here every day, I will definitely be back to try their other dishes.\\n\\nI really hope they survive."},{"name":"Stats","address":"300 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I really liked this place.

My sister & I brought our mom here for a birthday dinner because we thought she would love it since she loves French food & it's close to where she lives. To make a long story short, our waiter took forever to come back when he left the table each time; the food was only OK; my mom had the coque au vin & hated it, couldn't even finish but would not send it back.. *sigh* We called ahead & they knew we had come for her birthday. At one point the mgr even stopped by the table to see how everything was. THEN when dessert time came (which we ordered), no one came with a candle on her dessert. I'm not asking for cheesy singing or anything like that but jeez... at least a plate that says HBD & a candle. They just brought it out and... Nothing. My sis & I were mortified, wondering why we didn't TRIPLE check & say something to one of the staffers about it being her birthday & to bring something out showing this..... which we shouldn't have had to do since they were already aware! But by then it was too late. & We knew our mom did not love the experience when she actually said, \\"Wow no candle huh?\\" ÔøΩ?Again, mortified.\\n\\nSafe to say that I probably won't be back ever.
