I visited Felico's for the very first time in December 2012 with two friends of mine. I ordered some seafood pasta and was not at all happy with the way it tasted, the pasta was overcooked and I just couldnt eat it after a couple of bites. When we asked for the bill, the waiter bought it to us and when we told him we wanted to split it 3 ways he became furious and said no it doesnt work like that. So we sat there totally stunned and one of us was about to pay the whole amount, when he stomped away and bought our split bill. I mean ok if it is so much to ask he can tell it to us politely and not literally yell at us. My mood instantly became sour and I vowed never to come back.\\n\\nSo now the most recent review, we went to Felico's to celebrate Mother's Day May 2014, I was kind of apprehensive to go there because the memory of my last experience came back to me and I was hoping that I wouldnt have to deal with waiters with that kind of attitude. Our waiter was really polite and friendly. Our food was spectacular. Some of us ordered steak with lobster, Chicken schnitzel with mushroom sauce, rack of lamb and chicken souvlaki. Everything was cooked to perfection and came steaming hot. We also ordered 3 kinds of dessert, the tiramisu, supreme vanilla cake or something and creme caramel. The Tiramisu was by far the best one I have ever tasted, dint really care about the supreme one. The creme caramel was okay too.\\n\\nOverall, we had quite a nice time, the waiters made sure our glasses were filled, came to check if we needed anything and how the food was.

The food did not disappoint - this is some of the freshest, most delicious seafood I have ever tasted.  The light cornmeal batter on the shrimp and oysters was the perfect texture.  The tartar sauce that came with the seafood tasted light and fresh, more like a dressing than a heavy mayonnaise sauce.

Mother's offers some of the best breakfast food I've ever had. Hands down. Anywhere in the country.\\n\\nFirstly, the place has such funky decor. It's a weird fusion between classical and kitschy, with both a multitude of chandeliers and wonderful pictures hanging on the walls. I'm not sure if this is the feel that ownership was going for, but I dig it nonetheless. It's almost like it takes itself seriously without taking itself too seriously: a fine line between bourgeois and comedy. I'm not sure if anyone else gets this, but when you walk into Mother's, I'm sure you'll get the idea.\\n\\nMother's offers both regular and French-pressed roast. I really wanted the French press, but man, I was intimidated. I can't really speak as to why, but I put off getting it and kind of regret doing so now. I guess it appeals to me on a level that doesn't jive with my more caveman inclinations. However, the regular joe was very good, so I didn't commit a cardinal sin.\\n\\nMother's serves up both Mimosas and MANmosas. This was the first I ever heard of a manmosa, and I feel like my world got so much bigger. Instead of serving it in a little champagne flute, you get it in a pint glass. Again, this was an AMAZING discovery for someone like me who fears appearing too froufrou when order a mimosa.\\n\\nFor breakfast, I ordered the Grilled Portabella Mushroom Scramble. It was the absolute best way to start my day. Bar none. The mushrooms are marinated in garlic, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar, all of which work to give the dish an astounding amount of flavor. I mean, let's face it: eggs are eggs. They're never going to be overly flavorful; at least, you never really expect them to be. Well, these mushrooms totally shatter that convention. And the whole thing comes topped with Asiago cheese, which, in my opinion, is a totally under-utilized treat.\\n\\nA first rate breakfast from start to finish. And the staff was lovely and affable, quick to chat you up and never forgetting to smile. So much happiness.

I have no idea how to pronounce the restaurants name but the food makes me happy every time I am down in the ATL. I am from Texas and am not a connoisseur of anything except Tex Mex. \\n\\nFirst off, it does quality replications of my good ole Tex Mex favorites including the puff chile con queso which NO ONE north of Texarkana has heard of. Their salsas are solid and can get spicy. And their margaritas are terrific. \\n\\nI rate my Tex Mex spots for food on four factors. Below you will see them and my comments. Bottom line. Eat here now and get fat. \\n\\n1. Enchiladas - their cheese enchiladas are great and their sauce makes it just the right amount of spicy and that authentic after taste of cream. I ain't a writer either so just go with it. \\n\\n2.  Salsas - they bring fresh chips and they have queso straight outta Austin. And yes for my fellow Texans - they got the filling \\"fruit on the bottom\\" stuff at the bottom of the queso to mix through. Don't be a health snob and order the guac but if you must, it meets the standard. Tomato salsas are good too. Ask for the spicy if you can handle it. If they had a chuys like creamy jalape√±o sauce I would be in hog heaven. \\n\\n3.  Margaritas - the fact that I remember what I drank impresses me and should impress you. Ordered on the rocks no salt cuz I am a big boy and don't need a slushy brain freeze. Perhaps a little too tart but hell just ask em to make them less sweet. They also have shiner bock but I think I had that in a bottle and not draft. Points awarded for having shiner but a slightly less epic point total for not having it on draft. \\n\\n4. Fajitas - the flour tortillas are terrific and thick and just the right amount of doughy. For those that know HEB in Texas - imagine the fresh ones made by that old Mexican lady in the middle of the store. Filling (meat, veggies) were sizzling so extra points for authenticity. \\n\\nAll in all - I stopped this review to buy a plane ticket for later this winter from NYC to ATL to eat here. Why fly home all the way to Texas when you can go half way and eat the same? \\n\\nBalla place!

I was blown away by the delicately-cooked salmon (none of that white fatty stuff oozing out the top because some schmuck put it in a blast furnace), the completely attentive service, the wonderful wine pairing, and the homemade sorbet was some of the best I've ever had in my life. We were a big table paying well, so maybe that's why we got seated right away and had a great service experience, but I never saw any of the rudeness I've heard some people complain about.\\n\\nBut the real treat was my second trip: my one-year dating anniversary with my girlfriend. With a relatively short-notice reservation, we were given one of the best seats in the house with a great picture-window view. My braised short rib pot roast with demiglase was absolutely astounding to the point where I seriously considered picking up the plate and licking it before confirming with my companion that perhaps that wasn't the classiest idea I ever had. She had some sort of take on fried chicken which involved a breading that I could have sworn consisted of corn flakes, but either way, she loved it alongside a healthy portion of mac and cheese that she wanted thirds of. Again, both the wine and desserts were astounding, with a chocolate mouse of unbelievably smooth and creamy texture.\\n\\nBut really, the big show came when the very sweet tourist couple next to us turned out to be from Israel. We had a wonderful conversation with them -- they were on vacation for their own wedding anniversary, and thought it cute that we were there for our first for dating. The owner and chef herself (Mother?) came out and congratulated both couples, and kinda just kneeled down and asked us about our food, how we liked the place, and if there was anything she could bring us for a special treat. Despite our protests of being completely engorged with food, she brought out a creme brulee for each of us to share -- to die for. Then, while we were eating, she engaged the Israeli couple in a very passable (according to them) conversation in Hebrew, and really well -- made us feel like we were all at home -- at Mother's.\\n\\nIt was truly an unforgettable experience, well worth the crowds and the cost.

The lamb is so good at Mahoney's and their foux au jus whatever it is they use for the lamb is delicious with the pretzel bun it comes on.\\nThe chicken salad isn't easy to mess up, but is delicous.\\nTheir steak is always cooked perfectly- my friend ordered medium rare I ordered medium well and I don't think any restaurant has ever gotten it so right on to the cooking level that was ordered.\\nIf you want a sampler platter- they have the BEST all around platter- Mahoney's platter has: Calamari, Wings, Tenders, Parm Bread, Chips, and Ribs.

I got a carrot cake cupcake with coconut flakes on the frosting and my friend got a chocolate fudge cake.\\nWe decided to take it home with us and I'm not going to say that I may or may or may not have smoked something but we decided to eat our baked goods after doing so AND THEY WERE BANGIN'. I loved loved my cupcake, the only thing I could've lived without was the icing. Not my favorite icing.

The ceviche was bland and did not \\"pop\\" or taste fresh.  The steak in the tacos and fajitas was almost inedible. There was so much fat you almost wanted to spit it out because it was so chewy.

I ordered the beef brisket sandwich with a medium side if baked beans after waiting in the slow line for about 15 minutes. This came to $11 which seemed just slightly expensive for a simple sandwich and side from a food truck but nothing outrageous. The brisket was okay but somewhat dry and definitely needed some sauce. I wasn't a fan of the sweet sauce either- it had a cinnamon flavor that really overpowered the rest of the sauce and made it pretty mediocre overall. The bread was average as well. The baked beans, however, we're excellent with nice chunks of chopped pork through.

Saito, the sushi chef, was so accommodating...he came over to introduce himself, make recommendations, tell his life story...very adorable old Japanese man, but again, strange that he's not standing behind an old school sushi bar and instead strolling over amidst club music and and an ice bar.

They even seem to be making an effort to get as much of the line inside the store and organized in a fairly coherent way. If you go at a prime time (like weekends) or during busy weeks in the city, you will wait in a line, usually outside. It goes pretty quick but you'll be outside.

Yanagi, located at William Cannon west of  Mopac, is the perfect neighborhood spot for sushi aficionados   As I reviewed the Yanagi Happy Hour Menu., I learned that the restaurant's name Yanagi, refers to a type of sashimi knife.  The versatile Japanese knife,  ideal for everyday slicing, is the perfect  blade for slicing long pieces of fish.  On this rainy Friday evening,  I wanted a warming yet light meal.  I ordered hot sake, miso soup, and two six-piece Nigiri-sushi platters ($1.75 per piece).   Danny provided great wait-service and the chef presented  beautiful, fresh, proportioned, and succulent nigiri  morsels that exceeded my expectations.  \\n\\nThe flavors and textures of the Albacore, Escolar (my favorite), Sake (Salmon), Dai (Red Snapper), Suzuki (Sea Bass), Ebi  (Shrimp), Masago (Smelt Eggs),  and Seared Tuna nigiri were exceptional.  Another party at the sushi bar mentioned that their favorite after-dinner treat to order is the Panda Bear (it's not listed on the menu).  The chef carves a whole orange into the shape of a Panda. It is a whimsically, delightful dessert with juicy citrus slices that cleanse the palate and have just enough sweetness to satiate the appetite.  \\n\\nTo be able to order appetizers, sushi, rolls,  and drink specials from the daily 4-6 pm Happy Hour menu is a  fantastic way to be  introduced to the restaurant.  I am glad that I arrived early and could be seated at the sushi bar.

El Inka's food is just as good: absolutely outstanding, flavorful, and authentic. (My wife's been to Peru a few times and LOVES Peruvian food. She noted how authentic it was at El Inka). The moment I stepped out of the door I started to crave the food again. I guarantee El Inka will become a go-to restaurant for us. \\n\\nMy wife ordered a cilantro chicken soup with rice. It was thick, more a stew than a soup. And it was absolutely phenomenal. The cilantro flavors, the brown-meat chicken and the soft rice made for such a comfort food. I ordered the Arroz Mariscos (seafood and rice) in a spicy red sauce and OH MAN! So comforting, spiced just right, and the seafood seemed as if it were VERY fresh. It tasted as though it had never even been frozen. At at $9.99, it was a steal! \\n\\nThe family that owns and operates El Inka is very friendly and welcoming and the food is some of the best in the Portland Metro area. It's quite inconveniently located for Portland's foodie crowd. Not too many of them make it out to Gresham too often (and who could blame them?) But honestly Portland foodies: you HAVE to make the Peruvian Pilgrimage out here and try this food. \\n\\nSure Portland's other Peruvian restaurant, Andina (located in the Pearl), gets a lot of  press, and they do serve great food, but so does El Inka, at a fraction of the price! At Andina, you'll pay 2-3 times more for your Peruvian food, and frankly I don't know if you'll enjoy it any more than you would at El Inka (unless you're that snobbish that you need an exotic, high-end ambiance to accompany your dinner). El Inka, like 82nd Ave's Ha VL, is one of those small, hole-in-the-wall ethnic Ma-n-Pa's that despite its size and location have managed to catch the eye of Portland's vast and popular culinary scene.

We started with the Boar ribs, topped with a delicious spicy sauce and surrounded by a lovely thin layer of blue cheese dressing (ribs were a bit anemic, not much meat, but sauce was so good I'd have again).  We then had the wedge salad (more great blue cheese & bright red radishes) and the barbeque beef brisket (perfectly slow cooked, moist inside, but nice dark searing on top) with a side of Brussel Sprouts (saut√©ed with small pieces of pork belly), topped off with an affordable bottle of Malbec.   They put 3 bottles of different kinds of homemade spicy sauce on table, but I didn't try them.  We ended with homemade Walnut and Vanilla ice-cream.  Everything was excellent.  Wine list, very reasonable (we even found a good Oregon Pinot).  And upstairs area is a bonus, cool bar area where they appear to have live music nightly.  I highly recommend it.\\n\\nOne final note; come on Austin people, you need to step up your Yelp reviews!

Well its an Italian pastry with a ricotta filling and an exterior resembling leaves stacked on each other - similar to a cannoli but with a way more awesome shell! And a lobster tail is a sfogliatelle but instead of the ricotta filling, there is a French cream, similar to that of a whipped cream... who knew?!\\n\\nWell the lobster tail blew me away... the whipped cream center was sweet but not so much you wanted to gag, it was nice and light, and overall really addicting. The shell provided a nice contrast to nice fluffy center and it was overall a really nice treat.

They opened up their options for bento boxes, now including a sushi and a sashimi one but it's a shame since I only ever go there for dinner. Another con is that the service is so hit and miss. It used to be a lot worse, partially due to the protocols of the restaurant previously and they've done a lot to improve it but you seem to either get a phenomenal waiter or waitress that checks on you every 10 minutes or you get one that won't refill your drinks once during a two-and-a-half-hour meal."},{"name":"India Imports","address":"2079 Nw Aloclek Dr","city":"Hillsboro","stars":"3.5","text":"This little Indian grocery store is a hidden away in an office park, with signs pointing toward its location from the main street.

My Spike in Chatter kept me smiling most of the night; it was a lovely, balanced concoction with piquant pineapple notes, creamy texture from egg whites, and brought together by bitters ice cubes.  My companions' drinks featured different spirits but both were also well-balanced and just delicious (one was the Maiden Oregon, a tongue-in-cheek name that stuck with me).\\n\\nCentral serves food as well but this visit was all about the cocktails.

This place is so tiny that there isn't really anywhere to \\"disappear\\" to, so they would stand in the little doorway to the kitchen and stare at you defiantly as you tried to wave them down. Sometimes there would be not a single other customer in the place. Still, they would stare at you as you made meaningful eye contact and started to wonder if you were invisible. They were all skinny and European and dressed in black and seemed to be on drugs (some were visibly shaking). Sure, the food and drinks were good, but this was the most entertaining part of coming to Cafe Pamplona.\\n\\nThese days, it is more of your average European cafe plunked down in the middle of Harvard Square...which still makes it pretty great. There is never more than one server working at a time, so service can be slow when the cafe is busy, but it isn't on purpose anymore, so that sort of takes the fun out of it.\\n\\nStill, you should come here for the unique architecture (low ceiling) and the sidewalk tables in the summer (good people watching). Come here for the food: Spanish cuisine with liberal use of avocado. The avocado/black bean salad is great. The sopa de ajo is wonderful for a cold winter day; the gazpacho (red or white--with peaches!) for a chilly summer treat. Try one of the regular sandwiches (ham and cheese or cheese and guava paste) or try one of the specials (usually panini on grilled focaccia...yum). Beats a sandwich at Panera or even Cafe Crema (and that's saying something). The hummus plate and tortilla espanola are also good. Afterwards, savor your espresso as you listen to people at other tables speaking loudly (or yelling into their cell phones) in languages other than English.

We stood at door waiting for approximately 10 minutes as many staff members came in and out of hostess stand with no gestures of hi or welcome, nothing.  The hostess finally showed up to sit the couple who had drinks in front of us who were moving from bar to a table.  She looked at us but no smile no hi I'll be with you next, she just rushed along.  When she returns she made no eye contact with us and went straight to her hostess computer.  She finally looks up and says can I help you? Well Yes please table for two.

We say there for another 5 minutes.  We asked server was was popular and did they have specials? He said no specials just their regular menu.  I explained it was our first visit and would he recommend anything.  He rambled off several things but we couldn't hear as the noise around us got really loud plus he talked too fast as he was in a hurry.  Once we ordered we got our awesome Chicken Tacos Carbon we shared super fast.  The chicken was tender, the soft tortillas were just perfect and their salsas, rice and beans were all perfect!!!!  Then he came and retrieved out plates and I asked if we could see a dessert menu but he says oh I'm sorry the kitchen has already closed.  I said okay we will try something next time.  We waited for ten minutes for the bill and I finally had to stand up and ask him for the check.   Considering he cleared our plates and kitchen was closed I would have thought he would have dropped the check sooner.   I will say there were others who delivered the food, a drink and the staff who politely said good night and thanks for coming were on their A game.

Deep fried, they were in no way oily. The green chili queso, while doesn't displace Torchy's as king-of-queso, it was  smooth, creamy and unique-tasting with the mild roasted flavor of green chilies. The Achiote seared chick peas and goat cheese were also very flavorful. If you have a vegetarian with you, you can ask them to put the cheese on the side since it came on top. We thought it would be mixed throughout so if we'd known we'd would have preferred it on the side. \\n\\nAll that's well and good. But this is a BBQ place, so on to the main course: Whole Black Angus Short Rib. I'll cut to the chase. THIS WAS THE BEST BBQ RIB I'VE EVER TASTED. Hands down. Tender, charred to perfection, full of flavor and marbled. I couldn't have asked for a more perfect cut or better preparation. \\n\\nThe only reason I'm giving 4 stars versus 5 is the value factor. This isn't cheap. And, while the food is top notch it's not as accessible as frequently as I'd like to eat it! \\n\\nWe see a lot of trailer establishments that have moved to brick and mortar upon success (Franklin's BBQ comes to mind as the most prominent example).

It had a real banana flavor without any of the chemical taste that commercial banana pudding is known for. I can't think of a single complaint about the food, and as the space offers communal seating, I was able to hear the unanimous praise from the patrons that were seated around me. Perhaps coolest of all, the owner made sure to walk around and talk to everyone during their meal. To me, this demonstrated his passion for his food and for delivering an excellent experience to his customers. This place is quickly becoming a Columbus staple and deservedly so!

The carnitas tastes like carnitas; the green chile is surprisingly tasty; the chicken mole is delicious even if it doesn't taste like actual mole.  The steak option is bland and slightly stinky, but I avoid that.  Fried potatoes are seasoned well and crispy. Guacamole is padded out with sour cream and severely subpar.  Salsas tend to be good; the green house hot sauce is tasty and the tomatillo salsa is a good pairing with carnitas.   Beans are strictly average; no refried beans, only whole pinto or black beans.  The tortillas are not exceptional, but interesting options like whole wheat and tomato are available.   \\n\\nThe finished product is generally good.  When I want a burrito, it hits the spot.  My fave is a carnitas burrito with potatoes, pintos, no rice, tomatillo salsa and house green hot sauce.  The prices are lower than the competition, but it's obvious where costs have been cut. \\n\\nService is mixed. The burritistas don't stare at you uncomprehendingly when you say you don't want rice, and actually offer extra beans in compensation without being asked first.

Fortunately so, as I found the place to be pretty mediocre. \\n\\nThe high point was the ability to order original or whole wheat dough and crust styles ranging from extra thin (NY City style) to extra thick (Sicilian style). They also offer extra sauce, Italian seasoning and fresh garlic on request. In the Create Your Own section of the menu you can even order vegy/soy-sation cheese. \\n\\nI was expecting to be able to purchase a slice of pie so was a bit daunted to find that they only sell whole pizzas - at least for dinner.  The smallest pizza is a 12\\" with an average price of $14 so I decided on a Calzone. \\n\\nI went with the regular version filled with pastrami, onions, mushrooms and black olives. At just $5.75 I thought the price was perfect. The fact that I took half of it home was even better. It did take 25 minutes for my food to be announced as ready but I was told this from the outset so I really can't complain about that. The flavor was great, the whole wheat crust nice and chewy, and I thought the amount of filling just about right. While waiting, I was able to watch the two cooks flinging dough in the air and stretching it out to the right dimensions...always a highlight when in a pizzeria.\\n\\nI also checked out the salad bar....not so good. I've seen better salad bars at my nephew's grade school. And at $4.50 for one time through, not a good value at all. The description in the menu says, \\"a fantastic selection of over 18 fresh items with all your favorite dressings.\\" 18 items??? That's nothing really, considering that five or six of those are probably dressing.\\n\\nThey have several micros on tap and a couple of domestics. Not a huge selection and the prices in line with most any other pizza place. The only drawback was my waitress was just 16 so after taking my food order, she had to call someone over to ring in the beer. And then call someone else over to actually pour the beer. The entire order took about 10 minutes.\\n\\nThere weren't too many patrons in house, but I noted that about half the people coming through the door were picking up pre-ordered pizzas.

Having been tired from walking so far, we decided to find somewhere nice to sit down and have a cup of coffee or tea. And that is when we caught a glimpse of a sign for \\"Cafe Intermezzo\\". \\n\\n we arrived at intermezzo on Wednesday, May 02, 2010 (8:20 pm):\\n\\n     A friend of mine had been here before and she recommended it so many times. She said the crepes were delicious and the desserts were amazing. So i figured i would give it a shot.\\n\\n     When we first walked in, we were greeted very politely by a hostess who looked very happy to guide us to our table when we. We reviewed over the menu briefly and our waitress was back within a few minutes for our drink orders. She asked if we knew what we wanted to eat, but my brother had gotten up to view the dessert cabinet. So we told her it would be a minute, and i got up to see it for myself.\\n\\n     They had a moderate selection of cakes and desserts and they all looked delicious. But after looking over everything, i decided that i did not want a cake. I wanted one of those crepes i had heard so much about. So we sat back down and we ordered our food.\\n\\n     For our drinks, I ordered the Egyptian chamomile tea. It arrived in a french tea press in which we could pour ourselves, and i thought that was pretty cool. After waiting a minute for the tea to brew in the press, i poured myself a cup. It smelled very floral and very sweet, and it tasted amazing.\\n\\n     The other person in our party ordered the a tea with berry in the name, in which i forgot. He seemed to enjoy it, and said it tasted like a blackberry or pomegranate tea, though there was something different about it.\\n\\n     My little brother ordered some sort of hot chocolate that had three types of chocolate in it and nutella! It came in a mammoth glass and he drank it down with joy.\\n\\n     For our food, my brother ordered the Caribbean coconut torte. It came out as a slice of cake that he enjoyed very much. It had a thin layer of coconut icing on it and then another layer of shaved coconut. It was served with a large dollop of whip cream and he loved it. He said it tasted like a coconut cream pie, with the texture of cake.\\n\\n     I ordered the banana-nutella crepe. I was not too impressed with it, as the texture of the crepe was very rubbery. The presentation was nice as it had nutella drizzled over it and two banana slices on top, but it tasted as though it was just thrown in the microwave. \\n\\n     I do not like giving bad reviews, and for the most part this restaurant was amazing. I understand it is hard to make crepes at an airport, so i gave this place three stars. They made an amazing cup of tea, and this place had a great environment. Next time, i will have to try the cafe intermezzos in midtown so i can get the full experience.\\n\\n     So all in all, the teas and hot chocolate are worth it. I just would not recommend the sweet crepes ^_^.\\n\\n-Andrew D. Morrison-"},{"name":"LongHorn Steakhouse","address":"3118 Daniels Rd","city":"Winter Garden","stars":"3","text":"I love coming here.

My honey would like to think otherwise, but that's my story and I'm sticking to it. In fact, there wasn't a single beer that I felt I wanted to try again. I believe this was my least favorite brewery in Portland out of the 10 or so that we visited. \\n\\nThey are probably a two star brewery for their beer and the service. However I'm giving them an extra star for serving a Tofurky brat. I didn't know until afterwards it's an Oregon law that if you serve alcohol, you must serve food and non-alcoholic beverages as well. It's a pretty reasonable law as far as nanny laws go. However, there's no law saying you must serve Vegan food (although I feel there probably should be in Portland). The fact that Amnesia is looking out for us, earns them an extra star. Although it's not all that great with the cold bun, warmed kraut, and so so fries. It still beats eating air.\\n\\nThey do have a nice, large outdoor patio area for enjoying your beer when the weather is nice.

We stuffed our faces and each had enough for lunch the next day.  Both dishes (saag paneer and navratan korma) were very flavorful and rich.  My only concern is that the dishes might be super fatty.  I am definitely going to be ordering from here again and will try something a little lighter to compare."},{"name":"Boston Lobster Feast","address":"8731 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"I checked this place couple months ago during my business trip to Orlando.

It was okay, but then we realized it was completely watered down, and we could barely taste the alcohol! We also ordered apps, however when we were done with the poorly made nachos, the server cleared our plates but DIDN'T ask if we wanted another round of drinks (because clearly between the 3 of us, the pitcher was already low), or another app! \\n\\nThat was the LAST we had heard from her. Mind you, it wasn't even busy outside or inside. We were going to order a $32 bottle of Proceso to keep our buzz going, but nearly 5 minutes after we lost our buzz thanks to the watered mojitos and poor service. We decided to just pay the bill and go somewhere else where we were appreciated as a customer. Well.... ummm...if you can find even a server to get your check and get you the hell out of there, GOOD LUCK. We noticed that a different server as the two girls next to us if  they were all set and THEY got the check. (Later on my sister told me even those girls were looking to  get another round but had enough when they were neglected as well.) Mind you, these girls came in AFTER us! The new waitress brought them their check and returned it promptly.\\n\\nThen the new waitress proceeded to walk past our table as if we didn't exist. So after having enough and waiting 25 minutes, I asked the waitress to get our check, that took another 15 minutes. Finally we gave the cards and cash to her. After what seemed to be 45 minutes, our check to settle up and get our cards back were NO WHERE to be found. We spotted her at the front entrance with the bouncers FLIRTING up a storm. Comeon sweetheart, you have our money all we want to go is get the heck out of here. Furiously, I waved her over and said we had been waiting for our cards to come back. With an unapologetic tone, she said \\"oh sorry I passed it on to your original server, I thought she took care of it let me go get it\\". Wait, didn't you JUST take care of the two girls at the table next to us, who happened to have the same original waitress, with no problem??\\n\\nWhen we finally got the check, we tipped $2 on our overpriced $70 bill. Comeon, you could have pocketed a bottle of wine, AND a better tip. Usually I understand if it's busy and you come over to our table and apologize, but no ever did that. We didn't even get an appetizer comped for our TERRIBLE service. We will definitely NOT be going back, since the poor service and \\"eh\\" drinks left our night a little sour.

Not too much different than the ones at Modern.  \\n\\nHowever, I should note that the ones at Modern hold up better in storage than Mike's by a few days as the pastry crust gets soggy much faster.

The little girl (and by little girl I mean she couldn't have been twelve years old) that was serving us should have been out playing with her friends and enjoying her childhood not serving strangers in her father's restaurant. This really is my greatest complaint... and probably some violation of child labor laws.\\n***Amended: My apologies for suggesting that the little girl isn't enjoying her childhood, she could be very happy for all I know. The other issues we had with this establishment were NOT the little girl's fault; she was extremely attentive and very polite.\\n***Amended again: to be clear, this is a restaurant review and not commentary on anyone's parenting. But I do still hold to the premiss that childhood is precious and the hope that this little girl is enjoying hers.\\n...

When you give up on your tomato juice, aka Bloody Mary, and order a shot of rum to throw in your coffee you're given a shot of some South African liqueur instead without being told of the substitution. \\n\\n4. Soooooooo slooooooow! No exaggeration, it took more than twenty-five minutes to see our coffee after ordering, and sadly not enough coffee was actually made to allow everyone in our party of six a cup... guess some of us will just have wait another twenty minutes. \\n\\n5. After twice being told the food was being plated and waiting another ten minutes, plates slowly started trickling out and even then not all the plates were brought out at once. Getting back the the whole soooooooo slooooooow thing; the first plate was brought to the table 50 minutes after ordering and the last plate was brought out more than an hour and a half after ordering.

I figured if their knots were that good, the pizza probably was as well. A woman covered in food tattoos (ice cream, cup of noodles, etc) took my order; definitely a one of a kind experience. I decided to order a roni pizza to go with the knots. The garlic knots are quite good, I have to admit, although they make a killing on the profit on those when you think about it. $8 for 5 of them, and they're pretty much just dough (a few cents), melted butter, garlic, and herbs/seasonings. The pizza was small. If I had just ordered pizza alone for the two of us, we would have definitely been hungry after. It doesn't seem right to pay that much for a pizza that is just barely more than enough for one person. On top of that, the sauce on the pizza was quite minimal, and there really was nothing special about the taste to make me feel that it was worth paying more for. They really need to have more than just one size of pizza. I can't base my review of this place simply on how good the garlic knots are, so when I factor in the size and taste of the pizza, I have to average this out to a three star."},{"name":"Masala Dhaba","address":"75 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Thank god for this alternative to Graj Mahal.

When you pull in, don't judge a book by it's cover, ok? It's in a little strip mall off Morse Road that has seen better days. But this place is a gem. The people who work here are so nice and friendly and the food is always wonderful. Tonight, we tried a few new things we had never had. We ordered coffee for the first time, which was unlike any other. They bring it out and it's still brewing. The coffee brews directly into your cup and the bottom of the cup had sweetened condensed milk in it. When the coffee is done, you mix it together and it was AH-MAH-ZING. If my blood sugar wouldn't skyrocket, I would drink it this way everyday. We also tried the #8 appetizer (and you'll have to forgive me because I don't remember the name of it). It was dumplings filled with spiced pork and shrimp and came with a dipping sauce and was topped with fried onions and green onions. They were quite tasty. I've had the spring rolls here as well and they are delicious. For my main meal, I always go with pho #24, which is the rare steak and meatball. The broth here is really what sets it apart. It's not greasy or super heavy and just has a lot of flavor. My boyfriend tried a new dish, which was a chicken broth based dish with noodles, quail egg, heart, pork, beef, and shrimp, and the kitchen sink. It also had this garlic in it that was so, so good. Almost like roasted garlic flavor, very mild and wonderful. We literally live less than 5 minutes from here now, so I can't wait to eat my way through the menu. OH! And I almost forgot the best part.

It is very open and clean, colorful, a lot of nice buddhist decorations. \\n\\nMy husband and I decided to get lunch buffet. It's a pretty good price, about $9 per person. One thing I noticed right away was that we got to choose between white and brown rice, and I like that because brown rice is healthier. I got daal, chaana, pakora, and chicken tikka masala. Chicken tikka masala is my absolute favorite kind of Indian food. There was something wrong with this one though. It was not even the right color sauce and had been made with tandoori chicken instead of white meat. Tandoori chicken is bright red color and grilled with the tandoor. If I wanted tandoori chicken i would have put that on my plate. It was like they used the left over tandoori chicken to make a new dish. Aside from that, masala sauce is supposed to be tomato based. This sauce was yellow, and didn't taste like masala sauce at all. \\n\\nI got naan as well and it was plain and was not cooked correctly. Usually I love the naan but this was still very doughy , not puffed with air by the flames in the tandoor. \\n\\nAll of the food we got was bland, tasteless and we were both really let down by it. My husband is from Nepal and knows a lot about what is good and what is not. He was completely unappetized by it and could not finish eating. He said it is the worst he's every had. All of it tasted the same even though there was a lot of different things to choose from. The kheer was not that good either. It was very thick, did not have much cream or spices at all. We did try the kulfi, which is like icecream, and not available at a lot of other places. It is very good actually and I am glad that we got something with some flavor.\\n\\nAll in all I do not recommend this place for people who want tasty food.

You'd barely know it was there if someone didn't point it out.\\n\\nThe problems...\\n\\nThe service was pretty weak for a time when the restaurant was virtually empty. The woman serving us was kind of bitchy. It took us a while for us to get our drink orders, then a while to get our food order taken. Whatever, it happens. But then my wife and friend (who both ordered the gyoza) took forever to get their food. \\n\\nMost people's food came around the same time. I held off eating for a bit before thinking their's would arrive soon. It didn't so I finished off the salad. Still didn't come, so I shared some of my sandwich with my wife. Still didn't come. My food is finished along with most everyone else's. My friend asks the server where his is and she gives him attitude about going to check it.\\n\\nShe comes out with his plate finally. He proceeds to finish his and it's still about another 10-15 minutes before her's comes out. She gives an explanation about how it's takes longer to cook. Using my wife's as a comparison it looks like the first order was burnt but they just brought it out because my friend complained. When all was said and done, the gyoza wasn't even that good. Apparently it was super heavy on the salty soya sauce.\\n\\nSo we ask for the bill and there is a 17% gratuity added to it for the party. My wife (less inclined to let it slide) was polite about saying she thought the 17% was a little much given she waited about 45 minutes to an 1 hour for her meal. The server conjured up the bitchy attitude again. In response to the comment about how long the food took, she said \\"she could go check when it was ordered\\", like we were trying to lie to her about it. \\n\\nThe other people's food had come, been eaten and the empty plates removed before she got her meal. My wife WAS polite about it, she said she'd still tip but just didn't think 17% was justified. Again, with more bitchy attitude the server said she'd just go take the tip off and we could tip what we want, or not at all. Overall, kind of a surreal service experience. No \\"sorry for the wait\\", just excuses and snippy attitude. \\n\\nSlow kitchen and snarky server mean we won't be going back.

The dessert was on the odd side (a mason jar full of different colored, layered almond pudding). The peach sauce on top was a bit cloying, but the pudding was well set and not grainy.\\n\\nMy main complaint is the waitress, a bespectacled hapa girl who looked like she had some submerged anger that was on the verge of spilling over into a dramatic scene. She got my order wrong--more specifically, she forgot my order--and I was sitting around for 20 minutes watching my dining partners enjoy their food as I chattered and pretended not to look at their repast, salivating like a macaque monkey in a briskly populated tourist zone. It was only until my dining companion asked about my meal that another waiter looked into my order and noticing the error, placed it. That girl said sorry in a kind of \\"meta\\" way: \\"I am sorry the order was missed and you had to wait so long.\\" I have moth's feelers for fake apologies, gurl. If you paid more attention to orders instead of stalking around looking like you want to stab someone, you'd get more points!\\n\\nThey gave me a 50% discount on it, but I had to eat fast and furiously to catch up with my dining partners and spent the day in a gaseous state. I would go back, but I am going to kick up a fuss the next time this happens.

For example, the barramundi fish sandwich previously use to say selected fresh from the market daily, when in reality, it was individually packaged in little plastic bags. Certain placements of the word organic makes whole meals appear organic, when in reality, only one ingredient may be organic. The veggie burgers don't have just 3 ingredients, like the current menu would lead you believe. In reality there is 12 different ingredients, just in the burger. Having worked for the company before, it's kinda sad to see its integrity for perfection slowly slide. However, when I worked there we had a lot of employees who went to culinary school, but I know nearly all have moved on to different culinary ventures. Over the past few years, I have been very disappointed every time I decide to get a meal there. Messy food preparation, like ripped burritos or sloppily cut vegetables. Things that when I worked there in the early 2010s would have caused a remake of the entire meal.

We were the only ones there and no one else came after. The waitress was terrible to the point she actually spilled a glass of wine on me. The food was horrid... Tacos dry, chicken nuggets overdone, a Cuban that was just awful, jerk chicken that tasted like just water and to top it off they charged .50 cents for Parmesan cheese when you order a pasta dish...WTF? When we got the bill the waitress took nothing off. Finally the Owner came over and apologized for the service...

As a full time state employee and college student, I found Kick Butt to suite my needs to study during my lunch hour while having a quick bite.  Zsa Zsa makes the best coffees and has a very warm and friendly personality.  I decided to drop in one evening to order an Americano.  I wasn't in a huge hurry carrying on a casual conversation on my cell phone.  There were probably two other people in the establishment plus who I now know to be the assistant manager.  She literally ignored me the whole time, especially as  I stood at the counter while on my cell waiting to have my order taken.  After about 30 seconds or so, I pulled my phone away from my ear and politely asked if someone was available to take my order.  The employee walked over to the first registered and rudely flipped up a piece of paper in the air which was taped to the register.  \\"You can't be on your cellphone when you place an order\\" she replied.  I asked the person on the other end to wait a moment.  I placed my order and nicely asked if it was okay for me to resume my conversation.  The employee glared at me and started my order.  Shortly after she slid my cup on the counter and plopped down a carton of creamer.  Assuming that she was upset, I offered an apology if I was rude in someway, as it was never my intent, she said nothing as I walked away.  \\n\\nI was somewhat concerned, I'd never had an experience such as this during the daytime, so I decided it would be best to address my concerns with the owner Tom.  A week passed and I had made arrangements to meet classmates for a brief study session over coffee.  A huge burly guy named Dan was behind the counter, hoping that perhaps Tom was there I asked Dan if he was the only one in the coffee shop.  He told me no other employees were there, and inquired as to curiousity.  I informed him that I had an unsavory experience about a week prior and before I could say anything else, he cut me off to let me know he was aware of the situation.  He mentioned that he infact saw me via an app on his phone being rude to his assistant manager and wouldn't really let me get a word in otherwise.  Finally I conceded to discussing the matter with Tom since I was getting anywhere with definante Dan who really needs a lesson in handling customer complaints.\\n\\nThe next day I came returned for lunch and to go over some notes.  As usual I was met by a smiling, charming young lady who took my order.  I asked if Tom was available and she informed me that he was in a meeting.  During the course of the near hour that I was there, I asked several more times and received the same answer.  Finally I asked the young lady if there was a number available where I could contact Tom, and she became extremely nervious and defensive.  Tom is a very busy guy and he really doesn't engage the public she said.  This wasn't true, Tom and I had exchanged plesantries on numerous occassions while I was in his establishment.  Finally I offered to leave my phone number for Tom to contact me and after jotting it down on a piece of paper provided, the young lady behind the counter wanted to know if she could provide a reason for Tom to contact me.  I declined but wrote down the names of a mutual friend who's son is a student at his studio down the street.  \\n\\nIt has been more than 24 hours and wouldn't you know it Tom has not called.  I'm pretty certain I won't hear from him which is ashamed.

In fact, we didn't really feel like going outside the house, either. My first thought was to see if I had hung onto any of those menus the Chinese places leave on your door, and to get something delivered. The problem was - aside from the fact that I'm usually disappointed with Chinese food - it was almost nine pm, and the couple of places I called were no longer delivering (despite being open until at least 9:30).\\n\\nOkay, so at that point I had given up on having food delivered, and figured I was going to have to bite the bullet and venture out for some take-out. With Asian still on my mind, I thought about Shogun at Slaughter and Manchaca, but their lack of web presence combined with my lack of menu ruled it out. Then, I remembered Yanagi.\\n\\nI had dined-in twice before, and thought the sushi was pretty damn good. All of the nigiri I had tried was fresh and tasty, and same went for the rolls, of which there is a large selection (BTW - for those who've said they don't have write-on sushi menus, they do - just ask).  So I pulled up their website, saw that they're open until 10 pm, browsed the menu, called up and placed an order. A couple of miso soups, vegetable yakisoba and \\"special combination\\" (sushi). I pulled up 15 minutes later, just as my food was ready to go, paid more than I would have liked to for take-out (~$45 with tip), and was on my merry way.\\n\\nThere's something nice about eating good, fresh sushi in the comfort of your home. Especially when you've got cold saki in the fridge. Kinda feels like you're getting away with something. Unlike eating sushi from Whole Foods, Central Market or HEB, when it feels like THEY'RE getting away with something. The combo was 8 tasty pieces of nigiri, accompanied by a Dragon Roll (you choose from 6 rolls), which was also delicious. Miso soup was spot on, and the Yakisoba, (although overpriced and under-portioned at $10.95, IMO) was really good and a perfect compliment. \\n\\nThe bottom line was that the meal was quite satisfying, and while it was at least $20 more than I would have spent for delivery of Chinese, it was way better than being disappointed while chewing on gristle-y orange chicken and greasy vegetables, and was exactly what we needed/wanted.\\n\\nA couple of notes -  the staff and owners are friendly, they've got a nice happy hour (including noon-4 on Saturdays, which does not suck), lunch specials and a full bar. Get in there and give it a try...I really hope Yanagi sticks around, because what they're offering was sorely needed around these parts."},{"name":"Clover Food Lab","address":"100 Burlington Mall Rd","city":"Burlington","stars":"4.5","text":"My coworker and I come here for breakfast and lunch at least 3 times a week.

One of them told me about a really nice restaurant that I had to visit while traveling there.  We looked this restaurant up on YELP, of course.  The reviews and photos were pretty good; however, my experience was not that great. Driving up to the restaurant was so exciting because it was a beautiful scene.  They have ample parking.  It looks like a mini city mall, but all spruced up and nice.  We visited at about 6:30 p.m. on Thursday 6/29/17.  The hostess walked us upstairs to where we would be seated.  We sat indoors because it was too hot and humid to sit outside; however, they do have fans and water misters handing from the ceilings.  We received chips and salsa pretty fast. A very nice gentlemen by the name of \\"Chris\\" served us.  It took forever for anyone to come to our table and serve us.  We ordered the queso because it look fabulous on YELP.  IT was really good.  So, bad thing here was when they finally brought the queso out, we had eaten the chips and needed more chips with the queso. There were some servers that passed by, but they never looked our way. They only focused on who they were tending too.  We waited and waited.  I got up out of my seat and went to look for someone. I found the hostess that sat us and I told her how my frozen drink came out watery, we needed more chips, and now the queso was cold.  She found the waiter and he came over and took the item back.  They prepared another drink for me and this time it WAS frozen.  YAY, I'm happy now, but the queso didn't come out.  We did finally order our food and that took forever.  My daughter didn't like the pull pork sliders. She said the bread tasted weird.  The server got lost again. UGH.  We had to find someone else to ask to replace the item.  They took it back and was very cordial about it.  My burger with the pretzel bun was really good. I would definitely order again, but I won't be going back to this restaurant any time soon.  They lacked customer service...BIG TIME.  It was a slow day so I'm unsure as to why the service was so horrible.  Oasis, you have a good restaurant and you really need to fix this problem, because I know you get much busier and I'm unsure how you handle this if we were treated this way.  Oh yeah, it's very pricey.  My burger was 16.95 because I asked for a pretzel bun instead of the regular bun so they up-charged me $2+. The server said they could substitute the bun, but he didn't say there would be an up-charge.  \\nThe ambiance is very nice.  The view is phenomenal.  If you want to experience the atmosphere than this is a perfect tourist attraction.  Our suggestion is to order a few drinks, eat chips and salsa, & take pictures at sunset.

Now, I'm a skeptic in a city that is more susceptible to hype than one can imagine. Hype on HCT is through the roof. Easily one of the most hyped places in the city, and I was kind of excited about being more objective.\\n\\nHype #1: The chicken is hot. Hype met, exceeded. I heard the regulars saying they thought it was hotter than usual, which makes sense since I was making trips to the water cooler to cool my mouth and I only ordered Warm.\\n\\nHype #2: The owners are also hot. Hype met. Guess I'll leave that one alone...\\n\\nHype #3: The chicken is juicy. Hype definitely met. But for me it was the skin, it was super crispy. I don't even know how they do this. I just wanted to eat more chicken skin. \\n\\nHype #4: The sweet tea... hype met. It's not crazy sweet, which is nice, and it's bottomless, just like the house made ranch. \\n\\nHype #5: The service is amazing. Hype met, they're really nice folks! Joe stopped to ask how things were, we discussed my tolerance of the heat, etc. But by far the most important measure of service was this: I arrived 15 minutes prior to 12, expecting a line waiting for them to open. There wasn't one, because they had started serving people already! That's the mark of a passionate group of people: opening for people when they get there, and not when the clock says they should open. \\n\\nBread: no one hypes the bread, probably because there's no way to hype plain, white, untoasted, unbuttered, thin-sliced bread from a bag.\\n\\nThe least-hyped aspect of HCT is the price. I paid $16 and change, which left me wondering... what am I paying for? It's 58¬∞ out, and I paid $16 for a breezy seat under a tent to eat Chicken, Mac and Cheese, Cole Slaw, and Pudding? Hmm... If the entr√©es came in under $10, or if they were served in an actual dining room on actual plates, I'd probably be going back pretty regularly. But I couldn't help but feeling like I was paying a premium for hype. \\n\\nIt's an enjoyable, if a surprisingly expensive, lunch. It's unique, and I guess that's why it get's people excited."},{"name":"Old Cuban Cafe","address":"1672 N Goldenrod Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Amazing!!!

Cheap duds at around $8.95, but still duds.\\n\\nRoti Canai ($2.50 for 1 piece, $4.50 for 2 pieces)\\n-I thought this was a really, really, decent roti canai. Very tender and light on the inside, nicely flaky on the outside, and definitely made fresh to order as it can come out piping hot.\\n-The curry, unfortunately, wasn't as flavourful as some other places. It looks like very little curry, but for dipping, it's enough.\\n-Their \\"two pieces\\" isn't quite as large as other places like Banana Leaf or Kaya Malay Bistro, but they charge $7 and here it's only $4.50.\\n-Kinda torn about recommending it since the curry isn't as good, but the roti itself is very nice.\\n\\nK.K. Buttermilk Tiger Prawns ($14.99)\\n-The Malaysians among us are pretty sure \\"K.K.\\" means Kota Kinabalu.\\n-OMG this was sooooo good. The sauce is so rich and flavourful and tasty.\\n-We asked for spicy. And it was spicy. But not in a way that flattened the other flavours. You can still taste the sweetness and richness of the sauce.\\n-You can make a pretty big meal of this by also ordering rice or vermicelli (the latter being $2 for a heaping bowl) and mixing in SOME with the generous amount of sauce. Use only SOME because otherwise it becomes too diluted when spread over too much rice/noodle. You really want to preserve that rich, and excellent flavour.\\n--TIP: 1 order + 1 order of rice, shared by two people = two $8.50 dinners!\\n-I found the prawns fried enough that I could eat the whole thing, shell included.\\n\\nOther orders at the table included Laksa and Nasi Lemak.\\nThe persons who ordered the Laksa felt the curry was too thin. The Nasi Lemak was terribly boring but only $8.95, so you could look at it as a budget meal for under $10. Also, extra sauce for the Nasi Lemak is $1.50.\\n\\nThey offer water and tea.

It was a very liquid/drinkable milkshake once you got down under the toppings to the actual shake. I had the Dulce de Leche, and my friend had the Chocolate 5X. The chocolate was soooo decadent that it was hard to eat too much. I really liked both of them. The decor of the restaurant was very cool with lots of copper piping everywhere. It was also fun to sit and watch the other flavors of shake being served around. They are very visually appealing, towering above their plastic mason jars.

Let me start by saying that I only eat chicken (no red meat and no pork) and the occasional bacon (which I refer to as breakfast chicken), so when I heard about HCT I knew I had to give it a try.  My first trip was in late April.  I was in heaven.  I've been dreaming of my return ever since and got my chance today.  The chicken is fantastic, but in my opinion, the real stars of the show are the side dishes.  I'm lactose intolerant, but who cares?!  The mac and cheese is so good that I will risk a tummy ache just to enjoy it.  And the slaw!!!!  OMG!  It is THE perfect compliment to the hot chicken.  Finally, there is the sweet tea.  It is the closest I've had to Louisiana sweet tea \\"up north.\\"  As for the chicken, it is so juicy.  I'm always tempted to suck on the bones.  I've gotten \\"hot\\" white meat on the bone both times.  My husband enjoyed the boneless chicken breast (hot) in April and the sandwich today.  \\n\\nI was worried that since you no longer pay ahead and choose your hour for pick up that the line today would be unacceptable.  Going at 3:00, however, allowed us to enjoy a late lunch and zero line.  Going that late is a gamble since there is a chance your favorite will be sold out.  Following HCT on Facebook will allow you to keep track of the meals remaining throughout the day.  \\n\\nI would be remiss not to mention how super friendly Joe and his wife are.  Joe came over to check on us 3 times today to ensure we were enjoying our meal.  Quite possibly the best service in Columbus.  Keep in mind that you are eating outside on picnic tables so this could detract from the experience when the temperatures rise above 80 degrees.  We'll have to cross that bridge when we come to it.\\n\\nLong story, short, GO!!  Plan your weekends around HTC.

I tried it again today for the first time in more than a decade, thinking that perhaps it had improved.  My kids and I walked in shortly after noon on a Saturday, after a visit to Drumlin Farm, hoping to grab a quick lunch.  The place was completely empty except for one guy sitting at the bar.  Should have been our tip-off.  Still zero ambience, but it looked clean and it was air conditioned and they had a kids' menu, so I figured it would be fine for lunch.\\n\\nWe ordered about the simplest items imaginable: a Caprese salad plus a hot dog and cheese ravioli from the kids menu.  Then we waited, and waited, and waited.  I could hear the waitress in the bar chatting with the one customer - she didn't once come in to check on us, apologize, offer us a refill on our drinks, etc.  After about 25 minutes I went into the bar to find out what was happening.  She said that the cook had to heat everything up so it was taking longer than usual.  OK, fine.   After half an hour the food finally showed up.  The hot dog was fine.  The \\"cheese\\" ravioli was brown inside - clearly not cheese.  I asked her what kind of ravioli it was - she said she didn't know and whisked the plate away, back to the kitchen.  At this point we didn't have the time to wait for a new meal - I really just wanted to know what kind it was.  After chasing her down again I got her to confirm that it was mushroom, not cheese.  OK, fine - fortunately my kid wasn't picky, though I would think a lot of kids would not be OK with the mushrooms.  I got my kids to start on their meals and then I took a bite of the caprese salad.  It's just tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil - should not be hard to screw up.  The tomatoes were completely inedible.  Hard, ice cold, and clearly underripe.  Verrill Farm is about a block away - there's no excuse for serving horrible underripe tomatoes, especially in summer.   I couldn't eat more than a bite.  \\n\\nNo apologies, no effort to check in with us during the lengthy wait, no offer to take anything off the bill.  The waitress was obviously more interested in hanging out with the bar customer than attending to our meal.  And while the kids' meals seemed fine, the simplest salad in the world was awful.

For a $19 dollar chicken entree, I expect to be Wowed. It was barely meh. What came on my plate was a pile of long grain rice. Long grain rice? Any Kama'aina will tell you it HAS to be short grain and sticky. (And I had to ask for the soy sauce) The chicken had a spicy note, and nice looking grill char, but was otherwise lacking in flavor.It was also a little dry. The baby bok choy that came with it was barely edible. Now, you have to understand that I absolutely adore baby bok choy. I just don't want it so oily that it glistens and is slimy. It was actually dripping when I picked it up! So, rice, a bit of veg, and dry chicken for $19? Can't feel good about that. \\n\\nMy Husband had the pork tenderloin. Now, Hawaiians love their pork, and can cook a mean Kalua pig, but I digress. That would be too authentic for this place. The pork was dry, and the almond crust did not taste like much of anything. Roasted red pepper-shiitake mushroom sauce? More like plain brown gravy- from a mix, tasting all salty and artificially enhanced. Same oily baby bok choy as on my plate, and some really insipid looking lukewarm mashed potatoes.\\n\\nWe spent most of the meal reminiscing about tasty Hawaiian food we have enjoyed in the past.

She then offered to bring another glass of champagne on the house.  Nice save.  But wait, there's more.  The next morning, I got a call from the chef who apologized and said, he wanted to make it up to me.  we went back the next night and he prepared a complementary appetizer platter that was lovely and tasty.  I repeated the scallops and the risotto was well heated!  The crunchy chocolate dessert was lovely in presentation and delicious.  Caesar salad was tasty and they put the anchovies on the side--one of us loves them and the other can't bear a salad they've even rested on momentarily.\\n\\nGreat cheese plate, bigger servings than I had the week before in LA for more money!

The bar area was fun and relaxing. You can hang out there while you wait for your text confirmation to come through. The drinks are delicious but definitely tourist priced.

I recommend the beef shepherd's pie, with a side order of french fries and gravy.  If you like cocktails, the \\"Bad Wolf\\" is no less than absolutely excellent!\\n\\nThe prices are not bad, either.\\n\\nThe waitress staff is truly remarkable.  Be warned however, if you arrive when \\"Doctor Who\\" is on BBC tele, they will be quite overwhelmed, so please be patient.  This is why...\\n\\nFirst, if it is a 'Doctor Who night,' there will be a large crowd of fans present.  There will be more fans there than waitresses.  That is just simple math.\\n\\nSecondly, the large Englishman (who appeared to be the owner of the Establishment,) is no less than a tyrant, and he treats his waitress staff accordingly.  If my rating here would be based on HIM ALONE, I would attempt to rate this Bar/Restaurant with a negative number of stars!  The resilience and dedication to courtesy and professionalism by the waitress staff would be the attributing factor in counteracting that aforementioned, theoretical rating attempt.  Their iPad-based billing system apparently becomes troublesome on occasion, as was the case during my last visit.  The large Englishman (who I believe to be the owner,) repeatedly flipped-out on the waitresses (in plain view of the customers,) as the waitresses temporarily fought with their respective, Bar/Restaurant-issued iPads.  Yet, they remained friendly and more-than-courteous to the clientele, despite the owner's repeated verbal abuse toward them!  So PLEASE be polite to the waitress staff, and at least try to tip them well.  They REALLY EARN IT by trying to work for such an unpleasant Englishman!  I can only imagine how costly that Bar/Restaurant must be to operate... combined with a cheapskate English tyrant understaffing the operation, especially during 'Doctor Who nights.'\\n\\nThis Bar/Restaurant is in the middle of a well-known slum area of Portland.  So if you [legally] carry a concealed firearm, you would be well-justified in doing so in this part of Portland.  But once you are in the Bar/Restaurant, \\"breaking leather\\" will never even cross your mind!  It is like a totally safe island within a big slum.  Even the customers seemed completely harmless and friendly.  In fact, I have never even seen a drunk one, there!  And while \\"breaking leather\\" before arriving and/or after departing MAY cross your mind for some legitimate reason, at least parking IS available, (even during 'Doctor Who nights,') but be certain to lock your vehicle(s,) and hide any possible valuables within.  That is just common-sense, anyway.\\n\\nThe Bar/Restaurant is right next to Interstate 5, and getting to and from I-5 is not problematic.\\n\\nThere is even an outside patio, with a very large, big-screen projection of \\"Doctor Who,\\" and probably whatever else the BBC pipes-through the various geostationary telecommunication satellites.  For \\"Doctor Who\\" fans, they show both the earlier East Coast Feed, followed by the West Coast Feed, two hours later.  This is noteworthy, as minors are not allowed after 2000 hours, local time.  Or was it 2100 hours local?  \\n\\nThe popcorn is also outside, hot and fresh, and free!\\n\\nIt is really a good Place.

The atmosphere is nice -- very tavern-esque: dark, but not TOO dark. The restaurant was about 2/3 full around 11:30, so we had no issues with getting a table, and service was reasonably prompt throughout our meal. \\n\\nSince my date and I are both big fans of eggs benedict, and she likes spicy food, we decided to share the egg in a biscuit (basically benny with a biscuit instead of an English muffin) and the spicy chicken sandwich, and also got a side order of the season-appropriate \\"fried potato pancakes\\" (which were, no doubt, intended to be latkes). I had a coffee and she had a Bloody Mary to complement the meal. The coffee was decidedly so-so -- a bit weak for my tastes, while the Bloody Mary wasn't too bad, and came with a sidecar of porter that surprisingly brought out some hidden flavors. Not sure it was worth $10, however. \\n\\nThe two main courses were both quite good. The egg in a biscuit was exactly what we expected, and while I probably still prefer an English muffin with my egg and hollandaise, it tasted about as good as it could have. But the spicy chicken sandwich was truly the star of the meal. The combination of the heavily buttered bun and the appropriately spicy chicken was delicious! I'm not personally a big fan of spice, but I'd say the spice level was somewhere between mild and medium -- enough kick to please my date's palate, but not enough to stop me from scarfing down my half of the sandwich. The one downside of the meal was the fried potato pancakes (a.k.a. pseudo-latkes). They were very, very greasy, and had a chive and onion flavor that almost completely overpowered the taste of the potato. They certainly felt like an attempt at a latke by someone who doesn't know latkes (...and my date knows her latkes!).\\n\\nAll in all, brunch at Rockmill Tavern was an enjoyable experience for both of us, and we'd consider going back. Most of the food was very good, as was the service and atmosphere.

Thank goodness I had company to wile away the time or I probably would have given up, hungry and frustrated. We waited long periods to order drinks...to get drinks...to get food...I think we gave up waiting for a bill and sauntered up to the til to pay. I've also learned to call in advance, as my second trip out with the same friend (all the way from Vancouver on the bus), found the place closing for a private function. \\n\\nBut it's so good! I've had Mexican food at several Vancouver places since and they always fail to compare (I'm looking at you soggy Pepita's chili relleno). My action plan for future trips: make sure it's open before I head out and sit down before I'm even hungry (by the time I actually get the food I should be good and hungry).

Let's get into the pros and the cons of this place.\\n\\nSo the main pro is that there are lobster tails on the buffet. This is awesome, but be careful. Since all of the tails are cooked at the same time, the smaller tails will be overcooked. Don't be afraid to point at the bigger ones and request them. Also, know that you can only get one tail at a time per visit to the buffet line. \\n\\nThere are a few other premium items as well, including crab legs, prime rib, and my favorite item, the London broil. The crab legs are hit and miss. Some batches are great, some are not. Just look for the big, bright colorful batches and jump in. The London broil is surprisingly tender and juicy. A true star of the show here. \\n\\nThere are plenty of other things, though, that are trying to lure you to them so you can fill up on them and eat less of the premium items. Don't get these. You'll feel like you wasted your $50. I'm talking corn and okra and soup. Just don't. Even the sushi here is only ok. \\n\\nIn between these two extremes are the middle-of-the-road items. I recommend sampling them, but don't overindulge. I'm talking things like the fried bay scallops, the fried shrimp, the crab cakes. These are all good items. A good mix of these can make you feel like you got your money's worth. \\n\\nOverall, this place presents us with a strategic challenge. You have to eat the right combination of foods to make it not feel like a waste. Also, they give you lobster bisque delivered right to your table. It's actually pretty good. One of my favorite items.

But, when we opened the menu, we all decided the entrees looked so great that we would order lighter dinners and then get dessert.  Our server, Jenn from PA (also a trainer) was amazing!  My friend has celiac, her husband doesn't eat anything with onion (even a hint of onion), and I am vegetarian, so we has a few food restrictions.  She was super knowledgeable about the menu, each item's ingredients, and also had Chef Frankie come to the table to ensure all of the details of each item we were interested in was fully understood.  She created extra \\"allergy\\" tickets to attach to the order in the kitchen so the cooks knew to change their gloves, and use the fryer that was for non meat/gluten free food items, etc.  SUPER PROFESSIONAL and CARING in this regard.  As a vegetarian for 10 years, I have never had a server/chef team ever review the details of the menu items in such details as to ensure a comfortable and confident dining experience.  \\n\\nAs far as the food itself, it was delishe!  Keep in mind, I did not eat any of the meat/chicken/fish items, but the table's feedback was excellent for everything.  We started out with roasted brussel sprouts (veg and gluten free); pork belly sliders (made with gluten free bun); truffle oil, parmasean fries (made w GF fries, veg).\\n\\nEntrees included: fettuccini alfredo with chicken, teriyaki salmon with rice and veggies; braised short ribs over grits; waldorf salad (modified with a gluten free dressing and no walnuts); avacado toast (veg); steamed broccoli with grated cheese (veg).\\n\\nFor dessert, the GF options included chocolate or peanut butter ice cream with chocolate sauce and sprinkles, or a couple of plated desserts, including a flourless chocolate cake and flan or creme brulee?  My friend had peanut butter ice cream with chocolate sauce and sprinkle and was so happy!  The rest of the table shared a giant brownie brittle sundae - giant wedges of thick, ewwy gooey brownie, topped with a couple of scoops of chocolate ice cream, chocolate whipped cream, chocolate sauce, a piece of brownie brittle (more like a thin brownie); and chocolate sprinkles.  My only suggestion on the brownie dessert would be regular whipped cream, and maybe mini chocolate chips in lieu of sprinkles.  I would also LOVE to see hot fudge, but as explained by Jenn, with the volume of desserts they do, and the temp they need to keep hot fudge at, it isn't possible logistically to do.  I do feel like the sundae needed a bit more texture or crunch, but otherwise, outstanding with enough for 5 people to have a few spoons and feel very satisfied (with a bit left over!).\\n\\nJust wanted to convey our thanks and appreciation to the management and staff at Toothsome for making this dining experience 5-stars!!  The mere fact that the staff was so caring about our dietary needs and requests went such a long way!!  Although most places do have GF and Veg \\"options\\" they can be limited, and the staff are not always well versed in the menu item ingredients and have to \\"go in the back to ask the chef\\"... They sometimes even seem annoyed by us asking several questions (defensive, like you are trying to make their job more difficult);  Yet the Toothsome staff was the 100% opposite - kudos for showing us what \\"hospitality\\" should be.

Once we walked in, I just knew that this was it--this would be the pizza place that changed my life. The decor is outstanding, the kitchen (complete with wood-fire oven) is open, and the atmosphere is trendy.\\n\\nIf only the pizza tasted as good as it looked.\\n\\nIf only the service was half as good as the pizza looked.\\n\\nThe pizza was...pretty good. I had the Five-Ohhh (Hawaiian) and garlic knots. The knots were burnt (but you could tell they had potential to be great) and the pizza's toppings were skimpy, especially considering the price. But I would probably come back again if it weren't for the service.\\n\\nA few minutes after ordering, a random waiter came out holding a pizza and said, \\"Someone at this table ordered a Five-Ohhh, right?\\" We accepted the pizza even though no one had received their appetizers yet, and none of our friends' pizzas were ready. I think they made the pizza by mistake for another table and didn't want to have to toss it. No big deal.\\n\\nThe real issues started happening when they brought out the other pizzas. First off, they brought another Five-Ohhh so clearly the first pizza wasn't originally ours and they hadn't relayed to the kitchen not to make another one. I wonder if they continued the game musical pizzas and someone else got ours. But more importantly, one of the couples dining with us had ordered pepperoni, pineapple, and mushrooms on half. Mushrooms came on all of the pizza so they asked for it to be remade. The second pizza delivered to them had pineapples and mushrooms on all of it, and pepperoni on half. Whoops. \\n\\nAt this point, three different people stopped by the table to confirm their order. Pizza Bruno couldn't possibly mess it up again, right? Right?? The third pizza came out, and it was--wait for it--pineapples and mushrooms on all of it, and pepperoni on half. The same as the second pizza they sent back. At this point, my friends said they would just take it because they were hungry, and we were trying to make a movie. However, the pizza was clearly rushed and wasn't baked all the way through. And I'm not talking about the crust being a little bit floppy; I am talking about it being straight up dough in the center when you scraped off the toppings.\\n\\nThey did take the pizza off of the bill, but they didn't offer my friends free dessert or a beer (or something, anything!) to make up for the experience, which seemed kind of nuts to me. \\n\\nThen we got our bills. Mine was fine, but the couple who experienced the 7th ring of pizza hell was charged for an extra beer. Once they got it taken off, their bill was $22 and some change. For some reason their credit card was charged $28?! We still never got an answer as to how or why that happened, but the manager came over (for the first time all night) to refund them the extra they paid. Instead of voiding the charge and re-running it, she just wanted to refund the difference in cash. Which works, no big deal. Except she gave them back $1.07. Huh?? When my friends showed them the receipts she grabbed another $5, and then, finally, a coupon for a free pizza for them. \\n\\nAlso, spoiler alert, we missed the movie, and I am out the $7.50 Fandango fee."},{"name":"Hae Rim","address":"11729 SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Hwy","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"I have come here a few times now and I can honestly say that the service has gotten better each time.

The place was bustling with good noise and it seemed like a good spot to hang out just for drinks.  The baby blue floral wallpaper and panda with the crown and chains on the wall all work.  Music was great as well.\\n\\nService: Attentive and super friendly.  This place doesn't take reservations but we were greeted right away and got a spot at the chef's table... which is basically the bar looking into the kitchen.

We had the pork ribs to start and the char on the meat was perfect.  It was crispy and tender, fall off the bone.  The cumin beef was marinated just right... I may have licked the sauce from the bottom of the bowl!  We did have the mapo eggplant as our veggie dish... this was probably the only underwhelming dish of the night... needed a little more flavor and probably more time in the pan as well.

It might've been the pure excitement of seeing so many colourful options, or the triumphant effect of finally reaching the counter, but part of me felt it would be justified to order everything in sight.\\n\\n\\nI think my eyes were more ambitious than my stomach, because even for 6 people, these pastries were difficult to finish. The heavy ricotta filling really stuffs you up! But none the less these were an indulgent treat. The filling is very creamy and neutral enough to go well with any flavour you choose. My personal favorite was the Hazelnut Cannoli ($3.50). The hazelnuts tasted like they were candied and there was a hint of coconut in there. An amazing combination! The Chocolate Chip Cannoli ($3.50) was a close second place for me, and I noticed it was a popular choice at the ordering counter. The chocolate chips taste exactly how you'd imagine it, so it's one of the safer cannoli topping. If you're not too adventurous, the Plain Cannoli ($3)  also didn't disappoint.

While the deal was good for sushi and most of us ordered sushi rolls, we had an awkward start into the meal. It seems like there were two waitresses, with one focusing on taking orders and keeping our cups full, and the second bringing out our meals. The second waitress kept trying to give us wrong plates without really taking the time to tell us which roll was on the plate. It was frustrating because I kept asking her what the rolls were, and she just kept repeating, \\"Take it. Take it.\\" If she had taken the time to listen and tell us, we'd be able to easily direct her to the right recipient. \\n\\nAfter the third plate in front of me, I finally was able to eat my crunch crab and voodoo rolls. The rolls were a-ok. I'd say they were just about average, I wasn't very excited about the food I had. But with the price tag considered, I'd say it's a fair price for what we were given. The gyoza was crunchy, but the pork and other ingredients ended up tasting somewhat bland. The sauce helped add in a little flavor.

If you manage to snag a table on the patio I imagine you wouldn't want to leave ever, and the tables by the large windows would be the ideal view seats for rainy weather water watching.  The interior is very cozy and quietly regal, like a very polite English pub.  They have a good selection of craft beers and a good range of options on the menu.  I wouldn't say that the menu was terribly exciting or interesting but I totally wasn't disappointed with it!  I ordered fish and chips and my friend got the Sylvia burger and we were both content.\\nI did make the observation that the restaurant was quite catering to old people.  I'm pretty sure my friend and I brought the average age of customers down by 20 years when we stepped in... but there's totally nothing wrong with that!  In fact, it's good to have a go to place to bring grandparents, parents, cool old friends to when they want to go out to eat.

I want to like Cambridge Common, I really do. It's close to home and I like the feel of the place. The menu is varied and looks amazing. I have tried and tried again over the last six to eight months to like this place, but to be honest, I can't and here's why.\\n\\nIt's a loud, and obnoxious place to dine. The staff are too busy to pay attention to any of their customers, they try (and I really believe they do), but they are just machines delivering food and drinks. No matter how often I go there, I will just be a number, a strange face in the crowd. No one has time to chat, or get to know their customers and that's a shame. All this basically relates to poor and/or slow service, water not being refilled, drinks not being reordered. It takes forever to get someone's attention. Now onto the real issue I have with this place.\\n\\nThe food is mediocre at best. The salads are not fresh, the lettuce often wilted and overpowered by poorly made dressings with out of balance flavors. The Burgers are never done to the customer's satisfaction. I don't think the kitchen staff knows the difference between rare, medium well, and well done. Every time I've order a burger no matter how I specify it, it comes on way - rare. I don't like my meat bleeding, so I have to send it back, and of course this means (because of the impossibly slow service) the people I'm with are done with their meal before mine ever returns from the kitchen. The fries are horrible. They taste freezer burnt. The regular fries are always soft, and mushy with grease, and the curly fries are brittle and dry throughout. And I'm not talking on one occasion. Every time I get fries they are like this. Their fresh mozzarella sandwich might be good, but there is so much garlic in the basil pesto, you can't taste any of the other ingredients. And I can't even begin to describe how greasy their grilled cheese sandwich is - I just can't go there.\\n\\nThis is a no win situation for me, and despite its proximity to me, and their decent cocktails I will have to resign myself to finding another neighborhood restaurant to frequent. This place just won't do.\\n\\nThe only reason I'm giving them 2 paws instead of 1 is because perhaps there is something on the menu I haven't tried, which is edible.

The bread is what makes it and however these folks go about creating such loaves is beyond my comprehension. It's pure magic. \\n\\nThe pho was pretty darn good, too. My wife had the veggie pho and it was great. \\n\\nI love that you can buy the baguette at the front, too. Can't remember the price per loaf, but I remember it being really, really cheap. Maybe $0.75 per? Either way, it's a great steal and a perfect snack for the ride home. \\n\\nI love you, Lee's Bakery.

I went with some friends last week, around 8pm. We really wanted an outside table (yay summer!) and had to wait about twenty  minutes, which wasn't too bad. \\n\\nDrinks: 2 of my friends immediately were intrigued by the summer punch. I forget the exact name, but I will not forget the odd list of ingredients: lemonade, vodka, and a bottle of Sam Summer. It sounded pretty gross to me, but they had to try it. The waitress brought it out in a deceivingly large jug and poured the beer in at our table for added wow factor.  They loved it. I tried some and it was basically lemonade with a kick. Not something I would seek out, but an interesting idea. One pitcher was $20, which wasn't too bad seeing how many (short) glasses they got out of it. My other friend tried some variation on an orange creamsicle, which was actually very delicious. I don't usually like orange juice themed drinks (thank you acid reflux), but if I did, I would have ordered a couple of these! And finally, for myself, I stuck with the old standby, beer. They actually have a pretty great beer selection. Any bar with Long Trail on tap is ok by me. I ended up trying the seasonal hefeweizen on tap, and enjoyed it a lot.\\n\\nThe service was a little slow, but we were outside and there was only one server for all the tables. Our waitress was actually pretty awesome. She was really laid back and friendly. She had good recommendations and was just generally pleasant.\\n\\nSo you must be wondering why, after all this, would I not just give this place 5 stars? Well. \\n\\nDinner: I don't eat meat. So I decided to forgo my usual ban on veggie burgers (I really just don't like them, unless they are homemade and excellent, which I find to be a rare occurrence). CC has a few choices. The obligatory veggie burger with lettuce and tomato (i.e. boring), a homemade black bean burger with wilted spinach (doesn't that sound yummy?), or subbing the boring veggie burger into another meaty menu item. So i went with the black jack burger, subbed the veggie, and added avocado. \\n\\nWhen the food came out, it was a little confusing because everyone was handed the wrong order. Not a big deal. Once we got that settled, I get ready to eat my veggie burger, which is actually covered in guacamole and not plan avocados (also not really a big deal)...WELL. Good thing I looked closely at my plate: My veggie burger was covered with a nice fatty, greasy layer of bacon. Yeah. Bacon. Wait what? Who orders a veggie burger and adds bacon? Yuck. And I know some meat eaters will tell me to just suck it up and pick it off, but I am sorry, I can't do that. i do not eat pigs. Ever. And bacon is smelly and greasy and permeates anything it touches. But, hey I am actually a really easy going person. So I waited for the server to come back out while my friends ate (took about 10 minutes for her to show up) and sent my order back explaining what happened. \\n\\nShe came back quite fast with a replacement burger, sans the bacon. But now there was no avocado (or guac, either works). So I had to wait another 10 minutes for that. \\n\\nI usually don't expect to get anything for free, but after such a mix up, involving a food item i cannot eat, nor do I want touching anything on my plate, as well as the avocado mix up (2x if you count the 1st burger), and the fact I had to eat alone because my friends were done by the time my meal was ready to consume, it would have been nice if    oh maybe they gave me the veggie burger for free. Or didn't charge me extra for the avocado. Or even offered a free dessert. You know, just...something.\\n\\nI will try this place again, and hopefully, have a better time."},{"name":"Muzzarella Pizza & Italian Kitchen","address":"7780 Lake Underhill Rd, Ste 108","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Had a great meal tonight.  \\nWine suggested by owner Ben.  \\nRibeye and shrimp cooked perfectly.

The decor and candy shop are impressive and fun to explore. It's got a word semi-gothic theme which to me was odd. The menu is overwhelming and it's a brunch spot. Breakfast all day. We tried the Burger with meatloaf, a burger, corn, mashed potatoes and gravy. It was good but the gravy was extremely dark for my taste. We also had the superfoods salad. Surprisingly - it was very good.  We also had the quiche, french toast and Nutella crepe. The Cheddar Broccoli soup was not good. It tasted like it came out of a bag and consistency was too corn starchy. The french toast and Nutella crepe were great. The shakes ... that's what we all come for right?!?! On a scale from 1-10, I'd give them a 4. Sorry .... the consistency is too runny. We ordered the Peanut Butter shake, the cinnamon fantasy and 2 coffee bean. The coffee bean was like a Starbucks frappucino. Didn't finish it. The shakes are pretty but over half of the shake is whipped creme. So when it all melts together there is a bit of a lardy feel.

So, we ventured down to 40th street and Medical Pkwy in the evening on a Friday night with our eyes wide open expecting anything and nothing...\\n\\nHere's our experience:\\n\\n-Service was very good. The guys behind the counter were pleasant and addressed us immediately (we were the only ones at first).\\n\\n-They had about 4-5 tables in and around the trailer on a grassy area.\\n\\n-One of the tables had small ants (don't think they were fire ants though). And some of them were dirty. :( We found one that was suitable.\\n\\n-I had pre-planned and brought a cooler of beer with us. So, as we waited for our food (about 10 minutes), we drank a beer.\\n\\n-The sushi was delicious. We ordered, A SUNSHINE roll with mango, avocado and tuna. A TRIO roll with 3 kinds of fish. And a CRUNCHY SPICY roll (our favorite) with smoked tuna, avocado and cream cheese. We thought it was ever bit as good as any sushi place we've tried. Not quite as fancy in their presentation, but solid. No fishy taste at all. \\n\\n* super hot wasabi in packets and having anti-bacterial hand cleaner available was a bonus!\\n\\n-Cost: 3 rolls came to $19.00 after tax. NICE!

I thought maybe it was a cost issue, that the potato and vegetables are high -ticket items, so that was why you couldn't have both. The vegetables were cafeteria styled green beans loaded with black pepper, so I'm guessing the cost theory is incorrect. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed them, but it wasn't loaded with gourmet quality ingredients.

The choice was a perfect started and after raving about the soup to my girlfriend she tried some and agreed I had chosen wisely.

First you should know that I'm not a huge breakfast fan, but feel compelled to order these plates whenever I go to zaftigs.  What can I say, if you find something you like stick to it.\\n\\nTheir potato pancakes are crispy on the outside, moist on the inside.  I don't love the homemade applesauce since it really lacks flavor, but mixed with a dollop of sour cream and you've got a winner.  My only wish is that they would sell the potato pancakes individually instead of in groups of three.  They are just too big and filling to be able to eat three of them and order other food.\\n\\nI know zaftigs is known for its banana stuffed french toast, but I actually find this a little undercooked and doughy for me.  I prefer the simplicity of the banana walnut pancakes with date butter.  They come out perfectly golden brown with just the right taste of banana and crunchiness of walnut.\\n\\nThe nova fish plate is devine.  They give you enough of the fish to share and the accompaniments are always fresh.  I wish they would slice the tomato just a little thinner, but I can deal if that is the only problem.  The chive cream cheese is good as well with a light hint of onioney goodness.  \\n\\nService at zaftigs is generally good although on those busy sunday mornings you may need to wait a few minutes for your waiter to come by and refresh your water or coffee.  But they don't rush you and your coffee is bottomless so you can get your caffine on while you linger over good food and good company.  I recommend getting to zaftigs by 9am if you want to beat the morning / bruch rush.  And one more thing, if you don't like children, don't come to this place.  There a tons of little kids and babies mulling about the restaurant.  It is kind of comical and very family friendly, but can be loud.  \\n\\nA word on their ladies restroom--it is really oddly designed.

The SO sweet girl working, Mary, was personable, helpful, and in general just really cool. She made me feel like the wanted and appreciated my business which goes a long way with me. As I waited for my food, which they cook fresh to order, we chatted about all types of Asian restaurants we both like in Boston. She had heard of yelp and was excited by the great reviews that have on here. I ordered the garlic wings and crispy Thai basil chicken. The make every order to your spice preference which I also love since I am a spicy fiend. THE FOOD WAS AWESOME!!!!!!! Each meal is made as a plate with rice and an entree and for 13 dollars total the food is a super value. Way better quality than the price would make you think. It was so fresh and flavorful. The rice was perfect which you would think should be a given but it isn't always. They also deliver to Chelsea and Eastie so I will be eating here A LOT. The only things to note. They have 2 tiny 2-seater tables only so not really an eat in place.

The dumplings were all good (not overly greasy), the turnip cake was still the best I've ever had, and the sesame balls had the perfect rice to filling ratio. The restaurant had white table clothes, attentive staff, fast service/tea refills and the total bill came out to about $10 per person and we were unable to move from our seats afterward.\\n\\nAt the time, I thought that was great.\\n\\nBut then I moved to San Francisco and it was a whole new world. Restaurants in SF have no ambiance, rude service, delicious food in copious portions, and the price will come out to about $6 per person to stuff yourself on a Sunday morning until you can no longer move.

Truly.\\n\\nIt was pretty empty when a friend and I arrived. There was a small family sitting in the back with bento box combos. The tempura looked really good from what I could see, though I wasn't that hungry and we only popped in for a snack. I mention this because I'm just trying to dig up as many positives I can for this place. \\n\\nThe waitress came over to take our orders. I had asked for a Pepsi, a plate of gyoza, and a miso soup. After I had told her my order, she stopped me and asked for me to show her what I ordered on the actual menu because she was new and didn't know what anything was. I was okay with that - we were all new at some point and I don't blame her not for knowing the menu, but I honestly would have expected her to know what gyoza and miso soup were. Every sushi restaurant has its own combos and different combinations of stuff, but *gyoza* and *miso soup*?\\n\\nMy friend ordered a combo of some kind, which arrives more or less at the same time as my drink - except she has brought me a Diet Coke instead of a Pepsi. She had already opened the bottle and I didn't feel comfortable sending it back because - again - I know what it's like to be new and I didn't want to make a fuss out of something that wasn't a big deal. \\n\\nMy friend notices the soy sauce bowl they give you is greasy. We wave her down as pleasantly as we can to let her know. She apologizes and takes it away, but doesn't come back with another one. I pluck one from an empty table. As my friend is eating, he notices there is grime on the edges of his plate. It's gross, but at this point our waitress has been out of sight for about ten minutes now.\\n\\nI look at the till and there are probably three or four people up there now. The waitress and another woman (she looked like one of the cooks/chefs) are struggling with the payment system. My gyoza arrive (thanks to another one of the cooks/chefs) just as my friend is halfway through his combo, but he says the sushi is gross and he can't finish it. My gyoza are tepid and kind-of tasteless. I never received the miso soup at all.\\n\\nWe eventually get up because the waitress and the other lady are still struggling with the till. By the time they get to us, there are probably six or seven people waiting to sit down or pick orders up in an empty restaurant. A couple that was sitting outside come in twice to check in with what's going on and why no one has come to take their order yet.\\n\\nMy friend lets the waitress know that his plate was dirty. She apologizes and offers to give him a discount on his meal, but he just says flatly that he isn't coming back. We eventually pay and get out. I tell the couple waiting outside that they're probably better off finding food somewhere else. \\n\\nAnd I am probably not coming back either."},{"name":"Asian Gourmet","address":"794 Elm St","city":"Concord","stars":"4","text":"OK, I can't tell you what I was eating because it was takeout that my friend ordered and picked up.

Then I waited;  and waited; and waited.  Then I ordered a soda and waited; and waited; and waited.  I don't watch TV enough to know what show was on, but I saw most of this program where they have these wonderfully good-looking women holding briefcases with dollar amounts inside.  Preparing the meal took that long.

Modern's cannoli shell was more delicate and flavorful. Modern's ricotta filling was also a little more delicate but flavorful. It just seemed 'fresher' not as mass produced (not to imply that Mike's isn't good or that it's mass produced). My daughter preferred Mike's shell and filling better, so it really is personal taste.

Maybe they're still working out the kinks on that one!) Anyway, the prosciutto and fig was a really nice compliment to the weather. There was an ample amount of fig on the pizza, as well as arugula and TONS of prosciutto!

I love to go here on hot days and eat a burger on their patio. On a really nice day the patio can get a little crowded for my taste - but it is a good spot to drink beer with a group of friends, bring your dogs and people watch.

You know all the worry-some about what's behind the kitchen door? I think you can trust Northstar enough for that. Whether you're a vegetarian or non, they got y'all. \\n\\nAlright, let's start from the brunch. My fave dish is the mushroom frittata. The mushroom/cheese/omelette served with diced cut potato and biscuit were awesomely paired up together. Oh! And it's even better with jam on the side. I can't even describe how good the biscuit was! I put a little jam on every single bite and it was delicious!! \\n\\nMove on to dinner menu, I love their chicken avocado sandwich with their cheese blanket signature. If you wonder what that is, it's cheese melted on top of your patty. Yumm! Sounds delicious right?! The sandwich comes a little unusual since they put top bun on the side, so you actually get to see what fillers built up your sandwich! Then, once it brought to you.. they leave it up to you to demolish it. Another thing that is worth mentioning, the sandwich comes with fries. I don't think this location got sweet potato fries though. I was pretty disappointed since Short North location has it. But anyway fries still fries, who doesn't love fries? \\n\\nA little flashback here, my favorite dish was turkey sandwich. It's no longer on the menu which made me sad for quite a while but that's how I actually found my new favorite, chicken avocado sandwich! Anyway, couple dishes I've got besides those sandwiches are Buddha Bowl and tofu burrito with chips. Buddha bowl is a bomb! Brown rice on the bottom, chicken and vegetable drizzled with peanut sauce. Well, practically it's not just drizzle since they put generous amount of peanut sauce on top of chicken and vegetable. You know you eat them right when you can taste them all at once, so mix it! It was just indescribably yummy. The tofu burrito on the other hand, I would say was okay. Tofu was soft and chewy, but not that special overall. Um, don't get discouraged just yet people! It might be just not to my taste.\\n\\nNorthstar has always been my go-to place to get lunch/dinner. A little reminder if it'll be your first experience here, the style is you go order and pay, find your own table, and the foods will be brought to you.

It was dark and it smelled kind of bad. Normally a bad smelling restaurant that serves raw fish would send me running, but it was more the combination of fish and cleaning products--not exactly appetizing. I guess the sushi bar isn't open during lunch so the whole thing was shut down with plastic wrap over everything.

We each got a combination plate with nigiri (which was fine) and a roll. I got the spider roll and my friend got the dragon roll (I think). We split the rolls and traded so we could try both. The presentation was underwhelming. The rolls themselves seemed smaller than what I've normally eaten at other sushi restaurants, although it was plenty to fill us up. We also ordered the seaweed salad (you know, the artificially dyed green stuff?) which was served on a bed of lettuce with some fried wontons and more of the ginger dressing.\\n\\nOn the bright side, the waitstaff is really nice. I give them four stars. But, I guess I could say I've had better sushi from central market or HEB and next time I want sushi I will probably get it there or make it myself.

I recently tried the chickpea salad and this cold fresh salad has been a great appetizer or side to my usual BBQ seitan order. I have tried the chickpea fritter (which is essentially falafel) and while there are middle eastern restaurants that have awesome falafel, Clovers version has been a close second option. The fries there taste homemade, are real and not too greasy. The staff at the Brookline location has been nothing but kind and speedy. They offer customers to try their sodas if they seem unsure about what kind to order or if they just want to try their homemade drinks out. I also love that you can choose to veganize any of their dishes. Overall this establishment serves its purpose even if it doesn't have seating.

Hannibal's is quite the find! \\n\\nThe decor is different. It's kind of hard to explain, I was told it had a French Flair and it does to a point, but then there are the animal print design and elephant head mountings on the wall that make me think more \\"Elephant Bar\\". Strange mix, yet cool and elegant all at the same time! \\n\\nI loved the bar! Not only were the Bartenders amicable and \\"point on\\" with the drinks, but the bar itself was a sight to behold. I'm not sure what it's made of but it looks kind of like marble slate with a soft light that illuminates through it. It's a long bar too; holds lots of peeps. \\n\\nSO before I get into the food and drinks ... .I was here for a Yelp Elite function so we had a set menu in terms of food and cocktails, but the choices were PERFECT! \\n\\nFood! OK, so I honestly did not partake of any extravagant meals so that will have to wait for an updated review (perhaps after a Sunday Brunch), but I did enjoy some delicious appetizers that were a great pairing to the EG cocktails that were being spotlighted during my visit. \\nI had a great bruscheta, very flavorful, a second bruscheta (I think) that was topped off with shrimp and added just the right YUM to the tasty treat and lastly, these mini-burgers that were cooked to perfection, juicy and beckoning me to go back for a second (which, of course, I did)! Mm-mm. I loved the food; what was supposed to be apps quickly became my dinner and the diet was right out the window! \\n\\nThe cocktails .... OMG! I loved the Enlightened Grain Vodka. The Vodka is unique as it is infused with Lavender and Rosemary and just has such a great taste. Unlike most Vodkas, in my opinion, this one could be sipped straight and savored. There were a few drinks that were being served this night ... A CANARY DIAMOND, my absolute favorite. It was like a lemon drop with a punch! If you like a Dirty Martini ( I don't care for them) then you may have liked the TALK DIRTY TO ME. This one was described as \\"The savory oils of rosemary will coat your mouth when you sip this filthy little libation\\" ... Ooooh, even sounds dirty, huh? Lastly was the SPA TREATMENT and this really was a refreshing drink, kind of reminds me of a Mojito. \\n\\nThe overall experience at Hannibal's was one that will ensure my return. The food and drinks were more than I could have hoped for, the atmosphere was fun and refreshing, elegant and somewhat bohemian all at the same time! There's a cool little private room down stairs too (no Elevator access though) but you can schedule private parties there and my guess is that the treatment would be AMAZING.

Don't miss out on the BLT lettuce wraps, the silver queen corn, Vietnamese Bologna, and manti meat ravioli. The flavors in these dishes were so unique and so tasteful, bold and memorable. The corn has a parmesean, bone marrow marinade with a little kick thrown in there. The bologna is fried squid, and similar to a calimari dish with an Asian twist. The cabbage and peanut slaw really transformed everything! The fried sole was another favorite, served with a creamy yogurt and cilantro. We tried about 10-12 different plates and each was unique.

The mouthwatering food put smiles on our faces.\\n\\nWe did the combo meal which was a menu item with a fountain drink and bakery item for $10.90 ($1.50 extra to make it a pastry). Everything looked so mouthwatering in the case that I wanted to order everything but that was not to happen as bakery items varied about $4-$6 but I'll definitely be back and will go through all the pastries!! The pastries included such goodies as croissants, various tarts, chocolate treats, meringues, and Danishes. They also had French baguettes for sale.   \\n\\nCroissant Gourmet is located on a lovely side street in Winter Park surrounded by a variety of shops and other restaurants. There were a few tables to eat at inside or you can journey to some tables outside under some trees. Looking around at the other patrons, they all looked happy and satisfied with their food. It was a little disappointing that no one working there was actually French as I was hoping to go to an authentic French bakery on Bastille day, but I believe I read the owner is, he was just probably in the back but the goodies were French enough! \\n\\nI will definitely go back to Croissant Gourmet as it's one of my new favorite places"},{"name":"Cartopia Food Carts","address":"1200 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Sunday,  July 17.\\n\\nNational Ice Cream Day!

It's actually called \\"Bun Heo Hay Bo Nuong Cha Gio\\", aka, number 15. Get the number 15! It is flipping the yummiest food ever. There is lettuce and cukes and carrots and vietnamese cabbage all looking pretty like a fancy french-fry, with noodles on top, then beef, and some sort of peanuty topping, with crushed egg rolls to finish it off. We shared it of course, and STILL had leftovers. Everything was served in HUGE bowls, with fresh garnishes and excellent service! This was redeeming pho for one of us by the way. He had some really bad pho the first time he ever tried it, so if this hadn't been spectacular, he probably would have never eaten it again.\\n\\nPrices were: $6.65 for the chicken (Pho Ga) and 7.65 for the beef (Pho Bo), three completely yummy egg rolls for $2.95, and that bowlful of crunchy deliciousness called #15 cost $9.

One phenomenal, one so bad that I will never return.\\n\\nThe first time was a late Saturday night, about an hour before they closed. They were out of crawfish (which is ridiculous for a place called \\"Crawfish Shack\\"), but the wife and I wanted crab legs anyway. We ordered the Snow crab (spicy) and it was delicious. We were excited to find a decent, moderately priced seafood establishment. We told all our friends about it. We liked the Facebook page. We were in love.\\n\\nYou couldn't even understand our complete disappointment the next time we went. The second time was a complete disaster. We arrived on a Wednesday night, non-peak hours. There was one couple in front of our party of four, so we expected the 15-20 minutes that the girl at the door said.\\n\\nThere was one table open, but no one was being seated. The couple in front of us left. 30 minutes later after arriving, the hostess made a special point to say that she would seat us immediately. 30 minutes later, we were STILL waiting for a table, and there were now 5 open tables.\\n\\nI want to point out here that the place was NOT busy. What this place suffers the most from is lack of decent service. The hostess/waitress seriously needs to learn to multitask. Several times she would just wander by tables still containing dirty dishes, then hang out and talk to people at the register. The whole time we are standing at the front of the restaurant still waiting to be seated. Finally, after the fourth time the hostess \\"promised\\" us a table and failed to deliver, I lost my temper and just asked her if we could just sit down at any table. \\n\\nFinally, an hour after arriving, we were finally sitting down. That's when the punchline came: The manager/owner came by. took our drink orders, then told us that they were out of everything except crawfish and shrimp because their new location took their inventory.\\n\\nThis is a complete bullshit excuse, and they should be ashamed of themselves. If you can't stock enough inventory to support two stores, then you don't deserve to have two stores. \\n\\nWe ordered two pounds of crawfish and two pounds of shrimp. The shrimp was extremely overcooked, and the crawfish was just okay. We were ignored for the rest of our stay by the staff.\\n\\nOur new restaurant obsession had turned into a nightmare. The wife and I had dragged two of our friends with us that night, and I was personally embarrassed for the whole ordeal because of my insistence in going. \\n\\nStep up your inventory, hire more wait staff, and stop ignoring your customers. \\n\\nWe will never return.

For the most part, I do. The people I have surrounded myself with teach me about life, love, and human nature. But when it comes to brunch, the best advice I received was from a fictional early-mid 2000's character off the gay sitcom \\"Will & Grace\\". \\n\\nGrace Adler is having brunch at the Plaza Hotel, and she tells her boyfriend Harry Connick, Jr. \\"OK: the key to a successful brunch strategy is knowing how to work the buffet. See, they put all the cheap stuff, like scones and muffins, in front. I mean, how many of those can you have? Eight? Ten? That's like four bucks. Meanwhile, the smoked fishes and other pricey items are around the corner.\\" He asks her if she had a map. She responds with \\"I cased the joint last week\\". Upon hearing anyone say they're going after yogurt or the melon, she snorts and calls them a \\"dumbass\\". \\n\\nConsider this my casing of the joint if you haven't tried it already.\\n\\nThe strategy listed above is perfect for larger buffets epitomized by the Four Seasons, but can still be applied to a more straightforward buffet such as Lambert's. I can't stress this enough: make sure you make reservations before you go (They don't take any after 1:00 PM). A group of nice-looking ladies who checked in ahead of us were told the hour-long+ wait is longer than the buffet would be open, and there was no table. One of them looked especially crestfallen, and I felt bad for them because it was obvious they had put all of their eggs benedict in the Lamberts brunch basket. So--make sure you call ahead or use OpenTable; they called me the morning of to confirm, and we had our booth ready to go as soon as we walked in.\\n\\nI was more excited about this brunch than others, for several reasons that included Lamberts making the national food website TheDailyMeal.com's list of the 101 best restaurants in America, and because Perez Hilton reported Lady Gaga stopped in for a cold drink here when she was in Austin. I can't decide which one was more important for me.   \\n\\nOur hostess was this size zero, put-together blonde who was totally on the ball, but it wouldn't have hurt her to crack a smile. Just being pretty doesn't work on me, dear. \\n\\nThe buffet is $30/person, and when you consider the access to prime rib, brisket, and ribs, it's easily worth it. You can also order off the made-to-order menu (included in the price), and the waitress began by highly recommending the thick cut brioche French toast with whipped strawberry butter & real maple syrup, the omelette with cheddar & goat cheese & caramelized onions, and the brisket hash. I almost made a fatal error by avoiding the French toast, but Dad ordered it all. \\n\\nThe line wasn't that long, and moves at a decent pace. I was behind a woman who began by spooning melon onto her plate. Dumbass... \\n\\nI skipped the melon and there was a peppy girl who doles out the bacon, sausage, homefries, and cheddar poblano grits fresh from behind the grill. I tried the bacon and the grits, and luckily the grits come in their own little dish so they don't messily run all over the plate. Not that they would; they were delicious and thick, with just the right amount of cheese and spiciness. The smoked salmon was my only true disappointment; while OK, it seemed waterier than I'd like, and wasn't served with bagels and schmear, which is my favorite. A minor issue to be sure, though. \\n\\nI selected a couple deviled eggs with caviar and several thick stalks of chilled asparagus with sherry shallot vinaigrette before I made it to the carving board. There is also this ridiculously thick mac and cheese you can barely even shake off the spoon. I opted for a slice of the prime rib and their brisket, but skipped the ribs as I am not that big of a fan. Both proteins were moist and juicy, and obviously what sets this brunch apart from all the rest. They give you small, manageable portions, so if you want more, don't be afraid to get back in line and get some. I think they serve it this way because they know people's eyes are usually bigger than their stomachs. \\n\\nNow I know I said avoid the pastries, but the waiter brought over a plate of lemon scones, and chocolate chip and blueberry muffins.

Instead, they had those little space heaters sprawled out within the restaurant, but they might as well save their money on electricity since it was still freezing inside. Also, their prices are a bit high.  Dinner for two was about 40-45 bucks. At other places, dinner for two ( my boyfriend and I usually order 2 apps, rice/lomein, and a dinner plate) is around  $20-25.\\n\\nOther than that...\\n\\nThis Chinese food is VERY good and high quality.  Their beef teriyaki is phenomenal. Rather than a flattened out slab of beef on a stick, it comes as little meaty steak tips.

The waitress was prompt and friendly.\\nWe each ordered a drink, deviled eggs as an app, and I got the daily soup.  The Tomato Soup came out in a bowl with 2 small wedge grilled cheese sandwiches - a lot more than I expected.  The soup was yummy, more brothy than creamy, a good amount of tomato flavor with lil bits of basil to add herb flavor.  The grilled cheese was good nice and toasted.\\nThe deviled eggs had caviar on top which added some saltiness.  Eggs cooked perfect and the filling was piped in.  Creamy and light on flavor.\\nFor our entrees - I ordered the half chicken that came with a white bbq sauce.  The sauce was tangy maybe buttermilk?  It becomes addicting after a few bites, I enjoyed it more than the other 3 sauces.  The chicken was moist and the skin had a nice snap to it. It was dark up there and they had placed a habenero on my plate, which I thought was a cherry pepper, big mistake but after using the dip over and over the fire in my mouth finally went away.\\nThe Sauces - there are 3 in 3 different size bottles: original ketchup bbq, spicy bbq, and mustard bbq.  I liked them all a lil thin for sauce.\\nMy husband ordered 3 meats, the bbq holy trinity - sausage, rib, brisket.  The brisket is definitely lean with good fold over - I found it a lil dry for my taste but I prefer fatty brisket.  The rib was cooked right just not a lot of flavor.  The sausage was good not too greasy.\\nOverall, we liked the food and would return to try other items on the menu.\\n\\nThis is what garnered the 3 stars:\\nAs we were waiting on our bill we saw a waitress who was wearing knee high boots remove one boot hold it upside down with one hand(so her hand was on the bottom of the boot), and with her other hand she proceeded to scratch the top of her foot and then rub the sweat off her leg.

It's really not like golf, because you merely hit balls from a mat into weird looking circles that are suppose to resemble greens.  Even if you hit a good shot and it is close to the pin of one of these circles, it doesn't give me a feeling of making a great shot - at least compared to actually hitting onto a real green and having the ball roll or back up to the pin.  The other option is to drive the ball to a location on the back net.  Again, it isn't even close to comparing to actually hitting a real drive down a real fairway.  I just don't see this new innovation getting much traction, or becoming a permanent fixture anywhere.

It just keeps getting better. Service has been better, too.\\nAs for the brunch, we started with the mini doughnut appetizer that came with 3 dipping sauces - chocolate, cherry, and vanilla. So good!! I got a mimosa which had plenty of kick but definitely had a higher OJ-champagne ratio than most places (which is totally fine by me).  My fiance and I shared a plate of the chicken and waffles and a plate of the Eggs Bricktops with potatoes. Everything was so good. Waffles were fluffy, chicken was tender and crispy, potatoes were flavorful with some parmesan (and maybe some rosemary?), and the quiche-type item with cheese, eggs, and sausage was fantastic. I can't wait to go back. This has definitely become one of our favorite restaurants."},{"name":"Little Donkey","address":"505 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Came for opening week, and many times since in the time it has taken me to review.

In Mike's Pastry, the cannolis with their cheese filling lay in the glass cases for hours, as gnats fly inside the case, occasionally landing on one of these sorry excuses for cannolis.  In Modern, only the shells are  on the shelfs.  When you make it to the front of the line (trust me, it's worth the wait) and ask, \\"One cannoli please, \\" the fast, quick Italian girl takes a shell (splurge for one covered in chocolate) and fills it with FRESH RICOTTA CHEESE.  No flies.  No moldy cheese filling after sitting in a case for several hours.  Instead, instant freshness at a much more reasonable price--$1.50 as opposed to Mike's $3.50!\\n\\nOther Modern favorites:  My entire family is addicted to their fig filled cookies---light, golden cookie with fresh, soft, not too sweet fig on the inside.  You also can't go wrong with the neopolitan or the chocolate mousse.  Actually, you can't go wrong with anything.

Arawan and Thai Little Home have some serious competition for best Thai in Vancouver.\\n\\nDiscovered this little dive gem via my Yelpers.  Thank you, folks!  You've come through for me and my belly yet again.\\n\\nFirst off:  The location.  Let's talk about the location as I actually pulled into the Shell gas station on Van Mall Drive near Andresen to turn around; I was sure I'd missed the restaurant completely and did not have my phone with me.  I look up... and right there it was!  In back behind the Shell, tucked in next to a convenience store.\\n\\nThe ambience:  Tiny place with seven tables, three of which are two seaters, and one of those of which the owner kinda uses as his own to put his stuff on (but will move as the place fills up).  Kinda run down and not so very clean.  If you are a clean freak or insist on luxe surroundings, you will not approve.  Decor includes a (very nice) wall calendar from 2007, plastic flowers with dust on them, and the dessert menu taped on the wall at each table with about 9 pieces of tape.  The front part of the restaurant looks like two bachelors decorated the place... many years ago.  Towards the back, though, there is an elaborate altar with beautiful religious iconography and two beautiful elephant tapestries. \\n\\nThe service:  The famed Joe Montana, Sr., must have been off the day I was there, or maybe that was him and he was feeling under the weather.  The service was attentive, courteous and efficient, mostly just efficient.  I never wanted for anything.  When I came in for lunch just after 11 a.m., I was the only one there, but every table quickly filled up.  It was apparent that several patrons were repeats.  With six tables full and lunchtime to-go-ers filtering in and out, the waiter/checker-outer in the front room and the one cook (with no help) in the back weren't so much as breaking a sweat.  With all tables full in such a tiny place, it can be a little claustrophobic.  Food was up fast for all of us.  Those waiting for food to go were getting a complimentary spring roll with peanut sauce... a really nice touch that went above and beyond.\\n\\nThe food:  Ah, the food.  With the lunch special, everyone gets one small vegetarian spring roll with peanut sauce.  You'd think spring rolls would be hard to mess up, but I've had some surprisingly foul ones in my time.  This one, however, was sublime.  Something about the contrast between the cool crispness of the lettuce with the warm creaminess of the peanut sauce (yes, they slightly warm up the peanut sauce for you... another nice touch which I did not miss) was just divine.  The complimentary Thai iced tea was okay -- I've had better -- but I've also never had FREE Thai iced tea, either.  So I definitely ain't complaining.  I opted for the Mongkolchai Crispy Basil, which comes with chicken and shrimp and a special house sauce.  It was DELICIOUS.  I actually had to fight the urge to butt in and tell newcomers to get what I had.  Portion size was perfect for lunch, and the meat in my dish was plentiful.  Both the quality and texture of the shrimp was excellent and was not at all \\"off,\\" as you know it can sometimes be.\\n\\nThey have interesting takes on a variety of familiar dishes -- I'm not quite sure if this is just the Mongkolchai spin on things or if their version is truly more authentic -- but I am now curious to try all of them and see for myself.  Will definitely be back again.\\n\\nRecommend the Mongkolchai Crispy Basil.  :)"},{"name":"Donna's Cakes","address":"100 Spring St","city":"West Roxbury","stars":"4.5","text":"After reading all rave reviews I expected a much nicer cake to be honest.

Whenever I'm home in the Boston area, I always swing around Ming's. Also, I think it's important to note that I'm saying this as someone who's been through many restaurants in Taiwan, mainland China, Chinatown in both NYC and Boston, etc.\\n\\nAtmosphere (9/10): Feels like an authentic Chinese restaurant, is well furnished and very bright with pale yellow lighting and paint all around. The main dining room is especially spacious and feels generally very clean. The only issue I've ever encountered with seating has been on days when the restaurant has been entirely booked out for weddings, which is rare. During meal times the restaurant is almost always packed, but there's usually either no wait or a short 5-minute wait.\\n\\nFood (9.5/10): I've been here so many times over the past two years and I've never been disappointed. Definitely order their seafood and fried dishes, which are extremely flavorful. Their portions are very generous, and their rice bowls are always overflowing--my suggestion is to underestimate the amount of rice everyone will eat, then order later on as needed. Their dishes are necessarily a bit greasy, but I really haven't found this to be an issue. They offer multiple tea options upon seating, and always provide taro coconut or mung bean coconut tapioca dessert after dinner--unless they run out late at night :(. Ming's offers dim sum dining on weekends, and they always have many carts circulating around, so waiting for food really isn't an issue. Their har gow, ribs and shrimp rice noodle rolls are incredible, and their desserts are equally good. I've never eaten anything at Ming's that I haven't either liked or loved. \\n\\nHygiene (8.5/10): I was very pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness of the restaurant. The bathrooms are large, very modern, and well-maintained. There are 12-16 large fish tanks holding fish and shellfish in front of the kitchen and outside the bathroom entrance that, though certainly not spotless, are much, much cleaner than any of the same kind I've ever seen before in any Chinese seafood restaurant. The staff change tablecloths for every new guest(s), so the tables are always spotless.\\n\\nPrice (8.5/10): For the quality ingredients that it offers as well as the portions it provides, Ming's is well worth the price. Almost all dishes are between 10-20 dollars, with some of the seafood dishes leaning toward the pricier side. Dim sum dishes are between 5-10 dollars each, and each plate is priced according to predetermined sizes.\\n\\nLocation (6/10): Ming's is wedged next to the corner of Pleasant and Main Street, and since Pleasant St. is lined with restaurants, street-side parking during meal times can be a hassle. There is a parking lot down the street, but that it usually always packed as well. \\n\\nService (10/10): The service at Ming's is impeccable, a fact that is evident in both the staff's efficiency and attention to detail. Even when the restaurant is packed, they will remember specific requests. The waiters and waitresses are always friendly and helpful!\\n\\nOverall: Ming's is a clean, modern and stylish Chinese restaurant that offers some of the best seafood around!\\n\\nRecommended dishes:\\n- Hot chili oil (not the sauce, and ask for it in advance for free!)\\n- Salt and pepper calamari (the squid is consistently tender, the portion is quite large, and includes a great spice mix of crisp fried noodles and chopped/lightly fried hot peppers.\\n- Salt and pepper soft-shell crab\\n- Beef Thick Rice Noodles\\n- Eggplant (any of the dishes)\\n- Seafood Tofu Clay Pot"},{"name":"Kafenio","address":"3387 Main St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Less than a 5 minute walk from our house and one of our favorite breakfast spots!

First, what other reviewers say about their total inattention to reservations is completely true. Reservations mean nothing here. \\n\\nSecond, the staff seem to know absolutely nothing about wine or cocktails. I ordered a glass of italian wine and the server brought out something completely different. As in you order merlot and get pink zinfandel different. When I told her that it wasn't what I ordered, she said, \\"oh, it's the same thing\\". Really?  When I tried to explain that it isn't, in fact, the same thing, but very different, the waitress left and returned a minute later with the same exact glass of wine. At this point, I decided to just take it. However, the actual glass in question was completely filthy. There was some sort of sticky grime all over the stem, and various specks of who-knows-what were swimming in the wine.\\n\\nAnother person at the table ordered an italian cocktail. The server looked at him as though he was speaking another language, and brought something completely different, which then had to be exchanged for another drink, this time containing no more than two ingredients.\\n\\nNow for the food. One of the people in the party ordered veal and got pork. Perhaps they figured that those, too, were \\"the same thing\\".\\n\\nLobster ravioli were drenched in what can only be described as a white lard sauce. It was as though someone melted a pound of butter, threw in some cream and called it a day. In other words, uneatable.\\n\\nSeafood was gamy and fishy. Linguini were diced up in three inch pieces as though made for a five year old, and the gnocchi tasted store bought/out of a package.\\n\\nSeriously, this place is a joke.

It was a Saturday during SXSW and an event was going on at the same time, so it wasn't a problem. My pretzel was delicious, really hot and soft, probably the best pretzel I've ever had. Get the beer cheese! However, after about 20 minutes the pot stickers still hadn't come to the table. I went to the counter, where one of the guys behind the bar informed me a little rudely that there was a line, and I just said I needed to talk to the server and pointed her out. She came over and I let her know I still hadn't received my full order. She was very apologetic, let me know the kitchen was backed up and said she would go check. They came out about 2 minutes later, piping hot. They were really good, a little greasy but I'm not sure if that's just because it's a new kitchen and they're still learning how to handle the rush.

It's a really tough reservation.\\n\\nThis is one restaurant that really is worth all the hype. The atmosphere is incredibly romantic, and feels as if you are in a cozy Cellar somewhere up north. The food is where things really get good though, starting with the warm pretzel bread and honey butter. We honestly would have been happy with just the pretzel bread, it was that good. The mixed drinks, complete with a color changing ice cube, added to the fun and set the tone for the rest of our meal. My baked salmon was the best I've ever had, and my husband's pork chops were tender and flavorful. The Truffle fries were also delicious.

Recently, on Valentine's Day, my family and I had the opportunity to eat at Le Cellier for lunch.  Overall, it was 'ok' and I'll go back because I really want to give it a second chance.\\n\\nTo start, the cheese soup, the pretzel bread, the poutine -- all amazing, out of this world, so worth it.  I'd had the cheese soup sample back at Food and Wine and couldn't wait to get a full bowl.  It was everything I'd hoped and more.  Two of my kids got the kid's cheese soup and they loved it, too.  Perfect flavors.   I'm bummed I didn't think to dip the pretzel bread, because that would have made it even better.  We had the bacon / cheddar poutine and it was high quality, well prepared and fantastic.  Just thinking about the starting part of the meal is making my mouth water.\\n\\nThe entree is where things went a bit downhill.   I ordered the bison strip loin (\\"Celery Root, Braised Leeks, Honey-roasted Apples, Heirloom Carrots, Apple Chips\\") medium.  It was well prepared, looked good, was very tender... but was almost completely lacking in taste.  I like bison and gamey meats, but there was just very little discernible flavor here.  The accompanying celery root was, frankly, bitter and unappetizing.  It's possible I could have enjoyed the bison more without the celery root, but every bite I took that had touched the celery was 'bleh'.  It tasted like very bitter squash.  The apples were probably my favorite thing on the plate - they were really delicious.  But no amount of honey-roasted apples would make up for the lackluster flavor of the meat.\\n\\nI feel bad complaining about the steak, because it was truly prepared well.  I just did not care for the seasoning and what it was prepared with.\\n\\nMy daughter had the kid's salmon and demolished it - good.  My sons all had the kid's sirloin and it was 'okay' - about the quality of a good hamburger.  No prizes from them, although the cheese soup and breads got rave reviews around the table. \\n\\nWe were only there for lunch and did not partake of desserts.\\n\\nService was fine - no problems, but nothing stand-out.\\n\\nOverall, I was disappointed in Le Cellier.  I spent weeks getting excited for this meal, but the entree was just a turn off.   That said, I will 100% go back - the poutine and cheese soup sold me, and I'll try one of the other steaks.

This is one of the very few higher-end restaurants in Austin that we actually enjoyed the food at. The steak is a bit of a let down for the class of restaurant that it is, but everything else is fantastic!\\n\\n(8/10) Chicken & Andouille Sausage Gumbo (Appetizer)\\nA cup of gumbo with rice, beans, chicken, and sausage. The consistency is thick and hearty which makes it quite satisfying. If you can't make it to New Orleans, try this instead. The gumbo is packed with flavor and addictive to eat!\\n\\n(8/10) Shrimp Eddy (Appetizer)\\nJumbo shrimp sauteed in a creamy tarragon sauce served with toasted garlic bread. The buttery garlic bread and mouth watering sauce is what makes this dish a huge hit.  We wish we could take this sauce home with us! The shrimps are large and plentiful, but slightly chewy. However, don't let that deter you from ordering this dish!\\n\\n(6/10) Steak Robert\\nBlackened tenderloin, over red wine peppercorn sauce. Served with grilled six shrimp and mushroom, bacon, and garlic sauce. We ordered the tenderloin cooked medium based on the waiter's recommendation but were disappointed on how unevenly cooked it was. The outside was firm and enjoyable, but the inside was quite mushy.  The Cajun shrimp was a delicious addition and was not chewy like the Shrimp Eddy.  For our side item, we chose the dirty rice which was mediocre.\\n\\n(8/10) Chicken Dixie\\nChicken stuffed with mushrooms, bacon, and spinach. Served over fire roasted red pepper cream sauce with  bacon (applewood smoked) wrapped asparagus. The stuffing and sauce complimented the tender chicken very well.  It is not mentioned in the menu, but the dish comes with what seemed like half a head of broccoli. Our only complaint is that the bacon around the asparagus is soft and fatty. This dish is a must!\\n\\n(8/10) Louisiana Style Bread Pudding\\nThe bread pudding was delicious and the ice-cream on top complemented it perfectly. The whiskey in the bread pudding was subtle and added a hint of smokiness to the dish. If we could change one thing, we would have liked it to be a bit more moist and puddingy - but overall it was still a noteworthy dessert.\\n\\n(7/10) Chocolate Custard\\nThis custard resembled a flan, and could easily have fed four because of its richness. It had a nice flavor, not too subtle and not too intense. It was tightly packed mousse of chocolate cream galore. This was one of the few times we were unable to finish a chocolate dessert...Wow!\\n\\nService (9/10)\\nThe service here is top-notch. The hostess was professional and pleasant, and our waiter was very helpful. He was down to earth and friendly, not pretentious as waitstaff sometimes are at fancy restaurants. He spaced out our 3-course meal and was attentive without being overbearing. He also boxed up our leftovers and never rushed us. The waitstaff here is experienced and friendly - a fabulous combination.\\n\\nAmbiance (9/10)\\nGumbo's occupies the first floor of the historic Brown building in downtown Austin. Valet is available, but we were able to find street parking. The restaurant has plenty of seating available in tables and booths. The ambiance is a mellow, upscale wood interior, with dim lighting, high ceilings and light jazz playing in the background. This Cajun restaurant is good for couples and groups because it has a nice intimate feel to it. Gumbo's is slightly pricey but well worth it - especially if you enjoy large portions and rich, creamy sauces.

That is no exaggeration... we almost turned it away that we couldn't believe it was at the table so fast! They were very good, albeit obviously made ahead and not very hot. Onto the meal... I had the chicken teriyaki and my husband had the ultimate spicy tuna and distinguished gentleman. The good... the distinguished gentleman was delicious. A good \\"surf and turf\\" type of roll. The ultimate spicy was reviewed to be good as well, however be warned they are not joking on the level of \\"hot\\" on this one. It is SPICY! The okay... the chicken teriyaki is served \\"bone-in.\\" The presentation is great, and the teriyaki flavor is good. There just isn't enough flavor throughout! Once you get by the other skin, there is no sauce left which makes for plain chicken. I suggest forgoing the bone... serve it sliced with skin on, and drizzled teriyaki over the entree to improve flavor through all of the meat.  The timing of the meal needs improvement as well. I received my miso soup a few short minutes before the main entrees were served. It was very good, would have liked a few more minutes to enjoy it.  Overall, it was a pretty good meal, with some timing issues. Just remember that if you are going to Baldwin park on a Friday night, the atmosphere is one for a dressier night out."},{"name":"Hello Chicken","address":"5295 Buford Hwy Ne","city":"Doraville","stars":"3.5","text":"Went here last night for a friend's birthday dinner, and it was delicious! We ordered the cheese tteokbokki, and kimchi fries, one half and half chicken (regular and sweet/spicy) and one whole order of soy garlic.\\n\\nThe tteokbokki was good, but it could have been a bit more flavorful and the rice cakes were a little chewy.\\n\\nThe kimchi fries were a surprise hit! We thought it would just be fries with kimchi, but they were loaded with kimchi, beef, and sauces. They were incredibly delicious and were a hit with the whole table.\\n\\nThe chicken was fried really well -- the regular fried chicken was fine, but nothing to write home about. It was crunchy and well-seasoned.\\n\\nThe sweet & spicy was incredible. The sauce reminded me of a spicy version of sweet & sour sauce, but with more depth. \\n\\nThe soy garlic is exactly what I was hoping it'd be. My first experience with KFC was in NYC at Turntable Mad for Chicken, and this tasted exactly the same.

The stair case is outside on Spruce street but inside (with elevator) on the Vine street side.\\n\\nThere is usually a long line but don't let that scare you off, the line moves pretty quickly as the menu is simple. But do keep in mind they only fry a certain amount of chicken so some of the parts might not be available (chicken count down). And when you order, they ask for your name and when ready, the wait staff calls out your name for you to claim your food so keep your ears open!\\n\\nI tried the 4 drumstick meal with two different spice levels (hot and holy) of the 4 they had: cold, warm, hot and holy.\\n\\nMy suggestion would be not to go beyond hot. I'm someone who can do and love spicy foods but felt the holy overwhelmed so that you couldn't really enjoy the chicken itself.\\n\\nThe chicken was moist inside and crispy on the outside. The outside was flavorful (except the holy). However the piece de resistance was their vinegar-based cole slaw. OMG, that was soooo amazing!! I would NOT get a double order of Macs and miss out on the cole slaw. It was a wonderful compliment to the spice level and fried chicken. The chicken meal comes over two slices of bread with sides of coleslaw and Mac in a styrofoam box with access to unlimited sweetened iced tea. The Mac was tasty too. Nicely cheesed and mushy.\\n\\nThere are two long communal tables which have rolls of paper towel and plastic utensils. There are seating areas outside in the market area as well.

The hubby and I frequented Chau Chow on Morrissey Blvd., but after reading the reviews of Chinatown Express, we were tempted to try this place and see if it was better.  \\n\\nApparently, the two of us can eat, or our eyes are bigger than our stomachs...maybe a little of both.  We ordered crab rangoons, which were very nice with a hint of sweetness, and peking raviolis, also very tasty, better tasting than many I've had.  The chicken wings?  Very robust compared to other chicken wings that I've tried at other Chinese take out restaurants and boy were these good!  Add to that some house fried rice, which was very nice with seemingly everything in it (little shrimp, pork, etc...) and Four Happiness, with beef, shrimp, chicken and roast pork, so certainly no shortage of meat.  Not my favorite dish (I found the shrimp and pork's taste not to my liking) but I imagine one could do worse.  \\n\\nPretty good value, and on top of that, they gave us about eight slices of some baguette like soft bread which we made French Toast with this morning for breakfast.  Nice bonus!  And they sure didn't skimp on the fortune cookies (we got about 8 - we must've ordered so much they thought we were having guests over or something).  They also didn't skimp on the dipping sauces.  Finally, their prices are pretty reasonable.  \\n\\nChinese take out can be pretty salty, but I have to admit, I was still a bit taken aback by the sodium overload the first time I tried this place and was hesitant to try it again.  The hubby however, convinced me to go back (okay, and ordering those stellar robust chicken wings sweetened the deal, too).  The other reviews here swore by it.  Going back again, I expected to have to swig a tall glass of water immediately after finishing to balance out my equilibrium.  Perhaps it's because we didn't order as much the second time or I was just expecting it to be worse due to my initial experience with them, but it wasn't as bad I remember it.  We tried something different also - their curry beef.  Ok...it was tasty.  I will definitely give them that - everything I have had here has been very tasty.  I'm coming around, and this most likely is going to turn out to be our go-to place for Chinese take-out.  So I'll bump it up to four stars from my previous three.  \\n\\nNow...the last time I went here to pick the food up, another customer and I were chatting a bit, and he mentioned the egg rolls were the best he had ever had.  Considering everything I've had here so far has been really good, and I don't like egg rolls...if I order and egg roll, try it, and really like it, then these guys are going to be bumped up to five stars. \\n\\nSo update...1/24/14.  I finally tried one of their eggrolls.  They're big and battered and beautiful.  Dipped them in duck sauce, was completely magical and when I ate the whole thing I was immediately sorry I didn't order more of them.  So, as I promised, they are now up to five stars. \\n\\nAs an additional note, just an fyi that they do not deliver."},{"name":"Strip","address":"245 18th St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"We met up at Strip for a bite and drinks on a Saturday night.

We think it's because there was another large party right next to us and they didn't want to sit us at the same time...\\n\\nUnfortunately, it was really hard to talk as a group, since we were at a long table. I was able to talk with the 4 people seated around me and that was pretty much it. The music and other diners didn't help with the noise level and near the end of the meal, the club music got LOUD. \\n\\nThe waitress was pretty inattentive. She took forever to greet us as we sat down in waves and never asked if we wanted drinks - we had to tell her we wanted them. And those drinks took a while to come out (the Riesling was fantastic though, and my friend's two drinks - the Jade Goddess and I can't remember the other one - were great as well).\\n\\nAs for the food.\\n\\nThe waitress eventually (I think this should have been put on the table either before we sat, or immediately) brought out a basket of soft pretzels with some cheese spread, which was a nice surprise. Some mustard would have been a nice touch, but this was unexpected, so I'm not complaining.\\n\\nWe started with a bunch of apps: The Cheeseburger Dip sounded intriguing, so we had to get that (basically spicy queso dip with some bits of meat. Good and we ate it all, but nothing spectacular); the Buffalo Chicken Dumplings were deep-fried, which I didn't expect, and were tasty, but not as great as I thought; the Southwestern Rolls were fatter than I expected (more like an eggroll than a spring roll) and not bad, not amazing. Overall, the apps were fattening and tasty, but not the most amazing I've ever had.\\n\\nFor my main course, I tried to be healthy and went with the Cobb Salad (I know, not the healthiest salad!) - as did my friend. The waitress forgot our chicken and brought it out on separate plates. Interesting. Overall, it was fine. Not the most amazing salad, but it was fine. My husband got the Italian Chicken Panini, which he said had a \\"dishwashing detergent taste.\\" Possibly the oil on the sun-dried tomatoes? I tried a bite or two and coul taste what he meant, but it wasn't inedible. The waffle fries were not as crispy as I've had before, but I tend to like my fries a bit \\"soggier.\\" Taste-wise, they were yummy.\\n\\nThe waitress DID bring out a small molten-lava cake for the birthday boy and I don't think they charged us for it, but I could be mistaken.\\n\\nThe final bill came to about $310 with tip & tax, which is not bad for 10 people with apps, drinks and entrees. We paid only $60 for the 2 of us and I found that VERY reasonable, especially considering the location and ambience!\\n\\nWould I come back? Possibly.

The place was packed and to avoid the wait, we took a table outside which was not under umbrella cover. It was not an issue as the sun was not bearing down in the table's direction. However it was a hot day and keeping a bowl on the table with half and half creamer and butter is a head scratcher. These items need to remain in cool conditions. The butters are melted. The creamers can spoil fast in the heat and humidity. My vegetarian omelette was good. However I feel the fresh fruit should be served in a bowl rather than on the same plate as eggs. At most you can use the orange rounds as a garnish on the omelette. But the strawberry and blueberries just seem randomly thrown on the plate and it mixed up with the omelette and veggies. May as well call is a fruit and vegetarian omelette. My wife ordered a Veggie Griller. Basically a sandwich with spinach and mushrooms and cheese and ranch dressing in a toasted bread of choice. It seems they emptied a whole package of spinach in it! Way too much spinach that it overpowered the taste for any other item in the sandwich. The waitress also agreed it was too much spinach. Service was good. It is inexcusable in this day and age however not to have almond milk or soy milk options for non dairy consuming patrons. Especially if you are a breakfast and lunch place. The menus were dirty with other people's food or liquid splashes. Should be wiped clean. Overall not bad but improvements can be made to stand out from others."},{"name":"Czar Ice Bar","address":"56 E Andrews Dr NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"So apparently for some people, the idea of an \\"ice bar\\" is that you have to wear layers of clothes and sit on ice.....what fun is that?   I much rather see my Atlantan's in their normal cool and sophisticated attire sipping one of the 300 different types of vodka relaxing on a cool couch or sitting at the bar that does have an ice block surface.  The ambiance is blue ice, the glass light ceiling has an ice effect, the waitresses are bedazzled in blue sequence.... I think they have it down just right.  \\nYes the martini's are $12 but  name a place in Buckhead you can get an excellent mixologist's signature drink for less than $12?  They have a full bar, so if for some reason you don't go for vodka---even cucumber or strawberry or one of the other 20 different custom diffused vodkas, you can get your beer or your bourbon.   \\n\\nThe Sushi and sashimi is reasonably priced....consistent with Decatur pricing, not necessarily Buckhead pricing.   It is fresh and delish and they probably had some of the best pork dumplings than I have had at any actual Asian restaurant.   I think it is pretty \\"Cool\\" pun intended, that they have good sushi and Asian offerings to nosh on, and the place isn't completely iced over, when the REAL reason to go there is to work your way around the world trying one of their 300+ vodkas from around the world. \\n\\nAnd since their sister club is \\"Prohibition\\" down stairs, you can get the secret code from the bartender and slip in to the gentlemen & ladies club (cigar bar) for an after dinner smoke and very unique concoction from their master mixologist."},{"name":"Yanagi","address":"4404 W William Cannon Dr, Ste B","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been coming here for a couple of years now and have to agree with Stephanie S. that the portions have gone down in size.

It's the time of the day reliably located before both afternoon and evening. To some it's greeted with overt hostility (insert sound of growling zoo animal here). To others it's early bird catching worm go time. Regardless it's the opening stanza to the latest page of that weighty (if we're lucky) tome we refer to as \\"life\\". You're particularly lucky if you happen upon a breakfast joint that doubles as a calm oasis from the onslaught of daily hum and drum that awaits. When I walked into Another Broken Egg Cafe the folks behind the scene did an  incredible job of offering an inviting atmosphere and an inspiring wealth of food choices. If I was to elaborate on the various egg choices to any great length your whole entire day would be eaten up trying to follow the string of gushing commentary. Out of respect for you, the readers, I'll stick to what I dined on in this instance. I hope to visit regularly. \\nIf the omelet I selected is any indication future meals will be equally satisfying. All omelets come with country potatoes and an English muffin. My waiter was thoughtful enough to sub one of their other muffin varieties, in this case the banana nut. The morning glory (with a carrot cake taste) and cappuccino chocolate can also be sampled. First a word about the sides. I was most pleased with the country potatoes. They're a lot less imposing than the home fries at Kerbey Lane. I was envisioning them being so large that when my omelet came I'd be struggling to polish them off. No such worry need have crawled through my brain. They were high on flavor with just a touch of pepper to lend them some oomph. I had a similar size misconception as it pertained to the muffin. I was thinking I'd get some titanic monstrosity that mandated making some fast friends. The list of starters advertises that they're \\"perfect for sharing\\". No need to share. Treat yourself to one. Warm out of the oven with that reassuring straight from Mee Maw's kitchen vibe. \\nMy omelet was the Garden Delight. This entree is packed with spinach, mushrooms, diced tomatoes, and Swiss cheese. What galls me about spinach is how limp it can be at its worst. Now instead of upping my diet respectability with spinach the issue becomes how can I chew this fabric swath disguised as an edible commodity so I don't choke to death? The spinach as well as the rest of the omelet went down delightfully smooth. The Swiss cheese blended well with the egg's overall taste. By itself this variety of cheese, due to its mild flavor can come off as bland. But as part of a quality omelet like this it enhances the muscular flavor profile. \\nThis place is filled with likable prints bearing the images of roosters and fruit bowls among other things. When I visited copious strains of jazz were playing. Orange, one of the more notable colors of the breakfast hour figured into the paint job in a major way. The folks in charge get high marks for disarming smiles and attention to details. My server took a while to remember to serve up the cranberry juice I ordered but, when he sprang back to the moment on that, he also had the presence of mind to bring along two straws, the other for the serving of ice water I'd asked a female server for at the start. Butt covering counts for a great deal during a restaurant visit. A magnetic personality covers a lot of ground, too.\\nSome of you might be put off by a price point that totals up to the high teen range of cash/credit card expense. It's worth it. Good food prepped with eye appeal and taste bud appeasement usually is. Another Broken Egg Cafe doesn't add up to another broken promise of top-shelf breakfast eats in my book."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Good place.

Based on the size of the display cases, it doesn't appear that they have as large of a selection as Mike's but Modern has more of a mom and pop shop feel and the quality of their desserts are top notch. I love Modern's pastry fillings, especially the cannoli's, the best.  It's the perfect mix of cream and ricotta and the cheese is not at all overpowering. While Mike's can be somewhat of a tourist trap, this is definitely more of a place the locals go.  A trip to the North End is incomplete without a Modern pastry."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I had the yellow cream cannoli, which was delicious!

My office ordered lunch to go and no one was happy with what we got. The Pad Thai was too red and lacked flavor. Two people ordered rice dishes and neither was the correct dish. The pineapple rice had no pineapple, cashews, or flavor. The spicy basil rice had no basil or spice. The curry made one of my coworkers sick. Everything was very disappointing."},{"name":"Lee's Bakery","address":"4005 Buford Hwy NE, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This is the only place where I get my ban mi.

Our hotel was in Brookline right near the T-stop at Coolidge Corner, and on a chance on Yelp, Zaftigs came up as a suggestion. This became our breakfast stop all three days we were in town. As soon as you walk in, it feels like the neighborhood deli that you come to for food, friends, and family. We were greeted warmly each time, and seated quickly. Our breakfasts (and brunch for one of us) were mouthwatering. I had the corned beef hash on day 1, the pastrami scramble on day 2, and finished with the challah french toast. Sooooooo good. My one friend had a big-ol bowl of oatmeal and this bagel with the bestest herb cream cheese ever. My other friend had the salami and eggs, which were great. On the last day, we ate at the counter, and got to watch the morning prep for the Rueben sandwiches while the staff and I think one of the owners ran too and fro. It really felt like we were part of this extended crazy Jewish family...and I LOVED IT. \\n\\nWe ate breakfast while we were there, but the sandwich meats looked equally as tasty. Even if you're not in Brookline, easily worth a quick T-trip to check out this local stalwart.

I was surprisingly impressed by the food, service, and beer prices. We normally hit up a spot across the street but have lately been unimpressed. Anyway, we went to the Tavern and got the buffalo chicken pierogis, the buttermilk chicken sandwich, and a few beers. I was skeptical about the pierogis but they came out and were one of the best appetizers i've had in quite some time. They came out with a side of ranch and siracha mayonaise which was STRONG to say the least, but quite delicious. The buttermilk chicken sandwich was amazing. Lightly breaded and cooked to perfection. The fries rank among the top 5 i've every had. Their taste was good and the best part was the fact you didn't taste the fryer and whatever else has been cooked in their. Lastly, the beer. I just had a couple of domestics but they were cold, delicious, and inexpensive for downtown dining, the ultimate beer trifecta! \\n\\nBased on this experience, we will definitely be making return trips with friends before events at the Amway Center."},{"name":"Disney Springs","address":"1486 Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Man I wish there was one of these near Chicago!\\n\\nSuch a fun place to walk around, take pics, snack, buy trinkets, and eye candy watch.\\n\\nThe place is lit up and springs to life at night for an adult playground...\\n\\nThe restaurant choices are plentiful for all sorts of appetites.

No reservations here so be prepared to wait a bit or be strategically quick to snag a seat at the bar. \\n\\nFood: I ordered the breakfast special, an omelette with bacon, Chicken Apple sausage, pretty simple, but sounded delicious.

I think it is such a versatile place that is sure to please everyone in your party. It has enough of the Disney experience if you want to avoid the parks but still feel that Disney magic. I love the variety of restaurants. You can get delicious vegan pizza at Blaze, a veggie burger at Planet Hollywood, vegan pastries at Erin McKenna's or Sprinkles, falafel at Jock Lindsey's, or vegan shepherd's pie at Raglan Road. The list goes on! They also have some fun themed restaurants such as Rainforest Caf√© and T-Rex caf√©. Kids will love those places but note that they are not very vegan friendly. I also love how diverse their stores are. They have some of the typical stores you would find in regular malls like Sephora and Zara. However, they also have many unique places to shop like the Marketplace Co-op where you can find Haunted Mansion plates, a Tower of Terror dress, or Disney luggage. Mickey's Pantry has an amazing selection of loose leaf tea and herbs. We found the tea selection to be even better than the Tea & Spice Exchange. I also love the AMC on site. The dine-in theater is a great addition. I love being able to order soda or popcorn refills throughout the movie without missing any of the movie! While they do allow kids, the upcharge in ticket prices keeps it from getting too noisy. ;)  \\nThey have a new parking garage system that is great. It tells you how many spaces are left in each row.
