This is basically the overflow lot for the better restaurants on the block, when the wait times at the Lower Mills Tavern or Yellow Door Taqueria are too long to put up with.  Overpriced food served in a pretentious manner.  Service is decent right up until you get your food, then instead of actually spotting what is needed and taking care of it (i.e. filling water glasses, removing empty plates, etc.) you'll get an overbearing check-in every 15 minutes asking \\"do you need anything? (...like the bill, you should have finished eating by now, please leave)\\".I ordered a burger and it was a sloppy mess.  2 bites in and I had to resort to a knife and fork as the bun had completely dissolved into mush.  They also couldn't properly cook to order; as other reviews note the chef comes up a few minutes shy of how long the meats should have been cooked.  The fries were good though.Most of what my date got was left on the table and not entirely appetizing.  A heap of what looked and tasted like Cedars hummus alongside a pretentious and not entirely fresh looking array of accompaniments; gourmet peppers, baby carrots with the ends attached (so you know they're baby carrots) and indian naan...what's wrong with classics like sliced bell peppers, carrot sticks, celery, and pita?  If you aren't going to get good fresh unique ingredients, at least go with the basics and execute well.  The other dish was some cauliflower appetizer that had such an off flavor profile (garlic, honey, pickles, miso...so basically salty, bitter, sweet, tangy, sour, spicy and nutty, all thrown into one dish) that it only lasted 3 courtesy bites before being relegated to the corner of the table to be uneaten.The chef here clearly thinks if you get fancy and exotic enough sounding ingredients (aioli, fresnos, shishito, naan, black pepper honey, etc.) that it will distract the customer from poor execution and inflated prices."},{"name":"Sichuan Garden II at The Baldwin","address":"2 Alfred St","city":"Woburn","stars":"3.5","text":"Food is decent, some fairly authentic but certainly not as good as szechuan gourmet in burlington.Echoing some of the other reviewers, the owner was very rude when taking carry out orders over the phone, took the orders of a caller who called in after me just because i asked one question (how long will it take?), and refuse to listen to my complaint when i arrived in the restaurant (still being on hold on the phone!)\\nIf he can't do business fair and don't listen to customer complaints, he will lose business.\\nOr, if he does not have the client facing mentality, hire someone who does before he piss off all the customers.I would have given at least three stars for the staff who works there and the food but with the abundance of choices available, i don't have to put up with a rude owner."},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Only redeeming part of brunch today was our server, Tyler.

Tyler warned us that the bar was backed up. 35 minutes later our main dishes arrived, still no drinks, and no burrata. My first mistake was asking for the manager instead of complaining to Tyler directly. The manager comes over, immediately defensive, and claiming the drinks were late because \\"they make the Bloody Mary mix from scratch, and it's Sunday brunch so it's a very busy time for us.\\" I didn't realize they flew to Italy and handpicked tomatoes off the vine then crushed them by hand! He offered an incredibly insincere apology with more condescending excuses. I asked what he was going to do to make things right and he said \\"do you want me to cancel your drinks?\\"....... amazing. 10 minutes later the burrata and drinks make it to the table as we finish our main. Tyler thankfully recovered for his manager, comped our drinks and burrata (which the manager was obviously not too pleased about despite later trying to get credit for the comp) and apologized again. It's VERY obvious that this restaurant is a shit show. The hostess looked like she was about to cry, bus boys were frantically running around and all the guests were miserable.

From the bakery up front and the \\"hot selections\\" in the middle of the cafe, to the sushi and deli selections towards the back of the cafe, you will have a pretty hard time deciding what to try when you first get in. My recommendation? Start with one of their always-delicious soups and then continue your culinary journey from there. You will not be disappointed by how flavourful, filling, and, oftentimes, healthy these things are.Now, the \\"par for the course\\" things: seating can be a little limited. So, if you are expecting to just walk in during lunchtime (or almost anytime, really) and not have to search for a seat, I encourage you to lower your expectations. Also, some patrons may balk at the prices. Perhaps it's my own privilege of being able to regularly eat healthy foods (and I recognize that privilege) but MSC is actually very reasonably priced for the area.

A no-man's land of sorts lays directly in front of the order bar and the bathrooms (nicely separated for men and women near the center of the room), it's most likely the performance space, as Coffee Revolution does promote local music/performances on a regular basis. This is a somewhat isolated coffee shop tho, as it closes early each day, or maybe the owner has enough other things to care for and doesn't need the money?

I finally made it out and decided to try it with my family. The menu was good and the wait wasn't too long thankfully.They have a good variety of menu options for breakfast and lunch. Half of our party got breakfast and the other half of our party got lunch. I ordered a patty melt with fries and a coffee. I'm happy to report that the patty melt was very tasty and the fries were excellent and well seasoned. Unfortunately for my family their breakfast was not good. They ordered the chicken and waffles. When it came to the table it looked great. The chicken was abundant and the waffle was large and fluffy looking. Unfortunately the waffle was almost raw in the middle. It was very spongy and rubbery. It had no flavor and it just was a complete bland waffle. The chicken was just OK. For the type of seasoning they used which tasted a little herbaceous it was a strange choice for A waffle. Maybe they should have used a different seasoning profile that made more sense. If a restaurant attempts chicken and waffles they better know what they're doing because what they served us was like  what Taco Bell is to Mexican food. That waffle better be flavorful and that chicken better be crispy, juicy, and well seasoned. Which none of those were for this dish. If you can't do it right just don't do it. Portland has a way of trying to artisanlize and hipsterize things that are just great on their own but they end up messing it up. I mean how do you mess up a waffle?Even though my meal was good there is one thing I did not really appreciate about this restaurant. They advertise that they are a gratuity free establishment which means that they supposedly pay their staff a living wage which means that the cost of tipping is not passed on to the customer. Well if that's true why do they impose a mandatory 20% gratuity on all orders?   In my mind that is tipping if you were paying your staff a living wage, the owner is paying the staff the living wage not the customers. I don't like being forced to pay for something especially if the product is unsatisfactory or the service is unsatisfactory. That is still tipping and a force one. As far as the service it was average. Our waitress seemed a bit overextended but she was friendly.All in all it was a average experience a bit disappointing for my family because they could not enjoy their meal. Also disappointed at a forced gratuity was a bit annoying especially since that's a direct contradiction to their non-tipping policy.I'm glad I was finally able to try the caf√© but I don't think I will be back. I hope in the future they get better at their waffle making and put a little bit more thought into their policies around gratuities. At least make it optional or just raise their prices a little."},{"name":"Anti Social Ice Cream Co","address":"6550 Comanche Trl, Ste 109","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Really cool spot at the Oasis.

This was my number one gripe with this place. Now, these words are coming from someone who has been to numerous AYCE hotpot places, most of which were quite good with excellent meat quality. The price tag for those places average around 35. The broths for those places were also customizable, so you could decide how you want to flavor your broths (there would be a seasoning bar that you use to make your dipping sauce, which would ultimately go into your broth if you were smart). None of that here. You get your spicy and your herbal one. The spicy one was actually quite funny because the main flavor profile was spicy...and ONLY spicy now that I think about it. Come on, where's the complexity?This place will grab a lot of money from these poor clueless college students for now, but in time people will start to realize, \\"wow, this isn't so great after all.\\"...except not, because there is no other hot pot place nearby in ATX that I know of.

Hadn't been there for years, but had a restaurant.com g/c from years ago (more on that later).** Perfectly quaint and quite tasty! **Many other reviews were SO bad that we just HAD to check it out! We lowered our expectations and set off amidst snow showers to Teele Square.Wifey says restaurant is \\"cute\\" and \\"quaint.\\" No sign of the dreaded big screen TV; no karaoke or comedy night that *we* could see... Warm atmosphere, specials on a big chalkboard, reasonable prices (GOOD prices for beer/wine, btw...).Waiter was spot on [ed. note: Yo, Marvin!]: pleasant, knowledgeable, and had an opinion (helped wife choose ravioli bella over the monkfish special--and she was quite glad of it). I had the pollo portafoglio (\\"pan seared chicken breast stuffed with prosciutto, gorgonzola cheese, served with sauteed seasonal vegetables\\"): Yum! Chicken was tasty but, perhaps even more importantly, the side veggies were not just some afterthought: grilled peppers, squash, spinach (I dunno... veggies!) that were REALLY yummy. I appreciate it when direction is lavished upon the supporting cast.Older guy behind the bar kept greeting folks as they came in (I dunno whether he is the fearsome owner highlighted in other reviews--if so, maybe he, uh, you know, got some help or something... meds maybe. This guy was perfectly pleasant).So: Wifey and I had a romantic evening on a snowy night in a warm (in both senses) environment among pleasant ppl and tasty food.I read elsewhere that they have a new chef: looks like they have a new vibe and a new 'tude to go with him. I say give 'em another go!Now, about that coupon...SoooOOooo... When we sat down, we had pulled out a  restaurant.com gifty from, apparently, 2007 (hey, I'm cheap AND organized...). Rest.com's \\"never expire\\" (according to the cert)--and the waiter indeed called it in (you get an email 'bout that), but Amelia's pulled out of the rest.com biz last year and would not honor the coupon. Not *quite* complaining (called rest.com and they supplied us with a brand-spankin' new  $25 cert good for any of their offerings) but... well... it kept things from being perfecter. Prices seemed reasonable but I'm a portion pig, and while my wife was satisfied (and, hmm... so was *I*, really), I like there to be leftovers. You know, for the kiddies. So... 60 bucks for dinner, 2x Grolsch and a tiramisu & tip? Yeah, I guess that's okay (wifey is over my shoulder reminding me how tasty it was and, seriously, how well-pitched was our waiter), so, okay.

I love it! But sadly I will not get the chance to taste anything. I have been here an hour and this is the first interaction with my server- she did not give her name or apologize for our wait. She advised they were told to hold putting in orders. This information would have been very useful when we first arrived. The music is nice, the DJ is cool, the food looks good from afar, but all I've gotten is a decent Bahama Bay drink. However, the advertised $6 premium drinks does not apply to the signature drinks listed within the menu, and there was not a separate drink special list so after waiting and getting no food I also got a bill twice as high than what I was expecting. I get that they're new establishment, but if things are not going smoothly, communication is the difference between a redeemable experience and this s**t show of a waste of my time.

Choo-choo! Or, rather, chew-chew,* at this train depot turned restaurant and bar! Since I'd read many a yelp about the Depot before actually going, I was a bit hesitant when it came  to the menu, so I ended up keeping it simple. Very simple. First instinct was to get a turkey burger, but after a little Spanish Inquisition on our waiter, he divulged that he thought they were pre made frozen patties - and he gave the disclaimer that 'the more they're cooked, the pinker they get, so they tend to scare people.' Hence the disclaimer in case I got that one. Not really in the mood for a pink patty, I went with as standard as you can get - cheeseburger. This guy is made in the back, and it was a good one. Also, the housemade fries (yes, I asked about these too. . . I am somewhat of a fry connoisseur.) were all quickly inhaled, including the tiny burnt crispy bits. Good. Now on to this spot's selling point: the whole train depot thing. I'll let you know up front that I really like trains (not in a 'I collect trains' kind of way, but more like 'I think trains are romantic') - so, I'm immediately a sucker for the whole Depot thing. Plus, near my hometown, I grew up going to this OTHER restaurant called the Depot, so my mind was partially preoccupied by waxing nostalgic about my original time eating fries somewhere people jumped onto trains a hundred or so years ago.But despite that, I think anyone could appreciate the splendor of the space - very 'lofty' but in such an authentic way. They kept things simple (even the piece of artwork I was sitting nearby, was just a picture of, well, the depot.) and added some simple hanging globe lights. The bar and tables slicing the center of the space in half likely fill up on the weekends (I went on a weekday and it was pretty empty), and I can see myself sipping a boxcar* or dirty martini or really anything here. The menu prices are another plus of this place - it can be tricky to find a menu in the $8 - $15 range at a place you'd actually like to sit down and eat in Atlanta, so I was glad to see the menu in this range. The easy parking lot is a good thing, and the service was decent, too. I was pretty hardpressed to find anything too terribly wrong with the place, except for the pink turkey burger story, the fact that a side item alone costs $3.50 and that I couldn't stay for another glass of wine.\\n* Please pardon the puns.

We both ordered the Enchiladas blanca ($7) and it took less than 10 minutes to come out. I ordered one chicken and one beef- the chicken had a good flavor but was a little dry. The beef was just ground beef but much moister. It's hard to pick which is better, but I'd probably go with the beef. We had a coupon for buy 1 lunch get one free; but the waiter messed up the bill when we tried to split the remaining $7 and billed it all to one card. We weren't too upset by it, but the manager came out and gave the guy he billed it all to a free voucher for a meal. The manager then came back, that he felt bad that he didn't give me anything- so I get a free key card for %10 future orders. The manager then came back a third time to give our other classmate (who had brought his own lunch and didnt even buy anything) a $10 voucher for grub hub. The portion size was a bit smaller than most Mexican places- but your stomach should not be so large as to not be full by this size. \\nBig Bonus for me- they give you GIANT glasses of water.The food was good, not great, not ground breaking, not something I will be craving.

The salt and pepper squid was a little disappointing, compared to other locations (such as Bobo Garden) with well cooked lightly breaded, flash fried Asian calamari. The snow pea tips seemed undercooked, slightly too light on the amount of oil. There was a undercooked crispness that you don't want in cooked snow pea tips.While Canton Cook II is very similar to Canton Cooks in menu, the quality did not seem up to the Canton Cooks standard.

The pork belly flavor and texture went really well with the crunchy bread. The sandwiches here are basically banh mi (Vietnamese sub) with different varieties of meat, the only different is you can get banh mi for $3-$4 elsewhere, while here, you're expected to pay at least double the price. That can be a con, however, the pork belly made up for it. The Coconut Tiger Shrimp rice bowl was also really good. I loved the toasted coconut sprinkled on top of the rice, which brought out an amazing aroma into the rice that made the coconut shrimp and the bowl as a whole much more tasty, but again, this dish would be normally be $13 if it wasn't for the grand opening that provided free lunch.

The beer/wine list was decent, lots of choices there.\\n My boyfriend and his father ordered the ribeye dinner, his mom ordered the shrimp skewers and I picked the chicken sandwich. I wish I could say how amazing everything was but unfortunately we were all very disappointed. \\n Their famous chili was LOADED in onions and had a sweet taste, not what I would expect for chili. Also, they don't have crackers for the soups/chili, which I found odd. Moving on, the ribeyes were not ribeyes, they were definitely N.Y strips. Either way, not medium rare like we ordered and had no seasoning.\\n My chicken sandwich was supposed to have a bacon aoili but there was nothing. A huge piece of chicken with no condiments whatsoever. Had to ask for mustard and mayo instead but it still was a no go. The shrimp were okay, the only thing that had flavor and was completely eaten.\\n What is sad is that, just like most of the other reviews, the service was great. The manager came out and wanted to remake both mine and my boyfriends dinner personally. Wasn't very hungry by that point but I could see he was trying very hard to make it right. Steak comes out and it's still not medium rare, but it's really a ribeye this time and has some seasoning. The manager let us know that the ribeye is the only steak that isn't seasoned with steak seasoning and he made it with steak seasoning this time...really? My chicken sandwich was basically the same but with a super sweet bacon aioli, just not for me.\\n All of the bartenders and the manager tried very hard to make it right.

I believe 90% of companies are honest and want to do right, and not just lighten your wallet.  However this location does not take responsibility for their mistakes, even when given multiple chances.  Besides the opportunity to rectify their mistake on day 1, the next opportunity required I make an \\"appointment\\"to meet the manager...my life does not revolve around a set order.  Second opportunity from head office resulted in a call I feel was genuine that passed the info to the franchise owner.  The franchise owner sent me what appeared as a cheaply printed form letter that did not say anything of substance and failed to apologize for their error resulting in cold food.  Bottom line the three $5 cards did not rectify a $40 screwup, did not result in their taking ownership, and underscores why I will take my business elsewhere.  Buyer beware, things are not as they seem, and although food is good when they get it right the first time.  Check your order, and \\"trust but verify.\\"  For a company claiming basis on Christian values, I am utterly shocked and disappointed, and my opinion is drop the claim unless your integrity and ethos matches.Bottom line.... Shame on you Chick-fil-A.... you screwed up good and lost a customer because after 3 tries you could not accept responsibility for your screw up... good job!  NOT!!!Original post to ensure you see the whole story.Ordered for four people to go.  Initially the order was provided in one bag...  thinking they were bringing the rest I patiently waited.  After several minutes the black shirted manager inquired if I needed something.  I explained the situation, and she examined the bag and my receipt she stated she'd take care of it.  She provided the second bag and I looked quickly and was on my way.  Turns out they \\"forgot\\" the second fry which I noticed half way home as I reached over to grab one.  Upon returning to the store,  it turns out the store policy is they will replace the missing fry, but will not replace the rest of the order so you leave without fresh and warm food because they feel it is better you eat cold food because of their failure to get it right twice then to ensure their mistake does not become the customers problem.It is not that a company makes a mistake, because they will, but what they do to rectify it that make a company great or classifies them as a failure.

Sweet Cheeks is EXTREMELY OVERPRICED. The pork ribs, brisket, and sausage are pretty good. However all of the sides and appetizers are just plain bad. I don't say that about many places, but I am sorry...its the ugly truth. Now I have spent some time in the south, so I have had a taste of some real BBQ. I understand real BBQ cannot be found in the northeast so I am keeping that in mind as I write this review. And even still, I don't plan on making another trip back to Sweet Cheeks.What to order:\\n- Bucket of Biscuits with Honey Butter are pretty delicious I would recommend trying these out at least once because they literally just melt in your mouth. I just don't like paying 10 bux for a few biscuits which probably costs pennies for the business. Its like paying 10 bux for some bread.\\n- Farm Salad is actually pretty legit. If I went back, I would definitely get this again. I can't remember exactly what was in it but it was yummy. \\n- Mac N Cheese is one of the better sides to order. \\nWhat NOT to order:\\n- ALL OF THE SIDES: the coleslaw, potato salad, and BBQ beans are completely lack flavor. The BBQ beans do not taste like baked beans at all. They are made with black beans...who makes baked beans with BLACK BEANS? That's just weird. \\n- The Hushpuppies are okay.Service: The service is alright. The staff is not very friendly. Value: The prices are just too high. The sides are all 7 bux and they basically have nothing inside them. Beans and potatoes are dirt cheap and I do not appreciate paying 7 bux for them. Putting the prices aside...the food just isn't all that good. If you decide to make a trip here, I would recommend getting a tray of ribs/brisket/chicken (pick one) with the farm salad and the mac N cheese as your two sides. I would give that dish a solid 4 stars and worth the money."},{"name":"Rice Bowl","address":"6 Hemenway St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Another Chinese restaurant that you can go to if you really don have any other option."},{"name":"Davenport's Ale House","address":"1260 Posner Blvd","city":"Davenport","stars":"2","text":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS PLACE!!!!!

Brought me back to Michoacan and my abuelita's recipes. I'm always hesitant to order tamales because most places freeze them so they dry up but nope, not this place. I saw them hand rolling the tamales in front of me so I decided to order one and it was the best decision I made that day. \\nThe tacos come with a good amount of filling (I only tried the birria which was very good) and the rice and beans were also super on point - not bland at all.

The chicken strips came with a heavy paste dumped on top so that flavor was weird too but the texture of the chicken was on point.  Tables are kind of close together, so mind your juices a flyin.  Sides were ok.  Mac and cheese and coleslaw were standard.  Overall, I love the fusion idea of NE seafood and Louisiana flavor, but this had me missing the gulfs crab.

(notice how all the other reviews are from the people ordering Milk Street, not necessarily people EATING Milk Street).So it's VERY convenient. What they don't tell you is that your guests are going to be eating is so bland and jellylike in texture, and loaded with fillers that your people will doze off mid meeting and wonder why they are chewing on baseless calories. Also it's expensive.  Let's go through a typical menu\\n1. Sushi platters are exciting for everyone! Until you realize the avocado is tasteless and the rice is overfill. You can have a more delectable and complex tasting at Costco.2. Chicken. You know the old saying, \\"well it tastes like chicken\\" but then again these folks have perfected the art of how chicken then doesn't taste like anything and functions as a vehicle for whatever sauce you spread on it. Makes you pine for even the fast food convince of Cane's Chicken or even the freshness of Cafe Luna. 3. Rice. There's a commercial with Uncle Ben's rice where the grains flake off mid air like happy little white flecks. Now imagine, a slop of brownish goop not quite risotto and not quite grainy so that in the end every bite basically tastes like starch thanks to the accumulate gelatinous film that each grain of rice carries --- which makes you full faster even if you don't know why. I think this is a way for them to save money on food. 4. Sandwiches. The sandwiches are generous but again, fairly bland. The chicken, the tuna, the ham, all taste the same. The bulk of the sandwich is made of the lettuce and tomato filler. It's not hard to make a good sandwich. Ask the people at Al's Cafe. Also $12 a person? You can get two sandwiches for that price at Al's5. See #4. Except swap the bread for cardboard.5. Desserts. They have some brownies which are ok.

I agree with other reviewers that they do not skimp on ingredients.  I'm old and still can remember when banh mi used to sell for $1.75 in California.

That sounds like an exaggeration but for all the hype and how much this restaurant was built up, I simply expected not just a good experience but an excellent one. What we got was pretty dismal. I would give it a ZERO if I could. As an out of state annual passholder, we frequent the parks and their restaurants and have tried pretty much everything. My experience at most disney dining places leaves me with a good taste in my mouth, knowing that I will likely return. That said, I'd been trying for months to get these reservations. I was calling daily hoping for a reservation during our family vacation in February. Atleast I know now that I don't have to worry about calling anymore. Not interested. We were lucky enough to dine there on Dec 2nd (an evening that also had Mickey's Christmas Party). Our reservation was for 5:55PM. As requested we arrived at approximately 5:35 PM to check in. I parked our stroller, put my 11 month old in a carrier, grabbed all of our stuff and took my 4 year old by the hand to check in. I was handed a buzzer and told that it would go off in approx 15-20 minutes and to wait on the bridge until then. When it buzzed, I should see the gatekeeper. The waiting... if you are going to have us all waiting on the bridge, please do us the courtesy of adding a place to SIT DOWN. I was taken back for my reservation at 6:25 so I stood for nearly an hour holding everything, including my baby.. all while trying to entertain my older child. Once we were finally brought back, we were seated in the main ballroom. To say it was loud is an understatement. The beauty and the beast instrumental soundtrack is pumped in at unreasonably loud levels, add to that the hustle and bustle of the guests packed in and i couldn't hear my children seated right next to me. On to our server (and the food). Unhelpful is one way to put it. If you are going to pass yourself off as a french restaurant and one that meets a higher standard, please train your staff. My kids were starving and since there were no rolls or anything (I'll address that later), I wanted something that they could consume while we waited for entrees. I ordered the meat tray (traditional charcuterie tray). It was brought out and dropped unceremoniously onto our table. No explanation of anything on it. When I did press the server I was told \\"It's like italian sausages and what not. It's not my favorite thing but if you like that kind of stuff...\\" Really? Teach your staff what is on that tray and to point it out to guests. This is prosciutto, this is sopressata, etc. Atleast it came with a warm baguette. We wanted something bread like. For our entrees, my daughter ordered the mickey meatloaf and I had the shrimp and scallops in puff pastry. To the credit of BOG, my daughter's meal was great for a kids meal. Probably the healthiest one she's had in any of the parks aside from maybe at Kouzzina. Mine was just dissapointing. After being touted by the gatekeeper, the person who sat us and my server as \\"The best thing on the menu\\" I felt I should try it. What I got was shrimp and EXTREMELY sandy scallops in a bland orange sauce inside what tasted like grocery store prepackaged biscuit dough. With every bit came the texture, taste and unpleasant **crunch**crunch** of sand. My daughter finished her meal with the chocolate cupcake and I had the lemon meringue cupcake. She said hers was good, I didn't try it but hopefully you didn't screw up a chocolate cupcake. The lemon meringue was a flavorless yellow cake filled with lemon filling (and a meringue that had come to room temperature and was already dissolving by the time it got to me). Toward the end of our meal, I noticed several tables around us had rolls. When I asked the server about them (since I hadn't seen them on the menu) he said \\"Oh yeah, i forgot them but then you ordered the meat tray which had the baguette so I figured you didn't need them.\\" About 75% of the reason I ORDERED the meat tray, was for the bread to give the baby and for a snack for me and my 4 year old. To be honest, the experience was miserable enough that I would have stayed to complain if it hadn't already been WELL into the Christmas party by that point. (The thing that I paid for seperate tickets to get in). On our way out, we decided to stop at Beast's study so my older daughter could take her picture with him. A surly cast member stopped us at the door. I could see the beast sitting in the study with the photopass photographer and no guests. SHe asked very curtly \\"Have you finished eating?\\" \\"Yes\\" \\"Well have you paid your bill\\" \\"Yes\\" \\"Oh\\" and then she moved aside. Again, I'm not usually one to complain but this experience was truly one of the worst dining experiences I've had PERIOD. Including every hole in the wall, fast food restaurant and chain I've ever been too."},{"name":"Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House","address":"9150 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Well, after studying the magical dinning menu the evening before.  We were super pumped to head out for dinner early Saturday evening. Upon arrival, the d√©cor was stunning, we were quickly greated/seated and ready to order.  I originally planned to go with the soup.  However our server and one of the managers highly reccommened the cheese steak eggrolls, so I opted for them.  Let back up and say that the bread/butter they place on the table when you first arrive....awesomeness!  hot, soft, and just pure tasty.  Now back to the eggrolls, not bad, not great, just ok.  As I write this review and snack on them as leftovers, I'd venture to say they tasted better today.Now onto my 8oz filet prepared medium served with potatoes.  Again just ok.  Wasn't a home run for me.  I enjoyed the seasoning which created a slight crusty and a touch salty, which I like.  But again, I was not wowed by the overall steak itself.  We also opted to \\"splurge\\" a bit and ordered the lobster mac-n-cheese which was a hearty portion with nice chuncks of lobster ($18).  It had good flavor, but needed a pinch of salt, and a longer cook time.  It would have allowed for the breadcrumbs to be a tad more crunchy and for the pasta/cheese to come together more.  Now the boyfriend really wanted to \\"splurge\\" and upgraded to the 16oz ribeye ($18) and opted for it to be served Oscar style ($10). His overall take was it was good but not great. As expcted with a ribeye it had it's share of fat, and the lump crabment was tender and tasty.At the beginning of the meal I asked our server to reccomnend a glass of cabernet and she presented the Del Frisco cab ($15).  I was not a fan.  So much so that I was not able to drink and she very kindly had it removed from the bill.As for desert, we both ordered the bread pudding, which we gave an A+.  Perfect portion, not to sweet, just right.  After dinner I often enjoy a nice B&B, not that night.  It was no where close to the others I have enjoyed.  Not sure if it was the type of brandy they used or if they did not use enough, but it was a bit rough.Overall, I really expected to be blown away after the great reviews from family, friends, and fellow yelpers.

Not bad, right? Even cheaper than Panda Express! The food got to me in about thirty minutes still hot. Fried rice: As you can tell from the pic, the fried rice isn't what you traditionally think of as fried rice when you order it from an Asian restaurant. It was more like white rice mixed with soy sauce and egg and nothing else, but tbh I was down for it. It was way more moist than fried rice you get most places, and I actually liked the simple flavor. Just know that it's not going to be what you're expecting.Sesame chicken: The meal came with a ton of sesame chicken with a few pieces of broccoli. The sauce and breading on the chicken was good, but it was all dark meat chicken and was kinda gamey tasting (but still good for the price). Wonton soup: DO NOT GET! I can't complain that much because it came free, but it was literally just straight water with shredded iceberg lettuce and a wanton (which was disgusting and I normally like wantons). Overall, everything is what you'd expect for the price. It was a large quantity of low-mid quality food that got to me quickly and still hot. I'll probably do Panda Express instead next time, but I'm still glad I found it.

The seafood hotpot was chock-full of giant shrimp, scallops and squid, with veggies. The beef was my least favorite... I think I might have gotten a chewy piece, but everyone else seemed to love it.

I'd go so far as to say it's the best option for excellent beer in Cambridge/Somerville, if not for the fact that I crave variety more than anything and CBC only serves it's own beer.

First couldn't get any service at the bar so we decided would be better to get a table, service was even worse from there. It took 22 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us then 25 more minutes to get the bottle of wine we ordered.

Chicken tacos arrive and when I tell you it was like taking a bite out of the  Sahara Desert they were so dry. Entrees arrive 2 of us got Steak Frites and a Grilled Salmon, mind you crab rolls have still not arrived. In the middle of our main course oh here comes our crab roll appetizer, more like dessert. My friend picks one up goes to take a bite but before he can has to throw it back down on his plate because the ammonia smell coming from the crab.

The good: friendly staff, clean space, portion size, sauce options, flavor profile. The okay: salad lettuce is pre-dressed making it too oily, extra oil drizzled over the hummus is unnecessary and false advertising that the falafel is healthy. It is deep fried. Glad I tried it but I knew it wasn't a healthy lunch. Don't get me wrong, it tasted really good but the added oil makes for a heavy lunch. I was in a mild food coma afterwards. There is nothing bad to say. Just good and okay. There is a lentil option, making it healthier. I would like to see plain lettuce instead of pre-dressed. Solid 4/5.

Ale is my paramour; Barley's the tempter. It has been a few years since I tried the ales here, rich and flavorful brews made in vats below the bar. Although I've had ale before that fated day, I was a faithful lager man. Coming here, the occasion of my initial review ( my third ever on Yelp), ended my relationship with the bottom brewing beer. Since that day, I have been moonstruck by various types both local and imported. Irish thick droughts the exception, I am almost exclusive to ales now.  Even though there are several breweries in Columbus and elsewhere, Ohio with top yeast brews that I adore just as much, I consider Barley's as first among equals. Ranked at the top of my ale chart is their striking Scottish Ale.It was the Scottish Ale that attracted both Mike G and I too Barley's once again. I beat Mike there ( since he is a slow, aging man and I am young and nimble ;-)) so I decided to try Hoptoberfest, a seasonal ale. It was very good. Sweeten down a notch by the hops, it was reddish, heavy, and activated diverse taste buds. Later, we both ordered the Scottish, a must for anyone who wanders in here and drink under the classic white molded ceiling and the surrounding slick woodwork and brass trimmings. This ale is redder, a tiny more bitter than my first. This brew seems near a pale. It so flavorful, cold, and blasting that it makes me desire it just writing about it. No wonder it has been on tap for over 20-years. Food here can be inconsistent, but there is a catch. The fluctuation is from five-star food to four-stars. My original review gave too high accolades for their dishes. Several other trips have found lesser meals. But still, the food here is great, no matter if they hit the top or fall short a star. This trip I had a pork sandwich, the Cuban Sandwich Crisis, featuring pork loin, ham, and pulled pork. The loin and ham was highly done, and smoked delicious flavors. The pulled pork was acceptable and added to the heart clogging goodness. The swiss and a IPA mustard topping the sub solidified it into a whole, accenting the flavor. It was five-star. On the downside it is too small; I felt it needed to be a bite or two bigger to be a full meal. I am not one to ignore the economics of this, at $11-$12 dollars the quantity is justifiable. I would pay an extra dollar for a bigger Crisis. The bartenders and servers here are professionals. That is the highest compliment I can make. They know the product, are always in a great mood, and have impeccable timing. They are building a barcade upstair. I wonder if that is a mistake, a clash of cultures. This bar seems more uptown, cosmo than young adult funland. We will see. Barley's is a fav of mine, a place in an attractive space in an attractive spot in town, and a destination for anyone with the hots for hops sweeten ales."},{"name":"Thornton's Fenway Grille","address":"100 Peterborough St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Eyes, Eyes,Eyes !

Because the wait for the patio was a bit long (30+ min), we decided to sit inside. They seated us upstairs overlooking the restaurant. We decided to order the crabcake benedict, the cobb salad, and I had the veggie sandwich. The eggs benedict looked awesome, and my friend said it was excellent. Same for the cobb salad. One thing I'll definitely give to Stephanie's is that when they say it comes with avocado, it comes with avocado. The salad had huge chunks of avocado in it (probably at least a whole avocado, if not more). The veggie sandwich was excellent, but it was SO messy! It came with a bunch of different kinds of diced, roasted veggies (squash, zucchini, eggplant, red peppers, arugula, and mashed sweet potatoes) and was topped with goat cheese and a sour cream avocado sauce. I'm not sure how to describe the sauce, but whatever it was, it worked. The bread was crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. While the sandwich was excellent, I felt like they could have put more effort into the side salad. It was just mixed greens -- nothing else. The service was average. Not terrible, but also not great. It could have been just our server on that particular day, so I won't fault them too much for that. Regardless, I'd go back.

The subtle fusion of sweet and savory splatters onto the tip of my tongue before the flavor dissipates, trickling throughout my mouth until it disappears in one quick gulp. Endorphins--those demanding creatures--fire in my brain. They clamor for more. Is it strange to crave a dish so strongly? Normally, yes. But at Kong, fine dining and unfiltered bliss merge into one, seamless experience.Eating at Kong is more than just a meal. It's a journey--and like any journey, no leg of the trip is predictable. Uncertainty, anticipation, and above it all excitement creeps down my spine the minute that I open Kong's glass doors. Like Kong's combination plates, the doors are murky and the shade of soy sauce. On some days, the questionably white server with a Harvard baseball cap will seat you, brusquely, without eye contact and with an uncaring motion of his hand. On other nights, stumbling night-goers from the meth lab--umm, nightclub--upstairs will convince me to turn back around, back the way I came. Ordering at Kong is a game of guesswork. Their menu of 100+ items, each dish named more vaguely than the last, leaves the customer with more confusion than appetite. Then the waiter arrives. Sorry, did I say waiter? My bad. What I meant to say was part-time chef, part-time bickering Chinese woman, who will take your order with the air of a kid being asked not to run at the local pool. On rare occasions, she will demand that you tip her more this time than you did the last, and then \\"accidentally\\" slash you left arm with her pen before proceeding to rub off the pain mark with the tip of her index finger. \\"Oops, so sorry!\\" she says. Rub rub.These may seem like undesirable characteristics of a restaurant. However, this could not be further from the truth. At Kong, everything--the service that would put the local county jail cafeteria to shame, the food that would make that same penitentiary seem slightly more appealing--defines what may be one of Cambridge's must-visit locations.So why did I rate this restaurant 4 out of 5 stars? Not the food, nor the service. The truth is this: I've been there five out of the past seven nights, and I can no longer bring myself to make eye contact with that Chinese woman.

It is a good restaurant with ample seating. Food: I ordered the Crispy Pork Gyoza and the Kara Tsuyu Tsukemen. The gyoza was tasty, but it was a bit oily for my taste. The portions of chashu pork and toppings in the tsukemen were good, and the spicy soy tauyu was okay. The spicy soy tsuyu lacked the spicy kick that I was expecting. Service:The staff are very friendly and polite. Whenever a customer walked in, they would always ask if they have been to the restaurant before. They also asked if they had any questions regarding the menu or how to order and be seated. Ambiance: They have the kiosk ordering stations, so everything is automated. For a ramen restaurant, it's actually quite large. It's a good place to come if you have several people in your party, and they have outdoor seating (if the weather permits). If you have visitors in town that are craving ramen, this would be a cool place to go due to the seating availability, service, and the other surrounding restaurants/photo ops."},{"name":"Cambridge Brewing Company","address":"1 Kendall Sq, Bldg 100","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Great local brewery that has been putting out great and innovative beers for over 25 years.

I would admit that I actually like Ru San's and I do come here for sushi whenever I am craving. Yes, sometimes their sushi could be better in the way it tastes as how fresh it is and also the presentation depending on who makes the sushi rolls. Sometimes the rolls are not tight enough and I find my sushi rolls falling to pieces. I do agree with fellow Yelpers when they say that the sushi is better when it's not busy as I think the sushi chefs have more time to focus on making rolls and attention to detail. The service is pretty good and the servers do check up on you throughout your meal. The hostess are very nice and friendly. Everyone is very personable. FOOD:\\n- Rising Sun: this roll has got to be my go-to order and my favorite sushi roll. It's a large roll so each piece will be two bites each. In this roll, you will find salmon, tuna, asparagus, and cream cheese wrapped in seaweed and rice. It is then coated with sliced wonton wrappers and then slightly fried. I love this roll and I can't get enough of it.\\n- Calamari: I'm a fan of this appetizer and it's great for sharing. They are generous with their calamari. I love it with their seafood/yum yum sauce.\\n- Chicken Fried Rice: their chicken fried rice is pretty good and it's not dry at all. They don't overuse the soy sauce for this dish as you can tell by just looking at the fried rice when it comes out.NEW YEAR'S EVE - AYCE Buffet\\nFor New Years Eve, I tried their All You Can Eat (AYCE) Sushi and Hot Foods Buffet all for $30. I would rate it 3.5 or 4 / 5. There are a lot of sushi roll options in this buffet (including my favorite roll, Rising Sun). They also have crab legs, clams. fried rice, calamari, desserts, and other items. I didn't rate it higher because I felt that they used a LOT of tuna instead of salmon. I understand tuna is cheaper than salmon, though. I was a bit disappointed.  The hostess told me that they do the AYCE option for NYE as customer appreciation. At the end of your meal, you will receive a gift bag of Japanese snacks (I would say this all is worth maybe $5). You also get a free glass of champagne at midnight to ring in the new year if you stay at the restaurant long enough for midnight. As for reservatrions for this NYE AYCE buffet, they will only allow reservations for parties of 5 or more guests. Anything lower than 5 guests, will just depend on first come, first served. Luckily, we were seated immediately after we entered the restaurant at around 8:15pm. I would consider doing Ru San's AYCE NYE again next year; however, I will look into Nori Nori's buffet as well. Overall, I will continue to dine at Ru San's Buckhead as I do like this location and do have a huge list of sushi rolls and lots of other options as well.

I went on a referral from a friend, so I assumed the food would be great. And it was. Quite honestly I thought the Shakshuka was very good. The service, however, was unacceptable.I had a reservation for 1230 and showed up on time.  When we arrived, we were told that sitting outside required a different host. Totally fine. We went outside and sat down. 15 minutes went by before we were greeted by a server who brought us a single napkin for 2. We waited another 8 minutes for water. The weather, at the time, was becoming more and more chilly. During this time, I kept getting texts reminding me to check in with the host. I was confused as I had already checked in with them. It kept saying \\"your table is ready.\\" Before long, the weather had become really cold, so we went inside to see if they could seat us there. Bear in mind we had ordered drinks, which had not been delivered, and it had been over 10 minutes since we saw any sign of life from our server.The host made it a big deal but let us sit inside. Our previous server delivered our drinks coldly, with a not-so-subtle attitude that would've been better suited for a pre-teen. From then on we had no server. Nobody checked in. We were delivered our food without utensils and napkins, which we had to ask for. We were planning on buying multiple drinks but settled for one since we'd probably die of old age before they ever returned to the table with a new one.We had to ask THE HOST for our check. He ran the card. They're lucky I tipped at all, and that's coming from someone who, as a previous server, always tips 20%+. The reason I actually tipped was for the bussers, who I didn't want to stiff because they were hustling the entire time. I will never come back.

I ventured almost 600 miles from home to come eat my Birthday Ramen here. I honestly don't know if I need to say more about this place. I obviously really love this place regardless of the price. A quality bowl of Ramen will set you back $14 and with a tasty cocktail another $12 or more. The cocktails are as good as the ramen, so don't miss out on this. Also, for the Spicy lovers, go for the Yuzu Ratan Ramen. My boyfriend orders this same one every time. What makes this place unique is the clean, healthy, and bright taste of the yuzu broth. It honestly puts me in a happy mood. The flavors are all so well balanced in your mouth like your favorite song to your ears. As I am very sensitive to MSG, it is rare for me to be able to enjoy any soup broth along with my noodles. I have drank all of the broth and no overly thirst feeling afterwards.

The beers are okay, but not ones that I'd necessarily seek out. Same goes for the food, it'll fill a need if you're really hungry, but it's not particularly memorable.And, unfortunately, CBC's size is not only a strength, but one of its biggest weaknesses. The bar just isn't big enough to handle all the customers when it's even at 50% capacity. And they usually only have one bartender working, even during busier hours.Between the long wait times, the forgettable food/drink, and the fact that there are tons of great alternatives just a short walk away, I can't get behind CBC as a place I'd seek out for myself or my friends."},{"name":"Finn McCool's Boston","address":"200 High St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Sunday is all about Eagles football.

Waited 40 minutes for a carryout order. The (only) person preparing the orders somehow lost my ticket (this is after waiting for 30 minutes). After she realized, rather than expediting my order, it was placed behind the already long line of orders. Another 10 minutes goes by and I ask for a refund, she turns around and tells me she has my order in hand. She had an order alright, but it wasn't mine. So not only did I wait 40 minutes for something I didn't order, some other poor soul likely got screwed too. Here's a tip, maybe take 3 of the 4 associates you have giving people samples and have them help prepare the actual orders.

I've been coming to the Diesel Cafe since 2005. The staff is always friendly and enthusiastic and the spacious seating lends itself to extended work sessions. The coffee is decent but nothing to write home about. The background music is always fantastic. However, I have noticed that over the last several years the prices have really shot up. My special self treat is an iced mocha. When I went to pay for it today, I didn't get too much change back from a $10 bill (after a tip). Later my bagel and cream cheese + hot tea came to just over $9. I really do love the vibe here, but I worry it is starting to exclude an economic class that used to be counted among its most enthusiastic supporters. I first came here as a social work graduate student and now as an adjunct professor. I know that inflation is real, and I also appreciate Diesel's charitable work and commitment to social justice. But I suspect some of this upward price drive reflects changes that are happening in the community. Same with their sister shop in Union Square. I fear they are helping to drive gentrification by catering their menu to a demographic that is not the same as it used to be. Of course there isn't great solutions to this but I would offer them this advice: Diesel, could you offer more affordable food and drinks on your menu? You can keep your $10 sandwiches and $5 drinks for the luxury condo patrons. But I would visit your shop 5 times as often if I could purchase your food and drinks without having to check my bank account to assess the damage. Maybe even smaller-sized drink options or half-sandwiches?

Now, that's not to say that that's the only good thing going for Samurai Sushi on Fraser. I've been going to this restaurant for a few years, mostly with my dad who lives nearby. Needless to say, It's a convenient location to go to when sushi cravings kick in, and for affordable prices at that. While there is no dedicated parking for the restaurant, there is plenty of street parking all around. Once you enter the restaurant, you can be expected to be greeted by one of the waitresses who are almost always polite and friendly. After placing your order at the till, you are then expected to find your own seat either at one of the limited tables or at the bar. Tea or water is self serve here. The restaurant overall isn't super clean, but it's clean enough and is kept in good working order. It's probably just the decor and lighting that makes it seem like that.Service here is quick and efficient. The food is mostly what you would expect of a sushi chain - the taste is exactly what you would expect and so are the ingredients. The \\"fresh\\" frozen fish is actually really good, and one can never go wrong with ordering any sashimi dishes. Again, one of the biggest draws to this place is the humongous servings. For example, when you order the sashimi appetizer which is two pieces of tuna, two pieces of salmon, and one piece of tai, for less than $10.00, I would not be surprised if these pieces laid out side by side covered the surface area of a person's hand. Ginger and wasabi here is pretty standard, nothing special. Other favourite dishes of mine here are the spicy chopped scallop roll and the Alaska roll. The spicy tuna roll here is pretty mushy so you might want to avoid that. Tuna sashimi here, on the other hand, is a must-have!Bottom line: if you want sushi, you're hungry (and I mean HUNGRY), and your wallet's feeling a bit light, come here to eat.

She invited me to choose my table and didn't seem phased at all when I asked her if I could move about 10 minutes later when I saw one I liked better.I had the BLT - with house smoked bacon, and locally sourced tomatoes and lettuce on batard bread. It was a) delicious and b) enormous. Niece and her boyfriend each had the fish sandwich with fresh, beer-battered haddock - and loved it. All sandwiches are served with hand cut chips or arugula salad. We all chose the latter and  enjoyed the balance of the delicate dressing with the peppery arugula. We all left satiated and with half sandwiches wrapped up for later.

We just finished our second visit and while the location is stellar the food did not match the location. I had swordfish in a pepper crust that tasted like it had almost too much salt on it. Had the seasoning been a drop stronger I would've known for sure that it was over seasoned. Given the trend on heavy seasoning today I wasn't 100% sure that the over seasoning was just wrong. But it sure was a close call. And my partner had a lobster roll again and the lobster roll was salty and the salad accompaniment was crazy over salted. Also it took 45 minutes from the time we ordered our food to have it served. That's just too long. This place has a way to go to live up to its ambition.

Ordering a few dishes will definitely satisfy two people.  The menu offers so many different options, so take your time.  Everything looked fantastic.The crab rangoons were a nice little staple to order. It was chock full of delicious cream cheese with hints of onion and wrapped in half-soft and half-crispy shells. It was excellent.  Not too heavy or filling, it was the right amount. An order of tangerine beef and a crispy lemon chicken were next.  Covered in a tangy and sweet sauce, the tangerine beef was scrumptious and nicely cooked.  The flavors that came together were perfectly matched.  The crispy lemon chicken was lightly battered and not at all heavy. The lemon sauce combined with the chicken brought forth the most memorable tasting experience, truly lemony and with hints and pockets of sweetness.  Bringing both sauces and meats together was actually a happy accident.  Throwing some nice, soft rice in the mix was an added bonus.  All the flavors and all the dishes came together nicely.  Even by themselves, each of them stood out as a satisfying entree of sweet, tangy and citrusy goodnessAgain, take out was only experienced, but it spoke volumes of how great the restaurant experience could be.  This place offers great Chinese food that doesn't overwhelm you with deep-fried whatevers and questionable whosits and gives you enough to get your fix.

The Kobe Menchi Katsu on the other hand, absolutely bomb: super-flavorful frikadellers coated in a slight brittle mix of eggs, flour and bread crumbs. I've ordered Tonkotsu Ramen, the thin noodles were perfectly firm to the bite and a nice balance to the thick Tonkotsu broth. The milky and rich stock was intense and deeply flavored, you can taste the pork bones have been simmered for awhile for the marrow to be released. Service was friendly and committed.

Most of them were over salted, lacked any depth and were short on flavor. The New York sour cocktail I had was not good at all. I've had great New York sours before. Theirs here was completely bland and I couldn't even taste the whiskey or wine.As far as what we ordered: Lamb tartare - bland, kale salad - over salted, pork pozole - over salted and zero depth (just salt and cumin flavor, no pork), hot cakes - over salted, carnitas lamb - not very juicy and low on flavor, empanadas - over salted.

Full stop.IT'S THE SUSHI, STUPID!When everything is said and done, wouldn't you rather enjoy superior sushi over superior wallpaper, lamps, background music, or wait staff?  I certainly would.  And I don't consider Musashino's decor, music, wait staff or average wait distractingly bad (but yes, there is certainly better to be had here in Austin) whereas I deem Musashino's sushi the absolute best one can get in the greater Austin area.Smokey's (owner and head chef) sushi has not been topped in the twelve years that I've followed the sushi bar micro-cosmos of Austin.  With every high-end sushi bar opening I was prepared for a new heir to Smokey's throne:  Umi, Kenichi, Uchi, Maiko (yes, each one of those four initially attempted to position themselves as the new best sushi bar in town, respectively, as bewildering as that might strike you, dear reader, in this early spring of 2007.)  It never happened.  Musashino still reigns supreme.Recommended:  O'Toro and Kama Toro nigiri, Uni nigiri, Monkfish Liver nigiri, Shima Zushi sashimi, Saba hand roll, Spicy Mussel hand roll, Evil Knievil roll, Futo Maki, and of course Omakase (chef's choice.)Not recommended: neglecting nigiri, sashimi and hand roll selections in favor of rolls, rolls, rolls, and nothing but rolls (sadly I see too many people make that mistake.)  Make sure you order a balance of different types of sushi.  It'll cost you, yes, but this is where a top-notch sushi bar such as this one shines the brightest.p.s. The avocado kama appetizer (avocado stuffed with shrimp and crab, topped with spicy sauce) on Musashino's menu is a creation of Tyson Cole, now of Uchi, formerly of Musashino."},{"name":"Fujiya Japanese Foods","address":"912 Clark Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Grocery store that is filled with excitement and dream...I'm not sure why but when it comes to grocery shopping, I become more excited than shopping for clothes... I guess because grocery store is filled with infinity possibility - sauces that makes your food delicious like a magic, delicious ready-made food, funky miscellaneous stuff..This Japanese grocery store is located in relatively inconvenient area (far from skytrain station) but filled with gems. Cool stuffs that I found from here:Kaki Shoyu (oyster soy sauce) - This is one of the gem soy sauce in Japan. It goes really well with cold tofu and raw egg rice(If you're fine with raw eggs). Yuzu Juice - I have been looking this for ages!!!! I couldn't even find Yuzu juice in AEON(famous Japanese grocery franchise in Asia) and I finally found it HERE!!! It's probably one of my biggest find here. Wholesale Yakisoba noodle - Reasonable and convenient. It's cheaper than getting instant yakisoba that comes with sauce. Souzai (Side dishes) such as Ganmodoki, Saba miso, and all the cool stuff - This is similar to Izumiya in Richmond. Still lots of cool stuff. Yamaimo from Japan - I eat yamaimo raw, so I was looking for good quality ones! This yamaimo will be perfect to eat it raw!

I did a bit of research before hitting this place up with my friend, but not enough it seems. This was our first foray into Taiwanese food. Midtown Promenade was packed on a Sunday evening. We had to park over by the theatre. Luckily someone was getting ready to leave as I was driving around for a second time. The restaurant is quite small. Was shocked as I knew it was a really popular place. We again got lucky as another couple was about to leave when we arrived. So we just had to wait a few minutes to be seated.The menu didn't have tons of things that I was dying to try, but we were able to make a dinner out of it. We ordered sticky rice, the vegetable of the day (Chinese broccoli), pork belly bao, chicken bao, and beef noodle soup. The sticky rice was not at all what we expected. We expected a bowl of rice with the rest of the ingredients mixed in. This was a tower of food (see pic). It was quite impressive actually. I just wasn't a big fan of the sauce. The Chinese broccoli was also not as expected but yummy. I figured we needed SOMETHING green to eat. I wish the pork belly in the bao had been crispy. This was too fatty. Also, the knife they give you makes it very difficult to cut these in half. The chicken bao was better but the toppings were a bit too vinegary. The delight of our meal was the beef noodle soup. It was truly amazing. We both agreed we would go back and get this dish again. After returning home and looking at Yelp we found some other dishes that looked good, but we don't remember seeing them on the menu (hence how a posted menu would be useful- we could have had more time to review in advance).Servers were great. Loved the big water jug they put on the table so we could refill as needed. We were guzzling down water. For $2 you get a bottle of soda.

It was the perfect meal for me and my boyfriend last nite after having Cocktails at the Conservatory, although, I am hoping and praying there are even better taco trucks out there! \\nThe service was friendly and the girl spoke english very well. That made me happy since I was nervous to try and speak spanish to native speakers. I hate to butcher someone's language. I'll have to bite that bullet at some point, but not yet. Anyway, we ordered at the window and they brought it out to us at the tables. How sweet!?\\nOn to the food: I ordered a chorizo and carnitas taco and a chorizo torta because I had never had a torta before. Turns out it's just a sandwich. It was good, but I thought it would have been more mexicany (made up word). The tacos were good, but nothing special to me. I felt they were over all bland. Same goes for the carne asada burrito my boyfriend ordered. Good, but bland. He used to live in CA and has been to lots of taco trucks and he said he'd had better, but we are in OH so, that goes into consideration. I liked the verde sauce on everything and used all my lime wedges. I didn't care for the hot sauce...it tasted funny like seeds, but it had a good heat to it. I thought the meat itself was of decent quality and flavor and I apprecitaed the flavor profile especially of the corn tortillas of the tacos. They cooked everything to order.\\nI was very happy with the venue and meal overall and I want to try more trucks to find THE BEST. But, if I was around Victorian Village and wanted tacos, I'd definitely go to Junior's before Taco Bell or Mad Mex any day!

I sat at the bar where I immediately felt put off by the bartender. He had a bit of an attitude while he took my order. A second guy behind the bar though was very nice and provided excellent service. I ordered the Big Cheeks Tray [$24] with sausage and brisket and had the potato salad and collard greens as my sides. The sausage was pleasantly spicy and smokey. They were big, thick, and juicy [that's what she said] and were amazing with the hot mustard. The brisket was fatty in all the right places and you could really taste the char from the barbecue [or at least I thought so]. It was tender and exceptionally filling. I've never had collard greens before so I wanted to give them a try. They were in a vinegar which made them in a little too acidic. However, the pieces of pork belly more than made up for this fact. The potato salad was standard but solid. No real complaints there. I was so full by the end, I was just going to leave it and pay. The nice bartender however convinced me to pack up my meal and eat it on the train ride back to NYC. We chatted some and he definitely made my experience a memorable one.

They have 4 or 5 different kinds to choose from.  Most are chicken or meatless.  I opted for the chashu ramen which was the only pork version.  It took a little longer than expected to come out.  The broth was lighter than I hoped and carried hints of the familiar base used in the store bought ramen.  It was good, but I was hoping for a heavier bone marrow rich broth.  The noodles were appropriately firm, but obviously not house made.  There were 2-3 decent sized pieces of chashu pork, a slightly overcooked soft boiled egg, sliced wood ear mushroom (I think), green onions, and bamboo shoots.  It all came together as a decent bowl of ramen.  It also came with a strange spoon that was more like a mini square point shovel.The biggest knock of the the whole meal is that it was a $12.95 for the bowl.  I may be spoiled by large bowls of pho at good prices, but it seemed that the value of the ingredients and serving size was nowhere near the price.  I would have given a two star rating based on poor value combined with an ordinary meal, but I do love Edamame's sushi.  While I didn't have any on this visit, I would consistently give that a net 3 star rating.  4 for the quality and 2 for the cost because that is a bit overpriced as well."},{"name":"Mr Greek Donair Town","address":"1173 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"They renovated a few months back and the place is now cleaner & brighter.

My friends and I made reservations for NYE, and showed up prior to our reserved time (9:25pm). Our table wasn't ready, but it was NYE, so we expected a little wait. We were sat in the very back of the restaurant, near a door that was in use. Part of our table was in the aisle, and we had to ASK them to move it. As we sat, we plainly and blatantly heard the servers arguing over who would serve us because \\"we didn't look like we knew what we wanted\\". At this point, we are shocked because no one is making an effort to make us feel welcomed. Finally someone took our drink and food orders. The server prepared one plate of oil, and brought out bread, but didn't ensure we all had bread plates. My food arrived and I didn't have a place setting. My drink remained empty until I requested a refill. Then, there were servers literally arguing across the restaurant about who would clean what section. The service was deplorable. We could visibly tell that they did not want to work that night. I get it, no one wants to work on NYE, but if that's your assignment, please don't take it out on the patron with the ability to tip you really well. I've dined at the location in Buckhead and had an amazing experience. I'll stick to that location. I would advise you to do the same. PS: The food was actually good.

Had a 7:30 reservation, which had been confirmed twice, once by phone and the next time by email. I met my friend, a woman I've known for almost 3 yrs, by the bar, and then was escorted very nicely by the Maitre'D to our table.  We chose a a separate table, a couple of booths closer to the corner, for the reason that we wanted a quieter place to enjoy dinner together. The Maitre'D was very amenable to that and left us with our menus and wine-guide.It was a lovely dinner. I had the small clam chowder to begin ($6) and we shared rolls that were brought to the table. Of all the things that Bancroft & CO does well, the rolls aren't one of them. They seemed to be commercially made and not of outstanding quality. They were like small Parker-house rolls, but smaller and not overly flavorful. I ordered a glass of Pinot Noir and was delighted that it was an Oregon varietal that had both body and character. It was delicious. I called and was told that it was Avaraen - from the Willamette Valley.  Really, really good and worth ordering by the glass or bottle. Anyway, my meal was the Fish & Chips (I didn't feel like beef, because of the lateness of the hour) and it was fabulous. Panko-crusted, really generously portioned, and served with hot and fresh french fries. ($19).My friend ordered the larger Filet Mignon - with the home-made Hollandaise sauce. She ordered it medium-rare and it came out perfectly. ($38).  For desert, I ordered the Cheesecake ($10) and she ordered the lava-cake ($12) (there were fancy names to them, but that's what it was). Anyway, they were AMAZING deserts. My cheesecake slice could easily have been shared between my guest and me or between me and my three daughters. I didn't like the way that they serve the tea I ordered. It wasn't well done and needs to be re-thought. I was given a tea-bag and then they poured hot water over it, instead of bringing the steeped tea to the table, ready for me to pour myself. I would rate the experience 4.5 out of 5 - and the things that need to be corrected are easily fixed.

I have passed El Arroyo a dozen or so times on my trek down 5th street. I would look at the sign out front, usually filled with taunting sayings, changing with regularity. Sometimes touting the awesomeness of their happy hour margarita, sometimes talking smack to another person's football team. Clearly, El Arroyo was a place to check out. I arrived, found the place easily and then spent nearly 20 minutes trying to cross the road. No joke. There is no stoplight and the traffic is coming straight  off of the highway. I later found out that in order to safely cross the street there is an elevated walkway located at the back of the parking lot that crosses in the air to the other side of the street. Important to note. I arrived, excited about the dollar margaritas. I left an hour later, excited about the margaritas, but even more excited about the menu. You see, I'm a low carber. I eat meat. And lots of it. I order burgers without the bun, pizza without the crust and lasagna without the noodles ( well not really the last one, but isn't it a unique concept!) El Arroyo has seen the need for lo carb food and met it with flying colors! In addition to a normal Tex Mex menu they offer a huge menu of Atkins and low carb friendly dishes. Post a ridiculously delicious ( and unexpected ) meal of brisket and sauteed mushrooms, I headed across the sky bridge back to my car. Downside: the wait staff was not very friendly.

I usually park a block away and stroll over rather than to be stuck playing parking Tetris with everybody else! What I love about this place the most is the wide assortment of convenient and fresh sushi. I've been eating Fujiya's sushi since I was a kid and shopping here as an adult gives me the happy feels. :) Their prices did increased time after time but it's still very reasonably priced and their \\"famous $2.95 California roll\\" is still available to this date. My favorite choice is their tuna salad handrolls which you have to finish assembling youself. I remember when I was a kid I loved the idea of making my own handroll and I still do haha.

There were also some soft parmesan pitas and a few different salsas/dipping sauces.

It's sort of like the Christopher's of the western Cambridge end of Mass Ave--highly visible & clearly bearing the patina of a \\"neighborhood institution.\\"Frank's is great for what it is.  It is not Abe & Louie's, Grille 23 or Del Frisco's.  It is an old-school neighborhood steakhouse, adorned with signed pics of the full panoply of \\"Massachusetts- and Cambridge-famous\\" folks like Bill Weld, Stephen Wright, Lenny Clark, and, yes, even Elizabeth Warren (who proclaims in Sharpie that Frank's is the \\"home of the best steaks\\") (sadly, noted Cantabridgian John Malkovich is not represented).Frank's is not the home of the best steaks, but I had a good-to-very-good filet, cooked as I ordered it, and some great mashed potatoes.  While Frank's does offer a la carte sides like the fancy financial district outfits, it's also a \\"two sides\\" with every steak type of joint.  Iceberg lettuce abounds. Frank's seems to have a following.  There seemed to be a ton of \\"regulars\\" there when I dined early evening on a Friday--and they seemed to comprise the total diversity that is Cambridge--hipsters, old white Irish couples, etc., etc.  The dining room may have been fancy 15 years ago, but it's not without its charms:  it screams \\"this is an old family run establishment that people like, so why mess with the formula and the familiarity.\\"Service was informal and friendly--no one in a beige Nehru jacket who doesn't need to write down your order.  My waitress had probably been working there since high school 40 years ago.  She was pleasant, offered recommendations and laughed at my lame jokes.  This is all that I ask.While this not a grand steakhouse, Frank's works.  Prices are decent--I'd say you pay exactly for what you get here.  On occasion, I do have an absolute need for red meat:  as Frank's is just a 15 minute walk from home, I can certainly see myself visiting again--indeed, perhaps even often in the colder months."},{"name":"Chef's Playground Eatery","address":"170-12420 No.1 Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"4","text":"THEY CLOSE FOR PREPARATION TIL 5PM just so you know.

I have been told that the food is good (4 stars, not quite 5) but the restaurant itself is extremely pricey. Magical dining created a perfect chance to visit this place. Upon arriving and trying to valet our vehicle, we had to wait in the valet line for approximately 10 minutes. That was not a good introduction to the restaurant. There was no space, the line of cars extended onto i drive, and it was a little stressful. Once we parked and walked inside, I loved the decor. Large glass cases of wine, pretty and modern lighting/chandeliers, and a nice ambience. We went to sit at the bar awaiting the other members of our party to arrive (also stuck in valet), and the bar area itself was beautiful. A gentleman bartender took our order (did not get his name, but he had a nice accent), and he made an excellent old fashioned (this tidbit will come into play later).Once our full party was ready, we were seated in one of the spacious booths. Again, the decor here is fantastic, placemats, setting, lighting to create ambience. I ordered for the app the cheesesteak eggrolls. They were as good as other reviewers had said, and I felt a good portion for the appetizer. Next, the filet mignon, oscar style (crab, asparagus, and bearnaise). It was delicious. I tried to compare it to other popular steakhouses in the area. The steak was cooked perfectly and had a nice crust. Can't say I would like it more or less than any others, tho, except the oscar style addition ($10 more with magical dining) definitely added a succulent touch. The chateau potatoes that come as a side are good, but not fantastic. I think they needed salt. Finally dessert- ordered the bread pudding. For starters, again the portion was huge, especially when compares to other restaurants magicial dining dessert portions. And it was just down right good. Gooey where it was supposed to be, crispy and toasted on the top. Now, remember that old fashioned ordered at the bar. We ordered another from our waitress. When it came, it tasted completely different, watery. We told her and asked if it was made by the same bartender. She checked and it was not, with whoever making it adding in seltzer water (gross). They quickly fixed it, but I would hope they don't mess up staple drink orders that often. Then, when our bill came, they charged one of us the magicial dining prices and one not. Weird. They fixed it. Still, prices soar quickly. Even with the pre fixe prices, and we still spent about $130 for two. Our server was really great. She appeared to be young, twenties maybe. She was attentive and even bantered light heartedly with our group. We had a good experience overall, but probably our visits would be limited by cost, or reserved for special occasions."},{"name":"Taqueria La Fuente","address":"12198 SW Main St","city":"Tigard","stars":"4","text":"I came here for the first time today.

Although I stayed here roughly 4-5hrs, I never once felt rushed to leave in any way and in fact, was able to get refills on my tea and coffee! Got the peach tea, but got to try the hibiscus tea on my 2nd refill while there and both were delicious. Their iced coffee is also quite tasty, none of that bitter or burning taste here!I ordered the lunch combo of chicken sesame salad with the french onion soup and it came with a side of bread. The salad was delicious! Not sure what's in the dressing, but it's probably one of my favorite sesame dressings...not too oily or salty or \\"sesame-y\\", just a perfect light and refreshing taste! The onion soup on the other hand was \\"MEH.\\" A lot of soup with not a lot of onion or cheese in it, there were quite a few pieces of soft bread mixed in which made it better. The taste was average and I probably would not get it again. Also ordered the wildrice chowder soup and that was actually very good. Tasted like a mix of corn chowder with some wild rice mixed in...filling and warm!Although the prices can be a bit steep for salad and sandwiches, it's a good place to study if you nab a table next to a plug. Plenty of seating for all so there's no one really to shoo you away. The bathroom has a bathroom code on it that comes with your receipt to keep out hobos I assume??

In my opinion Trudy's is not what it used to be. When I came to Austin in 2006 it was one of my favorite places to go for breakfast. My eldest son and I would go to the central location (off 30th) every Sunday for our 1:1 time before his little brother was born. I would have Taco's with egg, cheese, and hashbrowns...this they still do pretty well, and now it's called Taco's Rico. Try one. So, back in 2006/2007 time frame it was my favorite place to go for my birthday drinks. However, popularity seems to have gotten the best of Trudy's. The drinks are no longer made like they used to be (there are plenty of reviews reflecting this reality), and they are seriously annoying about tracking your drinks. The last time I was there for a birthday (2010?) they shut us down after two cuban martini's, and guess what - our business went elsewhere. Their loss...I guess they just want to be in good standing with TAB.What is still good about Trudy's is the weekend buffet at the North Star location. They offer a wide variety of food for a very reasonable price, my kids love it, and it's a great way to sample many of their different dishes (some for better, some for worse). I go when the kids want to go, if it were up to me I'd go elsewhere. I'm not writing Trudy's off, but if I'm going out for a special Tex-Mex dinner this is not where I'm going to spend my hard earned dollars. I definitely won't take people here to party, the quality is just not what it used to be where the bar is concerned.

Or it could refer to old-school, the tried and true methods of smoking meat and the traditional sides.This once prolific restaurant (Cowtippers in Midtown was once a Hickory House location and where it gets its rustic, chunky wood d√©cor), has seemingly fallen prey to newer bbq restaurants.  Which is a little surprising because they do many things right.The meat in my chopped pork plate had a nice smoky flavor.  And, my ultimate barometer for judging barbeque restaurants, Brunswick stew, was spot on.  I like a thick stew full of diced tomatoes, corn and shredded pork and this fit the bill, not the thin gruel that passes for Brunswick stew at other restaurants.

There's no way I would let this experience slide without sharing! So my girl friend and I decided to meet my boyfriend and his friend at JR Crickets Camp Creek to watch one of the Playoff games. My boyfriend got there an hour or so early to ensure we would have a great space. He arrived to find that the owner was charging a cover to get in $7 per person. ALSO, he was charging for a table and each chair!!! Is that not the most horrid unprofessional crap you've ever heard??? Ok it gets worse. So before the game starts we run into another couple we knew and my boyfriend says oh you all can sit with us, just go see if they have 2 chairs to \\"rent\\" or \\"pay for\\". At that point they did not. So the guy grabs 2 chairs from the patio. Well once the game starts, the place is packed. The owner comes to the couple and tells them they have to get up out of the patio chairs. The guy offered to pay whatever the fee was they were charging for chairs on this particular day. The owner declined and told him the patio chairs were not for \\"rent\\". So this couple is standing up in front of the tv after the owner has asked for the chair from up under them. I was floored! This type of non service makes me not want to patronize black businesses! This would have NEVER happened up in north Atlanta! Embarrassed and livid the couple left the establishment. The man was a very successful business man that makes over $300k a year. My point is as a business owner how do you treat your patrons in this way!

Upon responding that I was, and completing my transaction, I was told to have a seat and that my name would be called when the pizza's are ready. I asked how much longer the pizza would take, and in reverse, was asked \\"well when did you order because our pizzas take 25 minutes\\". The people working at this pizza place are completely unprofessional, and look as though they definitely don't enjoy their employment. Lastly, The pizza wasn't all that great either. One of the orders, pepperoni with pineapple was EXTREMELY OILY, with the toppings falling off even before you picked a slice up. The Taco salad \\"ground beef\\" is not \\"ground\\" and when I had inquired about it, was told that their \\"ground beef\\" is different. TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE!

But Sweet Cheeks is on a different level. Sweet Cheeks is a true Boston Institution!Do start off with a biscuit. Those things have a reputation of their own! Just one (\\"onesie\\") is enough for a person. Trust me. There's enough carbs for a week. Served with sweet whipped honey butter. Just divine!For the main course, I recommend dropping the Frank Underwood ribs aspirations and going straight for the beef. Prime Brisket if hungry, Short Rib if seriously hungry! Be prepared for a tender, juicy, smoky flavor that just melts away in your mouth!  For something on the spicy side, I suggest the smoked monster wings with the hot rub. Sweet Cheeks has some good sauces but they're not needed for these options.Add that up and you're looking at a $30-40 price per person, excluding drinks. A steal for this level of cooking! The ambiance is noisy - a bit crowded, just a tad annoying. A small price to pay for a solid meal. There's usually a long wait but tables around the edges are first-come first-serve and that's how we usually roll. The dessert is probably good but I never end up having room for it.

Mother Nature had other plans for us tho as she turned her little heat lamp up to cook us at 95 degrees on the patio, turning us into a pod of pretty puddles.  It was quite comical to see us all trying to huddle in the 3 inch strip of shade on only one side of our table.  Ah, but Texas weather can be fickle, and so can I.  I decided to flit around the creative cocktail menu like a butterfly in flower nectar.  All of them are made with fancy Italian liquers I can't pronounce, except Tuaca.  Tuaca I am very intimate with and I was able to get a chilled shot of that for about $3.50.  Along with that shot, I sampled three of the drinks, with my fave being the Cinque Terre.  I also indulged in a couple of apps.  The zuchini involtini was tasty and unique, with a thin layer of zuchini wrapped in a coil and topped with mushrooms and a tomato sauce.  But the farm egg...oh, my.  So rich and gooey and yolky over a moist polenta.  I'm glad this was a small plate or it would be too much of a good thing.  All the drinks and the Antipasti apps are half off for HH!Our waiter, Frank, handled our large sweaty group with great finesse and great flirt.  Yes, a cutey with a pony tail and a nice smile and a little lascivious comment here and there will get a big tip from me (just the tip, tho :)And, finally, I must give special props to the Valet Boyz.  Somebody rear-ended my V_lv_ in the parking lot.  Not only did they stand menacingly over her until she left her husband's insurance info, but they were very forthcoming and great witnesses to my insurance after the the asshole denied the claim.

The holiday food they get from them is awful. I think the catering we have gotten from  there at work is what initially help skew and influence my opinion of them. I'm hesitant to improve my review thinking bout how bad that food is. What I've decided to do is just let that go and review only my experiences at this location. Now that I have lived in Central Texas for a few years I can see Bill Miller for what it is, a great local fast food chain with an awesome home cooked spin. Its not about anything the convenience factor here.So I gave them one star initially and I cant say that most of things I said are completely wrong. The BBQ is the worst you can get probably in the whole town. The thing is the Bill Miller markets itself a BBQ joint in a town that actually has the best BBQ in the world.If I think about Bill Miller in comparison to just about any BBQ in town it falls flat. If ignore their attempts to be a BBQ restaurant and treat them like a cheap fast food restaurant, which I would argue is what they are they shine!The BBQ poor isn't bad at all for the price and will make you much happier than anything you could get McDonald's, Jack in the box or Wendy's. The special that comes with two BBQ sandwiches and a side for 5 bucks is one of the best lunch deals in town. Sure the chipped beef might give you heart burn and  be a bit runny. Its still better than the other options at its price point. I get the chicken fried steak meal occasionally with rings in at just under 8 bucks and I daresay is not only not bad but actually very good. I always seem to have a wait a bit longer for the steak but it still falls into the fast food time frame and I know they don't cook it till I order it. That's right they actually cook me a fresh chicken Fried steak.. A quick trip through a drive through and I get pretty darn good Chicken Fried Steak! I started out writing this review with the intent of upgrading my one star review to a three star. By the end of writing this I decided they deserve 4 stars. I could go on about how good the Tea is, about how the green beans seem to have improved since my last visit and about how the mashed potatoes are chunky but I don't think I need to. What I do think everyone should do is give Bill Miller a chance.. and if it doesn't work out the first time give them another chance.

It's either here, or now that there's Northstar, there. I get the Cafe Bistro sandwich. every. single. time. I always want to deviate and try something new, but this is about as perfect as a sandwich gets. Turkey never disappoints. I'm an avocado addict. Bacon is always nice. Green beans on a sammie? It all just makes perfect sense. If you're feeling healthy, you can substitute the fries for fruit. But honestly, once you try their olive dip for the fries, you'll remember the fruit you already have at home in your fridge. Heck, dip your sammie into the olive amazingness. I HATE olives, but whatever is in this dip to mask the olive yuckiness is akin to heroin (it's probably mayo but shhhhhh).  You order and pay at the cash register, but then you have someone who brings your drinks and food and checks on your periodically. Actually I think the person who brings you the food is different than the person who checks on you. Anyways this creates a little argument during every visit. My mom and I disagree over how you should go about tipping in this situation - they're not full blown waiters/waitresses but they do give you a little more service than say at Northstar (where you don't tip, but they serve you and clean up after you, and bring you to go boxes). She thinks you tip less than a normal restaurant like 10% and sometimes less, but I say you still tip 15-20% since you don't know the workers pay structure and better to err on the side of caution. Also, my mom frequents there often so you don't wanna get a bad wrap. I know I'm getting a little too deep for a review, but anyone have some insight?

We had been for the last couple of months and today we finally went to go try it out. Maybe we came in with higher expectations, but overall our experience can be described as \\"meh\\". When we walked in no one greeted us, ok no big deal they are probably busy. We stood there until we decided just to sit on our own. We were given menus and then the lady just walked off. Then our server came out and asked if we were ready to order. We then explained to her that it was our first time and we had questions but she seemed uninterested in explaining how the ordering worked so we went with the brief item she explained us about. The food we ordered (the house broth) I got the pork belly and she got the lamb and her mom the beef. Flavor wise the food was good, the noodles were a little off but other than that we did enjoy the items that were given with our broths. No one really came by to check up on us, they dropped the food and then at the end asked us if we needed water and that there was self serve complimentary ice cream. Next to the ice cream bar, we realized there were sauces/condiments that we could have used to add to our broths (no one explained that was there for the customers; it was out first time).After that we waited for our bill to come out but no one came until we got the attention of one of the employees to give us the bill. The food wasn't bad , and it was generously portioned but it isn't great enough to drive from San Marcos to Austin and receive mediocre attention. If I was living by the area, maybe I'd give them another try but for now I doubt I'll go anytime soon"},{"name":"Sinju Japanese Restaurant","address":"7339 SW Bridgeport Rd","city":"Tigard","stars":"3","text":"Track sushi.

We have had food from this food truck parked in the Big Lot's shopping center  at TV Highway and 185th several times now. Someone else's review said the area is sketchy...I'd just say it is run down. It is very family- ish with other food trucks, a busy laundromat, and a Chinese place that has been there forever. It doesn't feel unsafe at 7:30pm.Anyway,  last night my kid came into my office with that crazed hungry teen look, the one where I feel like my arm might get bitten off if I do not produce good food immediately. FOOD! growls teen. Our fridge might be a bit bare. Like there is food but it requires some assembly. OKAY! I called in our order to Cedar's. I know other people do this too since I see people frequently pick their food up. Cedar's is open until 8pm. We were told 15 minutes. So we leapt in the trusty batmobile...ok my agingToyota... and sped south. Our meal was hot and  ready when we got there. For $30 plus tip  we got: \\n-2 orders of hummus @$5 each. This means a generous amount of hummus with 2 pita breads each. It is creamy goodness. I have to get two to have any for myself. -6 falafel with two tahini cups. $6 The falafel are donut shaped now. More crisp edges. The pickles in the box are extra tasty. I do not know why.  My teen also agrees on this. -2 big yummy chicken schwarma sandwiches. Full of tender chicken and fresh veggies.  They ask if you want it spicy. We did. It was. Everything was super tasty. We ate our big drippy  juicy savory sandwiches for dinner, some hummus and falafel for lunch today,  and there is still some food  left for later.  I ordered extra to keep the teen fed. I mean, I wanna keep my arm. It is good stuff. The prices have increased a little ( I mean where have they not?) but the people are very nice, it is local, everything looks and tastes delish.

The House of B√°nh M√¨ does b√°nh m√¨ - and they do it beautifully.It's always a challenging journey to discover a place where the b√°nh m√¨ are affordable and legit amazing. The combination of pork roll, BBQ pork, and ham provides a meaty balance that is simple, fulfilling, and true to tradition. The addition of the pickled carrots, daikon, and cucumbers is no exception. The sweet crunch from these staple vegetables lends the necessary counter to the otherwise softer interior. Jalapenos and cilantro add that extra spice that is pleasurable yet not overpowering. Of course, if you've never had liver pate, you have to get it. Smooth and buttery, the pate is essential for a classic.The bread... perfection. The baguette's crispy crust is thin giving a satisfying sound for that bite from your teeth. After that initial entrance into the bread, it gives way to a predictably softer inside, but doesn't turn into mush. This is paramount to hold its own against the liver pate and vegetable natural juices - all making every bite, the same quality from start to finish. Don't forget to try their salad rolls as well. Freshly made, they are sitting in front of the ordering counter on display. Shrimp vs. BBQ pork vs tofu are your options and all are strong contenders. The accompanying peanut sauce is authentic and complements rather than distracts.The House of B√°nh M√¨ is now a go-to spot.

We were here in October, and our waiter explained that the menu and the dim sum offerings change daily based on whatever ingredients the foragers bring back to the chef. That's right, the restaurant employs foragers to go out into Texas wildlife and bring back whatever mushrooms, plants, and veggies they think would be good. Not only that, but nearly everything is made in-house, including pastas, breads, cured meats, and alcohol. This way all seem like flashy, trendy buzzwords that allow a restaurant to overprice their food, but I promise you that the quality really shines through. I feel like it's almost useless to list everything we are, since only a few of them will likely still be on the menu when someone actually reads this review, but everything was so exceptional that I'm going to anyways. We started with a blue crab salad that was excellent, even though I don't eat crab. We had some tiny dim sum bites - apple with mint leaf and crispy pork, bruschetta toast bites, and crispy fish with cucumber served on a spoon. Very bougie and yummy. Our next course brought me some AMAZING Cacio E Pepe (I think this is always on the menu - GET IT!!!) and my boyfriend had a different pasta dish with meat and carrots. The next dim sum round gave us an incredible spaghetti squash dish and a refreshing kale salad (much needed after the heavy pastas). After that, my boyfriend got short rib which he really enjoyed and I had some outstanding paneer in a tomato-esq sauce with young greens and outstanding house-made naan. This was the best paneer of my life, no joke. Finally, we ended with the black garlic ice cream. The garlic was all caramelized inside the ice cream and it was a unique balance of sweet and garlic. I highly recommend it, even if you're unsure about garlic. If anyone is even still reading at this point, I need to reiterate again that this food was outstanding, and made even better by the extremely fresh and house-made ingredients. And, as a cherry on top, drinks and service were excellent. It was our birthday, and the staff all signed a card and left it on our table! I will absolutely be thinking of this meal for a long time and recommending it to anyone I know that is traveling to Austin."},{"name":"Old Chicago Pizza & Taproom","address":"10300 SE Washington St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Ordered the chicken ciabatta sandwich, took a few bites then noticed it had some raw spots.

And now if you go there for dinner, you have to choose the one main course from $15-$30, and most of them are above $20. I am not saying their food is not worth that money. But there are so many other better restaurants to choose from if the average cost is around $25. I generally went there more than 30 times and tried at least 20 different kinds of dishes there and to be honest, they are good but not distinguished compare with other Jp restaurants.

These are sloppy, homemade-style, stacked-with-toppings eat-with-both-hands get-a-stack-of-napkins burgers. These are not for the weak, or the cardiacally (?) challenged. The fries are indeed awesome, salty, and hitting that sweet spot between soggy and undercooked. No need for extra seasoning on these fries... they are plenty tasty on their own.There's enough variety on the free topping list for anyone to have a custom burger to satisfy virtually any craving. The peanuts available while you wait are really unnecessary. I only saw one person in the entire (packed) place partake.And yes, it's loud in there. But if I were in a burger joint packed with people under 35, less than 10 blocks from UT, were silent, I'd be worried and disappointed. It was lively and packed with people savoring the burgery-goodness.A winner all-round."},{"name":"Toasted","address":"1945 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"You've had grilled cheese before - those greasy crunchy melted treats that showed up next to a bowl of tomato soup with the tiny octagon crackers when you were a kid and your parents didn't feel like making a real dinner. Perhaps you were lucky enough to try the fare at Melt Kraft before it closed its doors, or maybe you've even experienced the \\"Hot-Spicy\\" at Tom and Chee.Still, there has never been a grilled cheese restaurant in Orlando (or elsewhere these exist) quite like Toasted. The restaurant occupies a modest storefront next door to a Boxing Club and the Clerk of Court for Orange County. The location, although in the prestigious Winter Park zip code, has never been noted for fine dining - but this spot changes all of that.We came here on a night when the lady and I had a hankering for some adventure and some cheese. We checked a few bookmarks, debated the merits of fondue and sandwiches, and Toasted won out. As soon as I spotted the brisket with havarti sandwich (with a side of rosemary fries of course) it was love at first sight - done deal. After Ashley ordered her blueberry grilled cheese and tomato soup and I paid the less-than-$20 bill (?!?!?!?!) we waited at a high top table by the window. Spoiler alert: the first bite was like seeing the face of god and it only got better from there. I really can't say anything better than that last sentence so you should probably just trust me and go here and eat some delicious grilled cheese. Totally worth it. Enjoy.

Intrigue, I decided to go in and see what a seemingly modest Italian restaurant located within a strip mall, had to offer. I walked in and I couldn't believe how beautiful the restaurant was.  Subtle lighting, soft music, and linen table cloths surprised me as I walked into this decidedly well-run establishment.Since then, I have returned often, with my son, to sample the many delicious dishes the young and very talented owner and chef, Dan Wade, has to offer.In the appetizer selection, our favorites are the Tuscan white beans pureed with garlic, olive oil & herbs, served with crostini.  The pureed beans are extremely flavorful, with a smooth and silky mouth feel.Stuffed Portobello Mushrooms stuffed with ricotta, Parmesan, house-made mozzarella, tomatoes & herbs were so delicious, I could easily have made a meal of them.Their main soup is Ribollita, an authentic made-from-scratch Tuscan tomato, vegetable & toasted garlic bread soup, a delicious treat, but I passed it up reluctantly for the special soup today, which was a delicious apple and butternut squash. I wasn't sorry.The grilled trout with capers, grape tomatoes, lemon & white wine, served with sauteed spinach, was moist and extremely succulent, by far the best trout I've had in a restaurant in many years, and the Shrimp Scampi with sauteed shrimp with garlic, lemon, white wine & olive oil served with tagliatelle was scrumptious.Vegetarians will enjoy the Caponata: roasted eggplant, olives, capers & tomatoes with grilled rustic bread appetizer, as well as the stuffed mushrooms, but the real treat for the vegetarians out there is the Eggplant Napoleon with slices of eggplant layered with fresh mozzarella, roasted red peppers & basil, served with spaghetti.  The dish is delicious with a wonderful mouth feel and truly satisfying.Prices are very affordable.  I would definitely recommend it for lunches and dinners with friends and family and the guests that come to stay.  This restaurant is a great way to show off Westerville.Service is excellent, wine choice superb, and always a great jewel in the crown of any restaurant, clean and accessible to everyone.  Bathrooms are pristine. A small bar in the back, complete with flat screen TVs removes the distraction of ongoing programs and keeps it where it belongs, at the casual, but well stocked bar."},{"name":"iPho 2 Noodle House","address":"156 Lake Ave","city":"Maitland","stars":"4","text":"Large portions of good food that all tastes the same.

It's worth mentioning that VV actually holds cooking and wine classes, which is a very cool thing to do for maybe date night or a GNO, just saying!Since VV prides themselves as a one-of-a-kind wine and dine emporium, (with beginnings as the Atlanta Wine School), you can expect that their wine selections are well above par.

Let's start with her huevos rancheros, we made it very clear that she was vegetarian and has NEVER eaten meat her whole life and wouldn't you know it, her dish had trace amounts of meat.  It looked like they had picked out the large pieces and left the little crumbles.  Well they apologized since we were in a hurry we didn't have time for them to remake it and after that my dining partner lost her appetite, can't say I blame her.  They brought out complimentary rice and beans for her to take home, which was nice of them.  Now lets talk about my tacos which were basically $14 for \\"TB\\" ground beef with a little bit of lettuce and a drizzling of sour cream on top with a side of rice and beans.  I could have gone to \\"TB\\" and only spent 3 dollars for the same thing.  The table side guacamole was good and they make a chili sauce that they bottle themselves that's not bad but not good enough to justify $14 for these tacos.

I can't imagine that there are regulars/locals that would frequent there unless there's a local hidden menu that we don't know about.  So disappointing.  I hope management takes this review and works with the employees to let them know that just pulling out the chunks of meat does not make it vegetarian.  There are people who do get sick when meat is consumed.  I'm just glad we caught it. And as far as the quality of food, I just don't know what to say.  The service was otherwise attentive and friendly.  I would also suggest that when guests come in to eat that you close the front doors while busses are parked and running out front.  I hate writing these reviews but my hopes is that businesses take to heart the importance of not just catching the bus load of one time tourists but keeping the locals happy and coming back."},{"name":"Wine Bar George - A Restaurant & Bar","address":"1610 Buena Vista Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"WBG was exceptional for a night out in the Springs, especially with friends!

They serve up coffee from Tandem in Portland, ME. Which is a fantastic little roastery offering all sorts of awesome beans. In a chat with one of the owners I found out that they are hoping to offer more guest beans for the single origin. So they'll offer than as pour over brews but also as full bags of coffee. NICE! I'm stoked that there is a local place where I'll be able to satisfy my coffee discovery craving!Prices are fairly high for the coffee. A cold brew was over $4 for one size, small. The bagged coffee was at the MSRP. My friend got a decaf tea and the price was fair. They also offer Chemex as well as other espresso options.Customer service is awesome and the folks behind the counter are happy to answer any questions you have with a smile.Seating is... Limited and on these high steel unbacked chairs that I, as a short person, find beyond uncomfortable. My legs go numb after 15 minutes.  The table surface is a little ledge that has enough room for a tablet or book. This is NOT a location where you can order a coffee and churn out your novel.

Live old-school crooner type music with keys, drums and strings is the perfect way to punctuate a late evening with a slow dance.Not for the faint-of-wallet, start off with one of the fantastic cocktails - My favs are the Screamin' Lychee and the Lily.  The Screaming Lychee is a jalapeno-infused vodka with a float of lychee juice.  Sometimes you will get a lychee fruit in the bottom.  The Lily is a Saketini featuring cold sake, pama and elderflower liquer.  Super tasty and refreshing, it borders on too sweet, but doesn't *quite* hit that threshold.  A big (22oz ?) Asahi or Kirin will set you back about $7.As a vegetarian, I'm madly in love with their harvest roll and the newer Yama Yama.  The Yama Yama has cream cheese, tempura yams and avocado in a rice paper wrap.  I prefer to change it up and have 2 yam, cream cheese and add the pecans.  I also recently expanded my paradigm and tried the Sesame Asparagus roll which comes with a sesame paste to dip in.  It's good but out-shadowed by the other two.The carnivore that co-habitates loves the Dragon Ball roll (eel, masgo, and a couple other items), the Crunching Buckeye (pecans) and the Teriyaki Salmon.My coworkers and my carnivore are big fans of the chicken lettuce wraps.Check them out for a prix fix menu during restaurant weeks."},{"name":"Sushi Tomi","address":"8463 S John Young Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Good Japanese restaurant with classical representation of Japanese culture.

A recent visit seemed to confirm that idea. One comes here looking for an elevated sushi experience, and one mostly gets that.Each piece of nigiri and sashimi was top-notch. Don't miss the smoked salmon and escolar. They also offer many highly-specific cuts and subspecies of fish like tuna and salmon.I'd highly recommend sitting at the sushi bar if you can. You get a good view of everything that's going on in the kitchen, and it's fascinating to watch the precision and teamwork involved. Also, you get to talk with and order from the staff behind the counter, which can be so much better than communicating with a waitperson, especially when it comes to specials and suggestions. Our counterperson didn't seem to be the most seasoned and enthusiastic person there, but he was helpful.If I could piece together the best bits of various visits here, I could give Musashino five stars. They mostly rise above the average and avoid the cliches and stereotypes I associate with lesser sushi bars, but they don't always: I'm all for kitschy, clever roll names but \\"Texas Road Kill?\\" C'mon, guys, you could have done better than that, lol.

I understand that you're worried that you might have to throw away some unsold chicken at the end of the day, but let me give you some friendly business advice:  It costs more to lose customers than to throw away some unsold chicken.  Perhaps you should rethink hours of operation and close earlier when demand dips, or maybe you should plan sales volume better, but under no circumstance should a customer be denied THE PRODUCT to which people come for.

We parked on the street, but I imagine parking would be difficult on the weekends or busier hours. While I enjoyed the food a ton (seriously very good), this is not a very social space. The restaurant is more of a sit down than a P Terry's but not a social scene like Hopdoddy- rather it's in the middle like a five guys burger.

What can I say? This place is absolutely amazing...and so romantic. My boyfriend surprised me by taking me here to dinner for our anniversary. It was also his birthday and what a great choice this was. I loved everything, from the decor to the booths to the fireplace. Lights were dim, giving the place a warm feel to it. The staff was very nice and attentive. Always made sure we had our drinks refilled. Now, the menu is quiet pricey. Ranges anywhere from about $12 to over a $100. This is definitely something to do on very special occasions.  Okay, so let's get started on the food.\\nThe complimentary bread was so good. It came out nice and warm with a side butter. We had a card for a free appetizer and were able to choose from any on the menu. We chose the Shanghai Fried Calamari. Fried to perfection and the sauce that coated it was nice and sweet. I liked that not only was it calamari, but it had fried hot peppers. It was a nice balance of sweet and spicy and not overpowering on either side. The portion size was great too, more than what I expected. Other restaurants where I've ordered fried calamari, have given me a smaller portion and don't taste anywhere near as good.\\nWe both ordered the braised beef with mash potatoes, root vegetables and a braised sauce. I can't even figure out how to tell you how amazing it was. The beef was so tender. Didn't need a knife to break it up. It fell apart. The mash potatoes were the perfect consistency and seasoned just right. There was just enough vegetables on the plate to eat with  every bite of mash potatoes. I loved the fried onion strings on top too, it gave the dish some texture. When you look at it, you may think it won't fill you up, but let me tell you... we were completely stuffed. \\nThis was such a nice surprise! Our server made us 2 cards and the staff signed it. Very nice touch and it's something we will never forget. Amazing surprise number 2! Our server came with not 1, but 2 creme brulees for us to have on this special evening... on the house!! It was so delicious. The texture was nice and smooth and it wasn't overly sweet. They sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon on top of the sugar which I thought went great.\\nI honestly can't wait to go again. I'm definitely waiting until after I give birth so that I can go back and have a juicy piece of steak cooked to medium rare. We had such an amazing night!

Granted, you may not get as pumped as me if you aren't some sort of budding sushi snob or would prefer your magical feasts to have a completely different fare. Let's talk about the non-food. Atmosphere & service was exactly how I like it: you felt taken care of but intimate and alone at the same time. When it hit about 9, the place started getting a bit more rowdy and loud, but before that I couldn't even hear anyone else. And it was packed! My favorite part of the service and atmosphere was that it was NOT PRETENTIOUS and a little more on the casual side. So....the food. We started with the squid salad and tuna tataki. Both fabulous. We got a really good amount of nigiri (mostly because we just couldn't stop ordering more) and my favorites were the spicy marinated whitefish (can't remember the name), smoked mussels,  unagi (eel), and I'm sure some others I forgot during my euphoria. The only one I didn't LOVE with all my heart was the hotate (japanese scallop). The hotate had a lime piece on it and the rind totally drowned out any taste of the scallop. Everything was extremely fresh and the rice was definitely the best I've had in Austin (only topped by a sushi place in San Francisco so...)Even though I really wanted to try every piece of fish on the menu, the roll that was really calling to me was Road Runner with soft shell crab. This thing was PERFECT. The hybrid sauce was great and I love that they put it on the side. The best part of this roll was that it got the spiciness just right. It was not overwhelming and only enhanced. My oh my. I'll be back. On the way home, my boyfriend and I discussed not going out to eat to any other restaurants so that we could go here more often. And we were kinda serious. It's not cheap or extremely expensive, but it's amazing the quality of food you get for the price.

We got ordered it with half Beyond Beef and half plant-based Chickun with vegan cheese. It comes with either refried beans or black beans and Mexican rice (which is also vegan). It also comes with the typical fajita sides; pico, guac and sour cream. She went ahead and doubled the guac and omitted the sour cream and I didn't even have to ask! The Fajitas also come with 4 homemade corn tortillas which are nice and thick. Our packet was missing one so we ordered another which was $1. When we got the check, we noticed the Hawaiian Fajitas were $20 instead of $18, which must be the upcharge for the vegan substitutes.

Our ramen came out lukewarm, the dumplings as well. Those who know good ramen know that it is traditionally served piping, almost painfully hot. The  dumplings also should have a spring to them, texture-wise. These did not, they were mushy. The tall guy at the front who took our order looked like an out-of-work actor who was too annoyed about his lack of auditions to smile at us. Very cold and quiet. Maybe just keep this guy in the back? He's not really customer-service oriented. Our dumplings also went to the wrong table, so we had to wait longer for them to make another batch for us. Overall, this was an overwhelmingly disappointing experience. We brought family from Hawaii here, and they are used to good ramen.

We ended up only waiting for about 5 minutes! We were shown to our table and left to review the menu. Our server came to the table and we place our drink orders.  Happy hour was still in effect so I ordered the house white...9oz glass for the price of a 6oz glass.  For dinner, I ordered the Eggplant Parm which comes with soup or salad and a side.  I chose the Caesar salad and a side of penne pasta. This dish is listed on the menu as a new item, and since it's one of my fave Italian dishes, I had to try it! Our server brought some fresh bread and olive oil to the table while we waited for our food.  The owner of the restaurant personally delivered our meals to us. That was a nice touch!  The eggplant parm was so good! It was perfectly cooked...not too firm and wasn't mushy. The penne could have been a bit hotter, as it was a bit room temp, but it had good flavor.  The Caesar salad had good flavor, but there was just a touch too much dressing. Not enough to drown the salad, but just enough to be a little too heavy. I didn't save any room for dessert, so we didn't order any.  Overall, this is a decent location. The staff are friendly, the food is good, and the menu isn't overwhelming.

I recently attended an YELP event hosted by this Carrabbas location. The staff was fantastic and we had an excellent time. Typically when I go to an Italian restaurant I'm in the mood for eggplant or some type of pasta dish. In this case, I LOVED THE CHICKEN! Here they have a speciality chicken dish (Chicken Bryan). Oh my goodness, it was so tender and juicy. It's because they have a grilling process in place that prepares the chicken in a way where it doesn't lose its moisture. The sauce is a lemony butter sauce with - get this - GOAT CHEESE and sun dried tomatoes. Super yum, right? I thought so. Apparently this dish can be served as part of a chicken trio that includes chicken Marsala. Chicken Marsala is one of my absolute favorite dishes, so I want to try this next time. Now let's talk about the most important part of the meal, dessert. Oh my gosh, the chocolate dessert they served us was as big as my face! No joke: look at my photos (Single serving might I add) I could barely eat half of it, and that's saying something when you put a chocolate dessert in front of me. I posted a photo on Facebook and so many people asked me where they could get that dessert! The blackberry sangria was too sweet for my taste, but it's all about preference. Some cool facts about this place:- They offer TWO happy hours (one in the late afternoon and one in the later evening!)\\n- They also offer wine pairing/set meals. I thought this was a cool concept and would be great for a date night or special night out with friends. What I found most surprising at this location - parking was EASY. Wait - easy parking on I drive? I usually avoid it at all cost. This Carrabbas is part of the ICON PARK location, and they offer free parking in the garage. The restaurant is literally like a 3 minute walk from the garage, and you don't even have to go to the main road.I'm going to visit this location soon and bring friends for the happy hour ... and maybe we'll also get some chicken ... and dessert."},{"name":"Colorado Fried Chicken Company","address":"","city":"Boulder","stars":"5","text":"Aaron has perfected crispy, fried chicken, with well crafted spice blend.

Never a good start if you want to avoid being tied to it or, gasp, buying something. Once you buy one thing the bandaid is always off in a place like this, as you will try to recoup the cost of gas to get here by finding something that will make the trip worthwhile. After looking at a variety of good but never perfect options for some areas of the home, we avoid getting sucked into an easy and cheap solution for our woes, but with the knowledge that we can always come back to get something that isn't quite the right colour, but sure as hell is good enough for the price. I held firm and made sure we stuck to our intended purpose, no matter how understandable my wife was being in her suggestions.A stop in the cafeteria yielded some reasonable fish and chips, but the oncoming closure of the area meant service was down and they had shut off the soda machines that were apparently actually working. The food was good, but the lack of takeaway options was also disappointing.

If it weren't for a friend that always craves sushi and wants Ru San's (she insists this is the better one, but a Ru San's is a Ru San's is a Ru San's), I would never come here. Why? Because I'm uncomfortable driving highways, especially with precious cargo. There's a closer RuSan's to Tech. I was tired. I didn't have a gps. But I wanted to make this dinner happen, so I was paranoid careful and braved it all. So, on this particular occasion I drove with a friend to meet said \\"RuSan's aficionado\\". I promised to have dinner, so I took the night off from work too. Since I'm a time freak, we arrived early, so we opted to order some small plates. I told the waiter I wanted sweet potato tempura, the $1 kind as something to nibble on until the other two arrived. This particular day, the waiter goes, \\"no, you want the sweet potato maki.\\"\\nMe: \\"....does it taste better?\\"\\nWaiter: \\"euhh........yeahhhhh.\\" It didn't convince me, and I was completely dubious, but I gave the waiter the benefit of the doubt.When Miss Aficionado + 1 didn't show up, the waiter promptly made a few jokes about how they did it for match-making purposes. It was completely inappropriate and led to a bit of an uncomfortable situation. The food wasn't there either, so nothing eased the tension either. When I got my order, the taste of the sweet potato was lost under a freaking mound of ill-formed and cooked rice. Their dynamite roll managed to outdo itself- it tasted completely bland! Bravo! That's a feat if I ever ate one. Bland, even after an assortment of fish, seaweed, crunchy toppings, and aioli? Wow.I wanted the night to be over with at this point but goodness no, I saw the check and started to see red. There was a $4 upcharge for the sweet potato maki (keep in mind I wanted to stick to $1), so that measly 8 pieces with a french fry's length of sweet potato cost $5 total. Since I ordered the dynamite, which was around $10, my meal went from reasonable to unreasonable (for RuSan's) in no time. Factoring tax, a tip, and lackluster service too, this RuSan's managed to leave a terrible experience here (nearly $20 for two unedible rolls and craptastic service!!). I don't remember what's his name, but he had a Diesel watch. Lucky for Mr. Diesel watch, my friend managed to make me calm enough to not blow up in the restaurant at that point. I should have told him straight on not to upsell customers to get a bigger tip.

My favourite was the Umai House fries, they were sweet and savoury (in a good way) and the seaweed flavour really came through . We also got the Rangoon which were basically like deep fried wontons with different fillings; however, I found the item was lost and didn't go well with the rest of the menu or the items we ordered.Overall, I love it and will come back to try more.

This has its pros and cons: It's more difficult to share and try a wide variety of things, but it's also great if you want one thing while your friends want other things. One of my friends is vegetarian, for instance, and he was able to get a pot fully focused on vegetarian food. Meanwhile, I'm more of a carnivore, so I don't often order vegetables at hot pot.There are appetizers and sides that you can get too. I got the takoyaki. It was satisfactory, but nothing to rave about. The takoyaki wasn't quite like the takoyaki that you might find at a sushi restaurant.

So with a schedule, we sure didn't want to wait on sending something back. We had to ask our server to come back and take our order for drinks, since she didn't ask for our drinks when she took our food order. \\"No worries\\" was her response. No worries?!? I think that's your job, not ours to take the order correctly.The sides were also not cooked to quality or price.

The only plus was the ambiance.  Ordered the spicy pork tonkotsu ramen and it was not very tasty.  It wasn't horrible, but the ingredients didn't mix well together and overall the ramen was bland and the pork was rough in texture.  If this was the only issue, I would give this restaurant another chance thinking I can try the hot pot or order a different type of ramen for comparison.  Nope, not again.  The reason is when I looked at my credit card a few days later, I noticed an unusual charge, suspicious enough that I had to check my receipt and sure enough they charged $2 more.  Granted if their food and service were better, they would deserve $2 more.  In this case it's not about $2 overcharge, but more about the credibility of this business.  I wonder how many other customers were scammed a few (or a lot) extra dollars without them knowing it!  Never again.  When you break my trust, you lose my business.

First thing I noticed walking in, even before the bright green, white, and bamboo decor, was that it smelled fresh. No gross fish smell. BONUS!! Second was the super Asian style decor. Very modern, very clean looking. I liked it. We were seated in a half booth/half table and chose the chair side reluctantly so we could flag our friends down when they came in. I was reluctant because they looked like hard plastic chairs that would hurt my butt, but they actually were really comfy! Bonus!! The also have these sweet booths upstairs that overlook the main dining room. I want up there next time. So cool! Third, our waiter was really nice, he was prompt, informative, and efficient. He kept drinks full and was not intrusive. Bonus!! We ordered Edamame (of course). For $3 it was OK. A little over salted and not as bountiful as I expected, but were steamed to al dente and had good flavor. We then ordered 5 rolls for 3 people, spicy tuna, spicy, salmon, seafood medley, firecracker, and buckeye roll. The group seemed to like the Firecracker and Buckeye Roll best. They all looked pretty and held up to the chopsticks. I ordered an avocado roll and cucumber roll as I do not eat fish and they were nice enough to accommodate my request of using soy paper and keeping them on a separate plate. However, those were the ONLY vegetarian rolls on the menu. That was a negative. But, the cucumber and avocado was fresh and tasty. Total bill with 7 rolls, a glass of wine, a Sapporo, and Sake. $80. Not bad! They also had a huge menu of Japanese and Korean inspired food that I would definitely like to try in the future as I found I was starving after only have 2 tiny veggie rolls. The people that own Asian Gourmet own Edamame and I would choose Edamame 100% of the time over Asian Gourmet. Better service, better decor (IMO), better prepared food.

In short: good location, friendly staff, good menu options, but overpriced. It's in a good spot - there is parking on the street and in a lot behind the restaurant, although it's usually pretty full. We arrived at 11 on a Sunday and got a spot easily.The restaurant itself is set up so you order first, then they give you a number and you find a table. There's certainly nothing wrong with this system, but they don't really have enough room when you first walk in to wait in line to decide what you want/order. Someone was there handing out menus which was helpful though! The menu is on the smaller side but there are tons of good options and I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to try! I ended up getting the prosciutto eggs and toast, with a hot tea (they do loose leaf). My friend got a cheeseburger and a mint iced coffee. Seating is decent, although they have really long booths in the center that are cute and would be great for a booth but create wasted seating space in the middle when just a few people are sitting on either end of the long table. By the time we left around 11:45, there were people standing and waiting for tables, so be aware of that if you come during a busy time. They brought out our drinks first; my friend liked her mint iced coffee and my tea was good, but because of the style of the pot it didn't stay as warm as I would've liked and I didn't have enough time to really steep it. They do bring it with lemon and honey to add if you want, which is a nice touch. The prosciutto toast and eggs was gorgeous and overall pretty good, but they put way too much salt on it. They had salted the bread, but because prosciutto is by nature salty, it was a little overbearing. Still, a great combination with the eggs and the arugula salad was also really good. My friend enjoyed her cheeseburger and said the patty they used was phenomenal. All in all, I enjoyed Northstar, but man it's pricey. Our food was $40 total, which is honestly just a lot of money for a place like that. The price is really my only complaint."},{"name":"The Main","address":"4210 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"My overall impression has always been good.

Everything's all set out in order: a couple of green juices to get your day going, an almond+juice mix around lunchtime, another couple of veggie/green juices for the afternoon, and a really superbly delicious cashew milk for the end of the day. Overall, it's a solid entry into the local delivered juice cleanse marketplace. I have sampled other cleanses, and this one is definitely comparable when it comes to quality and size of juices for the price. However on my three-day cleanse, two of the days the juices were delivered late. Like, almost an hour late. On day one, there were some apologies offered and a couple of free juice cards promised for the next day's delivery. While it did make my wife miss a meeting in the morning, we sucked it up and wrote it off as an honest mistake. But the next day the juice was again delivered about 45 minutes late. And really, guys, you can't mess with people on day two of a juice cleanse. These are our meals! Of course it would have been easy for me to dash off a low-blood-sugar-fueled rant on that day at 9:15 when my juices still hadn't been delivered. But fortunately I have a juicer and made some quick juice to stave off the growling in my belly. Day three was met with an on-time delivery. Yay! I really dig what Greenleaf is doing here, but it's hard for me to get past the fact that I paid extra for juice delivery and my juices were delivered late two days in a row. While I do have the luxury most days of sitting at home all day (since I work from home) so a late delivery wouldn't be a problem, this week it got in the way of meetings. And since you're waiting for your meals for the entire day, well, your whole world kind of revolves around when those juices show up. I'd probably try a cleanse from Greenleaf again (and will definitely grab juices from their locations, which are great)  but not delivered. I still am a fan of Greenleaf but felt compelled to add this feedback about the cleanses. Anyone reading this should still check out the location.

I'll talk up your attributes: you have flavorable coffee, and well made caps though the ice mix I had our last date was sub-par, I guess no ones perfect.  You are so popular you even sell beans, you have an entire seperate checkout for them.  Your body is fine, a classic cafe look with dark wooden skin and artsy appeal.  You give yourself to the community, serving your java found many places in town. You'd be a great person to bring home to mamma.  And it is not like we didn't have some good times, I enjoyed myself with you, you know, when I actually came around. Unfortunetly, I am a lounge about sofa kind of guy.  You are strictly wooden chairs, and to tell the truth, placed in awkward angles-- I find it uncomfortable visiting with all your friends crowding around.   I am the quiet chill with a book with some bebop or string quartet kind of drinker; you like to be vociferous and echoey with your friends. Yes your drinks are good buuut-- I've had better. Lets go our seperate ways wih dignity.  We'll say it was mutual.  I'll tell everyone that you are wonderful but it just didn't work out. I'll say you are four stars all the way to anyone who asks.  We'll stay friends and I'll visit if I have no other plans--I could spend the time complaining about the other coffeehouses before going back to them.

One could easily find a corner where conversation could be had. The food is always dependable. Their breakfast/brunch items are ambitious, though their lunch fare (on a weekday) is hardly exciting (standard, reliable fare here), it is well-made, and tastes quite good.

As a broke college student it is unheard of to have a KBBQ buffet on the cheap. At Danketsu,  the price is $13 am unlimited selection of beef brisket, sirloin, chicken, and pork belly. For every rice bowl you order will be an additional $1 added to your bill. Compared to other KBBQ buffets, which costs an upwards of $25 per person, this is a steal. Tip: The meat gets repetitive fast so you can try the sauces they are provided, but I like to mix sesame oil with salt and pepper to make my own dipping sauce for my meats. The quality of the meats are mediocre but definitely passable. This time in particular, the meats were quite chewy. I believe the reason is because they are not the freshest cuts of meats. The reason how they keep the price so low is probably because they skimp on the quality of the meat. On the bright side, the flavor of the pork belly and sirloin were pretty good. We got pork belly, sirloin, and beef brisket. I would avoid the chicken because it gets dry easily and takes longer to cook than the other meats. One aspect I think should be changed is the grill that they give use to cook our food. It should be replaced with a new design because for this one, there are two openings that drip all the fat and oil out and into little containers. Generally, this makes the food less appetizing and sometimes it does drain all the way so the oil gets too hot. When that happens, explosions of oil will probably hit the customers. Not an enjoyable experience.  I can definitely say that the Dank Bomb is very tasty. I can taste the sake but it is extremely smooth and light. All in all for the price, you can not get any better than this for a KBBQ buffet. If you lower your expectations, you will enjoy it more.

Portland ramen overall is a bit disappointing, but we've learned to deal. In general, a bowl of ramen can be judged by a myriad of things. Ultimately, they all boil down to 3 main criteria - broth, noodles, and meat. 1. Broth - my black garlic miso was actually flavorful, if just lacked any depth. The broth itself came out slightly warmer than warm, and in ramen 101 that's a no. In Japan, it comes out piping hot. You loudly slurp noodles and eat fast. Here, the broth needs depth. My wife's spicy red miso ramen had a nice kick, but the heat was less of a Japanese flavor profile and more of a Mexican one. The difference is that the heat lingers with the chilies used in Mexican cooking. 2. Noodles - they don't taste fresh. Aside from that, they're really thick and dense. Either the dough is over worked or something, but they may be my least favorite noodles for ramen spots in PDX. 3. Meat - the \\"choose your protein\\" should've been a red flag. I get it, not everyone likes pork belly, so there's alternatives for people. The \\"fatty pork\\" option is what I went with, thinking I'd get a minimum of 2 slices of delicate, melt in your mouth pork belly. Instead, it looks like a slice of head cheese, and the fat part is inedible - more akin to pig skin. It was pretty unpleasant and after trying one bite I moved it to the side. What helped the meal was the chicken karage and panco (yeah, y'all misspelled panko) shrimp. The karage sauce is nice and tangy and both were nicely fried. Unfortunately because there's not much to the menu, and the ramen isn't worth a second trip, we probably won't be back."},{"name":"Epicerie Cafe & Grocery","address":"2307 Hancock Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm super sad to have to write this but dang!

I like to shower, use some chemicals around the house, and even occasionally trim the hairs of my armpits (really?!), even if only in a healthy, socially prescribed way.That being said, I tend to like things that are local, naturally grown (whatever that means), and that have a feeling of uniqueness and untouchedness by dollars. Cafe Mundi is definitely all of these things. Went looking for a unique brunch experience this most recent saturday and came across cafe mundi on yelp. Saw they had migas and made an executive yes decision. The coffee is great and is oh-so-locally grown without pesticides, and blah blah blah. The migas were good, not great, but everyone else was really happy with their waffle fruit and egg plates. The menu is not terribly large, and is highly lacking in carcass options, but that's to be expected with hippies. The only problem with this place is that it is order at the counter and get the number (or rather, portrait of BandW movie star) and they deliver it to you. Now this is fine, except the line for ordering gets really long, and the gal stops taking orders to carefully prepare the espresso drinks (which is appreciated, but not the timing.) Maybe they just need more employees, or a better system, or maybe this is how they keep out people with little patience.

We came here with about dozen people and snagged the private room in back, perfect for a planned or impromptu party of 10-12.  I'm no rum connoisseur, so I appreciated the menu being divided into categories like: rum-forward, coconutty, fruity, not rum, etc. They also indicate the boozy strength of each drink on a 1-4 scale. As someone who likes a good bang for my buck, I searched for the 3s and 4s and landed on the Tickle My Tiki - a pina colada made with blackstrap rum (which tastes SO much like molasses, beware). The ambiance comes complete with pufferfish lamps, bamboo walls, island music, and long straws to sip your tropical bev with. If you order a volcano bowl, they'll sound the volcano rumble noise so the whole restaurant knows somebody is ready to party. More than a punch bowl, the volcano is actually quite sophisticated and balanced, with flowers floating on top. For a group of 4-5, it's the way to go. Drinks are $8-12 and most are HUGE.

Genuinely gross."},{"name":"Villa Mexico","address":"296 Cambridge St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We were on our way to what was supposed to be the first of two dinners, when we were sidetracked by this little Mexican nook my friend had heard served the best burrito in Boston.  I haven't tried any other Mexican food in Boston, but I can say that Villa Mexico blew away this California girl.The gas station convenience store location is supremely random and in its own way a Yelper's wet dream.  A sign outside indicates Villa Mexico with all the bright-lettered enthusiasm that might advertise a truly special car wash.  Inside is a long counter over which you can see the sweet and wonderful Julie King, all smiles and cooking away.After a moment's hesitation (something about saving room for what would now become our second and third dinners), we ordered a tamale and a mole poblano burrito.  They weren't very fast coming, but we could see Julie preparing them as we waited.We had sort of agreed that we could just \\"try\\" them both, that we didn't have to finish every bite.  We underestimated their irresistibility.  The tamale had a perfect crumbly cornmeal exterior and a spicy kick that crept up on us, sort of like the zest of nacho cheese.  The mole burrito was absolutely out of control.  The tortilla was marvelous, tasty in its own right and with this supple elastic texture that held the massive burrito together.  The shredded chicken and dark mole sauce were delicious and succulently wet, a quality allowed by the fantastic tortilla.  We devoured the burrito with hazardous alacrity.We were so impressed we felt compelled to rave to Julie and bombard her with questions.  Not only was she not annoyed and entirely creeped out, she was actually very talkative and friendly.  Let me tell you how amazing this woman is.  She was making a entomatado de res for a catering event, a laborious tomatillo stew, and she invited us to come back in a couple of hours if we wanted to have a taste.  Needless to say, we looped back after dinner #2 and she was happy to see us.  She was still cooking, just as we'd left her, and she gave us spoonfuls of deep flavorful stew that made our eyes roll with glee.  When she saw how appreciative we were, she offered to give us some to take home!  We couldn't resist, and she packaged up a whole carton of the stuff, enough for a meal for two.  We were so in love with her that we brought her back a bottle of wine, but there was no expectation of that - Julie is just awesome and giving on top of being a splendid cook.I realize that my adoration of Villa Mexico's proprietor may suggest a biased review, but remember - we only felt compelled to talk to Julie after we were flabbergasted by her food.  This is one of those rare places where everything comes together for a truly unique and rewarding experience.  I will be sure to visit whenever I pass through Boston."},{"name":"Diesel Cafe","address":"257 Elm St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I used to frequent this cafe so much that I earned 3 free drinks from the buy 10 get 1 rewards program. But diesel is the reason I broke my vow to never go to Starbucks and only support local, independent cafes. Nowadays I walk across the street to Starbucks without a second glance.I often resorted to diesel due to its convenient location in Davis square, later closing hours, WiFi, and my need for caffeine. As the other posts mentioned, patrons get limited WiFi but if the network momentarily disconnects, they can't log back in. Drinks are overpriced but can be good depending on the barista. Food is alright if you're in a rush. Not the worst things in the world and not the reasons I avoid this place like the plague. The stench of the cafe outweighed the benefits of sipping coffee here. It's this funky odor that gets stronger as you go to the back of the building bc it's often hard to find seats in the front end. The bathrooms are usually pretty gross and unsanitary.

It was not to stomg; it was light and refreshing. We ordered the baked crab dip which was very flavorful. We had to request for more toast points to finish the dip. Definitely a good choice for appetizers.  I had the Confit Duck Ragout which was wholesome if you're hungry. The crispy brussel sprouts are awesome! Absolutely loved this side. My husband had the crab fried rice. He said it's salty.  The conduct potatoes was also very good. If my husband's rice wasn't salty, I would have given them 5 stars.

By then it was after 2am. Instead of effectively helping out or at least asking other staff (who were just dancing and hanging out) to look, he was proceeding to serve some guy he seemed interested in more shots after 2am.

As a recent Restaurant of the Year winner, our expectations were higher.I finally came back last night (January 2018). Everything went wrong. 15 minutes to get our tastes of wine, another 10 to get the glasses we ordered (after we were very obviously silently judged for not choosing the wine that the waitress recommended). The main course came out before the pasta. The pasta was literally inedible (it tasted something akin to a leather chair). A different man (not our snooty waitress) came by and checked on us and comp'ed the pasta (new to the menu that night) which was nice. But it was the first time we felt remotely noticed all night (we sat around trying to make eyes at the waitress for 15 minutes to get our wines refilled). The lamb was fine. But for $30, it was just that - fine. Nothing memorable, nothing delicious. Did it need more salt? Different spices? It was just blegh.

BUT the food is phenomenal. My husband and I came upon this by pure happenstance, and we were so, so pleasantly surprised. We started with the Ika Gesso (fried squid legs), and it was so good. The breading was nice and crunchy while the squid wasn't too tough. They were fantastic with the lemon wedge and mayo? mustard? dip that came with the dish. At $7, it's not the cheapest, but I've already gone back and ordered it again. We've also tried their Berkshire pork skewer. It's a single skewer with maybe 3-4 pieces of pork belly for $3.50 (again, a little pricey), but it's grilled to perfection and showered with this amazing ponzu sauce. UGH. Will likely get again. As far as entrees, I ordered the Kamo Nanban soba (hot duck soba), and it was wonderful. The broth was just the right combination of ducky, soy saucey, tangy, and generally flavorful. The dish comes with about 4 pieces of duck, and they were so juicy and tender. Along the same (duck) vein, I ordered the cold version of this dish at my second visit (Kamo Seiro). If you like duck soba, I don't recommend the second (cold) version for a few reasons:\\n1. I'm an inherently lazy human being, and at some point, having to continuously fish my noodles from a separate plate into my broth became tedious.\\n2. If you'd like to enjoy the broth, the cold version's broth will be much too salty because it's a concentrated broth (since it's supposed to be meant for dipping). \\n3. The cold noodles eventually cooled down my broth too much, and that was sad. \\n4. The cold and hot versions are the same price ($16). \\n5. If you want to take the remaining broth to go (which you probably should because then all you need to add is cooked soba to essentially enjoy the meal twice), eating leftovers becomes annoying because you can't just throw your noodles into the broth since, again, it's concentrated and as such, quite salty. My husband ordered the Sukiyaki soba for both visits, and I'm fairly certain he's going to stick to that for his soba orders. It comes with a poached egg that adds a ton of flavor to the already flavorful broth. I didn't personally eat this dish, so that's the extent of my feedback on the sukiyaki.We will likely be returning again soon to try (what looks like) awesome donburi.  I should also add that this place is in a really foodie area of Somerville/Davis Square, so lots of dessert options around!Speaking of desserts, I made the mistake of ordering their Japanese Mille Crepe without looking at the price because I was so excited to see it on the menu. It's a small slice of crepe cake, a scoop of ice cream, and a single stick of pocky at $9.50. To be fair, it was fantastic. The cake was really fluffy, the ice cream (I got red bean) paired super well with the cake, and the pocky (cookies and cream) surprisingly added great flavor to the combination. And though I would totally order this again if it were cheaper, the price is just too steep for me to indulge into.

We were then seated within 2ft of the piano even though there was only 1 other table of guests in the section, and an entire dining room adjacent.  None of this was really that annoying; it's just a sign of a very under-experienced staff.I also found it odd that there were no less than 9 people working the front of the house and there were only 3-4 tables being served at any point we were there.Anyway, on to the food.  I ordered the veil schnitzel sandwich.  The bread was excellent, as was the veal cutlet.  It was dressed with a pathetic pale, flavorless slice of tomato, onion and lettuce.  This sandwich really could have been a winner, but the toppings were a complete after-thought.  Speaking of afterthoughts, the sandwich was served with a side of bargain food-supplier potato chips.  WTF?  A house side of any sort would be a nice addition, or, at least better chips.  Back to the service. The waitress, who was polite, was very inexperienced.  She came to the table often, but didn't refill drinks.My experience at Mozarts was by no means bad.  It was very disappointing however.

The daikon was soft and the braised beef was tender. We asked for no greens when ordering, but the bowl arrived with cilantro and all which my date hates. The table next to us ordered six buns. I assume the buns must be good here that it was worthy enough for a group of 4 people to order that many buns.

The only unsettling thing was they duped my cup into a bucket, an actual bucket, of what appeared to be juice or a mixer.

Yet this past visit on 7/26/19 they gave me a lot of shrimp (though unclean) and two clusters of snow crab....in the past I've received one.On my last visit 7/26/19 @ 4 pm My biggest upset was the customer service.

This isn't to say the servers are rude, I personally think they are understaffed. Their online app doesn't allow for simple swaps (like tofu for chicken on a salad, vegetarian simply removes the meat as I found out the hard way). We placed on hold for 15 minutes and then got disconnected. I had to go in person to place the to go order which somewhat defeated the purpose. Overall they either need to improve the online interface or increase the staffing to take calls during busy times. Probably both. This isn't a case of having too high an expectation either.

Lies. I've eaten at North Star since 2004. Turns out, she had promised to get a table for a couple that not only ordered after me, but was standing in line behind me. So, she didn't extend the courtesy of finding a table for me, but also lied about a non-policy and then lied about how she determined the seating order. We got a full refund and gift cards but I don't want to eat at North Star. I am a woman of color. I was with my sister and her fianc√©e. The couple was white. I will never eat at North Star Caf√© in Clintonville again. The manager tried to address the issue by moving us to a different table. The issue was we found the table we wanted.

The deliciousness of these unique treats, from different flavored marshmallows, graham crackers, and toppings coupled with the torched marshmallows make this a sticky, yummy dessert that is a twist on the smores of your childhood. The 1 star deduction comes from 2 things, the first being the price. For a treat that I equate similar to a cupcake, paying $6 seems a bit high, and you only get 1 smore.

By the time it arrived a couple of the people were done eating and most were well into their meals. My 35 minute wait was rewarded with a pizza that was severely burnt around the edges. It was explained that this often happens but I suggested after this long of a wait they probably could have gotten it right. My complaints were met with indifference and no attempt to rectify. I guess poor service and bad food is the norm and doesn't need to be addressed.\\n I hadn't eaten since breakfast so I did eat a portion of the pie.

I got a brisket sandwich with coleslaw and a side of Mac and cheese. Everything was phenomenal, with my favorite highlight having been the pickles that came with the sandwich.  The biscuits with honest butter were also amazing; the biscuit was the size if my face but well worth it. I got a John Daly cocktail and it was also great, the lemonade tasted fresh and the sweet tea vodka mixed very well. The Sweet Tea was also great and I was living for the huge jar it was served in.  Overall, the food was great and everyone was satisfied with their meal.Our one downside to the experience however was the service. Our server was lovely and super nice, but beyond taking our initial orders we didn't see him much again. I think we all would have gone for another round of cocktails but he never came over asked if we wanted anymore. We had ordered the bucket of biscuits for before our meals, but they initially never arrived. After being almost halfway through our meals, we asked about them and he asked if we still wanted them and we said yes. They did eventually come towards the end of the meal, but they were still very good. My friends sandwich was delivered on the wrong kind of bread than she had ordered, but she didn't really care so didn't say anything. Once she was almost done with her sandwich, she did find a hair in her pulled pork. She wasn't totally bothered since she had eaten most of it already, but did let our waiter know. He was kind enough to take the sandwich off the bill and the biscuits because of the delay which he didn't have to do.I think I would return again because of the food and how good it was, but would maybe shoot for a weekday night when maybe it's less busy.

There's no additional parking in the back. If you can find a spot, drive around and eventually a space will open.Both my husband I walked in, put our name down on the sign-in sheet and waited in the waiting area. We probably waited a good 10 minutes for a table. The bar was completely full. When we got our table, the server sat us literally next to the cash register so when people walk by their jackets would hit us. I didn't care for the spot but it was the only table at that time.We didn't care for how tight the eating area is. There was plenty of tables but the space in between them was super tight. If servers have to squeeze in between tables to get around that is a big indication that there's just not enough space. The menu wasn't too overwhelming. There was some photos to see and February special menu at the bar. I ended up ordering a Date Night Waffle and my husband ordered the Chicken & Waffles. The Date Night Waffle was a February special (chocolate leige waffle cream cheeese mousse topped with fresh strawberries and chocolate sauce. This is more of a dessert plate than breakfast but it sounded too good to pass up. Anything chocolate makes my day. The food didn't take a long to show up which was good because we were hungry. Both dishes was good but I must say the Date Night Waffle is truly a dessert. The waffles had enough sweetness along with great texture. Our waiter was attentive to our needs and quite friendly.

I had a fantastic (and strong!) chocolate martini sitting at the bar and I've had their burgers and fries, which I believe had truffle oil on them and were pretty tasty. I hope to come back at some point to try the Copius menu as well, and as a heads up if you like live music, check out the schedule for Notes cause they have lots of good groups!"},{"name":"Diesel Cafe","address":"257 Elm St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Not terrible, but you are better off getting coffee at Dunkin across the street.

The celery on the bloody Mary's were also old and browning on the ends. The waitress only brought two sets of utensils for four people. We had to ask for more utensils and plates and the waitress asked how many.... unh maybe for the other two people without utensils. This is where it gets interesting..... the fish and chips had HAIR in the coleslaw. So we told the waitress and she took it away.

Come to find out that's a common occurrence with venues but it kept me away for many years. Fast forward to 12 years later and I'm a guest for an event last night attached to the same festival I used to run. The organizers were pretty clear with the kind of performance art they'd be doing and that folks would be undressed (though covered as required by law). The staff were largely pleasant and respectful with the exception of the person put in charge. He apparently couldn't make any decisions, abdicated all responsibility and wouldn't let anyone speak to the owner who was home and calling the shots by phone. They could have asked that the performance end and allowed the rest of the three hour event to proceed that the group had paid for- along with performers who had been hired. Strangest thing is that the spot was chosen because they were to good guys in the documentary for which this was the afterparty. They had hosted these folks in the past without incident. A bunch of authoritarian, reactionary bullies.

This was the third time that I have dined here.  The first time we moved from a table to the bar as nobody came over to wait on us.  Tonight was our third tome at the bar.  Paul, the bartender, was excellent. But the other bar people appeared unhappy and never smiled. The owners should sit near the  bar service area  of the restaurant and watch the mess and liquid sloop that drips into the ice bin.  The lamb kabobs were 10/10. The rigatoni was broken and was not al dente.  The sauce was watery.  The brick chicken was very tender but lacked flavor and the mushed gnocchi tasted like wheat of cream with #11 yellow dye.  Lastly we asked asked for a slice of cake to go. But we were informed that this gem of a restaurant at a mall, overlooking row #10 of  the parking lot, does not serve food to go.  Instead you have to order it in a plate and then the bartender will remove it from the plate and pack it up \\"to go\\". I guess the chef is too busy over boiling the pasta rather than packing a desert for a dining room customer. The manager promised the cake but it was never delivered.

On a recent chilly day, we ducked into Afuri Ramen and Dumpling, the second Portland location of the Tokyo-based noodle soup giant.Snowflakes drifted lazily through the air outside as inside, sitting at the window, I inhaled the delicious aromas steaming from my hot bowl of yuzu shio. The delicate chicken broth was crystal clear but rich with shio tare (a salt based seasoning), chicken fats, and a light citrus flavor from the signature yuzu fruit.The noodles were soft, chewy, and entirely slurpable. Small strips of crunchy bamboo and pieces of curly endive added texture to the bite. A slice of rich chasu pork -- marinated and braised pork belly -- added complexity to the otherwise simple dish. First to be devoured, though, was that marinated, perfectly soft-boiled egg. This is a little bowl of heaven.While I was busy slurping my soup (completely unladylike as I inadvertently dribbled precious drops down my chin) my honey was equally lost in his bowl of yuzu ratan. In this dish, the same delicate chicken broth is seasoned with a tare of ratan, an Indian root that infuses a natural red color to the dish. Spicy sansho pepper and Korean chili powder lend a heat to the dish that warms you from the inside out. All of these brilliant flavors are balanced with citrus from the yuzu and a bit of lemon peel. My guy can't stop talking about this bowl.Everything was so spectacular that I had to return with my mom and son, who knew nothing about ramen except for those cheap commercial dry noodle soups available in the grocery store. They were both shocked and delighted at the flavor sensations that the introduction awoke. My mom is a vegetarian so she opted for the vegan tantanmen which has a miso tare in a hazelnut broth. The miso cashew crumbles added a wonderful crunchy texture to the soup that also included bok choy, shiitake mushrooms, and leeks. My son gobbled up his tonkotsu tantanmen, very similar to the vegan dish my mom had but with a thick pork broth.On this visit, I had to try the spicy tsukemen myself. I have been binge watching The Mind of a Chef and the very first episode, watching David Chang wax poetic about tsukemen ramen, had left me yearning to try it. Tsukemen is different from other ramen in that it doesn't come in a broth. Instead, a rich dipping sauce is served alongside the bowl of noodles and toppings. Bit by bit, I took my noodles for a dip before sucking them down. Absolute deliciousness. My only complaint is that the dish was not very spicy, it could have used some more chiles.On this occasion we also ordered a plate of kinoko and kimchi gyoza (dumplings) to share. They virtually disappeared before our eyes. Plump with mushrooms, cabbage, chives and potatoes, they were spicy and delicious.Afuri Ramen and Dumpling is located in downtown Portland next to Portland's famed Voodoo Doughnuts, which makes for great people watching. The space is open and communal, be prepared to cozy up to your neighbors at one of the long tables. Staff is very friendly and helpful for ramen newbies needing some guidance.Tip: On most days a daily special ramen is offered which quickly sells out. Get there early to snag your bowl."},{"name":"GLC Cafe","address":"225 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"GLC!!

The sauces my companions are chose were the lemon pepper, medium, and sweet and tangy. The favorite of the bunch was definitely the lemon pepper, a delicious buttery flavor that was one of the best chicken wing sauces I have had. Our attentive and friendly waitress let us know that one of the most popular sauce choices was the lemon pepper, hot, and garlic mix, which I will definitely try next time. Overall the wings were fantastic and I would definitely come by to have the wings again.The sweet tea at Flyer's was also quite delicious, with the perfect mix of tea and sugar, not too overly sweet and not too bitter from the tea.

My friends and I came to this restaurant in a very cheerful mood because we have heard great things about Stephanie's through our friends. Our waitress, named Molly, was very polite at first and then out of nowhere, as she's placing my apple juice down, she hits it against my other cup and goes \\"shit!\\" and then just walks away... Things just went downhill from there and she completely switched up on us for the rest of the morning. From that point on, she always spoke to us in a condescending and disrespectful manner. Any time we would ask her for something, she would make it very obvious that this was a lot of work for her. She comes to check up on our table and pauses for an awkward second and says \\"everything good?\\" But, mind you our booth is surrounded by mirrors so when she assumed that none of us can see her, she was giving us the dirtiest look as she walked away. We brought this to the manager's attention who asked her to apologize to us and then she abruptly comes over and begins to question why she was apologizing to us in the first place. She's almost playing dumb at this point and says, \\"I was only trying to provide you with great service, I don't know what could've possibly went wrong.\\" I told her that this apology she was delivering was a prime example of her poor service and the entire time, she's speaking to me with the most condescending tone and expression. She should be apologetic, not interrogating us for reporting her quality of service to her manager. Then I spoke to the manager about this experience and then he was confused at me for complaining because he assumed he was doing the right thing by telling her to apologize to us. I had to explain that I wasn't complaining about the fact that he asked her to apologize, I'm just extremely bothered about the manner in which our waitress \\"apologized\\" to us (which was a bullshit apology). Why are you trying to make me feel bad for how you treated us? Why are you playing victim? Although I tread lightly around this accusation and would rather not bring race into this situation, my friends and I noticed that Molly was extremely polite to her other tables that were within our vision. We were never, ever rude to her or being shitty customers, and we came to the realization that we were the only Asians in the restaurant. My friends and I couldn't help but assume that maybe we were receiving such poor service because we were simply Asian. Nevertheless, the manager took care of our drinks on the final bill which was very nice and well-appreciated. Food was decent.

Our waiter was Chris who was very polite and attentive. He was also the one who recommended to me the drink I ordered which was perfect for my taste. The place is very clean and polished and the bathrooms always spotless. The only thing that I wish to see in the short future is that their prices which tend to be towards the expensive side should get more realistic. Despite the fact that the food is great it is yet not up to the high end gourmet standards of other gourmet restaurants around the broad area of Boston. Also the fact that it's not located in the city but on the north shore should also be factored in by the management when they set their prices. I wouldn't mind if the food is kept as is on their menu because it's still very satisfying to most of us customers. But in this case we should see an apropos adjustment on the prices to reflect it. Otherwise an upgrade of the food to high end gourmet standards might only be fair with the current price list.

While my companion wasn't a fan of them, I liked them. What really got me was the broth and it impressed my guest too. When you think Tonkotsu you think rich, creamy and salty right? Well at Yuzu their broth is very light, almost like chicken but they managed to achive that deep rich flavor in such a light broth. It was quite unique for Tonkotsu.The Tamago was not soy marinated but it was cooked easy (yay). The stewed pork belly was sweet, yes, sweet.

For my entree I ordered a phenomenal fish dish which was nicely portioned and cooked well.Unfortunately when we returned the following night for some drinks - we didn't have as great of an experience. The bar area was completely packed - so we asked the hostess if we could order drinks and sit down in their open dining area. Despite the dining area - being occupied by one or two dining parties - they wouldn't let us. It would be one thing if the dining area was in a separate area to the bar - but being that they are both in the same space - it seemed strange. That being said  - they did let us bring our drinks (ie  - tea in my case) next door to the Ace - which ended up working out better - as we kicked back comfortably in the Ace's lobby. I would still recommend the Clyde Common to anyone visiting Portland - since they have a solid menu, as well as some great bartenders and waitstaff, but be aware that if you're just looking for a laid back drink on a busy night -  you may be better off going to a different cocktail bar nearby.Trust"},{"name":"Tasca Restaurant","address":"1612 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"I'm a Boston College student and was a regular at Tasca.

I started talking to them, explaining the charity that was being hosted for BC students raising money for a class. Someone at the restaurant, seemingly a manager due to his dress, started screaming at me and my friend for soliciting. Every other word the manager said was \\"f**k\\" and told us to never come back to the restaurant. It was extremely unprofessional and yelled at us relentlessly, even after we apologized and said we would leave. Now, if it is policy that you are not allowed to tell other people about the charity event going on since proceeds of your check go to the cause, then there is a more polite manner to explain to someone. If it is restaurant policy that you can not tell other people in the restaurant, then let me know in a professional and polite way. DO NOT scream at your patrons, calling them idiots and embarrassing them in front of the whole restaurant. You could have pulled us aside and told us restaurant policy.

Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House is where it's at.  Based on my experience, I will definitely recommend Del Frisco's to friends, family, coworkers, and social media.  This restaurant is a high-end, lively, social dining experience that I will never forget.  It was definitely worth what I paid for.  \\nI was greeted immediately upon entry with warmth and appreciation..  The host staff was highly articulate in their speech.  The host staff was polite throughout our interaction while maintaining a gracious tone and appropriate pace.  The host staff was readily smiling and maintained an engaging expression.  The host staff made eye contact and kept focus on me during our interaction.  I had a reservation, and our table was ready as expected.  While being escorted to our seats, the hostess engaged us in conversation, offered chair assistance, and remained beside the table until we were seated.  \\nWe were greeted at our table within seconds.  My name was learned and used during our dining experience.  The wine list and food and beverage menu were in excellent condition.  The server was highly articulate and polite throughout our interaction while maintaining a gracious tone and appropriate pace.  She smiled and maintained an engaging expression.  She made eye contact and kept focus on us during our interactions.  The service staff exhibited a genuine sense of interest and concern for our satisfaction and anticipated service when it was appropriate and helpful.  The service was visible, attentive, and behaving professionally at all times.  All the service staff was well groomed and wearing professional, clean, and well-fitted uniforms.  \\nAfter the initial greeting, we were promptly offered something from the bar and/or the wine list.  I ordered the VIP, which was recommended, and it tasted great.  The server explained the menu and pointed out highlights on the menu.  I asked for a recommendation between the rib eye and lamb, and the server seamlessly offered her thoughtful suggestion between the two.  She was very knowledgeable and able to fully explain the menu.  She was able to describe with considerable detail the preparation methods and ingredients of each menu item.  Throughout the ordering process, the server remained patient, helpful, and enthusiastic.  Fresh cutlery was set for each new course.  All dishes were served as ordered and delivered to us without them asking who ordered what.  We were asked by the server and managers if the food was prepared perfectly.  We ordered the Salmon and Rib Eye which were excellent selections.  The table was thoroughly cleared before we ordered dessert, with all food, condiments, and tableware removed and our table thoroughly crumbed.  The pace of service was seamless, to the point that we were not wondering when the next step would happen.  In handling all dishes and glasses, the service staff was efficient yet discreet, and always precise and professional in their movements.   Throughout the meal, our table was attentively maintained.  The level of interest in service on the part of the staff was constant and positive throughout the meal, without faltering after service of the main course.  The service made me feel like a special experience.  \\nThe food was immaculate.  The food presentations were perfectly executed with evident care given to each individual item on each plate.  The food temperatures were perfectly balanced at the moment of service.  The rib eye was cooked medium well as requested.  The flavor of the salmon and rib eye were exceptional.  The service enhanced our enjoyment of the food flavors and presentation.  I would definitely make a special trip back to Del Frisco's to enjoy the food I ordered again.  \\nThere were two managers visible in the restaurant that were visiting tables, engaging and having a good time with the guests.  They were wearing professional attire.  The managers both visited our table and introduced themselves.  \\nI had an excellent experience."},{"name":"Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House","address":"9150 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This year, my friends and I took full advantage of Magical Dining and tried Del Frisco on International Drive.  Wow!  I highly recommend all (tourists and locals) to try the medical dining menu.  You'll want to make a reservation because Saturday night alone, they had over 800 reservations -- plan accordingly.  Del Frisco is absolutely beautiful inside and I could not get over how impressive their wine cellars are and the wine selection was.  For Magical Dining, I think 5/6 of us ordered the lobster bisque.  It was very good!  There were large chunks of delicious lobster in the soup.  Our party's outlier ordered the Cesar salad (I had a little nibble) which was good as well! For dinner, once again, 5/6 of us ordered the 8oz filet mignon.  The steak was wonderful.  I loved the seasoning and the crispy outside.  My steak was perfectly cooked.  I looked around and I don't think a single person had any steak left! :)  Our outlier had the filet medallions. His steak came with green beens and what looked like a mushroom sauce.  Everyone had mashed potatoes served with their steak. Finally for dessert, the party was split evenly.  Half got cheesecake and half got the chocolate mousse.  I was told the cheesecake was amazing.  I ordered the chocolate mousse.  It came with one chocolate cookie and a chocolate straw.  I loooove chocolate but for me, it was okay --  that's just personal taste and had nothing to do with the quality of the food.  Everyone else loved their mousse though.  With magical dining, they had a few limited options off their regular \\"wine bible\\" by the glass.  I had a Russian River Valley Pinot Noir.  It was a good glass of wine!  My boyfriend had an Old Fashioned and he said it was really made well and would definitely order it again. All in all, my only complaint (and a small one, I might add) would be the amount of times I would need water or had to ask for a refill.  Other than that, everyone was attentive and prompt.  I would absolutely go back for another meal."},{"name":"Olive & June","address":"3411 Glenview Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My first experience with Olive and June was interesting, to say the least!

Cons: We made a reservation, 4 weeks in advance, for 10 people and still waited 40 minutes to sit because of a lingering table (understandable). Our server was very sweet but the time per course was astronomically long. We wait almost an hour between a charcuterie board and shishito peppers (very good!) and 9 pasta dishes.

Low ceilings, dark wood, and vintage glassware are signs of great things to come. Or, if you're really in the know, ask for seating in the library bar upstairs, a speak-easy like place with expansive tables, leather chairs and couches, a gorgeous bar, and a hidden door in a bookshelf. Be warned that reservations must be made for either bar area on the weekend, sometimes well in advance (Ran does have a reputation, after all).For food, let the bartenders help you navigate the sometimes overwhelming choices (the bar highlights some of these on their bar menu, as well). Skip anything not distinctly Szechuan, with the exception of the chicken wings; both hot dry and bourbon versions are excellent. Avoid the dan-dan noodles (unremarkable at best). Their chefs are often heavy-handed with the Szechuan peppercorn, but nevertheless, dishes like the spicy dumplings, Chinese style broccoli (the spicy version), and chengdu hot chicken are wonderful. They feature several eggplant dishes, one of which is prepared with a thick, sweet and spicy sauce on an enormous platter; it's fantastic. Twice-cooked fish and spicy prawns are also great. Cold Chinese-style pickled vegetables are addicting.But the gem of this place is Ran's team of award-winning bartenders. Cocktails are amazing, featuring a staggering assortment of liquors, mixers, and accompaniments. Be aware that the downstairs and upstairs bars feature different drink themes and menus. The downstairs is the original bar where all the magic started; the focus is on homemade syrup and tonic infusions, classic and old-timey cocktail recipes with a twist, and the drink that won Ran all the recognition, Father's Advice (a complex, fantastic, oddball of a drink). Upstairs, the drink menu is more expensive (yes, I warned you) and a little more offbeat. Cocktails tend to be on the sweeter or more tropical side here, but still very well balanced. Both bars rotate cocktail menus frequently. Downstairs, I love the Pisco Punch. Upstairs, I'm fond of the Baldwin Apple II Revised, and the Betty Draper, which uses \\"coconut air\\" (they'll explain to you how they do this) to create a lovely foam that stays through the last sips. In either spot, bartenders welcome the chance to surprise you based on your tastes (for me, bitter and sour, shaken; or bourbon based, stirred). Best of all, the Baldwin is about the craft of making fun and interesting drinks. It is not pretentious. Despite the national awards to his name, you'll find Ran on any given night (and I should know, I'm here on the week nights more than I should be), mixing drinks, waiting tables, and checking on guests. Occasionally the service is a little spotty between upstairs and downstairs bars, but I attribute this more to the early stages of an ambitious endeavor of running two different bars with a host of bartenders. Don't be put off by this; the establishment here is warm, friendly, and getting better by the minute. The bartenders are personable, quirky and outgoing. They're particularly good at reading the table (do you want to be left alone with your friends to sip these awesome drinks? do you want them to show you how they mix or talk to you about their favorite mixes? do you want recommendations, advice, or something made just for you? Whatever the answer, Ran's team knows and will accommodate). On more than one occasion, I have relaxed with friends for hours in the Library Bar, working our way through multiple food and drink courses, while the bartenders took it all in stride and came over to chat with us when business was slow. It's in these moments that the Baldwin is at its best (and why I'd recommend you go on a quiet weeknight versus the weekend), when you feel you've been invited into a club of good friends who love what they do and love to share it with you."},{"name":"China Palace","address":"6605 Airport Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Our nearest Chinese place.

It is just overdone it's blah and not exciting any longer.Stauf's in German Village is definitely the only option because Starbucks in German Village is definitely not worth wasting your money on.    So if you are in German Village in Walking you might as well walk in to stop and grab something and stay focused on your walk but it's no longer that fun exciting vibrant location that it used to be.Stauf's at the North Market is a nice place to stop, sit on a stool for a while or grab something and keep going.Not one of these three Stauf's locations have the vibrant cultural ambience that they once had. Not one do I find have taken the time to expand the roast and expand their offerings and stay up or competitive with these amazing coffee shops that have truly caused an explosion in the Columbus Coffee Movement.  Several local roasters are nonprofits and give back to society...I appreciate that aspect.  Stauf's just doesn't do that within the community for the community.So unfortunately you see that I'm not a big supporter when I have a lot of options in the Greater Columbus area.The one big positive that I will say is that employees seem to care about what they're doing and they definitely have the visual vibe to fit in that professional position."},{"name":"Brookline Lunch","address":"9 Brookline St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"DELICIOUS!

Big fan of this place.  Another good pre-gaming spot if you're headed to Fenway Park.  It's closest to the Fenway stop (on the D line).  From the restaurant it's a short walk to the ballpark.  The restaurant smells like a smokehouse when you walk in.  There are some tables located outside on the sidewalk for outdoor dining and there is a small covered beer garden with some long high top tables as well.  There are a fair amount of tables, you can call for a reservations.  There's a pretty impressive beer list, usually about 6 or so on tap and a large array in bottles and cans.  Options range from light domestic options to dark porters.  In addition there are some pretty tasty-looking cocktails, but I've yet to sample them.  I've always kind of thought of this place as a beer drinkin' establishment.  Glasses for drinks are mason jars.The bucket of biscuits are gigantic, but really tasty with the honey butter.  One is more than enough for me, so I'd suggest making sure you order them with a reasonably large sized group.  Otherwise those puppies might get left behind.  The portions in general are quite generous, so it's important to remember to come hungry and remember it's a marathon not a sprint.  I don't eat red meat, but I still find plenty to choose from on the menu.  I'm partial to the pulled chicken over the pulled pork, but both are quite good.  A friend has raved about the relatively recent addition of fried chicken, and a staff member has told me that it is a popular menu item.  The trays are a great idea as you choose one meat and then one hot side and one cold side.  For hot sides, I am partial to the BBQ baked beans and the black-eyed peas.  The mac and cheese fell short compared to those other two, in my opinion.  For cold sides, the carrot and raisin salad and the potato salad are both solid choices.  In a more recent visit, I noticed that they have added a cobb salad with smoked chicken.  That is on the to-do list for a future visit.  I don't pretend to be a BBQ expert, but I've always enjoyed my meals here and have had a pleasant experience while doing so.

When our waiter did come over, he clearly had had a long night and proceeded to somewhat, not necessarily complain, but be a little too honest on his thoughts of the dancing and how long he was going to have to be there that evening. I've been a waiter, I get it, but it kind of put a damper on the evening as he was starting to make us feel bad about his working, and having to dance, etc. Beyond that, the food was pretty good, and the service was fast... just hate being asked how everything is, when I haven't even picked up my steak knife yet...

First of I purchased a GROUPON for this restaurant as I had driven by it many times and was thinking of trying it. Walked in,was greeted by a male staff member..then sat at the table and mentioned I had a Groupon to the waitress who in turn informed a male employee ..then EVERYTHING got dark..lol. Heard her tell the manager/owner? I had this..,and the other patrons seated heard his reply..Absolutley not!!..you have two have two people for a GROUPON..well, That embarrassed me..slightly..and when I showed the waitress the groupon that stated nowhere two people minimum.with my beloved GROUPON,whom I will be contacting about this experience tomorrow...she just said sorry. Ok..I was hungry..I ordered the Steak with shrimps and Caesar salad. I knew when it arrived that seeing my salad on the same plate as the steak indicated the chef had no clue what he was doing here.The Caesar salad was swimming in the grease from the grey meat that lay under the canned mushrooms that I never anticipated...calling this hospital food {the reviewer with the review below} is an insult to hospital food! Serve the damn salad on a separate plate you lazy buggers! New york strip..HA!!! Grey old sirloin that was on it's last legs..I ate one bite..waitress asked If my steak was alright..told her..nicely..sorry..it is horrible..one of the worst attempts at cooking beef as I had ever encountered. Wanted to say..I wouldn't serve it to my dog..but held my tounge..Dog would have biten me if I served him this mess..and I would have deserved it.

Dropped by on a stat holiday around 12:30PM and the place was moderately busy. No other customers waiting and there were a couple of empty tables but it took almost 15 minutes for me to be seated and me asking 2 separate staff members for a table. I think because it's new, staff could do with some more training. The staff are wonderful, but service is super slow. After being seated we had to ask for our water, weren't asked if we wanted any coffee or drinks, and after ordering to when our food came out - it was at least a 40 minute wait and I would have said that there were only 2-3 other tables waiting for food during that time.Otherwise, food was good! I got the coffee crusted pork belly hash which I thought was a really unique take. Their hash is the softer chunkier potatoes (not crispy) but the flavouring was nice and buttery. The pork belly was cooked nicely, I think my only issue with it was that is was just a tad over-cooked on the crust. It has a nice charred flavour, but I think with the amount of the coffee crust, it was on the \\"burnt-taste\\" side. My friends got the chicken karaage hash and the smoked trout benedict, both of which they said was good! Portions are decent, not huge but enough to fill an average-hungry person. I like that there's a mix of vegetables with the hash and not just a bunch of potatoes for the dish. I would have liked it if the food was served hotter though - it was just moderately warm when it came to our tables."},{"name":"Emmer & Rye","address":"51 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I try to visit restaurants Bon Appetit names in its Top 50 list each year, and so I had to visit Emmer & Rye while I was in town for work. It was a perfect choice for me and 3 friends, and the bill was still reasonable at around $60 each for two cocktails each and plenty of food. Before visiting Emmer & Rye, it's important to understand a few things:\\na) It's a tapas restaurant, and you will be given the choice to order by menu or off the \\"dim sum\\" cart. We did not find many items that enticed us on the carts the evening of our visit -- they all seemed small and pricey for the size. There also just wasn't anything that really caught our attention, creative as it was. We did love the vegetarian gorditas of all the choices. I encourage the owners to visit State Bird Provisions in San Francisco to see how to do the dim sum option with substantial portions.\\nb) Yes, there is a cart that's going to wheel by with a food introduction on each cart, so don't come to Emmer for a serious conversation or a first date. Even in my case, I was trying to catch up with some friends I haven't seen in a while, and the constant people stopping by was a bit distracting. \\nc) I just moved from Brooklyn and I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, so no one appreciates farm to table, local, organic and creative more than me. In these places, that's just how food is done, and it's expected. I do find it sometimes a bit annoying when I go to other cities that feel that they have to educate you on the food. This is a fine line here. I do like a nice description, but I found that explaining the menu, the approach, and every item every time that showed up just got a bit tiresome here as if they needed to prove themselves or something. \\"This is our [insert thing you've never heard of before] grown at the local [insert farm name] fermented for 100 years in our curing room located here in house] and topped with [insert beet or cauliflower or kale].\\"  \\"This is our .... .\\" It would have made for a great food show segment -- as long as that is the goal of your experience.With those three caveats, Emmer & Rye is an incredible food and dining experience - you should just go knowing those things. Our table loved the cacio e pepe in particular, and we had to order two servings of it to satisfy our taste buds. The kale appetizer also was a table favorite. The Old Fashioned cocktail was delicious, though spare in its portion. There was a lot of creative food, friendly people and a warm atmosphere here. There just was nothing that I will crave or think about for days after -- and that seems to me to the work this restaurant needs to do to go from a 4 to a 5 in my estimation. I went once, but I'm not sure if something is really drawing me back. That's fixable, and there's a lot to be said for what is happening already."},{"name":"Sandoval's Cafe & Cantina","address":"460 SW Miller Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This place has been updated since the last time I was here (few years ago) and it looks great now.

I ordered the enchilada with green sauce, which I found the sauce to be a little more on the lime-y side (which I don't personally love) and it was spicier than expected but was still very good. The rice had a lot of flavor which is rare to find in a lot of mexican restaurants. The portion amount was great but i'm not sure for the price?

And nothing about the place really says order steak. Lots of jazz/blues but the staff being in Edy Hardy wear did not add up. There is one dedicated server for the place so as it fills up it can be tough for that person to keep everyone happy. The staff was pleasant and friendly though. And the restroom is essentially in the room/basement/Bogie's Place so for those with short bladders it is a great. For others it can be strange if you are seated nearby.

Perfect comfort food for a cold day/night.  Comes with a bowl of rice and side dishes.

We came here for brunch because Cafe Luna had a line out the door and an hour-long wait; and I'm soooo glad we did. If you've ever read any of my reviews before, you KNOW that I love diners. There's just something about comfort food in generous portions that calls out to the Southerner in me and reminds me of home. Now, Brookline Lunch is not a Southern diner, but they do have very tasty breakfast foods that come with a budget-friendly price-tag.Located on Brookline Street, it's a literal hole-in-the-wall, meaning that there isn't any apparent signage -- just look for a front with green-paneled awnings and you'll find Brookline Lunch. Inside, the diner is very homey looking with rustic and industrial influences. They have exposed brick, aged hardwood floors, an open kitchen, and miscellaneous art pieces hanging on the wall (some available for purchase if they tickle your fancy). My friend and I shared a French Toast Special; which came with three slices of thick french toast, two eggs, and a choice of meat (we chose bacon, because, duh). We also added on a side of homefries and toast. My boyfriend got the Chicken Curry and her boyfriend got the Greek Omelet; I only tried the curry and I gotta say that I will DEFINITELY be getting that the next time I come here. My food was pretty good -- it's not out of this world, but it's a good, tasty, and filling breakfast. I see so many brunch places up in Boston that charge an arm and a leg for single-item foods that it's just nice to see a place that will include everything. Service was pretty good! The hostess was very friendly and greeted us right when we walked in; and we got a table immediately, no wait needed. Our orders were promptly taken and came out in 10-15 minutes, which wasn't too shabby! Water service was also very good -- they came by and refilled the water glasses several times.If you're looking for a place to bring your date or your parents, I'd recommend someplace a little nicer, but if you're just looking for a simple breakfast hole-in-the-wall, definitely come to the Brookline Diner.

My husband and I have been to the Bexley Main Street location a couple of time for dinner and always had a pleasant experience, however today we had two out of town guest with us and decided to try it for brunch. Big mistake!This was easily one of the worst dining experiences of my life. The resultant is small and only has a few booths available to seat a party out size. We went to sit at a booth located in the front of the restaurant (by Main St) however it was swarming with flies so we decided now to sit there. We ended up taking the larger booth across from the bar. The waitress came over and have us menus and after a few minutes came back to take our order. We ordered the Greek omelet, two orders of cinnamon walnut pancakes, and a short stack of regular pancakes with an egg over medium and an order of bacon. A few minutes later the waitress comes back to tell us they are out of the gyro meat (keep in mind it's a Greek restaurant) and asked if I wanted to have something else instead. I changed my order to \\"the pig\\" omelet described on the menu as 3 egg omelet with sausage, carmelized onions, red peppers, mushrooms and Swiss cheese. When our order comes the short stack of regular pancakes and cinnamon pancakes were switched and the waitress didn't  bring me my omelet but instead gives me an order of pancakes as well. When I tell her about the mistake she tells me to keep the pancakes and they'll  make me the omelet. We ask for some butter for the pancakes and she tells me they don't have packets. I ask if she could get some from the chef and she says maybe but he \\"usually just uses a big stick\\". So I ask her if they could cut some off of the big stick for us. So she goes and gets us butter cut from \\"the big stick\\" and come back with the butter and a random fried egg no one ordered. Finally she delivers my omelet which was nothing like the description on the menu. The hash browns were burnt and the eggs were over cooked, there was so much cheese in it I could barely cut it, no red peppers, no mushrooms, no carmelized onions (raw onions instead), and It had the equivalent of one sausage link in it. I questioned her about it she said they were out of red peppers too, that's why they didn't put them in. What? Why were they out of everything?!?My toast came out dry so I tried to butter it with the butter from \\"the big stick\\" but the toast was too cold to melt the butter. When I tasted the cold buttered toast the butter tasted really bad, like it might have been spoiled. Lastly my husband ordered a glass of milk, which we're not sure what was wrong with it but it tasted like cheese and was thicker then it should have been. With everything that went wrong today you'd think the waitress would have been apologetic but she honestly didn't seem to care. She did take the omelet, which I deemed too gross to eat, off of our bill but she charged us for the extra order of pancakes that we never ordered.Overall it was a horrible experience. I might be willing to try it again just because we've had positive experiences at dinner but I felt like I had to caution anyone thinking about going her for brunch.

It had great reviews. Our salads were very good. Actually too much salad in a tiny bowl so that the lettuce fell on to the table. My guest's French Onion Soup was less than desirable. It lacked the thick coating of cheese on top that is usual for this dish. Most of the cheese was on the side of the bowl. My guest had a hard time finding cheese in the soup itself. My Yorkshire pudding Bowl was burnt. I had seen pictures and the bowl was dark, but this actually tasted burnt. The potatoes tasted like instant mashed potatoes and the beef lacked flavor and was very tough.  Our server was had to reach, she had a wide range of tables to serve and she had to run up and down stairs. When I did tell the server of my problem she asked if I wanted a new entree or money off the entree. We did not want to spend more time in the restaurant so we said we would take the money off. My guest's Rueben sandwich was alright. It could have used more dressing and the meat was a bit dried out. I had a coupon from Yelp that I received after I checked in. It was for a free dessert. When I showed the server the coupon she said she never saw one like that before and it might be expired??  After about fifteen minutes of her checking she decided to accept the coupon. I was looking forward to the dessert since I didn't eat much of my burnt entree. We were told they only had one dessert, it was a chocolate torte. We agreed to try it. The dessert was one of the desserts that look great and tasted awful. The chocolate was bitter. I was a bit hungry, but I passed on the dessert. My guest will eat anything sometimes and finished the dessert. The server told us after my guest finished the dessert that it was gluten-free. Well, that explained the awful taste. Very few gluten free desserts have good flavors. When we received the bill, we were given a mere 25% off of my hardly touched entree. I would have expected at least half or free. As I said this restaurant was a huge disappointment. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"name":"Amelia's Cucina","address":"1137 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Practically none of their \\"pizzas\\" have sauce, extremely slow service, brought out the wrong pizza then tried to blame me for it and didn't apologize when I pointed out that I had ordered correctly, only took a couple dollars off instead of comping the incorrect item, would not recommend under any circumstance"},{"name":"Nayar Taqueria","address":"5919 SE Foster Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"the end of our meal before we decided to post our review, $7 for these three sides \\n(avocado sour cream &pico de gallo) \\nwhich were all good. \\nwe ordered shredded chicken enchiladas that came with black beans & mexican rice with bits of corn & peas. \\nshrimp cocktail was our other order... both were honestly... alright. definitely not 'authentic' i guess u would say. more specifically the cocktail was topped off with canned tomato juice, & not even Campbell's. \\nwe were starving enough to grin & bare it, cute spot friendly service & yes we will for sure be going elsewhere to get our mexi fixp.s most of these reviews are friends/ family"},{"name":"Al Hawr","address":"3500 SW River Pkwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"We went here before going to see Aladdin.

To start off this is like a legit tiki place, I really love the decor, just the decor itself makes me want to stay and hang out!

My bf and I got a couple drinks and all were amazing. i can't imagine any of the drinks on their menu (which they say that have over 50) tasting bad. on the menu they also tell you ho strong each drink is with a rating, which is cool too if you're sensitive to alcohol.when we got there there was a wait so we had put our names down and waited for a while. While we were finally seated we saw that these 2 guys come in and they were supposed to put their names down but actually got seated right away because they knew someone... so that wasn't fair to the people waiting outside I didn't thinkI had ordered some food with our drinks but it never came until we were ready for the bill.. I think the bartender just forgot to put it in. which is fine with me just make sure I still want it when you do put it in. cuz as soon as it came I had to ask for a box with the check and I didn't get to eat itwith that, I ordered the bim bap plate. it was filled with pickled carrots, seaweed, tofu, a pickled egg, and kimchi. The portion was a lot but it just didn't float my fancy. there were ALOT of pickled carrots and they weren't too amazing for my taste. and the kimchi wasn't as \\"fresh\\" as some kimchi that I've had before. but still not the worst. this is a fun place to bring friends or come for an event deifnitely. can't wait to bring in visitors!"},{"name":"Leyla's Kitchen","address":"17499 Hamilton Pool Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"My son and I stopped here for a quick lunch ... we were pleasantly surprised at the overall quality and flavor.

She then said it was Oregon law that anyone with a non-US ID had to show a passport. We were like are you kidding me? We had been there a week, and had been ID'd a few times and were NEVER told this.

Sure, you can debate which is better - IHOP or Denny's - and it won't matter.  What matters to me is that this is a very nice IHOP and I'm echoing another Yelper's comment that this is the nicest IHOP they've been to.  I would agree with that.I'm going to go with 4 stars.  The location and the facility, for being an IHOP, get 4 stars.  The service gets 4 stars.  On both occasions, seating was immediate, the order was promptly taken, the food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time, and the caliber of the service was very good, especially the first time when being waited on by a guy who had a goofy and much appreciated sense of humor.

Once l arrived the cashier informed the manager l was there. The managers name is Jos√© Diaz ( service manager ). Jos√© saw me standing there and instead of greeting me immediately Jos√© decided it was more important to stock straws and other plastic ware instead of having an employee take over the duty. NOT ONLY did l never receive an apology  for this DISGUSTING INCONVENIENCE in the beginning I never received one AT ALL. He assured me the nail would be sent to a lab in California to be tested. Not only that he tried to debate with me about it being a rice shell. Now, l know what a rice shell looks like and l know the texture is fairly soft. I know for a FACT that was a finger nail, it was hard as hell and stabbed my damn tongue. He proceeded to bring out a grain of rice with a shell on it and l then picked it apart to further educate him on the texture and shape of the shell l even had him compare to nail to the shell Absolutely not a MATCH.

There were two flatscreens TVs set up at each end of the bar. The menu was a little starchy but had an array of dishes that I have not seen traditionally on an event buffet.  Their staff did have a few passed hors d'oeuvres which was grilled cantaloupe (different but I kind of liked it). I don't remember the other item as it consisted of meat and I am pescatarian.

I'm going with three, but I could be convinced to upgrade on my next visit.Here's the deal. This is a seafood place, and it's a good seafood place. Someone wrote in a review that's not the seafood version of Ecco s/he had hoped for. I think it is a seafood version of Ecco. The interior is clean, simple, and pretty well laid out. Though we were the first people there, we sat very close to the kitchen entrance. But, you could hardly tell. The tables near the bar are cool - a little elevated, with slightly elevated and comfortable chairs. I liked that a lot.The food is pretty creative. The calamari was very good, if a bit salty. The grilled mushrooms were really good, and the bass with corn chowder was solid. These are all small plates, and we got them for the table. As an entree, I had seared salmon with farro tabbouleh. This was also good; the salmon was cooked very well, though the dish as a whole was a bit oily. A friend of mine had steak, and he did not like it. The dessert I had - rice pudding sundae - was a bit weird. Mostly ice cream, a little rice pudding, and rum raisin caramel on top. Probably a little too creative for its own good.What keeps me from giving this place four stars is the service. It was spotty, pretty unpolished, even if friendly. For example, the server tried to take away appetizers while we were still eating them. He was unsure of the answers to several questions, though he did go to find the answers. When we sat down, we were immediately, and I mean immediately, asked if we wanted a cocktail from the menu, despite not having had enough time to pick up the menu, let alone look it over.

Either it was gossip hour or they are just so miserable they are venting to each other making the atmosphere quickly change to uncomfortable. After we were there for a half hour my husband says to me, \\"why is it every time our waitress comes over and I say anything to her as simple as thank you she refuses to look at me?\\" I then started paying attention and he was correct. She basically only acknowledged me. She would look down or directly at me when he interacted with her. I believe she is uncomfortable with men it was that odd and it made my husband uncomfortable. Her whole energy came across very stuck up and snobby. Not what came from her mouth she was not rude but her persona was odd. She was very limited in her communication almost like she did not want to give us the time of day but needed to. Not personable at all. The manager was also on the floor and he never came over to ask how things were? They do this at The Outback for way less prices on their food! The food was good not the best for those kind of prices. I found the menu a little limited. Starters are different not your average stuff you would normally see on most menus. It was nice to try something new and presentation is very nice but the prices for what little you get is crazy. Steaks were cooked perfect and seasoning was good. However the size of my husband's steak did not deserve the high price tag. We did like our sides and the rolls in the skillet were good.

Easy.This IHOP absolutely crushed step 1. The nice young lady smiled and showed us to our table. It all went terribly wrong from that point forward.\\nWe were seated at the very back where there is an exit only door and the floor is tile, not carpet like the rest of the restaurant. I have seen cleaner and less sticky floors in the men's room at sporting events! Absolutely disgusting. To add insult to injury we had the absolute displeasure of having a filthy trash can being pushed THROUGH THE RESTAURANT and through the exit only doors letting in a gusts of 42 degree air. Gusts in not an exaggeration, our napkins and menus nearly blew off the table. Of course, the poor fellow wheeling the filthy trash can through the restaurant had to get back in and we were once again greeted with the cold gust of air, the very loud sound of plastic wheels on sticky tile, the site of a trash can and the painful reminder that we made a poor choice.We had plenty of time to discuss our experience, so far, as we waited for someone, anyone, to acknowledge our existence. It was not busy and there were plenty of open tables when we arrived. Finally, after close to 15 minutes our server showed up. He was a nice young man and it was clear that he was doing his best. \\"Are you ready to order or do you need more time?\\" Do we need more time? I could have read your menu AND War and Peace by now even with the gusts of air and loud trash can encounters rolling over a sticky floor! We ordered. Nothing complex, just two simple requests: 1. No whip cream and 2. Fresh strawberries as opposed to the strawberry compote. When the food finally arrived it was mostly right, except for the whipped cream and strawberry compote!! To be fair, the compote was on the side and whoever delivered the food politely explained that they do not have fresh strawberries. Sigh.The food was fine. We had to flag down a grey shirt, as far as I can tell the folks in the grey shirts have the power at IHOP, to ask for our bill.

I came here with a friend for dinner not expecting to really be full or satisfied, but we couldn't have been more wrong. We ordered the hummus ($10), meatballs ($14), Burrata ($16), & crispy mac and cheese bites ($12) and were so stuffed by the time we finished all of the food! The portions are very generously sized and really worth the amount that you pay. Our favorite was the meatball appetizer-- juicy meatballs in a flavorful red sauce that sat atop a thick, cheesy, cream polenta. We were nearly licking the plate with that one. As both my friend & I have little knowledge of good wine, when it came to beverages, we scoured the menu looking for the cheapest option possible. We stumbled across a Ros√© on tap for just $9 a glass (score!) and it was super tasty!The vibe of this place felt more like a happening restaurant you might find in NYC than a themed Disney restaurant. It had a very authentic and relaxed atmosphere & it didn't seem like it was trying too hard like a lot of the Disney Springs joints often do.

This is a Japanese owned joint that serves authentic Japanese food.  The whole thing seems out of sorts though because the formality of the kimono service does not really pair well with the luncheonette style room and ambience.  Service is slow and uneven -- but the food is authentic enough and the proprietors are friendly and polite.   We came for the sushi - and my chirashi was quite good (the su was excellent), as were the other nigiri sushi/sashimi offerings we tried.  The eel/crab roll was tasty -- lots of eel and crab seasoned very nicely. The ikayaki was tender and seasoned lightly -- as I like it.  I could have done without the constant chatter of the TV overhead (it kept buzzing and cutting out due to a passing storm) and I probably would have enjoyed my meal better if eaten at the sushi bar, where I could have appreciated the chef's skills rather than the frenzied servers running to and fro from the kitchen trying hard to both prepare the food and service a roomful of customers.

About around midnight, that's when lights were dimmed further..and  more dance music came on while the band took a break.Now, the crowd was definitely the best part.

Essentially, the grown & sexy crowd...minus the typical cheesiness. Everyone was dressed nicely-there was a range of attire from semi casual men with jeans and polos on  to gentlemen in full suits with shiny cufflinks. So ladies, feel free to wear a freakum dress or just jeans and heels...as long as you feel cute, you'll be fine! There were no bustas, ratchets, wankstas, none of that...just Black people having a great time at a Black establishment.

The side dishes (\\"banchan\\") you get when you order non-rice entrees are fantastic. Your taste-buds get to experiment with sweet, salty, spicy, and sour flavors while enjoying your main entree. Most of the better Korean restaurants are located in Beaverton, having one just right off Hawthorne is definitely a plus.PROS - There's a parking lot, and if you go right before dinner starts, there is usually a good amount of parking left. Inside the restaurant, you will find that it is a very intimate setting (dim lights, rich woods, clean). You can opt for grilling your meats (traditional Korean BBQ) or you can order right off the menu for already prepared meals. I have done both at this place, and I find that I like it better when my meals are already prepared for me ;) Don't get me wrong, the Korean BBQ is delicious here! They marinate the fresh meats perfectly and you get cute dipping sauces for everything. If you are ordering off the menu, the spicy rice cakes as an appetizer is sure to please. As a main entree, I always like getting their spicy tofu stew with seafood. CONS - The service can be slow at times, but staff is still helpful. Unfortunately, they charge extra for rice ($2 per small bowl, ouch). Certain Korean restaurants don't, but others like this one, do. POINTERS - If you are going for the Korean BBQ, you are going to smell super smoky afterwards! Not bad if you don't mind the smell :)"},{"name":"Papa Gino's Pizzeria","address":"1018 Lexington St.","city":"Waltham","stars":"2.5","text":"Pizza day at the office.

But...This was the worst Chinese food I've ever had (and I've had some pretty dodgy Chinese take-out at 2 am when I was in college). The crab rangoon was so greasy which made it soggy, and the filling was next to nothing. The pork lo-mein was so bland and the veggies were undercooked. The veggie springroll did not come with any sort of special sauce (like an infused soy sauce or something).And finally, the sesame chicken was undercooked, and had an incredibly strong taste of \\"flour\\" to it. It was definitely dredged too much before it was fried and it made me nauseous. I am so disappointed. Wayyyyy overpriced for the inedible garbage you get.

With a high amount of Scottish Blood in me, I was very excited for what looked like a real find! We were greeted by a friendly waiter and the sound of live music right at the door. PERFECT! Things turned south fast, and by the end we all agreed that this was unfortunately one of the worst meals any of us had every had. Fantastic atmosphere, giving the feeling of being transported back to Scotland, now if only the food could get CLOSE to being delicious\\n-We ordered 1) Clam Chowder 2) their FAMOUS burger 3) Fish & Chips\\n1) Clam chowder was cold when it was brought to us and when we asked for it be taken back to be heated up waiter rolled his eyes and did so. Only when he returned it was STILL cold. Cold clam chowder on a cold rainy night, no fun.. But hey it might have just been a rough night. The real issue is the decently sized bowl had ONE piece of fish in it. Clam chowder with just ONE piece of fish is just potato soup...\\n2) Buger: The burger was very dry and with the exception of the toppings generally lacking any flavor\\n3) Fish & Chips. Call me crazy, but when I order Fish and Chips I always assume the \\"fish\\" is in plural form or at least is big enough to be equivalent to two fish.., not so at Little Haven. For $16 (I believe?) I received ONE small sized piece of fried fish. Fine, it might still be the best fish I have ever had in my life. False. It was one of the worse fish I have ever had. Very greasy, and lacking the crisp coating of a well fried fish. It was mushy, and generally flavorless.\\n4) Both entrees came with french fries which looked DELICIOUS. But unfortunately were very deceiving and were arguably the worse french fries (or chips :) ) any of us had had. They were under cooked, and lacked flavor. Though they looked AMAZING they tasted very bad. To make it even worst the ketchup (appears to be homemade? which usually I LOVE) was ENTIRELY flavorless and very runny. \\n5) The waiter did check in and ask how the food is, and for the first time in my life I responded \\"Unfortunately not very good\\" to which he responded \\"Great to hear! Would you like more water?\\"Overall I sadly would not recommend this restaurant and based on my own experience discourage people from eating there. Boston and Jamaica Plain is filled with countless phenomenal dining establishments where you can pay a comparable amount for a meal but receive much more and the food will have more flavor. We might have been there on a bad day, and based on the other reviews people seem to love it. So maybe we missed something."},{"name":"The Greek Gods Gyro","address":"11301 SE 21st Ave","city":"Milwaukie","stars":"4.5","text":"The guy that works there is a gentlemen. The sauce is so good.

They are extremely active on Instagram which is how my friend and I knew they were open during this 'bomb cyclone' of 2018. By using the hashtag #openinbos this allowed me to quickly scan the area of where we could grab some lunch. After arriving, it was very empty which was expected because it looks like Elsa's castle from Frozen outside. Due to this weather, there was a limited lunch menu. We started off with persephone cocktail which was Citadelle gin, pomegranate, lime, basil, and rosemary. Taking a sip of this drink, you could immediately smell the basil. It was very light and refreshing. The perfect daytime drink. We also ordered two biscuits. These things are very large, fluffy and warm. My biscuit was slightly doughy - probably could have benefitted from another 2 minutes of baking, but this wasn't the end of the world. They came with honey butter that was so sweet it was a great compliment to the biscuits. Since we didn't have breakfast and we wanted the entire menu we ordered two things and split them. - Tray of bbq chopped brisket with macaroni and cheese side. As I have been watching a lot of the new FoodNetwork show - Eat, Sleep, BBQ, I have been craving brisket lately. The brisket just fell apart when you touched it. It was so tender and the BBQ sauce they used tangy and not overpowering. The mac & cheese came with breadcrumbs on the top - which is the only way mac & cheese should be made. It was a decent size portion for a side. I would order this again.- Fried chicken sandwich - this came with vinegar slaw, white bbq sauce, and a sesame seed roll. If you are ever in doubt of what to order when you are here GET THIS. This sandwich is an absolute show stopper. The breading on the chicken was so crunchy. The chicken was so moist. The white bbq sauce was spicy but in the best way. The bun did not get soggy at all from the sauce. I loved everything about this sandwhich. As a side we got the farm salad. This was light and refreshing - it had farro, grapes, roasted brussle sprouts and parmeasan cheese.

It has some flaws but don't judge it by it's minor flaws because most of the time the food is good.  They are pretty hearty with the meat on both tacos and burritos.  I personally like the burritos because the flour tortilla is heated up on the grill.  I think the corn tortilla to the tacos are heated up in the microwave so make sure you eat them right away or else they will become soggy.  This place is known for their steak tacos and especially burritos.  For the most part 88.753% of the time the steak is full of flavor and delicious BUT there 11.247%the steak doesn't have any seasoning taste.  I have only order steak, barbacoa and chile relllono from the menu and dare not to venture out of that.  Their agua de horchata is one of the best and it taste like its made from scratch and not the powder crap.They have an awesome breakfast special!!!  Get breakfast plate buy 1 get one free.  Plate consist of 2 eggs cooked anyway you want (I get mine a la mexicana witch has onions, raw jalapenos, tomatoes) side of beans, rice and a pack of tortillas.  I think the breakfast is about $5.76 and it's not a bad deal considering all the food that you're getting and can split the cost.  I hear their breakfast burritos are good but haven't tried them.Tips to have a better experience:* IF THE DRIVE-THRU has a long line consider going in and ordering your food because the drive-thru will take a while.  * There is no A/C or heater in the dinning in area so make sure you come prepared.

We were first seated to a dirty table (as in ketchup smears across the table). I then ordered two poached eggs with a side of sausage and my partner ordered hash with sunny side up eggs. His dish was tasty (4/5). My dish on the other hand had WELL DONE poached eggs  over soggy toast. (Note to chef: why would you put wet eggs over bread? Doesn't really make sense to me. Nobody wants to eat soggy toast). Anyway a well done poached egg is an abomination to brunch. Nobody wants to cut into a hard boiled egg when they are expecting that glorious yolk to pour out. I also want to mention that my side of sausage didn't come out for another 10 min after the main dishes. Idk tbh seemed like they forgot to put the order in (sort of doubt this because I saw her write my order) or the chef forgot (more likely since they destroyed poached eggs). Also ordered OJ that didn't come out in a while. We were expecting fresh squeezed but tasted like Sunny D (aka high sugar content that's perfect for mimosas).\\n- they did take off the poached eggs from the receipt\\n- coffee refills were slow and infrequent \\n- atmosphere: everyone around us seemed to have an enjoyable time but I did overhear some wrong orders and mishaps so my experience didn't appear unique."},{"name":"Canton Cooks","address":"5984 Roswell Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Love this place!

But this place is legit!FOOD\\nThere are many options that change by the day and they're all delicious. Many guisados, and the nopales dishes are particularly good. There are chicharrones in the corner and salsa to purchase apart from the meal.I was a little disappointed with their tortillas (being a tortilleria and all). I thought they'd taste more homemade, i.e. be thicker and less uniform and commercialized. Turns out they're just like any other local tortilla operation. They're good, they just taste large scale commercial good.SERVICE\\nI ordered to go and was so, so very happy with the service. I got all my questions answered patiently and samples to help me to decide. And I love that although I'm clearly not Latina, I spoke in Spanish and was happily serviced in Spanish (rather than being pretentiously steered back to English, which happens sometimes, despite fluency)AMBIANCE\\nIt's a Mexican market more than anything, and plenty of hustle bustle throughout. You have to order up front. But I wouldn't let that deter you from eating here. There are plenty of tables to sit and enjoy the food and atmosphere on site.

As of Oct 2019 the food and services were extremely subpar for any pizza delivery. I can almost feel the frustration everyone working there is suffering through a simple dinner order, at no point did everyone involved failed to show their disregard. I will no longer do business with Nicole's.It was a simple order of Philly pizza with extra peppers and steak, plus buffalo wings. The driver took an hour to arrive. Will not get out of the car to do his job so I paid him $48 for such a small order including tip while he listens to music in his car. When i opened the order: there are no sauce on the supposedly buffalo wing, it was dry and flavourless. The pizza had no mushroom (a default ingredient) nor the extra pepper I paid for. The dough was cold, machine pressed, and clearly frozen. Tasted way too salty and a little foul. In fact the entire order was cold thanks to the delay. It is the most underwhelming dinner one can pay for with almost $50. I can feel the complete lack of passion and professionalism throughout this transaction. Nobody, not the phone guy that took orders, nor the cook, nor the driver, gave a damn about their customers or their job.

The corn was a little over cooked and fully coated with cheese and sauce. It was a little overpowering in flavor but it sure filled me up.

I'd come back for just the biscuits too, holy moly they were good. They were these dense, fluffy, crispy-on-the-outside, steaming, buttery chunks of biscuit bread that were the highlight of the experience. The honey butter they came with was also fantastic and resisting the temptation to completely slather the biscuits in the butter was very difficult. My friend and I ordered the fat cheeks platter with the pork belly, bbq chopped brisket, and ribs. The pork belly tasted fine but wasn't all that special. The ribs also tasted fine but were kind of dry, not the fall-off-the-bone kind of tender you'd expect from a bbq specialty place. The chopped brisket was fantastic. For our side scoops we got the Mac & cheese (amazing) and the watermelon salad (confusing). I would get the Mac & cheese again but the watermelon salad was... underwhelming. The watermelon didn't retain that satisfying cold crispness that defines the watermelon-eating experience and the \\"salad\\" was just parsley and feta crumble?? I think? It was very busy despite it being a Monday night, but they have a seating section where you just grab a seat/table if you can find one.

There were a lot of empty tables when we got there, but they were apparently reserved. We were seated immediately at a counter, though. The decor and ambience were pretty nice, it wasn't too loud and definitely had the right \\"BBQ restaurant\\" feel.I got a big cheeks tray (two meats) and we got a bucket of biscuits for the table. First of all, the biscuits were great. Very soft and fluffy on the inside, buttery and flakey on the sides. (Though maybe not the best biscuit I've ever had.) The honey butter that came with it was delectable. Together--the slight savoriness of the biscuit and the sweetness and creaminess of the butter paired beautifully. I ordered pulled pork and pork ribs with my tray. The pulled pork was a bit disappointing. I thought it was undercooked and dry--there were still chunks of pork that hadn't softened. I also could have used more fat throughout the pulled pork. There were some chunks here and there but they could have been smaller and more evenly distributed. I also thought the pork could have been more flavorful. I had to pour plenty of their BBQ sauce on the meat to give it flavor and make it a bit less dry.The pork ribs fared better. I thought they were small and didn't have much meat. The ribs at the end were a bit overcooked and hard. The other ribs, though, were juicy and combined muscle, gristle, and fat well. There was good BBQ flavor on these that was enhanced with some tangy sauce.The mac-n-cheese I got for my hot side was not good. It was too salty and I could tell it was made of Kraft singles or something. It had no cheese flavor at all and while the breadcrumbs were a nice touch, it couldn't save the side. The salad I had for my cold side was surprisingly good! Crunchy, fresh greens and grapes, balanced out by the dressing and nuts. The brussel sprouts were a particular highlight in the salad.

It seems like forever ago that my family move to this area and lost its favorite fast food establishment. I recall emailing Chick Fil A corporate and telling them to put a store up here. Actually in this exact location. And they responded that they didn't believe a Chick Fil A would do well in this area and had no plans to bring the company to Oregon. \\nLies. \\nSo my grievances there aren't many ok there is only two; but I hate that unlike other Chick Fil A locations I've pardoned in the past this location does not have the sauce out for you to take. You have to walk up to the counter, wait for assistance and ask for whatever sauce you want. They are willing to give you as many as you want but the convenience of just having them out to grab not taking time away from an employee would could be helping get more orders in was always nice. \\nMy second is that they will not make a grilled spivey sandwich. Apparently this is the owners choice and it's a poor one that automatically loses 1 star from me, yes really. My favorite thing about Chick Fil A in the past was their willingness to go above and beyond the call and to meet customers requests. I could be more than understanding if this was just for opening day as they are terribly busy but it was explained to me that if I come again in a few weeks and order a spicy grilled sandwich i will receive the same \\"no\\" answer. Otherwise the staff (some of whom right now are here from across the country to help train and make sure things run smooth) are all amazingly kind and courteous just as I would expect. They bring your food to you and anything else you could possibly need and check that you are having an enjoyable experience. For me it's really the staff and building that relationship that sets Chick Fil A above all others. \\nThe food is great. Taste is consistent and high quality for being fast food.

Let me start by saying I went and ordered the same breakfast sandwich 3 times in one week. I did order a plain bagel separately on one occasion to taste its quality. The first time I went I feel I received the best tasting sandwich. (Bacon ,egg n American cheese on a plain bagel). The sandwich was full of good quality bacon and nice thick slices of cheese with a not so great premade egg patty on a plain bagel. The bacon and cheese were so good on the sandwich essentially they were the star and left me very satisfied. That day I had ordered a plain bagel by itself however the young lady who took my order seem flustered and did not quite understand me. \\nOn the second day I ordered the same this time and I got the plain bagel I asked for on the first day.The sandwich itself was still good however I notice less bacon was used. Still good but not as satisfying as the first day. The plain bagel by itself did not meet their claim of being just as good as a Brooklyn bagel. When I think of a NY bagel I'm expecting a nice big crusty bagel that just has a thin crisp with a dense and chewy inside with a slight tang. The bagel should have a sheen on it kind of like a semi gloss and not a dull matte finish. The bagel was ok by itself. It was possibly a day old bagel. Would I order a dozen bagels from them? I don't think i would, at least not at full price.\\nOn the third day i ordered the same exact sandwich. This time it was definitely not as satisfying as the first 2 days. I ordered the bagel sandwich and literally received in less than a minute ( possibly 45secs) from ordering. The bagel again tasted as if it was a day old and the amount of bacon and cheese was considerably less than I had previously received the day prior. Now heres the kicker. the egg patty inside was touted as a freshly made egg and advertised on facebook. But it took less time make me a sandwich this day than the others. If your going to advertise fresh made eggs don't go in the microwave convection, put some cheese on a pre-made egg patty you freshly cooked earlier in the day. I rather have the pre-made egg patty from the box you used the two days prior. \\nOverall I was satisfied with their service on the first 2 days. However that last day was not so great. Everyday should be an improvement on the next and not a regression. Cross train all the staff so that they all know how much goes on what and I don't come in asking for \\"John Smith\\" to make my order because he really puts more stuff on it. \\nThe staff is very nice and pleasant. The sandwiches were satisfying those first two days and definitely better than a Dunkin, Wawa or Einstein.

When asking the server for food recommendations, it was suggested we order family style, yet none of the food was appropriate to share - the ceasar salad had good flavor but it was all one piece of lettuce, how do you share that between 5 people? And the pasta was the biggest disappointment of all, especially considering it's an Italian restaurant. Extremely small portions (again, how do you share?) with lackluster flavors and waaay over priced. The rabbit pasta had a small sprinkling of meat, and the pasta with tomatoes was pathetic at best.

Now, I'm sure she gets asked this all the time, so it'd seem that even if she hated the food, she'd have a pat answer, such as, \\"Well, if you like fish and seafood, I recommend the...and if you prefer meat, go for the ...\\" In other words, something that answers the question that would hopefully satisfy a customer. Instead, she replied, \\"well, I really dislike when people ask me that question because in the (#) years I've worked here...it really all depends on the customer's desires\\" and then she changed the subject without letting me respond. This is a red flag for me. It means she either doesn't like the food at all or she doesn't think it's worth making a suggestion. She just asked about drinks and everyone made their requests. When she came to me, I just politely said I hadn't yet decided because it would depend on what I wanted to eat, which was the truth.She left to get us waters and the one cocktail my friend ordered. Both my friends remarked that she seemed annoyed without my asking them, so I knew it wasn't just me who felt it.When she came back, we placed an order for the deep fried Wisconsin cheese curds, French onion soup and the grilled red snapper as the main for me, fish and chips for my one friend and a clam chowder and red snapper for my other. The cheese curds were pretty much how I've had them in Wisconsin, little pillows of cheese slightly more thickly battered and fried. They came with marinara versus a berry ketchup, but were quite good.My French onion soup was pretty good; it was what I needed after getting a bit chilled from being damp all day. Only thing that was off was that I bit into a sliver of plastic and put the sliver on the saucer. I can't figure out what it would've come from, other than perhaps the bag of cheese. My friend said his clam chowder was good, too.My red snapper was good without the accompanying sauce as were the vegetables. Regrettably, my friend's portion was overcooked and therefore tough. Our server had warned us that the plates were very hot, so I'm wondering if after firing and preparing, it sat under the salamander too long. His wife wanted him to alert the server, but he shrugged and just ate some of her fish and chips, which she said was quite good.The other server checked on us and seemed more calm and polite. We weren't sure if ours was off the clock or if she had given up our table; we later saw her again after we'd finished and she asked if my friend wanted another drink.She seemed more pleasant, though a bit flustered when providing the bill. We left about 7:30pm and I asked the staff outside what time they close. They said 7pm, but that they seat customers until 7pm. So we'd definitely not come right before closing (which is annoying for staff).To be honest, it felt as if she'd probably had a really slow shift and just wanted to be cut early, then our table showing up well within a fair timeframe (6:20) to have dinner, she'd have to stay. Either that or she had bad news at home or something, because her entire demeanor was that of someone not really wanting us there and as three fairly kind and respectful people, it made us wonder what we'd done wrong. Anyone can read my other reviews and see I try hard to be fair. I don't want anyone to lose their job, but I do want all staff to understand that we felt as if we had done something wrong by wanting to eat there and that's not a feeling any patron should have. It kind of put a mental damper on an overall great day and we agreed further dinners will take place on city walk, as our dinner the night before at cow fish was an excellent experience with great food and service all the way around (and was somehow less costly, yet higher quality and we ordered just as much if not more)."},{"name":"Tasca Restaurant","address":"1612 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"Ok so let me give you guys an honest review. I personally thought the staff was great however, the environment was definitely outdated and, overall, my food experience wasn't that great at all.1) sangria red wine - definitely felt like we were having juice. It was watered down a lot. The fruits were not fresh because I sat next to the bar and I saw the way it was made. 2) patatas bravas: I felt that it was a bit too over cooked. But must vary on certain days I suppose. Still, didn't like it at all.3) mejjilones: mussels were actually fine, tasty. Nothing extraordinary!4) fried calamari: come on guys, I definitely know what fresh fried calamari tastes like and this was just not it. Super frozen TBH 5) pincho de pollo: just fine! The taste of the chicken was ordinary. Not worth the price.Overall, the place is not worth the price with the type of dishes it offers. Did not want to order anymore than the above five dishes. Wouldn't come again, but I hope one day y'all sit down and get excited to cook. Cooking requires passion and it's an art. You guys can do it!!"},{"name":"Power House Cafe","address":"111 E Lyman Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"I typically order Powerhouse once a week for lunch, and have never had a bad experience.Their chicken here is out of this world.  From getting a chicken shwarma to chili with chicken, everything is always fresh and delicious.  You are paying a little more for higher quality and fresher food.  If this place was a little cheaper I'd probably order everyday.  $6 for a shake is a little steep.The only thing I've had here that I didn't like was the tabbouleh.  The parsley was fresh, but there was literally no dressing on it.  Typically tabbouleh will be seasoned with salt/pepper, lemon juice, mint, etc.  It was very bland the few times I've had it."},{"name":"Renata","address":"626 SE Main St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We had a group of 8 and our server took great care of us.

We also tried the kinoko burger ($8.75) which has blue cheese and mushrooms. This sounded like a gourmet type burger but the combination of flavors just didn't go well together. The burgers come with a side. We tried the lotus chips and sweet potato. The lotus chips are Jin and crispy and very good. They were my favorite item of everything we got. The sweet potato is slices drizzled with a sweet glaze. I didn't care for these. We also tried the bulgolgi bowl ($8.25) which is a generous bowl of rice and lettuce but not that much bulgolgi. Not very flavorful so good if you want a plain dish. The owner/employees are very nice and are very considerate of parties that include children. However, the bar height seating is difficult for people that are handicapped or young kids.

This feeling quickly wore off as the most experienced, intelligent, passionate bartender by the name of Noon (didn't get her last name) talked my friends and I into trying almost all of her fabulous cocktails, two of the loveliest sak√©s any man could ask for, a sample of homemade beer made with thai chilis (please put it on the menu, it's SO good!) and proceeded to tickle our nose's with bags of aromatic flowers which she uses to make her homemade bitters. For those of you out there who respect true passion and care, come and enjoy what was easily the best bar experience I have ever had in this city. I've lived here five years, work in the industry and sample the scene liberally. I'll say it again. Easily the best bar experience in the city.What would drinks be without food? The best of drinks at the best of bars bring us an honest desire to satiate our appetites, big or small, with only the most fresh and delicious food. Save beer and fried cod for public house Brookline, there's another option for that night you want to leave the bar with real swagger and a healthy conscious knowing all that delicious and affordable beautiful cuisine isn't going to slow you down the rest of the night. The food here casually matched the quality of the drinks. Fried ginger glazed chicken wing, shiitake mushrooms with quail egg, Mussels with sake and tomato sauce (my favorite, the freshest and most delicately cooked mussels in boston), Duck breast with soba noodles, Japanese four cheese risotto with short grain rice... then, compliments of the chef, out comes a piece of braised beef short rib with more shiitake mushrooms. The beef was so incredibly tender, it fell apart in your fork like a comb through hair... (perhaps not the most appetizing of synonyms.. but trust me, it was F***ing delicious.)I'll be going back to Umami, soon. And I hope to see more people there next time. Folks, Washington Square is a KICK ASS place to get your grub on... you've got one of the best beer halls in the Boston Area (Publick House), the and I repeat THE BEST lattes, coffee, espresso in NEW ENGLAND (cafe fixe) and now I've found a place catering entirely to my individual desires and foodly obsessions as a healthy, fit and active chef, foodie, and alcoholic (... uh, Umami in case you just started reading). Don't pass on it. Get in your car. There's loads of free parking after 6 that's always available (make sure you've got a DD, those drinks are will catch you up:).

While I think dim sum as a concept is ripe for application in an American restaurant, I felt that Emmer & Rye's application felt like a way to put items that didn't quite fit on the menu in a different offering. The best part of the dim sum we had was their bread and the interesting spreads, but other than that, I didn't enjoy any of the dishes that came on the carts.I do wish our server had adjusted our ordering based on the portioning. For example, there were four of us dining, and the shrimp came with three very small shrimp. In this situation, I wish the server had recommended that we order another portion so that everyone at the table could get a bite of a dish that is a little tougher to share.The main dish that stood out to me in a positive way was the beef tartar, which came with this butternut spread that was absolutely delicious. Other than that dish, I found the food at Emmer & Rye to be tasty, but not particularly memorable. I would love to see Emmer & Rye fully embrace the dim sum concept by adjusting their menu - it's all already small plates, so it could easily be delivered in the dim sum style. The servers are all very knowledgeable about the menu, and I think that this could work for them. As is, the dim sum concept doesn't work.We came to Emmer & Rye as a celebration.

The sushi, salads, cuts of meat and burger all melt in your mouth and could satisfy even the most critical of the Portland foodies.  There is also a comfortable bar with engaging bartenders who obviously put their time into learning the art of mixology.

I fail to see the appeal of the food or the clientele, the latter being your typical stuck up Vancouverite pretending to be someone they're not. Hollywood wannabes with overinflated egos and sense of importance totally disproportionate to their true station in life, but I digress. :) \\nThe location here is truly the only selling point and for the tourist set, no doubt a major draw however there are now 5 Cactus Clubs in downtown Vancouver and that is simply bordering on the obscene. Each new one they build seems to be getting bigger and more ridiculous, a monument to the glory of the chain restaurant. \\nThis Cactus Club is just as much a mausoleum as a restaurant and I'm sure it's reflected in their monthly rent and overhead which invariably gets passed on to you, the customer, via overpriced drinks and food. Hate to say it but the Cactus Club operation is getting a little too big for its britches compared to where it was only 5-6 years ago.October 10, 2013 amendment to my review. I've been back here a few times I admit since my last review. I'm coming to like it better than Cactus Bentall but I suspect that's only because it doesn't look as old and worn. It will soon enough and then we will start this all over again with a Cactus Club in the middle of Burrard Inlet which we will have to take ferry to reach. :-)"},{"name":"Cha Cha Cha Taqueria","address":"3135 SW Moody Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"I did a decent sized order (7 meals) through Uber eats.

When I passed Kouzzina, my eyes popped when I saw this was Cat Cora's restaurant.  I immediately decided I seriously wanted to try this restaurant before leaving, and tonight I got the chance!Kouzzina is meant to evoke a comfortable feel of an old world restaurant while impressing you with its large space.  The waiting area is comfortable with lots of standing room and some benches to chill on as you wait for the nice hostesses to seat you.The dining area is quite immersive.  It's wide with lots of wood furniture spread throughout.  In the middle towards the back is the kitchen, which is wide open for everyone to see.  Off to the side are two fire brick ovens running constantly.  It's quite the sight to drink in!My friends and I started with the dolmades.  Now, I have an interesting relationship with theis dish.  I first had them as a kid when I was about 7 and hated them.  Over the years I've tried them time and time again and often I'm disappointed.  Often the insides were too undercooked or the vinegar was too strong.  This time however the flavors were perfectly balanced and the textures were perfect!  For my entree I had a sampler with three tasting size dishes.  One was a pasta with cheese crusted on top, the other a mini-lamb burger and finally an orzo dish with some chicken.  All the sauces were brilliant in flavor.  I found the use of cinnamon in the pasta particularly interesting and the lamb burger meat was pure awesome, both flavorful and rich in texture (with some nice crunch provided by cucmbers and greens in the burger).So taking my diet and throwing it out the window, I decided to have the baklava which comes with a side of pistachio ice cream (and some crumbled pistachio to boot).  This thing was insanely tasty.  I've had plenty of baklava in my time, but the outer shell isn't always crisp and the inside sometimes overwhelms you with sweetness.  This was a perfect balance and I was very happy!I was super happy to be able to finally try one of Cat's restaurants.  Great service, a wonderful set up and excellent food give this place a high rating in my book."},{"name":"Applebee's Grill + Bar","address":"1220 NW 185th Ave","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"I have definitely had my ups and downs with this location.

They offer a great Happy Hour menu with mozzarella sticks, wings, chicken tacos etc. About the service: \\nI have definitely had my ups and downs with waiters here. I had a waiter who brought me the wrong food and tried to tell me that's what I ordered and argued with me, which I couldn't believe his unprofessionalism that I spoke to the manager after I paid my bill. The insane thing was - he has been working there for as long as I could remember and I was excited when i saw he would be our waiter until the mistake happened and he not once apologized if he had misheard me. \\nWhen I brought it to the attention of the manager - she told me I should have said something to her prior to paying my bill and she would had been glad to take my meal off. (The price - really wasn't my concern, it was the way I was treated) After that incident I had not visited this restaurant for at least a year or so - recently came back around and hmm what do you know! The same waiter still works there but thank gosh I didn't have him! The waitress we had - she was insanely amazing, beautiful eyes. I don't remember her name but she continued to check on us, chatted with us and was efficient in all areas, which I made sure her tip reflected her hard work. We went during Happy Hour! I have also experienced their order to go - it's a super easy process. Order all that looks good and state when you'll be ready to pick up! A little description of your car and as soon as you get their, the employee is already heading out to you. \\nA signature here and a tip for them and your on your way!

It's tucked away off the street and can be a little difficult to find. Once inside, the space feels quite elegant yet funky with dark woods, knick-knacks from around the globe, and electric blue velvet booths. The concept of the restaurant is similarly interesting. Every 90 days the kitchen serves a special menu of dishes inspired by a particular country as well as a roster of favorites from previous countries. The cocktail program globetrots as well with lots of esoteric ingredients.Our server seemed quite knowledgeable about the menu and remained accessible throughout service. We started with two cocktails inspired by Indian cuisine: the Four Vedas and the Mohini's Nectar. My girlfriend is a discerning margarita fanatic and loved the savory, spicy, tequila kick of the Nectar. The Four Vedas had nuanced, layered flavors that, despite its complexity, tasted refreshing and complemented the food well. These drinks represented some of the best libations we have had and warrant a return visit themselves.Our food, while solid, unfortunately did not impress to the degree the drinks did. The Expat, a savory, rich vegetarian take on a bacon cheeseburger was my favorite bite of the evening and made me forget about meat for a moment. My SO raved about the curry coxinhas which comprised piquant spiced chicken encased in a flaky, hearty coating. We found the Thai okra pedestrian and the Korean duck confit too rich and cloying to merit a reorder.The food, as such, earned 3 stars for us but the ambiance and drink program were fives. The Consulate thus proved a solidly four star experience and we will certainly be back for drinks and small bites."},{"name":"Wine Bar George - A Restaurant & Bar","address":"1610 Buena Vista Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"An amazing experience with Tommy as our server.

Customer Service (or lack there of): This place is pretty packed and you really feel squished like sardines.  Make sure you have reservations.  They do turn over their tables quickly so food gets served right away and they will let you know when it's time for you to leave. Not a place to sit and chill.. more like a marathon to eat, go and enjoy your left overs somewhere else. I've never felt so rushed having dinner before. 2. Cleanliness: better than most and you can tell they tried 3. Food: fresh, good quality and decent portion sizes 4. Cash Only: this was my deal breaker.  I get it  if this was a HK cafe.. but our table's bill was about $750 and they expected cash only which they did not tell us during the time of booking.  It was inconvenient and weird that there was literally no option to pay with card. You can tell they want to run an efficient restaurant.

I absolutely love middle eastern cuisine from all regions. I ordered the Fatoush salad and the hummus. While I wasn't blown away by the hummus (it's tasty, but standard fare), the Fatoush salad alone blew me away. All the vegetables were fresh, delicious, lots of variety, and plenty of them. The crunchy homemade pita chips were perfectly fried and a nice contrast. However, the delicate sweetness combined with the sourness and the spices/herbs is what really sets it apart. And the added pomegranate kernels are an excellent touch. Also, the homemade, fresh cooked to order pita bread is amazing as well! Though it's a little more like a Lebanese tortilla than an Arabic pita bread. I came back the next day just to get more of that Fatoush salad and I also tried two falafel. I was a little skeptical at $1/falafel, but they are totally worth it! Not only are they large, they are perfectly fried and seasoned. Very crispy outside, semi-soft inside. However, just like the Fatoush, the sauce completed it. Their tahini is a lighter, creamier, slightly herbed one that is devine! And did I mention the falafel are shaped like donuts?! I highly recommend this place and I'll be back to try the rest of the vegan options too!As a PS, the owner is a lovely man who is generous and accommodating with substitutions, additions, etc. I don't think I was charged either time for the addition of the homemade pickled radishes or pickles.

What kind of waitress would even disappointed a 5 years old? So since we ordered dinner, and it used to come with ice-cream, so we asked, can we at least have the ice-cream for my daughter? then the waitress replied \\"OH, We no longer serve ice-cream with dinner\\".

My husband went in first to inspect, and came out to tell me that is was full, and everyone in there looked like they had been long time customers, so we went in. \\nAs soon as we walked in we were greeted, this was obviously a family owned and operated business. In the waiting area, you can see al the family photos and restaurant history. The old-Italian feel to the restaurant is unmistakable, with the wall paper, and the table clothes, it all cons together. \\nWe asked for the wine list, and they brought out a binder! A bit overwhelming at first, but when you start going through it, it's great, it contains all the photos of the wines, with descriptions and pairing options! Loved it. And not pricy! \\nThey brought out a whole loaf of bread, and immediately we could tell that it was home-made and fresh! Amazing, they even gave us one to bring home. \\nThe dinner menu is delicious, everything tastes fresh and took me back to my Italian grandma's cooking! And the portion size is great!

DH ordered the chicken, which was remarkable for two reasons.  First, it was de-boned.   Second, the chicken was heavily spiced with herbs and it took a few bites in order to realize that the flavor was actually amazing.  The chicken was so tender that it was difficult to tell whether one was eating dark meat or white meat.  (I was 'sandwiched' by two people who ordered chicken, and all I could smell was the aroma of the spices, which was to me, PRETTY strong! Glad I didn't order that.) DH realized that he would have liked to order a salad or other vegetable with the chicken, but the wait staff asked no questions and provided no guidance.   Two of us, ordered the Margherita pizza ONLY because we couldn't find other choices in the menu to pick from. I've had better pizza for much less!

We ordered a starter, a salad course and entrees for two.  The starter took longer than expected to come to the table, but was quite tasty once it arrived. Once the starter course was finished we waited and waited and waited but the server never took away the plates.  It felt like we were waiting a really long time for the salad course, and were surprised by our waiter bringing the entrees while the starter plates were still on the table - No salad!When we pointed this out we were greeted by, basically, a shrug and we asked the waiter to simply remove the salad from our bill (which was done correctly).The entrees were, for Disney, quite good.  I had the whole fish, which was seasoned perfectly but delicately.   I'd recommend it to anyone, but at $37 it was on the pricey side.After finishing our entrees we, again, waited. And waited. And waited.  And eventually our waiter brought us dessert menus and cleared the table.  And we waited.  And we waited.  And he finally returned and asked about a dessert order.  Frankly, by this time we were just tired of the place so we skipped dessert and coffee and asked for the bill.

At 9pm there weren't many \\"eat-in\\" dinners left, but they did a brisk business of take-out while we were there. I had the Cambodian Jungle curry and my partner had the Chili Plum noodles.  Both were very tasty and generously sized portions.  The heat in the curry was perfect, but both sauces felt a bit \\"heavy\\" by the time we finished the bowls.  There was lots of chicken, but I had expected a bit more veg in my bowl.  There's an extra veg option on the menu, but at $2.50, I won't be opting for that any time soon. Also, the Noodle Box charges $0.50 for substitutions. I'm sure they have a rationale for it, but as a person with allergies, it's a bit annoying.  Most of their boxes come with wheat-noodles as the default, and I need to order the rice noodles.  Come on -- you're going to charge me extra for that? While I think the $10 noodle boxes seem fair value to me but the more expensive ones -- there are boxes approaching $15 -- do seem overpriced.  I'll be back to Noodle Box.

If you know how to control your own experience and know how to eat, you will really benefit from a quality place like this which we need more of in these parts. I've eaten some of the best food i've ever been served in this restaurant. I give 5 stars, as the restaurant sits it's really 4 stars, if management continues to train and maintain longevity with staff, it could easily be 4.5 stars. As far as improvements in my opinion which is always good advice and even better because it's free: The menu needs more diverse seafood such as grouper or whole fish like dover sol or whole deboned branzino skin on. Seasoning overall is a bit short.  Dishes need a ton more salt especially the steaks. Nothing worse than a chef afraid to season. Let guests complain the food is a delicious salt bomb. Under seasoned food is rook, over seasoned food is simply a professional mistake. Drinks and wine list is something serious to brag about.

However the last two times I've visited, last time being a Tuesday night, the music was not only rap, mixed with pop, it was so loud we couldn't carry on a conversation. I remember it being Mexican and not cranked up to club level. In addition, there were families there with children that probably shouldn't be hearing some of the lyrics we heard. So rather than linger a bit after dinner, and get dessert, we left. If we want to go to a club, we would.

They definitely added a Japanese aura to it by adding the cute lanterns and table accessories. I'm all for short, simple menus. The one thing I dislike most is having to read a novel-sized menu in order to pick one dish, so I'm really glad they kept it concise. Although I'm sad they had limited both options, they made up for it when the variety of toppings and protein you can choose from. The broth itself seemed a lot creamier than what I'm use to. Other places I've visited in Oregon make it clearer but this broth almost looked like Tom yum at first glance. I personally don't like it too creamy, but it wasn't salty and that's a plus. The chashu pork was really good because the basically pan fry it to a crisp and then put it into the soup. The noodles tasted fine to me, although my friend got a chunk of noodles clumped together and tasted rubbery and she wondered if it was made in store or not.. The appetizers were great for the price and I liked the sauces that came with them. The Kara-gae was cut pretty thin which made it super crispy but some pieces were dryer than others, making them lose their juiciness in the middle but I like my chicken either way. The staff was helpful and attentive, the wait for food was quick, the prices are good, and overall I really liked it! I'm already planning future trips! Best of luck to them!

However, today, the AC was broken. It was a bit toasty sitting at the sushi bar, but I felt pretty good. It was probably about 85 degrees in there... but I digress. Something happened with my food and my boyfriend ended up with his before mine. He was done before I got my food, which wasn't a big deal but was sort of weird. But when I started so chow down, I immediately felt sick... have you ever eaten raw fish in a hot room? I don't think the fish was bad, it was actually great, but when I took a bite of the yellowtail nigiri it hit my palate just so that I thought I'd blow chunks all over the poor sushi chef. I had to subtly spit it out because I could feel my throat moistening itself in preparation for the impending barf. I took almost all of my food home but it was tossed into the box sort of haphazardly so everything mixed together. I guess I was still sort of queasy because I couldn't finish it when I got home, because it reminded me of the fact that I almost barfed hours earlier. I figure it's a one off but I definitely feel like I wasted my money this time. In summary, food: rad. Service: mediocre. Temperature: nauseating. Would I go again? Maybe if I can forget about the fact that I almost threw up. I think I learned my lesson about eating food in a hot room.EDIT: It's the day after and I have been plagued with diarrhea since the mid afternoon. I think it's safe to say I may have gotten sick from this fish, but you can never know for sure."},{"name":"Shanghai Elan Restaurant","address":"1687-4500 Kingsway","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3.5","text":"atmosphere: medium in size with enough seating for a few couples. clean inside. price: affordable. customer service: very friendly.  food: i came here for their dim sum which was good, no complaints.

Good hot pot experience. Spicy broth is significantly spiced (tumeric, cumin, cardamom, star anise, etc); enjoyment depends on individual. Normal \\"milky broth\\" very rich, savory, and lightly seasoned. Good selection of meats, hot pot items, etc. Best item is hands down thick noodles. Please note that this place does not include sauces, sauces are extra (menu says this \\"style\\" does not use sauces).So I don't normally have hot pot so you will have to understand my rating is based on my experience as someone who has had hot pot maybe 3 times in my life. I mean, yeah, it's a hot pot experience, so you'll get the meats, veggies, etc but overall it wasn't something so amazing that I would say that this place is a MUST go. Nothing surprising EXCEPT. THE. THICK. NOODLES. It's like perfectly textured ramen noodles in your broth. This all stems partly from my experience with the all you can eat. I got a healthy serving of the meats, veggies, dumplings, etc. and I gotta say... it's exactly as you expect. If you expect to eat boiled meats, veggies, dumplings... well, that's exactly what you get. There are no surprises. The meatballs and dumplings are a little overseasoned, it tastes like eating a ball or cube of herbs wrapped in meat. The frozen tofu isn't worth it. In my opinion, should just be removed from the menu. The texture after cooking is just like eating a literal (like a LITERAL) sponge. Same goes for the spicy broth. Too many things going on, it tastes like walking into a walk-in closet full of spices from all over Asia/Middle East. It doesn't taste like a classic hot, spicy soup, it tastes like a perfume. And maybe some people like that, but I didn't find it so great. Overall, it's a nice decent place with a decent price with no surprises, but at the same time, doesn't have anything stand out that I would tell people about (as in, this is a MUST GO if you're in Austin) but it scratches that urge if you have one.They also have things like fried buns (donut hole basically) and fried wings.

Just over five minutes later my food finally arrived and I was glad they did not forget to put the ketchup in the bag because who knows how long that would have taken.Stopping at the curb before leaving the parking lot I looked around their drive in stalls and counted two cars. I also looked at my phone to see what time I sent a text before placing my order. Twenty three minutes after placing my order I was ready to leave.Upon pulling out my chilli dog, I was glad it was made correctly with catchup and onions, onions, and no mustard. Upon biting into my dog, I quickley regretted my decision and understood why it took so long to get my order.  Beneath the chili my dog was overcooked and dried out.

My sister pointed out a particular drink named W*t P*ssy and I had to blink 3 times to make sure I was seeing correctly.  Any whoo, we ordered 3 pitchers at $11 each of Long Island Ice teas in which the waitress said it's a better deal to order as a pitcher than as seperate drinks and when she brought them, I had to blink 3 times again.I was thinking pitcher like a pitcher of lemonade size but that pitcher was equal to 12 ounces and full of ice which watered the drink down.Although, the taste of the drink was decent. there was no buzz, tipsiness or nothing from this drink especially in comparison to what I have had before.The music consisted of mainly Rap, some R&B and very, very little Reggae.\\nSince no one seemed interested other than bopping their heads and dancing in their chairs at their tables, we finally got up and started dancing and it wasn't until 30 minutes or so of just us having fun that people started slowly joining us on the dance floor.Overall, not too bad of a place to go for Happy Hour, the police was parked in front, so that gave some level of comfort about any drama going down.For me though, I'd prefer a place that offeres live jazz band and grown classy crowd where women don't feel the need to be twerking..... and smoking is not allowed.

Being lovers of all things related to cheese, it seemed like there was no way we could go wrong.  Well, it looks like I was way off on that.  For the price of their cheese board, I expected just a little bit more.  I wasn't looking for a \\"value sized\\" portion, but it's pretty sad when you get more food on your plate in Europe than you do in Texas!  And the meat board?  The tiny slivers of cured meats and the squirt of p√¢t√© would hardly satisfy one person, let alone two people as they casually emptied one of their (frankly) overpriced bottles of wine.  As far as the ambiance goes, the environment isn't exactly conducive to a nice evening out with friends or a date.  I could hardly hear my companions over the din.  If I'm going to shell out big money for cheese and wine, I don't want to feel as if I'm in a crowded bar on 6th Street, getting ignored by the rude waitstaff (it took forever just to get someone over to even take our order) and having to try to ignore drunk people lacking volume control.  You want cheese?  You want tasty meat? Wine?  Almonds and all of the other delicious accompaniments to a proper cheese and meat board?  Go to Antonelli's and have one of the highly qualified and attentive people there help you find exactly what you're looking for and have your own cheese party at home.

However, here's where the stars start disappearing.  I am not convinced, however, that the food and drinks are completely worthy of the price point, particularly at lunch.  I am simply not a fan of $10 bloody marys on Sunday afternoon in a city where you can get equally good bloodys for $2 -$5 during Sunday brunch hours at many restaurants.  The bloodys which were definitely unique, and overall pretty good, but a bit too thick for my taste.  Secondly the lunch menu prices ($11-23, with the majority $14+) are substantially out of line with other restaurants in its category, and I did not think the taste of the two entrees (Fried Oyster Sliders and Trout Sandwich) I sampled warranted that pricing level. Good, but not $14 (sliders) good .  Same with the $9 bowl of clam chowder.  Unfortunately the restaurant was nearly empty on a Sunday at 1:00 p.m., which might be a sign that changes will have to be made very soon to the lunch menu, or they need to speed up the brunch launch.

I'm not quite sure what it was - but this had the most lovely taste.But hey there Mr. DJ-who-plays-a-tribe-called-quest-every-other-song - could you turn down the tunes a bit? I'd rather not have to yell across the table as if this were some two-bit dance club.Entrees were served very promptly and everybody enjoyed their dishes. I got the one vegetarian dish and it was fantastic. But apparently they think I should be going on a diet cause my paltry portion was the right size for a petite girl. I wonder if they accidentally gave me a half portion. Polished that off right quick. I ended up helping a couple of my companions out with their dishes.We got a couple desserts and these were a bit of a disappointment. Now don't get me wrong - I love creativity when it comes to food - but somehow these were just a bit too *ahem* creative. They both had an offsetting mix of savory and sweet flavors which just didn't work for any of us.So what am I saying? Great food at good prices! Courteous, albeit a little dopey, waiting staff. Trendy, loud atmosphere. A nice place overall, and with some minor improvements it could be great!"},{"name":"Hale Pele","address":"2733 NE Broadway","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This place does not have a private parking lot but there is plenty of street parking.

They even bottle and sell their own yummy salad dressing.  You'll definitely get an authentic Persian-Meditteranean feel here (which is great!).  In typical European or Middle Eastern style, I recommend asking for either that day's special or having something recommended.  Most likely, you'll try something new as well as getting a delicious meal.  I should also mention that most of the cuisine in this place (or similar) are usually gluten free and have a very Vegetarian friendly menu.  Even if you're a carnivore with no food restrictions, you'll find yourself eating a very health and gratifying meal.This location is still getting started as their signage was not up when I ate there.  I also know that the staffing is evolving as in their original store you were dealing with the husband/wife owners.

I also added on a hot platter of Crispy Cauliflower since I had a bigger group.After scheduling my order, I got a call from a lovely woman at the restaurant to let me know they were out of steak/lamb (their supplier was out), so I got two chicken platters in the feast instead. She also let me know that they close at 4, so even though I scheduled pickup at 5:30, could I pick it up earlier. It was strange that the website let me schedule pickup for after they were closed (they had a bunch of time slots available for me to choose from), but I didn't have a problem with this. My event was at 7, so she suggested putting the hot items in the oven to keep warm. She also let me know where to park so they could bring everything out to my car.I got a call just as I was pulling in the park and they made sure to bring out two large cardboard boxes of neatly packed food trays- one with cold items and one with hot. Then they gentlemen who brought the food out helped me fit it in the car and arrange it so it was sturdy. They also gave me a heads-up on the setting for the oven to keep it warm.All of this communication and help with the food was sooooo appreciated as it was 96 degrees out and I am a tiny person who has trouble with heavy boxes. I also loved how communicative they were throughout the process.Without a doubt, I'd turn to HB again should I have to feed a group.

The first day, we ordered a skinny skillet with added bacon as well as a short stack of chocolate chip pancakes and a side of sausage links. The skinny skillet was pretty good but just a tad bland. Sausage links were pretty good, too. Chocolate chip pancakes were amazing! Perfect amount of sweetness, yum.The second day, we just had to have those pancakes again because they're so darn good!

So, be mindful of this if you are planning a trip.We were also not very impressed by the food fare. The pasta was very delicious but if you're going to pay over $20 you expect more than 8 pieces of very small pasta that look like appetizers. The pizza was not good. It was very watery; you literally could see water pooled on the pizza and slip off when you picked it up. The pizza just kind of tasted like watery dough with a little bit of tomato and sausage. The best part of our meal was the arugula salad (which was just arugula, parmesan, lemon, and pepper).Finally, after all of this the service was fast, yes, but not very friendly or kind. We felt judged by not only the host but also the 3 different wait staff that came to our table for various things. My partner and I are around the age of 30, but we both could pass for about 20 years old. The entire time we felt as though we were being talked to condescendingly as if we didn't belong there.

It is in a resort, so the prices were always expected to be hIgher than comparable fare, but that's expected at he Gaylord Palms. This time, I will not. Instead I'm posting this review hoping to get obviously marginal management at the entire hotel.\\nThe service was OK, except our waiter seemed hurried and confused, not just at our table, but the others that were in visual sight. He did offered few suggestion or \\"tips\\" on options and expected outcomes. Nice guy, just not a great waiter. One of the busboys did a much better job.....\\nThe food was just OK. The Steak Tartare was extremely good; a large portion served on toast point with large capers. Next was the lobster bisque. The base/ broth was fair, but the lobster had a fishy taste, like left over meat that they didn't sale in time. It should have been trashed.\\nThe biggest disappointment was the Del Monica. While enormous, it had been trimmed poorly, and the inedible, dry-age coating was difficult to trim from the meat, leaving a large amount of waste. The steak was tough and rubbery, and had absolutely NO flavor. I cat surmise what they did to it, but eat was not right. One bite, and I sent it back. At our request, they efficiently replaced it with a very good 8oz. filet.\\nThe redeeming point, was that the waiter brought us a new replacement order of our Truffle Fries, which were superb!\\nAnd the on the waiter's behalf (since I've already \\"trashed\\" him), he made the recommendation of the Chocolate Cream Br√ªl√©e, which was divine..\\nThere are better steakhouses relatively close to the resort, so until Old Hickory makes adjustments, try those first.\\nAnd the entire Gaylord Palms is suffering from an obvious lack of the \\"old\\" management and operational style that set it apart from other venues.

We weren't expecting that and were actually looking for a nice dining experience. For a restaurant with no real table service, this place is quite expensive for what you're getting. After spending a summer in Japan, I was looking for some authentic dishes that I remember. The menu definitely brought me back to Japan, so that was really awesome. In terms of food quality, everything was pretty great. The ramen flavor was okay, not as great as I remember in Japan, but still good. We got the tuna and the salmon poke and both tasted pretty fresh. I liked the salmon better, my husband liked the tuna better, which is pretty typical of us at sushi, so those were both really good. The seaweed salad in the poke wasn't the best, I've had much better at much much cheaper restaurants. We had the shishito peppers and the bonito flake was an awesome touch, loved those. We also got the pork bun, which nobody liked, it had pork belly inside and wasn't that good, so nobody was thrilled about that. At the register I asked about hot tea for the table, she rang it up and then it came out as a single cup. I asked, confused, as I thought I got tea for everyone, and she did eventually bring out more, so I'm not quite sure what happened there. Everyone that works here isn't very friendly, and for being such an informal setup, this place isn't very kid friendly either, although they did have a high chair. All in all, this restaurant would be a solid 4 stars if they had actual table service and pushing a 5 if everyone that worked here was kind. It's not really fair that we had to leave a tip before we got very mediocre service, because you really don't know what you're going to get ahead of time.

We ordered the chicken salad croissant, the quiche lorraine and the caramelized apple danish. The positives: The quiche was wonderful with a slice of melted Swiss on top. I'd definitely recommend.  Really quick service and food delivery. The \\"mehs\\": The chicken salad croissant was okay. I liked that it wasn't loaded with mayo, and I really enjoyed the combo of ingredients.  Unfortunately, the chicken was dry, under-seasoned and cubed too large. Because they don't overdue the mayo, and the ingredients are cut a bit too big, there's nothing to really bind things together. It becomes more of an open-faced sandwich and not really something that can be picked up. The caramelized apple danish was good but not \\"holy crap I'm stuffed but can't stop eating this thing\\" good.  Maybe better as a snack with a latte or something. The negatives: This is literally a cafe, not a big establishment so seating is LIMITED.  Go prior to, or after, lunch hour.  Those of you that like to set up camp and do your office work should do everyone a favor and move to a Starbucks.

Maybe it was a positive review or a nice ad by the restaurant, but I am warning you to stay away.  This place USED to be good in the early 2000s, but it's absolutely horrible now.Yes, the salads are big, but it tastes like something you'd buy prepared at Stop n Shop.   I'll take quality over quantity any day.  Plus, if you're like me, you'd probably prefer to have your health over a filling meal.  The salmon was not cooked properly - raw in the middle - and I certainly did not feel well hours after my meal.  And I only have two words for the  warm goat cheese salad: Super Disgusting!While I do make the food sound horrible, what was worse was actually the service.  My non-white friend came to the restaurant first and asked if there was a table available without a reservation.  He was told no and that'd be at least a 1 hour wait.  When I met him outside the restaurant, we went on my iPhone and launched the Open Table app and saw they had plenty of seatings available.  Of course, we booked it and just went back in.  The hostess was notably embarrassed, and sat us in some crap seat by the bathroom.  Of course the restaurant was not close to full, so who knows if my friends rejected seating was the cause of racial discrimination or a dumb hostess.  I would say both.Our waiter was some BU frat student, and he was clearly apathetic about his job.  Instead of seeing if any of his tables needed anything, he spent most of the night  in the corner picking at his ear.  In our loser seats, we had a great view of the salad station and saw our entrees sit untouched for fifteen minutes before BU dude decided to grab them.So there you go - a too familiar tale of a formerly good restaurant that has rested on its laurels and is now a possibly poisonous, probably racist, and definitely poorly run establishment.

My mother in law tried the eggs Benedict and carb cake and I had a NY strip with a side of the biggest onion rings you've ever seen , I mean they brought out 9 of them and I could only eat one that's how big they were and they were fantastic ! It was a perfect Mother's Day treat and a delicious meal Your probably wondering , why only two stars then ? Like I said I had a wonderful meal. But with me customer service goes a long way with me. When we went out to retrieve our cars from the valet I was informed that my car wouldn't start \\"and there's something wrong with it\\" I was a little confused as the car is only 3 weeks old , what could be the problem ? It only took me 15 seconds to figure out what went wrong , they left the lights on ! Ok , shit happens, no problem. I asked if they had a battery jumper or jumper cables. \\"No ! Why would we have that?!\\" I almost fell out when he said that. Finally the manager comes out to speak with me, they found a waiter that had jumper cables and we finally got the car started. My gripe is with the manager tho , he offered an apology but not once offered my family water while waiting outside in Florida heat for a solution to the problem. I'm Hispanic but don't speak Spanish. He was speaking to me in Spanish and acting like we were friends the whole time. Very unprofessional. I was made to feel like because we share the same heritage I was supposed to be cool with stupidity and carelessness.

I asked if other items were available to order (like the other items from their regular lunch menu) but the server said no. The other thing that was bothersome was that one of the menu items was not available because one of the ingredients had run out, so the chef said he won't make the dish without one ingredient (which wouldn't have altered the dish a lot, in my opinion). This was understandable...But what really irked us about this place was that the chef would not allow the tables to be split up. Don't know the reason why, but he was very strict about it. For instance, 2 people were sitting on a table for 4 but 2 tables were pushed together so they took up the whole table. There was clearly enough room to split the tables but the chef still refused. So, people who were coming in had to wait for a table to free up so they can sit there. Another situation was when a mom came in with her daughter in a stroller, the chef made her wait for a table until one was available, even when one of the tables could've been split and there was more than enough room for others to walk by/in between.He didn't seem to be too apologetic about it, but I guess if it's his restaurant, he can do what he wants.

The kalua pork was a little over seasoned and borderline inedible. I can't even remember what it was served with, but that side was more edible than what I ordered as a main. The best part was likely the group that sat next to us. Just a group of 20 something friends, with two dudes who shared a big drink,served out of a pineapple and having a really great time. They made me laugh a number of times."},{"name":"Candi's For Breakfast","address":"660 Irwin St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Candi's has a great hook -- the stuffed biscuit.

We've been trying to go out more on weekend mornings, mostly to coffee shops or bakeries, because breakfast is usually cheaper and we like to be lazy and read the day away. Today, we picked Staufs for our hangout. Firstly, even on a busy Saturday morning, it was pretty easy to find a seat. We started with some coffee. I had a Buckeye latte. It was rich and frothy in tip and overall delicious. It wasn't too heavy on the peanut butter or chocolate flavors either, which was good. My boyfriend had a double latte and was pretty satisfied with it. We also had some hot apple cider with lunch and that was the best cider I've ever had. I know they don't make it there, but it was perfect for a chilly fall day. We both had sandwiches for lunch. I had the BLT and I was a bit disappointed because the menu said it was a pork belly BLT, but the girl taking our order said it was just a regular BLT now. I wish I would have gotten something else now, but there's always next time. My boyfriend had the grilled Cuban sandwich, which I tried and it was super yummy. It was ham, pulled pork, swiss cheese, mustard, and pickles. It was a great mix of salty pork and spicy mustard and sour pickles. Awesome. We both had the french fries, which were very thick cut and they were good, but just a little greasy. They were covered in lots of fresh herbs that were tasty and came with garlic aioli(which is just fancy mayo) but that was the best part. All in all, this is a solid place to relax on a weekend morning, have a cup of coffee, a bite to eat, and enjoy some good company. This will be a repeat on our list for sure."},{"name":"Num Pang Kitchen","address":"800 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"So, I'm heading out, and I see two people standing at the door call considering this place.

My expectations were set high, but they were exceeded on a pleasant surprise! Not only that, but I'm heading back here right now. Might be time for a bowling league event nearby but there's plenty of other restaurants and I'm still returning here. That's saying something!Still, there were a couple execution errors keeping this place from that fifth star.The bread was much better than I expected. It was nice and soft, despite what the photo implies. The pork was very tender and flavorful, and they didn't skimp of the meat. My Issue, and the reason why this rating is not five stars has to do with consistency. I found the pork to be various thicknesses throughout the sandwich: half of it to five spices where are more prevalent, and another it was all sauce (couldn't taste the spice as much). In terms of veggies, while I really liked the combination, just a little more would be nice to offer that balance of crunch and freshness. I'll also say I would like a tad more consistency here as well of what is where."},{"name":"Toasted","address":"1945 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Counter order and rather small place but reasonably priced.

We were greeted just outside the entrance by a barbie doll whose only apparent purpose is to smile and direct people to the front desk. I guess they cater to patrons who can't find the host stand. The woman at the desk smiled and directed us to the woman standing next to her. This third woman pointed us to the waiting area. A fourth woman showed us to our table. They should consider investing in one competent hostess, rather than have a clique of women playing 'hot potato' with the guests.  After the third time I said \\"table for two please\\", I was exasperated.When I came with a group, they insisted that as a table of 8 we would automatically be charged an 18 percent tip. What a load of bull crap. Tipping is supposed to be optional, and used to be 10%. Now they demand 18% up front, as if serving a group of 8 is harder than serving 4 tables of 2. Any server that feels that way isn't cut out to be a server. I get to say this because I spent a decade in this business.A Cactus Club manager responded to my review saying they charge the higher gratuity because the kitchen has to work harder. My chef husband has this insight: The kitchen staff get tipped out a percentage of sales (approx 2% shared by all the cooks and the dishwasher). If guests tip more, the server pockets the extra. If you love the food, hand a chunk of the tip directly into the hands of the cooks. Do not let these people dictate gratuities, which by definition, is \\"something given VOLUNTARILY\\".At least the food is decent. They make a good burger, and their salads are filling. The decor seems nice, but it's kind of hard to tell. They are so busy, I've only ever been sat inside, near that front desk. The art work is a confusing mix of ethnic masks, and 80's prints.

There are two entrances. One is inside the Crystal and another one is outside. My boyfriend and I have passed by this restaurant so many times. But, we still didn't get a chance to have a try. Finally, we got a chance to give a try on early Saturday Morning at the beginning of this year.We got in from the entrance inside of the Crystal Mall. Inside the restaurant was smaller than what we expect. There are the couple of four people tables and three or four big circle tables in this restaurant. Traditional Chinese decorations and settings.Since we were at the restaurant early in the morning when the restaurant was just opened, the staffs were eating their breakfast at the restaurant. After we arrived at the restaurant, I quickly found a table and sat down. The server brought the menu and some hot water to us.After few minutes looked at the menu, we decided to order some small dim sum dishes for breakfast.Spoon, Chopsticks, bowls, cups, and plates are nice and clean in Chinese style settings.$7.50 Shanghai small wonton chicken soup. Growing up, a bowl of Shanghai wonton soup was definitely a treat. My grandmother always made them at home because it's super easy to make and takes so few ingredients. The taste of Shanghai small wonton chicken soup is exactly like my grandmothers' wonton soup. The wrapper of wonton is super thin: silky and light as a cloud. The soup is boiling hot and tasty. Love this soup so much.$4.50 Shanghai Spring Rolls (3pcs). It serves with some a lighter Shanghai red vinegar for dipping! The taste was great. fry the spring rolls immediately after assembling. We didn't want them to sit out for a long time, because the wrappers can become soggy from the moist filling. This dish was OK. If it has more meat inside the spring rolls, it will be better taste.$5.50 Shanghai Style juicy pork buns (6pc). It's one of my favorite dim sum dishes. Inside the pork buns are little pockets of gelatinized broth made from chicken, pork and cured ham. The pork buns were homemade and juicy. There are lots of meat in the buns. It was super hot. The taste of the food is very authentic and delicious. I love it.$6.50 Marinated beef wrapped with pancakes. A crispy flaky chewy scallion pancake, fresh crunchy cucumber and a warm melt in the mouth tender beef with a sweet and savory sauce all throughout. My boyfriend's favorite dish in this restaurant. He told me that the taste of this food more like Beijing Ducks. Inside of duck meat, this dish is used Beef.$7 Chinese Donut and Salty Soy Milk. This Savory Soy Milk Soup with deep fried Chinese Donut is a popular breakfast/brunch item in China. It's basically a soy milk soup, curdled slightly with the vinegar, and flavored with scallions, sesame oil, pickled radishes, and the crispy Chinese deep-fried Donut. We supposed to order Chinese Donut. It turned out we ordered the wrong dish. We got this one. It's hot, well cooked. But, we dont really like it.All the food in this restaurant were well cooked, tasty, and delicious. The prices of the food was a little bit more expensive than other Chinese Dim Sum Restaurant.

You're either in a strip mall or non existent when it comes to places like this. That said on to my review, Papa Gino's has been one of the most consistent pizza's ever, PERIOD. If you like that sauce, you know what I am talking about. The cheese is great, they have the ratio down to a T and they train everyone the same. You literally can't fuck it up, or can you???? Fast forward to a Monday night Patriots game and a houseful of couples ready to play some hold em'. I had seen that they had this special for $25.99 two pies, Cheese (Large), bread sticks, wings (your choice of flavors) and a 2 liter. I created an online account this time around because last time I ordered take out it took much longer than the phone rep estimated. This time I strategically waited an extra 10 minutes on top of the estimated email confirmation. I walked in to pick up my order which was 2 of these specials, meaning 4 pizza's total and the other things included. I watched my wings sit in their pick up glass oven, then painfully watched my pizza's go into this same holding bin one by one as well as my 1st order of bread sticks, all along they are working as fast as they can, but certainly very inefficiently as well. There was one kid behind the kitchen enclosure, one kid making pizza's, a delivery driver and who I believe to be (the manager) trying to run this place. 4 people total, but one of which is clearly a delivery driver. What happens next? 42 minutes of my life that I will never get back. I finally get my food 52 minutes after my estimated pick up time. I know what you are thinking, place must have been packed or it's a busy time? NOPE none of that, there were literally 5 other people (3 tables) in the entire place. The manager apologized for the delay, but I was numb at this point and didn't even want to complain, becauseI actually felt bad for him.The employees here clearly don't give a shit, they were nice, and I am sure don't believe they are doing anything wrong, but they work at a snails pace and clearly aren't paid on production. My take, hey corporate, do us all a favor and CLOSE THIS PLACE this is the 2nd time I have had to deal with it taking way too long.

We came on a Sunday afternoon to celebrate a birthday and it was a disaster.I made a reservation over the phone and that went smoothly as I we were seated shortly after arriving. Of course since we were going to eat the food off the grill we had to share a table with others which at first was a bit awkward but eventually everybody got over it. Our server who took our order and drinks was very friendly and sweet as he flamboyantly pranced around making jokes and entertaining us. The soups and salads came out quick, fresh, and delicious. Once our cook came out it was a young white male with a name tag that said Bruce. (Still not certain that that's his real name LOL) since I'm vegan I ordered vegetables only and told them that I had an egg allergy and no butter when cooking. A few jokes later my food was the first and only on the grill. After it finished and he was ready to place it on my plate he scooped up the rice and veggies with his cooking utensils and some of it fell on the grill and table. He scooped it up off the table and tried to put it in my plate saying \\"5 second rule!\\",......HE WAS CRAZY!!! If I wanted to eat off the table we would not have plates. From that point on I was over him. He tried to do tricks..... dropped and cracked an egg TWICE. Once on the floor and once on the grill. I mean I get it, the tricks are difficult but cmon, if you can't do it I don't think you should be trusted with fire and tossing around food and cooking tools that could potentially harm your guests. I still don't remember seeing I'm clean off the floor. As he cooked everything was sticking to the grill so my friend complained about her food being burnt. To top this eventful dinner off there was some drunk lady hanging around the bar who came and tried to sit at our table since someone got up to use the restroom. She went around our entire table trying to shake everyone's hand and got mad when no one wanted to touch her. Everyone was trying to eat and this lady was obnoxiously yelling and invading personal space, I asked our server and another server that passed if they could get rid of the lady and both told me no.

The large round disk with colorful toppings. Unfortunately, I didn't love the dish as much as I wanted to. Watermelon not sweet enough, feta not salty enough, and peppers brought heat, but not flavor. \\n~ Snapper crudo was another cool idea, but not my fave. The bok choy leaves were a bit past prime and the goochujang apple combo just didn't win me.\\n~ Summer squash was a surprise winner. Loved the thin layer of toasted cheese melted on the zucchini. A bit expensive ($13) for a quarter of a squash, but really tasty.\\n~ Culurgiones- stuffed, light as air pasta pillows with sweet tomatoes and a brown butter sauce. Delish!\\n~From the dim sum cart: Oysters and spiced melon were both fine small bites ($3 each). Sourdough was warm and tasty with farmer cheese + herb spread, but not cheap ($5 bread, $4 cheese), Johnny cakes were ok and same for the grilled corn with a spicy sauce.\\n~ My fave of the night was definitely dessert. Brioche bread pudding was divine. The \\"bread\\" was crunchy brownie croutons and came with a warm rum cream and scoop of sweet and salty ice cream. Best dessert I've had in a long time.OK drinks.

I'd stick to wine next time.Friendly staff. Once we were seated, our server made helpful recommendations about what and how much to order. He took the time to explain the philosophy behind the food (avoid waste, stay seasonal, keep it local) and the process that goes into making it (literally months to make the \\"bread amino ice cream\\" in our dessert). I learned the chefs are from Arizona, and while I wish them success here in ATX, I wouldn't be sad if they decided to move home and open a place like this in my home town.On the pricier side, but the creativity and care that go into every dish make up for it."},{"name":"Musashino Sushi Dokoro","address":"2905 San Gabriel St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I have been to many types of restaurants in Japan and Musashino can hold up to any of them.

Let's rewind a little...The decor of the shop is rather dark and cool. Everything is clean, but there isn't much seating and only one table for four. It's unfortunate since this kind of shop really encourages chilling out, but not a huge deal since I'm always here alone with my friends. Plus, they have emoji uno and if there was any reason to go it would be to eat crepes and play this damn game. Anyways, onto important things like the actual dessert crepes, they are b-o-m-b. Made fresh to order, the crepes are very filling and can feed 2-3 people for dessert. I had the Matcha Azuki several times and loved it. We also tried their rolled ice cream which was pretty fab. Nothing was too sweet or too bland. I thought it was perfect for me. Everything is also large for one person so on the price point of $7-8 per dessert, I think it's really worth! Oh, they also have free fruit infused water. Super refreshing!! I'm looking forward to the day they add some drinks to the menu. So I'm only docking a star because things just take a long time and they had forgotten our order once. It's not a huge deal since by this point, I'm used to rolled ice cream being forever. The best part is one of the insanely attractive tatted boys who works on some nights. If only to go to bless my eyes, I will still do it. Ugh.

Unfortunately it wasn't all that great. I ordered the greek salad with grilled chicken. The grilled chicken was delicious and plentiful, my problem with my meal was that underneath all of that delicious chicken and feta cheese there was no greek salad to be found. It was actually just a garden salad that reminded me of salad out of the bag. I was really missing the cucumbers, mesculin lettuce, and maybe some spinach, and the pita bread(which I love) was as hard as a rock and more than likely stale. After going back on the website and reading the description of the greek salad it is really just the garden salad with feta and chicken, shame on me for not noticing that. Would I try them again, maybe. Their service was nice, fast, and friendly but I would not order a salad of any kind again, it leaves a lot to be desired."},{"name":"Flyers Wings & Grill","address":"5621 W Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Flyers is a great wing place.

The teens with us both wanted the lemon shrimp and pasta. Scott warned them it was more lemon than garlic. The kids were fine with that and said it was very good. My friend got the steak and it was also good except they season it with rosemary and she's not a fan of rosemary (but we tasted it and liked it a lot). A nearby table had the surf and turf; it looked good but they said it was just ok.
