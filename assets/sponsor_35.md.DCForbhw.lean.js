As with most locations in this area, parking can be tricky in the Short North.\\n\\n2) Go on an odd day of the week at an odd time. Primetime on the weekend can be difficult to find a table. You may have a 2+ hour wait. Been there, done that. Not entirely worth it. Fear not! Go on a Sunday at 8 p.m. We went and had many seating options, but decided to hang at the bar. Quicker to get your margarita! \\n\\n3) Since you may be sitting at the bar, you are required to order a margarita. Margaritas are served in a mason jar, which is always a cute touch. They are fairly strong so one may be enough. They are pretty yummy so you may order a few.\\n\\n4) Once you've had a few margaritas, you probably should eat something. So what should you eat? Order some chips. Yes, I said order. Chips and salsa are going to cost you $3, but they are well-worth your bucks. You get two varieties of salsa - one is green and mild, the other is red and smoky. And, those chips are pretty darn tasty too! They give you more than enough for sharing between two people.\\n\\n5) Finally, when you start to get serious, you'll want some more substantial food. Get the tacos. They have a nice selection of choices. In my opinion, the fish taco is the best. But, honestly, I can't complain about any of the tacos.

Via Napoli is located at the very back of the Italy Pavilion and was added as part of the expansion a few years back.  It is intended to be a play on dining at a Pizza Joint in Naples, and the 3 Large Pizza Ovens in the restaurant are named for the 3 Volcano's in Italy. \\n\\nVia Napoli will run you 1 Sit Down Dining Credit.\\n\\nThe Magical (Pros):\\n\\nThe Pizza is delicious.  I love Pizza, and I have eaten a lot of it from all over.  For me this is some of the best Pizza I have eaten.  I am partial to the Prosciutto and Melon Pizza.  I thought this would be a bit off, but I could literally not stop eating it.  The Prosciutto is some of the best I have ever had (it literally melts in your mouth), the Melon was Fresh, and the dough was cooked to perfection with amazing flavor from the ovens.  The ingredients are all specially sourced from Italy, and the water comes from a special Well in PA that has the same chemical balance of the water in Napes to ensure the closest thing to quality.  This is probably a good thing because if Florida water is the issue no wonder Pizza Planet is such a disaster :) \\n\\nSangria.  A Pitcher of Sangria.  Need I say more?  I believe this is some of the best Sangria in Disney.  The only time I ever had better Sangria was at Spoodles (now Kouzzina... I miss Spoodles!) I could sit and drink the whole Pitcher myself, but I guess it's only fair to share. \\n\\nDessert. Zeppole di ricotta (ricotta cheese-fried dough, whipped cream and chocolate sauce) is SO good.  I am a Tiramisu fan... I find it hard to ever resist ordering it when I see it on a menu, but these little balls of fried goodness are the one thing that keep me from ordering my traditional treat... for that they should win an award. \\n\\nThe Wicked (Cons):\\n\\nPrice and Portions.  Why is this listed as a Con?  Well, in my opinion it's a con depending on how you are paying.  If you are paying out of Pocket you might find the prices a bit high for a Pizza, but keep in mind you can really share a pizza, an Appetizer, and Dessert here with someone else and be satisfied.  If you are on the meal plan the only con is that you won't have enough room to finish all this food.  You get your own Pizza... it's insane!  \\n\\nThe Noise Level and Crowds.  For me Via Napoli feels like a Quick Service, but it's a sit down.  Yes, the restaurant is very well decorated, but the tables and seats, the crowds, and the noise make this place feel like a Quick Service with Waiters.  This for me wouldn't keep me from going, but for some people it might drive them insane if they are looking for more of the formality of Tutto Italia next door.  This is a completely different experience.  \\n\\nIn the End:\\n\\nI personally love Via Napoli, but I think it attracts a certain person.  By nature I am an extrovert, and I love being around people.  I think this is a fun, loud, enjoyable place to kick back from Sangria, Pizza, and have a good time with family and friends.  If you are looking for the best Pizza in Disney this is THE Place.  You have to decide what you want when it comes to Italian dining, but for me Via Napoli comes out on top."},{"name":"Mighty Fine Burgers Fries & Shakes","address":"10515 N Mo-Pac Expy, Ste 105","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I finally got the chance to grab my free Mighty Fine Burger after my car services at Arbor Car Wash on Guadalupe.

Before we went up to order our food (you'll get either a touchscreen kiosk or a live person), we were all handed coaster-sized roses which would locate us for our server when the food was ready.  Nice job maintaining the theme!  \\n\\nI might as well get this out of the way here...the food is okay, but not amazing by any stretch.  It's not as elegant as some of the names used on the menu would suggest, just standard theme park food in that spot above burgers, hot dogs and pizza.  I got the ham & cheese sandwich (okay, okay, it's the \\"Croque Monsieur\\") and tried my friends' steak sandwiches.  All were serviceable and tasty enough, but wouldn't rate a \\"recommend\\" out in the real world.  Honestly, don't let that dissuade you since there's not much in the way of competition when you're deep in the Magic Kingdom...which itself is in the middle of a Florida swamp.\\n\\nHow the food is delivered though is quite fun to watch, with servers in stage-appropriate costumes whizzing between tables pushing glass-covered carts, pulling up to your table (thanks to that rose) and presenting your meal with a flourish.  Bravo!  I'm still having fun!  As far as where you eat, there are three themed dining rooms: the Ballroom, Beast's Fortress of Solitude (that's what I called it, anyway), and finally a well-lit gallery space with paintings of characters on the walls dominated by an enormous rotating statue/music box of the lovers.  Each room plays the same music from the film, but with 3 different arrangements matching each room's different mood and decor.  The ballroom is straight from the film with a projected exterior including animated snow falling silently behind you as you dine. The music box room has the giant statue. The Fortress of Solitude is very dark with paintings of the human version of Beast in tatters from his claws.  And of course, there's the rose.  Again, so cool. Nerdgasm.  \\n\\nDespite the awesome (AWESOME) set design, this is basically a dressed up cafeteria so don't be taken aback by children running around and people (myself included) hamming it up for photos.  That's just a fact, and I still loved the place.  I would love to return for the dinner service.\\n\\nYou came to the Magic Kingdom for a show and this place gives it to you in spades.\\n\\n*Edit* The yelp category says \\"French\\", but c'mon...the McRib doesn't make Micky D's a BBQ joint, does it?"},{"name":"Chez Nous","address":"510 Neches St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Chez Nous is an Austin classic, and my favorite restaurant in town.

We each ordered a pork belly bao, then we shared the cup sticky rice, the salt and pepper chicken, the shrimp fried rice, and for dessert, the ice cream bao. Everything we ate was delicious and, according to my friend, extremely authentic. My favorite was the pork belly bao. You can tell that they make their bao fresh to order, and from scratch. The salt and pepper chicken was delicious as well, with the perfect amount of seasoning, and served with toothpicks for easy sharing. The cup sticky rice and shrimp friend rice were both awesome, and great sharing portions. There wasnt any salt, pepper, or condiments on the table, which was perfect because the food was so flavorful that nothing was needed (and I'm the girl who salts everything and LOVES dips/sauces). \\n\\nThe ice cream bao was recommended to us by our server because we could not choose a dessert. She warned us that is takes a few minutes because it is prepared to order and the bao has to cool before adding the ice cream (music to my ears). We ordered it as we finished our rice. The ice cream was salted caramel flavored with a mixture of what tasted like crushed peanuts and brown sugar on top. It was delicious and the perfect cap to our traditional Taiwanese cuisine. \\n\\nI 100% recommend this place to anyone who loves (traditional) Asian cuisine! It was a fun experience trying some new things and of course my friend really loved eating food that reminded her of home. \\n\\nI think this place will do well, and I certainly want the best for them.

Inside, I tried to calm myself down and feel better... but I didn't and I ended up throwing up in their toilet. I felt slightly better, but was still feeling uneasy in the stomach. I came back out and met up with my roommates sitting on the table and they told me that the bean sprouts tasted bad and had most likely turned bad too which caused me to be sick.

Pretty underwhelming selection of beers IMHO. I have seen many more at several other places (hello Flying Saucer in Dallas). I did manage to find one good Belgium beer that I stuck with during our visit. \\n\\nWent on a Thursday for Geeks Who Drink Trivia night. Sat in a booth in the very back of the restaurant. It was super hot because they had all of the patio doors open with the misters outside and the moisture and heat just stifled any flowing air inside. Yuck. \\n\\nHaving gone for trivia, and beer of course, one important thing is being able to hear the MC call out the questions.

What did he say\\" did anyone get that?\\" So trivia was challenging, in more ways than one. ;) Another hindrance (insert tiny violin playing here) was that it seemed like almost every time a question was read, the server seemed to walk over at the exact moment and ask us if we needed anything. Way to stay on top of things, but if you see full beers, please keep walking until the MC quits talking.

Classic: pretzel and beer. Good. \\n\\nMISS: The \\"Artisan\\" sausage board was a little disappointing. For 15 bucks, WOB served up a few different slices of sausages (one jap, one smoked, and one other?) with a couple of small pickled veg. The best thing on the board by far was the \\"house-made stone ground mustard.\\"   \\n\\nYOU SANK MY BATTLESHIP: Admittedly, I am an absolute idiot for even ordering Seared Tuna at a \\"bar,\\" but the waitress promised it was fantastic and boldly stated it was very popular. Okay...OMGag! The WORST fish I have ever put in my mouth! It tasted like it had been floating in a fish bowl for the last two days! It was SO watered down. I assume that it was frozen and then thawed before being seared and sliced. Ick. No, just no. Cannot recommend. [Actually, I believe they took it off the menu since my last visit and now serve tuna Poke style- soy, avocado, and peppers are a great way to hide the disgusting fish. Good luck with that one guys.]   \\n\\n\\nOverall not too bad of a joint. Parking is a breeze; there's a free garage right next to the building.

First of all, there were about 7 customers in the place, but when I looked at the grill, they had about 20 cooked burgers over in the corner waiting to be used. How long had they been there? Who knows? (Well, actually, THEY knew...)\\n\\nThe next thing that should have been a warning flag in my face was the way they were taking the already cooked burgers (while still cooking more new ones right next to them) and putting cheese on them and sticking them into the microwave to melt. Yuck! I mean, do you like NUKED cheese on dry meat?\\n\\nAnyway, I had heard what a great place it was, but it's not, not by a dang sight. The final product was a hamburger with dry, gray meat and no flavor. All the meat taste had dripped down into the greasehole long before I got there. And nuking it made it even drier, and the effect was that the cheese seemed like a very thick paste which adhered to the bun in a most nauseating fashion. The only thing juicy about this burger was the tomato, which had no taste anyway. \\n\\nI always like to watch the preparation of my food, if I can see it, but when I watched these guys, they looked at me with suspicious glares. Hmm, wonder what they're trying to hide? The fact that they sold me a six-dollar burger made from dry, cooked meat sitting around for an hour (or more)?\\n\\nThis place is beyond crap and, with all their simple-minded PR, dedicated to making you think you're getting a great deal! You're not. You're getting ripped off. \\n\\nThen let's top it off with the country music. It wasn't background music, it dominated the whole place. I hate contemporary radio country music, it all sounds the same and it all sounds bad. I have no idea who was singing these songs, but since they all sounded the same, I figured they were all Kenny Chesney, whatever he sounds like, which must be BAD.\\n\\nFive Guys is ten times better than this fake place. This place needs to be exposed for the fake that it is. They had tomato cases stacked in the eating area; I bet a thousand tomatoes all the cases were empty under the top layer.

The bottle of wine created unreasonable high expectations which were soon dashed.  \\n\\nWe ordered four tapas and the seafood and saffron paella.  The grilled octopus should've been called \\"charred beyond recognition\\" because I probably consumed more carcinogens than octopus, although I did enjoy the parsley mojo.  I wasn't able to tell if the seafood was fresh until I tried the paella, the biggest disappointment of the night.  The rice had a glue-like consistency and...wasn't crunchy at the bottom like our waiter said it would be.  The mussels, shrimp, and squid tasted like they had seen better days, such as the day they were caught and shortly after, but not tonight.  The beet and avocado salad was bland, something I could whip up at home.  The fried goat cheese, though, was quite good, according to my dinner companions, although I couldn't enjoy it due to my lactose intolerance.  \\n\\nThere was an uncomfortably long period between the tapas and the paella, where we felt abandoned and alone.

They turned shishito peppers stuffed with I think was paneer (cheese( mixed with spices and then breaded them to turn them into pakoras. I definitely would go back to this place just because of the pepper pakoras. I also liked the vegetable curry and the chicken tikka masala.  The only wish I had for the tikka masala sauce was to make the sauce a bit creamier.  Their sauce is a bit soupy but the flavor is still amazing and the chicken was super tender.  Their garlic naan is ok.  It needs a bit of salt and I wish it was fluffier (I am comparing theirs to the garlic naan at other Indian restaurants that I tried.)

As expected, both of those happened, and as also expected, both the grilled cheese + tomato bisque were delicious!--especially together, and so worth this unnecessary (but so necessary) trip to Crema Cafe, in which probably only a fellow yelpie would understand. The grilled cheese was not your average, toasted on a sort of baguette-like bread with some kind of white cheese (clearly bread and cheese are my forte..), which went well with the creamy but not too creamy and tasty tomato bisque. Their Red Nectar was also great and refreshing--as 'refreshing' as a cup of *iced* tea could be on a cold evening in late November Boston... but considering my recent and newfound love for rooibos tea, plus the extra incentive of cranberry juice added into it, to get it was hardly an option.

Tonight, I met a friend for dinner and we chose the new (El) Vaquero location on West Dublin Granville Road - just east of Sawmill Road. I believe this location replaces the Dublin Village Center location - for obvious reasons - the DVC is a decaying dinosaur of a strip center behind the businesses on the West side of Sawmill Road with no presence along this major thoroughfare. \\n\\nOf course, the El Vaquero website has not been updated, but I'm just assuming they're a bit behind. The menu in the website is the one available on Dublin Granville Rd. \\n\\nAnyways - so much background. Cuco's is closed on Sunday, so my friend and I took a chance. \\n\\nThe space used to house a Houlihan's Restaurant, so it's got a nice chain vibe to it with dark wood and lots of booths. Service was very fast and efficient - the servers seem to help each other out - busing the tables when you've finished, offering drink refills, grabbing carry out boxes. \\n\\nThe menu has really changed since I was last at Vaquero's - lots of different combinations, grilled meats, vegetables, not the usual \\"Speedy Gonzalez\\" plate or taco and enchilada combinations. They also offer a number of seafood combinations, as well as vegetarian options along with grilled chicken and plenty of steak combinations.   Prices are between $8 and $12 for most dinner entrees.  An ala carte menu and lunch specials will run you between $6 and $8.00\\n\\nWe started with a bowl of chips and salsa - the chips were freshly fried tortillas, served warm warm and the salsa was smooth and had nice spice. My friend ordered a grilled chicken dish, ironically called Cuco's Special, with onions mushrooms and onions with mozzarella cheese, beans, rice, salad and flour tortillas. I ordered Enchiladas Especiales with ranchero sauce and served with salad and sour cream. The food came out within 10 minutes on a blistering hot plate. It was an ample portion and very tasty. Following our entrees was an order of sopapillas - light and crunchy with a light honey syrup. \\n\\nI was surprised by the meal - expecting mediocrity (from my past experiences).

Everything is so detailed, beginning at the front gate where you check in and carrying through to all three dining rooms. Yes, three. I've had breakfast and lunch here, and lunch is definitely my favorite. Breakfast is pretty hit or miss, but you're not really paying for the best breakfast of your life when you book a pre-park opening ADR (see: being one of the first in line for Seven Dwarfs Mine Train). The first breakfast meal I ordered here was egg whites and chicken sausage - the chicken sausage was super sweet. I didn't want to finish it but there wasn't much protein on my plate so I choked it down. The egg whites, potatoes, and pastries were all good. The second breakfast we had here, months later, I ordered the vegetable quiche. Here is the description copied directly off of the official Disney menu: \\"Mushroom, Zucchini, Bell Pepper, Onion and Chive Quiche served with Fresh Fruit and a selection of pastries\\". When the food came out, I was surprised to see a crustless quiche sitting on a piece of puff pastry (no big deal, but the photo on the menu showed a regular, crusted quiche), and the quiche contained goat cheese. I am not a huge fan of goat cheese so this was an unpleasant surprise. The flavor permeated the majority of the egg so I ate what I could and let my husband eat the goat cheese flavored bits. The worker who dropped off our food almost forgot our pastries, but that almost would have been ok because they were not good this visit. I don't know what happened, the pastries were so good the first time we had breakfast there. \\n\\nOn to lunch! I had a turkey sandwich that was HUGE. It came with a pile of fries, and I had to order the Master's Cupcake because I wanted to try \\"the grey stuff\\". So good! I left full and happy the day we had lunch here - I actually had to grab a to-go box because my sandwich was so big. I would definitely go back for lunch, and dine in the Rose Gallery - we've eaten in the West Wing twice, and the Ballroom once, but the morning we planned to eat in the Rose Gallery it was blocked off until around the time we left.

Unfortunately, my four pack, which was nearly unidentifiable to begin with, turned into a keg sometime between Halloween and Thanksgiving. This means that I have approximately two months to get into shape lest I be subjected to judgmental stares and alienation from the superficial queens that inhabit Sebastian Beach. Fortunately, I have little problems dropping weight as long as I have ready access to a glass of riesling and some leafy greens - both of which are readily accessible in abundance at Fresh to Order.  \\n\\nFood: Fresh to Order can best be described as the love child between Alon's and Panera - made to order healthy fare with some added flair. Menu options include soups, sandwiches, salads, and light entrees. During my recent visit, I went with the half market salad with grilled chicken and the corn chowder. The salad was exceptional for the price in terms of portion, flavor, and ingredients - it was also accompanied by a complimentary mini croissant, which was delicious. Unfortunately, the chowder didn't fare as well - it tasted as if there was some type of alcoholic component, like cooking sherry, which rendered it nearly unpalatable. I will note, however, that my dining partner subsequently polished it off in its entirety. \\n\\nService: The staff  were exceptionally friendly for the price point of the restaurant. We were immediately greeted upon entry and directed to order at the back counter - the process was seamless and the food arrived at our table approximately 5 to 10 minutes later. Several staff even checked up on us throughout the meal and multiple individuals wished us well on the way out the door. I hope that they pay these people well.\\n\\nAtmosphere: The decor is consistent with what you'd expect from a corporate chain, but it's clean and seating is ample. The staff are also fairly diligent about clearing plates on a regular basis, so there isn't any trash build up on the tables. Both booths and tables are available, the latter of which can accommodate large groups. \\n\\nCost: Inexpensive, particularly considering the location. Salads are $7, sandwiches are $8, entrees are $10-$13, and sides are $4. Half salad and soup combos are also available for $7-$8. Protein toppings for salads are an additional $2-$5. \\n\\nOther: Fresh to Order offers online ordering, takeout, catering, and a separate gluten free menu. Metered parking is available along 7th street or in the pay lot across the street. However, I typically have no trouble finding free street parking on Juniper or Piedmont - it's only a short two block walk up to the restaurant."},{"name":"Thurston Spa","address":"393 Medford St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"They kept it original, affordable & delicious.

We ended up sitting at this tiny lil table by the back entrance (which comes off the parking in the back) which was unfortunate as I had to stop several times between bites to scoot my chair in so as not to continue to get hit by the flinging opening door from incoming customers.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I really wanted to like this place, but aside from the nice lady who seemed to be the owner, there was just nothing to bring me back. I might try the breakfast tacos at some point, but we'll see. It's just hard to return to a place where you spent $20 for two quesadillas, some guac and two non-alcoholic drinks and then had to head over to TacoDeli because you're still hungry."},{"name":"Sugidama Soba & Izakaya","address":"260 Elm St, Ste 106","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Delicious meal!

From the outside, it actually looks like a barn, and I never realized it was there until my husband's cousins who came to visit Boston this past summer checked it out.   My husband and I ate here for the first time last weekend.  To be honest, it was expensive, but definitely worth it.  I repeat...definitely worth it.  We had to wait a bit since we didn't make any reservations, but we waited in the bar where I had a mango mojito.  Let's just say I ended up having a couple more mango mojitos that night. Yummy! We ended up ordering the raw oysters for the appetizer which just melted in your mouth.  I ordered the lobster and my husband ordered the prime rib (chart house cut).  We were just in heaven.  My waiter even deshelled my lobster for me.  I enjoyed that, but my husband was appalled since all the juice and insides were thrown away.  He said next time, he'll just deshell it himself. For dessert, we had ended up having the molten chocolate cake that takes 30 minutes to make.  I couldn't believe we still had room for it, but it was that good! We definitely plan on visiting again!"},{"name":"Chez Nous","address":"510 Neches St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I've only been to Chez Nous twice, but both times were wonderful, so I just have to review it.  This is a great place for a more expensive but not too expensive date, followed by a night on the town.  My favorite thing about Chez Nous is the fixed price menu.  You can get your choice of appetizer, soup or salad, a choice of entree, and a choice of dessert for $25.  And the good thing is that each portion is not huge, so can you can actually consume all this food without making yourself sick.  They also allow you to bring your own bottles of wine for a corking fee of $15 per bottle.  This seems a little high to me, but I haven't been to a restaurant in Austin that charges less than $15 per bottle, so oh well.  At least you can bring your own wine!  For this particular visit, almost all of us had the fixed price menu, including my sister's boyfriend who is from France and thought the place was fantastic.  The service was also very attentive - they were constantly filling us up with water and bread.

And since it was a buffet, we knew we would get our money's worth, as long as we came hungry. Definitely make your dining reservations as far in advance as you can, because it was busy! First of all, you CANNOT beat the décor in Animal Kingdom Lodge. The authenticity of all the décor is carried into Boma and the rest of the resort. Disney truly knows how to create not just a restaurant or a resort, but an experience.\\n\\nThe food was great! My favorite part of the buffet was the stews and soups section. They had quite a few options. I was sad to see there wasn't any butternut squash soup that night, but the carrot ginger soup was amazing. I also really enjoyed the lamb stew and seafood curry. We had a variety of meats to choose from as well. The ribs were good and I also really enjoyed the chicken. There were lots of different salads, vegetables, and sides to try (way too many to recount). But my favorites were the sambosas with the mango sauce and the sweet potatoes. And of course what everyone talks about: THE ZEBRA DOMES. It is so heavenly, it practically melts in your mouth. If I had to describe a zebra dome, it is like a mousse in a delicate dome shape. SO GOOD.\\n\\nOne thing I didn't know going into our meal is that soft drinks are included in the buffet price and it is not an extra fee. Not such a big deal, but we took advantage of this perk since soda can cost so much in the parks. \\n\\nIf you have extremely picky kids, then this might not be a good spot for you. They do have a little bit of American food for them, but I don't think you get your money's worth if that is all they eat. But for couples who are a little more adventurous, then Boma is a must! I like that they also change their menu around, so it could be completely different food every time you go. Just be sure to be extremely hungry every time you come so that you have room to try everything!"},{"name":"Villa Mexico","address":"296 Cambridge St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Ok. here's why you can trust my review.

Lucky for me, Austin has just that restaurant in Chez Nous.\\n\\nChez Nous offers authentic French food presented in a straightforward manner with an accessible wine list.  The staff is helpful, but keeps a distance so that food and your company is the focus of the evening, not them.  Though when asked, they are extremely helpful.  I've been several times and I will say that the lamb is absolutely outstanding - the second best I've ever had (York St. in Dallas hold the number one spot).\\n\\nWhy 4 instead of 5 stars?  One waitress was slightly rude to my father (I sensed it, not sure he did- silly him, he asked a question).

With that caveat:\\n\\nFood: I had the fish sandwich for lunch ($9).  For $9, I found the fish sandwich at Blitz to be much better.  The plate was large, and the fish was chopped up and fried.  I think it was snapper, but I couldn't really taste it.  It came with a 'curry aioli' which was incredibly bland.  It pretty much tasted like mayonnaise, except it was a bit less tangy.  It needed a zip; either more citrus, more salt, or more curry.  The bun was plain, white, grilled.  All in all, meh.\\n\\nI ordered it with a salad.  The salad took up the majority of the plate and the dressing was light, tangy and quite good.  Fortunately, they had a great salad mix of greens.  It was bitter, buttery, and all around good.  No bacon, no tomatoes, no carrots, no unnecessary stuff.  The cornichons (tiny pickles) packed a sour punch.  The pickled onions were also tangy.  After about halfway through my sandwich, I really wanted to stuff the salad and cornichon in the sandwich.  The zing would have made a great addition.\\n\\nI will try the food again.  One more issue, though, is that they're lacking in vegetarian and pescatarian options.  There were burgers and sandwiches filled with meat, but if you don't swing that way, there's not much for you.  The dessert menu looked good, but I couldn't justify 6$ for a dessert during lunch. \\n\\nThe bar looks like the bar specialised in bourbon and whiskey, which piques my interest for happy hour.  \\n\\nAtmosphere:\\nThe place is class act.  The humongous tables are beautiful, and the atmosphere is very nice.  The open kitchen allowed me to see the passion that the chefs exuded while cooking and the attention to detail in every dish that they make. \\n\\nBeing there for lunch (I went solo), there were a lot of business schmucks there.

The Grand Ballroom had 3 chandeliers just like the movie.\\n\\nFood:\\n-Roast beef sandwich (no horseradish)= Pretty tasty, roast beef was fresh & the fries were crunchy [$12.99]\\n-Tuna Nicoise= No complaints here, can't really mess up a salad.

We ordered queso, and the waitress recommended one on special for happy hour, well \\"Great!\\" we thought!  She neglected to mention that this wasn't queso so much as a plate of congealed cheese, with pools of oil, and flavorless sausage.  Apart from being visually unappetizing, it was nearly inedible.

However, there is an element of my experience at Crema that might be a deal breaker for me in the future: I haven't had a good experience with the service yet, and it takes a lot for me to notice quality of customer service in a more laid back, order-at-the-counter type venue. \\n\\nHere was my experience: two of the staff members had open registers, and when it was my turn, I proceeded to the register that was further away from the line. The girl at that register did not acknowledge my presence, and immediately left the counter to help a co-worker. I'm all about helping a co-worker in need, but at the very least I would have appreciated some eye contact and an \\"I'll be right there.\\" The girl at the other register, the register closer to the line, noticed me standing there and asked if she could help me. I figured she had noticed her co-worker needed help and was asking for my order. But as I began ordering, she interrupted me saying that for future reference the line starts back there, pointing toward the line. I was a little shocked she assumed I had completely cut the line, so I found myself having to explain where I was standing and why, which not only was frustrating for me but also held up the line even more. On top of that, the girl who made my tea didn't look at me when I double checked with her to make sure I grabbed my tea and not someone else's. I work in customer service myself and I know how stressful and busy it can get, but the foundation of my customer service education is that the customer is always right and should be treated with decency. \\n\\nA friend of mine had a very similar experience at Crema that involved less than friendly staff members - someone else who has the same name as my friend accidentally took her sandwich, and when my friend voiced the mixup, the staff seemed miffed rather than agreeable and willing to make a new sandwich in light of a confusion that I'm sure happens fairly often with more common names. Although I'm sure that it was frustrating to have another sandwich tacked onto their order during a busy lunch hour, my friend should not have been made to feel like a burden.\\n\\nAll in all I'm seriously questioning if I will go back or not.

I was confused by the huge list of items available.  When I asked if they had a gluten-free menu, I was surprised that they did.  I ordered a half-Reuben (Gluten-free) and a cup of soup (tomato).  When I rec'd my sandwich, I was disappointed that the Reuben was not grilled.  When I asked the manager about it, another staff member popped up with the answer that if they grilled it, it would be cross-contaminated.  Since I told the person from whom I ordered I didn't have an allergy nor was I Celiac, she could have asked if I wanted it grilled but she didn't.  The manager had it redone and grilled it for me.  Then when I started to eat the sandwich, I was disappointed that the meat was chewy.  Not sure where the cheese was I didn't get taste of it or their sauce.  Their sauerkraut's flavor was not compatible with the sandwich -- either Bavarian style or there was just way too much sauerkraut.  The soup was not anything to write home about either.

But they do still come out quite slowly. On at least a couple of occasions, the non-ramen entree came out way earlier and I was almost done with the entire thing before the husband got his ramen.

If you are traveling by shuttle while visiting the parks, give yourself enough time to get here from wherever you're visiting (easiest/shortest from Animal Kingdom of course if you're planning your daily itinerary in advance).\\n\\nMAKE YOUR RESERVATION EARLY.  This goes without saying but is especially true here.  It's become one of the busiest restaurants on property, last time I made the reservation 5 months in advance to be safe.\\n\\nDress code is enforced, however they are surprisingly lenient about it in most cases.  If you look clean and presentable, you should be fine regardless of clothing choice.  If you look like a wild animal (it happens, it's the happiest place on earth!), give yourself that extra time to stop off for a quick change.\\n\\n\\n\\nI could go on and on about this place.  It is personally my favorite restaurant.  Period.  I'll try to keep it short(ish), as there are plenty of quality reviews already, and if you need mine to be convinced, well... then my mission is accomplished.\\n\\nThe ambiance/decor is stunning.  Not where you'll be distracted by it, it's just extremely tasteful, fitting, and well-maintained.  A deep blue sky ceiling, excellently dim lighting by way of simplified birds-in-flight light fixtures, and comfortable seating combine with all of the other great touches to provide a truly relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere.  This is not easy to pull off in an environment that is uncontrollably filled with tired people and loud children.\\n\\nThe prices are... high.  I know, you're thinking 'it's Disney.  Obviously it's expensive'.  However, I don't think that way about this place.  The care, attention, skill, and quality involved here are, if anything, underpriced.  It's truly that good.\\n\\nThe service is a high point among already high points.  Many of the staff are native to Africa (various nations), and are extremely helpful and knowledgable.  And from my experience, your waiter is sure to impress you with their charm, attentiveness, and genuine personality.\\n\\nI have dined here twice.  Both times were the two best dining experiences I have ever had.  I don't frequent establishments that run upwards of $150 per person (all-told with drinks, apps, etc.  It's Disney.  Plan to indulge!) very often, so my basis for comparison is limited I suppose... but still.  STILL.\\n\\nSee other reviews for great pictures of the different choices available on the menu, there are plenty available, obviously I'm not alone in saying how excellent the food truly is.  As others have mentioned - if you like mac & cheese (I know, doesn't seem too classy of an offering... just try it.  It's not what you think), ask for it.  It was no longer on the menu as of 10/20/2011, however they still prepare it the same way they always have.  Amazingly.\\n\\nThe bread is some of the best I've tasted, and the tandoori/butter spread is dangerously addictive.\\n\\nThe wine/beer/beverage list is uniquely focused on African offerings (although there is a wide global variety to choose from as well) which offers you the opportunity to broaden your horizons if you haven't otherwise.  Last time our waiter described the decanting process in detail, and I learned a few new tips about enjoying wine that I've taken home with me.  I was even able to sample a variety of wines to help me determine what I really was looking for, and I didn't even ask.\\n\\nThe filet mignon is indescribably good.  The cut is excellent, the grilling is timed and executed perfectly, and the seasonings are balanced on the razor-edge of exact.\\n\\nThe cheesecake and creme brulee are both upper 1% examples of why people enjoy those desserts.  I have sampled other things on the menu thanks to my girlfriend's plate, but these are what I remember the most.  Needless to say, everything I have tasted has been excellent.\\n\\nOverall: Perfection.  This is the peak dining experience of my life, twice over.  Hopefully something will come along and surpass it, but if it never does, I am content believing that it doesn't get any better than Jiko.

We walked in the door, the restaurant was completely empty, and the hostess told us she couldn't seat us without a reservation.  The aromas inside were so tantalizing and I really wanted to eat there.  I walked out the door, logged into Open Table and it showed available reservations every 15 minutes from 6:30pm through close.  I made a reservation for 6:45 waited until then and went back in and told the hostess I had a 6:45 reservation.  The restaurant was still completely empty yet she insisted they were full and she couldn't seat us.  Two weeks later I tried again.  Made a 7:15 reservation and showed up at 7:03.  I told the hostess (the same one as the previous occasion) I had a 7:15 reservation...she looked at me and said \\"Wow!  You're really early, you can have a seat at the bar or in our lounge until your table is ready\\".  There were only two tables occupied in the entire restaurant.  I went to the bar and ordered a drink.  It took FOREVER to get it.  I had the Ramayana Cocktail.  It was very good, but a bit expensive for the size.  The hostess never bothered to come to the bar to tell me my table was ready and it wasn't until I'd closed my tab and went back to the hostess stand at 7:30 to ask for an update that she sat us.  First we ordered drinks.  Simple order...a glass of wine and a beer.  Ten minutes later the wine comes out but no beer.  A few minutes later the waiter came over and said the beer isn't made anymore so they don't have it and i'd need to select something else.  Why didn't he know that when I ordered and why was the beer still on the menu if it's not available?  Finally get drinks and ordered our food.  We ordered the Brussels Sprouts, the Andhra Yellow Curry Chicken, and the Rogan Josh Skillet.  The Brussels Sprouts were described by the waiter as being roasted, but didn't taste like it.   They were bitter, unseasoned, and undercooked.  I love Brussels Sprouts and these were AWFUL.  I had the yellow curry and my partner had the rogan josh.  The rogan josh was very good, but the yellow curry was awful.  It had the bitter taste of too many curry leaves.  I cook lots of Indian dishes at home which are typically four portions. I usually double the spices in the recipes because I like my food spicy.  In all the recipes I've cooked none of them call for more than 4-6 curry leaves for the whole pot.  I pulled over 10 curry leaves out of a tapas sized portion of the yellow curry.  It left such a bad taste in my mouth that after a few bites I couldn't taste the Rogan Josh.  The theme of the menu is a global food where every 90 days the menu rotates to a different part of the country.  I think it's an epic fail.  Rather than picking one thing and doing it well, the restaurant has managed to be a \\"jack of all trades...master of none\\"."},{"name":"Green House Chinese Restaurants","address":"12915 S Orange Blossom Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I order rice and beef, Bad food rice was over cook or re heat bad tasted,not quality beef  , I throw it in the trash ,also cashier old big woman have very bad attitude and rude never i go to that place ever"},{"name":"Trudy's North Star","address":"8820 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This is probably, my favorite place to go for Tex-Mex..

When compared to the rest of Boston, it would be closer to 3.5 with maybe 3 spots I like better in town for sushi (fish market, ebi and toraya are the only spots I visit when I want fish) When compared with other cities and certainly with anything from Japan, it would be closer to 1-2 stars. I just want your expectations in check when arriving and have you pleasantly surprised instead of massively disappointed. The cold soba is soggy and not al dente like it should be. Sushi is firm, but strangely tasteless. Reminds me of Fuji - so if you like that, this would be similar.  The yakitori is just teriyaki chicken on a stick. No binchotan flavor. Dry and doesn't seem like Negima but rather breast meat. They're super super nice though so I want them to do well. \\n\\nUpdate: returned and happy to note that the unit and hot duck soba were much stronger dishes than the soggy veg soba.

Very few counter service restaurants have this effect on me.\\n\\nThe first thing you'll notice is that these are the friendliest restaurateurs.  They're busy but somehow find the time to smile and show that they APPRECIATE your patronage.\\n\\nThe next thing you'll notice is the incredible pricing on the menu.  $5 dollars for a pita sandwich (please excuse my novice terminology.  I'm Italian, not Greek).  $7.99 for a platter.  Desserts lower than $2.\\n\\nAs you wait for your food, the third thing you'll notice is that thought is put into every detail.  The patio chairs aren't just typical cast iron or plastic-- they're classy and cushioned.  The free water flows from an elegant and clean dispenser.  The huge walls have been painted in beautiful textures.\\n\\nThen the food arrives at your table.\\n\\nThis is Greek food that makes you question EVERY Greek place at which you've eaten.  \\"What kind of charlatans have been duping me my whole life?\\"\\n\\nI may be Italian, but I'd still call myself a Greek foodie veteran.  Even so, each item at Tahini had a robust new approach that I had never tasted.  I knew immediately that THIS is legit Greek food.\\n\\nThe falafel was perfectly moist.  Tabbouleh was the best I've tasted.  The hummus was rich and oily.  The chicken was entirely white meat and so tender it was falling apart.  The rice!  I've never had rice like this in my life.  The Greek salad had an AMAZING dressing and perfect feta.\\n\\nI wish I could tell you HOW all these items were superior, but I really have no idea.  You just need to try it and see what I mean.  (Bonus tip:  Go with a date so you can get TWO platters and try double the items, like I did!)\\n\\nI'm not into lamb, but the rotisserie they had spinning in the back of the kitchen made me almost change my mind.\\n\\nThere are vegetarian options, too.\\n\\nIf you're not planning on eating, stop in just for those cheap pastries and super cheap coffee I mentioned.  They have couches and leather chairs.  Plenty of hangout space.  This place is the size of two or three Starbucks.\\n\\nThe walnut baklava was so skillfully crafted and sweet that I almost cried on that first bite.  I scraped the wax paper when I was done.\\n\\nThere's also a pistachio-filled pastry available.  It's the only pre-packaged item Tahini sells-- but guess what?  The recipe is the owner's own and a bakery in Michigan produces them.  It's very unique and heavy, kind of like a dessert falafel; not what you would expect in a wrapper.\\n\\nThe owner exhibits an obvious passion for all of his food and every aspect of his restaurant.  The payoff is that we, the hunters of high class dining, have a new prized gem just a minute or two north of the UCF campus."},{"name":"Fresh To Order","address":"860 Peachtree St NE, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My favorite salad place.

One may debate their Indonesian authenticity, but please note that they advertise their food as Asian fusion with Thai and Indonesian influence. And lets face it, its never going to be as good as what one prepares and eats at home. I don't go in to Popeye's expecting my Grandma's fried chicken.\\nTo get back on track, we order from here regularly. A pretty typical order for my boyfriend and I is their Pad Thai, vegetable egg rolls, vegetable dumplings. This is split between two people because their servings are large. The Pad Thai (with tofu) is delicious, and definitely a favorite. The egg rolls are pretty typical, but something I enjoy. The only negative thing I will say is the dumplings are a craps shoot. I've ordered them and thought they were so yummy. I tried them another time and they were not uniform in size, dry, and frankly didn't taste good. I am assuming that it depends on the cook that day because I've ordered them again and they were fine, and yet another time and they were not. I enjoy them when their good, so I take my chances.\\nI began trying other things on their menu to see if they were a one trick pony, and that they're not. Their Cay Cap Kuah (it can be ordered with tofu if you don't wish to have the meat) was very tasty and just what I needed when I was craving a hearty vegetable soup. From their seafood menu my boyfriend tried the Sombal Goreng Ufang, a very tasty shrimp dish with green beans cabbage and a coconut curry sauce. Yet another win for Java Noodles! And finally, my most recent crack at a new dish was with their Java Special. Another tofu dish with that awesome coconut curry sauce and mixed FRESH vegetables (I think I forget to mention their use of fresh veggies; very important to a vegetarian). Crisp carrots, broccoli, cabbage and mushrooms, and they don't skimp on the tofu. Again, their portions are large enough for at least a couple of meals. This makes me and my pocketbook very happy!\\nIn all, I enjoy their food, their prices are awesome, their staff is friendly and knowledgeable and their delivery is quick.

Also I wanted to see if the amounts were the same..\\nI ordered 2 dan dan noodles.  One to eat now,...and one to go.  I really like this dish.  I ate  3/4 the dine in order.  Asked to have it packed up.  Looked at the to go order and,............................it was in a 3\\" x 3\\" very small stylophone container so I decided to take a look before I left restaurant. Normally they give this dish in a taller container which you cannot eat out of which is really stupid on their part. LITERALLY,...MY 3/4 eaten same order, same price was the EXACT SAME AMOUNT, as my to go full order. I showed them and they played stupid as usual.   Less than 1/2 what the order should be.  I asked why this was less than half the order and they filled it up w noodles which got tossed out because they did not put any more more juice.  Literally 4 spinich leaves,...about 3 ground up peanuts, and less ground pork.

The space itself is beautiful, with its large open style windows, long communal style tables, clean cut lines and open kitchen. There was no wait during off lunch time and since there were so many tables, I'm curious whether they fill up during peak hours.\\n\\nFood: \\nMiso beef ramen - the portion was just right, where I didn't feel like I deserved to be punched in the stomach for eating so much. However, the broth was so lacking in taste, I was so underwhelmed. The spiciness was definitely there, but spicy+sweet was basically it. It lacked a bit of saltiness that would have complimented the dish...Also, I thought the beef would be sliced, but it was more like chopped beef dunk in soup. It was however pretty tender, but I would have liked more than like 4 pieces...\\nFried chicken dumplings - I'm a fan of deep-fried dumplings, so these pan-fried style dumplings were not my favorite. The filling also seemed to be underseasoned...I don't know if its just me, but everything just felt lacking in a tiny bit of salt...\\n\\nService: So. slow. I'm not saying that the food was slow to come out, the food came out in a reasonable time. However, they sat us in a corner table where it was nearly impossible to grab someone's attention in the first place, and they hardly came around. It took forever for someone to bring the check, then even longer for someone to take it, to the point where we had to flag someone down. ALSO, I'm not sure if this is just me, but I was not a fan of the fact that they wrote on my paper tray liner when I ordered. For example, I got a #26, and immediately the waiter would write a big fat 26 on your paper liner probably so they can bring out the order to the right person?

We came here for the comedy because my bf & I are stand-up obsessives & love watching it in new environments. But urgh, this was all a bit of a disaster tbh. We arrived more than 30 mins early but there were no seats left with a view of the stage. Normally I'd leave at this point but we'd already got a deal via Groupon. So we have a table next to a wall with zero view of the comedians. Next the bf heads to the bar. Now *i know* this is a brewery & there's no obligation on their part, but I was super disappointed to learn that there was *no* other option than beer. My bf is a beer fanatic so I have been to breweries all over the US where I've been placated with a glass of wine or cider whilst he gets stuck in. But not here. So now I have no view, and I'm on the soft drinks.... Anyway, the deal includes a pizza for two. It's actually great value too. The pizza that comes as standard is just a plain margarita, so the bf chooses to pay an extra $3 for a meat pizza. Fine by me. When this thing arrives, it's just an okay 7/11 type pizza. Fine by me. Where I really felt aggrieved was the amount of meat on this thing. I *sh*t you not* it only had meat on FOUR slices and the meat was about half a pepperoni. This is a place that does charcuterie boards so they can't have run out! This is 50c of meat for $3. It's like being given the bird by a pizza...\\nSo we tell a manager, he offers more meat, more pizza etc. He was super nice actually. We opted to have the meat fee waived. That's good, but now we're having a crappy final night in Boston & we want to get out. Urgh. Bf goes to the bar to clear the tab and is charged over $30 for (essentially) one alcoholic beer & a non-alcoholic cider. Eh? We had a pre-paid Groupon but they'd charged us the full price! Oh boy. He complains & the bar lady says \\"we'll get this sorted\\" & then saunters away to serve someone else. At this point we've gone from disappointed to angry. The evening is being wrecked. \\nAnyway, after an unacceptable amount of time he came back. They'd waived the meat, the drinks, the lot. So ultimately, we paid $14 for a 7/11 pizza with no meat, some disembodied comedic voices & to get mad.

We reported to our reservation and waited about 15 minutes to be seated. We were greeted by a nice young lady carrying a Lumiere to our table.  \\n\\nWe were seated in the main ballroom over by the window with a view of the magical evening snow.  This was wonderful for me.  I'm from the snow and the cold of the north and I do miss it.  The one thing that would have made it better, and this is nit-picking, is to have the windows cool to the touch.  To a person like me that would be awesome.   One thing that I really liked about the experience was that I felt cooler.  The atmosphere with the snow falling coupled with my first course made it feel like I was enjoying a winter meal. \\n\\nThat first course I enjoyed was a bowl of French Onion soup which tasted phenomenal.   The Gruyère Cheese was perfectly melted and had a beautiful gooey texture.  Once you broke through the cheese there was the broth, which was piping hot and had a nice French bread crouton sopping it all up.    This was followed up by the main dish of Sautéed Shrimp and Scallops with lobster, mushrooms, seasonal vegetables, and lobster sauce.   This tasted pretty good; everything was cooked perfectly and the taste was on point.  Finally, the only real disappointment of the whole evening was dessert.  I know the famous dish here is the Grey Stuff, but for some reason I was drawn to the éclair a l'orange.   Now I was expecting an éclair filled with orange crème, but in reality it is a regular éclair with a hint of orange taste.  It was good and enjoyable, but not what I was expecting.    I did aspect that the dessert service was shown and brought to you on a cart.  That was truly classy.\\n\\nAll things considered Be Our Guest is a great Disney establishment.   It immerses you in the environment the entire time.  Even in that they allow you to walk around and enjoy the full restaurant, because each room is different.   Make sure you take time to meet the master (the Beast) and take a photo with him.  Also check out the west wing with the rose wilting away.  One final thought to keep in mind is that this is not your usual character dining.  Yes the Beast is there, but he doesn't come to your table like in other character spots.  Instead you go to him, upon completion of your meal, where the photopass folks will take your photo.

The restaurant looks pretty new and clean. It is not all that fancy but not bad as well. There weren't many staffs probably because we went for lunch and it wasn't super busy. \\n\\nI and my husband both love Izakaya. We wanted to check this place out last night but couldn't do it with our newborn daughter. Here are the items we ordered and what we thought of them.\\n\\nDrinks:\\nHakutsuru Awayuki Sparkling Sake($15) - Kind of on a sweet side. Only 5% alcohol which is very low for any sake. It could have been better as a desert sparkling sake. It was too sweet for my taste but not bad.\\nSapporo light ($4.5) - Very dry Japanese lager. Love this beer with Japanese food.\\n\\nFood:\\nScallop Hokkaiyaki ($10) - A bit spicy but very nice. You get shredded crab stick in it which I hated but this was good.\\nSashimi Appetizer ($11) - You get 8 pieces for only $11? I was suspicious. You really do get many pieces. Quality of fish isn't all that great but it's okay. Disappointed with the crab sticks again...why is it everywhere?\\nChawanmushi ($7) - Texture was done perfectly. A bit bland on top and salty on the bottom but I liked it. \\nSpicy Tuna TarTar ($12) - Disappointing. Found a whole chunk of tuna in it which is supposed to be more chopped. Also lack of seasoning except a bit much of sesame oil. Quality of sashimi is just not all that great to me\\nTempura Mori ($15) - Definitely recommend this one. Tempura was done perfect which isn't easy and common! This was my favorite menu of the visit. 5 Shrimps and 7 veggies for only $15? \\nHarami / Beef-enoki / Kalbi Yakitori ($4 each) - I loved the beef-enoki. Very interesting texture and everything was cooked perfectly. Harami was also fine. Stay away from Kalbi since mines were all way too chewy and we couldn't even swallow. We had to spit them out. I would definitely recommend beef-enoki unless you hate enoki's texture.\\nUni Soba ($16) - I was browsing and saw picture of this one and it is why I came. It is Japanese Soba with A LOT of uni on top. I don't know if you can even get half of uni that's on the soba for $16. Quality of uni wasn't all that bad (better than what I got from other Japanese restaurant around this area..). It was really great combination that I never tried before and it worked out great. Too much uni could be a bit difficult on your stomach. Made me feel like I had too much egg yolks but I would definitely recommend this item if you like uni.\\n\\nOverall, their price was really great and I would give 5/5 for their price. Food quality wasn't bad but it isn't better than what you would expect from one of those a little above average Japanese buffet. But I loved their menus and I would return for their non-sashimi entrees. There are better places for sashimi/sushi but this place definitely is worth trying for Japanese style warm food and soba."},{"name":"Red and Green Brazilian Steakhouse","address":"5979 Buford Hwy NE, Ste B1","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"You know how It is girl, i used the Groupon code and like I honestly like this place.

As good as it gets! This is my favorite buffet at Disney! I don't even know where to start! Let's see.... the salmon was fantastic! It was so moist and fresh. During our visit they had two different types come out. The first one was a Pistachio Crusted Salmon and the second one had an Olive Tapenade. Both were equally good. The pistachio one was a little dried out but I think that's because we caught the tail end of it (no pun intended). We got there considerably early because there really wasn't anyone there. I figured we didn't end up needing our reservations but as time went on the restaurant quickly filled up and I can see reservations being a necessity if you don't like an early dinner like I do. So, about all of the stuff on the menu, lets see what I tried.... the Curried Coconut Seafood Stew (very good, lots of mini shrimps, bay scallops, mussels, etc. w/squash & chickpeas) and Mealie Bread (cornbread). For my main plate I tried the Pap (bland corn pudding, like grits) & Chakalaka (spicy tomatoes), Tunisian Couscous Salad (cous cous w/dried fruits & nuts), Curried Pasta Salad, Zulu Cabbage (really good, like curry slaw), Eggplant & Tomato Salad, Corn & Spinach Pudding (like the Pap but sort of sweet), Fufu (sweet potato & white potato mash), Greely (curry) Rice w/ golden raisins, and an assortment of dips (horseradish, Masai Mara and Black Olive Hummus). My mom had the Bobotie and said it was really good. Then I had a hearty salad with Mango Vinaigrette Dressing, which was very good. There was also some sort of buttermilk dressing available as well. I thought it was interesting how they had lentils for a salad topper, it was really good. I also had  Cucumber Salad, Avocado, Grapefruit, & Papaya Salad and Watermelon Rind Salad (which was very sugary; I didn't fancy it). To this plate, I also added a cassava cake thinking they were a dessert because they were near the desserts and had coconut on top but they weren't sweet at all really, just very dense. Then I went back for more of the black olive hummus with Lavosh (crispy pita like chips). Finally, for dessert... woah baby. All I can say is ZEBRA DOMES. I had about 4 of them O.O they are sort of like little tiramisu petit fours; except they are magical. The bottom is like a soaked lady finger then there is the same coffee mousse that's in the Kenyan Coffee Tarts and then there is a layer of creamy white chocolate encasing it. Sooo good. The Pumpkin Cheesecake is really good too but the Strawberry & Mint Panna Cotta isn't anything spectacular. Then, since it was my birthday our waitress surprised me with these cute little Mikey Oreos. Do note that drinks are not included in the buffet. Okay, I think I'll stop now, you get the picture.

It's been doing better since I first went there years ago, with nicer seating and a more seamless approach to the food.\\n\\nThe prices are comparable to DC's prices in Little Ethiopia and surrounding areas.  For two people, the cost is only $23.  But, with no tax in Portland, it's even more delightful.  As a comparison: most places in DC give you 5-7 items on a sampler, all of which are distinct in flavor and/or color.  Here, they loaded on a good 10-12 items!  Much more than expected.  I can only think of one place in DC that does that (Dukem)!  Right there, that's a winner!\\n\\nThe items they include have some classics found on virtually every Ethiopian platter, so you won't be missing anything.  Kik alitcha, mesir wat, Ethiopian salad, ataklit wat, tikil gomen, shiro wat and gomen wat.  The yellow split peas are usually my fav if done right, along with the gomen wat.  Here, they were good, but not outstanding.  The salad was nice and fresh.  The atakilt wat needed a few more veggies, it was mostly potatoes and carrots.  The tikil gomen (cabbage) was nice, but didn't stand out too much except that it didn't rub me the wrong way, which happens often in Ethiopian restaurants.  The shiro wat was a bit runny, looking more like sauce.  The mesir wat had a nice flavor and was quite spicy!  \\n\\nThere were also yengunday tibs, which were mushrooms in a spicy sauce.  This does not exist in most Ethiopian restaurants, but was delightful.  Other differences included a chickpea flour dumpling, which I've never liked here.  It's rather dense and salty, strange texture, but the sauce is nice.  There was also some okra, which always disagrees with me--but if you like okra, your'e in luck.  The other 2-3 dishes were either lentils or split peas and similarly spiced to the berbere-laden mesir wat.  They were good, but I didn't think necessary, since the flavors were duplicative of other items.\\n\\nOverall: the portions are generous.  This differs from some earlier visits here.  So, I am pleased at this change!  The food was heated to be steaming hot: another great sign!  This isn't always the case at metro DC Ethiopian restaurants.  BUT, I have to admit, the stickler for me is always whether the injera is acceptable or great.  Here, it was too thick and not well-developed enough in flavor.  Still enjoyed it, but I prefer thinner, more flavorful injera.\\n\\nWill I go back?  If I'm in Portland and hungry for Ethiopian: yes!"},{"name":"Watch City Brewing Co","address":"256 Moody St","city":"Waltham","stars":"3","text":"Watch City has some pretty brews on tap.

Coworkers and I like to come here for beers and dinner every once in a while and three times in a row we were given the same crabby waiter.

And our dinner there exceeded our (quite picky) standards. We were greeted at the door as valued customers and made to feel as welcome as if we'd been coming there weekly for a year. Once seated, we were brought a complementary glass of white wine from the region that the owner (a master sommelier) specializes in (Friulian), and it was delicious--fresh and crisp with a pronounced fruit-forward palate sensation. A word about the wine service; you can order by the glass or get a bottle between $35 and $700 dollars--the sommelier was extremely helpful, knew the list cold, and in no way tried to upsell us. An amuse bouche was delicious: an adorned Parmesan crisp. Next an amazing salume plate with prosciutto, speck, wine-flavored salami, an olive, pickled onion, and a horse-radish cream (to be eaten on the bread sticks?) was delicious--at the time, I wished for a larger portion, but later was pleased with the portion control. The brick-oven-baked bread had a pleasing sourness that was well balanced by the sweet butter. Although a 7-course truffle-themed menu was available, we opted for the four-course prix fixee meal, which allows four or five options for each course--of course the three of us sampled as widely as possible.  For the antipasti, we tried grilled octopus (my favorite), a composed beet salad, and beef carpaccio (intensely flavored). Our primi (pasta) options included a ravioli filled with Parmesan and a lightly poached egg (ethereal), spaghetti with lemon zest and tender shrimp, and agliottti (?) with squab. Each dish was extremely enjoyable. Main courses included lobster (again, delicately flavored and very tender), duck breast (served medium rare and seasoned perfectly), and braised pork short rib (my favorite). Deserts were beautiful and delicious; panna cotta, and two portions of chocolate mousse with smoked vanilla ice cream. In short, an epic meal: five stars."},{"name":"Sake Izakaya","address":"3272 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Very cozy little sushi joint.

The lunch seating basically just means you wait in a really long line and hope to get in before they cut off lunch service but they quoted me an hour wait and it was MUCH faster than that so I was plesantly surprised.  The lunch menu is an abbreviated version of the dinner menu with some simpler items so make sure to check out both the lunch and dinner menu's before visiting to make sure there is something you want during the meal you are eating.\\n\\nThe restaurant inside is absolutely beautiful.  If you are a Beauty and the Beast fan (who isn't??) then this is your mecca restaurant.  The food was French themed but it was tame enough for people that have a simpler palatte.  When you wait in line and finally get inside you get this disk type thing that has a rose shaped on it (thanks Disney theming :)) and you order and pay before you sit down.  They scan your order on this \\"rose\\" and pick a seat wherever you'd like and they bring your food out to you.  The rose sort of acts like a GPS device so the host/hostesses know where to find you so no need to go searching for anyone.  The process overall seemed very seamless and i was extremely pleased with the experience.  Add this place on your \\"Must do\\" list and if you want to eat there for dinner make reservations as soon as possible!!! Keep in mind this is in the new Fantasyland area that is extremely busy so plan accordingly (I tried making a reservation 2 weeks out and it was booked)."},{"name":"Los Gorditos","address":"922 NW Davis St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great place.

In fact I left a 5 star stellar review the first time I came, but the next times it was just disappointment. I especially had a bad experience today so this is why I am updating my review. I came for lunch at about 1:00pm. When we were seated our waitress drop the menus on the table without even saying Hi. I said we needed a minute to order and she walked out and then didn't come back until I called her all across the restaurant about 10 minutes later. We ordered our food and then we waited, and waited and waited and the order took very long. Me and my partner  decided to create a combo of Caesar Salad, Pasta and 1 slice of Pizza, plus she got some chicken wings. I had to waive again all across the restaurant about 25 minutes later to see if we could maybe get the salad upfront, since we were very hungry. The restaurant wasn't even full or too busy, and the waitress said that the salad was ready and that she was just going to get it. Well she went to the kitchen area and guess what, it was not ready. I could hear how she asked one of the cooks for a salad and he jokingly replied \\"No.\\" She literally had to get into the kitchen and make it herself (not her job). I could see and hear all this because in this restaurant they have an open kitchen that is very close by some of the tables. That staff clearly didn't care the customers are watching them at the kitchen. After that the waitress brought us the salad and she dropped it very hard the table. (How can you drop a plate so hard!?) This was absolutely rude and from this moment on I knew this was going to be a bad experience, but I thought, hey! anybody can have a bad day right? So I didn't complaint and decided to move forward with the meal.The salad was good, but then again it took them very long to bring the next thing which was the chicken wings. My partner was very disappointed because they were uncooked inside. After waiting some more time I got the pasta, which was okay too, and LAST we got the slice of pizza. The pizza wasn't good either, a bit greasy and the dough felt uncooked too. The waitress never came to check on us so I had to waive AGAIN all across the restaurant to ask her for the check. Again she just threw it at the table and left. It was the first time my partner came to this place and she was very upset and said she was never coming back. I felt very embarrassed because I picked this restaurant for our special meal. Also, this is my 4th time at this place and I don't want to come back either. The last time I brought a friend (before this time), they also said they didn't like it, but again, I had hopes in this place because my first experience was good and also  because I believe they have so much potential. Brick & Fire e is well located, has a very nice space and a great menu. The food can be a little better but that is something you can fix easily. But the staff, they really need to be nicer at greeting their customers and help them have a good experience. I felt that our waitress was very rude. I won't say her name because I don't want to get anyone in trouble, but I can tell you that because of her treatment, this restaurant lost my business and my referrals. Oh and by the way, when I was going to pay I was surprised to learn and the ranch sauce that comes with the wings was charged as an extra .75 cents!  Not good Brick & Fire."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"This visit was for dinner; we have also been for lunch in the past. Lunch I would give a 5/5 while as dinner, not so perfect. Note that reservations are a must, for every meal including lunch, and they essentially book up 6 months to the date of visit as that's when Disney Dining Reservations open. We did have a reservation at 8:05pm and were not sat until closer to 8:30.\\nIt's the décor and ambiance that makes the restaurant. We ate in the main dining room, the ballroom, in which the lighting is dim, chandeliers hang from the ceiling which is decorated with the cherubs in the sky painting like in the movie, and next to a window in which snow was falling. The West Wing is another dining room, which has the glass encased rose and it's quite dark in there. The third dining room is the library which Beast gives Belle, with a music-box-like statue in the middle which spins. \\nI had a lovely sparkling wine, Banfi Rosa Regale Brachetto, Piedmont, \\"Refreshing, crisp, and unique, sensuous flavors of raspberries and strawberries with aromatic hints of rose petals\\". It was $13 a glass and when I googled it to see where I could get some at home, I found that I could buy a bottle for $15.99 at Total Wine. So I stuck with one glass and didn't get a second. \\nMarseilles-style Mussels, Steamed in a Smoked Tomato and Saffron Broth served with a Garlic Crostini ($15). This was a generous serving and quite delicious! \\nBe Our Guest literally has THE BEST French Onion Soup, topped with a Crouton and Gruyère Cheese ($9) I have ever had anywhere! Of course, it's also delicious aboard the Disney Cruise Line. \\nMy daughter, who is not a fan of the Disney Kid's meal options and I can't blame her, shared the Braised Beef with me, which is served with Seasonal Vegetables, Baby Potatoes, Balsamic-Caramelized Onions, and crispy Potato Curls ($32). I found this entrée completely overpriced for the serving size. My \\"seasonal vegetables\\" were 3 over sized asparagus stalks and the baby-teeny-tiny sized potatoes, were indeed baby and I had maybe 3 to 3.5 of them. The beef was tender enough, similar to a pot roast, but I feel the Braised Be Beef at Raglan Road (located in Disney Springs) is a much more delicious option. \\nMy husband got the Sautéed Shrimp and Scallops, a pasta with Lobster, Mushrooms, and Seasonal Vegetables in a creamy Lobster Sauce ($29). This too, overpriced but not as glaring as the beef. Noting a creamy lobster sauce, I would expect something similar to an Alfredo. However, I don't recall the sauce being too creamy. I had a bite and it didn't strike me as an out-of-this-world dish. Desserts are served in wood and glass rolling serving...coffins? It reminds me of Snow White's glass coffin. How morbid. \\nI cannot speak to the desserts, but my daughter assured me the Lemon Meringue Cupcake\\n(Vanilla Sponge Cake, Lemon Custard Filling, and Flamed Meringue Icing, $5) was \\"so yummy!\\" I DID try the \\"Grey Stuff\\" per Lumiere's suggestion (don't believe him? Ask the dishes!) and that was yummy as well - I probably could have eaten a plate of just that. This is also coming from the girl who eats Cool Whip out of it's container.  The \\"Grey Stuff\\"( Chocolate Shell, Cookie Crème topped with Lumiere's special \\"Grey Stuff\\", $5)\\n\\nNow for lunch! It's like Quick Service. You go up to a kiosk, you choose your items, and you sit down and your food is brought to you; kind of like Panera. But the prices, while still expensive, match the serving size. I truly believe the Lunch portion of  the Braised Pork (Coq Au Vin Style), Eight Hour Slow-cooked Pork with Mushrooms, Onions, Carrots and Bacon served with Mashed Potatoes and Green Beans Jardiniere ($16.99), was larger than my dinner entrée of the braised beef. And the French Onion Soup is available for $6.49. I have also had the Carved Roast Beef Sandwich, Served on a Baguette with Horseradish Bleu Cheese Cream Sauce and Pommes Frites, ($16.99), and this too was delicious!\\nFinal Verdict: Go for Lunch."},{"name":"Clyde Common","address":"1014 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Loved this place.

The pumpkin ice cream had been over-churned so was icy but nicely flavored, the pecans were very good but the crepe was rubbery and the coffee pudding unremarkable. \\n\\nWe will absolutely be back.

I'm glad we did because as a Boulder resident, one really should ... but we probably won't be back.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong: this is not a bad restaurant at all (but you already know that from the above-average amount of stars here on Yelp). In fact, the service was *exceptional*. Everyone was extremely polite, personable, and knowledgeable. Where this restaurant fell short, unfortunately, was the food. \\n\\nMy spouse and I opted to get the Friulano Tradizionale (the chef's tasting menu), which is six courses plus a dessert. We love tasting menus, and were curious about this one. The first course featured a polenta cracker with fresh red snapper, and a small shot glass of whipped potato. The polenta cracker/fish combination was good, but the whipped potato was ... off. I mean, I think it could be made at home by putting a stick of melted butter and one potato in your food processor. The texture was just odd; a little too starchy and slimy. \\n\\nIt's been a couple of weeks since we were there, so I can't remember all of the courses we had, but a few are still sticking out in my mind:\\n\\n- Risotto: This was excellent. The waiter brought it to the table fresh in a sauce pan and served us right there. The risotto was lemony and creamy, and featured fresh seafood. This was by far the best course they served.\\n\\n- Chicken Ravioli in Prosciutto Broth: This dish was ... hmm, I don't want to use the adjective \\"revolting\\", but that's the word my mind keeps going to. It wasn't the pasta or the broth that was awful, it was the filling. It was like someone had purchased a rotisserie chicken, masticated the breast, and the spit-out result became filling for the ravioli. Again, the texture was just not \\"there\\" for me; I only ate half of a ravioli before it was game over. Even my spouse considered this dish barely passable, and he'll eat anything.\\n\\n- Venison Tartare: This was just okay; it didn't have any flair to it (no seasoning). I think the tartare at Black Cat (though it's beef, not venison, so perhaps unfair to compare) blows Frasca's version out of the water. I usually can stomach raw meat, but this was another dish I only ate two bites of because it was just ... \\"ick\\". \\n\\n- Pork Loin and Kale: I was excited when the waiter brought this out because it was described as a \\"house-made sausage\\". After tasting the sausage, I didn't doubt it was house-made, but ... it was raw. Intentionally raw, not a cooking mistake. Oh, man, was it awful! I gave it a nibble to give it a fair go, but I'm shuddering right now as I recall how much it tasted like I imagine the raw $2/lb. ground pork from King Sooper's tastes. \\"Well ... the kale is good; try that!\\" my spouse cheerfully said as he ate the remaining 97% of my sausage. \\n\\nAfter the so-so-actually-maybe-not-so-good six courses (minus the risotto, which was, as I said, excellent), I thought, \\"Well, at least we're getting dessert!\\" Then, dessert ended up being pretty crummy, too! It was a coffee granita with marscapone that was so non-memorable that I actually can't even remember what it tasted like. I do recall that as I was chewing, the adjective \\"bland\\" kept coming to mind. \\n\\nTo be fair, I am not a pro foodie like Frasca's restaurateurs. I'm actually a little ashamed to be posting this review because maybe I am too bourgeois to appreciate chewed-up chicken and sticky, blended potatoes. Who knows, maybe if I were a wine person I would love this place, but my spouse and I don't drink. All in all, I didn't really like this restaurant, which surprised me since I enjoy Pizzeria Locale and I happily patronized Frasca's Caffé when it was open! I think we ended up paying $300 (food + tip); which was kind of a bummer because the food just didn't have the yum factor you'd expect at that price point. (Or any price point, really ... I just didn't really like it; and you can check my other Yelp reviews -- I'm not a very picky eater!) \\n\\nIf you're a Boulderite, you should probably go here at least once to decide for yourself whether you like it or not; but my humble opinion is the chef's tasting menu at Black Cat Bistro is a lot better. Frasca owners, you are clearly doing something right since everyone loves your restaurant -- and I genuinely do wish that I loved it, too!

Great idea. I saw the size of the full plates, so I ordered prudently. A half bowl of wild mushroom soup and a grit cake side were more than plenty for me, and my friend had an Asian salad that was huge. The chicken was so tender she thought it wasn't cooked enough (how rare is that, no pun intended?) and my grit cake was twice the thickness of a hockey puck, browned on the outside and ooey-gooey on the inside.

My coworker got a Fried Chicken Sub, which seemed better.  It was enormous for one.  Her sandwich and fries had to come in separate boxes since there wasn't enough room in one.  The chicken had been marinated in a bright yellow curry mix and imparted an interesting flavor to the meat underneath the peppery breading.  That was all in all, not bad.

Namely, this was the restaurant where my brother Neal proposed to his now-wife Lisa after a meal of paella for two. That evening, I got both a new sister-in-law AND a resolve to one day try this much-heralded Spanish restaurant. When it came time for my brother's birthday, he wisely chose FINO as a place for the family to dine, so to continue the tradition of happy occasions at this particular spot. I offered no objections (even though it was his birthday, I still insisted it be somewhere fabulous). \\n\\nThe location is a little disarming. My mother had told me as we arrived her stylist had told her not to be alarmed when we pulled up, and that even though it was located in a shopping center, it was indeed an amazing restaurant. The stylist was right. The exterior suggests a shopping center boasting discount dentists and defunct TCBY's. Yet actually, it appeared to be just FINO, and a ritzy Texas Clothier. So...it's a fancy shopping center, you see. \\n\\nI took note of the ample patio area directly outside the front door, and figured it would be perfect for when the weather is nice and you won't be fumbling with more than an appetizer and a cocktail glass. For the dinner we sat indoors at a corner table, but I can definitely see the appeal of the outdoors in the evening. \\n\\nFINO continued to surprise me even as we nibbled on a trio of olives & pickles, manchego cheese, and marcona almonds. The interior had several modern touches (the latticed light fixture above our table made me slightly dizzy when it spun and made the shadows dance across the wall), but something about the drapes reminded me of the banquet rooms at my college that still hearkened back to the late 70's. Maybe my interior design friends could explain the style better; all I know is that it's different from any other restaurant in Austin. In a good way. \\n\\nI noticed a chef's table in the other room, with about 15 people sitting around and sharing a large, multi-course meal. Neal said they offer a special menu for events like that, and I'm now wanting 14 of my closest friends to join me for that very soon.\\n\\nFor us, the chef sent out a platter of Mahón cheese mixed with roasted piquillo peppers on crackers. It was basically an amped up, delicious version of pimento cheese (I actually copied this recipe for my at-home version). It went well with our order of fried anchovy stuffed olives. \\n\\nAppetizers continued with octopus a la plancha (my favorite, and a much more interesting flavor than, say, fried calamari); tortilla española (a basic tapa, I'd skip this one in the future); the carrot agnolotti (an earthy vegetable ravioli); pork belly (pork belly is always a hit; the garnish was a beautiful watermelon radish); and the fried Texas quail (Neal's favorite, and hands down the \\"breakout star\\" of the bunch. It was crispy, juicy, and meatier than you'd expect from quail. We ordered a second plate since it was so good; do NOT skip this one.) \\n\\nOrders of paella are meant to be shared between two, so my father and I split the rabbit, pork, and foie gras sausage paella (with asparagus and a farm fresh fried egg added on top). Rich and savory, each bite was amazing. The rabbit confit was exceptional, and foie gras sausage especially was melt-in-your-mouth good. The best part is the rice that's been scorched at the bottom of the skillet, since all the flavor has traveled down there. My only criticism is that they could have had just a *bit* more in there, as my dad and I could probably have both eaten that paella by ourselves. But then again, we weren't finished. \\n\\nDessert consisted of fried goat cheese with a red onion jam and Texas honey, and the birthday boy ordered the lemon sugar doughnuts (compete with bday candle and all). I couldn't in all good conscience pass up the boca negra: essentially a large block of chocolate truffle w/ ras el hanout chocolate sauce, a light toasted almond sorbet, and candied cacoa nibs. Decadent is the only term to describe it.\\n\\nI'm not really sure how to summarize this experience, except after writing this, I desperately want to return. So...someone, quick: have a birthday or get engaged. I really, really want to go back.\\n\\nDo I really need to say it?

Let me explain. A friend and I came to this restaurant to try our first so-call Brazilian barbecue because we got a certificate from Restaurant.com. When we sat and already placed our order, we realized that we should double check and make sure that what we ordered matches what is required in the certificate. \\n\\nThen we were informed by the waitress that the certificate was not valid at the establishment anymore due to new management. We asked to speak to the manager. He came over and gave us the whole spill about even though the name is the same, it's under new owner. Therefore they will not honor it because the food is cheaper now (I would not know) and that we should complain with Restaurant.com as they did themselves. \\n\\nOverall, the initial experience was bad and we have not even tasted the food to give it a fair review. I would suggest that customers be aware of the restaurant's management style and DO NOT buy ANY gift certificate for this business as you just won't know whether they will honor it or not. \\n\\nI would give this a zero star if I could, but the one star is for the nice waitress that took our order and help explain services.

Specifically, to maximize results it's critical to dedicate chunks of time throughout the week to cruising job boards, probing your network on LinkedIn to set up coffee chats, tapping into your university alumni career center and scanning the social media channels of companies you are interested in.  Basically, don't put all your eggs in one basket!  JoLa Cafe has taken this lesson to heart and the diversity of deliciousness available to patrons here is as good as it gets.  In addition to serving choice cups of coffee, JoLa has a plethora of pastries, a tasty selection of toasts and a bevy of micro-brews to tap into.  The ambiance is cozy, the baristas frequently flash smiles and the customer conversations I overheard were friendly.  All in all, JoLa Cafe is a comfortable cafe with a warm vibe that will definitely keep your spirits high as you log in another day pounding the pavement and putting yourself one step closer to your next gig."},{"name":"Sabatino's Italian Kitchen","address":"242 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"3.5","text":"I am so disappointed with this place.

Maybe give the parking lot a facelift, too. Perhaps add something a little fun/quirky outside in order to draw people's eye. Consider a small Bier-Garten-like area with heat lamps. Get a citrus squeezer and offer fresh lemonade at a fair price. Offer to mix it with good iced tea or beer (like a fresh Shandy). Summer patrons will thank you and come back for more. Try to give the place a little more character, and pay attention to serving high quality food at a reasonable price, along with great service and the sports experience.

Over the years I've had various styles, from extra hot to very bland broths, from northern to southern and to Japanese styles. I've visited numerous places all over Canada and US where there are decent hotpot places, including restaurants which are part of the same franchise. This place in Central Square is THE BEST. My record so far is 7 visits in 2 weeks so beat me if you can. While actually I know some people go 4 days a week.\\n\\nThe broth gets its distinct flavor from oriental herbs which were used to improve your immune system and blood circulation. That's why in winter it's especially comforting to sit down and sip the broth. Yes, their broth is basically soup.\\n\\nThe quality of the meat is also top notch. I usually put lots of condiments when I have hotpot, but it'll be a shame to do so at Happy Lamb. Just like I wouldn't want to order well-done filet mignon steaks because it defies the purpose. Dip the shredded lamb/beef/port in the broth for about 15 seconds and try to appreciate the flavor of the meat in your mouth, by itself. It's amazing.\\n\\nThere are also many vegetable, tofu, and seafood to choose from.\\n\\nI have a very high bar when I say something is the BEST. I mean it literally. So it's not very common that I recommend a place so much. I hope that more people visit them so they can open more locations and provide the quality food for many years to come.\\n\\nHere is a pro tip: ask for extra hot for lamb skewer and broth if you think they can't make it spicy."},{"name":"Wayfinder Beer","address":"304 SE 2nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Terrific food, great service.

I've gone twice now and each time ordered from someone friendly. True, they yell out names when orders are ready. True, all food is served in bags which you can grab and go, or sit down at communal tables (are we all THAT afraid to sit near strangers?). The thing Mighty Fine has going for it is that the food tastes fresher than that of other places I have been in Austin. I was happy to see a burger that was not just a flimsy piece of flattened meat that I could barely taste when paired with the usual, but something that could stand up to any additions (I just wish I had paid attention that a regular cheeseburger is 1/2 lb of meat the first time I went!). The fries are a welcome change and also taste fresh - absolutely without any of the blandness that comes with the usual frozen variety.\\n\\nMy only real complaint, is that yes... you do pay more than you would elsewhere.

It was every little and grown girl's dream to dine in the ballroom where Belle and Beast took their iconic dance. I was so excited and overwhelmed with excitement that I couldn't even fully listen to the host and waiter when they tried explaining everything to me.\\n\\nI will attempt to bullet my thoughts, otherwise this review will go on too long.\\n+ We seriously lucked out on our reservations. Our first try was only 2 weeks ago (2 weeks! some people wait for months it seems!!) and we could only get a 9:30pm reservation. By some stroke of luck, we checked again closer to our trip and found a 7:45pm! But seriously, once you buy your Disney tickets, get a reservation here!!\\n+ You have to check in at the little stall before the bridge. Many people got up to the gate, only to be sent off if they didn't have a reservation.\\n+ You have to have a reservation to even go inside the gates, let alone the restaurant! (So what are you doing, MAKE YOUR RESERVATION!!)\\n+ The waiting area inside the gate had some fake stone/boulders for sitting. A staff member brought out some water for everyone waiting\\n+ The hosts announce when your table is ready by saying \\"The Master requests the presence of the ____ family!\\" AND they bring Lumiere along with them so you can hold him to guide you into the castle!!!! (cue little girl squeal)\\n+ Stepping into the ballroom is breathtaking. (still squealing)\\n+ The cute little rose napkin! The menu! (hyperventilating now)\\n+ The waitress tells us that they pulled the original animator out of retirement for him to recreate the snow falling in the background of Belle & Beast's dance for the large windows in the back of the ballroom. She says that the snow falling \\"outside\\" is the exact snowfall as when Belle and Beast were dancing (cue my disbelief, \\"NO WAY!!!\\")\\n+ After I catch my breath, we order the wine flights because these wines are made at a French vineyard SPECIFICALLY and ONLY for BOG. WHAATTTT. (I enjoyed the rose the most out of the trio)\\n+ Boyfriend and I opted for no appetizer because I needed to save stomach room for the Grey Stuff.\\n+ Boyfriend orders the Roasted Lamb Chop (delicious, but tough to cut and chew on)\\n+ I order the Braised Pork and it was glorious. Like the waitress said, you don't even need a knife! A bit on the saltier side, but still slow-cooked to perfection.\\n+ Dessert is served table side so you get to marvel at all the cute little desserts. Definitely get the Grey Stuff because Lumiere told you to. We also picked the Lemon Meringue Cupcake. The desserts were a bit of a let down because we expected more, but it was still delicious.\\n+ After dinner, we are encouraged to explore the \\"castle.\\" There's the Rose Room (or is it called Belle's room??) with a giant music box of Belle and Beast dancing. All around the room are paintings of their lives together (before Beast turned back into a human though). There's also the forbidden west wing, where it was dark and decorated with slashed tapestries and paintings. The rose is in here, just don't touch it, otherwise the Beast will get super mad.\\n+ When you're really, really finished, go to the study to greet Beast! Unfortunately we opted not to because I wanted to get decent spots for the light show and fireworks.\\n\\nIf I had to change anything about BOG, it would be that I serve everything on the dishes in the movie (I'd also sell these dishes in all the Disney stores because I can't be the only grown-ass adult who would buy these and serve all my future meals, right?). I'd also make sure that every dish Lumiere sings about in the song is available to order. Beef ragout! Cheese souffle! Pie and pudding en flambe!! Where are you? Not too much to ask for, am I right?

Total experience (from check-in to leaving) took us about an hour and 40 minutes.\\n\\nMade a reservation (which I HIGHLY recommend) at 6:00 AM 180 days before our trip for dinner at 9:25 PM for my sister and I. While that's a little late for families with children, it was perfect for us and allowed us to have a late lunch/better ride access during the traditional dinner hour. The children that were at dinner at that hour were well behaved and it was overall less noisy than I thought it would be.\\n\\nChecked-In at 9:15 PM and were told to wait on the bridge to receive a text when our table was ready. I wasn't certain the host had typed in my number correctly but when I went to check, I was told that they were unable to check or change a number once entered into their system which seems strange and was an un-necessary source of anxiety. My only complaint for the evening was that we then had to wait a little under 30 and after a full day at the theme park, we were definitely famished. I wish there was more seating or benches on the bridge itself or that we were given a wait time estimate.\\n\\nOnce you get your text, you enter to a small courtyard and a hostess personally announces your party by name and gives fun facts about the castle and the rooms.\\n\\nWe were seated in the back of the Ballroom, which is gorgeous, especially at the holiday time, and itself worth the wait. Our waitress, Julia I believe, was incredibly friendly and welcoming with an amazing attitude.\\n\\nWe both got the wine flight, which includes three tastings of Signature wines only available at Disney (a Chardonnay, a Rose, and a Red blend). The Red and Rose were to die for! The flight sizing equals out to one glass total, so I would recommend trying it then ordering your favorite however it's also a great way to taste the wines on a budget as some are fairly expensive (the fed was $17 per glass).\\n\\nFor appetizers, I had the potato leek soup which was perfectly creamy and just the right portion size. My sister had the seasonal salad trip (green bean salad, beet salad, and a watermelon/apple salad). The pairing of all three was ingenious and each one was delectable and refreshing. After a long day of theme park food, it was nice open dinner with vegetables.\\n\\nFor dinner, I had the braised beef served with a Demi-glacé, asparagus, roasted potatoes, and fried onion shavings. It was honestly one of the best beef dishes I've ever had out. It was cooked perfectly, with the meat sliding right off with my fork like butter (no-knife needed). It was a bit heavy on the onion topping but they added a lovely crunch component so I honestly didn't care. The sauce was also a star on the plate, adding great flavors. The red wine from the flight paired extremely well with this dish and I would highly recommend it with the beef.\\n\\nMy sister had the scallops and shrimp with pasta in a light cream sauce. Again, each component was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was out of this world. The pasta, which I had low hopes for, blew us both away and I would never have guessed it was from a theme park restaurant. I'm so glad they changed it out from the puff pastry!\\n\\nFor dessert, which they present and serve from a cart, we got the grey stuff and the triple chocolate cupcake. The cupcake was extremely rich, but as a chocoholic I found it intoxicating. The icing was fantastic and they have crunchy pearls mixed either in the batter or in the bottom to provide a wonderful texture change. The grey stuff, my main reason for wanting to eat there, was mind-blowing. It was light and whipped beautifully, with the cookies and cream flavoring unexpected but truly delicious. The chocolate torte on the bottom was a bit hard to cut into but once on your fork it was a nice compliment to the grey stuff without overwhelming the flavor.\\n\\nAfter dinner we explored the other rooms (very glad we didn't eat in the West Wing, as it's extremely dark) and, as a bonus, the beast is available to take pictures. While I do wish Belle was there, it was nice to have guaranteed access to a character without any of the hassle. There was no wait and the attendants were more than happy to use my phone for the picture. \\n\\nWill definitely try to eat here again on a future visit and I recommend it to everyone that has the patience to plan ahead!"},{"name":"wagamama","address":"1200 Market St","city":"Lynnfield","stars":"3.5","text":"Wagamama was my favorite when I had it in London.

I also had the watermelon juice, which is so refreshing. You can have all the green tea you'd like for free and it was good.

Just in case it was busy, we made reservations.  We came in at 6 and the place was half empty but it filled out and the place was full when we left. \\n\\nThe space and decor was nice.   It's a bright, clean and modern industrial space.   Trendy vibes.  Casual.  \\n\\nOur waitress was nice but she was too timid.  When asked if they had certain items, we didn't know if they did or didn't bc she wasn't assertive.  Also, she forgot a few things. \\n\\nFood.  We wished they had told us what wasn't available before we started to get settle.  They didn't have their signature dish, the uni soba.  Boo. They also ran out of other items.  No hotate/scallops.  No mango cream soda.  We started with the yakitori: ika yaki/grilled squid, enoki mushrooms and the kalbi.  They were all quite tasty.  We also ordered the tuna salmon lobster cold starter.  It was good, pretty standard.  For entrees, we ordered a sashimi deluxe, kamo nanban (hot soba duck soup) and the sukiyaki soba (hot soba pork soup).  The sashimi deluxe was good but nothing to write home about; we can get good sushi anywhere in the city.  The two soba noodles were delicious.  Broth was simple and clean unlike ramen with its complex bone broth.  The duck soba came with 6 slices of duck and a bit of scallion with a side of a spicy condiment.  I thought it needed a little more of something else.  Maybe some more scallions?  Maybe even more meat?  The sukiyaki was better with its tofu and pork ratio.  \\n\\nShould you go?  Sure.

I doubt there are many repeat local customers. \\n\\nThe menu is cluttered with wasabi crusted asian fusion nonsense, and as a nice touch several items don't have prices listed. This usually means one of two things: (1) you are eating at a private club as a guest, someone else is paying, and you can order whatever you want, with no concern about cost OR you are eating a restaurant that intends to strongly overcharge you, but likes to be subtle about it. \\n\\nThe food was drastically over salted, chowder, baked scrod (ordered off the unlisted menu), and baked potato(!) were all strongly salted. You don't get in on the first taste, but after a few bites it quickly becomes unpleasant. \\n\\nNow you have a choice, one can ostentatiously send the food back and disrupt what is probably a special occasion meal or you can keep eating the food while considering the properly seasoned meal you should be eating. \\n\\nWhich brings us to price. The implications of not showing prices on the menu, is revealed when the check arrives. $167.20 for 3 people. (Main course + salad/soups and one shared appetizer). \\n\\nWhile going down to the restrooms, I bumped into a crowd of tourists gushing about the food to one of the line chefs. After they left, I mentioned to the chef that the food was over salted, and especially the chowder. He revealed that they have been having *ongoing* problems with the chowder getting too salty. He further explained that its due to the chowder getting reduced as the night goes on. They were planning to switch to making the chowder with unsalted butter, to reduce the risk of this.\\n\\nWhat this reveals to an old timer in food quality, is that someone is forgetting to keep a lid on the chowder pot, probably because the chowder is being kept hot on an open steam table. Salted vs Unsalted butter, can be solved by one call to SYSCO, and bad chowder can usually be improved with more heavy cream, and yet it also reveals a more serious problem, in that this \\"problem\\" has occurred more than once. \\n\\nAt $60/plate the food should be much better, and the whole experience more professional. Overall, you are getting cheesecake factory-esqe food (with extra bonus salt), at 2x the price.

I had been craving a good chicken tender and after I stumbled across Tenders - a business that specializes in exactly which that I was craving - I thought it had to be nothing shy of divine timing and to accept my second meal fate. If only the anticipated experience I was imagining held even a shred of truth in reality, this review would rank right up there with the others who raved about it...but alas, no. While I rarely give a damn about whether or not a restaurant lacks character or pizazz, it was just something I felt when I first stepped foot inside. There wasn't even a lingering aroma of delicious fried lofty goodness that one would maybe expect to confirm that the decision made was spot on. The booths were also in horrible shape; each one repaired in some way or another by duct tape. They were also noticeably dirty. Even writing and reliving this experience, my inner me is getting angry at the real me for having still followed through with walking up to the counter and proceeding with an order:\\n\\n10pc tender (5pcs fried / 5pcs grilled) - I wanted to try both\\n2 sides - coleslaw, tater tots\\n1 soda - I typically get Diet Coke, but all but two were only available, so I got Sprite and it was disgusting\\n\\nI sipped on my disgusting drink while pondering my now horrible lunch decision, but instead of responding to the countless signs that were before me, I still waited for my order, but I did ask to change it from a dine-in to a carry-out. If I was going to contract an illness, I'd much rather be in the comforts of my own home before the inevitable took place.\\n\\nVerdict on the eats...\\nThe tenders weren't horrible. I preferred the grilled ones over the fried. For as long as I waited, I assumed I was getting fresh food, but the fried tenders were chewy and only warm. The breading was soft, as well. The grilled/broiled tenders had a good flavor and were somewhat juicy. The coleslaw is a difficult one to judge because there are so many different variations on how to prepare and serve it. But unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of how they make theirs. The cabbage is in too big of a shred and not dressed/seasoned enough. The only thing I actually really enjoyed were the tater tots.

Let's just say that going to Royal Indian Cuisine made for one of our most enjoyable nights out in recent memory. When we arrived, there was no one else in the restaurant, which we didn't mind, and was to be expected because it was a Wednesday night in October. Not exactly prime dining time. Our server, Ashish, was incredible - jovial but professional - and really made the night. We told him we were Indian cuisine novices and asked if he had any suggestions. On his recommendation we ordered the chicken tikka masala and the lamb rogan josh with buttered naan bread for our main course, and the samosas for an appetizer. The whole experience was delicious, almost too flavorful. The sauces were rich and bursting with spice, and the meat was so tender that each bite was as good as the first. Ashish kept our water glasses full, and was available to answer any questions we had. You could really tell he was glad we were there and practically beaming when we gushed over the food. For dessert, we had a rice pudding, which perfectly complimented the entrees' savory spice with its sweet coolness. The atmosphere of Royal Indian is very inviting: clean and proper without being stuffy or gaudy. I could see myself coming for a quick bite, or a nice evening out. While I haven't tried many of the other Indian restaurants in the area, I'm not even sure I want to; the food was so exquisite, and the service so professional that I really don't know why I would want to go anywhere else.

The tables are a bit close together and we had an annoying couple right next to us.  She was talking incessantly and loudly...he looked like he wanted the floor to open up and swallow him.  The BF even said if he ever felt as miserable as that man looked, he would just ask someone to put him out of his misery.\\n\\nAnyway...the food was pretty darn fabulous.  Knowing that this was a tapas style menu, our  expectations in terms of portion size was realistic.  We started with the mussels.  They are steamed in a broth with a hint of orange juice, fennel and coriander...an imaginative and wonderful tasting dish.  Then we had the gambas...shrimp in a not spicy enough olive oil based sauce.  The shrimp were a good, healthy size and cooked perfectly.  Then we had the Greek salad...a tad too many onions, but good.  Where were the olives, though???\\n\\nThe piece de resistance were the scallops.  They were perfect.  BF said that they were the best scallops he had ever tasted!  Coming from a man who has lived all over the world, including the coastal regions of Spain and Greece...this is certainly high praise.  Scallops are often overcooked and tough.  These melted in your mouth with each bite.  Astounding!!!  \\n\\nFor dessert we had the apple upside down cake.  It was nice in that it wasn't too sweet.  IMO, a teensy bit dry, but the vanilla ice cream helped out a bit.  \\n\\nOur meal was about $100 including tip.  We also had a half bottle of wine.  It was great that this is an option...a definite plus!  Sometimes you don't want a whole bottle, but maybe more than just a glass.

I have spent many a night chatting with Terry the bartender at Whistler while imbibing on a lovely pinot noir.\\n\\nThey do have their discrepancies and inconsistencies. Whistler is the best, followed by North Van then Kitts. The Spaghetti Quattro is best at North Van, the Cornish hen at Whistler. Everyone has a different idea of what \\"good\\" pasta is.

Yes, a discerning palate. He was ordering his steak medium rare at that point too. I see a food critic in his future.

Service is always good.\\n\\nLong and the short. I recommend Quattro. It's not the be all and end all for pasta but it's very good. Go in with good expectations not overly inflated.

I'm certainly a fan and found the eating experience different from any other Indian restaurant that I have tried.\\n\\nYou order at the counter, where there are menus and a list of daily specials. If you're ordering an entree, know that you have to order the rice or naan as well. You'll see that main dishes are just served in styrofoam bowls on their own, without any accompaniment. The good thing is that the prices are reasonable so adding your sides à la carte won't set you back much financially. You give your name and pay once you've placed your order and find a table to sit at. Many times, it is very busy but the turnover is frequent. You'll see many Desi families and groups here having a meal and just heading out. They don't draw out their conversations like us Americans. It's all about meal efficiency oftentimes, it seems.\\n\\nI've tried wonderfully fragrant basmati rice, freshly baked naan (I only see the plain variety offered, not garlic, but that's fine with me), butter chicken (an absolute must-try), chicken tikka masala, chicken tandoori, chicken kalimirch, and mango lassi. The mango lassi is one of the best that I've tried, as it is more mango-ey than it is sour from the yogurt. Maybe some won't like this, but I certainly enjoyed it and will order it again. The food never takes too long to come out and when you see the efficiency of the people at the register, taking both eat-in and take-out orders and wrapping up the orders-to-go with amazing dexterity and rapidity, it becomes impressive how fast the food comes out, with the volume of business.\\n\\nEverything you eat in and with is disposable, ranging from plastic to styrofoam. These people don't have time to wash your gazillion dishes, so just gobble up the yummy food and keep it moving. I'm excited to try other dishes, especially the vegetarian ones, and the kulfi, which is made in-house and served in the traditional clay pots that you get to keep.

We were starving for some South Indian food and when we tried to go to Saravana Bhavan, we found out they were closed for the day. So our second choice was MGR cafe, a place that I hadn't been to, but have heard good things about. Unfortunately, it was a little farther away and our stomachs were growling so loud you could probably hear us from a mile away. Anyway, we decided we'd give Udipi a try. All of us had been there before and while I didn't find it spectacular, I thought it was serviceable. When we went to the Lawrenceville Hwy location, we found that they'd moved down the street to Church St. So we made the short trek and found out they're in the old location of Bamboo Garden, a restaurant that was fairly decent, don't know why they closed (at least that location). Anyway, when we walked in, we were seated pretty quickly. That should have been a sign as it was right during the lunch hour, yet there were only two other tables occupied. We all got the buffet, don't know if they have a la carte plates for lunch. The buffet had about eight dishes, some cold idlis, a watery sambar, a vegetable korma, bhaji, eggplant, and a couple of others. Anyway, none of the dishes were great. The dal was watery, the masala dosa cold, and the korma sweet. Needless to say, we won't be going back.

I've recently learned to appreciate beets and all their earthiness (aka they sometimes taste like dirt) and Clyde Common combined beets with some interesting ingredients. Who would have thought that marinated beets, sherry, meringue and cashew butter would create such a unique dish? Obviously someone very creative in the kitchen. The sweetness of the beets combined with the crunch from the meringue and the nuttiness of the cashew butter was just divine. Seriously, this dish was one of the best things I ate in Portland, and that is saying a lot. \\n\\nNow that I've ranted about those beets, what more can I say? Everything I put in my mouth at Clyde Common was good. Some of the most simple ingredients are used in ways that make them extraordinary. For example, they had a beet green ravioli served in a vegetable soup with fava beans and peas. The dish looked like it would taste bland because it was so simple, but the flavors were all there. It tasted like a summer garden. The broth had amazing flavor that really brought out the vegetable flavors in the dish.\\n\\nThe fact that Clyde Common, The Ace Hotel and Stumptown are all in the same building is not only convenient for travelers but also just a great effing idea."},{"name":"Buffalo Wild Wings","address":"2386 Taylor Square Dr","city":"Reynoldsburg","stars":"3","text":"One of he nicer bdubs I've been to...

Held off on writing a review for a little while as I wanted to give this place some time to shake off the new opening jitters. First off, this place has such amazing potential. It's a beautiful restaurant with an amazing view of the city. That's pretty much all it has going for it on the positive front. That's the one star.\\n\\nI want to start this review off by saying that I live in the neighborhood and when I heard this place was opening, I was beyond excited. I was really pumped to have a serious dining establishment in my neighborhood so easily accessible. My girlfriend and I go out to eat all the time, probably twice a week and I really want this place to succeed and turn it around. We've been to Reelhouse 4 times.\\n\\nFirst, service here is just flat bad. Consistently flat bad. Speaking as someone that used to manage several restaurants, I know that it's really tough to find restaurant staff in Boston right now but servers here are very noticeably inexperienced, disengaged, poorly trained and the rest of the staff appears to be more of the same. The host stand was the most confusing part, I don't know if it's the system that they use or if the hosts just don't understand what they are doing but we were turned away for a table twice walking into a pretty much empty dining room. I'm always cool with grabbing a bar seat, but I just thought this was really bizarre.\\n\\nThe best description I can provide for the drinks here is that it reminds me of what they come up with in the show Bar Rescue when they go in to \\"fix a restaurant\\" but also have pay homage to their bev sponsors. Nothing really unique or interesting going on with the cocktails, all mass market liquors and nothing really craft or cool. They also shook my manhattans which is a tell tale sign of an inexperienced bar.\\n\\nThe food is okay not really memorable in any way, also very expensive. Not just for Eastie, in general. I have no problem dropping a lot of money on a good meal but only when service and drinks are on par with the experience. I might revisit again in a year or so, but honestly, for what you pay for to eat here out of convenience, take the extra time and money to go into Boston or Cambridge and get a great meal and service somewhere else."},{"name":"Bakersfield","address":"733 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Great food!

I'm all about restaurants specializing and doing one thing REALLY well, but I felt like it should have been a bit more... also, I need to caveat that this isn't necessarily my kind of pizza since I tend to prefer thicker crusts... \\n\\nIt was my fourth try on getting a pie here, and the woman was surprised at how excited I was that they were both open and still serving pizzas. I showed up and had a short wait... we got a half-and-half with sausage on one half and just cheese on the other. Overall, the crust was great. The cheese was good. The sausage topping was pretty good. The sauce was pretty good.

We also tried the butter lettuce salad w/ manchego cheese - again a hit, especially with the almonds and slightly spicy dressing. For meat dishes, we had the special chorizo w/ squid ink pasta - delicious, even the green peas in the dish (which are usually not my favorite); the lamb ribs (sooooo good, especially with the yogurt sauce); and the pork belly (maybe my least favorite of the 3, but only because I was getting full by then - the flavor was still very good). \\n\\nDessert: At our server's recommendation, we went with the quail-egg vanilla pot de creme - SO creamy and delicious, especially paired with the caramelized figs on top. I didn't expect to love it as much as I did. Also had some good coffee to round out our meal.\\n\\nDefinitely try FINO when you're in the mood for a laidback evening with some great food.

Coming from San Diego, CA I have high standards when it comes to taco shops. This is mediocre Mexican food. Majority of the workers are Central American - not Mexican. They got the basics down for putting Mexican dishes together but its just not fully there for me. They need a Mexican cook back there to tell them how to flavor and set the Mexican dishes up. For example, why the hell do they put beans and rice in burritos? Its so simple - meat, guacamole, cheese and sour cream. With a side of either green or red salsa.\\n\\nPros: They have cow tongue. Pupusas were good athough not even Mexican. Tamal was iight. Pupusas were cheap too. Arroz con leche was good. Their sopes were not authentic but they were still pretty good...they were more like a thick ass tortilla taco. \\n\\nCons: Prices too high for the amount of food I get. But then again I am accustomed to San Diego's cheap taco shops. $7-8$ for three rolled tacos?? Redic.

Next the food is overpriced; a similar pizza in town runs you at least 5 dollars less.  The price variance does not match the increase in quality or number of toppings.  And last, as several other reviews have touched on, the owner can be downright conceited.  We actually walked right by him with a rival local pizza [cough cough Engine House cough cough] and we not only got dirty look but the loud side comments about giving us a coupon for his better pizza and snickering were uncalled for.

Warning - This review is harsh on the delivery person - it's a thankless job, and I should know because I've done it - but I'm also equally certain that delivering means actually bringing the food to the building. \\n\\n1) I ordered for delivery and admittedly, to a building that is easy to see, but slightly difficult to drive to if you are not familiar with the area.  The driver called me, not to ask for directions to the building, but to ask me to come downstairs to get the order because he is on the street. This sounds like a normal request but involved me coming down from the 18th floor and walking about a block to get to the street. Once I got to the street, he was not within my view.  After about 5 min. on the phone with him trying to determine where he was (several buildings down the street - c'mon, he signed up to deliver stuff, not to bring it sort of closer) he finally got out of his car and met me on the street.  Then, I told him there was an easier way to get to the building next time and he told me to order from a different restaurant next time. Will do. \\n\\n2) Well, delivery is one thing and food is something else. Not so!  Sushi is better on site, of course, but I've ordered delivery from several places and this was the least pleasing.  It smelled quite fishy, which at least raises suspicions that it was not very fresh.  Some pieces were ok, a few were distasteful. 1/2 of my \\"sushi\\" was slices of an egg dish - a pleasantly sweet dish, but not what one normally gets when they order \\"sushi.\\" Additionally, despite the expense of the dish, a call to the kitchen verified that the \\"crab\\" was actually crab stick, which is off-limits to the wheat-free.

Years ago, in my younger days, you were an almost a magical place for me. Mexican martinis. Enchiladas. A sealed off smoking room and bar. Back then, you were the nexus of all my vices, and a safe haven for my friends and all of our pre-drunken and post-drunken shenanies. And now, as I just finished Sunday brunch with you, I am crestfallen to report: the magic is gone.\\n\\nIt was my sister-in-law's birthday. After a splendid birthday dinner at Steiner Ranch Steakhouse on Friday, we were also going to enjoy a brunch on Sunday. From what I gathered, some friends of hers raved and raved  about Trudy's brunch, going so far as to say they'd drive all the way from Dripping Springs to pay homage to its wonderfulness. Two things: 1.) I realize there isn't a lot going on in Dripping Springs; but 2.) They're wasting their gas, because if anyone asked *me*, I could have relayed that Sunday brunch at Trudy's is basically one big hangover cure, and not suited for much else. \\n\\nI can say this from experience. I never actually \\"ventured\\" to Trudy's after a night of carousing, so much as I usually \\"woke up\\" at one of the tables...usually when my old pal Andreea (Trouble) had decided it was time to gorge on \\"food product\\", as she called it, and somehow I'd been taken along for the ride. In my pre-Yelping days, I never really paid much attention at all to what I ate, except I remember having migas. And that \\"hair of the dog\\" with a Bloody Mary was usually the best hangover cure of them all. \\n\\nSo as I walked in, I realized this was the first time I was a guest at Trudy's when I was not massively hungover. In retrospect, that probably would have helped. \\n\\nThey won't seat you without your entire party. But once we did all congregate, we were seated rather quickly. Our booth was located on a far side, overlooking the patio. \\n\\nOur server explained we could order off the regular menu, or purchase the brunch buffet for $12. \\"Brunch drinks\\" (mimosas, margaritas, etc.) were $2.50. It's reasonable, I'll give them that. But I don't care about reasonable. I want fabulous. \\n\\nOn the buffet, all the selections are some shade of either yellow, orange, and brown. It's essentially the same basic ingredients, just mixed together in different combinations. Plenty of starches and carbs. Everything was perfect for settling a roiling stomach, but nothing was meant for any sort of discerning palette. I filled my plate with an odd mix of Tex-Mex breakfast staples, alongside some carrot cake French toast and a biscuit. Absolutely nothing stood out, except maybe the fried avocado. \\n\\nThe second pass through, I found even less options appealing. I tried some of the brisket enchiladas, which were passable. A bite of the \\"crab salad\\" was unremarkable. There was a slim selection of fruit, mostly pineapple and watermelon. I can't even tell you what else I had, it all sort of looked and tasted the same. \\n\\nThe only stand out was a peanut butter cup on the dessert table, which was thickly coated in chocolate and tasted absolutely amazing. My brother agreed this was probably the star of the show. Of course, I don't know what that says about a Tex-Mex brunch when the breakout selection of the day is a peanut butter cup. \\n\\nOur server was pleasant, but slow. I was halfway through my first plate, before I had to stop eating because the water and iced tea were not brought out in a timely fashion. I had to get my ice water from the bartender. My mother had to clear the menus out of the way before we sat down to eat. My dad bused the table when the dirty dishes were piling up. Each time, the waitress seemed just a minute or two behind where she needed to be. I understand it's busy. But still.\\n\\nComing back and forth from the buffet, I will say this though: people seemed to be having a grand old time. Each table was occupied, and there was no shortage of the general public shoveling in their mediocre brunch fare. Obviously, this place serves a purpose for some diners. It's great for college kids and those seeking a more \\"casual\\" environment. But it's just not my scene. Not in the least.\\n\\nThe whole experience was so completely forgettable. It was just...food. Nothing more, nothing less. Like I said before, it's the Shangri-La of Hangover Food, so I bet for many after a night out knocking back shots, this place would be 5 sparkling stars of amazing. \\n\\nBut stone cold sober, it's BARELY 2 1/2 stars...of nothing even remotely special. \\n\\nI give it 3 Stars (Rounded up...for all the good times in the past.)"},{"name":"Taco Loco Mexican Grill","address":"44 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"one of my favorite taco stands! best tacos around, excellent pupusas, all the hole-in-the-wall charm you could ask for."},{"name":"Jiko - The Cooking Place - Temporarily Unavailable","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Being a DVC owner and from NYC, when I vacation in Disney for dining, I'm expecting the best the Disney hospitality company has to offer. \\n\\nTrust me, I've had my share of family dinners at Ohana.

The BBQ tofu bun quite often reaches \\"craving\\" level for me. Thin, big pieces of age (fried tofu) are quick seared in a sweet, dark soy sauce and served generously over rice noodles, cucumbers, lettuce, & bean sprouts. The peanut sauce that comes with the both the bun dishes and salad rolls is creamy, thick and not overly sweet. \\n\\nMy other favorite dish that I especially crave around February isn't even on the menu. Regardless of this, Joy and her kitchen will still make up a dish of broccoli and tofu in a spicy lemongrass sauce, served with rice. Yes, Joy's daughter Jasmine has reminded me personally that this is because I'm a very special girl.\\n\\nThe off-menu Spicy Lemongrass Tofu w/Rice is a different tofu mix than shows up in the lemongrass tofu bun (also very good) and has quite a bit more heat. It is just the thing to warm up my cranky-self on a wet, winter evening.\\n\\nThe salad rolls, I find them just right!. They are not too overstuffed so they stay together when you eat them. There is a nice blend of lettuce, cilantro & rice noodles. The veg rolls have nice pieces of tofu that aren't oily & don't get lost in the other ingredients. Aside from the fab potato salad rolls at Van Hahn, I have to say that Joy's rolls at Pho Jasmine are some of my favorite around town.\\n\\nThe veggie pho is great too.

The restaurant is quite small, so our party of 12 was seated near the window, which was absolutely frigid.  Maybe they were trying to save on heating costs in the restaurant, I don't know.  \\n\\nOur server had an inexplicable attitude from the start, and just seemed \\"over us\\" before we'd even ordered, and somewhat annoyed with our presence.  She also brought us a menu (they're printed on paper) with a xerox of another employee's driver's license on the back.  Their menu is very small (except for the booze, which is weirdly extensive) and unusual.  I ordered one of their cocktails, a \\"noon-a-roni,\\" which was a gin and hibiscus bitters combination that tasted like jet fuel.  I also had a \\"hibiscus soda,\\" which was a delicious combo of hibiscus syrup and seltzer.  \\nFor my entree, I ordered the salmon with bok choi and green tea noodles.  All of the flavors were delicious, though the noodles were incredibly salty and the bok choi was a soggy mess.  Others in our party ordered the \\"eggplant scampi,\\" which was mediocre and a little light on the eggplant, the seabass with sweet potato puree, the honey chicken wings, sweet potato fries, lamb chop, and  hoisin duck, all of which were thoroughly enjoyed.  The four-cheese \\"risotto\\" did not go over well, and when one of our party sent theirs back, and our server explained to him that the dish was \\"not a true risotto, which is why it's described as short-grain rice on the menu,\\" and he ordered a durian custard (their only dessert!) instead, we were shocked to find his risotto still on our bill.  Our server explained that she couldn't take it off the bill unless there \\"was something wrong with it,\\" but that didn't stop her from taking the risotto back to the kitchen when he rejected it.  They did however take the disgusting durian custard off the bill.  That dessert was a combo of gluey wild rice topped with a durian-infused goo the stench of which I could not get out of my nose nor off my hands for an hour.   Why it was their sole dessert offering I don't know.\\nWhen we went to pay, we were informed that they accept a maximum of 4 credit cards for large parties, but would make an exception for our 5.

Anyhows, you make your own salad roll with the rice sheets, lettuce, basil leaves, prawn skewer, chicken, meatball and ground sausage (?). You also get crispy spring rolls with this dish. It's quite tasty. I recommend getting this with extra orders of skewers. This chili fish sauce was amazing. \\n\\n- Butter, garlic & green onion chicken wings (4/5): Good amount of chicken wings that are tasty. I was kind of expecting dry chicken wings but it wasn't ultra saucy or anything. Just lightly coated for flavour and it was good. I like them dipped and undipped. \\n\\n- Beef Short ribs rice dish (3.5/5): This dish was ok.

I had the short rib taco and the pastor taco, and we all shared some chips and salsa. I'm assuming the salsa was a salsa verde, as it was green with a lot of cilantro. I typically prefer the traditional tomato salsa, but I'm pro cilantro and it had a great flavor. Watch out though, because that heat will sneak up on you! Both of my tacos were delicious, and the short rib was tender and flavorful. I had a house margarita, which was strong and tasty, and not syrupy sweet.\\n\\nOverall, I would say that this place is worth checking out. I think that the prices are reasonable ($3-4 for a taco) but you might end up spending a bit more than you expect if you want to walk away full. El Camino has cheaper tacos, but less variety. There doesn't seem to be any discernible happy hour, so that was a bummer, but the prices are affordable enough that you could come here after work and spend less than $20 for a few drinks/tacos. Until it's been open for a decent amount of time, come here on a weekday and avoid the weekend madness."},{"name":"Beulahland","address":"118 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Went for brunch on a Sunday.  The waitress was nice and doing everything she could, but they were out of several items on the menu.  I was relegated to my fourth choice for a dish after finding out they were out of sweet potatoes for the Carolina hash and completely out of waffles.  On top of that, the poor table next to us tried to order something as simple as a bagel and the waitress had to return to the table to let them know they were out of that type of bagel.  How can a Portland restaurant survive if it can't reliably stock the ingredients it needs to offer most of the dishes on the menu?

I passed on reading other Yelp reviews so I could be objective but I had heard good buzz via the grapevine.\\n\\nA huge plus for Fino's is they have good parking.  On a Saturday night in Austin, this is a valuable commodity.  The ambience is cool and sleek, the patrons young and nice-looking in that well-heeled-yet-harmless way.  There is an outdoor patio with heat lamps that looked inviting, alas none of the heat lamps were on in 35 degree weather and frankly the cushions on the settees had seen better days.  Maybe it will be spruced up in warmer weather.  The bar was packed.\\n\\nMy general rule of dining out is to always try something I would not or have not prepared at home.  I joined a large group this evening and was delighted when a dinner companion and I buddied up to share an appetizer of fried olives stuffed with anchovies,  the pork belly comfit small plate as well as a seafood paella entree for two.  \\n\\nUnfortunately this is where things went downhill: the waiter overlooked our appetizers and brought just the paella.  \\"My bad\\" was his direct quote.  Uh, dude...  now is when you offer to bring them out anyway at no charge.  Instead, we had to twist his arm to even go back and drop the order to the kitchen.  In the meantime we dug in to the paella.  The rice was poorly prepared and there was an unpleasant old-fish-stock flavor to it.  This was in direct contrast to the freshness of the minimal but well prepared seafood topping the rice.  A lack of crispness to the rice at the bottom of the pan and the soggy, yet too firm texture left me with the distinct impression the rice had been prepared earlier in the day, allowed to sit, then reheated with fresh seafood placed on top.  This may be acceptable for a $15.00 paella, but at $42 for 2, no way-no how!  \\n\\nAfter grumbling a bit through the paella, picking off most of the seafood and leaving a fair amount of rice our appetizers finally arrived.  I don't know how one makes anchovie-stuffed olives relatively flavorless..  but Fino's managed to do it.  The pork-belly was crisp enough although the slaw could have used more citrus or acid to complement the protein. Again, the dish lacked that oomph, pizazz, wow-factor...whatever you call it (I call it flavor).  This seemed to be a theme for the evening in my humble opinion.  I tried a friend's sea bass ($25)...eh.  Her salt cod appetizer was mushy and flavorless, although the crostini it was served with was excellent.  \\n\\nI skipped desert because at $9.00 I had a feeling I would be disappointed and from the tastes I had of the molten lava cake (so trite) and the soggy zuchini bread, I made the right decision.

I LOVE this area for the tube tv that plays old school movies and tv shows. It's so cozy and nostalgic. One of the cool things about this place is there's no cover, and if you want a change, it's 3 places in 1, so you can just move to another room.\\n\\nEyeSpy is semi-outside; it has two bars, a dj booth, and no roof. You're not on a rooftop, but you have some views of the nearby buildings, which is cool. There's a little room off the back of it that I haven't been in, but I think it just has another bar inside. They have a couple TVs that play stuff like 80s cooking shows and Yo Gabba Gabba, while the DJ spins tunes. He plays mostly whatever's popular, but will randomly do a Spice Girls throwback song.\\n\\nFrom EyeSpy, you can climb stairs to Sky60, which is a roof top bar/dance area above BBQ Bar.

First of all the price of the 4 course menu at the restaurant was 25% more expensive than what they show online. Our dinner started with bread and butter. Bread was  good but it was not warm and fresh. We ordered duck and scallops for our appetizers and they tasted really good which makes us very excited about the other courses. I was ok with the pasta dishes even tough they were small and simple but my girlfriend thought they were not done right and she couldn't eat any of them. Also both courses lack the nice plating you would expect from an upscale restaurant. Service was also really slow. Our 4 course dinner took nearly 3 hours. There has been times I looked around the restaurant and almost nobody had food on their tables. For our Entrees, we ordered the ribeye steak for two which had an extra charge. They brought it on a tray table and ribeye looked amazing from outside. Then our server started slicing it and we could see that he was having hard time cutting the steak with his knife. Once it was cut, it looked perfectly cooked. Our excitement was short until we tried to cut the steaks ourselves and then chew them. It was very tough meat and almost impossible to chew. We had few bites and couldn't eat more. Then a lady from the restaurant maybe the manager approached and asked how was our steak. I told her it was not very good and it was very tough because maybe it was way too lean. She didn't say anything and left. Side dishes were not very good either. My girlfriend  wrote on our check very politely that we were very disappointed with the meal.

The salsa verde is the thin, creamy kind, made with tomatillos. The brown salsa is the right amount of chunky with a layer of delicious cilantro flavor. It's so good with chips and even better on top of whatever you order. The signature enchiladas are filled with queso fresco and onions and topped with more delicious sauce.

One thing I've noticed is that no matter how close you are to the staff, they'll always place your food on the glass counter.  You could be standing immediately beside them and they'll reach the other way and place your food on the glass counter (like out of the two of us, I'm going to be the one to pass a communicable disease!).

This place really does rip you off and kind of really ruined our night. They try to fit way too many tables in a very small space. We were very close to leaving as soon as we saw inside but we thought we would give it a try. \\nWe were sat, but had to get up and move because we were so close to the group next to us and could here every single word each of them were saying as if they were talking right in your ear. i am sure they weren't trying to be as loud as they were, but it was WAY too loud, we couldn't hear ourselves talking. \\nThe hostess greeted us, but wasn't smiling or didn't really look at us. She had a very strong repugnant smell, but I guess that is how she likes to smell. \\nIt is not romantic, it actually feels cheap and dirty here. Music is no where near romantic and the people here are not romantic. Cheap chairs, cheap candle light, dirty utensils, (we had to wipe ours because there was still food or something dried on our forks), \\nWe wanted to like the place so badly, but just couldn't.  \\nDon't take your girlfriend or boyfriend here. Not a romantic place. They will think you are cheap. REALLY. I am saying it again. \\n\\nIn a nut shell, the food was basically fish and veggies with melted butter all over them. \\n\\nYou cannot see anything here. This place is WAY too dim. It's very hard to see anything. It's the darkest restaurant we have ever been to. \\n\\nWe were not offered any free samples of wine however, the much older group of people that were being seated immediately got asked and had samples. I guess that is alright since the restaurant knows they have more money, but we didn't feel like we were getting any kind of special treatment. If anything the lady gave us attitude for wanting to move from the noise. \\nThe restrooms are REALLY small. Small toilet, very small sink.\\n \\nWe got the menu de jour with was a total of 56 dollars for two people plus tip and let me tell you, it wasn't worth it! Don't make the same mistake! Don't get it! The salad was honestly so small and was tossed in too much oil and had a total of one small cherry tomato slices, some greens, and a poached egg, the cup of soup (tomato basil) was WAY too salty, the trout was OK just it was swimming in butter and was mostly skin, the crayfish tails we were suppose to get were extremely small (we got four little tails) and covered with butter, the salmon had a really heavy sauce that stays in your mouth for hours and was of course swimming in butter, and finally the dessert: creme caramel and chocolate mousse. The mousse comes in a small shallow bowl and is not well presented. It's just a flat layer of mouse in a flat small bowl. The creme caramel is Mexican FLAN. It's FLAN that is priced at 7 bucks. Go buy the exact same thing at the grocery store for a dollar. They taste exactly the same and are as equally as terrible to eat. While your at the grocery store go get the canned tomato basil soup for a dollar. Bon appetite.  \\n\\nWe felt like the hostesses were dressed too casually for the price of everything else. \\n\\nNo need to dress up if you are coming here. Everyone wears casual clothes. \\n\\nWe went to go to eat tacos after the \\"three course meal\\" because we weren't filled at all. That is pretty sad. I probably felt hungrier after eating at this place and felt guilty for consuming that much better and fat. If you're going to eat this much fat it should be TASTY. This place had no taste. The tacos were so much more satisfying, filled with tons of taste and we were completely happy with the price we paid for them. \\n\\nThe slices banquettes you get look fantastic, but that was about it. Really hard, no softness as all. No taste at all. Better off eating paper. \\n\\nThey were playing Indian music while we were there... ???\\n\\nIf I was just rating the French server who later served us I would give him a five: super nice, big smile, quick on his feet, spoke French to us, super cool guy. The other two ladies a three: no smiling, super casual clothes, and just not happy people. And the food: a one. The environment: a one.

The theming is great and if you are a Disney fan you will love the details in this restaurant. \\n\\nI ordered the lunch pork roast with mashed potatoes and green beans. It was fork tender and delicious without being excessively salty. I shared this with my daughter since the kid choices weren't desirable (meatloaf, fish, macaroni with marinara and turkey on whole wheat)  and we got 2 cupcakes in lieu of a kids meal. \\nHealthy, I know. But hey, you're in Disney world. \\n\\nShe chose the chocolate cupcake with ganache and a raspberry filling. I chose the grey stuff cupcake. Both were excellent but I would give the edge to the grey stuff cupcake. The grey icing (panna cotta cookies and cream) was light and sweet and the pearl candies added a surprising crunch. It reminded me of the little chocolate candy coated balls that you get at valentines day - except not stale and bitter. These were very good. The only downside was the wrappers. Fancy, but really hard to get the cupcake out without destroying it. \\n\\nWe ate in the west wing which was pretty much like eating in the dark. Excellent theming though but it can be a little scary for really little ones because of the loud noise every time a petal falls and the lightning flashes. \\n\\nWe took a look in the other rooms as well and the lighting levels seemed to be normal. If you are in the ball room be sure to look out the windows and see the snow falling. It's a neat effect. \\n\\nWe used the rose and our food was delivered promptly.

The hallway was lined with knights in shining armor. If you were quiet enough you could hear them whispering to each other (Oh my humans; the Master's not going to like this stuff like that)  Then this is where everything went hi-tech and quite impressive when you find out how it works. I'm assuming we were testing their lunch quick service but I'm not sure. \\n\\nYou go into the library where you are put to a computer to order and given a \\"magic rose\\" We were then seated and told to make sure we leave our rose on the table. We saw all the hosts/hostesses carrying around ipods so we had to ask how this place works. After having our hostess tell us 15 times it was all magic, she finally told us that the rose was a mini computer and the table itself was it's mother board. When we set the rose down it downloads our order to the kitchen then sends our location to the wait staff and that's how it works. I thought that was pretty cool. There are three sections to the seating area. The West Wing, the Ballroom, and the Rose Garden. The West Wing was super cool and if you're lucky enough to be there when the roses wilts the Beast will appear and slash his painting.. again pretty awesome.\\n\\nFor food we had a Tuna Naccois (know idea how to spell) Salad, Grilled Steak Sandwich, Carved Turkey Sandwich, Potato Leak Soup, Triple Chocolate Cupcake and Strawberry Cream Cheese Cupcake. The Tuna was OUTSTANDING the slices were seared to perfection with just a little kick. The salad was extremely tasty, random but I especially enjoyed the way the egg was cooked. I can't describe it but I posted a pic maybe you can see. My friend described the Grilled Steak Sandwich as \\"The best food he's ever had at Disney\\" I have to admit it was dang good. The baguette it was served on was a perfect bread/butter/garlic combo that made my heart melt. The turkey was legit turkey it tasted like Thanksgiving. I had never had Potato Leak soup but it was sooooo good and I envision myself craving it soon (or now) I had the Strawberry Cupcake and it was perfect, not too big, not too small, perfect. I didn't try the chocolate cupcake but I'm sure it melts hearts.\\n\\nMy first experience here leaves me highly recommending it. I can't wait to hopefully come back with my family over Christmas. I hear it's pretty booked though. Oh and rumor has it that when it opens it WILL serve alcohol. First time ever that beer or wine will grace the Magic Kingdom!\\n\\nShould be fun. Definitely a must see even if you just run in to look at the scenery. Hey it's Disney, anything less than \\"magical\\" would be a joke.\\n\\nOh and P.S.

At first, I was excited to see a much larger selection than the last business (Local Choice), with aisles and shelves stocked of beautiful produce, a large selection of artisan cheeses, a moderate sized selection of quality meats and fish, tons of middle eastern/mediterranean ingredients such as preserves, oils, vinegar's, and locally produced dairy and eggs. \\n\\nBut a few days ago when I went to get some ingredients for dinner, I noticed something different, something profound. Their fish was unfresh and handled/butchered very 'safeway esque'; The fresh herbs were BROWN and frazzled, things seemed a bit wary. Thus, I opted with what looked fresh otherwise, some cheese, the better looking produce, and some \\"fresh\\" bread.\\n\\nUnfortunately, when I went to eat the bread and cheese the following day, both were moldy. The bread had no expiration date and was tightly sealed, so I'd figured it was fresh and would last a few days until turning. Nope! The next day was 1/4 covered in blue mold, which to me says it was probably 4 days old at that time. After opening the rotten cheese, the expiration date was labeled the 2nd. I had bought it on the 9th. \\n\\nFrom a place with so much potential, It's absurd they would sell old, rotting, browning, expired products. Woe is me for not reading the fine print of expiration on a ripe stinky cheese which is of my preference. It's smelled ripe and perfect when I bought it, but the packaging and handling, and negligence to rotate product, presented a very over expired product instead. \\n\\nGet it together World Foods. Train your employees better. If you're going to sell the finer things, expect the finer consumer, the ones that know better. This place is by no means cheap.

They have good beer and wine and some of their menu dishes are good.  However, if we stray from a few dependable good choices (such as the dinner salad, the turkey burger, the nachos), the food becomes mediocre.   Also, they've recently gotten rid of some of our favorites (such as turkey tips, mediterranean salad, and excellent onion rings).  Still, we would remain faithful, if it weren't for the consistently lax (and sometimes downright rude) service!  Once, when our waiter was nowhere to be found, I flagged down a waitress whose annoyance was visibly plastered on her face when she reluctantly came to our table.

Each time we asked about pricing, she had to go back and check a list in the back of house, then come back and tell us, then go back and check, come back and tell us....  It took us about ten minutes to figure out drink orders, and the prices she gave us turned out to be wrong.\\n\\nIn particular, I ordered a martini and was told the base price, but after our server gave me my drink she laughed and told us there was a \\"shaking fee\\" of about $3 on top of the price she'd told me.

This crust is buttery and perfectly crisp on the bottom.  Toppings are mostly traditional but well-done.  The sausage is flavorful and finely-ground, and the tomato-basil is fresh and robust.  The sauce is regrettably mild and under-seasoned, but it's balanced by the strong garlic and oil of the toppings.

I figured... no one can eff up spinach artichoke dip. So thats what I ordered and a cocktail. I have read some of the reviews and similar to my experience... the staff was lacking. Probably because its not that busy, staff has to be cut down to a minimum to cut down on costs. Which I can understand but 20 minutes for a drink order or any kind of contact is a little nuts. If you are busy... stop briefly at my table and say, \\"Hello... I will be with you as soon as I can.\\" Nada.\\n\\nSo I figured ordering the spinach artichoke dip would be safe and no one can eff that up. I was wrong. First of all... if you decided to put chopped up raw tomatoes on top of a spinach artichoke dip... put that on your menu. If I would have known that... I wouldnt have ordered it. Garnishing it with a handful of tomatoes does not make that taste or look better. After scooping them out... it tastes like hardened tgif dip from the freezer. The best part was the pita bread to dip it in.\\n\\nI don't believe in giving 1 stars... I think its just cruel. The location is great... just needs some specials or discounted private parties to put some money in the staff's pockets and to make them motivated.

I adore their cold brew coffee, I the love their personable staff, and I totally dig the atmosphere. I went to dinner in a group of four, early on a Friday night. We arrived at six, and left just over two hours later. The indoor seating inside is limited, but beautifully warm, like eating in someone's country kitchen. There is a great mixture of table and counter options which can accommodate solo diners as well as larger groups. The open floor plan allows guests to see the coffee roaster, the service counter, and peek into the kitchen proper.\\n\\nFirst timers to BCK can feel a little overwhelmed looking at the brewing options for coffee and tea, but thankfully, the service staff are quite knowledgeable and well read into the menu. I did appreciate our server taking a step back to ask the correct answer to one of our questions instead of flippantly shooting off a potentially false answer. The dinner menu was simple with six options for first courses, five for entrees, and several incredible delicacies for dessert. Without a dining companion fluent in Foodie, the menu can seem a little overwhelming. I did appreciate that each item listed included a wine pairing, but as the main draw is coffee, I would have liked to see hot beverage pairings as well, especially in the winter.   \\n\\nMy only qualm was with the wait time for our meal. Don't get me wrong, I love and respect a chef who takes pride in their work. However, the wait time was longer than expected, and we decimated each course quicker than desired. I wouldn't equivocate it to \\"feeding time at the zoo,\\" but we were very hungry by the time we were served (nearly an hour later), so suddenly the portions felt too small and vanished too quickly. \\nPerhaps, they might have been a bit understaffed for a Friday evening, so with only several other tables both inside and out with guests, I did get a little frustrated.

There was just no magic- and we had 3 little girls with us! I get it- maybe she was having an off day or something was going on but it really left a bitter taste in our mouths.

They have the best wings! Everytime we go here we have to get the wings. Sometimes (most of the time) we go here because of the wings. My husband and I are huge wing people so whenever theyre on the menu we need to get them. He says I make them the best, so he's really picky when we go out. When I did my search for the area for wings, this place popped up. They have this wonderful grilled taste that just makes them perfect. Theyre big, theyre juicy, buffallo is actually hot (like it should be!), SOOo tasty! It's lunch time and I'm writing this, and now I need wings. Theyre that good. Once you think about them, you need them. Deff a local wing joint. There's other in the area that think they do them the best (big names like Hooters and Buffalo Wild wings) but no one can touch these wings. \\n\\nBesides wings, the beer is great. My husband always gets a burger when we come since they have some weird/unique creations. the first time we came here I got the one with perogies on it; dont remember the name, and he got the biggest one. It was huge, like bigger then your head. he can never have enough food in front of him (his eyes are way bigger then his stomach) so he tries to order something he thinks he big enough right...this thing scared him a bit. He couldnt finish it, so I took a bite. Delicious. Mine was great too. I never had a burger quite like it and thats half the reason it was so good. the patty was thick and juicy, the bread was fresh and not soggy, perogies...things that shouldnt be on a burger, but are huge surprises when you bite into it, and way to good to never get again and again! \\n\\nThe second time he got the jerk burger and it was good, not as good as the other two we had last time. I got the perogie & sausage platter. Wow. Wow..thats all I can say. First of all the portions are huge; I'm not a little eater. I'm a chick & I love food so when we go out (with his big appitite) it's like an event. We love checking out new places for the purpose of sampling their menus and (or course) then I jump on here and write about them.  But yeah..the platter. I grew up with a polish famliy so I'm particular with my perogies. These were the best Ive ever had outside of my own. They're soft like they should be with a slight toughnes, carmalized onions (a must!), and the sausage....oh the sausage! Schmidt's didnt even come close. But seriously..who'd a thought! \\n\\nThis is my favorite place in the city so far for good eats and fun night out. Service could be a bit faster but theyre always packed so it's understandable.

Something got mixed up.  They told my friend to go ahead and start on the TV dinner while they fried up some chicken. The TV dinner was a steak diane with filet mignon, mashed potatoes and broccoli. It was ok. Small portion and is served in a tv dinner like dish, with the smallest portion of mashed potato, more like a puree that we'd ever seen.\\n\\nMy pasta was ok. I wouldn't get it again. It was bland and the pasta mushy, though it is fresh pasta so that's never as firm as dried.\\n\\nThe best thing was the fried chicken when it arrived.

It's a really bizarre choice and much too spicy for the general public.

There was no offer to help us with the bottle of wine and three glasses, leaving my mom to figure out how to best get everything inside. When we got to the front, the hostess said there was another five minutes until our table was ready- which would normally be fine, but there is practically nowhere to stand in front of the restaurant without being in the way. She left to go check on the table, and we were asked by the manager what we were doing there- to which we answered that we were waiting for our table. I was confused as to why no one seemed to know what was going on, and why they were all being very brusque. When we did get to our table, our server was very weird. He was very awkward, but not in that he was uncomfortable or nervous, just that he made us feel awkward. He once came up to the table and gestured for a few minutes, somehow expecting us to understand what he was about to say. We honestly thought he had smoked something, based on the way he was acting.

A glass of wine, 3 stuffed small shrimp and 3 half dollar size medallions with at least a cup of mashed potatoes along with a cup of dessert coffee.... $58.

This brand new Brewery-Taproom takes the Slumbrew experience to a whole new level. My wife and I ordered several items to share so we could sample as much as possible. We started with the Greek Salad, which after we split it, there was enough left for two more people. Very tasty and a great start. We then sampled the Pulled Pork Nachos. Wow! Some of the best nachos I've had in some time. The BBQ sauce on them had just the right kick to liven then up. We then split a Meatball Sandwich. Again I was impressed with a very solid rendition of a classic sandwich. just the right combo of meatballs and cheese on a Chibatta sub roll. We then had to try the Hot Soft Pretzel which came with 3 different dipping sauces. Ask for the spicy one, it'll clear your head and tastes so damn good. As for the beer, you can't go wrong with any of the selections. My favorites are Happy Sol, a very good Hefeweizen loaded with Blood Oranges. Then there's Flagraiser, one of the best Double IPA's I've ever had. One of my new favorites is their SeasonAle  Creep, which is a Galaxy Hopped Saison, with incredible citrusy flavors. Matty the General Manager stopped by to make sure everything was OK and Chelsea our server was incredibly knowledgeable about all the beer and food selections and was super friendly. Jeff and Caitlen, the Slumbrew founders, should be very proud of what they created in the Boynton Yard area of Somerville.

My friends and I (party of 6) took a water taxi over to this restaurant in hopes of good drinks, food and a great view of the city.  After reading reviews, our expectations were pretty low but decided to give it a shot because of the views of the city on a warm Labor Day holiday.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, we were told that there was a 2 hour wait for outside dining and a half hour wait for inside. We decided to put our names down for the 30 minute inside wait and  all grabbed a drink at the bar. It took about 20-25 minutes to get a drink at the outside bar...the one bartender was slow and the bar was pretty full. No big deal, I still wasn't expecting much.\\n\\nAbout an hour goes by, and we still didn't get called for our table so a friend decided to check in with the front desk. He was informed that the restaurant was no longer taking walk ins and we would have to wait an additional hour to be seated. What is baffling to me is that the restaurant was at about 40% capacity (if that) and there were PLENTY of seats available (see photo of outside seating area). My friend asked to speak to a manager and was told that he couldn't because he was so busy. After insisting that the manager come out to speak with him, he appears disheveled and obviously stressed. He stated that the kitchen was crazy and he would do his best to get us a seat as soon as possible.\\n\\nAs a group we decided to go elsewhere. In addition to the very long wait, stressed out manager, what appeared to be an abundance of tables, we saw tables of people who were there for at least an hour and a half who still didn't get their food. We were far too hungry to wait which we could assume would be another few hours for food and decided to head back to the city for other options. Reelhouse missed out on a fairly large party who drink lots and tips well.\\n\\nThis place has potential but if the management stays as disorganized as it is, it's only a matter of time before this location closes down."},{"name":"Rasoee Modern Indian","address":"463 W 8th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"I've been here twice now and I don't think I'll be going back. I found virtually everything disappointing. The pieces of lamb in the lamb curry were decent but the rice was undercooked (a bit watery tasting) and the curry had very little flavour. It tasted mostly like spice (which would hit way too hot in pockets, it didn't seem evenly distributed). The spinach with cheese tasted almost the same, but with slightly watery cheese instead of lamb.\\n\\nIt might be, as another user said, that they're trying to go for a really low-calorie offering. This wasn't advertised anywhere though, and I'm inclined to think the food is sub-par as healthy can still be delicious. Even the fries tasted more bland than regular fries, and these ones were spiced! They had a certain cooked/baked earlier hardness, not the nice crunch you look for in a fry. If the naan is baked in an oven it has none of the tell-tale charred markings that add so much flavour and just kind of feels like a big, boring chewy piece of bread. \\n\\nThe service was hit and miss, one guy seemed really ambivalent and not particularly friendly but the other guy was quite nice. I liked the decor and the presentation of the food, but that doesn't really make up for the fact that I felt like I was eating something I could have made better at home. I didn't even end up packing my leftovers. The clincher was when I realized that the cost of two curry combos works out to about $15 each with tax and tip, which is what I spent at nearby Peaceful Restaurant the other day where the food is consistently fantastic."},{"name":"Hoggy's Restaurant and Catering","address":"830 Bethel Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Last week my boyfriend and I made the trek up to Bethel Road to give this place a try. We'd passed it many times before, but never knew what it was. We were feeling adventurous and stopped in to get some food to take home.\\n\\nParking was easy as there was a huge lot that was sort of shared with a strip mall type place, and I think the location isn't bad because if you're on 315, it's really close when you get off the exit. Anyway, the place was really clean and had an interesting look to it - kind of modern but with all these pictures hanging up on the walls in black and white of old movie stars. Then we looked at the menu. I wanted to like this place. In fact, I wanted to love this place. Everything sounded so unique and delicious. Things seemed a bit pricey, but I thought that if it was good, it would be worth it.\\n\\nA woman greeted us when we walked in and she was pretty helpful. You have to go to the register to order first and we didn't see it, so we were standing there a bit confused and she pointed us towards the menus and the register. They had everything from salads to subs to pasta to burgers. They even made their own custard there. My boyfriend and I were in the mood for burgers. So he got the Uncle Ken's All American Burger and I ordered the Uncle Vito's Buccelli Burger. The kid at the register wasn't so friendly, but he took our order and then that was the only time we saw him. Before we sat down to wait, we both each got a drink. They had these bottles of root beer type drinks there, and my boyfriend got the root beer and I got the black cherry drink. I don't remember what they were called, but if you go there you'll see them. They were sitting right in front of the register and the kid who took our order got us some cold ones from the back. We sat down to wait at this counter where you could sort of see into the kitchen and sipped on our drinks, which were delicious. His root beer was so good and mine really tasted like black cherries, but it wasn't too sweet. It was pretty nice to just sit there and drink our drinks and smell the yummy smell of burgers coming from the kitchen. So far so good.\\n\\nWe waited around 15 minutes for our food and then the nice woman who helped us earlier bagged up our food and we took it home. I was quite excited about my burger because they are served on pretzel buns here and I've never tried that before. We got home and unpacked the food - two burgers and some fries. Upon tasting the fries I was happy - they were really good and although they didn't give us ketchup, I was fine because I happened to have ketchup at home. \\n\\nBut the burger. What a disappointment! They smelled delicious, but when I opened mine I found that they had given me the wrong one. The one I ordered was supposed to have bacon, bleu cheese, mushrooms and crispy fried onions. It sounded so good and I was so excited and ready to eat. Instead I looked under my bun to find mayo, red pepper relish stuff and white cheese (maybe mozzarella or provolone). FYI, I hate mayo and I don't like relish very much. The burger they ended up giving me was the Buccelli Burger, so obviously the stupid kid who took our order wasn't listening or didn't catch me saying \\"Uncle Vito's\\" before the rest of the name - not a good idea to have two names so similar. I really wanted to go back and complain, but by then the place was closing because it was getting late and it was like a 15 minute drive - too far to drive all that way. The burger wasn't that great. It was really big, but I still wasn't happy. I mean, the pretzel bun was really good, and the burger itself, which was a mix of beef and sausage (like a regualr burger but it was somewhat spicy like sausage - an interesting mix!), was tasty, but I really didn't like those toppings and had been so looking forward to the toppings I was supposed to have. It was just all such a disappointment. This place had some real potential, and I think I would really like it if I tried it again and got the right food. But for now, I've been burned and I just can't say if I'll go back or not. That was too much money to spend on something that was such a let down. That being said, my boyfriend's food was all correct and he rather enjoyed his meal. I ate some of the burger and all of my fries, but was definitely not impressed since it wasn't at all what I wanted. But like I said, the pretzel bun was really good. But since I've heard of other places that have pretzel buns, I'll likely go there before I give this place a chance again. Such a shame because like I said, this place was gearing up to be a possible favorite of mine. So much for making a good first impression.\\n\\nWe might try it again, but I think this time I'll have to eat in their dining room so that if anything goes wrong I can have them fix it. I just do not trust this place's carryout. If you do decide to try it, I'm sure you'll be satisfied as long as you're given the right food.

We sat at a high top with a group of four and had an amazing experience--the food was delicious and the service was extremely on point and helpful in suggesting things to order.\\n\\nWe started with the homemade bread basket, which consisted of three different types of bread: squid ink bread, an Italian fish sauce bread, and seaweed bread, along with a white bean & squid ink dip and a smoked seaweed butter. Unbelievable! Each of the breads had such unique, saline flavors that you would never expect to find in bread--the soft, chewy texture was also fantastic, and the white bean/squid ink dip was to die for.\\n\\nWe continued with the raw & pickled vegetable salad, a generous portion of escarole greens dressed in an herb vinaigrette and crunchy breadcrumbs. The grilled asparagus with tonnato sauce and smoked olives was nice as well, as were the citrus grilled prawns with cilantro raita (an Indian-inspired yogurt sauce). But perhaps the best small plate dishes were the stuffed Point Judith squid and the king crab. The stuffing for the squid contained black squid ink, and the pieces were plated over a delicious white bean puree. The king crab was an absolute umami bomb--the small, sweet chunks of crab meat were served over black rice and a chili garlic oil; the portion was a little bit small, but amazingly tasty nonetheless.\\n\\nFinally, we had the emmer casarecci pasta, a generous portion of al dente noodles with parsnip, hazelnuts, nutritional yeast, and maitakes.

Too much sugar, but I guess its better than just fries or slaw.   \\n  My girlfriend had a burger with friends.  I wanted to try the fries so i could review them.  The ones I tried were a little too soggy from the fryer, but they weren't overly salty.\\n\\n  We both ordered mixed drinks.  I had a cran with vodka and she had a cosmo.  For the price of the mixed drinks, I think the amount of alcohol was severely lacking.  The cosmo wasnt shaken well and seemed like a small portion compared the glass size and how much was poured.\\n\\n  They are relatively new, so I will go back after a few months to see if they have made any improvements.  I will say this, we honestly felt the service was the best.  Friendly, helpful and considerate.

Besides being together, the absolute highlight of our week is going to Boma for dinner. The atmosphere is so cool and perfectly thought out, not as if you'd expect anything less from a Disney restaurant. When we go, we normally don't eat all day to prepare for the unreal dinner we're about to have. Also, there is a strategy! We start with the hummus's (4-6 variety), then we move onto the soups (also always 4-6) , after that we'll load up on all of the sides because not one of them is anything less than extremely flavorful! Also, my cousins go crazy over Boma's mac and cheese. They're in their 20s, and they talk about it all year long, no joke. Instead of dessert, we usually have the peanut butter rice (trust me on this.. we also asked for the recipe and make it for holidays as well!).

Explained our group size, what our timing was, budget, etc... Was told that I would get a call later in the day from the GM who handled group events. No call no email. Called 3 days later and got someone else. Was told that the person I was talking to was a manger - I won't use his name - but he had one of those tones that made it seem like he was doing a favor by answering my call. Finally, feeling as if I was wasting his time, I finally asked if this was a good time for him - and his tone changed. Now we're not large business, but we're not a small group either - anticipating an event budget of $1800-$2000 for a lunch... So finally, after getting him to respond more favorably, was able to provide our details (again) to him and what we needed. \\n\\nWe then went here for lunch to try it out since we were having an event the following week and the place was nearly empty, with about 15-20% of the tables actually having people occupying them. We walked in and received no greeting what so ever. Being unfamiliar to this location, we didn't know if we needed to wait to be seated or if we could just grab whatever was open. So finally, after pulling someone aside, we were told that it was a seat yourself deal.  \\n\\nWe chose a table in the rear, behind the bar, and frazzled bartender told us that he would be helping us. We put in our drink orders and waited, and waited some more, finally our iced-teas came out. When we asked if there was Splenda, he grabbed the dish of sugar, sweetners, and the thing only had 1 Splenda in it (lol)! And the only person who got a soda, ended up getting iced-tea as well.\\n\\nWe waited, and waited some more, and finally were able to put in our orders. About 45 minutes later, we still did not have our food, and told the bartender/server that we were now in a rush to make our meeting at 1:00pm. He apologized and said something along the lines that he forgot to put in our orders. Finally after about an hour after waiting, our food came out. For the most part our food was OK, but someone in our group who ordered an Avocado Chicken Club, got her sandwich without Avocado and her entree was mushy and cold.  \\n\\nDuring our wait, we overhear one of the waitresses complaining out loud about how \\"someone\\" was being rude - while we don't believe it was us (since none of us were abrasive or rude) it almost seemed like she was commenting loud enough for us to overhear. Also complaining about how they were slammed. If you've ever been to this location and see the size of it, and only 15-20% of the tables actually having people seated - no one could mistake this for being \\"slammed\\" - it was nearly empty.\\n\\nWe finally asked to speak to the manager, to give some feedback, to which we were told he was unavailable and was unwilling to come out.

My girlfriend and I were craving wings this past weekend, and since I knew that Barley's and Smokehouse have the same wings, we decided to give it a chance.\\n\\nFirst off, I haven't even stepped foot in here before which is surprising, since I've literally been left, right, and above it. It's actually a really nice place on the inside with a nice warmth to it. Our server was super nice although aloof at times (I had to order my beer a second time, and she appeared to not even know I had ordered one in the first place). She did make a great recommendation on an entree for my girlfriend. Before I get to those, I'd like to point out that I really loved the pale ale they make here. It has great flavor and is not super hoppy or too light.\\n\\nWe started off with some wings which, in my opinion, are some of the best in town. They're smoked and then grilled and tossed in a light sauce so the chicken really stands out. I recommend the Chipotle or Buffalo sauces. I'll say that I noticed that the sauces here are much saltier than the ones at Smokehouse which would make it a hard for me to eat a lot of them.\\n\\nFor my main course, I went with the Dragonfire burger, and this is where I'm deducting a star. It was cooked exactly how I wanted, but it really just didn't have great flavor. It's supposedly seasoned with Cajun spices, but I wasn't getting any of that and the Diabla sauce wasn't very flavorful either and wasn't that hot. I added bacon to it which helped a little bit, but overally, it was pretty underwhelming. My girlfriend went with the pierogis and sausage, however, and really liked them. From the bite I had, I'd say she picked the better dish.\\n\\nBarley's has an extensive menu that I'd like to dive into a bit more. Unlike it's former counterpart, there's not much BBQ going on here, so it's really quite different, but that's a good thing. I don't know if I'd give the burgers another shot, but the other items looked very tasty, especially after trying the pierogis.

As for their shumai? Soggy and simple at best and definitely tasted frozen. After this experience I haven't returned to Mentei in over 2 years.\\n\\nUp until now, after getting off work on Newbury and craving something hot and filling I decided to once again see if Mentei has changed. As their decor was the same, I honestly ordered my food with little expectations.\\n\\nI had ordered the Pork Cutlet Ramen while my friend ordered the Tonkatsu Curry rice.\\n\\nHonestly after such a bad experience I can honestly say I was impressed. The ramen, although not as rich and flavorful as other ramen spots, it was definitely hot, filling, did indeed have flavor and did an exceptional job of getting me full while warming me up. \\n\\nI tried my friend's tonkatsu curry rice and was very impressed with how flavorful and rich their curry sauce was, rich and savory that greatly complimented the hot and crispy fried pork. Was this really the same Mentei I had 2 years ago? \\n\\nSide others and such could use more work but overall, I am impressed with Mentei's quality over the years.

Now that is a delicious all American meal.\\n\\nI recently to my friend from Hong Kong, Angus, to Pine State. The following is a brief dialogue we had.\\n\\nAngus \\"This is why Americans are so fat\\"\\nMe \\"Angus, I'm not fat, you're fat. I only eat food like this once a month, so it's okay.\\"\\nAngus \\"That is because I eat your fat food! You're not fat because you're American, you have a special stomach that absorbs most of the fat you eat, so you can eat more food and not get fat!\\"\\nMe \\"No, I just eat in moderation. You just eat fast food and sit on your ass.

Rarely do restaurants live up to the hype, but this one did. It somehow managed to exceed our expectations, and it was so far the best breakfast of my life. I'm picky about my biscuits, especially since my Mom makes the best biscuits I have had. These were not my Mom's biscuits, but damn if they weren't close. The chicken was tender, juicy, and deliciously seasoned. The hash browns were also some of the best I have had. Not mushy, or overly crispy. They were just right. Neither of us had fried green tomatoes before, so we didn't have much to go by, but we loved them. We barely finished the pie, which was also very good, but would have been better if we hadn't already gorged ourselves.\\n\\nAfter our breakfast, which was to be our first and only meal of the day, we sat there  marveling at breakfast we just ate, talking about opening a southern restaurant in Hong Kong.

But, that was then and this is now.\\n\\nIn the past few years, I've gone from being a weekly diner at Trudy's to saying NEVER AGAIN. Why? Well, because Trudy's doesn't seem to really care anymore. Their North location no longer serves lunch and the standard of their food, as well as cleanliness has gone downhill fast.\\n\\nAfter weaning myself off of Trudy's for the past few years, I decided to have one more go and to satisfy my mad chicken fried steak craving. I ordered the steak, the cheese mashed potatoes, refried beans, and a Mexican Martini. The steak was HUGE, but sadly most of it was breading. The steak itself was dry and tough, the breading wasn't seasoned and it was a big disappointment. The cheesy mashed potatoes used to be gorgeous and thick with lots of cheese. What I got tasted like instant mashed potatoes and had absolutely no cheese. The beans tasted canned, which maybe they always were. But, they've changed to another (probably cheaper) brand and they taste like flavorless paste. The martini was weak and watery, a shadow of its former deliciousness. My partner ordered one of their new burritos and it was likewise bland and tasteless. We paid our check, took our uneaten food, and decided there was cheaper shitty Mexican food to be had in this town.\\n\\nI took the opportunity to contact Trudy's management, to let them know that the quality of the food at their North Location was seriously slipping. It could be due to the store manager, so I thought the corporate office should know. What I got back was a wealth of excuses for the crappy food, insinuating questions, and a generally snarky reply. I advised this general manager that I'd be happy to accept a gift card and return to the same location to let him know if anything had improved, but never received a reply.\\n\\nAt this point, I think Trudy's is more interested in shilling cheap shit for high prices and making money on booze. They certainly no longer care about customers who have spent literally thousands of dollars in their restaurant. They no longer care about serving quality food. And they can't even be bothered to fix up their crappy building and keep it clean. Seriously, take a good look at this place and tell me it's not run-down. I've also smelled sewage in the restaurant and opted to sit outside.

Over the course of a year, I've yet to find a sandwich I like: the Cuban sandwich was terrible and offensive to Cuban culture (it's since been removed from the menu), the curry chicken was made of surprise chicken salad (why would you do that? *also removed from the menu), the smoked salmon just wasn't special, and the grilled cheese made of Gruyère and Monterrey  jack is a good idea theoretically, but is only so-so in reality. I've more than struck with the sandwiches at this point... and since I've stopped drinking coffee regularly their decent café au lait isn't enough to beckon me in every morning.\\n\\nMore or less, I only like two food items at Crema: the quiche and the tomato bisque. Their different quiche are not remotely authentic, but they are still ridiculously good. I didn't think I would ever say positive things about a quiche with sweet potato in it... The tomato bisque is amazingly filling and good to eat even in the heat of summer. I'm even hooked on the little piece of focaccia that comes with the soup. I also recommend their special cold summer drinks. Their different limeades are always on point. The staff is exceptionally nice despite the fact that they spend a large amount of their time explaining their stupid $10 credit card limit to customers. Even the music, a blend of soft, ambient indy rock/pop, is friendly. I guess the atmosphere, the quiches, and the tomato bisque are enough."},{"name":"Los Pinos Mexican","address":"4919 Hudson Bend Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"We have been going to this place for 10 years and like it...BUT tonight went in and the place reeked of Pine Sol, chemicals, and laundry detergent.

It was recommended to us by the Marriott Long Wharf down the road.

The Snapper was excellent & was a very good combination of parmesan-crust and fish. The only negative was the crab meat placed on top of the fish, which was more crab than to my liking. The asparagus was cooked well and tasted average; I've had worse but I've had better. I definitely would recommend the Snapper as it was very  tasty! \\n\\nFor dessert I ordered the Boston Cream Pie. It was my first Boston Cream Pie ever tasting, and I was impressed. The pie had a good & equal distribution of the chocolate, cream, and sponge cake throughout. The pie was also not too sweet, which I enjoyed. \\n\\nThe service was good. Our waitress was a nice Russian girl who gave us good service. She was friendly and did everything a waitress should do. The restaurant itself was also an interesting place. It was an older building and inside was exposed brick and wooden beams on the ceiling.

We had an 8:15 reservation, although we'd requested 8:00.  We showed up at 7:45 thinking we'd get a drink at the bar, however they were able to seat us right away.  Kudos!  Our waiter was fantastic as well.  We requested the sommelier, even though I didn't see Bobby there.  My wife explained we'd like a nice white w/ apps and first courses and a nice red for the main courses.  He gave us a few options of which my wife wasn't a fan, but he was speaking mainly to me and not my wife.  When she finally explained she wasn't into French Sauv Blancs, he quickly went into the back to ask for help. (we're assuming)  It was bizarre, and when he came back he still wasn't talking to my wife who'd engaged him in the first place, but rather to me.  When he brought the wine he asked if I wanted to taste it, and I said my wife should.  This was pretty disappointing to both me and my wife from such a high-end restaurant.  His recommendation was a great wine, and I ordered the red which also was a fantastic recommendation.  Now, I know this would not have happened had Bobby not been out, hence I'm sticking with 5 stars as I know this is an exception to the rule.\\n\\nThe food.  The Salumi plate and Frico Caldo are the best damn appetizers in the Denver area.  I've tried to make the Frico Caldo at home, but apparently people who've worked at the French Laundry are far superior cooks or teachers to those who cook than I am.  We were sharing family style with another couple, and the short rib took the cake for the next round with the gnochi coming in a close second.  The prawns and pasta were just ok.  For secondi, we tried the chicken thigh, pork loin, beef shoulder, and a fish dish that I believe was snapper.  This was a split decision with the pork loin being the crowd favorite, the beef shoulder coming in second, although I loved the chicken thing.  We all agreed the snapper was just ok.\\n\\nFor dessert, we shared the Frangapine Tart, coffee shake, house made chocolates, and I don't recall the other.  The Pear Frangapine Tart was good.  The house made chocolates were to die for, but the true star was the coffee shake.  The shake was wonderful, but comes with the best brownie I've ever had.\\n\\nAgain, a fantastic meal with a bit of a snafu on the service side.

Not just biscuits, those hard, crusty things that need a solid soaking in gravy to make them palatable, but excellent, fluffy, buttery biscuits. As we do not usually get really good biscuits, this was something worth chasing down.\\n\\nIt turns out the place is Pine State Biscuits, and was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. The Mothership is located out at 37th and SE Belmont, and is legendary for its long waits and lack of seating (\\"plan on sitting on the curb\\" writes one Yelper). That didn't sound like a good plan for a Saturday morning after a late night of dining and drinking. There's a slightly closer location, on NE Alberta, but again, longish bus ride and walks. Meh.\\n\\nTurns out that Pine State makes a regular appearance at the PSU Saturday Farmer's Market . This event takes place at the south end of the South Parks Blocks. Great location for the event.\\n\\nIt's about a 30 minute wait at 11AM. Herself and I agree that all lines need Disney-style \\"Your wait from this point will be about minutes\\" signs. There was one order taker/cashier, and five (or six) guys doing the cooking and serving. This turns out to be the right division of labor for them, avoiding bottlenecks.\\n\\nWhat we were waiting for (okay, what I was waiting for-Herself had gone for crepes) was the famous Reggie, a sandwich (sort of) made of:\\n\\nSausage gravy\\nBiscuit half\\nBacon\\nCheese\\nFried chicken breast\\nBiscuit half\\n\\nfrom top to bottom. They also serve sweet tea, the perfect accompaniment. Herself tried to eat it as a sandwich; while I was totally into licking gravy off my fingers, a knife and fork worked better for me.\\n\\nWas it up to the hype? Yes, very much so. The chicken was as good as it could get, the breading maintaining its adherence to the chicken despite the best efforts of cheese and gravy, but moist and tender inside. The bacon was crisp enough to bite cleanly, but did not shatter.\\n\\nOh, and the biscuit. It's almost a shame to use this biscuit as a bun, because it is so soft, flaky, tender, buttery, and generally possessing all the characteristics desirable in a biscuit. It is the essence of all that is good in biscuits.\\n\\nA Reggie runs $7, or $8 for a Deluxe, with an egg on top. Options involving biscuits and other fillings/toppings are available, mostly for less."},{"name":"Cheeseburger Bobby's","address":"5975 Roswell Rd","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4","text":"My fav burger and fry spot!

When I saw all of the activity I knew this must be the place.  I haven't had Pho since my last trip to Saigon, so I was long overdue.  I'm using Pho 24 as my standard for comparison.  It's a well know chain in Vietnam that the locals patronize.  (Some would say it's the McDonalds of Vietnam).  It's reliably good, but not over the top great, so I thought this would be a fair comparison.  \\n\\nI think there are two keys to good pho - the broth and the noodles.  The thinly sliced meat is just that, so how bad can it be?  It's the broth and the noodles that matter. The broth at Xinh Xinh was very good; savory and well seasoned and every bit as good as Pho 24.  The noodles, however, weren't great.  They were too thick, cooked too much and clumped together.  Not at all what I would expect.  Still, I'm going to give Xinh Xinh 3 stars.  The service is good.  They try hard and it's very difficult to get good authentic Vietnamese food in Boston anyway.  This is about as good as it gets.  I will go back soon and try Xinh Xinh again, maybe when it's less crowded.  I might give the hot pot a try.

I guess it's trying to be a legit Szechuan spot now and well the results are a mixed (but mostly shitty) bag.  So there are differences between going to a Chinese buffet and going to a traditional Chinese restaurant.  The buffet is for when you want to experience variety while sacrificing the overall quality of food.  The traditional route is for when you really want to experience a more fully realized, higher quality version of the fare you would pick up at a buffet.  I see the merits in both and I frequent both types of establishments.  What Best of Szechuan did was take all of the recipes and quality of the old buffet restaurant and put it on a plate for you with a side of rice.  I've tried a variety of things on the menu and it tastes EERILY similar to what I had before when it was the buffet.

I only gaze at those things from a far when I'm at Central Market, so I was excited to try them out. The fish was cooked perfectly, and I'd recommend it to anyone. I'd love to try their salmon if I get another chance. \\n\\nThe downer was the dessert. My girlfirend's caramel flan was underwhelming. My chocolate mousse was good; however, similar to the pate, there was just too much. This isn't really a knock on Chez Nous, but after having dessert at other establishments, I expect more complexity to the dishes. In hindsight, I can appreciate the simplicity and elegance with the desserts (and all of the dishes in general), but I figure that French food may not be my thing..\\n\\nThe bread's fantastic, and the drink menu is affordable for what it is. The waitress gave us a great suggestion on a champagne. I expected the ambiance to be a little more romantic, but the dim lights and serenity of Chez Nous are a huge draw. \\n\\nOverall, we enjoyed Chez Nous. I'd definitely recommend coming out here, and I think it was a nice change of pace from the food scene we frequent.

After my sister (who works at Atelier Crenn, a 2 Michellin Star restaurant in San Francisco, recently featured in Netflix's Chef's Table) texted me one day, saying Frasca had gotten in touch with Atelier Crenn for whatever business purpose. She texted me to ask if I had heard of Frasca. So I figured, hey they might just be about the same level of fine (and delicious) dining, so I made  reservation for 2 months out.\\n\\nI was so excited about the visit. From making the reservation, to getting the confirmation calls and all that, the service was top notch--everything I would expect from a restaurant like this. However, the food was really not living up to the same level of expectation.\\n\\nIt has been a few weeks since our visit, so I don't remember exactly what we picked off of the pre-fixe. But I think we started with a half salumi platter outside of the pre-fixes, which was delicious. The pre-fixe menu items though, were an entirely different story. The issue that I remember the most was the pasta. Both my boyfriend and I picked pastas for that course, and I had the bigoli. The bigoli that came out was undercooked. It wasn't al dente to the point where I'd call it undercooked, it was straight up crunchy in the middle. So when we alerted the server to this issue, she said, \\"well they are cook to al dente, but we'll be happy to cook that some more for you!\\". I absolutely understand it is her job to take pride in the dishes they put out, but the fact that that bigoli was straight up crunchy in the middle, and her first reaction is to argue, left a bad taste in my mouth. \\n\\nI love Italian restaurants, and I pretty much never eat pastas at restaurants unless they're housemade. Since this place is supposed to be the best Italian place around Denver, I was really hoping to get amazing pasta. Sadly, I didn't. The secondi were also under seasoned, but that's just in our opinion. The cooks of the lamb and beef were amazing, but they just didn't have enough kick to the flavor, otherwise it could be so much more amazing!\\n\\nAll in all, I don't think we'll be back for their Quattro Piatti pre-fixe.

The food was outstanding.  The service was top-notch and incredibly friendly.  Drelyse is the sort of restaurant that makes strange and intimidating foods seem accessible.  \\n\\nWe started with the vitambua.  They're like sweet little rice pancakes.  They were great.  Very comforting.  I wanted to pour syrup on them and have them for breakfast, or honey and eat them as a dessert.\\n\\nNext up were the sambusas.  Another reviewed likened these to samosas, and I don't think that's very far off, but I don't think that does these justice either.  I found them to be much richer than a samosa.  They probably has something to do with it being stuffed with fatty ground beef.  \\n\\nFor entrees, everyone in the party ordered something different.  I had the jollof rice with chicken.  The rice was tasty.  It did remind me of dirty rice as another review mentioned.  The chicken was great: tender and juicy with a crispy skin.  Someone else had the red red: A black-eyed pea stew served with plaintains and chicken.  The plaintains were lightly fried, and were as good as any plaintains I've ever had.  The stew was rich and smoky and spicy.   The dinner that most impressed me, though, was the beef peanut butter stew with rice ball.  The stew was intensely flavorful and the meet (actually lamb in this case as they were out of beef) was tender.  When I want a spicy stew, this is what I want.  \\n\\nBe warned, though, there are two West African restaurants on Tamarack Circle.  The first time we tried to go, we ended up at the other one.  It was not Drelyse.  It was no where near as good.  Lisa -- the proprietor -- told us that happens a lot.

They toasted the tortillas so it had a nice delicate crunch, and whatever marinade they used, it was perfect.\\n\\nOnly \\"meh\\" factor is that one order of tacos and one burrito order came out to $12, so it isn't cheap, but you know what? mmmm-mmm--good."},{"name":"Boma - Flavors of Africa - Temporarily Unavailable","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I've got to say, by Disney standards, this place disappointed me. This was my first (and last) time eating here. We had reservations at 7:45 and were seated by 8:05. We then waited for 15 minutes in line at the buffet while incompetent people who refuse to read signs ask what every freaking item on the buffet is. These are English-speaking people. Also, the tables are so close together my husband had at least two butts rubbed on his arm by people trying to get by and squeeze in between our table and theirs. The worst part is no one apologizes. It's like a free for all without the common courtesy normally seen on Disney properties. \\n\\nMoving on. The food is just ok. There wasn't a single dish that made my eyes light up and my mouth dance for joy. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't fantastic either. \\n\\nI had a bowl of soup that I set down so I could put a few things on my plate. When I turned around it was gone. I looked at the food prep employee and told him my soup was gone. He looked at me like he didn't understand the words coming out of my mouth. \\n\\nLet me put it this way, if this place charged $20 per person, I would consider going back.

Delectable! \\nPacific gulf shrimp piri-piri with fingerling potatoes and an avocado aioli. This was good, but not my favorite of all the dishes we tried.\\nLast, but certainly not least, the pork belly and octopus with chorizo and white bean puree.

We loved our Monger's plate, but didn't feel the love from the Resident Cheese Expert - Fromagere? Cheese Wiz? - when we asked for a bit more guidance on our cheese selections.  We consider ourselves well-fed, well-traveled, and well-cheese plated, but she seemed irritated when we weren't familiar with her selections from France. Overall, it was a decent experience with a lively, funny server who managed to lighten the mood a bit.  However, you may want to brush up on your cheeses before visiting Henri's, or at least nod and pretend like you, too, are a cheese expert, as to not peeve the staff."},{"name":"Waypoint","address":"1030 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"First, let me preface this by saying that Alden and Harlow is my favorite restaurant in Boston. I was beyond excited to try their new spot, Waypoint. The space and ambiance is on point- great decor and an ideal noise level (lively, but never too loud). The hosts were very nice and did a great job welcoming us... Now the BUT.....\\n\\nWe sat at the bar and had to wait a solid 10 minutes before anyone spoke to us. When they poured the wine, it seems as if they are getting 8 glasses out of the bottle ( very light pour). We switched to a beer, and they serve it in a wine glass, so small serving again. The bartenders didn't really check in with us, we had to track them down for everything.\\n\\nThe food was pretty good. I highly recommend the crab dish- it was sweet, warm and perfect.  We ordered the pasta dish with octopus balls ( take on meatballs). It was definitely creative and took a few bites to get used to. \\n\\nOverall- the bar service can use some work. The food was good, but I guess I am holding the restaurant to an A&H standard where every dish is perfect and presented seamlessly and Waypoint is not quite there yet. If Yelp had half points, it would be 3.5 stars."},{"name":"Crema Cafe","address":"27 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Crema is right next to my work and everyone raves about it.

After walking around the shops of the Italy pavilion, we caught a glimpse of the pizza signs on their red awnings. As if on queue, our stomachs both loudly growled so we made a beeline in that direction.\\n\\nThey were fairly busy, but surprisingly said the wait would only be about 15 minutes. The indoor waiting area is small, but we crammed ourselves in anyway to avoid having to do so in the humid August air. \\n\\nIt wasn't long before we were led to a beautiful window table. If you've never been to Epcot before, a fun fact is that all the employees who work throughout the different pavilions are actually from there. Our server was from a small town in Italy, and had with him a girl he was training from Rome that had only been in the United States for 5 months. \\n\\nThey were both very sweet and helpful with giving us recommendations. When I ordered a glass of the house white wine he said, \\"No, no. You don't want that one. You want this one, much better. It's imported from the town next to where I'm from.\\" I can't remember which it was, but it was only a dollar more so I took his advice. It turned out to be a very nice glass of wine, so I was glad I did. \\n\\nHe also suggested that we share a large pizza, but I almost said no because I thought it would be too much food for just us two. Usually I could take the rest home, but I wasn't going to carry leftovers around the park with me the rest of the day. He told me to trust him so again I did, and boy was he right. I DARE you not to finish one of these bad boys the second it hits your table! It was absolutely delicious. \\n\\nThey are made in brick ovens, and have three at the restaurant which are all named after Italian volcanos (Stromboli, Vesuvio, and Etna). It makes the cheese come out extra bubbly, and gives the crust a smoky char. We ordered half Quattro formaggi (4 cheese) and half pepperoni, and we sure did eat that whole pie. We walked A LOT during that trip, don't judge. ;-) \\n\\nWe were too full to order dessert, but they noticed our 'celebrating an anniversary' pins so they brought us one anyways on the house. It tasted like a fluffy shortbread cookie drizzled in chocolate and strawberry sauces, then topped with whipped cream. We each got two bites of it which was the perfect size after a heavy meal. \\n\\nIt was by far the best pizza I've ever had in a Disney park, and probably anywhere else honestly.
