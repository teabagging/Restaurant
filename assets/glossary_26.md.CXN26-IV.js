We ordered 1 kids menu (5.99), a duo combo of 3 oz. angus beef and 3 oz. lamb with garlic aioli styled fries (10.77), one spanish beef with garlic aioli fries (11.77) and a strawberry milkshakes (3.99). We ordered all for take out. We got home and they only gave us one garlic aioli fries, so I had to drive back and get it. I got there and instead of getting me a new one, they gave me the fries that was supposed to be mine from earlier, so it has been sitting in their kitchen for at least 15 minutes, so it was soggy! My duo burgers, first of all because I had to go back to get the fries, my burgers were cold, the angus burger was just ok, it wasn't dry and had a little juice left in it and for the taste it wasn't anything special. The lamb one, very dry and needed some taste. My husband's spanish beef burger was also just ok and standard tasting. The garlic aioli fries, obviously mine was soggy, the garlic aioli has a tangy taste to it and it was too much covering all the layers of the fries. The strawberry milkshakes was good. For $35.25 plus I gave $5.29 tip, yes I know I could just not give anything but I was kinda feel bad and awkward for not giving any in front of the cashier and on the card machine the starting tip was 15%.

The $18 valet service was a bit steep, but we were late for our reservation and not being from the area I didn't want to deal with finding a spot. I got over my sticker shock quickly as I eyed the bourbon selection while walking past the bar to our table, and sopped a Four Roses private barrel selection pick. I asked the bartender to see the bottle, and was pleasantly surprised to see it was an OBSK recipe, one that you don't find even in the most specialized liquor stores that do private barrel picks. And priced at $15 for a 2oz neat pour, a relative bargain for a rare barrel strength single barrel bottling, I knew I would be drinking good that night!There service here is pretty spectacular, and our server came by our table over a dozen times and looking around, they have an army of staff to make sure their patrons are well taken care of. The d√©cor is very aesthetically pleasing as well, with high ceilings in a modern, industrial nautical setting. The giant wall of oyster shells assembled in a very artistic manner is a nice touch. My dining partners weren't raw oyster fans, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity and ordered a bunch of raw oysters to start. When in Rome, right?! They brought out a basket of 6 different hot sauces, half of which were artisanal small batch hot sauces that you won't find in any supermarket. I think one was a fermented hot sauce like the Korean chili paste gochujang. For someone like myself who likes to layer on as much flavor complexities as possible, this wide array of hot sauces was a big hit for me. The oysters themselves were incredibly fresh and tasted like they were pulled from the ocean hours prior. Clean, refreshing, and wonderfully delicious. My wife started with the clam chowder, which came with buttermilk biscuits and house-cured bacon. Not your traditional NE chowda, but think rich and luscious and overall a great spin on an American classic.The entrees were also incredibly delicious and very well executed. My wife ventured into the land of foodie unknown by ordering the Lobster Roe Noodles, which basically is some fresh made pasta with lobster roe mixed in. It came with big pieces of fresh, perfectly cooked grilled lobster, braised short rib, oyster mushrooms, and pecorino cheese. Yep, it tasted as good as it sounds and scratched her lobster itch. I went with the Maryland Stiped Bass which came over some Romanesco cauliflower, green apple, and braised fennel. I wish I took a pic of this beautifully plated dish before I devoured the whole thing, because it was a real work of food porn art. The skin was left on and crisped perfectly. All the flavors and textures here worked so well, from the crunchy savory skin to the moist flavorful bass flesh to the sweetness of the green apple cutting the rich sauce. Really one of the better seafood dishes I've had in recent memory. We capped off this excellent meal with some fantastic desserts. The Boston Cream Doughnuts were in little round munchkin balls covered in granulated sugar and filled with vanilla custard and a side of chocolate dip. Such a great light dessert option.  We also shared the Chocolate Crunch Bar, which was perfectly described by our server as in-between a traditional chocolate bar and cake, which came with hazelnuts and blood orange sorbet. A great dessert for those chocolate lovers out there.I originally gave this place a 4-star review, but upon writing this review and reflecting upon the meal and experience, I have to upgrade this to a 5-start initial experience. I had high expectations going in based on the Yelper praise and once I got over the sky-high valet price, every aspect of this dining experience met or exceeded my expectations.

It's very pretty inside. There are soft lights, simple decor.We started off with the Crab Rangoons. They were really good - perfectly crisp on the outside, flavorful on the inside.My husband had the chicken and shrimp satay dish, and he really liked it. He said the chicken and shrimp were really flavorful. Neither of us cared for the rice macaroni, though -- basic rice pasta shaped like penne, and it had little flavor.I had the Vietnamese chicken curry and it was delicious! The spice was just perfect, and it didn't compete with the flavor of the curry. The chicken was fork-cutting tender, and the dish was loaded with both chicken and potatoes. Dessert: Banana nutella crepe. HUGE. It comes with about a gallon of ice cream! We also had the banana spring rolls with ice cream, and no complaints there. I'm not even a huge coconut fan but I loved those things! They hardly had time to prepare for my white fangs of death. May they rest in peace.Service was fantastic, too. Aside from the waiter pushing drinks on us, and then bringing a pitcher of sangria (also perfect!) for my friend and I when we only wanted a glass, he was attentive and kind and professional.

I don't like most of the standard \\"favorites\\" in town.  I think County Line is overrated, and while the Salt Lick is a fun experience, I also think the meat itself is overrated.  For me, barbecue is all about the MEAT.  That's it.  The meat.  OK, and maybe the friendly service.  I like to enjoy where I'm going, and who I'm giving my business to.  Franklin rocks on all accounts.  On my first visit I hadn't checked hours and got there right around closing time.  Aaron, the proprietor, told me the bad news was they were just about out of meat, but the good news was that I could have what they had left for free.  Seriously?  He said \\"is that ok?\\"  I had to laugh.  Uh, yeah.  I'll take the free meat.  He warned me that it would be drier than normal since it had been out all day, and to come back earlier next time for the real thing.  Well, that first taste was great.  And when we went back for the \\"real deal,\\" we were impressed beyond belief.  I'm going to just go ahead and say it.Best. Brisket. In. Austin.  Bar none.  The meat is so juicy and flavorful, that even the lean meat is rich and juicy, I don't have to ask for \\"super-extra-moist.\\"  We order some of each and I mix them together.  So, so good.  The rub is delicious, and you'll always get a little edge piece to try if you ask for it or just look starving.  Heck, Aaron even made me up a care package for my dogs consisting of the dried out bits not quite fit for human consumption.  The barbecue sauces are interesting, and I love the espresso and the sweet sauce.  Not mixed, just go back and forth.  He even has ghiradelli squares out for a little dessert.  Speaking of dessert, the bourbon banana pudding is crazy good.  Really.  Try it even if you're not a banana pudding fan.  It's fabbo.  Have to also mention the sausage - I'm not sure if it's homemade or imported, but it's really delicious.  Juicy and tasty.  The potato salad is mustardy, so if you like mustard, you'll like it (I did).  I'm told the 'slaw is the non-sweet kind (I like sweet, but my companions really liked it).Beyond that, the atmosphere, for a little trailer in a parking lot, is surprisingly good.  The patrons are always happy and friendly (nothing like the aroma of good barbecue to put you in a good mood), and even my nosy dogs are always welcome.  The proprietors are friendly and I feel like I always get a little something extra.  Today we mentioned we've never gotten there when the ribs are available, So Aaron pulled his own lunch off the smoker (leftover ribs from yesterday) and gave us two of them.  Generous, friendly, good people.  I can't imagine we won't be going here once a week . . . forever.  And good news on the hours - when it gets warmer, we're assured the hours will get longer.  Dangerous.  This could mean a mid-week fix too.  I could keep gushing, but you get the idea.  Best brisket in town, friendly service, lots of fresh air and even kitchy flamingos.  Go.  Now.  What are you waiting for?  And while you're there, check out Owl Tree Roasters - we've never made it while they're open, but I hear they're terrific.  I feel bad for the folks that live on the street behind it.  The smell of smoked meats and roasted coffees every day?  I'd go insane (and broke)."},{"name":"Mo's Pizza","address":"3109 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"My wife and I went here with our family tonight and it was a great little spot. It is located just off of highway 85 and Clairmont. When we arrived, it definitely had a \\"local neighborhood joint\\" feel to it. There is plenty of parking and easy to get in and out of. We pulled right into a spot in close proximity to the front door.When we walked inside we were greeted by the lovely staff behind the counter where you order. The menu is located on the first wall on your right when you come in the door. It is a decent size menu with plenty of options. You can build your own pizza, choose a specialty pie, sandwich, salad, or special of the day. We ordered two 14 inch pizzas and a Greek salad that was big enough to feed 4 people, and some cold beers. The first pizza we ordered was a Margherita pizza and we added chicken. The pizza was good but I thought could have been better with sun dried tomatoes instead of vine ripe tomatoes. The crust was delicious, light and crisp. The second pizza was just a pepperoni and sausage pizza. The sausage had a good, bold flavor and gave the pizza some character. Mo's has about 6 beers on tap and more beers in bottles and cans. I am always a fan of a place that serves PBR in a can. They also serve red and white wine.Mo's is a casual place and good for the whole family.

Their lunch specials include an entree and 2 sides so we decided on the chicken pie with rice pilaf and butternut squash (around $10.50) and the spinach pie with green beans and grilled mixed vegetables plus a cup of the chicken and lemon soup (around $13.50).  It's cafeteria style so you wait as they prepare your plate and pay at the end of the line.  We did notice some orders being delivered to tables if the food was not readily available.The two pies were excellent!  Ample, flavorful spinach in a light fluffy filo dough. The chicken pie was filled with a generous amount of tender chicken and vegetables along with a light, fluffy filo dough.  The rice pilaf was plain but tasty, the butternut squash was cooked perfectly.  The mixed grilled vegetables (tomato, onions, green peppers, summer squash) were also perfectly cooked and seasoned.

He gave the man his hat and we went inside. Once we were leaving we stopped by to grab the hat to find out it was not there. They had given the hat to someone else/ lost it. When my fianc√© said that was about a $45 hat. The manager, Victor Jones very snarky asked if he could see an invoice for the hat! Who keeps a receipt for a ball cap which you have had for 2 years?!?! The manager was extremely rude and disrespectful when my fianc√© was just trying to tell him the meaning behind the hat. The whole situation was ridiculous when the manager should have had some customer service and be respectful to paying customers. Mostly when their \\"hat check\\" is faulty to begin with because they have no structure or organization to it. At the end of the day it is just a hat that can be replaced but the customer service about it was the worst I have seen mostly from a manager.

And you get cornbread, butter, and beans if you want them. :)The wings at Village Smokehouse are very large, and an order or order an a half (10-15) wings fills me up, where I can eat up to 20 of the smaller wings from Wings Over Somerville. Village Smokehouse is also better than Red Bones for wings, and some other items.... I used to love Red Bones, but they are losing their edge as to quality and has gotten pricey for what they serve. Most things seem to be overcooked and dry, where before Red Bones was great at making juicy meats and chicken.

After sitting at the bar for a few minutes people were being seated where we were told we could not sit soon a hostess informed us we could now sit at the dining area. Once seated our server came along who was not helpful at all, she did not want to inform us of the specials and when asked about a certain dish she informed us she hat is was only seasoned with salt and pepper ( the chicken) which was not the case but the chicken was very good kudos to the chef. We then had left overs and we asked for extra jus not 1, 2, 3, but 4 times from 4 different people including our server and we received nothing from anyone what even makes it worse was 2 of the hostess we asked at the front acted like OMG what happened when I made it a point to let them know our request was not fulfilled.

Luckily we just beat the rush and were able to nab one of the last two tables outside before additional groups came by. Given that alone I would recommend making a reservation ahead of time or come during non-peak hours if you want to try. The place itself is really small after walking in so you are fairly close to other folks. Sitting outside we had more space, but it was dimly lit and no heat lamps were available at our tables which were more to the left of the restaurant and not under the umbrellas. Tables are still small though so you can't really fit anything else but your two entrees. They serve you some bread once you're seated. I liked the chew of the bread with the olive oil/balsamic vinegar dip. | WHAT WE GOT | + Pesto Penne: The pasta was cooked well, but nothing too out of this world. If you're going for simple yet flavorful this is a good option to try. Not sure if you can pay more to add some protein if you want it to be more savory. +  La Burina - Rigatone pasta with sausage, peas, mushrooms in a cream sauce: I loved the rigatone pasta but it was a couple mins overcooked :\\\\ sausage was good but could have been a little more flavorful to offset the mushrooms/peas.Overall, food is fairly quick to get to your table once you order but both dishes weren't that out of this world that would make me come back just to have them again. I may be biased since I had some amazing pasta the same week so it might not be a fair comparison. Service is quick to clean up the tables and is friendly, but it so packed that they're also a bit hands off at the same time.

If your a seafood junkie like myself then this is the perfect place to satisfy your seafood fix without emptying your pockets. So that's right up my alley.  The crab legs were really good and the green muscle was good. I didn't really care for the fried calamari, however, the fried shrimp (extra lemon) was good... 2. The customer service was excellent!!! MARGIE was so excellent, always at out table and offering her services. Staff was all friendly... MARGIE made our visit special, just one more positive to our vacation! Thanks MARGIE! 3. The staff always made sure the food was full and that their customers were satisfied. Food was hot, and my cup of Pepsi was never empty.

Cesar Chavez and Chicon. An old house that has been renovated into a lovely inside/outside cocktail bar. It's been open about 2 years now. We walked in looking for cocktail menus, but were told that we could sit anywhere and we would have table service. Outside seating was our goal on an unbelievably pleasant evening in the middle of May. BTW, I'm still half expecting to sweat my ass off in the evenings but I'm still proven wrong, thankfully. The inside bar and swanky booths are impressive and great for larger groups if you can snag one. A large party had just left so we had no choice but to take a large area to sit at. The outside seating is old, seemingly vintage patio furniture, with white lights strung up from above. Our server seemed to be the only one taking on all the patrons seated outside, therefore service was quite slow. We waited about 20 minutes for our drinks. The cocktail menu was unique and I went with the London Calling. He ordered a drink that sounded manly, but came in a girly glass. He liked his drink a lot, but for $12-$13 for a tiny drink, it felt like we weren't in Austin at all, but actually NY. Hey, Weather Up, did you forget you are a short walk from the projects on Chicon and not in Manhattan? My drink was so-so. Neither of our drinks were strong. I'm a little confused at the price of drinks, this isn't Peche. We're sitting outside on the corner of Chicon and Tejano alley receiving slow service on old dirty patio furniture and drinks that should be half the price they are. If you're not hung up on overpriced drinks that won't get you a buzz, then this is a great place to take a date. I'd say, even for a first date place this would be suitable. They have their own (free) parking lot and table service with unique cocktails. I do appreciate that they did not cram in seating in every open space on the patio, leaving each group of people to still have some privacy from others nearby,Things to remember: They cannot stay open later than midnight, except on Saturdays they are open until 1AM.

I have mixed emotions about it.The first time I went, I think I got a sausage piada. It was . . . nowhere near as flavorful as I expected it to be, especially considering that there was sausage on it. Plus, I found out that if you put on cold ingredients (like the eggplant mix) and then make the 5 minute drive home, your piada goes stone-cold in the meanwhile. I also had the cannoli chips, which didn't do much for me--very bland.However, the idea of Piada had gotten into my head, so I went back. I got a chicken piada and the spinach artichoke dip. The piada fared a little better since I tried to stay away from the cold ingredients, although I think they could have put on a little more pasta--pasta is basically the cheapest ingredient ever, but I didn't feel like there was much in the piada. The dip became a congealed, but still relatively tasty, mess by the time I got home. So, I don't love it. On the other hand, I probably will go back when an Italian-food craving strikes me, because my corner of Columbus is a bit lacking in inexpensive Italian food that isn't heavily pizza-centric.

It took about 15 minutes to get the drink. When he came back, we had had time to look over the food menu too and decided to share a tuna and poke bowl. The bowl was pretty good, everything was fresh, but something was lacking. When we were done, we realized that happy hour was starting, so the server said we could move inside (I think he was happy to be done with us). Inside, we ordered more shrimp (since we loved them so much), oysters, tuna tacos, and wings. The shrimp was way smaller when not having the tasting and somehow wasn't as good.

I'm not sure if our laap meuang was just pork belly or if it had other parts in there too. The sticky rice we ordered alongside our food was extra (I think rice should be included in every meal) and each one was around $3. Our total came out close to $70 which we were not expecting.

Actually, they were beyond delicious! Must get! We also had the crab cake and buttermilk biscuit. Both of these items were totally mouth watering.

I said \\"good sushi\\" not the best sushi you've ever had in your life and not pre packaged questionable convenience sushi either.  We are talking the type of sushi that you will enjoy and not be worrying if you will later get food poisoning.       For starters, parking is easy (and free)!  They are in the same lot as Vine and Tap and Roasters.  Once you walk in, there is a sushi bar and several sections of tables.  One thing that I love is that they let you split an order of their fried rice and don't do any type of up charge and bring it out on two plates.  So basically you can get an appetizer portion or fried rice for under $2 a person.  They also have never charged me for yum yum sauce or any additional sauces which is nice.

We ordered the fried tofu, a veggie roll and a bowl of pork ramen, along with a glass of red wine for me. (I know, wine at a Japanese restaurant? In my defense, the happy hour sake was described as \\"dry\\" and I was eating pork and noodles. The wine was good. Judge me, I dare you.)The tofu was delicious, chewy on the outside as it was lightly fried but served in a thin broth with scallions, and perfectly melt-on-your-tongue tender on the inside. The veggie roll was fine - not much to write home about. The ramen was satisfactory, but light on the ingredients for $9.50 - one lonely slice of pork (although perfectly tender) and some seaweed, ginger and scallions. I would've liked an egg or some bamboo shoots... still, the broth was cloudy meaty goodness and the noodles tasted fresh. It wasn't the best ramen I'd ever had, but it hit the spot.The total bill, with tip, came to $25 and we walked away full and satisfied.

The corn was okay, but a bit pasty for my liking. The slaw was good. Not to mayonnaisy. The potatoes were average. Red potatoes with butter. I'd get potato salad next time.

I didn't think it could get any better, but the staff and Chef titillated my eyes and mouth to new depths throughout the evening with each amazing dish being offered one after the other. All so innovative, well executed, and stunning. Began with a sweet and delicate hotate with yuzu zest, choyu, micro cilantro, and ikura. The perfect start to what became a 12-course tasting menu, ending with lightly seared 85 Wagyu (the best!), crispy scallion, garnished with edible gold flakes. Heavenly. Just what I would expect from Soto. And nobody would have known this was the very first service ever. Soto - South Lamar ran like a well rehearsed orchestra with Chef Andy as a hands on conductor. Bravo!  This is just a preview of things to come of course. Some of the items pictured might or might not make the menu and desserts are in progress. Officially opening is on Oct 27 @5pm. Currently dinner only Tuesdays through Saturdays. Reservations are highly recommended and can be made by phone or through Open Table. What are you waiting for?"},{"name":"Tonno Wakefield","address":"175 North Ave","city":"Wakefield","stars":"4","text":"I went to Tonno for the first time last night with a group of friends for dinner and drinks.

She was attentive, personable, and made us feel like we were her only (and favorite) table all night. She gave us her honest opinions and steered us all in the right direction for food and drink options the whole night.

The place was actually decently crowded but we were able to be sat right away at the last open table.For our meal, we decided to split the green curry and the spicy basil chicken. The green curry was decent, but not spicy enough for my liking. It did have pretty good flavor, though I wish there was more bamboo in it.The spicy basil chicken was also very good, and definitely packed a little more spiciness. Both dishes were a decent size and we took the leftovers home and had enough for one more meal.Overall, the food here is good, the service is fast and friendly and the atmosphere is intimate. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the mood for Thai."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Wow this is the biggest book store I've been in.

Cheap food -- a Korean run southern food buffet. Don't expect Bones or Chops for starters. The fried chicken is pretty good. You can't go wrong with that.

John Boys on 78 is more successful in this cheap southern buffet concept, but this place is decent when you need a chicken fix. Servers are usually pleasant. Tea good, strong, and sweet.

I'm not sure how long it has been open for, officially, but it's definitely still working out the kinks. The signs outside advertise veggie burgers but unfortunately, they didn't have any veggie burgers. The host/cashier/bartender checked in the back and informed us they did have falafel burgers available, but only as the slider options (not a full burger). My fianc√©e decided that was fine with her (she's a vegetarian), so we decided to sit at the bar while we placed our order to-go. While we were trying to figure out our order, the host/cashier/bartender had to keep going in the back to ask questions -- it seemed like they were honestly out of *everything.*The bar is a little bit rinkydink but they had red wine and they had jack & Coke, so we were happy enough. We sat to wait and watched, cringing, while more people walked in and tried to order, only to be informed they were out of whatever it was they wanted.Once our to-go order was in, we received our food quite fast. We actually didn't have time to finish our drinks, which is kind of rare for the Midtown area. We asked to close out and it took a couple minutes for the host/cashier/bartender to get to us because a family was trying to get a beverage from the Coke machine, which was out of a lot of selections.Once we closed out, we were a bit surprised that our total came to $44. We had two meals + two drinks, so that felt pretty high, but whatever, we paid.The interior of the place is stark, perhaps they're going for an \\"industrial\\" vibe? The exposed ceilings are kind of cool but the actual decor is quite bare, almost plain. It wasn't busy the whole time we were here, and they even had outlets available for charging up devices. I could see this being a good place to hang out and get some work done because it's not too loud and there's ample seating and outlets. AND NOW FOR THE IMPORTANT PART: THE FOOD.\\n- Fries: Frickin' delicious! They're little circular potatoes fried up. Unique looking, same french fry taste.\\n- Onion Rings: Classic, crumbly onion rings. Very good. Only three or four in the half and half (fry/onion ring combo) but I found myself wanting more fries anyway.\\n- Burgers: SO GOOD. The food is honestly 100% what bumped the rating up from 3 stars to 4. I got the Spanish Beef burger with no jalape√±os, sub avocado, and I wish I had 100 more. The potato bun is excellent, the meat is superb, my order was 100% correct.\\n- Falafel Sliders: Very good vegetarian option! My fianc√©e was very pleased. Her only complaint was that it wasn't available as the big burger when we were there, only in slider form. NOTE: the sliders are apparently made as the \\"classic version\\" (lettuce, onion, tomato, pickle) so if you want the big burger version on the sliders, you need to specify that upfront.TLDR: the food makes up for the atmosphere and clusterfudge of working the kinks out."},{"name":"Torchys Tacos","address":"166 Hargraves Dr, Ste J-100","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"how slow can you get!! ordered 2 tacos i ha e been wairing for over a half hour wtf. employees look lost its not busy come on people come on!!!"},{"name":"Suzette Creperie","address":"3342 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm amazed that there are gluten free crepe options and they are tasty!

It isn't a great place to bring huge groups since it is small but we had four people so everything worked out. The service here is pretty great and everyone is super friendly and the food comes out quickly and my friends and I def enjoyed our time here. However, I do think that this place was overhyped for me and I felt like the food was a bit disappointing - the food was tasty but I guess I expected more. -Nutella French Toast: My friend got this and it was absolutely amazing, hands down the best dish out of all the one ordered. It was so tasty and flavorful. I def. wish I got her order instead when I tried some of the french toast. \\n-Lobster & Avocado Omelet: My other friend ordered this and she did not like it very much. She thought it was pretty tasteless and did not have much flavor and after trying some of hers I def agree with her. The eggs just tasted like regular eggs and the flavor of the lobster and avocado did not really show through. \\n-Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon with Spinach and Tomato: This was my dish and the eggs benedict was pretty good but nothing amazing but the salmon (MY GOD THE SALMON) was soooo salty. Everything else was not really that flavorful expect for the salmon. \\n-\\"Everything But The Kitchen Sink\\" Sampler: My other friend got this one and once again it was pretty lacking in flavor and just wasn't amazing.

It is more upscale than a typical Vietnamese restaurant and the menu is also priced considerably higher to go along with it. We had the banh xeo and the pork chop rice. The banh xeo is a Vietnamese crepe and it was nice and crispy. I would come back here just for that dish if it weren't so overpriced. The rice dish was fine but nothing that really stands out about it. Nice place for folks that aren't familiar with Vietnamese food to try out some of the menu items.

We ate here for both breakfast and dinner. I would rate the breakfast buffet as a 4 but dinner as a 2, so 3 star average overall. First of all, the ultimate hot continental breakfast buffet option is outstanding. Wide variety of fresh fruits, bagels, yogurt, etc plus many hot items including a customized omelet bar, assorted meats, potatoes, etc. All of a good quality, not just your average run of the mill continental breakfast status. The service at breakfast was just okay, we had 2 different servers each day and 1 was more attentive than the other. If you have the option to add breakfast for 2 for $20 when booking online, be sure to do so. Otherwise it's 24 each if you pay after eating. As far as dinner goes both my mom and I were underwhelmed. We looked at the menu online before coming in, yet the menu in the restaurant was different than the one online and they didn't have what I was planning to order. I finally settled on the caprese salad and 5 mac n cheese as a meal. My mom got the catch of the day with asparagus on the side. My salad and mac were both good but very overpriced for what they were. Mom's meal was good, but the fish portion was very small and only got 2 small asparagus spears. Again, very overpriced and not worth the money. Even though we asked the server to put a rush order on our meal, it still took forever (even at 9 PM in a fairly dead restaurant). Good thing they brought out bread that we requested when we ordered or I would have been seriously hangry!! Final verdict: go for breakfast if you're staying in the hotel, but for lunch or dinner look elsewhere."},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"1100 Northside Dr NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Management needs to figure this one out. I understand that it's a super busy location and employees are instructed to keep things as orderly as possible, but this is infuriating. Getting fast food should not be this difficult, with employees yelling at you to do different things. Just now I was told by an employee to switch into the other lane, and then as I did another car came right up behind me an almost hit me. Meanwhile, another employee was yelling at me to not go in that lane, contradicting the one that told me to. I also ended up not following the car they originally tell you to follow, which just makes the whole system fail anyways. I wouldn't go to this location, but work right by there and frequent it with my coworkers during our lunch break.These employees don't get paid enough.

I used to come here every week after a lab because it was a good way for me to de stress/treat myself after a gruelling day of work. Their cookies are especially soft and chewy and you can bet that they don't skimp on the chocolate! My favourite is their marbellous cookies which is a dark chocolate cookie with a huge chunk of white chocolate that's perfectly oozy and melted in the middle. They also have chocolate chunk, java nut, smarties, vegan cookies that are also really good. I also enjoy their bagels in the morning; they have a gigantic selection of which I normally have a sundried tomato bagel with classic cream cheese. Price wise everything is reasonable with a cookie coming in at 2.50.

I was disturbed by the fact that he simply refused to believe he had any problem of any sort.  It was not a short conversation, and when I asked him about the complaints below, his only response was \\"I can't comment on online reviews.\\"  The simple fact is that there are other overpriced steakhouses in Columbus where I can drop $90 on a piece of meat I could by for $10, and $15 for a salad with a dollar's worth of ingredients.  If those other steakhouses have four and a half stars and Mitchell's had three and a half, there's a reason.  By definition, that reason is the management.  Every restaurant has issues every day, and instead of being up front and treating me like an adult and a repeat customer, Scott gave me the party line. Ah, well.  I'll give the place a try (with two people instead of a large group) and follow up.  I will say this:  if places like this, and Hyde Park and Ruby's, think they can provide anything but exceptional food and service and still survive in the era of home delivery and online reviews, they're kidding themselves.  The cost of food and wine at any of those places would feed the average person for a month.

Place is in a new building just constructed on Washington street and the location is a bit hard to maneuver if you are coming out of the mall or down Washington since no u turns are allowed for about 2 miles. This is not a sit down place but you can take out and even order from the website and call ahead for dinners. It is quite refreshing to have a healthy place to eat in the midst of KFC and fast food and terrible UNO's and other chain restaurants not worth mentioning. The staff here is so friendly and welcoming and they walked us through the menu and selections and even gave us some sorbet to try while we waited. The concept is cool, farm to table food, prepared per order and you can take it home and heat it up and it is ready to go. The quality is amazing and it tastes home made. The good news is it is natural and healthy and you can eat it and feel good about the choice. They even have kids selections and some pretty creative ones which actually got my kids to eat vegetables for once. Lobster mac and cheese was delicious and the bolognese was equally as good. Kids selection were okay, chicken finger was a bit tough however carrots and potatoes were nice and the creamy parmesan shells with apple meatballs my kids loved. There is plenty of food to go around, prices were okay, a bit high but it was worth it plus you get about two days worth of food from one order so it equals out. They even have desserts like ice cream and cookies plus the owner told us about cooking classes they offer for adults and children. This is a neat place and one I will definitely try again. Just be aware of the location, plan accordingly since there is a bit of maneuvering to ensure you make the correct turns.

You see how every table is packed?\\" LMAO, ok. Truth be told, I always need to brace myself if I see old school asian servers at traditional Chinese restaurants. They are blunt and very concise with their words and gestures. Hospitality is not a norm, but a luxury. I can't help but laugh at some of the servers here because I find their rudeness endearing at times. Of course I have to be in the mood to deal with their service, so visits here are occasional.   On the occasions I do come here though and actually get a table, then the dim sum is so worth it!Golden lotus serves dim sum fresh-to-order. That means no moving carts and haphazard ordering. Instead, you go through their list of offerings and carefully decide which items you want to devour in advance. On my latest visit, I was able to bypass the IDK lady and grab a table. SCORE! We ordered a bowl of beef stew soup with egg noodles, xiu mai(pork), ha cao(shrimp), tripe, sesame balls, & rice paste noodles with beef. For those that have never tried, then let me attempt to explain: \\nBeef stew soup with egg noodles- A beef broth based soup with spices, beef chunks, tendons, and thin egg noodles. Their stew is served with some baby bok chow to help cut all the richness.  Xiu Mai- Cute lil pork & shrimp dumplins wrapped in wonton wrappers. Definitely one of the more popular dim sum dishes. Ha Cao- Shrimp filling enveloped in a rice paste dough. This is always a mainstay dish that everyone orders every single time. Tripe- Yep, that weird taco filling option at Mexican restaurants that people are afraid to order is available for breakfast during dim sum! Their dim sum is made with ginger and scallions in a some type of broth.  Rice paste noodles with beef - Delicate soft wide-rice noodles wrapped around beef. These noodles come doused in a sweet soy sauce. Sesame balls- A dessert that my bf likes to save for the very end. These sweet treats are so dense that you need to save them for last because if not, then you just screwed your appetite over. It's like a K-O for your hunger strikes. So, remember how I said Ha Cao is like a mainstay dish and to order them every single time you go for dim sum? Well, we ordered that dish and never got our order. Since we got so many things it really wasn't a big deal. Once we got our check however; we were still charged for that order of dumplings that we never received. Oh these tricky minxes! Golden Lotus is like a family Thanksgiving dinner with annoying relatives; you go for the food and just laugh at drunk Uncle Sal's antics.

From its perfectly seasoned, 1.5 inch thick beef patty to it's secret Swedish sauce -- it leaves no room for complaint. I'm practically salivating at the thought of it. Let's dissect the burger from top to bottom:The Bun: Perfectly toasted -- soft on the inside, but satisfyingly crunchy when you bite in. A little crumbly, but holds it shape well against the juices of the burger.The Beef: Seasoned with Swedish spices and made with lean ground beef, this hunk of meat is unbelievably juicy and delicious. Doesn't fall apart when you bite into it and is topped with airy fried onions that compliment the texture and flavor of the burger perfectly.The Sauce: Whatever's in it, it works. This sauce adds that kick of flavor that makes this burger memorable. A little spicy, a little savory -- this sauces turns a great burger into an unforgettable burger.

Their other foods are probably worth getting - seems many folks here prefer the ramen - but this sushi wasn't very flavorful for a place on Salmon Street. Might be better for the people who enjoy happy hour.This was a recommendation from our Airbnb host, which was extremely kind of them. However, having lived in Japan and San Francisco, where there is all sorts of amazing sushi places to choose from, this place didn't stack up. There was also something really eerie about being one of the only Asians in the entire establishment (or for miles around, it seemed), except for one or two of the employees, but that's what happens when you go outside of the cultural bubble that is San Francisco. Bottom line: if you've ever lived or traveled to a place that has good Japanese food, don't expect your tastebuds to come alive here.The decor is interesting - like an art student's project after having surfed the internet for pictures of Japan. It's clean and well-done, anyway. The two halves of the restaurant are so different that it's like being in two different places all together. The left side is where the happy hour occurs. A friend of ours ordered a hot tea as his \\"drink\\" for the happy hour and somehow was able to still order off of that menu, which was not a bad idea. Boyfriend and I ordered a couple of rolls and a temaki between us, and despite the rolls sounding good, they were some of the blandest ones I've ever had. For the price, it was definitely not worth it.While it's interesting to see other states' versions of Asian food, it doesn't really make too much sense when you know you've tasted better back home.

Slappy Cakes will definitely provide that!My friend and I came here after I spotted a picture I saw on Instagram tagging this place. We went on a Wednesday morning and we were able to get seats right away. What's fun about Slappy Cakes is that you get to cook your pancakes right in front of you. If your Facebook hasn't been plagued with pancake art videos, I suggest looking them up on YouTube so you get some ideas on fun pancake art. Some of our pancake art included cats, Homer Simpson, stars and sea turtles.Anyways, Slappy Cakes offers a variety of pancake batters in squeeze bottles: buttermilk, whole wheat, gluten free, gingerbread, chocolate and a special (it was red velvet when we were there). It seems like the gingerbread is really popular as it was completely out during our visit. We ended up going with the buttermilk since its a lot more versatile than other batters, such as red velvet.In addition to the batters, there are a variety of sweet and savory toppings to order for your pancake creations. We decided to try two from each category: blueberries, lemon curd, mushrooms and goat cheese. The savory toppings won me over, which I'll stick to when I come back here. The lemon curd and blueberries are great toppings as well.My friend and I also supplemented our pancakes with a side of chicken fried bacon (so decadent!) and a plate of eggs, biscuits, potatoes and bacon. I recommend splitting a plate just to add a variety to your meal.A lot of people recommend this place for families but I can see myself bringing friends here for future Portland visits."},{"name":"Barlow","address":"737 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This review is purely about Barlow's amazing Old Fashions!

We arrived right when the place opened and were seated immediately. The inside of the restaurant is not suited for large groups and we were ushered outside. The options for seating outside looked grim. A few large picnic tables were open but they were directly in the sun with some sad broken umbrellas on them. We told the hostess we cant sit in the sun in the summer, we are gonna bake. She told us to \\"feel free to adjust the umbrella as much as we want\\". WTF im not here to fix your patio furniture, it doesnt need adjustment, it needs to be replaced. I would have walked out that minute but I was with 6 friends who wanted to stay. We sit and manage to get some waters and menus. They must be rationing ice over there because the water was lukewarm with a couple of melted ice cubes in it. There was very little air flow on the patio but we managed to stay somewhat in the shade and cool. A couple of fans would really make it more comfortable. We order food and one of my friends asks for the tea menu. The waiter hands it over but says \\"our coffee maker is brewing coffee and cant make hot water at the same time so it will be a while for tea\\" Get off your ass and go buy a electric tea pot for your restaurant. We now begin the next portion of the meal id like to dedicate to waiting. We waited over an hour for food. We literally were among the first people in the door when they opened. The restaurant was maybe half full when we ordered. What were they doing back there growing soybeans?? After an hour in the heat drinking lukewarm water siting on a wood bench with no back we were rather cranky. We get our food finally and all eat so quickly I forgot to even taste it. Maybe thats the trick to owning a restaurant these days. The food was edible but not memorable. By the way this is when the tea arrives. They weren't kidding about a \\"while\\". We were done and ready to go but our waiter disappeared. Maybe to work for another place or go home and feed his cat. We didnt see him for a long time. We basically got up and just went to the counter to pay. I kept thinking they would want us to leave to free up the table. However, to no ones surprise they did not have a line at the door.

I'm rating this place 4 stars, assuming our experience wasn't the norm, that perhaps they were having an off day. Let me explain:I did not want to cook on Thanksgiving. My kid just got discharged from Children's Hospital after a fairly lengthy stay (very sudden and scary health scare), and our family was just emotionally drained. This was to be our first Thanksgiving here in Van city (recently moved here from the States) and this Greek restaurant got such good reviews, and is so nearby, and looked so cute whenever we passed it (the cutest patio! Great canopy of lights! Toasty heaters!), we decided, this is the place!Made reservations in advance on Open Table (love that! So convenient!).Was seated promptly at a table in the back . The place was hopping. Our server was a lovely girl: super sweet, very personable. She noted that the dishes come out \\"tapas style, as soon as they're cooked\\", so we were prepared for our plates not to come out all at the same time. That's okay with us, as long as we get to dine together. I assumed we'd all be eating our meals together. (Was this an erroneous assumption on my part?).We ordered the mussels as an appetizer. My kid and I decided to share the souvlaki platter. And my husband ordered the roast chicken. The mussels came out promptly and were delicious, served with accompanying warm pita wedges to dip in the marinade. So good!Shortly thereafter, my kid's and my souvlaki platter came out. It was plated nicely, in a roasting pan, and had 4 skewers of our chosen meats and shrimp, with a lot of fragrant rice and roasted veggies and roasted potatoes. I cannot tell you how beautiful this platter was or how delicious it was. Every component was fantastic. SOOOOO good. the platter came with a tiny metal tub of tzatziki. For so much food, one really needs more (and it was really good, too!), so I asked for some more. My kid, fresh out of the hospital, eats slowly. As do I (I had bariatric surgery a while back and can't eat much, or fast). So the kid and I are plugging away at our platter of food while my husband watches us eat. We offer him some of our food, which he reluctantly takes after a while. The kid and I are nearly done with our meal after 25 minutes or so when we flagged down the server, asking when my husband's chicken would be out. She seemed surprised but said she'd check on it. She returned to say it would be out in \\"one minute\\".My kid and I were done with our meal. Totally stuffed. Hubby started picking at our remaining food.Ten minutes later, the server returned with hubby's dish. I gotta say, it too was beautifully plated: in a roasting pan, a half roasted chicken with rice and potatoes and veggies. Very pretty. And husband said it was delicious (he was only able to have 1/4 of it, as he had been picking at our meal for the past 35 minutes). My kid and I watched him eat, as we were long done with our meal.Funny thing is, literally three minutes after my husband got his meal, another server came to our table with a roast chicken meal and started to put it down on our table! We said hey, we just got our chicken meal, this must be a duplicate order. She promptly took it away. (My theory is they forgot to order my husband's meal in the first place, and when we asked our server to check on the status, she put a rush order in. Somehow this resulted in two orders. I could be wrong, but there was definitely some major miscommunication with the kitchen regarding this basic order).We asked for our left-overs to be boxed up, with a bit more tzatziki for the remaining souvlaki platter. We also asked for dessert: baklava, which came warm, with a bit of ice cream on the side, and was delicious.When we got the bill, I was surprised to see a surcharge for the two extra tiny side cups of tzatziki. Sure, it was a nominal charge, but surprising nonetheless. Who charges for what is essentially a condiment? At any rate, it would have been nice to have been told there was a small charge for this.The bill, not including tip, was nearly $94. We had no drinks and no alcohol. The restaurant was super cute and the food was amazingly good and fresh and plated beautifully, but we didn't eat together. We'll definitely return and try this place again, as we hope this was an anomaly, but next time, it'd really be nice if we could enjoy our meals at the same time."},{"name":"WAVE Asian Bistro & Sushi","address":"301 N Baker St, Ste 106","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is AMAZING!

We weren't given any water, and you have to flag down the cashier/host/whatever to order. When you're seated, they just say \\"let me know when you want to order,\\" but she never looks up from her phone, so you may as well go up to the counter.It's an odd concept.

It's in a small complex; Darvish Hookah Lounge is a good landmark.We dropped in on a Sunday afternoon (around 2:00pm). The place was packed, mostly with Korean families. The two Korean ladies serving were very sweet but service is on the slow side of things.The menu is small with 24 dishes; individual soups, bibimbap, pork cutlet, naengmyeon, seafood pancake and meats. - Banchan - they bring out a dish of kimchi and pickled daikon. Nice touch with the scissors so that you can cut everything up into manageable bite sizes. \\n- Spicy pork dolsot bibimbap (#13) ($12.99) - the stone bibimbap was excllent. Pork was plentiful and had a good kick to it. The rice got crispy on the bottom and there was a good variety of vegetables (zucchini, carrots, onion and lettuce).\\n- Spicy buckwheat noodles (#15) ($12.99) - it says $11.99 on the menu but we were charged an extra $1.00. Not sure why. I'm not a huge fan of naengmyeon (Korean style cold noodles) but we'd read that they specialize in this dish. Half a boiled egg, two thin dinky pieces of beef, daikon, cucumbers, sesame seeds and gochujang. Noodles were quite chewy and springy but neither of us loved it.

When I went online to do so, the online portal (Resy) informed me that it was going to charge me 25.00 per person to cancel. I think this is in poor taste. When I called the hostess back to explain that it had literally been 20 min and I was working with my elderly grandfather, she had no problem telling me the policy stood.

Very quaint ambience -- the restaurant is an addition to an old home and evokes a rustic homey feel, with simple wooden furniture, ceiling fans, and tiny kitchen quarters with big cauldrons on stilts.

I ordered the signature fish sauce chicken wings, as well as the Muu Kham Waan, partially just to get a good sampling.  The results are pretty genuinely extraordinary.  The wing sauce is tangy, spicy, and a little bit mysterious as there's a sort of indescribable flavor running underneath it all (I assume that's the fish sauce, as fish and chicken isn't a combination of flavors I'd be inclined to attempt).  Even when the meat is gone, it's almost tempting just to gnaw on the remnants to get the most of the taste.  I heard it described as \\"drinking food\\" in Thailand and I can imagine it would be very satisfying to bite into an plate of these on a hot day, sitting in the shade, day drunk around mid-afternoon.  The spiciness level is very inoffensive while still packing enough of a punch to keep your attention.  I also took about half of it home and I'm almost tempted to say that eating it the next day out of the fridge was even better than it was fresh.  The Muu Kham Waan is supposed to be the spiciest thing on the menu, but I doubt it would ward off most people, which I found a little odd, because Thai food is known for its unique brand of heat.  It's still delicious nonetheless, with a sort of tart flavor like lemon.  It goes great with a side of sticky rice.Overall, Pok Pok is probably on my list of top five best restaurants I've tried in Portland and something I would suggest anyone visiting should try.  It's partially for the novelty of Thai chicken wings, but the food really is good enough to be worth the visit in and of itself."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"\\"Shut UP!\\" Is what I kept saying with every bite of my hangar steak entr√©e, meant in the positive way, not the negative way.Highlights:\\n * Caesar salad -- best of my life \\n * Hangar steak with the fresh chopped salsa verde on top and a sauce with a delicious vinegary bite.

We ate on a Thursday night so thankfully we didn't have to wait very long (about 10 minutes), but I could see how if you went on a busier day and time like Friday or Saturday night you would have to wait for a while. It was pretty packed for a Thursday night. \\nFor food we opted for the much talked about Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings and Khao Soi Kai (Thai curry noodle soup) along with coconut rice. I am not too sure if it was too hyped up or just not our preference or maybe a mix of both, but both my husband and I thought this place was ok. The food was edible, but it wasn't spectacular and life changing, especially the wings. I do agree with other reviews that the wings were WAYYYY too salty. My husband does enjoy his dose of fish sauce, but even he thought it was too much. The wings were definitely crunchy, but the flavoring was a bit too strong and powerful. If you LOVE fish sauce this is the spot for you. For us, having it with the rice helped to calm down the flavor, but I would have liked to enjoy the wing solely on its own. The coconut rice was also disappointing, very lackluster in coconut. We got our first bowl and it definitely did not taste like coconut at all, it tasted more like normal jasmine white rice. The server was kind enough to bring us another bowl, which appeared to have more coconut flakes than the last bowl, but still NO coconut rice taste. Normally coconut rice is very fragrant with the coconut and has a consistency similar to sticky rice, but this rice was just plain ole white rice. The best part of the meal was the curry noodle soup. It had a lot of flavor, but one that was not overpowering. I really enjoyed the noodles as well. I do wish that the chicken was cut up already. They included two pieces of chicken drumsticks, and for someone uncoordinated like myself, it was quite messy to bite into it, especially while you are sharing a bowl with someone else. If the chicken was cut up into pieces already it may have soaked up the curry even more, making it even more flavorful and delicious! \\nFor drinks I ordered the Cha Yen (Thai iced tea with evaporated milk) and my husband got the Kafae Boraan Yen (pretty much a Vietnamese coffee iced). They were both fine, nothing spectacular, but nothing terrible. We had thought the Kafae Boraan was going to be something different, but even the guy explained it was essentially Vietnamese coffee over iced. \\nOverall, I wouldn't want to wait in line for this place. If I was to come here again it would be with a group of people who wanted to give it a try. I possibly try another noodle dish, but unless someone really wanted the wings, this is not something I would come back for."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Came here over the Christmas break on a afternoon (wait was 1 hour at 4pm!)

On the first visit we went for their Tapas Tuesday and sat at the bar because we wanted something small. We ordered a glass of red and glass of white sangria which were both pretty good. They give you free warm bread with pesto sauce that we liked and ordered the Patatas Bravas, Pan con Tomate, Crema Catalana to finish. Everything was really good but the Patatas Bravas was really a stand out and worth coming back for!Worth mentioning they had three different really dated looking menus when we went (the regular menu, happy hour menu, and tapas tuesday) but on the second time they had an entirely different menu which looked much more updated but with less offerings. Tried out a cocktail called the Caipirinha and it was honestly just not very good but maybe I am just not a fan of the rum that was used? We ordered the Patatas Bravas and Pan con Tomate again as well as the Filetito and the Rabo de Toro (Oxtail). My boyfriend really enjoyed his oxtail but my filet was on the tough side which is weird for a filet and the blue cheese on top tasted like it had gone bad maybe?

I asked them where I could find a good place for dinner that was walking distance. They recommend Morton's Steakhouse, about a block and a half away. So, I called, made reservations for 5pm, that's when their dinning room opens. I arrived 30 min early, so I decided to get a glass of wine in their bar lounge. The bar waitress was very sweet, friendly and always had a smile. I hate servers that don't smile or don't focus on you, makes you feel that they don't want to be there doing what they're doing and it makes the experience awkward. I chose a petit cote red wine, and it was amazing. The bar lounge atmosphere was nice, good ambiance, great selection and didn't have loud or obnoxious patrons. A little after 5pm, I walked over to the the host, told them I had a reservation, and was immediately seated. About 5pm the dinning room was light, and began filling up by 6pm. The waiter was very pleasant, informative but yet, gave me my time and space. I don't like waiters that come to the table too often and ask too many questions. I also don't like waiters that are nowhere to be found when you need them. I asked for a second glass of the same wine I had at the bar lounge, it arrived shortly, along with a house garlic bread that I tried, but couldn't resist. The butter it came with was whipped and soft, not hard or frozen. I generally try not to eat carbs, but this bread is worth the damage. I ordered a Cesars salad and seafood tower for a starter. This sounds like a lot for a starter, but it's actually perfect. The single person seafood tower only gives you one piece of each shellfish, lobster, king crab, shrimp, snow crab, and an oyster. It was the perfect amount, not too much, not too little, and a great compliment to the Cesar salad. The shellfish was fresh, flavorful, didn't taste frozen and thawed, like some places. The Cesar salad, was great as well, a lot of flavor, a good portion, you can taste the anchovy flavor, if you like anchovies. Again, the bread goes with everything great. For my main course, I ordered an 8 oz. filet and their mushrooms. They do their mushrooms with cream or onions, but I ordered just mushrooms. The steak and mushrooms arrived, soon after I was finished with my starters. The steak was prepared perfectly, and the mushrooms in their sauce were amazing. I put the mushrooms and the sauce over the steak, and ate them together, all the while, going back and fourth with the bread and wine. My water glass was filled almost immediately, when low. Again, the waiter was perfect, gave me my space, but watched for whatever I needed, didn't constantly ask me generic questions. Overall, I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the service and the food was the best part. And for everything I ordered, the price was very reasonable. I will definitely recommend Morton's steak house to my friends and look for it when I get back home to Los Angeles."},{"name":"Moretti's","address":"5849 Sawmill Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"4.5","text":"Looking for something different for dinner, I consulted Yelp.

That's how much I wanted to try this 'Best Thai Restaurant in the US'. We (a party of 4) got to the restaurant at 2.15pm on Saturday and were finally seated at around 4pm. The area is pretty nice and while waiting 2 of us went to Eb & Bear for frozen yoghurt, and the other 2 to Salt & Straw for some really nice ice-cream.At Pok Pok we ordered the famous Vietnamese wings, Thai grilled chicken, Papaya Salad, Laab Pla Duk (catfish spicy salad), Yum Kai Dao (fried egg spicy salad), Sai Ua platter (Northern sausage and some steamed vegetable and green chili paste), and sticky rice. The best among these dishes was the Vietnamese wings which were savory, sweet, and a bit spicy. It was a good exercise for my taste buds. The flavors were just very strong that you should eat the wings with sticky rice and vegetable to balance them out. The papaya salad tasted a bit bland even when we told our waiter that we're Thai and would appreciate an authentic and mildly hot dish. The fried egg salad was nice but way too expensive ($11.95) for what it was.

It's in walking distance of the arena like most bars/clubs/food spots in the area! It's always been very clean,average noise but as you should know by now,I'm all about the bar lol. Unless I'm out on a date in which we need a little privacy,the bar is where you can find me. I don't drink but I do like getting comfy at the bar because it's more of a social thing obviously!! Ok so I've been here many times and it's almost been perfect on each occasion minus service but only a couple times out of 10 or more visits so it still makes 4 stars in my opinion! It hasn't been so bad in which I would say something to the manager and believe me,I will with pleasure lol. Service is half the experience at least so that should be a no brainier! Ok ok..so I've had all of the Ceviches and my favorite is actually the Ceviche De Pulpo(it's glorious in its milky but firm texture)but if you're new to Ceviches or don't know what to get,the Ceviche De Gambas is really good(chilled Shrimp marinated in Lime Juice/Garlic,tossed with Fresh Cilantro,Jalape√±o & Onion)! Its a winner of flavor and it's one of the cheapest(double win lol)! Speaking about saving money,Tapas Tuesday is where it's at to be able to try more for less! I don't mind paying for the quality of my happiness 8 ) but I love a great deal and Tuesday is a good night in which to go see the Magic play anyway. BOOM! NBA is my favorite sport so don't get me started!! B ) Just so we are clear I am not a Magic fan lol(GO SUNS) but I love the way the arena is setup and it's always a good time! I also highly recommend the Solomillo A La Parilla,Jamon Serrano,Piquilllo Renenos & any of the veggie dishes!! I'm a huge veggie eater but I eat them mainly in clean or raw versions in my meal prep for the week so it's nice to get more flavors out of the foods I love for a change of pace!

With 4 floors that span the entire block, multiple sets of bathrooms, and inviting people of all backgrounds, ages, races, etc, Powell's is really something special.As with all Portland businesses, the workers are not only friendly and welcoming, but the intense pressure to buy something is absent, which is a great anxiety of mine in this modern day and age of capitalism (I'm more than my discretionary income!!!). People come here just to read and hangout, and it just has such a warm ethos that makes me hopeful for the future generations in not forgoing physical books.Needless to say, the selection is very impressive, but the reason I am shying away from 4-stars is that while the size of the store is impressive, it doesn't really have anything that set it apart for me.

What is it with all these restaurants in Austin and their paper-thin chips?? The salsa was good, but the chips disintegrated in my hands. As far as food goes, we both ordered the chalupa compuesta, one beef and one shrimp. These were 'eh.'

Decent amount for appetizers, but an order of the boar collar is simply not enough.  Make sure you really understand how SMALL the portion is for the boar collar... (which was why we ordered two plates to start).I loved that they offered mustard leaves to help you cool down your mouth and cleanse your palate between bites.  I honestly remembered the boar being better when I came here the first time.  Now I think it's over drenched in sauce.The spiciest thing we had that day was the papaya salad, and we didn't even get it SUPER spicy!  It was, however, very refreshing for a hot day (despite it being very spicy...)  We chugged our water really quick, thank goodness the California drought hasn't hit us in Portland yet.The wings were sweet, spicy and sticky as expected, but the meat was tender and you pretty much have to lick your fingers afterward.

Make sure you mix in the fish sauce that comes with it too - don't be scared off by the smell.  It provides the perfect amount of moisture and adds so much flavor.

The taste of the smoothie was a little bland, like they had been generous with the milk and less so with the tea. It was still sweet and creamy so we liked it, and the pearls were soft and chewy. Definitely not at the level of cult-favorite boba shops, but good enough to fulfill a cold drink craving.2) Pineapple Fried Rice: 3/5. The rice was fairly dry, either like not enough water had been added when it was made, or it had been cooked earlier in the day. The flavors made up for the hard texture - we liked the combination of the spices with the currents, tofu, and veggies. Definitely a lot more seasoned than some pineapple fried rices I've had in the past. 3) Green Curry: 5/5. I have to admit, by the time we got to this dish, we were bursting at the seams, but continued to plow ahead. The flavor was rich, spicy, and decadent - I loved the combination of veggies and chicken that they put into the curry. I don't think anyone could ever go wrong with a nice hot bowl of curry with rice. The portions for each of these dishes were absolutely massive and the check wasn't too bad, considering the fact that they had given us enough food to feed a small village (aptly named Tuesday lunch, Wednesday lunch, etc....)Next time I'll have to try the pho!

My partner's birthday rolled around and I thought I would organize a nice brunch to end his birthday weekend (02/10/19) I was so excited. I won't get into the whole fiasco regarding the number of my party and having to stand in the middle of the restaurant while they sorted things out at the computer leaving us to just stand there watching people eat. The reason I am giving this review has to do with health code concerns. The first offense came when we found a hair in the hollandaise sauce. They apologized and that was that. Not long after I was eating my entree when I was told to STOP and then a long black hair about 4\\" long was hidden under my poached eggs. To tell you how disgusted I was would be  an understatement. To tell you how embarrassed I was for my partner and guests would only raise my BP once again. Really a pity this is such a gem and I hope one day they decide to separate the hair salon from the kitchen."},{"name":"Zaza's Cuban Cafe","address":"1 Jeff Fuqua Blvd, Airside 1, Gates 10-19","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"A great little stop while at the 30-59 gates.

There were things I liked about the restaurant, but on the whole, I remember my frustrations and the restaurant's imperfections the most. Starting with the hostess stand, it took 10-15 min just to even put our names on the wait list.  The hostess was so blase and lacking in any urgency.  She kept wandering off and doing something else, which is just the worst way to greet a guest.  After about 40 minutes, we got our table and ordered a variety of dishes that were non-spicy to accommodate our 4 y.o.  As we waited for our food, we snacked on spicy kaffir lime peanuts.  The food took FOREVER to come out, moreso than other tables.  The famous Ike's wings are deep fried with a pungent glaze of fish sauce. \\nI like crispy wings as much as the next person but these were overfried and bordering on too dry. The fish sauce was so overwhelmingly strong.  It's fun to eat 1-2 of these but any more and you're really tired of the strong taste. We also ordered the Woon Sen, a vermicelli noodle dish with pork belly.  I liked this a lot with a soy based sauce and lots of black pepper.   The Muu Yang ribs were nothing too special except for the sauce, which was spicy and really good.  The sauteed Chinese broccoli was tasty too, and also featured a lot of fish sauce.  As per usual, their drinking vinegar soms are an excellent accompaniment to Thai food because it's cold and refreshing and slightly acidic to balance the food.  I chose a season special - the strawberry and thai basil and it was perfect. Overall, the food was good, but not that good and the other weird things like the long wait time and the standoffish hostess make this a meh choice for me."},{"name":"Thai Wok Kitchen","address":"5000 E 4th Plain Blvd, Ste A101","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"This is the best authentic Thai in Vancouver.

Their Fantasia di Mare was amazing too. I have had many seafood salads in the states that just fail. This is the real deal. I am dreaming up reasons to come back to Portland so I can eat here again. Ristorante Roma is better than any Seattle Italian restaurant I have tried. My mouth is watering just thinking of it.P.S. The ambience is fine. It is not something to write home about, but the service and food more than makes up for it. They also accommodated my one year old nephew who had a great time.

It's off the beaten path for sure unless you live in that area which I hear is up and coming. We were seated right away but had to ask for brunch menus. If you don't eat meat, you can still eat very well. Nice selection for brunch and they had bottomless mimosas($15) which my friend enjoyed. She said they are good and not skimmpy on the alcohol. She first tried their bloody mary and it was like a bbq sauce smoothie so she sent it back. Our waiter took a while to check on us and other staff acted like they didn't see us which was rude in my opinion. The place was empty so if you see customers looking directly at you when you  can't spot the waiter, how about assist if you see there is a need.

I've had Vegan meals from here before, however today made me not ever want to order. Me and a friend of mine ordered for lunch. She was treating me for my birthday. So we both ordered the Vegan Meatball sliders off of the \\"vegan\\" section on the menu on Uber Eats.   ..... fast forward to the meal. My salad was delicious! After my salad I bit into one of the sliders and immediately noticed the slider wasn't meat. My friend didn't notice as she eats beef, BUT NOT pork! I asked her to call them and they assured her it was vegan & she ended the call. I opened up the  slider & looked at the meat and said, \\"This is NOT vegan! Please call them back \\".  She calls them back and we inquire again about the sliders. Before calling her back we had another coworker who eats meat taste it and he stated it taste like \\"mixed meats, but couldn't pinpoint it\\". When we inquired what the vegan slider was made of they stated it had lentils. I said this is definitely NOT lentils. I asked if they put cheese on the sliders and the lady on the phone the lady in the phone said \\"oooh, it has cheese?\\", then placed me on hold. She came back to the line and then confirmed it was indeed NOT vegan. We asked for a manager or supervisor and was told none was available and began to sound frustrated on the phone. She told us we had to back through Uber Eats for a refund. When we kept asking she used \\"Like I said\\".... which is VERY unprofessional!  She even asked if we ordered the wrong one..... we had to inform her, that is the ONLY slider on your Uber Eats menu! I have screenshot their ENTIRE menu so there will be no mistake if there is some change after the fact!You served meat (pork & beef meatballs) to two customers: (1) who's religion DOES NOT allow them eat pork and (2) someone who's vegan and has not had meat in over 10 years!!! Just horrible.So my friend received a voicemail from the manager who stated we have to specify in the notes when we order that it's Vegan; BUT there is NOTHING stating you need to do this when ordering AND we ordered off of the vegan menu. I was very disgusted & disappointed today! Sickened to my stomach. Everyone is pointing the blame at the other. Basically the restaurant said, go through Uber Eats to get your money back.

I will say the biscuits with honey butter were great, but the item we were told was their signature dish, chicken and waffles, was very disappointing.  The waffle was a corn bread waffle and was very dense, and the chicken was over breaded and over cooked.

It's rare that every element (appetizers, main dish, bread, tea, desserts) is a 10. In our case, it was so delicious, I was emotional over every bite.

OYSTERS\\nWe had the Island Crew, Moon Shoal, and Wellfleet Petite oysters. As someone who doesn't have oysters often, I thought they all tasted wonderfully fresh and reminiscent of the sea.

Raise the room rate by $20-30/night, give me free parking, no resort fee; you'll make the same money, and the public will eat it up, it's just mind boggling how difficult this is to understand.  I debated going four stars instead of five because the resort fee plus parking fee puts you at nearly $60/day before you even walk through the door; that's crazy.  I'm keeping it at five due to the pool.Well anyway, this is a very nice hotel, and even though the fees and pricing on food/drinks make me want to penalize, the attention to detail by the staff, and the excellent pool, which allows both coolers and drinks in the pool, mean both five stars and us returning regularly.  Only real issue is that our 14th floor stay in May 2019 saw both ice machines broken, so getting ice turned into an elevator ride and a lot of walking over the course of my family's visit.  It's nice having a real Starbucks on-site, but a tip, due to this location not being corporate owned, whoever does own it has decided to not honor gold rewards members' free refill benefit.  Out at the pool, it's awesome; very good food/beverage service, albeit priced like a Disney resort.  One particular server, Jamie Lee, wow, she actually came and found my wife and I floating around the lazy river rather than just dropping our drinks off at our chairs; now that is incredible service.  Last but not least, probably the best pool side hamburger I've ever had; medium rare was actually medium rare, not an over cooked hockey puck because the place is afraid to serve something under cooked.For families and kids, the lazy river is a blast.  However, unfortunately given there are a lot of families and kids, you'll have an equal mix of kids whose families can't be bothered to parent them.  On the busy weekend we were there, we definitely experienced no shortage of younger ones jumping off rocks, canon balling waves into random people, running, pushing, shoving, etc.  They do have lifeguards on duty much of the time, contrary to the signage their lawyers likely required them to put in place saying they don't, but unfortunately they are there to save people, not parent people's kids for them, so no one stops the bad behavior.  So, I would not exactly call the pool a romantic setting or place for a couple to relax sans kids; it can be pretty rambunctious.  At one of the restaurants, our server actually went to one of the sister restaurants of the property to get bernaise sauce for my wife's filet, knowing the other one had it and they didn't.  Again, fantastic service at this place!"},{"name":"Bennu Coffee","address":"515 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Best late night coffee shop!

It is owned and led by Fabio and Paula, a brilliant couple sharing their passions of fabulous food with our community. With a chef by their side, nothing can stop them from making their wine bar and kitchen a new community hangout.Every time I'm there, I see so many community members sending time with their friends and family. Fabio and Paula make every person feel welcomed from the moment they walk through the door. To me, they're a true definition of community, especially when their guests surprise Fabio for his birthday with a cake and dressing up similar to him.They have so many dishes and separated based on type: vegetarian, land, sea, and sweets. Each dish has a unique trait that makes them enjoyable.For their wines, they also have a wide variety and Fabio is more than happy to help you find your new favorite like he did with me. When speaking about food and wine with Fabio and Paula, you can see their passions glisten in their eyes as well as hear it in their voices.One of my top wines to enjoy at VINIA include this Greek wine I discovered with the help of Fabio. If not, I'd have their Douro from Portugal or Bordeaux from France. The wines I do like are definitely on the side of bold, full-bodied and tastes of tannins.¬†Every time I'm here, I usually order the Romeu & Julieta. These are Authentic Brazilian cheese bread (p√£o de queijo) with guava sauce. They are made with tapioca, which gives them their chew. You will have trouble keeping your hands off of these and might fight others at the table for the last bite.¬†Empanada de Carne con Queso¬†are beef and mixed cheeses empanadas that have a delicious crispy and dense exterior that balances out the smooth texture of the interior. The flavors are very mellow and a touch of the chimichurri and pepper oil both add a nice touch to each bite. It's definitely a lighter option than many other places with empanadas. ¬†The Bacalhau ao Forno is pan roasted cod, honey roasted butternut squash flan lemon sage sage, and saut√© spinach. This is one of my favorite dishes here because of how unique it is with the flan. There's such savory sweetness to it that makes it unique and impossible to find anywhere else in town, especially when it is as good as this one.¬†The Ravioli Fatti a Mano is the Chef's composition with artisan ravioli. Each day may have a different selection and flavor so make sure you ask Fabio and Paula what the Chef's composition is that day. When I went, it was cheese and mushroom stuffing, which was very nice and comforting. I'm all about the comfort feeling when I take a bite of pasta.Rabo de Toro is composed of 15 hour braised ox tail, black eyed pea spaetzle, preserved tomato, mustard greens, and au jus. The flavorful ox tail melts in your mouth supported by the spaetzle and vegetables.Porc en Cro√ªte de Cacao √âpic√© is a dish revolving cocoa rubbed smoked pork tenderloin on a bed of polenta and tomato coffee sauce. The coffee flavors are very mellow in the tomato sauce and on the pork tenderloin. The pork tenderloin is cooked well and moist, especially when taking a bite with the smooth and delicious polenta. I've had polenta before, but I've never enjoyed it this much.After all those dishes, I still made room for some desserts. As you can see, I couldn't tell which one I really wanted. Luckily, they have a dessert flight with all three options in smaller portions. Also, you can pair it with some dessert wines for an additional cost.The Affogato is vanilla gelato dosed with caramel espresso. For me, I'd like this to be the large size... in a cup with ice and a straw.¬†Torta de Ma√ß√£ is a thin Granny Smith apple pie topped with pastry cream and cinnamon sugar. I love how it's a thin bite, which gives it a crispy touch that I quite enjoy. You could dip this in the Affogato or next dessert like I did for a variety of flavors.Last, but not least, I tried the Pot de Cr√®me au Chocolat. It is a rich chocolate custard with crated dark chocolate and sea salt. I would absolutely order this in its full size all the time! I can't wait to come back for more food and more of this dessert.I'm happy to say that I walked in as a hungry stranger and came out full of love and friendships in my heart as well as delicious food in my belly."},{"name":"Counter Culture","address":"2337 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"It was pretty awesome to be able to skim the menu and pick something.

I could honestly not really tell you exactly what we ordered because there was so much and a bill for 4 of us ended up totaling $100. Lots of Bao, Shumai, Soup dumplings, noodles, and stir fry. Our table was running out of room and overflowing with dishes. The number one thing you must order though is the Fried Shrimp Balls! These were a favorite of the table and were delicious.

It is so much better than Starbucks, which is overloaded with sugar. My friend spotted a cleared table with 4 outlets right next to the area they prepare food.

This was cool because #1 it was Saturday afternoon, and # I was hungry on the verge of hangry. As it was both of our first times, we were overwhelmed with the menu. This is a good thing when it comes to breakfast folks. They have several varieties of pancakes, waffles, omlets in addition to sides including fruit and hash browns.Our server, Luis, suggested a combo platter since it was our first time. I'm always up for a little sample of everything so a combo works out just fine. Also, since the pancakes are the size of a large serving platter, selecting the one pancake combo was perfect. I ordered the banana nut pancake, 2 eggs (over medium just how I asked) and the hash browns. My son ordered the Belgian waffle, bacon and toast combo. The waffles come with home made whipped cream. My son said it the best whipped cream he has ever tasted. I personally haven't met a whipped cream I didn't like, but hey.  The pancake was super fluffy and the bananas didn't make it mushy. The eggs were cooked just as I asked, and the hash browns were made with red sliced potatoes and really good especially with some ketchup the way I like ;)Service was great!

There were two waffles to be made ahead of ours. I felt a little bad however, because she was rushing around as quick as she could, with no help. It seemed like someone in that cart since they have the space in there would have helped either ring/cashier and then prep.This waffle was delish. All components came together and the waffle itself was crispy and buttery without being oily. The graham crackers and chocolate were proportioned and all melted.The serving trays are a little hard to manage while trying to cut through several layers of a waffle, one handed. Maybe just a regular plate? This would avoid the waffle tipping out over the edge from the cutting force/momentum, as my friend spilled her waffle :( Since there is nothing proprietary, compared to the numerous waffle places popping up, the price point seemed a little high. Each waffle seems 1-2 dollars higher than competitors, which may just be a matter of brand loyalty, right? Some may like Starbucks more than Dunkin Donuts coffee even though it's more.

Initially they brought a plate that clearly had chips (ie fries) on it that were re-heated as one could already tell by how they looked. The taste and texture was hence borderline disgusting. I complained and got a fresh serving of fries, but just the attempt to re-heat fries should make any kitchen feel utterly ashamed!Just as bad: the fish was completely drowned in batter. In one section the better was over half an inch thick, not cooked and not edible.My partner got the seared Ahi tuna salad, and here the fish was weirdly luke warm, and it was impossible to tell if it was meant to be served warm or cold.

The restaurant is very conveniently located next to the Kenmore T-station--the walk is about 3 minutes from the station. The restaurant itself is very elegant, and an excellent place for a celebration or a date night. We started off by sharing a bowl of clam chowder, which the staff kindly split in half for us. The chowder was super rich and buttery, and I loved the crispy bits of bacon in the soup. They also brought bread for the table, and a deliciously, sweetened butter. For our entrees, I went for the Monkfish and my friend chose the striped sea bass. The monkfish was cooked in a saffron sauce and pan seared to a perfect crisp. The fish was flakey and meaty, and the sauce was super rich, with pieces of dried fruit for a touch of sweetness. Included in the saffron sauce was also saut√©ed potatoes and kale, which was a great way to incorporate sides into the dish. I had a bite of my friend's sea bass and it was delicious as well. The fish was very crispy, and I loved the risotto cakes that came with it. To finish off our meal, we were having a hard time deciding between the Boston cream donuts and the flourless chocolate cake. We ended up choosing the donuts, but to our surprise, the waitress brought us both and gave us the chocolate cake on the house, since she saw we were having a very hard time choosing. The waitress had recommended the donuts, and she wanted us to taste test between the two for ourselves! The winner was definitely the donuts: they weren't too sweet, and they were warm with a creamy, vanilla pudding on the inside. The also provide a warmed side of chocolate ganache to dip the donuts in, and the sauce was rich and made with very dark, quality chocolate. The flourless chocolate cake is definitely a chocolate lovers dream, but it was a little too rich for me after a few bites. However, you could definitely taste the high quality chocolate. I also really liked the coconut ice cream that came with it!If I could, I would give this restaurant a 6/5!

Being Italian and from a neighboring town, I was SUPER excited in thinking that this modern restaurant, which has sister chains in the north end, would be my new go-to spot for the summer. Driving down North Ave., my three sisters and I could see people enjoying intimate meals next to lit heater towers on the outdoor patio; we had to try it! We greeted the hostess and asked to be placed inside. Seeing that we did not make a reservation, she threw us outside even despite my warning her that I did not want to freeze outside on this windy evening on June 1st. (Gotta love NE). We were seated outside, nevertheless, and assured the fire pit would keep us comfortable during our meal. We went with the flow. We got there at 7pm and were not served our meals until 8:45pm. By that time, people were leaving the interior of the restaurant but  we were still being seated outside, freezing and hungry!The menu options and variety were disappointing. We each ordered a pasta dish in a half size at half price at the recommendation of our waitress, Sam (who was a sweetheart and the reason we stayed); bucatini alla carbonara, tagliatelle bolognese, spaghetti and shrimp fra diavolo, and the orrechiette rabe and sausage. Upon receiving the check, we saw that we were charged for 4 full size dishes.The pasta was over cooked, a rookie mistake as homemade pasta cooks quickly. My sister's bolognese sauce was acidic, bland and the meat was dry. The spaghetti fra diavolo and shrimp came with only three shrimps, all of which were overcooked, a sauce that was not spicy and that did not taste or have the aroma of fish in it at all. The carbonara I ordered was extremely bland, used a substitute meat when pancetta should have been used, and had zero pepper. Sam said eggs were used, but that is questionable. The rabe and sausage again was bland. We had to ask for extra cheese and pepper but by the time it came, our pasta was already cold from just being seated outside. We didn't know how much longer we'd have to wait to put in orders for the second plates so we decided to cut our losses and leave.  I had such high expectations because Tonno should have been as delicious and authentic a restaurant as you would expect to find in the North End. It certainly is just as expensive as the North End!!! After this experience, I can confidently say that the North End is worth the drive! Thank you for reading!

And that's where we get to the other stuff. I love the concept of picking all of your ingredients and customizing to such a great extent. But I think they set up the crust to bake fast by rolling it out thin and, in doing so, forcing the crust to be crackery, with no puffiness or chewiness.

We sat next to a woman using her laptop on the bar who identified herself as the owner. We ordered drinks and then I tried to order the Simple Salad but was told that it was not available because they didn't get there greens delivered today. We both ordered the salmon soup, which sounded delicious, Rustic Baguette, Marinated Mushrooms and Oregon Lamb Meatballs. The thought was that if we were still hungry after eating this, we'd order something more. The server returns to tell us that he must not have been paying attention to the Chef when he was told the fresh sheet and that the soup was actually a butternut squash.  We said fine, but I needed to adjust my taste buds which were getting all ready for that yummy sounding salmon.After some time, the food arrives except for the meatballs.  Soup is delicious, six small pieces of baguette and olive oil, and a tiny cup of 7 or 8 mushroom caps.  At some point, the server checks in and we mention that we are still expecting the meatballs.  He'll check.  We finish our food and he comes by and we ask again about the meatballs.  Oh!  I gave them to the party sitting next to you by mistake.  I'll get more.  Another 5-10 minutes later, we still don't have the meatballs.  I'm sorry, I'll comp them and off he goes again. At this point I'm still hungry and would have ordered something else, but we kept thinking those meatballs would show up and they might be enough.  The owner is now behind the bar, standing right in front of us, emptying the dish machine and breaks a glass.  \\"I break one glass a year.\\" she states.  I check the time and see it's after 6:30.  The server appears again, still no meatballs and we ask if there is a problem with them.  This is where it gets weird.The owner interjects that the restaurant is full and things take time.  I say, no, that's not the problem.  We've been expecting these for a while and the server accidentally gave them to the wrong party.  The server acknowledges that it was his error.  She makes more excuses.  I say it's an order of meatballs and we ordered it an hour ago (exasperated look).  Surprised, she looks to the server and he nods.  It's interesting because she's been here the whole time, talking to us periodically during the entire hour.  She continues to make excuses about being a busy night, a busy kitchen, etc. and I say you are making an awful lot of excuses.  She didn't like that.  She then tells us that we had a drink and some soup with bread and that should be enough for us.  Really? Now you are going to tell me what's enough food for me?I don't recall if that was the last exchange, but the next thing out of her mouth was \\"That's it. Get the f**k out of my restaurant!\\" Raised voice and finger pointing toward the door, quite the dramatic scene for the other diners.  My friend and I were both shocked.  Are you kidding me? No! I won't have you insulting my server. I never insulted him!  Write what you want, just get the f**k out of my restaurant.  You were angry when you came in!  What are you talking about, I wasn't angry (I was very happy to be having dinner with my friend and go to the ballet.)  I kick one person out a year and I guess you're it.She is rushing us to leave (if only they rushed meatball orders as quickly) and as I'm gathering my things, I ask her name.  I'm not going to give you my name!  You can't even give me your name?  No, I don't have to.  It's out there; look it up!  I just shook my head and walked out the door.To me, she will always be She Who Must Not Be Named.  She also had a pretty big day.  Breaking her one glass and kicking out her one customer for the year.  It's liable to be a long year ahead.  Some anger management classes may have to be employed to keep that record going.Somewhere in there she mentioned owning restaurants for 11 years.  Pretty hard to believe with that short fuse and her less than stellar customer service skill set.  I have learned that she and her husband opened this place in May of this year and also own the Thirst Bistro at River Place.  I wonder how high the hysteria reaches over there. So, if you want to be told what is enough for you to eat, be insulted and rudely ejected from a \\"happy\\" hour, then I strongly suggest you check out Bistro Marquee.  But I would avoid the bar if a woman with a laptop is sitting at the end of it.  She was right about one thing:  I can look up her name.

One thing I really enjoy about this Wingstop is that they have the fancy soda machine that gives you a variety of flavors. They have limited seating that's usually packed.

I received a kind greeting from everyone working there and I told them I'd need a few moments before deciding what I wanted.  The restaurant has a nice, relaxed Bayou look to it and the owner is still making changes.  He was looking at table designs and asked my opinion before I ordered.I'm trying to change up at restaurants and get away from being that \\"creature of habit\\" when I order food, so I figured I'd try the chicken and the mash potatoes.  The  chicken comes two ways, Cajun (their specialty) and Yankee-fried.  I'm sure that's a subtle crack on us northerners who the south believes can't cook (lol).  Let me get right to it. BOTH types were indescribable!  Having that Yankee-fried chicken out of the fryer was an experience that you'd have to find out for yourself.  Hot, juicy, crispy/crunchy and oh, so tasty!  Biting down and sucking on the meat, minding the temperature, made each bite heaven.  I couldn't believe how good it tasted.  I couldn't wait to try Cajun style.  When I did...         ...dude.  It's like trying to describe colors when you're seeing for the first time.  Not spicy at all, but such wonderful flavor.  It had a bit of a 'dry rub' texture, because of the seasoning and it was awesome!But then...\\n...waaaaaaaait for it...Those [expletive] mashed potatoes!!!  The same seasoning as the Cajun Chicken (the seasoning is also for sale).  Butter visibly melting within and creamy like you can't imagine.  The portion size was healthy, which led to my only regret: Drinking a full container of lemonade before eating.  I was full before I could get through it all and just wanted to cry.  So what did I do? I forced it down like a 7-year old!  I was full for the remainder of the day and had to force myself to eat the same thing at dinner time.  Oh, did I forget to mention that I called back in the evening to order 12 pieces of chicken and two containers of mashed potatoes to go with the pepper-seasoned corn and honey cornbread that I made at home?  I was the hero of the evening with my family.  Check my picture of the potatoes.  They are the hidden superstars here and you can't go wrong with the chicken.  Yes, the Cajun Bowtie Pasta is the popular item, but trust me, you MUST try these other items.Top that off with excellent service (special nod to Clay, who took great care of me, both times) and you'll have a great time."},{"name":"sweetgreen","address":"372 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The service was nice.

The concept was neat - getting to \\"draw\\" your own pancakes - so adding that to their yummy buttermilk batter made this place a treat.The only reason for the docked star is the speed of service. We came in just before 10 AM on a weekend with four, so we knew there would be a wait. That was no problem and we enjoyed a nice cup of tea across the street while awaiting their text.However, even once seated it seemed to take a while to bring out the pancake batter bottles, which seemingly would not require much prep. Once we started, it did not seem anyone checked in with us. Despite our stacked empty cups at the front, I had to wait for a while to catch someone to refill my iced tea. The server when she came back was very friendly, leading me to guess this is a more a staffing problem than a performance one.My only other smaller points: Their turkey bacon was not to my liking. It seemed more like a slice of turkey than bacon, and not like other turkey bacon options that I've tried. My husband liked it though, saying he likes meat more than bacon, so he had it.Also, their whipped cream quality and amount was meh. It was clearly something from a can as opposed to freshly whipped cream. The ladle they give you for it also seemed small. It was similar cost and same size to chocolate chips, but while that was a lot of servings of chips (like a hundred), it's only like two servings worth in whipped cream.

There is a variety of food choices here... a number of us ordered salads which were delicious.  I had the spring rolls which were equally as awesome.  My largest complaint is that they screwed the orders up and forgot to put chicken on a number of our salads so they had to send each of them back.  While waiting for those chicks to cook, our waitress continued bringing out food separately.  I have learned this is a large pet peeve of mine...unless all orders are ready at the same time, please keep them in the back.  I hate eating around others who are equally as starving as I am.  I would NOT recommend getting the calamari... one word - YUCK.  They served it in this spicy mayo that was like watered down battered... it was so gross.They have a decent happy hour crowd, a patio to sit outside, and a cool lounge/bar atmosphere inside.

Hawaii doesn't exactly have raving Italian restaurants so I was looking forward to this one. Sadly, I have never been so disrespected before when walking into a restaurant. Why did I even sit down to continue to a meal? I do not know. It bothers me that I still can't figure out an answer to my own question and why I thought it was OK to proceed with the evening here based on the entry in alone. On October 25, I called the restaurant at 5:02 pm. I made a reservation for 2 people at 8 pm. This reservation time was provided to me by the very kind lady who answered my call. Being from out of town, I would have never known whether or not it was unusual to get a last minute reservation like this. However, when I got to the restaurant at 8:09 pm (nine minutes late because we walked her in the cold and rain), the round, Italian man laid up against the glass case on the left hand side made it very clear to me that last minute reservations like the one I made are unusual and that I simply could not have a reservation. He explained to me, \\"Reservations are made months in advance and your name is not on my paper. You see? I don't see your name. Are you French?\\" WTF? Now, let me tell you, his paper is a big fucking mess of scratch marks and random letter in random places. I don't even know how a host or restaurant can function with that kind of reservation system. And, no, to answer your weird, random question, I am not French. I proceeded to show him my call log and ask if I called the right number in which he replied, \\"Yes, but your name is not on this paper and I don't know why you would try to call at 5:02 to make a reservation.\\" WHAT? Someone help me understand this man...So, moving on, I asked if we could still even be seated for the evening. I understood that my name was not on the paper and as weird as that was to me we still thought we would dine-in based on the raving reviews. He pointed to the table in the back, left corner of the restaurant by a fridge and said, \\"There.\\" My mother and I kindly stated that we would like a table in the restaurant, lively space if we were going to dine-in. He replied, \\"Reservations get the seats by the windows and around the restaurants. Walk-ins sit wherever the is room.\\"Talk about undermining and insulting. Despite his very awful, upsetting customer service he made a table for 2 in an open space for us without a peep. Now, this is where we should have left and walked out. I was very upset but also very hungry and I figured that my hunger could be getting the best of me at that point and so we sat...I quickly ordered the La Graicia and my mom ordered a carne dish over penne. With our two dishes, we also ordered 2 glasses of Pinot Noir and waited on our meal with a big basket of bread. Bread never gets 0 stars. Bread always gets 5 stars. The way they serve olive oil and vinegar is stupid and 0 stars though. It came in a little sauce dish that would usually hold something like ranch or ketchup and the two ingredients (olive oil & vinegar) didn't mix in this little sauce holder. Olive oil and vinegar should be served on a small plate for dipping for equal distribution of oil and vinegar. How did these Italians not know this? Next, within 10 minutes, our food came out piping hot. My plate, La Graicia, was SALTY. There is no other word for it. Salty. Salty. Salty. That's all I tasted. I couldn't even eat half the plate of food. On the other hand, my mom's dish lacked flavor and she shook salt on her food. In both the dishes, the noodles were undercooked. More than al dente.The server at our table switched at some point in the middle. I'm not sure why. Both boys who helped our table were young, Italian, and cute. They didn't chat much or do anything special, they just took our order and brought our food with a smile. They did their job. As much as they were cute, the owner/manager/host/jerk off or whatever the hell that round, curly haired man is really put a bad taste in our mouth and so did the food.As my star rating would indicate, I would not recommend coming here. I'm sure there are plenty more dining options in Portland where you can be treated more kindly and welcomingly.

Needless to say to those of you who have visited before me, I am now sold. I get it. It's an experience as much as it is a book store. In fact, it's not even fair to call it a book store, which they don't. It's a City of Books, and at 68,000 square feet, it literally covers an entire city block, and goes 4 stories high (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4325727134/). Madness.If this store wasn't organized (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4325732240/) as well as it is I'm quite certain it would induce a sense of vertigo among people aimlessly wandering the aisles for hours.

I already have every book they have published by him, but it was just nice seeing so much of his work compiled in one place.There's not a whole lot I can add to the lore of Powell's, but I will offer you one suggestion. Buy something. In fact, buy several things. I picked up 3 books (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4325077547/), for maybe close to double what I could have gotten them for online, but I feel like you have to support businesses like this whenever you can afford to, or before long they'll all be gone and we'll be buying everything online from one mega-site.

I would of even paid an upcharge for the Broccoli instead of wasting all those Potatoes.The only thing great about this plate was the sausage and eggs.  Shrimp has no flavor and they were tough. It does not seem like the food is cook in seasoning, I believe they just pour Garlic Butter over the top. Where is the seasoning(flavor).

The food COULD have been great, but some rudimentary cooking skills were absent.  I ordered the shrimp and grits and a side of Mac and cheese.  The Mac was great.  Not the best I've ever had, but great for a side.  The wilted greens on my plate were good, as was the grits, but the shrimp was wretched.  Out of the 6 shrimp I got, 3 were only half-shelled or not at all.  I've had peel and eat shrimp before- this was not supposed to be.  Additionally, the shrimp just tasted like dishwater.  I don't know how they were defrosted nor in what condition/freshness they got the shrimp, but they didn't taste fresh on the plate.  Maybe it was an off night.  The ambience was great.  The bathroom was filthy (one of my hot-buttons at a restaurant).  My friend's steak was excellent.  Had I ordered his meal instead of mine, I'd have given this place a 4.  A dirty bathroom shows lack of attention to detail and a lack of respect for their clientele, so if they cleaned that up, they'd get another star (assuming I hadn't had the shrimp)."},{"name":"Joe's 320 Cafe","address":"320 Spring St W Roxbury","city":"West Roxbury","stars":"4.5","text":"My girlfriend and I have been here about a dozen times since they opened and we can't recommend it enough. Collectively we've tried about half the menu (plus most of the specials) and all the food is phenomenal.It's a scratch kitchen so everything is made fresh to order and the one chef, Joe, clearly holds himself to a high standard. Every plate looks great and tastes even better. We've ordered dishes with all types of modifications and they're always 100% accommodating.Since it's still new and fairly unknown we've never had to wait for a table, but I expect that will change soon enough. If you don't mind sitting at the bar, it's a great way to skip any line and get a front row seat into the kitchen. Plus the regulars there are super friendly This is a great place to bring friends and catch up over breakfast or lunch. The food takes a little longer than other places, since it's one guy and everything is made from scratch, but it's well worth the wait. Also the waitresses will bring you any kind of coffee or tea or drinks in the meantime. Don't be afraid to ask.As for food, my favorite dishes have all been specials. Buffalo wings, the pork/beef meatball sandwich, and the beef stew were off the charts. My favs from the main menu have been the meat-lovers omlet, the bacon cheeseburger, and the fries. All super fresh and more food than I can eat in a single sitting. My girlfriend prefers breakfast food and raves about the chicken and waffles. For lunch she's always trying new pasta dishes but I think her favs are the chicken, broccoli, ziti and the mac and cheese (from the kids menu). All the pasta is made in house so, if you've never had homemade pasta, you're in for a real treat. Also, if they have fresh hot chocolate, get it.Overall, we absolutely love the food and atmosphere of this place. It's local, convenient and family friendly. The prices are good, the dishes are huge, and they make you feel welcome, even if it's your first time stopping in.And seriously, try that hot chocolate if they got it"},{"name":"Dish Dive","address":"2233 College Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"So incredibly delicious-- they have a small menu but every single item on the menu is delicious.Best food with such an unpretentious vibe!"},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Austin.

Yes, I occasionally deviate from the unsweet tea with lime. I was in the mood for some root beer but wouldn't you know it...  They were out of root beer so I settled for lemonade. While waiting for my order, the gentleman working there seemed to have trouble keeping the orders straight. I received my order before the guys that were waiting when I walked in and they took it in stride but were obviously annoyed. After taking pictures of my meal I dug in. The food was very good with a few minor misses. The seasoning was traditional and reminded me of some of the Lebanese dishes I was taught to make long ago but the Tabbouleh could have used a touch more  olive oil and lemon juice. The hummus was wonderful and just the way I like it. The potatoes had more kick than I was expecting but in a GOOD way. The chicken and beef portions were very generous and I was given plenty of pita bread to go with it. Those stuffed grape leaves were OFF THE CHAIN good.

From travel to cooking to fiction to classics and even rare books... and everything in between. It's a rad place to get lost in the stacks for a while, to sell your used goods, and to pick up a few new or new-to-you used books as well. I've purchased and sold many books here, and while I do read a lot on my electronic devices these days, nothing really compares to the sensation of having a book in your hand.

I ordered the chicken melanzana which was chicken and eggplant with pasta. The pasta was absolutely disgusting. It had a weird after taste and lacked any flavor. Chicken with eggplant tasted better but lacked flavor as well. My daughter had a chicken alfredo and agreed as well that he pasta had an after taste and dish lacked flavor.

Most of the fruits are canned though with the exception of bananas. Still tasty though.Their desserts were good, better than their hot food! They had green tea ice cream and small chocolate mousse cups amongst other items."},{"name":"Brassica","address":"2212 E Main St","city":"Bexley","stars":"4.5","text":"Brassica is a culinary adventure that I would STRONGLY recommend to anyone. This restaurant is spectacular and has been a huge part of my life ever since my wife Karen left me. Every individual topping in the bowls here could each be served as their own individual dishes, however brassica boldly goes where no other Mediterranean eatery dares to go. I could go on in length about each individual element of a brassica bowl. Perhaps one of my favorites is the house made pickles, which are so freshly pickled that they are still holding onto their former life as a cucumber. The pickle faces quite an identity crisis of sorts. His crisp crunch and cucumber aftertaste tells him he is a cucumber, but his delicate yet punchy vinaigrette tang tells him he is a pickle. However, in his confusion and mourning for his former life as a cucumber, the pickle seems not to care anymore. For the pickle knows he is art. This gives me strength. But these beautifully executed pickles are but a small fraction of flavors present in a bold mosaic of taste. Each bite provide you with a new combination of flavorful elements which render a novel sensory experience. I often sit alone by myself and take my time trying to process the complexity of each and every bite & my failed marriage. The crispness of the falafel complimented with the soft savory feta cheese is one of many epic combinations you can expect with any given bite. And I have not even mentioned the pita yet! These bad boys are home made. You can actually watch these artisan crafted pitas rising into existence in the brick oven. I typically get pita on the side scoop the contents of my bowl into it. I often think of the pita as the vessel for the flavors of the other ingredients, much like how marriage is supposed to be the vessel for happiness and fulfillment. But make no mistake, these pitas do still taste delicious on their own! Their oven-warmed fluffy texture will make any pita lover feel a joy reminiscent of a time where they could feel anything but numbness. Overall this is hands down one of the best restaurants in the area. The flavors are inexplicably complex and artsy enough to satisfy any foodie. The service is quick and fast; so it's great for families and single mothers who took custody of the kids. Overall I have nothing but positivity towards this establishment. It really keeps me going."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Must go.   Great place.  Excellent vibe. Great service.

I finally decided I earned a trip here after I got news I had passed the bar exam.The space itself is gorgeous and the service is top notch. Our server was busy, but was sure to acknowledge us as soon as we sat down to let us know he'd be with us shortly. He spent lots of time discussing the menu, making recommendations, and talking through the wine list with me. As a wine lover who's always trying to learn more, I loved this aspect of it. I gave him my price point, some chosen regions/varietals, and he brought me a bottle based on the discussion, which was still something new and interesting (I wanted to be a little adventurous). Still, for the price point I wasn't wild about it. I've had bottles half that price at restaurants that I'm way more into. My boyfriend had ordered a beer since he isn't a wine drinker. Still, the server poured him a glass of wine (without asking) & continued to top it off as he returned to the table. Ultimately this wasted a perfectly good glass of wine on someone who felt like he had to drink it and who would've been perfectly happy with the beer he liked very much. Who wants to waste wine?! Surely not me.At our server's suggestion, we got the thick cut bacon and lobster fritters to start. The bacon really was the highlight of the meal. We then split a ribeye. They cut it for us, which was a nice touch. We had the creamed corn and the mashed potato sides. I was really looking forward to the jalapeno creamed corn. I love some spice, and the server raved about it. it was fine, but nothing remarkable.We had the baked alaska for dessert, again at our server's insistence. I'm not a dessert person, but it was pretty good. It's a sad day when I like the dessert more than the steak and mashed potatoes (2 of my all time favorite foods).For a normal night out, not a bad meal, but for a special occasion and high expectations, the food was very mediocre."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Oh my god!!!\\nIke's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings!!\\nSoooooo goooood!!!! \\nIt tasted a bit too saucy but it tasted perfect and better with coconut rice.\\nSo make sure to order coconut rice on the side.No wonder Pok Pok chef  once said \\"These wings basically pay our mortgage,\\"  He also said the recipe was perfected by Pok Pok's first employee, Vietnam native Ich \\"Ike\\" Truong, thus \\"Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings\\".Thank you Ike!!"},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is very busy throughout the day and you can order ahead using their app. I went in around 4:30 and ordered a green goddess bowl and the love alive smoothie both were delicious and I live their ginger Nama shoyu sauce gave my bowl just the right amount of flavor.

After a year living in Delaware, OH I found myself craving a gyro and knew of no place to find one. I quick search turned up the OPA Grill & Tavern, so we decided to check it out.\\nService was pretty mediocre. There were two servers for four, maybe five tables, so they weren't too busy. The wait staff wasn't bad, they just didn't seem to care.I ordered a gyro with onion rings, my wife ordered a salad with gyro meet. To me a gyro is meat, lettuce, tomato, onion and tzatziki on a soft, warm, grilled pita. My pita was dried and crunchy. They added banana peppers and feta (which was nice) but there was no tzatziki. If it was there I could neither see it, nor taste it. Also the portion of meat was significantly less than I would get at nearly any gyro shop.The onion rings were decent, battered rather than breaded, which is how I like them. My wife's salad was alright as well, the veggies were cut in to rather large chunks, but whatever, that's not a huge deal.Everything was \\"okay\\" so on the food (and probably on the service too) I'd give it 3 stars, but my biggest problem was the price.A gyro, onion rings, salad, and one soda came to $25. The same meal at Acropolis in Clintonville (where I used to go before moving to Delaware) costs $15... for better food.So while it wasn't bad, it certainly wasn't worth the price."},{"name":"Aloha Asian Bistro & Sushi","address":"550 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"i just had to update my review.

It had a perfect view of the water, great food and amazing staff. I'll start off with a special shout out to Cole, our server. He went above and beyond to help us in every way possible: drinks, food and even some recommendations on where the locals go to have fun. We were a group of 6 and we all love seafood so this was def the place for us. I started off with some local beer with a fruity aroma. It was delicious. For food, we just ordered a bunch of shareable plates. Fresh oysters of the day, fried oysters, mussels, maple shrimp, lobster and of course a\\nSide of salad. You know the oysters are going to be fresh when they don't have all the varieties, and boy Was i right. Oysters in Vancouver are just simply amazing. I'm not a fan of fried oysters and I didn't like it here either, but that's just me. Shrimp yum, maple syrup yuuuummmm, so it didn't come to a surprise to all of us that the maple shrimp was possibly the best thing we ate. This was actually a complimentary plate from Cole, again, amazing customer service. Mussels were in this onion broth that was so amazing! Then came our grand finale, the lobster! Semi cracked so it was easy to eat, with a cup of melted butter to dip. Let's just say we devoured the whole thing. Salad was a good fresh dish to sway us away from seafood.

Only thing I liked was the noodles, I couldn't finish the other dishes because of how salty it was; it made my mouth hurt really bad.

We decided to take some time away from this restaurant because the last two times we went they butchered the chimichura steak, my wife one visit sent it back 3 times because it was cooked wrong twice before.  With that said we decided to give it another shot tonight and we found a 45 minute wait at 5:30pm...not unheard of for a Friday night so we waited.  Once we got a table we were told we would have two servers tonight, we thought \\"fantastic\\"!Well my wife and I ordered the chimichura steak, my wife wanted medium, i wanted medium rare.  The steaks both came out wrong, both were blood rare and not even close!  My wife's steak was so bad it was almost laughable, the reason i say that is that the chimichura dish is a sliced steak dish so you would think the chef would notice a \\"medium\\" order went out almost blood rare.  Well, no one caught the issue.We sent the steaks back and waited, the server apologized and we were content until the manager brought our the new order.  This time my wife's steak was rare, mine was well done and the whole night was pretty much ruined.  Our 6 year old was already done with his meal and my wife and I decided to just exchange dishes so that we could eat and get out of there.The manager came back one more time with a free appetizer card, it was an awkward exchange.  She kind of just tossed the card on the table.  How can a $5 to $10 card make up for the $52 in bad steak we had to endure?  Didn't seem like a fair exchange.  We decided to order another round of drinks (water and a coke) and let my son finish.  Turns out our server never came back!!!!!  BTW we had two servers so it makes the lack of follow up even worse if you ask me.  The manager came back one more time and we explained how the chefs have constantly got our orders wrong for months.  We told her we used to be regulars and really enjoyed the place, she didn't care!  She truly, honestly gave zero craps.  When we got the bill the server ran my card and then said \\"oh you had $10 in rewards, i didn't know if you wanted to use them so i didn't\\"!  My wife and i were appalled!  We had $10 off and you didn't even ask me if we wanted to use it!?!?!?!?  What is that!?!?!?!bottom line - don't go here.

We were limited to their $49/person private function menu, so I had their lobster bisque and their 7oz filet mignon with sides of broccoli and mashed potato.The food is good. But it's more like Outback Steakhouse good. A steakhouse that charges $49/person per meal needs to be GREAT, not just good. Yes, I'm being picky-- but when a restaurant charges as much as Mitchell's does, they need to be better.A truly great lobster bisque is made with a whole lobster, the head and brains and all. The lobster bisque here tasted like just cream with pink food coloring and 3 tiny pieces of pre-packaged lobster craw meat thrown in after the fact. I've had better lobster bisque in the buffet line of a Brazilian bbq. Why do I think they use pre-packaged lobster claw meat? Because their lobster dishes all clearly say \\"Caribbean lobster\\", which do not have claws. I'm guessing they get their Caribbean lobster as just the tail, and the claw meat comes from elsewhere. The steak was tender and plainly but well seasons with salt and pepper. But aside from the fact that it was likely tenderized via wet aging, it didn't taste any better than a filet that I can buy from Sam's club for $11.99 per pound and grill at home. Also, I ordered my steak medium rare, and it came out medium well. Once again, that would be ok at Outback, but not ok at all at a prime steakhouse.The side of broccoli was basically just pre-cut pre-packaged broccoli that was boiled and served with a side of bernaise sauce. The sauce was good, but the presentation of the broccoli was unacceptable. When you get bulk pre-cut broccoli from wholesale, the broccoli pieces are all cut rather unevenly... some pieces are 3x the size of others. And this is what we got at Mitchell's. I wish they'd cut the broccoli pieces all equally. I ended up getting 1 humongous piece of broccoli on my plate while my dinner companions got 3 smaller pieces. Once again, this might be ok at a cheaper restaurant, but not somewhere like this. The side of mashed potato had the consistency of store bought powdered potato and was flavored with just butter. They didn't even bother to add parsely.  Lastly, we ordered cheesecake TO GO, and we were brought warm chocolate melting cake on a plate. When we reiterated that we wanted our dessert to go, the waitress rolled her eyes at us and gave us the same warm chocolate melting cake with vanilla ice cream (already half melted) on top to go. It being 80 degrees outside, the ice cream was completely melted before we even got in our car. Good thing work paid for this dinner, because I would never pay $50 per person for something of this quality on my own."},{"name":"Hat Yai","address":"605 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Tried this after going several times to their original location. Great service, friendly staff, and most importantly their food is delicious. Fried chicken is fantastically crispy, with a beautiful coating of spices (mostly coriander).

Gino was very accommodating and have to say his service was prompt and very courteous.Victor, tossed the pasta and seafood like a true chef but more importantly, the Fra Diavolo was prepared to perfection with a spicy kick to it and the shrimp was tender and sweet - Chef Ramsay would be proud!!I liked the concept of the pasta served in the pan - keeps the food warm.  The place is really small and suspect the place usually has a line so I'm glad we didn't have to wait.

Get the canned seitan from Hong Kong market. Don't worry you don't have to cook it or even slice it up really. Just slather it in $1 bbq sauce from dollar tree And plop it on the plate. Buy firm tofu, drain any water out of it and cook it till it's super dry breaking up with spatula don't add any oil or anything to give it an eggy fee. Think dry crumbles. You can get a similar. \\nEffect by actually cooking scrambled eggs for 8 minutes to long on high heat. Then dump a lot of mustard powder on. Basically make it taste like mustard. Ok from that one block of tofu, throw about 1/3 on the plate.Toast, you know Texas toast you can buy at stop n shop. Make sure it's mushy. Put some Daiya cheese on the plate somewhere, I guess. Another side? Like home fries. Honestly I'm racking I brain I don't remember.... I don't think I got them, collards. Whatever it was I don't even remember I'm not saying this for effect. I don't. \\nWalk the halls in  Double Tree until you find a discarded room service tray with a microscopic bottle of Tabasco sauce. Use that to try to cover up the garbage taste of the canned seitan and sour \\"eggs\\" it won't be enough.  Coffee? You know. Kids are getting more picky about coffee these days with taste freshness and roasted dates. Let's e reto and remind them of what WWII era coffee was all about. You can scoop this from the dollar tree too, or upgrade and get the free coffee at Herb Chambers Toyota. TDLR;\\nFor my brother who came to visit & works in kitchens. He was too polite to say since I paid but he wasn't happy. I don't remember what he got, nether does he. When he saw us get the vegan things I think it sort of confirmed a bias that vegan paying more for something objectivity worse. It isn't and shouldn't be, but  I can't imagine the management empathizing what it is like to want to eat vegan bbq breakfast over anything else on the menu. If they did it wouldn't be so bad.  I don't like to think some restaurants assume vegans are ok with eating bad food but it's either that or this place truly can't do better anymore and that sucks.  The lady  got the same thing as me (we never do but we're both feeling it feels like something we don't make at home. )  Neither of us wanted to eat the eggs or seitan. I am not an overly picky eater and was seriously trying to Imagine if I only imagined Allston diner being good before. After all we almost never go because we go because there was always an hour wait.  I thought I was more picky. I imagined cool fun staff rightfully moved on to better paying jobs I don't expect most people plan on being servers forever. If they did good, I'm\\nGlad. I heard it wasn't quite that.  Maybe the cool tables after all these years were getting gross and there just wasn't anyone in the mood to make any more. \\nI did get a cool Vincent VanGogh mug and brother got a Ferrari mug so at least some mismatched mugs. Maybe not everything changed... idk. Just not sure.  This does feel like a blow tot the character of Allston and really, if Allston diner was hard to go to before, now it's not Even worth the effort if I could get a seat without waiting. ... Oh your paying though? How bout brunch at Whole Heart? it's a Tuesday? I'll pay for the Lyft to VegGal then. I figured it was just a fluke and the summer kids were out Boston gets slow. Naw, it's cause it sucks now and nobody wants to go. I didn't know it was under new management. I have  very metal looking T-shirt which I'm going to stop wearing I got from Allston Diner of 2 cups of coffee being poured into a skulls eye sockets. Based on the current vibe I'd think I lost my mind if they were selling that here. Hostess at VegGal saw it one time and told me how much she loved Allston Diner. Sad to think I can't imagine her saying that now. \\nI'd be sad to see this place go but think this needs\\nTo be a wake up call. I thought it was a huge damn shame how the Sunset got sold and then completely mismanaged so bad it before it's abrupt closure\\nLeaving a huge gap in Allston and being one of the places I could take anyone visiting from out of town (grandmothers, sweaty alcoholic comedians, sales\\nReps) to and they would enjoy. Allston diner could be a go to in the morning with similar results.

I left my Yelp addiction in 2011 because I started to feel that a lot of the new Yelpers were trolling on a business and quality reviews started to slow causing the rest of us to get a bad name. Here at Kukai I got to witness the customers/ fellow yelpers that gives Yelp a bad name. Last Wednesday, was the second time coming to Kukai. The boy and I decided that we would share a ramen and a whole bunch of small plates. A couple, lets call them, Tara M and Eric S., sat next to us. Our ramen came and we started to eat it. Our small plates didn't arrive yet but our server informed us that the small plates section was run by one person who just received tons of orders all at once. She assured us that it was coming and apologized. She went to the couple next to us and told them the same thing even though they hadn't been waiting as long as we had. I looked over to the small plates guy, who had tickets spewing out of the printer almost comical like. Coming from a restaurant background I could empathize. After a little while, I was surprised to see most of the tickets were gone. The lady with the purple hair loaded up the trays while all the staff were helping distribute the last of the orders. We had finally received our small plates but we had Tara looking over to us which made my boyfriend a little uneasy. Picking up on her hangry vibe a gentlemen came up to her and asked her if everything was alright. She shouted to him \\"They gave away my food.\\" Did she think we took her food? Does she realize we could have ordered similar items? We are after all dining at the same restaurant. I realized we should pack up and leave, once i heard her say \\"they need to get their shit together,\\" I did not want to make my fame on Youtube as the girl that got beaten up for stealing fried chicken. lol We asked for our check and packed up whatever what was left. I don't know what happened next but experiencing just that small portion of Tara and Eric's bad attitude I have to apologize to the Kukai staff for them. NOT ALL YELPERS ARE LIKE THIS. Anyway review on the food,Takoyaki- Needs to be eaten while hot/ warm. The first time we waited till our ramen came and it wasn't as delicious as when we ate it warm and toasty the second time. If you have never had a takoyaki before imagine a savory octopus filled donut hole. Chicken Karaage- Japanese fried chicken is also delicious warm. It comes with spicy mayo but I like it by itself. It is moist and tender in the inside. Garlic Ramen- Very flavorful. I love garlic and it definitely has a rich flavor to it.

I ordered a chicken salad, and couldn't believe how unappetizing it looked when I cracked it open.  This salad consisted only of cheap iceberg lettuce, freezing cold salsa, and a few lumps of chicken that varied in size and color.  Zero seasoning or flavor of any kind, nor was there any cheese, sour cream, guac, dressing.  It looked like something that sat in a college kid's fridge for six weeks and was forgotten.  Also, this abomination plus a water was $13.  I stopped into this food court before driving back home after multiple doctor's appointments - I was starving and had an hour long drive before going back to work, and I STILL threw this plate out after two bites.Seeing the overwhelmingly poor reviews on here confirms the low quality I experienced wasn't an outlier, and reinforces why it's useful to look at reviews in the first place.

LONG line, and when we finally got up to order, we had to repeat the order three times to get it strait in their heads. Why they don't write it down when it's so busy I don't know. We ordered two coffees- one just a drip coffee, and doughnuts. TWENTY FIVE MINUTES LATER we were still waiting for doughnuts and coffee. When we approached the staff to ask after just the coffee - were told repeatedly, oh, we're working on that. I said, \\"Mine is just drip. Is that done to order?\\" Oh, no, turns out they just had to hand me a mug. What the heck!? And finally, FINALLY, the doughnuts arrive and they are so greasy, the grease literally dripping down our fingers. This is not appetizing, just gross. In a city full of outstanding coffee and doughnut places, not sure the appeal of this place."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Fun drinks and an awesome menu, especially the pimento cheese burger.

I bet it will taste a lot better for the price you are paying.*Honey glazed shrimp with walnuts: it's not the typical shrimp and walnut you get from a Chinese restaurant, it came with ONLY 6 shrimps and a lot of walnuts for ~25.88. Yes only 6 shrimps!!* Whole Peking duck: this was expensive AF for what they gave us. The skin was not crispy at all and the dough was very sticky. $88.88 for the whole duck :) *Salted fish and diced chicken: this was the most decent dish from all we ordered. ~20.88* Crispy pork: meh ~21.88 just a normal sweet and sour pork. Just average.*Baby bak Choi : $13.88. it's a just a regular veggies boiled with water and oil. Like. No salt no flavor no nothing. The good thing is that they washed it pretty clean.Service was just bad. The duck and the BBQ platter came out and after we were done, the server started cleaning our table when the rest of the food we ordered were not even out.

OCI's educational programs are incredibly comprehensive and thorough, my classmates have gone on to working in restaurants, catering, food writing and recipe creation, or started their own businesses.  I started the program unable to hold a knife correctly and graduated less than 2 years later, well versed in wine, culinary management including marketing, costing, ethics, and confident in the kitchen and my ability to turn my dreams into a reality.  Even after I graduated they were just a phone call away and the friendships and connections I made through OCI led me to owning the catering company I do today.If you're on the fence about registering as a student at OCI, know that this school is so much more than the educational programs they offer.

The tea was an additional 3 dollars.I have never in my life been so disgusted by food. I went her expecting a mediocre quality Chinese buffet. I walked in with low expectations and walked out feeling like I needed to vomit. As an example.. The egg rolls were completely disgusting .. Soggy and I couldn't tell what was inside them... crispy isn't something they seem to understand here everything that was fried seemed to have been soaked to sogginess afterwards.This Chinese restaurant managed to mess up .. noodles and rice. The noodles were soggy and cold ... the rice was mushy and hardly fried. I don't know what these guys are thinking or how they have been in business for as long as they  have.When I left the restaurant without tipping the owner/manager made a snotty comment ... First its a buffet .. no one waited on me.. I would still normally have left a few bucks, but I only had one plate of food that was so bad I couldn't eat and I was already charged over 10 dollars.

I called and made reservations about 3 weeks in advance. After reading other Yelp reviews, I decided that maybe a quieter table was best for my party of 10. The host.. Kristen told me they would try their best to accommodate my request. Kristen also called me the day before to confirm my reservation.  I asked her about the table and her response was \\" this is a popular restaurant, so we won't know until the day of.\\" FINE. \\nI showed up on Saturday and used their complimentary valet. I've worked in restaurants in the past, and i know that the host is the FIRST impression of the restaurant. I wasn't very impressed. I was greeted properly and I told the host that all but one person was here. There was an African American woman at the host stand ( I was told she is the assistant GM). She told me my table was ready, but KB doesn't seat incomplete parties. FINE. My friend didn't want to hold us up (she was stuck in traffic), so she decided to go to Krog Market until we were finished. I told this same host the news, and I was told that my table WAS NOT ready. I told her that I was told it was ready, and that we were ready to be seated. She then told me that because I requested a quiet table the wait is typically longer.. She had a very nice nasty tone, and by this point I was extremely upset. After waiting even longer, I told my friends we could go somewhere else. The other host came by and offered to take us to our table. The table was downstairs...and I loved how quiet and intimate it was. Upstairs is really noisy, and cluttered. If you have a larger group I would suggest a table downstairs. Ron was a fun server! My group was full of personality and he kept up with our jokes . I wasn't completely blown away by the service, but I never went without anything. I had the El Burro ($12) which had tequila, a ginger based house syrup and other things I can't remember. I felt like the cocktail was missing something! A friend at the table ordered the same thing and suggested squeezing lime inside. It helped!FOOD.\\nI started with the sonoma cheese jack fritters ($10). They looked amazing, but they were extremely salty. I sent them back and got the lobster fritters ($16) instead. They were juicy, crispy and delicious! This was a hit at the table.\\nI ordered the 10oz ribeye ($39) with mashed potatoes ($9.50), and truffle butter ($3.25) as an entree. The sides are big enough to share, so everyone ordered different sides and we all shared. The steak was juicy and the truffle butter sent me swinging! The sides I sampled were the creamed corn, brussel sprouts with country ham and my mashed potatoes. The brussel sprouts were soo rich.. WAY TOO MUCH BUTTER.  The creamed corn was amazing and easily my favorite side. Ron brought out my cake and put candles on top for me. ( I didn't ask him to do that).

The BBQ short rib was soooo good, when it comes to Korean BBQ I expect the juicy marinated sauce to blend with the meat and, ugh! So good! The Korean pork style pork dumpling soup was good, can't say much about how special it is other than my love for rice cakes. Soup base is a bit bland (I don't know much about the broth but I'm assuming it's an ox bone broth? It was bland, had to add a little bit of salt and it was a game changer).The Japchae was nice and chewy, just how I expect how Japchae would taste. Overall, everything was delicious and I'm willing to go back for sure. It can be a bit pricey, but for the portion we're being served, I say it's worth it :)"},{"name":"Sam LaGrassa's","address":"44 Province St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Went here recently from a recommendation and wasn't impressed.

The salads were good (and so was the raisin bread.  We should have left after that)  Clinetele is on the extreme older side.  The waiter was nice enough.We were also packed in like sardines.

Luckily they were still able to seat us. We came for the wings but were delighted with everything else. The atmosphere of the entry way and covered outdoor area mixed with the smells from the kitchen really did make us feel like we were on a street in Thailand (aside from the chilly rain). The wings were great, of course. We eat a lot of wings and agreed that the sauce is what makes these wings. It didn't seem like there was anything too special about how they are cooked.

The place is beautifully decorated with a simple modern look. We had to make reservations because it does get a bit busy, but what made this experience so AMAZING was the service we got. I ordered the pear, bacon and Gorgonzola omelette and asked for the pears to not be included. A minute later, Teri, the head chef and owner, came to our table to talk to me. She strongly encouraged me to try the caramelized pears in my omelette claiming that without them the dish wouldn't be the same. She reassured me that if I didn't like it, she would make me a new one from scratch free of charge. I immediately felt like I could trust her. Her goal seemed to be to make my dining experience the best it could be. So I went ahead and gave her my trust. When the omelette arrived, I was in awe. The pear made the dish 100% better and gave it a flavor profile I've simply never experienced. The Gorgonzola and the caramelized pear were perfect compliments, making this simply one of the best omelettes I've ever had. She came back after I had a chance to try and checked in on us. I was so happy I trusted Chef Teri -- her insights were exactly what I needed. The fact that she took time out of what must be an extremely busy kitchen to check in and give me her thoughts on her own creation made this the ultimate experience.

You can only valet there which also gets super crowded, or park far and take a walk - better yet just uber.Once inside the place was blaring the latest music you would hear on 95.5 the beat along with some alternative music sprinkled in. The bars were incredibly crowded and a little hard to get the bartenders attention, prob took about a few minutes to get our drinks served. Their bathrooms were surprisingly clean considering the large crowd that they were serving, so I was impressed with that. The dance floor was pretty big and honestly this place is just made for that... dancing, at least after midnight when I came in. One word that would probably describe this place would be fratastic. The crowd was more for those who were more interested in drinking like a fish and sweat dancing the night away with hundred other strangers being all up in your space.

You'll want to get there early and get in line before they open, around 7:45 (I know that's super early, but it's so worth it)! They have a huge variety of food and they're all spectacular and fresh out of the kitchen.

Kale Salad, Dive Fries, Mac of Cheese, Leg & Thigh (braised chicken with awesome lemongrass mushroom sauce and mixed with ginger bok choy and we had their Hanger pan-seared beef with the Yukon potatoes, perfectly cooked and still crispy green beans.

We heard that the Tonkotsu ramen was the way to go here, so 5 (out of 7) of us ordered that, including myself.First of all, the ramen noodle is definitely top notch.  Best noodle so far and it was cooked perfectly.  The broth, on the other hand, was extremely disappointing.  Came with a single slice of pork, it was basically shoyu (soy sauce) flavored broth.  Perhaps it was an off night because I've read so many good reviews of this broth....What I should do is steal some of their noodles and give it to Yuzu to cook with their kakuni ramen, that's a 6 star combo :)They kinda messed up on the order too.  3 of our 5 tonkotsu ramen was entered as a shoyu ramen, so they had to watch us eat our ramen while waiting for theirs.A nice surprise was that they have happy hour all night on the bar section (Thursday night, not sure if this is for all weekdays or not).

Ladies, never listen to your bf when he sounds overly confident. I gave it 2 stars because of the following: Location: it's close to the Ga Dome. I don't live near downtown, so it was a little bit out of the way. Parking: maybe we didn't know where to park, but it was kinda weird. We ended up just parking on the street. Luckily, it was on a Sunday so we didn't have to pay for parking. Staff: it's weird that they didn't have a hostess since they seems to be super busy. Guests were just standing around not really knowing what was going on. After maybe 15 mins of waiting by the door with everyone else, someone came and tried to sort out the mess of people blocking the entrance. There were tables, but they were all dirty, so we had to wait longer than expected. Maybe they just had a shortage of staff that day. Either way, horrible customer service. Food: the portion size was ridiculously small for the price. We ordered the 2 meats combo and it literally came out with 2-3 pieces of each meat. Ummmm... What happened to the rest of my food? We ended up ordering more appetizers because I was still hungry. I really like the brisket, but that's the only thing that was good. Everything else was ok.

I was amazed watching 2 year olds making their own pancakes table side on hot stoves, but also mortified when I saw babies standing on chairs throwing spatulas around while teeter tottering over hot bubbling pancake mix.  I saw one child dip his hands in batter and run to a giant window and smear handprints down the glass.  Of course the parents didn't scold him or clean up after him and the mix dried on the glass after the hour I was there.I felt really bad for the servers that have to deal with sticky nasty babies and their bad parents all day long and I could tell they hated their jobs because when I would ask questions like \\"do I cook my eggs at the table too?\\" They seemed annoyed because they probably get asked that a lot.  But I also don't want to feel bad because my server thinks my questions are stupid and hates the environment they work in.  The server was real sassy and seemed annoyed at everything going on.I had fun making my pancakes and might come here again if I was trying to impress some older children that have all their motor skills and hand eye coordination up to date.

Ordered the corn dog shrimp, chicken fried steak, and flank steak. Every entree came with a side. We ordered rosemary fries and Mac n cheese as sides. Yum yum yum! Drinks were stiff and complimented the food nicely. Our party agreed we wouldn't order the corn dog shrimp again but it was nice to try. The entrees were out of this world and the best chicken fried steak we've ever had. It was a perfect balance of crispy, peppery, and tender.

Isabella was super friendly as I walked in and greeted me right away. When I got there wasn't much of a line but no more than 3 mins after I got here what do you know a long line behind me. Not surprised with being featured on Triple D, with that being said it was a bit of a wait to just put your order. From what I heard from one of the owners who came out and started talking to some regulars that were seated next to me, they have seen a 200% increase in sales since being on the show. So you can clearly tell between the servers and other staff they are still trying to get used to the high volume of customers from being on the show. The only reason I gave this place 3 stars was because of the amount of food that you get for the price, big price little amount of food. I ordered the nonna's traditional with polenta, the mix between the two were good but nothing to rave about and I loveeeeeeee  me some meatballs but these were just ok .

I had a great day in the Pearl planned and decided in advance to have lunch at Bluehour.  I'd heard about it for years and a former co-worker was a bartender there and had some crazy stories so I had to check it out.  What I didn't anticipate was that it would be closed on Saturday at lunchtime.  Everett Street Bistro became my Plan B.  I remembered generally positive Yelp reviews, but didn't jot down any recommended items to order since I didn't plan on eating there this time around.  So I agree with other posters that the place is a charming French-style bistro.  Small tables close together and a beautiful stamped metal ceiling.  It was a sunny day and there were a handful of tables outside as well.  I was greeted and seated right away by one of the large windows and my server was great throughout.What I didn't enjoy at all was my meal.  I wanted the quiche of the day, but they didn't offer one (or perhaps they ran out).  I chose their Nueske quiche instead (apple smoked bacon and marscapone cheese) and it just didn't taste right.  It was a huge serving and I lost all interest in eating it about a quarter of the way through.  The mesclun green salad with herb vinaigrette on the side was basic, but fine and I enjoyed sipping water from the Bee glass.  I think it is a case of ordering the wrong thing and since I was dining alone I didn't get the vicarious thrill of someone else enjoying their meal.

At that point I'd been holding my piss for 20+ minutes. If I could give one piece of advice, either get rid of the key system or open up a second restroom because that was definitely not okay, coming from someone who's pretty damn patient.Bathroom issue aside, I will definitely be coming back but I just needed to get that out there that the (1) bathroom isn't exactly easily accessible."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I ate here during a rare visit to Portland.

I asked about fermented pork dishes like I've eaten in Northern Thailand but they didn't have any. Among the waiter's suggestions of substitutes was Kaeng Hang Leh (description: \\"Northern Thai sweet pork belly and pork shoulder curry with ginger, palm sugar, turmeric, tamarind, Burmese curry powder and pickled garlic. Rich and exotically spiced, a Chiang Mai classic with Burmese origins.\\"), which I chose. When the dishes arrived, we thought we had ordered way too much food, but we managed to eat every bite!The wings were more like candy than real food, although tasty if you like sugar (unfortunately I do!). Som Tam was fine. BUT...ta...da...the KANG LANG LEH was phenomenal! I loved the tastes in this curry. At first I was leary of the thick bit of fat on one piece of the pork belly, but it was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth. The texture was superb.

It was blow my mind delicious. We drove all the way from Tampa to visit this place after seeing it sponsored on Instagram and we were not disappointed. We started out with an appetizer of French fries topped with spicy krab, eel sauce, and spicy mayo. To die for. The spicy mayo had a little bit more of a kick than normal spicy mayos and it just elevated it to the next level.\\nFor our entrees we got the classic sushi burrito and a poke pizza. The amount of raw fish I eat is usually pretty slim. I'm a huge tempura person, however, the fish was so fresh it just melted in your mouth and I found myself wanting more. The burrito came with tempura and raw that merged together to spark your taste buds. The pizza had its own little roll as the crust and was just as delicious as everything else. Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. All our food came out very quickly and well put together.  I'd say the only downside was the drink situation. Only canned soda and no fountains which can get pricy.

EVERYONE WHO GAVE THIS PLACE MORE THAN 1 STAR OWES ME A DOLLAR!!! The last time I was this disappointed was when I went to the Jay-Z concert at Chastain and it was rained out!! Smh \\nI will start with what I did like:\\n1. Good food scores from the last 3-4 years posted ranging from 100 to 92, A.\\n2. We got there at 753pm on 7/5/2015 the hostess advised us that they stop bringing out new food around 830-845 and shut it down at 9pm. \\n3. The customer service was attentive, our waitress cleared the table quickly, replenished drinks and napkins quickly, and had a good personality. She was tipped rather well. \\n4. The presentation of the food was appetizing and the bar was well maintained and kept clean even towards closing.\\n5. The crepe station was good, the Spanish lady making the crepes had a nice personality and catered to my o.c.d-ness. \\n6. You don't see children screwing around at the buffet trying to fix their own plates, it's frowned upon there and I like that. Kids have no idea how they can cross contaminate and what good public hygiene is, shit some idiotic adults don't either smhTHINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: \\n1. THE DAMN NEAR $70 CHECK!!!\\n2. FOR $70 for 2 adults eating, I don't expect the restroom to look like the god damn port authority restroom in new york!!! \\n3. FOR $70 I EXPECT TO SEE EVERYTHING ADVERTISED ON THE MENU ONLINE ON THAT DAMN BUFFET!!!\\n4. FOR $70 I expect to see modern and up to date tables, chairs, toilets that flush on their own, hand washing stations with senors that turn the water on as soon as it senses your hand, cutlery, plates, drinkware, and the tongs used to get the food replaced with new ones once they get groudy and caked up with food. That's not a lot to ask for considering the house was PACKED AND SOME PEOPLE WERE DROPPING $200-$300 PER FAMILY!!! That's not a lot to ask for when I've been various cheaper restaurants and extremely expensive restaurants AND THEY ALL HAVE AT LEAST 3/4s of what I request.\\n5. THE FOOD WAS NOT ALL THAT FOR $70 FUCKING DOLLARS!!! I've been on cruise ships that had a better buffets than this. $70 is a 1/4 of what an average 3 day cruise ticket is!!!! When I say the food isn't all that, I ate a 1/4 of a full plate of hot food, sushi, salad, and dessert. When we got home me and my date had the runs... yes graphic I know, but hey at least at ruths chris the food stayed in my body for at least 24 hours. Hell even at a most mexican restaurants stayed in my body for 24 hours!!! Your stomach and ass will punish you for eating here!!\\n6. When the check came me and my dudes eyes were yo-yo'ing like WHAT THE FUCK?!! Online it per some of you bogus ass yelpers lunch is $17 and dinner is $25. we could've gone somewhere a hell of a lot better than this for $70 fucking dollars!!! I couldve gone to thaicoon on Monday for happy hour sushi and got just as much food for less than what we spent here and went to cheesecake factory for dessert. \\n7. The desserts need work man. Like dude starbucks has a better line up for sweets than this place! I have posted pictures of all my claims and if management reads this I would be interested in some sort of refund. WILL I COME BACK? HELL INFACTICALLY NO!!! I wouldn't come back here for a free meal!! This is by far some of the worst sushi I've ever eaten. I totally feel guilty for getting my date hyped up to go here and be let down like this. Smh Those who read this review with thoughts of coming here don't get duped out of $70 plus tip like we did. Not being racist or bigot but if it wasn't for race loyalty this atrocious restaurant wouldn't survive!! I saw 3 groups of caucasians, me and my date, the rest were Asian and like I said it was a full house! My best friend said this place wasn't all that I should've listened to her instead of reading some of these 3 star and up yelp reviews!! I'm extremely bitter about this dining experience."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We came here on a Saturday morning because we didn't realize they only serve brunch on Sundays, but we still did a solid job sampling a significant amount of food.  We arrived when they opened at 11 and had no problems getting a spot for 2 at the bar so we could watch football while we ate.  Note: There are two bars, one inside and one just off the patio, and both spots have only 1 TV.  So when you see that this place \\"has TV\\", that's what it means.I ordered the garlic bulbs for myself since my eating partner didn't like the stuff.  Very good!  The roasted bulbs are served whole so peeling can get a bit messy, but the goat cheese, roasted red peppers, and soft toasted French bread slices are absolutely delicious.  It's definitely a filling appetizer for only one person, but thanks to my inherent fat kid powers, I managed just fine.For the meal we split the chicken sandwich (delicious, but VERY saucy and messy) with sweet potato fries on the side (crispy, salty, and delicious, and the dipping sauce was great).  We also split a side of the mac n' cheese (pretty good) and the grits (oh my holy god they did a good job with those grits).  The cornbread muffins on the side were pretty good.  The free popcorn while we waited was tasty but a little too salty.For dessert we HAD to have the skillet apple pie.  Oh my god, this was heaven.  If you get nothing else, you MUST get this.  It was the perfect end to a delicious meal.The only reason for a loss of a star was due to the service - maybe it was because we sat at the bar, but the service was a little slow, and at one point our waitress straight-up forgot part of our order (though she was nice enough to comp us for it!).We had a couple of drinks, nothing special, and some cappuccinos to round out our meal.  Overall - very delicious, would eat here again!"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Its a wing place. So, I was excited. I waited to try it out till I read some reviews and felt confident it was worth the wait. \\nLets just say I had high expectations because Portland needs a good wing place. \\nI left not really satisfied and not really impressed. \\nThe wings are soaked in a brine combining ingredients in the following order. Water, sugar, and other secret ingredients. The taste of sugar permeats throughout. \\nIn attempt to be both sweet and spicy. They then add a sugary sauce with some chilis. Its almost like a chinese Red Chili sauce you can purchase in a bottle. They watered it down and added more sugar. Both the mild and the spicy versions disappoint with this flavoer of almost there but not quite because of the power of sugar and more sugar. \\nI would give three stars just for being open but the explaination and the attituded of the person behind the counter all three times as I asked for some clairification was beyond compare. \\nThe wings were overly sweet and salty. The skin was tough and difficult to chew because there was so much sugar basically carmelized inside and out of the wings. Their claim of large wings and complete wings being the justification for the expense. It just doesnt fly. The first two sections have very little meat if any. So, you are paying for Large Tri sectioned wings with only really the end of the wings being left to enjoy. \\nI dont get the raving reviews. Not worth the money. I gave it two stars because it was open and the food came out of the kitchen fairly quickly. \\nI guess if it is late night and you are hungry it is food."},{"name":"Meson Sandwiches","address":"6622 Eagle Watch Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I was going to wait to post a review to see if I got a response from the business...

There's actually a Pok Pok location in New York, but it's just a bit far from where I live. So naturally, I decided flying from New York to Portland for Pok Pok would just be easier. The place looks like a shack that just added outdoor seating and some counters to maximize the number of customers. The waits seemed pretty crazy, and people had already been waiting up to 1.5 hours. We managed to snag some seats at the bar, so we actually ended up waiting less than 10 minutes. Cheat the system.We got the famous fish sauce wings, the Pok Pok Special (half chicken with green papaya salad), as well as the Kaeng Hang Leh (Thai pork shoulder and pork belly curry). The wings were super messy, but quite delicious. We got them spicy, and it really was actually nice and spicy, and not dulled down one bit. The Pok Pok special was fairly standard, as the chicken tasted sort of like your run-of-the-mill rotisserie, and the green papaya salad was overpoweringly fishy. The Kaeng Hang Leh was super rich and salty, and we got the sticky rice to eat with it, although I think the jasmine rice would have been more appropriate. Nonetheless, it was fairly unique, and we more or less enjoyed everything we got. Service was nice and friendly, and pretty attentive throughout the meal. We got some really good recommendations, and they brought out a ton of napkins and wet wipes when we were fully covered in that Vietnamese fish sauce wing spice. Prices are bit more expensive for Thai food, but considering that these are dishes that can't really be found anywhere nearby, they kinda have the upper hand in this situation.I don't think I would wait an hour plus for it, especially if a good number of the offerings are available across the street at Whiskey Soda Lounge, but if it's your first time in Portland, I would give it a look. The thought is to go for lunch, and get there when it opens, or try to snag seats at the bar."},{"name":"Morton's The Steakhouse","address":"213 SW Clay St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I love steak and I typically order ribeye.

You MUST get the totchos at least once (and throw in a fishbowl LOL), my favorites are the buffalo chicken totchos and the Lanced up and quirky. \\nThey have a phenomenal house salad to which you can add your choice of protein OR opt for a side salad portion with your entree. Other favorites are the chicken chili, the salmon BLT, the Nook wrap. My issue with the Nook is the lack of consistency and unfortunately this lack of consistency shows up in everything. I have been coming to the Nook for years, as it is my neighborhood pub but lately have not been as impressed. The service is not as great as it used to be and the food is not as consistent. Also be prepared for a moody bartender. I love the salmon BLT (usually what I order) and appreciate that they cook it perfectly (medium). Sometimes the salmon filet fills the entire bun, other times it does not. Now, I completely understand that not all salmon patties are the same shape and size but shouldn't the kitchen be a little more thoughtful in terms of this. As in, for the sandwich select the filets that fill more of the area on the bun and save the others for the salmon entree? Is that a crazy idea?! It is kinda lame to bite into a sandwich and only get bread. The other entree that has become inconsistent is the ahi tuna salad. It used to be served with the lightly seared tuna sliced and spread beautifully around the salad. The last time I ordered it (empasis on LAST), the tuna was served as a filet and overcooked. Not as wonderful as it used to be.The only reason to go to a regular spot and get a regular food item is because you know what you're getting. It is a comfort. Unfortunately, the Nook doesn't currently have that appeal. :( I believe that if the management wants to, the charming comfort of the Nook can return.

For dinner I ordered a salad and he ordered a burger. Both were good but not something that would bring us back. The best part of the night was the peanut butter pie. This pie was amazing.

The selection is small, but they make each item tasty. Sometimes \\"small\\" can be a good thing instead of being inundated with a bunch of choices.

A perfect bookstore that combines an endless selection of books with a cozy and personal experience.Quality: It is hard to compare Powell's City Of Books to anything else. It simply blows your standard neighborhood bookstore away. And even the big chains that slowly have disappeared aren't on the same level. They have mastered having a huge selection and a giant store, but still feeling like an intimate book experience. Tons of options, plenty of reading spaces, and of course a coffee shop. Everything needed for a day that will go by too quick.\\nQuantity: The store is gigantic and every time I thought I reached the end, I found another hidden room.\\nValue: The book prices were not bad at all, plus they had plenty of discounted and used books.\\nAmbiance: Powell's City Of Books is located in Downtown Portland. From the outside it looks impressive as it occupies an entire city block, but then you realize inside that you also have several levels as well. It is room after room of wall to wall books. Throughout the space are areas to sit and peruse what you have picked up and even an area dedicated to it. The different rooms are color coded and maps are available to help you navigate, it is needed for first timers. They also have a coffee shop in the room furthest from the door.\\nCrowd: The store was packed on Sunday morning. And folks were leaving with bundles of books.\\nService: The staff members I interacted were great and extremely helpful. They keep their staff, which is helpful when instructing guests on how to navigate this labyrinth.\\nParking: It looked like the only option were some nearby parking lots."},{"name":"Round Table Pizza","address":"8120 Number 2 Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Very good and no grease.

The island creek was definitely my favorite because it was meatier and more flavorful than the other three. The other three were definitely a bit more neutral than island creek and was perfect for those who do not like that salty ocean taste that some oysters have.I ordered the salmon pate with oyster sliders and my boyfriend ordered the lobster roe noodles. I literally went to heaven when I took a bite of the slider. The bread is so crispy yet soft and buttery. The fried oyster had that nice smooth crunch too. The salmon pate wasn't anything special.

From the quantity of food, to the pricing, to the service, Pho basil hits every category exceptionally well. Now, I have read other reviews on dishes that I haven't tried yet and I can sorta see why some people would give it a 3 or 4 depending on what they got, but the 5 stars that I am giving is geared towards only the Pad Thai and the Spicy Basil. First off, the quantity of pad thai that this restaurant serves is enormous. For around $10, you get a mountain of pad thai with beansprouts, chopped nuts, your choice of protein, and a wedge of lime. The noodles are nice and soft but do have a slight chew to them, while the nuts and beansprouts add a layer of crunch. I do prefer going with the pork as I find it to be more tender than chicken. One thing I also do is add sriracha to every bite for a nice kick of spice. The spicy basil is also one of my favorites due to its fragrance from the basil leaves and spiciness from the chili/pepper they add in the sauce. I love mixing the rice, which is included with this dish, into the sauce to soak up every bit of flavor. One thing that I do notice about this dish is that it is mainly vegetables even with a protein option. All in all, would I say this is the best Thai dishes I've ever had? Probably not. But considering its location, pricing, and service, Pho Basil is one of my favorites to drop by when I'm craving solid thai food without breaking my wallet."},{"name":"Smoke Ring","address":"309 Nelson St SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Six of us and everyone said they will be back.

This is not in the gentrified part of town but is well worth the trip. Walking up we could smell the wood smoking in the outdoor fireplace and our appetites were churning.\\nWe were early and sat in the bar to begin. Our waiter was perfect-- whatever we wanted he got it. One regular order, one drink of 'I like this but not this' and he came back with a perfect original mix and third drink gave him a recipe which again was prepared perfectly. He knew what choices they had and how to mix them--and this was the waiter, not bartender. We had good vibes about what was to come.\\nThis is a converted warehouse with high ceilings and unfinished, exposed brick walls with wood floors. A nice setting.\\nAPPS-They were all good but the hit was the lobster fritters. Light, tender and delicately cooked.\\nSALADS- the wedge was probably the best ever tasted. This can often be a dull predicable salad; this one was vibrant, clean, fresh and soo tasty. A special of the evening was a mustard green salad with bacon and red onions. It was the table favorite... If you visit and it is available-GET IT...\\nSTEAKS- The dry aged rib eye was cooked to perfection and flavorful, the rib-eye steak Diane was an unusual cut of beef for this dish and it worked better than a filet--this was the best Diane I have tasted. Then the treat. Steak Spinalis, a cut just on top of the rib eye and sold by the ounce. What a treat. It had tremendous flavor, was tender and beautifully marbled. The hit of the evening.\\nSIDES-Spinach was deftly prepared, jalapeno creamed corn was a must try, and I enjoyed the scalloped sweet potatoes with gruyere. This is a different taste but it was very well done and a nice contrast with the fatty meat.\\nDESSERTS-- beautifully prepared but not our favorites. The baked Alaska was pretty and done right but it had pumpkin and I couldn't give it a fair rating. The cinnamon apple cake was the best on the table and would definitely get it again. The S'mores was a chocolate cake with cayenne pepper that was dry and almost a cake mix taste. It was redeemed by a wonderful toasted marshmallow on top that oozed and coasted the cake with a caramel drizzle on the plate\\nSERVICE-WINE-Our service was spot on all night and just the right touch of friendly without being too familiar. The wine selection is limited but has nice items to choose from. As we first sat down we asked if they had a reserve list and were told no. Within a couple of minutes the sommelier arrive and mentioned we had asked and offered her help.--big points on service for the staff to seize the initiative.

Stop dilly dallying! Order now!Okay, you want to read a review? Fine. We've been patrons since day one and it's been 100000% consistent and consistently good since their first day. From a price and delivery standpoint: some of the best you'll ever see. Great prices, solid delivery (they have a great tracking app), very hot food as delivered. Like other reviews you'll see, you do need to be in their service area. Me at home and me at work are stupid close to them so that may come into play re: super hot, super fast delivery. You can put in multiple addresses, which I love, so the me at work and me at home concept can easily fly. On topic: great website input and great service if you make a mistake. A+ all round. And carryout is super easy too. Special note: they allow you to make adjustments on spicy levels. I'm a spice lover and the upper side of spice is not yet spicy enough for me (incredibly tasty tho!) so I suggest going up a spice level than what you're comfortable with elsewhere.Let's talk eats.* General Tso's Chicken -- very tasty. Not enough veg, but overall very very tasty.  Their meats are very delicious. \\n* Eggplant Chicken -- watch me swoon into your arms. Flavors are on point and it's the only one I've had with an admirable amount of veg. Very delicious.\\n* Honey Walnut Shrimp -- the gf will never let me have a bite of hers, it's so delicious and so hers. So I can't speak to how tasty it is, I can just attest to the fact that my girlfriend is obsessed with this dish.\\n* Sesame Chicken -- not my fave comparatively to the other options. Probably won't order again, but it's quite nice. \\n* Orange Beef -- so tasty. Dreamy tasty. I wish there was more veg (there is no veg). But the flavors are lovely, cut of beef is nice. Orangey flavor is nice. Up the spice as you can.\\n* Almond & Cashew Chicken -- your mileage my vary. I found it boring, you may find it the most delicious tasty thing ever! Nothing was wrong with it when I got it; just not my taste!\\n* Potstickers -- drown me with them, bury me with them, tempt me with them; I'm the biggest fan. Absolutely phenomenal. Highest recommendation.\\n* Blue Crab Racoons -- imagine me weeping in your arms right now. Okay, now order them. Soft and crunchy goodness, so much crab flavor. Creamy dreamy puffs of deliciousness.\\n* Green bean fries -- first thing I ever got from Tso that I was like \\"okaaaaaaaay---- shoves in trash\\". They're allowed a thing that wasn't amazing. They're allowed.\\n* Veggie Egg Rolls -- DELICIOUS. 10/10 would get again. Marvelous flavor.\\n* Chicken Fried Rice -- a staple for me at work. Delicious, more veg than other places, and so much food that it keeps for a second lunch. Absolutely delicious.\\n* Egg Drop Soup -- huge bowl of it and a flavor to make you cry home to momma.

But unfortunately there is new ownership, and the diner has suffered dearly for it. As a place that has a whole vegan section of the menu were out of the seitan and had no vegan/plant based milk option for coffees. Not only were they out of the normal options, but when I ordered the vegan pancakes I assumed they could manage that. But the pancakes I got were DEFINITELY not vegan. I asked to make sure but the waitress said they were. I have had buttermilk pancakes and my boyfriend got Norma buttermilk pancakes, and these were definitely the same mix with eggs, milk, butter and all. On top of all that, we had to get up and ask for water and coffee after not getting spoken to at all for 30 minutes at the table. We also had to get up and ask for the check, to order, and for more coffee this visit took us 2 hours despite getting seated right away. These owners need to get the old waitstaff back because the girl who looked 15 was nervous and unable to take orders correctly or even seat people. And the one waitress was overworked and didn't say anything to us until we needed the check. And IF SOMEONE IS VEGAN THEN GIVE THEM THE VEGAN FOOD THEY ORDERED. We have been coming for an uncountable amount of Sunday's every week, but now we need to look for other options because all of the home vibes and care that the previous staff gave off are gone.

On the opposite side is salad bar and hot food section with fried rice, noodles, and different meat dishes. I tried all the different sushi rolls and I could not remember a single one that I did not like. Some AYCE sushi places put way too much rice and not enough fish in their sushi so that you get full quicker but Kiku makes their rolls small so that you can try all the different kinds of sushi they offer and the fish to rice proportion is perfect. Aside from fresh fish, their fruits also tasted very fresh and sweet, it was a very nice surprise and good way to eat the meal off!During the week, they have AYCE sushi for lunch ($11.99) and half-price sushi for dinner.

No one seemed to be working  at the bar but staff walked by us many times. Finally someone came up to us and said they were sorry but could we come through the restaurant and sit at the other bar.. We gathered our things and moved through the restaurant to the other bar at what we were told was the front of the place. The bartender was nice and polite and served us our wine. We both ordered salmon and salad-mine w green salad and hers with Kale salad. When they brought the meals the salmon looked not quite right on both dishes. My friend's salmon was covered entirely in a layer of the brown flesh that I've never seen served in a restaurant before. My piece was all broken up and looked greasy and not very appetizing.  The greens were also half rotten and slimy. I took a few bites but it was fatty and had pieces of skin all over it and the texture was too soft and it tasted really off. I  realized it was not safe to eat and pushed the bowl aside. I told the bartender and she took it away and it was taken off the bill. They did not offer to replace it and the excuse I was given for serving rotten food like that was that the restaurant was quite new. My girlfriend scraped all the brown stuff off and tried to eat hers. Her kale was at least not rotten. She ate some of the salmon.  We did not fault the bartender and actually tipped her quit well but the fact that the chef would serve terrible and expensive food like that was pretty shocking. And no manager  even  came over to speak to us. We left and went to pot homes where both of us proceeded  to be sick. I was only mildly sick but it was still unpleasant and infuriating to be fed rotten fish which potentially could be dangerous for my health. My girlfriend, who ate much more of hers, was sick for hours. Both of us felt ill and nauseous for half of the next day as well. The worst part is that I called the restaurant to let them know I order to save anyone else from eating the tainted salmon and getting sick and they hostess took my phone number and told me thank you and that one of the owners would call me the next day. No one called me!! I was shocked and angry to be treated so poorly and it spoke quite clearly as to the lack of consideration  and care that the owners feel for their customers. I won't be going back and I will be quite sure to let people know that it is not a safe environment to eat at as well. It's sad to be so disappointed but the reality is that it's clear that this restaurant won't last long unless they choose to begin to maintain a safe and high standard for the food they serve people so they don't poison them and to also have a commitment to customer service they at the very least extends to apologizing  personally for poisoning people. \\nBeware!!!!"},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Three of us had Sunday brunch here and the first thing you need to know is to use the valet parking.

The shrimp and beef rolls (ËÖ∏Á≤âChang fen) are definitely still good. Their radish cake ÔºàËòøËîîÁ≥ïÔºâwas too soft and mushy. It fell apart right away. It was difficult to serve. We also got ‰πæÁÇíÁâõÊ≤≥ which is rice noodles pepper steak stir fry. The noodles weren't good. It was probably overcooked because it broke easily too. The taste was ok. Overall this place is above Lam's garden on colonial in terms of dim sum. But still not good enough. The best one I've had in Orlando so far is Ming Bistro. There's enough sitting area with two round tables for bigger parties of 10 and a few other tables of 4.

I came here for lunch with my mom and decided to try their chilled noodle summer special with sesame sauce. The toppings were separated when my dish was served, so make sure to mix well before eating. I was expecting the noodles to be more of the soba type, but upon eating them, they tasted exactly like the noodles in the ramen dish my mom ordered. While I did appreciate the sesame sauce (I love sesame oil), I thought that the overall dish was pretty mediocre. The cold toppings did not go well together with the noodles even though I mixed the dish thoroughly. Also, the chicken that came with the dish was extremely dry and flavorless.If I were to return here in the future, I would most definitely stick to ordering the ramen.

You come in and get seated as you would for any restaurant and they take your order when you're ready.As a dessert bar dedicated to just mangos, you would probably think you'll be limited in options. Not the case here. Yes, mangos can be found in the ingredients of most items on the menu but they also have a few options that exclude it. Their most popular desserts are their mixed dessert bows that have combination of different toppings like mangos (obviously), grass jelly, ice cream, fruits, and lychee jelly to name a few. So basically imagine the ingredients you would find in a smoothie but instead of sipping it with a straw, you're eating it with a spoon. They offer variety of different combinations, all of which are pretty tasty. Beyond that you can order other desserts like crepes, pancakes, paste soup, slushes, and even waffles.

It was not what I expected, there was not a lot of sauce and the fries were spicy. My boyfriend had the steak with a side of mashed potatoes and broccoli. I thought the broccoli was bland,  but the mashed potatoes were smooth and tasty. He finished his steak before I got a chance to try. We also got the coconut key lime pie as dessert and it was a good thing we shared. It comes in a jar and is built up of a layer of graham crackers, key lime mixture and then whipped cream. I didn't really taste the coconut, the key lime was quite bitter (but tasty), and I wish the graham crackers had been more crispy.

My dining partner and I both got the lobster benedict, which was $26 for the dish, but comes with huge lobster claws and perfectly poached eggs. The home fries were perfectly cooked as well, and I loved my oat milk latte. The only thing is the wait is pretty long on a weekend for brunch, and it's pretty loud/crowded in there, so it's probably easier to come with a smaller group - for 11 AM on a Sunday on MIT's fall break weekend, the wait was still around 45 minutes. You just need to put in your name with the manager (who seems to know many local people!), and spend a little time waiting outside until you're able to eat the best brunch in the area."},{"name":"The Meatball Stoppe","address":"7325 Lake Underhill Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Came in with my brother, mom, and wife around 8:30 on a Saturday night. By then, they were out of three of the meatballs, one of them because the sauce was gone. They were also out of focaccia bread which they substituted with cibatta. It's a relatively small interior and was mildly busy while we were there. The owner, Isabella, met us at the door and was super friendly along with a soft spoken but still quite polite server. We never got a refill on the waters while we were there, but it was kind of busy so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. I was a little bummed to find the sliders and a few of their other options are just one style meatball for the multiple portions it comes with. The meatball sliders, specifically, strike me as a great place to have a few meatball styles on bread but I can understand what they are doing. Been to only one other meatball-centric place in Pittsburgh that had a few more eating choices but I digress.So, slider options out and a few meatballs out that's no big deal. Still made the best of it. They let you get a little mix where you pick the base, mostly pastas sauce, then they throw your choice of meatballs overtop of it. So I ended up getting the pasta penne which came a little undercooked for me. But, I'm picky about this. I know some people like their pasta al dente but that isn't me. The pesto sauce I got on it was actually pretty good, though. Also got to try their traditional sauce over linguine from another dish I was not impressed. And, finally, I got to try the polenta from yet a third dish (the benefit of eating out with multiple family members, you get to try it all!) and was pleasantly surprised. Don't know that I would order it myself but the flavors were there it was just a texture thing for me.They server the meals with a nice little salad. It was actually pretty great, for a starter salad. Creamy dressing, fresh flavors, perfect size for an opener. Since they didn't have the foccacia they threw down some cibatta for us which was a little hard but not too bad.So lets get to them meatballs, eh? They do a 3 dollar upcharge on the gator and crab meatballs. which is a little bit pricier than I would think it warrants, especially considering that these meatballs are all just regular meatball size. maybe a silver dollar or large coin in circumference. I had the gator and it was... okay. Would not get it again. I've had gator at other places but this time it wasn't impressive. I did get the lamb meatball although this was the one without the sauce and it was still decent. I imagine with the sauce it's even better. The mac and cheese was great, awesome flavor mix. Also, the sausage meatballs they do are greasy and flavorful. For dessert we just split two cannolis. Sweet but not overly so, can definitely taste the ricotta which is a good mark of real Italian cooking for me. The crust was really good, overall a nice light dessert that makes it one of the better cannolis I have had. This place deserves another shot from me but overall I was not disappointed in the experience. Now that I know what to expect with the bases we can come in a little earlier when they have more stuff prepared and try a few more food options. I think I saw they had a meatball sandwich type option I'd be interested in. The price is okay and the food overall has a pretty good flavor.

The parking lot was packed, so we thought man, Haewoondae must be a happening place!  We discovered all those cars were parked for the 2 neighboring adult strip clubs, as we entered a barren and empty restaurant.  Hmm, i wondered.  \\nI like Haewoondae.  From the ambiance, to the decor, to the food, to the older gentleman server (not the ahjuma servers) who happened to be the owner.  I was impressed and a bit surprised by the diligence of this owner who was there working at that terribly late hour, and so I feel bad for not being able to give this establishment a higher star review.. but frankly, our experience and observations make it very difficult for me to give higher than 3 star.  Here's our experience..My wife and I (and a buddy of ours who joined us later in the evening) ordered the following meat dishes : sahm gyub sahl, 2 orders of brisket.\\nWe received very thin slices of sahm gyub sahl (meh.. pretty cheapskate for $20) which ended up cooking way too fast and being so thin felt crispy like bacon.  Also, the sahm gyub sahl had nearly no meat but rather just fat.  The brisket was tasty and yummy, but were very meager portions (for $20, c'mon now..) so we ended up having to order two dishes.  We did not drink alcohol but had one bottle of Sprite.  Also, a note about the banchans (side dishes).  I thought they tasted decent and seemed plentiful, but according to my wife (who, for reference, was born and raised in Korea), the side dishes were not fresh which she could tell by the smell and taste.  She fears the sides taste and smell like they had been recycled, which is understandable in this economy, but unfortunate and unacceptable (imho).\\nService was not good by the servers (ahjumas - mid-aged ladies) in that they looked pretty unhappy and cold (generally speaking, and not that we were there).  I think this may have been due to our 1:30 a.m. eating on a Saturday evening, but they do advertise being open till 6 a.m. and we were basically the only customers there, and I told them this was our first time, so I find it reasonable to expect a happier and brighter employees).  My heart goes out for the owner who was calm and collected, but had a stern look the entire time.  We ended up making friendly small talk and I told him I respected his diligence.Price wise, for the quantity of food & 1 Sprite, we were a bit surprised our bill was $70.  That's on the high end for Korean food, and with the quality and quantity, it was a bit of a let down.Summary : we enjoyed our time here and could see why a lot of others like this establishment, but in the end we could see how time has taken its toll on this restaurant.  I agree with my wife's observations and most likely don't see ourselves returning.  The food was tasty and good, but quality was pretty sub par unfortunately.  5 Stars for Ambiance, 2 Stars for Service, 2 Stars for Price, 5 Stars for Owner's Diligence.

Atmosphere is nice and the bartender is great.  Price point for quality is where the place fails.  No clue what they are thinking when they chose what bread to serve.  Think of ciabatta bread in roll form. It had zero taste and was dry. The chicken parmigiana was awful.  The chicken was tough and didn't taste fresh and it was dry as well.  The kicker here is that they don't use quality mozzarella. They use that oh so popular low grade stuff that doesn't brown or emit oil and has no taste.  Just open a Goodfellas location here and be done with it.  Also, same wine as Goodfellas for $9 more a bottle. Fact that Lake Mary is starving for a decent non chain restaurant and the place was empty speaks of other people feeling the same way.

The oyster selection is a tad pricey for Boston ($3.50 per oyster) but at least they are fresh and have a variety (although all were from Cape Cod or RI, no choices from other places). The drinks are okay too - nothing great, but not bad. As for the other food selections, everything was just okay... nothing jumped out as great among the halibut (the best of our entrees) or the bluefin tuna special. The chicken was very much nondescript, and was not what was on the menu. The menu had roasted chicken with mashed and broccolini while what arrived was a bland bbq chicken over a pancake and asparagus. The pancake was a useless piece of carb that seemed out of place. Service was mediocre as well.... all in all, not super impressed with this place as we were when they first opened. With so many choices for oysters and seafood in Boston, I don't understand the hype for this place.

Some of the previous reviews complained about being crowded or not having a proper movie experience.  I'm so glad I didn't listen to them.  Upon arriving we were welcomed by a sweet young lady that helped us right away.  We were a bit confused with the printing of the tickets, but she got us taken care of in seconds and we were on our way to our seats.  When we sat down we were immediately approached by one of their staff with menus and kind words.  There was no rush as we still had about 15-minutes before the movie started.  They didn't annoy us to order, but they were around when we had questions or needed suggestions.  We finally ordered, we're instructed on how to use the amenities, and left us with a smile.  Yes, the drinks were $5 each, but FREE refills (for our sodas) and we never had to leave our seats.  Normally in a restaurant you want all your food to come out together, but when watching a movie you're not eating with everyone else, so the fact that they brought out of food(s) when they were fresh was much appreciated.  My wife got the chicken Caesar salad and said it was good and I got the big nachos (pico on the side ) while my kids got, who cares ÔøΩ?  My only complaint here was the nachos went fast and only I ate them.  They were a decent size, but for $11 I was hoping for a little bigger, but that's just me, they were still really good.  The quality of the movie (sound and visuals) were great and most of the all I never felt having the waiters and waitresses around were a nuisance.  They did great to not interrupt and, again, were very kind.  So, other than the mildly overpriced food, it was a beautiful experience and even my wife (who can be hard to please in new places like this) asked why we don't have one near our house (Victorville, CA 92395 ).

The server kept our coffee full and we weren't in a rush so we just relaxed and waited. I had the huevos enchilada plate which is two eggs served with cheese enchiladas, potatoes and beans and tortillas. The enchiladas were OK, but they tasted like they were microwaved.

It was like they were missing the sherry cream sauce that was in the other photo. They were watery and disappointing. The Chimichurri Steak (Picanha) was just as disappointing.

The service was friendly and my friends and I did not mind sampling several flavors because of how open they were. I got a one scoop cup, but the girl was nice enough to combine two flavors in the cup - perfect for not having to eat more to try new flavors. I got the cookie monster and the basic bish. The cookie monster is an aesthetically appealing blue with chunks of oreo and cookie dough. The basic bish is the usual Madagascar vanilla, but theirs was a little lighter compared to other ice cream places. The cookie dough is really heavy and creamy - my friend got a small cup of all cookie dough and it looked like a lot to eat.My other friend got a medium with one scoop of cookie monster and one scoop of salted caramel. I usually think salted caramel ice cream tastes too artificial for me - and I thought this one did too. My friends all really liked it though, so if you are someone who likes salted caramel you will probably not be disappointed with this. One of my friends got a stack with two glazed donuts - he got cookie monster inside of it. I tried it and I think the cookie cough inside the cookie monster blended well with the dough of the doughnut. One of my other friends is trying to consume less dairy, so she got all vegan flavors, which they have a lot of by the way!! They had three vegan flavors when we went - mango, lemon, and vanilla. My friend got a medium with one school of lemon and one scoop of mango. The mango was pretty decent - my friends all devoured it and we did not really leave her with much to eat. The lemon was good, but it was strong. It is a lot to finish if you are someone who does not actually like lemony flavors, and just wants a tad bit. My advice would be ask for a half scoop of the lemon since it is pretty strong.Overall, this was a solid experience. As someone who usually gets vanilla, they had so many vanilla based flavors, and I was impressed with their vegan selection as well. If you are someone who loves coffee, \\ntheir coffee flavor was incredible - more coffee than sugar in the taste.

I saw the menu and I conquered.Pho Dai Viet is definitely a more modern, American friendly pho spot. Give the area it's in, I wasn't surprised. They don't have your usual pho options that come with different meat combinations. Instead, it's kind of like you build your own bowl of pho. They give you options to pick out what specific types of meat you want in it. I ordered a little bit of everything when I came here only craving pho. I tried the spring rolls, egg rolls, banh mi, chicken pho and avocado smoothie. Honestly, I don't think I've ever ate so much at a pho restaurant but here's a rundown of everything:Chicken pho: broth and noodles were great. I wasn't a huge fan of the fact that only chicken breast meat was used. I've had chicken pho where there were slices of chicken meat with the skin attached or a few dark meat pieces. I think it adds a lot more flavor/authenticity. The medium bowl was just enough and I was able to finish the entire bowl.Spring rolls: there was an option of getting these with both pork and shrimp or just shrimp/pork for the same price. It came out with 2 rolls that were cut in half. Pretty tasty - nothing spectacular here. Egg rolls: also came in a pair and was very well stuffed with the meat filling. I thought it was a little too stuffed. I like my egg rolls with a bit more crunch from the wrapper layers. Overall still good. Banh mi thit nuong: I thought the flavors were spot on. The banh mi was nice and crispy but soft. The \\"grilled pork\\" was not as grilled as it should be. It kinda tasted like the pork was pan fried. The char effect/flavor was missing. Avocado smoothie: YUM. 4/5 stars. not crazy sweet and just the right avocado-y flavor.Also, service here is absolutely fantastic. The staff is really attentive and friendly."},{"name":"Lineage Coffee Roasting","address":"3201 Corrine Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Better than Starbucks!

I have been to many of the Indian restaurants in the Orlando area and this one stands out. Sure, you've had chicken tikka masala or chicken kadai at other restaurants. The food tastes pleasantly different here. I enjoyed the food so much, I'm writing a review!  Tonight we had shrimp kadai and chicken saagwala. Wow, oh wow, the flavors!  I'll focus on the the chicken kadai. Most restaurants serve this sauce lumpy and thick. Royal Rasoi blends the sauce a bit more, so the appearance stood out to me. Texture wise, of course it's already different, but the seasoning was so well done.  The shrimp was just cooked- not overdone and rubbery. My wife can't take the heat and ordered mild. She was very happy that she was able to enjoy her meal!The chicken saagwala is paneer saag, but with chicken instead. Usually the saag ends up being a bit too salty for my liking, but it was seasoned just enough- no, just right. The chicken was cooked right on- not too chewy and over cooked and dry. We also had an order of the garlic naan. This is probably the worst part of my review. My preference is chewy, bubbly naan. Hopefully that translates well, as in the naan isn't perfectly flat and baked so much that it's dry. We weren't quite at that stage, but the naan reminded me of a pita. Still, seasoned with ghee, garlic, and cilantro, it was still quite good.The basmati rice served with the entrees were cooked just right as well.Prices were on par for most of the dishes that I saw.

By far one of my favorite places we went when visiting Austin. Completely worth the wait, which was partially our fault as we went during prime dinner time. That didn't stop us, we sat at the bar and enjoyed a local beer and looked over the menu. The bartenders were very friendly and explained their favorite selections on the menu and the pros/cons of what we were hankering for.We get seated and waiting for us is a deliciously spiced bowl of popcorn (seasoning salt, maybe?). Either way, it tasted even better with my beer. Our waiter was friendly and very prompt, letting us sit and chat until they brought the food along. I was more than ecstatic that I decided on the ribs. A FULL rack and had a killer spice rub all over the outside. Slightly more fatty than I usually like but it didn't stop me from tearing through all of them. I got the seasonal vegetable for a side and it might've been (gasp!) better than the ribs! I got the brussels sprouts that had been flash fried and topped with who knows what but there was also bacon in there. I couldn't eaten an entire dish of those. Luckily I had a full rack of ribs and some popcorn to distract me. Everything also came with little corn muffins. Of course we had to end the night with dessert, the infamous apple pie we heard so much about. It was killer. I probably would've appreciated it more had I not just stuffed my face with popcorn, brussels sprouts, and SO MANY ribs. It was in mini skillet, crunchiness on top with a warm, velvetty caramel-y inside that was made even better by adding whipped cream and a few berries, oh my goodness...You have to go there.

It's overwhelming in a good way. It feels like eating a botanical garden. Most salads are great at first bite, but halfway through it becomes monotonous. No chance of it happening here. You get something different and good in each bite. There's dill, chive, cilantro, peppermint in there, little plums and pickled onions, sesame seeds and fennel and yellow flowers. I don't understand how it doesn't get muddied up, but it doesn't. It's creamy, crunchy, sour, dry, and wet all in one. Since I'm a meat eater, I'd recommend bringing in your own mahi mahi to add to the dish....but I can't do that. This was great.One note about sesame seeds: it's a better addition to a salad than candies walnuts because it covers the entire dish and gives everything a nutty fragrance. It's not just haphazardly put together. HANGER STEAK: great steak. Expensive. Lose the cheese. It's actually best eaten by itself without the sauce. BUCATINI: this was excellent. Tastes like bolognese sauce, and I have no idea what the small crumbs that tasted like ground beef was, but if that's not meat....wow. Pasta cooked nice and soft, just the way I like it. Thick noodles.Overall, just thoughtful and well done. This is a high end restaurant. The portions, compared to everything else on 23rd street, are 1/3rd smaller and more expensive, but that's the price you pay for interesting flavors!"},{"name":"Pho Basil","address":"177 Massachusetts Ave, Ste A","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Great bang for your buck.

That being said the crispy chicken was good and the egg noodles were soft and soaked up all the flavor. I tried the duck noodle soup and it was SO GOOD.

I came from Buckhead all the way down. Yes I know the craving was strong with this one.So I drove down and almost missed it because its on the side but its a big orange sign. I parked in the parking lot and walked in. I was literally in a small living room where there were chairs for people to wait. So it was a living room waiting room. I walked up to the kitchen (yes its a kitchen) and placed my order. I ordered snow crab and shrimp combo and it was $20 which is a great price. I also wanted crab cakes but they ran out. I paid and I sat in the waiting room. I waited for about thirty minutes and received my food. I did not open my food till I got home and OMG. I opened the double bag and it was bursting with food. I was so excited when I saw potatoes, sausage, and corn with my snow crab and shrimp. I decided to go through the food and saw I could easily have shared it with someone else. I had more than a dozen crab legs. I ate it greedily as I had garlicky buttery goodness dripping down my fingers.This place is really good. The only reason why I gave it four stars is the location. I think the stories that I hear about the place always being crowded that they would have enough to have a sit down establishment. I feel like the food would have tasted a lot better if I would have gotten a chance to eat right away instead of having a thirty minute drive back home to eat.

The significant lag time between our drink orders and their subsequent delivery should have been an indication for how the rest of the night would go. We had to remind the staff several times that we were on a timeline and we were assured each time that our food would arrive soon. We were also visited by the manager of the restaurant who offered an apology but ultimately blew us off. After waiting more than an hour and a half for our food, we were forced to leave the restaurant without having been served dinner due to the time constraint we were assured they would accommodate.

At the time we came, they were serving from the brunch menu. My boyfriend ordered the Hangover Rx, composed of pineapple, orange, honey, and coconut water, hoping it'd cure his hangover. It didn't really work, though he liked the flavor, so he ended up getting a hot herbal ginger tea.As for food, we ordered the roasted heirloom carrots, spaghetti squash casserole, and butternut squash pizza. Everything was amazing! The heirloom carrots were roasted to perfection and the dill yogurt it comes with compliments it nicely. The spaghetti squash casserole is to die for and the butternut squash pizza came with all my favorite fixins -- kale, craisins, onions, ricotta cheese, butternut squash (duh). It was sweet, but not overly sweet for a pizza, which made it extremely enjoyable. We ended up not finishing our food (due to our awful hangover) and packed nearly half of it to go. Not a problem though, the food was still all delicious when we reheated it that night!I don't know when the next time I'll be visiting Austin, but the quality of food and customer service at True Food Kitchen is enough for me to want to come back again.

Just when I was about to give up my hope, Taipei 101 came about and changed my life in Orlando. When I walked in, I immediately knew I struck gold. Chinese international students and Asian servers who spoke Mandarin. These are all good signs. I ordered a pork bao and braised beef noodle soup. And goddamn, was I impressed! The pork bao actually tasted just as good as the ones I had in Taiwan. The braised beef noodle soup was also easily a 5/5 and definitely LA level. The service here is amazing! I always bulk order food and bring it back to my friends. The server has always helped me to the fullest extent from packaging all the food neatly in a bag, giving me the proper number of utensils, to breaking down the price for each item on the receipt.

It smells of mold and mildew, like you were stepping into an old farm cellar. It has Smelt like this the past two visits, however today's visit made me walk out. I decided that it was Portland and damp buildings are normal. I ordered my sandwich Foot long tuna toasted on honey oat, pepper-jack cheese, all the veggies with the exception on tomato and pickles. The sandwich lacked flavor, tuna tasted weird as if it had been washed of all its flavor and made with day old mayo. The honey oat bread normally has a sweet nutty flavor that is brought out in the oven, this time it had lacked any and all sweetness. As for the vegetables, they all looked good but did not have much flavor with the exception of the green peppers and jalapenos. It was an awful sandwich. I only ate a few bites before tossing the whole thing away. The Staff were nice and helpful, there were no customers in line when i showed up. There was one girl behind the window making my sandwich as mine was in the oven, another girl came out charged me for my sandwich than finished it up. They staff was pleasant and quick.

I grew up on the stuff and am both picky and mindful of the notion that this food is often better as a comfort food ideal than it is in the real world. I fully suspect I might return and find the magic has worn off after a few visits. That said, I had a truly fantastic lunch on my first trip to Vivo.I started out with a lunch special small house margarita. At only $5 it wasn't lacking in quantity and was surprisingly good - the right balance of tart lime and tequila bite, not too sweet. I ordered the \\"Emma's Choice\\" lunch combo, with a puffy taco, enchilada, rice, and beans. The puffy taco was the best I've had in a long time - the shell was perfectly fried - not some chewy, deflated puck of masa that I've too often encountered. The Tex Mex \\"chile\\" enchilada was spot-on: The right kind of soft American cheese that's essential to a proper Tex Mex enchilada, and an ancho chile sauce that hit the right flavor points of a classic chili con carne gravy, but in a somewhat elevated form. Beans and rice were faultless, with plenty of cheese melted over and around the plate. I struggled to finish my lunch but couldn't stop until I'd scraped up every last bit with chips. It was both a full dinner-sized feast and a bargain at $8.95.My waitress, Maria, was eager to explain the lunch specials, friendly, and attentive.

Both times I sat at the Teppan tables and ordered the scallop and shrimp dinner. This order comes with soup & Salad, grilled vegetables, noodles and fried rice or steamed rice. The first time, the scallops were perfectly cooked and so was the shrimp. It was to die for. Both are only supposed to be cooked a short while and served \\"fluffy\\" for lack of a better word.  So I went back a few days later and the second time they totaly overcooked everything and it was terrible. Even the vegetables were overcooked. I didn't want to say anything because no manager seemed close by and I'm not sure what h/she could have done anyways.The rice was served \\"sticky\\", which is not typical of japanese fried rice, but more of steamed rice. So I'm not sure if the chef was confused as to the recipe or if that's just the way they do it at Fuji. Frankly, the 2nd time traumatized me so bad I may never go back. The food was pretty over-cooked. However, the restaurant is clean and the servers seem nice enough. They also have sushi. However, I looked at the sushi case and all the fish was pre-cut, which is generally not a good sign.  That dries out the fish and causes it to turn bad more quickly. If it's a BUSY restaurant, then it's okay because they'll go through the fish quickly. EVen good restaurants will pre-cut fish it it's their \\"busy period\\" and they know they can move the food. But this restaurant wasn't busy enough to go through the entire case of cut fish they had there. I ordered one cut roll (Jaguar roll) and wasn't wild about it. So I didn't order anything else Also, it seemed like the sushi chefs were from everywhere but Japan and that seems weird. Not to be a total stickler for detail but sushi is a practiced discipline that takes years to learn. True sushi chefs from Japan go through training for years to study fish, how to evaluate fish, cut fish, keep it \\"sushi quality\\" without degrading and \\"serve safe\\" so people don't get sick from eating \\"old\\" fish.  It's hard to imagine how someone who's not Japanese would get that kind of training. Anyhow, the cooked food was okay. Sushi I wouldn't go for, but it's a nice restaurant with nice people for service."},{"name":"Von Ebert Brewing - Glendoveer","address":"14021 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I ended up really liking this place!

Perhaps it's because their room rates tend to be much lower than the Four Seasons or their sister property at Grande Lakes the Ritz-Carlton. Though spend anytime on this property and you will be sure you are in a 5 Star Hotel. It is gorgeous, from the opulent lobby and common areas, one of the largest and beautiful marble open lobby and common areas you'll ever see in a hotel, to the grounds, with the spectacular lazy river that winds through a forest of trees and brush. This hotel is a true gem in Orlando. By comparison, we stopped by Disney's Contemporary Resort for dinner one evening and were shocked at how unbelievably bland the lobby and common areas were in that hotel, it looks like the food court area in a local mall. That is a hotel the consistently charges hundreds of dollars more per night for a room that JW Marriott, which in turn gives you the feel of being in a palace, rather than a mall food court.The service they provide at the JW is top notch, they go out of their way to accommodate any requests of the guests. And it's wonderful that they share all resort amenities their their sister property the Ritz-Carlton, including use of the Ritz's pool and the luxurious Ritz-Carlton Spa. Between the two sister hotels you could easily spend your whole day wandering the Grande Lakes resort and never begin to get bored. If you are looking to stay at a 5 Star Hotel in Orlando but don't want to pay the rates of the actual 5 Star Hotels there I highly recommend the JW Marriott, a jewel among Orlando's best resorts."},{"name":"Healthy Pita","address":"400 Washington St Rte 53","city":"Norwell","stars":"4","text":"The mighty have fallen.

We ordered popcorn (of course) and a chicken tender dinner that came with French fries. I will say that I'm disappointed in the quality of food for a movie theater that branded itself as \\"Grill\\".  I did expect a little more quality than what was received. The chicken tenders were basic, nothing spectacular and fries were a big soggy and were served cold, as well as, the popcorn. Not sure if the staff was overwhelmed that they couldn't get the food items out as fast or if they were just old and sitting there. However, the tickets price is about the same as any other theater and the theater itself was fine. It was dark as it should be and the reclining seats were comfy enough for us, I only wish the sound was a little bit louder and more clear. I could see where it could be distracting for some but we found no issues with that. It's definitely a different experience if you're looking to try out a dine-in theater."},{"name":"827 Rays Kitchen + Cellar","address":"3519 Ranch Road 620 N","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We went to Rays 827 for the first time tonight.

I probably don't need to browse the menu since I always order the same 2 things: savoury pannekoeken The Canadian or Boer's. Yes, I know, I can be boring at Du Dutch but why play with perfectly tasty pancakes. Today, The Canadian wins so I could divide the pannekoeken in half for a savoury side and the other half sweet with maple syrup. My friend had the breakfast platter.

Highly recommend those two! If you're visiting, ask your waiter to get you 2x of his/her top 4 local picks! Or top 5 or 6, whatever. Make it rain, y'all. Lobster roll - delicious, very small, but very tasty. Love the chips it comes with. Oyster Po'Boy - nothing compares to New Orleans, but this is still very good. Oyster enthusiasts should give it a try.Crispy Oyster sliders - yaaaaaAAaaAaaasss. Who has time to read a wordy descriptive review when a simple \\"yas\\" will suffice? I'm no Jonathan Gold.

My mom suggested that we go and get a takeout menu from Taipei 101 for a future dinner date. Great idea, only they don't have takeout menus. The smell when you walk in is incredible! It doesn't have that oily smell of strip mall Chinese joints, it smells like delicious food I want to consume immediately! So, being that we are stuffed from dinner, my mom suggests we order spring rolls to go. Haha! Way to go mom! At least I know where I get it from! I spot Gua Bao on the menu and have to order one. Well, my mom wants one too and I'm not gonna share, so we get two orders. In total, for the spring rolls and two Bao orders, is like $13. Not bad!When the food came out, I was super excited! The Bao looked Sooo good, and there were 2 per order. Yes, two delightful steam buns filled with pork belly and peanut sauce for $5. A total steal!! Had I known there were two per order, we would've only gotten one, but the extras definitely didn't go to waste. The spring rolls were subpar and I wouldn't order them again. They looked homemade from the outside, but the filling was nothing but mushy flavorless cabbage and they tasted like they were previously frozen. I'll definitely skip these in the future. The Bao, however, were so flavorful! The pork belly melted in your mouth and, even though it's 90% pure fat, you don't get that wiggly-jiggly \\"I have a mouth full of fat\\" feeling. It was perfect. There was also plenty meat on there as well. I know there were veggies but I can't remember what they were. The peanut sauce they put on was also super flavorful and yummy. It's wasn't super creamy, it had chunks of nuts still in it, which added to the great texture. I went back the next day just to get an order of Bao, because they were that good! I honestly cannot wait to go back again and try more of their dishes. Everything that other people around us were eating looked so good! I have no idea what they were eating and am not sure what to order next time, but I don't think I can go wrong with anything on their menu.

I believe all of their sandwiches are named after famous authors/poets. The sandwiches were both good, but as much as I love Brie, I thought the combination of prosciutto and fig made the other sandwich the better of the two.In addition, the friend ordered a coffee and I went with an iced latte, and we also decided to do the 6 donuts for $5 since we were in the mood for a treat. That was a mistake and here's why:I talked the friend into the 6 for $5 because it just made more sense. We were getting more for our money, of course, and I've been to several places that make their own donuts. They've always been more like mini-donuts and left me wanting more...well, these were NOT mini donuts. They were large and piping hot, deep-fried deliciousness. Suffice it to say, they needed to be eaten first (otherwise, they wouldn't have been as good, you know) and 6 turned out to be too many because all of them were eaten before we touched the sandwiches.

Oysters are amazing anywhere as long as they're fresh so they're a safe bet. They come at either $3 or $3.5 a piece. They're also good fried--although I think that's mainly because the pickles and greens that accompanied it on the slider were refreshing.The mussel toast was regrettable. It was a lukewarm dish, figuratively and literally. Two pieces had sand; the chilis were indiscernible; and the soft (mushy) greens were not a palatable texture. The temperature made me feel like I was eating fresh mussels on a forgotten bed of vegetables, left out on the counter.Lobster bisque was thick and crustacean-sweet with the texture of pumpkin soup/Japanese curry. I appreciated that it wasn't fishy while still tasting like lobster. Didn't love it as I prefer soups that veer salty.The lobster roe noodle was highly recommended by my sister. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the concentrated, creamy, cheese-like sauce beyond the first bite. It was incredibly rich. The grilled lobster bites were good, but there were a few pieces that were charred and/or dried from overcooking. The braised meat did not belong--ICOB please take it out--because it felt and tasted weird with seafood. More is not better when it means tossing in kitchen scraps.The monkfish was the best of the cooked items. The fish was tender and moist with a nice sear, but the accompanying sides were hit or miss. The gnocchi was blatantly tart, jarring against the creamy sauce. The root veggies were sweet and citrusy, which would have been enough for me.My second favorite part of the meal, after oysters, was the complimentary house-made ice cream sandwiches. The chocolate cookies tasted strongly of cocoa and there was just the right balance of ice cream to cookie to not feel lacking.This is my long winded way of saying: avoid the food, but try the (raw) bar.

I'm a ramen freak who isn't judgmental of store bought top ramen but I'm an appreciative ramen freak when I know what I'm eating is authentic. For comparison reasons, the ultimate BEST ramen I have ever had is in Vancouver BC...the famous Ramen Santouka (they are on Yelp). I have never really had a WTF moment with ramen places...but I guess the other end of the spectrum would be top ramen? (I don't have a problem with top ramen!)PROS - Really great atmosphere. It looks small outside but it's pretty spacious inside. There is a modern \\"table + chair\\" side with the sushi bar and also a traditional \\"pillow = chair + table\\" side. For happy hour and lunch, you will usually be seated over at the modern side and for dinner/reservations, usually the traditional side.Best ramen in Oregon, but still not Ramen Santouka. By saying it's the best ramen in Oregon, that's setting a standard for all the ramen places in Oregon. Since I'm a ramen freak, I have sought out all the ramen places in Portland, Beaverton, and Tigard....Shigezo is the real deal. I have been here many times for ramen (during lunch and happy hour), I don't know why I haven't written a review yet. I guess it's because last night was my first time having dinner there...it has prompted me to share some of thoughts on the dishes that I have ventured out to. I have tried all their ramenz (both with broth and without broth) and I must say my favorites are: Shio Abu Ramen (no broth, FULL of flavor) and Kumamoto Ramen (I LOVE pork-based broths over soy sauce and miso based). Solid sushi. I have tried all their happy hour rolls and they were simple and delicious. Last night, I ordered the \\"Real Crab Cali Roll\\"...super good. CONS - One of the hot tapas that I ordered was the Okonomiyaki...they are pancakes folded over, stuffed with eggs, cabbage, pork and squid. Drizzled with house sauce. Didn't taste much of the squid or pork as it was overwhelmed with cabbage. Probably wouldn't get it again.Worst tempura in Oregon. I'm sorry, there was no light way to put this. I was craving for tempura so I ordered the tempura assortment. You get 2 pieces of each listed ingredient. The batter was very general batter...even batter from the Oregon State Fair has more flavor..hell, I can make better batter! Sushiland has better batter (and for a fraction of what Shigezo costed me)!!!!  I'm never one to complain about fishy-ness (I'm a total sashimi fan!), but sheesh the battered white fish was SUPER FISHY! It was like I reached into a river, pulled out a random fish and took a bite out of it!!!! Aruuughhhhh! And then I immediately felt funny (a bad kind of funny) afterwards. Which leads me to think maybe the fish was bad but they fried it anyways (explains the extra fishy-ness). DO NOT GET THE TEMPURA ASSORTMENT!!! It's a trap!!! And at $14 for not even that much, it was a very expensive trap.The waitress we had was super attentive and friendly. So I did'n't want to be all like, \\"Everything is good except for your tempura lol wut happened?\\"POINTERS - Best ramen in town, but worst tempura in town. Stick with the sushi and ramen.

I had heard great things about this location (and their Brooklyn location from friends) so had an idea of what to expect.The dishes they offer are not your garden variety Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, and Drunken Noodle - think more intense fishy dishes, crispy dried shrimp, and Khao Soi (aka the dishes that aren't the most aligned to Western tastes). We didn't wait at all and were seated immediately at the front table. The janky, seemingly hipster set up of being in front of someone's house with ramshackle tables, and plastic laminate covering are not a salute at being hip - it's an homage to how to experience true SEAsian food at its best: randomly walking by and finding someone's lower floor open to the public, the house owner cooking while watching a soap opera (bonus points if they have a cat/dog laying around).I was beyond elated and allowed my friend to order: Eggplant & Jackfruit Salad; both Chicken and Beef Khao Soi; Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings; and Pork Belly. I'm allergic to jackfruit and so only had the eggplant, but didn't enjoy the dish personally that much - it didn't really have much flavour, but had the characteristic texture of Asian eggplant. The Chicken Khao Soi was as good as I remember in both Chiang Mai and in Burma - very flavourful, fresh, rich and decadent but not too heavy, with a nice light coconut base, despite my aversion to coconut. The Beef Khao Soi just did not measure up to the chicken - the red meat adds an umami to the equation that forces the dish to be more dense than expected. If you don't like fishy things, you will not like the wings, obviously, but they are perfectly crisp in the skin without having any hint of oilyness, but the meat itself didn't have much flavour. The winning dish of the day was the pork belly which was packed with flavour, was well-balanced, and cooked to the right amount of tender.More dishes were just meh than incredible, and I don't know that it's worth the wait, but if you can catch them at an off time, then be sure to stick around (and expect to spend an extra penny for quality)."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We were on our way to Giacomo's and there was a huge line outside, so we walked back a block to The Daily Catch, a tiny, brightly lit place with all of about 5 tables.

If you're into decor and ambiance, this might not be the place for you. But if you're into watching the chef prepare your dinner 3 feet from your table, and aren't put-off by paper napkins, plastic cups and cramped quarters, this is definitely a possibility.

As a Boston resident for 29 years, a Boston University graduate, and big Red Sox fan, Cask historically has offered a fun option for drinks in the Fenway area. But as my friends and I have matured, we've struggled with the younger/ obnoxious crowd that oftentimes fills the bar--definitely around Sox games and big tentpole sporting events. We stopped going to Cask entirely 3 years ago--we literally shared a collective sigh when we were like \\"this isn't fun anymore\\" in reference to Cask--opting for nearby spots with better beer selection like Yard House. But rather than me go on about the reasons I stopped going to Cask a few years ago (there's so many), I'd like to explain why we started going back: ZACH. Yes, Zach--the bartender the impulsive management team just fired. Zach, by so many accounts, is considered one of the best bartenders to come out of Somerville/ Cambridge--he seriously has Cocktail-like skills behind the bar. That's not what makes him great, though. He's a good person. He's befriended more patrons in Boston/ Somerville/ Cambridge than I can count. I've been invited to more parties and made more friends (at and outside of Cask) due to the network of GOOD people Zach connects. He's the sort of person that makes a group of almost-30 year-olds say \\"screw it, we're going to Cask again because Zach is there. He's a good dude.\\" And that's what happened. When Zach got a job at Cask, the Somerville/ Cambridge community was sad to see him go, but we were happy for him. It painted Cask in a good light for hiring him. And, most importantly, it gave us all a reason to go visit Zach in the Fenway area. In a lot of ways, Zach has been an ambassador to the city of Boston, someone I've pointed friends, clients, family to time and time again. We've sent countless people visiting Boston to Cask to \\"say hello to Zach.. he'll make you feel at home\\"--and I have countless stories about folks from around the US and the globe who have gone to Cask and been amazed at how wonderful Zach made them feel. So, having watched quietly on the sidelines while ONE PERSON (this person happens to be a female, but I call them a \\"person\\" because sex is no part of this--I just want to be clear) decided to take to Yelp to bad mouth the best bartender my large crowd of affluent Bostonians have come to love, I felt compelled to stand up for Zach and let the Yelp community know that the management of Cask has no backbone whatsoever and would simply fire an employee based on a negative Yelp review. I'm a believer in community-driven content, it's just sad to see a bar believe so much in it that they'll fire an employee over unsubstantiated words. The one negative Yelp reviewer caused management to respond: \\"take him off the schedule, get his shift covered.\\" This happened immediately. Zach was given no benefit of the doubt, no opportunity to defend himself, nothing. And now Zach is out of a job. Where's the justice in that? I can honestly say I now have that one final reason why I never need to walk in Cask again. And with whatever happens to this Yelp review I write, rest assured it's being copied and pasted into my Facebook news feed as well as being sent out in a large email chain to the 100 or so friends Zach and I have connected through the better part of this past decade.

It's sometimes difficult to travel with my BFF, as she has Celiac, and her dining options can be limited. We checked her app for restaurants with gluten-free menu items, and ended up at a different restaurant down the street. We were seated, stared at the menu, then got up and left.Moonshine was nearby, had a menu that appealed to us both, and thankfully, had no wait (after the hostess told us we could be seated at the bar.)Both bartenders that night did a great job of tending to us, while they were filling drink orders for the restaurant, others at the bar, and those that sidled up for a drink.We decided to share the spinach artichoke dip (with tortilla chips instead of bread) and each got an order of the night's special: a flank steak served with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. The artichoke dip came out first, and I was secretly pleased to see that the bartender had asked the kitchen to include the bread for me, while giving my friend the tortilla chips in a separate basket. I do so love bread. The dip was hot and cheesy, with good blended flavors between the earthiness of the spinach and artichokes, and creaminess of the cheese.The steaks came out not much later, and they were some of the most flavorful and juicy steaks we'd ever had. They came with a pat of butter melting away on top of the steak, and a few roasted garlic chips. The whole effect was a delightfully delicious dish that was impossible to stop eating. And they were cooked to perfection, as well!We still talk about this visit, reliving the delicious food, fun bartenders and great night we had.

Was seated upstairs in the balcony overlooking the restaurant and the street on a gorgeous Portland day! We were recommended by a few friends to come try this place out and it certainly did not disappoint. We were starving from a hike at Eagle Creek and decided to try this place out. Luckily the wait wasn't long during the weekday early afternoon. Started off with the Tamarind Whisky Sour with tamarind, fresh line juice, palm sugar and bourbon on the rocks. They certainly do not skimp on their alcohol. This one was strong and tangy, different and something I have never tried! I also go the Cha Manao, the thai iced tea with fresh line juice. Again, something I have never tried! Thai iced tea usually comes with evaporated milk, the lime juice made it taste tangy and refreshing. I really enjoyed it! It was sour and sweet without the creaminess.Everyone orders the Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings! So we cannot NOT order it! Half dozen whole wings, marinated in fish sauce and sugar, deep fried and tossed in more garlic and fish sauce. I love fish sauce, grew up eating it so this was a home run for me. We got ours spicy and it was perfect, not tongue burning spicy. This one is really messy so be prepared to use your hands! I got the vegetarian Khao Soi, a Northern Thai mild curry noodle soup made with curry paste, house-pressed fresh coconut milk with house pickled mustard greens, shallots, and topped with crispy yellow noodles. My ultimate favorite! The coconut taste was soooo mind-blowingly good mixed in with the curry, you can tell when they use fresh coconut milk even the drinking water that they serve has coconut flavor to it! I like these little details and surprises when drinking water! LOL!Kai Yaang, half bird if you're not sharing, whole bird if you're sharing. Its a charcoal roasted small hen stuffed with lemongrass, garlic, pepper, cilantro, with this tamarind dipping sauce. We got the whole hen and it was a lot of food! The hen was moist and the meat had a lot of flavor.Overall, the hype is justifiable because this is not your typical Thai restaurant / Thai food.

The tea was slightly too floral for my taste -- I actually thought they'd mistakenly given me jasmine tea -- but the boba were soft and chewy and sweet.

Duck was cooked to crisp with just enough skin to give the meat some texture.

For topics about which I really know a lot, I've noticed that someone really knowledgeable has taken the time to organize the books in a thoughtful manner which really cuts down on time when searching for a particular book.If you're in Portland, you have to stop here.

I wasn't super impressed with the ramen or the food. I guess the soup was very flavorful, but the noodles tasted pretty mainstream to me.

I also tried these pancake ball things that everyone recommended on Yelp and they were ok.....I don't know what they are supposed to taste like but I guess I imagined they would have more flavor? I know you are supposed to dip it in sauce, but it was difficult to keep the integrity of those pancake balls together enough to dip it too many times in the sauce.

Also, I'm not sure why Yelp says the price range for Nori Nori is $11-30; it's definitely more, especially when you factor in weekend + dinner prices and tips. It gets up to around $40 for a weekend or holiday dinner. Clearly, it's a little on the pricey side, and I'm not sure it does enough to warrant that tag.Nori Nori boasts a huge selection of foods: sushi (of course) of all kinds (fried, sashimi, nigiri, ikura, masago, specialty, and all the classics like unagi and california roll), raw fish (tuna, mackerel, salmon, red snapper), cooked goods like king crabs, fried foods including scallops, tempura, calimari, and octopus, skewers (shrimp, ribeye, squid) salads, noodles, vegetable dishes (bok choy, seaweed) and a dessert bar with soft serve ice cream (vanilla and matcha), pastries, cakes, tiramisu, made-to-order crepes, and fruits (both fresh and preserved). Dinner has a wider selection of dishes including the snow crab legs and oysters, which explains why it's more expensive than lunch.The sushi definitely stands out to me as the best part of dining here; I think I've tried every single type of sushi they offer here. At dinner specifically, they make the sushi pieces extremely small, which is great for AYCE because you can try more different things without wasting food / stuffing yourself. The sushi is generally very good, and it's where I spend most of my time when I'm here. My personal favorite is the unagi, which they hide in the far corner with the nigiri because of its high demand. I also enjoy the roe sushis like the masago and ikaru. I do wish they would actually vinegar the rice in the sushi; it's quite bland and dry as is. Aside from small quibbles, the quality of the sushi is generally quite high.Unfortunately, I don't find that the other foods live up to the high bar set by the sushi. The cooked goods always disappoint me; they are things I could find at any seafood/sushi buffet. The skewers especially are kind of gross; the ribeye skewers in particular are dreadfully overcooked and tough to chew on. Everything else, like the tempura, crawfish, calimari, I just feel I could get anywhere for a cheaper price. For dinner today, everybody went crazy for the oysters and snow crab legs - those were the only things aside from the sushi worth getting I guess.I like the service here. My waiters never bother me with those annoying questions while I'm eating but they always manage to pick up my dirty plates quickly. They're polite, not in-your-face with asking about everything, and efficient. In my opinion, that's the best kind of service.Oh, and did I mention it gets super busy? Especially on weekends and holidays, Nori Nori is FULL of people. Come really early or place a reservation, otherwise don't expect to get a table without a long wait.tl;dr Nori Nori is worth a visit for dinner given its wide variety of good sushi and seafood, but I won't be back too often given its high-ish price point (~$40)"},{"name":"Mango Mango Dessert Atlanta","address":"5177-A Buford Hwy NE","city":"Doraville","stars":"4","text":"3.7 stars, rounding to 4 stars because maths and also because of great service.Ordered the mango pomelo parfait with snow cream and a mango/strawberry slushie-o.

It's pretty big, so make sure you have a large appetite or bring someone to share it with. The slushie was disappointing. It tasted way too watery, and only had hints of mango flavor. I really couldn't taste any strawberry in the drink either, and if weren't for the pink ribbons of slush and strawberry garnish, I would have assumed it was a poor attempt at a mango la croix slushie.

Everything else is pure libel: it isn't Cajun, there is no island, and it's not a caf√©.\\nI have to keep going back and removing the acute accent over the \\"e\\" in \\"cafe\\" because IT'S A DIRTY LIE.Let's address the obvious issue: no one has any business walking into a food establishment in landlocked Columbus, Ohio advertising itself as a Cajun island cafe with expectations. We're generally too far north to lay much claim to anything remotely Cajun we haven't seen on a Guy Fieri show first, and unless you count the beach my belly makes in a shallow bath, Columbus wouldn't know an island if it cracked open its sandy skull and Jimmy Buffett popped out to throw leis into the befuddled crowd at the antonymously named Alum Creek Beach. But Columbus loves to play at diversity with its food, so the city is filled with places to access cuisine nominally drawn from genuine cultural nodes. You can find almost any style of food here, and it will taste like all of the sorrow an act of Columbusing can provide.Upon entering the establishment a dozen red flags immediately flapped into view: no hot sauce on the tables, a display unit that normally houses food showcasing instead their many in-house sauces, way too many things on the menu, the upsell of a dish that has nothing to do with its advertised cuisine...there were so many signs I felt like a driver's ed manual had sprung to life and opened a neon-littered Cajun island cafe.Ordered: Jambalaya - In the age of Zatarain's monopoly on boxed Cajun food that not even a weedhead who has flash-huffed away his taste buds into so many shriveled midnight munchie stems should be able to mess up, Nico's finds a way. A dish that is literally tedious to eat owing to a complete absence of anything resembling a spice, this staple was but a harbinger of things to not-come. Crawfish Ettoufee - While ettoufee can be prepared many ways, traditionally it has the texture of gravy over rice and the ingredients (crawfish is the staple meat unless you're a heathen) should pop out of it in an array of flavors like bygone lovers calling for reunion. What Nico's placed before me was a plate loaded with a pool of black tar upon which they had dumped a urinal cake of rice. I had to guess at what was on my fork with each bite because everything was slathered in the trademark asphalt which had apparently been scraped from whatever remains of the Deepwater Horizon. I half expected the slick goo to infect my cells and rip through me, giving birth to new Giger-inspired alien life. I could count the number of bites I took of this on one hand even if three of my fingers fell off from chemical exposure. BBQ Ribs - Because what screams \\"Cajun\\" more than a plate of barbecue ribs so charred they need a skin graft to be presentable? This dish was four lonely pieces of brick-cut meat done in their (again) trademark blackened style, which in this instance translated to penny loafer-tough meat smoked for seventy-two hours over a pack of Menthols. It must have been a lot of work to plate four charcoal briquettes whose meat clung to their bones so stiffly that I thought the guinea pig they had removed them from had placed a restraining order against my teeth. Alligator Gumbo - Now, this one was a reach no matter who was in the kitchen. Alligator isn't a ubiquitous meat in these parts, so even adding this to the menu was kind of a \\"Come On, Son\\" moment. I've had gator where gator lives. Even if what was going in this dish was actual gator meat (and I am not convinced that it was), we're in Ohio. Unless you rolled down to Jungle Jim's or otherwise got this from a reputable seller, quit playin'. A moot argument as it turns out, since the plate looked exactly like the crawfish yuck-toufee: a slopping of black tar with a popped pimple of dry rice to tag team textures on your palate, dancing somewhere between pneumonia bile and whatever the ghost from The Ring washes her hair with. All said and done, five plates were left on the table virtually untouched (I bark-choked a rib and a half into submission) and we were out of that place in ten minutes and on to another restaurant. In a situation like that - where the food is so bad you're not sure it isn't following you home to kill you in your sleep - you don't try to get your money back or ask to speak to the manager. You get out and go to another restaurant, and you spend whatever it takes to make you forget what just happened to you. You chalk it up to a lesson learned, and you pretend the scraping at the back door is the dog you don't own, trying to get back in."},{"name":"Hey Love","address":"920 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Not only is Hey Love straight up gorgeous, but the food is exceptional!

This visit sealed the deal.  Based alone on my past experiences here and the feedback I've gotten from others (out of towners and locals alike), this place probably deserves no stars.  Not only do they fail to live up to the expectations led on by their website and menu, they fail even coming into it with no bets on the table.  It's hard to believe they survived over three years like this.It is also hard to believe they scored a 97 on their last two health department inspections; I just had to check after this experience, totally expecting failing grades.  The place felt grimy, literally.  The first table we sat at, supposedly clean, was covered with shiny stickiness, obviously the work of a very dirty rag.  We moved to another \\"clean\\" table, this one also sticky, and with the added bonus of a mug that had several dried drops of coffee inside of it and a water glass that not only had a film but a very prominent lipstick mark on the rim.  The third table was the kind of clean you expect late-night in a dark and dingy dive bar, not at 2pm on a mostly clear day with light coming in from the huge windows.  When we entered, we were directed by the bartender/waiter/busser(?) to \\"sit anywhere\\" (he said, brushing past us as if we were in his way).  With most of the other tables left unbussed, and the clean ones in a sad state, perhaps he meant \\"sit anywhere if you can.\\"  If this is the front of the house, why in the world would anyone trust the food being prepared out of sight in the kitchen?  Maybe they just don't care anymore.  When I Googled for their hours, I got a search result that lists the business for sale because the \\"owners [are] moving on to other adventures.\\"  Well, more power to the next person moving in.  It has been a very, very long time since this space has seen a success.  This visit was V & P's last chance, and we never even made it to the menu.  Sad, but true.  After settling on an adequately clean table, the bartender/waiter/busser(?) made an appearance to bus the been-used dirty tables, but still no acknowledgment of us or a menu.  Yeah, at this point, this wasn't going to be worth it.  We jumped this sinking ship and swam to the safety of a much more reliable and trusted establishment.I've no ground to speak for their apparent nightlife scene, which includes live music and a big TV.

Beth checked us in and was very friendly and informative about the different activities around the resort. We arrived at the hotel at 10am and our room was ready for us and we didn't need to wait. The grounds of the hotel were amazing and beautiful and we loved that the Ritz Carlton was adjacent to the hotel. We mostly used their grounds and pool during our stay and the service was professional and was always at your service for anything you needed. We rented a car for two days at the Hertz onsite which was convenient and quick. They always had a car available for us and it was easy to pick up and drop off each day we used their service.We went to Disney for one of the days and used the complimentary shuttle. The only downfall to this was that the returning times were 5:30 and 10:30. I know that is it complimentary, but a third option would be even better due to the fact the 5:30 seems too early and 10:30 too late. We ended up taking a taxi home from the park instead of waiting until 10:30. The food at the hotel was great. I would recommend going to the Vineyard Grill at the Ritz for their breakfast buffet. It was $2.00 more than Citron at the Marriott. The service was better and the food selection was bigger. I did not enjoy the service at dinner at Citron because the table was never cleared off properly and we could never find our waitress. The food was still good, but the service was a turn off.

Lobster Roe Noodles - my dad orders this every time we come. I'm not sure if they changed it, but there was a substantial increase in the amount of seafood/lobster that was on his plate! The mushrooms are so tender/juicy/moist and adds a great texture to the dish.2. The salad (I can't remember the name) was so DELICIOUs! I think it might be the best salad I've had in a while! It had ricotta cheese, tomatoes, corn, and croutons. The presentation was beautiful! I mean they say you eat with your eyes before your stomach... & the first silver of tomato which had a pinch of sea salt on it plus a dab of ricotta cheese & the corn & the balsamic dressing = to die for !

Flavour wasn't bad, but there were clear flaws. \\n- The rice was hard and stale. \\n- The avocado in the chicken teriyaki roll was a great addition. I like avocados! However, I found a couple of pieces that had black dots. \\n- The yam tempura roll was a little oily and soggy.\\n- The chicken teriyaki was breaded and fried, but seems like the frozen kind.

The ones who go into the obviously haunted house after dozens of clues tell them they shouldn't, under any circumstance, go inside the obviously haunted house? That was me and my friend at this Little Caesar's.As we walk inside, a woman walks out holding two pizzas and rasp-whispers to me, \\"Check EVERYTHING before you leave.\\" Not a great sign. And yet, like two na√Øve horror movie dumb-dumbs, in we go.At first, it's just the usual Little Caesar's experience. You know, employees standing around doing nothing, abnormally long lines, the smell of that weird liquid butter substance wafting over to greet your nose, etc. And then...In storms a man. Runs up to the counter and screams, \\"WHERE THE F*CK IS TOMMY?!\\" You see, the craziest part about this wasn't the man screaming; it was how normal the employees treated him. The manager says, \\"Oh, he's out back smoking,\\" to which the man replies, \\"WELL, HE BETTER GET THE F*CK OUT HERE.\\" Then he leaves. We finally order. Nothing complicated--a Cheese Deep Dish Pizza. We sit down to wait. More and more people file in. It's starting to look like Walmart on Black Friday. People standing around, huffing and puffing, not a single pizza being given out.And then. Oh, then.In comes the main. Again, the throws out his go-to line, \\"WHERE THE F*CK IS TOMMY?!\\" and paces up and down the checkerboard floor. He runs up to cashier, bangs his hands on the counter, and screams, \\"Where IS he?! F*ckin' meth head! I'll have this f*ckin' place shut down!\\" Again, the employees treat him like this is normal (?!?!?!?!) and ask him what his name is so they can tell Tommy after he gets back from his break. Like something out of a cheesy dram-com, the guy replies, \\"He knows who I am. I'm his worst f*ckin' nightmare,\\" and out he goes.By this point, we've been sitting and waiting on the pizza for 25 minutes. The eight employees in the back (jury's still out on why there were so many) are cracking jokes and playing trash can basketball with crumpled papers. There are pizza boxes everywhere. Some open, some empty, some stacked on the corners of tables. Bet you thought that guy finally left by this point, right? Wrong. In he comes. Walks up to the counter and says calmly, \\"I'd like to order a pepperoni pizza.\\" Pulls out the biggest wad of $100 bills I've ever seen. He pays. He gets his pizza immediately (I'm starting to think the employees know this guy...) and--wait for it--starts walking out without the damn pizza. Turns around, laughs and says, \\"Ha, I almost forgot my pizza!\\" and leaves one last time.  So, back to our humble cheese pizza. It's been 35 minutes. And still, not a single pizza has been given to a single customer inside the place (with the exception of that screaming dude). I'm starting to feel like I'll never get out, that I'm in some inescapable circle of hell. The Little Caesar's guy on the wall is laughing at me in his stupid little toga.My friend goes up to complain. Wants to know how long it'll be. The cashier turns around, asks the employees in the back, and they all shrug. SHRUG! Honestly, I feel like that's the symbol of this place: a sloppy, lazy little shrug. The manager comes up and whispers something in the cashier's ear, and she says to my friend, \\"Four minutes.\\" Obviously, my friend is D-O-N-E with this damn place by now and asks for a refund. Miraculously, they give her one, and we're out the door with our pizza in a few minutes.Oh, did you think it was over now? Wrong. Again.I started driving. When we were about five minutes away, that prophetic whisper from the woman hit me. We didn't check the pizza. I was sure everything was fine--we were there for 40 minutes; surely the order was correct--but I turned to my friend anyway and asked, \\"Did you check the pizza to make sure it's right?\\" She looked at me, closed her eyes and opened the box ever so slowly...PEPPERONIS.PEPPERONIS!PEPPERONIS! ABSOLUTELY! EVERYWHERE!My friend and I, two vegetarians who just wanted a damn cheese pizza and wasted 40 minutes of our lives we'll never get back, screamed at the top of our lungs.------------------------------------------------------------TL;DR?DO NOT GO HERE.

There are great options to eat at in the hotel and the lobby bar is fully stocked with alcohol and flat screens to wind down at the end of the day. The rooms are up to date and well tended to. If you have the opportunity to get a lake front view, you'll get a view of the entire resort pool and golf course - a nice view to wake up to! The luxurious bathrooms are boasting sleek marble tiling, oversized tubs and plush bathrobes - nice touch for the guests. Try to book the studio suite - plenty of room for a couple with a sitting area! The pool area is huge and relaxing - includes a lazy river (which doesn't move too much so it's SUPER lazy...haa). The service at the pool is on-point and the servers are attentive and very friendly. Beware of the few squirrels that they have on site - they tend to go after unattended food so if you get poolside bar service, hold onto your french fries & chicken tenders! They are not shy! (I heard the resort has set up some traps to catch them but you're in the middle of nature...so it's sort of hard to rid them completely). With the resort fees, everything is taken care of - poolside towels, poolside floaties, activities, transportation to theme parks, and even some dry cleaning if you're an elite gold or platinum member!

They confirmed and admitted that they were getting complaints all night long and that this was an isolated issue with their supplier. They offered no compensation, So, we assumed they were right and we'd try again. My next 2 attempts in going were just as bad. The crab legs were either water logged, soggy, and impossible to crack (they would just bend when you attempted) or they would crack and the meat would be entirely stuck to the shell making it not worth the struggle. Now, I need to further explain that crab legs are a wonderful delicacy that me and my family have enjoyed for decades. This isn't my first rodeo eating them. We know how to eat them, and know the difference between fresh, ok, and bad crab legs. These were bad. For the price tag of $200 for 6 people, you'd expect nothing less than \\"great\\" but would settle for \\"ok\\". This wasn't the case for 3/4 of my attempts to enjoy them at NOri Nori. My last attempt was tonight. To make matters worse, when I explained to management that we only came for the crab legs that weren't any good, they advised me to make another selection from the buffet. They also stated AGAIN, that this was an isolated incident with their supplier. After a healthy conversation with upper management, they agreed to knock 10% off of our bill. I give them 1 star for admitting the crab legs sucked."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Simply the finest littlenecks raw bar in America.

We totally expected this. Once we we got the text our table was ready we soon realized it was this ridiculously placed table so crowded between 3 tables (yes, 3 - we were totally boxed in between a wall and tables on each of the remaining sides of the table) that a person at another table had to stand up and let my boyfriend in. The server couldn't even get to the table and had to like lean in over the table directly next to us. Hard to describe other than way too cramped. So the vibe/ambiance wasn't great to start. But anyway, we settled in and ordered. I got the vegetable hash plate and wasn't impressed. The vegetables were very greasy and the dish was covered with a layer of cheese (way too much), which I think contributed to the greasiness. My boyfriend got the corned beef hash plate which he enjoyed, but it was bizarre that toast would have been 4 dollars to add on. I got toast with my dish and it was one slice of thin, not homemade toast. Server was really nice and attentive, so no complaints there. So overall, I won't be back.

Yes, it is Friday night 6:20 when we placed the order). That's why you should have scheduled enough people to cover calls, pizza making and delivery. Don't have enough staff? Then you should be there. So when someone answered the phone we had to spell the name of our street four times. It's Railside, nothing exotic. Ok cool we painstakingly get our order placed.

Plus, while I've been waiting I've read other reviews. I wish I had seen them first. I could've went to Publix, bought the ingredients and have a pizza almost done by now. Needless to say when this blessed pizza gets here we will be taking a look before we pay, which I literally have NEVER felt inclined to do in my 40+ years of pizza enjoyment. Other reviews mentioned the lack of cheese, cold pizza, long wait times and other fissured pizza situations. As I wrap this up I still have no pizza. It's been over 1 hr and 20 minutes. My husband I'd heading out for Subway and I'm waiting here to tell the poor (and likely  overworked ) driver that we do not want the pizza. Sorry.

We had family in town for my mom's 50th birthday and we decided to meet up here. We were told it would be a long wait, which we understood with our party size. Turns out there was a private event, so it took even longer. Then, when we were finally seated, we were seated at separate tables. Extremely annoying considering our tables weren't even next to each other, but were in different rooms. We were so hungry from waiting (over 2 hours) that we didn't complain and sat down. Very little gluten free options. I got a burger, no bun...wasn't anything special. The restaurant was extremely loud, we had to yell to talk. Valet didn't even move our car the entire 4 hours we were there, just left it on the street (hopefully he locked it). I wish they would've been more upfront about the wait and the fact that we wouldn't get to sit together. Not worth the wait."},{"name":"True Food Kitchen","address":"222 West Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"One of my fave places to go with the fam in Austin.

My family and I spontaneously stepped into restaurant during lunch hours and it was surprisingly seated. We were seated promptly and were given the menus thereafter. We wanted to try out most of the menu items, as the restaurant has a daily menu and everything is super fresh. We ordered a dozen lobsters, a dozen shrimp cocktails, and 4 half lobsters. For entrees, we ordered the fish and chips, salmon, ribs, and also Gazpacho soup.They were started with bread, and it was super delicious. The bread was freshly cut and was rightly fluffy and flavored. Then came the seafood, all of our mouths watered. The oysters were so fresh, you can taste the sea in your month. The shrimp cocktails were huge in size and also delicious. Finally the lobster represented Boston lobster well. It was a lot of seafood, but we finished everything.For the entrees, the salmon melted in my mouth. The french fries and fish and chips were hot when they arrived - some of the best french fries I've had. The fried fish wasn't the usual fried fish, you can tell that the fish was high quality. The ribs were okay.The food was so good; I feel so lucky to eat here as a same day walk-in."},{"name":"Kizuki Ramen & Izakaya","address":"11830 NW Cedar Falls Dr, Ste 128","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"After an hour or so wait, yes that long after we put our name on the tablet list.

The other reviewers, Japanese oriented, were giving this spot the authentication so maybe that fed into our experience. The ambience, after the wait, is nice. The kitchen was bustling to get orders out, meticulously. The servers were mediocre, but serviced nonetheless. We had a couple of appetizers, but wasn't very memorable. We definitely came in for the ramen and that didn't disappoint. If you have time to kill, come and dine.

But last night's service had a couple of disappointing notes. I came here at 5:45 with a group of 9 colleagues to dine before an 8 PM show at the Dr. Phillips Performing Arts Center. It's a pretty ideal restaurant for a pre-show dinner, since the ambiance is a bit more upscale than most restaurants downtown... and the food is delicious and comes out of the kitchen pretty fast. We were very clear that we would need to be wrapped up soon enough to make it to our show... and that (unfortunately) we would need separate checks. We were served and done eating by about 7 PM. Great timing. However, our server seemed to have issues with splitting our bill. He disappeared to split our checks... and we could see him at the computer, but it took about 30 minutes to split the checks. We paid out ASAP and were out the door by 7:40. So unfortunately, we had to scramble to get to the Dr. Phillips Center before show began. Not ideal.Despite those issues, I liked the server. He's probably excellent with smaller tables/parties. He was REALLY nice and gave excellent recommendations. I think he may have just been a bit in the weeds last night. It happens to the best of servers. Also, there was a lack of pre-bussing. Empty beverage glasses sat on our table for most of the service... and we had empty plates that cluttered the table. Just a small issue, but it makes a difference at a tapas restaurant. It's nice to get a little extra elbow room when possible since the table can quickly fill up with plates.On to the positive. The food was yummy! I ordered the sparkling sangria, the hummus and the guacamole with shrimp. All delicious choices. Other folks in my party ordered calamari, eggplant, spinach, flan and tres leches, amongst other selections. The eggplant was probably the biggest hit. It was thinly sliced, lightly fried and served with a honey dipping sauce. Surprisingly, my absolute favorite dish was the spinach! Sauteed with honey, figs, garlic and shallots, it was simple but flavorful and made a lasting impression. I'll be sure to order that EVERY time I return.Another highlight is the overall decor and ambiance. The decor is colorful and Spanish-influenced, with a fun play on textures and antique-like furnishings. The lighting is very dim (makes it hard to read the menu), but the ambiance sets the tone for a romantic evening for two or a cozy dinner with close friends.Overall, this is a great restaurant. It pains me to give it fewer than 4 stars. But I'll definitely be back. Just with a smaller group."},{"name":"Counter Culture","address":"2337 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Some of the most delectable vegan food in town!

It is my favorite seafood/Italian place in town. It is very small with probably 4-5 tables, and you have to wait outside, so it can be brutal in the winter, but people still do it! The trick is to go during the week, you really shouldn't wait for too long. This time I went with my bf on Wednesday around 8:30, and only really waited about 10mins. We ordered the squid ink pasta Aglio Olio and the lobster fra diavolo, both full portions. The black pasta came out first and we devoured it, it was the one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. I could smell the garlic as our server was walking towards us, the flavors was so simple yet satisfying. The pasta was cooked in olive oil, but it didn't feel heavy at all. This is definitely something I would keep ordering. Then we got the lobster pasta, it had lobster, mussels, calamari and clams. Everything tasted very fresh. I don't like when seafood tastes very seafoody, if you know what I mean, but this was perfect. The sauce is a red sauce, it's good and not overpowering.

Our table ordered the Turkey Burger, Teriyaki Quinoa Bowl, and Ancient Grains, all were great and one said the Turkey Burger was the best she'd had. I got the Dashi Ramen, it was a bit underwhelming. Definitely a strong mushroom broth with some charred onions and grilled portobello that were tasty, but the overall composition just doesn't compare to other restaurant ramens, and the japchei noodles are always a fun texture but a bit odd for ramen. It's definitely not spicy by any means, I didn't notice the sesame chili oil.

BurgerIM touts being the fastest growing burger chain in the US. Seeing them across the parking lot from Costco, I was excited to try it for myself. Classic BurgerIMs: The classic BurgerIM is a mini burger, essentially a large slider. The portion size works well because orders come in duos (two burgers) and trios. This let's you have two or three different flavors in one sitting.\\nThere's a nice variety of burger patties such as beef, chicken, lamb, and turkey. For vegans it looks like there is a vegan option as well. BurgerIMs come standard with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and pickles. Premium toppings include avocado, bacon, fried egg, and sauteed mushrooms. My favorite so far is the Angus beef. The burger had a nice quality taste with a solid balance of beef, vegetables, and sauce. Big BurgerIMs: The big brother to the classic BurgerIM. Options include dry aged beef, falafel, and salmon. None of which are commonly found at other burger places.Wings: The chicken wings are huge! It may be a preference thing but I liked the wings even more than the burgers. I tried the sweet crunchy chilli garlic sauce and will be back to try the others.Fries and sides: The fries hit the spot without tasting overly greasy or salty. The onion rings were awesome, crunchy indulgence. The sweet potato fries were a nice healthy option.

Warning: Definitely not the place to go if you are looking for something fancy like a date. It is quite a small restaurant with maybe 5-6 tables. They don't take reservations, so you have the best chance of being seated if you go in off-hours. The restaurant is essentially a kitchen next to tables. There are no paper menus; you just look on the wall. Everything is super, super casual. CASH ONLY, BY THE WAY.I got the black (squid ink) pasta with putenesca sauce (olive-anchovy butter, sauteed mushrooms, onions, peppers). The pasta was quite delicious; you eat it fresh out of the pan in which it was cooked (along with the casual theme of the restaurant). It comes out sizzling hot. The pasta had a nice chew, and the sauce was quite delicious. All of the ingredients came together quite nicely, although I wonder why they charge close to $25 for a dish with no actual seafood or meat inside. It seems a bit not worth it to pay for just the squid ink color. Anyways, the calamari + linguine in red sauce is also good, but the sauce can't compare to the putenesca that comes with the black pasta. It is slightly spicy and the calamari is cooked to tenderness.A very nice experience and a great place for seafood lovers (namely squid, clam, oyster, mussel lovers)."},{"name":"Lighthouse Lobster Feast","address":"7675 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"2.5","text":"The food was not good .

I would have gotten a second if I wasn't so damn full by the end.They had their popular fried pickled asparagus available for an appetizer (not on the menu, but a frequent special) which was sooo good. Try it if you can.Now this is my only gripe with my experience here at Moonshine. I tried the HEAD-ON SHRIMP & GRITS with tasso, corn, and tomato for dinner. In the literal sense I wish someone had told me that the shrimp literally still had their gross black-eyed bulbous heads attached to their bodies. It was definitely unappealing to look at, especially since I gear towards seafood because 99% of the time the unpleasant parts have been trimmed away. For $25 I also wouldn't say it was worth it, I mean, grits is corn and then more corn on top? Isn't corn like the cheapest thing on the planet?Anyway, dinner was salvaged by dessert. We tried the s'mores brownie which wasn't as cozy and delicious as it sounded because it was cold (it comes in a skillet so it's supposed to be piping hot and gooey).

If you are traveling from anywhere that has good Thai/Vietnamese food (we're from SJ/Bay Area) skip this spot. While looking up must try places in Portland, Pok Pok sits at the top of many lists. So naturally my girlfriend and I decided to check this place out. It was actually the very first place we went to after arriving and settling in.We got to Pok Pok around 5pm on a Wednesday and got the last available table without having to wait; fantastic start considering other reviews said the wait could normally be 45min - 1hr. Looked at the menu for about 2 minutes and knew we would have to try the famous Fish Sauce Wings (we got the \\"Spicy\\" version) and thought we would try their take on Cha Ca as well. We ordered, ate some complimentary peanuts, and listened to staff explain to every table that the water's funky taste was due to infusing it with pandan leaves. The food arrived very quickly. Spicy Fish Sauce Wings: These wings were SUPER JUICY and the skin was crispy. The fish sauce taste was for sure there, but the spice was completely missing. I wish the wings were a little less salty and wish they had a kick to them. But overall I liked it (4/5). My girlfriend was disappointed with them (if you're from the Bay Area, she likes Bonchon and San Tung better. I agree those two places are more flavorful, but I appreciated that Pok Pok's wings were still crispy without feeling super fried). Cha Ca: this dish was really disappointing. The fish was cooked very well in terms of texture, but the flavor was lacking. There wasn't the hit of turmeric that this dish is supposed to have. But even if the flavor was there, the portion was really tiny. If I had came by myself, I would not have been full by this dish alone. I can't justify paying almost $16 for it. (2/5)On our way out, we saw a line had formed of at least 5 parties and overheard the wait would be an hour long. Pok Pok is really small, while we were eating there were only 7 parties (including us, and many of which were parties of 2) dining in. If you still want to give this place a try, by all means go ahead, especially if you're traveling from an area that doesn't have many Thai or Vietnamese food options. I don't think the food is bad, I just don't think it could compete with other Thai/Vietnamese restaurants.

I expected a heavily creamy goat-cheese-loaded luxury, but the red pepper, fresh tomato, and dash of olive added a surprising lightness.\\nThe Crepe Suzette was a disaster that tasted like a bottle of peroxide.\\nThe Crepe Au Sucre was a standard sandwich of sweetness, the Au Fruits Savages was a boisterous berry concoction, and La Tropicale is a fun fest of canned citrus.The thing that annoyed me about the Creperie was the temperature of my food. With the kitchen a mere ten feet from my table, my crepes should have been gooey-hot, but they were lukewarm at best. Overall, the Creperie is actually reasonably priced, and the groupon buys a lot of crepes. Just make sure to bring a friend.

It was almost like they cut up some tomatoes and stuck them in the microwave with a little basil to warm it up. Gross, I know!! I also ordered a house salad and the only thing on my plate was a cup size of spring mix leaves. Yep, that's it, nothing else, and all for around $8!

Counter Culture's food uses fresh, healthy ingredients  to make twists on hearty, not so healthy meals that taste great, even for non-vegans.Brunch is my favorite meal at Counter Culture. The brunch menu has eight to ten options, some of which are rotating specials. My personal go-tos are the weekly pancakes, which generally include a seasonal fruit and a chocolate or vanilla sauce topping with a side of maple syrup, or the tofu rancheros made up of ranchero-ed tofu, beans, and tomatoes atop corn tortillas. There isn't anything on the brunch menu that I haven't loved. For brunch there usually isn't a wait (a rarity in Austin) but if they're busy, service can be on the slower side. Service can be a little hit or miss, and there never seems to be enough ice in their water, but the quality of the food makes up for these problems.For lunch and dinner, Counter Culture features many more options, including appetizers. I like the BBQ jackfruit sandwich and the Rawvioli. Both meals are great and come with your choice of side. Unlike the brunch menu, not everything here hits it out of the park. Still, there are a lot of solid dishes here, but only a few that keep me coming back. Don't miss out on the Counter Culture brunch.

They were good, but compared to that other place, not as flavourful. The price is pretty good, at $1.25 a skewer, is another cheap bargain in this food court.

This offered us a casual people-watching opportunity while we enjoyed our drinks. They serve sparkling water free of charge. Upon the server's recommendation, I ordered a Marigold's Gimlet. I was not disappointed by my choice. It was a sweeter cocktail, but its freshness and complexity balanced this out. We waited a brief 5-10 minutes before being moved to a hightop table (kudos for the purse hooks under neath!). Not feeling very hungry, I ordered the pickled  seasonal vegetables ($5) and my hungry friend ordered the Cassoulet ($11) and the Harvest Pork Belly Ramen ($12). Reasonably priced, in my opinion. My friend was full before she finished and took half her noodles home with her. I wished I had been hungry enough to try the server's recommendation of the Fire Roasted Green Farro. I read the other reviews and am confused by how different my experience was from those who dropped 3 stars or less on this place.

The decor was really lovely and interesting. That was where this experience started and swiftly stopped being enjoyable. We sat ourselves at a booth inside, it was the most janky uncomfortable booth, the seats felt like they were 50 yr old diner booths that had never been fixed just badly patched up. You know those booths that just completely sink when you sit in them. So much so that my feet came off the ground and im 5'7\\" within 3 min my back starting to hurt. The waiter came over to take our order, he was fine. We ordered a vodka soda and a beer while our friend was still deciding what to have. Our waiter brought our drinks and didn't get our friends order. We decided he would be back soon so we would figure out food and be ready for him to get our food order too when he came back. We looked at the menu and it was honestly unappealing. Its so high brow with no middle ground. Steak tartare and  pretentious $13 salads. Nothing substantial really and totally over priced. We decided it wasn't our jam. We would finish our drinks and look for food elsewhere. They have a guest wifi network that pops up so my Husband went over to ask for the password to look up food. The rude brunette bartender kurtly said there \\"wasn't one!\\" And then turned her back and walked away. By that time the crappy booth was not any more tolerable then the fact that our server had disappeared and the bartender was being flat out nasty!. I flagged another employee and asked for our check. I told him how rude we had been treated and made an excuse for her attitude because she was having a bad day. Thats ridiculousness! Your a bartender. Don't take your bad day out on strangers coming to relax from their days. Finally he brings our check and my vodka soda is $10?!? And my mans unicorn beer is 4? Its the equivalent of a pbr?! I went over to the guy who brought our check and said that the ridiculous prices were the cherry on top of the terrible service and he said \\"I know its expensive \\". I told him our entire experience there was negative and he said \\"dont say that\\" . Charged me our full fee and told us stay gold might be a better experience. I will never be back here.

As a first timer, I had the Swami and the Golden Sunrise smoothie. The Swami was a curry of sorts, blending Thai curries with a mixture of kale, nuts, raisins and broccoli served over a bed of brown rice. It was delicious-with the raisins adding some nice character to the dish, nothing too spicy. Of course being the meat eater that I am, I felt that it was missing something (probably meat) or perhaps tofu? The smoothie was refreshing as well, consisting of dried mangoes, banana, and cinnamon - a nice finish to the meal.

The person who was taking names said the wait would be around 2 hours. However, if there were seats at the bar, it was first come first serve. We quickly made it for the bar and luckily found two seats.The person who took our order seemed unenthusiastic, didn't really give eye contact, and when we asked for recommendations on the menu the person seemed really uninterested. I understand if it was a bad day for that person, but that is still really rude to me. Throughout the entire experience, it was difficult to get a hold of the person, whether it came to asking for more water or getting the bill, the person who took care of us didn't really do a great job doing so.My friend and I ordered the Thai Ice Tea, the Sticky Rice, Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings and Neua Naam Tok (which is steak salad).As a disclaimer, I think every dish we got was not only expensive, it was also very small.\\nThe Thai Ice Tea was extremely generic. It tasted like any thai ice tea you could get from a super market.\\nThe sticky rice was nothing special as well, it tasted like basic sticky rice. The container it came in was cool, but the portion and taste was something that could definitely change.\\nThe Chicken Wings were definitely very delicious. To me, it's sort of ridiculous to pay 16 bucks for 6 wings but the wings were good. While I have a lot of problems with the rest of my experience, I could not deny the tastiness of the wings. The wings were delicious and packed a lot of flavor. I don't think they are the best wings I have ever had, but they are definitely good.\\nThe Steak Salad was also very tasty. I enjoyed the composition of the dish, the slight spiciness of the meat went well with the salad. I thought this dish was definitely something I would like to eat again, but not for the price tag. The portion size of this could be even considered an appetizer in my opinion.Overall, Pok Pok is not somewhere I would go again.

We got a table outside and the waiter tried to seat us at a table with 6 flies on it (they were feeding on something). It's ok that there are bugs outside under the Texas heat, but it's really sad that we had to point out that we don't want to sit at a table with so many bugs on it. The food wasn't pleasing to me either. I heard of a lot of nice things about this place so I'm sure some people do like, but not me. We ordered nachos for the appetizer. It only tasted ok. I'm not a fan of the vegan cheese and I didn't understand why they left the avocados in big slices in the nachos. For the main dish we both got the enchiladas special. I don't know if it was something they were just experimenting with or what. But they really shouldn't experiment with food when it tastes so bad. I was really excited to get food from the specials menu because the food I got elsewhere on the special menu usually tastes amazing, I'm telling you, not this one. One thing that's good though is the seitan that's in the enchiladas, so I ended up picking out all the seitan and ate it. We are leaving Austin soon and I begged my husband to take me here before we leave, and now I feel really bad. We could have used that one day on some food way better and have a great memory. The price we paid was not worth it at all. Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes but I'll say this - no restaurant should have bad food on their menu. I don't mean to attack anyone personally. I'm sure Counter Culture have been trying very hard and strived for the past 6 years. I'm really proud of you guys for being one of the most famous vegan restaurants in Austin. Like I said before, I heard a lot of nice things about you guys and that's why I was so determined to go. I'm sorry I didn't like the food or the experience and I'd much rather go to Bouldin Creek Cafe and Bodhi Viet Veggie instead."},{"name":"BurgerIM Midtown","address":"933 Peachtree St NE, Ste 951","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I went to lunch with a co-worker as we knew this was a new restaurant in town.Went to order and they told us they were out of a bunch of items including french fries.  That should have been a sign to leave right then and there.  However, we decided to stay.  We order and they say the burgers should be out in 10-12 minutes, well we get our burgers 40 minutes later!  I could have gotten a deep dish pizza sooner than these burgers. There are probably only 5 other parties in the restaurant so we were thoroughly confused why it took so long.  In addition to getting the food extremely late, the Coke machine does not work and the employees do not even have the decency to note they have a drink dispenser behind the bar.  We finally get our food and the employees delivering it do not even acknowledge how long it took acting as if they just delivered the food on time, \\"Enjoy your food.\\"We eat the food and the burgers are good, but certainly not good enough to make us want to come back with the terrible service.

Sadly, I wasn't impressed.The place was really welcoming from the outside and I was excited to walk in. When I walked in, it just looked like your regular buffet restaurant. It's not that the place looked bad, but I just felt it didn't really match what it had going on the outside. Got seated and our waiter brought us our drinks and told us to help ourselves to the buffet. Super excited to hear that because I was starving and I was definitely planning to pig out. My friend and I started off with sushi first. I was a little disappointed because there were a lot of empty plates and there was still roughly one more hour before closing time. Thus, I didn't have much to choose from and didn't get the typical rolls that I usually like. So far... not off to a good start. I snagged some udon noodles on my first trip as well and proceeded to my table to see how this all would taste. I loooove udon noodles and was really excited to try it. It was actually pretty good, but incredibly hard to eat because they didn't provide me with a soup spoon. They only offered regular table spoons... Now before you all jump to conclusions and think that's a little too demanding, I am dining at an Asian restaurant - one that's supposedly a higher quality buffet. I've been to plenty of Asian buffets and they've all offered soup spoons. So I really couldn't enjoy my udon noodles too much unless I was eating like a caveman, which is kind of what I had to resort to... but good udon noodles nonetheless. Now as for the sushi. I literally only liked one of the rolls/nigiri that I got... Nothing really tasted good and it was definitely not fresh. I was very disappointed in the sushi. Already disappointed, I wanted to try my luck with the hot food. Again, a lot of empty containers. I managed to get a plate full and again, nothing stood out to me. I'm not going to go through all of the items individually, but there wasn't a dish that was above average. They were each either average or below average. Needless to say, I didn't finish my plate of food. Overall, maybe I had too high of an expectation for this place or maybe it was just an off night, but this was not a good experience. Whenever I review a place, I also take into consideration the price point. I think that's important and if a place is going to charge you $30 for a buffet, it better be good. \\nWe did come an hour before closing. However, I would still expect food on the plates and containers, and if they're not re-plated, I would have hoped whatever I get that's left to be good, especially for this being a higher quality buffet. If they're going to close up shop an hour before closing, I would have appreciated the hostess not seating me down and to let me know that in advance. I will more than likely not be back to Nori Nori anytime soon."},{"name":"Hit The Spot Cafe","address":"5121 Albert Brown Rd","city":"Garfield","stars":"4.5","text":"Good food, great service, awesome price what else do you need?

When it opened several years ago the huge selection of sushi was authentic, unique, and \\"clean\\" like sushi should be. There were only 1 or 2 suspect concoctions like a \\"Sandy Springs\\" roll (named for the local neighborhood), and the hot bar had a handful of Americanized dishes for the less adventurous. Many of the clientele were Japanese ex-pats, which I took as an impressive endorsement of authenticity and quality. It developed a reputation as THE best Japanese buffet in Atlanta. Today, it's not the same. Within the past few years, it seems, different management arrived with a different business model. Still a broad selection of sushi, but most of it smothered or even drenched with mayo, some sweetened goo, and in one case even sriracha (?!?) More seaweed sushi than I've ever seen anywhere, and less sashimi and in smaller slivers than I've ever seen elsewhere. Little-to-no shrimp. Anemic mussels and clams. Brittany Spears' \\"Oops I Did it Again\\" playing a little bit loudly over the speakers didn't help the atmosphere.Further downgrading the experience are \\"don't take more than you can eat\\" laminated messages which are posted at virtually EVERY table. Scan the dining room, and they're under your nose EVERYWHERE.

The menu was a bit confusing because you have to read through the description clearly unlike most Thai places where they separate soup, salad, noodles, and rice plates. Another plate I order was this chicken curry noodle soup but for some reason, I think they gave us whatever soup they had left because there were more noodles and big chunks of chicken then the soup which I was in such a craving for. \\n \\nDinner time is also quite busy so if you're planning To go, make sure you have something to do or go walk the block before they call you up.
