However, my experience here was just so different from all the great reviews here that I thought I should put in my two cents. I almost have to think that maybe the usual head chef was out sick the night I ate there.\\n\\nI'm a vegetarian who loves trying new vegetarian-friendly places. I went with my friend who is not vegetarian, but is veggie-friendly. The space is cute and I liked the decor. The bar seems a little out of place in the space, but I'm sure it's nice to see for some people.\\n\\nEverything we ordered was either not cooked correctly, or just did not taste good. I ordered the Nest, while my friend ordered a trio of sides and yucca fries. A rundown of each item:\\n\\n1. The Nest: The dish lacked flavor, and the fried noodles made it feel very heavy. It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't eat it again.\\n\\n2. The \\"cheesy\\" cauliflower side - a huge disappointment. There was no \\"cheesiness\\" to it at all, and it lacked any flavor or texture. My friend couldn't eat it, and neither could I. \\n\\n3. The roasted carrots side - the carrots were not cooked correctly - they were hard and lacked flavor \\n\\n4. the wilted greens side - cooked okay, but not flavorful\\n\\n5. the yucca fries - probably the biggest disappointment. We love yucca fries, and have enjoyed them from many different restaurants. These were not only not cooked correctly to achieve the correct texture and flavor, but the homemade ketchup was inedible - it tasted like pure vinegar. The other sauce served with the yucca fries was also not to our taste. Not to mention that the price of these fries is criminal - it was $7 for 5 fries. That's almost $1.50 per fry. Insanity! \\n\\nMy last few thoughts: it's a bit overpriced, but I'd be willing to give it another try in 6-12 months once they've had time to fine tune their menu. Perhaps it was just a bad night for the kitchen - we witnessed another table send back an order. I'd like to see more main dishes on the menu that aren't breakfast or veggie burgers."},{"name":"Grand Day Cafe","address":"1284 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This is a lovely little maw and paw breakfast and lunch joint.

The beef rolls are pretty standard - come on, green onions, beef and hoisin sauce is *always* gonna taste good.  Having Chinese style cold buckwheat noodles was a first for me.  It's thicker and nowhere near as sublime as prime zarusoba, but the mustard sauce was interesting.\\n\\nThe cumin lamb noodles were good and I really think the shaved noodles is the way to go rather than the thinner hand-pulled noodles.  The only complainant is that it was pretty oily, but if my miser mom can grudgingly admit it was good despite the 'high price' and the high traffic of 'gwai los' thanks to Guy Fieri's annoying show, then it's pretty legit.\\n\\nBut, not really worth the lineups in my opinion.

Free parking in Atlanta is ALWAYS a plus in my book.  =)\\n\\nAround 6 pm, the three of us walked into the restaurant and were immediately handed a menu to look over as we made our way to the cash register to order.  Having looked at their menu online earlier, I already knew what I wanted - the Asian Chicken Crunch Panini with Kettle Potato Crisps.  Full paninis are served with your choice of Kettle Potato Crisps or Green Apples.  I ordered, paid, and was handed a number to set on my table so that the server could bring my food over when it was ready.\\n\\nWe didn't have to wait long for our food, which was great!  I would say it took about 10 minutes.\\n\\n* Asian Chicken Crunch, Full Panini ($7.39; $7.98 including tax) - Per the menu description, this panini is made of \\"Almond Rosemary Crusted Chicken, Ginger Apricot Coleslaw, Cibatta Bread, Avocado Aioli.\\"  It came out hot and certainly fresh - and once I took a bite, I was in food heaven!  =)  The Almond Rosemary Crusted Chicken was so flavorful, and the Ginger Apricot Coleslaw and Avocado Aioli went very well with it!  The Kettle Potato Crisps were fine but nothing different from what you can buy from the store.  Although it may not look like much, I was stuffed after finishing my panini and chips!\\n\\nMy sister ordered the Grilled Chicken BLT Panini ($8.09) with Green Apples and my friend got the Grilled Salmon Panini ($8.59) with Green Apples.  I'm glad I got the chips because they both said the apples were really sour, but they both really enjoyed their paninis!  As a bonus, they stuck a lollipop in each of our paninis!\\n\\nOverall, Fresh to Order gets 4.5 stars (I have to round down to 4) because the food is great, employees are friendly, and the price is right as well!  Again, I love that parking in the garage is free for the first hour, which was enough time for my group to enjoy our meals.  All three of us loved our paninis and definitely plan to return!\\n\\n[Review 093 of 366]"},{"name":"Waypoint","address":"1030 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"So, we were in town visiting family and came here! Totally disappointed. For the prices you'd expect something amazing! Myself and my mother split the lobster cacio e Pepe, note I just came back from Italy so I knew what I was expecting. This pasta was so undercooked, the pepper in it was NOT finely cracked at all so you would have bites of large pieces of pepper - not appetizing. Then we also decided to share the large $60 steak. Also a mistake - they over cooked the whole thing. My husband enjoyed the raw oysters and then wanted to try the burger. Do not get the burger - I repeat DO NOT.

It was highly disappointing service. The theater itself is very nice, but I would not recommend coming here for dinner and a movie. As expected, it is dark in the theater. So when you're eating your food, you can't see what you're eating. I ordered a salad with shrimp- eating in the dark, I ate a shrimp tail. Seriously. Should it not be common sense to take the tails off of the shrimp for a customer that you know is eating in the DARK?! As it is new, the staff obviously are new as well and have no idea what they're doing. My mother in law ordered a bottle of Prosecco, she opened it (again in the dark) thinking it was prosecco and it was actually Pinot Grigio. We told the waitress and her response was \\"the bartender told me this is Prosecco so we can't refund you or get you a new one since you already opened it.\\" WHAT! We also got into the theater at 5:21, just in time for happy hour which concluded at 5:30. The waitress took over 10 minutes to get our order, but that was fine since we were told if we got into our seats and pressed the service button before 5:30, we would still get happy hour pricing. The waitress came to us over 10 minutes after we pressed the service button (at this point it's 5:32) and she explained we no longer get happy hour since it's after 5:30. We explained to her what the other associate told us and she still said \\"I can't ring it up for happy hour anymore.\\" We insisted on happy hour pricing, which she then agreed after we explained the situation again. But when we got the bill we were charged full price. We explained all this and more to the manager after the movie was finished and all he did was try to make excuses for the poor service and other incompetences we experienced. Neither the manager, bartender or the waitress know the difference between Pinot Grigio (flat wine) and Prosecco (sparkling wine). We spoke to him for over 20 minutes as he kept walking back and forth from the back and back to us to \\"negotiate\\" what should be taken off our bill. \\nOverall, it was highly disappointing.

No beans at all, except for a tiny little sliver at the bottom of the burrito. And my god, was it salty. I could hardly taste anything, and my mouth stung with saltiness for about thirty minutes afterwards.

I got about 50 feet away from the building before I thought it best to check my order and it was the wrong food! By this time, I was hungry and not at all pleased. I went back to the restaurant and waited another 10 minutes before I received the right food. The single egg roll was not worth $2. It was very small. When I got back to the office and began to eat my food, the crispy honey chicken was AWEFUL! The rice was blah and the chicken did not have that much flavor. The chicken was also very dry and over cooked. The egg roll (which was mama's egg roll by the way) was just okay and definitely not worth $2. \\nThe portion sizes were also a disappointment. Everything about my trip to East Wave Fusion was not a good one and I doubt I will return. It Just seems as if the staff was not prepared for the lunch rush.

The couscous had fantastic flavor and the carrots we delish as well.

There were about 5 appetizers to choose from and I'd say about 25 entrees. I believe Patrick told us that the full menu has +125 options! Wowza!\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I got the \\"Zingers\\" as our appetizer. They are essentially fried chicken tenders tossed in your choice of sauce. My boyfriend wanted BBQ sauce and I wanted Hot sauce so we asked Patrick if we could do a Hot/BBQ combo. He said \\"Sure!\\" So glad that they were able to do that. Oddly enough, there are places where they won't let you mix sauces (*Cough Winking Lizard Cough*) For our entrees,we each ordered a salad; he got the Southwest Seared Flat Iron Steak Salad and I got the Blackened Chicken Breast Salad. \\n\\nI would say the Zingers were my favorite part and I honestly could have just eaten those as my meal. I loved the BBQ/Hot combo and the meat was perfectly cooked with delicious breaded coating.\\n\\nOur salads were great as well! I loved the blackened all white meat grilled chicken on mine. I also liked how there are two dressings on top; a garlic-lime crema and balsamic vinaigrette. Adds that special kick to it! Also sidenote: Whenever a salad has tortilla strips in it, you just can't go wrong!\\n\\nAs we dined, we chatted with Patrick. Such a nice guy!

For those more like me, definitely order an appetizer to pick at it in between your bites of uni soba. The dragon ball was the perfect appetizer for that! The uni itself was fresh and buttery though :)\\n\\nAt the very end, they gave us a broth to pour into the left over dipping sauce which turned it into a soup we can drink (tastes similar to miso soup lol).

Because it's instant! There's the ballroom, which is the main place you will walk into and probably eat. It's a large space with beautiful chandeliers. And there's a library, where you can meet the beast and take photos! Oh! Don't forget to take photos with the mosaic of Belle and the Beast too! So much happening but they are all great!!

I think it was $60 a person. You get 3 entrees. I've got the octopus for my first course and it was yummy! Tender and not chewy, like you would expect. My sister got salad and she liked it. She said it wasn't drenched in a salad dressing like some places like to do. I've got my filet and first time, my steak came out wrong and sent it back. My server was not happy about that but, I am paying good money to get some filet! I had to take it back. When it finally did, it was just normal filet. It didn't really melt in my mouth. It was filet that I probably could have done it myself. My sister had lamb and it was more tender than my filet! And dessert... oh how disappointing! I did not like any of them. They give you 3 samples. Chocolate truffle, gray stuff that tasted like marshmallow fluff, and raspberries macaroons.

I love vanilla-rooibos!! The mousse was so light and creamy with a distinct tea flavor and worked so well with the chocolate cake which was dense, but not too sweet. The green tea ice cream complimented it quite nicely. The kit-kat bar was okay. It tasted like a better version of a Crunch candy bar, hha.\\n\\nOverall, excellent experience. I've tried 70% of the restaurants on property so far and Jiko remains my #1.\\n\\n\\nP.S. -- Now that I think about it, I've had excellent meals at the handful of African inspired restaurants that I've dined at.. -- Wish there were more options in NYC!"},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Very disappointed with our experience. Our reservation was set for 5:50 pm, told they were running 15 behind (no big deal). Once sat we had roughly a 10 minute greet time, easily 15 more minutes for our fountain beverages, appetizer (soup) was another 25 minutes, entree 20 minutes, desert 15 minutes, request the check 15 minutes, payment process 15 minutes...that's right nearly 2 hr dinner, in the music box room that was louder then any cafeteria I've ever been (voices & dishes clatter), we literally felt like we were in a cafeteria. Food was TGI Friday's quality at best. The bill for three was $200.38 before gratuity (no alcoholic beverages ordered) another $40.00. I asked if they accepted Tables in Wonderland (Disney dining discount card $175) was told no, and no annual pass holder discount, nor no military discount (it was Memorial Day), way to honor your troops. Regardless of an applicable discount the food quality was poor, the ambience in the music box room not much higher than a children's hospital cafeteria, & the price/value was NOT there!

This was some of the worst Mexican I have ever had - EVER.  It was cheap, but not as cheap as Felipe's in Harvard Square (or Anna's Taqueria, for that matter), both of which use MUCH fresher ingredients.\\n\\nThe rice, both in our burritos and on the side, was plasticy, tough, and near-fluorescent yellow with bits of square carrots and peas mixed in.  This is not something you'd put in your taco or enjoy as a side-dish; it's something you'd serve to a toddler who generally avoided his veggies.  And you'd get it from a box...\\n\\nWe ordered our burrito with everything on it, and it was came out very meat, rice, and bean heavy.  Doing the same at Felipe's or Anna's would get you a burrito that also has salsa, cilantro, and other flavorful crunches.  They did give us a side-dish that had a small amount of guacamole, sour cream, onions, and some pico de gallo.  Served on wilted iceberg lettuce leaves, and in one of those awful-for-the-environment styrofoam containers.  Yuck.\\n\\nThe salsa that came with the meal was some sort of watery tomato paste with minor cilantro.  The one piece of tomato in it was square and clearly from a jar or can.  It was about as appealing as any jarred (non-fresh) commercial salsa, and they served it in the smallest imaginable container - it lased us about 5 chips.\\n\\nI will say the Flan was good.  I was glad we ordered two slices since it turned out to be the most appetizing part of the meal.\\n\\nOur other entree was chicken enchiladas.

It was busy but the space lay out on tables is interesting so the flow of traffic was very open. \\nMy fiance wasnt impressed with first reaction. The few items he wanted were low or out due to lots of people. However they were fairly quick to replenish. \\nThey have about 6 tables of food plus two tables for sushi and a create your own hibachi station.

Prefer the other location where you tell the guy what you want and they get items\\nTypical food dishes. But they did have several dumpling and sticky bun options that was not at the other location we go to. Decent for buffet. \\nThe kids items looked a little sparse and I never saw the pizza replenished. It could be it goes that quickly. \\nNow I will go back as I thought the flavor was okay for what it is. You shouldn't go to a buffet with expectations the food is going to be amazing.

Lots of time wasted over and over requesting various sides that are available. 2) Price creep. The menu board says $9.65 for the average lunch bowl, but they fail to mention obviously enough that steak will run you 2.25 add'l and bell peppers, of all things, cost 50 cents too. Lunch recently ran me over 13.00, a price I am not comfortable with psychologically. They need to revamp their menu to make it clear what folks will be paying at the counter. 3) Very slow service. Chipotle is about 80% faster on the food line. 4) Most ingredients are tasty, but the steak was very tough and chewy as well as very fatty. I like the tofu instead, but I won't be ordering the steak again.

I've had better experiences at some of Fresh To Order's other locations such as CNN Center and Cumberland Mall. Generally, I like how this chain offers a healthy, fast-casual, dining out option. However, I've never actually craved the food at Fresh To Order. I seek it out only if I want to eat a relatively healthy meal.\\n\\nAt the time of writing this review, Fresh To Order has 10 metro Atlanta locations along with several out of state. This location is on the ground level of the Spire condominium tower in Midtown. Fresh To Order will validate parking for up to one hour in Spire's parking deck. Parking in the deck and metered parking on the street (7th St NE) is limited. We weren't able to find a spot, so we ended up parking in the Metropolis deck (about one block north) and buying stuff from Sweet Hut to get two hours of parking validated. The Metropolis deck has more parking spaces and its restaurants and retail tenants offer validation for a longer period of time than Spire.\\n\\nThis Fresh To Order location has a fairly spacious dining room and patio. I think this place gets most of its business at lunchtime. We visited for a weeknight dinner and business was fairly slow. There were several employees just sort of standing around and doing nothing despite there being multiple messy and uncleared tables. The place also had a funny smell to me. At night, the restaurant is dimly lit. There were TVs playing CNN. Like the other Fresh To Orders I've been to, this one has an open kitchen with a flame grill.\\n\\nFresh To Order serves panini sandwiches, soups, salads, burgers, and entrees. They also sell brownies, cookies, and cupcakes and have a kids menu. Expect to spend about $8-11 each for many items and about $12-15 each for most big entrees (known as \\"entree long plates\\" on the menu).\\n\\nWe ended up ordering two long plates (they are so named because the actual plates the food is served on are long and rectangular): the Coconut Curry Chicken ($11.50) and the Chicken Wild Mushroom ($13.60). According to the menu, the Coconut Curry Chicken comes with coconut curry sauce, fire-grilled chicken, roasted corn relish, wheat berry rice, and baby greens and the Chicken Wild Mushroom comes with mushroom cream sauce, garlic mashed potatoes, and roasted mushrooms.\\n\\nThe person who took our order confused us by asking what we'd like for our sides. I asked if the sides were included with our entrees and he said yes, so we picked two sides. It turned out the sides we chose were substituted for default items listed in our entrees. Therefore, we didn't get what we expected. For example, we got a garlic jack grit cake instead of wheat berry rice in the Coconut Curry Chicken entree and grilled vegetables instead of garlic mashed potatoes in the Chicken Wild Mushroom entree. This was disappointing because we were looking forward to trying those mashed potatoes.\\n\\nThere were two chicken breast fillets in each entree. The meat was dry in both. The sauces were good. They were flavorful. The grit cake was delicious and my favorite item. It was quite buttery and I assume one of the unhealthier sides. The grilled veggies were underwhelming. They consisted of a small piece of corn on the cob, a slice of red bell pepper, a slice of zucchini, and sliced mushrooms. They were overcooked. The single slice of zucchini was too thin.\\n\\nFresh To Order has a tea and lemonade bar. I ordered a drink ($2.10) and sampled all the flavors except for unsweet tea. They were sweet citrus mint (tea), sweet tea, vanilla star anise mint lemonade, raspberry mojito lemonade, and mango orange lemonade. Overall, they were OK. There was no real standout flavor.\\n\\nAside from the service issues above (uncleaned tables, miscommunication regarding sides), the employees we interacted with were nice and our orders came out in a reasonable amount of time."},{"name":"Bobby's Burger Palace","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy, Gate 26 Concourse B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"This place sucks, just like Bobby's stupid face and his attitude.

The last straw  - the other night me and my wife went after work and as soon as we got their she was all over us for a drink order and when we took a minute to think about it she scoffed and made a comment to a second female bartender (so I knew we were off to a good night). I noticed the taste of the drinks were off so I started watching her pour after we received a watered down drink. When I asked the bartender if she could remake the drink she barked at me and told me that all drinks are the same pour and they are measured out...mind you she's pouring by hand without a jigger so the pour should be roughly 6 seconds on a vodka soda, starting the soda at second 4 instead she gives a total 3 seconds pour drowned in soda water - You're pouring Tito's Vodka, this isn't Goose or Belvedere, if a customer is unhappy with a drink you should remake it, not argue the calculation of the pour in front of a crowded bar.\\n\\nBoth times I have been here, the inside of the restaurant, is sparsely filled or basically empty.  Our first food order there they messed up the instructions on a cheeseburger (no cheese, and they added fried onions).  I got a half dozen on the smallest oysters i have ever seen ($3 a piece which is high for boston, never mind East Boston)  The mini shellfish tower was my best order but i was told that \\"it usually doesn't come that big\\" so I don't know if it is a consistent order. The menu isn't really creative and a little over priced an East Boston restaurant across the street from the projects.  I guess when you add it all up it explains the ease of finding an on street non residential parking space infront of the building.\\n\\nThe best part of the location (and probably the only part I will take advantage of is the free boat ride over to Pier6.

The broth was delightful and overly salty. \\n\\nAlso ordered the sweet sour chicken (for the kids) combo with an additional side  of fried chicken wings. Kids loved it. I would've loved it more if the fried chicken wings would've counted as one of the 2 sides but the 2 sides with the combo are set (both were very small plates of veggies). \\n\\nAlso ordered the blueberry green tea with boba (less sugar and ice because you can customize) and it was better than I expected for a restaurant quality bubble tea.\\n\\nAll in all - it was a good meal and a perfect way to start our foodie tour in Burnaby/Vancouver!

The Chocolate Almond Ganache donut was very rich and the almonds added texture but could not taste them. The ganache for everywhere, my clothes and all over the box, even with tissue paper separating the donuts. \\n\\nThe donuts themselves were fine in terms of quality, but maybe I got flavors that didn't pack a lot of punch shall we say for the price.

There are African inspired dishes galore, along with some things for those in your party that are less adventurous. There are several entry points to the buffet, so you don't need to wait starting at the beginning. I guess the easiest way to do this is by section, so here goes!\\n\\nMeats: At the beginning of this section is pap (a kind of grits) and fufu (mashed white and sweet potatoes) along with a spicy tomato sauce called chakalaka. Had to have that just for the name! As far as meats go, there's always a good selection. This time was a white fish with tomatoes (a little overcooked except for the center section), pork tenderloin (awesome) and strip loin (amazing!!). There was also spiced chicken, which I skipped this trip - although last time it was very good. The bobotie is also in this stretch - it's a spiced meat and egg pie. Sounds weird, looks weird, tastes delicious! \\n\\nVeggies/Rice: There is always a large variety. This time I tried the broccolini which was really good, and at the suggestion of our server, the sweet corn and spinach pudding. I think I could have eaten a whole dish of that! There were rice and couscous selections, but I stuck with the veggies.\\n\\nSalads: I skipped most of this section except for the papaya, grapefruit, and avocado salad which was outstanding. I \\n\\nSoups: My father-in-law pretty much makes a meal of just the soups and desserts. That's how good they are! They do rotate selections, but they are always excellent. This time I chose the sambal chicken and corn chowder. It was super flavorful with just a little kick from the sambal. There was also butternut squash, seafood coconut curry, oxtail stew, lentil and mulligatawny. They were all tried by some member of our party, and all were excellent. The one that fell short was the lentil - and that's really only because it had a hint of what we thought was lemongrass and it was a little offputting.\\n\\nDesserts: Zebra domes are always the star here, but a number of us decided that we liked the Kenyan coffee tarts, the guava panna cotta, cassava cakes, and bread pudding better. We only ran into one problem - the plates at the dessert station were extremely hot by the time we got there, so a lot of the desserts started to melt. They still were excellent!\\n\\nOverall, Boma is one of our favorites. There are plenty of options, and this is a place that anyone can find something they like. Yes - it's on the pricey side, but well worth it.

There were some choices that seemed like traditional African dishes, but not many.  I think they wanted to keep the food more family friendly, as most of the buffet options would be considered \\"safe choices\\".  You had the typical scrambled eggs, bagels, Mickey Mouse waffles, donuts, etc.  I'm not quite sure just how authentic tator tots are to traditional African cuisine, but what do I know.

I was so stoked because The West Wing is really difficult to get into. \\n\\nI was so excited to eat there! For my appetizer, I ordered the Escargot. The escargot was a little buttery, but delicious. For my entree, I ordered the Center-cut Filet Mignon. Of course I ordered it medium-plus and it was spot on! Lastly, for dessert, I ordered the White Chocolate \\"Chip\\" Cup. It was so good! I finally got to try the grey stuff that everyone's been raving about. The stain glass under it is also edible. They also gave me birthday card and a complimentary grey stuff that was Mickey Mouse shaped. \\n\\nIf you can, I totally recommend trying to get a dinner reservation in The West Wing. They allow you to make reservations six months in advance. It is definitely the coolest out of the three rooms and definitely the hardest to get a reservation for.

I sat alone at the bar for close to 10 minutes before anyone noticed and asked if they could bring me something. I love tequila and tacos, but am no expert by any stretch. However, if you spend $11 per margarita and $16 for 2 fish tacos, you should expect that your meal be above average. The tacos were below average, thanks to a mound of super watery pickled cabbage that leaked more with every bite and tiny, flavorless pieces of fried fish. The sides of rice and beans were also flavorless and clearly from a pot that was made way earlier in the day. I ordered a side of queso early on to go with the free (yay!) chips, but it did not arrive until after I was finished my entire meal and closing out. \\nThe one saving grace was the great bartender who was working. After he saw that the bartender working my side of the bar had not noticed me for ten minutes, he took over service. He was clearly the only one who was making drinks for the entire restaurant, but did a good job keeping up with that and also checking in with me throughout. \\nOverall, I just paid $50 for a one-person meal that I feel could have been beaten taste-wise and service-wise (except the bartender) by any chain serving fish tacos and margaritas for half the price."},{"name":"Bobby's Burger Palace","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy, Gate 26 Concourse B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I had the same order as last trip, the Bobby Blue with a side of onion rings.

The angels sing when I eat the pasta. I have been lucky enough to eat at several Michelin starred restaurants and Frasca can hang with that crowd. My best friend is a vegan and they always accommodate her cheerfully. The service is amazing. Everybody does what needs to be done. The owner will bus a table and clear plates, if that keeps things running smoothly. The staff is efficient, but friendly. I feel like I am at friends for dinner when I eat there. One of my favorite parts of eating there is the wine service. If I get a glass at the bar, or a bottle for a special occasion, the sommeliers are happy to give you suggestions. Their suggestions are always spot on. The only problem with Frasca is they have ruined most other restaurants for us. They just don't measure up.

He said \\"my vision is to rent kitchen space on different days of the week to different chefs and have them check in on Twitter so that the window serves the community all sorts of food.\\"  That sounded cool to me.   I asked if I could \\"buy\\" a 1/4 rack of ribs because I really wanted to try a little of everything and I was happy to pay, but just didn't need a third plate.  He said he would just throw in one rib for me to try.  I said \\"awesome\\" and he said \\"no problem\\".  I then tipped him a few bucks ($3 to be exact) because he had been so gracious to let me sample a rib and he didn't even charge me.  I got my boxed up & bagged up food and excitedly headed back to New Albany to give it a try.  When I got home I noticed there was no rib.  I was off work the rest of the afternoon, so I drove back to the Red Door (20 minute drive one way) to get my rib.  When I got there and walked up to the counter the guy that committed to giving me the rib (co owner) had his back to the window and the his co worker was working the window.  I explained that they forgot my rib and the co worker explained that they couldn't give away a rib.  I said \\"What?

I would absolutely be weary of doing any business with or leasing space from a co owner of a business that can't deliver on one rib to a new customer that is more than willing to pay.  It seems silly even writing about this, sounds like a scene from \\"I'm gonna get you sucka\\".... \\"how much for one rib?\\" But, I had a plenty of money on hand to pay for some ribs, but again just didn't want a third plate as I had tried their other meats and all four sides with my 2 plate order."},{"name":"El Vaquero Mexican Restaurant","address":"3580 W Dublin Granville Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"I am giving this place 3 stars because I am not crazy about their Mexican food it is very Tex mex and I just am not a fan but their margaritas are really good and I get through one and am already feeling super good.

I've been meaning to stop here for almost a year.  And since it's burger week this week in the 614 area code I thought I would give this place a shot.  Well first off parking is ample but you're sharing a parking lot with the Mexican joint next-door. And then you have Starbucks on the other side. So parking can be tricky especially around the lunch hour dinner hour. Once inside you're greeted by a nice atmosphere.  And the place is clean.  As far as happy hour drinks go it's only a dollar off beer or a dollar off a glass of wine.  Nothing special. I ordered one beer and it is 12 ounces not a pint.  It was cool it would've been nice to be about 5 to 6¬∞ colder. I ordered the Bourbon burger. And my friend ordered the Bru Burger.  Snack size. And just so you all know the six dollar specials that are being run this week for burger week at least at this establishment is the snack size burger the small one. But it can be done snack size with any of the style of burgers they offer. I guess this is a good deal for those with a smaller appetite and a smaller food budget to work on.  I got the regular size half pound bourbon burger it was 11 bucks. And we split an order of fries they were large enough to do that amongst two people. Those were three bucks. I think it's homemade ketchup also. My burger was good I had it done medium well and that's how it came out and it was not too filling. They have a few other types of sandwiches there other than burgers as you can see by the menu pictures I posted. And service with the food was pretty quick. But the beer could be colder.

They also offer a juice, which is a mixture of tropical fruits and it is SOOO GOOD! My fianc√©e loved the juice, as well, and the meats they offered.

It is a vicarious thrill to watch, but I just can't go there anymore.\\n\\nI, on the other hand, am the soul of discretion. The master of moderation. I have boundaries and my stomach has limits. So while everyone raves about the famous Reggie Deluxe (biscuits with fried chicken, bacon, cheese and gravy), it has always been easy for me to bypass that particular gut bomb in favor of the simple pleasures of the biscuits with shitake mushroom gravy. \\n\\nI'm not a morning person, but I like waiting in line even less than waking up early. And circling the block for half an hour looking for parking? No thank you. The restaurant is incredibly small with only three tables and a few stools. So a couple times when I've been up at the crack of dawn anyway, I've decided to make the drive to Belmont and be one of their first customers when they open their doors at 7:00a. It is worth it. \\n\\nIn addition to the biscuits and gravy, I've sampled the grits which are seasoned with different flavors depending on the season. I've had grits at other places and found them exceptionally bland and boring. When I eat them at PSB, I get why people love them. The only thing I've ordered that I didn't enjoy were the fried green tomatoes.\\n\\nWhether you share Roger's appetites or are just in the mood for some simple comfort food, PSB has got it covered. However, if you are going to get frustrated by the lines, the parking, lack of seating and the wait for something special, do yourself a favor and drink one less martini the night before and try being an early bird.

The guy who was waiting on customers when I arrived was friendly and fun, but then he was replaced by another worker, who was efficient but more the sullen hipster type. \\nI really loved the donuts and definitely find them superior to Voodoo.  They are more on the gourmet, less gimmick-y side and don't taste as cloyingly sweet.  \\nWe decided to try three of the flavors: \\n\\nBlueberry Bourbon Basil:  This was definitely my fave, it was light, airy, yeast-raised and the glaze was very, very flavorful.  I could taste berries, bourbon and the basil, which was a great combo!\\n\\nOrange Olive Oil:  This was our visiting guest's favorite.  It was very orange, more of a cake type donut and had powdered sugar on top.  It was tasty for sure!\\n\\nVahlrona Chocolate Crunch:  This was very decadent and my partner's fave.  This would be a close second for me.  Very rich chocolate frosting, chocolate crunchies and a cream filling.  Yummo!  \\n\\nYou really can't go wrong at this place.

We were seated outside which would have been fine except for the chilly breeze that cut to the bone. We were greeted by our European want to be waiter with the personality of a bread stick. I do apologize to all the bread sticks in the world for that analogy. \\nIt would have been nice if they would have turned on the heaters they have placed on the patio. We ordered coffee to stay warm and tried to make the best of it because we thought the food experience would be worth the torture. EHHHHH!!! We were wrong. El Diablo ordered the Bison blend burger and fries. He said it tasted funny but he thought it might just be the bison blend. I ordered the Hash which was not too bad. I had to eat it rather fast due to the cold breeze cooling off each bite before I could get it to my mouth. My girlfriend ordered a la carte..2 eggs and fruit. She did not enjoy her meal . The aioli truffle oil on the hash was tasty but a little overwhelming. Just a smidgen is needed. \\nLater that day poor El Diablo started feeling ill. This illness progressed to full blown food poisoning with the food trying to make its way back out into the world from hence it came.

If you visit FINO make sure you stick to WINE and apps. \\n\\nUPDATE: \\n\\nI would like to add that the owner contacted me concerning my review. \\nHe wants to make things right and that is a very honorable thing to do. He could have just laughed it off and thought to himself that Mr. Smidgens's review was not worth his time. He did just the opposite and showed remorse and anger as he should have.

So when my kid came to town for a break, we knew we HAD to go to D6 for some sophisticated cocktails and to enjoy the rooftop patio and watch the rim of the stadium next door light up in its various nightly colors. This is our tradition and we love it and look forward to it.\\n\\nWe wished to go tonight, since my kid is leaving in a few days. Once, a year ago, we weren't able to get a seat and we were told we should always make a reservation to ensure we'd get in, so yesterday I embarked on the IMPOSSIBLE task of making a reservation for this lounge. I initially called the lounge but their outgoing message said not to leave a message if you want to make a reservation; instead, it said to email them your reservation request. So I went to their website, clicked on the link \\"Make a Reservation\\", and an email window popped up. I emailed them my request for a reservation for two for tonight at 7pm, and I requested that the email me back or call me to confirm. When I didn't get any email or call back in hours, I then called the lounge back and, despite the instructions on their outgoing message, I DID leave a message noting that I've emailed them, to please respond to me to confirm (or deny) my reservation, so I can plan my night with my kid.\\n\\nI didn't hear back.\\n\\nSo today is Monday. At noon I called the Parq Vancouver and told them my situation. They transferred me to the D6 Lounge phone where I again got their answering machine. I again left a message. After I hung up, I was getting ticked off. I called the Parq again and told the rep my situation, saying that I don't know whether or not to just show up at the D6 that evening, how I can't plan my night, is there ANYBODY there I can talk to? A real person, not an answering machine? He transferred me to the D6 Lounge's manager's office. And guess what? I got an answering machine. I left a detailed message, noting I've left emails and voice messages and nobody has confirmed my reservation and I have no idea if I should plan on going with my daughter there that evening. I implored them, please please call or email me back.\\n\\nThree guesses if anyone contacted me. \\n\\nNOPE!\\n\\nWhat the heck kind of business model does this place subscribe to? Certainly not one that is customer-based. It's like they don't want my business! I don't get it! \\n\\nMy kid leaves back to school in two days and we haven't gone to this lounge on this trip, and we will never go back. After all, who wants to patronize a place that categorically ignores you and who makes it clear that they don't respect your time and they don't want you as a client? Doesn't matter how beautiful a venue is; if I don't feel respected, I don't want to go."},{"name":"Chart House","address":"60 Long Wharf","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"My husband and I came here for a celebration and it was a very good experience! We were intrigued as the building used to be one of John Hancock's old offices, and it had a really neat look on the inside. The complimentary bread and crackers were warm and comforting. We started with the Shrimp/Crab/Avocado/Mango stack and it was a very good size for two people. The taste was fresh and just a little spicy. The only drawback was that we felt like it should have come with tortilla/pita chips or something because it sort of felt like we were eating salsa with forks. For entrees, I had the Crispy Coconut Shrimp which came with three very delicious dipping sauces (mixing the coconut cream and the chili sauce is a good idea, fyi). It was served on this bed of some type of puffed rice which just seemed unnecessary and kind of like packing material. The \\"mango sticky rice\\" on the side wasn't what I was expecting based on my love of the Thai dessert--it was more just regular rice mixed with mango bits, but it was still okay. My husband got the Prime Rib topped with Mushroom truffle butter. He ordered it medium rare but it was more on the rare side, but still very tender and tasty. The butter was okay though I had one tiny bite and found the mushroom taste to be a bit overwhelming (though caveat, I'm 8.5 months pregnant and just looking at certain foods the wrong way gives me indigestion). The mashed potatoes on the side were very good and not too garlicky. For dessert I had the Cheesecake with Strawberry Sauce and my husband had the Key Lime Pie. I was a little nervous after seeing one review that said the cheesecake was tiny and the strawberry sauce seemed artificial, but it was actually one of the biggest pieces of cheesecake I've ever seen (I couldn't finish the whole thing and am actually eating the leftovers as I'm typing this). The sauce was definitely made from fresh strawberries and wasn't too sugary. My husband enjoyed the Key Lime Pie, noting that it was a little richer than what he was expecting. For the portion sizes (we brought a huge bag of leftovers home), we found the prices to be very reasonable (we didn't have alcohol, so that kept our tab down as well). The only thing I will note is that service was a tad slow (as others have mentioned), especially having gone on a Wednesday night when it wasn't very crowded. Our server was very friendly though, and she never let our water glasses get even half empty."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Be Our Guest!

And I'd like to think I hit it on a bad day, but right from the minute we walked in this place put me in a mood.  So I called to make a reservation for 6pm.  We walked in about five minutes early and there were about eight empty tables.  The hostess asked us to follow her and she brought us directly to the bar.  Ummm, how could our table not be ready with eight empty tables???  Well it gets better...She then says, \\"you can sit where you'd like\\".  I said, \\"well we have a reservation.\\"  She then informs me we made a reservation to sit at the bar!!!!!  I was gobsmacked.  In what universe do you make a reservation for a bar stool????  So I said, \\"well when I called no one informed me we were reserving bar stools.\\"  She looked at me like it was the most normal thing in the world and said, \\"well we reserve both tables and bar seating.\\"  Ummmm....okay.  Not in my world, but maybe in yours.  So that sort of set the tone for the evening.\\n\\nWe sat at the bar and the guy who was behind it was very nice and did a great job, however, they were understaffed.  So not only was he serving the 12-14 people sitting at the bar, he was filling all the drink orders for the wait staff and had tables of his own on the dining room  floor.  So he was swamped, luckily our food didn't have to wait for him to bring it out, it came out very quickly and hot.\\n\\nNow you probably thought I was done talking about reserving bar stools.  NOPE!  As we are eating this man and his college aged son came in and the hostess brings him over to the bar and I hear, \\"well I didn't make a reservation to sit at the bar.\\"  Hmmmm....where have I heard that before I thought?  Well I guess I should have made the stink he made because he was whisked away to a table.  So the lesson here is if you get taken to the bar, and don't want to sit there, just cause a scene till you get what you want.\\n\\nMoving on....\\n\\nThe food came out hot and was okay.  Over cooked pasta, sauce was good and our meals were okay.  But nothing spectacular or maybe it was the whole reserving bar stools that completely has soured me on this place.  \\n\\nWe had desert and again it was okay.  \\n\\nWould I go back?  Probably not.

If you meet it on its terms, you'll enjoy it more than if you want it to be something else. That's kinda true about most places, really.\\n\\nDo expect: A bar, along with bar furniture. When I was here with Sara C., we were both a bit put off by the impracticality of the beer barrel stools and the lack of anywhere to hang or comfortably drop bags and coats. There were some tables with proper chairs, as well, and I believe there were some tables with stools with backs on them. But most seating is like this, making it sort of like sitting at a bar without actually sitting at a bar. Unless, of course, you are sitting at the bar. So it will help to think, \\"How nice, we've got our own little personal beer barrel bar.\\"\\n\\nAlso expect: Some pretty damn amazing guacamole. I could have vacuumed that stuff up. It's chunky. Big chunks of avocado, but not in the way that makes you think you're just eating seasoned avocado. If I return, it'll probably be for the guacamole.\\n\\nExpect, as well: The tacos will be smaller than you might be used to at the sort of restaurants where they pile enough food onto your plate to feed a family, but they're also cheap and good. I'm not sure you're getting as much food for the same price overall, but the taco-by-taco pricing makes the meal flexible, so you can sample anything you want. And I can vouch for the fish tacos. There's some definite yum there.\\n\\nMeanwhile...\\n\\nDon't expect: A typical restaurant experience. It's not just the furniture. Getting the attention of your server will feel like getting the attention of a busy bartender. It's much more of a flag-them-down place than a status-report-every-ten-minutes place. You really are at a bar, even if you're seated at an ordinary table.\\n\\nDon't expect: To find vegan tacos on the menu. The vegetarian ones are cheesy. I didn't happen to ask if they can be made without cheese, because even if they'll comply (I'd imagine they probably would), I like to judge a place on its own merits the first time I go in, and that means not asking for substitutions or omissions too often, even if that means consuming a little dairy now and then (ordinarily I'm a dairy-free pescatarian). Vegans could probably eat a full meal entirely out of sides and the June salad, but ask about ingredients if you're concerned.\\n\\nIt is worth a trip, especially if you're a guacamole fan.

I was able to try their vegan chorizo nachos, assam burger, and the citizen burger, all which were pretty good. Personally, I thought the burgers were a little burnt but the nachos were amazing.

That's what Boma officially stands for. Seriously. Mickey told me. Ok, he didn't. I made it up. But it's true!! I wasn't even hungry and then I walked in. Everything changed when I saw all the foods.\\n\\nWhy did I wear a dress w/ an elastic waistband?! Whyyy?! Because I'm a champion foodie and I like to be prepared at all times. Ok not really- but I did want to try a little of everything and I did! Everything was pretty tasty and I'd definitely come back again!\\n\\nBoma is located in Animal Kingdom Lodge and is a small, all you can eat, I mean, er, all you care to ENJOY restaurant. Reservations are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED as it's pretty popular. I had no issues getting in w/ my reservation. I was seated promptly and the service was good! Decor is simple and African/tribal themed. Okay, so now on to the food!\\n\\nSOUPS\\nThere were about 4-5 different types of soups such as Seafood Gumbo, Curried Coconut Seafood Stew, Lentils soup, Turkey Tomato Florentine soup, & Mushroom soup. I loved the variety & the flavors & ingredients were all on point. Seafood gumbo was my favorite! I loved the scallops! Couldn't get enough!\\n\\nHOT DISHES & MEAT\\nMMmmm...rice. Prime rib, cooked medium rare (or as you like). Delish. The highlight for me, other than the succulent, juicy delicious meat was the variety of sauces they had! Different colors & different flavors. All good and fun to try! What a cool tasting experience. I believe there was also lamb, salmon, and chicken as well. \\n\\nSALADS\\nThere were at least 4 different salads there, a mixture of classic American style salads/salad bar ingredients and some African inspired ones as well. \\n\\nDESSERTS\\nBrownies! ZEBRA DOMES (w/ alcohol)! Ooooohhh. Swirly chocolate goodness. And some exotic creations like Strawberry Mint panna cotta. Hmmm..I'll play it safe this time, but yea there was a little area of cool desserts. I was sad and disappointed there was no ice cream bar though.\\n\\nOVERALL- a nice, sit down restaurant giving you lots of variety and quality food items to choose from. There isn't a HUGE selection, but the menu items they do serve are quite good. No complaints. It's a simple little restaurant nestled in Animal Kingdom Lodge & if you tell the bus driver you're going here, there's actually a stop where you can go straight in-elevators-then ur there!

Exotic in a really good way! The proof is that there is never one morsel of food left on any dish that is ordered when I go to this special place. \\n\\nI figured out that they have one of my favorite things to order at any restaurant! Wait for it....it is called \\"The Taste of Africa\\". What this is, is a selection of 4 very different types of dips accompanied with a variety of breads to dip. I am not even going to try to remember the names of the dips, but they will tell you if you order it (and its on the menu of course). One of the breads is a naan like bread and another is like a crisp (pappadam I think its called) and one other that I cannot recall the name, but really delicious) This dish is so damn tasty and really super fun to eat (alone or with other people). I am not even going to try to describe the dips because they are so different than what Americans are used to here, but really they are so delectable and addictive you cannot pass up on trying this!!  The spices in them and in all the food here somehow really invigorate and inspire you!!! \\n\\nThey always have some really interesting soups as well and this weekend I tried the asparagus and goat cheese soup. So incredible, especially with the additional bread that is given on all tables. Just \\"sop\\" it up at the end as our wonderful waitress, Dawn insisted we do... \\n\\nThe filet minion is so tasty. It is one of the best filets I have ever had. It is served with some really tasty veggies and some kind of polenta patty which is really good as well. \\n\\nI have had many other items on the menu here and I have been completely satisfied and fulfilled with everything. \\n\\nAnother really cool thing about Jiko is the ATMOSHPHERE. It is so wonderful. It is African inspired and has the perfect lighting--not too dark and not too light--AND the SERVICE is really superb!! One of the best I've ever had. I have had several servers here and they are all attentive, knowledgable and fun.

I was a bit disappointed wit the gnocchi and our two main dishes were not that great.  I ordered the pork let which I heard was one of the Chef's signature dishes that he brings back each summer.

A tofu-fa Ë±ÜËÖêÔøΩ?basic is $5.50 plus $1 for a basic topic.  That's $6.50 vs. $5 at Excellent tofu.  That's a steep cost difference for a relatively same everything else.  Of course, this is a new store so everything is new and sparkly, if you prefer this instead.\\n\\nI will give a positive on their tofa-cotta, a take on the panna cotta.

A lot of their dishes are mildly addicting, so be careful as you might find it hard to put your chopsticks down! Because Hunan food is typically oily & spicy I would not recommend coming here and eating spicy food before a work day as you will most likely have an aggravated stomach the next day (not necessarily a bad thing though as the food is worth it).\\n\\n[Items Tried]\\n\\n*MUST TRY* Hot & Sour Rice Noodle - $8.95 (5/5)\\nTaste: Thinking back on this dish makes me salivate - the soup was the right balance of spice and vinegary sourness, the glass noodles were chewy, and the green onion and peanut garnish was just right. While a simple dish, I would definitely recommend ordering this.\\nPortion size: Meal size for 1 person.\\n\\nSpicy Chicken with Chili Pepper - $15.95 (3/5)\\nTaste: The chicken was fried to crisp perfection and was spicy and flavourful as it was fried with an equal portion of peppercorn spice - however, at the end, it was difficult to find any chicken left since the peppers used in the dish hid them all away! The reason why I took two stars away was because I felt like the chicken lacked actual meat and I was eating chicken skin the entire time.\\nPortion Size: More peppers than chicken, sharing size only for 2 people as the portion is on the smaller size.\\n\\nBoiled Fish in Sichuan Style Red Pepper Soup - $16.95 (4/5)\\nTaste: I love how this dish is served with bean sprouts and celery because I get to alternate between veggies and fish as I eat. The soup is hot, oily, and the right level of spice that keeps building as you continue eating. Despite how full I was at the end of this meal, I couldn't help but finish every bit of this dish as it was delicious. The reason why I took one star away was because I have had fresher fish at other restaurants at a similar price. I recommend eating this dish with rice to absorb all the oil.\\nPortion size: Sharing size for 2-3 people.\\n\\n[Value for Money]\\nA reasonable price point for decent family style Hunan food.

And nothing against the people who was working that night but man, management needs to work on staffing. There was seriously just two people- the bartender and the hostess I think. The hostess became the server and the busser. The bartender was bussing as well. And I am sure the chef at the back was pretty overwhelmed with the orders because I ordered the Salmone Alla Mostarda and even though the salmon was ok, the mustard sauce  tasted like it was squeezed out of the tube- like the heinz yellow mustard, so vinegary and not even a hint of sugar to tone it down. I have made mustard sauces- regular and honey- and this was by far the worst one I have tasted. Again, nothing against the chef at the back but I feel like he hd so much pressure to put all these orders out that I feel like he or she was starting to cut corners- not a good idea especially that theres a conference going on in the area and most of us just came  from there. To management, I hope that you at least sent reinforcements to help those 2 or 3 people busting their behinds working there.

On of the perks of being here is the fact you don't have to stand in long lines with drunks, and loud mouth people raving about a place that honestly is way overhyped. \\n\\nCreme br√ªl√©e, the chicken covered doughnuts and a few of their other popular varieties. The staff was pleasant and fun to be around. Besides cracking jokes and giving us the scoop of some of the best places to go While on vacation here. There was something else I noticed about the staff at Blue Star. They really seemed to enjoy their jobs. \\n\\nI'm so glad I was able to indulge my sweet tooth here because it's a fresh take on the modern doughnuts. The establishment is super clean and fun to be in. I can't wait to go back and try more of their other flavors.

I was kind of hungry, just driving, not really thinking about a new place let alone something to Yelp but there it was, on the left, as I made my way through hallacious lunchtime traffic. Buffet Palace. \\n\\nAdventure dining is my term that I coin when you see something, it looks iffy, but there could be great reward. There could also be salmonella, Ebola and small pox, but that is where the \\"adventure\\" part comes in. I turned on my turn signal and set my taste buds on yellow alert. As I unselfishly do for you, the people of Yelp, I was putting my gastrointestinal health on the line. \\n\\nI almost never tried the place. I walked in and saw that lunch was $8.25 plus another $1.25 for the drink but at least it offered refills. I stood there for a minute and thought about it, I looked in again and thought to myself, \\"There sure are a lot of steam trays in there.\\" I worked up the nerve, mentally subtracted $9.50 from my checking account and walked in. Sure is a fishy smell when you walk in, and really really loud string quartet music, at least it drowned out the hosts broken English greeting. \\n\\nI ordered my diet cola from the waitress and proceeded to grab a plate and wander through the valley of the steam trays. It all looked pretty decent, fairly fresh, well stocked and quite diverse. I picked some safe options and not so safe options and proceeded to do this three times before a fourth small dessert plate. Here are my findings: \\n\\nThe Good: \\nWalnut Chicken \\nWon-tons (I think they called it cheese dumpling) \\nSpring Roll \\nCelery Shrimp \\nTeriyaki Chicken \\nGenerals Chicken \\n\\n\\nThe Bad: \\nShrimp Dumpling (What was in that?!) \\nHoney Chicken (Too damn sweet!) \\nThe Music that was piped in \\n\\nThe Ugly: \\nWas never once offered a free refill and even after I asked it never came. \\nCheese & Crab Bake \\n\\nIt was, all in all, a somewhat better quality lunch buffet than say Panda Buffet in Tigard and Milwaukie but with almost double the price tag.

The Bao had slow braised beef, chilli hoisin sauce and scallions in it, and when they say slow-braised, they truly mean it. The meat was tender, fresh and absolutely packed with flavor.

I thought we'd be at Animal Kingdom all day, but because we were so hungry, we headed to AKL early, hoping they'd seat us earlier. Unfortunately, it wasn't until right at my ADR at 7:50 that they seated us. I really don't understand why, because there was plenty of seating--this place is pricey, the ADRs don't really fill up, anyways. \\n\\nWhen we were seated, the server confessed to us that she too, came to Disneyworld on her honeymoon many years ago, and I thought that was funny. I wouldn't mind getting a job here when I'm old, so I can just enjoy being at Disneyworld. \\n\\nThe ambiance was very sophisticated, the lighting was such, that it complemented the light outside. As sunset approached, the lighting inside became a little dimmer too. I read on Disney Tourist blog that this place gives off a fancy Lion King vibe and I can confirm that's true. I almost wish they played jazzy instrumental songs of the Lion King Soundtrack to complete the experience.  I saw the Jiko stove at the center of the room but I didn't get a good look at it. I wonder if they actually use that, or if it's just for show. \\n\\nOur server was very kind and attentive. She asked for our drink order then gave us some bread to eat. It tasted like standard wheat dinner rolls with some salted butter, but I still enjoyed it. We sat around for a while before we finally got our food, so I was absolutely famished when it came. \\n\\nThe food is excessively expensive so hubby and I shared the Braai Mac & Cheese and the short rib. Really our server went above and beyond, now that I think of it. She actually requested to split the dish so we could have our own plates, even though we didn't ask her. I wish I could remember her name, but if you get an older caucasian woman who says she came to Disneyworld on her honeymoon, that's probably her. \\n\\nThe Braai Mac & Cheese was divine, if not a teensy over-hyped! Chakalaka was a tomato based sauce with peppers and onions at the bottom. It added an interesting texture and sweetness to the dish, but the MC would've been better with less of it. The mac was al dente to the bite. There were bits of sausage in it to make the dish heartier too. What really made this good was the cheese. There were so many different flavors - creamy, tangy, delicate cheeses all working together to make a cool mac & cheese. One thing I didn't like is that my mother in law's portion looked bigger. She eats like a bird, I should've gotten her mac & cheese, but whatevs.\\n\\nThe short rib was very delicious too, if not a bit fatty. The microgreens and rainbow carrots on top was very flavorful. I picked off the veggies from my hubby's plate in exchange for giving him the fatty pieces of my short rib. There was a creamy yellow sauce  and a small bit of sweet jam on the side, perhaps added to cut the saltiness of the dish. The short rib though fatty, was flavorful, fall-off-the-bone and well cooked. I enjoyed eating the dish, but would've enjoyed it more if it weren't so expensive!\\n\\nAfter dinner our lovely server came by to give the whole table some coconut macaroons for dessert and she gave my husband and me an extra chocolate dessert for our honeymoon. The macaroons were sweet, coconutty and citrusy. She probably brought that out because she didn't want to leave out my in laws. I enjoyed the chocolate dessert. The texture was like cold nutella without the weird hazelnut flavor I've gotten sick of. And there was also a crispy thing, whipped cream and raspberry on it. I enjoyed this alot. \\n\\nIn the end, would I come back to Jiko again? Although I enjoyed the food, I'd much rather try different resort restaurants before I come here again.

I think it's very timely, as I visited this pizzeria today and a few things have changed since my last review.\\n\\nThe slices are still great. The people are nice. The decor is the same. The prices however went up yesterday, and I think it's across the board. \\n\\nThe 2 cheese slice/soda combo is now $5.50. Still a good deal, until you add a topping to the slices. Somehow my combo was $7.19 today, and it wasn't a mistake. Apparently if you add a topping to the slices, it nullifies the combo deal and you end up paying a la carte. I think this is BS, and the owner needs to fix this or he's gonna hear complaints six ways to sunset. \\n\\nI still enjoy going here, but I may have to give up toppings for the basic 2-cheese slice deal. :/"},{"name":"Gami Sushi","address":"10111 Number 3 Road, Suite 126","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"My parents recently moved to Richmond so they were in search of a new go-to restaurant for their sushi cravings. We came here on a Saturday afternoon when it was moderately busy, enough that we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table so it wasn't unreasonable.\\n\\nI can't remember what I ordered but I think it was the assorted sushi combo with a pint of sapporo (which they also forgot until midway through our meal and when we asked for it). My parents ordered their own dishes and for the portioning and pricing, everything was okay. Service was pretty average and minimal so it wasn't terrible. Wasn't too expensive in my opinion but the taste was about average. On another occasion, my aunt had also ordered a party tray from them for a house party and it was pretty much all gone within 15 minutes.\\n\\nOverall, I give them a 3/5 because it's not the best sushi out there for sure but the place is quite lively and they clearly have good business.

Oooh this is absolutely the perfect combo for the incoming cold winter!\\nI really really wish they could keep serving this!

The crust was thicker than a lot of my go to places (Gatto's, Pizza House). I can't wait to try it again."},{"name":"Atlas","address":"88 W Paces Ferry Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I'm not sure how this was categorized as \\"Bars and Burgers\\" because it's definitely a fine dining restaurant.  Is there another Atlas in the neighborhood?\\n\\nThat said, we went here for a birthday and I was really impressed.  There are places where the food is the star, others where the room is the star, and still others where the staff are the star, but at Atlas they're all stars and they never missed a beat.  \\n\\nOn the room, don't be put off by the dark wood and think you've stepped into a 1970's steakhouse.  The lighting brings up the mood beautifully and there's just enough of it to notice that there is some very serious artwork on the walls.  The restaurant is owned by someone who has an art collection valued at near $2 Billion according to one of the staff, and he rotates it between Atlas and his other properties.  I didn't recognize the artist on the wall closest to us, but there was a Picasso on one column in the room and a Modigliani sketch on another.  You usually don't get to see this stuff without paying admission.  Flowers also soften the room, making it comfortable as well as beautiful.\\n\\nThe food was also terrific.  We started with the pierogi puffs, which were a real surprise.  I'm used to getting pierogis on the lower east side in manhattan, so I was expecting little dumplings--not the case.  These were little puffs of truffle laced goodness mixed with roasted mushrooms and little chunks of the most tender beef I've ever had.  When a menu says 'Waygu' I assume they're using some kind of generic term, since it never seems that different from a decent regular cut of beef--this was different.  It melted in my mouth...literally.  Then we moved on to the pork chop, cooked perfectly so it was just barely pink in the center and tender as could be.  They served on grits with ramps--a great accompaniment.  We also got the white striped bass, which came on a bed of vegetables.  It was crispy on top and meltingly soft and fragrant in the center.  Cooking fish well is harder than it looks.  How to get just the right crispiness on one side without overcooking it seems to be a challenge.  Atlas has the formula down pat.  \\n\\nFinally, and it may be the best for last, the staff there are really incredible.  I've had many dinners where the wait staff were tired, or harried, or having a bad day, or whatever.  On a good day, they're friendly and make you feel like they appreciate that you've come to dine with them.  At atlas, every single interaction we had with the staff, from the hostesses to the waiters, the sommelier, and even the people busing the table felt like they were not only happy that we'd come, but somehow overjoyed to meet us.  And it wasn't that weird Disney-esque plastic I'm-so-glad-to-see-you thing, they actually stayed at the table and engaged with us enough to make a solid impression.  There is something pretty magical about the staff at Atlas.  We've seen it at a few other places, but not many.  Whoever finds the staff (I don't think this kind of thing can be trained to just anyone) is doing a great job.\\n\\nGreat restaurant, great people, great food--can't wait to go back!"},{"name":"Brick & Fire","address":"1621 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I went on ladies night with my bestie and we had a great time.

I got The Herbivore and she got the 4 Cheese and we were both so happy we got to-go pizzas to bring home to our guys. \\n\\nThe wait staff wasn't particularly outstanding or friendly, they were mostly neutral. For one example, when we walked in, the hostess looked at silently and after an extended pause said, \\"how can I help you\\" I almost laughed but I refrained. It was just an odd comment, like obviously we would like to eat here. Maybe that's too picky but I feel like hostess' should greet you with a 'hello' when you walk in.

I've never been too impressed by the food but the breakfast sandwich I recently had was fine. It was an egg and sausage pocket with nothing too remarkable flavor-wise but it did the trick. The biggest issue I've always had with this place is the coffee itself. I'm not positive if it's the beans or the preparation but I've more often than not had a bitter experience, and the coffee is not cheap. I've tried a few different types and one time even negotiated a deal on a cup by buying a retail bag (since this tasted fine at home, it leads me to believe it is a water/prep. issue on their end). My guess is that people who put sugar and cream in their coffee are unlikely to notice anything off. My ice coffee this morning was also not very good, drinkable but not the tasty treat you expect from a good iced coffee. They seemed open to feedback the one time I tried talking to them about it. Considering the neighborhood now has Buteco, Mediterranea, Full Commission, and the new Little Tart in nearby Summer Hill, they've got to step up their coffee game if they want to capture more quality concerned people. \\n\\nI like the layout of this place and being across from the Zoo on Cherokee their location is very convenient. It's surprisingly big inside and it can be a good place to get some work done. I also like that they offer ice cream and are family friendly.

It was constantly changed out and fresh. The hibachi was really good and the hibachi chef was very friendly and helpful. But our waitress was rude to us, not sure if it was because we were a group of 20 year olds or what but she was very short with us and I thought maybe she was having a bad day until I saw she was being friendly to other tables she was waiting on. After I paid (and included a tip) my sister tried to ask her for a to go cup but she looked right at her and kept walking, TWICE! Because of the experience I had I'm not sure if I will return.

Service started out ok, as our waited introduced himself and started taking drink orders. It was over 20 of us in total so you would think they would have assigned 2-3 waiters/waitresses to tend to just us. Nope! There was 2 but they were both assigned to other tables which were also large parties. You can imagine it took forever to get everything we ordered. Our drinks didn't come to the table until a half hour after the initial order. I understand its busy but wow, I've never experienced this before in any restaurant. Our reservation was set for 7pm so most of us was there before 7:15pm. We didn't order our food until after 8:30pm. Apps came out 1st, once again about half hour to 45 minutes later. I had ordered the Kimchee calamari which was dropped on the other end of the table, resulting in the other guest eating it. I asked where my calamari was, they said we will put it in again. Long story short because of their mistake of putting it on other end of table they didn't charge us for that calamari. Our actual dinner didn't come for about another 40 minutes after that. One couple who ordered last in the group got their food 1st, ate and paid their bill by the time everyone else's food came. They left right after that. I had the special which was the Halibut with Oscar style. The sauce for the Oscar was this thick paste like spread which ruined the lump crab on to of the halibut, I scraped it off and placed it to the side. Just horrible!

I visited Taka sushi after an American friend's recommendation, but I was heavily disappointed in my experience there.\\n\\nAs the place is known for its fish, I decided to order the chirashi zushi, which is a rice bowl topped with a variety of sashimi (raw fish slices).  However, this 29$ plate was small, with only about 12 slices of sashimi.  The rice was cold, dry, and stale - which I cannot imagine any sane Japanese person serving...  The tuna was mostly comprised of ligaments (white bands of tough filaments) which is generally considered crap parts of the tuna.  The rest of the sashimi were very thinly sliced and dry.\\n\\nThe dish screamed leftover pieces of fish on leftover rice.  For a 29$ plate, I felt insulted.  Unfortunately it was my friends birthday dinner, so I could not make a scene and complain.  Oy vey.\\n\\nMy friends ordered a variety of other dishes - sushi rolls, the sashimi salads, baked fish, stewed meat, and the specials.  Aside from the baked fish (hamachi kama seemed good), we were generally unsatisfied, especially as most of the dishes are appetizer size and run 10-20$ a plate.\\n\\nThe rice and miso soup are not included in a meal and must be ordered separately.  And to top it off, they charged me extra for a cup of green tea...  I dont think Ive been ever charged for green tea at a Japanese operated restaurant.  I was trying to end my meal peacefully with some hot tea, but that did not happen either...\\n\\nService was fine,with frequent water rounds, and our waitress was pleasant.  The interior had a pleasant ambiance, but the tables are somewhat closely placed.  I could hear way too much of the neighbor table's conversations...\\n\\nNow, I believe that if someone likes a place it isn't my place to judge.  We all have different preferences.  It seems like alot of people enjoy Taka Sushi.  However, in good conscience, I could not recommend this place to any of my friends.  The quality of the dishes are unacceptable for its high price.  Ive had better sushi at a local sketchy pan-Asian restaurant...

But the style is different, and I'm sure you will find something that you love.\\n\\nOur waiter told us that the some items on the buffet rotate from night to night. My favorite items on this Saturday were: tomato stew, BBQ ribs, sirloin steak, coconut chicken curry soup, seafood stew, and the spiced shrimp. I was especially impressed with the sirloin and the shrimp. The sirloin is carved for you on the spot. It was tender, juicy, and flavorful. I loved the shrimp.

(Tuesday night). So we get in and are cheerily greeted by the host, he brings us to a cute little table by two other groups. We proceed to sit there for 15 minutes with no attention or waters at all. We are finally approached by a server (who seems to be a little flustered because apparently he didn't know he had our table) we then go ahead and order everything we wanted for the night, eggplant cheese dip, the ex pat (an eggplant sandwich) and an order of Brussel sprouts. Also a bottle of wine. The wine came 30 minutes later. No joke. The table next to us was served their cocktails and drinks and two courses of food while we were waiting for our wine. So we finally get wine, and then our cheese dip shortly follows... only to be served with disgustingly stale chips (host tried one and took half off the dish for is as compensation) but it took the entirety of eating this dish to get our servers attention and get new chips that weren't stale. (We just ate them because now at a 50 minute wait time we were starving). Then finally our food is rolling out, Brussels were good (could have used a little more cook time in my opinion) and the eggplant sandwich (the ex pat) was fine... the bread was grossly soggy but the insides were fine.. which is all I ate. We also ended up getting the Havana Egg Roll, which was by far the best thing we ordered. How can you mess up something fried, right?  Towards the end of our dining experience our severs mood turned around and he was quick with things, only to realize he had been with a private party of 10-15 in another room the whole time.... so why would he have our table in the first place? It was a terrible experience to be honest, and the food did not make up for it at all. Also, when we received our check... we were charged for an item that we clearly didn't have... and our promised discount for the stale chips hadn't been applied so I had to ask about this.

In the main room, the windows have snow falling on the mountains; the west wing is dark with the rose & a changing picture--from prince to beast & the ballroom has a huge sculpture of Beast & Belle dancing (our hostess said that it was the music box that Beast gave Belle on their first anniversary). As for the food, like I said it was amazing.   Like Cinderella's, its a 3 course fixed price menu; at least for dinner.  To start we got the escargot & French onion soup.  Daughter loved the escargot!! She had never had it, said it was like nothing else she's ever had. She even used the bread to mop up the extra sauce when she was done--was surprised (& relieved) she didn't lick the plate clean. My soup was ok, but I've had better French onion--it was overly salty and too much bread/not enough onions.  Entrees we got the filet & the pork tenderloin.  My mouth is watering just thinking about that filet. Easily one of the best steaks I've had in my life. Perfectly cooked (medium), perfectly seasoned, just perfect period.  It came with mashed potatoes--silky & delicious, & roasted veggies that were the perfect al dente style texture--not too crunchy or too soft.  Daughter got the pork tenderloin; which actually had equal parts tenderloin & pork belly. She enjoyed both immensely, but didn't enjoy the corn & fava beans it came with as much.  (I thought they were good...) Dessert is a 3 piece sampler--a raspberry & lemon curd filled macaron, a white chocolate \\"chip\\" cup filled with grey stuff & a chocolate/hazelnut truffle.  Daughter thought the macaron was a little too sour, I dislike raspberries so I didn't try it.  We agreed the grey stuff was delicious--tasted like a cookies & cream mousse--light & fluffy with just the right amount of sweetness. As for the truffle, I loved it but daughter thought it was just ok; I think because it wasn't overly sweet? (She enjoys Nutella on toast so I think when she saw chocolate/hazelnut she thought of it & it was more of a semisweet rather than super sweet flavor).

On this trip, we were by ourselves and looking to enjoy a special evening at one of Disney's signature meals. We have rarely been disappointed at all of the previous one-dining-credit locations. We really didn't feel much of a difference at this two-dining-credit establishment.  In fact, for myself, I ordered the seafood curry dish, and was very underwhelmed. The dish could be described as lukewarm at the best. I told an employee about the problem and she came back later with just a slight improvement. The chocolate brownie cake dessert was very dry and basically inedible. My wife's entree, the lamb shank, however, was very good. Unfortunately, our server did not really help with the experience. He was very inattentive, and we were left waiting on him on several occasions. The tables around us had three different guests in the time that we were there.

It was hopping with people coming and in and out for to-go food. This seems to be where they get most of their business.

Overall okay, 3.5/5.\\n\\nI had the jollof rice with chicken. This was the best thing we ordered, 4/5. The chicken was juicy, the vegetables on top were really good. The rice itself was pretty good, not as good as I might expect for it being a main dish here, but good. It had a very distinct flavor, maybe seasoned with saffron or something like that.\\n\\nMy mom had the peanut butter soup with fufu. Fufu is sort of like a very sticky mashed potato/dumpling dough ball that you theoretically use to scoop up things. She thought it was okay but the soup was pretty spicy.

You're definitely paying for ambiance\\n\\nDinner was amazing! The food was delicious and meeting the beast was an incredible bonus. The restaurant as I already mentioned is stunning inside. I like the sit down aspect and ordering off a menu better than the quick service options they have. I would 100% pay to eat here again.

We had a reservation and were quickly shown to a table next to the window - it was that single digit day so I asked to be moved to a different open table nearby but were told \\"we can't, as we are putting those two tables together\\" so we sat next to the window.  20 minutes later, a 2-some was seated at the very table we wanted. \\n\\nThe menu is fairly limited - classic Italian dishes, nothing at all out of the ordinary.  We ordered salads plus Chicken Piccata and clams with red sauce.   The salads came out almost immediately and we could  instantly tell why - they were both ice cold and it was clear they had been stored in the fridge, I mean the tomatoes in my Caprese salad almost hurt my teeth because they were so cold - my wife said the same thing about her green salad.  \\n\\n\\"Luckily\\" we didn't have time to finish the salads as our mains came out before we were done with them (and believe me, we were not dilly dallying).  So we pushed the salads to the side. My clams consisted of about 8 or 10 littlenecks which seemed a decent amount surrounded by a HUGE pile of linguini drizzled in the most bland red sauce I have ever had. My wife's chicken was a VERY modest portion with the chicken cut into small pieces served on one plate with artichoke but her pasta side was served in a separate bowl - the same linguini with red sauce.  Red sauce with Piccata?\\n\\nMine was so bland it could not eat more than 1/2 and my wife finished her chicken, leaving the pasta untouched.  We asked for the check and looked at our watch - exactly 45 minutes after we arrived for our reservation.  \\n\\nOne final thought on the layout, yes every restaurant needs to have TVs now but the layout of this place has tables so close to the bar with one guest facing the bar that I could see the changing brightness from the TV reflecting off my wife's face all night.   She found it hugely distracting. \\n\\nThe next time I want Italian in Wayland, I'll open a jar of Rao's at home.

My first time there I definitely remember wishing there were more options in terms of burritos, enchiladas etc. Out of the food I've tried, my favorite is the classic burrito with chicken. However, you should know before ordering that the burrito is solely made of chicken and all the other ingredients listed are on the side. I also love the chicken tortilla soup, but can never finish a burrito and a soup. In the reviews, people had complaints about the chips and salsa, but I very much enjoyed them. I haven't tried the guac though because it seems very overpriced for the amount you are given (a very small bowl). As far as drinks, the house margarita is the perfect size and price for me, and you can add a flavor to it for an extra dollar or so. As far as seating, I would recommend requesting to sit near the windows--the back is a little bit dark and removed from the action. \\n\\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend going to this restaurant for a drink and some Mexican food.

Prosecco $6, 49 North red and white wine $5, draft beer $5, and cocktails for $10! It would be nice to see some happy food added!\\n\\nThis is not a venue for younger folks, which means you will not find a bunch of rowdy, sloppy, and inebriated 20 somethings hanging off the bar and pool table.

Business casual, so put your fine threads on!\\n\\nD/6 is tastefully decorated with elegance and style, and dare I say a little sexy? The lighting is soft, maybe even a little romatic, but not as dark as bars like Prohibition. Cozy couches and chairs throughout the lounge, even the bar stools are cushy, and plenty of outdoor seating and space for mingling.\\n\\nWe came to D6 on a Tuesday night at about 8:30 to play pool. It was relativley quiet, which meant we didn't have to wait long to play.  I hear it gets \\"line up\\" busy on the weekends and it's highly recommended to reserve yourself a table and/or arrive early. Bottle service is also offered for $$$. As I sipped my vino and melted into the ultra comfy, low profile couch, I realised that it didn't matter as much that I was losing at pool, because I was very fond of this lounge.\\n\\nPhenomenal bar service with talented mixologists, whirling you liquid masterpieces, while entertaining you with their antics. DANIEL gets a shout out for being especially wonderful!!! Not only was Daniel incrediably funny, but he was mad serious about making sure my girlfriend's Bourbon Sour was on point! We had a good chat and laugh with the bartenders and they all seemed as classy as the D/6!! For drinks, I stole a swig from my friends Moscow Mule and just had to have one. It was just stellar!! After ordering the Charcuterie I decided to switch to wine, for obvious reasons. Wine is overpriced, as per usual, with $14 for a 6 ounce glass. The by-the-glass wine list is a rather small selection and I wasn't blown away by the options. Its hard being a wine snob. Bottle wise, there are a lot more options, but again the prices are a little cray. I appologize, I forgot to grab a snap of the wine list and I can't find one online either.\\n\\nI was pleased with the food menu, with lots of deliscious options and resonable prices considering the upscale ambiance. Menu is share plates, think tapas style. Day menu is served 11:30-9:30. Is there a \\"night menu\\"??  With Daniel's suggestion, we decided on Charcuterie and the Margarita pizza, but I had to add chorizo of course! The Charcuterie was a good size and presented well, but I was disappointed there was no bread and only crackers. I was also sad to see no blue cheese on the board and no real spicy meat. I guess it was a little lackluster for me personally, but still enjoyable. I wonder if the board ingrediants change regularly or if you could request different selections? The Margarita pizza with chorizo was also a satisfactory size and I don't have any compliants to mention (cause we ate it all). I look forward to tasting more food here in the near future.\\n\\nOverall, this lounge gets 5 stars for ambiance and service, but loses a star as for the food and wine list, as some improvements could be made. I will visit again soon!\\n\\nUpdate: my last experience at D/6 was not as good as usual. I was drinking gin martinis, which were tasty and no huge complaints there, but when I tried to explain to the server that I wanted my martini dirty, but \\"classy\\" dirty not like \\"working girl\\" dirty, she didn't get my comparison. I ended up with one Olive in my Martini!! On my next drink I asked for extra, which at the end of the night I was charged for. Super not cool. The other mishap was our server didn't let us know the kitchen was closing even though we had menus. In the end they made us a cute little snack dish with almonds and olives, which I assumed was complimentary. Well, it was not.\\n\\nAlso, according to the manager that I spoke to earlier in the night, you can no longer reserve tables after 8pm on a Friday/Saturday without required bottle service.

The place is not as unsanitary as people have said in previous reviews.  In fact it appears as if quite an effort was made to make the outdated place look fresh. The food is decent, plentiful, even if sometimes just a little less than flavorful. The service was efficient if not just a little on the brusque side. \\n\\nPREFACE: The following is a review of my second visit to the buffet Palace. If you don't wish to read an unfavorable review of this place you can stop reading now. \\n \\nUpon my entrance to the restaurant three other men also entered. The other men were apparently African in appearance and since I am also a dark skinned person, the hostess assumed we were all together and even exclaimed, \\"Party of 4?\\" Whereupon I answered, \\"No I am alone\\". The hostess then proceeded to ignore me and address the three gentleman in the group. She asked if they were going to have lunch or dinner since they are two different prices and there was only 20 minutes left for the lunch price to be in effect. A debate then ensued amongst the three gentlemen while I stood there waiting to be seated. \\"I'm just having lunch\\", I said. \\" You can't wait until I'm done serving these gentlemen\\"  The hostess snapped back. Whereupon I promptly walked out of the restaurant. \\n\\nNow it is my understanding that courtesy is expressed and interpreted differently in different cultures. Also, being a person of color for my entire life, I understand that in certain Asian cultures, darker skinned people are not expected to be treated respectfully. People with darker skin are generally considered by many Asians to be less intelligent, lower on the social ladder, and unworthy of respect. (I'm not here to debate anyone on this point. It's a well-known fact.) \\n\\nThis coupled with the fact that no one made any attempt to stop me from leaving the restaurant tells me that they don't value my business and don't care whether I eat there or or somewhere else. PS: The Hometown Buffet was right next-door cleaner and had a better selection of food."},{"name":"Pho Phong Luu","address":"9200 N Lamar Blvd, Ste 104","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"I have been to this location before, but now it is under new management so there is a new menu & they still made me some nem nuong cuon (grilled pork sausage spring rolls) and they were delicious!!

I highly suggest the earnest on acid, amazing, refreshing drink. I love that they use big whole glass ice cubes in their drinks! Classy touch! We then ordered the clam pizza, lovely and garlicly, very good!

We figured that the sparkling wine was our birthday gift but we were surprised when the staff brought out birthday dessert for us. the birthday dessert donuts were to die for!

Initial taste, it was a little salty but I did grab a fork full of cheese. So I mixed it up and achieved a \\"good bite\\" it was good. But then it wasn't. Something was off. I kept eating and then noticed the sauce to noodle ratio was off. The noodles were too dense because they didn't use regular spaghetti noodles but more like the corkscrew noodles. It just didn't help the dish. The lobster, on the other hand was amazing. I picked out all the pieces and then called that dish a wash. \\n\\nAmbiance was nice.

I had to beg for almost 30 minutes for someone to take my receipt and give me my food!

This Beauty and the Beast themed restaurant really pulls all the stops when it comes to decorating. When you enter, you have three room choices to dine in. The first is the ballroom from the Beast's castle, which is the largest room, features a balcony, and was decorated for Christmas. A second room is, I believe, the library. A little more boring, but still nice. If you're looking for a change of pace, the final room is dimly lit and rather dark - but in a very cool way! Check out my pics to get a feel for it.\\n\\nFood is good. Not cheap, but great if you've got the Disney World meal plan and want to use one of your meals for this occasion. I opted for the cured meats and cheese platter, as I'm pretty big on all things charcuterie. The meats were the MVPs of the plate, but everything was delicious. Marmalade was an unexpected choice for the jam - I find myself more accustomed to fig jam or some type of sweet and savory combo - but it was good and worked, despite the fact that I didn't expect it, too.\\n\\nAdded bonus: all tables get a plate of pastries to go along with the meal.

From the outside Bru Burger looked like it would fit that bill.  We arrived on a Friday before 3pm to find only a couple of patrons scattered throughout the bar and restaurant.  We sidled up to the bar and the bartender was quick to greet us.  We let her know that this was a quick stop off for a glass of wine and a bite before we had to get going to our destination.  She let me know that their wines are on tap.  I inquired about the Sauvignon Blanc and she was quick to tell me that is probably the least popular amongst the customers.  She poured me a sample of it and I can see why it is not popular.  Here is your PSA, do not order the Sauvignon Blanc, there you were warned.  I opted for the Cab on tap.\\n\\nNow for the quick bite our bartender suggested the Bru board which consists of assorted meats, cheeses, pickled onions, and toasted baguettes.  She didn't lie, it was out to us in no time.  And it was good, not phenomenal, but edible and filling.  I would say the selection was spot on, but the cheeses were lacking in flavor.\\n\\nOverall, Bru burger accomplished for us what we stopped in for, a quick drink and bite with friendly service."},{"name":"Volante Farms","address":"292 Forest St","city":"Needham","stars":"3.5","text":"Grocery store items are double or triple what they should be.

The menu turns into what appears to be an elegant French restaurant with all sorts of dishes of french cuisine. Too bad it is basically a quick service meal tuned into a table side meal. The seafood medley pasta was some over cooked noodles thrown together with bad sauces and the steak my wife ordered rare was almost raw. The lobster bisque was okay but the only saving part of this meal was the french bread rolls. Dessert here is disgusting and the gray stuff is awful.

We returned them. They tasted like they were cooked way ahead of time and they came out seconds after we ordered. The bill came and they said they couldn't take the rolls off the menu because we ate one. How were we suppose to try them without eating one!!???????!!!! I hope they enjoy saving that 4.95 cause they lost returning customers and my family who eats there often.... I will also tell others that frequent the restaurant about this situation and I'm sure they will not return.

The decor is out of date and, I agree with the other review that said it looked as if they set up temporary shop. When I walked in, there was no one inside customer wise- just me, however, there were four employees (one man and one woman at the counter and two ladies behind that were making food/cleaning). As soon as I opened the front door and walked inside the restaurant, I immediately could hear this man in deep conversation with the woman describing a situation he's involved in with a random person. He was in the midst of saying this random person is a bitch when he turned around and saw me approaching the counter. He asked if I was ready and I said 'not yet'. He turned around and continued telling this story only a filtering it slightly better. I finally interrupted him and said that I was ready to order. He then turned around and started fussing on his cell phone for what felt like a good minute with a smug look on his face as if he was telling me 'You wait on me!\\"...Well, I ordered and paid.

About half way through quickly eating my sandwich, the staff started vacuuming and putting away chairs as if they were about to close even though their sign listed they were open for another twenty five minutes.

My 6yo son absolutely loved it. At one point he exclaimed, \\"These guys are really funny!\\" Even my husband and I found ourselves rolling our eyes at the corniness of it but smiling and laughing too. Good 'ol Disney.\\n\\nAfter the ridiculous song about Straw-Berry Short-Cake they plunk down a big circular cake covered in strawberry sauce and whipped cream. I no sooner had dished out cake for the table and was about to take that first bite when I was plucked from the audience for a roll in the show. I won't give anything away but be ready in case you are asked to \\"help out\\", lol. I thought it was really cool that after my part I was presented with a certificate and printed photos of my \\"performance\\". The whole show was a real hoot and something I definitely think we'll be back for again. I'm hoping maybe its my husband who gets chosen next time. ;)\\n\\nOne more thing- you cannot drive a car to the Hoop Dee Doo.

We typically get the meatball platter (made fresh in house - great texture!) Crispy tofu skin, plus an order of meat and veggie sides. Their classic Half and Half broth is a must, but if you prefer something more sour, the salted veggie broth is worth trying as well. The house made Potato Noodle was also chewy and delicious. We also tried the dumplings, which unfortunately was lackluster despite the generous portion. The skewers were great though, although I'd say it's not the best within the area. If you come in smaller groups, I'd recommend sticking to the hotpot as it's absolutely at the top of pack among hot pot places in Boston and around.\\n\\nWhat a perfect addition to the chilly city of Boston - we are definitely coming back (again) soon!"},{"name":"Handi Cuisine of India","address":"1579 Bellevue Avenue","city":"West Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Maybe a bit closer to four and a half stars really, Handi has been in the West Van area for a bit shy of a decade now.

Although much smaller, the new space is still inviting with a warm decor and friendly staff. The service is generally pretty good, but the food is much better. Serving northern style cuisine, you'll find butter chicken, samosas, naan, chicken tikka masala, and lots of other favourites on their menu. In that old school Indian tradition, each dish is served in a heated pan. In a comfortable, open dining room with tables and booths, Handi lays your food out on a glass covered tablecloth. I'm not calling Handi elegant, but it could easily work for a date night. \\n\\nBest part, the food. The naan comes out warm and soft, and it all gets better from there. Handi's menu is complete, with lots of variations all the meat and vegetarian options, plenty of appetizers and best of all...Kingfisher Beer (unfortunately they don't have the big bottle). A quick word on Kingfisher beer, it's the beer you drank many times if you've ever visited India, I don't like beer, but Kingfisher I really like, a lot.

It's not ideal for eat-in because it's so small, but if you're with kids and they're hungry it's nice to have the option instead of waiting until you get home.  (No delivery, although they do catering.)\\n\\nThey seem to have paid attention to complaints about their hours, because I believe they now open on Sundays when there's a football game.  \\n\\nThe parking is difficult--a bus stop right in front is especially inconvenient (unless you're ON the 134 bus, in which case it's perfect).  Try parking a block up on the other side of the street at the large lot in front of the drugstore/auto parts/liquor stores.  \\n\\nCash only."},{"name":"Bangkok Bites","address":"7950 SE Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Bangkok Bites is the newest addition to the Montavilla Thrilla (yeah, it's sizzlin' hot) strip on SE Stark between 76th and 82nd. Housed in the former Romo's Latin Quarter, this tiny little Thai place offers up a standard selection of curries, noodles and stir fry dishes, alongside a specials menu that reads... well... it sounds tasty. \\n\\nHilary and I stopped in for some grub on a sunny Sunday evening around 6pm, and the place was only sparsely filled. The interior is very similar to the style when it was Romo's, with a few added features (and some pretty bad art on the walls). The servers are all smiles and enthusiastic that you're there. The menu's are done in a sort of crafty style, printed on bright paper and held together with plastic school report spines. There are already lots of handwritten changes on the menu, but that just adds to the character. \\n\\nWe sampled the tofu salad rolls with peanut sauce, an order of mieng kam, an order of Som Tum papaya salad, and some pad phet (red chili-paste stir fry). The salad rolls were just ok (iceberg lettuce filler? really?!) but the peanut sauce that accompanied them was quite good. The mieng kam was tasty, and came with spinach leaves instead of the traditional and hard-to-get betel leaves, but there was enough peanuts, shrimp, chilis, ginger, onions, limes and coconut to make a decent number of wraps. That said, not the best mieng kam selection I've had. The Som Tam was too weak for my palate (it was ordered without the little dried shrimp, so that may have contributed) but Hilary liked it just fine (she's not a fan of those lil shrimps). My pad phet was... lacking in flavor, and pretty small for the $9.25 price tag. Definitely not close to the local par, which has been set by Bai Yok around the corner. We also ordered some brown rice on the side, and it's REAL brown rice, so I gotta give them points for that. Not sure how much more it cost, but I was so glad to not be stuck with the standard white rice option. \\n\\nOverall, our $32 meal (no drinks - pre tip) was kind of pricey and not really all that fulfilling. I did leave with a full stomach (since I ate an entire order of salad rolls alongside a full order of stir fry and rice) but I was not really super satisfied with the flavorings in the food. It lacked a certain amount of depth - something that I strive for in good Thai. With ever so many options, even in the near area, I'm not sure I'll be rushing back any time soon. \\n\\nI'm glad someone has taken over the former Romo's space, and I hope this doesn't turn in to one of those eternally cursed restaurant venues, but based on what I ate today, I'm not really bowled over. \\n\\nI will definitely try some noodles some time, but until then, the smiley service and convenient location merit a 3 stars from me."},{"name":"Bobby's Burger Palace","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy, Gate 26 Concourse B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Just a must try..

It's not really authentic Afghan food anymore- does not taste like real afghan food. I am Afghan and have eaten at many many Afghan restaurants as well as my moms cooking, aunts cooking etc. I don't know if owners changed or maybe head chef etc..but today it seemed all the staff there were Indian..even in the kitchen. I also noticed their chicken kebab was more like Indian chicken tikka/masala chicken. The Bolani is made from some strange puff pastry sort of pastry..and the filling was rather odd..it had dill in it? Lol. The Mantu dumplings tasted kinda stale and had no real flavour and were falling apart. Traditional Mantu has a lot of black pepper and onions in it. This was mostly ground beef that had no real flavour. The kidney bean side that came with one of our orders was...bland at best. Afghan food traditionally is very very flavourful and spicy. The bread was so so good though- The best part of the meal! Lastly, the service was not great. We ordered our chai first and got it after we had finished our meal...even though we asked for it 2 times to see if it's coming? Overall...bland and boring and not authentic in its flavouring and style. If you want real Afghan food...it's hard to find in BC, but Afghan Kitchen in white rock area is pretty good.

Everything was ready within 5 minutes of placing the order online, to picking it up, which is great for the lunch rush! The staff was very friendly and greeted me as soon as I walked in. I always like to try the tofu if it's available. As is traditional for poke, the rice was warm and the tofu cold. I think with any tofu, but especially cold tofu, it has to be marinated well. This tofu fell a little short in the flavor department and could have been improved with sauce. Unfortunately my sauce was so sparse I wasn't sure it was even mixed in. Ask for extra! The rest of the ingredients were nice and fresh, but not evenly distributed. I think I got 3 cilantro leaves altogether, and a very tiny scoop of carrots, vs the abundance of cucumber chunks and edamame. I didn't enjoy the big chunks of cucumber and think it would vastly improve the dish if they were sliced thinner or into match sticks.

It is just a carryout window along the street, so luckily the rain held off till after I ordered (and I don't mind eating in my car.)  You can see into the kitchen, and tell that these folks know what they're doing by the setup and the smell.  Oh, the smell: you should be able to find a BBQ place by that alone, and I could have here.  It was awesome\\n\\nThey open at 11am and were almost out by 1pm, so get here early.  There's a limited menu, and when it's gone, it's gone.  For $10 I got a burnt ends platter, with mac and cheese and baked beans, plus a sweet tea and some bread pudding (the desserts and drinks are extra, but I still spent just $15.)  \\n\\nThe meat was fantastic.  Crispy on the edges, tender everywhere else, full of flavor.  They say to try them wet, but I got sauce on the side and didn't need it.  They give you a bun, but I was there for the meat.  The sides were good, too.  Mac and cheese was like homemade; still not as good as Sweetie's mom's, but I'm sure it was someone's mom's recipe.  The baked beans were good, thick and tangy; also a bit different, with green onions and celery, etc., chopped up in them.  The tea was not particularly sweet.  The bread pudding.was good, simple and comforting, sweet enough without the vanilla sauce on the side.\\n\\nSo, 5 stars for the meat- and it's all about the meat.  4-5 stars for everything else.  Downsides? I wish they had a combo platter so I could have tried more of the meats.  The tea needs to be sweeter.  And the plasticware is flimsy.  But seriously, those are minor gripes, compared to the moan-inducing burnt ends."},{"name":"The Peached Tortilla","address":"3600 Presidential Blvd, East Food Court","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place got the best reviews of all the airport spots so I grabbed a couple tacos before flying out.

Typical airport food pricing."},{"name":"Tasty Lucky Noodle House","address":"4727 Kingsway","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm not sure why, but I've noticed that many of the Szechuan restaurants around town have very generic names such as \\"Szechuan Restaurant\\", \\"Szechuan Cuisine\\", \\"Szechuan House\\", \\"New Szechuan Restaurant\\", and one of the newest... Szechuan Tasty Restaurant which opened up last year on Kingsway, across from Metrotown and in the former Tai Won location. The reason why I bring this up is because it can get very confusing when you're looking for a restaurant and they all sound the same.\\n\\nOn my first visit to this shop on a rainy November, I had a hankering for some of their handmade noodles but then I also saw they had Steamed Xiao Long Bao ($6.98) so I grabbed an order of that too. The dumplings weren't too bad and the skin was relatively thin except for the thick twirl on top. I did notice that the skin was a bit sticky and that some of the dumplings had more soup than the others. Overall, not too bad but they didn't have any dipping sauce to go with it.\\n\\nFor my noodle order, I picked the Lan-Zhou Style Beef Noodles ($9.98) named after the largest city in the Gansu Province of Northwest China. You can choose between beef brisket and beef flank as well as whether you want cutting or dragging noodles - I opted for the brisket and cutting noodles. There was a plentiful amount of thinish broad noodles that proved to be very slippery (I mention this because this can cause a lot of splashing as noodles fall back into the bowl resulting in broth all over your shirt). The brisket had a lot of fat attached it which might be a turnoff for some.\\n\\nOn my next visit here, I ordered the Dan Dan Noodles ($9.98) with peanut sauce. Based on my last visit, I shouldn't have been surprised at how much noodles were in this bowl. The dragging style noodles had a nice chewy texture that sticks to your gut. Definitely a good place to go to if you're looking to carb up.\\n\\nI saw that they had skewers here so I made a point to revisit and ordered their Grilled Lamb Skewers ($3 each). A bit on the pricey side if you ask me... but the aroma of spicy chili peppers soon arrived at my table. Despite this, I didn't really feel the spicy heat until the last piece so it definitely creeps up on you. I found the lamb to have a pleasant amount of fatty bits but the spices that coated the skewers fell off easily which made quite a mess (both to the table and to my teeth).\\n\\nSince I liked the lamb skewers, I wound up revisiting to try their Cumin Flavoured Lamb Fried Noodles ($12.98). This dish had a good amount of wok hei caramelization and toothsome noodles combined with tender but slightly fatty pieces of lamb. Like the lamb skewers that I had previously, I wound up with a fair amount of cumin stuck between my teeth afterwards.\\n\\nSo I'm not sure if this place is still open...

Very rarely do I give reviews like this, but holy crap did this place deserve it. \\n\\nMy husband and I came up for a visit from San Diego. I was raised in Oregon, but in the Ashland area. Many of my friends from Southern Oregon have moved up to Portland so I came to visit them and to show my husband the city because I've been itching to move back home. Before we even arrived at Romtoms, my friend casually mentioned to me that the service industry in Portland is notorious for being horrible to customers. I thought that was random, but whatever. Moving on.\\n\\nShe brought us to Romtoms for her co-worker's going away party. She referred to it as a \\"hipster bar\\" so I was like cool, let's get a piece of that. I guess I'm used to more of a hipster dive bar vibe because walking into this place made me want to vomit on myself and most people in there. The music was loud and obnoxious, just like most of the people inside the bar. It was basically the hipster equivalent of a club. I hate clubs. We weaseled our way onto one of the couches and ordered a couple beers and two dinners from the waiter. I ordered their \\"infamous\\" grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup and my husband got a chicken skewer something. Who knows. I was starving and annoyed at the noise level in there, like a proper old person. \\n\\nTwenty minutes later a waitress brought out our meals. I saw her coming. I knew they were ours. She wandered to one of the other couches and I could see her asking the two women sitting there if this was their food. There was some confusion and then she set down the grilled cheese sandwich in front of one of them and then wandered over to us. Here's how that conversation went:\\n\\nWaitress: \\"Did one of you order the chicken skewers?\\"\\nMe: \\"Yes, and also a grilled cheese sandwich. I think you just gave my dinner to that girl over there. They only ordered a few minutes ago and we've been here for a while.\\"\\nWaitress: \\"Well you'd better go get it from her then because she claimed it.\\"\\nMe: \\"... Are you serious? It's obviously the other half of our order and you just left it on the wrong table.\\"\\nWaitress: \\"I don't know what to tell you.\\" *walks away*\\nMe: *jaw on the ground*\\n\\nARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I was livid. Not only was I starving, but the attitude on this waitress was beyond belief. She obviously messed up and, like an idiot, just split up and passed around a food order between different tables. And now I need to go correct her error myself? Well screw her; I did go over and tell those girls that the waitress messed up. I took my sandwich and ate it angrily. 15 minutes later, the two dinners the girls ordered were brought to them. As soon as we finished eating, my husband and I told my friend we couldn't stand another minute at that place and we walked down the street to enjoy the rest of our evening at Burnside Brewing, where the waitstaff was friendly and competent and there weren't a bunch of drunk 30-somethings hitting on each other. \\n\\nI will say, however, that our WAITER was great. He actually spotted us in line to close our tab at the bar and came over to us offering to close it out to save us the wait. I asked him to please make sure that only he got the tip we were leaving because the other waitress was awful. AWFUL. This was way back on April 4th and I'm still fuming about that waitress.

I've liked the restaurant name here for awhile simply because it rhymes which delights me.  I thought they might be delighted if I visited finally and cheered them on.\\n\\nCheering them on is easy as you walk in the door.  It feels like you're on vacation immediately.  The walls are painted bright yellow, there are a few matching Mexican accessories on the walls, and some colorful tablecloths.  The restaurant itself is so clean that it shines.\\n\\nI was greeted at the counter by the friendly counter person.  My questions were answered clearly and order taken quickly.  Menus were above the counter and in handheld format with clear pricing and photos.  My chicken burrito that I ordered wet came out full of tender chunks of chicken and also generous sides of rice and creamy pinto beans.  I was able to \\"doctor\\" it up at the salsa bar with a nice variety of condiments.  All the additions were kept ice cold.  I appreciated the detail to attention here.  The price was quite reasonable at $9 for this platter of good food, a lot of which came home in the form of leftovers.\\n\\nI'm not usually a fan of so much media being on at the same time, but they managed to maintain a balance between the music and television being on at the same time and eventually turned them both off.  I'm not sure I'll ever get used to dogs being in restaurants (one well-behaved boxer came in with his person to pick up takeout), but it's a sign of the times more and more here in Portland.\\n\\nAnyway, that's my take on Tito's Burritos.  I'm happy that it met my name-rhyming expectations AND eating expectations, and I think you will enjoy it too.  But most of all, I hope you enjoy the name as much as I do."},{"name":"Pho Paris","address":"136 Newbury St","city":"Peabody","stars":"4","text":"I highly recommend you check out this place. Everything was solid. We went in and while the decor was very sparse, the smell was amazing. We ordered some Cha Gio, crispy spring rolls. We also ordered Chicken Pho (Pho Ga), and Chicken over rice (Com Ga Nuong), and finally the Shrimp Paste over Sugar Cane with Rice noodles (Chao Tom). We also order some boba tea to drink while we waited for our food. I love taro root, so I enjoyed the crispy spring rolls immensely. They weren't super greasy and the fish sauce was very tangy and delicious. The Pho Ga was delicious, and the temperature was hot just the way I like. The chicken over broken rice had some pluses and minuses. The plus was they used an ample amount of chicken and it wasn't the flimsy thin slices that are often given on that dish, however the chicken was a bit fatty and was a lot of dark meat. Finally the Shrimp paste was cooked to perfection. My only complaint is that they only give you two pieces, which is skimpy. Usually you are given four or more pieces at the places I frequent in my hometown. Also they gave mint instead of basil, which is just a preference rather than a problem. Overall it was a delightful meal with a friendly waitstaff. I would definitely visit again if I were in the area."},{"name":"Spice Modern Steakhouse","address":"407 E Central Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Came here tonight with my in laws and had a nice enough time.

The main colors of the place are blue and white so it is everywhere. There isn't a whole lot of decor but what they have is Austin and farmer focused.  They have a decent size patio out in front with lots of shade.  But nothing unusual or interesting just your typical burger joint. \\n\\nMenu - The menu is a lot like if Dairy Queen and Freddys Steakburgers had an illegitimate child.  They have the regular burgers, chicken tenders, corndogs and some other dinner plates like fried fish and roast. And there dessert focus is on custard, which is way better than normal ice cream. Custard has more egg yolk and cream so it is richer and tastier.  So the burgers are a thin patty that are smashed down to have a dome and crispy edges. There are a few other places like Freddys that do it this way.  They call their burgers ButterBurgers, but i don't really know why. So on the food side they have a pretty varied amount of burgers and other items.  The custard menu is pretty large too as you can make your own or get some predetermined choices. \\n\\nFood - So I got the double (all doubles really, since they are small patties) bacon ButterBurger with all the fixings and dragged thru the garden, fries and drink.  They have some of my favorite fries, krinkle fries, but i didn't get very many.  They were super good thou, hot and fresh and seasoned perfectly.  My burger however was kind of disappointing thou.  So the burger was stacked nice and high, with the meat on top and the veggies on the bottom. There was one melted piece of cheese and then a cold unmelted one on the bottom since I guess they forgot a slice on my patty.  So that was lame. For the overall ratio of ingredients it was a pretty good burger, but there was no ketchup or mayo as described, so it was kinda dry. Plus the cold limpy cheese slice didn't help. The meat was pretty good but one of the patties was either really old or just straight burned.  So only half of my burger was actually made / cooked correctly.  It was kind of like they took all the spare parts of items and threw them together to make my burger.  So overall it was ok, I'm sure this would be a different review if it was made correctly.  But it was ok.\\n\\nService - when I walked in I was greeted by a gentleman who was friendly and promptly took my order.  The rest of the employees seemed pretty happy and pretty friendly as well.  But aside from my order taking there wasn't much interaction. So the service was good, standard for a place like this. \\n\\nOVERALL - So I spent about $9 for everything.  And unfortunately I didn't feel I got my value for 2 main reasons.  The first was that the regular fries that came with it was pretty lacking.  The main reason is I felt like my burger was kind of half@$$ed.  Cheese wasn't melted, no sauce condiments as stated, and one of the patties was really dry.  However info know this could be situational, maybe a new cook, or something. I prefer to think that over laziness. \\n\\n**However, during my visit around 3pm, this place was really busy.  Most places aren't this busy around this time.  Plus there was a lot of elderly guests and they can be picky about where the eat.  So they are doing something right, but my visit not so much."},{"name":"Im Thai Cuisine","address":"1671 Main St, Ste C","city":"Buda","stars":"4.5","text":"I found this place driving to the Austin airport it's definitely a hidden gem.

It was really cool. \\n\\nIn past reviews I neglected to mention that they have board games here to borrow, too. My kid taught me how to play Cards against Humanity (she had to explain what some words meant, too. How embarrassing!). \\n\\nWe met Ryan, who I think was one of the managers here. He is so gracious and friendly. And our server, MJ (Mary Jane) was delightful. \\n\\nI am so pleased that this lounge is back on my list of places to go, as it's really a beautiful, classy lounge."},{"name":"Hokkaido Chinese & Japanese Buffet","address":"5737 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"My family and I were on our summer vacation, we stopped by this place it was really good.

We've gone to Villa Nova many times over the past 15 years or more. We dine out frequently, and may be searching for another Italian restaurant after this recent visit.\\n\\nThe food is standard \\"Ma/Pa Italian Restaurant.\\" It's not a fancy place but does have a lot of interesting things to see in the dining room. Especially the large copper \\"teapot\\" collection. It's very impressive. (My wife noted that it isn't dusted anymore.) The atmosphere can be quiet and relaxing if there isn't a large dinner party or when they're not real busy. It's a good place for a family birthday dinner.\\n\\nA lot of the pasta dishes are made \\"en casserole,\\" the pastas are smothered with sauce and cheese on the top, then baked in crockery that keeps the food hot when it arrives at the table. They're OK. I like their gnocchi. My manicotti shells this time were a little hard and stuck to the bottom of the dish. My wife's spaghetti was a little on the dry side as far as sauce goes, and the meatball recipe may have changed for the worse. We've had their pizza a few times, it's good, better than chain pizzas, and fairly standard in quality for dine-in/carry out restaurants. We stopped ordering House side salads, unless they are a part of the entree. because there's nothing on them but lettuce. That's also standard for Italian places. We split a Chef Salad and appreciate that a modified version was served to us at a reduced price. The soup at VN is never that good. They also have a good burger and decent Reuben sandwich.\\n\\nThe wait staff was attentive and polite as is usually the case at Villa Nova. We wondered though if there was a new owner or management since the last time we were there. The entree prices have increased considerably for a restaurant like this one. The food hasn't increased in quality, nor is there more of it served. Perhaps that's standard now?\\n\\nOne thing we'd never seen before. The employee who was seating people was leading them to their tables but not paying attention to them walking behind her. One woman had a walker and couldn't pass between tables. The employee didn't look back and kept walking. She also had a Tootsie Pop or similar in her mouth as she greeted several guests and seated them.

It's not simply meat that has been grilled, but one that has been either marinated or prepped very simply, yet thoughtfully & masterfully, too.

Located where Wonton Kitchen was, Bread & Co is a French & Korean inspired bakery in Winter Park. There is a small parking lot located right next to it. \\n\\nI went on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't that packed. The sign at the door stated soft opening. Inside provides a modern cafe ambiance. To your left you will see an assortment of baked goods ranging from sweet to savory. To your right, there are some tables and when I went there, there was an employee who was offering some samples. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask the staff! The staff were nice and helpful.\\n\\nThe cakes and cute desserts are located near the cashier in a refrigerated case. You can find a menu of drinks and also some cold drinks across from the cashier. I just recently discovered Hawaiian Sun canned drinks when I went to Vegas and I was ecstatic to find that Bread & Co also carried these drinks! Too bad they didn't have my favorite one: Green Tea with Lychee.\\n\\nAnyways, let's talk about their baked goods. My family and I decided to get a variety of different breads to share and savor. \\n\\nCroquette Bread: My sister chose this one since she is a huge fan of Japanese croquettes and would always get this in the bakeries in Japan. It's a little different from the typical Japanese one. I forgot to take note of what the ingredients were stated but I think it had eggs. The outer panko layer didn't have as much of a crunch as I would have liked it. I think this bread would taste better if it was warmed up. Overall, this wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing.\\n\\nSausage Bread: My mom chose this one since she would always get these at the Asian bakeries. Tastes very similar to the ones you may find in your Chinese/Taiwanese bakeries. It has a nice balance of savory from the sausage and sweetness from the bread. This was good.\\n\\nRed Rice Bread: I chose this one because the dark red color caught my eye and I have never heard of \\"red rice flour.\\" The ingredients stated \\"red rice flour, red bean, sugar, and baking powder.\\" I am a huge fan of red bean bread so I picked this one up. Unfortunately, there are no visible red beans you can see when you bite into it. It seems like there is some kind of cream layered in between the bread. Almost tastes like a cream cheese filling. The red bean flavor is very very veryyy subtle. It just tastes like an average sweet bread. This was the priciest bread out of our assembly and it was probably the most disappointing one. As a dessert bread, it tastes good. However, if you are expecting a red bean flavor filled with red bean filling, then this is not it. \\n\\nBaked Sweet Potato Bread: GET THIS BREAD! Omg this was everyone's favorite in my family. It was so good that we decided to take the last 2 available ones to go. The sweet potato flavor is incorporated in both the bread and the actual sweet potato that is topped AND weaved into the bread. It reminded us of eating Japanese sweet potato during the cold weather. It was delicious! This would probably taste even better if you scoop vanilla ice cream on top of it. I am drooling as I write this. Highly recommend this one!\\n\\nOverall, my family and I had a great time at this cafe. Although it is a bit of a drive for me, I would definitely come back to try out the other baked goods (and stock up on the Baked Sweet Potato Bread :D)."},{"name":"Bobby's Burger Palace","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy, Gate 26 Concourse B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Best service and staff at any Hartsfield restaurant !!

The only negative thing I have to say reflects on a male staff member. He appeared to be a guest until he started helping himself to drinks and in the kitchen it dawned on us. Here's a tip don't be rude to customers, if your waiting for a table outside down the side walk and there is no lines and no line inside don't come in and be be mad if we put our name on the list. It's up to you and the restaurant to manage customer flow. Don't you work here? Isn't that how most places operate with a list? Mind you NO line, no one waiting inside and all we did was walk in before he immediately followed us inside and jumped on us saying he was here first, two separate times. When asked, we understand but we have to put our name on the list. He continued to say he was first. After repeating ourselves several times asking \\"did you put your name on the list?\\" we figured out he had not. We're kind honest folks so we made sure everyone outdoors was already on the list and asked around ourselves NOT him or any staff before we put or name down (why wouldn't you come inside to put your name on the list THEN go outside??). Or if you were first and the restaurant knew, we would start the list and you would be sat next. Ironic they had a clipboard list! Then we realized because he works there he can do whatever he wants. It then he caused commotion between staff and was obvious and uncomfortable.

The noodles are just a bit too greasy, the portion sizes (for dinner, at least) are nothing special. The main problem, however, is the flavor. The sauce is just a bland vaguely salty stir-fry. There's no depth of flavor, and the choice of vegetables (what I guessed to be steamed cabbage and a SINGLE slice of red bell pepper) adds no variety.

The bread came with an African spread - I don't know what it is, but it didn't take long to disappear. Our companions had the Taste of Africa dips to start with, and I tried each of those dips - the curry dip was my favorite and my husband loved the red pepper dip.

What is good pho broth is subjective, some like it thicker, beefier. Some like my aunt like it with MSG, it just enhances the broth. Well at Pho Phong Luu they don't use MSG, the broth is light, fragrant and has sprinkled with some black pepper. This what I like when I eat pho, no hoisin sauce or srichacha, just good clean broth. I haven't been to every pho restaurant in Austin but I think the broth here is definitely up there. Chicken broth is light on the flavor, not for everyone.

Now, about these tables.  They look really cool.  I just don't understand how one sits comfortably at them.  I ended up sort of sidesaddling the barstool in order to feel like I was close enough to the table.  And where do you hang your coat?  Your purse?  I suppose I could have sat on my coat and held my purse in my lap instead of just shoving them between the table and the window.\\n\\nWe started off with an order of the chips and guacamole, and that was pretty much the highlight of the experience.  The guacamole was fresh and chunky, and the chips were still warm.  I was looking forward to trying the ginger beer, but that was no longer available when we asked.  I'm not sure if we were giving off a \\"don't bother us, we're eating guacamole\\" vibe, but it took a while to flag down a waitress to place our food order.  I ordered the corn chowder and one of the short rib tacos.  I wasn't terribly impressed by either; the flavor of the corn chowder was fine (not too spicy), but it was only moderately warm in temperature.  I think I had Kogi expectations of the short rib taco, and though it was fresh and nicely presented, I wouldn't be in a hurry to order it again.\\n\\nI'm sure the place will do well in the Short North, as it's got that hipster trendy drinky drink vibe, but this is not really my scene.  It's quite funny to me that the place has Bakersfield in its name, as I have driven through the town far too many times on my drives from Central to Southern California, and between the sprawling factory fields and the dairy farms you can smell from miles away, it's about the least hipster and trendy sort of town there is.  \\n\\nProbably more of a 2.5 stars for me, but the guacamole is really good.\\n\\nUpdate: A couple of different folks from Bakersfield reached out to me via Yelp to address some of the concerns I mentioned in my review.  They did a great job of communicating in a professional manner, and that counts for a lot in my book!

I honestly thought it was just a way to dislocate someone's forearm from their elbow joint.  For non-MMA/jujitsu followers - it's a wristlock named after, arguably, the greatest Judo practitioner of all time.  So I'm jealous of Chef Kimura - not only is he a fine sushi chef - he shares his surname with a submission move.  Only behind having a racetrack corner, a cinematography shot, a dinosaur, an aerial dogfighting maneuver, or a chess gambit, is the coolest thing to be named after you.\\n\\nAnyways - they accepted my 8PM reservation for a Wednesday night with only 24 hour notice (the site says 48 hours is required for omakase).  They offer omakase at $30, $40 and $50.  They were never clear in delineating the differences each price tier - but $50 for their top-tier omakase is pretty cheap so we just decided to ball out... sorta.\\n\\nThe place is practically in the middle of nowhere and I didn't know it existed even though I commonly pass by the area.  We grabbed a table near the sushi bar - which worked out well as we could watch him working on the next dish and we were within an earshot so he could provide details on each dish.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I didn't have the presence of mind to take notes or pictures (and waitresses weren't always clear from their descriptions) - but from what I remember we got: 3 appetizers (salad with fried anchovies, fish stock soup, oysters), uni, sashimi platter, eggplant lasagna, grilled salmon, a sushi platter and ice cream.\\n\\nYes - you read that right.  Eggplant lasagna in the middle of omakase - completely random but it wasn't bad.  The highlights were the fresh oysters, uni and toro - overall, all the raw items were fresh.  The grilled salmon was really tender and flaky and served with a light sauce.  And the black sesame ice cream at the end was probably one of the better I've had - it was a really rich and smooth finish to meal and didn't have that 'grainy' quality that black sesame gelato usually has.\\n\\nOverall, I really enjoyed the omakase meal we were presented - there were some misses, but overall I was happy - and the price point is pretty good.  The pacing was a bit odd - at the start of the meal, the dishes took a while to come out (standard) but things really ramped up at the end and we started getting dishes before we were done with the last one.  However, this is probably due to the fact we they normally close at 9:30PM on weekdays and we were the last ones in there (we weren't out the door until near 10PM).  The dishes did come out quickly at end - but we were otherwise never rushed.\\n\\nService was friendly but definitely lacked a professional polish as the waitresses were forgetful.  Kimura himself frequently checked in on us and made us feel very welcome.\\n\\nThe only downside is they only had one cold sake (Hakutsuru) on offer, one plum wine and one hot sake choice.  And of course, the obligatory Asahi and Sapporo.  Wish there was more choice in sake, but a minor knock on an otherwise good meal.\\n\\nNot my favourite omakase/sushi joint in Vancouver - sorry, Sada-san at Octopus Garden holds that title - but being half the price and being nearby, will definitely check out Kimura again.\\n\\nSeriously, $30 - $50 omakase is fuggin' cheap and it's good enough value to be pretty common thing.  For real treat/celebration, Octopus Garden.  And a reservation at Sukiyabashi Jiro and plane ticket when I finally discover Johnsonosarus or when someone finally wins an MMA title via the Chan scissor kick/arm bar."},{"name":"Erin McKenna's Bakery NYC","address":"1642 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"This is a great place for people with allergies.

It makes me happy to come here every now and then to experience the traditional dim sum.\\n\\nThe restaurant is located in a big plaza, so free parking was never an issue. It's always good to make a reso before coming to the restaurant, even just half an hour in advance. Because like ever other dim sum business, they have two lists, one is for walk-in, and one is for reservations. \\n\\nThe restaurant is basically a big banquet hall. It can easily be sectioned off for different dinner events such as wedding receptions etc. Once everyone sits down, you can wait for the carts to be pushed over to your table. I'm always excited to look what's to offer from each cart. For a lot of people who are not accustomed to dim sum or Chinese food, this is a perfect way for them to see what's in each dish, and they can decide from there. All the food are made fresh with good quality, and sometime if you only want something specific, you can ask the waitress to write it down as an order. There's not a lot of wait time as people are always pushing the carts around to offer. \\n\\nThe price is also relatively cheaper in comparison to some of the fancy menu order dim sum places. If you go with a group of four, you can expect to pay between $25-$30 including tips, and it also depends on how much you order. \\n\\nOverall, I am a big fan of a-la-cart style dim sum. It's fast, visual, fun to eat with a group of people. If you are not picky about the service, or the restaurant manners i.e. loudness and politeness, you will enjoy this place."},{"name":"Louie's Pizza","address":"118 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"4.5","text":"Wish I could have given it 4.5 stars.

We went there for my son's birthday dinner, and while the first part of the visit was fine, dinner was a different story.  \\n\\nThe first complaint is that, at all our previous visits, they provided free, bottomless hush puppies.  No more, apparently, as we had to order them separately and pay for each side.  While I'm not a fan of complaining about the lack of freebies, eliminating one that has been around for years indicates to me that the chain is going downhill.\\n\\nAs for the meal itself - one of our party ordered a medium rare steak, but received one that was well-done. The server said she must have picked up the wrong one at the window.  All right, that can happen. However, my son ordered a crab bucket with Cajun spice, and received it steamed. The server acted incredulous at this, as if he hadn't asked for it originally but instead had changed his mind.\\n\\nNow for the food itself.  Most of it was delicious, except for a couple very glaring issues.  The pizza my youngest daughter ordered from the kids' menu was hideous; it tasted like a frozen pizza. It takes a lot for my daughter to reject pizza.  On top of that, my wife and mother-in-law both had rice pilaf as their sides, and the rice was not fully cooked. While they did replace it with hush puppies, this was just the final thing that made our dining experience far less than enjoyable.\\n\\nNext time we have a craving for seafood, I plan to cook it myself.

Here's why...\\n\\n1. The food is consistently excellent.  I've never had a bad meal there, and though there are a number of restaurants that are higher up the totem pole in terms of quality (e.g. Wink, Jeffrey's, etc), there are none that are as high up in the other criteria that I measure a restaurant by (see below).  In fact, I love the food here so much that I usually will order 2 appetizers along with my entree because I can never choose between their wonderful pork and salmon rillettes, or their soups.\\n\\n2. The atmosphere is wonderful. Whether it be the shabby chic decor, plastic tablecloths, and background music that remind me of excellent meals I've had at cafes in the French countryside, or the way that the owners and staff welcome and make us feel at home each time we visit, there are few restaurants that compare.\\n\\n3. The service is excellent. The staff are not only friendly, but attentive... but not overly so. Chez Nous doesn't do the conventional one staff member to an area of tables, rather everyone seems to help on every table. It's a wonderful arrangement, and also allows us to catch up with everyone since our last visit. I have seen very little turnover in their staff over the past 10 years, which is because they are like one big, happy family.\\n\\nA couple of other points, worth bearing in mind.\\n\\nParking in the area is extremely limited (they have none themselves), and I don't think they do valet parking any more. We usually park on the street nearby (if we're lucky) or at a lot on Neches, just north of 6th Street.\\n\\nFriday and Saturday nights can get busy at peak times, and they do not take reservations. However, when it does get really busy, they'll take your cell phone number, you can go and have a drink on 6th Street, and they'll call you when your table is ready. After about 8.30 p.m you'll get a table pretty quickly though, if not straight away.\\n\\nAttire is relatively casual. You will see some dressed formally, and some dressed (what I consider) a little too informally. I usually dress in something like jeans and a nice top to find a happy medium.\\n\\nI highly recommend the Menu du Jour, for first-timers. It is an excellent introduction to their menu. These days, It think it's about $25 per person for a starter, entree, and dessert... which is excellent value for money."},{"name":"Drelyse African Restaurant","address":"1911 Tamarack Cir","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"A few months ago I declared 2017 my year to explore ethnic foods and African food has been a cuisine I've never tried so it felt more than right to check out this Yelp favorite. \\n\\nThe restaurant is located in a small plaza with a hair shop and convenience store. The inside is nice and clean and real linen napkins are set at each table. The colors seem to give homage to their culture. \\n\\nThe restaurant was empty when we arrived and it had to holler out to the kitchen a few times before someone came to the front. We were taken to a nearby table, given menus and told that someone would be back to take our order in a few minutes.

It's ridiculous, but worth the one time experience."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I will most likely be in the minority here, but I have had the opportunity to eat both lunch and dinner at Be Our Guest. Overall I was completely unimpressed.  I certainly can understand why this is a coveted reservation.  It's new, it looks really cool, and let's face the facts that Beauty and the Beast is a beloved classic from the Disney Renaissance period.\\n\\nLunch is Quick Service and will cost you 1 Quick Service Credit, or Dining Credit if on the DDP.  The menu is an array of sandwiches and cupcakes for desserts.  You will order before you are seated, and your food will be brought over to you. It is seat yourself. \\n\\nDinner is 1 regular Sit Down Dining Credit.  You are seated and order from a menu that serves traditional hearty meals like steak, pork, and chicken.  This is the only place in MK that you can order Alcohol (so drink up!).  \\n\\nThe Magical (Pros):\\n\\nOk so the ambiance is cool... Kind of. The outside looks awesome.  It's ominous to look up at the Beast's castle looming in the distance, and then once inside it looks like a full fledge castle straight from the movie.  During lunch you go down a hallway with Knights that will talk (kind of a neat effect).  You will quickly glance at a menu and then order your food in The Beast's Study.  At dinner this is where your family will get a picture with The Beast after your meal.  Just the Beast... no Belle, No Cogsworth, No Lumiere. The Beast can scare little ones, and it's not uncommon to hear kids screaming through most of dinner.\\n\\nThe Lines moves very fast at lunch.  If you really want to eat here, and I mean you really just want to do it, then just wait in the line.  It moves super fast.  Often times it says an hour wait, but it seldom will take you that long.  Also, go later or earlier in the day.  The more flexible you are with your time the easier it is to get into the restaurant.  If you are hell bent on eating in the West Wing GOOD LUCK!  It is super popular.  You can eat in 3 room... the West Wing with the wilting Rose, The Ball Room where it looks as if it is snowing Outside, and the Library (Which honestly, looks nothing like Library and  is just a bunch of tables and chairs with a Dancing Belle & Beast Statue in the middle). At dinner you also don't get a choice where you sit, but they close off the Library... which is odd considering the demand for this restaurant. \\n\\nThe Grey Stuff really is delicious.  It's basically a Cookies & Cream whipped cream frosting that they put on a Chocolate Cupcake.  It tastes really good.  It is far from the best dessert in the World of Disney, but at least it's not false advertising... imagine the horror if the Grey stuff wasn't delicious?!?!\\n\\nYou can drink.  Disney bent the rules on the No Alcohol in Magic Kingdom and allowed Alcohol to be served during Dinner at Be Our Guest.  Perhaps because the Castle is Enchanted it doesn't follow the rules of the rest of the Kingdom? :) This for me was nice.  They serve various beers and wines.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that they served Chimay here, which is a great beer, and I haven't seen many other places in Disney offer this. \\n\\nThe Wicked (Cons):\\n\\nThe Beast.  Ok, I get it... it's his Castle, but what person lists the Beast as their favorite character from that movie?  My bet is 1 in 1000.  Nowhere do we get to enjoy Cogsworth, Lumiere, Mrs. Potts, Chip, or Belle.  There are so many ways they could have easily implemented them into the Dining Room through Animatronics.  It seems odd to me what we get instead is a 7 foot tall Beast instead.  Every 10 minutes during dinner there is a sort of ridiculous segment where the Beast Welcomes You to the Castle, Runs through the Dining Room, and then you go back to eating.  WHO thought this up?  Come on Disney... I can forgive you for putting Belle at the Norway Restaurant, but this silly nonsense?  Yikes!\\n\\nThe Food.  Honestly, the food just isn't good.  Lunch is sandwiches. Some people say the Roast Beef is good, but I say go to Earl of Sandwich downtown instead. Your basically sacrificing a Meal credit to go inside the castle and eat a half decent cupcake.  (Oh yeah, no Characters at lunch at all... no one is home!)  Dinner isn't much better.  The alcohol aside the food was just alright.  We tried almost everything on the menu in our party.  Nothing was great.  Cinderella's Castle is far superior (yes, I know that it is 2 Points... but it's worth it!)\\n\\nThe Service.  Ok so the \\"cool factor\\" is that when you order they can \\"find you\\" with your magic bands and bring your food without you having to tell them where you  are sitting.  The servers look frantic and lost as they run about the dining room with room service carts with food on them.  This is not what I would have expected. \\n\\nIn the End:\\n\\nNo matter what I say you will want to try it for yourself... just know I warned you :) I'll see you back at Cinderella's Castle next time!"},{"name":"Rossetti Restaurant","address":"47 Sutton St","city":"Lynn","stars":"4.5","text":"From start to finish, food and service were exceptional.

Overall the food quality is good, although it can be hit or miss. For instance, recently I ordered the grilled chicken with rice and veggies, which I've ordered before. It comes with 2 large pieces of chicken (leg connected to thigh, bone in). We arrived just after 11 to beat the lunch rush and the place was only half full, so we didn't have to wait for a table. We waited over half an hour for our food, and when it arrived, the chicken, advertised as grilled, was obviously fried and barely warm. The same dish has been quite good on other visits. Also, their chicken wings, especially the fish sauce wings, are delicious. The spring rolls are pretty good, but pricier than most. Most of the dishes are meant to share and come with a mountain of greens.\\n\\nThe food is pretty good, so why only 3 stars? I feel that while this place is pretty solid, it's not great value for the money. You will pay more money for spring rolls because they're cut on an angle and served in a wicker basket.

My group had the mussels (so excellent and my first time trying them, I'm sure I'm ruined now to mussels forever because these were so excellent and buttery), skirt steak (that was so tender you could cut it with a butter knife), catch of the day (salmon with mushroom risotto) and lamb. It was incredibly difficult to get a reservation here (maybe the only drawback) but I will definitely try to get one in the future when I return."},{"name":"Trudy's North Star","address":"8820 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"We went Tuesday just in time for Happy Hour - what a treat!

It's clunky, confusing, impersonal, no bueno. You have to have a reservation for breakfast, then you check in once, check in again, are given a rose so they can find your table (now this was the cool piece of the meal), pick your meal from a computer, then go find a seat. The whole process was confusing and wasn't explained to us nor were we offered help. We didn't know if we could sit anywhere, we didn't know we had to grab our own drinks, ugh to the whole thing!\\n\\nThis all made my dining partner a bit crabby first thing in the morning which wasn't fun. Breakfast is $26 each, no cheaper options for people like me who can't eat a lot...and we just were not impressed at all. No character interactions to justify the price. And the food wasn't amazing. We tried the breakfast sandwich and Feast A La Gaston. They actually brought us a platter of pastries to start out our meal which we picked at a bit but couldn't find any we loved. The feast a la gaston includes scrambled Eggs, Herb-Roasted Potatoes, Apple Smoked Bacon, and Sausage served with Fresh Fruit and a selection of pastries. The breakfast sandwich was open face with poached Eggs, Applewood Bacon, Brie Cheese, and Arugula on a Croissant served with Fresh Fruit. Everything was fine but just wasn't worth our confusion or the price. \\n\\nThe dining rooms are very cool though decorated with various Beauty and the Beast themes.

I've been to one lunch buffet before in Norcross, and was a bit 'meh' about it, so I wasn't sure what to expect with this dinner. However, I am open to trying new things, and Indian dish descriptions sound really good to me in general, so here goes!\\n\\nStarted with garlic naan, which is a no-brainer for me, because I love garlic, and I've had plain Naan before. Then I added samosas, because meat and seasonings in a pouch is like a smile - understood Universally. And if you thought samosas were girl scout cookies, you're mistaken.\\n\\nTHEN, as far as an entree, I decided on Chicken Tikka Masala because, 1. I love chicken, 2. I love gravy, and 3. I've heard this is a popular dish as far as Indian food goes.\\n\\nOverall? VERY GOOD. The samosas were very good although could have used a bit more savory seasoning. The Chicken Tikka Masala was awesome. Had no idea what to expect and really enjoyed this dish with the rice included. The sauce/gravy was delicious. The meat was interesting - kind of weird texture and pinkish - but still very good. Loved the rice too.\\n\\nI got to try the chicken vindaloo at medium heat and it was not super hot to me - which is important because I am a super wuss when it comes to the food heat.\\n\\nThe delivery guy was lost and had to call me and kinda be handheld but he was super sweet once he arrived, and very apologetic.

I snagged two seats at the bar and ordered a drink for my girlfriend who had yet to arrive. She walked in about 5 minutes later and asked to take a look at the food menu. First major issue. The bartender hadn't informed me upon sitting that they were in the process of changing their menu and they had a fraction of the items we had read about online. To be clear when i say the word fraction im talking about 1/4th, and thats being generous, of the items we had originally read about. We were both bummed out but hungry enough to settle and order from the very small amount of options we were given.\\n\\nSecond major issue. After being given the menu she never came back our way to ask if we had decided on anything. On top of that both of our drinks were empty but i guess its difficult to notice that when you're busier socializing with coworkers instead of doing your job. Finally we managed to flag her down and order some food which was sub par, again generous, at best. \\n\\nThird issue. This bar was dead. Aside from us there were maybe 10 other patrons who were loud and obnoxious. Once again to be clear, said patrons were about our age, between 23-29. We like to go out and have fun, watch hockey games and have 3-4 drinks and still we couldnt believe how rude and annoying these customers were. \\n\\nTo sum the entire experience up i can honestly say i will never step foot in this joke of a bar ever again. They have the right idea with the atmosphere but other than that the place is trash. The staff, the crowd, the work ethic - or i guess in this case lack thereof- was terrible.

My friend and I came here one Monday night and we were sat right away. Both he and I have been looking forward to trying this place for quite some time. We were sat right away which was nice.\\n\\nThe atmosphere at this restaurant is very beautiful. It has a modern Japanese vibe with lots of wood. The service was pretty good. We wanted to keep a menu cause we wanted to order more but the serve was pretty insistent that she take it away and that we ask for it when we want to order. That was a bit awkward.\\n\\nWe ordered quite a few things. We got the scallop hokkaido which was honestly my favorite dish that we ordered. I thought it was going to be a bit larger based on images, but it was simply served in the scallop shell. Regardless of size, I recommend everyone recommend it if they love scallops and savory things.\\n\\nWe also got some yakitori, 2 pork belly and one chicken meatball served with a quail egg. For sides we got one small white rice and one bowl of miso soup. My second favorite dish was the grilled squid which was way bigger than I expected. It was also very decently priced, around $8. It was a great amount and was served with some type of aioli/spicy mayo that was very good. We also got 2 orders of the salmon roe (ikura) sushi as well as 2 orders of the tamago (sweet egg) sushi. Both were very fresh and very good!\\n\\nThe last thing we got was the anticipated uni soba noodles. This was the main dish both of us were looking forward to try the most. However, this dish was the most disappointing. We were glad that we shared it. This was my first time trying uni (sea urchin) and it was pretty good.

I also got the salt and pepper chicken for $5.5. Unfortunately, the food was nothing special and the servings were very small. I feel like a great travesty of recently trendy asian food is the bao.

My boyfriend and I ended up spending nearly $30 including tax and tip and leaving hungry. The food itself was also not exceptional. It was good, but definitely did not justify the prices or the servings sizes. \\n\\nAdded onto this they have limited dedicated parking so you'll probably have to fight with rabid trader joes shoppers that ah ma's shares their plaza with.

The brisket seemed baked, with liquid smoke and you guessed it, no flavor. I also had hair in my brisket. No hairnets? I asked for a brisket sandwich and received pieces of brisket with two slices of buttered bread. A brisket sandwich usually comes between two slices of bread or a bun with shredded or sliced beef for the record. This was clumps of beef with bread on the side.

One of my daughters has a food allergy, so we got some special instructions which  made it easier.  \\n\\nAfter ordering, you choose your room.  My first choice would be the ballroom, if you can get a seat by the window.  However, those spots were taken so we ended up in the West Wing which we found really cool.

I enjoyed the broth and noodles, but did not find anything overly distinguishable per say.     The beef itself, was not only very tender, but also more flavorful then the three places I had this while staying in Taipei.     At $13 a bowl, I'd argue it's a little rich for a bowl of soup.

Fine...I'll wait. \\n\\nWaiting. \\n\\nWaiting. \\n\\nWaiting. \\n\\nFinally...ready to taste some frozen yogurt: \\n\\n\\"Could I have a sample cup please?\\"\\n\\n-Employee steps out from behind the counter.-\\n\\n\\"Sure, I'll come get it for you.

The employee asks if I'd like a punch card. \\n\\n\\"No thanks, we won't be needing one.\\"\\n\\nI actually felt badly for the employee, who seemed to be tasked to serve everyone samples and ring people up and restock the topping and clean things, all while dealing with explaining the sampling policy to people like us. \\n\\nSo, we leave and I taste the frozen yogurt, knowing that this would have to be the best frozen yogurt I've ever had to even consider coming back and supporting these business practices. It's not. In fact, it's not even that great. The fruit was mostly fresh, but conventional. The yogurt was too creamy and too sweet, not the tartness I was looking for. \\n\\nNectar's frozen yogurt is SO much better. They let you try as much as you like there, which always makes me purchase multiple flavors and I end up spending much more than I spent on my measly amount I purchased from Peachwave during this trip. \\n\\nI understand there are concerns to letting customers dispense their own samples, but somehow it seems that most successful frozen yogurt places in the Portland area have overcome those concerns and allow customers to try what they like. \\n\\nBottom line: It's their business and they can choose to run it how they'd like, but I can also chose to not give them mine."},{"name":"iTofu","address":"4940 No.3 Road, Unit 125","city":"Richmond","stars":"4","text":"this place has the best durian tofu pudding ever!

Your meat items include beef brisket, pulled pork, Ohio chicken meatballs, smoked Turkey, or fried artichokes. I chose mac and cheese with beef brisket. It was a super hearty meal and a generous portion. My only complaint was that the brisket could've used a bit more flavor/juiciness, or maybe it just needed a bit more bbq sauce. They have a couple fresh teas and lemonade from a fountain which I tried. I was expecting the tea to be sweet but it wasn't. I added some lemonade and it helped.

Moroccan Lamb Tangine - This was a HUGE chunk of meat with bone in. The meat itself was great, but I did NOT like any of the puree underneath or the pomegranate glaze on top. The consistency and flavor combinations were just all off to me. It's rare for me to not finish my food, but I could not finish this dish. \\n\\nThe service was okay but nothing to write home about, which was the theme overall. Everything here was just sorta EH.

I was highly anticipating the drink because I love jasmine, floral flavors and I love mocha.

And truthfully, after about five sips, I ended up throwing the drink away and getting something from Tealuxe across the street.\\n\\nThe food, however, was absolutely amazing. The PESTO GRILLED CHICKEN MELT was pressed to perfection where every bite had a specific crunchy texture. The ingredients inside were blended together to create a flavor explosion every time you sunk your teeth into the sandwich and I really enjoyed their mushroom pate. The TOMATO BISQUE was also very delectable (I was scared it would taste like V8 - not a fan of tomato soup - but i was wrong). The bisque was flavorful and had a silky texture. It became somewhat addicting to sip. Finally, the SWEET POTATO CHIPS were extremely crunchy and looked like they were made from scratch. Their crunchy texture was also addicting if you wanted to stray away from the soup or sandwich every now and then. \\n\\nOverall, the atmosphere really made my experience more enjoyable. It was well lit, but not too bright, for studying, conversing, or just people-watching. I loved sitting on top at the second floor dining area and looking at all the activity going on downstairs.

My biggest suggestion would be to make it easier for living social vouchers, or at least list all requirements for customers at the time of purchase. By reading reviews, I knew to call ahead for a reservation but even with that, you have to call at least 24 hrs in advance & they don't accept reservations on Sundays which is not the same experience I've had with other groupon/living social deals & just a tad annoying since not even fine dining, five course meal restaurants require a 24hr notice. Had I not done my homework, I may have just shown up to the place & then been turned away, and possibly left a terrible review like some of their others... BUT, that didn't happen & I had a wonderful experience! I too had Anthony as my waiter & he was phenomenal! Fast, friendly, & efficient...he gets 10 stars! As for the food, it was delicious! with the smothered pork chop, mac & cheese, and sweet potato pie as the highlights if my meal. They are all a must try! Everything taste just like homemade, hot & fresh. I was fine with the prices bc the portions are so generous that I was able to make two very satisfying meals from one plate. It would be nice if all dishes were available every day of the week, I wanted to try the meatloaf but that's only prepared on Tuesdays. So based on my first experience, I will be going back to try that... I would've liked the greens to have a little more turkey in them, I didn't get any pieces of meat in my portion unlike typical homemade southern style greens, but I'm pretty picky with those so that was to be expected...my biggest complaint was red velvet cake, it was on the menu but they don't make it very often.

I knew ahead of time that the soups and desserts were the same, and that the ambiance wouldn't really change just because one meal was \\"sit down\\" and the other \\"quick service,\\" right?   Wrong, wrong, wrong.  Dinner was exquisite.  The napkins are folded to resemble red roses, and the absence of the lunch carts and the closed curtains (covering the utensil and drink stations) gave the dinner a more upscale feel.  Add the cameo appearances by the Beast, the flickering candlelight, soothing instrumentals from the film and musical, paired with Guest service that Lumiere would be proud of - and you have the makings for a fantastic dining experience.\\n\\n\\nAs my lunch review really described the ambiance and decor, I will skip right to the food review.  I ordered the salmon with leek fondue which was cooked perfectly and seasoned well, my husband ordered the thyme scented pork - which was moist and flavorful, and my sister-in-law ordered the shrimp and scallops in the puff pastry, which she drooled over.  Even though I sampled all of the desserts previously, we felt that we needed the full experience, and our table shared a Strawberry Cream Cheese cupcake (this continues to be my favorite) and the triple chocolate.  We asked the server for the Grey stuff, and she happily brought it to our table (it was delicious, didn't even need to ask the dishes).\\n\\n\\n\\nI cannot wait to return to Be Our Guest restaurant for dinner, but I'm afraid it might be awhile - reservations are booked solid until at least May.  \\n\\nConsider this my new favorite location to dine at on property for the overall experience."},{"name":"Mi Pizza","address":"11757 S Orange Blossom Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Man, I wish this place was more like the original AL's by the 7 eleven in Kissimmee.

The wait time between dishes, that were ordered all at the same time, was insanely long. Saving grace of this place was the food and our server Chris, but even then there's only so much the food can save. What was even more mind boggling is how the owner was in the restaurant and on the floor but customer connection was definitely not there. He came by our table to ask for the menus back and not once asked how things were or if we needed anything. That was EXTREMELY disappointing. \\n\\nI do not want being busy to be an excuse because the bar was the busiest part of this restaurant and we got our cocktails much quicker than anything else.

The space is beautiful, and I love that you can watch the oyster shuckers. We sat at a small booth along the window, which was nice since there was a breeze and it wasn't too loud. Other parts of the restaurant were pretty loud--there are a lot of hard surfaces. As is often the case in restaurants though, I felt like I was going to hit elbows with the couple seated next to us. \\n\\nOur server was very attentive and nice, though he did seem a little unsure of himself. He walked us through the menu and answered all of our questions. This is a small/large plate restaurant, so sharing is encouraged, which was nice since we wanted to try a lot of things. \\n\\nWe started with cocktails. I loved mine--the \\"Why Not?\\"--made with bourbon, strawberries, lemon, and calabrian chiles. It sort of reminded me of a whiskey sour with a kick. My partner got an absinthe cocktail called the Spruce Lee that he also loved. Made with spruce tip gin, vert absinthe, and green chartreuse, I think the best way to describe the flavor is \\"green.\\"\\n\\nWe started with the steak tartare, which was incredible. The soft boiled egg and roe really made the dish. I was basically licking the plate clean. Next we had the chicken fried oysters, which were presented in their oyster shells with hot sauce underneath. These were really flavorful and crisp, though a little cold by the time we got them. Our server also helpfully pointed out that the dish only came with three oysters, so we added a fourth for a small fee. I always appreciate this kind of info in a sharing-style restaurant--if it's an odd number for two people, just let us know and we will happily add an extra piece so we don't have to fight over it or split something awkwardly.\\n\\nThe best dish of the night was the squid ink gemelli. Seriously one of the best pasta dishes I have ever eaten. It was so smoky and the corn crema was delicious. It was a large serving of pasta and definitely split-able. \\n\\nAt this point we were sated and we weren't too intrigued by the dessert menu, so we ended dinner with some wine and beer.

The wait staff was really sweet and laid back, keeping an eye on us and our waters while we were there. \\n\\nThe indoor bar area was like someone's very spacious mod living room ( I feel like that's a thing in Portland but it's way unique to me having no bars that look like this in New Orleans). The artwork is super eclectic vintage pieces with trippy new age monsters and Mario Karters painted in. Love the one with Ursula, but a lil' out of my price range. \\n\\nWhile it seemed like almost every bar in Portland has a patio, this one is pretty amazing. I like that there is a covered portion with stage, bar and a pingpong table if that suits you, and then it stretches out for a ton of seating so that everyone isn't all up in everyone's biz-ness. It's definitely a posh patio; not like our mis-matchy lawn furniture patios back home. \\n\\nWe really enjoyed the Happy Hour because it was pretty quiet with only a few people coming through. On Sunday night we ended up going back with my sister and her friends, and it was a whole different scene. I feel like in New Orleans on Sundays we watch football, pig out at home and pass out on our couches by 7, where-as there was a serious crowd here on a Sunday night. We got to catch the tail-end of a little booty shaking music, though Portlandians do not, I repeat do not (for the most part) shake their bootys from what I gathered. Oh well. We had a good 5 minute sesh of booty shaking and joined her friends at a big table. It does seem a little like a \\"scene location\\" but again I really enjoyed being on this beautiful patio hanging out during our trip. I ended up going to the inside bar where my tab was open to fetch drinks a few times, and by the end of the night didn't feel like my tab was crazy. I don't know if they have bar waitresses that come to tables at night, but that would've been nice too. \\n\\nAll in all, I will probably go back when I'm in town, and maybe wear a orange leather jacket with a fur neckline, some pastel lipstick, block print dress and big mod sunglasses in the front \\"living room\\" since I didn't really hang in there.

You'll spend $11 for a drink that is not difficult to make, doesn't require exotic ingredients, and is nothing but average.  $11 is outrageous.  \\n\\nThe Asada Fries were generous in quantity and the fries are wonderfully seasoned.

The mixed grill included chicken, fish, and lamb sausage- it was very obvious that everything was cooked fresh. We have had mixed grills that were very dry and bland, not here!  The Chicken Korma and Chicken Tikka Masala were both delicious as well. The chicken was so moist you could cut it with your fork. The flavors were delicious and complex.

Haha! \\n\\nYou must have reservations to dine in this restaurant, which is located in Magic Kingdom behind the castle.  Try to make reservations on the Disney World app or online as soon as the reservations open up to you (180 days in advance).  If you can't find reservations, you can keep checking on the app.  Something is bound to open up as people do tend to cancel.   \\n\\nI ended up getting one breakfast time and two lunch times. \\n\\nBreakfast was awesome because the reservation time was at 8am (before the park opened up to the public).  Lines to get in were non existent and they let you in even though there was no magic morning.  There's a cast member with a clip board that has the reservations on them. You need to by pass them in order to get through to the restaurant.  They got their process down.  I wouldn't expect anything less from Disney.   I would choose breakfast if you don't have a fast pass for the 7 dwarf mine train. This ride is right next to the restaurant and once you are done eating, book it to the line when the park opens at 9am. \\n\\nOnce you get to the castle where Be Our Guest restaurant is located, you need to check in to the left hand side window.  They scan your magic band or card and check you in.  They then give you a menu and have you stand to the right side line.  You wait there until you get called into the \\"castle\\" restaurant.  Get ready to place your order as you will do this and pay before sitting down.  You then go into the dining area and pick your own seat.   There are three different rooms to eat in, so pick wisely if you are only eating here once.  There's the main ballroom area, dark Beast room where there's thunder and lightning (location of the ride in the glass case), and another room where there's a mini statue of belle and beast dancing in the middle.  \\n\\nThe food menu is pretty simple with not much on there, so it's easy to choose what you want.  For breakfast, we tried the Feast A La Gaston and Croque madame (recommend this). They also provide you with complimentary pastries.  For Lunch, we tried the braised pork, Croque Monsieur, French dip sandwich, and the grey stuff cupcake.  My favorite from lunch would have to be the braised pork.   \\n\\nOverall, the food is okay. The best part is the experience of eating in the restaurant itself.   \\n\\nOh and the coolest part I thought was the way they find you and where you chose to sit is by your magic band or they give you a rose tracker to place on your table.  Little bit creepy but tech savvy.  They'll drop off the food to you, but everything else is self serve/cafeteria style.\\n\\nDinner reservations are the hardest to get...I didn't get lucky to snag one last minute.

Potato, corn, and other minced veggies made up the stuffing of this samosa, that were wrapped in a not very doughy coating.

I cannot remember exactly what we had but everything was delicious! The chef puts their own twist on traditional dishes so it is really unique and special.

Via Napoli.... get. it. together. \\nWe went here the other evening after I told my friend \\"hey. let's eat in Italy because I never have before.\\" And here I am.... passholder. ha\\nAnyway, the good thing about this place is that it's a walk in restaurant where you get seated and don't have to make a reservation ahead of time. \\nAnnndddd.... that's about it.\\nThis review isn't about food. Because I never tried it.\\nIt's about how this place needs to reflect on how they run their restaurant and TRY AGAIN. \\nWhen we walked in to put our name on the list it was uncomfortable to get to the desk because it was insanely crowded and not much room for people to sit. Plus. The waiting area itself is super small for how popular this place seems to be. Once we put our name in I told the woman taking the names that we would have to be outside. She nodded. And usually that means that is cool and ok and they would tell us when our table is ready. We were told 15-20 minutes. My friend was with us and had to nurse her son and since no one was kind enough to offer their seat (with the limited seating in the area) she has to nurse on a chair outside. Which honestly is fine. It's not like they shunned her into a bathroom. But come on. We were RIGHT OUTSIDE. However, we missed our name because it's SO FREAKING LOUD inside and since we were OUTSIDE and they don't send their employees out there to call names we just didn't hear it.\\nSo I went inside to check and said \\"excuse me... have you called my name yet?\\"\\nThe girl at the desk looked overwhelmed so a man in a suit (manager) took over for her.\\n\\"yes, we called your name and had to give away your table...\\"\\nEven though this was frustrating the worse part is that they said we have to wait all over again. They didn't even offer to give us the NEXT TABLE.\\nWhat the heck kind of service is this?!? \\nAnyway. This place is a cluster. It's too crowded and the staff isn't helpful or even nice.

They serve the usual Italian restaurant pizza, pasta, and salads, but I don't think the quality is typical.  I started with a small house salad with house-made raspberry vinaigrette.  Kym H. said the gnocchi was amazing, so that's what I had.  I added chicken, and there were 4 sauces to choose from.  I asked for both pesto and the tomato cream sauce.  Excellent.

I arrive at the time advised, heard the guy at the register also making the customer he was helping repeat his order numerous times, and then it was my turn. They said they had no phone orders, told me I probably called the wrong place, and rushed to say \\"it's okay what did you order I'll just place it now.\\" He sounded EXACTLY like the guy who took our phone order. I placed the same order, paid, and went to wait at a table where I would call the \\"wrong\\" Los Gorditos to cancel my order. I went to my phone history, selected the number again to redial, and the phone rang to the guy up front.

There is a patio area on the second floor that has a great view of Westerville. The chicken tender appetizer was so good! The sauce was a delightful surprise and nice departure because it had a sweet sour tang to it.  The Onion rings were crispy and cooked to perfection. The food really was awesome.\\n\\nMORE GOOD-Interesting and eclectic selection of beers on tap that are locally sourced.\\n\\nTHE BAD-The dining room is badly conceived & tiny. We were told that there are only 2 full booths in the restaurant. Furthermore, to sit in a booth you must go up 3 flights of stairs. For someone with a disability we were never offered use of the elevator and it was quite difficult to climb all of the stairs. Additionally, it was obscenely hot upstairs.\\n\\nMORE BAD-No sides are served with the burgers. Everything is a la carte. Which is fine because the food really is great but the great flavor gets lost in the high price point.\\n\\nThe REALLY BAD-We were seated a little after 9PM and stated that we would have people joining us. At 9:15 the server came back and asked us if the rest of our party would be coming. Soon, otherwise they might get locked out and not be able to eat.? Unbeknownst to us the restaurant closes at 10PM.....WEIRD choice when you are marketing yourself as a bar with burgers?\\n\\nWe almost got up and left. Chose to stay and dine-wish we had chosen otherwise. Our meal was rushed and our service sucked. \\n\\nPerfect way to ruin a dining experience.\\n\\nCONCLUSION? Nice patio, BAD service, food is good but not good enough for the high price point and rude staff.

The last couple times I've been here, I've been the only one in the drive-thru and there were still two employees standing by the order boards. Maybe they could lower their prices by not overstaffing?! Just a thought ;-) \\nI ordered the original Chic-fil-A sandwich meal, #1 I believe. The meals come with waffle fries (YUM) and a drink. I always opt for their lemonade, so fresh and delicious! I ask for 3 Chic-fil-A sauces as I put some on my sandwich, and need a couple for waffle fry dipping :-D They are a little pricey, but I feel it's worth it for quality ingredients. The chicken is so good here...I've never bit into any gristle! \\nWhen I visited today, I was given a free iced coffee because they said they made an extra one by mistake. Yay for me!

Then, he says \\"technically are last show was 2 hours ago because NO ONE SHOWED UP\\"..... so now getting to the cherry on top. We decided to get our own food during the movie because they shut down everything. The manager then approached us into the theater telling us we couldn't have food. He then shuts off the entire movie and turns the lights on, not even giving us 2 minutes to get up. We then walk out, asking for a full refund, as we spent OVER $100 to watch this movie and the mangers GAGE AND DANIEL refused and were extremely disrespectful and insulting, telling us we are horrible customers.

Blue Star is more of a boutique-y, bougie donut with donut names like the Lemon Buttermilk Poppy Seed, Blueberry Bourbon Basil, Raspberry Rosemary Buttermilk, etc. And there's choices between the classic cake-like donut or a more fluffy, air-y donut. Voodoo's donuts are also good, but more I'd say gimmicky with their cereal, oreo and Voodoo man donuts -- but they're still good.

I'm not going to let that take away from how great this restaurant is but it makes for good comedy.* Here it is.\\n\\nLast Friday, Miss K and I were meeting two couples for a triple date and the six of us were seated in the semi-circular booth next to the entrance. I wanted to talk to my buddy so I eagerly climbed into the booth and slid in, followed by Miss K.\\n\\nIn the hostess's mind, seating yourself before your lady is as bad as denying women the right to vote because she shot me a scowl the likes of which I've seen only once before (when a guy in a New York Penn Station men's room opened a stall door to see shit all over the floor).\\n\\nYou know how some looks could kill? Well, this idiot's look could have hooked my balls up to a car battery and then waterboarded me.\\n\\nTo put things in perspective, I've met very few hostesses who were thrilled about their jobs. They earn less than servers on average, especially in high-end establishments like Waypoint where servers are elite and hostesses are glorified signposts.\\n\\nI wonder where she keeps her boyfriend's nuts. I think I saw them hanging off a chain around her neck.\\n\\nEnough complaining. Let's focus on the food.\\n\\nDespite the fact that Waypoint is the Alden & Harlow of the ocean, it does have a couple of hefty turf items on its menu. Miss K and I decided to get a surf appetizer and a turf entree.\\n\\nI looked at the menu.\\n\\nI had to google most of the items and their ingredients. I thought I knew food pretty well but there's a whole other level of ingredients that people who have fuck-you money have access to regularly.\\n\\n(And I don't. I'm just more frugal than a family of ten during the Depression).\\n\\nSo if you usually eat fried chicken, pizzas, ramen, or sushi when you go out, Waypoint's menu will simulate the experience of being shipped to a foreign war-torn country to cover a breaking news story. You'll see none of your familiar, comforting choices.  Not even close.  \\n\\nSuddenly, you have to eat mysterious flavors and textures and you just want to make doubly sure you're not eating the balls of a man who spoke out against the king and disappeared mysteriously.\\n\\nWaypoint doesn't have seed bags on its menu, so don't worry. But you will learn something looking up the ingredients.\\n\\nOur appetizer was the grilled monkfish cheek with inked eggplant and kohlrabi salsa verde.\\n\\nSee?  Ever heard of kohlrabi?  Me neither. It's a selectively bred relative of cabbage.  It makes a nice tangy salsa verde that complemented the inked eggplant. By \\"inked,\\" Waypoint literally meant that squid or octopus ink (or at least food coloring) was used to give the pureed eggplant the appearance of the night sky.\\n\\nThis puree had the consistency of mustard and it was fantastic. It was seasoned well and had just a slight, rough granularity to it that made it extremely pleasing to the tongue. Like making out with an angry squid.\\n\\nPause for a second and reflect that Yelp considers me elite for likening gourmet food to squid rape.\\n\\nI've never had monkfish before so eating the cheek was an immediate immersion into this delicacy. The cheek was soft, white, and melt-in-your-mouth with just a hint of chewiness, just a hint, that made it such a buttery, pleasing bite, especially with a smear of inked eggplant.  You should get it. Even if you get other starters, just get it. You'll love it.\\n\\nThe monkfish is the world's best argument why you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.  Before butchering, it looks like Welven da Great but access the right parts of its horrific-looking body and you have a small piece of fish you can sell for the price of ten Happy Meals.\\n\\nGet it!\\n\\nOur main course was the roasted chicken and veggies.  \\n\\nThis doesn't sound too glamorous but places like Waypoint do things to food that elevate it beyond the impaled birds at Star Market.  \\n\\nFirst of all, this bird still had its feet. I grabbed a drumstick and it was the first time I had the talons of a chicken threatening to fondle my breasts. Yes, breasts. I've gained weight.\\n\\nYou'll see this in the photo below. It wasn't creepy at all, though. I thought it was badass. It seemed like something a medieval warrior would do: Just bop the bird on the head, chop off said dead head, cook body, and rip off a drumstick with foot still attached.\\n\\nI devoured the meat up to where the ankle would be on a human. Then I tried chewing on the foot but it was too rubbery and there wasn't enough meat. The sight of the foot had me regressing to caveman by that point, which doesn't take much anyway, but I had to stop because there just wasn't anything there.\\n\\nI reached in for seconds\\n\\nAs expected, even the tougher parts of the chicken were flavorful and tender. I think slow-cooking was partly responsible but I'm not going to deconstruct it. Just go to Waypoint and treat your palate. Also, the servers were like machines and they patiently answered all our questions.\\n_________________\\n\\n*A psychotic rant."},{"name":"Wendy's","address":"10674 W Colonial Dr","city":"Ocoee","stars":"2.5","text":"We waited 30 minutes because of the poor service and a trainee.

One of a firmer variety and another of a mushier, creamier variety. Kiku's imitation crab meat was of the latter variety.

The Consulate was the first on the list after reviewing the menu I was interested but after looking on Yelp and seeing their bathroom I knew it was the perfect place to celebrate my husband's birthday. The Consulate is located in Midtown, my gps had me go the long way around the building and down the stairs but it is directly across the street from the Marta station. \\n\\nAmbiance: The ambiance is so satisfying that my husband who is very hard to impress was smiling ear to ear before we even ordered our food (a major wife win!) Think of the member's only club that's in all spy movies, the place in the back of a butchers shop but is really where all of the high rollers in town spend their leisure time lol and that is what the Consulate felt like. Upon entering your greeted by a hostess. We had a reservation and were taken directly to our table. The lights are perfectly dim and each table is candle lit. The d√©cor is a refreshing blend of both masculine and feminine charm which can be witnessed by the choices made in the two bathrooms. One is decorated in a classic Victorian style that is fit for a princess and the other displays a wide array of guns on the wall.  Throughout the restaurant there are china plates, instruments, Egyptian artifacts and much more strategically placed on the walls.  I would love to talk to the owners and hear more about the d√©cor. It all seems very intentional.\\n\\nService: Impeccable! Our waiter Jackson was so knowledgeable about the menu items it was almost un real. He was passionate about the offerings, detailed with explaining the structure of the menu and the ingredients, and patient. His attentiveness was not affected when more parties were added to his section. He was seriously the best waiter that I have ever encountered.\\n\\nFood: Mouthwatering, flavorful, just Perfect!!! Although the restaurant is tapas they have different portion options. Their menu unique in the sense that they change the international items regularly providing international dishes from around the world, there are staple items on the menu and they keep popular items as well (I did not do Jackson's explanation any justice but hopefully it was an accurate paraphrase) I ordered the Empanadas, Brussels Sprouts and the Ethiopian tibs and my husband had the Chicken skewers, the Steak and the Okra. Every dish was perfectly flavorful, the sauces that accompanied the dishes were perfectly matched and the portions were extremely satisfying.

It was flavorful (if rather salty) but the meat was somewhat dry. It's done Coq au Vin \\"style\\" but I think it would have been better if they had just served Coq au Vin. \\n-The \\"Grey Stuff\\" dessert ($5) was both delicious (as the song goes) but also disappointing. The cookies and cream frosting was good but it was on a quite hard chocolate torte. I think it would be better on a softer brownie. \\n-Finally, they have a special wine selection but I went with one of the less expensive wines ($9 for the glass) and it was just ok. \\n\\nThese prices are for dinner---it might be better coming here for lunch and then going to a better restaurant at one of the resorts for dinner.

The restaurant is owned by the Patina group, they have multiple restaurants in WDW such as Maria and Enzo and Tutto Italia. The theming in the restaurant is top notch, some of the best I've seen on Property. It is good to note that I have walked up in the past for LUNCH and have been seated in 20 minutes or less. I absolutely recommend trying Via Napoli, especially if you have a larger party, it is quite inexpensive, if you order the right way on the menu, you will have an amazing experience without breaking the bank.

It's warm, cozy and very clean.  Kids can hang out, walk around and they won't be all up in your grill. \\n\\n2 - The Beer. I know they have a big guest tap list until they get their own stuff rolling out, but everything I've tried and husband has tried has been really great. \\n\\n 3 - The Kids Menu. Finally... a decent kids menu that doesn't break the bank. My kids love the burgers, the mac n cheese and fruit. The fries, too, are some of the best around. Finally, our kids aren't choosing chain restaurants (looking at you, Dirty Red Bird) for their birthday dinners. This is monumental as we've lived here for almost three years now.  This place is very kid-friendly and we love it. \\n\\n4 - The brussels sprouts and rum old fashioned. Please don't ever change these! Sprouts are perfectly charred with salty goodness and a bit of heat at the end. So. Good. If these ever go away, I will cry. \\n\\n5 - That Deck. We've yet to sit outside on a warm summer evening, but we can't WAIT. You'll have to kick us out of there. \\n\\nHonorable Mention:\\nThe bread pudding. So. Stinking. Delicious.  And the food. While there are some tweaks needed (chicken al carbon was really too smoky and overdone), most of the food we've tried has been right in point (pointing to cod or salmon fish and chips). \\n\\nPossible improvement idea: More Cider options! \\n\\nWelcome, Wayfinder!

She then said, \\"I could have swore there was a candle cobbler here in the table?\\" I said, \\"There was  and I caught a fly on the window and then put your paper menu on the top, putting it on the next table and then the bus boy came by and took it.\\" She actually looked at me like I STOLE the goblet. I looked at her and said I could not even make up that story, you can go ask the bus boy.  \\n\\nI looked at my mom and she agreed that she had a tone implying that I took the goblet. My dad was clueless at this time. Eventually the food came out and I had ordered my sandwich without onions.

I let her know and then she said she should have  checked in with us earlier, I them implied that yes she should have.

My desire for coffee-tasting-iced-coffee was met with a seemingly pleasant attitude, but as soon as I turned my back my companion noticed the trademark barista-pissed-at-a-customer-for-thinking-they-should-get-what-they-ordered banter. Rad.\\n\\nAnd on to the espresso shot: the hopper of the espresso grinder was nearly empty and I could clearly see beans bouncing up and down as they met the burrs.  This means the espresso was not ground well, and this means I was given a fairly poor shot.\\n\\nAll and all a bad first impression.  I do, however, have to commend the establishment for having smaller sizes that are not readily available in this area: a 12oz iced cup and a lack of 16oz cappuccinos are worth recognition.  Also they use Terroir, one of the regions best roasters. \\n\\nOne more thing: they totally ripped off Bloc 11's decor; only with an Ethan Allen twist."},{"name":"Tijuana Flats","address":"3331 S.

After eating here, my husband asked can we go up to Orlando just to eat here. We have a young baby, so no. But that is testament to how much we now love this place.\\n\\nThis is not a pop in and pop out establishment. We were here for over two hours. Shout out to my baby for sleeping the entire time!

If you don't take away anything else from this review, you should try that. Do it. You won't be disappointed. Oh my carb, I died and went to carb heaven munching on that bread. They also bring you bread to the table so I basically filled up before dinner. I was making up for all that bread I couldn't eat while I had gestational diabetes. \\n\\nIf you are Vegetarian or Vegan, they have their own special menu! I ended up getting a maize crusted tofu off of it just because it sounded delicious. My husband represented us in the meat department by getting the Snake River Farms Wagyu Strip Loin. Both were amazing. I definitely ate more than my fair share of my husband's dish. These dishes are on the pricier side (his dish was $49), but I've found Disney is on the pricier side and this food was delicious (we have had bad meals at Disney.) \\n\\nThe other great thing about this restaurant is it is in the Animal Kingdom Lodge. It's fun to walk around the lodge after your meal. They had a drum circle for kids the night we were there (and I'm guessing every night.) Since we were timing our drive around my baby's naps, we ended up walking around the lodge for about an hour and a half. When you walk outside you can see animals (we saw some zebras.)

So when arriving to Golden Temple as a party of 11 with a reservation, including 5 young children, we were quickly seated and browsing through the several page menu. Who doesn't love family style Chinese dinners? We ordered a table full of appetizers and plates (even some we didn't order) overflowed our table for the main course... and to top off the filling dinner- we got about 5 extra fortune cookies (one with a bad fortune which of course I out of pure coincidence brought home for my roommate-- it made her feel great). \\n\\nSome of the more memorable dishes I tried (good and bad) were Vegetable Tempura (delicious), Chicken Pot Stickers (meh), Crispy Orange Beef (bizarre), Sesame Chicken (typical), Vegetable Lo Mein (good) and Green Tea Buckwheat Spicy Sesame Noodles with Vegetables (this was a dish ordered by another table which arrived to our table- of course we dug in not remembering we didn't order it- and it was not good..)\\n\\nThe waiter seemed frantic and yelling at us the whole time- not yelling angrily- but yelling frantically. Granted you have a loud table of 11- but we didn't order specific dishes so all he had to do was take our order and bring it out. The wait was longer than it probably should have been to get the food- but when you have great company- you barely notice (I barely noticed..). So overall- it was good- Sunday nights didn't include dancing, so I had to stay in my seat, but I was satisfied with the evening.\\n\\nAnd the best fortune of the night? \\n'If you're still hungry, eat another fortune cookie.'"},{"name":"Culver's - Austin","address":"2240 W Braker Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Had this again tonight but did the drive thru experience.\\nWarning!

The scallop carpaccio was 4 pieces of quality sashimi scallop atop thin cucumber slices with delectable slightly spicy marinade. As for the mains, I highly recommend the uni soba. Portions for the soba were generous. The uni was a generous portion, garnished with egg roe as well, and incredibly creamy and fresh. The soba noodles are thick and substantial. Fantastic broth as well that isn't too salty. The ebi soba was interesting because it was called shrimp tempura soba but the shrimp tempura was more like mini Japanese/Korean pancakes with shrimp atop.
