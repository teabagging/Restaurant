This place did not disappoint in the least bit. \\n\\nChoosing wasn't easy, I'll give you that much.  There's udon, yakitori, sushi and an appetizer list that made me want to pull a OFE (one of everything). Eventually I narrowed it down and opted for the yakitori over rice.  Four different kinds of yakitori, with homemade secret sauce.  Holy WOW.  The chicken meatballs are delish, the rice was perfect, the pickled cucumber & cauliflower was a great pair as well.  I noticed on the menu that it said they only buy local young chickens, which is why their yakitori is so great.   \\n\\nThe other thing I loved was that the miso soup was hearty.  Not in a chili hearty, but a good broth.  Most places, miso soup is so clear and has a small hunk of tofu floating in it.  Jinbei's had seaweed, onions, some tofu and if I'm not mistaken, pork.  \\n\\nThe gyoza was homemade and stuffed with a veggie mix.  I could literally drink a bowl of the sauce they served with it (as well as the sauce that came on the chicken).\\n\\nI brought along my Mom, in hopes that I could show her a glimpse of the foods I was introduced to overseas and she couldn't believe how tasty delicious everything was either.

It was a bit of a wait--probably because we were so hungry when all of a sudden our server delighted us with a complimentary appy, a single of their signature meatball, topped with tomato sauce and a slice of parmesan.  The beef was perfectly cooked from outside to the centre, no dryness and most of all, the meat flavour was great!  No trace of gaminess that is a common complaint about beef of lesser quality or the chef's lack of skills.\\n\\nThe chicken parmesan was awesome!  Generous portions of chicken breast and cheese; batter was very light, fluffy and the perfect degree of crunch; the tomato sauce was flavourful, with ample bites of sundried tomato and crispy pancetta.  Although it was a little too salty, the dish overall was absolutely delicious.   The similar can also be said of the lobster linguine.  I expected slivers of frozen lobster meat but there was the equivalent of at least 3 large lobster tails, which was presented mostly intact and not shredded like many restaurants do.  The pasta sauce was cream-based, but the texture was very light and just the right amount coated the al-dente linguine that it did not give me that dreaded heavy feeling after eating it.  \\n\\nMy friend and I shared our dishes and we both loved the food and drinks.

I've found places where they may have one or two tasty items, but at China Moon everything is tasty!\\n\\nI came across this little gem over the Christmas holiday thanks you \\"Yelpers\\" out there.  I was searching for something near my home in Winter Springs and saw that this place had 4.5 stars.  I had initially started out thinking pizza but hey, Chinese is good to so en route to Luna's the hubs and I made the switch. \\n\\nThe restaurant is tiny.  I mean that literally.  It's tucked into a strip mall next to a package/convenience store and as mentioned it's not well lit outside.  I was expecting the inside to be similar to all other take out places I've been with the sad Formica tables and vinyl chair showing wear but man was I wrong! The inside is bright...lots of light and painted a warm\\ngray/green.  The floor is new and unscuffed and the baseboards and door trims are bright white. There are some abstract works of art on the walls and it's clear that the owners take pride in their establishment. \\n\\nAs for the owners this is a true family run establishment. Being that we were there during the holiday, the daughters were working the front while mom and dad prepared the food.  They took or orders and joked around not only with us, but with each other.  The highlight was when one sister patted the head of the other and said \\"Good job Annie...I knew you could do it\\"!  We later found out that \\"Annie\\" was the older of the two girls.  It may sound odd, but for a moment it felt like I was part of their family!\\n\\nAs if cleanliness and family aren't already enough, the food is...well, the food is amazing. The dinner combos are a great deal.  Large in portions of the entree plus an eggroll and soup.  We had the General Tso's Chicken, Five Flavor Chicken, Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao Chicken.  The dinner's come with pork fried rice but I asked for a substitution of white rice with the Gen Tso's and they were very accommodating.  I had also ordered some steamed vegetable dumplings.  They were out of those and the owner came over to apologize and offered me another appie for the same price.  I asked if she had the pork dumplings, which she did, so I took those instead. Everything was perfect.  The eggrolls were crisp and not greasy, the fried rice was smokey and filled with roast pork, the green onions in the Mongolian Beef were still crispy tender, the sauces were not too sweet or too salty...it was simply lovely.  \\nSince our initial visit we have been back trying the egg drop soup, wonton soup and Mooshu Chicken.\\n\\nThe prices may be a tiny bit more (if at all) than other places and they don't do the \\"Spend $30 get a Quart of free soup\\" that I've seen other placed do but for a family of 4 it seemed average to me at $40. And the quality is well worth the cost. \\n\\nIf you are in the Longwood area near Ronald Reagan Blvd, or even if you aren't, you should definitely make a stop by Chin Moon!\\n\\nPros:\\n- Food is amazing and they have a few extra menu items you don't often see such as Mooshu, Chop Suey, Chow Mein and Mei Fun.\\n- Owners are great! They talk with you while they cook your food and keep you updated as to how much longer you have.\\n- Pristine clean!!! \\n\\nCons:\\n- Tiny inside...8 seats only so it's really meant to grab and go (which means you have to wait to eat the amazing food!)"},{"name":"Bar Mezzana","address":"360 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Apparently a new gentrified Boston neighborhood.

The most popular thing here is the Beer Flight ($9.50 or $11.50) to get a taste of many brews at once. I tries the Cuppa beer ($4.50 8oz and $7.50 16oz) on draft and it was really really good 10/10. The flavor was great and I could taste all the ingredients mentioned. My friends also tried the Kombucha ($4.00) which was delicious too hence the non alcoholic options are worth a try as well.

This was a ton of food (and the total order without tip came to only $30). We definitely over-ordered in case anything was a miss. Nothing was, though, so we ended up pigging out.\\n\\nMy chicken taco was really good -- the meat was tender and juicy, the cole slaw and beets complemented it perfectly. The side salad had tomatoes, beets, and corn on it, which was tasty and went quite well with the chicken taco. I'm going to just say now that one chicken taco + the side salad was *plenty* of food. The taco was quite well-filled. My husband got the quesadilla and the corn tamale -- he really liked the quesadilla and he said the tamale was good but it also had an interesting, complex flavor. The chips that came with the guacamole were amazing (as was the salsa that came with the quesadilla). The guacamole itself was a bit meh, but guacamole preferences tend to be quite subjective, so if you like it creamer with less spice, this guac is up your alley.\\n\\nThe cheese empanada was amazing -- I wasn't sure about ordering a cheese empanada (I thought it would be too much cheese) but the empanada was actually fairly small so it was more like a mozzarella stick which was really tasty.\\n\\nThe only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is that it took forever and things were cold when I got them. They were still tasty, but cold. I ordered at an off time and it took 1.5 hours. I can only imagine how long it takes at peak times. \\n\\nThe prices are reasonable, and the food is amazing, so I still say go/order/eat.

I tell the cashier how long we've been waiting and he checks with the kitchen. He then tells us that they had a big order right before us and that they were swamped (but still apparently able to bring out food to others who came after us) but assured us our food was coming out immediately. \\n\\nWe wait some more. At this point it's been 50 minutes of waiting. So I talk to the cashier again who says it's coming out now. When the food does finally come out after 1 hour of waiting, my roommate and I BOTH discover we didn't even get what we had ordered. Neither of our wraps had paneer and NEITHER had tikka masala or butter sauce. So a) we waited an hour and b) the food was not even what we ordered.\\n\\nThen I demand to see the manager. After practically haggling for it, he grants us a refund (and acts like it was out of the goodness of his heart to give us refunds). After that we ask if they'll remake the food correctly for us. He says \\"No. We gave you your food. I gave you guys your refund.\\" We left with our [incorrectly-made] food, disgruntled, tired, and impatient. \\n\\nTeji's is the kind of restaurant that does not care for its customers. It does not know how to properly make food or prioritize the chronology of orders and it does not know how to treat its patrons. I will reiterate that I have NEVER encountered as worse of an experience at a restaurant than what I encountered here.

When going to an establishment that is as expensive as Barcelona I expect the best of the best. We tried a few tapas, paellas, and some dessert. First the tapas. They were good, I would say the best part of the meal. We tried the calamari, short rib, and fingerling potatoes. The short rib was tender but the sauce was very salty, a little bit too much. The calamari was excellent and I have no complaints there. The fingerling potatoes were good as well. We tried two paellas, one with short rib and scallops and the other with lobster, mussels, clam, and shrimp. Both of these were good but nothing amazing. The short rib had too much fat for my liking. The scallops were amazing and some of the best Ive had (I wish they had an all scallop paella). The seafood paella was decent; I think you get more protein with the other paella that are not the seafood one. I really wanted to love the seafood paella, because seafood is my absolute favorite but I wasnt that impressed. The rice was a little soggy but did not compliment it as well as I expected. We finished with some carrot cake dessert which was ok. It was topped with a sweet potato sorbet which added to the dish nicely. The cake itself was nothing amazing.

The place in some ways, has vague resemblances of a 10 Tables or Bon Savor but is still very unique; small, with only nine tables, for a total of twenty four covers: it is very intimate, cozy and welcoming.\\n\\nWe proceeded to arrive for our reservation, for two, and were immediately taken care of; our coats were taken from us, and we were graciously seated to our table. A selection of fresh breads (whole grain, walnut-cherry, Bronze fennel seed and Sepia-Nori) and butter was brought to us, and our menus as well. Those are printed and updated daily which is quite remarkable - I noticed that their website is also updated accordingly although it fails to list their desserts... But more on that later.\\n\\nAfter ordering a nice glass of Malbec wine, I decided to start my meal with their hand-made burrata offering. Priced at $12 it featured some French butter pears, a celery salad and some Mangalitsa Guanciale. It was drizzled with a walnut dressing. It was absolutely delicious and the crisp celery's texture worked well against the softness of the creamy burrata. It was very fresh and the portion rather large. \\n\\nThen I did something which makes this place standout and in my opinion, something that restaurants should offer more frequently. Every entre they offer is offered in half or full sizes, each at it's own price and instead of getting a single entree, I got two different halves. In my case I settled for their roasted Futsu Squash, which came with vegetable mignardises and some sage stuffing ($12) and the Flat Iron Steak which was plated with a mole sauce, some celeriac and some kale ($12). \\n\\nFirst came the squash which in no way was a half-portion. They could have fooled me with the size of the thing! It was pretty damn big and very, very tasty. It was beautifully roasted and the sage stuffing was... well. like crack. I devoured the whole thing in just mere instants. The vegetables were beautifully sauteed, and were very fresh. You could taste every single one of them and they were cooked perfectly and in no way were mushy, instead tasting crisp.\\n\\nAnd then came the steak. While I noticed that at no point was I asked how I wanted my steak cooked, everything came out perfectly. The steak was a bit on the rare side but was absolutely delicious and the mole sauce, although untraditional, worked well. The side vegetables were great as well and the portion, again was quite large.\\n\\nAt this point of the meal I pretty much hit a wall, I was rather stuffed but when the desert menu arrived we decided to share the trio of ice creams, which features the following flavors: Kefir Lime, Cranberry and Olive. Although the Lime one was tasty, we had a bit of trouble distinguishing between the Olive and Cranberry one for a few seconds before noticing the vague hint of saltiness in one versus the other. It was not what I expected but was good none the less. We also had a chocolate desert, a pyramid of sorts which came plated alongside a froth and I couldn't remember what it was unfortunately but it was very good and surprisingly light.\\n\\nBondir has a great balance of high end food at affordable prices and in a very intimate, small and cosy restaurant atmosphere; the fireplace adds a wonderful element to the dinning room which otherwise is decorated in the most simple of ways with only a painting on one of the back walls and the fireplace serving as a centerpiece alongside a small table next to it where a few bottles of wine and plates are stacked. There is however a uniqueness to it, especially since there's nothing like it in Cambridge; it feels like the kind of place you'd find in Jamaica Plain and yet no, it's just a few minutes away from Central Square and I find that remarquable. Chef Bond has always been a very underrated chef in this city and this is a great way for him to possibly get the exposure he deserves. \\n\\nEverything was fresh, the setting was great and they did all of the small things right - from the service to the beautiful silverware and plates - It was all very impressive and the attention to detail is phenomenal.

The Texas Burrito is my personal fave because it's only $5.99 and about as massive as a burrito you'd get at chipotle, except a lot greasier which I'm certainly not going to complain about. Amazing comfort food. I just had one a couple hours ago and mentioning it is already making my mouth water.

The bad was the Brisket and Arkansas ribs.  The Brisket was mediocre - certainly edible, but it wasn't the melt in your mouth experience I've come to expect.

I appreciated that the crust held up for the whole empanada and didn't break apart nor was there a pool of grease in the last bites. The Picadillo was classically good. The filling could go straight onto rice and I'd be happy. The BBQ Chicken and Gouda was generously filled with a sweet BBQ sauce that had a good smoky hint. I couldn't really get the Gouda flavor but to be honest its so good I don't mind at all. My Favorite was the Vegan Chorizo Potato. The spices and texture reminded me of an Indian Samosa.  The Vegan Chorizo was the crumbles kind so there were not chunks of sausage and that was nice as the crumbles blended in with the smooth potato filling with a few potato chunks. OMG the flavors though! I kept making embarrassing yummy moans when i was eating it. NSFW!\\nI also tried their Kale and Apple and Sunflower Seed Salad with Tarragon Dijon Dressing (extra $3).

I had the chicken tacos from appetizer.  Not what I expected based on appearance but didn't taste all that bad.  It filled me up somewhat.  That's all I needed, wasn't going no where near the entrees.  I was reading reviews how someone said 2 patron shots was $35. . . Talk about inflation.

Unfortunately my experience at Scratch didn't live up to my expectations. When we arrived there were no tables available but we were able to sit at the bar. We were told that if a table opened up we would be moved, but we watched several tables sit empty the rest of the night with no one offering to re-seat us. We were hungry so we ordered the fresh baked pretzel immediately but it still took awhile to come out and then it wasn't even very good. It's sad that for a $9 item, the best part was the little dollop of berry jam. Next we had the grilled avocado topped with a fried egg. This was the best dish of the night. We also had the pork belly adobo and the crispy fried boar shoulder. I remember being disappointed in both items but I can't remember now exactly what it was that we didn't like. I think the pork belly may have been too dry and not very flavorful. Part of what ruined the experience was that the last three dishes all came out too quickly so we felt we were rushing to eat before our food got cold. I probably won't be returning to Scratch but I'd recommend maybe spacing out your order so everything doesn't come at once. The kicker to the whole experience was that at the end of the night my boyfriend's card got rung up for the wrong order. We were initially given the right bill to review, but then when he got the receipt it was for about $40 more and some other customer's order.

Someone suggested House of Louie and we all headed on over.  \\n\\nWe got there around 9 p.m.  On a Sunday night, the restaurant closes at 10 p.m., so after a bunch of us looked at the menu and asked if they could handle our group of 11, we were led to the very back room and a large round table.\\n\\nI split the Ma Po Tofu with a friend and found it to be okay.  There was nothing that made it bad and nothing that made it stand out.  Most everyone cleaned their plates.  Those that didn't took their leftovers home.\\n\\nThe staff was friendly and probably a little intimidated by our large group, but the food was delivered in a timely manner and they were able to ring up everyone's order separately, at the register.  It was on okay outing for us.  \\n\\nAfter reading reviews about cockroaches, I'm not sure that I would return, but I suppose I wouldn't rule it out either because I didn't personally see anything that made me suspicious of the quality of food."},{"name":"Italian Kitchen","address":"860 Burrard St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Came for the second time to Italian kitchen last night with one of my friends.

My only complaint would be that our server wasn't really paying much attention to our table and it took forever for her to bring out anything we asked for , and the restaurant wasn't that busy. She seemed more pre occupied with the table with the 3 guys rather than our table of 2 girls. She even had a drink with them also. I don't think that's very professional on shift.

Sent it back. By the time it came back the rest of the table was done eating. The salmon was decent the second time around, the asparagus was rough and chewy.

Some of our food was cold or not prepared right. The special they had when we visited was chicken and waffles. The chicken was drenched in siraccha sauce so it was pretty spicy. I ended up ordering buttermilk pancakes and chicken sausage. The chicken sausage was very good as it had a spicy kick to it as well. The pancakes came with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. And I can't forget about the complimentary biscuits and muffins that you begin with. It also includes two jams and honey butter. Amazing!

As a matter of fact, this is my all time favorite place to dine. Let me start off by explaining the atmosphere, there is no bad place to sit in this restaurant, the views are amazing from anywhere. The kitchen is on the west side of the restaurant so you get a full view of the Willamette valley and the Cascade mountain range. I love coming here just before sunset to watch the area change as the sun goes down and day becomes night. The whole restaurant seems to be focused on the view, the decor is very modest to keep your eyes out the windows.\\n\\nThe service at PCG is top notch. The servers always seem to be right there to get you what you want, when you want it. They are also very knowledgeable of the menu and drink selections and can assist you in making decisions if you are having difficulty choosing between the many items. I have yet to have poor or even average service at PCG.\\n\\nNow we get to the food, I can not talk enough about the food served here. The sushi, appetizers and main courses are all fabulous. No one I have ever brought to eat here has ever complained about the food, and there is a large enough menu that anyone can find something they like. I have made trips here for the kung pao calamari alone.\\n\\nDon't be scared off by the prices, they are very, and I stress very reasonable for what you get. Many restaurants of this caliber will have you paying twice what you pay at PCG.

The food demands to be appreciated, and sometimes I want something that's a bit more eager to please. What do I mean? Well, the octopus ink bread comes to mind.

I'm never gonna eat there again."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"After going to Neptune Oyster a few times, I've decided it's one of my favorite restaurants in Boston. \\n\\nI agree with other reviews that have noted slow service and high prices. But here's the thing--I don't mind long lunches or dinners (in some circumstances) and I definitely don't mind paying high prices for fabulous food. Granted, I won't go regularly since I'm living on a grad school budget, but for a splurge, it's great. \\n\\nFirst tip: if you sit at the bar, things tend to move a little faster. You're right in front of them so there's no ignoring an empty dish or glass.\\n\\nSecond tip: Even if you're not a huge fan of eating an entire meal full of raw seafood (like I do), Neptune Oyster has wonderful alternatives for you--particularly their daily specials in the corner of the menu. I sampled my boyfriend's fish and chips (he's one of those who doesn't live off raw seafood) and it was honestly the best I've ever had. It was an ACTUAL filet of fish instead of those pathetic pieces they normally fry up for fish and chips. It was perfectly battered and the fries were awesome. I was really, really surprised that they did such a good job with it.\\n\\nI've had a various assortment of the oysters they offer plus the clam chowder, hamachi, and a few other random entrees. I'm allergic to lobster and crab--so I can't attest to that myself. I can only repeat rave reviews from my parents when they last came with me.\\n\\nThe oysters are always amazing. Super fresh, absolutely the best quality and always presented well. I order extra kumamodo (sp??) and kusshi. I'm a huge fan of the small, plump oysters that are less briny than the bigger ones. But I'll eat (and appreciate) any oyster. I could literally eat an entire meal of those two oysters alone with a glass of white wine and be the happiest person in the world.\\n\\nThe clam chowder isn't everything I hoped it would be. It has great quality ingredients and the clams are wonderful but the soup was a little thin for me. But that might just be personal preference.\\n\\nWhatever fabulous sea bass concoction was offered the second time I was there with my boyfriend....oh my god. Insanely delicious. The fish just melted in your mouth. I believe it also came with a polenta that made my day.\\n\\nHamachi--always a winner. Beautifully presented and absolutely delicious.\\n\\nTriton platter--supposedly incredible. My parents split it during my most recent visit and I, sadly, could not partake...but they talked about it through the night and into the next day. The lobster salad was a huge winner, as were the mussels, clams and oysters. The shrimp were HUGE. Oh dear lord were they big. And supposedly also quite good. Needless to say, I was insanely jealous. \\n\\nThe trick to Neptune Oyster is to not go during extended peak hours. Go for lunch (same menu, smaller crowd) or around 9ish if you can stand a late dinner. Personally, I love long lunches so I love going (when I can, obviously), in the early afternoon and just eating as much as humanly possible. Maybe that's what made the slower table service more acceptable my last visit. It was also only one waitress for the whole restaurant and she tried to be as attentive as possible so I respect her for that. I've also never, ever had a problem with any of the staff at the restaurant. They have always treated me with respect and have been very friendly through the meal.\\n\\nFinal tip: Put your name in when you're not hungry, wander around the great little shops in the area, then indulge when they call you. Don't expect to immediately get in. It's a tiny, tiny restaurant and it's always crowded. But it's crowded for a reason.... So not a place to go on a whim unless it's some weird hour of the day because you'll face a long wait and get cranky. Just take a breath, relax and enjoy."},{"name":"Bondir Cambridge","address":"279A Broadway","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Recently went on a Wednesday night and thought Bondir was a great, cozy place that to me (living in the s end)was very Cambridge.

It was a magical evening- we timed it so we were able to watch the Magic Kingdom's fireworks display from the porch (they pipe in the music), then we watched the Electric Light Parade (it's a water parade that goes right by the restaurant), and just as it was finished, our table was ready.  We were significantly overdressed (it's a Signature Dining experience, and we had that a tie and dress would not be out of place).  We were only 1 of two couples that were dressed what I would deem appropriate for a restaurant of this type. Everyone else was in shorts, jeans, t-shirts,etc.  Our reservations were for 9:30pm, and there were still children at the restaurant (though they cleared out within 45 minutes of our seating).  The food was amazing- the bread & butter was fantastic.  I had the most amazing butternut squash ravioli in a brown butter sauce.  We also had the BEST dessert we've ever eaten ANYWHERE here...the cheesecake.  You may think it sounds simple when you read the description on the menu, but let me assure you, you've never had cheesecake like this before (unless you've already eaten here).  It looks a bit like a medium sized wheel of cheese and it's been rolled in a lightly toasted/sugared almond crust. A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.  It's not to be missed!

They had that fake smoke flavor I can't stand, and some bland black beans with them.  The tortillas they provide are good (both corn and flour).  They have an extensive drink menu, so that plus the nice dips makes them a happy hour destination but I'd go elsewhere for dinner.

The seasoning was something we still talk about and really enjoyed. We did have to add extra which they have on the table. However; besides that everything really lacked flavor. What I didn't like was the texture of the lobster. You could tell it had been pre-cooked and kept cold but it seemed wet and just not what I was looking for or something I would order again. To me they have done the lobsters a disservice. For the price I was disappointed in the size. One of the smallest rolls I've had with the least amount of lobster as well.

I have noticed it hard to get servers attention after you initially order.  \\n\\nI haven't been here for dinner so this review is only on their happy hour food.  My two favorite menu item is their kung pao calamari and shoestring fries with the aioli.

Then instead of shoe-string fries, we got this thick wedges of potato--I didn't ask for soggy jo-jo's, I wanted crispy fries.  My friends and I were so disappointed to see that they changed that.

I got the fried shrimp po-boy sand which, fried pickles as an appetizer, and the one who I was with got the chicken panchatrain (don't know how to spell it). The chicken dish tasted just like my moms home made \\"party chicken\\" if your not an olive fan, I highly do not recommend. The olive sauce is well, olive sauce and it does taste like...olives. I loved the big artichoke hearts in the dish and the chicken was so juicy and tender. I enjoyed that dish, a bit on the wild side. The po boy was to die for, the  remoulade is so yummy and will have you diving for more. The sand which is big! I had to take half home and I only ordered a half size. French fries as a side was okay, next time I'm gonna go for the sweet potato fries, the regular fries kinda tasted like a smothering burnt taste. The fried pickles were GREAT!

The service was very friendly, although both servers pretty much talked me out of my favorite appetizer when I asked how many fried mushrooms you got for 6 bucks and they said 6 (ya call me cheap, but I am a cook and will just make my own for that frikkin  price.)  I got the \\"wet danubes,\\" zesty fries which is french fries with your choice of beef or chicken gravy for $3.50 or add $.50 for curly fries ( I would just go with regular next time)  While the gravy was hot the fries were not so much and I asked for them as the appetizer that they are, but got them along with the meal.  I ordered chicken and dumplings with mashed potatoes and gravy and mac n cheese.  The food was all piping hot and the mac n cheese has a weird flavor that I attribute to the cottage cheese I think they are using, but it was a tasty variation mind you.  Mashed potatoes I am willing to bet are totally instant, but the gravy is homemade I am sure because the chef appears to be inclined to make all their gravies tangy (not bad mind you just different to me.)  Chicken and dumplings has the noodle style dumplings and chunks of chicken breast mmmmmm, all piping hot and I love that so much.  He ordered the roast beef open faced deal and we had to tell the server that it tasted like bad roast beef for which she allowed him to pick something else with no contest and so he got open faced turkey which turned out to be tasty too.

We went for a birthday, and it really was a fun place to go to for this. \\n\\nHowever, there were problems. Some were a bad experiences, and one was absurd price gouging that was quite off-putting. \\n\\nFirst, I found 1/2 a wishbone in my English Hen Ravioli (Luckily I spotted it early and didn't choke on it). This is a $250+ restaurant for two diners (including modest drink orders - not even a bottle of wine), so it's pretty shocking that I would find a bone in my dish. I pointed it out to my server, and while he fleetingly apologized, nothing came of it. I didn't want the chef to come out and apologize, but I do expect something more than \\"omigosh thanks for telling me\\" that the server offered. Finding a bone in such a high end restaurant must be pretty embarrassing for the chef, or, at least, it should be. \\n\\nSecondly, like Nasser R below, I got the raw lamb appetizer also, and have been having some stomach issues all day today (actually I'm quite sick now, but I can't confirm that the two might be related). \\n\\nFinally, my pork roast dish was entirely too dry and the sauce was not enough to make up for it. I couldn't finish it. I suspect they didn't let the meat rest, but hey, what do I know? \\n\\nIn price-gouging related news, the restaurant charges $8 for sparkling water. So $8 of our check of 200+ was just water. If Clover, a cheap local chain down the street can offer sparkling water for free, Bondir should too. Or, they should suck it up and say it out loud \\"Do you want still, sparkling or tap water? Oh, and by the way, we charge for our still and sparkling waters; they are priced more than our beers.\\"\\n\\nThese things marred our otherwise great experience. The ambience really is very nice, and it can be as romantic or friendly or business-meeting-like as you want it to be. \\n\\nI will, I guess, continue to wait for a real apology from the chef.\\n\\nVerdict: try to go on a work tab."},{"name":"The Park on South Lamar","address":"4024 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Greatly trained waitress Amberlee .

Run by a couple of super friendly ladies, you can get your fix of snacks like corn dogs, hand cut french fries, and fried pickles, all the way to desserts, with dangerously delicious bites of funnel cakes (with your choice of several toppings...or why not get em all?!), deep fried Oreo cookies, brownie bites, or cinnamon rolls.  I'm tellin ya...these ladies know how to fry!  Oh, and don't be scared of the chocolate covered candied bacon.  It's not a gimmick.  I was scared to try it at first, just based upon the idea, but it totally works.  Get there early if you want some because it does have a tendency to go quickly.\\n\\nOn any particular night, you may find that they are offering up unique specials, or they are totally willing to take an item from a neighboring trailer, batter it up, and fulfill your FRIED PIZZA or FRIED ICE CREAM SANDWICH dreams (which are a common occurrence when I'm off in dreamland).  I also appreciate that so much of their food is made from scratch on a daily basis.  They even make their own pickles!  I can attest that they are some legit pickles...that, of course, then get served piping hot encased by their super soft and fluffy fry batter.  \\n\\nFried and True has become a go-to spot for dessert for my friends and I.  If you have never had a deep fried Oreo cookie, I implore you to do so immediately!  As much as I try to eat healthy, Oreos are definitely one of my cheat snacks, and what these ladies do to these classic cookies, is just incredible.  The batter is light, the cookies get softer, and the dusting of powdered sugar just puts them over the top.  Must get.  Their funnel cakes can be ordered in two ways, based upon your own personal preferences...the \\"Fat Brother\\" is a thick and softer version, almost like an enormous donut, while the \\"Skinny Sister\\" is the more traditional \\"State Fair\\" type, that is flatter and crunchier.  It's up to you...I doubt you'll be disappointed by either choice.\\n\\nOr, if you are like me, and the idea of things being \\"TOO SWEET\\" is a completely foreign concept to you, the deep fried nutella and marshmallow fluff sandwich is simply divine.  The chocolate and marshmallow melt into one deliciously creamy and gooey mouthful of amazing.  Just thinking about it makes me want to return to get one right now.\\n\\nAs you can see, Fried and True is the kind of place that can inspire loyalty and devotion through its deep fried deliciousness.  I will keep coming back to try more of their menu items and to chat with the friendly fry-ladies.  I am a frequent food trailer visitor, as I very much appreciate that you can talk and form relationships with the owners and people who are actively involved in the success of their business.  Fried and True is no exception.

The mashed potatoes were acceptable.  The sides were hard... maybe over-baked or something.  The mushroom gravy was a tad too salty, and it had that undesirable oil separation.

I know I shouldn't complain about flies since I'm eating outside, at a trailer, but it just made it harder to enjoy the food. The water in the container outside tasted like chemicals. I think this place is good but the prices are a bit steep for a trailer.  I must say the service when you order is really excellent!

I have to say, it was my ideal breakfast, a little bit of everything, just like I like.  It also came with rye toast that was tip top.

Like fried pickles and jalepenos, and fried oysters, and chicken fried steak with white gravy and this tomato fennel side that is off the charts.  Also, a good honky tonk should have great specials like frickin' Taco Tuesdays.  Best buffalo shrimp and pulled pork tacos you will ever find and they are an incredible deal.  Finally, a good honky tonk needs atmosphere and they have two here: up is bright and trashy, down is dark and arty - very chill.  Finally, finally - this place has a great trashy margarita cheap!

Me and my boyfriend made a 6:30 reservation on a Friday, but we arrived 30 minutes, thanks to Uber! Finding the restaurant was easy, thanks to the yellow awnings on the exterior. We were greeted warmly by the host, his name escapes me, but he was very very polite and made us feel right at home. The bar was full so he offered us seats at their wine bar that was just adjacent. I got myself a Viva La Vida on their mixed drink list. It was refreshing and light, a great way to start off the night and not get filled up on alcohol before your meal, unlike the boyfriend who went with a beer, which they also had. Not much of a wine drinker, but do not shy away from coming here if you are! The selection is there for sure and they have it all. We even watched a couple stop by just to purchase a new bottle to go, recommended of course by their wine consultant of the evening. When 6:30 came around for our reservation we again went to the greeting desk and the host seated us, even making sure we got a window seat. Our waiter recommended a few things on the menu, one being the Guiness braised beef brisket with mashed horseradish mashed potatoes and the other being the Friday special, the pork shank and he sold it to us because that's what we ended up getting. We also got the crab avocado toasts as well, which were so flavorful, it made me want more and more. Both our meals were excellent and well sized. The attention from the staff was perfect, not over bearing but still watchful for the things you needed.

I'm sure it was a combination of things and possibly just bad timing.  But the lobster truck visits my work near 620.  It was a cold, rainy day so waiting 15 minutes in the cold, rainy weather put the expectation even higher.  \\n\\nThe poor organization initially killed my enthusiasm.  I waited patiently in line behind 3 others and as soon as it was my turn then I had to wait again so the cashier girl could fulfill their order.  No worries.  But when my food was ready.  The cashier girl didn't make the group of 4 wait to order, instead I watch my food sit in the window until she was done.  While slightly disgruntled, I tried to stay optimistic.  I couldn't help but wonder why they don't hire a 3rd person to help out.\\n\\nSince the food truck visits my work, I'm steps away from devouring Conneticut lobster goodness.  I ordered the half roll and literally had 4 pieces of COLD lobster that totally lacked  seasoning!  A small portion of the bread had soaked up the juices so there was definitely evidence of seasoning, but very little.  Still starving.  On to the crispy brussel sprouts!  I have to say that I don't like brussel sprouts, but, in the time of new year's resolution to be healthy, I ordered them.  It was definitely a generous portion of brussel sprouts with maybe 2 crumbs of bacon in there.  And unfortunately, Searsucker set the bar really high for my new found love of brussel sprouts.  These were okay and I wouldn't have eaten them, except I paid nearly $20 and was super hungry.  \\n\\nThe bottom line is I paid too much to still starving afterward.  Not worth it.  At these prices, I'm sure they can afford the overhead of one more person to fulfill hot orders.

Tasty sauces and marinades on the meats of every taco I've had so far and they've nailed al pastor tacos.\\nThe place's somewhat homely appearance, locale (it's in that weird strip mall that is known  as International Plaza - Asian food stores, Mexican grocers, Bosnian deli) and bad neighborhood might mean this is one of the few Mexican taco joints that may be rather douche-free (the bane of most good taco stands - Mexican restaurants are one of the rare exceptions where d-bags will patronize a non-corporate, non-chain franchise establishment, for some reason), but you never know. Most of the customers seem to be Latinos, there's Mexican TV playing on the wall and the overall aesthetic of the place is low-budget taco stand, so it's probably intimidating to most of the white douches in Cabo set. It's also rather cramped, unless you eat outside.\\nBut I digress. The food so far is fantastic!\\nYou won't be disappointed!"},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great views, but the service was horrible.

So much so that two people sitting in a booth across from each other are literally invading the personal space of the other person across from them.  This was never a problem before the remodel, however managment decided to add thick foam padded bolsters to the backs of the wooden booths.  As a result of the size of these bolsters, one cannot lean back, but must sit bolt upright.  That means that ones body is not only thrust forward into the table, but into the face of their dining partners.  Making matters worse is that the villa has one booth that never gets used because the space between the bolsters and the table edge is so tight, even Olive Oyl couldn't fit,  that no one can fit in it.  But instead of removing it and respacing the other booth, it remains.  There are only a couple tables in the back of the dining floor, and those get used by large parties of six or more.\\n\\nI really would like to give the Villa a full five star rating.  We love it.  But the seating is beyond miserable, and there is no reason for this to be like this.  If they would just get rid of the back bolsters and allow patrons to sit in comfort, it would make the whole expirience so much better.  But until it does, the Villa gets FIVE stars for food and service and a force one star for the seating."},{"name":"Cheese Bar","address":"6031 SE Belmont","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The best way to my heart isn't with diamonds but through a block of cheese. \\n\\nGareth surprised me by taking me to a cheese sitting and tasting. \\n\\nThe tasting experience was really $$ at $11 per person for approx under 3 oz of cheese or less but worth it for the social factor. \\n\\nMy mood was slightly ruined in the beginning cause Gareth was too tired, stressed from driving and was generally grumpy that I felt bad for our host whom made so much effort in explaining the types of cheese and the flavour notes. We could both tell that he was on a different planet. \\n\\nMyself I was really into it. I am one of those annoying foodies that needs to take a picture of everything. I can tell that it was getting on Gareth's nerves. \\n\\nHe was a bit grumpy and I wasn't in the mood to call him out on it, therefore, left him alone to sort himself out and instead talked with the staff about record shops. I am not one of those girls who tries to change someone. If someone genuinely wants to hang than they'll smarten up on the grumpy otherwise I just immediately move on and talk to someone else. Life is too short and every second counts.\\n\\nIn all fairness the lady at the til was super awesome and helpful and awesome and even helped me select some take home cheese. \\n\\nThankfully the mood lightened up before dessert and a few toasts before then.\\n\\nThe selection of presented cheeses was amazing on our board but the star of the show goes to their amazing cheesecake made with Gina Marie Cream Cheese from Sierra NV. \\n\\nI've had a lot of cheesecake in my time and this is hands down the best I've ever had. Even Gareth admitted that it was the best that he's ever had. I had a foodgasm.

We were pleased to be seated immediately after entering. The place is pretty popular, but the restaurant is large. I've come here at least half a dozen times and I've never had to wait more than a couple minutes.\\n\\nI ordered a #13 (basically medium-sized beef pho with everything) and the fianc√©e got a #1 (wonton soup). The wonton soup portion size was extremely large - it's listed as an appetizer but it's pretty much entree-sized. The broth is very tasty, not too salty. In addition to the wontons, the soup had large pieces of chicken and some cabbage too. The pho was very large and looked fresh. The beef and broth were very tasty and not too salty either. The lychee shake seemed like it was made with preserved lychees instead of fresh lychees, but it was still tasty, not overly sweet, and it had a nice refreshing cooling effect, which went well with drinking the pho broth, since drinking pho broth alone always makes me feel too hot.\\n\\nOur food was served relatively quickly after we ordered, but there were problems with the timing of the lychee shake. I would have probably given 5 stars, except for a consistently frustrating experience with the service. This time, after we both had pretty much finished our food, my lychee shake still hadn't been served. I stopped a waitress walking by and asked about the lychee shake, and she just said \\"in a minute\\". Later, another waitress came to our table...with the check! It wasn't until I asked again about the lychee shake that she went to go get it! This wasn't an isolated incident either. Every time I come here I order a lychee shake with my pho, and almost every time they either forget it completely or don't bring it until after I'm done with my food.\\n\\nHowever, the bad service itself doesn't turn me off too much when weighted against the lack of waiting to be seated, the tasty food and the amazingly low prices, which is why I keep coming back."},{"name":"Flying Saucer Pizza Company","address":"118 Washington St","city":"Salem","stars":"4","text":"I'm sorry to say but this is the worst pizza i have ever tasted.

However, I don't think that their fried chicken necessarily lives up to the hype of this place. The coating isn't that thick and their chicken doesn't taste particularly high quality. It still tastes good, though I think there's much better fried chicken in Portland. Regardless, this is made up for the fact that their gravy is flavorful, that they don't skimp out on cheese, and that the richness of the egg ties everything together perfectly.

However, I found the curries themselves a touch unidimensional in flavour, especially the chicken kukhurako maasu, which I felt could have used more depth and richness. This curry seemed a bit thin.  \\n\\nThe khasiko maasu curry was better, helped by that characteristic 'twang' of the goat, which was very tender. The dish had a sort of consistent, dull, lingering heat, that I thought could have used some more texture or counter-balancing flavours.  \\n\\nWe also ordered the mango-yoghurt drink, but the server was too busy and never brought it to our table (but preemptively acknowledged the omission and removed the charge from our bill). \\n\\nOver all, the food at Kathmandu was good, and I want to like the place, with the cosy ambiance and super cheery server (who actually imitated goat sounds when confirming our order!) And while the place was busy around 7:30pm, tables were readily available again by 8:15. \\n\\nCaf√© Kathmandu gets three stars for now, but I'm looking forward to giving it another shot, if, for nothing else, those kothay dumplings, and to find out what that mango-yoghurt drink's all about. Plus, any server who imitates whatever animal's on the menu gets a thumbs up in my books."},{"name":"Moonies Burger House at Gracy Farms","address":"12001 Burnet Rd, Ste J","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Horrible experience!!

The broth was light and flavorful, and you could actually taste the food, unlike other soups I have had that are so overly salted or seasoned that you don't taste anything else.

The rosemary fries were also good.\\n\\nThere are a few things I don't like about this place.   It is too dimly lit which is quite noticeable when the days are short.  This honestly has to be the most dimly lit restaurant in Portland.   Also, they validate parking for 2.5 hours, I was a few minutes over 2.5 hours so they forced me to pay for an hour, $5 which is pricey compared to most parking ramps in Portland.   Lesson learned.   I guess it cancels out the happy hour prices, not the most annoying thing about this place. \\n\\nWhich brings me to the most annoying thing about this place....The clientele are disproportionately rude and entitled.   Here is an example from our last visit- when my friends and I got up to leave, another group of 4 started to scoot in to get our window table, this was fine as they asked 10 minutes earlier if they could get a heads up from us when we left as one of their friends had a birthday today.  Then a man in a table next to ours got up and attempted to block the group of 4 from sitting down and announced he \\"was elbowing his way in to the table\\" and would be sitting down at the table we were vacating.

The tattoo'd friendly bartender lady raved about the turkey and cheddar sandwich that simply was sort of unappealing with sliced green apples and too hard bread.  I also tried the meatloaf sandwich that also suffered from the same hard ciabatta bread. The meatloaf itself seemed cooked days before and reheated. It too was dry. Another observation was that a place seemingly priding itself on homemade pickles (weird sour taste) and scratch cooking would offer a bloody mary made simply with a bottled mix and no other additions. I'm not sure what the barrel in the name barrelhouse refers to - there are only a few beers on tap, maybe they are referring to whiskey barrels?

I read the reviews and pretended like they were just harsh critics. No harsh critics here, the reviews are spot-on. Austin has too many delicious breakfast places (Kerbey Lane!), don't waste your time here. There will be a wait, some lukewarm coffee, servers that don't care, dirty carpets, and sub par breakfast fare. \\n\\nWe ordered the love butter migas, some breakfast tacos, and pancakes. Everything was under-seasoned and both my husband and I commented separately on it. Salt was used in abundance. The salsa was a single note-spicy. No smoke, no salt, no sweet tomatoes - just plain spicy-odd. Also, if you are going to make a big deal out of this love butter, it better be good. This was simply scrambled eggs with some corn chips, hiding under a mountain of cheese. Where is this magical, spicy love butter? \\n\\nThe gingerbread pancake was the other extreme- way too gingerbread-y. As a gingerbread lover, even this surprised me. Our server brought the pancakes without syrup, and our coffee cups sat empty for far too long.  \\n\\nThe crowd was weird, which I can deal with for good food, but this didn't fall into that category. \\n\\nIn the land of delicious food, Magnolia better step up their game."},{"name":"Jam On Hawthorne","address":"2239 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I'll give this place 2 stars for the past food...but today they blew it....to start,my wife and I waited a solid hour to be sat.

Not to say it wasn't worth it, but very unexpected. \\n\\nI had the macadamia nut crusted chicken. The chicken was delicious and the sauce/veggies fit very well it. Sadly though, I couldn't taste any nuttiness from the chicken itself, and only from the actual nuts placed on the side. The kimchi on top was totally forgettable.  It was warm. \\n\\nSo in conclusion, if you're looking for happy hour prices, don't go with a reservation! Go early and seek out your spot because it was pretty busy around 5:30 when we went."},{"name":"Bondir Cambridge","address":"279A Broadway","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Initial Experience: It took us over 2 months to get a reservation.  We asked for a 3 top and were not accomodated.  That's ok, since our original reservation was only for 2.  However, from the moment we arrived until we exited the restaurant, there was ample seating and we could have been accomodated.\\n\\nAmbiance: Very nice, cosy and front of the house staff (with the exception of our waiter) were very hospitable.\\n\\nFood: The three breads as a starter is a nice touch.  Only one problem.  I am allergic to shellfish.  My mistake for not sharing that initially upon seating, but the menu did not specify ingredients and we had not ordered yet.  However, the waiter removed the bread and simply separated it from the others.  My fellow shellfish allergens will know - that's not good enough.  Instead of complaining, I simply skipped the bread.\\n\\nStarter: We ordered the sweet potato soup.  It was delicious.  However, for the price (and we are both foodies - my husband is an executive chef - so we understand this is upscale dining), we only received a 3-4 oz. portion.  Quite small for $12.\\n\\nMain Course: I ordered the duck.  It was only ok.  It was a suggestion of the waiter, which I almost always trust their judgement.  I figured a French restaurant would know duck.  It was cooked well, but lacked pizzazz and flavor.  My husband ordered the chestnut tart.  It was only ok, as well.  Nothing exciting.  Both portions were extremely small.  We did leave the restaurant hungry.  For the money, it was definitely a little disappointing.\\n\\nService: Our waiter was a bit snotty.  Never a good quality.  However, the rest of the staff was quite pleasant.  The owner greeted us personally prior to our meal.  We discussed how this was our first time dining at Bondir and we were very excited.  We chatted about other local French-influenced restaurants.  He agreed that he very much enjoyed the food at some of his competitors - a classy move on his part, so kudos to him for that.  I have respect for people who give honest opinions.\\n\\nDessert: Based on portions, we skipped dessert.  \\n\\nOverall: Bondir did not live up to the hype.  We may go back and give it a second try, as the menu changes daily.  But, we know now to have a big lunch prior to dinner.  That part is pretty sad, but we are hoping for an exciting second chance."},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Had a wonderful time and food was great.

For instance, you be offered a communal board game that allows you to learn about the history of art while you view a room.  In another room there may be a board where you can share and post your thoughts in an intriguing way.  It's nice.\\n\\nMy only qualm has to do with the cafe.  There used to be a nice restaurant / cafe setup near the center of the art museum that provided decent soups and foods, but most importantly, a place to meet with others, talk lightly, or study.  Now it's all been contained in this little side room with some refrigerated sandwiches and processed foods, which really takes away from the cadence of museum.

The oysters were very good, I liked how they had a little sheet with the explanations of each kind from each region and what to expect in the flavors.  I am a big oyster fan and was very pleased with every one that I tried.  The first disappointment was the amount of time it took for each dish to come out.  I felt like the service was a little slow, the waitresses and bartenders were all extremely nice and good at what they do, but the food preparation was slower than I would have expected.  The next disappointment was the scallops, I don't know what possessed the chef to think that dousing the plate with honey would be a good idea, because it simply is not.  The dish was far too sweet and lacking a bit of citrus or sourness.  I also had the lobster roll which was absolutely amazing.  The amount of lobster they include is awesome AND WORTH THE PRICE!  I will definitely come back here for the oysters and lobster, but maybe try and come earlier in the day to avoid a crowd. \\n\\nThe prices here are very reasonable, I don't get where people get off in saying it's too expensive, I mean have any of you who are complaining ever purchased and prepared a lobster from a grocery store?  They are expensive, difficult to deal with, and it is time consuming.  For $24 you get about 1-2 lobsters worth of meat perfectly prepared, anybody who thinks that is too expensive needs to stick to the McDonald's $1 menu because that seems to barely be within your budget."},{"name":"The Park on South Lamar","address":"4024 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Let me preface this by saying I am a former restaurant manager and food and beverage director for hotels.  I have been in the hospitality industry for almost 20 years. Four of us went there after driving by Pluckers but it was too crowded.  The Park was crowded but got sat immediately. No welcoming by the hostess.  The server we had never smiled or welcomed us.  Never asked if we had been there before or offered suggestions.. She needs to get a personality.  We ordered 6 wings along with our dinner.  NEVER  GOT THE WINGS!  This was even after we told the guy who brought our food that the server forgot the wings.  Burgers and the Parmesan Garlic Fries  were good.  My wife's drink was made incorrectly.  No apology by the server.  In fact she made the point to tell us that she watched the bartender make the second drink..  Not Good!  No management presence at all. Managers should be walking the dinning room and talking to tables about every 15 - 20 minutes.  Our waters were only refilled once.  A good server will refill drinks once they are half full. We asked for no tomatoes in our salad yet there they were.  Server never thanked us for coming in nor did the hostesses when we left. I realize Austin is a tough labor market for the service industry right now bu that doesn't excuse poor training by management.  It gets two stars because of the food.

The other highlight for us was Bricco Salumeria and Pasta Shoppe, where you try authentic olive oils from Italy, and different Balsamic Vinegars.  Plus the home made fresh mozzarella.  Next door was the bakery which was also a treat.  And if that was not enough, at the end of our tour we had a meal at Lucca.  My husband, son, and girlfriend, and myself enjoyed what we had chosen to eat there.  There were also other stops, and tastings in between.

This place hit a grand slam again! We started with the Peking duck, amazing. Literally the best I have had outside of Beijing since my trip in 2013. Also had the boneless rib appetizer, best Asian rib I have ever had period. And the final appetizer was the fried oyster. All 3 were just spectacular and a perfect start for the 8 of us diners. Then the jackpot... Twin lobsters for everyone!! They have several styles of preparation. 2 of us had the spicy, one had the garlic and butter, while the rest of us had the scallion and ginger. All were amazing the scallion and ginger is the real crowd pleaser. At $22 market price, this is the best deal on lobster I have seen anywhere in the world... And absolutely the best flavors with each preparation. The lobsters are not tiny. They tails and claws are large and supple. The lobster meat is sweet and fresh. I don't think I'll ever find a better prep, better flavor or better value on Asian lobster again in my life. This place would get 10 stars if Yelp would allow it... We will go back many many times.

The woman looked at us like we'd ruined her day and was just irritated the had to wait on us. She shuffled around behind the counter and then just stared at us. It wasn't immediately obvious where the menu board was, so we asked if she had a menu we could see - she grabbed two filthy laminated menu cards and handed them to us. You know, dirty like greasy and food bits stuck to it. We should have walked out at this point. I won't bore you with the play by play, but long story short ordering the food was painful with here, information had to be pulled from her and she just continued to be irritated. \\n\\nUpside is food came out quickly given there was noone else in the store ordering. We picked up sodas from the self help fountain which was also trashed with water and ice everywhere, wrappers and the like. Apparently babysitting her kid was keeping her from cleaning up.

How does that even happen? Again, the woman working was indignant about it, like, why would we  even WANT a knife.

Served over amazing mashed potatoes.  The other person had the Ga trout and she really liked it.  We ordered a bottle of wine when we first sat down - half way through our entrees we had to remind the server to bring the wine.  We also ordered a side of truffle mac and cheese for the table.

To be honest, I don't think my boyfriend liked the restaurant very much anymore due to the long wait - he personally didn't think it was worth it and it is definitely an expensive place to dine based on what you choose. I, on the other hand, think their lobster rolls are still the best in Boston. Their portion size is way larger than Pauli's, north end fish market, or any other spot I've been to for lobster rolls in boston and their lobster meat is huge and so fresh. Of course, the price is also higher - at $31-$32 a roll or whatever the market price is for that time. However, I actually think it's very worth it to come here for the lobster rolls because even other places such as Pauli's who give a much smaller portion would charge $19. Just $10 more dollars, and you get a magnificent roll. We had the cold mayo version and the hot butter version which were both amazing in their own ways. The oysters of course are fresh. The Uni toast however is a HUGE disappointment - i did not taste ANY Uni. It was just basically like... butter and cheese slabbed onto it. No wonder it was only $4. But even so, I felt jipped because I would have never ordered that had I known it was just buttery cheese on top of a toast. \\n\\nNow let's talk about the wait - the restaurant opens at 11:30am. When we got there at 11am already, the line was starting to wrap around the corner of the street. When it finally opened, the first wave went in and we had to put our names down and wait another hour. Because of that, my boyfriend and I went to Quincy Market to browse around. They called me, I missed it and literally called them 1 minute later. They said sure come back over- we took 10 minutes ish to walk over and found that our spot has been taken by another couple that was just before us which I guess was reasonable since they were probably waiting right at the restaurant. However, that caused us to wait another half an hour or so which was really frustrating. I remember coming to this place another time at 10:30 to wait for it to open and was able to be the first wave of customers to go in. So if you absolutely don't want to wait for more than an hour, maybe go at that time."},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"131 Clarendon St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"On our only morning in Boston, we trekked out from our hotel to this location of Flour Bakery & Cafe - just a 5-minute walk or so from Copley Square, so it was quite close. We ended up getting here late morning (11 AM), and it was still pretty crowded, but the crowds (at least those sitting at tables) started to thin out by the time we had gotten our food. The line may look a bit daunting, but it actually moves quite quickly; there are multiple people with tablets taking orders along the line. If you do order a sandwich, you'll end up waiting a little bit longer; we probably we were waiting a good 7-10 minutes after finding a seat for our sandwiches to be made. That said, the high ceilings make the space feel a lot larger, even though there isn't a ton of seating available.\\n\\nAs for the food, it was quite good. We ended up splitting a breakfast sandwich with bacon and a roasted chicken sandwich. The former was quite good, but it definitely seemed bigger than anticipated when we sat down and got it, in large part because the bun is pretty decently-sized. But it's definitely hearty, and I liked the addition of the tomato and the arugula - gave it a bit more of a 'healthy' feel, and the veggies are a nice, light touch to offset the heaviness of the bun and the cheddar. My wife's roasted chicken sandwich was quite good too, particularly with the generous helping of mashed avocado spread on the bread. While we didn't get one of the famed sticky buns, I did sample a chocolate chip cookie...not the best I've had, but it was a bit less sweet and more buttery than most others. It was an interesting change, and one that I wouldn't mind from time to time.\\n\\nI cane see why Flour is a pretty popular spot to visit in town, and I would come back again for a breakfast/brunch meal on the quick. They did have plenty of tasty-looking desserts in the display window, so I may need to save some more room for that next time!"},{"name":"Paddlefish Restaurant","address":"1670 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I went here a couple of weeks ago while visiting Orlando. Being from New England, I eat a lot of fresh, excellent sea food so I'm usually a little cautious when I get seafood in a landlocked area where Red Lobster seems to generally be acceptable to people.  That being said, the food here was better than I expected.  \\n\\nWe ordered the Lobster Corn Dogs for an app, which were pretty good.  For my entree, I had the catfish and a side of potatoes since \\"edamame succotash\\", while pretty tasty, is honestly not a real side as far as I'm concerned, especially considering the price of the entree.  My dinner-mate ordered the fish tacos.  She received a crab cake sandwich, which was promptly sent back because it's not what she ordered.  I had to ask twice for my side of potatoes.  I believe the server duplicated the order of the table next to us in the POS system since theirs was identical save for the sandwich rather than the tacos.  He proceeded to blame the kitchen (why do they always do that? I got you, kitchen people, I know it's not you) and we waited about 10 to 15 minutes for the correct order to arrive.   I then waited another 10 minutes for my piping hot potatoes to accompany my cold catfish (I waited for the other entree to arrive before I ate mine because I felt bad).  A manager did come by to apologize though and they automatically took about $30.00 off our check, which I appreciated not having to haggle to get removed.  I probably won't be back but honestly the setting is great and it's a beautiful, clean looking space with decent food so I'm sure they'll please most patrons just fine."},{"name":"Garrido's","address":"360 Nueces St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Best new patio in Austin.

This week, we had a few special occasions to celebrate and decided to check it out, knowing it is pretty pricey. The food was good, but it was WAY too expensive for what we got. Even planning for an expensive meal, we were a bit shocked. The first problem was that I had looked at the restaurant's menu on a Monday, when they serve a three-course rather than five-course menu. There was no indication on the menu page that the three-course option is only available on Monday (besides the title \\"Monday dinner\\" at the top - but they change their menu regularly, so I just thought it was a daily menu). I assumed we would be getting a $45 pre-fixe three-course menu for our Thursday reservation. However, when we arrived, we learned that we would be paying an extra $23 each for a 5-course menu. This was ok, but unexpected. \\n\\nWe had also contacted the restaurant asking if they could do a vegetarian menu, as we are both vegetarian. We were told they could - which is true, however the \\"vegetarian menu\\" is just the regular menu with the meat removed, offered for the SAME PRICE. The portions are already tiny, so it really felt like kind of a ripoff to have the most expensive component of the meal removed and still pay full price. The \\"main\\" course, which was a fish, was replaced by a mild-flavored squash and mushroom dish, but it was probably my least favorite part of the meal. \\n\\nOverall, the food was pretty tasty. There was sort of a kohlrabi salad (meat removed) to start, which was fresh but not amazing, then a very good parsnip dish followed by a very good pasta dish (meat removed), followed by the not-so-good, bland squash and mushroom dish. The dessert was probably my favorite part - it was an amazing semifreddo that just melted in your mouth. Overall, though, I would certainly not return to pay over $100 per person for such a small and relatively mediocre meal."},{"name":"Magnolia Cafe South","address":"1920 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"So Laura M. and I went to Magnolia this past weekend.

These biscuits are the most legit thing ever. For lack of a better description, its like Popeye's but better... thicker, butterier, denser.

I am not a fan of thick cut bacon, but this place has converted me. Perfectly crisp, even considering how thick it was. The fat content was perfect, giving that nice charred fat taste to the sandwich. There was also ample bacon, like 3 huge strips that allowed for bacon on each bite. The gravy was nice... creamy, a good amount of pepper, and the sausage used wasn't overly fatty, but this still had a distinct richness to it.\\n\\nFried Green Tomatoes - good crunchy cornmeal batter. The tomatoes are still firm and juicy. It comes with some awesome creamy Dill Ranch sauce (which isn't too dill-y, it was actually perfect). Protip - add their special sauce which is like a mild tabasco and now you have an amazing dip. \\n\\nThe food here sits heavy, and I felt sleepy afterwards.

The sides included your standard mashed potatoes, polenta, and fried bananas.  I don't really eat bananas, but my wife loved them.  I thought the polenta was very good, and the mashed potatoes were also tasty.  Still, they weren't the everything mashed potatoes from Fogo, so I was slightly jaded.

The first dish came after a while, the waitress almost threw it at our table.  We'd ordered shrimp rice noodles.  It was rather tasteless.\\n\\nThen came the very long wait for our second dish.

There were a lot of different (although similar) options.  I was glad that I was able to find several rolls that didn't have cucumber in them (my primary concern with a place that I couldn't order what I wanted was that I'd spend half my time there picking out cucumber from the rolls).  On the second pass, the unagi roll was very rubbery, and the sweet potato roll... well, it didn't taste right.  It tasted kind of like the potato was half-cooked.  It was rather chewy.  I imagine this is because it had been sitting out too long?  Not sure.  I guess the good news is that you can go back and get something else, but only if it's been replaced since you filled your plate.\\n\\nThe servers were super friendly and polite.  They have almost nothing to do but bring you drinks and, man, my water glass was never less than 3/4 full.  That was nice.  They're very eager to please.

I'd been to the recently closed Short North location twice - and experienced the worst service of my life both times - so perhaps I'm a little biased, but I cannot understand how this place consistently has a long wait. The food is nothing but sub par bar-food (your local Roosters does it better and cheaper). As far as the beer goes - it's generic and unimaginative. RAM is also the only restaurant I've been to that seems to have 20+ minute waits for TWO but 5-10 open tables.

I stayed here recently while traveling alone and I was told the hotel was sold out of rooms even though I had booked a week in advance, so they asked if it was possible to put me in their \\"bridal suite.\\" It sounded like an upgrade but it was not, I walked in to find a roll away bed in a salon setting where brides go to get ready, NOT sleep. I'm easy going so I said it was fine for one night but they needed to move me into a standard room the following day. \\nI ordered room service and had several people come into my room to bring me items that weren't prepared for me in the room. When I went to sleep the lights wouldn't turn off so then I spent another 30-45 min with hotel security working to take the lights out of the ceiling (which they could not do) to then realizing it would be easier for them to just tape over the lights with several pieces of electrical tape so at least some of the light was blocked.. I finally let the men out and said the dim lighting in the room was better than the bright lights and I shut the door to realize their was no secondary lock. Oh well, right? There had already been so many people in my room and they told me I was alone back in this suite away from other rooms so I could get a good nights sleep.\\nI woke up at 12:15AM and there was a man STARING AT ME STRAIGHT IN THE FACE!! I jumped up in bed when I recognized him and I was so shocked no words came out of my mouth, not even a scream. We looked at each other and immediately he ran out. All the motion censor lights from the long hallway came on and I sat up in bed wondering what just happened. I was terrified to call home and ask what to do because I couldn't think straight and I was 3400 miles away. I didn't want to call the front desk in fear that they'd send that man up and I didn't want to involve the police because the man didn't touch me. I stirred in my room in shock, replaying what happened and nothing added up. I was hoping the front desk would call to acknowledge someone had came and it was just a misunderstanding, I was safe. I was going to start my first day at my company's headquarters in the morning and was even more anxious and stressed out about the lack of sleep and time difference I was suffering. I blocked the door with the heavy chairs in the room and the table by the door to keep myself safe.\\n\\nIn the morning I tried to speak to the manager but they were unavailable so the front desk said they'd leave a message. I am a rewards member so I made sure they had my contact info. I told them I was upset and I wanted to know if the guy I saw in my room was the guy who came to fix my lights because I was 99.9% sure he was. I needed to know his intentions for why he would go into a room that required an access card to enter. I wanted them to tell me my thoughts were not true and nothing was ever going to happen to me. I told them to have someone call me ASAP and I exited with all my things. \\nI NEVER got a call that day. When I got to another hotel that was safe I called to speak to the manager and I couldn't get in touch. The front desk knew who I was and said they had me in the nicest suite in the hotel with a ton of amenities waiting for me. I was furious! They didn't care about my safety, they just cared about bribing me. I told them to have the manger call me because they needed to clarify who that guy who broke into my room was and why he was in my room past midnight. They claimed he was doing his nightly checks.. But why did he bypass the motion censors? Why didn't he see all the things from the moment he walked in the door (including the room service in the table right next to the door) that would tell him someone was in the room? Why wouldn't he walk in and let the door slam which would've woken me up? And why was he a few feet from my bed when I did wake up?! \\nI called the police to file a report. I reached out to the Hyatt corporation the day it happened but no word from them. It wasn't until I went to twitter that I got a response an hour later from them. How ridiculous has this world come to when you try to deal with things politely, politically and discrete but the only way someone will answer you is when you have a small army (twitter followers) behind you? I'm not backing down on this because I fear that even though I got incredibly lucky that night and I woke up before harm was done to me there is still someone potentially out there who is now smarter about breaking into a room and will harm someone else. I can't have that on my conscience. Nothing adds up with how that man was able to get into my room and how the hotel handled was absolutely ridiculous. The manager, Vincent Bucci, only emailed and called me after I posted on twitter and he even told me he was notified about the twitter posts.

I can tell you that at least the fish and gyros are done well here.  I had a two-piece perch combo.  The fish was fried to order, in cornmeal, and was fresh and tasty.  The fries with it were pretty good.  I also had a small Greek salad, which was pretty big, and pretty good.  Still hungry on a long day, I went back up for a gyro.

Yeah...can't call it service. It was just awful enough that I might not come back to eat here. I was VERY disappointed. Just so the owner/manager knows and can discuss this with his/her employees...I dropped in this past Sunday (3/30) between 4 & 5:00 in the afternoon. Those kids you had working there did not give two shits about...well...ANYTHING from what I could tell (except video games....they LOVE video games). Sad really, because if they had just given a single shit, this would probably be a 4 or 5 star review...but they did not....not even a little bitty one.\\n\\nMy wife and I have heard good things about Moonies Burgers and noticed they are pretty close to our house so, after a wonderful day swimming at Bull Creek, we decided to give this place a shot. We walked in...nothing. No greeting...nothing. The kid working was slumped over the cash register and just stared at us as we walked up. Slumped is the only word for what he was doing. He may as well have had a pillow and been napping. After we had been standing there for a minute or so MY WIFE GREETED HIM to break the awkwardness and he grunted some sort of inaudible response. OOOOOOOOOOOkay...don't mind us, we're just the people you are here to take care of.\\n\\nSo we studied the menu with no help from Captain Congeniality, came to a decision and ordered our food TO GO (I seriously said \\"to go\\" like 3 times). Paid and sat in one of the booths. Looking around I noticed some beer signs on the walls so I'm guessing they have beer on tap? Wouldn't know because nobody tried to sell me one. I probably woulda bit too since it was a nice warm day and I'd been in the sun for a few hours...but alas. \\n\\nWe sit there for, and I'm not even joking here, 30 minutes while Captain Congeniality and his sidekick are in the kitchen talking away and, I guess, cooking our and the guy who came after we did's food? They were laughing and having a grand ol' time while my 4 year old's patience withers away to nothing and he starts to get restless. I couldn't hear everything they were talking about (bits and pieces about some video game they both play) but couldn't help but think that if he would have spent 5% of the energy he was spending talking to his co-worker on us maybe we would have felt welcome there. \\n\\nSo yeah, 30 minutes after we order the sidekick brings us our trays of food (remember how I asked for it to be to go?). Apparently, none of the conversation they were having was work related because Capt. Congeniality did not pass along this little nugget. After we politely tell him we had asked for it to be to go, this kid...let's call him Too Cool For School Boy rolls his eyes, DOESN'T EVEN APOLOGIZE or say \\"whoops!\\" or ANYTHING, and goes back to the kitchen to slide everything into to go containers. I've had enough at this point so I grab my son and walk out the front door while my wife goes to retrieve our bags of food from TCFS Boy. She says \\"Sorry about the to go thing...thank you. Y'all have a good day!\\" and TCFS Boy says....nothing...NOTHING!!! Just unacceptable.\\n\\nI've been in the industry for a while now. I'm GM of a reputable pizzeria here in town. I know more than most that good employees are hard to come by. The ones who give a shit and carry around a sense of ownership while they are clocked in are really diamonds in the rough. The vast majority of employees are in the middle. They aren't shining stars and might be lazy now and again but will at least preform their duties while on the clock and put a smile on their faces, even if they don't want to be there. Then there are the bottom feeders. The ones who you hire in a pinch because you are short handed. They never shine...they don't even sparkle a bit. They are late frequently. Call in sick often and when they are there they do everything in their power to NOT WORK...to get through the day doing as little as possible and clock out exactly when they are scheduled to leave...no sticking around to help out, why would anyone do that?. Funny thing about the last example is...they are always the first ones to freak out if their paycheck is short an hour by accident. \\n\\nWhat I am going to say next is VERY uncharacteristic of me: The two kids who were manning this store...sorry CHILDing this store on this particular Sunday are more than likely of the latter group and, if it were my establishment, I would either suspend or terminate both of them immediately. I would  just work that shift myself  or pay a couple of my good to great employees some OT until I could find replacements. I guarantee you will see sales rise if you do. I never want to get an employee in trouble because I think people deserve a chance to fix their mistakes but these two were just SO nonchalant and took such poor care of us and your business that I can think of nothing else to say. They seriously almost ruined my afternoon.\\n\\nGood luck Moonies."},{"name":"Sushi Tsunami","address":"7415 NE Hwy 99","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"A bit on the pricier end for rotary sushi but it is made up for in the quality of the food.

Tom yum noodle soup that I thought would be as big as Vietnamese noodle soup, but wrong, it's so much bigger, the soup was spicy and sour, and im not a fan of spicy food, so I just ate little. My favorite dish was the coffee flavored beef, so tender and flavorful, I also paired it with coconut rice which was an excellent combination. I would get it again next time. Lastly, the durian pancake, was creamy and mouthwatering.

They looked at each other and their eyes lit up as they said together...\\"Queso!!\\". The wife was tasked with getting the queso and the husband headed to get the beer, which is a great combination on any day. As she walked up to the trailer she was getting very excited about the hot ooey goey mess she was planning on eating without any worry of all of those damn calories. She made some pleasantries with the staff at One Taco, ordered a couple of steak tacos, and then asked for the glorious queso. At that point the wife's heart broke into a million little non-queso having pieces... she was told they were all out. All out on a Friday afternoon she wondered, yes the employee confirmed, all out of chips and queso. Seriously, all out on a Friday afternoon???? Okay the wife though, at least I'll get chips and salsa. But those dreams were squashed as well... they were out of those too. \\n\\nThe wife and husband tried to drown their sorrows in the steak taco's but their disappointment of the lack of queso overpowered their entire experience.

Luckily, we didn't encounter any smokers walking down the street, that might have ruined the experience. The menu leaves a lot to the imagination, in that it does not provide descriptions of each dish (some have descriptions, others do not). I imagine someone who does not consider themselves a foodie might have some trouble deciphering the menu. Anyhow, we ordered the Bim Bop Bacon and eggs, and the a potato dish (I can't remember the name of). The coffee was good, the food was good. Personally, I felt that both dishes were very heavy, like lots of oils/fats were used in preparation..I'm not a fan of that (that's why I gave 3 stars).

I got the 3 enchilada entree last night, and instead of a cheese, got 2 beef and 1 chicken. And I hate refried beans, so they let me get black beans instead. For future reference, I should have gotten 2 chicken and 1 beef. Or even all chicken.... the chicken is really juicy and yummy, whereas the beef literally tastes the same as taco bell.

True, some limits are of our own making -- like keeping a consistent wake/sleep schedule for our little one -- but some are are obviously socially imposed. No, you won't find us frequenting chichi places, where our toddler might raise a few hairy eyeballs and side-eyes. We won't be THOSE people. \\n\\nBut, contrary to popular opinion, people with children do sometimes want to (nay deserve? to) eat at other places that have neither a ball pit nor a drive-thru and, call us greedy, might I add delicious as a criterion?

Variety is a bit limited and prices are a little higher than Island Creek.  The scallop entr√©e was very good.  Seared but still rare and served with sides that worked to accentuate the freshness of the scallops rather than overwhelm.  The lobster-roll on the other hand was underwhelming this time.

Ever.\\n\\nIt came out, and I immediately knew I wasn't going to finish it all. It's a behemoth of a sandwich that came with a mountain of tater tots and a squeeze bottle of maple syrup. Everything was cooked to perfection and tasted wonderful. I was even pleasantly surprised by the maple flavored mayonnaise. \\n\\nSo much so, that I actually got a side of it to dip the tots in. And that, my friends, is where the whole revolution comes into play. \\n\\nIf you ever find yourself at Jam On Hawthorne, you absolutely must get a side of the maple mayo to dip your tots in. IT WILL CHANGE YOUR WORLD!\\n\\nAlso, if you were wondering, tater tots that have been drizzled with maple syrup taste a lot like French toast sticks.

By the time I was eating, the restaurant began to fill with more costumers therefore Alex (the only employee on the floor) was a little busy. When it appeared he had a break, I signaled him to come to my table and he shockingly rolled his eyes and seemed annoyed that I asked for him. I was completely baffled. He approached my table with a forced smile and I nervously asked for one glass of orange juice and one glass of ice water. He returned with two glasses of orange juice. I told him we only wanted one orange juice. He apologized, took back the one and never came back with the water. I was so upset, I just wanted to leave. This guy was clearly in over his head and he didn't appear to have any prior server or customer service experience.

Instead of just seating my friend and I, allowing us to get a drink or perhaps a starter, I instead was told to continue to wait. At first, I thought I would just take it out of the tip, but that would just be punishing the server for some policy they have nothing to do with. I'm having a hard time wrapping my mind around who came up with the policy, it's incredibly pretentious especially for an establishment competing with stiff competition in the brunch market. It's almost like you didn't want my money, which is fine, the stepping stone was more than happy to accept it."},{"name":"Osteria Nino","address":"19 3rd Ave","city":"Burlington","stars":"3.5","text":"The atmosphere is pleasant and the restaurant is well-located.

Half a roll of shrimp half roll crab meat roll lobster meat 20$. Started with the crab was very good Jonah crab enjoyed it very much and I thought was a generous amount for a half a roll. The lobster again generous I thought was delicious. Not crazy about their special seasoning that they add will skip it next. The there was the shrimp. Tiny shrimp Not sure why I expected them to be larger but I did. But they didn't taste like shrimp and were a bit rubbery chewy I thought. Also the Bee ginger carbonated water unsweetened was very good. I would buy this in a market or store if I could find it. Overall yes I will return to Luke's however I will skip the shrimp and I will skip the special seasoning they use couldn't quite identify what it was just salty to me."},{"name":"Kamei Royale Japanese Restaurant","address":"1066 W Hastings","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"A friend (from out of town) and I came here when the place I hand intended to go to, turned out to be closed.

We ordered dumplings (acceptable though not fantastic) and tempura (very good).  We chose an entree we could share that included a nice selection.

After a couple calls, we finally ended up at J Alexander's, which is located in the same plaza as Wal-Mart and Olive Garden, among many other stores and restaurants.\\n\\nWe still had a 20 minute wait, but it was tolerable. The interior of the restaurant is dim and slightly romantic, so nice place for a casual (or upscale if you choose to make it so) date.\\n\\nI was here for a catch up girls night and we were impatient for food and drinks. Our server brought us water and took our orders, although not immediately. We both ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad without any alcoholic drinks.

The sweet wasabi and ginger gave it a true sushi feel, as well.\\n\\nWe noticed the next table over ordered deviled eggs, so we immediately copied them. An order comes with 6 of the most delectable deviled eggs ever. The candied bacon we topped ourselves with the sprigs of cilantro from the middle of the platter.

We made sure we were available for the reservation due to Disney's reservation cancellation policy which is slightly harsh as they charge you if you miss the reservation.In any event, we arrived on time (had a beer in the court yard) and there was a line of people in front of us who had not made reservations. When we finally spoke to the CM \\"Daniel\\" who was handling the reservations, he said the reservation essentially guaranteed we would sit within 15 minutes. So we got our beeper and stood about 6 feet away from Daniel and the other 5 cast members/waiters. ...AND we waited....and we waited. Finally after the two groups in line ahead of us were seated before us, I walked up to Daniel and said \\"We had a reservation for 5:45pm and it is now 6:20 pm, why are we still waiting?\\" He fumbled over his words and said he needed to call a manager. So we were finally seated, no apology, just an explanation that the beeper was probably broken.\\n I was mad as hell as their policy penalizes guests for being late, but when the shoe is on the other foot, no apology or penalty for Disney screw up.\\n\\nThose that know me would note that I am pretty even tempered, maybe even a  mellow person and I wasn't going to let it affect my meal, so I moved beyond the reservation issue.The meal was okay.

Neptune is located in the North End and is somewhat tricky to get to unless you live in the North End.  Parking, as with most places in the North End, is difficult. \\n\\nThe ambiance is nothing to write home about and the service is quick and lacking much personality.  Expect to wait a good while for your table.\\n\\nAs an Oyster Bar, Neptune is just okay.  They do offer a broad selection of oysters.  However, other restaurants such as B&G Oysters, Island Creek Oysters, and Oceanaire often offer a better selection.  The preparation and presentation of the oysters are standard... nothing special here.\\n\\nI found the clam chowder at Neptune to be ordinary.  Certainly, it hit the spot at the time but the memory was not a lasting one.\\n\\nThe lobster roll, which is often cited on Yelp as the marker of excellence at Neptune, was good.  Large juicy chunks of lobster delicately seasoned (but not overly so) with a nicely toasted bun made for a nice dinner.  Was it the best lobster roll I have ever had?  Not by a long-shot.  Still good though.\\n\\nOverall, considering the ambiance, bland service, and slightly better than average for Boston seafood, Neptune comes in at 3 stars.

They get confused looking at the menu board as to what to order and how much.  People generally  don't think of their food in pounds.  So when they read 1/4 lb, 1/2/ lb, etc., you really have to think about it. Ounces or photos showing the amount of meat you get might work better.

The tortilla chips were thin, crisp, and very appetizing, and the entrees some of the best Mexican food I ever had. I ordered the Lomo de Puerco, a pork tenderloin with pineapple guajillo salsa, which was a very rewarding combination. The pineapple's sweet-bitterness complimented the various sugars and spices in the sauce, going perfectly with the tender, but-not-pink pork.\\n\\nShe ordered the Enchiladas de Mole, and I think she may have been jealous of my dish. Blend of spices (pretty sure some cinnamon, brown sugar, and various chilis in there, maybe some nutmeg?) was artistically intriguing, although palatally confusing at times. Portions were very plentiful (no more room for dessert!).\\n\\nI guess the only oddity was the authentic Mexican pop music on the speakers- I had been to Mexico a few years ago and could identify a bunch of the songs from the radio. Authentic, yes, but the genre, a bit questionable.

I ordered the Korean Fried Chicken which has short grain rice, house kimchee (pickled cabbage and cucumbers) and eggs two ways topped with green onions. DO NOT SKIP OUT ON THIS DISH! At first you're skeptical because Korean?? Fried Chicken??? That's an odd combo but seriously, its to die for. According to our wonderful bartender, it was one of the most popular dishes. It was well marinated, very crunchy but also very moist inside. The egg is indeed sunny side so if that's not your preference you should tell the server when placing your order. The kimchee was very fresh and indeed spicy! The perfect spice for me in this dish. This portion is enough to make you full for sure! My boyfriend ordered the Pork Schnitzel that is sunny side up egg, ham, havarti and mustard braised cabbage.

Neptune Oyster was nice to give us a few more minutes since we were still on our way back which was a plus.\\n\\nMy friend bought 2 lobsters roll: one for him and one for me.\\n\\nThe lobster rolls weren't AS good as I expected for $27. I was really expecting the bread to be most toasty and it just threw me off completely. The lobster however was super delicious, warm, and buttery. It had the best combination! The fries were also delicious! Nothing mediocre for me besides that bread being too soft with the generous amount of lobster.\\n\\nKeep in mind that this place is super hard to bring groups because of how small the restaurant is. It was kinda funny watching couples' reactions when the hostess told them it'll be a 2 hour wait, or when a party of 6 was told it would be too long of a wait for them to come today sadly.\\n\\nSome of the customers who were just walking in were just asking our waitress about the wait and she had a really good composure about dealing with people's shock.

We ordered the spinach dip which tasted like someone got frozen spinach microwaved it and mixed it in a bowl with cheese. Sent that back to receive bruschetta. Nothing to brag about. I got a salad from their Italian night menu which was sad looking. Unfortunately, you can't put mixed greens in a cool bowl with hardly any toppings, color and a strange homemade dressing and call it an antipasto salad. Seriously though, I did really like that bowl. My cousin ordered a buffalo sandwich, I took a bite of the chicken, that was pretty tasty. They've at least got fried food down(insert slow clap here). There was hardly any sauce on the sandwich and no crumbled blue cheese. Maybe saving money, however this sandwich needs some flare. The fries were great, but if someone screwed up French fries I'd have some concerns as to why they were in the kitchen. This place could be so awesome for the local Conway folk, but it needs such a makeover.

No one wants to get rushed out of a restaurant. 20 minutes later still no table. 40 minutes, still no table, 60 minutes and they say they are setting our table. 75 minutes later we are finally seated, in an area that apparently has some electrical issues. The lights kept dimming to almost nothing throughout the entire meal. The waitress explained that someone must have hit a switch by mistake or something but we were in the dark for 1/2 of dinner. \\n\\nThe waitress came by to take our drink orders but no water. We asked a manager, who came by our table to see how we were doing, if waters were coming and he assured us they were. He never mentioned anything about or offered an apology for our extremely long wait time. No water appeared until we asked the waitress a third time. On to the meal. We were served our salads 1 1/2 hours after our reservation. I had a ceasar salad and it was okay but the bread that came with it was very good. Our dinners were served 1/2 hour after later. The meals were brought out by 3 or 4 different people at different times. One of them was the front desk host. I ordered the 1/2 slab of BBQ ribs which were decent but not as good as my brother- in- law can make in his Traeger. The coleslaw portion was huge, served warm and had a lot of mayo in it.  The fries were good. The other diners liked there meals alright but nothing to brag about. I do think that this restaurant is overpriced for the experience you receive.

No one, at anytime, offered or mentioned compensating us for the inconvenience of waiting for an hour and a 1/4 to be seated.

The omelete was pretty good, but I would have liked it more if it had more goat cheese. The home fries were just OK. I also tried their strawberry and banana pancakes and they were great! They bake the fruit right into them. Yum!\\n\\nThe second day we ate there I wanted to try their Crab Cake Benedict, but for the second time, they were out of crab cakes. Such a bummer! This definitely cost them a star, since it's a regular menu item and we were there shortly after they opened. I ended up trying their Costa Rican breakfast (fried eggs, black beans, salsa, sour cream and a side of home fries) and wasn't too impressed by it. I also tried one of their pumpkin pancakes and that was the highlight of my meal. I would try this place again.

Vindalho flew to the top of the charts for my favorite place to go in Portland and has pretty much stayed in first place since the second time I went back.  Here are a few reasons why:\\n\\n#1  The menu changes all the time.  Pretty much every time I have been there I have been able to try something new and it is always five stars.\\n#2  I love the vegetarian and vegan dishes that they have there.  I personally don't like or need a huge menu.  I would prefer a few solid choices.  Plus, where the menu changes all the time I have been able to try something different each time I have been there.  One other thing I love about the veggie options, when you ask the waitstaff they will tell you every ingredient that is in each dish which is hugely important for a veggie gal like myself.\\n#3  The fact that the menu is not the same ole Indian dishes that you can get at other places is one of the best reasons to head to Vindalho.  You can find traditional menus at any ole Indian place in any city around the world, don'y you think?  But, a menu that takes the bold spicy flavors of an Indian menu and creates their own seasonal menu?  Sign me up please!  \\n#4  I am a fan of ordering from the appetizer and side dish portion of the menu because they are chock full of veggie items and the portions are huge.  Oh, and very inexpensive.  Yes, the entrees are expensive but I have yet to even order one.  (oh, side note about the entree portion size.....yeah, they are huge, easily two meals)  Pretty much every time I go I order an appetizer, the saffron rice, whatever dal side dish they have, and some type of naan/chutney.  The cost of that pretty much equals an entree which is super cool.  I hate when restaurants charge an arm and a leg for appetizers and side dishes.  Oh, and my husband pretty much gets the pork vindalho every time and loves it.  (To be fair, the cost of the pork vindalho bugs him but he still keeps ordering it. )\\n#5  The chutneys are fantastic.  I am sure if you are a fan of Indian cuisine you have had the same ole stand chutneys at pretty much every place.  They bore me, I rarely touch them.  Now, what I do love are the seasonal chutneys from vindalho.  The flavors are bold and strong.  The ingredients are fresh and delicious.  I love them and am always looking forward to what new ones they may have when we visit Vindalho.  They are very inexpensive by the way, $3 each and I think you can get a three chutney sampler there also.\\n\\nThese are just a few of the reasons why I go to Vindalho quite often.  I could easily write five more without even having to think about why this is my favorite place in the city.  But the main reason is, I love the innovative menu.  I love how it changes all the time, I love the unique veggie options, I love the bold flavors, and I love the fact that it isn't the same ole Indian food that I have sampled in pretty much every city that I have lived in and visited around the world.  If you are looking for straight up 'traditional' Indian cuisine, Vindalho may not be the place you are looking for.  But, if you want a seasonal menu, unique innovative dishes, fun new vegetarian options, mixed with the flavors of Indian cuisine then you may love Vindalho as much as my husband and I do.  Pretty much every time we head over there within a few minutes of taking a bite of our food one of us starts saying 'I love this place' or 'this food is fantastic'.  \\n\\np.s.

Actually, I should specify, the burger was.  The appetizer we got (fries smothered in a blend of teriyaki, garlic, blue cheese, and buffalo sauce) was actually really really good.  The burger was definitely larger than life and worth taking a phone pic of.  But honestly, at the end of the day for me it's about the taste and not the shock value.  And you can't physically get a full bite of the burger to enjoy all of the toppings in a single bite, and even if you could the burger itself was very average tasting.  Could just be my taste but I couldn't taste much seasoning to it, and it was a little too greasy.  Tasted like something I could have made in my skillet at home and I'm not much of a cook.\\n\\nThis would be a good place to have a few beers and some app's, but only if there isn't much of a line, which I'm not sure is too often.  Otherwise, and I hate to say it because I was really looking forward to it and wanted to like it, but this place is really overrated in my opinion.  \\n\\nIf you want to go because you've heard so much about it and want to say you've been there then by all means check it out, but I'd stick with app's and beer and try a bite of your friends burger.

I went with a group of friends for dinner and we all ordered some crudo to share and our own entrees for dinner. I personally tried the salmon crudo which was good and the thin sauce that it came in was also delicious but all the crudo plates were small servings of thinly slice fish but I can say the fish did taste very fresh. Mostly everyone at the table got pasta dishes and were happy with how they tasted but were a little disappointed in the small servings. I personally got the chicken under a brick which comes with a generous amount of chicken. It was almost like a rotisserie chicken in that it was flavorful and juicy but the skin was a little more crisp which I liked. Also, they give you a basket of bread to start with olive oil which is always a plus! We also got some drinks, they have a great selection and we were all pretty happy with what we ordered. Overall, nothing too mind-blowing or life-changing but I would say it is pretty pricey for what you get (minus one star) but the atmosphere is pretty nice. Minus another star because the waiter refreshed our plates which we didn't ask for but it was a nice gesture however he ended up giving me dirty silverware (I'm usually not nitpicky but there was a hardened piece of what looked like cheese between the prongs of my fork!) and when I asked for a new one, he kind of made me feel weird for asking."},{"name":"Rose & Crown Dining Room","address":"1510 N Avenue Of The Stars","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We had a great dinner here a few months ago, and when we were lucky enough to return so soon, we decided we had to eat here again, if only for a snack.

Not only do they have unique flavors like orange-pistachio and lemon poppy seed, they have a savory one (The Crunchy Mister) and fritters. The unique doughnuts at other bakeries typically are way too sweet for me and the doughnut itself is just okay. However, the base doughnuts at Revolution are heavenly on their own...it's a sign that they are true bakers. They have traditional cake-style doughnuts, yeast doughnuts, as well as some vegan options. Of the cake-style doughnuts I always go for the Shredded Coconut and for the yeast-style I am a huge fan of the Orange Pistachio. When I go I ALWAYS must have the Crunchy Mister. It's a savory round filled with melted gruyere cheese and ham. It is honestly the best thing I have ever had in my life. The only thing I have been less than impressed with at Revolution is their Apple Fritter. However, since they are a doughnut place I will not hold it against them. \\n\\nRevolution also makes these amazing huge doughnut cakes that you can order. You can literally pick any of their icings/toppings and make your own combination. You can also pay an extra few dollars ($2-$5 i believe) to have an extra layer of icing in the middle. You just need to give them 24 hours notice (but earlier is better if possible) and they will have it ready for your pick-up. When I ordered one, I got raspberry icing with sprinkles and an inner layer of chocolate. It was so large that even with 15 people there were still left-overs! Surprisingly, the cake cost less than $30...extremely reasonable. \\n\\nWhether you are a doughnut connoisseur or just someone who loves doughnuts as much as I do, you will literally love everything you try at Revolution!"},{"name":"Efrain's of Boulder Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","address":"1630 63rd St, Ste 10","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Good traditional American Mexican food.

It is the sleeper on this menu as it was only presented as an a la carte item on the back. It comes out looking quite simple but the taste and texture are exceptional. As a native New Orleanian, I found the taste vaguely reminiscent of a beignet but there was also a lovely crunchy crisp around the edge. For $4, it is impossible to beat.

And I try my best not to get too excited when it comes to trying new places. And then try not to get too critical about what I get there. That's where comes in Ichiro Sushi.\\n\\nThis place would have evoked mixed emotions and reactions from me for a variety of reasons. But at the end of the day, it delivers when it comes to the sushi itself. On a Friday afternoon, I went there with a couple of other co workers for lunch. Sushi was on the agenda so we did not even bother looking at other items on the menu - like the terriyaki and other Japanese dishes.\\n\\nEverything we ordered was quite good. The sea food and the ingredients used to prepare the sushi was all fresh. We tried about 5 different rolls and a combo of nigiri and sashimi. Everything was good. I totally forgot to ask our waitress about soy rolls and realized it only when we got our last roll. Too bad. They do make rolls with soy paper as well as brown rice. Not a big one on brown rice rolls, I would have loved to try the soy paper rolls. She said the soy rolls were $2 extra and the brown rice rolls were $1.50 more. Oh well. Live and learn,\\n\\nMilton is a great town. And for the center to have just one Sushi place kind of works in favor of this business, although a bit surprising. Is this the best sushi place in the vicinity? I don't think so. Quincy really has a lot of amazing choices. And there are a few other things that possibly don't work in the favor of this place. Some of which are: It is in the middle of a very congested Milton downtown area where parking is a big, big challenge. The restaurant itself is quite small with not too many tables for guests. In fact, they don't even have their own bathroom but have an understanding with the Chinese restaurant next door for the guests to use the restrooms - a first for me. BUT - having said all that, the sushi was good. Not the best sushi I have ever had - for that I intend to fly down to Vegas - once every so many months. But given the choices available in this town, it is good enough.\\n\\nFinally, our waitress was really good. She was always around to check on us if we wanted anything or if we had any questions. They were quite busy with take out orders. I totally see the reason why. I feel so very lucky to have so many sushi options within short distance of where I work and where I live. Ichiro is definitely on that list."},{"name":"Roadworthy","address":"125 Washington St","city":"Dedham","stars":"5","text":"Saw the reviews were all five stars. Wanted to check it out.

I wanna spread the smoked trout, caviar and creme fraiche all over the cake, roll it up and eat it, but I dont, I use a fork. The cake is crispy, a little sweet and a little savory and the perfect accompaniment to the fish. It is in my eyes, absolutely perfectly constructed, thought out, and executed.

However, when they didn't offer to take my meal off the bill or offer any kind of reimbursement to dry clean the coat, I got quite...irate, you could say. Anyways, I marched right up to the pay counter after we received our non-marked down bill and explained that I would at least like to be reimbursed for dry-cleaning or have enough money taken off the bill to equal the costs I would incur. She threw a $5 bill at me from the register...okay? \\nSo I said, take these two amounts off the bill please. She nodded - so I thought she understood. We sent the bill up with the card and she charged the FULL amount onto my friends card! I marched right up and asked for the money back. We ended up getting the money off the bill as I wanted, but I still don't think even in the end that they understood the implications of what they did or why I wanted money off the bill. I basically had to force it upon them...pretty sad, however, like I said, I didn't expect much from them. \\nASIDE from this, I've never had negative experiences with Pho and I WILL go back.

Only downfall, the dry bread that's like crackers were too fragile. They were breaking off everywhere and I had crumbs all over me. It was messy. \\n-I also ordered Filet kabobs. Delicious! Filet was soft, tender, and flavorful. It was marinated in some type of Asian sweet sauce because I can really taste the sweetness. Almost like teriyaki, but not quite. There was onions, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, and, squash. Onions were spicy! All these were on top of Louisiana rice. \\n\\nService 5 stars\\n-My server was Kimbery.

Usually icecream snuffs it out. So I had taken a couple bites, and had it in my hand when I sat down at the bar inside tasty and Alder. It was too early for dinner(which starts at 5) so I was just going to order a drink and wait at the bar.

It was good and it was big, and it is really meant for two people.

Thye had some great selection of different burger types I wish I tried, as well as different appetizers. Although the appearance has a homey, not grungy, hole-in-the-wallish kind of look with posters and dollar bills and markers covering every square inch of space, the food is not what I would call cheap. The thurmanator was about 19 dollars, the normal burgers are 12, but I would totally sign off on it being worth the price. \\n\\nThe place seems to be a great local hang out around the bar, and gets packed every night. They do not take reservations, and get super busy even on weekdays starting around 6ish, so get there early if you do not want a wait. I hear the wait gets to be an over an hour at times.

I can't say that she doesn't have any taste since she married me, but chicken just isn't pork!\\n\\nGrand Champion may have expanded my horizons a bit.  Their brisket was wonderful and much better than their pork!  That may be because their pulled pork was only OK.  It was just too soft and mushy.  It needed some of the exterior bits chopped up and mixed in to give it better texture and flavor.  I wouldn't go back if they just had the pork.\\n\\nBut don't bother with the pork when you have such good brisket available.  They cut it well so that there was plenty of outside to go with the tender inside.  The result was a great balance between the tender and chewy and the smoky and beefy.\\n\\nThey have two sauces, Carolina tart and regular sweet.  Blending the two worked well.  Several sides are available and the slaw was quite good (a little vinegar would have improved it) and the collard greens were wonderful.\\n\\nNext time I have to try the baby back ribs.

First off, to everyone who is complaining about the price- if you want to eat lobster, you're going to have to pay more than fast food prices! Just had to get that out of the way right there. The price point of their lobster roll is in line with what I'd expect. I ordered a lobster roll and a small clam chowder. Seating is a premium, so I opted to eat at the bar table in the back. My meal was made fairly quickly after I ordered. For those complaining about the size, this is the correct portion of what a standard lobster roll looks like. I paired mine with chowder, but if you still are hungry you can order sides like chips to go with your meal. There is no filler in the lobster roll- it is not drenched in mayo or a ton of seasonings. It is made correctly. Would highly recommend coming back if I'm ever in town."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow.

We tried the Reggie and the Pine State Club - we probably could have ordered just one, but we're glad we got to try 4 different flavors (the club is 3 polenta cakes, each topped differently).  \\n\\nBefore you go, you should have some idea how it works: first, form a line inside or out.  The line actually moves along pretty quickly, so don't be intimidated if you see people lined up outside.   If you're in line and get to the door, get in or get out.  Please keep the door closed (at least, in winter).  \\n\\nGrab a menu while you're in line - when you get inside, you quickly get to the counter where you order, so knowing what you want will help move things along.  The counter staff was very sweet and helpful though, so if you have questions, I'm sure they'll be able to get the info you need.  And again, I cannot stress this enough - the food is amazing, so don't worry, you won't make an ordering mistake.  \\n\\nOnce you have ordered and paid, you'll self serve water or coffee as needed (near the register) and then find a place to sit.  We got there on a Sunday late morning so the place was packed, but we were able to get a table before our food found us and later saw the staff asking people lingering over their empty plates to move along for other diners, so no worries, you'll get a seat.  \\n\\nEat your amazing delicious food, bus your table and your trip to southern comfort is complete.  Walk it off in the fun Alberta Arts District afterward.  \\n\\nThis is a restaurant that you don't want to miss if you like good old fashioned southern cooking.

Next time, I'm getting a biscuit with veg gravy and some loaded hash browned potatoes.\\n\\n(Oh yeah, why only 4 stars and not 5 - personal preference: I like a place where I can linger over breakfast.

I'd much rather have a restaurant tell me that the wait is an hour from the get go. I've never had to wait significantly more than Neptune said I would.

You can order in bulk and they will deliver it to you on a pre-determined day and time."},{"name":"Vic's Bar-B-Que","address":"3502 Burleson Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Good old fashioned Texas BBQ. Great place. Great staff. Sweeeeeeet tea is definitely sweeeeeeet.

Normally I get the basil rolls and the grilled shrimp bun...i'm pretty predictable on that fact but I have also tried the curry chicken. Com consistently serves high-quality food and the atmosphere is much nicer than most pho joints. The service is a little slow though so make sure you factor that in if you are going there for lunch. If I'm in a hurry but still want pho, i just go down the street to Pho #1 which has much simpler cuisine but pretty much just as good."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Incredible food!! I've been trying to go here for a year but the wait is always upwards of 2-3 hours. I finally went one morning 10 minutes before they opened to get in line (yes, there was already a line!) But my brother and I got seated with the first rush. Possibly the best oysters I've had in Boston so far, and the staff is very nice and accommodating, once you finally get seated. If you ever have time to kill, I would say the wait is worth it."},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Stumbled upon this place looking for a lunch spot. It was AMAZING!  Simple concept, counter service. But, the lobster rolls are the best I've seen in the city. Actual chunks, perfectly seasoned, so delightful I wanted more. Clam chowder recommended too. Only wish they sold beer. But, probably for the better or we might never have left(;  Highly recommended!!"},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"131 Clarendon St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This city bakery offers excellent sticky buns and breakfast beverages.

The nightly DJ's are great, but it does get loud and sometimes require a cover. Wood bench seating is sleek... but not too sleek... and not particularly comfortable.\\nThe last time I went, I had the skirt steak, seared scallops and cauliflower+ brussels. All were amazing. I have never been disappointed with a drink off their menu. \\nGreat location."},{"name":"Which Wich","address":"804 Town Blvd, Ste A1035, Town Brookhaven","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"This is a cool concept, but laid out a little confusing. ARROWS on the FLOOR please, yes, I'm slow.\\n\\nSo, you walk in and your first inclination is to walk straight to the counter ahead of you. BUT RESIST. You should actually make an immediate right turn to the side wall of brown bags and menu items. This part, once you finally find your way to it, is actually really cool.\\n\\nYou look at the menu. You choose your \\"base\\" if you will, for example, turkey, or beef, or veggies... Or some other stuff. There are like 8 or 9 choices.. I'm not sure what the others are. I chose beef. So, you pick up the corresponding sammie bag #8 (I think) and choose the rest of your 'wich details right there on that bag with a sharpie!  What kind of bread? What size sandwich? Cheese? What kind? Veggies? How many? Condiments? Which? (Which WICH GET IT?!)\\n\\nThen, you decide if you want a milkshake (yes, of course, you want a milkshake!! Get the cookies and cream or the banana!!) and you pick up that card and check off your order. Do you also want chips or a cookie? Why not, we're on a roll here!  \\n\\nOnce you're done ordering up the whole place just because you want to check off boxes and play with Sharpies, you put your name on the bag and go up to the register. They confirm your order, and ring-a-ling you up. Then, they clip your little baggy and stuff to a wire, and slide it on down the line. Then you sit and wait for your name to be called.\\n\\nThis is the point where you would LIKE to say, \\"OHMIGOSH, that was SO FAST,\\" unless they FORGET about your order, which [wich] they did in my case. J.J.'s [other really fast sub place,] they are not. \\n\\nThey apologized and smiled though, so it's okay. Not mad atcha. I ordered a French Dip (which [wich], BTW, the girl at the register asked me if I wanted cheese.. and I said, no, it doesn't normally come with cheese, right? She was like, \\"I don't know what this sandwich is,\\" Okay funny girl behind the sandwich counter, but anyway,) I got it and it was okay. I have concluded that I have HIGH expectations for French Dips. You'd think it'd be easy to throw some beef on a bun and toss in a cup of salty-liquid. I'm very picky, I guess, or no one does it right. The au jus was not terrible, but had a bit of a tang to it that I could live without. I still dipped occasionally though. I think if I you want to try it, I'd recommend ordering double meat. Because. The bread seemed kinda empty. And. Meat. X2.\\n\\nThe banana milkshake was good (and neon yellow??) but the cookies and cream milkshake was BETTER. Not too thick to drink through a straw. I also got to eat a bit of the Beef Cheesesteak (with red and green peppers - orderer's weird choice) and it was really good. \\n\\nI'd definitely go back and pick a different sandwich next time. This place has potential to be a \\"Go To\\" spot for casual lunch or dinner."},{"name":"The Wing Bar","address":"494 Flat Shoals Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Very polite and the food was delicious!

They are extremely rude and pretentious. I've been in there multiple times and every time I get a rude cashier who seems like the hate their job and would rather do anything else than take an order. It's a cafe, if you don't want to be here that early don't work at a cafe. You order your food and the employee acts like you're inconveniencing them.
