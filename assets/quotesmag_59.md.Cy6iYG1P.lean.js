He walked away and offered no compensation for the horrible experience.

I can see why on a Sumday at 5 there were no more than 10 people in the restaurant when all others in the area had a wait. My mistake was trusting the chain name and not specific review for this one.   This was my worst experience at Carrabas and my absolute worst custumer service from a manager who had no control over his kitchen and felt insulted when we said as much.

On \\"The Drag\\" close to the UT-Austin campus, I would expect them to cater more to college student budgets (although the place was packed with young people whom I assumed most were indeed students).

A friend suggested Vino Venue because she had been a few times before.  There would be 5 of us for a Friday night get together so we made a reservation. \\n\\nWe got there in on time and because of the rez, we sat immediately at a beach right high-top near the bar.  The server took our drink orders and even let me try the Reisling before I ordered it. \\n\\nAfter everyone was ready, we ordered.  I ordered the Grilled Cheese with fries and my sister ordered the Ratatouille with pasta and veggies.  We always share our entrees.\\n\\nThe food came and I was surprised to see three slices of bread on the grilled cheese- it seemed more like a club sammy instead.  Who wants an extra slice of bread when the cheese should be the star of the show?  ain't any case, I gave it a chance.  One bite and I took out the center extra piece of bread, as it was a mouth full.  The bread was actually a big soft even though it looked like it had been grilled and was charred on the outside.  The cheese inside was half melted and didn't 'string' or ooze when I took a bite, like it had congealed and cooled quickly after leaving the kitchen.  Needless to say, I was not impressed.  My sister thad half the sammy and agreed with me.  However, the fries were yummy.  \\n\\nThe ratatouille (not pictured) was basic, something my sister could have easily made at home (which she has before).  It was nothing to write home about.  I did like the addition on wide pasta noodles, but who can say for sure if they were homemade.\\n\\nOn a side note, not pictured in this review, the toasted ravioli was almost inedible.  It was ordered by one of the girls at the table and after a eating one, she pawned the rest off on us to finish.  They were a weird texture and the seam of the ravioli pocket was tough and undercooked.  \\n\\nWhile I enjoyed the time with my friends, I would avoid the food on my next visit.

I had never done Dim Sum before and had been dying to do this in China Town so when I found out there was a China Pearl up the road in Woburn we had to go check it out. If you are from the North Shore this is very convenient. It's right near the intersection of Route's 128 and 93.\\n\\nIt's a huge place with plenty of parking and the fact that everyone in the parking lot (nearly) was Chinese immediately gave me a good feeling. The lot was packed!  Although the restaurant was very crowded we were a group of 8 and had a reservation. The table was ready and waiting and be warned, on a weekend if you have less than 8 they won't give you a res. and you may have to wait a little.\\n\\nThe servers immediately swarmed our table with little carts of steaming food NONE of which I recognized. I just started taking one of everything. Many many different dumplings arrived. They had shrimp, beef, pork, something green......   I took anything that had seafood in it. We got soup, giant whole shrimp which were awesome and clams in black bean sauce which were aslo very good. Some of the dumplings were good and some were not.  The kids wanted spare ribs and it took way too long to get some.\\n\\nThe service is sporadic. You have your main waiter or waitress but they aren't always around so if you want water or something special you have to get proactive and grab someone (maybe in a headlock) to get what you need.  But the trays keep coming and if you are brave and have some cash trying new things can be fun. Almost everything got eaten and compared to going out for say, sushi this is relatively cheap. Although I would far prefer sushi. \\n\\nI think if I do this again I want someone with me who is very familiar with the food and can order for me. It was a fun experience which takes a distance second or third after lobsters, steak, sushi and regular Chinese.\\n\\nThe place was huge, clean, easy to get to, and just as good at what's in China Town I would imagine.

The Carnita Verde features slow-cooked pork that is seasoned perfectly with a hint of cinnamon that gives it a unique, complex flavor; it's no ordinary pork taco. The Lobster taco has succulent, fried pieces of lobster topped with a creamy home-made thousand island sauce that has a kick to it. I was a little skeptical when I saw Lobster on the menu, but I promise you, it's a home-run. Finally, the fried plantain taco is unbelievable. I've never had anything like it.

So, I order myself a Cha-Shu Bao as an appetizer. The bao came out room temperature/cold. The bao itself wasn't even warm, the cha-shu was slightly warmer. The over taste wasn't really great. Tasted like someone's first try at one. I have had so much better at a Asian food court for cheaper. My main course was a Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen. It was NOT spicy at all, and I don't mean it wasn't spicy to my liking...no, I mean there was no spicy to it. Let me emphasis, an extra dollar for Spicy instead of regular and it wasn't spicy. Broth taste was okay; could have done with more flavor. Cha-shu was super thinly sliced, so you don't get much. Lastly for dessert I ordered fried ice cream because it is hard to find a place that has this on its menu by these days and I haven't had it in awhile. So, the point of fried ice cream is to have a hot dough outside and cold ice cream center. The dough was cold when it came out to me. They did have a good amount of ice cream, so I will give them that.\\n\\nI didn't want to complain about this while I was there, was just hungry after a long day of travel and want to eat and leave. I did leave a note on my receipt so they would know though.\\n\\nWould I eat here again... No. I have had better places at home in New York and Philadelphia. Actually, my mother who cooks mainly Chinese and Vietnamese food in our house makes a more flavorful ramen brother and bao than this place does."},{"name":"Tasca Restaurant","address":"1612 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"Llegu√© a Boston por primera vez en un d√≠a lluvioso y con mucho hambre.

It's not at all fancy enough to actually be that special, but it's the sort of place that would seem really fancy to an eight-year-old, what with the big steaks, the bread, salad, and sides.  \\n\\nJaded as i am, though, i walked in and noticed that i was, at the time, probably the youngest person there by twenty years.   Although i did enjoy the eighties-state-of-the-art decor (it's not tacky, just dated).  The waiter was a little odd, in that the intent is for them to have nice uniforms, but his was rolled up and unbuttoned in a way that seemed a bit sketchy.  \\n\\nAll the food came quickly, and was decent.  i had southern-fried pork chops in gravy, which were tasty, although the gravy was not decisively different from something that comes in a jar.  My friends' steaks looked to be accurately cooked and they both gave them passing marks.  Beer selection is adequate and nothing more (Harpoon, Sam, and crap).  For steak, it seemed quite inexpensive; cheaper than chain places like the dreaded Outback or Bugaboo Creek with much more generous portions.  \\n\\nThe only real complaint i'd have was that the waiter seemed flummoxed when we ordered a second round of beer, and preemptively chased us with the check nearly immediately after bringing them.

We were here last night for my girlfriend's Mom's birthday, there were five of us and we had called ahead for seating.  My girlfriend and I arrived slightly before the rest of our party.  The hostesses gave us a buzzer and said let us know when they arrive. I noticed instantly the decor certainly does give you that feel of the South, but the entrance way is extremely small and gets jammed.  There are some seating areas to the right when you arrive, but for a weekend, not nearly enough and it gets overwhelming in that area.  It was about five minutes later, sure enough, Hostess sat us right down.  \\n  We sat for a just few minutes and our server (Steph) was over.  She very polite, knowledgeable and took our appetizer and drink orders.  We ordered the barbecue boneless wings, I have had better.  Frankly, they were slightly cold, on the small side and a tad bland, they were just OK.  Of course we had buckets of bread, honestly, I could go here just for the bread, that gets an A.  We got our main courses in a very timely manner, which for a Friday night at 6:30 is pretty good.  Anyway, I had the chicken and ribs with mashed.  The mashed potatoes were pretty sad, cold and little taste.  The chicken was cooked nicely but also seemed bland, the sauce just seemed average, almost like it was an after thought.  My ribs were OK.  Frankly, I think they were a bit overcooked but they were OK.  My girlfriend ordered the roadkill (just a burger with cheese but no roll) and based on the presentation, I thought it was road kill.  However, she said it was tasty, so I take her word on it.  Her Brother ordered country fried chicken, it looked pretty pathetic in my opinion, looked very dry and he didn't finish it, but took it home, so either he has no food at home or it had to be better than it actually looked.  The other two members of our party didn't mention anything about their food, so take that for what's it worth.

I asked the girl what type of coffee they served she murmured the brand on the coffee cup. I said, ok that's fine. I asked for half decaf half regular. Y'all I'm getting old and can't handle that caffeine after 3pm. I also asked for a glass of the Cabernet Sauvignon that was marked as an option on the chalkboard. She stared at me blankly for a second and I asked again, what is your Cabernet Sauvignon? She walked over to the fridge door and said we only have (blah blah blah) none of which was the Cab Sav. I said, ok I'll take the Kirkland brand prosecco. Nothing against Costco...but it was a little awkward. The barista girl asked about my latte...huh? I didn't order I latte. I would like a half decaf/reg coffee. She walked over to the coffee pot, picked it up, shook it and said it's empty we don't have anymore. We don't make any after a certain time because it would go to waste...well not totally to waste girlfriend because I would have had at least 12oz. But I guess my business isn't worth it.

However, when we got there and were ready to pay, the server who helped us was so rude! He asked why we were paying separately and that next time, one person should pay while the rest just give that person cash. He was hurrying us the whole time because there was a bit of a lunch rush and I guess paying for our food was keeping him from helping other customers but we were paying customers too! At least we were trying! On the last payment, there was a problem with the card and he then says \\"C'mon guys!

What I didn't love about this place is the crowd. It was packed with kids on laptops. Most of them were alone, taking up entire 4-tops. We couldn't find anywhere to sit, and awkwardly stood with our coffees (that were in ceramic mugs) and our plate of biscotti. There was barely any table turnover for the time we stood there. Eventually somebody vacated a table and I sprinted toward it to claim it!

My experience with the host staff at Thorton's Fenway Grille recently was incredibly disappointing.\\n\\nI arrived with my niece and was greeted by two hostesses. We requested a table for two indoors (vs. outdoors as it was rather chilly). While there were no two person settings available inside, there were numerous 4 person tables open indoors. \\n\\nThe hostess stated that we could sit outside at a four person table, or wait 25 minutes for a two person table to open up inside. I asked politely, what difference did it make if we sat outside or inside if the seating setting was 4 person at both. The response I received was curt, bordering on rude; \\"Sit outside or wait 25 minutes. That's your only choice.\\"\\n\\nBecause we were headed for the Red Sox game, and our time was limited, we reluctantly agreed to sit outside. Imagine my frustration as I subsequently watched the hostess inside seat several two person parties at 4-top tables as we sat outside shivering....\\n\\nI understand that hostesses have a difficult job accommodating every patron. Given that there were over a half dozen tables available inside the restaurant however, I failed to see why such a simple request as eating inside - was so challenging to fulfill. In this instance however, the hostess was not only unwilling, but mean spirited in her decision to not honor a simple request.\\n\\nAs a season ticket holder for the Boston Red Sox, I have been a loyal patron of Thorton's for over 8 years and was thrilled that they reopened their doors after the fire. This experience however, has caused me to question the management's ability to hire quality, customer-oriented, friendly staff. I cannot imagine what was going through the mind of the hostess when she decided that rudeness was the only course of action in treating a patron of Thorton's Fenway restaurant, but I do know this; I will likely never return again."},{"name":"Five Guys","address":"3208 B Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"We decided to stop by last week for a midweek lunch.  \\n\\nLove the peanuts to keep you entertained while you wait for your food.

So, I thought I would give it a try today because it's Ramen Noodle Day.  However, nothing to indicate that at Afuri.  I do like its location right by Voodoo Donuts downtown and there are few cool food carts and Afuri is right next to a SuBe which looks to be a very hip evening sushi restaurant.  The decor to Afuri is great.  Lots of community tables and some bar seating and looks to have outdoor seating in nice weather.  I liked the semi modern farmhouse tables with white and black decor.  Plus, pretty much an open kitchen feel so you can see what is going on and lots of ingredients piled up so you know they are making food fresh.  You order at the counter and the counter person was very helpful with the ramen selections.  Very friendly and welcoming.  Always a good start.  After you order, they give you a big wood block number and that's how the server finds you.  So, I go and put down the block number on a table, with my receipt and turn around to take about 4 steps to the water station.  As I turn around, probably about 15 seconds a server and has swiped my number and receipt and is walking away.  I stopped him and said I had just put that down and was expecting my food.  His response, kind of garbled, was \\"oh, thought the person had left\\"  and he's standing there crumbling my receipt.  He then proceeds to put the number back on the table, and grunts \\"do you want your receipt\\" where he dumps on table on crumbled in a ball.  WTF.  Seriously.  I ordered the yuzo shio ramen, one of their most popular I'm told and a side of kimchi.  The kimchi came out pretty quickly and I would say good size portion for $3.00.  The kimchi was good but nothing special and I have a feeling they don't make it on the premises.  I love kimchi and my favorite brand is Choi's which is made locally here in PDX.  They are booth at the PSU farmer's market and lots of variation with seasonal specials.  The ramen was delivered in what I would consider not a great size portion for $13.00.  Usually, when you think of ramen it's in a big heaping bowl but this was not, and you probably won't be taking any leftovers home.  However, they do bring you a ladle as a spoon which is very helpful in eating and slurping up the broth with noodles.  It was okay - temperature was good and noodles were great but the broth was just okay and the piece of pork in my dish was not appetizing to say the least.  All in all it was okay.  I would go back but probably for dumplings or gyoza and skip the ramen.

It's part of Fifth Group Restaurants. I never really gave Lure much thought until Atlanta Hawks head coach Mike Budenholzer was put on the spot during a radio interview and was asked what his favorite restaurants in the city were. One of the restaurants he named was Lure.\\n\\nWhen it comes to seafood restaurants in Midtown and Westside, The Optimist and Six Feet Under come to mind. Lure is firmly planted in between those two in terms of food, service, and ambiance. The restaurant is nice enough to where you can dress up and celebrate a special occasion, but also casual enough for a laid back, low key dinner with friends. When the restaurant and bar get busy, this place can get loud.\\n\\nComplimentary valet parking is available in a small driveway next to the restaurant.\\n\\nThe building and furniture consist a lot of wood, reminiscent of an oceanside restaurant you might come upon in a fishing village. The nautical-looking light fixtures and exposed bulbs at the bar look like they've come off from a ship or some docks. It looks good. Seating consists mostly of wooden tables, though there is a banquette installed on the far end of the dining room, next to a wide display window that looks into the bright kitchen. Enclosed patio seating is available too.\\n\\nThe ever-changing menu features seafood of all types prepared in various fashion such as raw oysters, tuna crudo, assorted house-cured and smoked fish, trout pate, steamed mussels, grilled octopus, Ipswich clams (soft-shell clams), monkfish, Georges Bank sea scallops, salmon, Louisiana catfish, fish stew, and more. Two of the popular fish here are the Bramlett Farms whole trout and the pan-fried lemon sole, the latter of which I've been told has been a fixture on the menu since the restaurant's opening.\\n\\nThere's a decent selection of both shareable plates, if you want to dine family-style, and single-serving entrees. Expect to spend roughly $10-20 per plate during brunch/lunch and $15-30 during dinner. Like other seafood restaurants, oyster selection can vary daily. Oysters can cost anywhere from $2-5 each depending on type. Be sure to ask for complimentary H&F bread and butter - it doesn't come standard and must be requested.\\n\\nI've tried:\\n\\nOysters:\\n* Pocomoke River - Chesapeake Bay, Maryland\\n* Wild Tisbury - Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts\\n* Snow Creek - Discovery Bay, Washington\\n* Wild Seaside - Chesapeake Bay, Virginia\\n* Chunu - Chesapeake Bay, Virginia\\n\\n\\nPlates, Soup/Salad, Sides:\\n* Rainbow Trout Pate with creme fraiche and dijon, served with baguette toast.\\n* Lure's Clam Chowder - New England-style with bacon, oyster crackers, and chives\\n* Steamed Mussels - Fresno chilis, garlic, tarragon, butter\\n* Grilled Octopus and Pork Lettuce Wraps - mixed herbs and spicy Vietnamese sauce\\n* Confit Potatoes with creme fraiche\\n* Yellowfin Tuna Crudo - smoked chili oil, grapefruit, gomashio\\n\\nThe oysters are superb. I suggest ordering one of every kind on the menu. The Snow Creek and Chunu oysters are rather small, but pack a flavorful, briny punch (particularly the Chunu). The large and plump Wild Seaside oysters are magnificent. The Pocomoke oysters are refreshing and melony. All the oysters are fresh and succulent.\\n\\nMild in flavor, the Rainbow Trout Pate is delicate and fluffy, almost wispy. I believe the toasted and crunchy baguette slices have been slightly buttered. This plate also comes with some shredded pickled red veggies, a perfect tart accompaniment to the savory spread.\\n\\nThe broth in Lure's Clam Chowder is among the thinnest, lightest I've tried of any clam chowder. Normally, I expect a thicker, richer soup, but Lure's version works out fine. It's appetizing and I like the inclusion of bacon and how crackers are already thrown in so we don't have to do it ourselves.\\n\\nThe Steamed Mussels are OK. This dish is best shared among 3-4 people and it can get messy. The mussels range in size and flavor from small to large and bad to great. The Fresno peppers are very similar to jalapeno peppers.\\n\\nThe Grilled Octopus and Pork Lettuce Wraps, another commonly ordered item, are just alright for me. The portion size for the octopus is small especially when compared to all the strips of pork. The pork is a bit dry. The way this dish is served reminds me of Mexican fajitas. The herbs (mint) are served atop room temperature noodles with a side of what I believe is Vietnamese nuoc mam (fish sauce) mixed with a lot of lime juice.\\n\\nThe Confit Potatoes are tasty and filling. The amount of creme fraiche is sufficient, but it would be nice if there was a tad more. This side is ideal for at least 2-3 people.\\n\\nThe Yellowfin Tuna Crudo is terrific. The slices of tuna are fresh, soft, and supple. They almost melt in your mouth. The Japanese gomashio seasoning, which is a type of toasted sesame salt, has a distinct, addictive flavor. Along with the oysters, this crudo is one of my favorites at Lure.\\n\\nService is excellent."},{"name":"Hofbrauhaus Columbus","address":"800 Goodale Blvd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"We used to LOVE, LOVE going here, either as a couple or with a large group of friends.

I have been here for an Italian Wine Dinner/Cooking class as well as most recently dining out during the Dunwoody Restaurant week.  While I do enjoy the wine options and the overall experience at Venue, the food has never lived up to my expectations or my dining companions.  The food screams for seasoning and as a lot of restaurants choose to do, they do not provide salt and pepper automatically on the table.  I completely understand that because it can be an insult to the chef when diners grab for it without trying the food.  That is one of my biggest pet peeves when I cook!  Taste it first before you grab the S&P but I think the chef might want to taste more before the food leaves the kitchen.  During my last experience my Dinner choice was the Braised Beef Bistro Filet with Honey Soy Pinot Grigio jus with Potato Leek Waffles.  How great does that sound??!  Unfortunately an overcooked attempt at the Bistro Filet and the soggy Waffles even with the jus fell flat!  I kept trying to pawn it off to my dinner companions who didn't seem to enjoy it either.

This was probably the most nicely plated jelly pork I've seen (my standards aren't high), and I really like the soft gelatin-y portion of the rectangular prism.  (No, they're not cubes.)\\n\\nThe mouth watering chicken was alright.  I didn't enjoy it as much as the one at The Place, since this one had much less peppercorn and sesame oil.  The xiaolongbaos were pretty good and juicy, though I found the skin a bit thicker than I would have liked.  Size-wise they were good though.\\n\\nThe wild vegetable with pine nuts, a traditional Shanghainese dish, was fairly neglected throughout the dinner.  It was a bit boring compared to the other dishes, but in fact wasn't that bad.  We also had the jellyfish \\"head\\", which is what it would be called in Chinese.  This part of the jellyfish has what seems like cartilage and doesn't have that nice crunch the long thin strands has.  I don't enjoy it as much as the cheaper variation.\\n\\nThe shredded pork with steamed pancakes was good, and I'm generally a fan of most things with this type of thin crepe-like wrap.  It had the right amount of dou ban sauce and wasn't overly salty.\\n\\nI wasn't a fan of the beef rolls -- it reminded me of the ones from Long's Noodle House since they both have a similar wrap.  I much prefer the one from Peaceful Restaurant, with it's flaky pancake instead.\\n\\nThe fried fish in sweet and sour sauce was definitely a highlight, and we were all pleasantly surprised.  The fish seemed quite fresh and was quite nicely fried.  It had a very good crisp exterior, and the sauce reminded me of what we usually have at home -- just the right amount of sweet and sour.  The pineapples weren't cooked either. Perfect! I hate it when they overcook pineapples.\\n\\nOf course, with a Shanghainese meal, we had to have rice cakes.  This was done \\"Shanghainese-style\\" with a soy sauce base, not dissimilar to that of the stir fried thick noodles in Shanghainese-style next to it.  I preferred the chewy rice cakes, since they're one of my favourite types of carbs, but I didn't find the two dishes to be all that special.\\n\\nI was glad we ordered the ham and duck soup since it was quite different from any other soups I've had before.  Chunks of taro gave the soup a slightly beigey-grey tinge, and the taro pieces were actually quite soft.  I couldn't finish more than one though since the soup was served at the end of the meal.  The ham gave the soup a nice kick of flavour, and I couldn't help myself to seconds.\\n\\nI enjoyed the meal at Shanghai Elan and found it a nice change to the typical ChineseBites dinners.  Most of the dishes were quite standard, but several ones, including the jelly pork, fish, and soup, were really quite well done."},{"name":"Continental","address":"266 Broadway","city":"Saugus","stars":"3","text":"first time back in 10 years listened to seating lady saying its to much for one person, and walked away two ppl behind desk laughed about her. she came back marked in a book walked away again 1 min later returned asked how many 2 follow me 1st table on right next to entrance, so much for showing off the place in my jacket and tie date, baked seafoo smalest portions i have ever seen. not happy. the prime rib my date got well she has never said a peep in the last 20 or so times out she just enjoys, not this time i looked at it she took it to go 4 her dogs. not impressed with the whole deal there, old burnt in middle baked potato almost forgot such a nice place waiter had to many tables he was over burdened"},{"name":"Lombard's Seafood Grille","address":"6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"It was actually not bad considering what one would expect at an amusement park.

A regular Coke with ice. I wasn't aware that was a complex request considering some of the concoctions they have listed on the cocktail menu. When I tried to confirm my order with the bartender, she just sort of glared at me. I know they were busy, but how big of a deal is it to dump out the ice & make sure you gave me what I ordered?

I'm not sure what they were going for with that one, but all it did was annoy me.\\n\\nThe food turned out to be better than I thought it would be.

The service is a gamble.  The first time we visited, our service was okay, but last night it was atrocious. Let's start with the rolls, unlimited last time, this time it was a basket of four for five people. Then the server chided my wife for asking for the Margarita special, insisting that they never have drink specials.  Ahh, okay.  \\n\\nThe order screw up started with taking the order.  The server looked away as we spoke to her.  It was like we were boring her or something.  While my daughter was ordering, the server turned to me and asked, \\"What is she saying, I can't hear her.\\" As if my daughter was speaking another language. \\n\\nFirst a Caesar Salad was brought to the table.  Nobody ordered it.  Then ribs. No one ordered ribs.  When my daughter's chicken was served, they dropped the honey mustard all over the seat and my daughter's jacket. They forgot my daughter's sweet corn, and my son had to wait to receive his meal because they thought he ordered ribs.  \\n\\nLater, Some slightly older, but just as disengaged random girl came to our table to ask how we were doing.  Was this the manager; no introduction?  Impossible unless child labor laws have reverted to the 19th century. I complained and she came back with a bag of peanuts and a appetizer coupon taped to it. How sad.  My son's chicken was comped as it came out after everyone was finished eating.\\n\\nThe food was really terrible too. Steak fries were too seasoned; caked in salt.  The chicken was full of gristle.  My burger tasted like cold raw dough.  And the side pickle was a combination of tastes - formaldehyde and salt.  It was gross. \\n\\nI so wish this place was better.  There's nothing down here in this part of Massachusetts.

It was sort of funny that the meal is served in a bamboo steam grill type dish.  I mean everything inside is fried!

I really enjoyed the Quiche, so be sure to get it. The meat dishes were a gamble and some were better than the others. The vegetarian dishes too were ok and the eggplant skewers could have been cooked a bit more. \\n\\nAll and all, its a good place but be prepared to be surrounded by commotion.

It's not you, it's me. \\n\\nOk, it's you.\\n\\nI love your warm fireplace and comfy seating as I wait for a table. I appreciate how you provide free cheese and crackers at the bar. You even do a Christmas tree for the holidays. It's great! It's just that the quality of your food isn't that good anymore. Brunch has slipped to average and the comfort food is so-so. Lately, it's been kinda bad even. For example, the pulled chicken pasta was way over salted as if the chicken stock with the prosciutto, vege, herbs in it had been over-reduced, sitting out, or re-cooked. And there was way too much of it. Did I get the last of it? Because I had images of the cook flipping over the rest of the pot. Even the brunch seems to be falling short. It's just so average tasting.\\n\\nBut it's not just that. The service is really bad lately, like the staff is aloof or something. You shouldn't have to wait for water, or menus. And managers who notice you sitting there should never respond with, \\"Your server will be right there\\". What happened to, \\"I apologize for the wait. Is there anything I can get you?\\" Last time my server stood chit-chatting behind us while I sat there parched.  At least I think that was my server... three or four different people tended to us that night. It was so impersonal and (dare I say) TGIFridays-ish. Sorry, but that's how it felt.\\n\\nWhat happened?!\\n\\nComfort food has gone mainstream and you need to differentiate with creativity, quality and service. You're going to have to do much better.

My husband and I used to enjoy Tasting East. We live relatively close to it, and we would frequently stop in for dinner there or take-out. A few months ago while we were eating in, one of the managers was making small talk with us, and he gave us free green beans. We loved them so much that we began ordering them every time we ate at Tasting East. Tonight my husband went to pick up take out for four of us. He ordered Basil Chicken, Bok Choy, Shrimp Fried Rice, and brown and white rice. When he came home and we opened the boxes, we realized that they used small containers and only filled them halfway with food. (The only full container was the Shrimp Fried Rice.) Knowing that this was unusual, he called the restaurant and the manager told us to come back in and they'd give us a full portion of chicken. We walked back to the restaurant and the manager apologized. We were very understanding since this had never happened before. My husband showed her pictures of the half-empty containers and although she was friendly, she defended the portion sizes of some of our items. My husband also ordered my forgotten green beans, and she assured him that they would give us a large portion. She charged him for the beans, which was strange since we had to walk back to the restaurant for a problem they had caused, but it was fine since we were the ones adding to the order. We left with our new food, and when we got back home, they had given us even smaller portions than the last time! We couldn't believe it! They still used the small boxes and they were filled less than halfway. We were very disappointed that one of our favorite restaurants chose to save money in food costs rather than give good customer service.

So when we asked about a refund (we were seriously dissapointed) we were told she could only give us 70% as she had to throw the food away.  I am assuming even she didn't want to eat it.

A voluminous insulated walk-in cooler keeps hundreds of kegs at proper temperature for optimal drinking satisfaction out on the patio.\\n  As part of the Rogue business empire, Green Dragon operates with solid backing and access to the best beers out there, leading to a wide selection of beers on tap that are hard to find elsewhere in Portland. A small selection of bottles - featuring mostly Rogue - rounds out the beer menu. Taps are split into two areas, with ciders and other specialties thrown into the mix. \\n  The Buckman Botanical Brewery operates alongside the GD, with fermenters and brewing equipment visible from the main seating area. The resulting brews usually occupy a half-dozen of the taps, so you can enjoy the efforts of the small brewery alongside the others. Weekly events include a 'meet the brewer' night on Thursdays and 'tap takeovers' or new brew release events. They host other larger events as well, including a yearly cask event which attracts a decent crowd, the Pliny release party, and full-on brewer's dinners. \\n  The food menu is a secondary concern, although it's got a few decent items that'll help soak up the beer(I think). I've had the 'Belgian' fries, which just barely held me over to our next stop. I can't recall much more than that, so either the food menu is uninspiring or I've gotten really drunk every time I ate there (I suppose that's a possibility...). Usually if the places I drink at have decent food I remember. Well, it's not as if there aren't a dozen decent places to eat within 10 blocks anyways.\\nGreen Dragon Bistro is really all about the beer. They accept credit cards, have excellent service without the snotty attitude, and table service on the patio, the average crowd is a bit older and, dare I say, more sophisticated. IF you're planning a weekend beer trip I'd chose the Dr4g0n over that other place that starts with A if you're over 30 and can drink your beer without showing off your sleeve tatts or have fewer thn 3 piercings. \\n \\n5 stars, my favorite taphouse in Portland, tied with Bailey's for my Best of Portland.

I have been there twice. The first time was with my husband and another couple. Not only did we wait over 45 minutes for our food, but it was not good at all.  We paid, left and I haven't been back for several months.  I see nothing has changed.  \\n\\nThis time, we ordered agedashi tofu, vegetable tempura, a spicy tuna hand roll, and some sushi rolls.  I was slightly ticked because the \\"specialty\\" rolls were very expensive.  My favorite Spider Roll was $16!  When the couple next to us remarked the same thing, I had to laugh.  They even asked the server why it was so expensive when they have seen the same roll for much less at other sushi restaurants.  The server then said that \\"soft shell crab is very difficult to get and in demand.\\"  I guess it's not in such demand in Columbus because I have never paid more than $11 for a Spider Roll.  \\n\\nOur vegetable tempura and agedashi tofu arrived with a bowl of \\"Chandra's Special Sauce.\\"  I was expecting traditional tempura dipping sauce but ok, I'll try it.  However, my agedashi tofu arrived on a plate and not in the traditional fish stock.  I thought that maybe the \\"special sauce\\" was a substitute but it was really just a soy-based sauce with some red pepper and other spices.  \\n\\nI took one bite of the tempura and nearly spit it out.  The batter was heavy and a dark brown color.  I tasted like it was beer battered instead of using a rice flour batter.  I thought maybe it was just the piece I ate so I tried a giant onion ring.  I might as well be eating it at Burger King because that's how it tasted.  No light, fluffy coating.  No tempura sauce to dip it in.  \\n\\nMy two handrolls arrived and they tasted fine but I was so annoyed by the tempura and tofu that when the John-Travolta-Saturday-Night-Fever-open-shirt-big-medallion server returned, I asked for him to take the tempura away and please take it off the bill.  I should have known this would cause a great disruption in the force.  Chandra came to our table and asked about the food.  \\n\\nI started by trying to tell her about the tempura.  I tried to fit a couple of things in about the tofu.  But Chandra always has to be right so she will argue and argue until she has the last word.  I explained that I lived in Japan for many years and have eaten at hundreds of sushi restaurants.  That was no deterrent to her arguing.  Her explanation for the lack of fish stock in the agedashi tofu was that \\"our customers don't like it that way.\\"  And my response to her was \\"then why are you calling it agedashi?  Just call it fried tofu -- which you already have on the menu!\\"  I was very calm -- it takes a lot for me to get really loud -- but I was on the verge so I told her that we would not pay for any part of the meal and we were leaving.  \\n\\nChandra actually followed me out on the street and kept on about how I didn't know what I was talking about.

The quality of the hot pot was mediocre. The meat is pretty low quality compared to other hot pot places I have tried (even an average supermarket will have better meat for hot pot). However, the vegetables, noodles, fish balls, etc. were all pretty fresh and tasty. At the end, our bill came out to be around $14 each after tax and pre-tip. We gave the waiter our cards and when he came back the bill had changed to be $17 something (mandatory 18% tip) AND someone had written in an additional $3 on every single one of our receipts, bringing the total to around $20, which would have been a 36% tip.

I want to preface the following comments by saying that this cheap AYCE meal is probably not a good indication of Danketsu overall. I have not yet had the chance to try the restaurant's sushi, hot pot, or main dish options which I'm sure are all really delicious.\\n\\nStarting off, the wait to get a table is long. Thursday nights are popular in the college community. My party of two actually got really lucky and managed to avoid a long line (we went at around 9PM). Even though Danketsu briefly ran out of grills, we were seated in only 30min. This is a much shorter wait than the poor lady who came in behind us. She was still in the waiting area after we finished out meal about an hour later.\\n\\nOnce we got to our table we had to wait even longer for our server to take our drink orders. I was a little disappointed at the banchan that came. The selection was okay but the portions were pretty small. For meats we ordered mainly the brisket and marinated pork belly. Both I found to be a bit strange. The brisket had a weird aftertaste (almost sour-ish?) and was sliced thick. It was chewy after we cooked it. For the pork belly, I found it strange Danketsu decided to marinate it in KBBQ sauce. However, I'm not going to complain because I ended up really liking the flavor. What I found weird was how thinly the pork belly was sliced. It almost ended up reminding me of Chinese braised pork belly rather than the thick slices of belly that are typically at KBBQ joints. The amount of fat in the pork belly didn't help either. At some point I felt like I was eating thin slices of cooked fat.\\n\\nThe KBBQ grill is also not built into the table and is moreso like a griddle with an opening at the edge for the grease to flow out. Since the fat has nowhere to go except that tiny opening, grease pools formed on the griddle. We were essentially frying our meats in pools of oil that would occasionally pop and burn our arms.\\n\\nI've dined in quiet KBBQ joints to noisy KBBQ places that play kpop or EDM. Danketsu plays hard rap. Loudly. While I personally didn't mind, I couldn't imagine families with young children eating here and having to listen to the very interesting lyrics. My table was also directly under the speakers at the front and our KBBQ was basically vibrating from the bass in the songs. \\n\\nBeing straightforward, Danketsu is better than Izziban...but it's still a long shot from really great KBBQ. The $10 AYCE Thursdays is a good deal for college students to grab a cheap bite with friends but it ends at that. I would not be able to come back multiple Thursdays for subpar meats/service. I plan on returning to Danketsu to try their options other than the AYCE KBBQ. I hope to be able to update my review and boost the rating afterwards."},{"name":"Bittersweet - Cafe & Confections","address":"836 Main St","city":"Louisville","stars":"3.5","text":"Fun & Fast Outdoor Breakfast!\\nReally quick, easy, and delicious!"},{"name":"Library Square","address":"300 W Georgia St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Library Square was once my favourite place in Vancouver - especially 90s Night on Friday.

Personally, I prefer regular thickness ramen noodles and didn't find out until after the meal that... \\n\\n(un-confirmed) TIP: You can switch to regular thickness ramen noodles for no additional charge! (At least that's what I heard from my brother, but it's worth asking about!)\\n\\nI personally feel that they should use regular ramen noodles as the default option because that's what people are expecting when they order ramen, especially since it doesn't say on the menu or anywhere that they use different noodles. Meanwhile, the thin noodles can be offered as an alternate option, instead of vice versa. Otherwise, you have to eat it once, feel disappointed by the non-ramen noodles, and learn the hard way.. and where's the fun in that?\\n\\nAnyway, I ordered the original tonkotsu (pork) ramen ($14). It comes with a black sesame garlic oil that gives the broth a smoky taste (I think I prefer less my ramen less smoky). Overall, many of the components of the ramen were pretty good--the pork was tender, the nitamago (seasoned soft boiled egg) was flavorful and a perfect runniness--I just wasn't in love with the noodles.

It's fun to play a game of pool over a cup of coffee; the pool costs you something like $4 per hour, but they charge you to the minute, so if you play for 48 minutes you'll only pay 48/60ths of $4 per hour, which I think is thoughtful. Also, I have to give them props for keeping their cool when my brother accidentally launched one of the pool balls off the table and it proceeded to roll behind their huge coffee counter that holds the espresso machines. They were extremely gracious about moving the entire counter to retrieve the ball for us, and proceeded to NOT kick us out entirely, which was much appreciated. \\n\\nI've never come with a need to use the wifi, but I can see how the paid wifi is a bummer for a lot of folks. \\n\\nI think diesel is a great place to come and chill with friends, read, or just people watch, but I can't see it working as well as your daily coffee stop simply because the overpriced drinks start to add up after a while."},{"name":"Roosters","address":"5225 Nike Station Way","city":"Hilliard","stars":"4","text":"My family and I were in OH for the weekend and this place was recommended to us. \\nHighlights: \\n-very very friendly and helpful staff\\n-the manager ( a young lady) had to take care of something on our order for us and our interaction with her was amazing.

Salad was fresh and well dressed, pizza was OUTSTANDING. Well cooked, great flavor, spot on. My mom had the snapper and raved, and my dad enjoyed the scallop dish though I will say it was a single scallop on top of a small portion of rice? Risotto? This is why I generally don't order from the Restaurant Week Menu unless I'm really, really interested in trying something. I think during ARW restaurants get overly ambitious and then realize they're hemorrhaging money and take it out on the unwitting customer. But I digress.\\n\\nThe wine list is all Italian and I had a glass of prosecco (tasty) and a glass of white that was really lovely. The name escapes me. My dad ordered a Jack on the rocks and I can confirm a healthy pour.\\n\\nIf it wasn't for the awkward serving of our appetizers and entrees nearly simultaneously, I would probably give Winflo 5 stars.

Also, HH that ends at 6 is kinda lame.\\n\\nThe negative:  the service is less than hospitable, both the waitress and the bartender bordered on actually being rude.

I then said, so you're telling me that if I order one of your menu drinks, I can have grapefruit juice, but I can't have the grapefruit juice in a Salty Dog? I went on to ask what kind of sense does that make--when the grapefruit juice is gone, it's gone regardless, right? \\n\\nSeeing my logic, she said she'd \\"check again with the bartender.\\" She returned with a tall vodka & soda with approximately one teaspoon (or less) of grapefruit juice in it.  Neither I nor my drinking companions could taste any grapefruit juice, but it was slightly clouded--the only indication that there was *something* in it besides club soda.  \\n\\nWhen the bill arrived, I was shocked at the $10 price--I approached the waitress about this; she explained that the cash register only has one button for a bar cocktail and it's $10 regardless of what it is.

The Star Anise really comes through in theirs and the spice is just right. It lingers just a little in the back of your throat after a sip.\\nThe noodles: Nice perfectly cooked chewy and delicious. not over cooked like a lot of places.\\nThe Goods ( meat): Delicately seasoned and set off perfectly by the broth. Thinly sliced steak cooked medium, Homemade vietnamese style beef meatballs, and Beef Tendon( i love the tendon its nice and meaty at this spot not too fatty)\\nThe Acoutrement: All of the stuff you want in your bowl of pho served on a pretty little side plate so you can add as much or as little as you want. Me?? Its ALL GOING IN YA HEAR!! Sriracha on the table, thinly sliced fresh jalapeno, bean sprouts, fresh cilantro, fresh thai basil and lime wedges. The soup is not the same without this little plate of special signature pairings and places that serve it without should be barred from serving it at all.\\n ALL OF THIS FOR $5.50-6.00 depending on type of Pho.

A mix of creepy older guys that shouldn't be going out still and girls who only want people to buy them drinks. Some of the staff is pretty rude. Depending on what bartender you got the drinks either had a lotttt of alcohol or barely any. Drinks are also pretty expensive.

You can see cobwebs hanging from the corners of the room.\\n\\n  The dust on the walls is so thick that you could write in it, but then you'd have to go to the bathroom to wash your hands and that would be another experience that would scare you.  \\n\\n  The diner is very small.  The tables are very close together, and if you aren't very skinny, you are going to feel squished.

It would also probably be overrun with hipsters and cost twice as much so I guess i'm fine with the whole beaverton strip mall thing... The food is incredibly authentic Japanese izakaya fare, prepared with care and consistently delicious.  \\n\\nI think a lot of people are a little confused about how to order this type of food, so I thought it might be helpful to make some suggestions. The menu is divided up by preparation.  You should try to get a little something from each section, to balance out the meal.  \\n\\nSome of my favorites menu items: \\njapanese ceasar salad - very lightly dressed romaine salad with pine nuts and thin crispy potatoes.  A great light starter to balance some of the heavier fare\\nfried lotus root (renkon hasamiage) - Crispy lotus root with savory shrimp paste, expertly fried in a light tempura batter.  So tasty with just a light dusting of salt.  I get this pretty much every time I go.  \\nMotsu ni - miso offal stew, which sounds gross but is not at all.  The offal is julienned and stewed with miso, burdock and tofu.  Very light, great in the winter.  \\npotatoes au gratin - my japanese friends make fun of me because I always order gratin at izakaya... what can I say, I love gratin.  This version is light and creamy, with the fish roe adding a hidden flavor.    \\nsubuta-style pork spareribs - just had these the other day and MAN!  so good.  the meat is so tender, and I think it's fried a little for a little crunch up-front.  wonderful sweet n sour glaze.  \\neringi/bok choi stir fry - perfect stir fry with a light sweet n salty sauce.  Eringi mushrooms are perfectly cooked to bring out its vanilla-like aroma.  \\n\\nI usually finish the meal with noodles or a rice dish - neither are anything to write home about, but they are perfectly satisfying.  \\n\\nThe only complaints I have are that 1) it closes early on saturdays for some inexplicable reason and 2) it's not open for lunch so I can't go there as an added bonus to going to uwajimaya, which would really complete my Japanese afternoon."},{"name":"South End Open Market","address":"375 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We went opening weekend and it was a gorgeous day.

Finally, I've found a spot with pretty damn good tex-mex. After making a small conversation with a worker and finding out exactly what Pollo Tinga is we were obliged by our imagination to try it out.\\n\\nSuper duper 12\\" Pollo Tinga burrito, por favor. You only want $5 for it? Are you sure? OK. Rice, shredded chicken with picante, lettuce, and black beans. Amazing. All the flavors fought my hunger in unison, much like something you'd see in Lord of the Rings or Star Wars. They are also one of the few places with a self-serve salsa bar where you can indulge yourself in sauces that will destroy your tastebuds. But nothing leaves yourself more satisfied than the feeling of having your ass kicked by a thousand chilis.\\n\\nI think some of the other places in Boston think they can just put meat, rice, and other stuff into a tortilla and expect people to eat it. No, you cannot do that to someone who lived in Arizona for over 20 years. Something I just realized last night was how much I appreciate a piping hot burrito. Felipe's is the first place to have reminded me of this. In Arizona, its a given, but it seems that over the past few days in Boston I had forgotten this gift. Seriously, having been to other places in Boston that are supposedly amazing, none of them served me a burrito that was hot when I got to the table. \\n\\nCouple this with a self serve salsa bar, the only way you should serve salsa, and you have near perfection. I've developed a bad habit from living in Arizona, using a cup of salsa and pouring salsa onto each bite. Its a horrible habit to have in Boston, its like drinking milk straight out of the carton. But if everyone gets their own carton, as they do at Felipe's, then I don't see where the problem is. Try this with a hot burrito. The cold salsa on a hot burrito brings out flavors you probably can't even comprehend.\\n\\nWe decided to also order a mini-quesadilla and an horchata. I didn't find anything wrong with either, except for the fact that the mini-quesadilla was served on a corn tortilla. Not much you can do about this, since I don't think many places make flour tortillas that size. \\n\\nAll in all, if you want to discover true Tex-mex, you need to visit this place. I won't name the other places in Boston, but this one beats them all by a long shot.

At first we were a bit confused about how the seating and ordering works as the entire restaurant was packed solid. One guest told me to order first and then grab a free table. Went to order and I was told I needed a table before I was able to order. She was very helpful though and went searching for a seat for me and my husband. Nothing was available, until a very nice woman behind me said there were two free seats next to her at a six top. \\nOk, strange start, but it all flowed well after that. Though I would suggest a sign at the front with instructions.\\nThe restaurant is adorable! I love the ambiance with the bright natural lighting, the marble tables, the cute little grocery. It's precious! Even the bathrooms are cute. And they sell Noble syrup. I have always wanted to try it and have seen it in many blogs. Actually they sell several products that are unique and small business sourced. The variety of cheese and charcuterie were pleasing to see too.\\nSo on to the food. My husbands eyes were too big for his stomach and he ordered us way too much food while I was saving our seats. He veered from our plan, but hey, I'm pregnant, so why not? We started off with the fried green tomatoes. They were delicious! I loved the topping and thought it was such a great mixture of salty, sweet, and savory. I would have preferred thicker slices of tomato, but all in all two thumbs up.\\nThen came the fried oyster po'boy. Oh....my.....God......this was amazing. Like everything around me went gray and it was me and my new lover of a sandwich making out. It really was an experience. I was sad that we split this sandwich. The oysters were piping hot and crispy, the bread was fantastic, the rest of the toppings and sauce were heaven. The best po'boy I have ever had. \\nMy husband also order the chicken terrine. This was good. But I probably wouldn't order it again. Nothing like the sandwich. But it was fresh and had a delicious flavor with all of the mushrooms. \\nWe ended with two Americanos (heaven!) that were piping hot and the right amount of bitter. An order of beignets (ok we don't usually eat like this y'all!), and one macaron. Because I judge a place by their macaron's. The macaron was a delight. They were thick, chewy, and crispy. The strawberry  filling was so so so good. But the beignets. They were the best thing of all. I can't even describe them. So hot and the inside was so chewy and the powdered sugar.....oh please try these. I seriously wanted more, which would have made me a fat ass. If we lived nearby. We would have a beignet a day. And an expensive dentist bill! And diabetes. But they are that good.\\n Another plus was the friendly, unpretentious environment. So refreshing these days when many wonderful eateries like these in Austin supply a massive amount of obnoxious hipster staff that makes you feel bad for even coming into their restaurant.

The shrimp were so overcooked they were shriveled. Of the 5-6 shrimp only the equivalent of one shrimp was even soft enough to chew. I found myself spitting out tough, dried out pieces before I gave up and moved it all to the side. To add insult to injury, when I got the bill, I saw that the shrimp upcharge was $12 (not listed on the menu) almost as much as the entree itself.

The Setas Ronan tapa (salad-based) was incredible- I could have made a meal out of that.  The tortilla espanola was bland but made better with a little salt. The patatas bravas were plentiful and probably were not something I'd order again.  They were bland except for the sauce on top...and after a few bites of that sauce I had had enough.  The mussels in saffron broth were great.  For dessert, their tarta de chocolate was like a piece of dark-chocolate fudge.  Heavenly!

If you however eat anytime after 7pm be prepared for the worst service ever. The ambiance and menu are fantastic. I love the fact that the menu is changed frequently, but they keep basic pasta types. They will always have a agnoleti on the menu and it will always be delicious. We've had the pleasure of trying three different preps- all fantastic. The pizzas are good, but in a city rife with excellent pizza options there's nothing unique here. Cocktails are unpredictable. One day they are delic, the next meh. Wine list is pricey and also kind of meh for the price point. \\n\\nOk- now onto the service. The first time I went there, our server was terrible, but we enjoyed the meal so much we thought- hey probably a fluke. The second time (super early dinner- pretty empty restaurant)- the service was impeccable. I had set my friends up for good food and terrible service and they thought I was crazy and were pleasantly surprised by how attentive the server was. Third time around- just awful. It took forever to flag down our server for more wine and cocktail (which we needed plenty of because it took freaking forever to get our food), he ignored our bread requests, and I think the expeditor went on strike that night (it took way too long to receive our food and the items were strangely staggered). \\n\\nAlso on a side note, please please clean those bathrooms, or better yet separate out the mens' and womens'. The toilet seat and floor in the bathroom I had the displeasure of using was covered in piss, and the trash can was overflowing.

You can't fault Diesel for being a popular hangout. It's not like there isn't plenty of seating. just be patient.\\n\\nThe ONLY negative is that they've gone too far with the garage theme.

While you can't reserve an outdoor table on Open Table, show up early enough and you'll score one. \\n\\nFor drinks, don't miss Stephanie's signature sangrias--my favorite is the strawberry lemonade. My dining partner had a \\"white\\" sangria which she didn't love. \\n\\nAs we were in a bit of a rush (Jason Aldean concert at Fenway!), we selected a few appetizers--the warm Vermont goat cheese and the ahi tuna tartare--and the chilled roasted vegetable gazpacho to share. \\n\\nThe warm Vermont goat cheese comes bathed in olive oil, framed by olives and cloves of roasted garlic, and served with delicious toasted bread. It's a succulent dish. The ahi tuna tartare--wrapped in a thin cucumber slice--is a spicy complement to the goat cheese. The gazpacho is not so spicy that you can't taste the vegetables, and worth ordering without the chipotle aioli or shrimp. Our total for two drinks, three appetizers and a tip was about $80--reasonable for Newbury Street.\\n\\nOn the whole, the only drawback to Stephanie's is the somewhat snotty hostesses, but you can always smile and sweet talk your way past them.

Originally we were planning on going to Pearl Castle beside it but we didn't want to wait that long. Every table in Yuu was full except for a couple, so we just went in and got a seat right away. \\n\\nFirst thing I noticed was the decorations - since it's almost Halloween there were so many decorations all around the store ! Posters and skeletons and such. I thought that was pretty cute :) anyway ... Onto the food ! \\n\\nThere are SO many options on the menu. A lot of options : rice with sauces and toppings, curry, soupy noodles, hot pot, fried appetizers, fries, so many different types of hot and cold drinks, a variety of desserts and parfaits and milkshakes... Definitely hard to choose. \\n\\nTook a while to choose and the server was just standing nearby waiting. But at least they were not that close to our table so we didn't feel too income table or pressured. They were very nice too when we wanted to switch tables to a wall seat. \\n\\nWe ended up getting the kimchi hot pot $13.95 (I was craving that), fried tofu $6.95 (craving that too), and ramen $10.95 since it seemed to be one of their signature dishes. The kimchi hot pot was pretty standard. Not too spicy, and had a lot of ingredients inside : shrimp, tender pork slices, kimchi (obviously), mushrooms, tofu. Pretty good and hit the spot. \\n\\nThe fried tofu though..... Honestly the BEST I've ever had ! They were perfectly seasoned and crisp and delicate on the outside, soft and smooth on the inside. It was around 6 pretty big cubes in a sweet soy sauce (tempura sauce I think?) and for $6.95 (if I remember correctly ) it was a fair portion. I would've preferred if they didn't directly serve it in the sauce though, since the bottom pieces got soggy. But the sauce is very delicious too at least. Honestly I can see myself coming back here just for the tofu. It was amazing. 10/10 would recommend !!  \\n\\nThe ramen my mom got had a very flavourful soup and very tender meat. I've noticed all their meat seems cooked pretty well here, very tender and soft. However I found the noodles a bit too chewy/firm. But then again I'm not a huge noodle fan in the first place (I love my rice) so perhaps ramen is supposed to be that texture.  \\n\\nOverall it was a pretty good experience. I felt that the tables were a bit small and it was a bit too loud, but the food was great and it came VERY fast - probably in 10 mins MAX. Fast service and accommodating servers. Prices seem a bit high, but the meal portions are pretty big.

These fries are like an illicit drug -- much better than any fast food or nasty frozen crinkle fry you'd get elsewhere. Comparable to a Steak Escape kind of fry (which I love). \\n\\nThe burgers are really good -- you can tell the quality of the meat is better than most places of its kind. I actually like the burgers better than 5 Guys. I have to partially agree with the reviewer who was bashing on the buns -- it's not so egregious that it deters me from Graffiti when I have a hankering for a nasty, full-on greasy meal but it could definitely be improved on. \\n\\nThe service is just \\"meh\\", and I wish you didn't have to call to confirm your online order (what's the point?) and I REALLY wish there was a pick-up window, but these are all peripheral points (service is peripheral when you're talking fast food, since you rarely get amazing fast food service to begin with). \\n\\nOverall, 3.5 -- rounds to a 4 in my book, just for these sweet sweet fries. Also, tip: the fries might seem expensive to a newbie, but a large fry is seriously a BAG O' FRIES.

So this was my first time at Vino Venue and I was really looking forward to it - and then I was in a situation that morning where I was not going to be able to drink any wine.  But I was determined to enjoy the food anyway!\\n\\nI have been notorious to go to the restaurant week outings and then NOT order from the special menus - so I have changed my strategy and insist on ordering off these menus and get the RW experience.  Total failure this time around.  A couple of the ladies at the table opted to do the enomatic wine cards (opting for the Yelp deal instead of the RW deal as it was a better offer). The rest of the table went with the $20 bottle deal.\\n\\nFrom the RW menu, I chose the Green Goddess Salad, the Braised Beef Bistro Filet on Potato Leek Waffles and the Dark Chocolate Orange Pot de Cr√®me.  The salad was delicious and probably the best thing I ate all night. It had a very refreshing and herbaceous dressing with a great salt level and a nice crunch from the pepitas.  The entree was atrocious. So first, even if you braise a filet, it is a crime to A) cook it to well done and B) cook it without any salt or pepper. Now, they then placed world's smallest piece atop a piece of waffle - that actually had a decent flavor and was one of the only things giving any flavor at all to this dish. Next, it came with a jus that we poured over the top - it gave flavor to the dish, made the waffles soggy, which killed them. Plus, the flavor of the jus was just salt - not in a good way.\\n\\nThank goodness for a decent dessert - which I almost did not get. Our server brought the desserts to the table - for everyone except me.  So I waited and waited, and finally started waving in his direction (he was 15 feet from the table) and he looked up and I motioned at the empty space in front of me. Next thing I know, he is placing the pot de cr√®me in front of me.  So this was pretty rich in dark chocolate, with a pretty smooth texture, and a nice orange finish.  It was pretty good - not the best I have had, but a good finish after a terrible entree.\\n\\nThe entire thing was $20 plus tax - that I wish I could get back.

There's about rotating 15 beers on tap from breweries such as Dogfish, St. George, Bear Republic, Bridgeport, Anchor, and Mt. Shasta Brewing to name a few.

An expression I always tell friends when they visit my city is that \\"if you've had a bad meal in this city that's on you & should have probably gone to the place next-door.\\" So when I travel I like to do my research on Yelp, Eater & the other food blogs to make sure I don't fall victim to a bad meal in a great food town. Austin & Emmer & Rye lived up to the hype. This is a restaurant with clear vision & style and they really hit on every note. The service, atmosphere, and food was 5-star without any of the pretensions that usually accompany those establishments. \\n\\nI arrived to Emmer & Rye on a reservation with a group of about 12; we had a reservation & had arranged with them to have a prefix tasting menu where we'd get to try about a dozen different dishes. For a foodie like me (and many of my friends on this trip) this was going to be a great opportunity to see what Head Chef Kevin Fink, who was just named one of the best new chefs by Food & Wine, could do. I was excited to see Kevin's take on giving the French Laundry experience but for apparently a fraction of the price!\\n\\nThe first dish that was brought out was a Green Papaya, Mango Salad with Thai Chili, Mint & Lime. The flavors were fresh and very clean; a bit of an amuse-bouche to get this dinner started. While enjoying the first few dishes I decided to have one of their signature cocktails, the Velveteen Rabbit which was vodka based drink with carrot juice & ginger beer, very refreshing. It tasted as if the carrots had just come out of their organic soul minutes before they went into the cocktail. \\n\\nShortly after this dish we had 2 different crostini style items; a confit Eggplant with tomato & basil on a homemade corn baguette & some of the best avocado toast I've ever had on homemade sourdough. As a carb lover both of these dishes were among my favorites; fresh, bold favors that play nicely off each other with nothing overpowering the rest of the ingredients. Good, simple food.\\n\\nNext was an Emmer Johnny Cake with cr√®me fraiche... think potato latke 2.0 simple but delicious. Next was a julienned potato dish with just a nice hint of chili powder to assert itself after the initial bite.  The 6th dish was possibly my favorite of the meal; the Lamb Belly Roulade with Lamb Taro Spuma & arugula Chimichurri. For the food layman think deconstructed chimichanga. The rich creamy outer shell hiding well-seasoned bit of lamb in a chimichurri sauce, just writing about it now makes me want another.  Keeping with the Latin flavor they brought out a Pork Carnitas with a white Sonoran roti that was equally delicious. After these two dishes we traveled to Italy where we got to taste Chef Fink's rendition of the classic dish Cacio E Pepe. If you love the rich creamy taste of Challerhoker cheese this is the dish for you.\\n\\nAnd if all that wasn't enough we had 2 different desserts to try; the classic Tres Leches Cake with a Guava glaze & my personal favorite (but I loved both) was the Toasted Grain Ice Cream, Brioche Pudding, Pecan, Chocolate Crumb with a little bit of peach jam on the bottom. Picture a scoop of ice cream surrounded by this amazing rich pudding on one side & a chocolate cookie crumble on the other with some peach jam hiding on the bottom below the ice cream. When these flavors combine it made Captain Planet!\\n\\nI can't say enough good things about the food at Emmer & Rye but I stop for just a moment to talk about the ambiance. Very clean, rustic feel to the restaurant with a big open kitchen, a fermenting pantry where a lot of the ingredients are born and a unique quirk in the bathrooms ... they play an NPR style podcast where they talk and describe food and favors.

Then our office moved and it became an every no and again, then my office moved again and it was whenever we were in the area (maybe once a month).\\n\\nOur visit this past Sunday was one that was planned. Upon arriving things were different, the lighting was different, the tables seemed off as well.\\n\\nWe walked up to the counter and were sort of greeted. The last few times I was in, I did not see the usual counter folk, I mean both my wife and I ate there so often the main conter lady (sorry never caught a name) knew us by sight. \\n\\nI had in mind exactly what I wanted, tofu, best tofu stir fry in town. I was advised that they don't have the lunch combo right now, so dinner portions. Since my wife had not yet ordered, I took this as an advisement on the price difference, not that fact that there was be enough food for two. I would like to split the blame on this down the middle, half on me for not getting he was trying to advise on the amount of food maybe, but then after my wife ordered literally the exact same thing, no follow-up that it was likely enough to feed us both. \\n\\nI would like to have given them 3 stars. But Just couldn't and here is the reasoning.\\n\\n1) The guy who took our order at the counter had serious issues with the computer, while they were not busy at all, it was a little annoying that he had to keep asking the guy next to him, whom appeared to know exactly how everything worked, I would have preferred the knowledgeable one punch in our order with the trainee observing, just my thought. I mean, new management, means time for a new first impression, \\"best foot forward\\" type of thing.\\n\\n2) Tofu was ok, not as good as usual. This could be due to the dinner portion being larger and therefore the tofu not cooking in the center all the way.\\n\\n3) Too much sauce, I mean seriously, like a half cup extra worth of sauce in the Styrofoam dish. When I was packing up the left overs, I poured out the extra sauce and threw it away. The sauce was pretty much like always, which means they either followed the recipe properly, or more likely have extra of the brand that was being used around (or extra was made and they haven't used it all yet).\\n\\n4) Styrofoam dishes. I have to admit the plastic take away dishes Food Shui was using seemed high end, particularly when I was likely not taking leftover with me was probably a waste of money in the overall concept. But eating a \\"for here\\" meal out of Styrofoam is not enjoyable, particularly when the rice was not near the rest of the food (it came in a separate dish). So maybe, try some plates as well?\\n\\nIf they are still around in say 6mos I will try them again, but for now, I am sorry the drive is too far for me to gamble on the new management.

They do not require you to be on their mailing list to get their midweek specials (lately $16 for 3 course meals, fantastic!), but they let you know what will be coming up the next week in the email, which is pretty nice.  For the 3 course meals, the appetizers were all appropriately individually sized, the entrees were larger than I had expected for the price, and the desserts were normal individual sizes.  The appetizers were quite good.  The entrees were amazing.  The creamed spinach that came with my grilled beef top filet steak au jus over scallion mashed potatoes were...incredible.  So were the carrots not listed in the dish, the mashed potatoes, and the beef.  Everyone else really liked their food as well, with another person getting the Morrocan lemon chicken breast  dish and another getting the veal dish.  \\n\\nThe flan is eggier than I was hoping it would be, but then again that may be normal for flans, I haven't had one in years.

I don't know if it's the peanut oil (Five Guys doesn't smell like this though) or the branding of the buns, but it had a burnt odor.  The offending smell quickly dissipated, but it was noticeable.\\n\\nAfter perusing the very lengthy but tiny print menu on the wall, I ordered a couple of burgers and their accoutrements.  I got a normal BurgerFi cheeseburger minus tomato, and a build your own with a bunch of crazy stuff on it, a large fry (which they claimed could feed four, and was in fact quite large), and a plastic cup for the fancy Coke machine.\\n\\nI was kind of surprised to find the soda cup to be unbelievably tiny.  Yeah, you get unlimited refills.  But who wants to get up to refill a cup a bunch of times during the short period of time it usually takes to scarf down a burger or two?  This isn't a big issue.  But the cup isn't exactly what I'd call inexpensive, so it IS an issue of some shape or size.\\n\\nWhile the kitchen appeared to be well staffed (especially for late nite) it took FOREVER for our food to make its way out.  Despite the many similarities, this is not the well (peanut) oiled machine that one usually finds in the kitchen at Five Guys.  That said, when we finally did get our food everything was de-GD-licious.  The burgers aren't super huge, but they're doubles, and all the ingredients, from the patties to the cheese to the veggies and on to the condiments, are all good quality and very tasty.  The fries came in big brown paper sack that was well-stained with grease and were quite delicious if slightly inconsistent in how they were cooked.  And the hot dogs, which I didn't order but a member of my party did, also seemed pleasing enough to their mouth region.\\n\\nAll in all, I had no complaints at all regarding the food, even if the service was on the slow-as-hell side.  But I'm glad I don't live anywhere near BurgerFi because at the end of the day, they are definitely overpriced and at least I'm not going to be tempted to eat there frequently with 100 miles between us.  No matter how many bottles of wine they hang up BurgerFi isn't a gourmet burger bar.  They're certainly on the level of Five Guys, Jakes Wayback, or Western Massachusetts' institution White Hut.  But that means their burgers should be clocking in around $5 with nothing over $7.  Right now there are items on the menu that come in over $10, which is just preposterous.\\n\\nBut I guess that's Boston?\\n\\nEither way, BurgerFi's fare is fine, but it'll definitely take a bite out of your wallet."},{"name":"Josie's Pizza & Wings","address":"1225 S Hiawassee Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I don't know how they have 4 stars.

No chopped, prechewed pork for me! That's how you see if the cooks know what they're doing with the meat. Anyone can mince up meat, add broth and a little pork fat, and make it seem tender and juicy. I have never, in over 40 years, been disappointed with OHH's sliced pork. The Brunswick stew ranks right up with Harold's. Many's the time I've brought home a gallon for a wintry weekend.

At Stauf's, people buy one cup of coffee and think that entitles them to take up a table for two hours; Stauf's seems fine with these people who sit and take up space for extended periods of time without making additional purchases. Today I went in and ordered coffee and lunch; between waiting in line to order food and then waiting for my food to be ready I was there for about 25 minutes, and I still couldn't get a seat. The frustrating thing was that there were numerous people sitting at tables with just free glasses of water in front of them. I've also shared tables with people before at busy times, but today the people I asked were just not in a sharing mood apparently. I finally had to ask an employee to wrap up my food to go since I didn't have anywhere to sit and eat it. To the employee's credit, she was apologetic and did offer to dry a table on the outdoor patio for me, but given that the temp was in the 50's and it was still drizzling I declined the offer.

Their slogan is \\"An American Bistro serving elevated street food to vegans, vegetarians, meat eaters, and the gluten intolerant alike\\". Great that they offer GF and Veg options! Their presentation of the food is also usually on point. If I were just rating on food and service alone they would get 3 stars.\\n\\nI know they market themselves as filling the niche for people with dietary restrictions, however I don't think using alternative ingredients should change the price that much? Heck I used to work at a Vegetarian/Vegan caf√© a few years ago and our food was very affordable for poor college students!

I even worked there while I was in grad school at the Beaumont location.  So I know the ins and outs and the rigid standards of Damian Mandola and Johnny Carrabba that still linger to this day.  However, upper end franchises are not recession proof and the portions, variety and quality have suffered some.  They are no longer have the 100% wood burning grill of pecan and live oak (gas assisted) and the lamb chops, veal chops and quail are no longer on the menu.  But what has persisted is the refusal to yield to food trends, health fads and the temptation to completely cast aside the original formula.\\n\\nAny decent Italian restaurant can pull off pasta and meat balls, lasagna and chicken Parmesan.  Where Carrabba's excels are the grilled items.  Stick to the grill and wood fired pizze and you will never be disappointed.  Also, do not be afraid to ask for things to order.  They excel at deviating from the menu and making things exactly they way you like it.\\n\\nI have also used Carrabba's for catering at work functions, when I needed to pull off a buffet for clients.

Yep they have wine on TAP! \\n\\nYou get a card, not unlike a debit card and load it with however much money you'd like. (The check-in offer was $20 card value for $15). The taps are automated, so you slide your card, press the amount, 1oz (taste), 2oz (half pour), or 5oz (full pour) you want, and it fills your cup up. Easy! It's a great way to try several different wines without buying a bottle or even a glass.\\n\\nThey also have a nice selection of snacks, apps, and small plates. All of the food was good. The lobster mac n cheese and taco trio were my favorites. The only complaint I have is that kitchen is super slow. We waited for what seemed like an eternity for our food, especially when you're drinking. It all came out hot, though. The service was good and the atmosphere is great for girls' night or date night. In true fashion, my sisters and I shut the place the down, leaving only moments before the staff lol.\\n\\nOverall, definitely worth a trip back.

We normally grat at least 20% when we dine out but we would have liked to have made that choice, not have it forced upon us for our children, one of which did not eat or order. We expected the food to be better than it was and were disapointed. I ordered the whole wheat ravoli and there were 4 on the plate. I would have liked to have had a few more for the price I paid.

There should be at least ONE canister that has creamer, but it would be great of all three had creamer in them. Tha's why all three are out there. That is your one and only job today, Taylor.

Located on a busy stretch of road that is saturated with nails salons and easily forgotten storefronts, I was not expecting to find something so extraordinary tucked among them. Walking through the door I found myself, mouth agape, crossing a bridge (literally - there is a bridge) into the craziest little tiki shack I've ever seen in the states. The jungle-like sounds that greeted me quickly changed to a passing storm...again, it actually stormed over the swamp entrance...and then transitioned into some fun and tropical tunes. I was surprised to see a sunken bar and low-to-the-ground bar seats, giving the illusion of a much larger venue than it actually is. I stood awkwardly at the entryway waiting to be seated or directed, as it wasn't clear what the protocol was. The bartender called out for me to sit wherever and I found the only table available (of 8 total). The place was hopping for a Sunday night! I read through the incredibly detailed, illustrated and wildly creative drink menu wanting to try it all! I chose two and asked the (only) server, who picked one immediately and enthusiastically (a trait I greatly appreciate in a server)! I wasn't disappointed. She delivered the flaming beverage (the Coconaut $12) with a flourish of sparking cinnamon dashed atop. YUM!!! Portland...in the depths of a wet and gloomy winter, I highly recommend a beach escape...to Hale Pele. I swear, one sip and I felt like I was in a bikini on a white sand beach. My guy drank something called The Crazy Bastard (I may be getting the name wrong), and he, too, agreed that we were in the tropics. \\n\\nWe started with the Tuna Poki as an app. The tuna was excellent and tasted fresh, though I found the sauce slightly strong on the fish sauce. For dinner I ordered the Shoyu Chicken, though was feeling a bit of food envy at my guy's order of drunken noodles...until we dug in. \\"Yum\\" does not do justice to this terrifically flavorful, juicy, delicious dish! The drunken noodles were good...but the Shoyu Chicken was out of this world. The server forgot to add chicken to the noodle dish and immediately brought some to add, as well as a side of the grilled Hawaiian Bread to make it right. Make it right, she did!!! That bread was like dessert! Sweet and slightly crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. The guava jam served along side was the icing on the cake. \\n\\nThe main dishes were on the smaller side, though priced accordingly at $8 and $9. And with all the other food and drink, I was quite stuffed in the end. Our total bill was under $50, which seemed very reasonable. \\n\\nI can't wait to go back with our crew of friends to take advantage of the party booth in the back!!

Get blown away by the sheer beauty of every dish presented to you - with delicately drizzled sauce used to draw out flowers around your sushi, and appetizers like toro tartare served in a cone glass on a bed of ice. Even the bathroom is tech, with a funky sink and a robot trashcan.\\n\\nA wonderful and rare gem for Boston: somewhere small with style, with panache, with excellent food and service - somewhere you could take someone from Milan, London, NY, LA and show them that Boston has it too.\\n\\nNow go check out the photos I took."},{"name":"Harry Buffalo","address":"6150 South Sunbury Rd","city":"Westerville","stars":"3.5","text":"This lace is pretty legit!

The bbq beans had nice, smoky flavor and the mac n cheese was so-so. Didn't have much of an opinion on the hush puppies so I guess they weren't that memorable. \\n\\nOf the three meats we chose, the ribs were definitely the star. The meat falls right off the bone and is sweet with smoky undertones. The pulled pork and chicken were a little disappointing, however. Not quite as tender and juicy as we had hoped. But I am a big fan of the sauces they put out on the table. The BBQ sauce and vinegar-based sauce go well with all the meats and I especially loved pairing the vinegar sauce with the pulled pork. \\n\\nSo overall, probably not the most authentic BBQ you could find in Boston but I'll still be coming back for the ribs, biscuits, and fried green tomatoes.

It's conveniently located beside one of the Americasmart buildings. We should have read previous negative reviews, because they are all correct. We were seated promptly as the restaurant wasn't full, and given water and drinks pretty quickly (within 10 minutes). We ordered appetizers as well as main entrees from the vegetarian menu. I should have been clued in when I noticed other tables around us sort of looking around with panicked expressions, because no one around us was receiving any food. It seems that Haveli uses a communal style serving operation where you don't really have one waiter, but rather a group of waiters, and from my experience this seems to be one of the MAJOR issues with this establishment. Over the course of the 1.5 hours I spent here (mostly waiting for food), the waiters were constantly bickering and hollering at each other, not to mention the hollering going on in the back. You could tell that a lot of times when food came out, they didn't know which table it was supposed to go to until someone screamed it out. So I'm assuming that because you have 1-4 different people 'checking on you', they don't know what's been ordered or if The order was even put in. So we waited over 30 minutes for our appetizers, one of which was forgotten until we mentioned it. The samosas were okay, but very oily and the onion pakoras were still fairly raw inside. \\nDuring the next 30 minute wait for our entrees, I witnessed not 1, but 4 tables get up to leave because they just hadn't been served anything. The table of guys beside us didn't have food the entire time we were there and they only arrived about 15 minutes after we did. So our entrees come, and one is extremely burnt tasting. There were burned bits of food in the sauce for the paneer and we just couldn't eat it. The korma was very watery; the sauce was almost like soup, and a not nice looking shade of grayish pink (unlike any korma I've ever had, and I've had many). The rice was just plain with no aromatics added and the naan was just okay. I do respect that dishes vary from region to region in India, but there was genuinely no spice to the dish at all. Indian food is known for being complex in flavor and spice, this all tasted very.. bland and watered down, or even dare I say re-heated. So, the burned dish was inedible and we had to send it back. They took it and offered us something else. (This is why I'm giving the second star, because they were very prompt in getting us another dish) \\n\\nWe got paneer makhani for the replacement, which is one of our favorites and it was okay ish but again with an extremely watery and bland sauce. Since we waited so long for the food we asked for the check soon after getting the replacement dish, to hopefully save some time. The head waiter came to the table after I asked and said 'no no you will finish before I give you the check'. So after another 15 minutes, we just went up to the counter to pay so we could leave. They add a 15% service charge automatically to every bill regardless of party size FYI. \\n\\nI genuinely hope that my review can save others a poor experience and hopefully will help this restaurant realize that they have some SERIOUS work to do. It's unfortunate that it's in such a good location for people going to conventions and americasmart, because most likely you are from out of town, in a hurry, and would never know what to expect. A couple of the waiters here were very nice in general and refilled waters very promptly, so there's the bright spot in the whole thing."},{"name":"Hong Kong","address":"1238 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"Gotta love cheap greasy food open late!

My husband and I frequently share the vegetarian meal which is enough for us both to feel full. We love the samosas, too. They're served with an onion chutney which is tasty. The meal comes with a lot - rice plus your choice of chapati (yum - we don't have it buttered but they'll do it that way for you) or paratha and raita and dal. The dal is quite tasty. My favorite dish is the Chole Masalewala - it's got a nice heat level and I find it tastier here than at Punjabi Dhaba which is one of my favorite cheap Indian restaurants. We usually eat at Rajdhani  Express (aka India Food & Spices) for under $10 together!\\n\\nWe also love the mango lassi - creamy and sweet but not too sweet. The owner seemed gruff to me my first time but I was very surprised when he came over to add the rest of the lassi from his blender into our drink and as we were paying a man behind the food counter offered us a taste of a sweet - they seemed excited to share their food and hospitality! I definitely enjoy supporting a local business, especially when the people working there seem to care about your satisfaction.

We also got the truffle and rosemary fries, which did not taste enough truffle-y.  The rosemary was not fresh and was sparse, but still had a good flavor.  We also shared the Southern Comfort and we had mixed feelings.  The BBQ was bland and should have more of a kick, yet again I was expecting more.  The mac-and-cheese was absolutely appalling and whomever called that mac-and-cheese should be ashamed. It was bland, over-cooked noodles, no taste, and stuck to the top of your mouth. The meat itself was some of the best I have had, it should have been cooked medium rather than well, and should have been seasoned, but still very juicy and fresh.  \\n\\n\\nAll in all: \\n5/10 for the buffalo grilled cheese\\n5/10 for the truffle and rosemary fries\\n7/10 for the southern comfort burger \\n5/10 for the service\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is a little small and awkward, so we ate outside and it was great.

I still believe sushi in Los Angeles is some of the best on the west coast by comparison.\\n\\nBeing somewhat of a sushi snob, I will say that I have never had bad sushi at Sinju. It isn't necessarily the best in Portland, but they are consistent and reliable. When yellowtail sashimi or nigiri is off, it's bad, and the yellowtail here has always tasted fresh with a buttery consistency and no fishy after taste. They can also make you handrolls by request. I recently ordered a couple of spicy tuna handrolls and it wasn't very spicy (there's often mayo and Sriracha mixed in with some sprouts) and not as traditional as more authentic sushi places, at least it was cone shaped and rolled properly, who rolls tube shaped handrolls anyways?! Presentation is always beautiful and there's a variety of specialty rolls for the more non-traditional enthusiast. And yes there is a difference between Krab and Crab, know it. House hot sake is house hot sake, they offer others along with the usual beer assortments. Tempura is a nice light crispy batter. Decor is modern and clean, the downtown location is more Japanese with private tatami styled seating rooms, while Bridgeport is just modern with a 'red room' bar area for the more lively guest and blue room in the back for the private parties. Plenty of seating all around. The front door is big and heavy.\\n\\nService is generally pretty attentive, friendly, and quick but can vary from staff to staff. I've never had bad service here, just maybe a little less experienced. Some will pour your first cup of sake (which is more traditional) and some have no idea. I'm always polite to service staff and think customers often over-expect or bring a bad attitude so when service is a little off they blow it out of proportion (try somewhere more authentic, chances are you won't even get served with such entitlements). Attire is generally casual while some people like to dress to the nines for date night. Pricing is average. Parking at Bridgeport is easier than the street locations, although it can get busy since it's shared with the entire mall and movie theatre. I've always found parking right near the entrance. Reservations are recommended but not required. They have a daily happy hour, but it's for the bar area only.

The chashu is fattier than other joints but wasn't terrible. The noodles were well cooked and had a good bite, typical of what you would want in a nice bowl of ramen. Beware however that it may seem like the ramen in general may seem less flavourful because there is less fat in the broth meaning that the broth won't coat the noodles as well!\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this joint to those looking for a cleaner alternative to the heavier more rich broths that you get at other joints such as Santouka, Kintaro or Ramen Jinya.

I had the pulled pork sandwich with the farm salad and broccoli cheese casserole as my sides.  The pulled pork was smokey and loaded with flavor.  You can tell a good pulled pork when you don't need to add any sauce.  There are three home made sauces on the table and I tried all three.  They were good but not spectacular; my favorite of the three was the Carolina vinegar sauce.  I ate most of my sandwich sans sauce. The farm salad was the perfect cold side.  Perfectly sauteed brussel spouts and greens with grapes and barley.  So good and light.  The broccoli cheese was very good, but heavy; I could not finish it all.  My boyfriend got the pulled pork tray with  mac and cheese as a side and we both agreed that it was missing something, almost that it was too cheesy with an overpowering cheese taste at the beginning - if that makes sense.  He had the cole slaw for his cold slide and it was very good.  Large pieces of red and green cabbage with a vinegar kick.  This is not a heavy, mayonnaise cole slaw.

In the past few years, however, they've switched to a slightly bland vegetarian soup. It's nowhere near as satisfying. The cuts of beef in the bulgogi are not what they once were. It feels like they've cut corners, and the service isn't very friendly anymore. We were regulars for a very long time, but they never really greeted us with familiarity- not a deciding factor in our feelings for the food, but we WOULD appreciate drink refills and refills on the side dishes. It's hard to flag them down sometimes. I totally understand that this place gets slammed and busy, but the service reflects a low morale, it feels. We pay more today for a lesser quality meal than we did just a few years ago for a far better quality AND service.

I just think that if he didn't know, or if he wasn't sure about something on the menu, he should have gone and asked, but he didn't offer to do this at all, so we were stuck playing the guessing game. \\n\\nI opted for Ramen, one of the questions I asked because it wasn't written on the menu was: \\"Does it come with vegetables or meats\\"?

Usually in most other establishments at least 2 people have to order Korean BBQ in order for them to do this. They give you all you can eat meats and side dishes but oddly enough white rice isn't included which I'm use to seeing in almost all Korean BBQ establishments, just seemed a bit odd. \\n\\nThey offer a mix of Japanese, Chinese, Korean entree's. One person in our party ordered Shrimp teriyaki which came with white rice and broccoli that was barely cooked, I notice that she left almost all of the broccoli behind, and for the price, the portion just didn't seem to match up, I could tell she was disappointed. \\n\\nMaybe they're still working out kinks as any new establishment does, so I'll wait a while before returning, and what seems to be worth the money in my opinion is the chinese hot pot, the Korean bbq, and the Ramen."},{"name":"Tasca Restaurant","address":"1612 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"Love love love this place!

An hour into being there (two of my friends and i were only inside the establishment for a combined 15 minutes, as we went outside for a bit) we were told there is a $15 minimum per person.  After asked if we could apply the whole table check amount to cover the $15 minimum,  the manager told us that they wouldn't allow that. We than told the manager that it should have been made clear from the very beginning of the expectations. She than proceeded to tell us that it was told to the birthday girl and it was her responsibility to relay this information to all 25+ of her guests. I explained that it should have also been written on the windedown Wednesday menus and/or also been told to each table. She than said they should have charged the birthday girl a deposit. I reminded the manager that if it hadn't been for the birthday girl the place would be dead. And I also said that she can go ahead and give me a check for $15, but that I would not pay it. She than said she would apply that to the birthday girl's tab and also would press legal charges. I told her to go ahead and call the cops, at this point she walked away without saying anything... They need to clearly state the $15 minimum.  It's not about the $, it's about how the manager handled the situation.  She could have just said she would allow the total table bill to cover the per person minimum.  And/or also inform us of their policy and just ask that we keep that in mind for next time, instead of threatening to put it on the birthday girl's bill and pursuing legal action.\\nVery disappointed how the situation was handled, especially with such a large party and almost everyone had ordered at least one thing to share and a drink.

I guess the place must have been improved, plus I like ramen so I gave it a try!\\n\\nNow I have eaten there 4 times (I rarely write reviews if I have only gone once, as it could be bad / good as a fluke), and I think they are worth more visits, plus a review too.\\n\\nI had tried tonkatsu ramen, miso ramen with butter, katsu-don, pork bone in hot pot set. Overall, all of them are pretty good. I actually like the not so salty tonkatsu soup, as I can taste the pork bone marrow in it. Of course the soup at Santouku is very flavourful but it's almost artificial as it has some fragrance in it, so it was hard to taste the pork bone marrow. I guess different people would prefer different style.\\n\\nThe noodle is not as with a bite as the one at Nan-Chuu, but the rest wins Nan-Chuu though. The pork slices are just right, and the rest are good too.\\n\\nThe katsu-don comes w/ some sides: miso soup, and a half marinated egg with running yolk, green soybean pods, and pickle (Japanese style). It was a large bowl and very filling. I rate it a better deal and value over the ramen (but ramen has been the fad in east Asia lately so that \\"value\\" is high of course).\\n\\nThe pork bone in hot pot is interesting. I never had it at any Japanese restaurant so I can't even say if it's authentic. I know some Taiwanese places have mini hot pot set just like this, so this is similar more to that than any Japanese dishes I know of. But anyway, it was not bad, quite home made style. Of course awkward to \\"play\\" with the bone to get to the meat, so definitely it's a cultural thing (plus whom you are with).\\n\\nLast time I also ordered a fried potato mashes. I was told there were two kinds so I just picked one of them. When the order arrived, it had only 2 pieces, so I wondered why the value on izakaya was so bad at this place while staple food was so good. I asked the waitress and she said they mistakenly made a mini order, and my regular order should have 4 pieces. So later we got a 3 pieces order (so we got a freebie one!). The interesting part is that the sauce is not the same on them. The first order only had some white (mayo?) on it, but the 2nd order had both white and dark one running across the top. I wonder why the treatment would be different too, even though it was a \\"mistake\\" order, but we didn't bother to find out. It is $4.95 so definitely not cheap (but expected).\\n\\nThe taste is ok. I was hoping for the kind of potato mash fried like what I had before, with minced meat and very flavourful. In a flat round shape, and not this long (rugby) shape.\\n\\nService has been quite nice, and I'm surprised as usually Chinese run shops are that consistent (I'm one of them, I know!). Polite and friendly. They also come to pour tea from time to time, unlike some places (like Golden Bauhinia that I just reviewed, you never got more tea unless you find someone to ask). Sometimes they are full and customer has to wait a bit, but still they didn't ignore you.\\n\\nAs far as small restaurants go, this one really surprises me. I never expected the food nor the service to be at this level. I thought it was just going to be yet another so called Japanese restaurant, especially Chinese run. Yes, I am surprised. The service is even better than the Sushi House, which is Japanese run (and within the same mall). Sometimes even at Kiyo I got bad service and they are expensive!\\n\\nOne thing about the menu: if you follow the picture and thought the item listed next to it must be the one, then you are wrong. My dining companion (an elderly man) did exactly that, and ordered something else he thought was on the picture. I hope they put pictures on a separate page with the item listed next to the picture also.\\n\\nYou just never know from guessing. So I echoed with Joann L this sentiment.

The food was excellent and no matter what you order, I believe that the waitstaff does take into account how much you order and how far along you are in your meal as I noticed our portions became smaller with each successive round.   While the place was surprisingly larger than I expected in terms of seating, I would suggest that you keep your parties no larger than 6-8 as there are limited large table areas.   My biggest complaint was that the soap dispensers did not work at all in the men's restroom and from what I was told by a fellow female diner that the dispenser in the women's side barely have any soap either.   Now I did alert a few employees to this situation and hey acted like they were taking care of it but on my subsequent trip post meal to wash up there still wasn't a working soap dispenser.   Keep in mind that there is a big sign posted asking employees to wash hands before returning to the kitchen but what's the point if there is no soap?

First time ever actually ordering and then carrying out. I walk in, first thing I see is a garbage can right by the bench where a customer would sit to wait for food. On the other side are empty boxes and a bag of trash. Nothing disgusting, just looks like packing stuff. Still looks awful for a customer experience. I was greeted and told to check out the handheld menus for coupons. Sweet! That's when I see a room that I think is the bathroom with more trash. I almost left but the smell was too good. I go to counter and a man meets me there and promptly looks down giving me the bill of his hat as a greeting. I stand there puzzled a good minute or two. Finally he looks up and is surprised asking if I'm ready to order. I nod and he walks away to talk to someone else. About a minute after another guy comes up apologizing for the wait but gets puzzled with my coupon request. Enter the original guy that greeted me. He sets me up and all is well. I take a seat a ways away from the garbage. Next thing I know a discussion takes place amongst employees about the tip jar and what happened to all the money in it. Weird but whatever. Then all of the sudden a guy comes out on the way to the bathroom joking around with me asking if I want to bet $10 if he makes a shot into the garbage. Me being a gambler was intrigued, but my wallet begged me to decline which I did. He then shoots something, misses, then bounces off towards me. I lament the loss of money but suddenly realize I have no idea what was in that wad of garbage he just threw and almost hit me, a customer, with. He smiles, apologies and cleans up, but that's still weird right? Finally the pizza is ready and the original greeter guy says it was ready, places it on the counter, then walks away. I say thanks and what seems like an afterthought he returns my thanks wishing me a good night.

I just moved to Boston a few months ago and this place, even though I don't live here, makes me feel at home. It's probably because everyone here is super nice and friendly, or maybe I just like the coffee and the tea (the Somerville Smog is pretty darn delicious). It's probably the combination of everything, including: the artwork, the pool tables, the board games, and the photo booth.\\n\\nAnyways, the only downside is that it can be hard to find a table. This normally wouldn't be a problem if I were closer, but when I make my trek here and can't find a table, my heart breaks just a tiny bit. I usually just end up walking around for awhile, hoping that when I come back, a table will open up.

We ordered two hot cocoas... But never got them.  Didn't even get water, actually.\\n\\nWe asked if we could just order right now and the gal said we could.  My young daughter and I ordered a stack of hotcakes and a side of bacon... Making certain to tell her we were sharing the large portion.  Food took an awfully long time, especially since it was a simple order, right off the menu with no substitutions or anything.  When the food did finally arrive the bacon was brought first (super thin (see through!), puddle of grease on the plate with it) and then a few moments goes by before someone dropped the pancake plate at the table as they rushed by without even hesitating to ask if we needed anything else... an extra plate would have been nice, at the least... or my cocoa.\\n\\nNo one came back by the table to check on us and ask if everything was all right.  In fact, we thought it was quite strange that with (at least) 8 employees in the place we literally did not see or hear a single one of them for the entire time we were eating.  When we were finished with our food we waited... and waited... and waited more for someone to come back.  Just as I was getting up to go to the front counter and request our bill I saw our server come around the corner and get on the computer.

She said she couldnt do it and had to go find our server.  She picked up a phone and asked someone something, then turned back to us and asked how everything was (A first for the evening!!).  So I told her.  \\"We waited a long time to be sat, the pancakes were extremely dry and the bacon grossly oiled, we never got our ordered drinks, let alone some water, no one checked on us and we were going to be late getting to the airport at this point while we are waiting on their employees, again\\".\\n\\nAt this point our server finally made an appearance.

There is NO NEED to employ at least 8 people in the front of the house on such a slow night... some of them could have been sent home early to save some funds from the company coffer being spent on them hanging out in the kitchen and doing nothing constructive.\\n2.  With those saved funds from sending people home early when they arent needed you should think about hiring a group who is more attuned to customer service and has some pride in what they do, and the want to take care of their customers appropriately.\\n3.

The Gnocchi Sorrentino.  This massive tray of plump little potato pasta is at least two meals, and that is if you are a heavy hitter like me.  If not you may be able to feed your village.  But it's not just quantity, not by a long shot.  The quality is right up there with any other pasta dish I have ever had, including the Chicken Ashby from Lil' Vinny's (RIP sniffle).  It is a very simple dish of pillowy gnocchi saut√©ed in garlic basil and tomato sauce, but like most great Italian food, it's beauty is in its simplicity, letting the ingredients speak for themselves.  You really do get a great fresh tomato garlic and basil taste coming through without a lot of unnecessary seasoning.  If you are like me and generally feel you need a protein on the plate, you can add some meat for a nominal fee.  \\n\\nAlso, the pasta alfredo is not to be missed.

I have ordered only through Foodler so I can't speak to their over the phone professionalism, nor can I speak to the establishment itself having never set foot inside.

Thank you, Tiffani, for teaching me that I like brussels sprouts.  The farm salad with arugula, roasted brussels sprouts, farro, halved grapes, and pecorino romano was the best salad I've had in quite a while.  Same with the mac and cheese, which was silky and delicious.  I do wish it was served on something flatter, so that you could get more of the crunchy bread crumb topping.  I probably wouldn't bother with the biscuits with honey butter next time.\\n\\nAs for the mains, I tried both the pulled pork and the half chicken.  I thought the pork was a little dry and fatty (though the sauces were fantastic), and the chicken didn't have enough flavor. \\n\\nOne other thing.  Because I got the tray of pulled pork, it came with something that was essentially white wonder bread.  I'm torn.  I know that it's traditional, but it sucks to make a sandwich out of that bread, especially if it's not at least toasted.

It can get crowded on the weekends, but I have never seen the staff get anywhere close to impatient, short, or even ruffled.\\n\\n2. Its super cheap. Every time you see the check you will think you were undercharged. Brunch for 2 for less than $15 that will fill anyone up - you can't beat that around here.\\n\\n3. The home fries are the best you will ever have. Perfectly crispy potatoes mixed with a whole bunch of charred vegetables. The vegetables change by the season, and so they never get boring - tomatoes, spinach, squash, brussels sprouts, carrots, onions, peppers, asparagus - they all rotate through. Top with their really good unique homemade hot sauce and you have the perfect plate of home fries.\\n\\n4. The other food is ridiculously good as well. My favorite is 'The 35' breakfast sandwich - eggs, cheese, bacon, and more charred vegetables sandwiched between two perfectly buttered and toasted slices of bread.

I wanted to post something for you all that would describe the food and give an idea of what to expect. I'm sure I'll be back to post more great things about Renata. \\n\\nI went with my husband and my good friends Julie and Michael. We were really excited to see the new restaurant and try the food.  We started out with all 4 of the Stuzzi (little bites) the accompaniment to the crispy pork terrine was over salted but would be a great flavor combo with less salt, the venitian battered favas were really good who doesn't like fried and aioli?! The crudite with whipped lard was the favorite of the table and the liver wurst crostini was a close second!! I would have liked a piece of bread with the crudite- to spread the whipped lard after the veggies were gone it was better than I imagined it would be. The meal started really well.\\n\\nWe decided to skip Tavola and Antipasti and head straight for the pasta! First let me say there was a lot of hot debate over what to order because we shared everything. Sharing is suggested but you don't have to share. We got the porchetta agnolotti - it was good but a little heavy handed with the salt. I would order it again to find out if it improves. We shared the squid ink chitarra-which was a subject of debate because someone at the table wasn't into the idea of squid ink pasta - this dish made them a believer! It was really tasty, the clams and salumi were a nice compliment to one another. Originally I wanted the ravioli and asked our waiter a couple of questions about it but was out voted so did not include the ravioli in our order but somehow the chef knew I needed to try the Amazing ravioli so he sent over a plate. The dipio ravioli with fava porcini ricotta and mint were out of this world. It's a double ravioli - one side fava ricotta mint and the other is porcini - it was fabulous!!!! Order the ravioli and write a poem about its fabulosity!\\n\\nWe moved on to entrees from the hearth and   Fire oven. We had the halibut with beans that were cooked nicely they still had some bite and were well flavored. The halibut was cooked perfectly with a crispy top, moist and buttery inside. I was really looking forward to the mussels - they are one of my favorite types of seafood. This entree was ho hum. First off I think they were a little over salted and lacked punch. There was horseradish grated on top and that was a great start but near the bottom of the bowl the horse radish was gone and the broth was just okay. Sopping up broth with bread is usually a must with mussels and while we still sopped it didn't live up to the table's expectations. After all that food my husband decided we should try the steak so we ordered another round of drinks and waited for the beef bavette - the steak was really good and I loved the turnips 2 ways on the plate the general consensus was for the price we thought there should have been a little more steak. \\n\\nFinally we ordered dessert - it's not something I have to try. I tend toward the savory food options but the men at the table wanted something sweet and ordered the olive oil cake with zabiliglione(sp?) and strawberries. They also ordered some lemon and fried donut type thing- I don't have the menu so I can't remember the name. Both were good but the olive oil cake won the taste off. I think the lemony donuts were good but needed more lemon\\nGo and check it out for yourself- mangia!!\\nUpdated to 5 stars because I have been thinking about that dinner a lot and it was fantastic."},{"name":"Olive & June","address":"3411 Glenview Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"A great dining experience; delicious food, wonderful environment, perfect service.

The Sunday prix fixe menu looked great, and the chef did not fail to deliver.  Both the pasta and the cornish game hen were wonderfully prepared: the pasta was perfectly al dente with a superb wine sauce; the roasted hen was crispy on the ouside, but moist and juicy on the inside, beautifully seasoned and with flavorful sides.  The dessert, strawberry rhubarb torta, was very good, although not my favorite.  The antipasti was also quite nice: the butter lettuce fresh, with an excellent garlic dressing, but the chilled carrot soup was a star.\\n\\nSo why wasn't it 5-star? It comes down to the service.  First, no serving implements were served with the antipasti, which like all the courses, was served \\"family style.\\" When we asked for serving utensils, since we were a party of four, the server suggested we use our \\"eating\\" forks to serve ourselves.\\n\\nThe pasta was also served sans serving implements, but a different server noted that and without asking brought us serving tongs...not the most efficient implement for pappardelle, but better than our eating forks.  The cornish game hens did automatically come with tongs.\\n\\nSecond, the pace of the service was very rushed, even though only a few tables in the interior, where we were seated, were occupied, and few others came in as we ate.  We had no time to relax with our meal and contemplate the experience.  Couses came quickly after finishing the previous dish, and in at least once case, before the last of our party had finished hers.  The frantic pace continued for all courses, except for a very leisurely wait for the dessert.  The server also had a pechant for removing finished plates of guests while others were still eating...not what I would expect from a restaurant of this caliber, but consistent with the rushed pace of the service.\\n\\nThird: one of our party asked if she could have some extra salad as a replacement for the zucchini parmesan, since she couldn't eat tomatoes.  The server thought that would be OK, and returned to the kitchen to fetch a bit more salad.  She returned shortly, saying kitchen wanted to know \\"Why can't she eat tomatoes?\\". The guest is allergic to tomatoes, but it seemed to us, challenging a guest in this way is not very customer-friendly.\\n  \\nWould I consider going back when in Austin in the future? Yes!

I've never understood that method but the obesity epidemic explains it pretty well. \\n\\nService was subpar. When seated, we ordered \\"water...for now\\" but a drink menu was never brought and we were never asked, nor had the opportunity to ask, for drinks, since we rarely saw the waitress.\\n\\nThe food was good, but we ordered plainly...lasagna, spaghetti...it's hard to mess that up. Would like to go back and try something else.\\n\\nWe took home a bag full of food that could feed a family of 4 for a couple of days. So there's that.

We tried the pan seared tuna over black bean/mango salad, roasted duck, escargots, lamb sausage over couscous, brie with apple and raisin chutney with grilled baguette, and spring roll (seasonal special). Everything was delicious with great flavors. My favorites were the lamb sausage and spring rolls. Brie and apple on bread is always good, but I dont think this was any more special here than other places I have had it. \\n\\nI recommend coming with a somewhat larger group so you can try more tapas OR just bring a big appetite :D We ordered 6 tapas to share between 3 of us and it was okay;  know I could have eaten more of the tasty foods. \\n\\nTip 1: Check in on YELP and get a free dessert of your choice!

One previous reviewer is correct, many of the ingredients are unrecognizable and not easily pronounced.  And the descriptions aren't easily discernible for what you will receive, in my opinion.\\n\\nThe portions are very small, and, for that, the prices are high.  This is a foodie place, for sure.  I guess it just went a little above my head.\\n\\nI met a group of four other women there.  We had made reservations, but there is definitely plenty of space (it was a Wednesday night, as well).  We sat inside, but the patio outside is lovely.\\n\\nTo start, we shared the seafood mixto with argula and lemon. The fried seafood and aioli were great.  I expected more of a 'salad' with the description of arugula, but there were only a few sprigs.  We also shared the cheese and meat plate.  It was alright.  The cheeses were outstanding, but they have house-made mortadella which didn't look appetizing.  And the accompanying condiments were a little odd for me (quince and fennel preserves).  Both of these items were supposed to be 1/2 price for happy hour, but we realized after we left that they charged us full price.  That was disappointing.\\n\\nI had the farm egg polenta with mushrooms (from the appetizer section) for my entree. It was very good - reminiscent of a similar dish at Hillside Farmacy.  I also ordered from the one-bite portions, a semolina gnocchi. I thought it would be gnocchi.  It was actually a triangle of...more polenta.   My bad for ordering, but a description of the items would help!  It tasted fine, just not what I expected.\\n\\nMy fellow dining mates had various pastas: gemelli (sp?) with sausage, spaghetti with tomato sauce, goat cheese whole wheat ravioli.  Everyone seemed to like their dishes.  The ravioli definitely got the most raves.\\n\\nTwo desserts were shared (which I didn't taste) - panacotta (everyone who had it loved it, but it was hard to tell what all was on the plate-- the presentation was a bit too artsy!) and the trio of gelato.  The chocolate disappointed my friend who ordered it and didn't realize it would have cardamom and cayenne in it (again, a description would help!), but the others enjoyed it.\\n\\nThe presentation of the food can be beautiful (if sometimes a bit much), the ambiance is great (the restaurant is gorgeous), the service is impeccable (our waiter was outstanding, despite forgetting a few items and charging us full price for HH items), and the complimentary valet parking takes a load off trying to park in a busy neighborhood.

Oh, and we were not disappointed with the food. \\n\\nWe went for some of the more exotic rolls, like mussels, avocado, squid, etc. with lots of heat.  And then we ordered more, because it was that good.  While not quite as unusual as Uchi, this is still some of the best sushi/sashimi I've ever had.  It's not cheap, of course, but if you come for lunch you can get out for $20/person or so.  And unlike a surprising number of Asian restaurants, they do serve beer and sake.  Yay, team.\\n\\nAll the while, we were able to watch the Japanese-Americans (presuming they were American and not native Japanese) conducting business, playing out their lunch dates, working on presentations, and the like.

My favorite worker is the guy with the goatee, he's awesome, always puts enough of everything and makes it nice. \\n\\nI always get the meatball pasta bowl but I add mostly everything. Red sauce, a little basil sauce and a little creamy parm sauce. Then I \\"drag it through the garden.\\" I'm glad they don't limit me on my love for fresh toppings.\\n\\nMake sure to say, \\"I want ____, but I'm doing a 'create your own'\\" if you want different sauces, otherwise they'll assume you want exactly what it states on the menu. Mention it FIRST THING before they pick up the bowl! Otherwise, you'll get sauces that you may not be in the mood for. Although I haven't had a sauce I don't like yet. Some of them don't speak English well, so pointing and being very visual (and polite!) (head nod yes, or shake head no) with them is good. This is a very interactive place. I don't recommend hermits (shy peeps) come here unless they want that one thing on the menu exactly how it's stated. Be prepared to ask for more or to repeat yourself. They're eager to please and very nice about it, just don't dilly dally and try your best to be clear!\\n\\nThe price is pretty good, $9 each time I go for 1 meal + small snack later for what I don't finish. I guess my suggestion is to include a garlic option. Their calamari is good but the breading gets to me after a few bites, way too much. Same with their soups, they're super rich. I mean, it's good, but it's so much. Maybe that's a positive for some peeps. The salad is fresh but just tastes funny after a while. Just keep in mind that everything is pretty rich in flavor, which is great for the first few bites, but can get old. It's not so overbearing for the pasta, so it's a solid staple that I really enjoy. \\n\\nI wish they'd change the forks they use!Eeeevvveeery time I put my fork in my tub and close the lid to eat it later, one or more of the prongs breaks.

They didn't skimp on the tofu, either. Green tea is served at no charge. You also get a mixed green salad, which I will skip in the future. You get warm, damp towels for your hands -- love that! The entree is more than I could eat (we had katsudon). It was excellent. There are so many options on the menu and I can't wait to try some other items. Just when we thought we were done, a frosted dish of ice cream was brought to us to finish off our meal. The prices on the food are extremely reasonable -- none of this charging a fortune for some chicken and rice that is cooked in front of you and you pay for the \\"show.\\" Also, go next door to the grocery store called Tomato (pronounced toh-mah'-toh).

What an awful experience. \\n\\nMy last dinner at Bubbalou's Apopka was pretty lousy. In a nutshell, we waited 55 minutes for food. When I asked for a manager, I was told he was too busy. They reduced the check by 25% and apologized, and the food was good, so I decided to try them again tonight. \\n\\nParty of 5, including Wife, children and Buddy. Sign said to wait to be seated but we were told to seat ourselves. A waitress appeared, 5 minutes later, with menus. I ordered corn nuggets and we ordered drinks. \\n\\nDrinks come out, then waitress comes to take meal order. \\n\\nI settled on the pulled pork basket with fries and beans; kiddos shared a chicken strip basket; Wife choose pulled pork with fries and mac; Buddy choose smoked sausage with beans and mac. Appetizer showed up while ordering. They were delicious. We gobbled them up. \\n\\nAfter talking for a while. We noticed about 20 minutes had passed, which is odd for pulled pork. Well, in my opinion, anyhow, as pulled pork isn't a single serving preparation. I looked for our server but she was in the weeds. \\n\\nAnother 15 or 20 minutes pass before or food comes. No utensils, just food. I touch the pork, and is barely room temperature. Brands are the same. I flag down a waitress and tell her to just return my food, as everyone else will be done by the time a new basket comes out. She offers no apology, nor a manager, but does take the food.  Our waitress comes, and Wife says her fries are cold and pork is too. Still no utensils, so Buddy is just sitting and waiting. Still no food for the children either. \\n\\nFive minutes later, all three dishes come out hot, but no manager and no utensils. I'm too angry, at this point, so I decline my meal. Wife and children take their meals. \\n\\nBuddy gets up and finds utensils at this point. The fellow that I suspect as the manager, is bussing a couple of tables. I say, loud enough to be heard,  \\"I wonder why the manager hasn't come to the table,\\" but to no avail. \\n\\nWaitress offers an apology, and I apologize for being angry. I say \\"it's frustrating that the fid took forever and came out cold,\\" and she responds with \\"yea, Fridays are crazy\\". I state my dissatisfaction that the manager never came, and she explains that he's all over the place and points to him bussing another table,  followed by getting himself a drink at the tea station right next to the table!\\n\\nOn a side note, I observed 24 tables in the main dining room and the servers. That's 8 tables to a station. The manager seemed to primarily be a bus boy. My advice, after two very lousy visits: staff your restaurant accordingly. Food shouldn't come out cold. Pulled pork shouldn't ever take 20 minutes to serve, let alone 40. If a table asks, repeatedly, for a manager, the manager needs to come to the table! \\n\\nNo pictures tonight, as I didn't get to eat anything. \\n\\nI can't imagine returning to this establishment. \\n\\nWant good BBQ?

The Puerto Vallarta is a wonderful dish with shrimp, tilapia, and other assorted yummies, with melted cheese on top. Their margaritas are also really good.\\n\\nOh, and if you want a free burrito, just finish their Mucho Macho burrito (basically filled with meat and salsa/hot sauce, and covered in hot sauce). If you eat the whole thing, it's free! They have lists of people's names on the wall who have finished it. A tip: get something on the side to cool the heat, like a cheese dip or sour cream or something.\\n\\nRegarding the service times other people have mentioned, it was really slow one time when we arrived within 30 minutes of close and they were busy cleaning up and putting things away (I imagine...) but aside from that, I have never had a problem with slow service or anything. I have been at many different times, too - sometimes busy, sometimes crowded - but if they had slow service before, they've definitely gotten some more help since.\\n\\nBy the way, I'm from San Diego, so I have somewhat discriminating taste when it comes to these places, and I'm also living on a grad student budget so I can't go out to eat much.

Personally I think that it can get a little too loud when full, but I suppose that's what the owners are going for or else they would've put up some wall hangings by now.  They might want to consider it though because yelling across the table to your date/dining companion can get old real fast.\\nThe tappas are fantastic and about $5-7 a piece.  Personally I recommend the fried calamari.  The portion is huge so definitely plan on sharing.  Or if you want to go for the entrees, they're equally awesome and inexpensive considering the quality of food prepared.\\nDid I mention sangria?  Sooooo much sangria (and you need a lot because it's not very strong at all).  The pitchers, like everything else in the restaurant, are really inexpensive and usually there's a special for $1 or free pitchers if you join their mailing list...so I'd get on that.  And yes, it is typically a girly drink but it's a Spanish restaurant and you'd be selling yourself short if you didn't indulge.\\nBe on the lookout for Flamenco dancing, music and Spanish wine tastings which pop up every now and again.\\nDefinitely a good place to hit up if you've never been."},{"name":"Jim & Patty's Coffee","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing food,coffee, bake goods and smoothies.

Last night was surprisingly sub-par in three ways: Very slow service, high prices, and some misses on the food.\\nMaybe someone called out of work, but once promptly seated via our reservation, the wait times for service of any kind were interminable. Drinks, apps, dinner, and desserts took just under three hours, and not by our choice or lingering. We weren't complaining or obviously in a hurry, but there were multiple 15+ minute stretches where we were left to long for water or drinks while being completely ignored. Are the staff really not trained how to touch a table often enough to make people feel valued, even when the kitchen is backed up? When she WAS helping us, Erin seemed very rushed, and wasn't going out of her way to talk to us about the menu or our preferences. During those long absences, we thought we saw her doing dishes and the like in the kitchen, so like I said maybe someone was out of work last night? But they need to staff better either way, because the five people on duty last night could NOT do all their required jobs to a reasonable standard.\\nThis was made more noticeable by the rising prices on the menu. Not tremendously so, but enough to add up. When you go to someplace where your dinner bill passes $50 per person, you expect an even higher level of attentiveness and a certain flair and finesse to the food's presentation. Those were all lacking last night, so the $$$-level prices hurt even more.\\nFinally, the food was surprisingly lacking in seasoning. Only the fries (\\"chips\\") were perfectly cooked and seasoned; all the other apps, entres, and sides we tried needed pepper... salt... spices... almost ANYthing to get it back to where it was a year ago, and once again do Scotland proud. Even their mighty haggis has fallen into blandness, with hardly a hint of the gamey, livery goodness that it should bring proudly to the table, and cheapened with far too many diced potatoes inside where more pin oats and organ meats should be. Just not worth $17 alone I'm afraid.\\nJason, I want to love your place again. Please bring in some more people to handle busy nights, and get on the kitchen to taste what's going out and bring more value and consistency back.\\nWon't wait so long to try again, but next time may BE \\"so long\\" if things don't improve."},{"name":"Taco Bell","address":"1330 Stoneridge Drive","city":"Gahanna","stars":"2.5","text":"It's edible, but it's not great.

Been on my summer ATL food adventure bucket list.  I was so happy that Atlanta finally has a poke bowl & sushi burrito spot.  Finally!  I was sad though to find out that next Sunday is their last week.  Nooooooooooooo.  I would love to see Appa's, a Poke Bowl & Sushi Burrito pop-up restaurant, set up a brick and mortar.  \\n\\nWe headed there a little early to \\"beat the rush\\" and boy, were we late to the party.  The pop-up restaurant doesn't open up shop until 5:30 pm but there was already a line wrapped around the Irwin Market \\"courtyard.\\"  It was warm and the sun was out.  I was enjoying myself.  The owners even had a big jug of water, cups, & menu outside which was a nice touch.  So then it started to rain but fear not.  In ATL hospitality fashion people were willing to share their big umbrellas.    Very cool.  Also, maybe it was because of the rain but they opened the doors about 10 min early instead of making everyone wait longer while getting wet.  Another nice touch.  When we finally made it through the doors I felt like I was granted into the clear zone of the best ride at Universal Studios or a club.  Loved how the music was bumping and Appa was dancing from a distance.  I liked how warm and inviting the space was.  Also, the A/C felt good too.  Not gonna lie.  Hehe.  It literally felt like I walked into someone's open floor home.  (Yes, I'm a fan of HGTV shows).  Love it!  While we waited to place our order we got closer to see the action in the exposed kitchen area where all the magic was happening.  Appa- the head chef was jamming and bopping to the music all the while not skipping a beat on his dope sushi burrito making skills.  Loved his energy and focus.  This group of 5 behind the counter was rhythmic in their operations.  They were all super friendly, warm, and helpful especially the two I spoke to- the gentleman taking all orders at the counter & lovely lady that was calling out names when the orders were ready.  Man, she had the warmest smile ever.  How they all kept their cool and calm & collected while helping every customer and making/assembling poke bowls, sushi burrito, nachos, and hand rolls was beyond me and the most impressive.  Never saw them get flustered or overwhelmed.  Not even once.  Very impressive.  Especially when the place was packed and there were still many customers waiting outside. Everything really had a good flow.  Didn't see one upset customer in site either.  That's rare.\\n\\nFood-  We ordered two poke bowls.  One with tuna and a savory sauce and the other one with salmon and a sweet & spicy sauce.  We also ordered a tuna sushi burrito with the sweet & spicy sauce.  Also, they partnered with a private dessert maker and this Sunday's option was green tea macaron.  I really enjoyed everything.  Seriously.  Everything was fresh, flavorful, & pretty filling.  Love how generous they were with the yummy goodies in the poke bowl and the burrito.  The rice to filling ratio was awesome on both the bowl and burrito.  It was such a yummy layered flavor each bite of the poke bowl.  Great ensemble.  Loved the crunch.  Also, it was pretty to look at it while tearing it up.  I felt the poke bowls and burrito that we had were truly made just for us.  Also, the sauces are good.  They offer extra savor or spicy sauce if you want.\\n\\nI literally felt every bite I took of the poke bowl and sushi burrito was truly a labor of love.  I ate with my eyes, mouth, & heart.  Fell in love with the concept, the family run business set up, and their delicious food.  Really really really hope they will set up a permanent spot in the ATL."},{"name":"Sabatinos Italian Restaurant","address":"895 Main St","city":"Waltham","stars":"3","text":"chicken fingers = homemade  chicken cutlets\\n\\nso bomb!\\n\\nbest chicken cutlets/ fingers/ milanesas in town..\\n\\nholler! :)"},{"name":"Sweet Cheeks Q","address":"1381 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I like Sweet Cheeks.

This comes with a very dark broth that's supposed to go well with the noodles. The taste wasn't too different from your typical Miso broth but there was a smokey taste in there which was interesting to say the least. Noodles here tasted a little oily compared to Santouka, Hida Takayama, andShibuyatei which affected their absorption of the broth. I'm not sure if the charcoal has anything to do with that. The chashu was a little dry but the soft-boiled egg delivered quite well in terms of gooey-ness.  The Japanese gyoza was pretty tasty. There's no soup trapped inside and so it's full of meat; my favourite! The vinegar added a nice sour layer to the savoury meat and I'd recommend this as a good dish to share.

We don't like to spend a fortune on dinner since we do eat out a lot, and the prices at Carrabba's are really reasonable, especially when you consider that almost all entrees come with soup (homemade from scratch and delicious) or salad, plus a vegetable.\\n\\nFor us though, the main draw is the consistently wonderful food at Carrabba's.  We were initially hesitant because we knew it was a chain, and many if not most chains aren't that impressive to us.  But we were hooked right away.  Everything we've ordered (and we've tried a lot of entrees) has been top notch.  And when a manager gave us a copy of the Carrabba's cookbook a year ago as a gift (because we eat here so often), and I read it cover to cover, I knew why the food is so great.  Carrabba's really takes the time and money to source great ingredients, from their olive oil that comes from Spain, to their balsamic vinegar that comes from Modena, Italy, to their Parmesan cheese and mussels.  Their basil is fresh (they chop loads of it daily).  They make all of their food from scratch -- from all of their sauces, which they  make fresh every day, to their fabulous soups (my husband and I make lentil soup using our own recipe, and Carrabba's is as good as ours which is saying a lot).  The tomato basil soup is scrumptious.  And even the salads are great -- we usually get the Italian salad with our entrees, and it uses fresh spring mix, kalamata olives, red onion, cherry tomatoes, and I think even carrots, cucumber and celery -- lots of fresh ingredients.  The vinaigrette dressing is perfect.\\n\\nOh, and a manager told us that microwave ovens are not allowed in Carrabba's, and that very little of their ingredients are frozen; they prefer to use fresh ingredients.  Winner in my book.  I think when the Mandolo and Carrabba founders franchised their original restaurant in Houston, they must have specified that their family recipes would not be changed and that the ingredients and preparation would remain the same.\\n\\nAnd the entrees -- I could go on and on about some of the fabulous entrees we've had here.  (And after reading the recipes for many of them in the cookbook, I'm even more impressed -- not easy to make many of them, and a lot of detail in the preparation.)  The Chicken Bryan and Chicken Marsala are staples in our rotation; the marsala sauce is so good that I always ask for extra on the side.  And the specials at Carrabba's, which change every three months or so, are consistently wonderful.  The prosciutto-wrapped pork tenderloin with a to-die for sauce (I think it was cherries and port) is sadly gone, but my fingers are crossed that they'll bring it back sometime.  Hands-down one of the best entrees I've ever had in my life, period.  The current potato-crusted haddock special is now tied with the pork tenderloin.  How they get the shredded potatoes to so perfectly coat the haddock filet, I don't know.  They then brown it until the potatoes are golden brown and crispy and top it off with a wonderful, light sauce.  I'm getting this one every time we eat at Carrabba's until it's off the specials menu.\\n\\nFinally, hubby and I are both gluten free (so sadly we can no longer eat the heavenly piping hot bread here), and the kitchen staff at Carrabba's bend over backwards to customize dishes for us.  For example, the potato crusted haddock has flour as an ingredient, but when I made a sad face upon learning that, our waitress said \\"let me check with the chef and see if he might be able to make it for you without the flour.\\"  She came back and said they'd try but weren't sure how it would turn out, but they were game if I was.  And the most beautiful piece of haddock crusted with golden browned potatoes arrived on my plate and I was in heaven.  The missing flour didn't affect the dish at all.  Carrabba's has a fairly extensive GF printed menu (and their staff in every restaurant have been trained on gluten and how to avoid cross-contamination, so they really take it seriously for those of you with Celiac).  But on top of that, they will customize just about any dish to make it gluten free.\\n\\nLastly, the wait staff here is very good.  Some waiters are among the best we've had anywhere.\\n\\nI've sung the praises of Carrabba's enough.  Just go there!"},{"name":"Maekha Thai","address":"163 Squire Rd","city":"Revere","stars":"4","text":"Try their Thai iced tea please!!!

There wasn't too many spices that made it overwhelming, but it was a fairly simple soup dish, a nice warm start to my meal. Consisted with a few perfectly softly cooked shrimps and mushrooms. \\nI ordered the Maekha fried rice with chicken and that exceeded my expectations. Everything put together was very good and very filling! It wasn't bland, it wasn't too bitter, and it wasn't too spicy. Sure there's few spices inside but it didn't make it like hot spicy LOL. Me gusta. \\nMy friends ordered a bunch of other things and we shared here and there. Pad see you was alright, a little on the burnt side. Pad Thai was okay, too sweet for me. Drunken noodle was pretty damn good! Except for when my friend bit on a chili pepper. Haha. \\nLastly we ordered some green tea fried ice cream. I'm really surprised they had something like green tea fried ice cream at a Thai restaurant. The batter was a little too thick and the ice cream was a bit tasteless but I still ate the whole thing. \\nWhen I first walked in I asked for a table for 9 and I wish I called in earlier before coming in, I didn't expect this place to be small. It's fine that we had to sit in 2 separate tables not a problem. I'm glad that the owner was so nice to us and really friendly! He came to our table (and probably every other table) and had short simple conversations with them and it's really chill to see someone do that. Not only the owner but the waitresses were really nice as well and helped us out with dinner for a toddler. \\nThis place is also really different because the atmosphere is definitely more modern than a typical Thai restaurant. This is more fancy and on the Western-style fusion if that makes any sense LOL. Oh and they played older music, not like 1900s era but music from like the 80s or something.

Some of my favorite fries in all of Orlando.  Ask for them extra crispy if you like crunchy fries.  The fries were actually the highlight of all the items I ate.\\n\\nTurkey Burger with Jack cheese was just ok.  Dennys and Ruby Tuesday's both have a much better turkey burger patty in terms of taste.  The bun was amazing!\\n\\nHamburger with swiss cheese, portabello mushrooms, and carmelized onions aka \\"The Bella\\".  The beef patty was good sized, it was cooked as I asked which was medium.  The patty was juicy, but unfortunately no flavor!  The bun that came on my sandwich was the same as the bun on the turkey burger and again..... amazing bun and one of the best I've had.  I would try this sandwich again with a different cheese selection.\\n\\nThe drink cups were small and the kind that get sweaty and drip all over you and your car if you decide to take your drink home.  Larger styrofoam cups would be a welcomed change.  They do have a Coke Freestyle machine which is nice, but they only have one machine and again the dining area is as tight as Subway, so if it's busy prepare to stand in line for awhile.  \\n\\nSo all in all, 2 sandwiches, 1 fry, 1 mac n cheese, and 2 drinks = almost $24.  We wouldn't get the mac n cheese next time which would bring the total to closer to $20 which is better.\\n\\n If you want bold flavor this isn't the place.  I've had better burgers almost anywhere.  The staff seemed genuine and friendly and I have no complaints there.  Again, I don't understand what all the hype is with this restaurant.  Give it a try and see if you agree.  By the sound of many of the reviews here on Yelp for this spot, I would say they either work here, are friends of the owner, or they've never gotten out of the house for a burger before."},{"name":"Sinju Japanese Restaurant","address":"7339 SW Bridgeport Rd","city":"Tigard","stars":"3","text":"3 min to be seated \\n7.5 minutes before i got some water\\n(10.5 minutes wasted)\\nThe table next to us who just sat down got drinks in less than 1 minute!!!

Service I won't comment on as it was a buffet so not much interaction.  On top of the poor food, the furnishings are plain worn out.  Stone table tops had lost their sheen, carpet needs replacing, even the dishes and silver ware could use replacement.

I had a few questions about wi-fi and where to wait for my food and instead of feeling stupid for asking (might just be a complex I have about thinking everyone knows I'm not \\"from around here\\") they were super friendly and obliging.\\n\\nComputer friendly: This is definitely a wireless \\"hotspot\\" with a few pitfalls: lack of outlets (to be expected of a building built a long, longtime ago), wi-fi is not free (it's pretty cheap $8/day or $5/hour but that could get pricey if you came daily or several times a week).  They offer a monthly rate but can't recall the price. I didn't mind paying this one time since I didn't know better but if I lived in the area I might try to find a place that offered free wi-fi.\\n\\nFood: so-so. I had the Monkey Wrench sandwich with turkey, avocado (of course), sprouts and tomatoes.  I opted for no cheddar. The ingredients were nice and fresh but the baguette was chewy and took away from what would have been a great sando.

If you like chewing and chewing and chewing then it may be for you, otherwise, I'd recommend skipping it altogether. The burger, sauce and cheese were fine and the french fries were very crispy and nicely salted.

While Jersey Mike's will remain my go-to lunch spot in that particular plaza, a recent trip to Northstar revealed that I had been walking by good food and a decent restaurant.\\n\\nI had some reservations about Northstar from walking by it so many times. Mostly, it looked far too sterile for me. I don't like feeling like I'm eating in an surgery theater. My other concern was that while I could easily spot a beverage menu from outside, I couldn't spot a food menu- and while I logically knew menus were available somewhere, I had this irrational fear that I wouldn't know how to order upon entering.\\n\\nAs it turns out, my girlfriend had made lunch plans at Northstar that involved me and two of our co-workers; the perfect opportunity to try Northstar without ever having to consciously betray my beloved cheesesteaks next door. \\n\\nMy concerns of an overly sterile environment were not unfounded. I'm sure there's plenty of people who would describe Northstar as simple, maybe elegant, definitely clean- but the whole place was just a tad too perfectly kept for my personal, barbaric tastes. Sparse, empty- the whole place left me with an impression of being too much of not enough. \\n\\nOn the other hand, my nightmarish concerns about the menu were easily assuaged when I discovered that the menus are all printed and available for perusing. I decided on a fresh ginger ale and the veggie burger, which I'm told is locally famous. \\n\\nFirst, the ginger ale: it was delicious. I can barely compare it to other ginger ales because I've sure as hell never had a homemade one before. Was that a fresh mint leaf floating in the glass? I think so. Despite having to sip around shrubbery, I downed the ginger ale much quicker than I wanted to, at almost $4 for a glass. I liked it, sure, but I don't know if it was worth what I paid for it.\\n\\nNeither, for that matter, was the veggie burger. Also delicious, also homemade, but in the end it wasn't anything to marvel over. Heavy on the onions and an almost unsettling color of beet-juice-stain pink, it was an odd thing to try to eat, crumbly and looking bloodier in its own way than a McDonald's burger. Again, I liked the burger, but I felt I had been taken for something of a small ride in terms of what I paid for it.\\n\\nSo thanks, Northstar, but mostly- no thanks. If you were a food stall at Easton and you charged a little less, I'd eat your food with some frequency.

(So much so that I stopped somewhere else to grab a replacement breakfast, but didn't have time after going to Pret.)\\n\\nSure, you can microwave the ice cold breakfast sandwiches, but if that's what you end up doing, you may as well just go to 7/11 or pick up a frozen Jimmy Dean's. At least then you might actually get what you want on a breakfast sandwich.\\n\\nI probably should have just grabbed one of their pastries (which are highly recommended), but  I can't eat stuff with that much sugar in it without going into a sugar coma. \\n\\nPret, you ruined my breakfast, and put me in a really bad mood."},{"name":"Kouzzina","address":"2101 Epcot Resort Blvd","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"Definitely the best dinner you're going to find in the disney area.

So large we could have split one & been satisfied, but hey, on my Mom's expense account here.  \\n\\nGot the lamb shank & it fell off the bone, not gamey at all.  The gigante beans underneath were tender & not so abundant that it felt like all starch. The whole fish was an oily overture to delicious.  Yes, you could clog an artery eating this everyday, perhaps the least healthy whole fish i've ever encountered.  But it's disney, live a littlle!

I've been buying my beans from Rose City pretty regularly for a couple years, initially just because they were local to Sellwood (where the main competition is the not-bad-but-underwhelming Blue Kangaroo), but the more I shop around the city's more famous roasters and get beans no better than theirs, the more I realize how special these guys are. It's a full-service coffee shop, too, so dropping in for a drink or a sample is always pleasant, but the things that make them special are (1) the people and (2) the beans.\\n\\nThe people: always friendly to a fault, even by Portland's high standards. I sometimes get the feeling they'd be happy if more people just dropped in to talk about coffee with them. Questions about their beans, their roasts, their favorite ways of preparing them are always answered happily and in detail.\\n\\nThe beans: they have a really distinct style of roasting, focused on medium and dark roasts in pretty traditional American/European styles but executed much better than they usually are, with an eye to coaxing out deeper flavors. They're really good at it, too. I don't love every single coffee they make, but I really enjoy the level of variety they produce with their constantly rotating single-origin beans -- and there are stock house blends as well if you're looking for more consistency, of course. If you're looking for \\"third wave\\"-style light roasts, you might want to go somewhere else (e.g. Heart or Courier), since Rose City tends to roast on the dark side, with more emphasis on earthy, toasty flavors. (In fact, they'd be a perfect roaster for someone looking to move from Starbucks' usual burnt beans to more serious coffee.) \\n\\nAnd the freshness! It's basically impossible to buy beans from Rose City's shop that were roasted more than a few days ago. They foam like crazy with trapped CO2 when brewed, a sign of freshness, and the flavor is just insane, never an off note. I can't recommend these guys highly enough -- they really care about their coffee and it shows. Even in a city with insanely serious coffee on the level of Stumptown and Heart and Courier, these guys have a real distinct style and a commitment to their craft that makes them well worth supporting, and not just because they're local and nice."},{"name":"MidiCi The Neapolitan Pizza Company","address":"999 Peachtree St, Ste 120","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"New pizza place in midtown.

Now, that doesn't mean the rest of the food is bad. I'm giving it a 3; the BF would give it a 4 and it all comes down to the entree. (We're looking for a new pizza place so it seems like a reasonable choice)\\n\\nThe service was outstanding. Truly 5 stars and more if I could. We arrived with 2 other couples already eating. As the meal wore on there were about 5-6 take outs and all tables were full. Never once were we neglected or ignored. There were 2 waitresses and they both helped each other out. It was refreshing. \\n\\nBoth our entrees came with the standard dinner salad except - with a little twist: green olives. HOORAY! It truly was nice to see something different in those lettuce, tomato, cucumber salads. We got table bread, which came with a dried herb blend & olive oil . The bread was very fresh; crisp crust (but not hard) and soft inside. \\n\\nThe menu is a little large; not overwhelming but plenty of options. I ended up ordering the baked ziti and the BF got the pasta la bella. I also ordered the meatballs after seeing what some Yelpers had to say about them. \\n\\nNow, normally I'M the one with the best dish and he sits there with a severe case of entree envy but not tonight. I don't know if I just expected something better or just something with a little flavor but I didn't get that. It wasn't bad - truly. It just lacked any real flavor. The sauce was a little watery. I assume the pasta wasn't drained fully. However, the meatballs were delicious and moist. I actually prefer my meatballs the way they make them - all ingredients are fully incorporated into a smooth consistency and then shaped. I'm no meatball connoisseur but they did make my meal a lot better.\\n\\nThe BF's pasta la bella was made with house made sausage and roasted red peppers in a pink sauce; served over linguine. From start to finish this dish was a hit. The sausage had a nice fennel flavor and the pink sauce was savory and thick. The linguine was cooked perfectly and held up really well against the sausage & sauce. \\n\\nWe ordered dessert simply because we had a contact sugar high from sitting next to the display case. We analyzed each one as if we were going to explain them later to a complete and total stranger. Nevertheless, I opted for the Chocolate Peanut Butter Cake and the BF got the Cream Puff Cake. \\n\\nI wish, I wish I would have had the foresight to not order these desserts. I was so disappointed. They were beautiful sitting under the lights of their glass house and even lovelier in person. But one bite and I knew I made a poor choice. The cake was dry, so dry and the layer of peanut butter and chocolate was pure artificial sweetness. It was like they mixed a container of dark chocolate (canned) cake frosting and peanut butter and spread it a half inch thick between the cake. I really do prefer my desserts like my food and made in house and this just reiterated that. The Cream Puff Cake wasn't much better but the cake was a little more moist. \\n\\nBeing the suckers that we are we took a (HUGE) eclair home for my daughter - seriously this thing is at least 8\\" long. The BF got himself a cannoli (as punishment, I'm sure) for later.  \\n\\nI sliced the smallest piece off of the eclair for my girl and she really couldn't speak due to her pure joy. I hear the cannoli was also very good (it should be noted that the cannoli cream IS house made).\\n\\nAll in all, it wasn't a bad night. It just didn't knock my socks off. We'll try pizza.

The regulars are all solid (the Cambridge amber is a favorite of mine, and available at some bars in the area), but the seasonals are where the action is.  They can range from huge IPAs (the red god IPA is excellent) and barleywines in the winter, to delicate and refreshing in the summer (the hefeweizen is top notch).

BUT, for this Southern girl, it's the best deli I've ever been to.\\n\\nMy first visit saw the hot pastrami sandwich. I feel that it changed my life and everything I expected from anything made out of a beef brisket. It's not as strong as you'd see up north, it's a very mild flavor, but the texture is really awe-inspiring. The meat melts like \\"buttah.\\"  Second visit had the special of the day which was the Brisket Rueben. I've never had a Rueben, period, but if they're half as good as this variant, then consider me a fan. The Russian dressing was mildly sweet, so I'm pretty glad I got it on the side. (I'm a sugar fiend, too, and I thought it was a little too sweet, but perhaps that's normal?) It's strongly flavored, you've got to dig a little to get the brisket experience, but it's worth it. The meat is firm, not as melty as pastrami or barbecue or corned beef, but not tough and gently flavored. I was extremely happy at the end of my meal, and not just due to the awesome waitress. (Kata? I sadly have forgotten her name. Sucks.) She was one of the best ones I've had anywhere, which was awesome.\\n\\nPrices could come down some, seeing as it IS Atlanta, even if this is the Emory area. They're not awful, maybe 5-10% higher than you'd expect out of a deli, but perhaps still higher than it should be.

The first, my fianc√© and I had a lovely breakfast. Salmon bagel was yummy and the eggs were well cooked. I also enjoyed that they took our phone number and texted us when the table was ready, so we got to spend our 15 minute wait down by the lake.\\n Second time, we came for a late night fish & chips on a Friday because we're used to our \\"Friday Fish Fry\\" tradition from living in New York. Portions were huge and the meals were great. My fish was slightly undercooked in the middle, but not the end of the world. The waitress was great.\\nThe next time, I came with some friends for breakfast. We waited at the hostess stand for five minutes and did not get greeted by anyone, so we luckily found spots at the counter and took a seat. I ordered eggs over easy and home fries. My meal was forgotten.  Being at the counter, I had a view of what was happening and my waiter did not make any valiant effort to push the order through.  I finally saw it come out of the kitchen and sit on the expo line for about three minutes before the waiter finally brough it over. By then, everyone in my party was done eating. I would've expected some type of apology or something to make up for the inconvenience, but there was nothing offered. \\nFinally, today my fianc√© and I decided to venture back hoping for the same experience we had the first time. Regretfully, it was not the case. We put our name on the waiting list but we're not asked for a phone number or given a buzzer. Everyone around us had a buzzer in their hand. There was a car show going on outside so we quickly walked the street and came back, nervous we'd miss our name being called (since that was their only way to contact us). We decided to wait indoors but found it difficult because there were about 8-9 boxes of stock literally just sitting in the entrance way in front of the dessert display. I kid you not. Stacked boxes of receipt paper, ketchup, you name it. It looked like it a supply closet... But in the middle of the entry way during a busy Saturday morning breakfast rush. My fianc√© was sliding boxes out of the way with his feet just to make more room to stand. Anyways, we were sat outside. Jack was our waitor and he was nice.  The kid that was running food put our food down at another table, realized he was wrong, picked it back up, walked past us with it twice, then finally got it to us.  I saw him do this several other times. Clearly he was not thought the table numbers, He enjoyed his salmon eggs benedict. I had the baked potato omelet which was tasty. Grits were cold and yucky. We ordered a short stack of cookies and cream pancakes... Which arrived as one giant pancake though it says two on the menu. It was also delivered without syrup, which we asked for and finally got about 5 minutes later. Too bad the pancake was already cold.\\n\\nOverall, I think this place needs new management. As someone who has worked in the food industry and is currently the manager of an operation that relies heavily on guest satisfaction, I believe that whoever is running it currently lacks an attention to detail as well as an awareness of customer needs. There are a lot of inconsistencies that need to be ironed out. If I come back, it'll be for the fish and chips."},{"name":"Sweet Cheeks Q","address":"1381 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"My grandmother made the best potato salad in the world.

Also, they were out of coke zero, and after the order came I found out they were out of coleslaw too!"},{"name":"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse","address":"1414 Polaris Pkwy","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Went in on a Monday night wasn't too busy so I cant blame the food experience on that but I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken Salad I believe it was around $15 and it was TERRIBLE there was literally 4 tiny pieces of chicken no avocado, corn just a TON of lettuce it looked nothing like the picture. I sent it back with my complaints and the salad literally came back looking the same.... its a salad its not that hard!!!!"},{"name":"Northstar Caf√©","address":"4241 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Cannot recommend this place enough - every thing I have ordered has been great.

Got the Mercy Blues. Loved the sauce. The kale was cooked perfectly. I like the ordering at the counter, it seems more efficient. Also got a slice of the banana bread, while it was a tad dry, it was packed with banana flavor!"},{"name":"Brookline Lunch","address":"9 Brookline St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"My dad tells me stories about how he used to come here and get brunch/lunch while at work back in the good old days...\\n\\nDad: ... when food didn't cost as much, ya know?\\n\\nMe: Well, it's still fairly inexpensive to eat there...\\n\\nDad: When I was going there it cost two-fifty for all eight of us to stuff ourselves! (or something equally outrageous)\\n\\nI pity anybody who has to listen to this conversation every time we pass this place. But with him, it's like one of those 'fishing stories' the food gets cheaper and cheaper every time we talk about it. This is, however the same man who tried to only give my sister and I fifty-cent allowances FOREVER. Thrifty doesn't even cut it. \\n\\nThe food is average. The place is kinda tight quarters. It's also weird if you are from Cambridge cause then you are somehow obligated to interrupt your eating or somebody else's by saying hi and asking how everybody is, ecc. It's a greasy spoon, a cramped, often too warm spoon that is definitely historically significant, yet most of the time when I think of where to eat ... this place doesn't jump out at me."},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Had brunch here this last Sunday. Fiancee had a very nice lobster roll. I had Eggs Benedict. It was served on mini brioche rolls ( not toasted) and the eggs were overcooked, and the hollandaise was too mustardy.  The ham was cold and was sitting next to the little Egg Benedict sandwiches.  It was really one of the nastiest interpretations of Eggs Benedict I've ever had.  I wouldn't go back there for brunch again.\\n\\n  My fiancee really liked his Lobster Roll.  It was fun to see people walking around, but the rude boston drivers and their constantly honking horns took away from the ambiance."},{"name":"Full English","address":"2000 Southern Oaks Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This is where my friends and I always hang out during the school year, as it's close to our bus stop. Full English is a real gem. The staff is always cool and friendly, for example two of the staff members offered to play Settlers of Catan with us sometime when they saw my friends and I were playing board games. Super friendly, right? The food is really good but you'll need a bit of money to get full. All the tea is great. I love the ambiance of the cafe, and the decor is very shabby chic. I feel so at home whenever i'm there due to the staff and the setting. You can camp out here for hours with your laptop or friends and not feel pressure to make room for more customers. Also, there's almost always this cute little dog there that's the owner's! Lastly, every week they have a doctor who watching event! If that doesn't win you over, I don't know what else to say.\\n\\nOverall, this is definitely one of my top 3 favorite spots in town."},{"name":"Little Big Burger","address":"1630 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Wow. $8 for truffle fries and a Tillamook Cheddar cheeseburger.
