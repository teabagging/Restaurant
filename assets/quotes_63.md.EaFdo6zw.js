Halfway through eating the salmon after using a flashlight I notice the salmon is spongy and much darker towards the center meaning they undercooked my salmon after I requested it be well done specifically. The restaurant is very dark inside making it hard to actually see the food so I am hoping that the first half I ate was not also undercooked.

The line wrapped around the corner but the wait wasn't horrendous and even if it was a long wait, it is totally worth it.  This was my favorite eatery during my time in Portland.  Finally inside and you find the large menu in front of you.  For the three of us, we got the Reggie Deluxe, the Steak Hash-ups, the Blueberry Cornmeal Pancakes and a side of Fried Green Tomatoes.  After ordering, we found a table at the bar (seating is first come first serve but there is ample table space inside, in the patio and outside).  We were front and center for the show.  In front of the cook as the systematically assembles all the Reggie's that people are ordering.  When ordering, the waitress said the food would take around 30 mins to arrive but it only took around 20.  I first tried the Hash Ups.  Steak, Onions, Mushrooms, Cheese, Hash Browns.  Not the usual hash you find with large chunks of potatoes since it is made with hash browns.  Steak seemed a bit overdone but it doesn't take away from the cooked onions, mushrooms, and cheese.  Add a bit of hot sauce and there you have it, an amazing bite that includes your carbs, meats, veges, dairy, and the essential kick. Next I tried the Reggie Deluxe.  As all the other reviews have said, it is a must when coming to Pine State Biscuit.  The biscuit is cooked perfected.  Flake-y, butter-y, oh so bad yet oh so good.  Then you have your MOIST fried chicken, your cheese, your fried egg, your bacon and to top it all over, some sausage gravy.  The only 2 problems I had with these dish were 1) there wasn't enough gravy and 2) there wasn't enough to enjoy.  The friend green tomatoes were an add-on that isn't particularly amazing but it is a nice side.  The tomatoes are juicy but the crust from frying them makes it seem like an onion ring.  Tasty and flavorful but not necessary when coming here.  For \\"dessert\\", I had the Blueberry Cornmeal Pancakes.  3 pancakes stacked on top of each other with a side of butter and maple syrup.  Simple dish and not as heavy as the others.  Heavy is relative though.  The pancakes were a bit thin for my preference but the cornmeal and blueberry was a great combinations.  I love cornbread so of course I have to love this as well.  It is a good balance for the other dishes we ordered.  A REAL breakfast item since we came for brunch.\\n\\nSo being a fattie, we asked a server if we could get a side order of just a biscuit and gravy.  Luckily, we didn't have to wait in line again and within a few minutes, she brought over a large plate with a biscuit, smothered with sausage gravy.  Devoured this, in addition to the rest of the food.  If I could (and I wasn't in public), I would pick up the plate to make sure I didn't leave any gravy behind.

Both times I was looked at and given the attitude like I was some rude individual walking up to someone's table while they were in mid conversation or while they were eating.  Management should sit up and take notice, these are the FIRST people your customers see and have to deal with, they will often set the mood.  Piss them off before they even sit, and the server is going to spend some of the night just trying to recover.  That being said, one of our 2 servers (we were part of a large group) was awesome.  She was friendly, and quick with refills on drinks and bread.  The other, well, clearly not happy about dealing with the large group.  If im honest, it was a happy occasion, so everyone did get up and mingle a bit, and it did take a while for everyone to arrive.  But seeing as how we ordered nearly one of every app offered, and most had a drink or 2, plus most of us ordered heavy meals and desserts, you would think her attitude would have improved seeing the check total climb.

This chain used to be Rise-n-Dine, but I never ate there either, so I can give no comparison to its former nameplate.  Like it's local competitors Scrambler Marie's and FirstWatch, Sunny Street is breakfast and lunch only in a casual atmosphere with wait staff. It is also open 7 days a week. Like the competitors, everything is down to a system so as to make your visit as efficient as possible.  That said, we were not rushed out and allowed to take as long as we wanted to talk, etc.  I got there at about 10:45 a.m. on a Sunday, and this turned out to be the right time, as I was seated right away and just missed the wait. The main difference I noticed between Sunny Street's menu and the competitors is that I would say it is definitely slanted toward the serious meat-and-potatoes crowd. There are several menu items that feature hash, or steak and eggs, or other such items that are popular in the farm belt. That said, there are still things like breakfast quesadillas, pancakes, breakfast combos that feature eggs, a starch or choice and a meat of choice, yogurt parfaits, etc., so if the hearty meat-laden breakfast doesn't suit you, there are other options that will. I had the Sunny Street Benedict, which is a take on eggs benedict that has spinach, fresh tomatoes and feta cheese in lieu of Canadian bacon. I opted for grits on the side instead of hash browns as this Yankee gal has a thing for grits. My friend opted for the Denver omelette.  Our order came out very quickly and was pretty tasty. The grits were very creamy and had the right amount of salt and pepper - I didn't have to add anything to them. The hollandaise sauce was pretty thick, but good. If I have to give Sunny Street any downside, it is that the coffee is rather weak and tasteless.

But  If you want to improve those odds and also  be treated like shit as well , then  make sure you get the  waitress with the fake contact lenses that dresses like a pole dancer from 1987 .  I'm  sorry but if you're  a server who  wants to be unapologetically rude , condescending, full of  Friday -night-at the-club attitude  AND blame customers  for your own  incompetence ,  social media is gonna catch up with you  . Especially when you flash me  snide little smirk as we were trying to leave in  absolute disgust of how we were treated .. Brilliant .  So Here it is . enjoy :  \\n      \\n As usual , we were seated by the lower bar due to  the premium seating upstairs  being  overrun with man-spreading hangoverees  .We placed drink and food orders with our lovely waitress.  I ordered eggs over medium.  We had more people coming so we moved a few tables down .We did this also to be seen because The Charlatan is famous for sitting you in the lower levels and completely forgetting about you. Hopefully unintentionally ..But , Despite our calculated move , there we sat for an hour waiting for our food and completely forgotten about by our server .We watched a table of smiling  man-spreaders receive their food who had ordered and were seated long after we were   . We didn't see  Ms. 1987 for at least half an hour . We were getting thirsty and got sick of waiting so some of us  went up to the upper bar to  order drinks. They got half their orders but waited 10 minutes for the rest . When they got sick of waiting they asked the bartender where the other drinks were and he said : \\" Oh. sorry I forgot ... why do you need those drinks ? are you going to drink all those drinks? \\" .. after another 5 minutes of trying to convince the bartender that 2 people ordering 4 drinks is not uncommon , especially when  our waitress had forgotten about our table, he obliged them . The bartender must have told her something because she magically appeared to take our drink orders . We told her that we were ok for drinks because we had to go to the upper bar to get them because she had disappeared for over 30 minutes . She gives us attitude .  That entire time she  didn't peer down from the upper sections to check the kitchen if our order was up or to check on us .She didn't seem to care  that we had waited on hour for our food or come and say : \\" Sorry, I'll go see whats taking the kitchen so long \\"as the place was far from being full. Nope. No acknowledgement whatsoever . One of our group had to get up and ask why we had been waiting for over on hour for our food .With a whole lot of unnecessary  attitude, Ms 1987 says our order was next up. It came 5 minutes later . Fine. My eggs  came hard. Not fine.  Listen, if  I'm coming to a place that charges $13 bucks for eggs and few potato cuts . I want that shit done right . Whats the point of asking me how I want my eggs if you won't bother to give them to me as I ordered. Yes mistakes happen , so I went up  to Ms. 1987 and said politely . \\" Sorry , but my eggs did't come the way I ordered them, they were hard ....\\". She did't offer a redo  on the eggs , she didn't do anything accept shrug and say : \\"sorry\\" . I'm annoyed now . I go sit down and eat everything except the eggs. Eggs cooked hard  make me gag like a lot of people  . She comes over with  the  bills. $13 for eggs cooked wrong . I pipe up \\" Listen, I didn't get what I ordered, we had to wait an hour for our food, and we had to go to the bar to order most of our own drinks  , I don't think our experience has been anything close to what you are charging ....\\"  And  with calculated  sarcasm and the cunningest of snark she says   \\" Do you want me to give you a discount ? You shouldn't have sit down here if you  wanted me to pay attention to you. I couldn't see you guys so I forgot about you .\\n\\n Oh really ?! Where should we have sat to get the least amount of incompetence  from you Ms 1987 ? \\n \\nSo she blamed us for being seated out of sight ?!(After we  moved to the most  visible location possible )  and felt giving us attitude for pointing out how awful the entire experience was somehow  justified ? Unbelievable . She made no apologies and acted like we didn't matter so I told Ms 1987 :  \\" I don't  want anything from you or  your condescending attitude. This is the worst service I've ever  had and thank you for convincing all 8 of us  to never set foot in the Charlatan ever again.\\" \\n\\nWell Done Charlatan! There is a server in your midst who is so completely undermining everything a place of business is supposed to be.

Nonni's makes an admirable effort on their part though, as the pizza holds up well to the transport.\\n\\nThe thin, dryer crust has a great combination of stiffness and chewiness, not too doughy either. The cheese is definitely not stock schlock; it didn't have that stringy mozzarella consistency like it came right out of an enormous bag from Sam's Club. The only criticism is there wasn't much sauce under the cheese, and it left things a little dry. Overall not the best pizza I've ever had (and no, I don't want my money back Nonni's, don't worry), but worth getting again.\\n\\nThe breadsticks are good, chewy and flavorful.

I've never had a pork Burrito before (I've had ground beef, steak, and chicken), so I thought it was time to try something new. Plus a glass of ice water with lemon.\\n\\nThe side of Guac and chips came out first and fairly quickly. I was served a basket of chips - half of which were your traditional corn chips - and the other half were plantain chips. Never had those before!\\n\\nThe Guac was a solid contender, with lots of chunks of avocado - not overly flavorful though - I added some Cholulu sauce to it to give it some bite. I also asked for some salsa for my chips - I got two sides - one was a corn and mango based salsa - the other a more traditional tomato based salsa.\\n\\nThe corn and mango salsa had a rather odd and funky flavor to it - was not a fan - but the tomato-based salsa was good.\\n\\nOn to the Burrito - it came out a few minutes later - and piping hot. It came with a side of rice and some shredded lettuce with a wedge of tomato. The shredded pork loin in the Burrito was succulent and delicious - the Burrito as a whole was very good.

Let's take a journey to a tiny Japanese tea House (it's more like a hut) with 24 seats. It's an intimate atmosphere. But before you even enter the restaurant it's the aroma that beckons. You can smell the herbs, spices and oils and hear the sounds of the kitchen. The air is filled with the aromas of Asian cooking. You can hear sizzling and kitchen tools as you enter the doorway. If you're lucky, you'll get a seat right away. (If not, there is an amazing cheese shop next door where you can grab some plant based cheeses and beer or wine.) The concept here is all of your food, large and small plates, are served at the same time. My husband and I came hungry, and we're absolutely stuffed when we left. We shared 4 small plates and the Ichiza Noodle Soup bowl. We would have been full on 3 small plates and the bowl to share. But we were open to taking home leftovers! \\n\\nWe shared the Chili Oil Wontons, Shumai, Kimchi Gyoza, and Cheung Fun as well as the Ichiza Noodle Soup bowl. I am obsessive about texture in food. There was crunch, softness, and firmness. There was sweet, sour, the spice, the rich flavor. Oh yum. Every. Single. Bite. I said \\"mmmmm this is good.\\" Now I am clearly not the one to tell someone what tastes like chicken or pork or beef, since it's been 10 years since I've had any of those. But the soup had \\"chicken\\" in it. And it was so moist and melt in your mouth good. It was the best representation of chicken I have ever had. Ever. I also loved the ham and beef that was inside the wontons. \\n\\nOne of the most beautiful things we ate was the Shumai, which had fake roe on top. Now fish I miss like crazy. I grew up in FL, I fished, and I was good at it. I ate seafood daily. Now that I know what it should look and taste like and it was mind blowing. If this restaurant wasn't 100% plant based I would have asked several times \\"are you sure this isn't...\\" Just damn good food. \\n\\nOf course you need to know how the service was. Stellar. They have three servers/hosts who greet and seat and serve and bus. They seem to have a seamless system and take care of guests to a high level of satisfaction. I can only give one bit of negative feedback, and frankly (because I am frank as heck so why expect anything else?!) it isn't even the fault of the business as much as a result of their location. The heating and cooling is via windows, doors and an AC unit. We got lucky to eat on a cooler night so we bundled up and ate soup (not that we didn't want the soup but it we warmed me.) I was cold because the door was open for a good portion, but I am sure the kitchen and staff were super hot so I never asked for it to be closed. In the warmer weeks you can eat outside so that would likely help as well. But by all means EAT HERE. Because you won't regret it. It's SO good. EVERYTHING is so good.

They were thickly cut and pleasantly potato-y, which is what a fry should be, after all!\\n\\nAt the waitress's suggestion (I couldn't decide between the beet or goat cheese salads), I went with the crispy goat cheese salad with the dressing on the side. The salad came with one big goat cheese fritter, candied walnuts, and delicious chunks of pear. I'm glad I asked for the dressing on the side, because it didn't add anything to the salad and I definitely didn't want the extra calories.

The restaurant is tiny so you are crammed in with a million people coming through the door desperately asking to be put on a waiting list like its some kind of concert of something. This didn't bother me at all, but if you're looking for a quiet place to eat this is not it.\\n\\nThe oysters were fresh and amazing. The lobster roll for to die for. This is the only place that I know of, that makes it connecticut style.... In other words, if i could marry a connecticut style lobster roll I would. I also had some kind of appetizer that was a pancake in  brown butter with caviar. All fabulous.\\n\\nMy only concern is that the amount of butter they use has you in a coma for the rest of the day. I literally had a hard time walking back to the car. And when comparing this to Island Creek Oyster, I like the appetizers better (ie. Oyster slider).

For about 1.5 years now, we've been going here for dinner after we're done with our volunteer work.\\n\\nHere's everything I appreciate about the place:\\n\\nCLEANLINESS:\\nThe place is always busy and the staff are quick to bus tables, keep the salad bar in order, and keep the ice cream station clean and operational.  When (and if) the line cooks get a small break, they are always busy cleaning their stations behind the counter.  \\n\\nSERVICE:\\nThe line to order your food always moves quickly, even on busy Friday nights.  You serve your own drinks and staff bring your food out to you.  All the staff are nice and friendly. \\n\\nATMOSPHERE:\\nI like it.  I try to sit in a booth near the front because I like to hear the line cooks bantering with each other in Spanish.  I can get about 85% of what they are saying to each other -- and it's always funny.  This place brings in a good mix of people, which is also nice to be around -- kids of all ages in large groups (usually sports teams), small nuclear families, large extended families, different ethnicities/nationalities, older couples, young couples, friends, etc.  \\n\\nSTAFF:\\nThere has been very little turnover in staff since we've been coming here and that's always a good sign.  We recognize all the regular Friday night staff every time we come here.  That shows the place treats its employees well and that the employees enjoy working there.\\n\\nOK...THE FOOD:\\n\\nFirst, the FREE stuff: Everyone knows you get free soft-serve ice cream at Jason's.  But you also get free mini muffins and garlic bread.  These items are at the salad bar and you can get as much as you want on small white plates that they put out.\\n\\nTURKEY WRAP: Yum.  Healthy.  My \\"go-to\\" sandwich at this place.  I get it about 75% of the time.  I always mix-up my sides.  You can get: chips (regular or baked Lays) and a pickle, blue tortilla chips and salsa, or fresh fruit with yogurt dipping sauce.\\n\\nChicago Club -- I love the herbed focaccia bread on this sandwich.\\n\\nNew York Yankee (hot corned beef AND pastrami pile a mile high -- for when I'm REALLY hungry).\\n\\nPenne & Meatballs: Always piping hot with lots of gooey cheese.  Comfort food.\\n\\nPlain Jane baked potato.  The \\"original\\" is huge.  The \\"lighter\\" option is slightly less huge.  Comes with butter, cheddar, sour cream, bacon, and scallions.  SO good.\\n\\nAnd, of course, we always have some free soft-serve ice cream!\\n\\nI can't speak for other Jason's Delis -- but this one at Northlake in Tucker is great all around."},{"name":"Tibby's New Orleans Kitchen","address":"2203 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"Simply Amazing!!!

I didn't get familiar with it where I grew up, so I'm not going to claim any sense of authenticity. And I've eaten at TB I think only once in my life, Yum!-not, in my opinion, so I can't campare with that. \\n\\nI appreciate Senior Javier is 24x7, relatively inexpensive for the size. And the crisp pickled vegies and peppers is an OK addition, though they don't spend a peso of extra energy chopping them. \\n\\nThe fish taco was unexciting. The batter was bland, a little tough. The ideal fish taco has tender lightly cooked fish, these were well done. Not in any way generous with the fish in relation to the veggies. The chorizo had a generous portion of oil and the finest grind meat imaginable. The carnitas was very tasty when hot, even sweet. It became much more ordinary and tougher on cooling. It's not as dirty as some others seem to think. I've got a pretty iron digestive system, I have only had dysentery twice travelling, but I have to say that Senior Javier's tacos were a mild challenge to the system, which is not a good thing for a restaurant.\\n\\nThe counter people were polite and crisp, and the kitchen delivers relatively quickly, at least at midnight when the place was filled, but not jammin'. And the size to value ratio is OK, though I'm more a fan on the smaller and tastier TSC#2 tacos which get taste, size, quality and price in alignment with the Mayan calendar. But TSC#2 is not open as la luna is setting. \\n\\nThere are very few places open to eat in the 2-6 witching hours. That makes people watching fun in any of them. And certainly in Senior Javier's neighborhood, it's the only choice. I would eat there again, but I wouldn't relish it for the food itself. \\n\\nI would also say that changing from plastic to paper take out clamshell containers, as have many food carts, would be an improvement.\\n\\nMeh, methinks."},{"name":"The Wing Bar","address":"494 Flat Shoals Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I love trying new wing places and was very excited when I came across The Wing Bar.

This is an incredible deal, especially considering that we both got the filet mignon. Both steaks were cooked to order and although I didn't like the goat cheese mashed, it was because I found out I don't like goat cheese. Nonetheless, we both finished out plates because the food was just absolutely incredible. We finished off by sharing the creme brulee .. I'll recommend it, for certain. Also on the evening, a San Francisco [Something] martini. I agree that no martini is worth $12, but the $5 entree price allowed me to spring for it. It was strong and great-tasting, although pretty much every martini could be considered a \\"girly drink\\". \\n\\nIt was a bit hectic getting in, but we attributed that to it being an event night. There also wasn't a comfortable place for us to wait for our table (only a 15 minute wait - I'd suggest making a reservation) so we awkwardly went next door to Urban Outfitters for a few minutes then near the valet station then back inside. Also, it did take our waitress about 10 minutes to greet us, and being that we were a very low-key, no-fuss sort of table, I didn't get a \\"bad waitress\\" vibe from her, but then again I'm sure a toddler could have handled us. \\n\\nMaybe I just don't have great food enough, but both my dining companion and myself decided this was excellent food and that if we were ever in a situation where someone was offering to wine and dine us, we'd pick Match."},{"name":"Italian Kitchen","address":"860 Burrard St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"When ever I am in Vancouver Italian Kitchen is one of my go to places.

It comes with eggs and bacon as the toppings and the blue cheese dressing was delish.  My friends had the peel and eat as well as the BBQ shrimp.  I tried a bite of their she crab soup and will for sure get that as my app next time.  So yummy and creamy.  We also had the crescents with honey butter.  They were good, but I felt guilty with every bite.  Prob wouldn't get it as an app next time since they also came with our salads.  \\n\\nEvery bite was amazing.

I shopped at several of their stores including the flagship store in Pittsford and an older ones in the city. If you are looking for the upstate New York brands that you remember when you lived there, you can probably find them at Wegman's.\\n \\nThis new store in Burlington looks like it's supposed to be upscale from the outside, but the inside feels like a run-of-the-mill supermarket. The signage and paint color (there's something uninspiring about the ceiling... maybe it's the construction style, but I've decided it must be the paint color) just don't inspire. The rear of the store, including the alcohol area, is stocked with huge industrial racks that make it feel like Costco.\\n\\nThe prices are fine, the selection is fine, but none of it feels unique. The Asian food selection and produce is no better than the Burlington Market Basket, so I doubt this store can compete with the one-two-punch of MB and H-Mart for the Asian shopper.\\n\\nIn Rochester there wasn't much supermarket competition, but in Boston we have--what--six? major supermarket choices (Market Basket, Hannaford, Stop&Shop, Shaw's, Whole Foods, Trader Joe's), and proven extreme loyalty to the native Market Basket chain. Unless this store can differentiate itself then I don't see how it will survive. I do not shop at only one supermarket: I have found certain items that I like and buy at certain stores (MB, WF, TJ). Since Wegman's would not be a one-stop-shop for me, I cannot imagine becoming a regular customer. How many people will feel the same? It could be that I'm just not their target demographic.\\n\\nThere are just two things that I can clearly see going for this location. The first is: well, the location. I imagine that people who work or live to the northwest of Burlington Mall might prefer shopping here so that they don't have to fight the horrible traffic south of the mall to get in and out of the Burlington Market Basket. The second: they sell alcohol. \\n\\nThe alcohol selection here is fine. They have a decent selection of craft beers and a dedicated section for local breweries. The prices are not better than Kappy's or Sav-Mor. I don't know much about wine so I cannot comment about their selection. They have a lot of bottles.\\n\\nFinally, the (covered) parking here surprised me. This is a brand new facility but there are no dedicated pedestrian walkways.

When the manager states \\"You're right about them not being hash browns, but that's what they do\\" you have a problem. You want to sell home fries, then put them on the menu as home fries. \\n\\nAlso they gave my girlfriend a plain bagel; fixed it with an everything bagel that was cold. Like from a bag cold.

On one occasion the cashier sneezed into her hand and then reached for my credit card with the same hand. Clearly the management doesn't care, as I've seen them loitering around and distracting the employees. It's awful.

It's actually quite a bit cheaper than I would expect, given the quality. I had the buttermilk johnnycake as an appetizer -- something I'd never even heard of before. It's a honey butter cr√™pe topped with smoked trout tartar and caviar. Now, I'm an American/Italian food kinda gal -- cheeseburgers, calamari, potato skins, et cetera -- but this completely blew my mind. I ate more slowly than I ever have in my life, just so that it would last longer! For dinner, I had the Maine lobster roll, served hot. This being March and, thus, not lobster season, I didn't expect to be impressed... but it was by far the most delicious, juicy, succulent lobster I've ever had. And they didn't drench it in butter, either: it was lightly brushed -- the perfect amount. Absolutely amazing! Months later, I still think about this dinner and wish I didn't live 3,100 miles away so I could visit it more than once a year!\\n\\nThe service was attentive and friendly. Our drinks were never empty, and the food came out speedily and with care. The chef himself attended our table on no fewer than three occasions to make sure we were happy and to offer any assistance he could -- even such mundane tasks as filling our drinks.\\n\\nThose who are looking for a quiet, spacious, private place for a relaxed dinner or an intimate date will need to look somewhere else. It was noisy (though not prohibitively so -- I never once had trouble hearing my companion) and incredibly crowded, even when sitting down. We shared our table with two other couples (there are only spots for perhaps 30 people in the entire restaurant). That said, the air of happiness, the smell of delicious food, the hustle and bustle of a busy, successful restaurant, the chatter of obviously pleased customers, and the warmth of both the staff and the interior itself contributed to making the experience an exceedingly comfortable and enjoyable one.\\n\\nThe bad: the wait is long -- hours, and even so it's still far longer than they quote -- and annoying in that there's no standing room. I was incredibly frustrated by the time our table became available; we'd been shoved, pushed, and snapped at by other equally frustrated customers for far too long a time.

Keeping that in mind and being denied going to another place, due to the fact they were closed on Monday, I came here with my mom. Around 4PM on a holiday Monday, it's dead, like maybe one table, and that table had only one person sitting by themselves eating, should I enter, well it's a time where many Asian restaurants during this time are closed for the break and since I never came here might as well give it a shot.\\n\\nIt's a clean, small place, that when empty is very roomy, there is a small (think under 27') flat screen playing some Chinese program while the person working there is really staying in the back and playing with her iPhone waiting for you to order. We received our menu and decided to call along another friend to come by, and at that moment our first order was the Laksa. My mom had to walk up from where we were sitting to find the person behind the till to put the order in...and in Cantonese she tells the chef in the back of the order. We eventually receive this huge bowl of Laksa, a nice creamy murky soup base that you can see the redness, and through this, the creamy coconut milk used to make this liquid. On top, floating with the help of a lot of vermicelli... some nice sized prawns, thinly sliced fish cake, shredded chicken, bean sprouts, a cut in half hard boiled egg, this thing had it all in presentation, but how was it? I was actually very happy with this bowl, as this was supposed to be a snack, became a full on meal, sharing with my mom, having each lovely bite, with enough of everything, from soup to noodles to protein, however you wanted to eat this, there was a lot where nothing was overpowering with great mix where is wasn't overly 'coconutty' but my kind of noodles on this sunny day. Eventually the third wheel came, and we decided to get more food.\\n\\nWe ordered the Hainanese chicken with their flavored/scented rice, and I remember a lady coming in not too long ago while I was slurping down the noodles asking about her take out and if the rice was 'chicken' rice... in Cantonese... meaning flavored. We ordered an order that looked like half a bird with two bowls of rice, and a bowl of their curry beef with housemade roti, we did not know what to expect but if it was like the laksa that was just devoured prior to this order, we should be ok. Now coming up to past 5 the other thing I noticed was that there was more people in the place, and I forgot to mention, this was a cash only joint, and in this plaza where this place is.. there are a ton of restaurants, so no lack of choice. Our food eventually came and the first thing that wowed me was the golden, yellow color of the chicken rice, most places, it just glistens with whatever chicken fat that has been greased into the rice, this was a pleasant sight, and while it came out with the chicken it was all piping hot, steam coming from the rice, the chicken.. all of it. Taking each bite of the chicken, it was moist, juicy, tender, and tasty, mixed with the rice it was a perfect deadly over-eating combo.\\n\\nThe curry beef was another surprise, full of flavor, different from that of other nationality curries, I wasn't too fond of the gooey texture of the roti, but to each their own, and to making that it wasn't bad, it just wasn't to my liking. We had to pack most of this home, as it was just too much for three people, forget midday snack, this was dinner and we were done. I did end up eating a portion of the leftovers on another night and they were as tasty as they were when eating right at the restaurant. While coming out after paying for the bill, the place was packed, so people know about this place and they come to it.. just like that tip I got from donating blood, this place is good.. and it's cheap for what you get.

This place has NEVER failed me both these aspects. I just stay a stone's throw away from Olive Bistro and have walked there many a times. I love their Mediterranean platter and their chicken rice and lentils. They are generous with the garlic that they add, which makes their food unique and enjoyable. \\n\\nTheir tabouleh is just right neither too acidic nor too bland. I had just one instance when their tabouleh was extremely bland and when asked was given a valid reason that it was just prepared and had not spent enough time in lemon. Their Tapenade is the only form of olives that i love. Their tuscan beans is wonderfully flavored with olive oil, garlic and other herbs and it comes topped with one of the best sun dried tomatoes that I have ever had. Some times they go overboard with olive oil for this dish  which i don't like. Their rice and lentils with chicken is another thing i love. The rice and lentils is subtly flavored and the good thing is the flavors actually reach the heart of each rice grain. I mean it, its just not superficial. The chicken is not overly spiced and not oily.. Coming from the Indian sub continent, I sometimes find their chicken a bit bland for my liking. \\nFor dessert I prefer their Turkish Coffee. The steaming cup of coffee with cardamom is a pleasure for the senses. I find their bakalava too heavy with cinnamon and hence avoid it. \\n\\nThe music they play fits in with the theme The only thing I find out of place is a huge photo of charlie chaplin. I have not understood the connection between the photo and the restaurant. The staff here is extremely friendly. They remember my tastes and preferences and I have had the pleasure of some good conversations with them.

But this dead-end street was different. Big modern contemporary metal art in the middle, big pots of plants, palm trees, newly paved sidewalks, and a bridge to the high rise apartment a few blocks away.\\n\\nEntering the restaurant, we saw a modern interior, high ceiling, dark tables, and were promptly greeted by a staff and seated. Our waiter took our drink and food orders. \\n\\nI ordered the Shrimp Torta special, which was essentially yummy friend shrimps with some basil pesto spread. I don't know about you, but I can tell a fresh pesto from one that has been sitting in the fridge or store shelf for a while. Fresh pesto tastes and smells almost grassy -- that's the closest I can describe it. Their pesto tastes this way. I know this was made recently. The shrimp was crunchy on the outside and soft and juicy in the inside. The sandwich came with a side of seasonal fruit. What a healthy entree! And it's very affordable.\\n\\nMy lunch partner went for the chile relleno. He claimed it was good and spicy.\\n\\nThe only small complaint I have was our waiter has to be reminded of my iced tea order when it did not arrive by the time our food arrived.\\n\\nOverall, nice experience, good food, great ambiance. I would go here again."},{"name":"Brothers Taverna","address":"283 Derby St","city":"Salem","stars":"3.5","text":"Loved it.  The new makeover looks great.  Coffee was piping hot and delicious.

I'm also just a wee bit fussy about the meat that I chose to eat. Maybe spending most of my adult years here in the PNW, where it's at least fairly common for restaurants to offer you the chance to be in touch with the products that go into the food that you are eating has spoiled me? Who knows. Also? I understand that a late night taqueria is NOT the type of place that is going to offer it's customers that type of luxury. I don't think that this type of restaurant should, actually. What I DO expect, though, is for obstensibly vegetarian items for sale in said establishments to be free of meat. \\n\\nThis, I'm afraid to report, has not been the case in FOUR seperate instances here. C'mon, guys! \\nUltimately, i don't care that much. I'll encounter some errant meat in my vegetarian burrito and just keep eating. It's just a little animal flesh. Ideally, though, it just shouldn't be there. And it is. \\n\\nAlso, this place is a freaking mess. Maybe because it closes for nothing (( was it open during snopocolypse this last December? I'll bet that it was! )) or because the workers are just too busy to clean things in the public areas but whatever the reason it's just not clean. It's so unclean, in fact, that it makes me feel unsure about the kitchen part of the restaurant. Don't even get me started on the bathroom. \\n\\nI really feel like a jerk being so critical of this place. I understand that it's ultimately just an all night burrito place and that I shouldn't hold it to the same standards as other restaurants, that a little grittiness is par for the course, etc, etc. I'm a little suprised at myself, actually. If you had ever met me personally you might be suprised, too. I'm an unprofessional, dirty, casual-bordering-on-inappropriate person.

After walking by this place hundreds of times I finally stopped in this morning for some breakfast to go.  The good: the atmosphere is really cool with original art on the walls and lots of natural wood.  The bar for fixing up your coffee is clean and well stocked with soy milk, skim milk, creamer etc.  staff is friendly and accommodating (I asked for lots of room for milk in my medium iced coffee and the girl helping me offered to out my medium in a large cup so I would have extra space).  Along with my iced coffee, which was very good, I ordered the vegan breakfast burrito.  It had tofu scramble with bean chilli, salsa, and grilled veggies. It was exactly what I was expecting (actually it was a generous size, more than most bfast burritos) but it wasn't anything incredible or innovative. No worries though because when you just need a good hearty and healthy breakfast this place does the trick. I also give them props for having beer on tap (unusual for a coffee shop). Not to mention that for only having 4 taps the selection was superb. The bad: there were probably about 6 other people there when I stopped in and the wait for my burrito took 10 or 15 minutes which I found a little long. As someone who used to manage a deli that routinely had over 25 orders at a time with only a 5-8 minute wait time, I get frustrated when I see a kitchen that lacks urgency and hustle. However, this is a coffee shop with a very chill and relaxed vibe so maybe I'm wasting my breath on that one.

Ms Smith said the information I gave her had been sent to the locals...manager and district manager and I would be receiving a call.

I had no prior knowledge of the brand or the types of food they offered, which made it a little confusing upon entry. My mother and I were immediately greeted and asked whether we knew about the style of cuisine they offered, when we responded with a 'no', we were given a quick explanation and asked if we had any questions. \\n\\nWe both went with the 4 bowl which offers 2 sides, a protein, a veggie, and a sauce. An initial problem presents itself in the form of a \\"What out of the options will make the best bowl?\\" There's no pre-set combinations, which leaves guests to discover what may or may not go well together. A secondary problem was noticed when we went to choose items in the 'hot' plate area, the food is a bit charred from possibly sitting too long in the cookware on the heating element, though interestingly enough, none of the food could be considered hot in temperature and it was mostly lukewarm. Drinks were labeled as 'natural' soda and teas, pretty standard. \\n\\nDining area was bright and clean, with retro style stools, chairs, and booths in a vivid teal color. Tables are a quaint pink rose laminate design, with green grass edge borders. Definitely a better layout than the last restaurant that lived in this space. Bathrooms were clean and brightly colored in a pink and tropical seeming design. \\n\\nPricing is a bit high for the standard of food and lack of options. Portions in the 4 bowl were of a decent size, leaving an adult satisfied and not overfull. \\n\\nOverall, I'd eat here again to try a different combo and if I was in the mood for the flavors offered, but it wouldn't be a first choice.

This Cafe is something else.  Two of us went for dinner and we both had the same reaction when the main course came to the table.  Disturbing.  The combination of flavors was not right.  The other notable fact is that the portions are VERY small while the prices are not.  We each had iced tea which was good (but they do not have sweet tea, so how southern is that?).  I had a small and I do mean small green salad that was tasty , tiny but tasty.  We had the full order of nachos that  was okay to start but disappointed once you got past the toppings.  Lots of black beans.  My magna Cristo...hummmmmm what can I say?  It was odd.  Supposed to be like a Monte Cristo except they do not have a deep fryer but the smell made you think sweet but the sandwich was not and it didn't work.  The shrimp enchilada  was truly strange.  The cheese on the menu said Montery Jack.  If that was Montery Jack then it was a very strange brand.  The tortillla was soggy and the whole mess was covered in a heavy tomato sauce.  AND they brough a salsa bowl to the table for this disaster.  The home fries were good I will say that.  We ordered a piece of Peanut butter pie with ice cream.  The pie was VERY small the scoop of ice cream was generous, the cream put on the side had an odd consistency that we scooped off and hid in a napkin.  This distasteful repast came to 50.00 with tip.

This time we only chose the spicy soup as we  wernt really a fan of the original broth, to us it just tasted like chicken broth with herbs, but I am sure people who can't handle spice would like, just not for us as it didn't stand out as much as the spicy soup. My gf ordered a coconut juice and I ordered herbal tea, as hot pot is quite heaty  (asian thing, can't really explain in english).

Someone, somewhere, is listening to my prayers.  \\n\\nI went to go check it out that first day and it was everything I could have asked for.  Tons of options to stick in that delicious tortilla and all at the standard taco cart price.  I brought a few tacos home with me and was even more excited about this new phenomenon.\\n\\nThe tacos were great.  The barbacoa tasted like barbacoa, pastor like pastor, etc.  The hours were long and favorable.  One can call in orders in advance.  I was very happy.\\n\\nBut as the days went by I noticed little traffic visiting this new business.    I started to get worried.  Horrible scenarios began running through my head.  What happens if this cart can't survive at this intersection?\\n\\nI went by again last night to ensure Taqueria Star made a few more dollars in revenue for the day and one of my fears was realized.  Rising prices.  After only a week.  Everything on the menu was raised .75, so your standard taco is now going to run $2.25 rather than the average $1.50.  I'm hoping with more business prices will go back down, but I don't see it happening.  I hope things work out.\\n\\nOverall, it's very good food.  Authentic tacos, tortas, gorditas, burritos... they've got it all.

As we all know that gluten free foods tend to dry more, even after a day or a couple of hours. I'm glad they moved to a more central location and expanded their menu. Bought a bag of their foccacia bread, root-beer cupcake, ding dong, lemon bar, and banana muffin , totaling to about $18 bucks. Quite pricey (at least for my budget) but hey, what options do I have other than Udi's products and such? I wish I could eat here everyday! This is def the best place to get all your cravings as a gluten free person. I've tried other places around Austin, like Bees Knees Bakeshop in Cedar Park or Steeping Room, but Wild Wood def has a lot more options and their food just tastes better. You can tell they really spent a lot of time perfecting their recipes to make sure texture and taste is top notch. For me, it's 1. Wild Wood , 2. Steeping Room and Thai Fresh , 3. Bees Knees (for dessert or breakfast options)."},{"name":"Little Bird Bistro","address":"215 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"By far the stand-out meal on our weekend trip to Portland.

I immediately apologize - although I have no idea why - door open, lights on, took my order. She states again - \\"We're not open\\" Now she has a rude tone. So I ask if I can pay for my coffee because at this point girl number 1 has brewed the espresso and is getting ready to top it with milk. THE COFFEE WAS DONE.

She came to our table and said she misunderstood my request and that my order was fine, being that I ordered a Moneyball, I would get two full ramekins. Great. My order was immediately called and to my surprise, there was one allotment of gravy. I took it to the counter and asked the cook why I didn't receive both gravies. Apparently she layered them in the container (completely defeating the purpose of the request).

We also got an alcoholic coffee drink and a tasty mary (their take on a bloody mary). Neither one of us really enjoyed the mary, but I think that had more to do with our own personal preferences.

The potatoes were  perfectly cooked and well-seasoned; the sauce was exceptional especially combined with the rich egg yolk oozing from the over easy eggs. The Korean fried chicken was delicious; great combination of different textures and flavors. The dish was very well-balanced with saltiness, sweetness, and acidity.

As the bartender eluded, Ron knows his wines and his knowledge and enthusiasm for wine/food pairing made the entire meal a truly fantastic experience. We looked forward to the times when he would grace us with his wisdom while placing out an array of glasses and filling each with thoughtfully paired pours. The wine pairing alone blew the value of this meal out of the water.\\n\\nThe steelhead in the first course was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and was well balanced by the light citrus of the orange. The salad in the course was as beautiful as it was delicious. The simple preparation left the fresh ingredients to shine through. \\n\\nThe stars of the second course were the Parker house rolls served alongside the charcuterie board! We all agreed we could eat the crispy on-the-outside, pillowy on-the-inside, bread-lettes everyday and would always crave more.

That guy just got flooded out of his home. He doesn't really have any place to go, and his shoes were wet. So he took them off.\\" The old guy commenced to sulk and glare at me as I sat on a bench waiting to be seated. He wanted my bench. I commenced to stare back at him. Maybe that guy was having a bad day. But the shoeless man was having a way worse day. I would have given my seat to the shoeless man in a heart beat. \\n\\nMy point is, is that the hard working people at Magnolia Cafe are sweet and generous Austinites. I have never received bad service even on the busiest Sunday brunch.

I like my food spicy and this really fits the bill. Nothing beats a warm, steaming bowl of noodle in soup on a cold and drafty Boston evening. On warmer days, try #57 Vermicelli with grilled pork and prawns; it's very refreshing and a great way to stimulate the palette on muggy afternoons.

Seriously best korean fried chicken and best kimchi I've ever had. \\n\\nThe Tasty Steak & Cheddar Eggs was delicious. The steak by itself was a bit too charred-tasting for my liking but when paired with the cheesy fluffy eggs and cornmeal pancake, each bite is to die for. But be very cautious when taking those instagram photos... they warned me that the skillet would be extremely hot, but I absentmindedly grabbed the handle and burned my fingers really badly haha :'(\\n\\nAnyway, the food was bomb.

Their really fresh and the sauces they give you are really good.  They give you a good description of the oyster on the menu so you know what your getting.  Then we each ordered a lobster roll, which comes on a toasted roll and just dripping with butter.  They put so much lobster in the roll its spilling out, you can't really keep all of it in the roll.  That first bite was euphoric, the tenderness and flavor of the lobster with the butter, It was one of the greatest things I have ever eaten.  It didn't let me down, it exceeded all my expectations. I tried to savor it but it was just too good.  After finishing it I really thought about ordering another one, even though they are $25, but I decided against it.

Although he did forget to provide us with the specials of the night, which I did not know they had until another waiter was reading them to another table.\\n\\nThe food, overall, was decent, albeit a little pricey.  We started off with a crabmeat and goat cheese flatbread pizza. I am a huge seafood fan, but the crab was \\"fishy\\", which was unusual for crab.  My seafood ravioli was good (loaded with crab, scallop, and shrimp) but the dish included some spinach and ricotta raviolis. They were tasty but I was surprised since  the menu did not indicate this. It was as if they throw those in as \\"fillers\\" so they would not have to provide as many of the seafood ones.\\n\\nMy husband ordered the seared ahi tuna, which was a huge disappointment. The tuna was slighly overcooked but more than anything, it was not very fresh because it was a little mealy. My husband who would never send anything back and leave negative feedback said it was \\"ok\\" but I knew he was not happy with it. I mentioned to the waiter that the tuna wasn't very fresh but was \\"ok\\". We weren't expecting him to do anything but to just give the feedback to the chef and owners. \\n\\nDessert was pretty good -- the heath bar bread pudding. Perhaps the highlight of the whole meal. Actually, they do have a wide selection of different beers which was nice to see. I fancy Belgian ales myself. \\n\\nI would probably go back for the beer selection and maybe try their pub menu but significant improvement is needed on ingredient quality to justify the prices on the dining room menu. Otherwise, this is pretty much one of those places where you go for only burgers and beers. I also should mention that both my husband and I had very bad reactions after our meal. Unfortunately, I can not say whether it was the food or maybe our eating just a little too much. Thus, I give it two stars.\\n\\nOh, and I should comment on the decor since most reviewers have.

I don't eat ketchup, so, I appreciate a good french fry that does not need ketchup to cover for a tasteless, greasy fried potato. The bacon on the burger was smokey and a little salty, like it's supposed to be. The cheddar cheese was nothing special (should be a thick slice of sharp cheddar in my opinion). The $7.99 special, any burger, fries and a drink is about average for a quality burger, so, no complaints there. There are picnic tables outside where you can smoke, unheard of in P.C. Austin.

The Scotch Egg is a bit expensive for the size, but it's incredibly flavorful.  The Vegetable Curry is a great decent-sized dish for a reasonable price.  The true reason to come to Rose & Crown (and arguably to Epcot - just kidding of course!) is the beer.

I love love hanging out down here. The bartenders are fantastic. One time after a Sox game, they were pretty low on the beer-age, so I tried a random beer. Hated it, but who am I to be wasteful? When I was halfway done, the bartender came over and asked how we were. I said, \\"Okay\\", and he bought me and my friend a round of different beers. \\n3) Charity. Redbones donates food to local events. Gotta love a restaurant that supports its community! \\n4) Catfish Strips. Now that Bob's is gone.. my loyalty lies here. \\n5) Being green. They have their old fryer oil recycled and turned into biodiesel. They also have bicycle delivery and even a bike valet!\\n\\nNope..

There is instantly a non-food odd smell when you walk in there that I can't really describe. You get past the smell after food comes out at your table and around you but I'm not sure I like the idea of going to a restaurant that smells weird right off the bat from the entryway. The restaurant is in what appears to be an old house or office which is odd but seems to be a \\"thing\\" now that I don't really understand. That wouldn't bother me except the place itself is extremely outdated not just decor wise but the booth we sat in was broken!

The lobster roll is prepared so that you really notice and enjoy the lobster itself first and foremost above the other flavors. Neptune offers a variety of oysters, and provide a small guide that describes the flavors of each type (if you sit at the bar, you can also chat with the raw bar person directly for advice on what to order). Everything I've eaten here has been fresh, fresh, fresh, which is so important with seafood generally and raw bars in particular.\\n\\nAnother menu item which I ordered because it sounds interesting is the veal and tuna sandwich. This was actually really yummy! It featured thinly shaved veal and tuna tartare. It sounds odd, but the combination works.\\n\\nThey do have a few non-seafood items on the menu, but I don't know anyone who's tried them. \\n\\nThe beer selection at Neptune is limited. They have maybe four types of beer on draft, including Peroni, and pours are smallish (maybe 12 ounces?). The wine list is more expansive and seems particularly strong on the whites, which makes sense since those are typically paired with seafood.\\n\\nAs others have mentioned, Neptune is really small, so you'll probably have to wait for a seat. If you're with a small group, you may have luck sitting at the bar. When I came with a larger group (8 people), they took my name and cell phone number and called me when the table was ready. They told me it would be 2 hours and it was, but because they took my cell number we were able to go to a nearby bar for drinks while we waited. It worked really well.\\n\\nMy one hesitation with Neptune is that it is very expensive. I've been a little shocked by my bill every time I've come here.

We are a local family, and as such we reserve special occasions for Joey D's.  This was just such an occasion, we arrive for the lunch service right at the height of a rush.\\n\\nOur server greeted us almost immediately with nothing.  I seemed to remember a tray with water glasses before...Anyway, having to order water at a restaurant with the ambiance of Joey D's was off-putting.  Little did we know this was also to be the only glass of water, or refill, we would receive until we complained to one of the staff who seemed more concerned with turning tables over (which were not resat at the time we left) than ensuring guests were provided water.  There were so many staff.\\n\\nAnyway, the server seemed disinterested, wouldn't look at us, no smiling, etc.   I ordered a burger with cheese and bacon, medium.  Sister got BBQ pork sandwich with fries, parents got chicken salads.  \\n\\nFood arrived, burger had no bacon, burnt to a crisp around the side, tasteless Well Well Done.  Sister got cole slaw instead of fries, the runner who brought it out brought her fries when we told him IMMEDIATELY, more on him later.  Parents' salads seemed fine, as you would expect.\\n\\nServer dropped the bill without us even asking and not asking to take anything away we had finished.  Instead he said that he'd be in the back if we need anything.  How are we gonna get YOU, if you're in the back, and you never said your name? and there was 40 dollars extra of food on the bill.  Now I work in a restaurant, and a career server told me that she has done this before, you just forget to close out the previous tab at the station and start entering stuff to fire it.\\n\\nManger came over to apologize, the runner from before cleared our plates.  He was the only one who smiled and seemed personable.\\n\\nAt any rate, an unfortunate occurrence because it became such a focal point of the conversation.

They also had a proper cold brew set up which was pretty cool to see. To the right of the coffee bar they had some savouries, wines, baked goods and more. Porto Cafe served wine during the evenings, and if you happened to drop by during their happy hour, you could get some wine at a very affordable price!\\n\\nThere was lots of space in the cafe, and lots of natural light too with all the windows. I loved how simple and minimalistic everything was, leaving lots of open space. That made dropping by the cafe with a big stroller a lot easier for us.\\n\\nI ordered a cup of latte with a charcuterie board to share with my husband. Hubby ordered double shots of espresso, which hadn't come out yet by this point.\\n\\nThe complete picture with my hubby's espresso! Hubby wasn't expecting to enjoy his espresso as much as he thought he would because it was his first time trying Pallet roasters. As coffee was more lightly roasted than he personally liked these days, he thought Pallet roasters would also be too light and acidic for him (think 49th & Parallel); however, he was pleasantly satisfied with the double shot of espresso from Pallet roasters. Of course, it's not just the coffee beans but also the machine and the barista behind it that created the perfect cup of java for him! Hubby said he'd definitely come back to Porto Cafe for the coffee.\\nMy latte was great as well- I don't know a lot about coffee so I can't comment much, but my cup of caffeine wasn't too hard on my stomach and its smooth finish made it quite enjoyable.\\n\\nNow the charcuterie board probably wasn't the best thing that matched well with coffee, but I wanted it because I hadn't had a charcuterie board in over a year as I was pregnant. So I couldn't resist! The plate wasn't too expensive, and it was great for sharing . It was a great afternoon snack for the two of us, and both of us were pretty happy with everything!\\n\\nOur experience at Porto Cafe was pleasurable, and we left thinking that we would love to come back at a later time. The ample space for strollers, the good coffee, wine, friendly service, and free parking in the rear... were just some of the things that we loved.

We ordered the Family Pak which provided 1-1/2 lbs of meat and some sides.   After all, we were on a 5 day visit and didn't want to overload on the first stop.  This was an early afternoon visit.\\n\\nThe brisket was acceptable, not dry, but not really juicy.  It had a good rub with a slight sweetness, with overall good flavor, with 1/8-1/4\\" smoke ring.  It was fine, but did not knock anyone's socks off.  With all of us coming from other locations without access to good barbeque, we would be glad to get this at home.\\n\\nThe ribs were very smoky, pink all the way through, with a nicely flavored rub forming a crust.  These were pretty good ribs and I would certainly eat them again.  They were the smokiest we had on a six barbeque stops trip.\\n\\nThe sausage was very finely ground with a soft texture, which was a strong favorite of several in the group, but a bit mushy for others.  It was advertised as Elgin Sausage, but did not match what we had later at Southside in Elgin.  It had great smoke flavor and was not laced with garlic, which is nice.\\n\\nThe sauce was slightly translucent, slightly spicy, tangy balanced with a little sweetness and pretty good, although I mostly ate the meat without sauce.  As for sides, the potato salad was pretty standard with yellow mustard.  The slaw was a fine chop, pretty standard, creamy and somewhat sweet.  The pintos had pleasant chile heat, but when eaten by themselves were slightly bitter, maybe too much cumin.  They were generally OK with the meal.  You are not going to go there for the sides but you will probably not avoid the sides when you have a full meal here.  \\n\\nThe people behind the counter were very nice and helped us through the ordering process.

Nonetheless, I persevered.\\n\\nWatching the guy behind the counter make the sub is a joy. He slathered the fresh roll in hots and then squeezed on some balsamic vinegar glaze before topping it with the usual Italian sub ingredients.

First off, I was completely wrong about what this place is. I have lived in the area for years and have passed it hundreds of times (literally). I thought it was an upscale steak house like a Flemings or Ruth's Chris. But that is not what it is. It is more like an upscale Outback. So let's call it in between an Outback and a Flemings. \\n\\nWe each started with a cocktail that was mixed quite well. It was served quickly. \\n\\nFor an appetizer we had the Charbroiled Oysters. This is their knock off of a dish started by Drago's in New Orleans.  I would say Joey D's does it better than anyone outside of New Orleans that I have tried. Warm buttery oysters with garlic and Parmesan with good French bread!  Well done!  \\n\\nWe ordered a bottle of wine to come with dinner. Funny side note, the waiter said he had never sold a bottle of wine that expensive and it turns out they were out of it. It was a $75 bottle so we laughed it off and ordered a $36 Pinot Noir that worked just fine. \\n\\nThe salad with the house dressing was very very good. I highly recommend the honey mustard combined with the warm bacon dressing. The salad came with an amazing warm croissant. It literally melted in my mouth. \\n\\nI ordered the Garlic Strip and my wife got the filet. The filet was average. About as good as Outback. My strip had WAY too much garlic on it. I know I ordered the garlic strip, but holy cow. I scraped all the garlic off and it was still potent. The cut was just okay. It was cooked fine. For $29 (with side and salad) I got what I paid for. \\n\\nFor dessert we got the Hersey covered chocolate brownie with ice cream. Wow!  It was absolutely delicious. And for $5.95 with plenty for two, quite the bargain. \\n\\nOur server was attentive and very nice. Looked like all the servers were pretty young, so not a professional wait staff like I initially expected. But again, that is my fault for not doing my research and understanding what this place really is. And don't get me wrong, there is Nothing wrong with what Joey D's is because they are not trying to be something they aren't. Joey D's appears to be striving to be a very good restaurant at about $$ pricing. And I think they hit the mark almost perfectly.\\n\\nAll in all, it was a great bang for our buck. $137 pre-tip was our total for a 4 course meal for 2, including pre dinner cocktails and a bottle of wine!  You really can't beat that. Had my steak been just slightly better I may have even gone 5 Stars. There were some other compelling entrees on the menu so I for sure will go back and give one a whirl. \\n\\nNow that I know what Joey D's is, I will be back. If for nothing else maybe Happy Hour and some Charbroiled Oyster deliciousness."},{"name":"Mary's Cafe","address":"3209 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This place just deserves an A-OK review. I wish I liked this place but left feeling like I should of went somewhere else. \\n\\nPros: Cute little space, decent food, and friendly staff.\\n\\nCons: Vanilla and dirty chai latte = mehhhhh. The Vanilla latte tasted like it had wayyyyyy too much syrup and it was super milky with no coffee in it. Dirty Chai latte was probably the worst I've ever had in Austin. It didn't even taste like it had a shot of espresso in it. I was not a fan of this drink.\\nBreakfast sandwich = were pretty basic and didn't impress. I see why they only charge $5 for their breakfast sandwiches. Really though? The breakfast sandwich was superrrrr basic and not worth paying $5, maybe $2-3 dollars. \\n\\nAnyways I probably won't be back to this place anytime soon."},{"name":"Margarita Factory - Downtown Vancouver","address":"1004 Washington St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been to this location more than once and am never disappointed.

Tip: If you order the Mediterranean Plate and a pizza be sure to order the wheat dough otherwise you'll overdose on the regular dough.\\n\\nThe staff is friendly but sometimes awkward like when I showed up 15 mins early to pick up my pizza.

I think their lunch specials are great, but their dinner menu is lack luster when quality and price are compared.  \\n\\nI have went here a few times on the weekends to check out the night scene and it was always disappointing.  Both upstairs and downstairs are usually packed, and it seems very clicky.  The service is usually not adequate to serve the amount of people standing at the bar.  Plus no JukeBox or live music, so you are stuck listening to whatever the bartenders brought on their MP3 player(though it usually isn't too bad).\\n\\nNow I will tell you why this place actually gets a rating of three.  There is with out a doubt no better beer selection in the immediate area.  They have over 30 beers on tap with a lot of them being from micro and local breweries.  You can always get a sample platter of beers if you are unsure what you want to order.  Plus for those who are a little more daring, the upstairs bar has a 'spin the wheel' option to decide your fate.

My first visit in February was equally superb and is also the reason I chose to bring them to Bondir. Service was/is impeccable, preparartions perfect. An experience unrivaled in Boston's culinary reperetoire.\\n\\nStarting with corn and potatoe chowder with roasted onion petal and chili oil. This hearty comfort soup sets a new standard for food that should not be as good as it is. \\n\\nA spiced poached beet salad with fine herbs and vinaigrette of buttermilk and pistachio allows the chef to demonstrate his mastery of preparing a difficult ingredient into a unique and noteworthy course celebrating the season and the root.\\n\\nNext we sample the rabbit galantine. Cucumber mint and yogurt dressing alongside shaved vegetable salad. A quintessentially French country dish straight from the Provence region. An original take on a charcuterie that is avoided by most due to difficulty in preparation. Taking the forcemeat of additional animals minced with pork and rolling in a de-boned rabbit body to simmer in a bouqet garni stock for several hours is more than most chefs care to attempt. Not here, an incredibly fine demonstration of skillful hands using unique ingrdients to enhance the apallate of otherwise finicky diners.\\n\\nFollowed by blood red corn grits, braised rabbit, beet greens and gumbo file. A dual preparation of country grandeaur using the rack of rabbit to add protein to this starchy entre-course. Sassafras entwined the combination.\\n\\nSteamed summer veggies, mustard oil polenta and glace add another layer of substance that incorportes irony proteins with savory substance.\\n\\nCalamintha, read mint, pappardele, accompanies a wonderful confit duck with ricotta and arrowhead cabbage.\\n\\nThe roasted bluefish with eggplant, broccoli, purslane and shellfish vinaigrette is fresh, unique and singularly unfishy. \\n\\nLocal chicken leg, thigh and breast with roasted squash, white flint cornmeal cake new corn kernels and special onion enlivens this multifaceted eating triumph.\\n\\nBeef bavette next to white carrots glazed in butter and sugar, delectably sweet, while triticale wheat berry is tender, diametrically opposite  the wonderfully prepared medium rare meat. \\n\\nWithout a doubt, Chef Bond prepares an incrediblly diverse and tasteful menu that outshines any restaurant in the Boston metro area. Ordering the entire menu using the half portion option for the entrees allows one to create a tasting menu of the chef/proprietors specialities. \\n\\nTake a trip to Cambridge to check out this quaint French country style affair."},{"name":"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse","address":"8285 Red Bug Lake Rd","city":"Oviedo","stars":"3","text":"Their Chicago style deep dish pizza is not worth eating - go to Giordano's or Uno's for the good stuff.

Fresh raw oysters and clams were great to start off here.  They have great variety.  I then opted to get the lobster speghettini.  Portion was huge.  It made me think I shouldn't have the raw stuff but I figured I had a long flight I'd just skip out on dinner.

No reservations are taken. And with a large group (like 6) seating, it can be on the longer end.

Yes, sometimes French toast is boring as it comes, but this one was super good. The caramelized syrup with the banana gave it a nice touch. The bf's burger was pretty tasty as well.

It was a waste for me to try it. I honestly just recommend getting the regular mimosa since the there were only 3 blueberries in mine and the rest was a blueberry shot of vodka.

This place continues to disappoint. They have some real issues with their standards and training. I hope the manager and/or ownership can fix the issues because the area needs more options for casual dining. \\n\\nLet's start with basics. If you like eating with utensils, this place may not be for you. We thought the night was going to be a success because we actually got our silverware when seated. This was a groundbreaking first! I can't tell you how many times I have looked around the dining room to see food delivered to tables only to have dining delayed and food cooling further (more on that in a moment) while silverware is tracked down. A restaurant should have enough silverware to seat the entire restaurant all at once x 2.5-3.0. This place appears to be short on silverware. Literally, this visit was the first time we got it at time of seating. Progress that raised our hopes for a fleeting few minutes. \\n\\nNow on to the food. If you like hot food, this is not the place for you. This restaurant appears to specialize in lukewarm food, which is not to my liking. The final straw, dinner for two - both were chicken dishes - both served lukewarm, one with room temp rice and beans and the other with room temp potatoes and uncooked broccoli. The broccoli wasn't cooked at all. Previous meals have been the mahi and shrimp in which I could either get hot fish or hot shrimp, but never both in the same serving.\\n\\nAs someone who worked in the restaurant business for years, many of the first disappointments were overlooked. What can I say, I am too kind and forgiving. Then as what I hoped were exceptions showed themselves to be trends, I raised the issue to the manager. Maybe he didn't know and I could help him. The manager comped a few meals and apologized the last few times. But in the end, I am not going out for a free meal. I want a hot meal with silverware with which to eat it. I want to pay for a hot meal.\\n\\nA side note here. When the plate is hotter than the food, it means that the food died in the window. This is a restaurant term that means it was cooked and plated and placed under a heat lamp so long that the food cooled while the plate heated. When a server comes to you with a mitt or cloth to carry the plate, 90% of the time, this means your food has been sitting in the window for 5+ minutes. My last visit - warm plate lukewarm food.\\n\\nWrapping this up, when I finally talk with the manager during my last visit, he says that this never happens. They never have this problem... They so rarely comp food... Well, he needs to read Yelp to see that this is a systemic problem that needs attention. Perhaps they need a new manager with open eyes to see the problems. But, this guy seems nice enough so I hope he can turn things around. \\n\\nThe servers here need training too. Two tables next to us tonight got their dinner salads and soups 10 seconds before their entrees. Pacing of a meal is a concept that needs training at this location. Appetizers or salads or soups should be served with ample time to eat them without stacking plates on a table. It is bad practice for so many reasons- food cools further before it is eaten being among them. It also makes people look glutinous to have 2-3 plates per guest on the table. Also, drinks/glasses should not be touched such that a servers fingers are around the rim of the glass. It's disgusting. And, though we have had some that are friendly, most appear to be rather disappointed to be working there. \\n\\nI would offer that this manager should visit some competing restaurants to see how they do things. Almost anyplace in the area is better (sorry Rock & Brews - you struggle with cooking food thoroughly). The potential is there for a good experience. The recipes are good. The atmosphere is good. If they could just get hot food to the table with silverware already in place, we would be regular diners."},{"name":"OAK Long Bar + Kitchen","address":"138 St. James Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We were waiting for our room to be ready so we stopped into the bar for a drink and snack.

Ask for lots of tartar sauce if you want to be like me.\\n\\nTrying to dine in is stress-inducing, as there's usually a wait, and the floor itself is very crowded. The tables are so squeezed that you will often feel like you're sharing your table with a few strangers on either side. I do like the darker aesthetic of the basement, however. The painted wall is a source of idle fascination.\\n\\nMy preferred way of interacting with the place has evolved to occasional take-out orders of a pulled-pork sandwich. The meat will nearly overflow from its container when you get it, and you can get your hands messy in the comfort and privacy of your own home."},{"name":"Wild Wood Bakehouse","address":"3016 Guadalupe St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Absolutely gluten free, budget-friendly, and great quality food!

This is one of my go-to GF desserts. To me, it is like a chocolate-covered tiramisu dome. I absolutely love this dessert. \\n\\nI wouldn't get their GF Oreo again. The cookie was powdery and the filling had this odd texture. The taste wasn't anywhere near the caliber of the chocolate torte.

Why not try the soup place people seemed to like, they offer smoothies as well and that's just what we're looking for. They have many items on their menu that are quite intricate and others that are simple. My girl went with a simple watermelon/strawberry smoothie and I tired their busy bee without banana with extra mango and a pint of their chicken and rice soup. For a little over $20 I expected much much better. The watermelon/strawberry smoothie tasted like a $2 smoothie. You can tell they used very cheap strawberries for there was NO strawberry taste and a heavy water based watermelon flavor. I get the watermelons are generally water, but watermelon has flavor. Except in that smoothie. My busy bee was ok. The soup was just as bland or more bland than her watermelon/strawberry smoothie. I refuse to add salt to most if any of my foods and yet i found myself adding salt because if I didn't I was just eating hot water with wild rice and I believe chicken textured substitute. Neither of us finished our smoothies and soup and I felt as though it was a total waste of $20.

However, we still noticed groups congregated outside the restaurant as we drove past its location on the corner of Hawthorne and 23rd. We dropped our friend off to put her name down while we looked for street parking in the residential area. With no host to welcome her, she wrote down her name on a clipboard, which she didn't like. It felt hectic. Though the hungry crowd of people was a little daunting, the warm coffee cart left outside eased our wait. We stepped inside as our friend's name crept towards the top of the list. There was a large curtain to block the cold air, which was nice for those seated, but very awkward for those standing and waiting in the transition zone. Overall, the self-serve coffee was thoughtful, but the approach of Jam on Hawthorne was a little cumbersome and unwelcoming. \\n \\nThe combination of clinking, chattering, and music made the restaurant very loud. The 80s rock music playing overhead seemed like an attempt to be edgy and hip, along with the quirky d√©cor with mismatched chandeliers, string lights, funky paintings, giant chalkboards, and beads hanging from the ceiling. We were seated at a booth near the bar, which had two large flat screen TVs, one playing a sports channel and the other playing a movie. Though it was loud and busy, the in-store physical and sensory environment created a very casual and fun atmosphere. \\n\\n Jam on Hawthorne clearly pushed their drink menu more than anything, as they are especially known for their Bloody Marys and mimosas served in giant mason jars. There were four towering chalkboards throughout the restaurant, all with the same drink menu. The complete menu was trifold, and difficult to open all the way sitting with a large group. However, conversation became sparser once we were all served our food, as we became engrossed in the deliciousness of our eggs benedicts, waffles, and omelets. \\n\\n From our booth, we could see the waiters interacting behind the register, and it seemed unprofessional. All waiters were in casual, ununiformed dress. We had six different people wait on us at our table, and our main waiter seemed dismissive because it was so busy. We had coffee refills every three or so minutes, which got us all really amped up. Their intensity on checking IDs made all of us, drinking or not, uncomfortable. Looking around at the customers, everyone seemed to be enjoying their food. There were a lot of young families with children, and some of them were enjoying the kids play area. The kids area itself was a little underwhelming--and on a platform, which seemed a little dangerous, with one of the giant drink menu chalkboards directly above it--but the children looked like they were having fun with the toys available. \\n \\nSummary: great food, weird service."},{"name":"Olympian Diner & Restaurant","address":"17 Hancock St","city":"Braintree","stars":"4.5","text":"It's alright.

They had utensils wrapped up in cloth napkins, the srirachi and hoisin sauce were served when the entrees came out, on a small cute sauce dish instead of in big nondescript plastic bottles. I loved the music selection ! They were playing Top 40 (only the good songs at that) with some nice remixes I had never heard.\\n\\nBut onto the food. For appetizer we ordered the New Zealand lamb rolls. They tasted a little like the vermicelli with grilled beef that my husband ordered as his entree, but wrapped up into a nice succulent package, that you dip into fish sauce. It was delicious. About $3 or $3.50, which was a reasonable price.\\n\\nI really liked my husband's vermicelli bowl. The ratio of each of the ingredients was just right. I think I might order that the next time I go eat there.\\n\\nI got pho with beef (they don't really focus on pho here, so they don't have all the different selection of meats that you can get at dedicated pho restaurants, only eye round steak. I thought the broth was okay. Overall the pho was just okay. The one up-side I can say about it is that they gave plenty of noodles, which is a must for me!\\n\\nThe awesome way they capped off our meal was by giving us complimentary dessert. It was a delicious coffee-ish flan with accompanying ice cream (I think some kind of walnut or pecan ice cream with chocolate??). \\n\\nThe service was excellent as well. They were super friendly, and the food came out pretty quickly.\\n\\nThere were some other menu items that looked interesting and not the typical Vietnamese fare. They were a bit more expensive, but maybe I will try one of them next time. In any case, we'll be back."},{"name":"Yuki Shabu-Chinese Gourmet","address":"16 Bow St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Food is overpriced for the small portions they serve.

All I know is that ordinances in VanWa are very anti-food truck, much like Salem.\\n\\nMighty Bowl posts a lunch schedule for the week, and it's a regular rotation of lunch spots that include the Clark County courthouse area and Clark College. Usually open Mon-Thu.\\n\\nThe truck has a menu that reminds me of The Whole Bowl in Portland. It's a vegetarian dish with brown rice, black beans, cheddar cheese, salsa, sour cream, olives, avocado, and cilantro. Small bowls are $5.50 and large bowls are $6. If you really want that street food option, you can get any of the bowls in a wrap (\\"Rolled Bowl\\") for $6.75.\\n\\nBut here, you'll have three different sauces to choose from. Each sauce is gluten-free, dairy-free, and egg-free. The tangy house sauce used for their \\"Mighty Bowl\\" has that lemon curry flavor, extremely refreshing. The \\"Peanut Bowl\\" comes with a wonderful, mild peanut sauce that immediately screamed Thai to me (but not spicy).\\n\\nAnyone a zillion miles away could guess that I was picking the spicy option. The \\"Kiggins Bowl\\" gets topped with a spicy chipotle sauce. Kevin had an even spicier chipotle option that uses more jalapenos. Since I laugh at jalapenos, I quickly went with that. No sour cream for me, though. Never could get into that stuff.\\n\\nMuch like at The Whole Bowl, I loved the healthy, filling aspects this dish contains. The sauce had a mild kick, not too spicy. You'll appreciate the texture contrasts. Each component keeps its individual identity, but works well when combined and eaten together.\\n\\nThere is a rotating weekly salad option for $4. Hey, if you love salads, why not? Bring the kids as well, for there's a $2 kid's bowl option with beans, rice, cheese, and choice of sauce (and that can also become a wrap for 75 cents more).\\n\\nYeah, the weather's turned much colder, but The Mighty Bowl also carries 12 oz. smoothies for $3.75. The \\"Arnada\\" (mango, pineapple, OJ, and rice milk) was a big hit throughout the summer. Yet even now, the \\"Hough\\" (banana, cocoa, peanut butter, rice milk, and dates) is quite popular. Maybe because it sounds thicker, richer, and more appropriate for fall/winter?\\n\\nOh, and don't worry, the truck has an awning to provide a waiting area as the rainy, cooler weather comes back to the Pacific NW.\\n\\nThis is one awesome food truck! They are also on FB and Twitter, so you can get the latest updates on where they will be."},{"name":"Tommy Want Wingy","address":"94 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We absolutely loved the sweet chili wings.

For me, though, to get into 5-star territory, the burger would have to be cooked so it was a little more juicy, a little less well-done, and some of the flavors would have to pop a little more (the poblanos on my poblano burger didn't really show up the way I would have hoped).  To be fair, I went on Labor Day weekend, and the grill was slammed, so that might have factored in. \\n\\nMaybe reading all the 5-star reviews on Yelp before going to Lebowski's just got my hopes up a little too high.

I expected that 3/4 pound of meat would have a little more flavoring, but to me it just did not have the extra flavor I like with beef.  Not sure if it was the lack of salt or quality of the meat.  Nonetheless the additions to the burger made up what the meat was missing.  My brother loved his burger  and the fries and onion rings were terrific.\\n\\nPrices are very reasonable for what you get.\\n\\nWill I go back when I go to Columbus again?  ABSOLUTELY!  The menu is extensive and I want to try other things."},{"name":"Commune Kitchen","address":"203A Broadway","city":"Arlington","stars":"4.5","text":"We stopped by on Saturday and had a pizza and tartine.

The breakfast burrito is Chipotle-sized and packed with three eggs, chili and cheddar cheese. The chili was exactly how I like it: chunky, beany, slightly sweet and with just the right amount of spice. The burrito is perfect for a late hangover breakfast.

It's 12 ounces of unadulterated, red-blooded, American beef cooked to order and served with house made kettle chips, and this week, it's just 6 bucks. EAT614.COM has a week-long event featuring some of the best burgers in town for $6. When I saw Thurman's on the list, I couldn't pass up the opportunity.\\n\\nI had a lot of hype going into Thurman's yesterday. I had unreasonably high expectations from the creme de la creme of barfood in Columbus. Aside from its weighty reputation, 3 days of eating other $6 specials generally set the bar pretty high.\\n\\nWe walk in to an almost empty restaurant. Maybe it was because it was 10:30 at night. Maybe it's because New England was playing, and no one in Columbus wants people to think they like the Pats. Regardless, we mozied up to the bar and got the special: the American Cheeseburger.\\n\\nThe food came pretty quickly. I wasn't keeping track of time, but it couldn't have been more than 20 minutes because my friend isn't all that great a conversationalist. I was taught not to trust food that comes out too quick, but the beef was cooked perfectly. A Thurman's hamburger is like Gabriel Inglesias: it's tender, it's juicy, and there's plenty to go around. If you've never been there before, I'd recommend eating the chips first, because the patty drips... a lot. The bun is formidable, but you can only ask so much of two pieces of white bread in the face of 3/4 pounds of meaty beefy deliciousness.\\n\\nThe bill was $10 for a burger and a beer. Normally a burger is $12-15. And for the ground-and-grilled heaven I experienced yesterday, and I'd pay double that. In a world with more McDonalds than public libraries, Thurman's is on a 1-bar-mission to make burgers great again, one patty at a time."},{"name":"Roadworthy","address":"125 Washington St","city":"Dedham","stars":"5","text":"Excellent food warm and hospitable service!

Since this Chipotle was located somewhat between where each of us were coming from, we decided this would be the perfect spot for a quick but delicious dinner.\\n\\nWe arrived around 7:45 pm, and I thought they'd be crowded. Oddly enough but fortunately for us, there were only two people in line when we walked in.  Yay for no wait at Chipotle!  =)\\n\\nI ordered my usual - a Steak Burrito with plain white rice (absolutely no cilantro for me), pinto beans, red-chili salsa, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce.  (Note: For other cilantro haters, if you want plain white rice, just request it and they get you some from their container of cooked rice waiting to be mixed with cilantro-lime, etc.)  I also asked for some sour cream in a separate container.  I recently picked up the bad habit of adding more sour cream to my burrito.  I don't even wanna think about how many more calories it adds to the 875+ calorie (yes, seriously!) burrito, but it's just so delicious...\\n\\nAfter paying for my burrito and grabbing a bottle of Tabasco Chipotle Pepper Sauce from the condiments area by the fountain drink machine, I looked around and noticed how clean and spacious the dining area was!  I'm not sure if it was just because it was pretty empty, but it looked like one of the largest dining areas I had seen at a Chipotle restaurant!  I was impressed and really liked it.\\n\\nAs expected, my steak burrito was as delicious as expected.  The only thing that could have made it better was if there was more steak and less white rice (they put SO much in it, even when I asked for \\"a little.\\")  But that's just me being greedy.\\n\\nOverall, this Chipotle gets 4.5 stars for their fast service (yes, they weren't busy at the time, but still), friendly employees, spacious dining area, clean appearance, and awesome steak burrito.  Since I've only been to this Chipotle once, I can't quite give them 5 stars yet, but I will update accordingly after more visits.

The lack of professionalism and basic respect for customers is unbelievable from the bar staff as well as management. My two girlfriends and I walked in around 4pm looking to warm up with cocktails and appetizers. Talk about an UNHAPPY hour. As we walked in, we notice that the temperature inside is barely warmer than the outside. We are in the middle of an arctic blast with temps in the teens. I made a joke about free round of shots. Right away, I let the waiter know I'm a neighbor in atlantic station. We were ordering our pomegranate margaritas and inquired about the guacamole. Jonathon was an a very attractive bartender but was lacking basic customer service. I think those in fast  food windows would be better qualified to serve you at this bar. He needs to learn from bartenders like Arturo, who is just plain awesome. Jonathan called the happy hour priced guacamole \\"not fresh\\" and the \\"fresh one\\" is more expensive and made just for your table. Great way to describe food in an upscale mexican place. The fresh guac and our drinks were perfect. We later ordered tacos. We were never asked how anything was. We were among the few tables in the whole place and the only one at the bar. Jonathon was nowhere to be found as he later blurted out that he was warming up in the kitchen. The first manager we talked to was Frank. He literally walked away mid sentence as we were trying to let him know we were having issues. In response to the complaint about the broken heater, he said the building was too big to heat and that its \\"better to come in the summertime.\\" So they don't welcome business in the winter? He walked away and came to the hostess stand where him and another employee were likely badmouthing us. At one point my girlfriend had to call the hostess on her phone because we were sitting for 20 minutes with empty drinks and there was no one visible. We asked to talk to a second manager Erik. We mentioned that our table wasn't clean when we sat down. Nothing was done. He shrugged his shoulders, said sorry, and walked away. Later on while my girlfriend was in the restroom, Jonathon asked us what her problem was besides the heat not working. Way to be rude. All of us were unhappy with the service.\\n\\nEveryone is upset about this place being overpriced. I go out to high end restaurants regularly and would happily pay if my service and food is somewhat good.

I normally also get the half regular/half spicy broth. One thing that I like about this Little Sheep, as compared to the one in the US, is that there is a sauce station for you to make and mix your sauces (I like the peanut sauce the best).\\n\\nThe only thing that is a negative is the pricing. All you can eat is $20 per person, but they charge you $10 for the broth, and if you want cilantro or green onions, they are $1 each.\\n\\nHowever, this is a good place to go since it is located across from Metrotown and they have underground parking."},{"name":"Greens and Grille","address":"11325 University Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Love this place.

Fiance and I were in Boston for the weekend and prior to going we really researched where we should go to eat.  Being that we both reeeeeeallyyyy love a good lobster roll we checked Yelp and came up with this place.  We knew there was going to be a wait so we scoped bars out ahead of time to chill at.  It is a very good thing we did as there are literally like 8 tables in the whole place and a long bar that isn't used for bar patrons but rather as dinner seating.  We got there at 8:15 and were told it was a 2 hour wait, no biggie and gave our cell phone # to be called when ready.  As we were leaving and mentioning the wait a threesome was walking in, overheard us and said \\"wow, a 2 hour wait?\\" (I mention this for later reference...).  So we head across the street to a pub for some drinks, get a call at 10:30 our \\"table\\" was ready and head back.  We let the hostess/waitress know who we are and proceed to stand there for 20 minutes, unable to get a drink but watch a few people get up from the bar and the hostess seat the threesome from earlier in the evening that we had spoke to coming in AFTER we had placed our names.  OK that's odd, you called us 20 minutes ago and are now seating a party we know came in after, and are now completely ignoring us.  A simple, \\"hey guys I know you are waiting it will just be a few more minutes, or can I get you a drink while you stand there in the middle of the restaurant?\\" Nope, nada.  I actually tried to make eye contact several times and it was clear she was ignoring us. So finally at around 11:15 we are seated at out \\"table\\", and by table I mean the bar (which I actually do not mind but the service/rudeness from this server doubling as hostess put me off).  We ended up being really glad we were sat at the bar because our server here was super friendly and really on top of things.  It is cool too because the bar serves also as the raw bar at one end and we were seated there and could see all the amazing-ness being shucked and served. We started with some oysters (wellfleet, kumamoto, and blue points) as well as a couple of the biggest shrimp cocktails I have ever seen; all amazingly fresh and tasty.  Then we each had a lobster roll; I went with the hot roll as was highly recommended and my fiance the cold.  They were decent but definitely not the \\"knock your socks off\\" we were expecting and needed some seasoning, I actually liked his better and being the sweetie he is we switched, we thought they would be better though with a different roll, these were too bulky and tasted too charred.  All in all the food was good and most of the service was ok, but I really didn't see the hype.  For Boston I expected better, Luke's and Pearl in NYC blow this out of the water.  \\nTo those who read this all the way through, sorry for such a long review :-)"},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"It's food, served on biscuits.

Seriously you are that out of ketchup already?\\n\\nIt took like 15 minutes for us to get our stupid shakes. I guess they had to make the ice cream or something. But considering how long it took, it would have been nice if they followed the \\"no whipped cream\\" order from my boyfriend. Our server said she told them no whipped cream, so of course instead of remaking the shake they just took off the whipped cream and then some of the shake, as you can see in the picture I uploaded. If my shake wasn't white it would be easier to see that they took a lot off. \\n\\nHe ended up drinking it all and mentioned it to the server after and she was like we can make another. He said he didn't need another but really we would have been there until new year waiting for a new one.\\n\\nI was pretty psyched for the white chocolate shake because it seems popular but it was lame. It hardly tasted like white chocolate, and don't give me that \\"white chocolate isn't real chocolate\\" BS. It was like just having a vanilla shake.\\n\\nSo yeah, if you want to go here so badly, just get it to go, but I highly recommend considering somewhere else with burgers nearby first.

It was featured on Food Network after all, and they have very positive reviews on Yelp. But when I came to eat here, it was a clusterfuck inside. There is a lot of people, but it's not very organized. There wasn't really a line, you just stand around and wait for someone to notice you. The workers have a little device where they put in your order and then you pay at the register. I was patiently waiting to order and then one of the girls working there starts taking an order for the people behind me even though they weren't ready. Again, the next person went to take some other person's order that was standing behind me.\\n\\nI finally got in my order. Which was a chai tea latte, sticky bun, vanilla cream donut, Boston cream pie, and a coconut macaroon. Also, they took down my name. Which I know most people get wrong, but I spelled it out for them. They kept calling me Kinsey. I don't know how K looks like M. Even when I corrected them, they continued to call me that.\\n\\nTrolls at work.\\n\\nAs for the food... I thought the best thing was the Boston cream pie. Everything else, I felt like I was expecting a fresh-from-the-oven kind of taste. But I didn't get that. The sticky bun tastes like pecan pie, which I liked, but found the actual bread to be too dense from being cold. Had it been warmer and softer, it'd be delicious. That goes for the donut as well. The filling was great, but the dough part tasted a day old. The macaroon was so sweet that I took one bite and threw it away. Overall, I was quite disappointed."},{"name":"Italian Kitchen","address":"860 Burrard St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Had lunch here last week, based on reviews I saw on Yelp.\\n\\nBusy place; I was here for a business meeting and we showed up for lunch at around 12:30pm, which is definitely dead in the middle of their lunch prime-time. We stayed until just after 2pm, and it was almost as busy when we left as it was when we walked in.\\n\\nGetting a reservation for lunch was a snap the same morning, although I've heard it gets pretty busy for dinner and getting in requires a little more planning (i.e. book a couple of days ahead, at the least.)\\n\\nSeating was good, the ambiance is definitely nice and businesslike. It feels a bit like a hotel lounge, a little cool and standoffish, but not necessarily in a bad way. I'd bet it's a little different for dinner, mind you. Probably influenced by the crowd in there at the time.\\n\\nThe food was solid, if unspectacular. I didn't order anything huge, so I won't judge based on the rabbit (!) ravioli I ordered accidentally. The waitress mentioned the specials very quickly and I missed the bit about the rabbit. Well, I guess owning a rabbit in the past doesn't preclude you from eating one, but I wish I had paid slightly closer attention to her... next time, I guess. In any case, it was pretty good, so I'm not complaining. The portions for lunch (at least, of the ravioli) were quite small, so I ate slow to make it last. Maybe the other lunch menu stuff is bigger -- I saw other people with rather large meals compared to mine.\\n\\nI had a couple of coffees over lunch and the waitress brought me a two nicely-made Americanos instead of your regular drip coffee, which was nice. Didn't get quite the spectacular service I've seen mentioned by others on here, but it was definitely attentive and helpful, although when we tried to get the wireless internet password for the restaurant, it took 3 different waiters and/or waitresses to give us the right one.\\n\\nSo yeah, I'm reserving the right to update this review once I actually go to the Italian Kitchen for dinner.

So I had an old get-together with some friends and they wanted hotpot, and thinking about the Metrotown area, might as well come to the new kid on the block. I've had some good dinners at the Lansdowne location, and knowing that they are a world-wide chain, might as well not take the risk and just have a good dinner here.\\n\\nTaking up the spot of the old Sammy J's, you knew they had space to work with, and for an area with many Asian's, you knew this was going to be a popular place. Originally I thought the one who organized this made a reservation, as she did call, and they said that they would, and then coming here, we were waiting in line as they said they don't take reservations (which I find odd, as Richmond takes reservations). We waited a good 15 minutes then got our table, so it wasn't that bad, but cause we were a party of 5, they seated us at a 4 seater table and added a chair. It was packed like a mad zoo in there, which means business was booming. \\n\\nIf you have been to the other location, you probably know about the sauce cart, well this one has it too, and I was a little disappointed from the selection, as they did not have any green onion, garlic, and some other variations that the Richmond location had an abundance in. Also with the sauce cart, going for the satay sauce, there was just sauce, and no satay. Bringing my bowl of sauce back to the table we were ready to eat. The food came quite quick, the only problem with places like these is that they don't bring you exactly the number of items you order, and this was the case with this location.\\n\\nWhen you order 3 plates of a certain meat, you expect that, not at this place, were they were giving us one plate, and it wasn't just for the meat. When you order 5 corn, where it states 2 per order, and this is all you can eat, and I'm ordering it from the 'get-go' you expect these simple things to be met. Constantly, everytime we put in a multiple order of some dish, we were given less of that item, and it is frustrating, as it wasn't like ordering some absurd amount that the 5 of us had no chance of finishing. It's just a pain, as in looking forward to devour the food you wanted like a bunch of monsters, and having to wait a second round to order and they still do not do what they are told.\\n\\nWe had the yin-yang based soup, and I was surprised that the spicy side wasn't that spicy. Also we needed some drinks and ordered plum juice which was $2 per person, but it was bottomless. The service here was pretty good, always watching the water levels of your pot, and the drink levels of your glasses, coming around to take empty plates, the staff was attentive.\\n\\nWe weren't rushed, which was a plus, unlike some places who really watch the clock in terms of AYCE time limits, so that is good, and the quality of the raw food is what you expect from the \\"Little Sheep\\". They are still hanging up signage, and because of the holiday season, and the cold weather, there probably is a lot to get used to, but a good attempt for my first try, I have a feeling I will be back!"},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Not sure where to start.

We read some reviews on Yelp and drove by Magnolia cafe to find a huge line outside- so we figured it must be good. \\nThe wait-list seemed endless as I looked for an open spot; however, before I could get my name on the list the hostess yelled out that their were seats open at the chef bar. My husband and I really enjoy the chef bar so we bypassed the whole line and sat down. \\nOur server, Amanda, promptly approached us and handed us two menus.

From Eggs Benedict to Club Sandwich to Hummus/ Tabbouleh plates with Pita Bread, I had no idea what to order. \\nThe specials seemed popular, and it was Easter Sunday, so I figured they were probably a safe bet that it would be a good choice. \\nI ordered the Eggs Florentine and my husband ordered the Alaskan Benedict with Salmon. At that time I also ordered a Mimosa which our server forgot to bring (which amuses me because she was so prompt on asking us the minute we sat down if we'd like, \\"coffee, tea, Mimosa\\"- yet when I order one she forgets). We asked a different server for the Mimosa and she promptly retrieved it but it was almost not worth the glare I received from our waitress. \\nOur food came and it was as greasy as I'd expected.

So...the salad was big and delicious...and you know how sometimes you get a salad and it mostly lettuce and not much other stuff...this was just the opposite. It had tons of hot peppers, feta cheese, tomato, really delicious Greek olives, and cucumber with some lettuce. They have homemade dressing which was fab. And the beets were so good too.

Parking is mostly paid-street or you can use one of the many paid lots but may need to walk a bit.\\n\\nThe Sound Table is across the street from the eclectic Church (bar) which we deferred in favor or food - this was during the week so there were only a couple of tables, mostly of people drinking. We were there early enough that there wasn't anyone on stage (not sure if they schedule entertainment during the week as it is).\\n\\nThe interior is long and dark with a well-stocked bar along the back edge - there's additional seating upstairs. The interior is warm and inviting with great wood finishes and concrete, a bit eclectic-modernist. There's a short platform as a stage across from the bar and seating that stretches from the stage out towards the front window - I'd rate the place above casual and almost fine-dining (not that this is the expectation - I believe Sound Table is more known for the music, attitude and bar than the food).\\n\\nIt took a few minutes for our server to come by, but once things got started the service was quite good. This night's rotating tap featured the very excellent Creature Comforts Tropic√°lia - if you haven't tried this local Athens brew, trust me in saying it's one of the best things to recently peek its head out of Athens. As many of you know, I tend to stay away from anything sour, citrusy or with added fake-tasting flavors. This delicious American IPA has gorgeous color and an out-of-this world fruity-hoppy aroma. You'll get all kinds of crazy flavor hints: mango, orange, passion fruit - stuff I typically can't stand in beer but this all works together to produce something amazing. On draft this night so extra special and probably not pasteurized - make sure you try if if you ever see it on draft!\\n\\nWe were presented with two paper menus - one narrow two-sided menu with food (which seems to rotate seasonally) and a wider menu with drink specials. We started on some apps then went for entrees:\\n\\nSmoked Wings - these, in a word: fantastic! Smokey dry-rubbed wings with a delicious smoked chipotle aioli - I could have eaten several pounds of these and was left wishing we had a double-order.\\n\\nShrimp Chorizo Tacos - Three soft-corn tortillas with grilled shrimp, chipotle aioli, cilantro slaw and salsa. I liked these the least, but because they were bad, but because the other items we ordered were so good! These could have had a bit more kick, perhaps with a jalapeno coleslaw.\\n\\nLamb Burger with Fries - the burger was juicy and the clever Mediterranean toppins - cucumber, tomato, chevre, arugula and tzatziki sauce, perfection.\\n\\nBrick Chicken with Steamed Broccoli - all I have to say is that whomever is doing the cooking at Sound Table understands fried chicken.\\n\\nService was very good once it got started - the food was slow to hit the table but very well worth it in the end. In all I think the food here is very good and worth sampling - this is truly a hidden gem when it comes to Old Fourth Ward.

Bad life choice. Sometime later, I was relaxing on the lawn of the Commandant's house, clearing my thoughts as students of Berkeley produced their traditional concert. I asked a lady for a good place to get a lobster roll, explaining my prior failure. And she, without hesitation mentioned Neptune Oyster in Boston's North End, adding it to my to do list.\\n\\nThe trip was weeks in the making (as this post, weeks in the publishing). As often as I do it, I try not to go it alone. But weeks prior, time ran out before my family and I could walk in. And just a week before, I invited people from work with zero success. So here I was, requesting a table for one, and I was kinda glad that I did; the dining room was small and packed. Sardines in a can? The lay out sort of encouraged the family style atmosphere. Waiting on my table, I admired the silhouette that shucking oysters in the window, with the clean and fresh presence of lemons in the corner.\\n\\nSeated at the bar and presented a menu, the voyage began. As small as the menu was, I had some trouble navigating the menu, making such critical choices as what to have for dinner. I started with the P.E.I. mussels swimming in a red curry broth with a splash of lime off the shores of toasted cashews with sprouts of cilantro. (I thought about the johnny cake but I couldn't make myself feel better about paying two dollars more for a pancake regardless of what embellishment topped it.)\\n\\nAs I sipped my ginger ale :) in wait of the arrival of my mussels, the couple to my right visiting from Australia were having fun comparing a sampling from the raw bar, until my domed plate hit the bar. When I say domed, I'm referring to the bowl that hovered over the dish; I used it to harvest my shells. As the cover was removed, a fragrant cloud of smoke took its place. And when the smoke cleared, it revealed a heap of mussels, greater than I had imagined. I thought about asking my Australian neighbors for help but that just felt weird. So I got to work on the task at hand.\\n\\nI'm no mussel expert so forgive me if my use of the word buttery to describe their flavor offends you. There was more flavor in the broth to be spoken of. Pleasantly warm and cozy considering the cold front moving in over Boston. I could quite clearly taste all the flavors listed on the menu: the lime, cilantro, and garlic. It was a bit salty I must admit, but I was overall satisfied (what else can you expect out of the seas?). Perhaps a smaller portion would've been more palatable, for an appetizer at least. (By the way, I'm not complaining.)\\n\\nSomewhere during my analysis of my mussels, the folks to my right had moved on to their main course, which appeared as though it too was intended for sharing: the nights special, lobster spaghettini, and a warm, toasted lobster roll with melted butter and a pile of fries.  I promised myself I would have to return for the handsomely stuffed lobster roll.\\n\\nI had instead ordered arctic char. I think my reason for ordering was its accompaniments- some personal favorites. It was served atop farro, an ancient Middle Eastern variety of wheat, surrounded by cubes of roasted beets. I was intrigued, also, by the salad of sliced green grapes and cress and cr√®me fraiche that rested on top. At this point, my experience wasn't ruined but I did expect more. I've been trained to serve hot food on warm plates, and now when I go out I can't help but to feel the rim of my plate for the warmth that it ought to bear, and the only warmth on this plate was that which it coerced from the entr√©e at its center. Now this being a seafood restaurant, I certainly had high hopes for my fish: skin on, grilled or broiled crispy, yet moist and plump beneath the surface. Neptune got part of this right. The skin had crispy bits but it there was no consistent crunch. The fillet itself, however, was succulent. As for the beets, they were cold. I don't know if they were intended to be served cold but I felt they ought to have been served warm. The grapes pleasantly paired with the beets though- something to keep in mind for the future. (I might employ the combo when I go home for Christmas. )\\n\\nAnd finally, what meal is complete without dessert? This one was. Not that I was looking for any, but with the North End so heavily populated with bakeries and patisseries, it's not so uncommon for the restaurants here not to offer dessert, leaving it to those who stand solely for that purpose.\\n\\nPlease see through my tone and recognize that this is not a rant.

It's on the 30th floor of the US Bank Tower.  Easy to get to.  Anyhow, coming off the elevator, I was surprised to see how dark the place was.  I had made reservations months ago for a window seat.  We arrived 30 min early and was told there were no window seats available and it would be an hour wait.  HMMM.  I don't know how I feel about that.  I'm not sure why reserving and requesting a window seat is beneficial if you aren't going to RESERVE one for me.  \\n\\nAnyhow, we did not get a window seat and elected to be seated right away.  Our table was decorated with \\"happy anniversary\\" confetti and had a nice little happy anniversary card signed by some folks there.  That was a nice touch.  I can't recall our server's name (I will update when I remember) but he was magnificent from start to finish!!!  We ordered the clams as an appetizer and all I can say is that flavor is on point!!! I had the halibut, which had decent flavors.  Nothing to rave or complain about.  \\n\\nOverall, I'm glad I took the advice to come here.

The food is always great, despite less than stellar customer service. I like the wraps and the butter chicken. However, Friday night I placed an order for takeout through Yelp (my first time doing so). This was a big mistake.\\n\\nMy order went through and I received confirmation at 7:10p. I arrived at the restaurant around 7:30, and waited until 7:45p before I asked about my order. My online confirmation informed me that my wait time could be between 10-35 minutes. I thought that was fair. However, the guy working the register (apparently he is the assistant manager) mumbled about my order when I asked how long it would be. I could barely make out what he said, and he responded to my question: \\"I literally just asked you that.\\" Rude as it was, I let it slide. He told me to wait and it would be out soon.\\n\\nI waited until about 8:10p and went to the register again. The guy then told me that he didn't receive my order until 30 minutes ago, and that I needed to \\"speak with the yelp people\\" to find out about my order because he didn't have it. Why couldn't he have told me this the first time I asked? I was pretty frustrated at this point. He told me to again stand to the side so he could assist other customers. I was tired of waiting at this point, and I demanded a manager. The cashier made a phone call, and apparently no one responded. I was offered no solution, but was instead told to\\" f**ng wait over there\\" for my food. He would not give me my money back, and refused to help me further. The servers refused to help me either, since quote \\"he is my boss, and I can't do anything\\". \\n\\nI was forced to wait another 10 minutes for my food, since I could not get my refund. When I got home, I discovered 3 out of my 4 items to be incorrect, and came to the conclusion that they likely just through random things into the bag and gave it to me to get me out of the door.\\n\\nI ended up leaving my name and number with a server to give to the manager/owner so I could speak with them. I have yet to hear anything back, and I don't expect I will. Beware of this establishment, and making Eat24 orders through them. They clearly can't handle the stress of online orders. Since the management doesn't care about its customers, and will likely swear at you for demanding the service you paid for, I will make sure everyone knows about my experience."},{"name":"Lovely's Fifty Fifty","address":"4039 Mississippi Ave N, Ste 101","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The beans salad is just amazing.

And of course, they serve up gigantic, frosty margaritas that happily do not skimp on the tequila. \\n\\nAs for the food--it's a fresher, tastier take on Mexican favorites than any other place in Columbus offers. My favorite dish is the shrimp fajitas. These come out steaming and sizzling hot in their own cast-iron skillet, filled with generous chunks of beautiful green peppers, onions, and plump shrimp. Thank god--finally a place that does not skimp on the shrimp! These are the real deal--not the frozen, tiny, limp little cocktail shrimp thrown into so many fast-food-ish dishes. Along with this, you get a little container of warm flour tortillas and a plate with totally decent rice, refried beans, lettuce and sour cream. \\n\\nEverything I've ever tried there has been delicious and fresh, but still with that comforting Mex-American taste.

Another refilled drinks. Another brought food. Another cleared food. Server 2 refilled drinks again. We waited for the check for about 10 minutes and were starting to wonder if we needed to ask for it when it finally came from server 1. I hope they pool tips because we honestly don't know who our server was!\\n\\nOverall we enjoyed our dinner and would be back. The burgers were definitely the highlight. We'd probably skip the fries next time (nothing special) and for sure skip the pretzel bites."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Can we say ahhhMAZING!

In fact, the guy next to me had devoured his lobster roll and was ordering another platter of oysters by the time our food got to us. But that's not what made me most upset. What I was peeved about was the fact that when I asked our bartender where our food was, he simply said, \\"it's coming\\" and turns around to avoid us. no apology, no nothing. \\n\\nalso, they really need to expand this place.\\n\\ni think i'm done ranting. if i hadn't had to wait at all, i probably would have given this place a 3-3.5 based on the food. the oysters, yes, but the other stuff, i can get better elsewhere. you can get better customer service elsewhere too."},{"name":"Redbones BBQ","address":"55 Chester St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm going to start with the bad- which is the reason I'm giving this place only 3 stars.

To be frank, it was a huge disappointment.\\n\\nThe first dish was a huge plate with two tiny chicken fingers and rice on it. The plate could not have been more disproportionate to the food. A few minutes later we received another large plate with rice and two luke-warm dumplings. When the main dishes came - Shrimp in Chili Sauce, Fried Squid, and Beef with Sour Cabbage, things didn't get any better. Not enough food despite three dishes, but most importantly, none of them rated higher than 2/5. \\n\\nThe shrimp dish was thrown together with some generic chili sauce and frozen, pre-cut vegetables. Maybe 2 spoonfuls for each (we were two) at most. The beef with sour cabbage was an oily mess. I guess the fried squid was ok, but so small that it could have easily passed as an appetizer.\\n\\nI told the waitress that we were not happy with the quality of the food and that we thought the plating was bizarre for a three choice combo.

My favorite, however, is the roast beef sandwich, fresh airy white bread, relish mayo that is not overpowering but very flavorful, crunchy onions, lettuce, and tomato.

Needless to say, I'm a big fan.\\n\\nCovered in subway tiles with a long bar that spans the length of the restaurant, there's always a wait for a table, a buzz in the air, and a scene-y energy that makes me feel like I'm back in New York. I prefer a seat at the bar and a pint of a local brew, while scanning that evening's oyster list. There are plenty of local bivalves and beers on tap, but Neptune also flies in West Coast oysters...my personal fave.\\n\\nStart with a smattering of oyster selects and then move on to crudo; I tried both the hamachi ceviche with jalapeno-lime vinaigrette and the dayboat scallops with local apple marmalade...equally on point. The plated menu items are generously portioned and genuinely prepared with seasonal ingredients you can feel good about. The fare is \\"elevated seafood shack\\" featuring: fried Ipswich clams, buttermilk johnnycakes with smoked trout tartare and caviar, whole fish grilled a la plancha, and their signature dish, your choice of a hot butter or cold mayo Maine lobster roll served with french fries. For me, a hot buttered bun gets my vote every time.\\n\\nBonus: there's not a TV playing a Boston sports game in sight!

Luckily I travel for work and I go by all three Massachusetts locations on a regular basis. \\n\\nBe careful of the prices. They vary wildly from store to store.  I did a wide price comparison between The Wegmans In Northboro, Burlington, and the Market Basket in Hooksett NH and Hannaford in Manchester NH and found Wegmans in Burlington to be right on par with Market Basket in Hooksett.  Produce was cheaper at MB but everything else was just about the same -- even a little less when you buy Family Packs at Wegmans.  However, the Wegmans in Northboro is MUCH more expensive than the Burlington one, with the items I looked at running 40-60c higher in Northboro than the exact same items in Burlington. Interesting.  Mostly on National Brands, Store brands were consistent. Hannaford is overpriced when compared with the MB and Burlington Wegmans.  At least 10% higher overall...my price comparison featured about $220 worth of varying items throughout the store.\\n\\nIn summary, I will continue to shop at Wegmans in Burlington.

The restaurant is spacious and well staffed. While they do not take reservations, our party of 8 had no problems getting a table within 5 minutes. While lacking the blatantly prurient eye candy provided by the staff & patrons of The Tavern, it is clear that there must be some sort of hostess exchange program between the two institutions.\\n\\nThe wine list is stubbornly American with a slight nod to the western parts of Europe and the beer selection is mostly forgettable. The cocktail and martini menu is the size of a compact bible and in line with the 'six tier showcase bar' that dominates the restaurant like a cruise ship would if it crashed into an Ethan Allen showroom.\\n\\nThat said, my Californian Pinot Noir was of good quality and reasonably priced. A couple of my dining companions had mixed drinks and scotch and seemed to like them well enough.\\n\\nSince we were all anticipating the meat-comas to come, we only ordered one Appetizer for the table and that was the Calamari. The $10 appetizer was standard fare and might have come from any one of the many low to mid-range American restaurants that dot the suburbs like mushrooms after spring rains. Close your eyes and you could imagine that you were in a Maggiano's or Carrabbas or [insert your generic American restaurant name here]. Except for the fact that the Calamari at Maggiano's is enough to feed a family of 10 while the dish at Joey's was perfectly sized for a hobbit on a serious diet. I'm talking about 10-12 pieces of small squid and a dab of canned-tasting marinara on the side.\\n\\nMy filet was the right temperature at medium-rare and sufficiently warm and pink inside to cause no comment. That said, there was a bit too much charring on the outside and it was affecting the taste of the meat. There was also a little too much salt for my liking. I also didn't like the fairly large pieces of hard, gristly fat that dotted the filet. Kobe steak this ain't but at around $30, that's not really a fair comparison. The sauteed spinach side could have been anything sauteed to oblivion and then pounded with a mallet to reduce any remaining texture. It's a good thing it was green because that was pretty much the only distinguishable feature. The house salad is liberally sprinkled with bacon (good) and pieces of hard-boiled egg (also good) and comes with a gooey, buttery and sweet \\"honey croissant\\" which is actually pretty good.\\n\\nSo, the food was a solid 2.5 stars but I'm going to round the review up to 3 because this place seems like a reliable port in a neighborhood full of places that are far more generic and cookie-cutter. Also, the service was pretty good and the prices are decent.\\n\\nI won't be running back here the next chance I get, but I probably won't have to be drugged and put into a strait jacket before they bring me over either."},{"name":"Revolution Doughnuts","address":"908 W College Ave","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"Truly artisanal!

We had to wait a couple of minutes to put in our orders and the coffee took a little longer to come out than it does at our regular Starbucks, but the food came out relatively quickly. \\n\\nThe menu is heavy on breakfast: they have a number of egg sandwiches, a few breakfast wraps, crepes, french toast, waffles, and oatmeal. There are also a fair amount of lunch options: paninis, grilled cheese combos, wraps, and a few salads. Pastry and baked good options are a bit more limited: if you want something like that, I'd recommend trying one of the nearby bakeries instead. Beverage options are pretty standard for a coffee shop: lattes, cappuccinos, tea, and frappaccinos, in addition to a few smoothies and fresh-squeezed juices. \\n\\nThe cappuccino was okay, about middle of the road, while my iced hazelnut latte was tasty. They were very generous on the flavor shot (okay with me!). If you like your beverage lightly flavored though, I'd recommend specifying just a little bit of syrup. The breakfast wrap (scrambled egg, cheese, salsa, sour cream) was tasty, if not particularly remarkable, while my bf enjoyed his strawberry and banana crepe a lot. I was impressed with how nice and thin they got the crepe to be... it was probably the best-executed crepe I've tasted (though I'm no connoisseur)."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"A couple of suggestions: \\n1.

My family and I were visiting Columbus for thr day and decided to venture out. I had the Cajun omelet, kids had Homer pancakes and cinnamon toast crunch pancakes. My husband being cautious got original pancakes. The atmosphere was lively albeit thr music may be a little loud for some. Everyone was friendly and did I mention the food was amazing? The next time we're there, we'll be back."},{"name":"Food 101","address":"4969 Roswell Rd, Ste 200","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"This is a pretty dependable farm to table eatery.  I think the key to enjoying it to its maximum potential though, is to order something different every time you dine. Unfortunately I always order the fried chicken, as it never disappoints, & now I'm almost tired of it, & the chocolate cake! One may wonder how I could ever have (& meet) this type criteria, but wonder no more. It's of Biblically epic paradoxical reality that I'm in this realm. Though I chose to celebrate my birthday (again) there for lunch this week with a dear friend, going forward I'm holding off from Food 101 for a while, though I do recommend it! Highly! & get the fried chicken!"},{"name":"Commune Kitchen","address":"203A Broadway","city":"Arlington","stars":"4.5","text":"The best pizza.  Nothing even comes close.  Funky atmosphere.  Service is better now that they wait the tables.  Sunday hours close too early, but I suppose everyone needs a break, right? The pizza is kind of awesome and the poutine (cheese and gravey) french fries are a delicious snack.  yum yum pizza yum."},{"name":"Jack in the Box","address":"7815 NE 6th Ave","city":"Vancouver","stars":"1.5","text":"The new street tacos are very small they look nothing like the picture...2 to 3 pieces of meat on each taco on a tortilla about the size of a silver dollar..and they all 3 come in a small box...not individually wrapped like the pics"},{"name":"Tibby's New Orleans Kitchen","address":"2203 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"This is my second Tibby's visit and my feeling have not changed.  I just can't get into this restaurant. Today I initially got the seafood gumbo which after the first bite i sent back and ordered the Rita chicken. The rita chicken was not bad, I did enjoy the sausage in the rice. This dish was just okay nothing to write to yelp about for me at least.  I do like the decor of the restaurant with the pictures of New Orleans. Will i try Tibbys again, eh maybe!!"},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Does Neptune Oyster's famous lobster roll live up to the hype? To me, it absolutely does!! I went ~12:30pm on a Wednesday and only had to wait 10 mins. (The 10 mins was easy to pass because there are a bunch of cute little boutiques on the same street.)\\n\\nPros/food:\\n-clam chowder ($12): my cousin jokingly told me this would change my life, and I really think it did! I've never had such fresh clams in my clam chowder.\\n-lobster roll ($29): To me, there was only one way to order this - HOT, and no roll (as I consider that stomach filler food.. I'm all about the fries! :P). The huge, juicy, delicious lobster chunks arrived in a bowl, drenched with butter. Let me tell you the secret: dunk the lobster chunks in the butter, dunk the french fries in garlic aioli. \\n-Coke products! Thank god.\\n\\nOnly cons I can think of are:\\n-our bartender was slightly meh and slow to refill our drinks/take our orders. The male bartender took over and was much more attentive.\\n-small restaurant\\n\\nThe lobster roll was delicious (although I was initially apprehensive about a $29 sandwich).  Definitely a must-eat when in Boston. Come during off-peak hours."},{"name":"Dino's","address":"141 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This place is really great for subs, especially hot ones. I've gotten the meatball, steak pizzaiola, and steak and cheese and they've all been delish. Get all with extra cheese, as their cheese is great and adds to the flavors of the meatballs and the steak really well, especially with the steak and cheese since they actually melt the cheese into the steak so that every bite is full of cheesy, steaky goodness."},{"name":"Denny's","address":"11037 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Came here for a late breakfast on a Thursday. Prompt seating and great service by our waitress Hanane O. I ordered the Eggs in a Basket and a slice of French Toast. Pretty good amount of food for cheap, and tasty as well. Been to Denny's in NY before but service here is better. Mother got the Philly Cheesesteak, she liked it. Overall good experience."},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"WHAT A VIEW! \\n\\nThe place was packed solid but we managed to share a table with a sweet couple and then moved when an open spot became available. Then moved again when a better table opened. Then again when a window booth opened so we could enjoy the splendor of that amazing view of Mt Hood in all it's snow covered glory!\\n\\nSo with all that moving around, you'd think our waitress would've been annoyed, right? Not at all! She was super sweet. I'll have to look at my receipt and add her name later...she was a doll. She listened to what I like in a cocktail and made a suggestion...the CHAMPAGNE SUPERNOVA. It was so darn delicious. \\n\\nSide note: I went to just about every bar in PDX and I think this drink/place/waitress was my very fave! Unfortunately we only had a little bit of time to stop in before boarding our flight so we didn't get to eat, however, I did hear a lot of people commenting on how good the food was.\\n\\nCan't wait to go back!"},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious and an all around pleasant experience.\\n\\nFolks who complain should try what we did - brunch on a Wednesday.
