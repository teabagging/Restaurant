My duck was good as well, although my sides weren't as tasty as his.  Take his brussel sprouts and cauliflower pur√©e and put them on my plate and I would be even more happy!

There's SO many choices that paying the $20 for unlimited hot pot is worth it. You can get anything from a simple egg to a chinese main dish. The beginning starts with checking off the menu, and once you give it to the waitress, if you want to add more stuff, you just ask. \\n\\nThe broth is SO good. They have option of spicy or nutrition or both. That's honestly perfect for a party of people that can handle the spicy or those who cannot (AKA me). The nutrition is filled with red dates, and other very medicinal herbs that my mom used to make tea with for me when I was little. \\n\\nAll the ingredients are pretty good. For meat, they have beef, lamb, chicken and pork luncheon meat. The pork isn't what you think, it's just slices of ham(?) so I wouldn't get it. Everything is a good choice.

Seriously, get yourself up there ASAP -- so many great local businesses in one spot!\\n\\nI've had Local Roots on my list for a while now, mainly for two reasons: they use local ingredients and make most things from scratch + they have an extensive gluten-free menu! I mean... it's like they KNOW me or something.\\n\\nThe interior is really cute. It's a bit dark, so it's a nice date spot. But then there are lots of TVs, and they were playing some sport the night we were there. It was a little weird for me... it's this nice (but still casual) restaurant, serving lots of locally-sourced food, with a lot of people around the bar being loud and watching sports. That's not really up my alley, but definitely not a deal breaker. Just odd (imo).\\n\\nEveryone working at Local Roots was extremely nice and welcoming. (Side note: unlike some small towns around Columbus, Powell as a whole seems to be pretty darn inviting to all walks of life.) Our server was very sweet... not particularly helpful... but he totally got us everything we needed. \\n\\nBut back to the two main reasons I came to Local Roots in the first place:\\n\\n1. The locally-sourced food\\nI was so impressed with their menu! Lots of comfort foods, sprinkled with creativity, and most of it made from scratch. I've read a lot of reviews that talk about price, but I didn't see anything that was out of line for this type of restaurant. An Ohio, grass-fed burger for $9? Um, yes please. Locally-sourced, high-quality ingredients do cost a bit more than conventional ones, so if that's not your thing -- maybe skip Local Roots. \\n\\n2. The gluten-free menu\\nMan, oh man... I got a whole menu just for me! No asterisks on the regular menu telling me the sad substitutions I could eat... No silly burger salads that I was forced to eat... Local Roots made me feel special and like a normal person. There were so many choices, but when I heard they had a locally-made pizza crust, I was sold. And my meat-haven pizza was everything I wanted it to be. The crust was crispy and perfect, and the toppings were top-notch. \\n\\nI definitely dig Local Roots.

To say  that I will take every opportunity to share my experience with Arlington Cafe based on how I was treated this evening would be putting it lightly. This evening we ordered two buffalo grilled chicken wraps via foodler for pick up. I received a call from an unknown number within seconds of completing my order telling me that \\"the wraps come with certain ingredients and we do not usually put blue cheese dressing on the side\\",  something I requested for my wrap. Befuddled by the statement since food is made to order, I explained that I would be eating it later and would like the blue cheese on the side. After he argued with me about the (dare i say) special ingredients in a grilled buff wrap ie: lettuce, tomato, chicken, hot sauce and blue cheese *real special* he agreed to put on the side. Within moments I received an email from Foodler stating that Arlington Cafe requested a $ adjustment to increase the cost of the order. I was shocked - it's obvious that with such terrible customer service that the 'cafe' has plenty of time to put the effort in to adjust a $1 fee that was never agreed on and is quite frankly, ridiculous. \\n\\nWhen i went into the store and asked the unsavory 'owner' why i was charged the $1 fee, he went on to explain that putting the dressing on the side was 'extra work' and they charge for everything that differs from the menu. I recognize that it's a business and things cost money - but i did not ask for an 'extra' - i asked for something on the side and cannot fathom why that would justify a charge. Little to do with a $1 charge, my frustration with this persons unfathomable arrogance, I pushed back and asked why they would take the time to call me, make an adjustment via foodler (all of which take a hell of a lot more 'time' then putting my blue cheese on the side) would be worth losing a customer. Again, his arrogant and rude response was for me to not come back or be prepared to pay for an changes to the menu.\\n\\nRude 'Owner' of Arlington Cafe, I can tell you that you've clearly shown the cheap and terrible service you provide. A $1 means nothing to me, but is clearly the principle of your ridiculous (lack of) customer service. The day that a customer asked for money off of an item since they did not want lettuce or ketchup or whatever YOU would justify as 'less work' for you and your cooks would be a funny day. \\n\\nI love to support local stores and shops but yours I will never support again. \\n\\nI hope others take note - the moment when a so called dining establishment is irritated by a less than difficult request is the day that the doors of the so-called establishment should be permanently closed."},{"name":"Jack Allen's Kitchen Oak Hill","address":"7720 Hwy 71 W","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Jack Allen's is my absolute favorite restaurant in Austin.

This location is adjacent to the Embassy Suites Hotel.  I had to do some basic research for this one - here is why. \\n\\nWhen you walk into Ruth Chris it smells - old.  \\n\\nEmbassy Suites - is this the one built in 1988 and renovated in 2010?\\n\\nRuth Chris - is this the first one in Atlanta, opened circa. 1986?\\n\\nWell, the odor didn't deter us because that wasn't what we were there for.  We marched on in and grabbed a seat in the bar area.  \\n\\nThe non-inviting faces behind the bar could use a smile.  My dry joke didn't work.  But that was okay. They'd warm up eventually and came through like shining stars. \\n\\nOne word that can be used to describe the food at Ruth Chris - which is why we went there - for the food - is consistency.  \\n\\nThe steak, the mashed potatoes, the spinach - all on point.  As the trays of food were delivered to the other diners, even after we finished our meal, you could see the deliciousness just from the plating. \\n\\nRuth Chris - please stay consistent and I am pretty sure you will be around long after I am \\"old\\" and gone! \\n\\n#lovedit!"},{"name":"Cafe Java- Austin","address":"11900 Metric Blvd, Ste K","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This my go to breakfast spot anytime I visit Austin.

I asked the guy on the other end of the phone if it was a problem to substitute the feta for cheddar and hold the tomatoes, he replied that it was no problem and repeated the order back to me for confirmation.  He then told me that my total was $10.77 and that it would be ready in 5-10 minutes.  \\nMy husband and I arrived at Aviator's less than 10 minutes after I placed the order.  He went in to grab the salad and returned to my car window to tell me that I got the total wrong and he needed $2.00 more.  I gave it to him and then checked the price on my phone because I was sure I heard the guy on the phone correctly.  Yep, $9.95 plus tax is $10.77, not $12.77.  So, I pass my husband on his way out, go inside and ask the guy at the counter why I was told my total was less than they charged my husband.  He told me that I was told the wrong amount and it is store policy to charge $2.00 for any substitutions.  I asked why I wasn't informed of this on the phone, especially when cheddar is less expensive than feta.  He said, in a very condescending voice that he agreed that the rule is ridiculous and I didn't hear wrong, I was told $10.77 on the phone, and yes feta is more expensive, so he's sorry, but that's the way it is.  \\nSo, we've been regular customers since we lived in Elgin and they opened their first store, but this is the second time we've received less than great service at this location and I think we're done.  I'm a bit disgusted that it cost them less to keep the tomatoes, and use a cheaper cheese on a salad that is fresh made and they decided to charge me an extra $2.00 instead of making an exception to their rule since they told us a different amount to begin with.

All of our food was cold so it must have been sitting there for a while waiting to be brought up. The mozzarella sticks had to be heated up again (luckily we had a microwave in the room) and the cheese/beans/meat had hardened on the nachos. They charged us for guacamole but it wasn't there. We called back to have it sent up and they said they would be up \\"right away.\\" They never brought it up. We never received the guacamole and they didn't take it off of our bill. In my four days in Boston this was the worst food I ate. \\n\\nMaybe the pizza is better since that it what they're known for, but my advice is do not order room service from them if you are staying at the hotel.

SHOCKED!!! \\nI came here with my boyfriend after the South Boston St. Patrick's Day Parade. We were absolutely starving and checked out the menu outside the restaurant... it had a ton of options so we figured we would try something different. \\nWe walked in and were told by a waiter that we would be seated in a second. About 5 minutes later the waiter walked by again and I asked if we could just sit at the empty table in the corner. He said he was going to seat us there anyway so wait a minute. A few minutes later he came back over and led us the 5 steps to the table. Why we couldn't just sit on our own, I don't know. I have to note that the only reason I would give this place the 1 star is the cool decor and bathroom... but for me personally, that is not a reason to eat at a restaurant!\\nThe waiter threw down a menu and marker and walked away. After about 15 minutes no one had come over yet so I stood up and flagged down one of the waitresses (they were allover the place... I don't think they had any organization as to who served what table). My boyfriend ordered General Tso's Chicken, Boneless Spareribs and Crab Rangoons. I wasn't sure what I wanted yet (I have a tough time with such big menus lol) so I told the waitress that I would order when she came back with BF's apps. Another waitress came over a few minutes later and I ordered the Seafood Rice Noodles and a water. In the next 10 minutes we had 3 different waitresses come over and ask to take our order- none of them knowing that we had already ordered. Again, I don't think they have any type of plan about who serves who. \\nAbout 15 minutes after ordering we recieved the spareribs and rangoons. The rangoons were probably the worst I've ever had- clearly frozen and mass produced... and I've had a lot of rangoons! The spareribs were very different than usual- lot's of meat which is unusual but very little flavor. 10 minutes later I got my seafood noodles. At this point our tiny table could not fit another plate yet the waitress didn't bother to clear anything off the table. The noodles themself were actually pretty decent but the 2 shrimp, literally 1 scallop and bits of squid were completely flavorless. After another 20 minutes we still hadn't recieved the chicken or the water. I stood up again and flagged down a waitress. I told her we hadn't recieved the chicken and she said she would be right back with it. Another 10 minutes pass and I flag down our original waitress. I told her we hadn't recieved the chicken and she said, \\"Oh yea, the sesame chicken, I'll be right back.\\" I told her it was the General Tso's and she walked away. I tell no lie... 20 minutes later still no water or chicken. We were finished with the apps and noodle dish by this point and I had no desire to wait around for another 30 minutes for the BF to get and eat the chicken. I flagged down the waitress and told her we never recieved the chicken (to which she acted shocked) and that we didn't want it and were ready for the check. She said she was going to go check on the chicken and I repeated that we did not want it (even wrapped to go) and that we were ready to pay. 30 seconds later she came back with the General Tso's chicken. UMMMM NO THANKS! The BF felt bad so he took the chicken. He bit into a piece and it was straight up gelatin. DISGUSTING. He gets General Tso's/General Gau's at every restaurant where it is served and this was in no way, shape or form #1 General Tso's flavor and #2 CHICKEN! I cut into a piece and it had absolutely no resemblance to chicken. I can't think of any way to describe it besides gelatinous. The BF will eat just about anything but he couldn't even finish a piece of this. He is also feels bad about sending food back/complaining but he 100% agreed that this did not even resemble food. We sat for another 10 minutes before I stood up again and flagged down the waitress. I told her about the chicken and that we did not want it. She was actually pretty nice about it (I'm guessing they have had their share of complaints) and took it away. She brought over the bill and since we didn't want to wait another hour to pay, I walked to the register and paid. As I'm sure you can guess (if you have gotten this far into the review!), I will NOT be returning to this restaurant.

We called on Saturday to ask for a 7:30 reservation, walked in the door at 7:20, and were seated immediately. The restaurant was very full, and lots of people were talking across the room to other regular customers. They were very full, but made certain we had glasses full of water right away. \\n\\nI ordered a Mai Tai, and my husband ordered a Sangra beer. For an appetizer,  we got the \\"Something Grilled,\\" which is 2 chicken satay skewers, 2 beef satay skewers, and 2 grilled pork skewers, with peanut sauce and sweet chili sauce. The beef satay skewers were chewy in texture, the grilled pork less so. The chicken was incredibly tender. All of them had great flavor. The  peanut dipping sauce had a bit more spice than I expected, but was still incredibly good. \\n\\nMy husband also ordered the Mango's Spicy Wings. He enjoyed them, but they were sweeter than he expected. I'm not a wing fan, but I tried a bit of the sauce: definite orange and sesame flavors, lots of green onion garnish, a bit of spice. \\n\\nI ordered the Pad Thai as my entree. My husband ordered the Spicy Basil Fried Rice. Our one complaint: The entrees took quite a time to get to us; 15 minutes or more, even after we were done with our appetizers, and got the wait staff attention to get another round of drinks. One couple seated in a corner raised their voices to complain. \\n\\nHowever, once they arrived, the food was piping hot and literally steaming. My husband likes spicy food; he took a bite of his dish and said \\"Wow!\\" My Pad Thai was absolutely the best I've ever had. I had to stir it around to let it cool off. My husband noted that the steam was billowing off of my plate. His only complaint about his dish was that it had more red and green peppers than he expected,  but he admits he's a picky eater. He tried some of my dish, and liked it very much. \\n\\nOverall I am happy we went, and we plan to go back. They even gave out Mother's Day roses to every lady in the restaurant!

Their house salsa is nice & chunky with a mild-heat level.  The service was very friendly & attentive and the food came out quite fast.  I had the Tacos al Carbon which was delicious, but could have used a bit more of the cotija cheese sprinkled on top as there wasn't much of it.  The Hubs had the Deluxe Enchilada Tapatia with chicken & it was actually a bit bland.  It tasted okay & the chicken was tender, but the chicken really didn't have any seasoning to it.  I'm also not normally a fan of Spanish rice at these restaurants but I really liked theirs.  The refried beans were average, good, but nothing to write home about.\\n\\nTheir margaritas are huge & strong...seriously between the size of the beverage & the weight of the big glass they serve it in, I'm glad there was a straw so I didn't have to heft that big glass to drink it.

Also they had a great music playlist which added an eclectic energy to the place. I liked the service, it was accommodating and helpful. I LOVED the Nitro Chai Milk Latte I ordered. Soo smooth and sweet! I absolutely loved it!  The drawbacks of this restaurant was the ordering system. If you order food and drink be prepared to walk back and forth from one counter to the other side to get your food. So the pick orders are in different locations.

Location: It is located in Smyrna in a small run-down building. The restaurant has limited parking space, so we parked across the road and walked over. Figured they would offer valet since they know their parking spaces are so limited. \\n\\n2. Atmosphere: The restaurant is cute and intimate. When we came on a Saturday evening, there were live music. Pictures and artwork lines the walls. The restaurant is fairly small, so everything seem a bit cumbersome inside. \\n\\n3. Service: My fiance took me here for my birthday dinner, and while we thought the restaurant was cute, the service was very rushed. Our waitress was nice, but we could tell she was busy. Before we could finish our 2nd appetizer, the manager came out and took our dish away. The dish was still full. Once we notified the waitress that we weren't done with our appetizer, she apologized and got us another dish blaming the manager for the mistake. \\n\\n4. Price: The prices are extremely reasonable and actually cheap in my opinion. We had 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and 2 glasses of wine all for under $50. \\n\\n5. Food: The food was decent, nothing spectacular. I ordered a clams linguine and my fiance ordered the chicken parmesan dish. They were decent tasting, but from all the reviews, I was expecting better. \\n\\nOverall, it was a decent experience, but I wouldn't come back. \\n\\nOn a side note: I would figured that the manager would be better dressed when he's out greeting and socializing with the clients. When we went, he was in jeans and an old looking short sleeve button up - not very presentable. I have been to many restaurants where the manager would come out and asked the clients about their experience, but they would be presentably dressed and act in a matter that would make the restaurant stand out amongst the others. This manager took our appetizer away while his waitress was trying to give us our entrees without asking us if we were done.

On my way in, I saw this huge poster advertising these so-called Cap'n Crunch \\"Delights\\" and I thought they looked great, and I figured I'd love them, because I *LOVE* Cap'n Crunch, so I thought I'd try them.  More on that in a minute.\\n\\nI ordered an L10 combo (one piece of chicken, one piece of fish, with fries and a drink).  Crystal (who was clueless), entered it as an L9 (two pieces of fish).   I asked if I could get cole slaw instead of the hush puppies, and at first she said this was not possible (even though I've done it dozens of times before). Then, as she was finalizing the order, she said \\"Oh, wait, I can do it for 20 cents extra.\\" Fine, whatever.  My meal still included the two hush puppies (whatever), but at least I got my cole slaw (but the container wasn't even half-way full).  When I realized I got two pieces of fish instead of one chicken and one fish, I brought it to their attention, and was given two pieces of chicken (even though they really should've given me only one).  \\n\\nBut that wasn't even the biggest problem ... the floor was so wet and sticky and gross, the worst movie theater in town would have been jealous.   My food was really greasy, and the condiment station had no ketchup and no tartar sauce (NOT okay!).  Not to mention all the trash and garbage laying around everywhere, and the employees goofing off and using not-so-wholesome language. The place was a mess.   \\n\\nAnd just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, I went to eat the Cap'n Crunch \\"delights\\" I ordered. To say the least, they were grossly misrepresented in the poster in the window (see photo). The \\"delights\\" I received looked absolutely nothing like they did in the picture.  And they were just barely edible.  What a shame.\\n\\nI tried to fill out the customer survey, but they limit comments to 1200 characters, so I never had the chance to thoroughly explain my experience.

There are several things in particular that I noticed in my last experience that made the crossed the threshold into mediocre territory. \\n\\nFirst, while initially they had an endless amount of the thick sesame sauce paste, they now have substituted that for peanut sauce, which is different in flavor, and they also seem to have diluted the peanut sauce with water. It lacks flavor and texture, which is necessary for a solid sauce base. Moreover, as an addition to the sesame sauce, it would be natural to add spicy chili in oil, however, there are now no chilis in the chili in oil -- and so it is just a red oil, which again, detracts from the texture and spiciness. It seems they have tried to make up for this by throwing Sriracha onto the sauce bar, but by comparison, it is less than satisfactory.  \\n\\nSecond, unlimited food cannot make up for poor quality. The meat seems like their strong point (and I think they carve it right there in the shop), which is good, but other foods, such as imitation crab, and some of the vegetables like the lettuce and napa cabbage seemed unfresh.\\n\\nThird, the service was virtually non-existent unless you got up and demanded it. Granted, it was Saturday night, and it was busy, but still, I think they are used to having a full-house on the weekends, and it should be reasonable to plan accordingly and make sure you have enough waiters to keep up with all of the paying customers you're bringing in. \\n\\nI will likely go back to China Hot Pot sometime because it is a convenient spot, but until we start seeing some quality adjustments, I think a two star rating is appropriate."},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"The food is absolutely wonderful!

This place is absolutely packed 99% of the time and beyond their location, patio and Caesars in a boot I'm having a really, REALLY difficult time understanding why. \\n\\nPerhaps in this city a whimsical drink and a patio are enough, and if that's the case for you, you should probably drop everything and rush to Local now before the beefed up game watchers and tanned kitt's beachers bombard said patio. If you value things like quality food, menu variety and any sort of interesting healthy eating options I'd most definitely head elsewhere. I was at Local for my second time last night, with a group of 15 for a friend's bday party. My girlfriend and I literally stared at the menu for way too long before admitting to each other that we really didn't want any of what was there, for two people that eat absolutely everything, finding nothing appealing was a feat in itself. We settled on the Tuna Poke - which the server assured us was \\"amazing\\" to start and a burger with yam fries to share. The Tuna Poke was by no stretch of the imagination amazing.... it was a tiny ramekin of chopped up tuna and a mound of greasy chips to dip it in. Ummmm.... really? In my experience with tuna poke's the tuna is actually the focal point of the plate, this was clearly not the case here. The positive was we acted as a cautionary tail for our friends who'd yet to order. The burger we had was alright, or about a 3 star A-OK I suppose. Definitely didn't compare to the one I had at Slickity Jim's last week!\\n\\nThe drinks were for sure the high point for me, as expected the Caesar in the boot was and is the only reason I'd go back, but let's be honest I'm not driving to Kitts for a drink.

You start thinking about all the crafty dishes, spices, and the upscale reservations you could make just to have truffle oil drizzled on a slice of tomato and mozzarella.......and then it hits you that Dad hates all that crap and just wants soup and meatloaf.  The man actually puts salt on Chinese food.....I also love the heck out of him!  So where do you go that doesn't turn it into \\"deconstructed meatloaf\\" with a dollop of ketchup and oatmeal on your plate?\\n\\nThe moment we sat down I knew we had made the best choice in years.  Seated by the owner, everything here is family oriented, casual, and very caring.  The building used to house a neighborhood pharmacy/cafe of sorts by Grandpa Sckavone, and as you can see from the fantastic old black and white photos around the dining area.......it was the local kids favorite place!  It makes you feel good.....but here's the real secret about Sckavone's.......they've got some of the best comfort food in Portland and I say that without reservation. Scratch made Americana classics that can please any palate.  \\n\\nBeing vegetarian I had some good options here to my surprise.  I had the house favorite, the mac n' cheese, which was probably the best I've ever had. Super creamy, and you can taste the parmesan and pepper in every bite.  It's rich, with 4 kinds of cheeses, baked to perfection with large tubed pasta which let all that goodness fill 'em up......and I believe that's what makes this dish so great.  Mom had the classic fish n' chips which she was very happy with. Lightly fried large chunks of halibut with some pretty great seasoned fries.  If a restaurant is using halibut, you know they care about making it.  My father turned 78 here......and had one of the best meals he's had in recent years......and it happened with expertly made old fashioned meatloaf with ground beef and pork, perfectly seasoned, and even with a little dash of marinara and shaved parmesan on top.  He even saved a piece on purpose just so he could have it for lunch the following day......if you knew my father......that says it all right there. \\n\\nThey really have some thing special here.  An atmosphere that's quiet, welcoming, and a great deal of fun.  I looked around at the other tables and saw many other families like mine all laughing and having such a great time.  Sckavone's made my Dad's Birthday special ,so that's 5 stars all around.......and being the first review of the year for me, puts Sckavone's right at the top of my list."},{"name":"SPITZ","address":"2103 N Killingsworth St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"YES!

I loved the colorful airbrushed walls with unicorn decals, pink umbrellas sitting next to the door, chic furniture and a beautiful bar. They have an outdoor patio with a roll up door that opens up the restaurant on a nice day. The staff was friendly and we were stoked to see that it was happy hour. We ordered two Street Car Doners (one beef/lamb and one falafel) which are apparently one of their most popular items and their happy hour Street Car Fries. The fries were DELICIOUS. I am so glad we didn't skip out on them. They were crispy and smothered in peppercinis, feta, cucumber, tomato and garlic aioli. The flavors were spot on and a perfect snack to share or devour on your own. The wraps were also very tasty and seasoned very well.

Namely, they cook damn good food.  Caf√® Margaux has been in the historic Belair Courtyard for 28 years.  They have expanded, opened a sister steakhouse in the same center and even bought the entire building.  They must be doing something right and I am fairly certain it is the food and not the \\"team service\\" experience.  There is nothing I can say that has not already been said about the owner of this fine establishment, Alex Litras and his Executive Chef for more than 20 years, Chef Erol Tugrul.  As such I shall not bore you any more than usual and get right to the food reviews.\\n\\nI think our server was Michael, but with so many walking around with blinders on, it was hard to pinpoint one.  Jennifer started out as the team leader and she was very peppy, happy and exuded enthusiasm.  I got lost in the team service concept and if we here at BBDO included things such as ambiance and service in our ratings, this place would drop a star for sure solely because of the discombobulated service set-up. Alas, we do not and so I stand by the 5-star review.  \\n\\nDeciding to take full advantage of their bar we began with one Prince Reviver and a Glenlivet 18-year-old, neat.  As for our meal, we asked for Coquilles St. Jacques, Escargot and Confit Duck Rillettes Focaccia to start things off and continued with an order of Walnut and Fig stuffed Quail and some Penne Pheasant Breast to complete the experience.  Twenty-three minutes later and our drinks are still MIA.  Maybe the order got lost in the team shuffle going on in the back, who knows?  I had to corral a specific server to complete the 23-minute wait for the 20 servers not bringing our drinks.  When they did finally arrive, I must say the Prince Reviver was unique and delicious and the Scotch had an extremely generous pour (making up for time lost?).  \\n\\nThankfully, it wasn't another 23 minutes until our food arrived as Michael was soon seen approaching our table with a tray laden with delectables.  The scallops in the Coquilles St. Jacques were tender and sweet, the mushrooms fresh cut and the white wine cream sauce reduced to a perfect consistency while holding its complex flavorings.  It was superb, to say the least.  The Escargot was cooked properly and I found them to be quite exquisite in their texture and taste.  While I was still enjoying the memory of the recently devoured Escargot, I tried the last appetizer on the bill, the order of Confit Duck Rillettes Focaccia.  This was also sublime.  They were smooth and flavorful while the sauce was light and creamy.  \\n\\nMoving on to our accompanying salads before digging into the olfactory treasure chest that was our entre√®s was a smart move on my part.  The Cranberry vinaigrette was bursting with flavor and the salad was clearly homemade.  Sadly, the bread service was lacking and nothing to write home about at all.  Bread service is the first contact the kitchen has with the guest and it should really set the bar for the following meal.  In this case, the bread was the last one standing in a game of kitchen limbo and the rest of the food was setting a pole vaulting state record.  Speaking of the rest of the food the order of Walnut and Fig Stuffed Quail had to be some of the most delicious fowl I have ever chewed upon.  It was fresh, tender, juicy and the combination of the English walnuts and figs was crunchy and superbly executed.  This brings me to the final item to be reviewed, the order of Penne Pheasant Breast.  The pasta was obviously homemade and cooked to a perfect al dant√®.  The Pheasant breast, not unlike the previous Quail was tender, juicy and exploded with flavor on the palate.  It might have been the freshly ground chorizo, or perhaps the Manchego Garlic Madeira cream sauce that made this dish so extraordinary, but whatever it was it was done to culinary perfection.  \\n\\nThere is a reason Caf√® Margaux is considered one of the top restaurants in the state of Florida year after year.  The winning partnership of Mr. Litras and Chef Erol have not only churned out consistently divine delicacies, but they have constantly raised their own bar and more importantly, have surpassed it each and every time.  \\n\\nThe Big Boy says, \\"If you can stand the \\"team\\" approach to service and possibly getting lost in the 20 people or so working your table, a meal at Caf√® Margaux will more than make up for it!\\" #bigboydiningout #iamthebigboy"},{"name":"The Bangkok Thai and Pho","address":"57 West Wyoming Ave","city":"Melrose","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this place.

When the girlfriend and I got there for a late breakfast one day, we found a line extending well down the street. Fortunately these were mostly large parties and after about five minutes, the owner came out to personally show us to a two-person table. I ordered the avocado and tomato eggs benedict and freshly squeezed orange juice (it actually is freshly squeezed that day, which is a really nice touch that is pretty hard to find), while my girlfriend ordered the banana and nutella stuffed French toast. When our food came was when the meal fell apart. The eggs in my benedict were definitely overcooked, not runny at all. The tomato didn't taste very fresh and the subtle flavor of the avocado was completely lost under a blanket of merely adequate hollandaise. The girlfriend's French toast was no better. It was one note: sugar. You could taste the banana a little, but the hazelnut and chocolate flavors of the nutella were completely absent as the palate was coated with sweetness and the brain went into shock. I'll probably give this place another shot (or, more likely, try Soundbites) because the menu is just too appealing to give up on.

Daily. \\n\\nThumbs up to their PR team who got the word out (what foodie didn't hear about this place?), but double thumbs up for offering an amazing selection of beer and fab food that had people coming back for more by Night Two. This place got packed on Tuesday! \\n\\nWe were fortunate enough to arrive early (6:15ish?) and got seated inside right away. It's family style seating but not \\"it will take two hours to get seated\\" Barley Swine, rather \\"come on in and pig out\\" ala Rudy's BBQ. It would be a perfect place to bring a big group, but as popular as this place already is, not sure if that would fly. (They were so slammed last night they were out of several items.)  If you look at the website you'll get a good idea of the vibe here, and no detail was overlooked.  \\n\\nMy date didn't seem impressed with our waiter but I thought he was knowledgeable enough for the second night they were open. He was able to help me pick a stout (Anderson Valley Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout - creamy goodness!) and aided me in my sausage selection. There are so many options here it can be overwhelming, but I think our waiter is right, \\"you can't go wrong.\\" I ordered the chicken/apple sausage with sauerkraut and sweet (which is also spicy) mustard and garlic aioli. I honestly feel the sausages here hold up just fine without all the fancy extras, but hey, more is more.  (I actually asked for the sauces on the side cuz I thought they'd be too much, but that detail slipped through; no matter, it was excellent even with everything piled on!). My boyfriend ordered one of the vegetarian options with all sorts of goodies and loved it. We also got fried pickles were great. I enjoy how most items here are housemade, and made by peeps who know what they doing. \\n\\nAnd now...for the best part (sausage and beer? hard to top!). The Snickers Bar in Jar. I just made that name up, and Ben, it's ok if you steal it. They take a squat mason jar and as I imagine it,  line it with hot fudge, then freeze it. Then, they fill it with vanilla ice cream then layer on peanuts and caramel, then top with more fudge to seal it all in. Good god, it's amazing. \\n\\nSpeaking of god, we think we might have seen Jesus - wearing skinny jeans - hanging out by the mini dog park (yup, they have a fenced in area out back). We joked that if Jesus was going to be hanging out anywhere in Austin, it would absolutely be Banger's, home of the 101 tap wall and ecstasy-inducing Snicker Bar in a Jar (man that's got a nice ring to it, jus' sayin').\\n\\nAnd now for the parts of our evening that were not so heavenly (which for now I will chalk up to just opening). While extremely attentive at first, as the place got busier, service got worse. I suppose this is to be expected, but it still was unfortunate. I felt like we were at ESSR and needed to place two drink orders at once, lest wait forever for beer two. (My second beer was an Irish Stout, but not the Brooklyn, and it was slightly bitter at the finish. Not enjoyable on its own, but perfect with dessert.)  Also, as more people piled in it got so loud it made conversation nearly impossible, as rowdy as an elementary school cafeteria, and it was bad enough that I needed to move outside because it was making me anxious. We asked the hostess if we could move and she seemed grateful as she had people waiting. She told us to let our waiter know and we would transfer outside. This is probably our bad, but we couldn't find our waiter so we told the guy bringing our drinks, but ti was a conversation the hostess overheard thus led us outside to sit down. \\n\\nService was worse outside and the dessert we'd just ordered never showed up. Luckily a manager stopped by to say hi, and within a minute, our jar of heaven showed up. But our waitress was practically non-existent. Ah well. (Busing staff was on their game BTW, inside and out.) I'm  assuming service will work itself out here; it's a ton of tables/people to manage and while they seemed to have a LOT of staff, they just might not have running as smoothly as possible yet. Reserving a star because by the time we left we were in pretty sour moods.  \\n\\nIn conclusion, this is still a MUST, and will be one of the stops I now recommend to folks visting Austin, or for anyone looking to try a new area of town, or is into sausage and/or beer (basically I'll be recommending it to lots of people, ha).  BUT, I will likely recommend they wait a month...and maybe don't go on a weekend, or go at lunch...or simply make sure they exercise some patience."},{"name":"The Lansdowne Pub","address":"9 Lansdowne St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The Lansdowne Pub is an awesome addition to Lansdowne Street.

I had to call back just to make sure I wasn't double charged. I am very sad about this because their horchata is amazingly yummy. I always order the Cheese Enchilada and Chile Relleno. I always ended up spitting out lots of seeds from the Chile Relleno which kind of ruined the enjoyment. Come to find out, Chile Relleno shouldn't have all those seeds in it!

I work near the area, and we usually make our bi-annual trip to eat here when we can't think of anywhere else to eat in the area.\\n\\nThe food is not bad, but it's not great either. My favorite things here are probably their five spice chicken wings and the roti. Many of the other dishes I've tried have just been okay, as I've had more authentic versions around town or in my travels that were tastier, and not to mention cheaper. If pricing was more reasonable, I would probably come back here more frequently, even with this quality of food. With a party of 2, I never fail to spend $30+ on lunch (food only and no drinks) in order to get full. Since most of this \\"street fare\\" is relatively cheap to make, I can't justify spending that much on mediocre food. \\n\\nService is usually good, but the last time I went during lunch hour I was pretty disappointed.

When we got there, Underbones was a ghost town. But by the time we left two hours later, it was jam-packed; so crowded, in fact, that our boss was unable to pay, even half an hour after he'd been handed the bill and he'd finally walked over to the bar with the intent of putting his credit card directly into the bartender's hand. The remainder of our party went outside and waited, and, seriously, we finally gave up. I don't know what time our boss finally left, but he did come upstairs at one point to tell us not to wait up for him. So clearly over-crowding can become a problem.\\n\\nMoving on: great drinks. The beer selection is excellent, first of all, and they offer samplers, which is always good if you know you want, say, a Belgian ale, but don't want to commit to a full pint glass of just one kind.

Whoever came up with this dish violated what should be a cardinal rule of cooking: Do not stir fry beefsteak tomatoes, they'll end up being a grainy, bland mess.

We always get lamb and beef with plenty of different green, but we've recently started getting squid and mussels too.  Make sure to get some enoki mushrooms and tofu as well.  The noodles are quite delicious too.  To drink, it is imperative that you get a Heineken, especially if you get spicy broth.  It pairs so well with the heat.  \\n\\nFinally, my sauce station recommendation.  I've become the sauce master.  Here is the secret: jalape√±os, cilantro, green onions, peanuts, chili sauce, chili oil, garlic with oil, sesame oil, and soy sauce.  The only addition I would make, but they don't offer it, is to add Chinese numbing sauce.  That is the stuff.  \\n\\n\\nCheck this place out and enjoy!"},{"name":"DEE DEE","address":"4204 Manchaca Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Before I go super into depth, I just wanted to point out all the Yelp misspellings there are of DeeDee's dishes :D enough of each to make me triple check the real names!!

Yay for everyone getting Som Tum right!! \\n\\nNow on for the real stuff: As someone with a southern Vietnamese heritage, I am amazed by the cultural overlap. The use of dill in a soupy-rice dish (com canh), squash, ground pork, basil, fish sauce, all of these ingredients in the Pad Ka Pow and Om Gai just bring me back to my mother's homemade cooking. Nothing like some good ol' momma food. For those of you without Asian mom (or dad) cooks at home, stop on by! \\n\\nPrice-wise I'd say it's maybe $1 or $2 more than I'd like, especially given the ingredients, but I'm still happy and full. That being said, total compliments on the crispiness of the basil on the Pad Ka Pow. Definitely a fun little texture!\\n\\nSpicy level, I personally don't think was anywhere unmanageable or sweat-inducing :D I'll ramp up the chilis next time! \\n\\nI think for a food truck they are on a great start with the makings of a fantastic gig.

The interior is inviting, with its colorful floor tiles and glowing votives set out on tables for the evening shift. The counter staff were friendly and hospitable, and its empowering to see a crew of female chefs working in the kitchen. However the tacos themselves have some issues. As others have commented, they can be very liquidy, depending on the filling, and with only one thin 4\\" corn tortilla to hold each one together, the eating experience can quickly become a sop it up with a spoon or a chip experience. I found this to be the case with both the tinga de pollo (a kind of stewed chicken) and the enfrijolada (basically refried beans with cheese). There are large self-serve crocks with pickled onions and veggies to supplement your order, and without liberal amounts of these, my meal would've largely had the texture of a series of purees. \\n\\nHappy hour is a good time to get a reasonably-priced order of chips and guacamole ($5). The guac was fresh and tasty, but the chips were unpalatably salted to the max.

That's the theme at this location.\\n\\nI try to wordsmith my reviews. In this case it really isn't worth it. This place has been B-A-D the last 2 times I've gone here. It is an embarrassment to the Jason's Deli franchise. I will just give you the laundry list from just this most recent (and final) visit:\\n\\n1. My party of four showed up 20 minutes before lunch to beat the crowd, and did. There were only seven tables filled when we walked in. We placed our order. It was 35 minutes before we RECEIVED it at the table. (Two of us got food in 25 minutes, the other two got food 35 minutes after walking into a near-empty DELI/CAFETERIA STYLE restaurant).\\n\\n2. The 'signature' cashew sandwich was horribly prepared. The meat was overcooked (and grisly). The toast was slightly burnt. The contents were just 'thrown' on the bread so that about 30% of the surface area between the two slices was empty air. A great concept... executed horribly. \\n\\n3. The order came with an extra bowl of soup we didn't order. I don't count that as a \\"plus\\" because nobody wanted it. Someone else in the restaurant was probably missing it. This, in turn, leads to delays for everyone.\\n\\n4. I went up front to ask for a to-go box because, for some reason, they don't leave them out where one can get them. The customer in front of me was asking the manager to put out plates at the salad bar because there were none left.\\n\\n5. I went to get some ice cream at the end of this fiasco. Of course -- there were no cones left in the dispenser. So once again, I have to walk over to the front to ask for some.\\n\\nI'm pretty forgiving but after similar crappy food and service twice, I'm done with this location."},{"name":"Joy Cafe","address":"1100 Peachtree St NE, Ste 110","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Met a friend from church here for a weekday late lunch.

So, the bill, which included two items I never ordered (and which the server promised to remove but didn't) came to $49.39.  Which is already exorbitant when you realize what I actually consumed (two sausages, three sides, two beers).  They added $9.30 in \\"included gratuity.\\"  I don't know where they came up with 18.8% as a good number, but whatever.  Automatic included gratuity is, as I'm sure we can all agree on principle, ridiculous.  I won't go further into that tangent.  If the service was fine, I'll usually pay it without incident. \\n\\nBut that day's service was not fine.  That service was atrocious.  It was slow and lazy and inattentive, and it actually degraded my dinner experience with a bunch of friends.  Which is a real achievement of the worst kind.  In other situations, if a business is responsible for ruining an experience for which I'm paying (e.g., a venue that seats me with an obstructed view of a performance), one might even suggest that the business would pay me for the inconvenience.  Not so at Banger's!\\n\\nSo anyway.  We all know the mandatory gratuity is anything but mandatory.  Considering the extra charges for items I had not ordered nor received, plus the hapless server and his unsatisfactory service, I felt that $9.30 for my portion, even though we occupied the table for 3 hours (certainly not by any choice of our own), was exceedingly undeserved.  I'm not a low tipper by nature, but felt this decision was appropriate.  So I crossed out the additional gratuity and wrote in a flat $5 because I'm not an asshole.  I laughed at the suggestion to add even more \\"additional tip\\" and signed the receipt.  The total, as those mathematicians among you will confirm, was $54.39. \\n\\nWell, we fast forward today, when I'm taking my usual time to review my bank accounts and categorize things in Mint.  And I see a charge from Banger's.  The total seems...high.  But I knew it would be high, because that place is a goddamn hive of inadequacy at every level!  That's why I had taken a photo of my receipt that night. \\n\\n$58.69.  That's what they charged me.  They ignored what I wrote on the receipt entirely and charged me whatever the hell they felt like I should pay.  18.83% mandatory gratuity, despite the adjusted total I clearly provided when I signed the document.\\n\\nNow, on top of everything, I have to call my credit card company to tell them that servers at Banger's don't know how to listen, serve, split an order, adjust incorrect checks, or...read basic numerals on paper."},{"name":"City Barbeque","address":"3758 W Powell Rd","city":"Powell","stars":"4","text":"Stopped at 8:20 tonight (Sunday)...they close at 9pm but you wouldn't know it as they were more interested in their closing routine than cleaning the eating area.

We had a quick, satisfying lunch here.\\n\\nThis is a casual taqueria and bar that opened in 2012 in Smyrna Market Village. Parking is limited in front of the restaurant, but there are plenty of spaces elsewhere on the property. The restaurant is spacious and ideal for groups large and small. There's a jukebox, music, TVs, and an enclosed patio. The atmosphere is laid back and lively.\\n\\nI'm not sure if there are separate lunch and dinner menus. I don't think there are. When we visited, there were eight starters priced at $5.99 (queso) to $10.99 (smothered nachos) each, five entree-sized salads starting at $5.99 each, 10 different kinds of tacos at $3.99 (pulled pork) to $4.99 each (calimari, grilled shrimp), $7.99 burritos and burrito bowls, entrees like alambre (steak and shrimp skewers) and steak and chicken fajitas for $11.99 to $14.99 each, and quesadillas ($7.99-11.99 each). There's also a kids menu with under-$5 items.\\n\\nI had the blacked mahi ($11.99) which consisted of a 6-ounce blackened fillet of mahi topped with The Corner Taqueria's homemade mango salsa and served with a side of red rice and green beans. For a relatively healthy dish, I thought it was tasty and enjoyable. The fish seemed fresh enough and cooked appropriately (decent texture and flavor) and I liked the yummy mango salsa. The rice and green beans were basic, but nicely seasoned with just enough salt on the green beans.\\n\\nAdmittedly, while I didn't think my dish was spectacular -- it leaned more towards 3 stars (\\"A-OK\\") than 4 -- I'm bumping The Corner Taqueria up for their service. Plus, you can rarely go wrong with complimentary chips and salsa.

I've had the pleasure of enjoying the belly stuffing beef variation in the past, most often at Pho Hoa in Chinatown, and found it best shared among the appetite of 3 women.\\n\\nOn this visit, however, I had fish on the mind.  And not just fish, but seven full courses of it.\\n\\nHere is Anh Hong's description of the meal:\\n\\nCa 7 Mon - Seven Courses of Fish $37.95, for 2 people\\n1. Goi Ca (Anh Hong Special Fish Salad)\\n2. Ca Nhung Dam (Fish Fondue with special vinegar sauce)\\n3. Cha Dum (Steamed \\"Pate\\" Fish)\\n4. Mo Chai (Grille Fish Sausage)\\n5. La Lot (Fish Wrapped in Hawaiian Lot Leaf)\\n6. Nuong Bo (Grilled Fish with Butter)\\n7. Chao Fish (Special Fish Rice Soup)\\n\\nOne nice twist offered by Anh Hong is the ability to order based on the size of one's party.  Given my past experience with the beef variety, and my friend's comment of having shared an order of the beef here at Anh Hong between 3 adults, we opted for 3 people's portion for 5, while our sixth member ordered a bowl of noodle soup for dinner.\\n\\nIf you haven't had Seven Courses of anything before, note that it is a very hands-on meal.  There's not only the cooking involved in (officially) two of the courses, but the option of soaking rounds of rice paper in hot water to wrap your own rolls.  Yes, a delicious yet time consuming process, despite the quick avalanche arrival of course upon course to the table.  The 6th member of our party even got busy helping us with the cooking after his soup was history, and commented that it was much too much work.  He's probably right, but it was a delicious experience!\\n\\nWe had heard that less favored courses could be replaced by others more enjoyed, but on this visit we ordered Ca 7 Mon as is, and I'm glad we did!  Even my less beloved courses in the beef variation - that is, the plate of sausages - were tasty here in the fish iteration.  Yes, none of us were crazy about the semi cooked fish salad, but the chilled carrots and daikon were a welcome burst of veggies, and the chilled fish filets easily tossed into the pan to cook up for further consumption.  Favorite courses, however, turned out to be the comforting and homey fish congee and the fish grilled in butter (cause, well... butter!).\\n\\nThe avocado shake was a bit icy here.

I ordered the grilled ribeye and my wife ordered the risotto. If McDonald's decided to offer a steak, this is what the ribeye would taste like. It was over salted and overcooked. My wife had the same comment on the risotto. The taste of the risotto was masked by too much garlic and butter. \\n\\nAdditionally, we both ordered a glass of Zoot's most expensive Cabernet. Much to our disappointment, the Cabernet was served cold. I can only guess that the bottle was opened the night--possible two nights before--and placed in the refrigerator. If I wanted old, refrigerated wine, I would have stayed home. \\n\\nHaving moved here from Los Angeles, I am inclined to give the local cuisine a fair shot. Generally, I will rate a restaurant as favorable if the staff is attentive and engaging. The staff at Zoot is neither. Our waiter, Brian, neglected us for the entire evening. He only offered to get me a second glass of wine after my wine glass sat empty for 20 minute and after my entree was eaten. Further, we had to ask someone else to get our check. After I gave them my AmEx card, Brian then offered to show us the desert menu. As you can imagine, I was largely disappointed in the staff. \\n\\nI would highly recommend avoiding Zoot at all possible costs.

It would be perfect if salt was sprinkled over the fish as it comes out of the hot oil. Call ahead to order the fish (takes a bit to cook) and ask for salt. It's pricey, around $45 (market price at the time), but considering if you had this fish at a non-Asian restaurant, it would be at least double the price - so good value.\\n\\nThe butter beef comes out raw and thinly sliced on a plate.

The medium is plenty of food for one person, about 8 inches. Most medium sandwiches range from $6.00-$6.50 which really isn't that bad, given the price of Subway sandwiches and, god forbid, Jimmy Johnson's (unpopular opinion, I know). The large would be huge in my opinion, and could probably be split or shared- those run at at least $9 which is a little pricey to me for a sammich. \\n\\n\\nThe fillings make the sandwich even more..filling (hardeeharhar). Toasty bread with pillowy insides, fresh amounts of meat piled on, crisp veggies, simple but flavorful sauces (don't even get me started on the hot sauces). \\n\\nI got a turkey and jack cheese sandwich on white bread, with a generous amount of veggies.

I like this place.\\n\\nThis is a contemporary New American/Southern restaurant and bar that opened in March 2014 in a freestanding building on the eastern side of Edgewood. It replaced the Arizona Pub (https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-arizona-pub-atlanta). It's located across from the Arizona Lofts and the Arizona Ave Soccer Fields. Free parking is available in a small lot behind the restaurant (about 15 spaces) and on the street. You shouldn't have a problem finding a spot.\\n\\nThe restaurant is inside a cool-looking, modern industrial building. There are at least two floors. For Sunday brunch service, only the first floor was open. The first floor isn't very big. I guesstimate they can seat about 12 people at the bar and another 20 or so at tables (including a few high-tops). The storefront has garage-style doors that retract up when the weather is nice. There are more tables out on the patio. The patio and part of the building are enclosed by bushes and trees.\\n\\nWe showed up just before 11am and slid into some of the last remaining parking spots in the back lot. We joined a small crowd that had built up outside the door just before the restaurant opened at 11. Apparently, brunch here is popular. We were lucky to show up when we did and were seated immediately at the bar. The place was at or near capacity in a matter of minutes. The atmosphere was laid back and casual. The space looks nice and it was clean during our visit. There's a TV mounted on the wall at one end of the bar. It was playing sports.\\n\\nRation & Dram serves dinner six nights a week, Wednesday through Monday, and brunch on Saturday and Sunday. The business is closed on Tuesday. Both the dinner and brunch menus are streamlined with less than 20 dishes on each menu. When we visited, prices at brunch ranged from $4 for a bowl of grits to $13 for the \\"Gringa\\" (more on that below). At dinner, small plates ranged in price from $4-12 each, entrees $9-20, and desserts $6-7. The kitchen uses high-quality, locally/regionally-sourced ingredients. The bar has an extensive cocktail, beer, and wine menu.\\n\\nHere's what we ordered:\\n\\nFood:\\n-- \\"Smalls\\"\\n* Beignets ($1.50 each, minimum of three must be ordered) - fluffy beignets with powdered sugar\\n* McDowell ($5) - English muffin sandwich with breakfast sausage, egg, and cheddar\\n* Hick Fil-A ($5) - buttermilk biscuit, fried chicken breast, pimento cheese, bread and butter pickles\\n-- \\"Biggies\\"\\n* Tofu Scramble ($10) - mushroom, tomato, bell pepper, onion, turmeric, and potato hash (grits also an option)\\n* Gringa ($13) - crispy maitake mushroom, two poached eggs, creamy grits, and Gruyere\\n\\nDrinks:\\n* Nitro coffee (small size, $3)\\n* Orange juice ($3)\\n\\nIn general, the food and drink were great. We enjoyed everything and I can't say there was a single bad thing. Dish presentation was beautiful. Portion sizes were reasonable.\\n\\nThe beignets were delectable. They were fresh and served hot out the fryer. I loved the sweet powdered sugar and how warm, soft, and melt-in-your-mouth good the pastries were. These were some of the best beignets I've had in the city to date.\\n\\nThe McDowell and the Hick Fil-A sandwiches are obvious plays on McDonald's Sausage McMuffin with Egg and Chick-fil-A's Chicken Biscuit, respectively. The McDowell even comes wrapped like a McDonald's Sausage McMuffin with a golden-arched \\"M\\" stuck on the outside. Funny. The McDowell was quite good with the savory sausage patty being the highlight along with the melty cheddar cheese. I didn't try the Hick Fil-A, but my friend who ate it liked it. It looked yummy.\\n\\nThe tofu scramble was delicious. The food was bright and colorful and tasted as appetizing as it looked. Everything tasted fresh with the eggs and tofu being nicely seasoned and particularly flavorful. This was a satisfying dish.\\n\\nThe Gringa was unique and excellent. The maitake mushroom, also known as hen-of-the-woods, was served as one whole piece. It had to be eaten with a fork and knife. I've never seen it served like that before and I liked it. The grits were warm and had a wonderful, almost silky smooth, consistency. They were mild in flavor. The mushroom, however, made up for it as it was salty. The eggs may have been the best part. They were terrific quality and perfectly poached. The soft yolks were ideal for mixing in with the grits and mushroom.\\n\\nThe Nitro cold brew coffee and the OJ were tasty with simple, neat, and clean presentation.\\n\\nService was great. The staff was polite and efficient. During a busy brunch rush, they appeared to be on top of things."},{"name":"Wan Lai Chinese Restaurant","address":"4897 Buford Hwy, Ste 104","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Speedy service with excellent ingredients.

I got the coconut macaroon which is a popular item here. I was told that it's made by soaking challah bread in egg whites, covering with coconut, and cooking it. The result is a fluffy inside and a crispy covering. It came with whipped cream and raspberry drizzle. I didn't have to add syrup, it was that satisfying. Great combo. My friends are regulars here and get the Pancake delight which is topped with all sorts of fresh fruit (berries, mango, kiwi, bananas, melon...). You can also ask them to put chocolate chips in the batter. Coffee is self serve and there are 4-5 different options. Portions are huge! One pancake is filling.

Although the whole \\"bowl\\" concept seems way overdone and unoriginal these days, so I was skeptical at first, but I'm hooked now. The bowls are full of flavor yet healthy enough to eat regularly. I like all the options for greens and grains because it means I can always try something new. There are plenty of protein options but I just stick to the chicken or veggies and both are great. The toppings all taste very fresh and acidic which gives it that fresh and light Mediterranean flavor. The sauces and dips are tangy and savory but really flavorful which brings the bowl together but still keeps it healthy and not too heavy. The sauces are balanced just right to not be overly acidic or tangy which happens sometimes in Mediterranean food. The spicy options are also not too spicy which is nice. \\n\\nThe only complaint I have is that the seating in the restaurant is really skewed towards groups of two.

But I just couldn't give it 5 stars based on all of the hype around the restaurant. Unfortunately for Staplehouse, the hype leads to more criticism and less room for error. With that out of the way, let's get into the review:\\n\\nDrinks: They have a nice selection of cocktails. I tried the Ivey League which was delicious. It's like a cross between a Manhattan and an Old Fashioned. Very easy drinking. They used a lavender honey which added a nice twist. \\n\\nWe opted to not get a bottle of wine that night, but rather did wine by the glass. The options were a little limited and included some interesting wines that you don't normally find elsewhere like Russian or Slovenian wines. \\n\\nFood: The food is amazing. If I were leaving a rating just based on the food alone, I would give it a five stars. We started with the mushrooms dish which included farro, chestnut, and tarragon. There was a variety of mushrooms in the dish and they were packed with flavor. Next we had the  chicken liver tart with strawberry, radish, and mioga ginger. It was odd and unexpected but enjoyable. The strawberry wasn't overpowering but added a slight sweetness to the dish. \\n\\nAfterwards, we had grandma lillian's potato bread. O.M.G. You must order this. I probably could have made a meal off of just the bread and been happy. \\n\\nLastly, we had the trout and tilefish as more of our entrees. Both fish were cooked perfectly. \\n\\nService: I have mixed feelings about the service. As soon as we got there, the restaurant immediately acknowledged the allergies in my party and noted that the kitchen was aware. Our waitress also helped guide us through the menu to avoid any allergy issues. The majority of the staff we encountered were great, but our waitress was a bit awkward and there were a few moments where we were sitting without drinks and ready to order more. This, along with the annoyance of trying to get a reservation (it took us a couple of tries over a few months to finally get a reservation even though we were online right at 12pm when reservations were released each time) in the first place is why I couldn't give it 5 stars."},{"name":"By Design Pizza","address":"11800 NW Cedar Falls Dr, Ste 110","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Ever since I saw that there was going to be a pizza place by Market of Choice, I have been waiting... especially since it is a place where you make your own (like Pieology, Mod Pizza, or Blaze Pizza)!

They decorated nicely with tables made out of doors and topped with glass. They have industrial looking light fixtures that look like the sun. There is a nice Oregon themed mural by the soda machine. When you walk in, you go to the left to order your pizza. Since my husband and I like different toppings, we ordered two separate pizzas. The girl that made them was efficient and listened to what we wanted on our pizzas. As soon as they were topped, they went right into the oven. We were rung up by another employee, and we were given a number. Our pizzas would be brought out to us when they were finished. Because they have tables made from doors, there aren't many tables, and they all fit six. So, we had to get the end of a table while someone else had the other half. They were leaving soon anyway. Our pizzas were brought out to us in no time. I really enjoyed the crust of the pizza. I love thin crust, and this one was really crispy. The toppings were great, because I picked them!

Tons of space and there's beer and food and sometimes live music. But that's about it in terms of positives. The management doesn't seem to have it together with too much space and too understaffed. \\n\\nI came on a Sunday and it was packed. Wait was about 2 hours for brunch menu and bar was at least 10 minutes. Came to enjoy some nice weather and some music at 3pm. Was told we could sit anywhere on balcony and have smokehouse food but no brunch. At 4pm smaller menu came out so we were willing to wait and enjoy some drinks in the meantime. $20 manmosa filled the hole but the requirement of food kinda was a downer so we ended up with an average pretzel to nom on while we waited. Live music was fun and had a swing feel and made the wait bearable. Finally we got seated and had a second manmosa to share and a smoked sausage and veggie sausage and salad to eat. Smoked sausage was just a hotdog with tiny bit of smoke to eat and much longer. Over cooked for sure and coming with only raw onions sliced on a bread bun. The veggie dog at least had some substance with a BLT-esque build with mushrooms acting as bacon. But the sausage itself was unremarkable and not worth an order. After a 2hr wait we enjoyed our drinks but food was certainly lackluster. On top of that service was slow even at the table once seated. \\n\\nBig complaint was the dogs in the way always with owners not caring who or what they sniffed. I am a dog owner and the way that some of these people act with their dogs at this location seems very irresponsible with drinking and dining taking on more importance than actually looking after and seeing where your long leash dog is going. But I guess that's Rainey where dogs roam free. So if you have anything less than all out love for dogs, then I would avoid Rainey and especially bangers on AUS day afternoons. \\n\\nParking impossible but the way the venue is set up and the amount of beer for average prices makes me accept this place for what it is and would come back for drinks only.

I came here because it was highly recommended. I am an Indian and this is one of my favorite cuisines. Unfortunately the food is sub par: the dahi vadas were hard, and it was evident they were not fresh as they didn't really mix with the yogurt. The sambar was a watered down, flavorless mess. How it is possible to make sambar flavorless is beyond me - it is supposed to ooze with delicious flavors of lentils and vegetables that have been simmered in perfectly balanced combination of tartness from tamarind and countless spices! The paneer dosa was bland and should be called \\"mostly potato with some paneer\\" dosa. Tonight I felt sad at the kind of food that was  labeled as \\"Indian\\" - this meal was an affront to what my cuisine stands for! \\n\\nWhat else could go wrong? Well - never have I felt so disrespected as I did tonight. We were seated in a side section because the main room was occupied. One big table was available in the main section but the hostess probably wanted to save that for a larger party. That was perfectly okay with us but then they completely forgot that we even existed. After a VERY long wait, a server comes up to ask for our order. When we pointed out that we were really thirsty and would love some water first, she says: \\"our policy is to serve water AFTER taking the order\\". Thats a whopper of a lie she served us: culturally water is served first across all of India. Anyway, we placed our order. Then we waited for the water to show up now that the \\"policy\\" was in action....but guess what, she didn't bring us any water even AFTER the order was placed. We had to flag down someone else after another long wait. On top of all this, the staff and the hostess showed no courtesy for the fact that we were paying customers trying to have a good night out - they used that dining section to chat about their colleagues, take phone calls, and complain about scheduling issues. They did not use the main section for that, so it was clear to us that we were placed in a section that is treated as a work/congregating space.

Beyond that as much of everything you needed for a chicken taco feast was provided : fresh corn tortillas, many fresh salsas, cilantro, cabbage slaw, onions, radishes, avocado, etc..  Their chicken was delish, crispy slightly charred skin, tender meat... amazing.\\n\\nPollo Norte brings a little of that experience to PDX, but adds a full bar, some great sides, and additional menu options.\\n\\nWe had a 1/2 chicken with pinto beans and rice as sides, and chose a Smokey/Spicy margarita, and a Spicy margarita to compkete the meal.

Well not this time!\\n\\nThis place is now on my list of favorite places to eat. I like the location, there is ample parking, staff is always welcoming and attentive, the atmosphere is lively and the food is delicious.  There is seating outside, tables indoors and a full bar.  They have several televisions throughout the restaurant and during happy hour they play trivia games which was kinda cool.  it's not a quiet place, so if background music bothers you during your meal this may not be the place for you.\\n\\nWe ate entirely too much chips and salsa before our meal and the tortilla chips were warm, light and crispy.  They could use a bit of salt, but hey, maybe they care about our blood pressure, so if you want more salt just shake some on, right?  Not a deal breaker.  Chips come with two salsas, a green and a red.  Love the red salsa - it's got just enough heat to keep you snacking and asking for more. My friends enjoyed the green too, although I didn't try it (I was distracted by the red one).\\n\\nFavorite dishes:  The chicken bowl with everything and Chipotle Caesar dressing is #1.  The bowls are offered with chicken, steak or shrimp and you can pretty much have it your way.  We also enjoyed the shrimp tacos which were full of big, juicy grilled shrimp and again you can select a sauce from the list.  Super yummy!!!\\n\\nMargaritas on the rocks were pretty good, but seemed to be lacking a bit of alcohol - it just wasn't as potent as we like.  \\n\\nIf you haven't been here yet you really should go.  I plan to go back many more times and try all the tacos!!

We  waited about 20 minutes for a party of 2.

She walked by us several times without stopping by to say, \\"Hi guys I'll be right over\\" or something like that. It also took her awhile to bring the bill. In fact I think my only issue with Deschutes was the service. \\n\\nThe food was delicious. It's definitely not your typical brewpub food with wings and cheese sticks and spinach dip. The food was definitely stepped up. We saw the fried chicken dish that someone ordered and it made me wish I hadn't stopped at a street food stand before we got there. It looked soooo good. We ordered the pretzel, which is our typical order at breweries, and weren't disappointed at all. It came in a dish accompanied with mustard (not like French's mustard) and cheese sauce (not Cheez Whiz). The pretzel was perfectly salted and not too hard. You can tell they make it when you order it because it came out blazin hot. \\n\\nOn to the beer. We created a flight with 3 for him and 3 for me. I loved everything that was in our flight. Even the stuff the bf picked. The summer beer was right up my alley. It was nice and refreshing for a summer day without being completely tasteless.

I didn't like the bacon because it was the fatty part and greasy. The bacon tasted like ham. I like my eggs scrambled, but they only serve fried eggs. The French Toast came with strawberries on top and it was good. They charge $6.00 for a \\"large\\" orange juice with no refills (of course).

The sweet and sour pork was the star for me, as it was lightly battered (in I want to say rice flour) and crisp with onion slices, various bell peppers, and flower shaped carrots. The pieces were larger and more of multiple bite pieces which was enjoyed, all this without an oily aftertaste. The chicken in garlic sauce did not have enough garlic and was fried in a way that made it be soggy for me. \\n\\nMy seafood jjambong was underwhelming because there was a lack of seafood. I had two large pieces of crab (exited to dig in) but found no crab meat inside. Majority of the seafood was pieces of squid, two pieces of shrimp, and a couple pieces of mussels. \\nEnded the meal with an apple flavored yogurt drink!

Everyone is entitled to his or her opinions, and these are mine:\\n\\n1. Valet only parking. Seriously? There's not an option to even do 'street' parking because it's in a neighborhood of mansions. \\n\\n2. Which means the average clientele is of a certain ethnicity/race to which I'll leave you to guess for yourself, older, suit jackets, pearl earrings, coiffed and curled as* hair and overall formal attire. \\n\\n3. Which means it screams exclusivity, old money. But I digress.\\n\\n4. The view is okay. We were like, what is this dirty body of water in front of us? Oh, the Chattahoochee river. Ah. We thought it was a lake because it was so brown and still.\\n\\n5. The food, which is the important part. It's not bad. It's not good. It's not better than what I can make for you at home with some good ingredients from the grocery store. Basically a 'new american' bent that is heavily priced. For example, the Alaskan halibut is served with a ¬¥laksa'. May I question, did the person who came up with the menu know what a laksa is? Also, they serve kangaroo. I've had my share of weird meats in my travels but I tried not to eat non indigenous animals. Where is this kangaroo from? How will we ever know? The salmon potato crisps are bland. The potato is cold and fried, which means it's bad, because if you are a chef of any sorts you should know potato + fried = cold = bad. Basics. The salt and pepper calamari is basically calamari (or chicken butt? How will I know?) not in a sauce that remotely at all resembles salt and pepper but more so carrots and onions, and if you cook at all, you should know carrots + onions = sweet, not salt and pepper. The breads are cold and neither chewy nor crusty nor holey nor airy nor good. I could go on. I will stop here for sake of sanity. \\n\\n6. The one up side? The bar is available for the full menu in case you can't get a reservation to what's probably a waste of your money. There are better splurge dinners elsewhere in the city, just as equally familiar in its 'new american' venture as this one tried to be. \\n\\nWell, at least now we can tell those people who can't stop talking about this place, please stop.

Often with full beards, they don teeshirts with the likes of the bunny from Donnie Darko. They like Pabst. \\n\\nOn the side, I don't understand the venom this subculture generates; I find them no different than any other groups of people; they too span the spectrum from caustic jerkoff to warm charismatic. Be that as it may, it also attracts students to top off it clientele. \\n\\nShrunken Head is in the bohemian building on the corner of 5th and Neil, where Midnight Cafe once was. The interior is of the type that use to be a mainstay in the Short North as well as north campus. Original exposed brick walls, original stucco square ceilings, dry red paint gives it a nice worn old, underworld comfort. Above hightop chairs at the bar hangs small, cylinder, mosaic chandeliers glowing red and orange. The space is smaller than what it looks from the street, but is roomy enough for a decent low level venue audience. \\n\\nThe bar is nothing great. Few beer were on tap: a couple domestics, a IPA, Guinness. This is not competition for the great mirco brewed selection and IPA hysteria popping up all around. The wine and liquor selection is standard bar choices. They serve enough to keep you positively hydrated during music.\\n\\nAs a music venue it is good. The acoustics are perfect, with the stage no more than 45-degrees from anywhere on the floor or bar, the sound stays thick in the plastered walls. (Though there is a window section that is hidden by the doorwell.) the PA system was decent, you heard every instrument and vocals without distortion. The bands that played Saturday night were talented and had distinct sounds and well crafter original songs. I paid a three dollar cover.\\n\\nService could use an upgrade. They do great between sets, but they lose a lot of business during play. Serving during music is best done by staggering bartenders to sections; if there's two, have one cover each half. That way when a customer needs a drink, all he has to do is turn around and make eye contact. Unfortunately, they were all huddled at the opposite end, meaning I went dry for a few songs.\\n\\nNot a fatal compliant, but a suggestion.

The burrito was really tasty, filled with scrambled eggs, cheeses avocado slices and chorizo, really really nice combination of flavors and tasted very fresh. The burrito also came with home fries (potatoes), which were crispy on the outside and delicious. I also asked for a side of hot sauce based on other reviews (my breakfast is almost always covered in hot sauce), it was amazing. The chef came out a bit later and I mentioned the hot sauce, he said he makes it himself, a habanero blend. The food alone is worth a 5 star review, the unique hot sauce adds that much more. The chicken and egg sandwich is fried chicken, which is not heavily fried so it's not as heavy as typical southern fried chicken. Also topped with 2 eggs sunny side up and thick cut bacon on a brioche bun. Amazing breakfast sandwich. Our waiter was friendly and the food was fast.

He took our drink orders, saw I was expecting, and asked if I wanted a mocktail (of course I did). He brought me the most delicious raspberry lime mocktail and husband loved his Old Fashioned. \\n\\nI had the fried Gerber chicken and husband had the chicken fried steak. Both were cooked to perfection and well-paired with their sides. We didn't order appetizers in order to save room for dessert and we were so glad we did. Husband had the apple crisp and I had the lemon and gingerbread tart.

This ramen bowl is decent I mean it is above satisfactory and is very filling.\\n\\nOne thing that they should do is separate the fried chicken away from the ramen so that the chicken does not get soggy - which was a minus.\\n\\nI didn't order anything else as I think is more than enough. \\n\\nService wise they are very attentive and ensures that you had enough water, tea, and that your order is ok."},{"name":"Fresa's - South 1st","address":"1703 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Aside from them getting my order messed up quite a few times, I freakin love Fresa's.

I saw a very attractive table for 2, which seemed to be an obvious choice, but instead.. we were seated in this corner that seemed to be out of the way. I didn't mind too much - maybe the other table was for other \\"non dine outers\\"\\n\\nThe waitress throughout the night was courteous, but i didn't feel she was personable at all. Checked out food only because she had to do it and didn't pay much attention.\\n\\nI ordered the \\"beer injected oyster\\" as an additional started as it is one of \\n\\nVANCOUVER's 101 BEST EATS!... a few things to note:\\n1. Falsely advertised... the beer is NOT injected. It is infact a deep fried oyster (that is mostly fried dough) sitting on top of a shot glass of lager that you drink with.\\n2. I tried it, and for $4.00, I found it to be nothing special\\n3. The oyster itself was okay.\\n4. I did confirm with the waitress prior to ordering, so I was not why it was made onto the list if I just drink some beer with an oyster.\\n\\n... back to Dine Out.\\nI ordered the chickpea salad for a starter which seemed to have nice flavours, but seemed to have an overload of chickpeas... there were some crunchy bits which gave it some nice texture, but really nothing fabulous. My bf's croquette was very good, I must admit with a chowder underneath that was creamy and hearty.\\n\\n... here is a big NONO for me.... I was not done my appetizer, and the main course gets brought out. I understand that dine out has a time limit of 1.5 hours, but if was't like I was eating my appetizer for 45 minutes. I have never in my life had this happen to me, and I was quite shocked. They didn not even consider taking it back and I uncomfortably told them I was done with my appetizer as they swapped my plate for the next course.\\n\\nThe Main Course - \\n1. Chicken Adobo with Rice Pilaf\\n2. Keta Salmon with lentils and onion tart\\n\\nBf's Chicken was very tender, not overly spiced, and was very good. I didn't think it fit the overall theme of Nu, but I do think that it was cooked well. My salmon, although it looked burnt, and an odd orange, was cooked nicely as well, it was a little soft, which is exaclty how I wanted it. The lentils, however, was really unncesary as it looked like a pile of brown mush that was extremely unappetizing. The onion tart that was underneath it looked soggy and seemed like it had been sitting there for at least an hour waiting to be eaten. The only reason it was semi - warm was because the heat of the lentils raised its temperature.\\n\\nFor dessert, I got the cheesecake, which was good, but it tasted exactly the same as cheesecake I've had elsewhere. The chocolate mousse ordered by my bf was nice... again, nothing out of the ordinary. \\n\\nWe ordered a few cocktails that were pretty refreshing, and I would think the rest of their drinks menu would be quite impressive as well.\\n\\nCloser to the end of the meal, the host was making me very uncomfortable as he kept starring in my direction to see what was available, who was finishing their meals etc etc....\\n\\nI never want to feel pressured to leave and I don't think I exceeded the limit anyway so why should I feel uncomfortable while I'm paying money to have a decent meal? On the other hand... I cannot get past the fact that for a restaurant like this one, I would be handed my main course before finishing my appy. That is just extremely inappropriate restaurant etiquette.\\n\\nI was so excited to try their other two restaurants - C and Raincity grill.... I even heard Nu has an awesome brunch... but won't be anytime soon....maybe if someone tells me it's their fav. restaurant."},{"name":"Capa Steakhouse & Bar","address":"10100 Dream Tree Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"First, no offence to the Asian dude but Capa needs to have a better \\"profile\\" picture.

I guess their sets aren't very long as they just had some background music for the rest of the night. \\n\\nIf you're with a big party, start off with a charcuterie board with the Chef's selection of cheeses. Definitely a delicious way to get those palettes going. 5/5.\\n\\nGambas - Love me some shrimp so when I saw this coming to our table, I got excited.  Shrimps were perfectly cooked and it was served with this delicious egg yolk type puree. The celery root chips were a nice touch as well.  Definitely a must try if you love shrimp. 5/5.\\n\\nCerdo - Holy shit this was amazing.  It's been 2 weeks since I had this and I'm still dreaming about it.  The pork belly was served with some apple sauce so really, picture Homer eating some pork chops and apple sauce.  Mmmmm... Was honestly one of the best things I've ever had. Ahh pork, how I love thee. 5/5.\\n\\nPrime Filet - I love my steaks medium rare and although I would've loved to have seen just a little bit more blood, the steak was still perfectly grilled and rested. The platter had the perfect amount of creamy mash and also some mushroom gravy.  The size of the filet was quite generous so make sure you're hungry and don't load up too much on apps.  Also, have the steak with a nice glass of red wine.  Perfection. 5/5.\\n\\nChurros De Madrid - If you know me well, you know how much I love churros.  Was honestly a little disappointed with theirs but I was still happy.  Though it did have just enough crunch and moistness, the temperature could have been a teeny bit more warmer.  Nothing like fresh churros and theirs seemed as though it was sitting out a little too long before being served.  4/5.\\n\\nArbequina Olive Oil Cake with Crema De Coco - This cake was interesting.

If you're a sushi or kaiseki snob, order an omakase set, which was something like a kaiseki dinner, or sit at the bar and do omakase. Unless you're Chef Nobu and feeling jealous, you won't be disappointed. \\n\\nAt first this place made us really, really nervous. Looking around, there were no Japanese people eating here. There was disco music playing. It was dark, it was loud, and the Gucci/Versace set was getting sloshed on expensive cocktails. I asked the waitress a question about the menu, she was very friendly and helpful and explained that the spicy tuna box is one of the most popular items....uh-oh. I asked another question about the omakase sets, she had to go to the back to get the answer, and couldn't pronounce omakse...double uh-oh. This place was screaming disco sushi. Maybe at 10pm they push the tables aside and it turns into a dance club. Run.\\n\\nSo we had a choice to make, order the spicy tuna box recommended by the waitress....or try the omakase and hope for the best. It wasn't a cheap decision, $120 for a one person set, but we ordered it and added a few extras from the menu so we'd both have enough, then waited, nervously. \\n\\nOne of the extra plates we ordered, an avacado salad, came first and it was really good, but tiny, half of an avocado to be exact. Another was a 9 piece nigiri assortment. It was ok, on par with other good sushi restaurants in the city. So I think if we had just ordered a few plates off the regular menu, we would have thought the place was ok, on par with other good Japanese places in the city.\\n\\nThe omakase set plates were, however, unbelievable, excellent, outstanding, mind blowingingly good, \\"I want to go back tomorrow\\" good. The sushi, sashimi, hot plates, all 6 courses, it was the best we've ever had in Atlanta, on par with the best we've had in NYC, Kyoto and Tokyo.

I'm not a celiac patient, nor am I a vegan, but I thought the rest of you might want to know.\\n\\nI got a groupon for this place a month or two ago, and I decided to finally use it.  My friend, Arran, works for the state, just up the street, so I asked her to meet me at Apothecary after work on Friday.  I was greeted with water, and three different menus, which was almost like going to a doctor's office and being greeted with all that pesky paperwork.  One was the rotating glass wine menu; another was the bottled wine menu; and the third was the food menu.\\n\\nArran couldn't have gotten there soon enough; I was raring to order.  I don't remember what wine she got, but she also ordered a Smoked Turkey and Brie Panini.  I got a glass of the Paraiso Chardonnay, and the Brie, Pear and Honey Panini (it came with truffle oil and arugula).  \\n\\nThe wine was good.  I'm no oenie, so I can't tell you if I got my groupon's worth from that glass.  I can tell you that I apparently have the uncanny natural ability to expertly pair wine and food.  The sammich was simply fabulous.  The sweetness of the pears nicely balanced the brie and truffle oil.  I could have taken or left the arugula, though.  Arran thoroughly enjoyed her sammich, as well as the chips.  Those chips were some heavily peppered mothers that amazingly didn't throw me into a coughing fit.  I've said this in previous reviews, and I'll say it again:  A little bit of pepper goes a long way.  Arran disagreed with me; she thought the chips had the perfect amount of pepper on them.  Sheesh!  \\n\\nEmployee Brittany (wonderfully friendly gal) came over and offered to let us taste some other wines.  Boy howdy!  We tasted as many as she would let us.  I don't remember the names of any of them, but the final one we tried we each liked best.  It had starfruit, with a grapefruit punch.  Or was the grapefruit a completely different wine?  Did I mention we tasted several different wines, and that there was no spit bucket?\\n\\nArran and I worked a crossword puzzle, at which we excelled.  We simultaneously played the wine-tasting game.  We each wrote down what ingredients we thought were in each wine, and we each adopted the personalities and mannerisms of Frasier and Niles Crane, just to make it more fun.  Unlike Frasier and Niles, Arran and I totally stunk at this game.  I think she got one ingredient of one wine correct, while I got none.  But it was something fun to do while we waited for rush-hour traffic to end.\\n\\nI don't get to the Rosedale area very often, but next time I'm there I will definitely stop in at the Apothecary for a dose of grape-flavored \\"medicine\\"."},{"name":"North Market","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"North Market is definitely an awesome place to stop when visiting Columbus.

When I hear touristy, to me it means someplace that attracts a lot of out-of-towners, but really the locals avoid it because it's not that good. Maybe it was once upon a time, but not anymore. I also see touristy as a place that uses lots of gimmicks to separate your money from your wallet, leading you to believe you're getting an authentic experience when you're not. But when locals and tourists alike both crowd into a place that lives up to the hype, well, that's not touristy at all... that's just awesome!\\n\\nQuincy Market is one of those places.\\n\\nOf all the places I've eaten during this long road trip with my family and of all the foods I've tried, there is no doubt this place will remain in my mind for years and years to come. Honestly I was having a ho-hum time in Boston walking around looking at all the old historic places until we came across Quincy Market.\\n\\nIt is to me is what a caffeine shot is to others. Alive and vibrant in a way that set all my senses on overload. Sight, sound and smell combined to supercharge my energy level. There were street performers, lots of gorgeous people to watch, fun things to buy, smells of deliciousness coming from every direction and amazing displays of food that would make nearly anyone drool all over themself uncontrollably. \\n\\nI swear this place makes me want to use expletives to describe just how I feel about it. I just gosh darn love!!! Whoaaa, one almost slipped out right there.\\n\\nTHE FOOD\\nThe best part for me was the food didn't just look and smell good, it tasted amazing as well!!! Everything we tried left a lingering taste in our mouths that made us want more. \\n\\n-- I selected chicken curry w/lentils from Gourmet India and it was freakin' awesome. So tender and flavorfull I couldn't stop eating it even though I was stuffed. (5 stars).\\n-- My wife ordered an incredibly flavorful veggie fried rice from Bangkok Express. It was some of the best fried rice we've ever eaten. (5 stars)\\n-- My sons enjoyed hot dogs from a street vendor (5+) and also an Italian sausage with onions and peppers from La Pastaria (4 stars). \\n-- Last but not least, we all shared a strawberry smoothie-thingy from The Monkey Bar that made me wish I was laid out on a beach somewhere getting fanned with a giant palm leaf. Kinds pricey, but so good! (5 big stars)\\n\\n\\nFINAL THOUGHTS\\nSo again I say, if THIS is what it means to be caught in a tourist trap, then put one of those dog collars on me that zaps me if I ever try to leave! Just make sure it allows me enough range to hang out @ Christopher Columbus Park overlooking nearby Boston Harbor. There I can lay out on the grass and listen to some of the extremely talented street musicians that fill the air with amazing sounds. One guy was so good it prompted me to throw some green in his guitar case. Seriously, between this place, the incredible old world feel and the wonderfully kind people we met during our brief time in Boston, I could see myself moving to this city.

Atlanta definitely needs to step up their AYCE hotpot game.\\n\\nThe best thing about China Hot Pot is that it's all you can eat for a decent price ($19.99). For me, the downsides were that you don't get your own individual pot (it's a communal pot), the ingredient options for their AYCE menu is somewhat limited, and the sauce bar options are sort of essentials-only. There also seems to be only 2 viable broth options.. which is fine by me because those are probably the only two options I always gravitate towards anyway. \\n\\nFood -- as I mentioned, the ingredients included in the AYCE menu are on the sparse side. There aren't a lot of beef options (just one), and no pork except dumplings (or spam if you count that as pork). On noodles, there are 3 options - instant ramen, \\"thick noodle\\" (which are clear and stretchy glass noodles), and \\"hand made noodles\\" (which are flour based noodles). The hand made noodles are the best, I really do not recommend the \\"thick noodle\\" on their menu. But with the handmade noodles, remember to try to shake off as much of the excess flour as you can or your broth will thicken. I also highly recommend trying their soup dumplings (aka \\"soup buns\\" on the menu), but it takes 20 minutes for the kitchen to cook it and each order only comes with 4 pcs, so plan in advance. \\n\\nOh! And before I forget, the sauce bar does not have sa cha sauce (or \\"Chinese bbq sauce\\"), it's actually at each of your tables in a small container.\\n\\nService and ambience -- we don't speak Chinese, and the service was still awesome. When we arrived around 6:15pm on a Friday, it was perfect because it was quiet.

I could tell no one was going because they hired ppl to stand outside with signs. They were also on Scoutmob. I thought this place wouldn't last 2 weeks.\\n\\nWell, it lasted for a while. About a year ago, another group of owners came in and took over. They changed it for the better.

There didn't have fishy-smelling disgusting seafood anymore. Everything seemed fresh and delicious. \\n\\nI tried their Tagliatelle al Cartaccio. Just like the name implied, this was cooked in parchment paper. It came out looking lovely. It was like unwrapping a huge candy from its wrapper.  I loved the flavor of the marinara sauce. It had a nice tangy, savory tomato flavor. The seafood tasted fresh and the homemade pasta had a nice bite to it. This was a great dish.\\n\\nI also had their Fettuccine alla Pescatora.  It's another seafood pasta dish. With this dish, you can have it with red or white sauce. I had it with white sauce because they recommended it. I liked it. I loved the garlicky, buttery flavor of the white sauce. The pasta was also homemade, and it was good. The seafood tasted nice and fresh. I loved it. The only problem was the sand.  I was crunching through them with every bite. \\n\\nFor dessert I tried the Antipasto Romano. It's actually an appetizer. But that's how I roll. It's just a huge plate of cheese, cured meats, and veggies. I loved the cured meats. I couldn't tell you what they were, but they had 3-4 kinds of cured meats. I also loved the artichoke hearts, olives, sundried tomatoes, and the pickled peppers in the dish. They all tasted fresh and good.\\n\\nThe staff is welcoming and friendly. I met both of the owners.

Sure enough, this rumor rang true. Definitely make a reservation if you're dining on a weekend cause it was a full house when I went! I absolutely loved the decor, ambiance, and lounge music. This type of dining is definitely my style. \\n\\nSIDE NOTE: shishito peppers aren't written on the menu but they DO offer it as a starter, just ask your server. \\n\\nOur server Paul was perfect; very on top of cleaning our table when needed and recommended the most juicy fruity nigori sake I ever had! One bottle was not enough. If you like sweet sake, you MUST get the strawberry nigori. \\n\\nTheir crispy rice spicy tuna was a fitting starter with just a tiny thin slice of jalape√±o on top of each piece to kick your palette into gear. The wagyu nigiri is served with two pieces and decadently melts in your mouth. Their white fish tempura, spider, and hurricane roll were all splendid. I especially loved the spider for its lightly battered soft shelf crab. I shoulda ordered this whole roll just for myself lol \\n\\nIf you're a coffee person, then you gotta have a cup of theirs with dessert. It's scaled and timely filtered/brewed to a fine science. I also recommend coming early for dinner and not at 10pm like I did, otherwise you may miss out on their top two desserts cause they sold out! Still, I couldn't complain with what they still had available in house such as their molten lava cake with a creamy scoop of matcha ice cream. Ooey gooey dark melted chocolatey goodness.

Cornbread here is great, really appreciated the small pie-like execution since it guarantees that every bite has some of the crunchy crust.  The honey butter puts the cornbread over the top.  Surprisingly though, the fried okra was the star of the meal for us.  The curry adds a great mix of flavor and spice, even if not in keeping with the restaurant's brand identity.  However, the fried chicken was disappointing.  No issue with the cooking - juicy meat with a thick crispy breading - but the \\"hot\\" designation was signaling memories for us of Nashville's Prince's and Hattie B's, which were ultimately not relived.  Maybe that's on us for assuming \\"Nashville hot\\" chicken, but the pickles on top were too much of a nod to overlook.

Then, you wait in line to pay while they make the bowl behind the counter. The line moves pretty fast, but every now and then they can get pretty backed up due to online/Food delivery orders.

I knew I wanted a good breakfast, and I wanted to try somewhere new, but I didn't want a long wait! Thanks, Yelp! \\n\\nUpon pulling up, I noticed that it appeared much smaller than what I was actually expecting, and it looked extremely crowded with a bunch of people outside and a full parking lot! My husband went in first to see how long the wait would be and he was told about ten minutes. He put his name on the list, which is an actual paper list by the door, and he came back to the car to get me and our son. We waited in the car about two minutes before simply deciding to just wait closer, since we didn't want to risk losing our spot and more people just kept coming! To my surprise, we were seated almost immediately! They had two big boards with menu specials and we immediately figured out why they call it shakers. I hadn't actually read the reviews before going here, just went by overall rating! It was rather small inside (50 ppl max read the sign by the door), but everyone was moving quickly to make sure people were able to get in and out. The down side was that it did make me feel a little rushed, not like the kind of place you can really take your time, because it is small and plenty of other people are waiting, but I'd say that was the only real negative. \\n\\nFor my breakfast, I chose French toast with sausage and a side of home fries! It hit the spot for me! I was also so intrigued by the Cap N Crunch crusted French toast, but I decided to save that for when I'm not pregnant and can probably easily tolerate that sugar overload! My husband ordered the cinnamon roll pancakes special, which came with bacon and eggs! I tried a bite of those cinnamon roll pancakes and they were so delicious! Just like the name implies, with a cream cheese icing! Our son decided on a basic Belgian waffle, but he was happy with it! To top it off, prices were great!

They initially ran out of scallion bread but we were happily informed they baked more. However, when we had it, I didn't really taste scallion in the bread. Our server informed us that they offered smoked beef bacon or tofu bacon, rather than the traditional pork bacon. We tried the beef bacon with soft poached free run eggs, classic hollandaise, mixed greens with house vinaigrette. The eggs were not as runny as I had hoped but the least appealing part of the dish was perhaps the potatoes as it was very dry and we did not finish them.\\n\\nMy main dish was A Toast to Ramen with house cured and smoked beef bacon, marinated soft-boiled free run egg, blistered tomatoes and butter toast broth. I enjoyed the beef bacon more in the ramen, probably because the broth kept it hotter than the benedict did. I liked the ramen but picked out the blistered tomatoes.

I plan to check out some other nights such as ladies night and when they have a live band. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I paid $20 for valet to park my car in the front. Upon leaving  it was actually parked down the street. I did receive my $10 refund back, as valet is $10 to have your car parked elsewhere. to me it's the principle of the matter, not about the refunded amount.

A girlfriend and I specifically chose to go on a Wednesday, which is ladies night because you know a sister is always looking for a special.  Initially, we were told there was no seating even though there were some open seats hmmmmm, all reserved huh?  After walking around a bit a nice gentleman asked if we would like to sit in these two chairs.  Perfect! Back in business.  We waited and eventually the server came over and gave us a menu and took our drink order.  After 20 minutes, no exaggeration, she came back and said they only had one bartender so please be patient.  Ma'am, did you say one bartender on a pretty busy night????  Yes, she did.  Well, we got our seats so I was like oh well....no big deal.  She came back about 5 minutes later with our drinks and a glass of champagne (free for ladies on Weds).  It would have been awesome to provide the champagne right away but hey, nobody is complaining now.  We both ordered shrimp which was amazing, like really good for an appetizer. Did I say the shrimp were good?  Oh YES!!!! The live band came on around 9 and all was well.  My only negatives were that we were only offered cocktail napkins.  Yeah, we did not get full entrees but I would expect a real napkin from a place which is so well appointed. Second,  while the decor is a 10, the huge stair case dividing the 2 sides downstairs is too distracting.  I wish the room was more open so we could see the band.  The real VIP section though is upstairs and you have to pay to play on that field so we never saw it.  Bummer.....Overall, I will give Fellaship a touchdown with missed extra point."},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Everytime I come here, everything is outstanding.

When they pulled the brisket out it looked like it just came cooked right off the cow. It was absolutely tender, moist, and the spices were very complimentary, but not overpowering. Several sauces were available for the meat including a mustard one. All worked very well.

She told us that we could get an entire rotisserie chicken, and to a bunch of hungry teens, of course that sounded fantastic, so we all agreed.\\n\\nUpon arriving, the environment was super super cute. There was outdoor and indoor seating, and they both flowed really freely together. This is one of those restaurants where you go up to the desk and order and they give you a number and deliver it almost like old fashioned fast food. We ordered an entire chicken with two sides, rice and potatoes. \\n\\nWe got our food in about 10-15 minutes, was a nice wait. They had good music playing outside (it was a little loud), and really pretty string lights. Our chicken was cut up into about 6-8 pieces, which was kind of odd. I would've preferred it to just be completely together, but I guess that made it easy in the long haul. The chicken was pretty good, very moist. It didn't have much flavor other than the skin, which was fairly spicy. Their potatoes were very very spicy, and their rice was lacking in flavor. But overall I was satisfied with the meal. The prices were a litttttle high, but not overwhelmingly; you get what you pay for. The environment deserves probably 4 stars but the food is what gives it 3.

That being said, aside from convenience there isn't much else that's all that great about it. The service is cold, especially from the woman who works there who doesn't seem to care at all about customers, even repeat ones. She barely smiles and almost never thanks anyone. Her husband behind the stove is much nicer but doesn't interact with customers...\\n\\nAs far as the food good, it's actually not bad - pretty good but nothing stellar. The selection is essentially breakfast goods, a few sandwiches and wraps, two soups, and a few salads. There aren't any hot lunches there but there's a few daily specials which mostly revolve around sandwiches and wraps. \\n\\nThe owners being Greek, there's also a few Mediterranean-inspired dishes like their avgolemono (lemon-rice soup) and a gyro but that's about it. No spanakopita, no lamb or anything else. The avgolemono was okay but average however their salads and wraps are good; however their wraps somehow feel more like burritos because they are giant and aren't cut in half like everywhere else. \\n\\nThen comes a few negatives: first off, they are cash only. With services like Square, LevelUp and others making accepting card payments both more easily and affordable, this simply isn't acceptable in 2012. I mean c'mon guys... Seriously. And parking can be painful (doesn't really matter much in my case though, I walk there from my office). And their prices are all over the place. I once had a small soup, a salad and a Nantucket juice and the whole thing was $14 which I found hard to swallow considering that their salads are mostly iceberg and not even field greens. Their drinks are really expensive as a matter of fact.\\n\\nBut it's not all negative, their bakes good are great, their omelettes pretty tasty and overall the food is good. If only their pricing made more sense and the service was friendly, I'd go more often, but the few places nearby are more appealing to me. Places that are friendlier, accept card payments and have real specials."},{"name":"Goldbergs Fine Foods","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"Surprisingly good bagel, not in NY.

Our recent experience with this Chipotle began when we ordered delivery from them. My boyfriend and I each ordered a burrito and my little girl got the childs crispy taco meal. First of all the burritos weren't labeled so we had no idea who had what. I would have let that slide if it had not been for the trainwreck of a meal my daughter received. They failed to give her the tomatoes she ordered as one of her topping choices, they did not give her her drink, the steak was beyond well done and they also left out the piece of fresh fruit. We called and spoke with the manager who offered us a replacement meal, not for delivery but still better than nothing. I noticed that the food hadn't been that great but I figured maybe it was a bad night. A few days later my boyfriend picked up the replacement meal after work and was there to actually watch them make it. The guy mislabeled out burritos even after my boyfriend pointed out that he had mixed them up, then they almost gave my daughters meal to a different customer. The final nail in the coffin came after I tasted my food. Although there were several different ingredients in it, it only had one flavor. Salt. Prior to tasting this I had forgotten that salt could be a singular flavor. It was foul. I didn't even bother complaining this time because I don't want to eat there again, even for free.

Decided to brave whatever happened and give it a shot, and I was glad I did.  Of course, since I made my mind up to come, there was no wait at the time.  We got a table on the patio and I ordered a Pineapple Express, one of the Sake cocktails on the menu.  It was nice and refreshing.  We started with the Korean Wings, which were so delicious!  What a great flavor and texture!  Next We had the 5 Spice Green Beans, which came with a light batter that barely covered the bean.  But they were battered and fried perfectly al dente, and then tossed with the 5 Spice mixture.  I was amazed how perfectly the batter adhered to the beans without breaking apart.  After we had those two items, we tried the Duck Bao.  That had a delicious sauce, the meat super tender without being fatty.  Finally I ordered the Chick-a-Rome's.  Fried Chicken skin tossed with jerk seasoning.  This one one made me sweat a little with the heat, so I ordered a Lucky Buddha lager to cool down.  We had Kimberly T as our server and she did a nice job.

Since this is nestled smack dab in the middle of Midtown, a lot of professionals from the nearby offices as well as Georgia Tech hit Joy Cafe for lunch. Parking was scarce around 11:45, and it took us about 15 minutes to find street parking since we didn't want to deal with the overpriced lots/ garages. I'm not sure if they validate parking, and we were not willing to take the chance of losing $20/ hr.\\n\\nOnce we finally parked, we walked in, and it was slammed in the dining area, patio, and the to-go line. Nevertheless, there was a man working the door and floor who never seemed to pause while he simultaneously picked up the slack of the short-staffed servers. I honestly felt bad for the waitress working inside because she was in control of the whole interior dining area - about 12 tables of various sizes. It showed too because we had to flag her down and waited for our drinks. We had little interaction with her and more with the man by the door and those who seemed to be foodrunning/ bussing. However, it's understandable considering the circumstances.\\n\\nAs for our meal, the sweet tea was decent. The menu is primarily comprised of soup, salad, and sandwiches. My mom and I chose to share a combo (mushroom grilled cheese and tomato soup) and a side of pasta salad. It was the right amount of food. I wouldn't get the pasta salad again; it was kinda dry and the flavors didn't mesh well. However, the soup was robust, and the grilled cheese was hearty - albeit a little bit greasy.\\n\\nIf you're in a rush, do NOT come here for lunch.

While our day was nearly perfect, our experience with Urban Cowboy left much to be desired. Unfortunately, I believe that since a brick and mortar store was in the process of opening right before our wedding, it distracted Chris and his team, resulting in our wedding not getting the attention we had hoped and quite a few issues.\\n\\nFirst, the good: the food itself was quite tasty! The mac and cheese was heavenly. Additionally, they were always willing to accommodate our requests, and did, for the most part.\\n\\nNow for the bad: TL;DR It was a huge disappointment and we certainly don't feel as though we got our money's worth. I would recommend finding another caterer--many of our issues seemed to stem from a lack of attention or dedication to the catering aspect of their business.\\n\\nCommunication: They would only respond to our e-mails on Sundays, and even then, only in part. It often required sending multiple e-mails in order to get our questions answered--and even then, it was clear that communication failed on their end as evidenced by my next point.\\n\\nBartender issues: In our emails, we discussed how well equipped the bartender would be to serve our event. We were specifically told that the \\"bartender will bring all supplies for opening wine/beer and a cutting board. They can bring a cocktail shaker as well\\". The bartender did not bring any tools whatsoever. Luckily, we had brought wine keys and scoops for ice, but no knife or cutting board. After the truck supplied the bartender with the knife and cutting board (for citrus), these items were not used. It took my father getting behind the bar and cutting limes for people to get their drinks prepared. Furthermore, the bartender was not well trained and struggled to poor even the simplest of drinks (way overpouring, then over correcting and way underpouring). At one point she told my uncle that she couldn't make him a bacardi and coke because she didn't have any rum...there were 5 handles right next to her...\\n \\nFood issues: \\n1.     One of the entrees was supposed to be cherry-ancho glazed short ribs. This is something we were very excited about. The ribs we received were not short ribs. We understand that small substitutions may occasionally be necessary, but the main cut of meat was substituted, which had impacts on both the flavor and price. \\n\\n2.     The other entr√©e was supposed to be the sriracha chicken, with the sauce on the side. We did not receive the sriracha sauce, but a different sauce altogether. Once again, this substitution completely changed the meal.\\n\\n \\nService issues: Prior to the wedding, we communicated the timeline to ensure that we were on the same page. Although the wedding ceremony ran about 15 minutes late, the dinner service was much more delayed. Dinner was not ready until after 6:00.  Throughout dinner, our mothers had to find the staff to refill the trays of food. We had guests standing in line with 2 of our 5 dishes completely empty with no one on site to refill them.\\n\\nWe paid extra for your cake cutting service. The staff was not prepared to provide this service, and once again had to be found in order to fulfill it. In addition, many guests had to cut pieces for themselves, because the three tiered cake was cut from the top-down, with no separation of layers.

In addition, their boba has a pretty desirable consistency, not too smooth or soft. The shop is also very quiet and clean, so it would make a perfect date or study spot!\\n\\nI did find the wait time to be a little long, probably because they have to prepare the fruits, so make sure you plan accordingly.

Feng Shui appetizers seem to give you more bang for the buck, though taste-wise, like I said, everything I've tried has been wonderful.

I've had a whoopie pie here where I loved the filling but was not too happy with the crunchy cookie.  I've had more than one kale salad here (because I love kale), but R&D is heavy-handed on dressings.  I've noticed this trend with my kale salads and the house salad.  I recently had their apple pie dessert and while the sugar cookie crust is beyond delicious, the apples used were too sweet and the skins on them were a bit chewy (in a bad way).  I also think their sides are boring (French fries and mashed potatoes in a list of five items - say what?!) \\n\\nOn my last visit I was offered a card which listed items available a la carte from The Pantry.  My first impression was that The Pantry is a DIY charcuterie plate, but more items are available such as pimento cheese, deviled eggs and local honey.  The cheeses included chevre and bleu; and the meats included ham, salami, soppressata and bacon (yum!)  Next time, I want to sample items from The Pantry.

It reminded me of broasted chicken which is moist on the inside and crispy on the outside.  It's served hot (temperature wise) but not really spicy at all. I was waiting for the spiciness to kick in but got nothing.  And I don't even have a high tolerance for spicy food.  \\nThe baked beans were good and so were the piping hot fries.

But these drinks were so tough to get down. \\n\\nIn the downstairs section, when I ordered an espresso martini, the blonde female bartender I ordered from glared at me and turned away in disgust. I was shocked - the drink was listed on the board right behind her! She turned back after 4 minutes and said \\"yeah I'm not making that\\", and when I asked why, she offered no explanation. I was very confused. When we asked the bartender for an explanation he just said \\"she refused to serve you, for whatever reason\\". We had 2 drinks over the course of 4 hours so were not \\"cut off\\". No explanation whatsoever, and the other bartender we talked to said he thought they were discriminating against us.

REALLY torn because these cruises are hit or miss, and I mean big time. \\nLet's go through my experiences, shall we?\\n\\n1. I first went on this ship when I was in Middle School... yes, these ships have been around that long. It was a black tie event that was pretty much exclusively for the graduating class. It was fun... however we weren't allowed to go out on deck or to the upper levels. I admit that I kind of felt like I was in steerage. Plus from what I understand, there were other middle school classes on the other decks, so it would have been nice to mingle. I don't know if that was the decision of my class admins or the cruise line, so I'll let that slide. \\n\\n2. The worst time I ever had on this ship was a dinner cruise I took my now-wife on. This really stunk. The food was subpar, we pretty much got the same packages as in #4 but were not given any of the same treatment and to make matters worse? The DJ was absolutely horrible! There was this inner city support group on the boat, which were not even the majority of the passengers, but the she catered to them the ENTIRE FREAKEN TIME! If the music wasn't Spanish Pop (I don't speak Spanish), it was thug rap. Nothing dance-able, and because she was the one DJ on the boat, the shit music was inescapable. You went outside, she had it blaring on the external speakers. As you would imagine, someone actually went up to the DJ and complained. To which this woman responded, \\"I'm sorry, I have to play things for everyone.\\"\\nTHEN PLAY THINGS FOR EVERYONE!!! The DJ this cruise line hired catered to one small group on the boat and that's it. Seriously, if I'd know that this was a social justice cruise or one touting identity politics, I'd would have never booked it. I complained about the music to one of the staff, you think I got a discount or anything for my trouble? Nope. \\n\\n3. I'm lumping a few family functions we went to on this ship (apprx. 3) together into one category. They were fine, fun, and leisurely. Drinks were a touch pricey, but the food was decent and everyone had fun, so it was good. \\n\\n4. Took my now-wife on the ship for an anniversary package. The food was a buffet style and for the price... was average fair at best. However, we were given the royal treatment by the crew, the atmosphere was nice and all and all it was a very fun time. So not a major complaints.\\n\\nSo really, the rating should be somewhere between 2 1/2 to 3 stars. \\nAre the cruises worth your money? Ehh... they can be, but its really hit or miss. We've had a lot of fun and then other times couldn't wait to GTFO the boat. \\n\\nMy Advice to passengers:\\nKnow who your DJ is going to be ahead of time. Find the times where people say the best things about the boat and definitely try to go at later times. The cruises always seem nicer. \\n\\nMy Advice to the line:\\nEither hire your own DJ or keep a tighter leash on the ones you contract to have onboard.\\n\\nWill I go again?\\nEhh... if I'm not the one paying for it, sure. \\nIf it's a discounted pass, why not.\\nFull price...

I made a reservation by phone at 15:26 last Sunday because their online reservation system closes for same-day reservations at 15:00. I had a 7-minute conversation where the employee (Collin, sp?) took my contact information and credit card information. He explained that the charge was $105 per person for the tasting menu and that it was non-refundable as reservation was made within the 48-hour cancellation window. He also explained that if I wanted to do a wine-pairing I could either order via phone or when I got there. I said I would decide when I get there. So he charged my card $210 and I thought that was it...\\n\\nWhen I looked at my credit card statement, I see a $274.43 charge for 2 tasting menus (i.e. 2-person reservation). I called the restaurant and they explained that it was $210 + 8.9% tax + 20% hospitality fee. I was shocked. I asked the employee to clarify these charges, which he did, and then he said that I can refer to the website for more information. NOWHERE on the Staplehouse site or Tock's site for Staplehouse is there mention of a 20% hospitality fee. If you read the FAQ section on Tock's site for Staplehouse, it states under \\"Pre-payment\\" that the price \\"includes food, service, and taxes\\". Perhaps if I was able to make a reservation online I would have seen this information however the online system was closed thus I was forced to make a reservation by phone. The 8.9% tax and 20% hospitality fee information was NOT disclosed to me via phone. I would have never made a reservation if I had known the ultimate price was going to be more than $210 for 2 people. \\n\\nStaplehouse Management: I would like an answer as to how to rectify this situation. I called the restaurant this afternoon and was told I'd get a call from Cara (sp?) but so far no phone call. \\n\\nI know this may have been an honest mistake but it further detracts from my experience with your restaurant.

The Bartenders took a while (10 minutes or so from end of beer to new one) to get drinks. Some part of that is their fault; but they also hustle well for the size of the bar they're handling. Its a very large double ended bar. However the bar layout itself has a small lip towards the sitter where one cant lay their drink close to their chest as I like to. There were a vast amount of empty outside tables due to the sheer size of the place and its inability to decide between restaurant or bar room. Food wise, the wings were frozen and glazed over in sauce but tasted good. The burger was a bit overcooked and cheap in that manner but the buns were both toasted. However the burger tasted mostly of the good bread. \\n\\nThe bathrooms were extremely well kept, clean and surprisingly even heated. \\n\\nIn the spectrum of things it was run of the mill.

If ever there were a Korean spot that looks nothing like the others, it might just be Du Kuh Bee. It has amassed a reputation over the better part of two decades for providing authentic eats, in divy conditions no less, for people who know what they want.\\n\\nIn the early 2000s when I first discovered the joint, the ownership at the time was Korean. The menu was considerably simpler, the place was so bare bones that a sign was barely visible from the street. The parking was limited to street parking (same as it is today) and the open kitchen was the only thing that was the least questionable. The tables and bathrooms were literally on their last leg.\\n\\nCue Chef Frank Fong, who took over DKB several years ago. Though he's Chinese he's taken the time to ensure the quality of the food stays consistent with the fare established long before his current reign. The menu has understandably become more Korean-Chinese, with a bevy of stir fry and sino-compatible eats, all while giving the place a serious makeover. The space now fits more people and a prominent can't-miss sign now adorns the building.\\n\\nHe incorporates hand pulled noodles, something that new patrons often marvel at as he whirls noodles left and right before he serves it to them. Things like Ja Jang Myun (ÁÇ∏ÈÜ¨ÔøΩ? is made quite well here: fragrant, plentiful, and the bolognese blankets the noodles with just a touch of oil. It's not the best I've ever had by any stretch, but it's good enough to merit multiple orders. I would avoid the U-Dong noodles and go exclusively with this.\\n\\nThen there are is the wonderful mandoo dumplings, which look more akin to the dongbei (Êù±Âåó) variety one might see in Chinese cuisine. The skin is nicely smooth and the pork fillings always keep me in a happy mood. From first glance, they would look more shui jiao (Ê∞¥È§É) than Mandoo, but as long as they're tasty, I don't think many would care that much.\\n\\nMost of the Korean dishes are meat heavy. From chicken and beef bulgolgi to ribs, gizzards, and squid. There is also octopus (nakji) available, which gets my nostalgia bell all set in. No pajun, jigaes, or banchan to speak of, which may be red flags to Korean lovers seeking more traditional dishes. At least the kimchi tofu ($14) is solid, but it's hardly pungent enough to win over the masses.\\n\\nThe prices are affordable and the service gets it done.

We told the waiter we needed a few minutes to go over the plethora of options and he asked us to close our menus as a signal that we were ready to order. We still had to flag him down several minutes after having closed our menus.\\n\\nWe all got a collection of sweet and savory items. One coworker got an egg and cheese on a croissant and a half order of the coconut macaroon french toast. She loved everything and said that she wished she had ordered two egg croissants. My other coworker got scrambled eggs and 1 pancake. She seemed happy as well. I went with the fried chicken and waffle and asked for them to be on separate plates. They were not. No biggie - I asked for another plate and got it. The waffle was good. It was reminiscent of a standard diner waffle. No complaints. The fried chicken was super dry and disappointing. It might have been good if they hadn't fried out every lick of moisture - I'll never know.\\n\\nBeyond the sad chicken was the sad service. While our waiter was polite - he was also distracted.

We started going when Sound Bites moved next door and it was a pleasant relief from the bad customer service we were used to getting.\\n\\nAlways had great service and great food... until today.  Food was good as usual, and our waitress was sweet, however, on more than one occasion, the waitress kicked my designer handbag that was resting on the floor beside my chair.  I kept moving it back out and finally asked her to stop touching my bag.  She explained that her boss (Mike) would have a fit if it were in the aisle (which it was not) so I told her that he could ask me to move it if it were a problem.\\n\\nSure enough, he quickly came over and asked me to put it under my chair (which wasn't very clean).  I picked it up as we were done with our meal anyway.  Instead of dropping the subject, Mike continued to say in a loud voice, \\"it's all about the safety\\".  Huh?  It's not like the aisles are that small, nor was the restaurant crowded, nor was my bag in anyone's way at all.  I then proceeded to ask Mike if maybe he could install hooks under the tables for the bags so that this wouldn't be a problem in the future.  He went on about customers with huge legs and how would that work with hooks.  What?  He sure was acting crazy!  Not the customer service I've come to expect.\\n\\nNot sure I'll be a back anytime soon.  My girlfriend that was with me said that at a recent visit she was asked by Mike to hurry up and finish eating.  Seems like we're back to the old Sound Bite days again.

My frustration was with Mike, the owner. My description of what happened is accurate and honest. The server DID kick my bag under the seat a few times. She actually seemed scared of being disciplined by Mike for letting me \\"keep it in the aisle\\". She was sweet and just doing her job.\\n\\nThe feedback of installing hooks for ladies' purses was a good suggestion, at least I thought, but when Mike went off about larger people and the size of their legs hitting the hook, etc. it became comical.

As in a deep, deep hatred. So the green thumb and garden on tap were not my favourite... at all. The health rocket tasted incredibly citrusy (more lemon than anything else), but I absolutely LOVED the blue-green lagoon. I'm only sorry that the \\"cleanser\\" (cucumber, pineapple, lemon, aloe vera, coconut water & chia seeds) was not included for me to try. I will definitely be more prepared next time I try this out. \\nThe guy at the counter was incredibly knowledgeable, friendly and helpful (hence me unexpectedly walking out with a 1-day cleanse!) Total cost for 1-day cleanse was $63 (taxes in). I was to have all 6 bottles within the day, approximately 2- 3 hours apart, with water/unsweetened coconut water in between. I found that for someone who was such little willpower when it comes to resisting good food, I thought this cleanse (despite the fact that it was only a day-long affair) would be a lot harder than it was. I was NEVER hungry throughout the day. What I did feel, however, was a longing for something yummy. I like vegetables and fruits as much as the next person, but to have nothing at all to eat throughout the day BUT fruits/vegetables was the most unsavory experience of my life.

So the Portland brewpub had to suffice. \\n\\nThis Deschutes brewpub is a little too commercial for me. They appear to be the \\"Cheesecake Factory\\" of breweries. Perhaps they're getting too big for their britches, yet they still serve up some darn good beer. While not quite on the same scale of Widmer Brothers grandiosity,  Deschutes is several leagues ahead of any of the local Portland breweries in terms of size and volume.\\n\\nThe wait times seem like they can be ridiculous ala' Cheesecake Factory. The time spent admiring their display case can only kill so many minutes before the boredom, hunger, or beer cravings kicks in. \\n\\nSince there weren't many interesting Vegan options to eat on the menu (which is surprising considering Portland's reputation for excellent Vegan food) I just stuck to beer. Not that I have any qualms about this. Gimme good beer and I'm all set. \\n\\nAnd good beer is what Deschutes does best. Most folks know Deschutes from their Mirror Pond Pale Ale or the Black Butte Porter which can be found nearly everywhere including my favorite place to purchase, TJ's.\\n\\nSince I don't know when I would ever get the chance to visit Deschutes again, my honey treated me to an outstanding double sampler tray of seasonal and reserve brews. Each tray only comes with 6 beers, so she doubled it up so I could try nearly all of their beers on tap. The Nitro Obsidian Stout still ended up being my favorite. The Inversion IPA was so so but the seasonal Jubelale was a nice change of pace. Go for the Reserve XXV/etc. Anniversary Porter if you get the chance. Barrel aged Porter with a deep, strong flavor. It packs quite the intense bite.\\n\\nOne cool thing about their brewpub is that they often brew up experimental beers for this location only.

I told the door guy that we weren't, and he asked me how I heard about it. After I told him he said we  were good to go and was very welcoming, put leis around our necks, and led us to a table.\\n\\nFirst impression... this place is dark and hidden and kind of cavernous. It's definitely not what I was expecting though... I had a bright open-air place pictured in my mind, but I guess with liz lessner I should have expected the dim secret tiki cave that it was. \\n\\nI had the dark and stormy (rum and ginger beer), and it was delicious. I think it was only $4 if I remember correctly. We also tried the eggrolls which were yummy. The menus seemed temporary, so I don't know if they will be the same when they have the grand opening next Tuesday.\\n\\nOverall, I thought this place was cool, but I wonder if there will be a patio area for nice weather. I feel like a tiki bar needs a cool patio or at least windows/doors that open like marcellas. I know Columbus doesn't have the best weather, but the summers are nice and I just feel like there aren't enough cool patios here.

The service however leaves MUCH to be desired.  Whether we came with a group of friends or just as a couple, it took awhile until we saw our waitress/waiter and our drinks were not refilled until we asked.  That seemed to be a standard.  Normally an empty glass on the edge of the table is a subtle hint.  We have phoned in orders as well, MANY times, and to say they are rude is putting it mildly.   And we have always called in pick up orders after the dinner rush, hence the pick up vs eating in, so they weren't offish on the phone because they were busy.  My husband placed an order a few nights ago and the female that took our order was rude over the phone as well as when the order was picked up.

As a girl who has lived in NC for almost 25 yrs, when I got the Southern Sweet tea, I was expecting a lot more sweetness than I got; they either forgot the sugar or need to update the recipe for Southern Sweet tea.

This is a greasy spoon, where everyone that works there is as friendly as f. They love their clientele. I feel like if there is an introduction to Austin & a place to encapsulate Texas hospitality - this is it folks. \\n\\nThere will always be a wait. Just be prepared. It's never too long. There are coffee cups by the register you can use while you wait. Outside in front there's a cooler full of water if you have up wait outside. **Remember to sign in by the register**- the wait seems like agony because you see so much good food passing you by, but it's worth it. I promise. \\n\\nThe pancakes are this gem. They don't really need butter. Listen, trust me - with fruit. And it's not drizzled on it. It's like this mystical secret. You order pancakes with blueberries or strawberries (personally my favorite) they appear with one or two pieces of fruit. I felt such disappointment- but my husband wagged his finger at me - Don't judge a book by its cover - I bit into the pancake & WOW. The buttermilk batter had strawberries in it hidden in every bite. This is the food you dream of. These pancakes don't come with butter on them, and normally that would offend me, but honestly they don't need if. If you feel the need they will give you butter on the side.\\n\\nTheir has browns are crispy & golden. I've had their homemade tamales (oh my goodness) & they are amazing - if they are in the board as a special get them. I always get them with a sunny side egg so the yolk is like cheese.

My mouth waters when I think about the brisket.  It's moist and seasoned well, sometimes I don't even bother to use the house made BBQ sauces.  You can get two cuts, lean and moist.  I go for the moist cut, extra fatty juiciness!  The lean cut is good too, if you prefer to try to be a little bit healthy, but I'm not about that!  The pork belly is also delicious.  Lots of people don't like it since it is fattier, well mostly fat, but it melts in your mouth and I can't get enough.  I opt for a small 1/8 lb. piece to keep my heart from stopping.  It is an expensive meal if you order a lot, but very comparable to the prices at other BBQ joints (even in the south).

They are settled on the Chattahoochee River in the Vinings area (and who doesn't love Vinings?) with complimentary Valet.  I dined her recently with my sister and when we arrived we received a brief history lesson of the restaurant, got a chance to be shown pictures of when it was ravaged by the flood, and the hostess shared that her parents actually dined at the facility decades ago.  We were swiftly sweated and the waitress, Amber, was very accommodating on this very busy Friday evening.\\n\\nI started with the Butternut Squash soup.  It was warm, rich, and creamy and was such a great way to start dinner on this beautiful Friday evening.  I was between the Rainbow Trout and the Salmon, and after inquiring with the waitress, I choose the Salmon given the delineated portion size and it was delicious, cooked to my liking, and absolutely good until the last bite.\\n\\nI glanced at the dessert menu but there were not many options that I favored, but perhaps there will be other, more traditional Southern options in the future, but I suppose what was offered were the Pastry Chef's specialties.  \\n\\nCanoe has a very famed reputation in the Atlanta area and I do plan to visit again to try their brunch options.

I would have never ordered the chicken hearts but they were a gift from the kitchen and also a gift for my mouth! They were grilled with a light sauce that balances out the richness perfectly. That one dish told me that whatever they put on their menu I should try as it will be expertly prepared and tasty. Make sure you try the grilled bread, so wonderful even though it seems so simple.\\n\\nFor our dinners we went family style and all shared the Sunday supper fried chicken, a pork chop and the ancho rubbed pork steak with salsa verde. Our sides were the grilled broccoli with garlic and grit casserole. Every dish brought its own highlight to the meal and amongst all of us we could not agree on a favorite because they all stood out in their own way. The pork chop was basically pork butter it was so well cooked, the fried chicken was juicy and scrispy, and the pork steak was amazingly flavorful.

There was a grapefruit tart that was not too sweet, an icebox pie topped with peanuts and caramel, a mimosa sorbet and a lime pudding type dessert with a strawberry topping. Again, we could not choose a favorite as each had its own reason to be loved and savored!\\n\\nWe all agreed this was a top 10 dining experience and not to be missed if you are in Austin.

Upon initial seating we were assigned to our server Jodey T. He greeted us with the usual hello's of which he was not very warm. We were seated during what appeared to be a dinner rush so I paid no mind to the rush introduction. Being that we visit this location often and have been doing so for the past seven years my friend asked about the happy hour discount price for the Quartino Blackberry Sangria and our server Jodey looked at us with a confused look and then said no we only have wine deals and did not bother to inquire for us. STRIKE 1. So my friend decided not to press the issue with him. Instead she went up to the bar personally to ask and was given the deal she was accustomed to. While she was at the bar the server came up to the table with a smirk on his face and asked me \\"so what is she just going to sit at the bar now\\" and I replied with no she will be back she is doing some fact checking.   I placed my order and he asked if I knew what she wanted and I was perplexed that he was asking me to order for her  but I responded with she will return to place her own order and he left and came back to take her order. STRIKE 2 As the meal went on he checked on us once and we asked for more bread being that there were three people at our table and then when the meal came we asked for more FREE bread and after our request he had a look on his face as if he could not understand why we were asking for more FREE bread. STRIKE 3 As we continued with our meal the server decided to prematurely bring us to go boxes before we even asked for them as we're were NOT finished eating. STRIKE 4 I advised him that there would be two checks and we would like some bread to take with our leftovers. He returns with one bag and one bread ASSuming that we were going to the same location. I proceeded to ask him for a second bag and bread. He paused and said you want more bread? We typically charge for the bread but I won't charge you just be nice to me. STRIKE AGAIN. Who has the audacity to ask for a tip. REALLY? And furthermore we have NEVER been charged when we ask for some bread before leaving. We did not respond. By this time I am so exhausted with this lackluster experience. The server then brings the checks and by this time we are so outdone but even so, I still understand that this job is not an easy one and I never leave zero for a tip. So even though this server deserved nothing because of his poor service I went ahead and tipped according to my cell phone tip app. I decided to tip him a FAIR rate. My friend paid with cash and he gave her cash right at the table and then he took my debit card and returned it. After we discussed what we thought of his service we filled out the tip and put the receipt holders over by the wall of our booth. I would notice the server looking out at us through his peripheral each time he walked by as we continued to finish our Sangria's. He then (before we were finished) approached our table and attempted to reach over my friend to get the receipts (to check his tip amount obviously) back instead of attempting to clear some of the dirty dishes. I have never experienced a server trying to pick up the receipts before clearing the table first. Because I knew what he was attempting to do I told him he can pick them up once we leave and he seemed to be upset. ANOTHER STRIKE. We finally get up to leave and as we walk to the car we are standing there talking to each other and the next thing we notice is our  server and another server come out of the side exit to look at us my friend looks over and notices this. The server then proceeds to say in front of customers dining outside \\"THE NEXT TIME I WILL CHARGE YOU FOR THE BREAD!\\" Now I am LIVID! We walk back into the restaurant request the manager and tell him everything that happened from beginning to end. I am totally disgusted. The manager Mr. Paul Victor did a wonderful job of damage control and the young lady at the seating podium was helpful with providing our servers name. I do feel as if our server Jodey T needs to be fired immediately. You do not accost a paying customer, tips are NOT a given, nor are they entitled to receive a tip if not rightfully earned. This server did NOT deserve one red cent but we gave anyway because not tipping at all is not what we do. VERY DISGUSTED with this entire experience with the exception of the save on behalf of the manager on duty Paul Victor and the lady at the seating podium. Jodey T needs to be put on dish washing duty or FIRED because he does not deserve to work around customers who are using hard earned money to receive a decent meal. I will post on whatever website I can find. This was the worst dining experience service wise that I have ever received. Food,drink,and manager save was WONDERFUL. This rating weighs heavily on the service received."},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Love the concept but the food itself just gave was just pedestrian.  Most of the other reviews pretty much summed it up.  But just to reiterate:\\n\\nChipotle-ish decor.\\nWide array of tapas and dishes.\\nEndless cycle of Asian-themed episodes of No Reservations on their TVs (why??)\\n\\n\\nThe Curry Laksa looked awesome but it the soup itself was lacking flavor.  Each of the ingredients alone were a esome (fried tofu, hard boiled egg, stewed chicken, chinese broccoli, and lots of chilis) except the soup base itself was underseasoned.  If you took away all those other ingredients, the flavors were uninspired and honestly a little boring to eat.\\n\\nThe Chilled Tofu dish would have been much better if more sauce/seasoning had been poured on.\\n\\nLastly, the roast pork dish was good, but it was served cold and a little undercooked (fat was too chewy even for me)  Not better than the exact same roast pork dishes at a true authentic Chinese restaurant.  The sauce was just hoisin sauce straight out of the bottle.\\n\\n\\nThe whole experience left you with this shoulda, coulda, woulda type feeling.

After I placed my order at 9:25 I got a phone call from a staff member and they said they had turned their ovens off and they closed at 9:30. I told them that their website said they were open until 10 o'clock but he said they close at 9:30. I told him that he should change the website, they never did. So I thought I would give them one more chance and I went in there this evening for the first time. I ordered online for a pick up at their location. When I got there, there was a sign that said \\"order here\\" and a few people were in line to order. Since I had already ordered I went over to the register to pay for and pick up my order. The older lady that worked up front was very rude to me and told me that they would go ahead and put my order in the oven and get to me after she got to everybody in line that was ordering. I asked why they didn't put my order in the oven and she said that they wait until the customer gets there before they make it. So what was the point of ordering online? So I waited out of frustration. She continued to help everybody else, she was even taking care of customers that came in after me. One of their customers in line even offered to let her take my payment because I got there before her and the lady told her not to worry about me. The customer apologized to me which I thought was really nice. I think she felt bad that the lady was so rude. Also I would like to mention that the older lady who is working the front was taking payments from everyone and also handling the food without washing her hands, not cool. I'm pretty sure that's a health code violation. By the time the lady got to me she still had an attitude. I told her that it was my first time there and that maybe she should not assume that I knew how they ran things especially since there was no sign for pick ups. She rudely told me about how she had to take care of her line and really made me feel like me as a consumer did not matter. What would be helpful moving forward is if first they changed their website to the proper hours and then perhaps have a sign for people who order online and pick up orders. They should also note on their website that they don't prepare or cook the order until you get there instead of the website telling you when your order would be ready and when to pick it up at a certain time. I will not be returning, I won't give my business to someone who treats me like that. It seem like she was having a bad day but I believe that customer service should be a priority, Especially when I'm paying over $20 for a pizza. The pizza was tasty but ultrathin, not much to it.

Couldn't taste or see the short rib in there at all. Caesar steak tartare is an interesting take and was good too. \\n\\nFor entrees, the bolognese was my favorite. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was hearty and full of flavor. Chicken parm was cooked perfectly: still crispy on the outside and juicy and tender inside. \\n\\nThe reason I gave this place 2 stars is because the waitress Kate recommended Cacio e Pepe so we took her up on it. Oh my god i cannot even begin to describe how salty it was. We really tried but it was truly inedible. The pancetta was burnt and made the whole dish smoky. But it was also really watery which is strange for cacio e pepe. I never complain about food but we mentioned to the waitress how crazy salty it was and she was very dismissive and told us that's how it's supposed to be. She was inattentive and not great prior, but I found that exchange to be pretty rude."},{"name":"gusto!","address":"782 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Gusto advertises themselves as the better Chipotle.

They make great flavor combinations like mangos+ avocados and the serving sizes are quite nice. Especially when you take in account the free side order of sweet potato chips that are AMAZING. Very terra chips like but much fresher. Some other reasons why I like Gusto include super fast service, FREE EASY PARKING, and their BOGO floral Friday.

I of course often review from the plant based vegan angle and will drop some comments with that in mind. The veggie burger isn't bad. The cauliflower app, which I think is a take on a Nepalese dish that I'd eaten originally at the Indian/Nepal restaurant in Ball Sq Somerville, would be good if they made that all vegan. I think they toss egg batter in there from what they told me. We make a version of this at home which is fantastic. If they could make it vegan, then it would be another menu item that would appeal to everyone and expand their customer base further - hey why leave out 5-10% of the people (and a growing number?).\\n\\nService is always ok when I go.

Stale saltines are served with the chili taster plate so those were just tossed in the trash. Wish I could write up that the chili is good because I've really been looking forward to trying this place for a while and I LOVE chili but it's really not great. And people, frankly I'm not that picky about food. Chunky/chewy meat and mediocre flavor. Had the chili baked potato, too, and all I can say that's pleasant about that is generous portion there. We were also overcharged, so beware of that. I realized once I left and called in and dealt with a rude guy who answered the phone that acted like he didn't have time for our exactly one minute phone call and assumed I wasn't figuring tax in (when in fact he couldn't add properly -  despite his attitude he did confirm my bill before tax would have been about $16 bill so with tax that shouldn't amount to $19). He told me I needed to come in and look at a menu myself when I asked the price of two items, trying to double check whether I was charged properly or not. I told him I was looking at the online menu prices and something didn't add up and he said it's a fake menu online, that the restaurant didn't put a menu out there...sooo thanks dude, you are so unhelpful and rude when you know I have to ask you (or drive back over there and deal w/parking) to get accurate info since it's not even online! I probably should have let it go once I left the restaurant and realized I was overcharged since it wasn't a significant amount, but curiosity of how I got overcharged got the best of me because this is the second time at a downtown restaurant in the last several months. Odd. Ultimately I didn't argue with the person on the phone because it's not worth the headache of arguing with an idiot over a few dollars. But the annoying part is I'm pretty sure it was the same bartender that took my order when I was there and now I'm regretting leaving a tip. Even at the three or whatever stars this place gets its overrated.

This is a multi-part review of our dining experience at the Jack Allen's Restaurant at the Y Oak Hill (Austin).  The Good.  The restaurant as far as the food goes, is always top notch.  I don't think that we have gone in there over the years when the food wasn't great.  However, the success of the restaurant also creates some of the biggest criticisms from us.  The bad.  When we arrived, the parking lot was extremely congested and the parking attendants were running behind.  It took approximately 15 minutes to get someone to take the car from us.  In addition, the way that the valets were parking the cars in the aisles etc, it was a small miracle that something wasn't damaged.  The wait was also a bit long - 45 minutes, but chalk that one up to the quality of the food.  We also had a fairly large party 7 x people.  The ugly.  The service once we were seated was when things took a turn for the worse and is what caused me to sit down and do this review.  The server that we had was relatively inexperienced and gave the appearance of being bothered when we asked for water etc.  The timing of the appetizers took a really long time and arrived just a short time before the main course.  Though we asked several times about one of the meals, the meal was very late to the table.  Everyone else had almost finished eating - it was obvious that the order was forgotten, and had one of us not gone to the hostess area to complain, I am not sure it would have ever arrived.

I would say, the bun was good, the pickles in the burger were very good, but it was all ruined by that overcooked beef. It's sad because I feel like this can easily be fixed by cooking the meat medium rare to medium and using less salt. It's a HUGE insult to Japan to use the waygu name and cook it burnt to a crisp. Laughable, really. Someone who works at Dai Due needs to learn how to properly cook and season waygu beef, or just take this off the menu entirely.

However, it was so disappointing and a waste of money. There were so many things wrong that I'll make a numbered list.\\n\\n1) After waiting 15 mins, sitting down and ordering - we were told they ran out of beef brisket and ribs. Ok, fair enough I guess.. Saturday night and it's a new restaurant.. so we ordered other things instead.\\n\\n2) Pulled pork \\"burrito\\": Since the brisket was out, we got the pulled pork instead. This was DEFINITELY not worth $14 and not a burrito at all. It was more of a snack wrap. The size was pretty small. It also was really plain.\\n\\n3) They decided to wait until the chicken and sausage platter came to tell us the corn bread was sold out as well. Wtf. So the server came back with a plain piece of bread. Un toasted, no butter, nothing. Just a random slice of bread. On the menu it said southern style white bread but there was nothing different about this. See picture.\\n\\n4) Since the brisket and ribs were out, we got the chicken instead. The chicken was really dry and had no flavour to it as the marinate only reached the skin.\\n\\n5) They gave us the wrong side dish which is not a big deal, but the server treated me like I was stupid.  When I asked the server (I was polite about it) she treated me as if I was stupid and that it was my fault. I had to repeat it 3 times for her to finally understand.\\n\\nI'm not a picky eater or a rude customer. Nor do I ever take the time to write such a long Yelp review.

The main dishes all come with salad, rice and beans. Unfortunately I wasn't thrilled about anything on my plate because it all just tasted okay to me. The beans were watery and not much in the way of flavor. The yellow rice was average. And the meat was pulled beef sort of thing and nothing spectacular. It was dry and lacked any flavor. My friends enjoyed their meals so I would possibly give Papi's another try but probably after I try some other Cuban restaurants in the area. \\n\\nParking is available for free, 2 hours, in the deck across the street.

As they went to leave they were stopped at the door and were told they didn't pay the full amount. They were told that they needed to pay $23 the full amount which included the $5 tip.

Unfortunately, a lot of places in and around downtown ATL were closing down for the day (this was later in the afternoon), but this place showed up on Yelp, and it also happened to be located on the way back to where we were staying.\\n\\nWhen we started pulling up to the place, we thought that perhaps Google Maps had led us astray, as the place appeared to be located in the middle of an industrial park, but lo and behold, the bakery was indeed located in the middle of it. Once inside, we saw that the place was pretty large and probably did a lot of baking for restaurants in the area. There were over a dozen different varieties of cakes and pies to choose from, either by the slice, or whole. The man in front of me told me that their cherry pie was to die for, so we ended up getting a slice of that, along with a slice of their orange blossom pound cake, and of course, a whole pecan pie.\\n\\nThe pecan pie was as good as you would expect from a southern bakey, as was the orange blossom pound cake, but the true standout truly was the cherry pie. It wasn't overly sweet, and the cherries had just the right amount of tartness to them, which matched their sugary, buttery crusts. Just thinking about their cherry pie is making my mouth water.\\n\\nI'm pretty sure that you could pick almost anything from this place, and you would end up with a winner. They also appear to have some savory food items for breakfast and lunch, if you happened to be looking for something not sweet as well.

All I can say is WOW. So lets start with the Boudin sausage. This is a pork sausage with rice and creole seasoning. Slight bit of heat but delicious. Warning: once you break the casing it kinda all falls apart. Next the HolyTrinity. A gumbo made with chicken, andouille sausage, and jumbo shrimp. No skimping on quality ingredients here. And unlike so many gumbos I have tried elsewhere,  this one is not even remotely soupy. The broth is the perfect balance for the rest of the ingredients. Once mixed in with the rice and other ingredients it is just right. Not too dry and filled with flavor. This has a bit more heat than average but not the \\"oww my mouth is on fire\\" variety like 3 alarm texas chili. The heat is enough to wake up your taste buds so they say wow, something good going on up in here. Filled with flavors from Brandon's grandfather's recipe, who is FROM New Orleans, this took me back to when I lived in New Orleans. And talk about your generous portions. This bowl was filled to the top. I am only down to the first line and I am already full. Bear in mind the last time I ate prior to now was at around 7pm last night. It is currently 5pm. Ok, onto the beverages. Brandon uses Cafe Dumonde, a genuine New Orleans treasure. Since 1860 Cafe Dumonde has been serving up thier coffee and chicory blend and baguettes in Jackson Square.  Brandon blends this great coffee with sweet cream and who knows what else to make a delicious iced coffee that won't find anywhere else this far west of Louisiana. Starbucks eat your heart out. Your iced coffee has nothing on this brew. Finally, Brandons grandmothers banana pudding. I have yet to taste it but it looks wonderful. And again, portion wise it is huge. It is served in a venti sized cup. I am looking forward to this treat later in my shift. Bottom line, go enjoy.

For example I went for my birthday dinner (bad idea but wanted to try something new) my brothers plate came out 45mins after my plate.

Therefore, unless everyone at your table is sharing food then know that no one gets their meal at the same time. \\n\\nBesides the service being bad the food was delicious  However I did notice they started serving smaller portions on the more experience products like octopus and duck, so just beware of that if you decide to go\\n\\nAll in all I won't be going back nor do I recommend this place."},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"1455 Tuskawilla Rd","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"4","text":"I have to say this one of most oddly laid-out CFA's I've ever been to.

The restaurant is located in Olympic Village and right away, I was cringing at the thought of finding parking around in that area. Using a new technique of positive thinking, I willed myself into believing that we would find a parking spot and sure enough, it worked! A positive start so far!\\n\\nIt was a Friday night and we didn't make any reservations so I was pleasantly surprised to get seated right away at dinner hour (6:30 ish). The name of the restaurant was a play on the word \\"Bao\\" which means bun in chinese. Any restaurant that flaunts their buns better have some kick ass buns! \\n\\nThe ambience of the restaurant reflected the hippish restaurant name. Black painted walls, wooden accents everywhere, a giant living edge bar table. A giant mural of a colorful cow painted on the wall stared at me for the entire meal. They had clever names on their menu which seems a bit clich√© but my wife keeps complaining that I'm too sensitive to tacky things so I endured.\\n\\nI ordered a dozen oysters and crab cakes to start. Price of the oysters was quite steep. About 2 bucks per shuck. The crab cakes came with the \\"bao\\" which I was eagerly waiting to taste. First impressions? It was rather disappointing. The bun was dry and a bit crusty. I had to mash a fist full of crab cake and the mayo sauce into a dime sized piece of \\"Bao\\" to get it down my throat. Honestly, a crappy dim sum place steamed better buns than Bao Down so I was rather disappointed.\\n\\nI ordered \\"The big boss\\" curry with short ribs as a main and the wife did their \\"Same same but different\\" noodle with egg. The curry was not bad. On the sweeter side which is not my normal palate but stomach'able. The short rib was \\"fall of the bone tender\\" which was nice. The rice noodle dish that my wife ordered was mediocre and for the price we were paying, it did sting us a bit that it didn't knock us off our seats.\\n\\nTLDR:\\nRestaurant: Cool'ish restaurant to hang out at happy hour 3/5\\nFood: Fusion. The clever names don't do anything to prop up the mediocre food. The Bao's don't deserve a \\"bow\\" (see what I did there?) because they are just mediocre. 2.5/5\\nPrice: Our tab was over $100 for two people. If I didn't order the oysters, crab cakes or beer, I would be in at 40 bucks with tip. Bang for the \\"Bao\\" (see what I did again?) I could have had better elsewhere for cheaper.

Jeff scored particulary well on a beer that was a partnership between Deschutes and Hair of the Dog and was bourbon barrel aged or something like that and had some crazy ABV level like 13%. He loved it. Tried the Shepherd's Pie and some burgers. Food was satisfying but not overly memorable. Came for and loved the beer. \\n\\nEven with all the other places to explore in Portland I am looking forward to coming back soon."},{"name":"Ball Square Cafe","address":"708 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"Good food, good service!

I would write out the menu description for you, but maybe you would get a better sense of what this entree is if I described it to you in my own words.\\n\\nFirst, you've got a HUGE serving of their broccoli, bamboo (it's almost like they have a surplus of bamboo), cabbage, onions, and other vegetables sauteed in their special \\"house sauce\\" (It's like soy sauce-y, but with a sweeter taste). Next, you've got their chicken, beef, and shrimp (yes, all three). The chicken is tender, the shrimp is average, but the beef is very tough. If you find a piece big enough, your jaw will start hurting mid-chew. I had to swallow a couple of the beef chunks out of pure exhaustion, and still was able to almost choke on it.\\n\\nAND THEN, the star of the dish: the PAN FRIED FLAT NOODLES. I think the best way to explain them would be strips of flat noodles stuck together and fried, as if they just pulled them right out of the frozen package, chopped it up a bit, and pan-fried them without separating the individual sheets. It is actually PERFECT, where the outside develops this crunchy texture, and the inside stays soft like noodles should be.\\n\\nAS GR8 AS THIS DISH IS, why am I not giving this place 4-5 stars!? Because the ratio of vegetables (more specifically, their surplus of bamboo), tough meat, and perfect noodles is pretty much 70%, 20%, 10% respectively, no exaggeration.

For the food we ordered the sampler platter, fried calamari, NXNW wings, fried artichoke hearts and sausage stuffed mushrooms. The wings were pretty good, with an Asian sauce and they were fried well. They were the best thing on the platter, and they weren't great. The artichokes were very bland but the marinara sauce did help some. The calamari was very chewy and many of the pieces were cut too thick which really magnified their rubbery texture. The sausage stuffed mushrooms were good, but sadly, just good. We decided to try something else so we ordered the roasted garlic bulbs.

I think the food is potentially the best here of the trendy Southie locales (at least of the Loco, Lincoln, Fat Baby, and Broadway bunch). If you're coming you have to get the meat and cheese, this is one of my favorite charcuterie boards in the city, if for nothing else than the honey that they have which is out of this world paired with cheese. Free bread and great oil which is always a plus. I've found the other apps, in particular the arancinis, to be excellent. The pizzas are also quite good and sizeable portions. I enjoy the pasta from time to time but am less of a pasta eater, but mainly enjoy that you can get a half size (which allows you to enjoy the meat and cheese board and an app or salad). Pretty good price. Brunch is good with trendy options but not necessarily something to write home about. \\n\\nDrinks/bar: if you're okay with house wine, the bottles, carafes, and jugs are cheap-ish, especially for southie. They also have good espresso martinis and espresso martini shots. \\n\\nAtmosphere: Capo is very large and open (bigger than Lincoln and more open so seems extra large), and it is classy looking. There is a lot of wood and brick, so again it looks classy and trendy. During the winter I think there are a couple of fireplaces so it seems extra cosy, and they decorate cutely for the holidays. The staff are a bit typical of Southie, so I wouldn't say overly friendly but usually nice. \\n\\nDownstairs: it seems that a good amount of the negative reviews involve some sort of a delay with getting downstairs (there is a basement bar that often has a band but always has a dance floor). Things those people need to understand: 1) Southie nightlife is unreasonable. On a Friday or Saturday typically every bar has a line to wait in outside. I hate lines, I'm not saying I like it, but that's a fact about Southie bars and that's a geography issue not a Capo issue. 2) there are very few places in Southie that have the dancing option, so Capo not only has the line to get to the bar, but you also have a line to get in the basement. Capo basement is really fun, especially compared to a lot of the chiller (read: more boring) bars in Southie, so know that you have even more competition here than other Southie bars. Anyway the point is you should understand this before rolling up and assuming when you have a reservation (or if you don't...) that you will get to bypass this long line. Don't come here for dinner necessarily for the basement, or yes, you'll probably be disappointed. Take it up with the residents of Southie but good luck trying to change that demographic. \\n\\nHOWEVER I do have tips if it's the bar/basement you desire. When you get there for dinner (assuming you're eating upstairs) put your name on the list to go down. They *usually* get you on the list while you're eating to go down, which will shorten your wait. But remember, even if you have to sit at the bar upstairs like a peasant, that other people are waiting outside in line for bars exactly like this at Lincoln, Loco, etc.... and second, (kudus to you if you read this far, so here is your reward) if you make a reservation far enough out you can make it at the \\"supper club\\" aka in a table downstairs. They will only take your reservation until 7:30 PM because by the time the 7:30 diners finish their dinner the basement is ready to get lit, and you're already there. So again, to those of you doing your research, congrats you can potentially bypass the line.

I was told he didn't bring out the ice cream and it wasn't his deal. Then at the end of the night our bill was incorrect from the same waiter, I showed him and I told him he was pathetic after how he treated me earlier.\\nNext thing I know a manager is asking me to come with him. He accused me of verbally assaulting his waiter. I asked him if he always took his staff's side and he said yes. I told him he was full of carp and dead wrong. And now he owes me $38 for making me miss the show. I can't believe all this actually happen tonight. I'm still in awe.\\nIf this is how your employees are trained this is pathetic and everyone need to know \\n\\nI need someone that can show me they care and can take care of this to return my messages left with the front desk along with my number.

One of Portland's best for sure.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nSouthern/Cajun is my favorite cuisine so trying Mumbo Gumbo was a must.  The gumbo was awesome, the Okra stood out as the best part.  To no fault of the owner's I did not care for the rice as it was dry.  However, that's true to the way they serve it in Louisiana.  The small size is an ample portion.\\n\\nWe also enjoyed the Shrimp and Grits.  First, another generous portion.  Excellent overall, especially whatever it's topped with.

The ranchero sauce is perfectly spicy and smokey, so good you'll be scooping it up with a spoon after your fried egg - corn tortilla - cheese - sauce stack has been consumed.  This plate is also blessed with two strips of thick bacon, but I always have to give up one strip to the preschooler, so that cuts out 100 calories right there. \\n\\nDinner is definitely more carefree here and we've never seen a wait at that time.

We landed on this spot, and I'm quite happy with the choice! This place makes pretty authentic versions of Shanghai and Jiangsu dishes for a really good price.\\n\\nWe were actually quite lucky to get a table, as almost all of the tables were reserved that evening for large families coming out for a Sunday dinner.\\n\\nWe ordered a lot for this meal, but most of them were small dishes. For cold dishes, we got smoked fish, jelly pork, and drunken chicken. We also got shengjian bao and xiaolong bao as they were popular here. For the main dishes, we got the classic lion's head and something called huotui jin bai, which was cabbage in a white sauce with some ham.\\n\\nOkay, I can acknowledge that a lot of these dishes don't sound... particularly appetizing. But don't stop reading, please! All of these dishes have something good about them, I swear.\\n\\nLet's start with the shengjian bao. The shengjian bao was a very solid bun. It was fresh off the pans and way too hot to eat at first, so hooray for fresh buns! The outside was extremely crispy, and the inside of the bun was nice and soft. The meat filling was pretty standard, good but nothing to write home about. It was EXTREMELY juicy, with it pouring out once you take a bite. For those who aren't familiar with this bao: LET IT COOL! You'll scorch your mouth if you don't! Don't let a hot bun ruin your day :(\\n\\nHave you been to Din Tai Fung? So you must've had their xiaolong bao, then! Yeaaa don't expect that here. This XLB is REALLY good, but it is in no way shape or form the XLB you would normally expect. Shanghainese XLBs are normally very delicate and small, with a very thin wrapper. This is not that kind of XLB. What you get, instead, is a thicker wrapper, almost like an actual dumpling, a larger sized bao, and a much fattier and heavier meat filling and soup. And that almost sounds like the opposite of a conventional XLB. But here's the thing. It works. Yes, it may be a bit off-putting at first, but the meatiness of the filling and the fattiness of the soup works so well with the vinegar dipping sauce. Please, give this version of XLB a try, it'll definitely open your eyes to how diverse Chinese food can be, even down to regional differences of the same dish!\\n\\nThe cold dishes were all good. My favorite was the smoked fish. The smokiness of the fish mixed very well with the sweet sauce, and was quite balanced. There weren't that many bones in addition, so nice plus! The jelly pork took a bit of time for me to warm up to. At first, I thought, \\"This is just spam.\\", but eventually I started to get the appeal! The drunken chicken wasn't my thing, though. The wine taste was way too strong. On the contrary, though, my dad loved the chicken!\\n\\nMoving on, the lion's head. Oh, don't worry! It's not actually lion's head! It's a meatball. Erm, I mean, three FAT meatballs. They give a lot for this dish. The meatball isn't made of super finely minced meat, it's more chunky than a traditional meatball, and also has some vegetables in it. But does it really hit the spot! It soaks up the incredibly savory sauce like a sponge, and is just Chinese comfort food to the max. My parents loved this dish, and said that it was incredibly authentic to how it's normally made in China, so a big kudos for that!\\n\\nThe cabbage was, surprisingly, really delicious! It was just a head of napa cabbage in a sauce, but it really worked. It was almost like a soup, with the broth being the weird, goopy translucent sauce. But I'll have to admit, I would order it again! It's really hard to describe the flavor, but it's just good please get it!\\n\\nThis meal was only $65 once converted to USD, which is a ridiculously low price for the amount we got.

One of my friends raved about this place, and given the dearth of top-notch Cantonese places in ATL, we were quite curious.  \\n\\nWe were greeted and seated promptly, and since it was ~ 6:15PM, the place wasn't super crowded- about 1/3 full.  There is a rainbow-colored bilingual menu that they set in front of you (which is slightly hard on the eyes because it's harder to read the yellow and orange text), and then there are fluorescent-colored sheets of paper denoting various specials and daily fresh vegetables available all written in quasi-Chinese calligraphy.  For those of you don't know how to read Chinese characters...if you feel like taking a risk, you could take a shot in the dark and just point...heh.  J/K.  I'm sure the waiters would be glad to tell you what they meant.  Anyway, on to the food.\\n\\n1) Thousand year old egg and pork Congee- Wow.  I was pleasantly surprised by their rendition of this classic Cantonese dish.  The texture of the porridge was good- not watery- almost thick to a fault! :)  The pork strips were really thin- lots of care taken to cut it that way.  The flavor of the pork, the egg, strips of ginger, and the porridge all came together to make this a great starter.  Score: 4.5\\n\\n2) Spicy Eggplant \\"Casserole\\"- (Yu2 xiang1 qie2 zi0 bao3).  Served in a claypot, their rendition of this dish was solid- but didn't blow me away.  My gripe with this dish: JALAPENOS were used to spice it up.  :(  I'll be nice and give it a 3.5\\n\\n3) Salt and Pepper Squid- Whenever we go to Cantonese places, we try this dish out.  While the quality of the squid they used tasted very much like frozen packaged squid, I'll give them props for the way they flavored the squid, as I've never seen it done that way.  The squid was sprinkled heavily with fried, minced garlic and dried onions.  This saved the dish from mediocrity.  I was scooping up the leftover garlic/onion and eating it with more rice!  Score: 3.25\\n\\n4) Seafood fried noodles- This was the 'meh' dish of the night.  The noodles were pan fried for a light crispy outside, and covered with a white corn-starchy sauce along with squid, shrimp, scallops, and some mushrooms and a few pieces of mussels (surprised about mussels!)- all surrounded by greens (yu choy).  Very plain tasting dish- not bad...but nothing much to write about.  Score: 2.75\\n\\nWe got complimentary dessert, which was rather unique- it was a yam-flavored sweet soup with tapioca.  Usually you have a coconut milk-based soup with tapioca.  While my wife didn't really like it, I really liked the change of pace- an initially spicy/cinnamon type of taste, and then sweet.  Score: 3.25\\n\\nService here was terrific- atypical of Chinese places...and just about all our dishes came out within ~10 minutes!   Prices are reasonable too.  One last thing: the flavors here tend to be a bit lighter/less salty, which is welcome to folks like myself, but may be perceived as 'bland' by other folks who like to be blown away by Szechuan stuff.  Remember, this place is Cantonese.   Overall for food: 3.5 + great service = 4.  \\n\\nWe'll be coming here instead of Canton Cooks (besides, they're too far for us versus Wan Lai)."},{"name":"Houston's Restaurant","address":"3321 Lenox Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I go just for the Hawaiian Ribeye and the Crossiant French Dip, both are near the perfection mark.

My date barely could finish her food even though it was only potatoes and scrambled eggs, and I got through about half of my sandwich before I got full. However, I will say that they need to consider moving away from the brioche bun for their sandwiches.

The chicken overall was pretty good and cooked well. We also tried some fried green tomatoes and fried okra. Both were thickly breaded and good enough to order again, but not great enough to go out of our way for. The cole slaw was sweet and crisp but the beans tasted as if they came right out of a can.

They're working on securing a new distributor (lost the old dog) - I'm going to suggest Pine Street Market ;-)  Such a treat on a winter day.\\n\\nThe chicken salad is amazing.  It has more flavor than typical chicken salads do.  I think its the red pepper - the meat is all white and the mayo is perfect.  I love it.  It's really good on their toasted Ciabatta bread.  The So Delicious Ham & Cheese is the best hot sandwich with a yummy cranberry spread that add the perfect sweetness.  My husband has had the veggie sand - was not impressed.  The BLT is great.  I think the sandwiches are good.  This place is a bakery - their THING is dessert.  So don't expect your socks to be knocked off by the lunch menu.  They are pricey. Half sandwiches are available and a really nice offering - but again - EXPENSIVE.  And your only choice for a side item is a bag of chips which I never eat.  But I hear they are working on this.

Unfortunately they were sold out of the ribs so we chose the brisket and chicken for the two meat platter. Judging from what I saw someone else eat at a nearby table I don't think I missed out too much on the ribs. The platter came with average and simple coleslaw, beans and cornbread which doubled as a bit of dessert at the end as it was sweet with a lemony twist. You also get a side of potato salad, though we asked to sub the hot potato salad which they graciously did. I'm not sure if we chose the better of the two salads because the hot version was really average. If you like a good hot potato salad head to Earls (yes, Earls!) \\n\\nSo on to the meat. The brisket was ok. Had good flavour but some parts were too dry and others too fatty. I was disappointed because I love a good brisket.

The baked potato was filling and loaded. \\n\\nI really wouldn't rush back here. For a $25 platter I expected a bit more protein (we got one small chicken thigh and a few slices of brisket).  I also think they should've had more local beers on tap as opposed to your typical bar finds. Wine selection was small but had some good options. Staff was also friendly and prompt.

They provide free meals 3x a day, 7 days a week. Instead of the traditional cafeteria-style line up, BH seats each guest at a table and brings them a meal. The goal as I understand it is to preserve human dignity and make BH feel more like a restaurant. Every person has value regardless of mistakes they have made or hardships they have endured. I love that BH seems to understand this. I would recommend volunteering here on your lunch break as it is good for your own soul. Every time I volunteer I walk away feeling like I benefited far more than I gave.\\n\\nI spoke with a homeless person begging near some food carts and asked if I could buy him lunch. He replied: \\"oh I'm not hungry, there is plenty of free food in Portland. I need money so I can get off of the streets\\". This is a testament to the great work of organizations like BH. \\n\\nThis is another thing BH does well - helping homeless people get off of the streets. The establishment is run by both full time workers, part-time, and volunteers. Many of the full-time and part-time workers are transitioning out of homelessness and receive free housing while they work there. They also have a farm where transitioning folks with more needs are able to life away from the temptations of the city.\\n\\nDo you care about sustainability? Of course you do if you live in Portland. BH takes food waste out to their farm for the pigs.\\n\\n*Please note, I do not work for BH or represent it in any official capacity.

It's called Flower and Horse in Spring. It specializes in Yunnan Chinese cuisine with its most notable dish: Crossing the Bridge Rice noodle (guoqiao mixian). The names are pretty much translated from Chinese with Google Translate lol.\\n\\nThis restaurant is small and cozy with a lot of color Yunnan province decor. It wasn't very busy and easily got a table. Their menu has even more interesting names such as Holy Cow, Dream Come True, Soft and Smooth, Hardcore, and etc. Also, something of note, there's a minimum charge of $10/person. In other words, we weren't able to share one order of noodles! I don't like being forced to order something I didn't want and spend more money...\\n\\nWe ordered the Mushroom Delight Mixian. Each of the mixian comes with a bowl of soup in a super hot pot, and a bowl of rice noodles that was probably the dried variety of Lai Fun. Ours came with enoki, King Oyster, and shiitake mushrooms. It is served with twelve side dishes that will go into the bowl: quail egg, luncheon meat, fish fillet, marinated ground pork, tomato, carrot, bean sprouts, green onions, chives, bean curd sheets, Yunnan pickles, and corn.\\n\\nBe careful now as the bowl is really hot in order to cook the raw sides. The correct order to put the sides in is from raw to cooked, so the fish went in first, then the quail egg, and then after that is what vegetables needs more time first. In this case, it was the chives the everything else. Then plop the noodles on top, mix it around a minute or two, and you're ready to eat. It's basically a build your own noodle soup.\\n\\nThe broth was on the bland side for my taste, but the noodles were good and the ingredients used were good. It was a decent bowl of noodles with a homey feel.\\n\\nWe also had the Marinated Beef and Tripe in Spicy Sauce as we needed to cover the required $10/person minimum. This was nice and spicy! The beef and tripe were well prepared, and everything was flavorful and tasty. My wife thought it was too flavorful and too spicy.\\n\\nOverall, Crossing the Bridge to Flower and Horse in Spring for a Mushroom Delight was a decent experience. The staff was courteous and helpful, but I didn't appreciate being told that I didn't leave a tip immediately after I paid using my credit card. I was gonna pay cash tip. I thought all Chinese owned businesses love cold, hard cash! \\n\\nI haven't personally had Yunnan cuisine in China, but I've been told that this is how it's supposed to be and every place has their own style of broth. The noodles and ingredients used really felt like a home cooked meal though, and something I can do and probably make better.

Nothing exceptional, but still, for a spot close to home in downtown Portland, I was very happy. The restaurant itself was quite busy for a Sunday night, and we got a booth for 5 people. It was quite crammed, and the table wasn't properly cleaned. There was water and other stuff on the table as we were seated. In any case, this was minor, and all in all, this was a decent option."},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Was taken here by a friend who said this was one of the best Asian fusion places around and she was not wrong.  I love tapas places like this where you can try a little bit of everything, and that's exactly what we did.  I had my first taste of Bao here...ever.... and I'm hooked.  \\n\\nThe BBQ was all really good.  The noodle dishes were really tasty.  Tried Roti for the first time as well and I really enjoyed it.  Kept ordering more it was so addictive.  The sauce they came with was so good I wish I could just bottle it up and take it home.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was fun too.  The tables were lined with all these vintage news articles and photos of what I think was the family of the owner back in Asia.  \\n\\nThe desserts were really unique and kinda funky, but I liked that.  Some of them were an acquired taste for me but I appreciate places taking risks with their flavors. The Apple dessert was my favorite.\\n\\nI would absolutely come back here again and would highly recommend this place to anyone who even remotely likes Asian cuisine and loves trying a little bit of everything. Can't wait until my next visit!"},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I was not excited to try the Deschutes Brewery & Public House as have had their Mirror Pond Pale Ale before in bottles and never been impressed. I was totally wrong though. Stumbling upon their location in downtown Portland just when our group was in the mood for an afternoon beverage I split a sampler. \\n\\nThe sampler comes in at the affordable price of $6.50 and you can put any of the beers they have on tap in the sampler. Their menu also has the neat option of a couple of the offerings being offered both on nitro and standard taps (want to do a back-to-back nitro tasting of the Black Butte Porter). Tons of offerings, seasonals, and creativity on their beer menu. One of the stand outs was Le Cycliste, a German-style Radler (beer and lemonade mixture). I've never had a Radler before but this was a perfectly blended execution of this classic Bavarian drink."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We missed lunch so we decided to go for a beer and Happy Hour snack a couple hours before dinner. I had a nitro brew that was creamy and delish!  We shared their special sausage of the day over some fries.  The sausage was a Boar with apple cider vinegar combo and it was divine!  It took the edge off our hunger and was terrific.  Loved the vibe of the place, the community seating outside and the happy service.  My only complaint was that the fries were not hot, but it was also cool outside so it would have been difficult to keep them warm anyhow."},{"name":"The Lansdowne Pub","address":"9 Lansdowne St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Stopped in here for some drinks prior to going to a concert at Fenway. There were plenty of tables open but the host was hesitant to seat us unless we committed to ordering meals. After a bit of back and forth they agreed to seat us in the back area and we ordered drinks and some appetizers. A few people in our group came late and grabbed drinks at the bar before knowing we had table service, the wait staff/hosts made kind of a scene reprimanding us for this which seemed unnecessary. Okay place to stop for a drink before going into Fenway, but lots of rules."},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent dining experience. TC was our server and he was attentive and knowledgable...we ended up ordering dessert without even wanting it because his descriptions were so enticing.\\n \\nFor lunch we started with the Smoked Salmon appetizer, along with the Squash soup with pumpkin seeds and citrus foam, arugula salad with orange segments and parmesan shavings, the dish not on the menu-Fish tacos with a white bean salad, cilantro lime and guacamole on the side. Lastly a Grilled Salmon over spinach and spaghetti squash. \\n\\nI truly enjoyed every aspect of the meal, starting with a mimosa which was just a touch of fresh oj with pulp, I typically hate pulp but this was delicious! \\n  \\nThe salmon appetizer was probably my favorite part of our lunch. The goat cheese was gamey and had a nice punch of flavor. Salmon so tender and the potato hash stacks were crispy crunchy and seasoned just right. I loved the sour cream that had chives and tasted like lime. I split this with my Nana and sister but I ended up eating two pieces. \\n\\nWe had some tasty savory bread--sourdough was so soft and crust was great. My favorite was the chilli flatbread. It's a bit spicy but a soft crunch and crisp I couldn't stop munching on it!\\n\\nThe fish tacos were so fresh and tasty. The white bean salad had a slight red wine vinegar flavor that was cilantro and lime all day I enjoyed it very much. My grandmother ordered it after our server suggested it off menu.\\n\\nMy sister liked her salmon but wasn't a fan of the spinach and squash. The fish was fork tender and had a smoked wood smell so delicious!\\n\\nI had the soup and salad. I lived the warm soup, creamy and tasted like pumpkin and fall! Maybe a hint of nutmeg but very little spices, it was a very large portion so I didn't get to much of the salad which was also very large. \\n\\nI wasn't a fan of the Parmesan shavings on the arugula. It made it gritty a bit and the salad is wet from the dressing but it's tasty regardless.\\n\\nFor dessert I was coerced into getting a Chicolate Grotto with salted caramel, chocolate mousse inside and a hard dark chocolate shell, sprinkled with pretzel dust. My sister and Nana aren't into sweets much but wanted to watch me crack the shell with the back of my spoon so I ordered one.\\n\\nIt was divine! Didn't like the chocolate shell but I'm a milk chocolate lover, the mousse was absolutely delicious much lighter than I was anticipating and the caramel was the perfect touch!\\n\\n It was all in all a very well rounded sweet, I barely ate but a few bites but I have to have a little sweet to balance myself out!\\n \\nWill be back for that Rabbit and Swiss chard soon!"},{"name":"Nicli Antica Pizzeria","address":"3142 Highland Boulevard","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"We have gone to Nicli Antica Pizzeria in Gastown for years and loved the experience: the delicious pizza, friendly servers, vibrant atmosphere.

This place is very reminiscent of west side market in Cleveland. A bit smaller and set up more to buy ready-to-eat versus groceries to cook yourself at home. \\n\\nWe did some damage in the two hours or so we were there. Two of us got food at the Vietnamese storefront, the bahn mi chicken sandwich was great. One of us got a quinoa salad from Little Eater and one got hot chicken. I liked that they had tons of tables upstairs to eat there and just relax a little amongst the shopping, as west side market doesn't have that option.  We all enjoyed our lunch then got coffee from Staufs and a trio of Belgian waffles to go for dessert (plain was by far the best, and don't even bother with syrup. They're THAT sweet and flavorful solo.)\\n\\nDefinitely a cool place. There were many more stores I'd love to try, including Destination Donuts. Those things looked thick enough to bowl with!"},{"name":"Shanghai Morning","address":"4151 Hazelbridge Way, Unit 3200, Level 3","city":"Richmond","stars":"4","text":"Came here just for their pan-fried pork buns since I've heard so much about them. I'm happy that I went. The place is located in Aberdeen Centre's food court but all of their food is made to order so you will wait. It's worth it. The service is fast and the lady working the til is really friendly. I arrived just before 12 and by the time I left a huge line was forming. I've heard that wait times do go up to 20mins if there are a lot of orders.\\n\\nThe buns aren't like standard pan fried ones. They're pretty much really big xlb's, so watch out when you bite into them. There's quite a bit of hot soup inside. You get 5 buns per order for under $8. \\n\\nI'll definitely be back and I recommend arriving before lunch on a weekday. Aberdeen is always busy but after 12pm I find that there's a really long wait no matter which stall you order from and their parking lot becomes a nightmare to navigate. They also accept credit and debit unlike most stalls in the food court."},{"name":"Umi","address":"3050 Peachtree Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Service is terrible and the food is okay.
