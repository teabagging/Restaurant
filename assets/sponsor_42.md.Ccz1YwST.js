(I feel horrible I cannot place his name at the moment,) but anyone would know right away who I am talking about if you've been to the Clyde or have plans to drop in! Our bartender was patient, answered all of our questions, and gave us some of his own suggestions. I was intrigued right away by the \\"Bottled Broken Bike\\" on the top of their cocktail list. My first experience with a carbonated cocktail served in a cute little clear soda bottle. It now seems so simple, but such a brilliant idea and tastes wonderfully refreshing.

Round two: Nasturtium- Dolin Blanc vermouth, Domaine de Canton ginger liqeur, Bonal Gentian-Quina, and garnished with a lemon peel. Ingredients sounded good but the drink all together was a bit too sweet for my taste. It had to have been the Domaine de Canton ginger liqeur. I've had it since and again fell upon the same consensus. Too sweet for me. Like any good bartender or server would, I was asked how I liked my drink. I was honest and was not judged or given an annoyed look. Instead he asked me right away if I would like to try something different. Big thumbs up for me! Although I did not order another drink we decided to check out a different part of the menu: food. Fideos, scallops, squid, sausage, squid ink vinaigrette, and aoli. It was the first item our eyes gravitated to and I'm glad we went ahead and tried it. A good appetizer to wet our appetite for a fantastic meal we had afterwords at the Little Bird.\\n\\nOverall we were very satisfied with our experience and the only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because we waited quite a while for our fideos.

Really liked the timing between meals as they were not too fast after each other or too slow like other restaurants would do. The first dish was some sort of soup in an egg shell called uovo. Very tasty but the portion was a bit tiny. \\n\\nThe second dish was white asparagus. It looked cool but the taste is very similar to regular asparagus. The sauce that came with it was good. \\nThe third dish was crab in pasta. It was very good and the presentation was one of the best between our seven dishes.\\nThe fourth dish was prawn and was my favorite dish beside the the six dish (lamb)\\nThe fifth dish was octopus. The tail was fat and tasty. Finally the seventh dish was the souffl√© di tiramisu. A great way to end a meal.\\n\\nOverall really good food and the service was amazing.

They have an almost cult following. This, most likely, has very little to do with the absurd wait times or the tiny space they are in and more to do with the face that their biscuits are both flaky, soft, and incredibly delectable. \\n\\nI am usually not a fan of fried chicken, but here they make it amazingly tender, not too greasy, and with enough spicing in the batter to not just taste like dough. I had the McIsley, and it was really good...the astringency of the vinegar in the mustard and the pickles balanced oh so well with the sweetness of the honey, and all of those flavors just emphasized the awesomeness of the fried chicken! The collard greens as a side were very simple, but good. I tried a Reggie too and it was delicious as well, however they make their white gravy just a tad too sweet for me.\\n\\nMy friend and i had gone intending to sit down there, hoping against logic that we would get a table, but the place was a zoo packed with screaming kids and the wait line was so long some people were having to wait outside.

Any groups larger than 10 must choose from their available group dining options which feature semi-private and private dining options as well as 3 or 4-course pre-fixed menus. The menus start at $100 per person and they do not tell you what menu options you have until after you sign the contract. I found out that our menu items only added up to $75 even if our guests ordered the most expensive option on our pre-fixed menu. The difference you pay goes towards the culinary team and service? (Not sure as I didn't get a clear answer when I asked.) Despite the addtl 33% markup for group dining, which did not include gratuity, the service was mediocre at best. The entire process contacting the event manager was awful and at times took many emails/phone calls to get a response. I've hosted many group events at other fine dining restaurants in this wonderful city and never had an issue. They made me feel like a nuisance instead of a paying customer (which I'm sure they think that now since writing this review). To be fair, the dinner service was much better than the entire experience so I tipped accordingly. \\n\\nWith that said, the food is quite good and I'd be willing to return, but I wouldn't be ecstatic to go back.

As you can see by my 2016 photo just a small puff pastry was served with the majority of the food in a small crock.

Luckily since it was my bday our server brought me my own little dish of the grey stuff, compliments of the master.  Basically if you like mousse you will love the grey stuff.  His was put on top of a rectangular chocolate cookie, but I have seen looking at other pictures that it sometimes comes on top of a chocolate cupcake.  Either way both desserts were excellent!  \\n\\nIf I was not on the Disney Dining Plan I do not know if I would go here based on the price.  Yes, the food is good but maybe not compared to other food that you could pay a few less bucks for.  You are probably paying more for the experience of being in the castle than the food alone.\\n\\nDo not wander until you finish your meal.  You are allowed to look in the other rooms but it is better when you are all done your meal.  And after you wander you can make your way to the master's room to get a great picture with him.

So basically the service matches the European theme. \\n\\nFood was good, but not fantastic.  Certainly not worth the extraordinary prices...  $48 for what is supposedly a two-person paella, yet in reality is just slightly more than one portion.  Really?  $48?  A friend ordered the steak and he liked it.  Drinks were very pricey and my martini was not very well prepared.  Asked for olives and there was *one*.

Dinner for an adult is 12.99 which is pretty good for this type of place. Every buffet I have been to never had any additional charges for different types of food. There was always one price and anything you saw on the buffet tables was included. They charge you an additional $10.99 for crab legs. There is only 1 piece of paper where the crab legs are indicating that. When I saw the crab legs, I grabbed the tongs and took 1. Also, there was only one sheet of paper near the crab legs that said that it cost extra. On my side where I took it there was no sign. So I had no idea that it cost extra. They had the audacity to charge me for one crab leg.  ONE!! Later on my table received the check and they had indeed added the additional price to the tab. The man at the counter whom you go to to pay the check who may have been the manager was very unhelpful. I had described what happened nicely and all he said was \\"oops sorry\\". He disregarded everything I had said. Also, bathroom was gross. There was no soap in the women's bathroom.

Living in Boston for four years, I haven't found a pizza place that has really wow-ed me or made me salivate while dreaming of it for lunch. It wasn't until the people I babysit for brought home some extra pizza for me to munch on that I realized this may be the place I was looking for all these years.\\n\\nThe regular pizza is just fine, but you've got to try the Sicilian style pizza. The crust is incredible, the sauce is delicious, and while there is a good amount of cheese to get through, it still manages to be one of the best Sicilian slices I've ever had. The pizza is also light. You don't immediately feel like you are going to blow up when you shove in the extra slice, and you'll be full for a while. Another important thing to mention is that the leftovers are awesome. Sometimes left over pizza isn't nearly as good as it should be, but this is incredible. Even a little cold it's good. Delicious.\\n\\nCons? Really limited seating area, and they are a Pepsi based company. If you like Pepsi then I guess that's great for you, but as a Coke person, I have to subtract some overall points. In terms of seating, it's ok if you are going with two-four people, but anymore than that and you kind of risk the chance at being comfortable in a booth, assuming you're able to get one. Also - the girl serves aren't all that kind, but the dudes are not painful to look at. \\n\\nI definitely recommend this place for a Saturday or Sunday afternoon/night shopping on Newbury Street.

I highly recommend this restaurant if you're in the area.\\n\\nMy wife and I didn't have a reservation, however we were encouraged to take a seat at the bar if we didn't want to wait several hours for a table. While I normally don't like to sit at bars to eat, we decided to give it a shot anyway. We were seated at the bar and were immediately greeted by our server. She was very friendly and attentive throughout our dining experience as was everyone else that worked there. \\n\\nWe ordered a first round of drinks which consisted of a couple of beers. Very good. My wife then ordered a Cherry Fizz which was also very good. Their cocktail prices are somewhat high, however the quality of the drinks are quite superior. \\n\\nOur server explained that everything on the menu could be cooked to order as everything is made from scratch - which is a relief for me, personally, because I have some dietary restrictions.  We ordered the Risotto Fritters and the Wild Mushroom Pizza. The fritters were fabulous - creamy and delicious - served on a plate with some marinara sauce. The pizza, on the other hand, was pretty good, but my wife noted that it was a little too salty, was slightly over cooked and had way too many mushrooms. You would think the \\"too much mushrooms\\" would be a good thing, but since it was cooked a little too long, some of the mushrooms ended up being somewhat dried out.  We did like, however, that the pizza was served with some arugula which took some of the salty flavor away and added some depth to the flavor of the pizza. Overall we were very pleased with both of these items. \\n\\nFor dessert, we asked our server what she recommended and we went with it... Chocolate. Um, yeah. Delicious. The hazelnut gelato is made on site and is fantastic. Pairing that with the warm chocolate terrine was a fantastic idea. I highly recommend this dessert. \\n\\nWe will definitely be coming back next time we're in the area. It's a little pricey, but the quality of the food and service are what set this place apart from the other restaurants in the area."},{"name":"The Lion & Rose","address":"701 S Capital of Texas Hwy","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Nothing special.

When I asked the manager about my order, after asking around, she pointed to a dried piece of bread and open container of soup sitting on the kitchen counter and said that was my order. I waited 10 more minutes and my order just sat there, no avocado on the toast.

You can only order beforehand if you have a reservation through My Disney Experience. \\n\\nAll of the pictures on Yelp really helped narrow down the food options. I ordered the braised pork and my BF ordered the croque monsieur. My braised pork was delicious! The green beans were just a bit too soggy, but all of the pork flavor got absorbed by the green beans. Yum! Mashed potatoes were good too. The pork itself was just a little bit too salty, but still delicious. My bf was having a hard time choosing something since nothing really appealed to him. He ordered the Croque Monsieur since it was the closest to a grilled cheese. I also ordered the \\"grey stuff\\" cupcake, which is great since it's not too sweet. \\n\\nIn total for 2 beverages, 2 entrees, and 1 cupcake it came out to about $42. \\n\\nThe dining rooms are huge.

Friend had Rose and Pinot.  I had something Cabernet and Pinot.  Pinot was Cloudline (I think), which was good not great. For wine, I would go with the Cahors, which we switched to for our third glass and stuck with for the rest of the night.  \\n\\nFood -- The menu changes daily, so my advice as to what you should order and what you should not is probably not very helpful.  Among other items, we had the kumamoto oysters, which were excellent, and the duck, which was moist and tasteful, and the gingerbread cake, which was also moist and too overly sweet.  I would advise to steer away from the chick peas, which sounded interesting but were pretty boring. \\n\\nScene -- The scene at Clyde Common is vibrant.  The crowd was mixed as far as age is concerned, with the majority being in their twenties and thirties.  I suspect that most people there were affluent professionals.  It is attached to the Ace Hotel, which is pretty progressive but appears to draw a relatively well-to-do crowd.\\n\\nMost of the tables are communal - certainly nothing new - and the intended effect (forcing people to meet and mingle) appears to be working.\\n\\nAll in all, I think Clyde Common is a great place for a great meal.

Truly, that's the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars. On food and service alone, it's a 4 star experience. I had the fixed-price four course menu and, with the exception of dessert, it was quite good. The menu featured eggplant when I dined at Frasca, and it was delicious. The sformato was especially amazing; I'd never had a savory custard, an I could have eaten numerous servings. The pasta dish was also excellent and featured very fresh pasta and delicious cubes of eggplant. I had sea bass for the main course and it was fine; my dining partner made a better choice with the lamb. I'm not much of a dessert person, so feel free to ignore my opinion on it, but I had the chocolate cake with fresh peaches and it was too sweet, too dry, and the peaches were actually just tiny peach bits. \\n\\nThe food was very fresh, local, and obviously prepared with great skill. The waitstaff was wonderful, although it was strange to be waited on by at least 5 different servers. I went to Frasca with one dining partner. We each had half a glass of wine, the fixed price menu, and coffee. Total cost, including tax and tip: $220. That's too pricey; I've often paid less at the Flagstaff House, and that's a fancier (and tastier) experience.\\n\\nBottom line: If you want a fine dining experience, don't want to dress up (nice jeans seem perfectly acceptable at Frasca), and want to stay in downtown Boulder, go to Frasca. If you want a finer dining experience and don't mind dressing up, go to the Flagstaff House. \\n\\nFinal note: Frasca claims to have a parking lot. That's sort of true. A lot exists, but it's a 1 hour maximum before you get towed. Our dinner service took nearly 2 hours and we did not order the additional appetizers or linger over any of our courses. I wouldn't risk parking in the lot."},{"name":"Ah-Ma's Taiwanese Kitchen","address":"931 Monroe Dr, Ste A-108","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Just not for Chinese.

We did not want to travel too far so we decided to hit up Buckhead and in steps Smokebelly BBQ. We took a uber over and were dropped off in a very spacious parking lot (nice change of pace in Buckhead) and saw the bright lights of the restaurant. This joint has a great outdoors patio area if you are looking to sit outside but we opted to dine inside so took a step in. The d√©cor is simple enough with a nice bar setup and then a dining area with a live band playing. The music was fun and it seems like a good place to just relax and catch up with folks. \\n\\nWe were seated near the bar (obviously ) and did a quick peruse of the menu. After a few seconds we had all settled on the fact that we were going to order the delta double with two sides and of course a few beers to wash it all down. I decided to go with the brisket and pulled pork as my two protein choices with sides of mac and cheese and of course baked beans along with a solid IPA. The food did not take too long to come out and soon enough I was looking at a plateful of food. The Texas Toast was a touch on the side as it provided some carbs to soak up the beer. The mac and cheese was solid I would say... not the best by any means but it is just a side so no need to fuss. The baked beans were actually pretty delicious... I think they cook it with pork and I ended up killing the entire side. Now for the main event, I doused my plate with a few of the different sauces that were provided at the table and was ready to chow down. The pulled pork was solid and tender. Good flavor coming off of it and same with the Brisket. I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that both proteins were cooked well. The brisket had the perfect fat ratio to it so It was a delight. \\n\\nI would say this is a great option for BBQ especially if you are not too far from Buckhead.

We usually order take out and eat at home, but we have eaten in on a few occasions.\\n\\nFood quality: I'd say high-average. We order mostly maki sushi (rolls) and very little sashimi as that is not to my man's liking. I have had a few slices of sashimi and nigiri, they were fresh and no little land-mines of wasabi lurking underneath the fish in the nigiri. Occasionally we order things like gyoza or spicy chicken balls. The gyoza are nothing special, but their spicy chicken balls are delicious, and happily they are mostly chicken instead of mostly batter. Their tempura is also excellent. Their chef's recommendation rolls are pretty good but quite expensive. One star!\\n\\nService: this is a sticky one for me. On the one hand, they are always vey friendly to us (probably because we've been good customers) and polite, but when we've eaten in, they've been slow. They have also forgotten to include things we've ordered for takeout which can be a pain. They often will include freebies with our takeout orders, which is always appreciated.

The Milano is my go to.  Everything about their pizzas is yummy.  The crust has a delicious olive oil flavor that brings out the taste in a part of the pizza that most people throw out.  While they give you more cheese than competitors, it complements, as opposed to overpowers, the rest of the pizza.  When family comes to town, this is usually where we take them.  The service is attentive and accommodating of large groups.  The only complaint I can think of, is that their chicken in the Alfredo is a little bland.

The pork chop was large, tasty and juicy, but not very flavorful as I would have liked. He had the same delicious veggies and also had the Au Gratin Pasta which we both agreed stole the plate. He loved his meal, but agreed my steak trumped his pork chop, and said he wished they would have had a dish featuring the Au Gratin Pasta. For dessert I got the Strawberry Cream Cheese Cupcake, which was a Vanilla Sponge Cake, Strawberry Mousse Filling, with Cream Cheese Icing (3.99). I loved how light and fluffy the cake was, and the faint taste of Strawberry was, in my opinion, perfect. My boyfriend had the Chocolate Cream Puff\\nfilled with Chocolate Mousse topped with Whipped Cream(3.99). He loved it, but I am not a fan of Cream Puffs.

The line for the meats is usually the longest, but it moves rather quickly.\\n\\nI was on vacation and ready for some serious eating, so started with the meat line. Salmon, steak, chicken and our highlight: bobotie, a South African dish.\\n\\nBobotie is a curry-based meatloaf with egg and has an incredible taste.  Recommended.\\n\\nThe rest of the meat dishes were ok. Good meats, but nothing really stood out.  On our last visit, the carved steak was dry and overcooked and most people were hovered over the soup and hot sides.\\n\\nThe fufu is tasty, and is basically mashed yams.  I also had a red curry sauce that was excellent, I think it was the mater paneer or perhaps the chakalaka.  The Pap  (South African cornmeal mush) is also delicious.\\n\\nI looked at the salads and most were cous cous-based.  I usually avoid the salads, but they were quite good on my last visit. The seafood stew has been overlooked before, but I enjoyed it this time. The scallops were very tasty with the broth.\\n\\nThe desserts are quite good.  Boma has a nice spread of bite-sized goodies.  Boma is known for its Zebra Domes, and they are very tasty.  Note that there is alcohol in the domes.  I also enjoyed the Kenyan Coffee Tarts.  My daughters favorite was the cassava cakes...she even went back for more.  My wife likes the bread pudding, but it was too chocolatey on our latest visit.\\n\\nOne of the things I like about Boma is that they offer wine flights.  I have tried the red wine sampler and was able to taste a good variety of reds.  The last visit, I enjoyed a South African Syrah.\\n\\nI would normally give Boma 5 stars, but the meat on our last trip was a little lacking and I do remember the meats being better in the past.

You can hardly see the old fashioned doughnut through the fondant like look of lemon poppyseed icing the last two times I've been here.  I'll also add that the Hawthorne location gets less than 1/10th of the business the downtown location gets and I'm guessing the quality of the doughnut has something to do with it.

You see, as we walked up Belmont our ears were violated with the sound of just about every expletive known to man being spewed out of the inhabitant of the residence right next door to Pine State.  Her boyfriend/landlord (we couldn't tell, but it was really interesting) and her were having a passionate argument about property lines, \\"other girlfriends\\", and how he somehow trashed her car.  It was full of melodramatic threats of calling the police, and I think I even saw the crippled girlfriend wave a crutch in the guy's face.  The Pine State line was right in front of their house and the look on everyone's face was priceless.  For a minute we thought there must be cameras someplace, maybe this was a Portlandia skit happening right before our eyes.\\n\\nOk, now return to my fantasy.  What If this was her landlord...what if they were being evicted, what if Pine state was secretly vying for the property, what if they opened up more seating areas?  What if I didn't have to eat my beautiful delicious Reggie on the bench outside, and I could sit at a table and have my unlimited stump town coffee?  I secretly hoped the boyfriend was in fact her landlord and was kicking her out.  That's really bad, I know, but my Reggie was making me a little crazy.

It is difficult to convey how rude she was based upon body language and how she carried herself overall and of course, her tone of voice which was so disrespectful!\\n\\n\\nDear Nate Tilden and Matt Piacentini (Owners),\\nI wanted to write to let you know of a strange experience my family had at Clyde Common on Saturday August 22nd. Our family was going out for drinks to celebrate a birthday- there were eight of us. A few of us had heard how great your establishment was so we were excited to check it out. We came in at about 11 p.m. and ordered some drinks at the bar. We had never been there before but we saw people with drinks only lining the tables and no sign saying to wait to be seated or anything like that. No one else was waiting for a table so when one opened up we all sat down with our drinks. We were angrily approached by a server who informed us that we couldn't sit there. We were all confused, and she didn't explain what she meant very well, maybe because she was frustrated. After an awkward exchange, we finally figured out that the tables were for people eating and that we needed to order drinks from her. We were wanting a bite to eat so we would have loved to order also, but the situation was so uncomfortable and we were treated so badly that we figured we better move along. We asked if she wanted us to stand while we drank our drinks instead of taking up the table, to which she replied \\"no\\", but later told us to \\"do anything we wanted\\". She later got us water, and we said it was okay- we would just drink what we had and head out. I can promise you that we weren't rude to her (though it would have been easy to return the attitude), but we did not want to escalate the situation. However, this was obviously not a good thing to say as she said \\"I just doing my job\\" and stomped off with the glasses, possibly more annoyed and angry than before.  \\nI have worked in restaurants and customer service for years and so has much of my family. We are not a pretentious group, but when we do go out together we spend a lot of money and we love having great food, drinks, and of course, good service. Our backgrounds in the customer service and retail fields give us some insight. We know how it is to work with irritating people and how draining that can be! But this server was so out of line- I have never seen anything like it. She was so angry from the get go and so disrespectful I was rendered silent (something that never happens!). Our group was taken aback, and we honestly didn't know we were supposed to wait for a table or order from her because it was our first experience there- it was just a misunderstanding. She had even went to a coworker and pointed at our group while talking- obviously about us. Needless to say, no one else approached the table. It's just an unfortunate experience because the drinks were fantastic(!!!) but we wouldn't want to return based on this servers representation of your business. That night we went to Oba and Gilt club instead.

Just like any other bar in the theme parks, be ready to fork out some cash. A Bud Light was $6.50. They have a full bar and some pretty interesting cocktails. I was only there for a beer but I saw some interesting flourescent drinks head out the service bar. The downside is that it is quite small and very packed. As I mentioned before the area is shared with the waiting area for Prime Time Cafe so you'll find kids running around. It is hard to avoid giving that it is Disney.

We recalled our neighbor Chef Emmet Fox recommending Fino's patio during brunch as a great place for our little girl to run around. Being a hot day, they were equally willing to give her the run of the inside. Now, sophisticated child free readers, do NOT let this scare you off. This place is NO Chucky Cheese. It's a dynamite eating experience with a very laid back adult clientele. And they trusted us (rather than mandating us) not to ruin that for others. In my book, that says a lot.\\n\\nNow the brunch. It was perfecto. We had a Spanish tortilla (look it up) with heirloom tomatoes and a hash of short ribs and fries. The former had a wonderful olive oil and herb sauce and the latter....not that I'm surprised...black truffle oil.  After all, this IS one of Emmet's restaurants. The short ribs hash was very good and heavy as expected, but complemented the tortilla excellently.\\n\\nHad it not been a hot Sunday with work in the attic ahead of me I would have gone for the always tempting cocktails. But as it was, I was Teetotaling, so it was water and juice for me, for a memorable brunch.\\n\\nI think of Fino as the \\"big brother\\" of ASTI, but it's really a different beast altogether. It covers the Mediterranean more completely, which is a hugely ambitious goal. And maybe that is it's downfall at the end of the day. Having so many fancy options from all over the Med will, of course, tend to drive up prices and drive down the overall food experience. We recall an evening working through a selection of small plates and being impressed, particularly with a concoction involving dates. We then went for the gusto, ordering the  \\"Paella for two\\". This is where the beach ball suddenly started to go flat. We found it a case of having the right ingredients but not quite the right balance and execution. There was something in the chemistry that didn't quite allow this dish to dance. With the entrees we found ourselves asking: Is this really worth the price?\\n\\n\\nFino is  fortunate to have an elevated deck which doesn't look down upon total desolation. The parking lot is one of the better looking ones in town and the outdoor deck is well adorned.

The sweet skin of the tofu had been fried to a layerous wonderness, with soft silken tofu underneath. The negative? I wasn't able to experience it because the four pieces of tofu had been dunked in tofu broth. I know this dish is supposed to come with some broth/sauce, but NOT that much! Seriously, it might as well have been a soup.\\n\\nThe sushi boat was pretty good.

It was ambitious, but as this is typically a slower time of year, it seemed doable.  Well, first, apparently, there are no \\"slow\\" times of year anymore, but that is for another review.\\n\\nThis review is about a sit down dinner at Via Napoli in Italy at the Epcot World Showcase.  As we sat down, I expressed to my friend my biggest concern - that we will be rushed through this sit down dinner experience in order to maximize the table turn over and guest count.  I am pleased to say that this was not the case.  On a very busy visit, this was an oasis of calm and dining enjoyment.  Just what I needed on my last day!!\\n\\nTo start, we were lucky to get in.  Late the night before, I checked the Disney App to see if there were any reservations available - just by chance.  (My friend and I were shocked when we got together weeks before and looked at some of the dining places we wanted to try only to find that they were all booked up?  Really - booked months out?  Again, that is for another review.)  To our surprise, there was an opening at 3 PM.  Odd time to eat, but hey - we both had seen things about this restaurant and wanted to check it out.  So, we jumped on the reservation.\\n\\nWe arrived the required 10 minutes early and checked in.  We were immediately seated  at a two top.  While the tables are crammed in, again - maximizing space, it was not too bad.  We were greeted by both our waiter and busser within minutes of sitting.  We perused the menu and ordered drinks, asking or a few more minutes to review.  The waiter had no problems with this.  Eventually, we settled on sharing the Family Style House Salad (recommended at least 2 people share) and splitting a large Build Your Own Pizza.  Both were very good.  Not the best I've ever had, but definitely \\"hit the spot\\".  \\n\\nOverall, this was a great choice for us.  We did not feel like we were on an assembly line, service was attentive but not overly, and food was on point.  Prices were reasonable as well.  I'd definitely recommend a stop here for people looking for a break from the park!

I even ate as many of the chilies as I could tolerate; they tasted great, but I ended up leaving two-thirds of the chilies on the plate.....what a waste.

This is why it takes so long for your order. The end result is that it tastes like leftovers.

We chose this one based on good reviews on Yelp and also the area it was in - since it was on 82nd we thought it would be more of an authentic experience than one we might find closer in.\\nWe ordered three dishes:  the green papaya salad as an appetizer, the paneng curry (a go-to of mine), and a noodle dish featuring a \\"thai gravy\\" sauce that sounded too interesting to pass up.\\nThe papaya salad is something of a hallmark dish of mine - I try to order it at every Thai restaurant I go to to see how their preparation differs from others.  This one I did not particularly enjoy on first bite, not because it was bad necessarily, it was just different than the flavor that I usually encounter.  It had a very acidic, lime base, with not much to balance it out.  It was best when a peanut was also on the fork with the green papaya shreds - the mellow flavor of that was a great balance.  If there was another flavor in there that was more prevalent to balance out the acid, I think it would be excellent.  But for my tastes, it was too acidic but not necessarily \\"bad\\".\\nOur other two dishes were EXCELLENT.  The portions were huge - we could have easily split one.\\nThe paneng had a great variety of veggies including some unusual Thai eggplant I had never had before, the brown rice was cooked perfectly, and so was the tofu and other veggies.  The sauce was very flavorful, but a bit thinner than I like for curries.  Still tasty though.  \\nThe noodle dish (the name escapes me) was AWESOME and I had never had anything like the Thai Gravy sauce it featured, yet the flavor reminded me of other dishes I have had in the past.  The noodles were cooked perfectly and with the veggies, chicken, and that sauce, it just made for an excellent dish.  The veggies were excellent although I was surprised at how much celery was in there... I consider this more of a flavoring veggie and not so great for straight-up eating, but other than that, there was a good variety and we finished almost the whole thing.\\nThe service was great - a really sweet lady helped us out and joked around with us on how to describe the Thai gravy.  Hot tea was hot and flavorful, and the meal was extremely inexpensive... I don't think any of the dishes were more than $10.  We walked in about 40 minutes before closing on a Monday night so it was quiet, but there were still plenty of patrons and it had a nice ambiance.  It is decorated nicely and very clean.\\n\\nI would recommend this place to anyone in Portland for good Thai food that is a bit out of the mainstream places in town.  I would definitely go back to try other dishes."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"The food was beyond our expectations, the restaurant was very clean, and it was beautiful inside.

My date wanted a comfy place to chat and thought this would be it. \\n\\nNot.\\n\\nNow the first thing to say is they were pretty busy. I'm not sure if that's because other people like them and I just don't, or they're one of the few options open on a Sunday afternoon, or what, so even though there was no waiting for a table, they do seem to do business.\\n\\nThe first impression I get walking in though is this place stinks. As in, it smells. It has that musty old the carpets-should-have-been-removed-years-ago stink you find in so many bad rental houses around Austin. It just stinks.\\n\\nOur hostess said the upstairs was not open on Sunday which was a little strange because the downstairs was pretty full, but whatever. There is a nice patio outside but it sits adjacent to Burnet Rd so you'll get street noise and no view because of the high fence. We opted for a booth.\\n\\nAnother strange element at least at the Burnet Rd location is the noise. I'm not sure what design functions play into this, but its just a loud place. You'll overhear a constant buzz of noise from conversations and its really not a cool vibe for relaxing (as my date had mistakenly thought.)\\n\\nThe happy hour pricing is good and I have to say (hence the reason for two stars instead of just one) the chips were thin, crispy and delicious and the red salsa was very good. Oddly, they serve the salsa in very small dishes and will only grudgingly refill them.\\n\\nServers and hostess were prototypical Austin slackers: not really into greeting or helping you and not really caring whether you knew it or not. Trudy's can't be blamed for this however - this is outright a pure Austin thing. Very hard to get good service at many many places.\\n\\nFinally, my date commented on how dirty the windows were and it was true. For whatever reason there were a number of handprints all overt the window at our booth.

I had ketchup and pickle (love that they slice 'em using the same machine for the fries, so they're like crinkle cut pickle chips instead of slices), so I could really taste the beef, and it was juicy and tender. As others have said, it's cooked more medium well than plain medium, but it's *just* this side of medium, and unless you're a diehard for a pink center, you're still going to get juicy burger flavor much more than the near-hockey puck that I associate with well done. Buns are fresh, too... I'd call it the equivalent of Dan's or Fuddrucker's in terms of fresh and tasty, and certainly equal to either in portions... I got the 1/4 lb. Junior, the 1/2 lb. would have been too much.\\n\\nI love thinner fries, so I dug the mass of crinkle cut potatoes. I will say, though, that with four grown-ups and one five-year-old at the table, we could easily have all managed with one (mayyybe two) orders of fries. For $1.35, you get a gigantic mass of fries. Oh, and bonus points for having pepper on the table along with the salt, which made for perfect fry seasoning.\\n\\nAlso had a chocolate shake, and it was very good, smooth and well-mixed. Not the best chocolate shake I've ever had, definitely not a malt as it has a thinner (but not too thin) consistency, but a very good shake.\\n\\nFour stars instead of five because of the pretty pared-down menu and low-variety toppings offered, but if you're in the mood for a good burger, fries or a shake, these guys know what they're doing.

I still have no idea why we had such trouble with the reservation system.\\n\\nI'm glad we got in because the restaurant is gorgeous. It is quick service during lunch and a rather small menu to choose from. I ordered the turkey baguette sandwich. It's sounds rather boring but it was phenomenal.

The cup of orange juice I ordered was only about 8ish ounces... so that didn't help with the dryness for very long, especially since by the time we actually got our food, a whole 45 minutes after ordering, I had about 2 sips left in my cup. No way could I get back in line to order another... I'd be waiting for another 30 minutes! And trying to fight through the crowd of people to get up to the water container... forget about it.  \\n\\nThere's about 4 tables in the joint and about 40 customers... LUCKILY we were able to greedily grab a table as someone else was getting up. but the place is far too small for as many people as they're trying to make happy.  I guess that's part of it's charm?

It was soooo delicious wrapped around a thin slice of beef.\\n\\nThe namesake of this place is kind of at odds with the actual atmosphere, it was bustling with activity and loud conversations, not peaceful at all. But the busyness can be seen as a mark of a good restaurant. We came at just the right time because we got seated right away. As soon as we got our table, there was a few groups that had to wait at the door.\\n\\nAs for the service, I thought it was good! The waitress gave us other suggestions for a dish that we had originally wanted but they didn't have available at the time.

Maybe it's changed, it's been a while. I'll never forget my most memorable time here. It was a hot Austin summer day. Me and a friend had vowed one day we would get to Austin, I never did (New Orleans instead). He made it! I was pretty happy to have an Austin hookup. W was trying to make it in the film business. In a way he did winning a script writing pitch contest that got him Robert Rodriguez's agent. He he never found a deal for his zombie flick that he liked, but made some contacts and did pretty well up in New York producing video games while his girl went to film school. He later bopped on down to San Fran, but still longs for Brooklyn. All that aside we were young and fresh out of college waiting for the world to stand up on our doorsteps. I'd go on to law school he'd go on to video games. I made a drive from DFW down there just to see Austin. It was my last day and it was always the same. I get a little pang in my heart when I leave and see it dissipating along that ole faithful drug mule I-35. \\n\\nMangia's was a pretty good pizza. It's difficult to find a good slice of deep dish anywhere in this Republic of Texas, lol, jk. I mean it's definitely unique and privately owned and has grown over the years. My review is based on eating there a few years ago, but I will be getting to Austin pretty regular now that I live back in Texas, and I will see what all this three star two star stuff is about. My, let's hope the mighty have not fallen. \\n\\nI remember the staff to be pretty mediocre, not overly friendly but not jerks. They had a decent beer selection. The outdoor patio if I can remember had a lot of metal incorporated into it. It was great just to watch cars go by and have a conversation with friends. The deep dish pizza was tasty. I remember the gooey cheese, fresh toppings, and piquant sauce. I remember eating it with a knife which is not uncommon when it comes to deep dish Chicago style pizza. The cheesy bread had a nice flavorful mozzarella that made it irresistible."},{"name":"Buk Kyung II","address":"151 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"3.5","text":"When I was drunk and hungry during the Sparhawk Liquid Urban Tour, the alcohol-less Buk Kyung sobered me up quickly.

Seemed silly to me. \\n\\nNext, like anything else in Disney, you wait in a line. Order your food via a cafeteria style lunch lady, though the food is delivered to your table via waitstaff besides self serve soft drinks.\\n\\nFood: mediocre. I got the veggie quiche for roughly $13. It could have been warmer. My wife's turkey sandwich (~$16) was nothing to write home about - it was carved turkey on a ciabatta bun that seemed heavily buttered with garlic butter or something on the inside. Fries were standard Disney fries, which is to say, they are fairly standard, thin, crunchy fries. My salad that came with the quiche was very good, topped with raspberries that blended perfectly with the bitter leaves and slightly sour dressing. \\n\\n\\n Inside? It's first come first serve self seating. The three rooms are depictions of 3 major rooms in the \\"Beast's\\" castle from \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" the West Wing, the Ballroom, and some other room whose name escapes me. They are all a dimly lit, which, does create a bit of an ambiance, but it doesn't quite work with the noise, hustle and bustle of the lunchtime rush - lots of people talking, kids crying, recorded music playing, dishes and silverware clanking, etc. It seemed a bit too dim, especially in the ballroom. It's probably nicer for dinner. \\n\\nIt's a cool theme, and the prices aren't insane for Disney, but they aren't good either. A $16 turkey sandwich is stupid price, especially when there's no live entertainment in the restaurant.

The location was fabulous, and the view of the multi-colored fountain at night from our table was simply spectacular.  We ordered the spinach dip that came with the pita bread and an order of sushi roll (not sure what kind) .  Not a regular sushi eater i was impressed by the rolls, they were pretty good but not so much by the dip.  I'd tasted much better ant chain restaurante, like Chilis and Applebee's.  We also ordered the standard burger, which , like the dip, nothing to write home about.  My only guess is they charge what they do for the food that they serve is because of the location.  It was the only thing excellent about our dining experience.  The service was marginal at best.  Our server was very nice but never offered me a refil on my iced tea at all during meal although I finished my tea before we completed the appitizer.  In fact my partner received a third glass of wine before I had requested a refill on the tea. Maybe  it because the wine was $9 a glass and tea was free.....I hope not.  To me the worst thing was the server who was sweeping the floor around our table while we consumed our appitizers, YUCK.

The split spicy / normal broth was perfect for me and my wife-- I generally prefer spicier food and we like to share, so it's rare that a dish meets both of these needs.   Both types of broth were uniquely flavorful, with enough subtlety that I felt like I was discovering new aspects of them throughout the meal.

The interior was small, clean, well lit, and highlighted by a large glass counter, open displays of donuts of unique colors and flavors, and small high tables along the perimeter. Like the ongoing rain, both the line and foot traffic was intermittent. They use a brioche recipe, rice oil, and local organic products to insist on the highest quality possible.\\n\\nEach donut ranges from $2.25 to $3, the highest I had ever paid for these tasty treats. We started off with the Raspberry Cake Donut ($2.25) that came with shaved pistachio, and refined raspberry flavor that served as catalyst that coupled a secondary buttermilk aroma. The cake donut was easy to cut into, and each bite consisted of a noticeable crispy outer layer that ended with a soft cake-like center in the middle. This was my favorite of the three we tried. \\n\\nMy next favorite was the Blueberry Bourbon Basil ($2.75) that came with smooth, refined blueberry bourbon basil covering a lighter, soft, and fluffy yeast donut. The blueberry flavor was not too sweet, deepened by a hint of basil in the backdrop, but the taste of bourbon was lacking for those who are intrigued. The yeast donut was not the best I've had. At this price, the donut itself has to consist a light, melt-in-you-mouth quality in order for me to highly recommend it.\\n\\nMy least favorite was the Lemon Curd Donut ($3) that came with thick lemon custard stuffed in the middle of a powder-sugared yeast donut. The lemon flavor was very refined, not too sweet or tart, but a great balance of flavors. Unfortunately, the downside of this donut was the rubbery chewy texture that didn't meet my expectations. I don't recommend it.\\n\\nService was friendly, but she didn't make any particular recommendations that were useful to us.

Bacon makes everything better.  But Consuelo's no one-trick pony.  Tortillas, another pillar of Mexican food, are homemade and fantastic.  Both flour and corn versions were fresh and tasty, perhaps the products of recipes and techniques passed down from generation to generation or maybe off the back of box of masa harina (Consuelo was busy, so I didn't get the chance to ask).  Either way, they're delicious.  You could make a meal out of both, but you don't have to.\\n\\nOur breakfast/brunch visit started with the queso, and this was a good entry.

It was lighter than ice cream and didn't upset my stomach like ice cream does (I took my requisite Lactaid before I ate it due to lactose intolerance).\\n\\nThe only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I did not see any prices posted so I can't assess the 'value,' per se.

It was for a special occasion and I am sorry to say I don't think I will be back. I loved it the first time and consider myself a foodie so I was very excited to return. This experience was very disappointing to say the least. \\nWe had a party of seven people and Frasca was featuring a 4-course prix fix holiday menu for $82pp which seemed like a pretty good deal. However, the devil was in the details, their \\"Holiday menu\\" was easily the MOST confusing menu I have ever tried to decipher. It literally took the server about 15 minutes to explain it to the table. The confusion was largely due to the fact that most of the items had so many up-charges and minimum orders for the table that no one could make sense of it. This would probably be fine if you had a party of two or three. But during the holidays people usually dine in larger numbers so this menu was totally inappropriate. One of the entr√©e items was a veal chop, served for a minimum of 2 people with an up-charge of $75pp . Translation: $150 up-charge. So why not just put that on the menu? I'll tell you why... because $150 is a ridiculous up-charge for anything - even Veal Chop. If you have to charge that much DON'T PUT IT ON A PRIX FIX MENU. \\nMy \\"primi\\" course  (two house made ravioli) was actually very good. The serving size seemed appropriate but it twice the size of my \\"secondi\\" (the entree), the guinea hen, was literally three bites. \\nAlso before we were even served our drinks, we were given abnormally large pieces of fresh bread. The bread was very good however one piece of bread was about twice the size of any on of the courses served on the menu. We all got the distinct impression that they wanted you to eat loaves of bread and have a taste of their super expensive tasting menu. While our meal was very well prepared and the flavors pleasant, the coordination required for ordering and the ridiculous up-charges for the whole table made the overall experience seem like lot of work and NOT a relaxing dinner out.

It's the best dish that I've tried there that is pescetarian friendly and is pretty much the only thing I eat when I go now.\\n\\nIf it weren't for the family hook ups, I probably wouldn't eat here at all because for the price you pay, you could definitely go somewhere better.  On the other hand, it's very convenient being inside the Pru and the service is cafeteria style so the food is prepared quickly.

This sushi cart has proved themselves to me. I am now, definitely, a believer. In fact, I'd go so far as to say this is my favorite food cart in Portland. And that is saying A LOT. \\n\\nHere's why this place rocks:\\n1. Fantastic food. I have yet to try something I do not like. The sushi has never, ever disappointed me. I am hugely partial to the tempura asparagus, tempura tofu and tempura eggplant rolls (sensing a theme here. Why does fried sound so much healthier in Japanese?) But they aren't just masters at sushi. Their ever-changing specials menu recently offered tempura eggplant tacos. Those babies need to become a permanent fixture on the menu. I'm not even a huge eggplant fan, but whatever they did to that eggplant made it out of this world taste-tacular. So incredibly delicious. Perhaps not as perfect as the tacos, but still quite good was the tofu balls which are served with a tastebud slammin' lime soy sauce. Perfect for a rainy day is the Tofu Katsu- I dub it Japanese soul food! Their entrees are served with rice and salad. The salads have this fantastic asian style dressing which makes me melt. And while I am a vegetarian, my meat-eating friends say the meaty options do not disappoint. I've heard particularly positive raves about the Happy Cabbage and the Fish Tacos. \\n\\n2. Fantastic menu. The permanent menu offers lots of choices for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. However, there is also a specials menu which frequently changes and always has one or two vegetarian options. I've found the real gems of Zenbu to be located on the specials menu. The guys running this cart are food geniuses and are always creating dishes that are beautiful in both aesthetics and taste.  \\n\\n3. The chefs are incredibly friendly and accommodating. It's always great to see their friendly faces! They have generously let me taste-test some of their more unusual fare and never raise an eyebrow when I start raiding their candy jar! Also, upon request they will create off-the-menu sushi items. These chefs are brilliantly creative and their off-the-cuff sushicreations have never once disappointed. \\n\\n4. There is outdoor seating next to the trailer which includes a covered area to keep you dry from Portland's wicked weather ways. \\n\\nIn summation, this place is wonderful.

How dare he?!?  They brew the beer right there and it's awesome!  Thus begins the downward spiral of the night.  We were there on a night they did trivia and we decided to stick around for it even though both of us admitted to being horrible at trivia.  The conversation was seriously lacking, I had a miserable time, and to top it allllll off, the \\"goodnight kiss/makeout session\\" ended with him burping in my mouth.  I didn't order the kobe beef meatloaf, and I was pretty pissed off that I was forced to try it anyways:(   Yes, you may proceed to gag and run to the bathroom now, but I implore you to keep reading.\\n\\nTrust me when I say that I have more than a few disaster date stories.  This one was probably the worst.  That being said, months later and despite the trauma that I had endured on my last visit, I went back to Watch City Brewing and had a great time.

The food:  the fried chicken was cooked perfectly--juicy on the inside and crisp on the outside--and the coating had a really great flavor.  The smothered rib meat was tender and had a great flavor.  The yellow rice I chose with it was subtly flavored and very nice.  The beef stew was very tender and yet not at all dry and it had a great flavor. The collard greens were wonderful.  Although I'm used to them having pork, Nikki told me she and her father decided not to make them with pork so that vegetarians could eat there.  What was so cool is the greens had a really great flavor--they were slightly spicy and also had a slight sweetness.  They didn't have the smokey flavor you have if pork is added, but I didn't miss it at all.   The candied yams were so great--sweet yet they had many layers of flavor--I sensed a hint of ginger, lemon, cloves, brown sugar and nutmeg--but those are all just my guesses.   The yams were sweet but not too sweet.  The rutabagas were also wonderful.  They're boiled and yet they have a lot of flavor--loved them!

The bf and I are beer lovers, so we were excited to try this place out.  The beer did not disappoint.  I started off with the Shillelagh Irish Red that they have....amazing!  It's a nitro beer, so there's a creamy head on it like Guinness....really smooth beer and great taste.  All of the beers that we tried (4) were really impressive.  Sadly their website doesn't say if they sell kegs...\\n\\nService was really good.  Got our meal literally the second we finished our appetizer, and although she forgot my pickles initially she rushed them over with apologies when she remembered.  Kudos waitress.\\n\\nNachos were atypical and more like a dip.  Beans and tons of cheese cooked and then topped with jalepenos, salsa, and sour cream.  Basket of chips on the side.  I was apprehensive at first (being a self-proclaimed nacho connoisseur) but they were actually quite good.  Maybe a bit steep in price at $9.99 BUT with how good the beer was, I was happy to support the establishment.  \\n\\nThe only problem that I had with my lunch there today was that the chips were a bit stale.  Otherwise, great time.\\n\\nHighly recommend the beer.  I recently read that 80% of all boating accidents involve alcohol.

Just ordered a paneer makhani and saag paneer to go and came home to eat it. I was taken aback at the tiny cups that the portions came in considering the $6 charge and then find that the paneer makhani has just FOUR pieces (1 inch cubes) of paneer in it and the saag paneer has only THREE?!?! So I paid $12 + tax for SEVEN pieces of paneer? Ridiculous. I will NOT be ordering from here again, I am a small time caterer myself so I know how much things cost and how long they take to make and this restaurant must be making 400% profit on its charges because of these measly portions. Do NOT eat here if you want value for money. Nobody should have to pay $6 for a bowl of spiced tomato sauce.

The casualness of placing your order fast food style at a counter, belies the quality of the food they produce.  Don't be thrown off if you see a line - it moves pretty quickly.\\n\\nI'm usually there at lunch with a group and the menu offers something for everyone, from killer salads to panini sandwiches to heartier entrees, plus soups and what they call outside the box burgers - a tuna burger, a black bean burger and a bison burger.  What I like is that many of the entrees are available in a ¬æ size and salads come in a half size when paired with soup.  And most of the appetizers are downsized versions of entr√©e offerings.  There's something for any level of appetite and it's a great menu for exploring.\\n\\nSalads are served on long colorful plates and range the gamut from Southwestern to Mediterranean to Asian to Caesar.  Each comes with a suggested dressing (and protein add on like grilled chicken, shrimp, tofu, salmon, steak, calamari), but I've enjoyed mixing and matching dressings with salads and my absolute favorite is the ginger apricot vinaigrette.  I was bummed to discover the fig and blue cheese salad was a seasonal item and no longer on the menu.\\n\\nWith the chill in the air this weekend, I tried the lentil soup - awesomely good. \\n\\nI'm pretty stuck on my go to entrees, the almond chicken skewers and the grilled prime steak medallions.  As a side, the garlic jack grit cake is so good and pretty unique.  I can't vouch for the other entrees, but I've never had anything bad here.\\n\\nI also like that they've got a gazillion drink options.  No, not one of those Freestyle Coke machines, but two or three flavors of fresh made lemonade, several fresh brewed flavored sweet and unsweetened teas, plus lots of specialty bottled water, juice and soda options.  \\n\\nThere's lots of good food at F2O.

I was skeptical that he was the manager, but he said he was - he was the rudest manager I have ever dealt with.  I was so infuriated with my experience, that I wanted to contact the corporate office.  The website had NO mechanism to report issues - which is ridiculous.  Then, I contacted them on facebook.

Honestly, Mexican food is not complicated, but you want a nice atmosphere and experience.  This location's El Vaquero was an epic fail.

The broth was tasty, the beef was cut just right, and the noodles had a nice texture and consistency.  The prices were very reasonable, too; pho is usually cheap but at Pho Jasmine I think I paid less than I usually do even at other Vietnamese restaurants.  I did find the portion to be a bit small, though.  I would have gladly paid another dollar or two for a bigger bowl, but I didn't see an option for that on the menu."},{"name":"Mike and Lill's Black Sheep Pub & Grill","address":"5 Central St, the other day","city":"Peabody","stars":"4","text":"Took my wife, children and father in law to try this new resturaunt in Peabody square last night.

Their barn on West Fifth, their shack in Linworth, and their cathedral in the East were among the places I enjoyed until the slaughterhouse of the 2008 economic meltdown butchered those locations to scrap. But Hoggy's hasn't completely went to hog heaven just yet; remaining is this joint, a red brick building crossed with the Italian kitchen Johnny \\nBuccelli's that functions as the hub for their catering biz.\\n\\nThe hybrid shares its parent's looks in this way: the outside looks the Italian causal of Johnny B, and the inside is Hoggy's country hoke. I am not sure if they ever serve you at the table but the afternoon I came the process was order at the counter, served at the table. \\n\\nBeen awhile since I had either JB or Hoggy's. I ordered off the BBQ menu so the review will be rated on that and not reflective of its Italian themed servings. \\n\\nI ordered Three Little Piggies, a misnomer, for it's actually cow, chicken, pig--a brisket, pulled pork, and pulled chicken sliders with two choices of sides of which I selected fries and mac & cheese. At $11.95 the meal brings BBQ variety, quantity, and quality to make an outstanding meal. Of the three brisket is the weakest. Still good, and flavorful, I found it a bit too stringy.  The pulled pork and chicken are excellent. Each are dressed in different sauces that jump out at you. The chicken, it seems to me, is dressed spicier. For side the fries were standard and the Mac was drowning in cheese; it came with a thick cheese cap and less pasta than you'd think. But for a simple side it does the job. \\n\\nIn the end it was the Hoggy's I remember. Not super authentic, best in the city, nor some candidate for an Esquire story like the truck on Ramlow Alley. But it's much better than many BBQ houses. It makes a quick meal in an informal setting that is still pretty good."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"It's OK.\\n\\nI don't know...\\n\\nIt's nice.\\n\\nI don't know....\\nWe had dinner here one night, and a lunch here a few days later.\\n\\nWe were excited for dinner since we had heard such great things about BOG.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is great inside Beast's Castle.

After asking him to repeat what he was asking three times, I realized he was asking if we'd like water, which we did.  Awesome start.\\n\\nWe then waited 25 minutes for our waiter to come by for the first time and take our order.  I got the Tortelloni and my girlfriend got the Chicken Milanese.  Now over 40 minutes into our meal, we haven't received any bread.  What was most annoying was the couple next to us that arrived about 20 minutes after us had already received bread.  That's great.  Eventually the bread does come and it tastes better than it really is since it's 10:00 at this point and neither of us ate anything since an early lunch.  \\n\\nThen comes the entrees.  I'm absolutely horrified at the sight of my $20 entree.  It's 5 or 6 tortellonis and they are residing in what appears to be a deep pool of broth.  I would've expected a sauce or something, but they come in this broth that makes it look like it's a soup.  Combined with the tortellonis are some of the most random items like half tomoatoes and green beans.  They do not mesh with the tortelloni at ALL and more importantly, the broth is overly salty and practically tasteless.  I really have no idea why it is even there.  The tortelloni itself was pretty tasty.  Unfortunately it was gone in about 5 or 6 bites... And that's what I paid $20 dollars for.\\n\\nMy girlfriend's Chicken Milanese looks a bit more hearty.  It comes in a huge plate with 2 big chicken breasts.  I'm pretty jealous.  She takes one bite and she tells me she doesn't like it... This is a first.  Every time we've eaten out, she's said what she has eaten is at least good.  I'm a bit taken aback.  She tells me the chicken is extremely dry.  She's right, it is.  The real kicker is that she usually eats all of the food that I make without any sauce... So this chicken must have been REALLY incredibly dry for her to make a comment like that.  Anyway, she eats about half of it.  Obviously, I eat my entire entree.  It's funny, I think there is an appetizer portion of my entree available.  Could they have sent me that?\\n\\nOh, and not to mention.  It's very loud in here.  The seating is all in one giant room and there is awful music playing fairly loudly as well.

It could be because of the kitchen, or your server. On a slow Wednesday night, I was missing sour cream n chives, because the server didn't garnish the meal. My toast was buttered, not dry, because the kitchen missed the detail. My wife's meal was delivered in pieces. First the pancakes arrived, then the fruit dish, later followed  by eggs & bacon. We hate not having a complete meal. Like when they take your steak for a re-cook, and leave you with just a baked potato. The restaurant was clean. The staff was very friendly. The manager had already re-ordered the toast, and was collecting the rest of her order when he noticed the  mistake. He was very apologetic about the details. We will return.

This experience was bad enough that it has prompted me to sign up for Yelp and post my first review. You know a dining experience is bad when it motivates you to download an app and pen a short essay to the world!!\\n\\nTHE GOOD: first off, our waiter and his trainee were very friendly and pleasant but unfortunately smiles and friendliness could not make up for the terrible service.\\n\\nI ordered the fried scallops and clam plate and it was decent but nothing special. My wife said her lobster roll was fairly good. Those are the only halfway decent things I can say about the black lobster.\\n\\nTHE BAD: As others previously mentioned the waitstaff appeared to be a complete mess. Things were very disorganized and extremely slow. Our waiter did not put in our meal order until 20 to 30 minutes after we ordered and acknowledged this with an apology. Keep in mind, there were only two other tables when we got here. We waited a long time for drinks even though our two waiters continually walked past us without acknowledging our empty glasses. Even after asking for more drinks our promised drinks took a LONG time to materialize.  When we finally got additional drinks our old glasses were not cleared from the table and neither were our menus after ordering. I know this may seem small but there was no attention to detail from this staff and there appeared to be no management or supervision in sight throughout our entire meal.  Questions regarding the menu could not be answered and not much of an effort was made to get answers for us.\\n\\nThe clam chowder was, without a doubt, the worst I've ever had. My wife and I immediately thought it tasted extremely odd and very off in flavor. My wife commented to me that it tasted like mildew smells! My initial guess was that the odd flavor was from nutmeg and/or tarragon. After reading some other reviews, nutmeg appears to be the culprit. Even with the extremely odd flavor profile aside, there was very little substance in the chowder and usually I prefer my chowder to have some clams and potatoes. This was more like a nutmeg flavored warm milk .... GROSS! The only good thing about the chowder was the prepackaged little oyster crackers that I put in it!\\n\\nThe table \\"bucket\\" that housed the salt, paper and napkins was dirty with crud and ketchup splashed onto it like a Jackson Pollock painting! Needless to say, this gave me the impression of a dirty establishment.\\n\\nWe did not get silverware and napkins and at one point needed to clear our own table of junk, menus, glasses etc so we could have some room. My wife deserved a bigger tip than our waiters! \\n\\nTHE UGLY:  At the completion of this meal I needed a quick shot of Patrone to kill the clam chowder nutmeg flavor (Afterall it wasn't thanksgiving and I was not in the mood for pumpkin pie). I also wanted to begin the process of inebriating myself in the hopes of forgetting this less than pleasant experience. We went to the bar and waited for 10 mins with no bartender in sight. Other patrons were sitting around with empty glasses and frustrated looks as well.  Here is the ugly part ... While waiting we witnessed a liquid dripping from the ceiling in the area of the air conditioning vent. This would drip almost to a steady stream for about 5-10 seconds every minute or so.  This mystery ceiling duct liquid was falling on the area where drinks are placed while waiting for waitstaff to retrieve them for the table customers. In other words, when drinks are here they are being garnished with some special a/c duct juice condensation!!  It was also dripping into the drink garnish tray. This was extremely disgusting and made me wonder what the kitchen was like if the front of the house was in such disarray! \\n\\nNeedless to say, we will never go back to the Black Lobster."},{"name":"The Consulate","address":"10 10th St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The food was fantastic.

I got the mafioso steak and was very happy with it. Although not the best piece of steak I've had, 12oz, it was covered in cheese, bell peppers, i think some prosciutto and a red sauce that went great together. Both came with a side of pasta. All the sauces were delicious and the bread was perfect. A nice crunchy crust and fresh soft breading. Portions were big. I usually finish my plate 99.9% of the time and finish off the girlfriends.

I don't expect cashiers to be overjoyed or even enthusiastic about taking my order, but the girl who took mine was barely awake. I was also disappointed to see that my sandwich was not made to order (which would take seconds) but had been pre-made, wrapped in Saran and placed in a refrigerated area, making the tougher style bread even harder to chew. My boyfriend's made-to-order chicken sandwich was delicious and 25 cents cheaper than my cafeteria style sandwich!!! \\n\\nOn to the drinks. For decaf, they only offer Americanos, which is a growing annoyance in our fair city.

They have a pretty good lunch special at $12.99 which is what we came for. This meal came with a lot of variety and definitely enough food. The staff are nice enough but the service is altogether very slow. It took us a while to get greeted and seated, to put in our order, and to get refills on water. We did come at around 2pm so maybe they were off there game (there was no wait though).\\n\\n-LUNCH HOT POT SET: We chose the half and half broth, and it was great to have both! The spiciness of the red one was a little too much for us so we took out most of the peppers so it didn't make the broth spicier. The bone marrow side was really tasty with the perfect amount of saltiness. We chose lamb for our meat, which I'm not sure was frozen enough for us to dip. It fell apart really easy so we weren't able to swish the meat like we like. Though the garlic in the bone marrow broth is amazingly soft.\\n-LAMB SKEWERS: Not the cumin flavor I was expecting but it was okay.\\n-MEAT PIE: Expensive for what you get. It's very small and thin. \\n-SAUCES: They did say we probably wouldn't need the sauces but I usually like it at hot pot places. However, these sauces were terrible (we just didn't take the warning). We got the garlic and sesame sauces. And don't get me wrong, we absolutely love garlic, but the garlic sauce had a raw taste. The sesame sauce was more a creamy sesame sauce that was kinda strange to use. \\n\\nI really wanted to like this place but my experience here was very mediocre. While the hot pot broths were tasty and the variety was great, the other dishes and service was lacking. All in all, Happy Lamb was an okay hot pot location for me, but the combined experience was disappointing."},{"name":"Zaika Indian Bistro","address":"442 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing malai kofta and garlic naan.

Both are HUGE winners! #25 has a ton of kick, amazing broth, and is just layered with flavor (starts out spicy as can be, and subsides into a more mellow but equally delicious peanut flavor). The rare beef is thinly sliced, the Pho itself is loaded with vegetables and vermicelli, and the broth is absolutely phenomenal. We have had Pho all over, coast to coast, and this is easily the best around. #62 was an adventurous order, but we were astounded by the delicately balanced herb flavors. The long, thinly sliced ginger imparted a warm, herbacious note that paired nicely with the fresh cilantro and chives. The porridge is LOADED with shrimp, and both the #25 and #62 are huge portions. Go hungry, and leave happy. The service was great despite the hustle and bustle of this tiny store-front, and the prices are well beyond reasonable.

I figured coming here might be a waste of time during a short Portland visit, since we know we can get great biscuits on visits down South, but a mouth-watering photo of \\"the Reggie\\" counseled otherwise.\\n\\nSo I order the Reggie and it is indeed a stout stack of aorta-busting good eating, what with the biscuit, gravy, fried chicken, and bacon.  But it's also a little disappointing.  The biscuit itself is really good, but nothing like you would be hard-pressed to find all over the South.  And the fried chicken, which looked delicious in the photo, was actually a bit bland and dry.  Overall, though, a formidable concoction, and washing it down with delicious Stumptown brew made it all the more satisfying.\\n\\nThe crowds that descend on this tiny restaurant--thanks in part to Guy Fieri--appear to have pretty much erased any creature comforts that it might once have had.  It's strictly a get-in and get-out kind of operation; if the signs above the counter aren't warning enough, then the slobbering, hungry folks hovering over your table will be.  We went early on a weekday morning and were able to get quickly seated and served, but still felt pressured to finish our business without tarrying.  (We passed by on a weekend morning and observed an impossible line.)\\n\\nOverall, our one visit indicated that Pine State Biscuits is a mite overrated and a mite overpriced (the Reggie, for instance, is seven dollars.)  Because of the slight disappointment, I hesitated about the four-star rating, but it's definitely better than three stars."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"3640 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I first heard about this place on the food network while I was living in Houston TX!!

Sometimes age does not bring refinement or improvement.   I hadn't been there in years, but when I used to dine there semi-frequently, it was always a dependably great meal.   The wide eyed tourists always made for dinner entertainment and that part hasn't changed.\\n\\nLet's start with the good:   complementary valet parking (very unusual in these parts).  Our waiter, Mario - attentive and amazingly well-versed on how various dishes were prepared.  Thanks, Mario.  And the wine we chose, was deemed to be a good value relative to quality.\\n\\nAnd now, the rest:    Although it was a warm (but not hot) summer evening in Boston, the restaurant was stifling hot.  One of my colleagues, from Atlanta, complained of the heat.   If he was uncomfortable, you draw the conclusion.    Another guest, from the west coast, couldn't wait to try the lobster bisque.   When I asked him how he liked it, he said \\"it's OK, but not warm\\".  OK, it's a very warm evening in the restaurant, but he expected his soup to be hot.  Doesn't hot soup always taste better than tepid?  I had the caesar salad (soggy and pedestrian), and the NY Strip (rubbery and pedestrian).   The asparagus was soaked in some overly done garlic sauces.    Evidently steak knives are optional, but available on request (both our table and the one next to ours).       \\n\\nSummary - Chart House continues to be a good place for  tourists -- it reeks of Boston history, and is in a great location.  The evening views of downtown are incredible - but you're paying for them.   If the food is \\"OK\\" that's probably fine for that view and decor.    My standard of excellence (Morton's) is well ahead now of this formerly very good dining establishment.

We got there around 6:30 and the restaurant wasn't packed.  The atmosphere is warm and welcoming and the place is very clean.\\n\\nService was prompt and efficient.  Our waiter was courteous and suggested a very good tequila for our top-shelf margaritas.  The margaritas were delicious and big! I disagree with the other reviewer who said that the tequila doesn't matter if you're going to add a bunch of cheap fillers.  From personal experience, a higher quality tequila makes a world of difference in margaritas made with fresh lime juice and Cointreau instead of cheap margarita mix. Of course you wouldn't want to put some top dollar tequila in there, but a reposado or a good silver tequila will be much more enjoyable than your bottom of the barrel cheap tequila. But I digress!\\n\\nThis place calls itself a gourmet mexican restaurant and offers higher end items on the menu. Don't go there and expect to pay Maudie's prices, you will be sadly mistaken.   We always order the \\"top shelf\\" table side guacamole. It is guaranteed fresh since they make it right in front of your eyes.  Delish! No brown mystery guacamole there, period. You even get to decide how hot and garlicky you want it.\\n\\nI had the sauteed shrimp shrimp basted in garlic butter.  It comes with rice, sauteed veggies and the butter sauce on the side.  Perfect for diet-conscious diners.  I ordered a couple of flour tortillas with it and made myself a couple of tasty shrimp soft tacos! The shrimp was cooked to perfection (I am very picky about my seafood) and the butter sauce was delicious.  The veggies were funny tasting to me though.  Not because they weren't fresh, but just the way they were prepared.\\n\\nAll in all, a very good dining experience.

So filling, so delicious.  You might think for $10 they're serving smaller portions.  Nuh-uh!  Three of the kids ordered the Fettuccine Tartufate - there's no way they could eat it all.

My faux French would not have gone over well in such an authentic establishment.  The staff was kind, patient, and more than willing to explain the menu as well as make recommendations.  One particular server was French, and recommended two bottles of wine that were to die for.  Four bottles later, after we devoured the decadent escargot, and had eaten off of each others plates, we were full, satisfied, and realized that almost 3 hours had passed.  This was definitely a relaxed dining experience, perfect for catch up with friends or cuddling with a loved one.  The fixed menu was really a steal.

My friend ordered the pulled pork. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meal. \\n\\nThe panini was crispy with generous moist pork and a few slices of ham (I substituted provolone for the swiss...personal preference).

After trying all three wines and feeling all the warm and fuzzies from her extra care and consideration, we ordered with confidence and conviction!\\n\\nAs a table of four, it made sense for us to order a few apps / sides and since we ended up getting about four of those, we opted for just one roast, one pizza, and one pasta to share. The portioning worked out perfectly. I absolutely loved the raw & pickled vegetables - a super crisp and flavorful way to do a salad (if I can even call it that - felt like so much more than a \\"salad\\"). For pasta, we did the Octopus Polpetti, which was rich and buttery. The most standard dish was the Italian sausage pizza, but we ordered it to keep the less adventurous at the table happy, and it did the trick. While the house made breads were certainly interesting and by no means bad in any way, I think we'd opt to back-fill that spot next time with something else.\\n\\nAmbiance was fantastic - low lit, and on a Tuesday, it didn't pick up until 730ish.

Decent tasting roll but I'm not sure if this minced salmon really added anything. It's not solid fish like in a rainbow roll but some processes stuff. Presentation was excellent though.

Signs asking for cash instead of credit. Take your cash and debit, otherwise it's a $12 minimum to use credit card machine! The costs are high for small businesses and so is rent, but $5 is standard everywhere!\\n\\n1 star missing for terrible tasting (too bold, burnt taste) of coffee and teas (not high quality or taste as they should)  including their pastries - some are not good ie. one experience with cheesecake (not tasty) and cinnamon roll (too gummy and rawish)...maybe it was a bad day. To be fair upon mentioning to the Owner, he agreed and gave me a free cookie - it was already the next time so I couldn't replace my order.) Also it would help to serve the fruit and waffle item on a bigger plate as I'm usually stressed out with trying to keep it on my plate rather than on the table. \\n\\nAll in all...this is one of the best bakeries I've been too - staff in the back need a bit more training on presentation/plating and quality consistency ie. waffles being cooked incorrectly when they are filled for example; or plating of waffle and fruit/creme/custard was fruit on the side which is ok, and the plate was too small so it's a struggle.\\n\\nThe one thing I cannot stand there is the breakfast waffle special on Saturday's = the eggs are microwaved sometimes or basically over fried...you need a little bit of a runny egg to make it ooze in all the right spaces and cover the dry waffle.\\n\\nThere's one or two regular staff in particular that are the best there!\\n\\nPS: I really find it odd that as a customer of 5 yrs + (ie. go  a couple times a month mostly) spending my first time as a birthday girl at this bakery cafe, that the owner does not even glance in your direction or say hi, unless you are a regular or a favorite to which he brings over free pastries.

I was told is was a must do and I'm so glad we tried it out! I ordered the carved turkey sandwich and Zack had the Croque monsieur - both served with fries and were absolutely delicious. We shared the Grey Stuff dessert which was good but kind of small in my opinion. It was like a mini cupcake with the Grey cookies and cream butter cream frosting.\\n\\nWe placed our order ahead of time which is my recommendation to you to avoid the long line. Even though you make a reservation for lunch, it's still technically a quick service location for that meal which means you are able to wait in the line at the registers to order and pay at your reservation time unless you order ahead. If you order ahead they send you through a different set of doors to pay for your food and receive your rose that you place on your table for the servers to find you once your meal is ready. You also get your cups so you can grab your drinks before you sit down.\\n\\nThe atmosphere of this restaurant is the most immersive. You literally enter Beast's castle and the decor is spot on.

They need to step it down with the bougy attitude.\\n\\nI walked in after calling in a takeout order.  All of the people working there just stared at me and no one came to help.  So I stood there like a moron for five minutes.  Finally a girl comes up, presumably the hostess and ask if she can help.  I let her know I ordered takeout so she goes to check on it in the back.  She's there for quite a while too.\\n\\nMeanwhile another waitress who looks like she's having the worst day of her life, barges over to the cash register in front of me and starts mumbling under her breath, swearing a mile a minute.

I honestly felt bad for the ladies because the waitress was so rude to them.\\n\\nI stood there for ten minutes waiting for my food, and mind you this isn't the first time.

I had high expectations since it is a new location.  But no....very much lacking.\\n\\nI ordered the Grilled 42 Day Aged Sirloin (medium rare), asparagus and mashed potatoes.  Instead I received a well-done tough piece of meat, burned asparagus and overly salty mashed potatoes.  Every time I ate the potatoes I had to drink water right after.  They were so damn salty.  And the steak was bland as could be.  Even with the madeira demi sauce, it couldn't be salvaged.\\n\\nThe Gulf Shrimp Linguine is also terrible.  There was barely any sauce, it was a pile of linguine with chopped garlic thrown in and a few pieces of plain shrimp.  I literally laughed out loud at the disastrous dish.

It was a little untraditional, and was served on a warm bed of potatoes and bacon. Next, we shared the plantain fries and the bison shortribs. The plantain fries were a little starchy for my tatse - I was imagining more of a crisp than fries but still good. The bison was #unreal, melt-in-your-mouth decadence. The star of the show, for sure. We finished off with the pulled pork tacos which were also amazing. It seemed that they make their soft corn tacos from scratch, in house. If not, they have a great homestyle supplier.\\n\\nDRINKS : The mojitos were amazing, I liked that they were served on crushed ice, which gave it a cool feel, and that they added some bitters for a different twist.\\n\\nSERVICE :  Lastly, the service was on point.

The next piece though had a larger piece of shrimp which I extracted from the piece I was eating, and my omni friend confirmed my suspicion by smelling it. When I got the waiter over again and insisted there was shrimp present, he took it back into the kitchen and returned shortly, indicating \\"yeah sorry, he told me it has shrimp\\" and walked off.

Apparently it is.\\n\\nI ordered the bulgogi + seafood tofu soup combo, but let's start with the banchan (a delightful medley of appetizer dishes...usually). It came quickly, awesome. I love my spicy food, so I was immediately impressed by the inclusion of tteokbokki (spicy rice cake), a rare surprise even for the most seasoned consumers of Korean cuisine. It was good. The potato salad was good. The oi (spicy cucumber) was good. The classic kochujang-dressed broccoli was a little hard, but still good. I was well on my way to a 4-star review. \\n\\nAnd then I ate the kimchi.\\n\\nA word about Korea's most famous dish. Kimchi comes in so many forms, perhaps hundreds, that it's a fool's errand to try to find one \\"gold standard\\" kimchi. You have to try lots of kimchi at lots of restaurants, and then you'll know good kimchi when you eat it. There are many distinctly tasting, yet equally scrumptious kimchis, so you have to keep an open mind when trying new kimchi. (My personal favorite is served at the Myung Dong kalguksoo place in Anaheim, CA, and it has a very unorthodox flavor.)\\n\\nBut at this place, the \\"kimchi\\" was just wrong. It's hard to put my finger on exactly why. It was...soggy. Tasteless. But it was also sour--and not in the common let's-intentionally-ferment-the-ddong-out-of-this-cabbage kind of sour, the daring of which I can appreciate; it was more like the kimchi was left out for weeks. I felt the cabbage apologizing to me for tasting so bad. It was depressing.\\n\\nThe rice and bulgogi came next. Surely these could not be so bad. But the rice was so bizarre. It came in the stone bowl as usual, but it was so dry and hard everywhere but the middle, which was porridge-soggy (I couldn't distinguish the grains). And the hardness of the rice wasn't because it was burnt--otherwise I could have pretended it was nooroongji and enjoyed it anyway. It was also cold. \\n\\nThe bulgogi was similarly dry and cold. I started wondering whether the sweet waitress had thought I ordered beef jerky.\\n\\nThe tofu soup was actually okay, but wasn't spicy like I had asked. But by that point I was too annoyed with the rest of the meal to enjoy it. The tofu soup really plays a duet with the rice, as with all Korean hot pots, and the rice was just butchering the performance. \\n\\nI'm sorry I have to do this.

The ordering line is lined with boxes of potatoes and peanut oil just to show you that the fries are cut in-store and not delivered frozen.\\n\\nThe burger was pretty tasty. It reminded me of what a homemade burger would taste like (which is a really good thing). And, $5 for a tasty half-pound burger is just about right, so no complaints there. The crinkle-cut fries are pretty thin, but very good as well. There are some crumbs, but the $1.50 order is pretty big, so that's really a non-issue.\\n\\nMy wife ordered a Blue Bell milkshake, and there's definitely more ice cream than milk. Yet, the shake wasn't so thick that you couldn't drink it with a regular straw (no waiting for the thing to melt to the proper consistency) and, like the burger, tasted like a homemade milkshake.\\n\\nOne thing that struck me is just how clean everything is. The burgers are ground and made into patties on-site, and there's a giant glass wall where you can watch this process if you wish.

While I'm no Taiwanese food expert, I am an expert what I think tastes good, and what is a good value, and it certainly gets no better than that for Ah-Ma's.\\n\\nThe restaurant space has a casual but cool, clean, and modern design, and while it is very small (maybe 20 seats tops), we had no problem getting a table the moment we walked in on a Thursday night.  Service was attentive, and we decided to order a sampling of small plates and bites to share between the two of us.\\n\\nSalt and Pepper Chicken:  This is the only Taiwanese dish I am familiar with, and Ah-Ma's version was the best I've had.  These crispy little chicken nuggets are addictive, and come with leaves of fried basil.  The spicy isn't really \\"spicy,\\" but just doused in Five Spice seasoning.  Delicious.\\nFried Pig Ears:  This was my first time eating pig ears, and I wasn't sure what to expect, but I LOVED these.  The flavor and texture is a bit like pork belly, with lots of delicious pig fat and a little bit of crispy cartilage.  \\nLu Rou Fan: This is probably the only thing I wouldn't order again.  It's a fragrant pork stew served in a small bowl over rice, with pickled veggies and half a tea smoked egg.  It was fine, but just didn't rise to the level of amazingness that the other dishes did.\\nPork Belly Bao:  An absolute must order.  It's hard to go wrong with pork belly, but cook it to perfect crispiness, garnish it well, and serve it on a fluffy light steamed bun wrapper, and this dish rises to new levels.  Don't expect to share this one - you'll want your own.\\nBeef Cheek Bao:  Also delicious, but not as delicious as the pork belly bao.\\n\\nThe two of us stuffed ourselves silly on the above items, and my dad (yelper Doug B.) also ordered a shrimp bao, which he proclaimed to be better than the beef cheek bao but not as good as the pork belly one.  All of this food was less than $40 - a total steal for the quality and quantity of the items ordered.  My only regret is that now I know this place is here and is as good as it is, is that it's going to be really hard to go to Trader Joe's right next door without stopping in for a pork belly bao!"},{"name":"Pizzeria Ludica","address":"189 Keefer Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I went to Ludica for a birthday party (about 15 people), on a Monday evening.

It took 30 minutes before she offered to bring anyone else a drink (more drinks = more money = bigger tip, right?). \\n\\nIt then took another 20 minutes at least before any food orders were taken. While I understand that the idea of slower service is probably ideal to give customers time to play their board games, nobody at our table wanted to play anything because we were all so busy with conversation. I think she could have made this observation and sped things up. \\n\\nAfter my first glass of wine was finished, I was not offered another, so we all went elsewhere to have a few more drinks each. \\n\\nA tip of 15% was automatically added to our order naturally, but I don't feel it was deserved.

Yes, there is a selection of sweets; they even have ice cream!  But what sets GPC apart from its competitors is that it has salty snacks that are done to perfection.  I will highlight one in particular: the savory scones.  Veg?  Non-veg?  They've got both covered.  After much deliberation and a thorough discussion with the helpful and friendly barista, I opted for the chicken sausage and cheddar.  \\n\\nWhat a combination!  The denseness of the scone didn't distract from the flavor, which was primarily cheesy with bursts of salty meatiness.  The sausage added texture balance creating a dimension that one can only find in food of stellar caliber.  So robust without being heavy or gross.\\n\\nI opted for iced coffee, which made a nice side to my scone (though I had stopped by GPC for coffee, the scone certainly ended up dominating my attention!)

Rather than tack it to 'Go next door for better stuff', I recommend going for the dishes that actually are good: \\n\\n- Fried Ice Cream. Hands down one of the most sinful desserts found in the area. Sometimes the crust of the fried ice cream is thicker, but it's not that often. Always a treat.\\n\\n- Go for the dinner specials, which are an entirely different menu of 5 choices. If spicy food is where your heart's at, my friends have attacked the Macaroni Sriracha dish on the specials more than once. My favorite is the first dinner special, a stir-fried vermicelli. It reminds me of my grandmother's stir-fried vermicelli and being an Asian from Asia, that means something more. \\n\\n- Curry is not easy to botch up, and this place does a good tom yum too."},{"name":"Chart House","address":"60 Long Wharf","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"We went for Restaurant Week, and ate off that menu.

Be Our Guest is absolutely fabulous, both in terms of dining and the experience. Disney has really taken it up a notch with this new restaurant, and it shines. \\n\\nWe dined here in mid-January, shortly after new Fantasyland opened, so the excitement and hype was super high. We all knew we wanted to have lunch here on our day in the MK, and had heard lines were legendary. The reports were right, and we joined a long line of people at 10:45am. Yes, 10:45am, not so long after most in our party had feasted on cinnamon rolls for breakfast at the nearby Gaston's Tavern. The restaurant opened at 11:30, and the line went fairly quickly after that. The staff manning the line was unfailingly cheerful and friendly, and even when half of our party was missing, they allowed us to keep our space in line. Very nice.\\n\\nExperience: From the time you stand in line to when you sit down, you're in for a visual treat. Beast's castle is impeccably done, from the perspective trickery outside to the grand entrance hall and stained glass art inside. As you wait in line, there's lots to keep you entertained, from the creaking suits of armor in the entry hallway to the books and rich appointments in Beast's library (aka the ordering room). The staff directs you to an individual kiosk with a touch screen. The ordering system is pretty simple, just make your selections, specify the quantity or any special requests, and then pay with a credit card/room key. (Minor annoyance: if you pay cash, a staffer has to direct you to a separate register. Really?!) It's all very similar to the fast casual concept in restaurants like Panera etc.\\nAfter ordering, you're handed a restaurant beeper that's in the shape of a rose bud - very cute. From here, you can fill up your soda cup in the dining room and then you find a table in one of the dining rooms and place your beeper on the table. We were very mystified as to how the servers know where to find you to bring your food (the dining rooms are massive and the roses aren't obvious indicators), but Disney magic, I guess. The servers are dressed like the ones from the movie, and bring out the food on massive glass-domed tray carts similar to a cheese cart in a fancy restaurant. Very classy. \\n\\nFood: I had the steak sandwich and pommes frites (oh Disney, you so fancy) for $11. I was a little nervous, knowing that steak at this price point is usually tough and disappointing. Not this one. This steak was juicy and tender, not fatty at all, and topped with a delicious herbed garlic butter spread. The crunchy French bread complemented it nicely, as did the skinny, crispy french fries. Fantastic! Others in my party tried the tuna nicoise salad, croque monsieur, and the carved turkey sandwich. The tuna nicoise salad was just gorgeous, filled with ripe veggies and topped with a hearty serving of tuna steak. The turkey sandwich was similar to my steak one, but the croque monsieur was kind of tiny and looked a little over-toasted and greasy to me. Everyone raved about their food. For dessert, we each tried one of the cupcakes, and they all received rave reviews. My BF and I split the chocolate and strawberry cream cheese cupcakes between us, and they were both to die for. The chocolate cupcake was moist, rich, and topped with elegant chocolate pieces. The strawberry cream cheese cupcake was equally fancy, with a great strawberry flavor and even little strawberry crunchies on top. Both of these cupcakes were works of art, both in taste and presentation, and way better than the average Disney cupcake or dessert. Highly recommend! \\n\\nAtmosphere: There are three dining rooms: the ballroom, the West Wing (rose room), or the rose gallery (Belle's room). The West Wing, is the smallest and IMHO, kind of creepy and it may freak out little kids. The hologram effect on the rose where you can watch the petals fall is pretty cool, but the room is very dark and has simulated thunder and lightening. The rose gallery (Belle's room) is very light and airy, like a bright, fancy parlour room with ornate decor. The ballroom is the one you see in all the commercials and the famous dance scene from the movie, and by far the most grand (and noisy). If you watch out the windows at the end of the room, you can see snow \\"falling\\" outside - very neat. We sat in the ballroom and loved it - just like being part of the movie.  \\n\\nPros: delicious food, excellent theming and Disney \\"magic\\", overall a must-do experience.\\nCons: extremely long wait to get in (but it's worth it!)"},{"name":"Frasca Food and Wine","address":"1738 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"We were expecting great things from this restaurant when we dined here for a birthday this past summer.

We were really excited about going.\\n\\nI love olives and Marcona almonds, so I got the marinated olives/Marcona almond starter. Trader Joe's Marconas are better... There wasn't anything marinated about the olives. I like really firm olives but these were hard as a rock. They were quite underwhelming.\\n\\nThe texture on the marinated octopus was pretty bad. It was all mealy (like moist cornbread). Yes, I know octopus should be either cooked very quickly or for a long time. They definitely went with the long time option (or maybe it was the marinade?) Personally, I think octopus is much better eaten raw  with a dab of soy sauce, but I've never seen it offered raw in the States. My girlfriend said the accompanying blood sausage was quite good (I wasn't  a huge fan of it).\\n\\nThe lamb was great. It was so tender that there was no need for a knife. However, the farro that it came with was way too salty and overpowering.

The place probably functions best as a late night watering hole, not as a \\"come hang out and eat some good food place\\"; especially since the service is really slow.\\n\\nThe decor is really dark and heavy, and the staff are all in black t-shirts/dark clothing. Again, probably great for Saturday late night drinking, but not very welcoming. \\n\\nWe came in around 2 on Sunday afternoon, and the place wasn't that full. Easily got a table in the main dining area and could overlook the rest of the place. Most of the people I saw there were hanging out for a drink, not ordering food.\\n\\nHowever, my group was hungry, so we ordered food. I had the Irish Trilogy off the brunch menu: cinnamon apple French toast, two scrambled eggs, bacon, and hash browns. All of it was just okay. Scrambled eggs... well, it's hard to make them fancy unless you add in cheese or peppers/onions, etc., and these were just standard scrambled eggs I could make in my kitchen. Same with the bacon, although their's was super greasy. Probably didn't let it rest on a paper towel before putting it on the plate. Hash browns were okay, under-seasoned and I added a fair amount of ketchup to make them taste better. The French toast was a measly portion, like two pieces of baby bread with caramelized cinnamon apples on top. I'm a sucker for apples prepared like that (thanks, Mom!), and wanted to give it a shot. My final result is that I could easily make them at home (or better than Meehan's) if I read \\"The Joy of Cooking\\" more often. And actually made time to cook for myself. But that's another story for another day!\\n\\nBoyfriend had the corned beef hash, and it looked like it was primarily potatoes with a little bit of hash. Although homemade, he didn't seem to rave about it. He had to get his eggs redone because the whites were too under cooked. So much so that a yolk rolled out as the food runners set it on the table. The second round was better.\\n\\nThe birthday boy got a venison burger, and didn't like it so sent it back for a regular beef burger. Unfortunately, the second one wasn't any better. He mentioned something about weird seasoning, and it was different than the last time he came to Meehan's. \\n\\nOverall, I'll pass if I'm in the area. It seemed really overpriced for what we got. $11 for a brunch entree and a $6 mimosa. The beer and wine were higher than what I'd be comfortable paying. The cheapest glass of wine I saw was $7."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"On a recent trip to Walt Disney World, I wanted to eat here because it had opened since my prior visit. I wanted to see what the new table-service restaurant was like, so I got my advanced dining reservation early. I was eager to try this place, and see what ambiance Disney had crafted for it.\\n\\nI wasn't exactly disappointed, but I wasn't impressed, either.\\n\\nWhen you check-in, it is at a little gothic hut at the end of the bridge. You then get to linger on the bridge until you are messaged that your table is ready. Once you receive the message, you get to linger in the courtyard outside the doors until a cast member comes out to collect your party, and this may still take some minutes.\\n\\nThere are three dining rooms:\\n\\n1. The Grand Ballroom, which resembles the one in the movie, complete with flickering candlelight using Disney magic instead of actual candles. However, the lighting is as dim as candlelight, too, so it may be a bit hard to read your menu.\\n\\n2. The West Wing, where the Beast's bedroom is, and the enchanted rose. This is even dimmer than the Grand Ballroom, but there are concealed spotlights illuminating the table surfaces.\\n\\n3. The Art Gallery, the brightest of the three dining rooms.\\n\\nI do not know if you can request one room over another. I was not asked, and we ended up in the Grand Ballroom.\\n\\nThe cast member waiting on our table gave excellent service. I find no fault with the professionalism and courtesy of the cast members. (Well, there's one exception, we'll get to at the end.)\\n\\nIf there is a child menu involved in your party, there's a battery-operated Lumi√®re handed to the child who gets to carry it to the table. It gets taken away almost immediately at the table, but it might be possible to ask for it to remain.\\n\\nMy older daughter ordered a garden salad, but doesn't like vinaigrettes; the waiter was quick to offer ranch dressing as a substitute, which worked just fine. She said the salad was just fine.\\n\\nMy son ordered a two-person appetizer, the \\"assorted cured meats and sausages,\\" but what was received was a few different cheeses, including a brie, some sliced cured meat, some sausage, a little country-style mustard, a cherry compote, and a small, sliced baguette. My son wasn't happy with the meats or cheeses, so I ended up eating most of it, though my older daughter tried some. I thought it was a nice appetizer, but rather adult.\\n\\nThe three kids all enjoyed the basket of warm dinner rolls and butter with sea salt. In fact, we had to refill the basket.\\n\\nI ordered the French onion soup. I was told up front that this was a vegetarian soup; it didn't use beef stock. I've made it in the vegetarian style, so I found it to be very good, the bread and cheese on top were perfectly done. I'd gladly order this soup again, anytime.\\n\\nI'd also ordered a glass of wine; this is the first restaurant in the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World to do this, to my knowledge. What I selected turned out to be the recommended wine for my entr√©e: Georges Duboeuf Beaujolais-Villages, Burgundy. It was delicious, an excellent accompaniment.\\n\\nI ordered the \\"Layered Ratatouille,\\" described as \\"Oven-baked Zucchini, Eggplant, Mushrooms, Tomatoes, and Caramelized Onions sliced and layered on Quinoa served with a Bell Pepper Sauce.\\" The ratatouille itself was quite enjoyable, as was the quinoa. The big disappointment for me was the bell pepper sauce. It was too salty for my taste, but I only noticed when I got a fork with mostly sauce. The ratatouille and quinoa moderated it just fine. It was OK, but if I ordered it again, I'd skip the bell pepper sauce. The portion size was just fine.\\n\\n(I will have to check my receipt for what the kids got.)\\n\\nI did order the Grey Stuff for dessert, but it wasn't spectacular. My youngest ordered the Triple Chocolate Cupcake, but she said it all tasted like dark chocolate, and she didn't like it.\\n\\nOne thing we were told about at the end of the meal was to stop off where we could get a photo with our host, the Beast. Unfortunately, we had a FastPass scheduled for 9 PM, and it was 9:30 PM by the time we got out. I said to the cast member there that we didn't think we could get our Beast picture because of our FastPass, and she just shrugged her shoulders, which seemed decidedly un-Disney. Not that I expected to be propelled to the front of the line, but maybe being told there was a way we could come back later on our trip, or something like that.\\n\\nThere is an announcement every so often, to let people know the Beast is coming through the Grand Ballroom. He heads off to the side room where he poses for photographs.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Be Our Guest looks impressive, but the food results are uneven. I'd be willing to go back, but more to avoid items I've tried than to attempt resisting something I've already had. Have some extra light ready, and set aside more time than you think you'll need."},{"name":"Peaceful Restaurant","address":"110-532 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I wanted to try dimsum in Vancouver when we went on vacation, but we ended up going to Peaceful for Xiao Long Bao. \\n\\nFirst, I would like to say that they could definitely use new tables. All of the tables are cracked/raised from water damage, and it was unsightly. \\n\\nI like spicy food and I like braised beef, so I ordered the Sichuan Beef Soup Noodles on recommendation but it was quite disappointing. The broth wasn't bad, but it wasn't spicy. The dollop of chili garlic did nothing for me. \\n\\nThe Xiao Long Bao was ok, a bit too salty for me. The Peaceful Beef Rolls were good, but we boxed them. They were also good reheated. Kind of wish there was some chili oil and vinegar, for the soup and the xiao long bao. \\n\\nOur favorite was the Sweet Soy Glazed Spareribs. Crispy, sweet and savory.

And being featured on Food Network probly accounts for about a dollar per donut increase, and yes, these donuts are 100%-150% more money than other good donuts, I admit that's too high. And with the volume they do they could probly decrease the price about a dollar per, increase their sales, and still make a buttload of money.\\n     That being said, you can't just call it a rip off or say \\"these donuts suck\\" because of the price.  And If you were comparing it to voodoo donuts you are a lunatic, as there is absolutely very little or no culinary value at Voodoo. Besides that of a teeth hurting jaw clinching Sugar Rush. Don't Get me wrong, we also enjoy Voodoo but the product is night and day. It is like comparing a Volkswagen beetle to a Mercedes S class, both are fun to drive but for very different reasons. \\n     At Blue Star you can tell they use very high end ingredients, including the extracts, to get that kind of flavor. And high end extracts are very expensive. Also what you won't find here that you will find at EVERY other donut shop in the country are bags of doughnut mix, Glaze, and cans of fillings, filled with chemicals preservatives and other crap. Blue star cares about starting with a high quality product so the finish product is high quality, and you can taste it in the donuts. And yes they run out of stuff, you can't just rip open a bag and whip up one of their donuts in 20 min like every other donut shop in town can. When we're talking about quality you can even point out the boxes and papers they used to wrap the donuts in, they all look high end non bleached, and you can tell when handling your donut with them.

At first, it just felt weird, you're equilibrium off caliber, but after a few drinks, that all didn't matter.  The Guac was good, the texture I liked, a little chunky.  Sharing 5 tacos, which was almost the right amount for us this night.  Next visit we'll do at least six or seven.  We both agreed our favorite taco out of the five was the Cochinita Pibil, but honestly; they were all good...  very fresh ingredients.  The Spicy margarita was a delight, a good kick on every sip.  The Sangria Rojo is great, but is stronger than we thought at first, that one crept up later... fair warning for some of you.  The place is cozy and trendy, great service and the fastest drinks I've ever seen come out of the bar."},{"name":"Zyka","address":"1677 Scott Blvd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"We stopped in Atlanta on a road trip just to eat at this restaurant.

I don't mind terribly, as I am generally of the opinion that portions are bigger than they need to be, but it was surprising the first time around. \\n\\nOne thing I've never been disappointed by: the food. The salads are always fresh, have more upscale options (berry/feta is delicious), and are a filling size. The pastries are routinely fan-freaking-tastic and not to be missed.

Peaceful Restaurant is a far cry from the loud, bustling, cafeteria-style Cantonese restaurants that have until now defined Chinese food for North America. It's more intimate and rustic - think ramen shop. Noodles are handmade and compared to other nearby Chinese restaurants, fresh and MUCH less (if any) MSG.\\n\\nNoodles are hand-made right in front of the customer's eyes. \\n\\nDan-Dan noodle 3.5/5- They're very inconsistent with this dish. Ordered 3 times before. 1st, ordered vegetarian - received pork with the right amount of sauce. 2nd, ordered with pork - WAY too much sauce. 3rd, ordered vegetarian - got tofu and the right amount of sauce.\\n\\nChive Pockets 5/5 - Delicious every time. You can choose to have them steamed or pan fried. I go for pan fry - crispy outside, soft inside with a hint of garlic/chive flavor. \\n\\nChilli Noodle 4/5- Again, delicious! Lots of Szechuan pepper, red chilli, salt and garlic on hand-made noodles. No complains going in - coming out on the other hand, it's torture and lasted an entire day for me.\\n\\nXi'an Cold Noodle 5/5 - Hand-torn noodles served cold in a salty / vinegary sauce, bean sprouts and cucumber. Light and fresh - very nice, perfect for vegetarians. \\n\\nService 3/5 - These guys are incapable of handling a lunch rush - the establishment isn't built for it. Floor size is too small, and 1 debit machine serve as the major contributions to the bottleneck that leaves customers waiting over 5-10 minutes to be seated, for their food to arrive, to pay their bill. This time adds up to a much longer than intended visit.

Instead of booking a trip to Africa, all I had to do was book a dinner at Jiko.  Of course, there is no way that I can tell if the food is authentic, but I will prescribe to the \\"ignorance is bliss\\" theme.  The decor is elegant (aka premium prices) and you feel like you really have been transported to the Serengeti and are now awaiting your meal at your bush camp.  The only telltale sign that may indicate otherwise are all the tourists in their Disney souvenir garb at the buffet just across.  \\n\\nThe only way I can describe African cuisine, which I know I am generalizing, is a melting pot of Mediterannean, Middle Eastern and Indian flavors.  We started withthe Taste of Africa which is a bread basket.  They give you a card that describes everything you are eating.  The basket we got that night was composed of pappadom, poppy seed lavash, and naan.  Accompanying it were 4 dips that were each uniques in flavor. I could go into describing them in detail, but really, you will probably end up calling them by color like we did - the red sauce, the green, red with green specks, and tan. The red was my favorite, it had a bit of kick to it.\\n\\nLooking around, almost every table had a wood-fired flatbread.  So we picked the pickled artichoke which had sun dried tomatoes, piquillo peppers, goat cheese, ricotta, and parmesan (and the namesake of course.) It was such a great starter being relatively light. \\n\\nThe crispy beef bobotie roll came next. This reminded me between the love child of a taquito and egg roll.  The filling inside was a ground beef mixture with a mild spice mix, with a hint of curry seasoning and a touch of sweetness.\\n\\nFor the entree, I went with Chad A's recommendation of Seared Barberie duck breast. It was served medium rare and very tender.  The port emulsion was a great pairing adding a bit of sweetness. My wife ordered the Bunny Chow and Falafel which was the only vegetarian option for entrees.  The name was the most exciting part of the dish.\\n\\nJiko represents a uniques semi-formal dining option that really lets you taken in the dramatic scenery of the Wilderness Lodge.

The Boma buffet is a thing of beauty and wonder. We made brunch here our last stop before scooting to the airport for our flight home, and it set us up wonderfully. The buffet has a number of stations -- traditional African foods, omelettes, regular American breakfast (waffles, pancakes), fresh fruit, pastries, and breads -- and you can make as many visits to them as you'd like. There's something to suit every age and appetite, as our party of two adults and four kids (some of whom are very picky eaters) will testify: we all had at least two platefuls, and one of our six year olds had far more than that!\\n\\nThe traditional African foods were delicious! The chalakah (a spiced tomato and onion concoction) was phenomenal, and the scrambled eggs were the creamiest I'd ever tasted. There was also a curried sausage skillet that was spicy good, and a turkey and egg creation that was equally yummilicious.\\n\\nAll of the other foods were equally good, including an African fruit salad, an excellent selection of fresh pastries, and an impressive selection of cereals.\\n\\nAll Disney restaurants are paranoid (in a good way) about food allergies. Our party includes someone with a nut allergy, and as we sat down the chef appeared at our table, to escort our allergic person on a tour of the buffet stations so they could identify what was suitable for them. This personal service was something we also experienced at Sanaa (also in the Animal Lodge resort) and appreciated very much.\\n\\nEvery table has waiter service for drinks, and each of us had the Jungle Juice (a mix of guava, papaya, and orange). The service was swift, friendly, and really went beyond what we might ever expect, even including an offer to send us the recipe for the chalakah we liked so much.\\n\\nBoma is located in the Animal Kingdom Lodge, which is about as fancy a joint as we saw on our travels throughout Walt Disney World. There are various savannah views from the Lodge, though not from Boma itself. I advise venturing out to the kid playground near the pool, where giraffes occasionally wander by. There's also a balcony on the lobby level that offers very nice views across the savannah.\\n\\nWe'll definitely return to Boma, should we return to Disney World.

No one complained, but no one was crazy about the food. We also ordered quite a few appetizers. Overall, the portions are relatively small so you don't walk away feeling like you got your \\"bang for your buck\\". \\n\\nFortunately, service was fairly consistent. It seems that they are capable of handling a large group. Both times I've dined there have been with parties (8+ people). The servers were attentive and managed the multiple tables/orders very well. \\n\\nUltimately, I guess it is a good place in the Arena District if you have a large group. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't highly recommend going out of your way to get down there."},{"name":"Comella's","address":"1095 Great Plain Ave","city":"Needham","stars":"3","text":"I don't understand how there are bad reviews for this place.

Mozzarella sticks were decent, would have been better if we were on time picking up the food, but that is completely our fault, not Comella's, so no complaint here. Pizza was good, and only $5, can't argue with that! \\n\\nWhat really impressed us was the sauce that came with the Mozzarella Sticks. It was incredible. Definitely going to try the pasta next time, as the sauce was delicious. Just a quick word of advice, let the sauce cool off first, because it was piping hot, and burned out mouths a little bit.\\n\\nOverall, great place.

Rather. Impressed. \\n\\nGood appetizers, amazing pasta, delicious dessert. Decent steak. And the service was attentive, professional, charming and not at all stuffy. The atmosphere was loud, but friendly, and I like the gilded art deco moldings, the blue light, the long open layout, the whole deal. But you want the details? \\n\\nWe started with grilled octopus - tender and lemony and smoky and pretty much perfect. The pickled red onion and delicate strips of salami that dressed it were sharp counterpoints.  We also had a simple plate of prosciutto, roasted peppers and fresh mozzarella. I wish people would keep the vinegar away from the mozzarella, but that's me. The other elements were perfect and nicely plated and I'm beginning to suspect they have a really excellent grill back there - the peppers might have been the best part of that little ensemble. \\n\\nWe followed this with an appetizer plate of pumpkin tortellini with brown butter and nuts. Although this was by far the most delicious thing that reached our table, I was glad we'd gotten a small portion. It was insanely rich and a bit too sweet for a full plate of pasta. But the pasta itself was one of those simple, perfect starches that borders on pastry in its delicacy of flavor and texture. If I go back (and I suspect I will) I will order a full plate of their homemade pasta. \\n\\nAnd then steaks. Again, the flavor of the grill was satisfying and sweet. The meat itself was . . . not the best quality. This course was helped along by a nice glass of Montepulciano which our waiter poured at just the right moment. \\n\\nWe had a panna cotta for dessert, with a mix of candied pistachios, walnuts and cashews. That mix of nuts was to die for and the panna cotta had a great flavor on its own. \\n\\nWe feasted on the bounty of a gift card, and I had honestly been anxious about the meal and gone in there with a feeling of duty. I never go to big old hospitality group restaurants, but the food avoided being generic and the service avoided being annoying. The octopus reminded me of cute little Greek places in Philly, the panna cotta tasted like the milk pudding I order at my local diner turned Halal kabob house. The service was certainly up a notch from my usual haunts, but not in a showy way. \\n\\nBut, no doubt about it, Teatro is trying to be many things to many people. The folks next to us had multiple baskets of fried food and pizza. Some people are there just for drinks. There were older folks, large parties, a vegan on a date (that was not starting out well), tweens with their parents eating big simple dishes of pasta. But you can't do everything perfectly, and the place has its strengths and weaknesses and I think I might explore them again sometime.\\n\\nAnd when I did . . . a full plate of homemade pasta under lobster and butter was heavenly. The chocolate cake was properly cake-like, as the waitstaff promised, (not that flourless/molten nonsense) with a wine sauce I'd be honored to serve my own dinner guests. It was a slow Tuesday evening in summer and the awesome waiter from our first visit had invited his whole family to dine.

We were told to sit anywhere, so we chose a booth.\\n\\nOur waitress (I believe her name was Brianna) came over and was nice, brought us water, and explained the bar and how they have all their bottled beer on an iPad or we could download the app to search. I liked this as it's easier than pouring over a book. My girlfriend asked to sample a beer, oops the keg was tapped out on that from the previous night. Well, that happens, oh well. She picks another one, likes it so we order our drinks. Our drinks end up sitting at the bar for so long that the bartender realizes this and pours mine again as it has gotten warm. (Strike 1).\\n\\nWe finally get our drinks and are enjoying the bar, when we decide to get some food. However, our waitress has decided to spend 5 minutes sitting down at the booth next to us chatting with some guy: a friend, a flirt, who knows. By this time our beers are almost empty. (Strike 2).\\n\\nFinally we catch her eye and she takes our food order, places it and comes back to see what we want next. This round came out much quicker, though delivered by other staff as the bar was starting to get a bit busier. Our food comes out, the black and blue flatbread was really, really good. The waitress comes over again to check on us, talks about how much she likes that flatbread as well. My girlfriend and I agree that she's gaining back some of the favor she lost with us earlier.\\n\\nWe finish our meal, our beers finished, and are waiting for the check. Time passes again. Now my water glass is empty. Still no check. Now the other water glass is empty. 8 minutes pass after that until we finally see her again and ask for the check, most of which was her chatting up another table of maybe regulars, not taking an order (maybe she was, I don't know).\\n\\nPros: This place has a lot of beers and they seem pretty knowledgeable about recommendations. They were 2 for 2 on ideas for my girlfriend. The food was great. The location was very nice.\\n\\nCons: The service was hit or miss. Having to wait for our first round so long that the bartender realizes it, especially when it is not busy is just not a good business practice. Also, letting patrons wait for 10+ minutes with empty glasses is also probably not smart.\\n\\nI'll willing to cut them a break as they just opened a few weeks ago, but this left a pretty bad taste in my mouth.

The jampong is perfectly spicy and has a lot of seafood in it. It's a contrast from the jjajang which is why I like to order both and share, because they don't have that option of eating half and half. \\n\\nBut the main is always the tangsuyook!!!

The new location offers the same extraordinary ice cream, but has the added perk of indoor seating!\\n\\nIce Cream: Morelli's specializes in gourmet ice cream and it is no wonder that they have consistently been ranked as one of the top ice cream establishments in the country. The flavors are innovative and true to their namesake. On my first visit, I opted for the \\"Elvis Lives\\", which was a banana ice cream with peanut butter swirl and chocolate chunks. As expected, it was excellent. The new locations also offers a series of specialty sundaes, custom ice cream cakes, and bottled drinks.\\n\\nService: All the staff were friendly, efficient, and eager to offer free samples. It appears that several of the staff from the first location are also working here, so the ordering process went smoothly.\\n\\nAtmosphere: Open, clean, and inviting. As I alluded to before, the new location has indoor seating (~8 tables), as well as bathrooms! Another added perk is that the flavors and toppings are in a glass case so that you can readily see what is available. Another unique aspect of the new space is that the seating area has bar stools and table benches that are shaped to look like oreo cookies and ice cream sandwiches, respectively. \\n\\nPrice: Similar to the first location, the ice cream is fairly pricey. However, it's important to note that they are serving up gourmet ice cream that you can't get elsewhere. The sizes at this location are \\"small\\", \\"medium\\", and \\"large\\", as opposed to the \\"single\\" and \\"double\\" of the original location. The \\"medium\\" appears to be equivalent to the \\"double\\" (~3 scoops) and will run you nearly $6 with no toppings. \\n\\nOther: The only problem I encountered during this visit was that they were only accepting cash, which a staff member informed me was only because the credit/debit card system is still in the process of being set-up. She also informed me that the first Morelli's location will continue to remain in business, so feel free to patronize whichever is closer to you, or both."},{"name":"Erin McKenna's Bakery NYC","address":"1642 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Recently had to go gluten free for health reasons.

Even though I'd done extensive research and knew how things worked, I happily listened to her explain anyways.\\nShe informed me and my best friend the we'd be dining in The Grand Ballroom and I literally started to cry the most happy tears. She tells us to feel free to explore the castle and not to forget to meet Prince Adam himself after dinner. \\nOur waiter came over promptly and was excited to see all of my Beauty and the Beast gear. He told us how the snow falling outside of the window is the original animation from the movie and the cherubs painted on the ceiling are the original imagineers as babies.\\nThe Grand Ballroom itself is beautiful and I literally felt like I had on the iconic dress and Angela Lansbury was nearby singing \\"Tale As Old As Time\\" while I danced with the love of my life.\\nFor dinner I had the braised pork (Coq au Vin-Style) and it was AMAZING!!! The meat was melting in my mouth. \\nDessert was a no brainer. I went there with the intention of trying The Grey Stuff. If you're wondering, it was in fact, delicious. \\nI was full and happy. \\nOnce during dinner there was a royal announcement of sorts where The Beast would walk through (on his way to the library) and he'd wave and bow.\\n\\nAfter we ate, we made our way to The West Wing first. It was dark with the iconic slashed painting of Prince Adam and the Enchanted Rose. Again, here comes the  tears.

It has a lovely moving statue of the stars dancing and there's huge photos on the wall with images of everyone Belle loves. \\n\\nBut the highlight for me, besides living a dream was my meet and greet with The Beast. We go to the library, we get in line, and we hear the music that his highness is making his way to us. I get my camera ready and he walks in. My friend goes first and I'm chatting with the character attendant while she takes her photos (he doesn't sign autographs). The character attendant noted my 2 phone cases, my array of trading pins and my shirt. \\nMy turn comes. I walk up to him thinking we're going to get into position for a photo when he sticks out his hand. *Tale As Old As Time starts to play* He cusps my hand and then bows then takes me around my waist. *cries* And we dance and everyone cheers and claps.

Please keep in mind this is a newer business so minor hiccups are okay. \\n\\nAlso, the hours are great. You don't find many businesses open till 10 in Burnaby!\\n\\nI look forward to watching this amazing business grow. I hope the quality of the food and kind service continues on."},{"name":"Pizzeria Ludica","address":"189 Keefer Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"My second time here after my first time a year ago. Food takes too long to get from the time you order, and it was not that busy when I was there. Still underwhelming food, $12 pizza deal is not much of a deal at all. Takes about $2 off select pizzas. Beer selection is still lacking."},{"name":"The Mission Bar & Grill","address":"724 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I have come here for brunch twice, and loved it every single time. I usually don't order sweet things for brunch, but their options are really unique and the flavors all work really well together. I had a banana bread french toast the first time, and it was the perfect size. I've also tried the chocolate chip pancakes which come topped off with a caramelized roasted banana. Their coffee is also wonderful, and the refills just keep coming! There is also not much of a wait in the mornings for brunch on the weekends which is super great."},{"name":"Xinh Xinh","address":"7 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This is probably my favorite pho place in chinatown.  it's a cozy little place with cramped tables, but it never failed to seat me promptly.  the quails are to die for, nice and crispy!  the pho has just the right amount of meat.\\nservice is fast, as soon as you put the menu down, someone would come to the table and take your order, food is out in a jippy."},{"name":"Laseters Tavern at Vinings","address":"4355 Cobb Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"One of those places you can trust.

In fact, I think even if you followed a recipe you would probably come closer than what is at Java Noodles. What a disappointment! \\nWhat I ordered: Sate Ayam, and Nasi Goreng. Neither tasted anything at all like what you would get in Indonesia.\\n\\nThe sate was dry, and tasted like it had been done on a tandoori oven. The peanut sauce doesn't even begin to resemble what Indonesian peanut sauce should taste like. Where's the sambal? Where's the Sriracha? Bland.\\n\\nThe nasi goreng has all of the right ingredients: fried rice, carrots, onions, eggs, chicken, shrimp. So it's weird that it doesn't taste anything like nasi goreng. It was bland - I added soy sauce (which is not the right taste, but at least it gave it some flavor). This dish would be passable as Chinese fried rice, but not Nasi Goreng.\\n\\nThe food itself is fine, and tastes ok in its own right (except not much flavor) - probably why there are so many good reviews. If I had never eaten in Jakarta, I would probably think this was pretty good. But it doesn't satisfy someone who wants real Indonesian food.\\n\\nAh, Indo Cafe in downtown Sacramento - I'm going to miss you!"}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"search-container"},j={class:"card-container"},D=["disabled"],H={key:0},R={key:1};function F(n,e,s,f,i,r){const u=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",N,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",j,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(u,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",R,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",H,"See more"))],8,D)):w("",!0)])}const G=c(E,[["render",F],["__scopeId","data-v-8fd2342f"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/42.md","filePath":"sponsor/42.md"}'),L={name:"sponsor/42.md"},Y=Object.assign(L,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(G)]))}});export{V as __pageData,Y as default};
