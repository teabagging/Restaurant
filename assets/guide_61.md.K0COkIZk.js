My plan was to head, um, somewhere else, but this place was close to my bus transfer and my fellow Cubs fans had flaked that day.  I decided to check it out and not only did they have the game on, WITH sound, but there were a whole lot of other Cubs fans in the place.  \\n\\nHowever, it's not a sports bar.  At least, it's not a bar to watch popular sports at.  The first game I watched here was not super well attended and the two bartenders were having trouble keeping up. The second and third games were progressively busier and the lines at the bar got progressively longer.  The kitchen spent a lot of time walking around trying to find where orders belonged, and getting pretty frustrated at it.  Each visit had a different crew, so it's gotta be a systemic thing.\\n\\nThere's a pool table and a patio with another TV in the back with a gravel deck and a porch in front.  The back had heaters, I think the front did, too.  Like I said the kitchen will run out orders and if the bartenders aren't too busy there's table service.\\n\\nUnfortunately they have a \\"zero tolerance policy\\".  It's got some Portland bubble ideological stuff in it, but what really pissed me off was the second item that says that \\"Any physical contact - push, scuffle, fight\\" will result in both customers being ejected.  86'd in fact.  So according to the house's written policy that \\"will be supported by all employees\\" if someone attacks you, you'll both get chucked into the street so you can continue being assaulted without inconveniencing the bar staff.  This isn't tucked away in some corner so the bar's lawyers can talk about it, it's right by the door and the bar in a bright yellow framed sign. \\n\\nThe bar staff here seem to be well intentioned, I've been here before fairly recently when it wasn't that busy (I recall it one of the GOP debates was on, as was the Miss Hooters pageant. I couldn't bring myself to watch either) and the guy working that day was super nice.  On my third WS trip one of the bartenders came out to apologize for some b.s. that happened to a tablemate.  They hand out comment cards with the check.  But that policy, like the service and a lot of things here (are you supposed to criticize the server you hand the card back to?) just don't seem thought out that well.  None of it makes me want to come back."},{"name":"Flying Cat Coffee","address":"3041 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Stopped by at the suggestion of my daughter.

Since all the ingredients are stacked up, I  personally would have preferred the gravy on the side.The peach compote is also good, I suggest getting it on the side for a small upcharge.I also ordered grits on the side. The corn was a great addition, and they were creamy. There was a TV near the bar area so it was nice to be able to watch the game. My main complaint was the cramped feeling. If you're claustrophobic this is not the place for you! We were seated so close to the party next to us that we could hear each other's conversations very well. It also appeared that you still have to put your name on the list for bar seating. On a Sunday the average wait for 2 people is about 40 minutes. Valet is free, so have change for a tip. The food came out quick and hot, but staffing was poor. The waitress did the best she could, but she looked and seemed tired from the constant running around with hardly any help. I felt like I was bothering her when I needed something like a to go box or when they forgot my order of grits.

Also keep in mind that this is in the middle of the arcade and once you do get to the attendant's desk out in the front, be prepared to hear, more often than not, the wait time. Sometimes they can go for as long as an hour and a half - just saying that to put some perspective into how tiny this place is (25ish seats) and the amount of traffic it's able to draw. With that said, there's this handy app/website that you may have heard of called Yelp where you can check the wait times and put your name down on the waitlist. After you put yourself down on the waitlist, you can view how many parties are ahead of you in real-time. When you're about 5-10 minutes from being seated, the attendant will call you over to take your order outside so that your ramen order is nearly done once you sit down. The place can get kinda cramped so I wouldn't advise this place for any groups larger than 4.\\n\\nAs for the ramen, I ordered the Gantetsu Shoyu. The sliced and diced cha-shu was really flavorful and the broth was fantastic. The egg was pretty average and didn't blow me away, but what really impressed me was the texture of the satisfyingly chewy and supple noodles. It is a Sapporo ramen joint, but for some reason my bowl did not have as much corn as I would like which I find the sweetness essential for what can  be a rather concentrated broth. There will always be a question of whether this place is better than Santouka Back Bay and vice-versa.

The low-ish 3-star rating this place has is mostly due to all the hype around it's opening, and people's ridiculously high expectations, along with others who suffer from XLBIGUW (Xiao Long Bao I Grew Up With) whining about how it doesn't taste like that one.\\n\\nI didn't grow up with XLB, and have little to compare it to, but can tell you these taste really good, and have been much improved since they first opened. The dough is nice and light, without overpowering the inside. The inside has a nice spiced pork flavor that explodes with delicious broth when you put it in your mouth. \\n\\nAfter exploring the menu more, I've found I really like the individual Pork and Cabbage Bao, along with the Pork and Shrimp Noodle bowl. The veggie dishes are just OK, I wish they were better sides to go along with the individual Baozi. The bowl and veggies all have a great 'well-seasoned wok' flavor to them. The five-spice chicken is crave-worthy and a must-try alongside any meal here.

I was incredibly disappointed, both by the food and the attitude of the staff.  \\n\\nI'm really surprised to see so many good reviews for this place because everything I tried was pretty terrible.  Granted, I went for happy hour, so maybe the food on the regular menu is better?  The thing that was the most irritating is that the staff would ask about the food and then argue about it with us.  \\n\\nAnyway, I ordered the roast beef sandwich and a mini happy hour pizza with ricotta and asparagus.  The roast beef sandwich had a good flavor and would have been a hit if it wasn't for the fact that it was about 75% fat.  Definitely the fattiest roast beef I've ever eaten.  My mother also had the sandwich and didn't care for the kind of mushroom used (which was not specified on the menu).  We took a couple bites and left it at that, pushing it aside and happily continuing out conversation.  The waitress came over and asked about the barely touched sandwiches.  My mother explained that she just didn't care for the mushrooms and the waitress replied in a rude condescending tone (with everything enunciated like she was speaking to a small child) \\"Those are WILD mushrooms.  You must just not be used to that.\\"  I mentioned that the roast beef seemed excessively fatty and she snapped \\"well, it's roast beef, it's going to be.\\"  I know roast beef has fat, Hon, but there's a limit. \\n\\nNext we ordered the pizza hoping that might be a little better.  Nope.  it was possibly the blandest item I've ever been served.   It tasted like it hadn't been seasoned at all, not even with salt.  The only taste it had was unseasoned asparagus.  Again, the waitress comes by and asks how we like it.  We mentioned that it seemed a little bland and she says again in her condescending tone \\"That cheese is Ri-CO-TTA, I'm sure it's just different for you.\\"  As if the only reason someone wouldn't like their food is that they're too uncultured to even know what wild mushrooms or ricotta is.  \\n\\nI also ordered a soda while waiting for the pizza to come out and it turned into a very long wait.  I flagged down the waitress to see if she had forgotten my soda, and before I could even say anything she angrily snapped \\"Your food will be out in a minute!\\"  When I tried to remind her about the soda she seemed even more irritated and said \\"Oh, you want a soda now?\\"  Um, no, actually, I wanted a soda 15 minutes ago when I ordered one the first time.  \\n\\nA tip to the staff at the fireside- don't bother inquiring as to why a patron doesn't like the food if you're just going to argue with them.  Better just to keep your trap shut.  You guys sure have an attitude for a restaurant that can't even manage to do basic things like trim meat or salt your food."},{"name":"The Bancroft","address":"15 Third Ave","city":"Burlington","stars":"4","text":"I have food allergies for flavorings so I often go to high end steakhouse's to avoid any problems.\\nThis is not the case at The Bancroft.\\nI was able to get an entree that was free of toxins but come dessert time problems arose.\\nAlthough they claim to make the ice cream and sorbet themselves the nevertheless feel the need to add flavorings to them. \\nWhen I asked for simple fruit with cream they said they couldn't do it because the cream they \\"made\\" had flavorings in it as well!\\nThey made no offer to make some flavoring free cream either and I'm guessing it's because they don't actually make it at all. \\nRestaurants that use quality ingredients and seasonings have no need for flavorings.

That is where they are at right now for me.  I think they can do better.\\n\\nThe good:\\nBuilding: Both the interior and exterior look fantastic.  They are smoke free both inside and out.  There is plenty of seating, TV's are everywhere.\\nFood and Drink: 59 beers on tap. full bar and a large inviting looking menu.\\nStaff: Plenty of staff around.  Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about our menu questions.\\n\\nThe bad:\\nWings:  Duff's wings in Buffalo are the gold standard to which I judge all others.  They need to be served hot, be crispy, large and bring the heat but still have good flavor.  My wings came out warm instead of hot and were far from crispy.  The wings were very good size and the Island Inferno sauce, while not traditional in taste, brought the heat and had an island twist on the flavor.  They make such a big deal about their wings being baked, but because the skin is not crispy as advertised, I am not sure I would get the wings again.  The bleu cheese dip for wings has poor flavor and no chunks - one of the worst I have ever had.\\n\\nBeer: Their prices are high.  While not indicated anywhere, when I asked the server she said all craft beer that is 7% ABV and higher is a 13oz pour, all others are 16oz.  This means that higher ABV beers are not discounted for the $2 off on pints on Thursdays - dang, no discount at all?  They serve many craft beers @ $7.75 that other nearby places serve for only $6.  To give a specific example, I can get $6 16oz Jai Alai just down the street (BOGO during happy hour until 7pm!).  Here it is $7.75 for a 13oz glass.  Their alcohol pricing and/or specials need to at least compete with what is nearby to keep us and other locals coming back regularly.  Ignore it and become the next Wings & Rings or Jimmy Hulas.\\n\\nService:\\nThey still are learning in this area.  For all the staff, why does everything take so long?  Beers took 10 minutes to come out.  Someone besides our server brought the food out after a 35 minute wait.  Issue with wings plus missing fries took too long before someone even checked on us (yes, we had the little red X card up).  I ate my wings before they got cold and finished them before the fries we ordered finally came out.  Manager comped the fries by the way.\\n\\nOverall I can really see their potential and hope they take steps to build a repeat client base.  I can't wait to try some additional menu items because I see a lot of items I would like to try.  Work on the service and do something to make the beer & wine prices competitive for us and this could be a regular hangout for our group.

Both times, we got fast, efficient, and polite service. They were very eager to serve their patrons, very kind, and also very FAST. I think both times, we got our food within 10-15 minutes and it came out piping hot with steam rising from the dishes. \\n\\nFirst time, I had a pork vermicelli bowl. It was good. Keeping that in mind, it was not authentic. A Vietnamese Bun bowl is not a stir-fried mix of noodles lying atop a heap of cucumbers and lettuce. Usually, it's a small pile of boiled vermicelli noodles topped with a lemongrass pork mixture that is then topped with egg roll pieces, various herbal accoutrements such as chopped thai basil, mint, etc. bean sprouts, thinly sliced cucumbers, fried shallots, green onion saute....and then THAT is all topped off with the Vietnamese nuoc cham vinaigrette that has fish sauce, lime, sugar, bits of chili, garlic...\\n\\nBut, despite it being a bit greasy, it did in a pinch. The accompanying vinaigrette was interesting. They used lemon instead of lime...different flavor profile but whatever. The date ordered orange beef, also yummy and it came in a huge portion which he boxed up for later. \\n\\nThe second time, I had pho. It was good. Medium rare. It wasn't drowning in meat, came with an acceptable amount of vegetables, and tasted very good. It was not accompanied with fish sauce...which I notice isn't provided at a lot of the Allandale area Viet places...what gives? Very good aroma and it didn't need the dab of hoisin I added but I love hoisin and the resonance of it's sweet, salty umami is just something I cannot pass up. Very good and would definitely order it again here. My friend had a lunch special (soup+eggroll) with his General Tso's. It looked good but I was too busy eating my bowl to notice much else going on. \\n\\nThe interior is pretty nice with an interesting painting on one side of the restaurant.

Unfortunately, I think this dish is just too rich and heavy for our taste. We also had the blackened catfish, which was really really salty. Wish we had just stuck with the more traditional fried chicken (someone else in our group ordered this and I tried a bite and it was ok). We ordered the most popular side items to try: sweet potato souffle, fried green tomatoes, mac and cheese, and tomato pie. The sweet potato souffle is mashed sweet potatoes with marshmallows and syrup. It is really sweet and I just generally do not like this as a side item. The mac and cheese was not good - the kids wouldn't even eat it! The tomato pie was ok and interesting to try but I wouldn't get it again. The fried green tomatoes comes with three slices and I liked it. The kids had chicken strips with fries and fruit. It seemed ok. For dessert, we tried the georgia peach cobbler and bread pudding. The bread pudding was overly sweet. The peach cobbler is made with canned peaches and has a fluffy crust baked on top. The crust was decent but I was really disappointed with the canned peaches.\\n\\nOverall, i was not impressed and would not be happy if I had to wait hours to eat (which is why it took us so long to even try this place). Breads are good, skip the dessert. As for entrees, I would recommend the fried chicken and fried green tomatoes. Parking lot is small and also difficult.

We frequent and thoroughly enjoy other restaurants owned by the same parent company.\\n\\nHere are the details, and maybe we just went on a subpar night during the holiday season. For starters, our waitress was very nice and attentive but somewhat overly theatrical, if that makes any sense. I'm not sure if the restaurant pushes their wait staff to act this way but it was just a bit much. I guess the advice is to just be genuine and provide good service.\\n\\nThe food was really just average with higher than average pricing for the area. There was nothing wrong with the food or how it was cooked, but it didn't leave us looking forward to going back. Just being honest, and really not intending this to be an insult, but if you are going to charge that kind of money for a piece of meat in that area, you need to leave some sort of wow factor. Trying hard to not sound harsh but I recently enjoyed the same cut of meat at the Outback Steakhouse for a lot less money and if anything was better. I don't mind paying higher than average pricing but if you set your prices a certain way, then you need to deliver a higher than average experience. This left me wanting to go to Buckley's Great Steaks or hoping Del Frisco's Grill opened back up.\\n\\nThere is no place to wait to be seated if you don't want to sit at the bar. You can either stand near coat closets or right in front of the check-in counter, either way you are in the way and feel uncomfortable, especially if the bar is full. I feel like when you walk into a place is where the experience starts. When you are standing in front of coat closets near a tiny hallway that leads to the bathrooms and constantly being either asked to move by polite employees or people trying to sneak by to get to the bathroom you feel somewhat in the way, but there is nowhere else to go.\\n\\nSomething that didn't go against the review or factor in, but is useful for people to know: many of the rooms are loud when the restaurant is busy. Don't expect to have a party of 5 and be able to hear someone on the opposite side of the table. Everyone in my party was under 40 with the exception of one person. Speaking across the table was somewhat challenging. Also, none of us have any type of hearing impairment. I think it all depends on which room you are dining in.\\n\\nAnyways, wanted to give a much better review. I'm sure I'll go back at some point and hopefully have a better than average experience. My issue is if I wanted average I could have went to any chain restaurant. Again, not sure if it was a subpar night during a busy holiday season and nothing was bad of cooked incorrectly, it just didn't give us the wow factor we were expecting for the pricing."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"In the heart of downtown, everyone has heard about VooDoo Doughnuts.

The food at this location is subpar at best. The rice can be crunchy as a rock sometimes and the lettuce tastes as though it's been cycled day after day. If you are truly in desperate need of Tex mex cuisine and you find yourself stuck at this location you will most definitely walk out wishing you just went to the Chic Fila across the parking lot. The food is passable as edible but what makes this location the worst chipotle in existence is the atrocious customer service. If I could relate the customer service to anything I would say it's about the same level of customer service as a Popeyes. If you ever wanted to pay for your food and be given an attitude for coming in and inconveniencing the workers from their daily lives then by all means please come in to this location. The manager sits back and watches this disrespect cross his line and fails to lift a finger to reprimand his unruly employees. I would recommend for anyone wanting decent chipotle to avoid this location as though they were the last option. Go to anything else and you will be immensely happier with the service and food.

Nine years after my first review of this place, I think it is still a solid four stars.  Mary Mac's is a solid place to take out-of-towners to experience basic southern cooking.\\n\\nThe breads are still excellent.  A small cinnamon roll, yeast roll, and cinnamon roll are included in the price of your meal for each diner.  I'm usually not a fan of yeast rolls or cornbread, but I eat both here happily. \\n You also really don't need dessert because that cinnamon roll is so good.  And in fact, I would skip dessert in general.  I didn't really enjoy the bread pudding or the peach cobbler.  The bread pudding was almost too sweet and to cinnamon-y, with a weird, cloying, red tinged sauce poured all over it.  By contrast, the peach cobbler wasn't sweet enough, and there was no salty or crispy contrast from the mushy pastry.  \\n\\nHowever, the sides are EXCELLENT.  I rarely order an entree, and instead, make my meal of four \\"veggie\\" sides.  The ones I can heartily recommend are the tomato pie, cornbread dressing and gravy, mac and cheese, fried green tomatoes, squash souffle, sweet potato souffle, and any of the greens.  All of these are flavorful and very rich.  The portions are generous.  I can usually get two meals out of the four sides and take half my plate home for lunch the next day.  If you are a first-timer, ask for your complimentary cup of pot likker and cracklin' cornbread (the pot likker tastes like veggie bouillon broth).  \\n\\nMary Mac's is great for large groups, as each diner writes their order down on their own piece of order paper- there's no making mistakes and splitting checks is easy.  The service is speedy but not rushed.  There's limited free parking in the small lot directly behind their building, metered parking on Ponce, and limited free street parking in the residential area behind the restaurant.\\n\\nThe only thing that's changed is the prices.  You can now expect to pay $15+ for an entree and two sides.  While not exactly cheap, you can pay a lot more for a lot worse in the area."},{"name":"Heritage Golf Links","address":"4445 Britt Rd","city":"Tucker","stars":"3","text":"Definitely improvements made everywhere.

When I tell my friends that I'll visit Portland, they would always ask me to grab some pastries at Voodoo Doughnut. The business was founded in 2003 by Kenneth \\"Cat Daddy\\" Pogson and Richard \\"Tres\\" Shannon, both Portland natives. The idea of starting their own doughnut shop came up when the two friends were tubing down the Sandy River one fateful day. At the time, there were only five doughnut shops in Portland. They weren't familiar with the doughnut industry, and so they had to travel to California to learn from doughnut masters who had about 100 years of doughnut-making experience. Fast forward to today, Voodoo Doughnut has become synonymous with Portland. The business knows how to keep Portland weird through its creative doughnut flavors. Voodoo also has locations in Eugene, Denver, Austin, and LA.\\n\\nI don't have a strong opinion on whether or not it is worth the hype. The donuts aren't too shabby. In fact, I think their yeast donuts are fluffier and tastier than the average American doughnut. Definitely fresh. However, they are on the expensive side. I ordered the voodoo doll (raised yeast doughnut filled with raspberry jelly and topped with chocolate frosting and a pretzel stake). Lots of flavors to choose from (over 50)! For example, bacon maple bar, old dirty bastard, voodoo bubble, mango tango, etc.\\n\\nA few other notes... Yes, you can pay using debit/credit cards. Nope, no gluten-free doughnuts.

Sadly, we forgot to order XLB. \\n\\nPretty pricey for standard dishes that you can easily get in Chinatown. \\n\\nShrimp wonton with chili oil was a sad disappointment. Sure, the shrimp was there and the wrapping was silky soft, but it was just one bite. Usually wonton should be heavy with filling while still being encased in the wrap. Even with this dish being drowned in chili oil, it still lacked in flavor and needed the help of more chili. For the price of this dish having about 6 pieces or so, I definitely would skip. \\n\\nCold cucumber noodles was next on our table and that was so-so. I wasn't a fan of the vinegar sauce and the ingredients weren't incorporated well enough. Again, flavors lacked and needed the help of the chili oil.

It was set in a big bowl with lots of seafood and noodles. Paying almost the same price for my other two dishes, this one was clearly the winner.

It was actually perfect for us since we had a large group and could make use of their 12-person table up there. We all started by sharing appetizers and drinks. Thankfully, the servers were always around to tend to our needs so that made our dining experience even better. I thought the cocktails were great and the appetizers were tasty and unique. My favorite were the salmon chips, mostly because I wasn't really sure what to expect and they definitely surprised me the most flavor-wise. Not only was it delicious and unique, it was a good size portion to share amongst us all. For my entree, I ordered the scallops which were perfectly cooked. I highly recommend them! The creamy risotto it came with was also divine. My friends ordered the lobster which were good but very messy since you have to crack them yourself. It was fun to watch them struggle with cracking them--so fair warning to those who don't know how to crack them yourselves! \\n\\nAnd to end the evening, the staff went above and beyond and brought a little birthday dessert for my friend. It's always the little things that add up to make such an incredible evening! Overall, you can't go wrong with Two Urban licks for a wonderful dining experience!

I've never been a fan of ramen ever, and I definitely liked it here. \\n\\nThe wait wasn't too bad first couple of times I went, but after realizing that they have a waitlist on Yelp, it's definitely been much quicker to get a table. It's a decent size restaurant - you can either sit in the middle booth/bar-like style, or you can have your own table. Personally, I prefer sitting at my own table as I prefer my privacy and not having to sit next to a stranger. You could probably drive around and find street parking if not in front then just down the street. The parking right in front if only for 30 minutes, which is good because people are always leaving quickly so you'd be able to find a spot easily - and I honestly have never spent more than 30-45 minutes here anyways. \\n\\nTheir takoyaki and baos are standard, they're good appetizers, but my favorite starter would be the gyoza. My boyfriend thought the dipping noodles were good, but it does come with a very large portion of noodles which he got sick off after consuming 3/4 of the bowl and had to give up. I really like the way they make their eggs, a bit runny on the inside - it's not like those ramen places that just give you a hard boiled egg. I switch between the shio and miso ramens - I really like how they have different sizes because a small bowl of ramen is just enough to fill me up.

We had a reservation at 9pm for 10people for an outside table which they couldn't accommodate at the moment so we sat inside, shortly after sitting (before food was on table) a table for 10 opened up on the back patio area, asked if we could be moved to that table and was told we would have to get up and go back to the bar and wait for them to re set the table we were leaving before being sat at the new one outside? So they could sit another party there before us? Seems weird and just altogether wrong to have guests get up after being sat to go stand at the bar AGAIN when you could easily just go from that table to the other?

The flavors of the tartine both times were so clean and fresh and indulgent but not heavy. I couldn't recommend either more highly, they were really fantastic. I also lingered after lunch for a cappuccino and a plum tart. The cappuccino's foam was not as thick and dense as I like but given the fantastic service behind the counter and the phenomenal food, I was barely bothered. The tarts had a mild cream base that I believe was gelatinized and gorgeous rosy plums which were bursting with that sweet, succulent plum flavor with the very mildest tang. I haven't lingered so long over a pastry trying to prolong the experience in a long time.

Overall a great experience, just some things that need to be worked on.\\n\\nTo begin, I'm by no means an expert on Vegetarian food. I'm a person that understands the ethical dilemma of animal product consumption, and am expanding my view. However I'm a pretty widely experience \\"foodie\\" (cringe) for lack of a better word, so see this as almost a vegetarian food outsider's perspective on this kind of restaurant. With the disclaimer out of the way...\\n\\nBeautiful interior with only one weird design choice. The strange fans on the ceiling blow unequal air movement in certain directions. Also less efficient. Just a weird decision by the owners to go for these strange \\"desktop fans attached to ceiling fan mounts that don't move\\". Raised ceilings are overdone and create a lot of noise in the restaurant that can usually be unpleasant, but they did the smart thing and still used ceiling tiles (which have acoustic dampening capabilities) to reduce this effect. Other owners take note, this is the way to do it. The open raised ceiling with girders is always too loud and looks and becomes dirty too easily, so it was refreshing to see a bistro-style raised ceiling not go the early 2000's trendy route, and do something different. Seating is comfy, dining room had good spacing and an interesting layout. Bathrooms were clean.\\n\\nService-wise I felt like the timing of when the server checked in on us, the timing of food being delivered, was slightly slower than desirable. Nothing major. Overall very kind and compassionate servers, helpful, efficient, etc... Nothing major to complain about, just maybe a tad slow. I think more restaurants in the United States need to slow down anyways, so maybe this is just my own initial response due to a pre-existing bias in place.\\n\\nFood was great, but not perfect or highly executed, lacks a few minor things. Avocado Tartare was sort of bland, needed either more seasoning or more spice to the Pico de Gallo. Sweet Potato Gnocchi was excellent. I would probably add a touch more garlic to the pesto, again a bit under-seasoned overall. Creole Polenta was perfect! Serve it with a spoon though. Especially since we said we were sharing, it was bizarre not to get a spoon, but when we asked we got one, so no harm no foul, just a pointer. For dessert we shared a small slice of the Vanilla Cheesecake. This was kinda... meh. Nothing too amazing, didn't taste bad or anything, but doesn't stand out. I like the creative idea, but most \\"sub protein\\" style products in vegetarian food don't impress me that much. I'd rather them find a way to showcase vegetables and fruits as a dessert. I probably should have ordered the carrot cake in retrospect.\\n\\nWe had a Boulder Passport so we ordered two Summer Daze cocktails. Both were incredibly inconsistent compared to each other. Hearing the shaking technique at the bar I could tell drinks were undershaken with not full ice. The Collins glass I received was very wide, not the traditional thin and tall. Ice wasn't from the bottom to the top, there was an ice deadzone at the bottom. The drinks both had inconsistent color and distribution of ingredients throughout. They required us to squeeze the orange wedge in them to be pleasant to drink. My wife's same drink was over dilluted (meaning not enough ice used in shaking) and under-representing the ingredients that weren't whiskey. Mine was almost entirely juice with almost no taste of whiskey. Every cocktail on the menu is practically soda water, juices, tiny bit of bitters, and a spirit. It's not a very creative or varied menu in execution of styles.\\n\\nI think a vegetarian restaurant actually has a ton of potential in the cocktail space. My advice to the owners or the bar manager is to read \\"Cocktail Science in General\\" Parts 1 and 2 by Dave Arnold with regards to proper ice control, Liquid Intelligence with regards to ratios, and Bar Book by Jeffrey Morgenthaler for technique improvement... and adjust the bar program. Then you all should take a tour of Frasca, Emmerson, and Blackbelly's cocktail programs to get an idea of what high-end cocktail execution is for similar pricing to yours. Like many restaurants, the cocktails seem to be an afterthought, and they shouldn't be.\\n\\nEither way, minor areas that could be improved, but overall a very pleasant and satisfying experience and we will be back!"},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Came here for some good ol' Southern food and was not disappointed in the slightest.

Complex in that you could taste every layer of ingredient in every bite, from the earthy mushrooms, to the delicate, buttery pasta, to the almost astringent fresh basil, to the sharp parmesan.  Hubby's lasagna was also \\"Harry Met Sally\\" moanin good.  And both entrees were accompanied by fresh greens and house made vinigarette as well as more of their homemade bread (carbophobics beware!). \\n\\nAnd then the accordianist started.  She was terrific, playing all the squeezebox hits from \\"Oh Sole Mio\\" to \\"Moonriver\\".  It turned our rushed meal into a romantic dinner.  Hubby and I actually googlied our eyes at each other. It changed my whole attitude.  And all this great food and an attitiude adjustment (and 2 Lone Stars for hubby) was $39.  \\n\\nSo, 1000 stars for unexpected bliss in the middle of a crappy day.  I'm sure my late patient enjoyed my new relaxed attitude (if not my garlicky breath).  And I was able to stare down the rest of my night with the warmth of a good, wholesome meal in me.  \\n\\nLike Lloyd Dobber says, \\"I don't want to sell anything, buy anything, or process anything as a career.

This is actually a pretty decent place if you have guilty pleasures of indulging in a burger but without the costs of having that crappy feeling it comes with it.

It is more on the expensive side. Knocking a few stars down because it's always 50/50 when you receive your food it's just warm and your fries are half crispy and half soggy. They have their own beet ketchup and chipotle aioli. Personally I'm not a fan of the beet ketchup. I'm all for the chipotle aioli though!

From the dated brass lanterns from Habitat for Humanity hovering over the community table to the black furniture offcuts, custom charred with a cactus torch to the reclaimed and pickled wood tables and chairs, Lenoir is a thoughtful innovator's wet dream with the renovation AND the food.\\n\\nMichelle C. made reservations a couple days after they opened, and the soonest we could get in was day 10.  Dining with M to the C and her handsome husband is ALWAYS a treat, but this was our annual New Year dinner -the one where we say what we will create for the coming year over wine and tender vittles.\\n\\nThis is the first year in which M to the C was SO distracted with the tastes and flavors that she completely evaded and avoided most of the conversation.  Palate skillz, that one.  She called it, \\"Venison Distraction.\\"\\n\\nLet me explain.  Choose 3 courses for $30... any three.

If you want to eat dinner elsewhere and come here with a couple friends and order all 3 desserts, so be it.

They were just forgettable and bland. Otherwise, everything above is repeatable. Menu changes often, but we would beg to keep the Venison and the Shrimp constant in some form as they both stole the show.\\n\\nService was attentive and friendly and perfect. Owners are very present, chefing or serving and were pleasant and eager to discuss what we liked and disliked.\\n\\nBottle of Grenache Clos de Gilroy, where they have the yearly garlic festival, awesome at $36.  After discussing the area of CA where garlic is king, the power of suggestion caused me to taste that high-pitched raw garlic in these grapes, but mind you, Michelle can be highly suggestive.\\n\\nFresh press decaf Casa Brasil coffee served with dessert.

They were on numerous \\"Best of...\\" lists all over the internet, including being in the top 10 of The Daily Meal's Best Fried Chicken Restaurants, so OF COURSE we just had to visit.\\n\\nMy wife and I came by on the day after July 4th at about 2PM and, as expected, they were really busy. Luckily, they have a huge parking lot in the back, so parking wasn't an issue at that time of the day. The first thing we noticed when we were walking to the restaurant was how long it was. It was one of the longest restaurants we had ever been to, spanning half of a really, really long street. Little did I know, but the restaurant was comprised of multiple large dining rooms, resulting in its large size.\\n\\nWhen we walked in, there were already plenty of people waiting. We put our name down on the waitlist and, shockingly, within 5 minutes we were already seated at a table. No magic tricks, no hypnosis, no threats - I guess we were just seated ahead of others because we were a party of 2? Right timing? Either way, we were glad that we were able to eat our late lunch asap. We were greeted by a nice waitress, who gave us the rundown on the long menu. The menu had southern comfort written all over it. There were your typical soups, salads and appetizers, followed by the Southern Special, which looked like some type of all you can eat option (or at least it said that), or some type of meal where you can order multiple entrees, sides and desserts for parties of 2 or more. In addition, there was also a list of over 20 entrees in another section called Traditional Southern Specialties and all of them came with 2 sides and yeast rolls/corn bread. \\n\\nOh, and did I mention the sides? To be exact, there are 36 on the menu so there's literally something for everyone! There were a lot of typical Southern sides, like Mac and Cheese, Fried Okra, Collard Greens, but there were also things like Hoppin' John, Cornbread Dressing & Gravy, Broccoli Souffle, Butter Peas and Sweet Potato Souffle that I had never heard of. Maybe they're common in the south?\\n\\nSince we were here for fried chicken and fried chicken ONLY, we found the perfect entrees to choose and mark down. Yes, they provide an order form and pencil for diners to write down what they want. Honestly, I like it because it saves time for us. I ordered the Fried Chicken entr√©e, which came with either 3 legs or 1 breast, of which I chose 3 legs. My sides were the potato salad and mac and cheese. My wife ordered the Four-piece Fried Chicken, which came with a breast, wing, leg and thigh with no substitutions. Her sides were the fried green tomatoes and collard greens. In summary, the fried chicken was delicious. Perfectly fried, hot out of the oil and juicy meat inside. The skin was a little light colored, which is usually a sign that it wasn't fried long enough, but the skin was crispy and very crunchy. The flavor was just right too. As for the sides, the fried green tomatoes and collard greens were excellent, especially the fried green tomatoes. There were only 3 pieces of the tomatoes, but they were huge. The potato salad and mac and cheese were good too. The mac and cheese was oven baked and very traditional in the Southern comfort sense.\\n\\nBesides the fried chicken, we also started with an order of Deviled Eggs, which were good, but nothing extraordinary. They were your average deviled eggs. \\n\\nThe bottom line is that your focus should be on the fried chicken and sides when you step in because it is that damn good. It's tough to say whether this was THE best fried chicken we ever had, but it was definitely one of the best. Typically we associate fried chicken with fast food restaurants (KFC, Popeyes, Raising Canes, etc) and those fast food restaurants are great at it, so serving fried chicken at restaurants is typically unnecessary, but Mary Mac's is definitely worth the extra few bucks and time if you really love your southern fried chicken."},{"name":"The Ocoee Taco Company","address":"40 Taylor St","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4.5","text":"Oficially a regular customer at this place!!

On the outside it's hardly noticeable save for a few people smoking butts or waiting at giacomos next door. However, this place somehow elevates dive bar food to a level that will make you think twice about what you're eating at the other places after coming here. No burgers, chicken wing dings, or other greasy food here; just ridiculously delicious Italian food that makes washing it all down with beer that much better.\\n\\nThe place is small yet cozy with booth seating and some awkward center tables as its dining area is in the back of the restaurant.  Service is quick, prompt and not pushy. If it's busy you don't really want to be lounging back there anyways when you can just chill at the long bar right after. \\n\\nThe food is what is worth it though, the truffle fries are a must buy because they stay crispy and light. The penne pasta with shrimp in a puttanesca sauce is also a steal of a deal with the portion size and amount of shrimp given (9 shrimp in a pasta dish for $14?!!! Amazing!!) the gnocchi in the bolognese is light yet filling with robust tomato flavor. The chicken parmigian is good, but not something rave worthy considering so many places make this. I haven't even gotten to try everything here yet because I love my set things too much to stray and take a risk. Anchovies is open late as well which helps bring a diverse crowd of people at all times of the night.  Yet what seems universal is that everyone loves Anchovies for its food and drink. It's one of the best kept secrets in Boston but I hardly think that will be the case soon. Unless of course Bostonians don't like eating great food for cheap . . .

When a new highly anticipated place opens in your hood, when you watch the brown paper come off the widows and see the beautiful new interior after a year of teasing us with tacos and tequila, you expect to get knocked off tour feet. Well that didn't exactly happen. That said, the place is still decent and has tacos and tequila and is one block from where I live, so I will be back many times and keep trying and I have a feeling my rating might go up. \\n\\nThe place was crowded on a Friday night of their first official week but we got a table quickly.  No reservations for small parties. The service was friendly but a little clumsy. We ordered everything at once and the apps and everything came out at the same time. Drinks came about 15 minutes later. After a little table reorg we fit all of the plates on there. Street corn was great and guacamole was edible but why not make it fresh at the table, that's what the people want. Is there anything better. Instead it came pre made in an ugly dish. Didn't taste bad though but nothing spectacular. Chips were stale and tasteless. That's a no no. The tacos were ok. Again not knocked off my feet. These days I expect a smorgasbord of flavors in a taco but that didn't happen. Chicken mole taco yes, halibut taco absolutely awful. Either do that one better or just do a regular fish taco. Really no good. \\n\\nNo desserts yet, hopefully soon. No tequila chaser or sangrita and no Ingredients to make it. Kind of disappointing. \\n\\nOverall it was ok. If it wasn't a block from my home, I wouldn't go back. There's better elsewhere. But I'm a captive audience. I hope they'll keep improving.

The gentleman at the host stand (owner? Manager?) was very pleasant and polite. When we were sat, we waited about 10 minutes to even be acknowledged by the server. Yes they were busy, but she was just standing in the corner by the POS system chatting half of the time. When she finally came over, we ordered everything at once, drinks, apps and entrees because I figured it might be a while before we saw her again. She brought over our drinks and that was the last interaction we had with her. Other employees dropped off all of our food a timely manner, our waitress never came over again. We waited literally 30 minutes after finishing everything on the table for a check, and there was no pre bussing done or second drinks offered. Luckily, the waitress in the next section came over to clear our plates and I asked if we could please have our check. I overheard her telling another table it was her first night serving, and she was way better than our waitress. We must've made eye contact with her a solid 10 times but I guess she didn't have to common sense to check on her tables or see if a table wants their check after being at the table for over an hour. The table behind us was also annoyed because they were sat, brought drinks and then had been waiting about 15 mins to be checked in on by the time we left and still no sign of the server. I tipped 10% for the first time in my life as I am also a server and usually tip over 20%, but this girl had an awful attitude, was totally clueless and clearly didn't care about her job or guests. Another big strike was the fact that she was wearing her hair down and not pulled back like you are supposed to in a restaurant to prevent getting hair in food. So gross.

The location is super convenient for me, especially since there are not a lot of options otherwise.  This was my 3rd try I gave Rosie's.  It was early.  I could tell I was the first person to arrive however the door window says they opened at 7.  You could tell I caught them by surprise, nothing was set up.  The coffee was made thankfully but there was not cream or sugar out for Customers.  The cashier was trying to get all the TV's on.  I could hear the cashier talking to the person in the back about the oven not being turned on yet.  \\nThis review is not about food. I have personally never thought to get food because I just want a good cup of coffee in the morning.  Sadly, each coffee I have ordered has been a huge disappointment.  I have never had an employee there be able to tell me anything about the coffee.  That is a big deal in this day and age to call yourself a coffee shop but not be able to tell the story of what you are brewing.  Each coffee I have ever had tasted like dirt water.  You can't be a coffee shop if you are just buying whatever Cisco foods or PFG has on their inventory list.  If I am paying $2 for a coffee everyday, I like to know where it's from, how it's brewed, why Rosie's bought it and so on. \\nOn another note, I wanted to truly stay skeptical about the place but after looking up their website, it's nothing!  They have a 'testimonial' from a Customer stating she passed by Rosie's for YEARS and finally gave it a shot.  Honey, this place has been open for just barely a year.  If you're going to lie it least make it reasonable.  Plus, after reading about others experiences and seeing how the response was after a 2 year old was choking on bones of a fish filet, I am just done with this place.

Used to be a regular and as a German speaker and someone who lived in Germany I would tell everyone I knew about this place. Now I make sure to tell everyone why NOT to come here! Last time I went and took my family I swear I have never been treated more rudely or with just flagrant disrespect by the staff of any establishment. We had been waiting half an hour to be seated. Completely ignored by the staff the entire time. One table had paid and were sitting there with empty cups and one person in the group sitting on the edge of the seat holding their jacket like they were leaving. About ten minutes went by and they still didn't get up. We were next on the list (I had checked) for a table so I asked them (while a waitress was chatting with them) if they are leaving soon since we were waiting for the table. The group got angry (there were two swigs of beer left in one cup apparently) and the waitress immediately started yelling at me about how I needed to wait my turn. I apologized, stepped back, and kept waiting for a table. Then the bartender gave the table a free round of beers and the manager came over and told them (loudly so we could hear) that they should definitely stay much longer so that we couldn't get the table. Then another table opened up and another waitress went to check the list and ask who was next. We said us. The first waitress dashed past us to whisper something while giving us a dirty look. They turn to a couple that had just arrived and told them it was their table. The couple said \\"no it's them. We just got here\\". The waitress insisted it was their table. It was clear we would not be seated. All because I said \\"hey are you guys leaving soon?\\" To a group that had paid ten minutes ago and were holding their jackets, clearly about to leave. I'd like to also point out that interestingly, we were the only minority family in the place. Coincidence, I think not.

The fried chicken wings were juicy but I wish it had a seasoning flavor on it. The taste was sorta bland.

I'm a huge meat lover, but I would come back here over and over again. The place is pretty big with inside and outside seating. We got there on a Sunday morning and got seated almost right away. They have really cool artwork throughout the entire restaurant and made the atmosphere very welcoming. Our server was also very helpful and suggested what dishes he liked best and told us if we've never had vegan cheese before, to just stick with normal cheese. \\n\\nJOE'S SMOKIN' OMELET ($10.50): This had cheddar jack cheese, sauteed organic spinach, and onions topped with chipotle pecan pesto. You had a option of choosing scrambled tofu or egg and you get 2 sides. Try the scrambled tofu!! You'll think to yourself why you've never had this before. This whole dish had so much flavor and the chipotle pecan pesto was to die for. I wish they put more of that sauce on the tofu. It wasn't chunks of tofu, but instead the texture was just like scrambled eggs. \\n\\nTIP: Drench your food in their habanero sauce on the table. It is called \\"Yellowbird Sauce\\" and it has the perfect amount of spicyness to it. If you put enough, you're mouth will taste a good amount of spice, but it's that good spicy pain. Totally worth it!"},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Super fun Atlanta restaurant. Love the cool warehouse/industrial feel. To be honest, the first thing when I walked into the space was the smell of their rotisserie chicken. If i went again, and I would if I lived in Atlanta, I would chose another entree. The chicken was just okay, nothing special(hard to live up to that aroma). What was special was the starters we had. The Oysters Rockefeller and the salmon on a potato chip was fantastic (that's not the name of the appetizer, but close enough). The salmon chips were like nothing I've ever had and they were amazing.

Two waiters came by to ask for our drink order and 15 minutes later, we still had no water. Our server was literally leaning on the doorway, right in front of our table outside, and did not even lift a finger when my boyfriend's drink had been empty for the whole meal. Only when they were about to bring our check, he lazily asked us if we needed more water and then proceeded to fill up the other tables' almost-full glasses first (who, might I add, were receiving much attention the whole time they were there...racist? maybe). \\nI worked as a server, I know how it is, but they were blatantly ignoring us the whole time. I never leave without tipping, but their horrible service could not make up for their delicious food. \\nRight when I felt guilty about leaving no tip, one of the 'crazy' ladies who I'm presuming owns the place runs out to the porch, and in front of all her other customers, she exclaims \\"NO TIP??? Why no tip????\\" Hey, it's is a legitimate question so I answer her \\"hey you know, you couldn't even serve us simple water and just ignored us the whole time.\\" Then her male counterpart runs out and yells \\"You give no tip???\\" I calmly try to reexplain the whole story, but they interrupted me with \\"I gave you water!!! hahaha have a nice day\\" and \\"GET OUT GET OUT!

Fry also owns nearby JCT Kitchen, King + Duke in Buckhead, and No. 246 in Decatur.  JCT and No. 246 are excellent restaurants, among Atlanta's best, so it shouldn't have surprised me when I found The Optimist right up there with them.\\n\\nThe Optimist is named after a sailing dinghy.  The restaurant is located in an unassuming part of Westside near other hotspots such as Bocado, Le Fat, Bartaco, and Miller Union.  Outside, the restaurant has a small lawn with lawn chairs, small table seating, and 3 holes of mini golf.  You can grab putters and balls inside from the hostess.\\n\\nThe restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside is awesome.  It's divided into 2 areas: (1) the oyster bar and (2) the dining room.  The day's oysters are on display at the oyster bar and you can only eat most of these oysters at the bar.  They aren't available in the main dining room.  If you eat at the bar, you can watch the oysters being freshly shucked.  Also at the bar is a wood-burning oven decorated with octopus tentacles.  There's small table seating in the \\"oyster bar\\" section of the restaurant, so you can have a quiet meal there if you want.\\n\\nMost of the action happens inside the large dining room.  It's a very cool-looking, open, and tall space with a viewable kitchen on one end and a beautiful, lit-up bar on the other.  One thing I really like about the layout is there's not a bad seat in the house.  Every seat has a good view.  Like No. 246, there's a finishing table in front of the kitchen.\\n\\nOn a busy day/night, which is pretty much every day, the tables are tucked cozily together.  You may be sitting very close, within point-blank earshot, to those dining next to you.  The atmosphere is loud (but not too loud) and energetic.  The individual restrooms have a playful design with numbered doors, like a game show.\\n\\nLike many of Fry's restaurants, The Optimist's menu is seasonal and constantly changing.  Your favorite dish from your last visit might not be available on your next visit, but one constant is certain: seafood.  Oysters, shrimp, crab, scallops, mussels, octopus, squid, and all sorts of fish prepared in any number of ways, from raw to cooked.  Most of the fish is wood-roasted.\\n\\nPrices are expensive.  A single oyster will set you back about $3.00-$3.50.  Roughly speaking, appetizers are $8-14, fish entrees $25-30, and desserts $8-10.  A multi-course meal with drinks adds up quick.\\n\\nEverything I've tried has been phenomenal.  It includes:\\n\\nEast coast oysters from Quivett Creek, MA\\nWest coast oysters from Sister Point, WA\\nMussels with green curry broth, bird's eye chili, and herbs\\nGeorges Bank Scallops with smoked shortrib and brown butter chicken jus\\nMonkfish with summer corn relish, pancetta, and blistered shishitos\\nBoston cream pie, vanilla ice cream, cocoa nibs\\n\\nThe east coast oysters I tried were larger and brinier than the west coast oysters.  The smaller west coast oysters were sweeter.  Both types were fresh and succulent, melt-in-your-mouth quality.  If you really like oysters, order a sampler.  The oysters come with fresh horseradish and housemade mignonette, which is cilantro heavy.\\n\\nAlmost everything at the restaurant is housemade, except for two types of bread.  The dinner rolls are out of this world.  They are served buttered and salted.  The outside of the rolls is buttery and consistently crispy, while the inside is fluffy soft.  To date, best dinner rolls I've had.\\n\\nThe mussels are served in a green curry broth, which I believe has coconut milk too.  The bird's eye chili (Thai chili) and herbs (basil) give this app an obvious Southeast Asian flair, like Thai coconut soup.  The mussels are plump and the broth is delicious on its own.  A slice of buttered toast also accompanies this flavorful dish.\\n\\nThe scallops are spectacular.  Slightly charred and cooked in a sweet, semi-thick brown sauce, the silky smooth scallops pair well with the savory short rib slice.  Green and purple muscadines also accompany this dish to add a layer of fruity flavor.\\n\\nMonkfish is sometimes referred to as the poor man's lobster because of the fish meat's lobster-like consistency.  It's a white fish that's certainly meaty.  The corn relish is refreshing.  Two spicy Japanese shishito peppers are served with the fish.\\n\\nA Boston Cream Pie is a cream-filled, chocolate-frosted cake.  The Optimist's version includes a scoop of ice cream and cocoa nibs, which are raw, unsweetened chocolate chips.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a good cocktail, the Damson in Distress has 4 types of alcohol: plum-infused Lunazul blanco, Damson Gin Liqueur, plum bitters, and Prosecco.  It's tangy and doesn't taste strong.\\n\\nThis is a great restaurant for special occasions and to take out-of-town guests.  Reservations are recommended.  Book on OpenTable for free dining points.

Couldn't do it via the site or opentable due to the party size. Each time I called there was no answer, left VMs (no call back), finally after a week \\"Steve\\" answered, he was suppose to pass my info to Laila (she books parties of 10 or more) 2 days passed, nothing from her either. So I decided to physically go to the location to make a reservation. Who does that in 2015??? \\n\\nBusiness One on One - Once a new establishment is publicized, PR should be taking all inquiries and at Scales' stage, there should be a receptionist manning the phone 24/7! How do you expect to make money if no one's taking phone calls, answering questions, living and breathing the business for ATLEAST the first year? It's going to take dedication on everyone's part.\\n\\nOnce I arrived, I was greeted by the hostess who was nice. I told her what had occurred (no apologies) but she informed me that Scales did not take weekend reservations. Huh? She suggested that I arrive early because tables would be on a first come, first serve basis. Please tell me which new restaurant would not want to SECURE business for a group of 20 when they literally just opened 4 days ago??? \\n\\nI then toured the location which is quite lovely, I could see myself going there often. Its 3 stories, the main floor is beautifully decorated, second floor space can be used for private events, then there's the rooftop. As another reviewer stated the elevator was extremely hot, rooftop furniture looked inexpensive, and they need more high tables + table toppers for those who prefer not to receive bottle service in order to sit. \\n\\nAs I was leaving I spoke with the hostess again and the manager on duty I believe, not sure because he did not introduce himself (tall well dressed older man that looks like a bouncer). I asked him why they were not accepting reservations on the weekend, he didn't give me a solid response but told me to email Laila. Told him I was currently expecting a call back from her, HE DID APOLOGIZE, but in so many words told me to try her via email. I would have expected him to apologize, pull out a card, and reassure me that this would be taken care of at the very least.\\n\\nScales 925 has a tremendous amount of potential. It's in a prominent area, very nice ambiance, and the community WANTS to support the owner. But if the service is not right, none of the other stuff will matter.

The meals do not come with the egg roll or with fried rice and they do not allow substitution on the rice.  (Not even for an up charge - you actually have to buy a side of fried rice if that is what you want)  Personally I don't like white rice - so the vegetable fried rice (which my dad and I shared) added $9.00 to the bill.  The egg rolls, I believe, were $5.00 each.   the meals were $10 - $12.00.    The sodas are bottled (12 oz bottle) - so I'm guessing no refills - we actually didn't ask as we were satisfied with the one bottle - but it is something to note as it is not the norm in this area.  \\n\\n The bill for the 3 of us was around $60\\n\\nI'm sure we will go back .. though considering the price not as often as we would if the pricing were more in line with other Chinese restaurants in the area.\\n\\nJust a note - it's a little difficult to find as it is small and there is a tree right in front of the restaurant in the shopping plaza.  don't let that stop you from looking.  It's right behind the 7-11."},{"name":"1618 Asian Fusion","address":"1618 East Riverside Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"This place was really beyond expectations.

I ordered a chicken arepa and a mango smoothie with milk. I paid the gentleman with cash, asked him to place the remaining amount in the tip jar and got no receipt. After waiting 25 minutes I approached the counter and asked for the status of my meal. I was then told by the counter lady that the order was not placed but they would get it out for me quickly. I was then asked if I paid, I told her that I had but the order taker never gave me a receipt. After she had gone to the back to fix my order another employee approached me with the same question...did you pay and I told her yes. The employees made me feel as if I had stolen from them. \\n\\nWhen I got the food I left as quickly as possible because I was so embarrassed that the employees would question me versus the order taker. When I started to drink the smoothie I realized that they massed it with water instead of milk, this was an additional charge that I paid for and didn't get. I then opened up the bag with the arepa and immediately smelled that it was burnt. My ENTIRE meal went to the trash.

We waited about a month before going so the kinks would be worked out (based on some of the reviews we read).  We've been twice in one week now and we love it!  First, I have to say that we received Excellent customer service - all of the waitstaff are friendly, helpful and patient.  One brought my six year old son 3 of their kid-friendly drinks to sample so he could know what they tasted like and choose.  My husband likes to substitute stuff and they rolled with it (and got the order right).  The Salsa is good, and so is the queso.  The enchiladas are what you are looking for in tex-mex.  We tried the sopapillas and they were big fluffy, crispy  goodness with honey, powedered sugar and cinnamon sprinkled on top.  \\n\\n My favorite thing so far is the Huevos Rancheros!  I am a HUGE fan of that dish and mexican breakfasts in general, so I order it lots of places and have a broad base of comparison.  I have to say it is in my top 3 favorites - the ranchero sauce was wonderful and not some afterthought slopped onto the eggs (which were cooked exactly right).  The tortillas were hot and plentiful, too.  Brunch took a pleasant but surprising turn when a mariachi band showed up - they were talented but not too intrusive - very pleasant.

The reviews seem to be kind of hit or miss; either it's your cup of tea/queso or it is not, it seems. \\n\\nDriving up, the parking lot is packed and some vehicles had begun to park on the lawn next to the restaurant; however, there was no wait for us. We were immediately seated in a corner booth. Walking in, my first impression was, \\"God, oh, dear God, it is quite loud in here.\\" We were seated and the mariachis began. My boyfriend, stricken with a headache looked up at me with a blank stare. We considered leaving.\\n\\nWe were tended to swiftly. And when I say swiftly, I mean they almost seemed to be on a mission to get us out of there. The menu is huge so it took about five minutes for me to decide. I heard about the chorichicken burrito and saw some good testimonies regarding their fajitas and their green sauce on the enchiladas, but I decided to try the chicken chimichanga to see how it compared to Trudy's, which is a great Tex-Mex place just down the road.\\n\\nOur drinks came out fast, the salsa was great, the chips were of an interesting texture. It was like they were stale but they threw it in the fryer to revive them, which kind of just left the paper in the chip basket a little greasy. The salt didn't stick to them, which means they had been fried a time back. This did not keep me from eating them.\\n\\nThe chimichanga was not your usual chimichanga. The filling seems to be strictly chicken- a mix of dark meat and white meat chicken that had been rolled verrrry tightly (almost resembling a large flauta or a chimichanga about half the size you are used to). Despite the size, this plate will fill you up because of how much meat is packed in there. But because the chicken filling didn't seem to be seasoned or mixed with anything, like cheese or chiles or anything...the flavor quota sort of fell flat. This chimichanga is drowning in queso. The rice is eh, the beans are eh. I liked the guacamole they included on the side with the pico de gallo. Very nice, I could taste the lime. \\n\\nIt was an average meal in itself. I told my boyfriend I'd give him a 5/10 for the food alone.\\n\\nWe just don't prefer the loud atmosphere. It is almost impossible to speak to the person across from you, and other people in the restaurant get...interactive with the mariachis, to say the least. The waiting experience was something I had never experienced. Due to the volume inside the restaurant, the waitress kind of just pointed at our food, raised her eyebrows, cocked her head to the side and gave us an inquisitive thumbs up to check if the food was good. The food was fine, but what if I did actually have a problem? I would have had to have a pow wow in the bathroom with her or something to let her know what was going on because of the noise.\\n\\nI *might* come back here again. The noise isn't SO horrible, but it was definitely on my mind the whole time.\\n\\nIn all, we were probably actually only in here for 15 minutes. It was a really quick visit, and the whole experience from walking out my front door to walking back in after the meal was a quick half an hour. I suppose if I have a craving for some Tex-Mex STAT, I will head over to Jalisco's. \\n\\nBut at the end of the day, I'd rather be sitting in a booth at Trudy's."},{"name":"Korita Sabor Casero","address":"5800 NE Mlk Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"This place is a hidden gem.

They're quinoa based and I don't know what it is about them but they're fantastic. I never have a want or craving for a meat patty when I'm here - just the opposite, in fact;  I find that I like their burgers less without the veggie patty.\\n\\nThey offer two options for their burgers, a junior or double. I find that the junior option is pretty small and not very filling - the double (two patties) is a much better deal.\\n\\nI'm also quite a fan of their pimento cheese...mmmm...I always order a side/entree featuring it - and it never disappoints. This past visit I had the 'Dixie' burger, and they didn't skimp on the pimento cheese. It was tasty, there was a nice, subtle kick and the patties were tender - if you don't specify, the meat is usually cooked to medium rare (which is how I prefer it anyway). \\n\\nThe sides are pretty standard, onion rings, crinkle-cut fries - they're decent. My favorite are the sweet potato fries - flavorful and crispy! \\n\\nNow, on to the shakes, oh those boozy shakes! I'll admit they were the draw for my first visit a few years ago. They're made pretty strong, so if you're worried about it being two sweet - you're definitely getting your money's worth of liquor.  This last visit I had their \\"handspun milkshakes\\" for the first time - honestly I was expecting something along the lines of a McFlurry, but I really enjoyed it. I tried the peach and the peanut butter flavors, they're quite thick - more ice cream than shake (I had mine with a spoon), but tasty! Especially the peach.\\n\\nI love the aesthetic of the restaurant - a sort of industrial chic with pin-up girls and robots errrrywhere.

I love the way this restaurant is designed. It combines modern and industrial styles. They only offer valet parking and it can be a little tricky to find. You have to drive in and head to the back of the lot and then go up a ramp. There is no charge for valet, but they do work off of gratuities. So please don't forget to bring cash for a tip!\\n\\nThe food was pretty good. We started off with the infamous salmon chips and brisket empanadas appetizers . Surprisingly, the empanadas were delicious and waaaaay better than the salmon chips. The salmon chips had too much cream added and it was overpowering. I literally had to scape it off in order to make them somewhat edible. Maybe it was an off night. I usually order them from their sister restaurant-Serpas and they are always perfect there.  Anyway, don't skip out on the empanadas! The brisket was to die for.\\n\\nWe ordered the lobster and steak entr√©es with a side of Mac and cheese. Do not, I repeat, do not order the lobster if you hate curry and cumin flavors like I do! The lobster was prepared well but it was a waste since it was completely marinated in cumin seasoning. The steak and mac and cheese was scrumptious! \\n\\nThe waiter said she didn't want to show us the dessert menu because she doubted we would have room. I think that was just her way of warning us to avoid them at all costs. We tried the pound cake and deconstructed smores dessert. They were both terrible! I do not know how you mess up pound cake, but they have somehow figured out a way to do so. It had a weird after taste and a consistency of dirt. Yeah do as the waiter insinuated and don't bother!\\n\\nAll in all, the service was near perfect and you can't beat the ambiance. They can easily host large groups here due to the abundance of large tables and there is even a room in the back that is perfect for large parties. This is an ideal spot for a night out with friends or an intimate date night with a loved one.

I ordered the Hot Brown (as it's apparently their special and you can't get it at other non-dwarf house Chick-Fil-A restaurants and my boyfriend ordered the steak as you also cannot get it at other non-dwarf house Chick-Fil-A restaurants.  I could hardly finish my Hot Brown as it wasn't good on any level.  It contained pieces of old tasting breaded chicken, smothered in white, chunky goop.

There's a new Asian restaurant in town. 1618 Asian Fusion is casual, inviting and most importantly, has excellent food! They're not \\"fusion\\" per se, because all the dishes are quite authentic but they serve dishes from various Asian countries very, very well. We had the sampler appetizer and it was beautifully presented in a wicker platter with fresh spring rolls, fried spring rolls, a couple of pork belly buns, fried wontons and chicken satay. It came with 4 different sauces which were all freshly made. They definitely did not come from a bottle. They even garnished with edible little flowers! We also ordered pad Thai which rivaled my own except I don't have to slave for hours to make it. The orange chicken was excellent and I don't normally eat this because they're usually so sickly sweet and covered in tons of dough. Not at 1618 Asian Fusion. Theirs was lightly breaded and the sauce was tangy and not syrupy. I would also do this restaurant a complete injustice if I didn't mention that they have the most \\"whole fish\\" menu items I've ever seen. Some Asian restaurants will have one and it's seasonal and on special. They have about 5 different whole fish in different preparations from their fish tank in the back! You read that right. They have a fish tank. You can't get fresher than that without getting a fishing pole and catching it yourself. I chose the striped bass and it came fried to perfection. Super crispy outside but tender and juicy inside. It was easy to pull it apart with chopsticks and dipped in the citrusy chili sauce that it came with. There was also a mango slaw that was the perfect accompaniment to the fried fish.\\n1618 Asian Fusion is so new they haven't had their grand opening yet. They have live music on Friday nights and Saturday nights which I'm definitely going to check out. It's located at the Amli Southshore on Riverside so there's plenty of parking in the garage.

We walked in and thought the place had a good ambiance, so far so good. That's where it ends.\\nSat for about 5-10 minutes before a member of waitstaff came by. Our waitress turned out to be one waiting on a table next to us, who chose to ignore us. She finally came by, each interaction with little to no eye contact, to take our order. Food came out fairly too quick, so I suspected pre-prepared or frozen food. During our appetizers, twice the manager/owner made rounds to check on the tables and not once did he acknowledge our presence. Thr first time, we assumed he knew the other patrons; the second time it was blatant because he checked on all the tables except for us.\\nEntrees arrive. I ordered the pork chop, which comes topped with peppers and onions. My mix had a random bit of broccoli and ham, which made me question whether it was reused or if their toppings were all close together and accidentally got mixed and dropped in. Pork chop was very thick and still on the bone, but overdone and dry. Boyfriend order chicken parmesan and a pepperoni pizza. Pizza crust was chewy as if from frozen dough, and the chicken was definitely a frozen breast.\\nWhen we were finished, our waitress asked if we were ready for boxes. We said yes, and expected her to take our plates back to box like she had done for the other tables. Instead, she brought us boxes so we could box our food ourselves. Upon leaving, the manager was at the host stand thanking everyone for coming. As soon as he saw us he turned his head the opposite direction, even though he had thanked and said goodbye to the couple immediately in front of us.\\nI was really excited to try a new place but left we a sour taste in my mouth. We may not have been dressed the nicest but the obviously poor treatment we got compared to other tables, possibly due to our age and appearance, was alarming.

In so many ways. \\n\\nThe two reasons I didn't go for one star: the service, which was all-around great, and the sticky toffee pudding. Oh, and since I wasn't drinking that night, I loved that they had \\"mocktails\\" and the grapefruit one I had (Captain something or other) was really good. \\n\\nHere are the reasons I really wanted to give one star:\\n\\nTHE FOOD\\n\\nIt was just not good. We started with the charred octopus appetizer. It was brought out with only one set of silverware (they took all of ours away after the popover thingys), which was weird because we were going to share it. And then the plate was put in front of me and I realized that this appetizer was so small it wasn't really shareable! The \\"char\\" just tasted acrid and bitter. The only flavors I got were that and the very spicy habanero sauce. I barely got through half of it before giving up.\\n\\nMy SO and I ordered the duck for two. What a nightmare. The breast came smothered in some sauce that did not help at all with the gamey taste of the duck. Just not good. The duck leg tasted better but was incredibly salty. The \\"kale salad\\" was more like a garnish and there were exactly three slices of duck fat fried potatoes. The kale salad/garnish was the best thing on the plate. And the entire dish was far smaller than I was expecting. \\n\\nMy friends had the pork chop and the summer vegetables. The former was pretty good and a hearty portion. I tried it and he definitely had the one hit of the table. The vegetable plate looked pretty good, but small considering it's rabbit food and you need more of it to fill up. The friend who ordered that left hungry. \\n\\nThe saving grace of the meal: the sticky toffee pudding. I was determined to leave on a good note and took a chance on dessert. I was glad I did. It was warm and sweet and rich. Delicious. Definitely should be shared, as it can be a bit much for one person. \\n\\nTHE SCENE\\n\\nMy friend called this place a haven for \\"expired frat guys.\\" And good lord was she right. There were a lot of tight, brightly colored button downs, waxed chests, and Botox. And, of course, there were the complementary expired sorority girls, with a glass of white wine in one hand and their adorbs designer clutch bag in the other. You know, the kind who hit up a restaurant with 18 of their closest friends, share one flatbread, and have the check split 19 ways. Although the outside patio looked great and the weather was beautiful, we avoided sitting out there for this one reason. \\n\\nTHE PRICE\\n\\nSo that sad, sad duck dish that my SO and I split? It was $75. So I paid $37.50 for a duck breast approximately the size of my iPhone, a duck thigh about half the size of my iPhone, 1 1/2 slices of potato, and enough kale for one hearty forkful. \\n\\nAre you holding up your iPhone, trying to envision my meal? Are you concluding that 1.5 iPhones worth of food is not worth $37.50? Are you seriously reconsidering trying this place out?\\n\\nOVERALL\\n\\nPass. \\n\\n\\nP.S. If you do end up here, please note that if you want to park, you must turn onto Buckhead Avenue to access the valet and the parking deck. Once you turn, make your first right. You'll see signs directing you where to go based on where you want to park.

They were not toasted and had no butter, only oil placed on the table. \\nLike previously mentioned, the food was very good and just that alone is worth trying."},{"name":"River Bar","address":"661 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"3","text":"The Good-   The highlight of this place is definitely the drinks, so that's where this starts.   Really good drink list, with something for everyone.  And with a full bar and willing bartenders,  you can get just about anything that floats your boat.  Next up is the awesome view and location. It is located in the amazing Assembly row (seriously, if you have not been, you are doing yourself an injustice) with waterfront views. It is a really different concept as well (in a good way), with a small inside of the kitchen and a few seats, and a large outdoor area with many tables and the \\n\\nThe Bad-  One big thing here.  Service was inconstant.  We got there and a young man who seemed like the host greeted us and took a drink order.  5 minutes later,  a server came over and greeted us, having no idea that we had already placed an order, saying that the host could not take or ring in anything! The first server was also awkward, making weird jokes and being a bit rude. He left soon after and was replaced by seemingly everyone else, as we had no less than 5 other servers check on us in our time there.  But that's really the only bad thing here. \\n \\nThe Ugly- Several things with the food here.  To start off, its a very fucking limited menu.  Maybe 15 items total, with not a ton of variety.  They also have a midday menu, from 3-4,  that make your selections even more limited.  They have a tiny kitchen, one of the smallest I have ever seen, which is a big reason for the limited selections.  The food that they do have really does not fill you up either.  Between the 4 of us, we got a burger, short ribs empanadas, and 2 orders each of wings and pork tacos.  Splitting everything, still left fucking hangry.  But being positive, all the food we got was solid.  Everything cooked really well, and did not get anything I would hesitate to order in the future.\\n\\nThe Final Word:  This place puts a focus on being a bar to meet friends, order some drinks, and have a great time, all while offering a great view in a cool location.  And it does that well.  Just don't expect this place to be something it's not,  such as a good place for dinner or a place to take the family.

First night I went with several colleagues from work.  They ordered the oysters (sorry, not my thing) and they thought it was fantastic, very fresh.  Had to order the baked beans since they said it was a local specialty, they were good but not noteworthy. Cornbread that came with our drinks was delicious.  Now to the drinks, there were multiple beers and specialty cocktails.  Most of the cocktails have a twist in the name but they are kind enough to show you what the normal cocktail equivalent is.  \\nOne colleague ordered a steak, it looked as you would expect it but it wasn't great. We did poke fun that he ordered the steak at an oyster house and shouldn't have expected different.. :). \\n\\nSecond visit was with my wife.  The historical atmosphere was a fav of hers, she wanted to take pictures of anything.  Hostess was very accommodating to place us at a window.  Wife was so excited to have fresh oysters, they did not disappoint.  She was enamored by the oysters, if she wasn't trying to stop at 2 other locations she would have ordered more.  I ordered the lobster ravioli as I thoroughly enjoyed them 2 nights prior.  Sadly, she ate 1/2 of my oysters but was clear that she found a winner.  \\nHighly recommend visiting this historic icon, its huge, 3 stories with tasty treats."},{"name":"Holy Taco","address":"345 1st St","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"3.5","text":"Dropped by after Rocky Horror Picture Show at the Lakewood.

The one thing they cautioned us on was the price, so when we arrived and looked over the menu the first thing that struck me was how reasonably priced it was compared to some of the other nice/upscale places we have dined at. \\n\\nI'm not saying that the food or check was cheap, but it certainly was not the kind of steep prices we have paid in the Boston area. Regardless, you can expect the people around you to be celebrating a special occasion as many of the tables experienced a candle in their dessert or champagne corks popping all night throughout the restaurant. \\n\\nFor all the commotion that seemed to be going on around us, the odd thing I found was how quiet the overall restaurant stayed throughout the night. I'm not sure how they do it, but kudos to them as my wife and I were able to keep a conversation without having to raise our voices. \\n\\nThe food is upscale, contemporary American with a steakhouse influence (in my opinion). All of the dishes we had on the tasting menu (paired with wine) were exceptional, but the most interesting dish award goes to the smoked pork belly beet salad. That one threw me and the wife for a loop as it was NOT what we expected (in a good way for me, in a not so good way for her). Everything was expertly plated, timed well for a tasting menu, and like I stated earlier... a pretty good value for what you get. \\n\\nHowever, with all of these good things to say about the actual restaurant the real star of this place are the views. While you will inevitably see people walking around and taking pictures from behind you (if you are lucky to be seated at the windows like we were), it's really a breathtaking view and allows you to see the entire city while you sit back and enjoy a great meal. The observation deck right below the restaurant charges ~$20-25 for admission anyway so you might as well get something a little extra while taking in the views :P \\n\\nEverything considered, we loved our experience here. While it was a bit cloudy and overcast we will definitely go back and take in the views again. Our best advice is to go a bit earlier and try to get a seat at the window, it will be the caramelized sugar on your creme brulee ;)"},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We went back to Frank today to try the brunch, and it was awesome.

The former was good and surprisingly filling but the dressing was very heavy on the vinegar. The combo was my favorite - the sandwich was a take on the BLT but the real star was the French lentil soup. I think lentils are generally blah and unremarkable but man did Mediterranea manage to dress them up. I would happily go back just for that soup. \\n\\nMy SO and I recently went for dinner and I was really impressed. I had the risotto, which was kind of non-traditional. The rice did have that soft, creamy taste but it was a mound of rice surrounded by broth instead of the creamy bowl of rice I was envisioning. Despite that, it was delicious. The fava beans, pancetta, and parmigiano really rounded out the dish. My SO had the eggplant stack, which was unreal.

However, after ordering the same grilled cheese & veggie sandwich twice, and the grilled breakfast \\"scramwich\\" with cheese, egg and veggies once, I've decided  their sandwich grilling technique doesn't quite meet my preferences. I think the sourdough bread is just too thick. While the outside of the bread is crispy, the cheese is melty, and the veggies add good flavor and texture, there's too much dry bread in between. If they've been making sandwiches for thirty years, you think they'd be a little better than this!\\n\\nWhile their grilled cheese sandwiches don't measure up to others I've had from other restaurants or made at home, their gluten free vegan grilled cheese is apparently a really satisfying treat for my friend with dietary restrictions.

Corn is a natural ramen topping, and butter adds some good creaminess\\n\\n- Aji-tama -- one of the tastier ones of the local ramen shops -- this one has a creamy yolk and a good yet not overwhelming soy sauce flavor. \\n\\n- Pork cheek -- amazing. It's a bit much if all your meat is pork cheek (super rich!) so split it with someone if you can.\\n\\nOverall, probably my favorite ramen shop in Boston at the moment!

Luckily, we were wrong. \\n\\nDress code: FYI not everyone fully adheres to the dress code, and staff doesn't seem to point it out. This is for both dining and lounge areas. I'm not encouraging jeans and flip flops, but here's my point: If you're normally conscious about what to wear, don't stress over what to wear. Go in those  open-toed wedges despite that misleading policy no one follows. \\n\\nDrinks: I was disappointed in the Chocolate  Espresso Martini. It was strong but otherwise was just a sloppy mix of ingredients. $14. The Boston Bee was a tasty and cool original drink to have featured on the cocktail menu. $15. Vodka soda was pretty strong. Don't remember how much, but I'm sure it was overpriced :)\\n\\nFood: We tried to share the calamari but ended up sending it back. Every bite had jalape√±o peppers and was just so spicy. Even the cocktail sauce just wasn't quite right. We also split the BLT sandwich, which made up for everything else. Even the chips were delicious. \\n\\nService wasn't that great.

Both ramen bowls were delicious - the Shio more down to the basic form, with the 20-hour broth at it's purest, seasoned with a few dashes of salt, and finished with a Umeboshi (pickled plum) on top.  This is also known as their \\"Lipstick in a bowl,\\" symbolizing the finishing touch of a carefully prepared ramen, similar to the prep a woman takes when getting ready for a night out, with red lipstick as the last step to dazzle all.  Delicious and simple - extremely satisfying.  The Kara Miso, which is their lone spicy bowl of ramen as of yet, was such a perfect blend of spiciness and broth that my tongue just couldn't even.  COULDN'T EVEN.  Just.  Can't.  It was absolutely perfect - just enough spice to keep my spicy craves satisfied, but not overwhelming where their special broth was eclipsed like some other establishments.  Man, now that is ART.  \\n\\nTo wrap up the quality of the food, broth is their key winner.  Their egg noodles, made al dente, was springy and not too shabby.  Their pork slices, was unfortunately varying - some were juicy, others a bit dry.  Their side order of egg, pricy for $2 extra, was satisfying with a perfect molten yolk.  Bamboo shoots were deliciously marinated, and the wood ear mushroom (I swear that's the real name - it sounds gross but is very tasty!) was also fresh and crisp.  In terms of overall toppings, they keep it very simple here, which may be a turn-off for those few that enjoys the harem of variety in one bowl.  However, the simplicity and purity of their broth really wins everything over. \\n\\nPrices are a respectable range for the quality, and are over $11 a bowl.  I would HIGHLY suggest \\"supersizing\\" your order to a large for only $1 - the difference between the normal and the large is akin to comparing Tyrion vs Jaime Lannister (sorry for my Games of Throne reference).  All that extra broth and noodles for $1 more?  Damn you, I'll never lose weight.\\n\\nIn summary?  Santouka, marry me.  I'll be your faithful hubby and will look at no other ramen bowl, I promise."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"You know this place is good when there is a line wrapped around the block in 28 degrees (feels like 17 degrees) weather.

Looking for something special and unique. Luigi's did not disappoint and we quickly fell in love with the whole place from amazing staff, cozy environment and just the love of the food that was being put out. First off, come here and be patient, there is no reservations so you put your name on the list and the automated program texts you when your table is ready. We decided to go around the corner to Urban Winery for a couple glasses of wine before dinner. Once we were messaged we paid up our tab and headed over and then were sat as soon as the last table paid. \\n\\nJust to note, everything we ordered was a hit for our table so i need further visits to compare but wow is our first impression. One of my friends was Celiac and which is one reason we decided to come to Ask for Luigi because we heard how amazing their fresh gluten free pasta was. And it was quite frankly the best gluten free pasta we've all tasted and it tasted exactly like the regular pasta. Okay, skipping ahead here, first we started off with the Fried Cauliflower with Aioli and the Bone Marrow with Escargot. OMG, mind blowingly good, Cauliflower had a fantastic crispness and season to them you could eat a whole bowl and the bone marrow and escargot seemed like then should never be eaten alone again. \\n\\nAll three of us ordered different pastas and shared to experience more flavours. I had the Parpadelle Duck Ragu and my friends ordered the Tagliatelle with chicken liver ragu & sage and the Fusilli, rabbit ragu & Pancetta. All three had totally different flavours  that worked so well, my Duck wasn't gamey but melted in your mouth, as if the ragu was made with duck confit. The chicken liver was excellent offering what reminded me of rich chicken stew on pasta and lastly the rabbit was rich and bold and made me want to lick the plate. There was no pasta that we didn't love. Only thing was that we didn't realize how full we were getting and food comas were well on there way. \\n\\nTo Cap of this amazing dinner was Expressos and we decided to share one dessert and this was my favourite part of this amazing meal. Did not get the panna cotta but the Chocolate Bandino. UNREAL. Game over. \\n\\nLeft over the moon happy and very full. One of the best meals i've ever had in Vancouver. Highly recommend.

Just toss an egg on it and people come alive. I'm typically a savory girl but I played it adventurous and went with the French toast. My friend got a the Savannah Salmon and got two poached eggs on top which was a good call. The eggs weren't quite poached to his liking but he enjoyed it, especially with the salmon which was cooked well. The French toast... honestly I didn't go crazy for it. It was a little on the dry side and underwhelming. The berries on top were just a garnish and the maple syrup came in a little personalized jar.

One member of our party was Vegan, and a main reason we chose this restaurant was both due to the great Yelp reviews and also due to the fact there was a vegan menu with several vegan listed menu items. Upon arrival, we ordered the chef appetizer sampler and drinks. Our waiter was extremely friendly at the beginning of our seating as well, offering suggestions, saying he used to be a vegan, etc. When it was time to order our meal, this is when the complications began. My friend who was vegan, went to order off the vegan menu and wanted to confirm that the vegan pineapple fried rice was actually vegan, the waiter went to confirm and came back saying the rice is all made with BUTTER. Butter is the opposite of vegan. Turns out they refused to make any rice plain and without butter and had a hard time comprehending why this was a big deal. I was so embarrassed for suggesting a restaurant with items claimed to be vegan, that were in fact not at all vegan. We dealt with the waiter and the manager, they brought another dish that we asked be plain and not spicy, it came out with a spicy sauce. We then asked for plain tofu with steamed veggies, they brought this, and do not worry they still charged us for it. The sampler appetizer, I felt was disgusting, I did not like anything we had on it and I would not suggest it. We then ordered the wok and the mussels, both came in a good sauce, but the wok portion was pretty small for the large price and rice was an extremely small portion and flavorless. Our waiter was pretty rude after the vegan ordering fiasco and the manager did nothing to make us feel better, no comps, no apology. We paid and tipped in full, but I would never return and never suggest this place to anyone."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"They may make a voodoo doll out of me that they'll want to poke with a needle after this review but I thought Voodoo Doughnut wasn't all that crazy fantastic as people hyped up to be.\\n\\nThey are still pretty good doughnuts with wild and inventive creations that make you feel as if you've walked into a new franchise brought to you by Willy Wonka and his chocolate factory. \\n\\nAs far as first impressions go, walking into Voodoo is a trip and you almost do feel like someone put a spell over you. The displays of various brightly colored and creatively concocted doughnuts are so fun to look at and for taking photos.

Proper execution of sweet meets savory and neither overpowers the other. Plus full strips of bacon!\\n- Voodoo Doll and Cock N' Balls donuts are something else to behold. I wasn't so much impressed with how they tasted (very, very sweet) but the level of intricacy that they go into the appearance/theme is very cool.\\n\\nCONS:\\n- Ordering the Cock N' Balls. Just a different experience asking the male cashier, \\"hey, can I have the Cock N' Balls please?\\"  \\n- Getting a box of donuts is sugar overload. I would recommend trying one first that you are really interested in so that you get the experience of having visited Voodoo and can check it off your list.\\n- The donuts are room temperature which makes sense considering if they were hot, there would be no way to maintain those cool designs. But, I like my donuts warm or hot and that does affect how it tastes.\\n\\nOverall, I recommend trying Voodoo because as a tourist it is totally worth checking out to see donuts you probably won't find elsewhere. Its a spectacle for sure in both appearance and taste but it wasn't quite as tasty as I would've hoped. \\n\\nTips: take your donuts around the corner to Stumptown Coffee Roasters where you can sit, order a latte, and enjoy your donuts indoors away from the cold."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"ANDINA!

Pretty reasonable, especially for the Pearl.\\n\\nThen we ordered a slew of street tacos, which according to their menu are a house signature, and made with locally sourced northwest ingredients. That might sound like a good thing to you, but to me it's a warning sign. At $4 a piece, I envisioned not REAL street tacos but instead \\"a northwest twist\\". I was right. The $4 price point is probably reasonable from a food cost perspective, considering just how loaded up the tortillas were. But none of them were really that good. Just too much going on.

It was microwaved straight out of a freezer.\\n\\nI am leaning towards frozen to microwave because the \\"toasted\\" ravioli was so rubbery and soggy and the inside cheese was the consistency of something that was previously frozen and reheated.

Underseasoned chicken with a standard issue waffle (I think they could learn a thing or two from Waffle House - since the waffle itself was lacking flavor).  I get that it was a fusion spot - but was the Asian salad really a complement to chicken and waffles.  They need to rethink their pairings.  So, my first experience was blah.  All presentation, no taste.\\n\\nSo, when my friend suggested that we go there for dinner - I was less than thrilled, but I wanted to see if the mediocrity was just limited to brunch or if it was across the board.  I ordered the pad thai.  While I wasn't impressed, it was far from the worst pad thai I've had.  I'd give it a 2.5 out of 5.  Flavorful, but didn't wow me.

I've been a few times now, and have never been disappointed with the speed, service, or food.\\n\\nThis is one of those places where you line up, order at the counter, and then get your own drink situation under control before finding your own seat. Servers identify you by a number you place on the table, and don't really stop by to see how you're doing or offer refills. My feeling is the gratuity (which you're asked to make upon ordering) is for the bussers, so I tend to skip tipping up front and just leave a couple of bucks on the table.\\n\\nThe plates are long and rectangular rather than round, which is kind of a neat touch. I am a particular fan of the Southwest Salad with the bourbon salmon add-on. It's freaking delicious. All the salad ingredients are very fresh and the fish is delicious, with just the right amount of sauce. Best of all, I think you could probably order just about anything off the menu and not feel terribly guilty about the indulgence.

That's actually a lie, but being up here in Cedar Park we like to believe it.

We were seated right away and although we did wait a little while for our waiter, he was super awesome. Nice, attentive, and funny.

Seriously, if you haven't had their grilled cheese you need to add it to your bucket list. And it's huge. Some of us got chips and salsa, and others got the coleslaw. The coleslaw was good - ribbons of cabbage with a light peanut sauce that wasn't too overpowering, but really good. My husband got the apple cider which was very good, and the other two of us got mochas - one lavender and one Nutella. They were also both  very good, although I the lavender didn't come through as much as I thought it would. It was seriously hard to choose a drink, because there were so many that piqued my interest. Anyways... we really, really, REALLY wanted to try dessert but were all so stuffed that we had to bypass. It was a big bummer to us, considering the food was so good. \\n\\nSo yeah, totally five stars here. This is a great place to go.

Inside - So they squeezed as many tables as they could on the floor (which I get - it's business - more tables=more people=more money) but I didn't particularly like that. I asked the waitress about mirrors being in the bathroom and she said they actually did finally put some up because they saw the reviews they were getting about that.\\n\\n4. My Advice to the Owners - So the website looks awesome but I don't necessarily think the restaurant itself matches - the waitresses and waitors seem like they work hard and the uniforms are nice but please make sure they're neat and ironed (it was looking a little rough that night). I have more to say but .....I'll let it at that.\\n\\n5. My advice to people who want to try it - I say go - you never know what kind of experience you'll have or who you'll see (apparently Waka Flaka and his wife had just wrapped up filming for their show there). \\n\\noh yea - we went on a slow night - Tuesday night - so my review is most likely a bit different from others although I do plan on going back on a weekend just to see what that experience would be like."},{"name":"Ganko Ittetsu Ramen","address":"318 Harvard St, Unit 3","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Amazing, tasty ramen.

The donut itself is nothing different than other places. I also got a RASPBERRY FILLED DONUT that is decorated with tons of frosting to mimic a Voodoo doll because there is a pretzel stick through it. The APPLE FRITTER was HUGE.

The only thing we found decent was the plain glazed with raspberry filling, because it wasn't drench in all nasty frosting! The dick and balls were a waste, nothing special, not even decorative. Literally just a molding of a dick and balls. The maple bacon was drenched in maple frosting that literally overwhelmed the bacon slice on there. The lemon filling donut was okay... nothing great.

I haven't been here for at least 4-5 years as I've cut back on Chinese restaurants because I'm reducing sodium in my food.  However, today I decided to give it a try as it was on the way.\\n\\nThey were very nice in letting me kind of create my meal: beef with vegetables in Szechuan sauce.  I also asked them to use less oil.  It was hard to explain because, although the woman taking my order has probably been there for 2 decades, she still didn't understand English well.  Anyway, she finally got the idea.\\n\\nThe servings, as others have noted, are very large and for that, they get a star.  However, the food wasn't particularly good.  The beef, whatever it was, was somewhat stringy with an unknown kind of texture.  It seemed cheap.  The sauce was very spicy, but not particularly Szechuan in flavor, and I've had Szechuan food at many restaurants, some of which were highly rated.  There were plenty of vegetables, but soggy broccoli, carrot slices, a few pea pods, and some cut up button mushrooms didn't impress me.  As for the \\"less oil\\", the meat and veggies were literally drowning in it.  They had put so much sauce in it, it was like a soup.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is strip mall basic.  They've done very little over the years to soften the harshness of the large bare windows looking onto the cars and parking, or to liven up the plain metal tables and chairs, the plastic utensils and paper plates.  Obviously most of their business is take-out because it's not a very pleasant place in which to eat.  It is clean, but it has a lonely, impersonal feel to it.\\n\\nThe staff is somewhat curt.  Not friendly although I noticed that some regulars were greeted much more pleasantly.  From my point of view, almost any Chinese restaurant around is as good, and many are better.  As for the \\"healthy\\" Chinese food, I see nothing about Joy Wok that's any healthier than any other place.

The theme throughout the evening seemed to be \\"too much bread(ing)\\" in nearly every dish. That included the hot buttered lobster roll ($32), the fish and chips ($18), the fish sandwich ($15) and the oyster slider. I liked the rosemary flavor of the roll but found the ratio of lobster to roll very off -- and I thought that the denser quality of the roll (as opposed to a hot dog bun-type roll other places seem to use) made it difficult to take full bites that included both lobster and bread. You really want the lobster to be the star, so that was a miss. The fish in the fish and chips was also heavily breaded, to the point where my friend started scooping the fish out from inside the breading to eat it. The fish sandwich and the oyster slider both suffered, again, from a bad ratio of bread to filling. If seafood is supposed to be the star here, why not highlight it appropriately? I also found the coleslaw overly soupy. \\n\\nMy favorite thing was the soft-shell crab appetizer ($15), which was a special for the night, because it actually had very light breading and came with a nice mango and cabbage salsa/salad thing that kept the whole thing bright, despite the fact that it was fried.

I can be a harsh critic when it comes to soul food. This because my mom is the best at Southern cooking, and, I myself can burn.\\n\\nWhen I walked in on a Tuesday evening the place was jam-packed. This was to be expected, however, my wait was not long at all. It took a while for my server to come to my table, however, after the initial introduction she was absolutely amazing. She was also juggling a table of about 12 in the same dining room, so my hat went off to her. She handled it with such grace. \\n\\nI went with the fried chicken entr√©e into sides. I opted for three legs as opposed to one Breast. For science I went with the sweet potato souffl√© and a macaroni and cheese. The souffl√© was good, but I couldn't help but compare it to my own which is pretty amazing. The macaroni and cheese was just OK. What I loved most was the cinnamon sweet bro that was provided complementary at the beginning of my service. That and a sweet tea make me a happy camper.\\n\\nThe free parking in the back parking lot is a huge plus. Spots fill up quickly, but I have no problem finding a space.\\n\\nWill I return? Not likely unless I come with someone else who just has to try this place out. It was good, however, I just feel like I can make down home soul food at home.

We had been meaning to go here for months, but had heard the wait was long, etc. After a long day of yard work, we decided to try our luck.\\n\\nBefore I get into the actual food review, let me say that we travel a lot. I know, I know. Everyone in Boulder says that, and it's usually true. But we lived in Italy for a while and two weeks before our outing to Pizzeria Locale, we returned from a three week sojourn through southern Italy and Sicily. When I say southern Italy, I don't mean Naples and Pompeii (although we did go there as well); I mean Calabria, Basilicata, and Apuglia. In other words, places where pizza is taken very seriously and tourists are not common. In fact, Sicilians are very proud about their pizza, and for good reason. So, even though we've had mixed results at Frasca (rude servers incorrectly correcting our pronunciation of dishes, when in actuality we speak okay Italian), we gave Pizzeria Locale a try. Hey, we are foodies and we love anything Italian. \\n\\nOur first impressions were good; we were seated immediately at 7:30 on a Saturday night. Our server dropped off our menus, without an extra word. We ordered drinks with our antipasti (which is listed as contorni - side dishes for your main course - on the menu. Not a huge deal, but I expect a place that pompously holds itself out as a true Italian experience would know better. And no Italian would have olives or cheese as a side dish with their main course). We had an arancino, which was a favorite street food for us in Sicily, olives, and formaggio. All were good, but another reviewer commented on the amount of olives. True, you get about 6 olives and one piece of cheese for $4 each. We brushed this off, as part of the experience. \\n\\nThe table next to us then was seated and our server gave them the full spiel about being authentic Napoli pizza, all about the menu, etc. She then realized she had not done the same for us, and repeated the whole thing. Ok, but we had already ordered drinks and antipasti. And overheard her tell our neighbors, since the tables are inches apart. Again, oh well. We ordered our pizza - one diavola and one maiale. We noticed the absence of cipolle (onions) on the menu. We asked if they could be added and she said, \\"We don't have onions, but anything can be added or taken off a pizza.\\" Well, not onions. This was very strange. Every single pizzeria we went to in Italy, and there were many, often with locals as the only other patrons, had onions on pizzas. Garlic is not huge in these areas, but onions are used extensively, adding a great taste to pizzas. What is going on at Pizzeria Locale? Again, we brushed this off, since we try not to be the annoying people who want things just like they are in Italy. We also ordered a reasonable bottle of the nero d'avola, which from our experience tends to pair well with pizza. \\n\\nOur pizzas arrived and they were beautiful. Other reviewers have commented about the pizzas not being cut. I understand their confusion, but this is very Italian, and part of the experience. In fact, we ask for it uncut at places like Proto's. The other complaint I've seen on Yelp is that the pizzas are too oily. We did not find this, in fact in most pizzerias in Italy, olive oil with red pepper flakes is served alongside the pizza, which we missed. The toppings were fresh and delicious and the crust had a good flavor. Unfortunately, the entire middle of the pizza was complete mush. Undercooked and doughy. I didn't even need the knife, just pulled off dough with my fork. This is most definitely not like any pizza we have had in Italy and really cinched our rating of the place. We finished with the cassata, a typical Sicilian dessert. It was an interesting take on cassata, good, but definitely their interpretation. Total bill $124\\n\\nAll in all, we probably won't be back to Pizzeria Locale. It was good, but not $124 good. They also take themselves way too seriously and the service was a little aloof (like Frasca). We will try Basta and da Lupo, but in the meantime we will continue to go to Proto's, which is the closest thing to Italian pizze we have found in Boulder."},{"name":"Mexas Tacos","address":"8788 Vineland Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"The staff was very friendly and helpful.

Instead I ordered chicken tenders and fries.  The different sauce options with the hot chicken was delicious.  Sam M ordered a chicken sandwich, which he thoroughly enjoyed. \\n\\nThe employee at the counter was detailed in describing the menu since we had never been.  While waiting for our food, many people ordered the box option of 20 wings for $20 or 10 piece white fish for $20.  A lot of patrons did this as a pick up order.  We had some time before going to the airport, so we sat in one of the booths.

Well out came a soggy, tasteless pizza with a raw egg on top. It was so raw and runny that I actually gagged. The waiter asked how it was and we admitted it wasn't too good and the egg was raw. He suggested we let the pizza sit awhile and cook. We didn't want a cold pizza and besides that it had zero taste! We let the manager know and he said since we had each eaten a slice he wouldn't do a thing. He actually made us pay for the uneaten pizza in full and we left.

Could you please pay in cash?\\" My husband had to go and find an ATM in the middle of our meal. However, a larger party came in and was seated after us, but she didn't tell them the same thing -- so we suspect that their credit card machine was working just fine -- they just wanted to avoid paying taxes on such a small order. \\n\\nThen came time to order the food. We wanted the specialties -- borsh, cherry vareniki -- but unfortunately, they were out of both. We had to settle for mushroom barley soup, meat pilmeni and avocado salad. The mushroom barley soup was tasteless, and we recognized the meat pilmeni as the kind you get from the frozen section of most Russian speciality stores. The pilmeni were undercooked and outrageously overpriced at $14. The avocado salad was good, but it was a small portion and not worth the $9 we paid for it. \\n\\nWe give it one star because the waitress was polite.

We arrived and were pretty shocked to see so many people in spite of the weather, but nonetheless we continued in. The hostess (I didn't get her name) explained to us that they were not expecting such a big crowd that evening so their kitchen was understaffed. She then stated it would be a 30 minute wait minimum and that we would have to stand and wait. Yes- stand in front of the cold door for 30minutes while there were at least 5 bar seats open and 5 tables open. We inquired about sitting at the bar and she said we weren't able to- our only option was to stand and wait. The whole situation was bizarre considering we could have ordered a bottle of wine at the bar and easily taken over 30 minutes to drink it. In addition to that, the hostess was unfriendly, looked like she had a bad taste in her mouth, and it was obvious that she did not want to be there that night. As you can probably predict, we walked out the door and didn't look back.\\n\\nLike I said, I really hope this poor of service was just a fluke and that it will be addressed so I can go back and improve my review.

I have waited here for 30-60 minutes at times, even during off peak times. I really like their chicken tonkatsu and their bowls. Note -- you don't have to get their curry bowls with rice, you can also get them with field greens. This adds a little healthier option since the ground chicken or pork is a good flavorful protein.

The staff and customer service is good. They are helpful with any questions and what not. They prices for everything is pretty decent too and would say that it is pretty worth it for the wait and for the doughnuts especially.

After we ordered and consumed a rather large dinner with a few beers, I went to the rest room. When I returned from the rest room, I found that it appeared that the waitress had taken away the remainder of my glass of Adam .  Not much was left in it, to be sure, but I was looking forward to finishing the remaining beer, along with the second half of my lamb sandwich and my chips and brussels sprouts when I returned.  Nothing else was removed from the table - lots of empty plates that could have been stacked and removed were left on the table and remained on the table until after our check was paid -  only my beer was taken away!  I didn't want to order an additional beer so was a bit miffed about it.  \\n\\nWhen the waitress (Halston) brought the check, I told her that she had taken away my beer and asked her to be more careful about that because lots of people like to nurse a beer with their meal and not have to order an additional one.  I did this because I wanted her to know to be careful about doing that as it kind of spoils a person's meal when there is no alcoholic beverage left to drink with the rest of the meal, and when you're drinking a high alcoholic content beer, you may not want to order another.  She was neither appreciative nor understanding.  In fact, none of the six of us have ever experienced such abusive behavior from  wait staff.  She didn't just say, \\"Sorry, I didn't notice it.\\"  She said, \\"There was no beer in your glass and you have no right to challenge my abilities as a waitress!\\"  Then she said, \\"Why didn't someone tell me not to take it away if there was beer in it?\\"  My nephew answered, \\"Because we were having a conversation.\\"  And my husband said, \\"We shouldn't have to guard a beer.\\"  I tried to calm her down by saying that I had worked as a waitress for many years and understand that it's not always easy to be on top of everything but she took offense at my use of the word \\"waitress,\\" even though she had just called herself a waitress, and said that it showed that I was being condescending.  (I don't know what other term I should have used because I was always called a waitress and took great pride in my job, and I thought the term \\"server\\" might actually be condescending.)  It didn't end there.  She would not stop telling us that we were just wrong and there was no beer in the glass.  She called us \\"corporate America,\\" although I have no idea how she got the idea that my family was corporate America, or what that was supposed to mean.    \\n\\nI said to her, \\"Look, let's just call this quits. You're risking getting your restaurant three to six negative Yelp reviews from this table out of this situation and that is not a good thing.\\"  She said, \\"Who cares?  No restaurants care about Yelp reviews because they're all paid for.\\"  That obviously had no impact on her.\\n\\nFinally, I just wanted to get away, so I said to her, \\"Look, this conversation is not productive and I think it would be best if you just go away, we'll pay our check and let's call it an evening.\\"  She said, \\"No, I won't go away.\\"  And she just stayed there leaning on the table and continued berating us despite the fact that we were no longer responding.  Finally, my husband said, \\"Please do stay.  You are really amusing us.\\"  That did the trick.  In that way, we got control of the situation,  and she finally left us in peace.\\n\\nThis was really a bad experience.  it was our third time at Hair of the Dog and this has not happened in the past.  However, I won't go back and don't recommend spending an evening there.  I would not have posted a Yelp review and would have preferred to contact the management instead, but I could find no way to do so on the restaurant's website."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"We were able to book dinner here for 8 people last minute for a birthday.

That's 9 months ago. It's apparently enough time for things to go downhill just enough to make a grown woman sniffle. Laurels. Resting upon. You know what I mean? \\n\\nThe Texas Benedict sounded good, with my eggs poached. Fried eggs aren't my style. The honey ordered from the Franktastic four: eggs, bacon, bierock, and toast.\\n\\nThe marscapone bierock, which I was excited for, was just ok. It didn't taste homebaked, which is maybe not what they're going for. I wasn't surprised at the tininess of his serving; I think he was begging for it with what he ordered. But the bacon was not crispy. It was kind of sad. His bloody mary was okay, if a bit watery. The bacon stick in it seemed more consistent with the strips in my dog's treat bag. Very stiff, probably so prepared to withstand the liquid it's submerged in. Still, the boy removing it and not eating it - wow. Oh boy oh boy.\\n\\nAnd my dish. You wont believe this. It was small. I'm not one to eat much in one sitting, but that thing was disappeared instantly. Still tasty, but Lilliputian, really. I'd gotten the same dish last summer and it was much more lavish, with the succulent pork splayed over the hearty cheddar biscuits like a prostitute in her quarters. All over. I saw a neighboring table with shrimp & grits. Last year that thing was at least 1/3 larger.\\n\\nWe ate what we got and eventually had some cereal when we got home. Frank. :( What happened?

My brunchmate ordered the daily frittata, which there were two options to choose from: meat or meatless. It also came with a side of greens and bread. The frittata was huge! I ordered the egg salad tartine, which was delicious and had a nice kick to it, thanks to the capers. All the food looked like art, and it tasted wonderful.

The time had finally come for me to see what the hype was all about surrounding the Optimist, which is crowned probably as Atlanta's top seafood restaurant. To me that isn't saying much since most true Atlantans don't eat enough seafood to tell what is really fresh seafood versus some pre-thawed fish from your local Walmart. However I decided to give this a chance because of the consistent word-of-mouth praises about Lobster Rolls Ana such. Instead of just trying it without risk, my brain decided which she take someone there for a bday occasion. Genius idea I'd say...because the experience at the Optimist was overall fantastic. An \\"experience\\" ironically best describes our time there because everything we ate had a unique layer of flavors to tickle the tastebuds with. I personally had some seared flounder with some sort of turnip pur√©e and almonds. The fish was perfectly seared to the point that the skin had the most wonderful texture that I had ever tasted. It was crunchy but not chewy. Pairing the pur√©e and almonds together with it created one of the most different tasting pieces of a fish I've ever had in my life. The best part of the meal for me was actually my side dish, Basmati Fried Rice. The flavors were heavenly!!! It made my meal even better and complimented the fish nicely. Definitely that this side or the Br√ºssel Sprouts. My only slight disappointment with the restaurant was that they didn't do anything for my mother's birthday, after they were told ahead of time. I don't expect anything crazy or any free food, but I do expect something to make her feel special, especially in a restaurant of this caliber.

The establishment has valet available, or you could probably find some street parking nearby.\\n\\n[DRINK]\\nI have tried the PHO and Lychee Martini cocktails. I highly recommend the PHO if you enjoy the flavors in actual pho noodle soup.\\n- PHO: My FAVORITE cocktail EVER. It may sound weird, but trust me... It's delicious. It consists of gin and many of the spices found in pho. It has a slight sweetness to it that goes well with the spices.\\n- Lychee Martini: Way too sweet for me, but good otherwise. Good flavor, just too syrupy. My favorite part was the real lychee piece. I recommend this drink to anyone who loves very sweet drinks.\\n\\n[FOOD]\\nThe food is delicious! However, I have always enjoyed their small bites more than the entrees.\\n- Lobster Mac n Cheese: You have to order this if you like mac n cheese. It's my favorite food item at Poor Calvin's. The variety of pasta types adds different textures, and it has a slight spiciness to it that pairs well with the heavy cheese. The lobster chunks are a bit small but abundant. Overall, a great dish that can fill two people up if they both have small stomachs.\\n- Seafood Melange: This was the entree I ordered during my first visit, and it was decent. All the flavors work great together, and the seafood (especially the scallops) are fresh and delicious. My only problem was the level of sweetness. It was way too sweet for me, but we still finished our meal.\\n- Pad Thai with Soft Shell Crab: Attempting to learn from my previous experience, I asked the server if it's possible to reduce the sugar in a dish. Not allowed, sadly. We still decided to order the Pad Thai, and as expected, very sweet. It was still a delicious entree. The fried soft shell crab was AMAZING and helped cut the sweetness of the noodles. If you do not mind sweet, order this. And if you do order it and feel like it's to sweet, I recommend taking each bite with some noodles, fried crab and peanuts.\\n- Suspension Cake: My FAVORITE cake EVER! Sweet, but not as heavy as expected. The red velvet cake and the cream filled with popping bubbles and fresh fruit is perfect. The slice is big enough for up to three to four people.\\n\\nOverall, a great restaurant. I would recommend starting with some drinks and the Lobster Mac n Cheese.

I wish they would have removed the hard core of the pineapple before serving it.  It did have good flavor.  Now I would return and order the same meal.\\n\\nMy dining companion was disappointed with his Filet Mignon.  The steak was served sliced.  The ends of the meat was overly dry.  He would not order it again.  He did not bring it to the attention of the employees and mentioned it to me after we had left.\\n\\nBe sure to check for the 'Special if the Day'.\\n\\nThe restaurant is upscale and clean.\\n\\nGood friendly service."},{"name":"The Red Accordion","address":"1616 Alberni Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"5","text":"Cute, little small restaurant.

My boyfriend and I went for lunch yesterday and each had the 1/4 chicken combo  with one side. I got the white meat which was juicy and flavorful and the vegetable medley which was green beans and carrots which were also tasty. It also came with two warm corn tortillas and yummy sauces. If you like spicy, ask for the spicy one-it's really good! Their staff was friendly and helpful. When I asked to see what a 1/4 size looked like they immediately chopped up a chicken and showed me. It's an order up at the counter type of spot and then sit wherever you like type of joint. It's a great north Austin spot and will definitely visit again. The only critique I have is that the place could be cleaner.

Okay, I'll just blurt it out: Pescatore is my new favorite restaurant and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I took my first bite and it's been like 36 hours since I had it but it was so damn good that I am now forced to figure out an appropriate amount of time to wait before I return. Yes, it blew my mind.\\n\\nWhat factors make a perfect, 5-star, \\"new favorite restaurant\\" in my book?\\n\\n1. It's in the middle of Somerville in an unassuming building with unassuming tables and unassuming decor. Yes! Something about this type of joint makes me feel good, like I'm gonna get authentic, homestyle cooking. I've recently become fatigued of the overly priced, pretentious Boston eateries (though they have their place and time) and am generally not as impressed with the fancy places as I am with ones that are simply GOOD, and Pescatore is it.\\n\\n2. I walk in and literally every single person is sitting with a dish that I'd love to order. What a great sign from the get-go!\\n\\n3. Service/staff were very friendly and helpful, not in your face, not fake-friendly, just doing their job and doing it well.\\n\\n4. The fooood. My oh my- they do have a rather large menu but based on what I ordered and what I saw others eating, you have to go with pasta here!\\n\\nWe started with a perfect caprese salad and I had the Haddock Americano, which was perfectly cooked, a sizable but not too large portion, and the fusili I got (I think it normally comes with potatoes or something else) was INSANE. My dining partner got steak tips and was disappointed he didn't get the same thing I got! Honestly the best fish dish I've ever ordered out as well as the best pasta dish I've ever ordered out. YUM.\\n\\nAs a \\"side note\\" (pun intended), the sides weren't very good.. namely, the mushroom risotto (too dry and bland) & broccoli rabe (served cold and overly cooked for a stringy texture) were skippable.\\n\\nSides shmides, I will be back here again for sure.

I will slice my pancake ball in quadrants, smother some lemon curd and then top it with the lingonberry sauce. Together, it's a combination of sweet and tangy fruit. \\n\\nI got a chance to try their lefse. The first and only other time I've had lefse was at the Viking Soul Food food cart, so I was looking forward to the thin potato pancake. Although, it was served a little differently, I felt like I couldn't fully enjoy the pancake for what it was, but it was still delicious. The lefse of the day was country ham, egg over easy, and chevre, topped with arugula and thin strings of pickled red onion and thin apple slices that also tasted a bit pickled. Altogether, in one bite it was very creamy, savory with a few sour notes. \\n\\nBoth the wait and food can be a bit long, but it's worth it. Service is great. I'd say that this place was probably the most friendliest restaurant I had been on for this trip.

In fact, I had order Cajun Tots at another McMenamins and I was not very happy about the fact that the tots were way too salty. But at Kennedy School the Tots were seasoned perfectly and they are even better as leftovers the next day! \\n\\nOf course at every McMenamins they have their own special brews and they are always amazing. But what's cool about Kennedy School is their Honor's Bar and Detention Center. You can go and put your name on a list to be seated on a busy day and then wonder over to one of the bars to order drinks before you get seated.

He does one more eye rub, then rubs his nose, turns around touches one of the cooking timers then reaches to pull out cooked noodles & drop them into hot water. \\nI stood up in somewhat of a panic & asked one of the other guys I've seen behind the bar cooking to ask him to please ask the other guy to change his gloves.

They were understaffed and it got pretty busy, even after 8pm. There were 3 gentlemen that ran back and forth from picking up phones, making reservations, seating, bartendering, do take outs, and waitering. Our waiter was very nice. We weren't in a rush so we didn't mind just sitting at the bar and watch tv before our food arrives. BUT, 90% of our hot food were served cold/slightly warm coating. I ordered a plate of the chicken bones. Base off the photo in the menu, this dish is photoed with scallion and sesame as garnish but it was just seasoned bones on a plate. The grilled squid was tender but lukewarm. The grilled chicken was tender but lukewarm. The grilled pork belly was good flavor but cold. The grilled corn was only slightly warm when touched but it's cold and wet when bite into. The chicken skins were cold and not as crispy as I imagined it should be, and that was the only food I had asked to take back to cook longer but it came back 3 minutes later, still cold. You get where I'm coming from... Those are just some of the food we had. BUT, some were pretty good. The grilled fish was hot and crispy and fresh. The Yan Su Ji (fried chicken bits) were tender and not overly salty or greasy. My husband enjoyed the Dan Dan noodle, but I wished it was hotter, not as spice but as in temperature. The scallion pancake was not very greasy which is nice. And the hot and sour soup were extremely hot (temperature) which I LOVED! Overall it's a nice place to just relax. Perhaps it was just so short staffed and busy that caused the cold food, but I do hope it's not like this all the time so we can visit again.

Do not expect to be seated immediately if your party is greater than 2 people. We had a table of 4 and waited 30 min, which was not bad for such a tiny establishment. Also, you can view the que lineup on your phone, so no worries about not hearing your name called. \\n\\nFood: Their menu does not change too often except for the special of the week. They have a nice selection of ramens, and allow for customization with a list of ~20 toppings. Along with ramen, they also offer small tapas, salads, and rice bowls. \\n\\nMy dinner was comprised of the Jinya Tonkotsu Black Ramen with no extra added toppings. It is a pork broth with a seasoned egg, thin noodles, pork chashu, dried seaweed, green onions, garlic chips, and garlic oil. This broth was absolutely amazing. It was not too salty or underwhelming. The seasoned egg was a perfect touch and was still slightly runny. The pork was melt in your mouth delicious! Everything flowed so well and honestly I could not have asked for a better ramen bowl. For me, there was no need to add any of the sauces on the side. \\n\\nAmazing spot for Ramen in the sandy springs area. Please try it out if you have time.

I've only ever eaten downscale Peruvian chicken, which is always tasty. This was completely different. Lots of pisco- and rum-based cocktails which are not really my jam. But I tried the HECHICERO, with cinchona and elderflower tonic, and found it serviceable. The ceviche of the day was fresh and flavorful. There was a lot of serious meat going on in the menu--and in front of my three male dining companions. None of them complained in the least about their pork chops, lamb shank, or confit duck leg--in fact the duck bones were sucked clean, no exaggeration. However, it was all heavy for my taste. The Peruvian version of paella was more to my liking, with nice fresh seafood including octopus. The service was efficient. The place was packed on that Friday night, so it does seem to be a winner with locals.

I added an egg and char siu for extra $$ as the tan tan only comes with grounded pork and some other misc things. The noodles were ok. The broth was creamy and not as salty as other places.

I've come to love one of the more simple burgers, the little cheeseburger with lettuce, ketchup, and pickles as the toppings served with a regular sized order of fries. A piece of advice is that when you order the fries(fried in peanut oil) they fill up the cup, pour it into the bag, and fill it up again. Another helpful tip is that a \\"regular\\" hamburger/cheeseburger comes with two patties whereas a little version of those come in basically the same size but with only one patty. This is restuarant is truly a must for all lovers of great burgers and fries. \\nAlthough burgers are their specialty, they also offer 4 different types of delicious hot dogs and 3 types of sandwiches.

Still super crowded, we put our names down and waited for about 30 minutes. Our server looked like she hated her job, wasn't smiling, just didn't seem like she was into serving us. Whatever - I think the disappointing part was the FOOD. It took forever to get our food out.\\n\\nThe complimentary basket (you can only get it once) - had the cinnamon rolls (which were really good), corn bread (which I thought was too dry and fell into pieces after you break a piece off), and soft bread (which my friend said it was good, I didn't try)\\n\\nWe ordered:\\n* Deviled egg\\n* Chicken fried chicken with white pepper gravy with two sides of fried green tomato & mac & cheese\\n* Chicken pot pie with fried tomato & collard greens\\n* Road Pork with cornbread dressing and pork gravy and cranberry sauce\\n\\nI can't see making the deviled egg bad.. it was flavorful and cooked right. Nothing different than a normal deviled egg that anyone can make at home.. I got the mac and cheese because the raves about it were so high on yelp. Everyone said it was good and cheesy, but when I received mine, it wasn't cunky, not cheesy at all. Our dish didn't even come out HOT, so I'm guessing as the cheese sat there, it kinda just solidified ... It wasn't the best I've had. The collard greens had no flavor (which was also raved highly on yelp) was a bit soggy.  The chicken was pretty dry, thanks to the gravy that gave it flavoring and taste. The best part of the meal was the FRIED GREEN TOMATO with its dipping sauce. How can you go wrong with fried though?

However, a very nice Sam Addams Colonial beer is brewed just for them and was very enjoyable. But why only two stars?  First,  even with a reservation, we had to wait about 25 minutes. Then it took longer than expected for our drink order to arrive. Luckily, some really delicious cornbread arrived to give us something to enjoy. Next it took another 30 minutes for them to bring my oysters and clam chowder. The oysters were great. The clam chowder was think and bland. No clam taste.  More time goes by and we get our entrees. Scrod and Haddock. Both over cooked and incredibly bland. I detected zero seasoning on either. The sides were good. Great French fries and nice veggies.  Also, The plating was incredibly sloppy.

The staff was very friendly and were so chill. I could tell this place was going to live up to the hype. We ordered 3 slices of pepperoni totaling out to $13. (not bad at all). As a foodie, I know that outside lighting is the best lighting to capture the beauty of food (,: Sitting outside was so nice. It wasn't too hot or too cold and we were able to enjoy our pizza to the fullest. After I took the first bite, I couldn't help but fall in love. I wasn't able to pinpoint what exactly made this pizza so freaking good! Was it the crust? The cheese? The pepperoni? It was everything. Everything made it so good. I don't know how they do it but the dough was so thin yet crunchy and the cheese and pep were so flavorful I can't seem to explain well enough. As soon as I finished eating, I already wanted another one!! However this satisfied my craving for now but I will definitely be here first thing when I visit again.

Well, I sure as heck was NOT disappointed when I finally made it here.  The visit here started off a bit rocky as the hostesses were a bit unwelcoming.  After telling us our wait would be about 45 minutes, we were asked to sit at the outdoor area in front of the restaurant while waiting for our table.  Outside we go to sit at a table, and less than five minutes later the hostess came outside and asked us to \\"wait at the cocktail bar around the corner\\".   Who knew there was even a bar around the corner?  She didn't give us directions or walk us there, she just motioned her arm in a general vicinity and went back inside.  Anyway, we decided to just dine at an outdoor table.  \\n\\nOur server, on the other hand, was extremely friendly and very helpful when we asked her opinion regarding which dish we should choose.  She provided a detailed explanation of each dish, and made them sound equally amazing.  We started off with the fried olives, which were amazing!  Each bite was just bursting with flavor.  I ended up ordering the cheeseburger and I'm so glad I did because it changed my life.  This isn't just any cheeseburger, ya'll.  It has small pieces of bacon mixed into the ground beef.  It also comes with perfectly flaky and toasted buns (made in house), and a \\"special sauce\\" which was to DIE FOR.  For dessert, I tried the Birthday Cake ice cream sandwich.  I wouldn't say it's the best ice cream sandwich I've ever tasted, but not the worst.  And it's just so stinking cute with the little sprinkles on top.  \\n\\nAll in all, great experience here.

Maybe it was a bad night. But then I met my friends inside and they said the hookah sucks and the drinks are high and don't taste good. \\n\\nSo it was a packed night as some event was happening at the GA state stadium (True Atlanta would say Turner Field) so parking was as horrible as if it was a Braves game still occurring in the stadium and then it's 11am so people from the concert are flowing into the old church that became a club (museum bar). I circled the area and saw 4 ladies walking out of 656 and they approach a car. I pull into the parking lot and patiently wait for them to get in the vehicle. After 6 min they are just leaning on the car having conversation. They were all getting into the same car so I rolled the window down and asked politely, \\"excuse me ladies are you all leaving?\\" they say no and continue to talk. I thought I saw another spot in the 656 parking lot so I go down toward museum bar. A car coming in from the main st. Turns in to the alley and I'm blocked in because the museum bar parking has ppl double parked and the only way I can go is back. The man in the car begins to motion me to move and says he works at 656. I tell him there is no parking but in my rear view the ladies I just saw were getting in the car. I quickly put the car into reverse. I pull back so the ladies can get out and the man pulls up to take the spot. The man moves out of the way and I turn into the spot. A drunk parking attendant with a 656 shirt on is just walking in the way and saying hold on. In my mind I was hear first and where was this man when these girls were just standing in the parking spot talking. He apologizes and says he didn't know the women were just standing around earlier. The other man who I can only assume is management yells at the attendant they better be going into 656. Let me know if they don't so I can get their shit out of here. Like 0_o are you serious this is how you treat customers? Another parking attendant without the 656 shirt calms the situation and apologized for the attendants behavior and ignores the manager and says \\"have a good time.\\" I ignore the \\"manager\\" and my friend and I walk in to meet our friends.\\n\\nThe service. We go through security and Our friends looked visibly upset. I asked what was wrong. It was 5 of them 3 men and two women. They said the service wasn't good.

He wasn't flamboyant but even if he was dressed in that manner what warranted that statement.

We all had issues and when we asked for, frankly, what we had expected our order to be like... we were slapped with so much attitude. Also, we sat outside and my friend bussed the table herself. Unaccaptable. On two separate occasions while we were seated outdoors, staff came out to shoo away a homeless man hovering around the public trash can.

Tucked behind a bunch of apartments in the Old Fourth Ward, this restaurant happens to be a remodeled warehouse.  Valet parking is complementary but one word of advice--don't drive past the entrance to get into this place because it's sure to happen (even with GPS).  There is a small wooden post sign in the grass that tells you to enter but very difficult to see at night.\\n\\n2) Ambiance - 5 stars\\nI am from Boston and often traveled to New York where I loved to dine at Tao.  If there is any comparison, Tao is it.  When you enter, there is a small designated waiting area to be seated but once you get past all the people, you KNOW you are really going to enjoy your dining experience here.  As the pictures from other reviewers show, there are large red lanterns hanging from the ceiling, a beautiful painting that takes up a good chunk of the left side of the restaurant, and many large, abstract, ostentatious floral arrangements placed perfectly throughout.  Conveniently located in the center of the restaurant is the kitchen.  I like this because it shows the confidence the restaurant has in its chefs and the meals they prepare...there is no hiding behind walls.  The seating seems tight and it's relatively loud but what do you expect, you are in a warehouse!?\\n\\n3) Service - 5 stars\\nBeing that I am from the north, I am not used to such friendly service so this section may be a bit biased.  I loved our server, Kat.  She is a true southern bell in the sense she was extremely friendly, recommended a list of southern dishes that were staples to the restaurant and Atlanta, and was VERY accommodating throughout the night.  I will get into another detail about a severe experience that happened while dining here but will say that our server took good care of us and handled herself well given the unexpected mishap.\\n\\n4) Food - 4 stars\\nTheir cocktails are great but few to chose from; I had a pineapple vodka, ginger infused, fresh lemon dripped cocktail.  It was tasteful and different but refreshing.  For appetizers, we had the calamari and lamp chop lollipops.  I really enjoyed the calamari and the sauce it came with--it was not too fried which often is my hesitation in ordering this dish.  The lollipops were SO cool.  They came on a popsicle stick, drizzled in a berry jelly and a sweet white icing-cream sauce but had a spice when bitten into the meat.  For meals, we had the steak and the scallops.  Both were equally yummy.  The steak was perfectly done and came with shitake mushrooms while the scallops came with cheese grits that melted in your mouth with every bite.  We didn't get desert given we were so full but the food was great.  I was nervous that a place with this type of ambiance wouldn't have that great of food but thank you for proving me wrong.\\n\\n5) Price - 4 stars\\nI think that it is well priced for what you get but maybe I am just used to expensive prices from the north.  The appetizers were no more than $13-15 and the entrees ran us both $22 (I think).  All in all, our bill came to $98 which I can't complain about given all that we got.\\n\\n6) Prepared for the unexpected - 2-3 stars\\nWhile I was enjoying our initial conversation when we first sat down, I picked up my water glass for a sip.  The entire (HEAVY) bottom of the glass fell off and water flew everywhere.  Aside from being completely embarrassed by this unlucky occurrence, I was also completely soaked.  No readers, I was no intoxicated or rough, it is just a poorly made glass.   The person I was with went to grab the manager since NO one came over to make sure I was ok (of the staff).  The manager came over and apologized and returned with a stack of towels.  I was furious but held my composure HOPING that they would compensate me for something on the bill.  My tooth still hurts because it was knocked by the sudden dropping of the glass and still had to pay for all of our meal.  As mentioned, the manager and server were both graceful in this but this doesn't happen everyday folks... I guess I am just upset that I was compensated more for this then being handed a stack of towels.  \\n\\nMy suggestion Two Urban Licks--invest in new glasses so this doesn't happen to anyone else or you will have more than a badly-mouthed review to take care of....to the readers, I will return but probably with my own bottle of Aquafine."},{"name":"Armando's Pizzeria","address":"463 W New England Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"Yikes....

I ordered the pepperoni pizza with basil, mozzarella and tomato sauce.  Heavenly my friends. Just heavenly.  The crust was amazing and just cooked to perfection in the beautiful brick oven.  Let me talk about the ingredients for a second.  I read on their website that the ingredients are imported from Italy, which explains how delicious and fresh they were.  The tomato sauce was just as it should be- simple, thin, and flavorful.  The pepperoni, basil and mozzarella were perfect as well.  Overall, it was a pizza masterpiece!  The prices are pretty reasonable as well.  My friend and I split a pizza and it was just enough for us.  Word to the wise: make a reservation if you're coming here at night.

I even thought twice about finishing it. I looked at the table beside me and a woman at the table had dicarded the chicken on her plate.

It is a small restaurant that is clean and well decorated. \\n\\nWe came in for lunch and it was fairly busy. Most people opted for the lunch special menu but I was looking for more so I asked for the full menu (dishes on this menu do take a little longer as they had mentioned to me so keep that in mind if you have limited time).\\n\\nWe ordered the chicken sate and the Golden Angel Wings to start. Both were amazing. The chicken sate was perfectly cooked and juicy and the sauce was excellent. The Golden Angel wings are deboned and stuffed with pork, mushrooms and vermicelli noodles - really good!\\n\\nNext was our mains: green chicken curry, House Special spicy noodles, and the Jitlada special fried rice. All were very tasty. The green curry stood out from a lot that I have tried in town. They clearly used very fresh herbs and ingredients which you can really taste and smell. The aroma of fresh coconut was evident and made it really pop. The spicy noodles and fried rice were good, maybe slightly above average. I think what would have improved all the dishes is requesting \\"authentic\\" spice levels as ours was not as spicy as I would have liked.\\n\\nThe service was top notch. Very informative and attentive. They really went out of their way to make our visit pleasurable.\\n\\nOverall Jitlada is a very good Thai restaurant. Does it compare to Australia and Thailand? Not quite but it does hit the spot if you're craving Thai food in Vancouver. It's also good to know that the chefs and owners are actually Thai which obviously helps with the authentic taste.\\n\\nI will be back to try some of the other specialties that they recommend but didn't have a chance to try."},{"name":"Santouka Harvard Square","address":"1 Bow St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Incredible, incredible ramen -- this place serves my favorite food in the whole world.

I go there a lot, and I get the same thing every time and sometimes I even crave it. But it's just like...AGGRESSIVELY okay. The bagels are plentiful and definitely passable. They taste pretty good! They're not authentic bagels though--they're just round dough with a variety of toppings or mix-ins that are baked and probably never boiled. When you order one toasted, it technically DOES go through the toaster! But it's never crunchy or brown. It's never toast, it's just toast...y. The egg sandwiches cost $6 even though everything is microwaved and it squeaks when you eat it, but I mean it definitely does fill you up! And it's not gross, it's just not the best. They have a decent coffee menu and they seem to care about the drinks! I even heard people have to be trained by the machine manufacturer before they're allowed to barista there. But that seems like overkill since the drinks are always just...fine. I will say that the service is always incredible. The staff are super, super nice and very competent.

I started the meal with a Rummy Root Beer. Served in a Mason glass, I sizzurped on local root beer, vanilla rum and AMY'S Mexican Vanilla ice (more on her in a later review). Delicious. At once nostalgic and refreshingly sweet, I didn't have time to ponder more because my app was here: waffle fry nachos. WAFFLE FRY NACHOS. As in, waffle fries with beans,peppers, salsa, and cheese.

Lobster wonton with caviar and cream cheese was another superb creation, I frankly haven't had anything like it anywhere and is very unique. It's juicy, it's creamy, fried goodness.\\n\\nThe basil rolls had an odd situation where it came loaded up with sand, clearly from poorly washed basil. It does happen and that's just the reality, I've had it happen to greens I cooked at home. I am glad I didn't break my tooth on that thing. I told the staff about it. They decided not to take it off the check and that's fine by me, no handouts necessary. The spring rolls was another dish I didn't think much of. It seemed odd that yelpers recommend that dish.

To top it off, they have a ridiculous amount of spices you can put on your dish and other sauces like sweet chili sauce. \\n\\nMy two bugaboos: The bar service is just beyond slow - getting a beer is like asking a server to provide their first born child to you. AND...they don't have as many veggie options as I'd like. \\n\\nMost importantly, it's affordable. Not that I think the comparisons are insanely expensive, but for the quality and experience you get versus the other restaurants, ~$25 for two dinners really isn't bad.

At $12 each, my wife compared them to half a Trader Joe's frozen dish...but less flavorful and more expensive. The empanada was probably the best of the three, nice and fluffy, but tiny.

I've had cooked oysters that had a fishy taste to them before, but there was none of that here! The raw ones were good, but the roasted ones were amazingly delicious! The roasted ones come with bread crumbs, but our waitress made sure to split the order with some without breadcrumbs for my gluten-free request. the roasted oysters were so good, we ordered a second round of them, and the chef forgot to remove the bread crumbs from half, so we ended up getting three more essentially on the house.

I had the duck fat poached swordfish, and it was absolutely amazing served atop a bed of juicy, slow-cooked shredded short rib meat and a puree of celeriac. The swordfish itself was so succulent, juicy, meaty and flavorful. My husband had a side of roasted cauliflower and romanesco, which he said was very delicious as well. We also had the fried oysters, which were good as well. The hot sauce is made in house and is very tasty and delicious, it looks like your typical red hot sauce, but it definitely packs a more flavorful punch then your average.

In that amount of time, I've had nothing but high praise for this place to anyone who would ask.  I had been telling my wife all about it and how much she was going to love it. This was going to be her first time at the restaurant and I was excited to share it with her.  However, after our experience last Friday night, I felt like I had been let down and had wasted a really nice evening out on the town (something we don't get to do very often).  I had been hyping this place up for so long and was let down.  I now hereby revoke my seal of approval for Two Urban Licks.\\n\\nThe night started out just like I remember, with the pulling into an odd parking lot in front of an abandoned warehouse building that looked like anything but a trendy restaurant...this was the 2UL I remember from a year ago.  We got inside and I saw the gigantic oil painting on the wall, the really cool vibe and I was like \\"Sweet, it's on.  Let's do this up righteous!\\"  \\n\\nOur waiter was friendly and nice enough.  He introduced himself as Rashaad, but said we could call him \\"Bacon.\\"  We laughed and thought he was really humorous and friendly.  On his recommendation, we ordered the thief size of the Steele Pinot Noir and it was really good.  He also recommended the scallops for my wife.  We placed our order for the empanada appetizer, my wife got the scallops and I ordered the brisket.\\n\\nThe empanadas were really good with a yummy flavor to the meat inside a flaky crust.  We cleaned this plate bare it was so good.  Everything was tracking along nicely until this point...right up until our entrees arrived.  My wife immediately felt the scallops were really chewy and rubbery, which was a sign of either not being fresh, or being overly cooked.  Out of the four on her plate, she could only manage to eat just one.  My brisket was perfectly cooked to the point that the meat was breaking apart with just my fork.  However, there was no flavor to the meat whatsoever.  They prepared this cut of meat flawlessly, but somehow failed to put any seasoning in it at all.  I loved the texture but could not taste any flavor of any kind.  I eventually had to ask Bacon to bring us a small dish of BBQ sauce just to punch up the taste a bit.  When he came back, he noticed my wife hadn't eaten the rest of her scallops.  We told him they were chewy and didn't taste right.  He apologized and took them away and then apologized for the brisket being so bland.  He asked if she wanted to try something else, but she declined.  After I finished the doctored brisket, they brought out dessert menus.  Out of the 5 different items listed, none of them sounded particularly amazing, so we just asked for the check.  When it came, they had not removed the scallops or given us any sort of discount of any kind.  I was about to demand they remove the scallops, but my wife wouldn't let me make a scene.  So we paid the bill in full with a full 20% tip and quietly left.  Given the entrees that were not very well prepared and the lack of comping the mistake from our bill, I'm quite certain we'll not be visiting this place again any time soon.  It's a shame because it used to be so wonderful."},{"name":"The Ocoee Taco Company","address":"40 Taylor St","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4.5","text":"Fantastic Yelp find!!\\n\\nThis is exactly the kind of business Yelp is made for!

The large group inside cleared out and service, even though the place was crowded, was very quick. The salsa was fabulous. It was watery but with an excellent flavor and chunks of avocado.

Even more aggravating are how many panhandlers and drug addicts surround the store's tiny entrance, leaving traffic direction up to the patrons. Maybe I'm just getting older and veering more towards healthier options, or maybe the bizarre cereal toppings don't turn me on anymore, but in an age when you can do so much with pastries, I don't know why a Voodoo Donut of all things should be so limited.\\n\\nTo the store's credit, prices are extremely reasonable for the area, vegan options are available, and of the limited 24 hour places in the city, it's a reliable place to stop in for a late night snack, but sometimes it's better just to go home."},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Jimmy \\"Bad Boy\\" Sullivan is the man!

I ordered a chicken pita and a cup of the Greek lemon-chicken soup (I can't recall the proper name for it, but it's a staple at a lot of Greek restaurants and it's yummy). The soup tasted pretty good, but it was cold. I didn't want to bother them over that since the flavor was still good, but it seemed odd for it to be cold since it wasn't sitting out long or anything. The chicken pita was pretty good. I liked the flavor of the chicken and I always love a good tzatziki sauce and this one tasted fresh and had a lot of flavor. I did feel that it was underfilled compared to other spots I've been to. Usually, I can hardly finish one, but this one was on the smaller side for the price in my opinion and lacking in the amount of chicken. \\n\\nOverall, Little Greek is an okay spot.

The bartenders were great to small talk with and gave us a little rundown of the place. We were hungry and decided to go for some food in what is a beautifully furnished restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating in a garden. We stuck with indoor and went straight to business. We got a beer flight and tried out the ruby beer everyone has been raving about. We both fancied it and got ourselves some pints. The food options here are incredible, and the service here is just amazing!! I'll post pictures of the food and setting. The halls are that of an old school with water fountains, old wood flooring and heavy metal heaters. There are small bars like detention which is a whiskey tasting room and honors class. The icing on the cake has got to be the theater. $20 gets you 2 movie tickets and 2 beers. OHHHMYYYGAAAAD. I was so happy. We watched Guardians of the galaxy 2 in cozy sofas with beers in our hands.

So for that, I downgrade to 3 stars."},{"name":"McMenamins Kennedy School","address":"5736 NE 33rd Ave.","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I've had some great times at this place. Last summer, I had my family visiting and we stayed here for a night as an anniversary treat for my parents. They love to stay at very simple motels, so this place was out of the norm for them--but they loved it! They aren't from the Pacific NW at all, but they fit right in with the culture and art. We ate dinner and breakfast on the property, enjoyed some drinks in the bar, and, best of all, took a long and restorative soak in the salt water pool after a long day of hiking.\\n\\nBut this review is more narrow in scope, really just for the Cypress Room bar that I visited last weekend. We strolled around the property on Sunday afternoon looking for the bar with the right vibe for us. We wanted something chill with some space to spread out, play a game, and enjoy some nice drinks. The bars at Kennedy School tend to focus on certain alcohols more than others and Cypress is the rum-focused one, but our reasons for choosing it were more about the vibe. Does rum create the vibe? Maybe it does.\\n\\nFor round 1, we had a mai tai and a caipirinha. It was my first-ever mai tai and not the sort of thing I typically order. I like simple drinks like whiskey sours or even just whiskey and sodas or, if I'm feeling fancy, a mint julep. I wasn't sure if I would like the mai tai, but I loved it. Not too sweet, not too strong. In the background, the bartender was putting on various reggae and ska vinyls which led to a lot of spontaneous and not-cool-but-I-don't-care dancing in my seat.\\n\\nThey were also advertising a special cherry whiskey sour for the season on the table and even those it was the rum bar, I couldn't help myself--I needed to try the McMenamin's brand whiskey with this cherry mixer. I didn't regret it. If every whiskey sour was a cherry whiskey sour, I'd probably be a happier man--and I say that as someone who routinely drinks whiskey sours.\\n\\nOne quick thing I would add is that this bar is even cooler at night than during the day. I'd stopped in briefly with my family during our stay in August. All of the lanterns and colors were really popping at night."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Love this place we love to visit often since we found it! \\n\\nFound this place by accident on while looking for a casual meal. \\n\\nThe look of the place is amazing it's very modern, clean, and sleek.

However, don't be fooled by the shack appeal because the food/drinks are on the pricey side. Definitely will be going back and trying different food and cocktails!  Reservations will be helpful since it's a small restaurant. Filled up pretty quickly while we were dining. \\n\\nParking/Location: They offer free valet parking and have very limited street parking. It's in a sketchy location so just be cautious of your surroundings. We had a random guy approach us while we were waiting for valet to bring our car and he was talking about how he just got released from prison and whatnot and needed money. So just be smart and aware of your surroundings. \\n\\nAmbience/Service: I was expecting an upscale restaurant just based on how the photos in the food section looked on yelp but as I walked in it was very causal place. The decor is chic and very small restaurant. We had reservations and got seated immediately. Our waiter was knowledgeable and gave great recommendations. The food came fairly quickly but we were also having an early dinner at 5:45-6pm. We ordered the lobster Mac and cheese to share and it was AMAZING!!! If you love Mac and cheese then this is a must!!! I'm not a lobster fan but I love lobster Mac and cheese and this was perfection. The lobster was cut into smaller pieces than what I've been used too but still delicious! Also it's a huge portion so great for sharing. For the entree my husband and I shared the fried grouper and OMG the presentation was beyond my expectations (even after I saw yelp photos). I was a little hesitant about the pineapple flavor since I do not like sweet flavors in my food but this was perfection. It was recommended by our waiter and I wish I didn't eat so much mac and cheese because I was semi stuffed by the time the entree came around. A must try and again this entree was shareable! As far as drinks go my husband had the Rhett's old fashion which he enjoyed and I had the dark and stormy. Unfortunately, I hate doing this but I had to send my drink back because it tasted like cough medicine to me. I love Moscow mules and I love spicy drinks so this was technically right up my ally but not so much. I felt terrible because the manager actually makes the ginger beer himself! I then ordered the black cherry sling. When I tasted this drink, it tasted like cough medicine again I knew it was ME and not the drinks. I was just getting over the common cold so maybe all the drinks tasted the same. Of course my husband thought I was crazy but he enjoyed my drink. Surprisingly, the manager took one of the drinks off of my tab which was a pleasant surprise.

But this past Friday (July 22, 2016) my coworkers had an outing here after work and since the bill was paid for by the company I decided to see what Two Urban Licks was all about.  \\n\\nTwo Urban Licks is located in the trendy Virginia Highland section of Atlanta, near Midtown and the Little Five Points area.  The parking lot is kind of small but they have valet parking for your convenience.  After meeting up with the rest of my crew, it wasn't long at all before we were escorted to our spacious table area.  The restaurant is mostly upscale in terms of looks and prices but the clientele was refreshingly middle class and diverse.  No one looked at me funny for wearing sneakers and jeans because most of the customers there had on similar attire, although there were some who were dressed more fashionable.  No one I saw had on suits or ties though.  \\n\\nThe lighting was romantically dim with little lights in the middle of the tables and the place smelled so good that you could almost taste your dish before you received it.  There were musicians on keyboard and guitar softly playing mostly blues and jazz.  If you want, you can walk to the middle of the restaurant and see scrumptious food being cooked and wood roasted.  We were there in the afternoon but I heard from one of my coworkers who'd been there before that if you come later, you'll see a great view of Atlanta's skyline all lit up at night.\\n\\nI want to make sure and recognize our waiter.  I believe his name is Dwayne, but he is a young, black male with neat dreadlocks.  He was very pleasant and treated our table as if we were the only ones in the restaurant.  He had the patience of Job, especially when one woman in our party kept flirting with him and interrupting by asking detailed questions about   the menu even though I'm sure she already knew the answers to her questions.  It was extraordinary customer service that should be commended. \\n\\nThe drinks were served first.  I haven't drank alcohol since the year 2009, so I can't give an opinion on their spirits; but my coworkers seemed to really be enjoying them while I drank my water and Coca-Cola.   \\n\\nThe food was outstanding!  It was a bit pricey but since it was on the company's tab, we got whatever we wanted.  My eyes were bigger than my stomach and I ended up full before I could consume my whole meal.  I had the Shellfish Wood Roast (consisting of lobster, shrimp and mussels bathed in garlic and lemon juice).  It cost $38.  I also had a $7 serving of mac and cheese.  While I was waiting for my meal to be prepared, one of my friends let me have a taste of her exotically named Shaved Calamari (priced $11).  It was so good that I almost wish I'd ordered that instead of what I had.  Most of the dishes were seafood but my supervisor had something called the Big Ass Burger ($19).   They also have wood roasted vegetables ($7) and collards ($6) on the menu.  \\n\\nIf gluttony is a sin, I paved my way to hell last Friday.  I left with a full belly and some remnants of my feast on my shirt even though I had a huge cloth napkin in my lap.  It was worth every drop though.  If there are few things I can mildly deduct points for, it would have to be the prices of the food and that while some of us were waiting on our order after the appetizers, the silverware was placed naked on the table without the napkins put underneath.  Also, the mac and cheese (while very good) was a little creamy once you got below the delicious skin on top of it.  But on the grand scale of things, those were very small nitpicks.  This is a very nice restaurant and I can imagine it would be a great place to take that someone special for a romantic night out."},{"name":"Rosie's Coffee Cafe","address":"2330 Sylvan Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Hmmmm \\nYou know it's always a risk when an establishment opens a second location.

I got the lobster fried rice and he got the fried chicken.\\n\\nLobster fried rice: This seemed like the most popular dish and I wanted to try it out. I think my expectations were too high because it was a little disappointing. It tasted a lot like Korean bibimbap (mixed rice; not fried) than fried rice. The lobster was really good though. It was cooked just right and was not rubbery at all. The price is steep at $37, but it's lobster, and for those who like bibimbap, it'd be worth it.\\n\\nFried chicken: I liked this so much more. The fried chicken was cooked to perfection. The meat was juicy and tender, while the outside was crispy. The seasoning of the batter was good yet not too salty or overpowering. The lobster mac n cheese, as well as the collard greens, were so good. I totally wanted to switch dishes with my boyfriend. Worth $25.\\n\\nI enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant.

Our goal for the upcoming year is to experience each of the Dispatch's top 10 restaurants in Columbus, and Black Creek was the only one out of the four or five that were participating in restaurant week that had a vegetarian option on their fixed-price menu, so it was the obvious choice.  On top of that, they offered a four-course menu, instead of the typical three-course.  Thus, Black Creek started out having won my heart a little, by allowing me to truly participate in the glory of restaurant week.  By the end of the night, it had won my heart completely.\\n\\nTHE PROS:\\nthe food. oh my god, the food. most of the time when I go out and am impressed by a meal, the innovation of the dishes plays a large part. \\"hmm!\\" I think. \\"this is so tasty and I would have never thought to make this combination of flavors!\\"  Black Creek only did that to me sparingly.  there was a smoky tomato vinaigrette that was very different from what I'm used to, and the mushroom ceviche was unfamiliar to me. however, Black Creek truly wowed with execution.  I was eating potatoes prepared the same way that my mother has prepared them for my entire life, but I felt like I had never experienced anything a tenth as delicious in my entire life.  I normally do not enjoy \\"American\\" cuisine, but this was absolutely fantastic.  my dinner partner and I did not talk the entire drive home.  I can't speak for her reasons, but I know that for me, it was because I was mentally walking myself back through the entire meal while it was still fresh in my mind.\\nthe service. our server was very nice and helpful.  he was not the most professional, but he substituted friendliness for professionalism, and that fit the overall feel of the restaurant.  when I mentioned at the end of the meal that I had fallen in love with the food but that we were students, he pointed me to the lunch menu, which is very reasonably priced, at about $8-10 for a sandwich and side.\\nthe ambiance. Black Creek is loud, friendly, and has a setup that encourages talking to your neighbors without mandating it.  the tables are close together, but in a way that I found cozy, as opposed to claustrophobic.  we got good advice on which dessert to pick from our next-door neighbor on one side (polenta with plum sauce!!!!), but did not disturb our neighbors on the other side.\\nthat polenta deserves a special mention. my friend commented that, on its own, it justified the $30 menu.\\n\\nTHE (potential) CONS:\\nthe restaurant was a bit loud and very casual.  it's not necessarily a con, but it is definitely something to keep in mind.\\n\\nI am in LOVE with Black Creek.

At 1:30, I slid into the tiny parking lot and hoofed it through the rickety entrance door and into the Atlanta Room. I love just sitting in that room, letting memories flood over me, listening to the symphony of polite chatter and busy silverware. \\"Fried Shrimp and Oysters platter, turnip greens, and mac 'n cheese, corn muffins, and unsweetened tea\\" were what I wrote on the little order slip. Ten minutes later my freshly fried seafood and veggies arrived, and I dug in. The food was perfectly done in the Southern style I have grown up with right here in Atlanta, Chamblee, and Waycross. The nostalgia of the room and the area only added to my enjoyment. Back in 1979, I took a job that was supposed to change my life in Houston. Oh, what a change in cuisine!

After waiting over 30 minutes, half the party received their food. We waited patiently for the other half of the food to arrive so that we could enjoy our meal together. As a fast food eatery, this establishment is anything BUT. Our friends approached the counter on more than one occasion to ask for the status of their food and to which they responded it would be out shortly. Another ten minutes pass, and we now approach the server. The server disputes back and forth with our party about the multiple reasons \\"why\\" our food is not out yet, first blaming the kitchen, then saying we didn't ask HIM directly (how would we know which person to ask?), then stating it's because the ticket fell on the floor. Based off previous reviews, it seems like this \\"lost ticket\\" is their go-to excuse. The server then said that the owner never told him we'd been waiting on our food, to which I asked him to bring out the owner for us to speak to. We see him enter the kitchen and speak to the owner, gesturing towards our table, making eye contact with myself, and then continuing to serve every party that arrived after us. When it comes to dining establishments, regardless of fast food or not, there is a duty to offer a pleasant dining experience to its patrons. If anyone had shown a shred of apologetic behavior, we'd have let it go. However, due to the lack of professionalism, and the disappearing act of the owner when summoned by his patrons, our food experience was less than desirable. \\n\\nThe food would have been great, had I not waited over 30 minutes for my friends to receive their food. At that point, my tostada became soggy and collapsed on the first bite. I'm certain it would have been delicious if it was fresh.

Loved the plant wall on one side of the restaurant. They have a great patio space that opens up to the belt line. If you are on a date and actually want to talk to them this may be a suitable area to hit up. We had a larger party and still thought we made a good call to sit outside. Our Service was impeccable very quick and able to separate the checks with ease. The food is where I was hesitant on giving a great review. It's not bad but it's not phenomenal. We ordered the hush puppies and famous salmon chips for starters. Salmon chips are bland. And i hate to say that but they are. I know serpa \\"copied\\" two urban licks (as mentioned by the server) but i would say there's has a bit more flavor. The hush puppies were delightful I'd say that was my favorite thing over the course of our meal. It has a nice kick and it was fried so well. The main meal i got the chicken which normally i steer clear of ordering chicken at restaurants but nothing else was jumping out to me oddly. And the burger was sold out. My partner got the brisket. Chicken was dry which is why i tend to avoid ordering it out. However the sweetwater au jus was delightful i wish there was more of it to smother the dry chicken in all its delicious flavor. The Mac n cheese as the side was good as well. My spouses brisket was mediocre again nothing outstanding. However it was cooked well and fell apart rather easy just again not blown away.

I got one of my favourite Thai dishes, pad prik king, which should be long beans with chicken- THIGH- stir-fried in a rich red curry without coconut milk, so it's almost a sort of dry curry. I was so happy to see it on the menu that I ordered it straightaway, with plain jasmine rice. Okay, every Thai resto in the country is guilty of this, but I have to say- why is rice extra?? That's like ordering a bolognese and having to pay extra for pasta, or like ordering a sandwich and having to pay extra for bread. At this place, an \\"order\\" of jasmine rice is barely a cup and I had to ration it to fill out my meal. The curry itself- well, I wanted chicken but was informed that it was that horrible part of the chicken known as the breast, so it'd be all dry and terrible, so I ordered pork instead. I get my dish and the portion is meagre and unbalanced- FAR too sweet. I didn't enjoy it; it has almost none of the lime leaf that makes this dish and not a speck of chili.

Seriously, it's a tourist trap, and you will be disappointed.\\n\\nMy husband and I came here on a weeknight because we didn't want to get stuck with the weekend bustle. We were right to do so, but apparently, this also meant that we would get terrible service - although, I suspect it was just the particular server that we had.\\n\\nThese are the only times we ever saw our server:\\n- Taking our drink order\\n- Bringing our drink order/complimentary bread\\n- Taking our food order \\n- Getting one drink refill/getting our check\\n- Returning with our credit card\\n\\nShe wasn't even the person who brought our food. Considering that I sat with an empty glass for over 75% of our meal, she probably needed to come check on us more often. \\n\\nI absolutely despise having to do the whole look-around-to-see-where-our-server-is-thing, and that's what we ended up doing a majority of the time we dined here. \\n\\nNot to mention, our table was dirty when we were seated, and we had to ask for silverware. Because it took so long to get any, we were going to just take some from neighboring tables. Surprisingly, the waitress came back to take our order, so we asked for it then.\\n\\nAnd we haven't even gotten to the food yet!\\n\\nMy food arrived partially cold, and the server forgot my green beans when putting my order in. I ordered the Fried Chicken Wings meal with green beans, mashed potatoes, and sweet potato souffle (extra side).\\n\\nEverything, but 2 wings and my green beans, were cold. The only reason the green beans weren't cold is because she had forgotten to put it in, so she had to rush back to the kitchen to have them scoop it fresh.  \\n\\nI have no idea why only a couple wings were hot, and they were the ones I ate last, so I know it isn't because they were sitting there while I was eating. The cold ones tasted stale, like they were extras that had been sitting on a plate back in the kitchen. \\n\\nThe fried chicken itself was okay - I've definitely had better. I found the meat inside dry and the outside breading too hard - probably because they had been sitting and/or refried. The flavor was mediocre to me. I was expecting to be blown away, but that definitely didn't happen.\\n\\nThe sides were typical - nothing special. My husband got the Fried Catfish. His food tasted better than mine, and for a place that parades its deliciousness of its fried chicken - the fried chicken should have tasted better.\\n\\nFor his sides, he got fried okra and mac n' cheese. As other reviewers have mentioned, their mac n' cheese was clumpy and not saucy whatsoever. It was as if they just dumped a bunch of shredded cheese on top of some macaroni and called it a day. It was disgusting, and a total disappointment for my husband. Mac n' cheese is his favorite food, and they just utterly did not try with it here.\\n\\nBecause of the poor service, we opted to skip dessert from here because we didn't want to wait for it.\\n\\nIf you can overlook the poor service and mediocre food, it's a cute and cozy restaurant. You can basically come dressed as you are, which is an atmosphere that I like when I'm looking to relax.\\n\\nI likely won't ever come back, as there's no shortage of fried chicken in Atlanta.

Awful Service from Bartender!\\n\\nFirst time that I've ever been inclined to write a review, but this experience bothered me so much that I felt I had to. Went to this location tonight (1/4/2018) with a friend and there were two bartenders on staff....a female that was great and a male (Asian, long hair tied back) that was terrible. We've both been here many times and have had good experiences, but this one was particularly bad. At first it was all good as the female bartender was making a drink that I like (a Toronto) so we felt it was a good sign. The other bartender came by after some time and took our order....when he tried to take my drink menu, I asked if I could keep it. He huffed and walked away. Not sure why this was a weird request as I like to look at the other drinks with the intention of ordering more aka a good thing for the bartender. He came back to get our food order and snatched the menu away so harshly that he hit something. Don't know what was going on with this guy. My friend and I both ordered the Monkfish Schnitzel, which wasn't good. It was certainly not Schnitzel....an overly floured, thick piece of sauteed fish. Not sure if bartender had anything to do with this, but he never came back to us after our food order. Never! Not to check on food, or to get more drinks or anything. The girl (who was great!) came by and grabbed another drink order ( I didn't get another, but through a misunderstanding, I was made a drink...she took it off the bill). Asian guy completely ignored us, talked with his friends, purposely avoided us......and all for what??? Because I had the audacity to want to keep the drink menu?? Really terrible service and I hope people stay away from him.

It's listed as appetizer but it can be a main dish too. octopus was cooked to perfection, but still had the texture of an octopus. STAR OF THE NIGHT was the shrimp toast!!! I can't say enough about this. The toast is buttered perfectly and soaks up the juices of the shrimp. The shrimp is cooked beautifully and with the buttery spicy sauce, it's the best shrimp dish I've ever had! This is truly the must order of the night. Pictures don't do this dish justice. It's messy but def worth it \\n\\nOrdered the lobster roll. It's pretty good but I've definitely had my fair share of lobster rolls from CA and this is probably in the middle spectrum. It's good and refreshing because it has butter and mayo, topped with chives and celery leaves which makes it tastes really good. The bread is a little thicker than I'd like but over all, a really good dish \\n\\nLastly- service was perfection. We had Eli for the evening and she was so attentive without being over bearing. She was just a genuinely nice and friendly person."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great pizza.\\n\\nIf you want to eat in, there is always a wait.

Just posted as middle of the road until we can actually get in.\\n\\n**Note, we have never eaten here because of the wait.  I am sure the food is great and people who I trust have loved your cuisine.  \\n\\n**Note #2 - they have added more waiting space in early 2016 so some of the issues might have been worked out.\\n\\nWe dine out quite a bit in Austin and truly enjoy our growing food scene.  Try to support the hard working people that are killing themselves to bring our town such great representation.\\n\\nWe have been twice (4/16 and 4/23) and did not eat either night.  We opted out of waiting both nights.\\n\\nA few reasons:\\n1. The wait - two hours for a Saturday night is fine for walk ins but you can't go or plan ahead.  They don't take reservations, they don't take call ins, they don't do anything to make it easy to put your name in.  Even Odd Duck and Uchi have a limited number of reservations per night that you can call ahead and plan around.\\n\\n2. What to do during your wait - there is no real bar.  You can't sit at the bar because that is reserved for people that are eating.  You have to go outside - so if it is hot, raining, cold, whatever, you cannot enjoy anything.\\n\\n3. What to do during your wait part 2 - there are no other bars around (like Tigress/Drink.Well with Foreign & Domestic or Henri's with Barley Swine) there is nothing else around this place.  No other bar you can go to and wait.\\n\\n4. Hosting Staff - Understand that you have a hot place but you cannot be rude or short with peple that come to ask about your \\"no reservation policy\\" - Understand that it is getting old and people are shocked that the wait is so long, but you have to smile and answer their questions if they want you to come back.  Twice we have been and the second time we were even willing to wait but the attitude was still the same.  When you get treated poorly by the first person you interact with, you don't want to give that place your money.  \\n**Note, we have been told twice by the host staff that the only time the wait is not longer than 30 min is Mondays at 5 pm.  If you like eating Monday at 5 pm, that is fine but that is not an acceptable answer.\\n\\nPlease consider changing your policy and open a few spaces for reservations each night.  Very few restaurants actually make it over time and if you don't have some way to plan an evening, it will cut down on your chances of succeeding.  We all know about the time to wait at Franklin's but that is truly the exception.\\n\\nBest of Luck."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I was so excited to try the donuts here because of all the hype but it really disappointed me.

She answered everyone's questions and guided us with suggested based on what each of us wanted. \\n\\nThe group started with appetizers that were good. The calamari was tender and the bruchetta solid. The mussels though were over done more than a Jean Claude Van Damm movie!

The seafood was decent but again seemed either frozen and reheated or just plainly overlooked. It lacked in seasoning and the pasta just wasn't tender and that good. One of us ordered eggplant parm and he had to send it back because it was cold. All they did was stick it back in the broiler to heat it up. The highlight was the filet that was ordered. Flavor was good but medium came out medium plus which means it came off the grill at the right time and sat in the \\"window\\" too long and kept cooking. It tasted the best of all the dishes. Madison told us it would be! \\n\\nThe night fell upon us and the wine starting catching up and so of course we had to order desert. I didn't try any of the others but the cannoli was very good and my highlight to the night other than the incredible companions and service by Madison. \\n\\nThis was a decent meal and a nice evening.

This is largely due to the outsized influence of ramen chains such as Ippudo and Ichiran, which serve Hakata-style ramen that emphasize pork bone tonkotsu broths, thin noodles, pork belly, and occasional splashes of spice.  \\n\\nAnd Jinya follows this template well.  My Tonkotsu Black Ramen bowl featured a very porky and rich broth spruced up with black garlic oil, fried garlic, and scallions.  The noodles, which I asked to be cooked firm, were a little softer than expected and were thin and straight in the style of Hakata ramen.  The pork belly chashu was very tender, sliced thin and quite fatty.  \\n\\nIt's a pretty good adaptation of Hakata ramen of the kind you would find at an Ippudo or Ichiran chain, but there are points where the product can be improved--the chashu in particular--or diversified--like introducing some clearer broths like soy sauce and/or salt.  My main reservation is Jinya's approach is inherently conservative, that it's not really expanding Americans' ramen knowledge or palette at its numerous chains across the US.\\n\\nThat said, the crispy chicken (Japanese-style fried chicken, karaage) was really excellent, fried perfectly with potato flour breading just like you would find in Japan.  I can't praise it enough.  Be prepared for 30+ minute waits in the evenings, esp. on the weekends. Special shout-out to the hostess who accommodated my request for a well-lighted table, and to our server Sebastian, who patiently answered a number of my questions about the business model and about which ramen I should order that would showcase Jinya's strengths.  Service is wonderful here.\\n\\nParking: A special note should be made that parking can be very difficult at Jinya due to numerous parking spots marked \\"Reserved for D. Geller & Son\\" in the shared lot.  Two or three reserved spots may make sense, but there are easily 8+ spots placed seemingly at random like ships on a Battleship! board.   The entire parking lot is filled with cars braking suddenly at half-turn with frustrated drivers realizing the empty spot actually belonging to D. Geller & Son.  It's incredibly annoying and unnecessary.\\n\\nOverall, Jinya is a good introduction to ramen and appeals to those who are interested in rich/thick broths.  Its menu does have some strict boundaries though, and despite its 4.5 Yelp rating, I would not say it's the best ramen in Atlanta.\\n\\nFollow @willchews"},{"name":"French Press Bakery & Cafe","address":"74 Chapel St","city":"Needham","stars":"4","text":"Overpriced and snobby.

I feel that it is very limited, and there are only 1-2 options in regards of dumplings. \\n\\nOtherwise delicious! I had beef ho fun, shrimp chili wontons, and XLB. I definitely want to come back here during happy hour to see what the prices versus portions are. \\n\\n\\nI recommend this location. It's good for beginners who want to try dumplings. The broth is delicious within the dumplings itself."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Just no.  I expected this to be a....Tea room...you know with scones, tea and finger sandwiches etc.  so many people I know have raved about this place so I was really excited about trying this one!  Then I find out it's southern soul food....ok great...I love that too...\\nNo....it is like eating horrible cafeteria food.  Restaurant was old, dirty and food was not at all up to par with the southern home cooking my mom can dish out."},{"name":"Upper Left Roasters","address":"1204 SE Clay St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Savannah made the best poached-medium egg today!"},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"As an Atlanta native, I'm a bit ashamed to say this but...I'd never went to Mary Mac's until my job's Christmas party was hosted there.\\n\\nThere...I said it. Now to the real deal:\\n\\nThe food is absolutely delicious! The fried chicken is great, on the small side, but great. But the broccoli and cheese casserole is even better! It was probably my favorite side dish and I make a habit of ordering some at every chance I get. It's that good!\\n\\nThe service is always top notch and I have no complaints whatsoever. As long as they don't take the casserole off of their menu, I'm straight."},{"name":"Taqueria Portland","address":"820 SE 8th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I lost count after the 19th taco.

We were given the usual 20-30 minute time frame to come pick up. All was good.\\n\\nI got there exactly 30 minutes after ordering. There was a line of about 4-5 people waiting. I waited 10 minutes for them to work through the line. I paid and was then told it will be a few minutes. \\nAs i waited.... 10 more people came in and picked up their order. \\n40 minutes later.......yes 40, one of the 8 employees that were working at the time looked at the top of the oven, grabbed 2 boxes that had been there the entire time and handed them to me. \\n\\nNo apology, no explanation, no thank you,  no nothing.... just here ya go.\\n\\nWas not happy with the experience."}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(s=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return s.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"search-container"},N={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],j={key:0},D={key:1};function L(s,e,n,f,i,r){const u=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",H,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",N,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(u,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",D,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",j,"See more"))],8,E)):w("",!0)])}const F=c(R,[["render",L],["__scopeId","data-v-f9ae1456"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/61.md","filePath":"guide/61.md"}'),G={name:"guide/61.md"},Y=Object.assign(G,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(F)]))}});export{V as __pageData,Y as default};
