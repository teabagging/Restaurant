We waited about 10 minutes which wasn't bad for brunch although I called ahead and they said there was no wait. While we waited we asked if we could order our mimosas which of course we wanted since it was brunch time. They had a little make-shift bar area right at the door run by what seemed to be an inexperienced bartender who fumbled around while making Bloody Marys for the party ahead of us. We didn't get to order our mimosas because we were seated before he got to us.\\nThe ambiance is industrial chic which you would expect in an area like this. We were seated near the restroom which I hate but didn't complain because we were starving. \\nOur waiter Ryan was nice and knowledgeable about the menu. He suggested the Challah French Toast which I figured I would get since I looked at the menu before arriving. There was also another french toast option that was savory with spinach which I was debating. I settled on the Challah with chicken sausage. It was exceptional! I was also able to order the house grapefruit house mimosa (Ryan suggested) which was very good! \\nOverall a good experience but some of the breakfast items did not include meat, you have to order it ala cart which drove up the already pricey options. $25 for french toast, two chicken sausage circles and one mimosa for one person.

A side of cous cous was ordered by one diner, expecting vegetables in it, but was disappointed when it arrived naked ($6)\\n\\nMain entre's: Tilefish $28 was the highlight (they ran out of monkfish--which was fine).  Venison, house specialty @ $34 was not quite up to the hype I've read elsewhere (Addison-AJC).  But, it was flavorful, and ample. Grilled trout $25, was another winner.

Everything else is 0 stars .\\n\\nSTORY TIME\\n\\nBad experience #1: terrible thunderstorm last year nocked out the power during a pay per view and they kicked everyone out  and refused to refund the cover charge for the pay per view that nobody there got to see. We ended up at Bikinis, where we also had to pay cover and stand to see the main event as it was packed and there was nowhere to sit. \\n\\nBad experience #2: me and another friend met up with another group of friends that were already there. We all sat at the same table but we were all going to take separate checks. The waitress  seemed nice and friendly and she was cute, but slow. We all waited forever for our drinks as she flirted with guys at nearby tables. My dosaritas were already melting when i got them. Checks come and she splits them. Me and my friends believe in tipping based on service. The better the service the better the tip. Bad service gets half of the minimum  gratuity. One of my friends paid with cash and she just assumed that the $15 in change was for her to keep. My friend was going to tip her, but not $15. Anyhow, when he asked for his change this cute little lady sprouted devil horns. She said \\"well i thought it was a tip. I only get paid $2.15 an hour to dress like  this and serve you people\\" as she looked at my  group like we were beneath her as if it was our fault she chose to apply and work  there. They went to the manager and as they were talking to the manager she was talking to another waitress calling us some ugly stuff and being a straight up witch. And then as we left she shouted something about using that money to buy some decency and that she hopes we feel good about it.\\n\\nTHE END"},{"name":"Pasquale's Pizza & Pub","address":"7875 Ryan Pkwy","city":"Plain City","stars":"3.5","text":"Good pizza and nice to have in Plain City.

Something about the decor and ambiance settles well with me, and I'll always wait the few minutes longer for a booth.  (The high backs and added privacy make the night!)\\n\\nI've eaten at three Ted's locations, and they all are about the same to me.  Consistent quality and waitstaff.  They pay attention to environmental issues and are quick to point out on the table trifold that their straws are paper based, and take out containers made of cornstarch.  With this particular location, they offer valet, but I've never understood the point when they park your car for you in a lot less than 200 feet away when you can self park yourself.  Don't be afraid to ask to do it yourself.\\n\\nWhen I first started eating at Ted's, I'd always get the Bison burger, but now I'd switched over to their beef steak.  It's prepared so well that I pass up the bison option (mostly because I can't justify paying the price for the Bison steak!).  The rolls that come with dinner are amazing, and I always have to fight the urge to ask for another! The appetizer pickles are an aquired taste, but I enjoy them as well.\\n\\nI've noticed from other's orders who have gotten the ribs that not much comes out on the plate, and the same can be said of the shrimp cocktail.\\n\\nI'd recommend Ted's for those looking for a nice evening out where dressed up jeans won't be out of place.

We were offered the option to sit at the bar in front of the open kitchen and watch the chefs at work, and we jumped at the opportunity.\\n\\nFirst, the cocktails:  We had the turnip vodka tonic, the Hogtied cocktail, made with \\"pork rhum,\\" kirschwasser, vermouth, bitters and salted cherry, and the green strawberry caiphirina.  Enjoyed all very much (Hogtied was chosen the overall winner).\\n\\nWe are adventurous diners and tried to sample most of the dishes, although we waved the white flag of surrender before accomplishing that.  \\n\\nWe tried:\\n\\nKobe beef tartare\\nFresh local vegetable salad with olive oil \\"pollen\\"\\nSpring pea risotto with pancetta and strawberry\\nSoft shell crab\\nVeal sweetbreads with kohlrabi, bacon and apple butter\\nFrog legs\\nFresh tagliatelle with pork ragu\\nSpanish octopus with red peas\\nSmoked salmon croquette\\nWarm banana pudding\\n\\nWe passed on the celeriac dish due to a food allergy, and didn't make it to the braised oxtails or duck breast.\\n\\nEach dish was artfully plated and as pleasing to the eye as to the palate. It's still hard to choose a favorite as I would gladly have all of them again except for the smoked salmon croquette, which was the least successful dish in my opinion.  The soft shell crab was a standout - deep fried in a delicate batter that allowed the taste of the crab to shine through. The tagliatelle was another - I'm Italian from the NYC area, and grew up on fresh pasta, and know how easily it can be overcooked to a mushy mess. This was perfectly al dente, with a hearty pork ragu flecked with fennel and olives and dusted with parmigiano-reggiano.  The Kobe beef tartare was our first dish and a great way to start - refreshing and appetite-stimulating. The frog legs were crispy, juicy and the spicy sauce drizzled over them added a bit of a kick. The spring pea risotto was another example of a dish that quickly turn gloppy in the wrong hands, but this was creamy, toothsome and tasted like spring. The pancetta and strawberry garnishes added just the right salty and tart contrast to the creaminess of the risotto.  The local vegetable salad was a delight - we were asked our opinion as we were told it was a brand new menu item. The seasonal vegetables - some raw, some roasted, some crispy - were super fresh and dusted with what was described as \\"pollen\\" but I can only recall that olive oil was an ingredient. It was an explosion of fresh spring flavors on the palate.\\n\\nI love octopus, and this version was flavorful but one or two pieces were a little tough. The red peas that accompanied them were delicious.  The sweetbreads were a revelation - rich, creamy and perfectly cooked, served with bacon, kohlrabi, apple butter and sesame seeds. \\n\\nI wanted to like the salmon (the chef who presented it to us was the most outgoing of all that night) - but unfortunately the croquette was on the dry side and did not hold together well. The beet \\"borscht\\" puree it sat on was an inspired pairing, reminding me of the Jewish delis in NYC.\\n\\nWe somehow managed to leave room for dessert so we could taste the warm banana pudding, made from chef-owner Kevin Gillespie's grandmother's recipe. We were told that this is the only item that has consistently remained on the menu since Gunshow opened. We were also told that the reason it's made with pound cake and not the usual vanilla wafers is that the cookies didn't exist yet when Kevin's grandma first began making the dish. It was a perfect ending to the meal.\\n\\nWe didn't think the meal was overpriced at all, but then again we live in the NYC and LA metro areas and are used to paying much more for a meal like this.\\n\\nWe thought the staff was excellent as well - we were very well taken care of, and my dining partner's food allergy was hand written on the menu sheet and each chef took note while serving us, alerting us to dishes that contained these items. I liked the industrial, casual vibe and the metal music (though if you are looking for a romantic setting, this might not be your best bet).\\n\\nA final positive note for us was when the hostess checked up on us during our meal and talked about Kevin Gillespie (not there the night we dined - he's got his own restaurant group and is also coming out with another cookbook). She told us that he is the best employer she's ever worked for and that he is extremely good to his employees and the neighborhood. The 5-day work week and 3-hour dining window shows that he cares about both, and that made our amazing dinner even sweeter.\\n\\nWe will definitely return next time we're in town."},{"name":"Counter Cafe East","address":"1914 E 6th St, Ste A","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Although the food is really good here, the place is always ridiculous busy. Today, we waited 1 hour for a table for 2 even though we were told it was a 15 minute wait. After the hostess sat at least 6 parties before us, I inquired to which she said larger parties are seated first so they don't wait more than an hour. So the moral of the story here is if you are a party of 2 or smaller, you have to wait behind everyone else. This ruined the entire lunch/brunch experience. Won't be coming back again."},{"name":"Bella Vista","address":"288 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm thoroughly impressed, especially considering the prime real estate Bella Vista holds on Hanover Street.\\n\\nThe prices are more than fair. The food is basic, well flavored and very good. The portions are large, but not two-meals-, roll home- or skip dessert-large. The wine list is fairly impressive considering both price and selection. Even the house wine is pretty respectable.\\n\\nIt's a small restaurant, but there's an okay number of tables. Dinner this past Friday was at 7:30. No reservations. No wait. I was shocked to find anywhere in the North End like that, never mind our place of choice.\\n\\nIt's cash and Amex only. We thought that Amex was an odd card to select if you were only going to accept one. But a reasonable number of people have them and from what I understand, they're the most reliable credit card company. (which is probably why their charge to businesses is the highest) Fewer credit card companies to pay off means lower meal cost to me. That's fine with me.\\n\\nThe only draw back I saw was the hostess. She's a small, gruff Italian woman, who is apparently there every night. She won't seat you if your entire party isn't there. And she won't have you wait in the vestibule, even if there's a blizzard outside. The same woman took our orders. An after-thought antipasto was never ordered due to the business-like round the table style in which she took our orders before briskly walking away. In the end, we didn't end up missing the salad, our entrees satisfied us so completely.\\n\\nBut that was it. That was the only hitch to the entire meal. I figure she's like the mean gate keeper or dragon you have to get past before being granted access to Princess Pasta. And really, if that's the biggest hurdle I have to jump to have dinner here, I'm okay with that."},{"name":"The Family Dog","address":"1402 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Finally checked out The Family Dog this weekend.

The kobe cap steak and filet mignon are unbeatable. I love Ruth Chris and fogo de Chao, but this is a whole new level. I would warn anyone reading this that the chef will generally undercook the steak by about 1 level (ie if you like medium order medium well). I once brought a vegetarian friend who ordered the catch of the day along with a crab cake and enjoyed it as much as i did my steak. The waiter was extremely kind and explained all the items and recommendations. I have had the truffle tatter tots and they are great. I also loved the creamy mashed potatoes. Although it sounds childish I think the mac n cheese is the best side. The cheeses are prominent in every individual shell of macaroni. When it comes to dessert I know you will be full but be strong and share the creme brulee because it is better than the Parisian ones I have had. And by Parisian I mean from Paris not a Paris bakery. They serve it with cookies which have an almond base and compliment it so well.

Growing up in New England and as the child of Portuguese parents, I've had a ton of exposure to Portuguese restaurants, both in the US and in Portugal.  Six summers of my youth were spent in Portugal, and this restaurant reminds me more of the restaurants overseas than of the Portuguese restaurants of Fall River, New Bedford, Bristol and East Providence.\\n\\nEvery time I've been in, and it's more than I can count on my fingers (no, I'm not missing any), I've been greeted and served by one of the owners.  Service is quiet and unobtrusive.  There is no rush, which has driven some of my friends crazy.  Me, I'm used to it and in all honesty, I don't mind as it allows me more time to harken back to my childhood.  \\n\\nThe pasteis de bacalhai (codfish cakes) are so authentic that it's scary.  The chourico assado is perfect, crispy with all of the right flavor notes.  For starters, all I'm missing is the caldo verde.\\n\\nEntree time!  The Portuguese are known for multiple starches with every meal.  Usually it's bread, rice and some sort of fried potato.  Portugal did not disappoint there.  The lombinhis (pork cutlet) were tender and juicy.  The bacalhau assado is a massive portion, and the flavor just blew me away.  The olive oil, garlic and salt marry so well with the codfish.  For me though, the one dish that I can't get enough of is the bife a Portuguesa (Portuguese style sirloin)!  It's everything I remember a great Portuguese steak to be.  Always cooked to temp, the garlic and white wine sauce is an amazing compliment to the steak.  Make sure you break the yolk of the egg and spread it over the steak.  \\n\\nI love you Portugal, and I can't wait to see you again."},{"name":"Jam Cafe on Beatty","address":"556 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"One of the best spots in town to come for brunch!

Much like apartment complexes, the fancier the name the scarier the location becomes. For example, \\"Regal Heights at Goldleaf Creek\\" would translate to, \\"90% of all residents are cooking meth and you are likely to get shot stepping outside your apartment to get your mail.\\"\\n\\nIt's for this reason I'd managed to avoid going here, despite my love of catfish, those tasty-tasty bottom dwelling garbage-eating fishies.\\n\\nA while back I mentioned a place in my home town called, \\"The Catfish Inn\\", all but destroyed during Hurricane Elisha in 1984. What I loved most about that place as a child was the sign - a catfish with a swishing neon tail. Imagine my surprise when I see a very similar catfish sign here. I was intrigued. When a coworker invited myself and a few others here for lunch one day after uttering, \\"Hush puppy sticks\\", I couldn't resist.\\n\\nInside is as you might expect it to be, decorated as though it's an old swamp fishing shack. Tin signs cover the walls as well as a collection of other oddities and trophies. Fortunately my delicate sensibilities were spared a sign bearing the words, \\"If you see my wife, tell 'er to get back in the kitchen!\\" that you might see in Southeast Texas or the like. It was a very family friendly atmosphere, with a friendly staff.\\n\\nAfter figuring out the ordering system I chose a large portion of catfish - half spicy, have plain, and some of their signature jalapeno tartar sauce and some of the much lauded hush puppy sticks and then proceeded to obliterate the food in front of me. The spicy catfish was perfect and exactly what I was hoping for - as were the hush puppy sticks. The plain, or original, catfish wasn't what I was hoping for, even with the addition of the tartar sauce. It was bland and could have used a dash more of salt and pepper. But that only told me to just go with the spicy catfish (which isn't really spicy hot) when I came back.\\n\\nI've been back a few times now and have never left disappointed.

Salmon is my go-to entree, a large 10 oz. fillet cooked to perfection. The shrimp cocktail app- 4 huge pieces- is tasty as well (pricey at $17, but what isn't pricey here?). Favorite sides include the hash browns and the brocolli gratin, decadent and delicious. I've heard raves about the tenderloin and the veal, so check those out if that's your thing. The sticky toffee pudding with torched bananas and creme fraiche ice cream is to die for, I highly recommend ending your meal with it.\\n\\nService is always exceptional, cocktails are well made, and the wine list is so ridiculously overwhelming (60+ pages) that you're better off asking for reccs. The bottom floor tends to get a bit loud, I prefer the upper floor. The atmosphere is old-world steakhouse, but you get a mixed crowd here (from families with babies to business meetings to dates, and everything in between).\\n\\nI don't know that I would ever come here on my own dime- I prefer to spend my own hard-earned $ at places like Oleana and Ten Tables-, but I'm perfectly happy coming here when someone else picks up the check- it's definitely a solid choice for a steakhouse."},{"name":"Mooo Restaurant","address":"15 Beacon St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My wife and I have wanted to try this place for a long time.

The service was attentive and good as well, but the style was short of exceptional, which is what I would expect.

But, only in the afternoon/early evening. At night this place like a lot of bars in this area can be more trouble than it's worth.\\n\\nFirst, if it's a game night get there after the game starts or before it ends. It's usually pretty crowded with the pre game crowd. Then fills up with the post game crowd as well. It's still easy to get a drink and generally a relaxed place to be. Following the end of the game, getting drinks become a mission due to having to slither between groups of people that wont leave the bar once they get their drinks and the few bartenders there having to serve the entire bar. Which being a large two floor establishment can be a huge number of people.\\n\\nAnother thing that can suck...... well does suck, is the line on a Friday or Saturday night. Once 11 P.M. hits, brace yourself. The line mores slow, and feels like it moves even slower in the winter time. I've seen it backed up to the corner by \\"Penalty Box\\" and stay that way for over an hour. Then if you get inside after that I usually find it better to stay upstairs than downstairs. Upstairs is usually a little better temperature wise, and the bar is easier to get service at. Downstairs you will enjoy more of a nightclub feel. It's more geared towards dancing down there. But, it gets packed. Shoulder to Shoulder packed with people bumping into each other constantly.

Half way through my vegetarian omelette I found a piece of ham. Not cool especially being a former vegetarian, but I didn't want to complain again. No discount was taken from the bill.

I'm not sure if you can add things like tripe, tendon, or other kinds of meat but it comes with eye of round steak. The broth is not oily at all and has a peppery taste. The noodles are perfect and it's served with ample basil, bean sprouts, jalape√±os, limes and sometimes red peppers on the side that are super fresh. It's unlike any other pho I have eaten in the Portland area and I eat a lot of pho. Unfortunately, two times out of the 100 I have been here, I have ordered the pho and someone other than the owner was cooking and it tasted completely different and was lacking. The broth was different and the noodles were thick and hard. It's disappointing but if you come here, order pho and aren't happy then definitely come back and give it another chance. If your pho comes to the table and you smell pepper then you know you are in for a treat. As far as ordering drinks go, there is a bar next door. The wait staff don't speak fluent English so if I want something from the bar, I will write it down for them on an ordering pad and they will go next door to get it for me and bring it back to the table.

I believe whatever my bf had was also undercooked and mine tasted oily.\\nNeedless to say we didn't think we would be back.\\n\\nBut back we came as the bf was craving french and the location on Columbus was only two blocks from our apartment. And I am so incredibly glad that we did because all the dozen + times we have been there since have been incredible.\\n\\nI have so many favorite dishes - in the colder months, the seared fois-gras totally hits the spot.

For a sardine baguette, fries and a side salad, it only sets you back around $7. \\n\\nThe decor and ambiance is also one of the reasons we made Petit Robert one of our go-to Boston restaurants.

If you calculate the $2300 over a three hour period, it equates to over $750 per hour. If you were smart, you would have expected the same throughout the evening.

Well, the classic burger is $2.50, with the purchase of a drink, any additional topping costs 75 cents. But still, with a price tag including tip of $10, I can live with it, although it was difficult even paying that much. I wish I could just start paying what I think a burger is worth when I go out, but in all probability most places would be out of business if that was the model. The burgers at BBG are bad, with a taste eerily reminiscent of Harvey's (not the first time I referenced the great Canadian chain), if I wanted the flavor of a hot dog I would order a hot dog, why can't the burger taste like a burger? There's just a real lack of enthusiasm here, vague descriptions, or lack thereof of the burgers, and my guess is since it's cheaper on Tuesdays, they feel they can cheap out on the quantity and quality. Or maybe the problem is the timing of it all, 2:45 on a Tuesday is pretty much the skank shift, but the food should always taste great, if anything, less customers means more attention to the food, one would think.\\n\\nLike most, I always try a french fry first, and usually it's a pretty good indicator of how the rest of the meal will be. The fries at BBG are bland, bitter for some reason and not double-fried, yielding a very below average attempt. The burger is well, just a burger, the bun is fine, the toppings (bacon, lettuce and tomato) add nothing, and the meat, as mentioned, tastes like a hot dog. It's also stringy, way beyond medium-rare, and unbelievable salty, this coming from the man who loves salt.  It also curiously is topped with a gigantic spear of a pickle, right on top of the burger, believe me, I've never seen a pickle that big before. (insert inappropriate joke here) The cheese, allegedly cheddar, is plastic-y, and flavorless, adding another layer of disappointment to an already weak burger. The initial $2.50 price tag might pull you in, but please take my warning seriously, this is one of the worst burger/fry combinations in Boston right now, with nothing redeeming about it."},{"name":"Mooo Restaurant","address":"15 Beacon St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Went to lunch here with a friend.

We had reservations for 7:30 and were seen to our table at about 8:15. --okay, busy time, i can forgive that.  I suppose the one and only positive thing I could report is that the cocktail/wine were okay, acceptable.\\n\\n We ordered a caesar salad that was made up mostly of the tough white ribs, few leafy bites, a bland, nothing special dressing to match the presentation.  I know, what can you expect for presentation for a caesar salad, but truly, Pizzacato makes more of an effort.  For dinner we shared the painted hills steak, paired with the roasted foraged mushrooms.  The steak is served in a cast iron dish that makes the it difficult to cut, like you are reaching down into a trough with your knife and fork, and for a steak that was  a challenge to cut to start with, it was quite inconvenient, but mainly, why?  if you have a steak cooked to your specifications, does not putting it into a hot iron pan continue the cooking process?  The meat was tough and as noted difficult to cut with the gristly/tendony/or whatever stringy material that was in the middle.  Other than the stringy bits, this was a decent steak, but certainly not approaching the $45 cost, and the only thing memorable about it was how astounded we were that they get away with charging us $45 for this mess.  The mushrooms appear to have been plopped into yet another cast iron vessel and placed in the oven, topped with crunchy onions and placed on our table.  The crunchy onion topping was okay, but the mushrooms themselves were completely dry, no hint of sauce, herbs, or spices, and mostly flavorless, just 1 step above rehydrated freeze dried mushrooms.  I suppose we were lucky that this side was only $11.  \\n\\nAside from the meal, the service was slow, spotty and a little surly.  My water glass sat empty for half an hour and the water refill guy didn't seem at all pleased that I was needing his attention.

The food, while good, was nothing memorable. I'll be honest I can't even remember what I ordered. Though I do remember ultra fresh ingredients like rosemary which gets me every time. I think the highlight of my trip there aside from the charming, whimsical, airy decor was the coffee, and I'm not usually a coffee drinker. The desserts also looked appetizing though I wasn't able to partake this go-round. \\n\\nThey do have a lot to park in located directly in the rear of the building, and ample street parking is also available, so unless you go on a crazy Sunday like me, this shouldn't be an issue. \\n\\nIn all, I say try it. I know I plan to give it another shot, though I can assure you it won't be on a Sunday.

My appetizer was five stars. Main course I would put it 4 stars so close to 5 stars. I had this summer squash or rather the winter squash for an appetizer and the pappardelle pasta weight scale for my main course. Both were extremely well prepared and unique in taste. The cheese on the winter squash or rather under it was sweet I believe it was goat cheese and it almost seemed like a desert. The pappardelle pasta had a very unique peppery taste that when paired with a wine with peppery tones was quite good. My server was very friendly however when I asked about the ingredients she seemed a bit rushed.

The steak was cooked PERFECTLY.  I cannot say this was the best steak I've ever had in my lifetime, but it was really close.  But what I can say is that it was cooked to absolute perfection.  Perfectly pink the entire way through, it was just really executed SPOT-ON.  And the mashed potatoes were totally rich and over-the-top, but in a good way.  They went really well with the steak.\\n\\nDessert, I had the creme-brulee.  That was also very good, but I have had better.

And I'm sooooo glad I did.\\n\\nSimply put, I was floored.  I've had some awesome steaks from highly regarded steakhouses, but there was absolutely no comparison to this real deal kobe beef.  The only thing that accompanied this steak on the dish was a decorative piece of thyme tied to one of those tongue depressor things you see in the doctor's office.  Oh, wait -- the waiter did bring in a small bowl with a tiny spoon...  He said they were sea salt flakes imported from somewhere or another.  Hmmmm...  Interesting.  The waiter recommended sprinking a tiny bit on each slice.\\n\\nI was hesitant about using the sea salt because I didn't want to take away from the taste and experience of the kobe beef.  Afterall, there wasn't a whole lot of it.  So the first couple slices, I tried without...  And it was amazing!  \\"Melts in your mouth\\" is not a figure of speech when eating this cut of beef.  By chew 6, there's no trace left.\\n\\nNext piece, I tried with the salt.  I figure now, I would know if it would take too much away from the experience or not.\\nO\\nM\\nF\\nG\\n!\\n\\nReally?  Why do they even have the salt on the side as an option?!?!  They should stand next to you and yell at you before you eat each slice, that you MUST use the sea salt flakes!!!  Damn...  Remember your first sloppy, slobbery french kiss?  Well, that's what this is, times 10.  The salt flakes add just a bit of crunchy texture and also gets your saliva glands to work overtime.  So then the slice just melts away in your mouth like butter.  Truly amazing!  Oh, I just got a semi. ;-)\\n\\nWait, I did have other stuff there too...  Let's see...\\n\\nDinner rolls.  Those were just plain awesome too!  The come in a mini loaf pan.  The tops glazed with butter and sprinkled with sea salt.  Warm and very soft.  Kinda like the bosom of your loved one. ;-)  Imagine a kings hawaiian roll, but warm and way softer.  If you're on a budget, maybe just go there and eat the rolls and a salad.  It really is that good!\\n\\nAppetizer.  Heirloom Tomato, Creamy Blue Cheese, Bacon.  Bacon -- what else you do you want?  'nuff said.\\n\\nSide dish.  Truffled Parmesan Fries.  Extremely crispy.  I'd say they fried them twice.  Great salty flavor and texture!\\n\\nDrink.  Maker's Mark on the rocks.  Ok, maybe this heightened my dining experience a little.  Then again, you gotta enjoy a nice drink when going out to a place like this. ;-)\\n\\nIs the kobe beef worth $130 for 6 ounces?  That's up to you to decide...  For me, I say yes, and justify it this way...  $130 is cheaper than getting a plane ticket to Japan. ;-)\\n\\nThis was the most expensive meal I had...  Would I do it again?

With that being said eating here you are strictly paying for that feel of nice ambiance. For the prices you would assume the steak wouldn't be served by itself. I always think it makes a restaurant look bad to drop a plate off at ones table with only a steak sitting in the middle by its self. \\n\\nMeat temps.

They offer a variety of breakfast items, sandwiches, salads, and more heartier items for dinner.  \\n\\nThe challah french toast with bananas and ricotta cheese was grand - hands down the best french toast I've had so far.  The bread was soft and fluffy, which blended quite well with the cheese and fruit.  The curried chicken sandwich was nicely seasoned, albeit that the chicken seemed slightly dry.  The side of yams roasted with spices and the Asian-sesame green beans were refreshing and provided some zing in contrast to the main dish.  My friends had the breakfast sandwich and eggs benedict, which they seem to enjoy.  Most dishes were around 8-12$ for brunch, and I was pleased for the quality and the price.\\n\\nCoffee was good, but wasn't anything memorable.  I also had the green tea latte, which was very interesting.  It isn't the matcha (powdered green tea leaves) green tea that many may be familiar with at Starbucks, but normal green tea mixed with milk.  I'm not sure I would order it again, but it was an interesting take on the latte.  I hear that they have many other types of latte that were not listed on the menu, so it might be worth asking them for some of their unique blends.\\n\\nThe service was fine, as our server came around frequently even though it was packed.  The tables were close together and the acoustics were terrible. It gets quite loud, and it was difficult to hear someone two seats down the table.  It's not a place to have a peaceful cup of coffee...\\n\\nThe exterior preserved the hardware shop from which it was renovated to retain a certain patina of the place and houses a small patio out front.

Yet, it works well to blend in to the neighborhood, and it felt kind of nice to discover the hidden cafe.\\n\\nParking is not difficult, but you may need to park a bit down the street.\\n\\nOverall, I was very pleased with my experience at Sun in my belly.  I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a good breakfast/brunch.  It was very crowded on Saturday for brunch, and it may be wise to call ahead for a reservation (as i did).

Party of 7.  Pre-wedding dinner.  Oddly enough, the place was dead.  there were a few other people there during happy hour, but other than that, it was pretty quiet.  Also, it did have a fishy smell.  What is up with that?  Am I the only one who notices fish smell at some sushi restaurants?  Maybe I have a super sensitive nose like Remy from Ratatouille.  \\n\\nWe had reservations a 6pm, but since a flight was delayed, the rest of the party didn't show up until 8 pm.  My sister and I first started off with appetizers which were pretty good and decently priced.  We got one of each, literally as we waited for the rest of the party to arrive.  The tastiest roll was the Shio, and I thought the chicken salad was especially good.  \\n\\nOnce the rest of the party showed up, we ordered more entrees including the seabass, the  lobster tempura, shrimp and scallop entrees, grilled salmon, and the maguro salad.  I didn't taste the salmon or the shrimp and salad.  I thought the maguro salad was pretty sad.  There was less maguro than a piece of sashimi and it was a weird bright pink color.  It also didnt' taste especially good.  It seemed like a creative attempt that didn't turn out so well.  I probably should have sent it back.  The seabass itself was pretty tasty, but the sauces on the side seemed to be thrown together and not compliment each other.  The tempura lobster was okay, skimpy though.  \\n\\nWe also ordered a bottle of port to share.  Since the bar didn't have a full bottle, they sold us the $38 bottle for $30.  That was appreciated.  The port was pretty yummy.  \\n\\nOverall, I thought the entrees were a downer compared to the appetizers.  They were very expensive with small portions for the price.  While they were well-presented, they did not wow me.  I give Kenobi props for the porter, the appetizers, and the bathroom sinks.  However, the entrees were such a let-down that I can only give it 3 stars.  Also, the slight fishy smell is a little concerning.

I had heard so many good things, especially about That Cake. So it's literally on the corner of 11th Ave. and Cleveland Ave. The parking is on the side of the building beside the Police Station. I ordered the special today, 5 Wings, 2 pieces of Fish, and 2 sides for $16 and obviously a piece of That Cake. I decided on Boston Blue for the Fish and Collard Greens. There was a band playing there this afternoon and they were amazing. It took a while to get my food because everything is cooked to order. Let me say once I got home that wait was well worth it. Not only did the coating of the Fish have flavor but so did the actual Fish itself. The Chicken Wings had a crispy coating and a bbq sauce which was something I never tasted before and it was so good. There's nothing more I can say about That Cake that hasn't already been said. I did get to see the owner while I was there and he seems very personable. The place was clean and the staff were very nice. They talked to me while I was waiting. I will definitely return.

I assumed the fruit was on the side.  Sadly, it wasn't and to make matters worse the fruit in this instance was bananas, which I'm allergic to.  Had the server told me that the fruit was bananas I would've asked them to hold 'em, or had they been plated on the side I would have simply avoided them, but there was no getting around this.

as my father used to say \\"beef wellington. it's so elegant. that's what they have on them cruise ships.\\" i was tempted into tasting an alleged knockout punch version of beef wellington by a co-diner who had been wowed on a previous occasion. and a KO it was. this version of the old school elegant entree was proof that a chef could out do himself on a dish which nobody in their right mind would have the patience to prepare in their home on a tuesday night. succulent beef tenderloin was topped with spinach and foie gras, i assume before being rolled in a duxelle and wrapped in an individual pastry sheet. the presentation was beautiful, as the halved meat pastry arrived on a decadent red wine reduction. and yes, my friends, even within the pastry itself, and combined with the fatty, sinful flavor of the foie gras, the tenderloin had been cooked to a perfect medium-rare. if i had a gaggle of benjamins, i would order this often, each time shouting to the heavens \\"this one's for you dad!\\"\\n\\nsides? yes, there were sides. we ordered the side flight:  whipped yukon gold potato, creamed spinach, truffled parmesan fries, autumn squash. the star of the foursome was unanimously the autumn squash, tasting of brown sugar, and maybe even a hint of cinnamon. sweet, but still savory, just like i like my sides. the weakest was probably the creamed spinach. but this was inevitably a grade on a curve. if you are inclined to order other sides, as we were, then please give a nod to the macaroni and cheese, which had a wonderful bechamel sauce, and also the asparagus with hollandaise sauce. \\n\\nfor desert: the four of us, filled to the brim with wine and cow, could not leave without splitting two of the deserts. after inquiring as to whether or not the bananas foster is lit on fire at the table, and then expressing disappointment that mooo did not barbecue its bananas at the table, our charming server, hugo, offered to light a fire at the table. ::chortle chortle chortle:: we opted out, and chose the blueberry cheesecake with white chocolate shavings, and the lemon meringue, served in an individual tart. my personal feeling is that cheesecake is cheesecake, and this was cheesecake... though a bit less dense than the version i make, which frankly has the consistency of a weisswurst (pun entirely intended). the lemon meringue, however, was delicious. presentation in the individual tart was clever, and the white puffs of meringue were heaped high, browned, yet light on that circle of tart, sweet citrusy curd. very rarely do i sympathize with a pastry chef at a restaurant where you are inevitably going to be too full to really indulge in the ultimate course. but hopefully a majority of those diners at moo can go that extra mile and enjoy. \\n\\noverall, this restaurant does something that i rarely experience. they have a menu full of the items that you would see offered at a mediocre wedding hall, or allow me, on a carnival cruise ship. but mooo takes each item, adds ingredients that are sure to taste fresh, and enhances the presentations of each plate so that these courses can again become impressive. nothing here is too gastro-adventurous, so long as you have the money to throw down. perfect for a special dinner, or a thank you to a crowd that would feel reluctant to splurge on themselves."},{"name":"Park's Edge","address":"913 Bernina Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Nestled off the beaten path at the corner of Elizabeth and Berinia  sits a poignant restaurant that serves up healthy food, scrumptious jazz, and delectable beverages.

For the food, only one word comes to mind: mouthwatering. Yes peeps, it's THAT great. The salad bar was no ordinary \\"Izzy's\\" salad bar. It's decorated with cured meats, cheese, freshly sliced and seasoned veggies along with your familiar caesar salad. There are tasty sides of rice, beans, and cheesy potatoes (drool) to choose from in addition to the already complimentary sides of caramelized banana, mashed potatoes, and polenta. FYI their popover rolls are so soft, buttery, and dense that I could eat them all day. \\n\\nMeat was divine. I say meat, not just steak because they also served glorious amounts of chicken, pork, and lamb cuts in 16 different ways! We were told the Gaucho men serving the meat tableside, were the actual chefs of all the meat in the kitchen. Which means you can request any gaucho chef what cut you want, how rare you want it and they'll gladly go back there and make it for you (I was so happy). I asked to have a cut of rare filet minion and our gaucho chef happily brought out a freshly cooked steak to cut off for me! Side note: Don't leave there without trying a piece of their pork ribs. It's well seasoned and too lip smackin delicious. \\n\\nThe service from our waiters was top of the line. So great that not once, did I need to wave for our waiter's attention for assistance.

The food was great, but the service was terrible.  We had a nice waiter, Orlando (Chicago), that wasn't able to provide any level of service you would expect from this caliber of restaurant.  I only had three glasses of water over the course of 2 hours and ran out of water all three times. The last time I just drank some of my wife's water.  At the end of dinner we waited 20 minutes to just get a dessert menu which I asked for from the guy clearing our table.  After waiting 10 minutes to order the dessert I approached the manager who I told that we hadn't seen our waiter in over 20 minutes. Rather than resolve the issue and ask us what she could do for us (i.e., take our dessert order), she seemed to be more concerned in finding our waiter (or she was handling another issue).  The service was so poor that I had to get up three times during the course of our meal to try and get service (which our needs still weren't fulfilled at that point). The service was what you would expect at a fast food restaurant for serving yourself.  We ended up getting compensated for the dessert and the waiter apologized to my wife when I went to use the restroom.  I told my wife not to leave over a 10% tip, but she had a waitressing job in the past and would not give anything less than 15%.  This is a nice restaurant with great food, but the service was subpar by far.  This may have been a one off, but the main issue I have is the attentiveness of the entire staff (to include the female manager) when I asked for service because of an absent waiter.

All of my experiences there have been great, except for this one. We came in on a Thursday around 2pm, there was nobody in the restaurant for the entirety of our stay, other than two guests doing take-out. \\nLike I said, the food is amazing, we ordered a Filipino-type fried rice with pork, shrimp paste, onion, tomato and mangoes, as well as crispy pork with lechon and my favourite Kare Kare. It was my first turn trying the fried rice this time, and it's probably the best fried rice I've ever had ever (probably because I love shrimp paste so much), it wasn't oily at all, the had a nice balance of flavour that actually went well with the Kare Kare rather than regular steamed rice. Everything in the dish was very balanced. The lechon was spot on, the insides were soft and the outsides were crispy. The Kare Kare on the other hand, wasn't as good as it used to be.. This was probably my fourth time at this restaurant and every time I come back, the quality just lessens, it's quite disappointing because I love this dish, but it's because the beef isn't as tender and juicy anymore, it used to just fell apart when you touched it, but now it seems almost dry, like they cook it first than throw in the sauce, that's what PinPin does and it's even more disappointing. \\nThe reason why my experience this time wasn't as good as the others was because I actually found a long hair in the Kare Kare, they refired immediately, but then halfway through our dinner my boyfriend found another hair (short and wavy this time) in the fried rice :/ We had already eaten more than half of it, and didn't want to mention it to them again, so we left it at that. What's even worse is that when we went to pay, she still charged us for the food that we found a hair in, I mean I don't really care, I'm not trying to be cheap and get free food, but in all honesty, it's technically a complaint, and at my work, it definately would've been free. Just saying, service standards.\\nAtmosphere: I called this place hipstery, probably because of the chalkboard on the wall and the mix matched tables and chairs, but my boyfriend called it home-y. There's no music played so it's quite quiet in there when there's no other customers, but all the other times I came were for dinner around 7-9pm and there were always other tables so there was light chatter. \\nService: They give you a small dish of Filipino nuts/chip things after you order, it's a nice touch because you don't see that very often anymore and they're delicious! \\n\\nFood: 5/5\\nAtmosphere: 4/5\\nService: 3/5\\n\\nI recommend this place to my friends all the time, I still love it regardless, but it'd be great if they could fix their Kare Kare recipe!

I'm not sure if I just muddled the flavor too much or not but I was hoping the counter person would've steered me in the right direction but sadly, I just had paid nearly $20 for a bogo free burrito and a soda or something stupid like that.  Needless to say, I'm in no rush to go back.

Stopped by on our way out of florida. The greeting was friendly. We decided to sit on the sit down portion of the restaurant. Our server was ok, not very friendly. I ordered some maracuya juice-SO GOOD and fresh. As well as an empanada. The empanada was ok, kind of dry. My boyfriend ordered a cuban sandwich and I ordered ropa vieja, black beans and rice with tostones. The ropa vieja was excellent. I am panamanian so I'm used to a different style but this was still pretty good. The black beans and rice were disappointingly dry and bland. So were the tostones (or patacones). My boyfriend said the same thing about his cuban sandwich. Dry. the food was dry and mostly bland. The waiter was also rude. I asked for a refill and he made me feel uncomfortable acting like it was a strange request....he was also very inattentive, kept watching the soccer game on the tv... since we were tired of dealing with him we decided to take our dessert orders to go. Again rude service,  one of the ladies acted like she was bothered by us..not sure why. We ordered cuatro leches as well as a mil hojas con caramello. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.

Veggies include everything you'd expect, including corn (on the sweet side), cabbage, and pretty good mac & cheese.  There are daily specials too, like jambalaya.  My favorite things are the country fried steaks and the ridiculously cheap breakfast biscuits.  Service is indeed friendly and the dining area is clean and roomy.  This location is somehow affiliated with Donnie's on Clairmont, as well as a few other places, and once I figured that out, I realized that the food, prices and friendly service are nearly identical.

In the meantime...\\n\\nI visited Maxwell's 148 because I was interested in scoping it out for a potential future event. I had heard some good things about it and read some reviews on other sites that left me with some hopeful expectations. There is a dirth of inspiring fine dining restaurants in metrowest and I was hopeful that this would add to the few I consider worthy of praise. But you know what they say, \\"Expectations are the baggage of Life, travel lightly\\"\\n\\n If you haven't picked up on the foreshadowing by now, let me be clear as glass: I was disappointed. \\n\\nMaxwell's has all the trimmings of a fine dining restaurant (except for the funky location on Rt 135) though perhaps a bit overdone for the 'burbs, but what really let me down was the food. The cuisine is characterized as italian-asian fusion which from the beginning doesn't really work in my mind, either as a blending of the two cuisines  or, as is the case here, a menu that features dishes evocative of both cuisines. I understand French-Asian fusion because the preparation and presentation of French cuisine compliments asian ingredients and sensibility, but the Italian cuisine is at heart a earthy cuisine emphasizing excellent Italian ingredients cooked and presented simply. \\n\\nWe ordered selections from each part of the menu - appetizer, main, dessert - representative of both cuisines and were disappointed at every turn. Although I can't recall which items we ordered the general concensus was a lack of finesse with ingredients and poor interpretation of classic dishes. This included overhanded seasoning, imbalance with flavors and ingredients and an overall discomfort with the execution. \\n\\nWhile the staff was friendly and attentive enough, the food let us down. One more note: The restaurant purports to have a excellent wine selection but I found it to be limited and imbalanced. The prices were moderate to high compared to other restaurants and we were led completely astray by the recommendations from our server. Guys, Italian wine and Asian food just aren't a natural pairing. \\n\\nTo be fair, I've only been once and every restaurant can have an off night, so I will try it again and will report back."},{"name":"French Quarter Brasserie and Oyster Bar","address":"1207 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"3","text":"Ordered a bottle of wine, oysters, appetizers and entrees- honestly just looking for a place to relax outside and enjoy some great food- we picked the right place.

Over an 1.0 hr wait for food. The worst eggs Benedict I have ever had.) \\n\\nMy parents were in from out of town for the day to celebrate my sisters birthday with a brunch and we wanted to take my sister here for her birthday as it was one place she and her husband really like. I had never been there and was very excited to try it out, as the menu looks amazing! \\n\\nAt the beginning, we put our name on the list to wait for outside seating. There were only a few two-tops in front of us, and there were open tables inside and a few outside.  We watched as the parties of two were seated both inside and outside. I watched as they allowed two tables to finish up outside, thinking they were going to connect the two tables together for our party of 5. By this time, it was close to forty minutes of waiting. We and a party of two were the only ones waiting. \\n\\nThey did not link the tables together. Instead they seated the party of two at one of the open outdoor move-able tables. Outside there was another two top coming open (an umbrella table, which is not able to be moved, like the two free standing tables which were open). Having worked for years in the restaurant industry, this was poor planning for customer service. They could have waited for the unmovable umbrella two top to pay, clear it and seat the party of two, and seat our party of 5 at the two open tables that were movable. Both parties could have been seated at the same time. \\n\\nWhen I saw that they seated the party of two at the center movable table, and there were no other options for a party of 5 outside, I went in to inquire how and when they were planning to seat us. 40 minutes had passed. They assured us it would be as \\"soon as an open table came up\\". I told them that no tables that could accommodate 5 people were open outside and asked when and what was their plan to seat a 5th person outside? They said they would add another table to one available. At this time, another two top arrived and am promptly seated outside. \\n\\nSo, we decided that we did not want to wait another 40 minutes for an outside table and seeing many tables open inside, asked if we could be seated there. They agreed. ( Mind you, never did they offer this to us, or keep us updated about our table to-be). \\n\\nWe finally were seated inside and ordered. I was very excited to order from the amazing menu because everything sounded so good. And after almost an hour, we were very hungry! After many coffee refills, lemonade refills, we began to inquire about our food. Now, it had been AN HOUR since we were Seated and had ordered our food!!!. No food. My sister and brother in-laws food finally came after an hour past ordering. Our 3 salmon Benedict did not. \\n\\nThere were numerous reasons as to why the food was not ready:  \\"We are not sure...\\". \\"we have to check again...I just don't know...\\". The \\"poacher was down\\" (what does that even mean!? Aren't eggs just poached in hot water...!!!). \\"We have new cooks today\\".... Who has a new cook start on a Sunday during Brunch!\\n\\nAnyway, when our three dishes finally did arrive (and the others in our party were already finished eating), I was anticipating some amazing dish! I was SO DISAPPOINTED!!! The plate had two dry English muffins. Two poached eggs plopped on top of about a teaspoon of what seemed like canned salmon. And she forgot our side of potatoes. I had to go up to the counter and ask two waitresses for them, and this was after we had already started on our dishes.\\n\\nIn their defense, the waitress was nice (but frenzied) and apologetic and during our more then an hour wait for food, did offer to bring us some dolmas to snack on...which was a nice jester...BUT THEY NEVER CAME! We were starving. At this point, we were so fed up we didn't even want to ask for them. A person, who I assumed was in charge, did comp our three dishes, but honestly, I would have wanted to refuse to pay for them anyway, as they were the worst eggs Benedict I have ever had.

I took up my friend's recommendation of the Ahi Tuna (\\"grilled medium rare tuna fillet with a sweet balsamic reduction\\").\\n\\nUpon receiving my meal, we were first served our salads with a balsamic vinaigrette dressing.

My mashed potatoes had been in a bowl, pre-heated and then dumped onto my plate. It was evident because the shape of the bowl remained intact - quite unappetizing. The seasonal vegetables were nothing special: cauliflower, broccoli, carrots and pepper drizzled in olive oil and baked. My tuna steak, although perfectly cooked and tender, was served on more salad.\\n\\nOverall I wasn't impressed by Little Billy's. I still don't understand what clientele they are trying to attract.

There's no separation between bar and dining area so with a good sized bar crowd, and TVs overhead, it's loud.\\n\\nFood: Varied menu with decent prices.  We had the mussels as our appetizer and they were wonderful.  Husband opted for jerk chicken and after much questioning of the waitress, I opted for scallops, grilled. His was ok...well-seasoned and cooked perfectly.  Corn on the cob side was over cooked and unremarkable.  My scallops arrived with a cold side of Brussels sprouts, and a scoop of rice perfectly shaped like an ice-cream scoop (clearly not made to order). Scallops were very hot and had nice grill marks but had a metallic taste.  I sent the meal back; $29 was WAY too expensive for what looked like a cafeteria meal.  In it's place I got the lobster mac and cheese.  It was not great.  I ate it because I was hungry (and husband had finished eating).To be fair, I grew up in Maine so have had my share of lobster mac and cheese and this just didn't make the cut.  The lobster was just plunked on top of a pot of mac and cheese, then topped with more cheese and put under a broiler.  This dried the lobster.  The cheese used was also too sharp to be mixed with lobster (and was orange and clumpy).  By contrast, the best lobster mac and cheeses I've had have a velvety white cheese sauce that has lobster all through it - then with pasta tossed in.\\n\\nService: Lackluster.

After an hour, we saw our pizzas come up but our waiter never looked for them. I finally had to call him over and point out that our food was there. They came to our table cold because they had been sitting for so long. Kids meals still weren't out. At that point we just found the manager and asked to pay our bill and leave with whatever food was ready \\"to go.\\" We had two screaming kids that were starving because it was over an hour and no food. At least we got rolls- that's basically what they ate for dinner. I will say the staff was friendly and courteous but something is seriously wrong here.

Today I bought a vegan lemon tart (no refined sugar and grain free). The small tart was $6! and was extremely unsatisfying. The crust was weirdly salty and the filling a strange texture. Both myself and my vegan friend found it not edible. The nanaimo bar was also disappointing as it had barely any of the yummy cream filling which I personally think is the best part. I get a bit frustrated when places try to make dessert healthy, if I'm ordering a tart or a nanaimo bar I don't care if it has refined sugar, its kinda what I am signing up for.

I feel that pimento cheese is getting to be way overdone on just about every menu in town, however the pork and pimento sliders here were excellent and a reminder that an overused ingredient can shine in the right hands.  The sliders came with fries that had been cooked in duck fat which apparently is one of the seven food they will serve in heaven.  I can't wait to come back and try tater tots or fish and chips fried up in duck fat!  The fried rice was amazing with perfectly seasoned rice elevated by perfectly cooked pork belly.

The delivery came on time, the driver was perfectly nice, and for about $30 total for two people eating Indian food for dinner it was pretty good. \\n\\nWe got their dinner for two meal which included rice, two soups, naan, pakora, tandori chicken and shrimp, two pieces of lamb kabob (I thought there would have been more of that for it being a featured part of the menu), and our choice of a curry so we got fish korma. The tandori stuff was all actually pretty good and the grilled onions and such were great. The lamb kabob pieces seemed a bit dry/overcooked to us though which made us sad. The chicken soup we got was fine, but a little oily for our true liking, and the fish korma was really rich! We definitely could not finish all of this stuff in one sitting which was great, since we were able to use leftovers the next day for lunch, so that made our meal even cheaper! Yay! \\n\\nOverall, Haveli was fine, but I think for that area of Cambridge/Somerville there are other places I might go back to first for delivery, but would also stop by here if in Inman craving Indian in more of a sit down environment than Punjabi Dhaba which is there too.

It's nothing too fancy, just some great Swiss comfort food. I enjoyed the simple, smaller, per-portioned, and multiple course meals of European cooking.

Additionally, I'm in my late 20s, so younger, less curmudgeony folks may have a different experience. \\n\\nFirst, the good:\\n\\n- Their food is pretty tasty.  There isn't anything outrageously creative on the menu, but it varies a bit from your typical bar food.  \\n\\n- They have a decent beer selection and a few interesting cocktails.\\n\\n- The layout is nice, the bar and bathroom are clean, and the atmosphere is a good mix of laid back and sports bar.  You can (usually) show up 10-15 minutes before a Patriots game and the place is barely 25% full.  It does fill up, but not in the line-out-the-door, elbow-to-elbow, can't-hear-yourself-think way that Tavern in the Square does for games.  People cheer, and there's definitely a good sense of camaraderie that one might look for in a sports bar, but you're not going to run into some guy who's painted his entire body blue jumping up and down while holding a pitcher of Miller High Life and giving you a beer shower.\\n\\n- They're also flexible about seating partial groups at big tables, even if your whole party isn't there yet.  I really appreciated that when I had a birthday party there, and they gave us a table for 12 even though there were only 3 of us when we were seated.  For what it's worth, Tavern won't even put you on the list for tables until your whole party arrives.\\n\\nThe not-so-good/awful/infuriating:\\n\\n- The food is pretty overpriced for what it is.  It's good food, but it's still bar food.  $13 for a burger is pushing it, IMHO.\\n\\n- The TVs.  There are a lot of them, all along the bar and wall, as well as two HUGE TVs at the end of the bar.  The actual equipment is fine, but the channel management was pretty awful.  On a Sunday during the regular football season, at which time two postseason baseball games were also taking place, it took them 30 minutes to switch to the Patriots game because the manager seemed intent on seeing the end of a different game (which was on about 7 TVs throughout the place).  This might be understandable if there had been, say, a huge table of customers asking for that game to be left on, but nope - everyone was asking him to put the Patriots on. A few people even left for a different bar because he refused to change the channel on a single TV.  He also ignored requests to change one TV to show the MLB playoff game until the 8th inning. I don't manage a sports bar so I confess that I don't know the protocol, but one would think that if 95% of your customers are requesting a specific game, you'd be able to put it on at least one of your 20+ televisions.\\n\\n- The service.  I've had mixed experiences here, ranging from \\"eh\\" to \\"where the #%(*&# is the server??\\"  On more than one occasion, we've started going up to the bar directly to buy drinks because the waitress was only stopping by about once an hour, not clearing empty glasses or plates, and taking 15-20 minutes to bring a pitcher of beer if we did order from her.\\n\\nOverall, it's a fun place to watch a game, provided they put the game on in the first place.  You can spend $40 on a sandwich and 3 beers, but at least no one's sitting on your table so they can see the TV better."},{"name":"Cafe Orso","address":"4316 Gallant Avenue","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"We got the fresh falafel bowl and the sour Tuscan sandwich.

If you can't eat it, don't order the thing that comes with it.  If you don't want anything else, here's the amazing thing:  There's plenty of other restaurants to go to.\\n\\n'Apparently I'm a sloppy eater and splash sauce everywhere like a toddler in a bathtub-- how dare Pei Wei do this to me'.  \\nBro, learn how to put the food in your mouf.\\n\\n'OMG its 2016 and they just got them dang new Cokie Coler machines.  Yee-haw, I haven't experience technawlogie like this since I done seen a space shuttle fly to the moon'.  \\nMan, they have had those Freestyle Coke machines for over a year, maybe longer.  Hey, guess what?  Did you know that you pay more for a soda at restaurants that have the Freestyle machines than you would for the same size soda at places that don't?  And you haven't noticed that Freestyle sodas have a weird taste, like more seltzer-water tasting?  Golly gee, bland flavor Coke products are SO worth the higher price!   Seriously, its almost 2017... please stop calling the Freestyle machines 'new'.\\n\\n'My face was so greasy from just sitting there'.  Are you sure?  Hasn't happened to me yet.  I go there quite often.  I mean, I totally understand what you mean, I've been to places where you smell like grease later, but that hasn't happened to me at Pei Wei... yet.  Or, you know, it is Florida and its hot as nuts outside plus the humidity... are you sure your face wasn't just melting?\\n\\nBut really, Pei Wei has changed, and really the negative  reviews aren't too far off.  However, Pei Wei is certainly heads and shoulders above some absolute garbage like Panda Express, so for fast casual Chinese fusion, its still a winner... even if everything is sticky.  I have smelled the B.O. of TWO employees on 2 different occasions.  CheeseAndCrepes, rub some soy sauce on your pits or something if you have an aversion to deodorant.\\n\\nThe other reality is you'll get a whole lot more food at 'real' Asian diners for the same price.  I spent 1/3 less the price at a good Thai place for literally twice the amount of food that tasted better.  But I know, not everyone has time to drive over to a decent Thai, Chinese or Korean joint, so Pei Wei is the next best thing.  \\n\\nBut my one true complaint... for YEARS now, their stupid receipt printers are pieces of junk and the whole right side of the receipt doesn't come out.  I'm not exaggerating when I say YEARS.  I almost started to think that maybe it was some kind of hipster trait of Pei Wei:  \\"Come for our fast casual Asian cuisine and our unreadable receipts\\".   Is that a big deal? No.  But I can't claim my rewards points because I can't read the receipt.  Is there not a Manager at this store that actually gives a crap about anything?\\n\\nI'll still eat here though... its just one of those places where YOU have to be on your toes because the employees aren't.  If that bothers you so much, then go elsewhere."},{"name":"Zoes Kitchen","address":"2333-A Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Superb service & food at this Buckhead location.

Honestly for the price and the location setting- I expected more. \\n\\nFirst the rolls. They are good. They are like pretzel and a bun. The salt on top makes it taste like a pretzel and it comes in a cute little cast iron pan. \\n\\nSecondly- the appetizer we ordered was the bone marrow. I heard so many good things about this but really I wasn't that impressed. It's not that it was gross or anything to be served that with a bunch of bread just seemed like it was covering up for the lack of flavor that we got out of it. Plus it was very expensive $19 for two little bones and giant pieces of toast. The red wine reduction that came with it was delicious and we saved it for our steaks. \\n\\nThirdly- the entrees. My boyfriend ordered the beef Wellington. The portion of it was very large and it was heavy. It was perfectly cooked- to medium rare. I ordered the 8oz filet mignon. Personally I felt it was cooked more medium well than medium. It came with a bone marrow butter, which was good but without it the steak was dry and flavorless. It was also served on this giant plate that was really unnecessary. \\n\\nWe both agreed that having the steak for the prices being a la carte was ridiculous. The squash pur√©e was excellent but the whipped potatoes were bland and I honestly make better at home. \\n\\nI don't think we would return here mostly because we feel it was overpriced and what they charged- we expected a little more.

It's always Vietnamese, which is fine but different!. And by the way, if you are going to order a Vietnamese dish, for the love of pearl don't go to a Cambodian restaurant to do it.

I do not know the name of the area it is from, but I do know this is my favorite spot in all of Boston for tacos, burritos and margaritas. Every Monday the restaurant has burrito specials and every Tuesday is \\"taco Tuesday\\" with half-priced delicious tacos. This makes it a favorite destination that we often plan on for lunch or dinner.  New owner's took over the restaurant a little while ago (past 2-5 months) and they are continuing the great service and great food.

I ordered the twin fillets (8oz) and my husband had the single fillet mingnon (10oz). The steaks were good overall, we'd probably put them in 2nd place for Boston (3rd in a longer list with additional cities). One of my filletts was overcooked, but they replaced it quickly with a properly seared piece. \\n\\nThe winelist is impressively long, but no one offered to help us navigate it and when we made our first selection, our server gave us a look that said \\"are you sure you want to do that?\\", so I took the wine list back to look again (again, no help or suggestions offered). I finally settled on another wine and then they brought the wrong bottle to the table (another vineyard), which they quickly removed once I noticed the mistake (before it was opened). Finally, with the right bottle in hand, we were ready to wait for the food, which we did--not an unreasonably long time, but definitely a leisurely pace.\\n\\nWe started with oysters, which were delicious, and also had blue cheeese mashed potatoes with our steaks, which was unremarkable. Finally, we decided to end the night with a shared creme brulee. This dessert is one of my favorites in part because of the fun of cracking the burnt-sugar top, but unfortuntely this creme brulee did not have a crust at all, it was just cooked custard, which tasted good, but was also very disappointing. \\n\\nFinally, it was our 2nd wedding anniversary, so I noted that on our opentable.com reservation, as well as requesting a quiet, private table (after reading other reviews that talked about the noise level of this place), We were sat in the upstairs section, which was quieter than the racous (and under-dressed) downstairs, but there was nothing special about the table location itself--between 2 other couples. There was no mention made of the Anniversary occation until the very end of the meal (\\"Happy Anniversary\\" written on chocolate, came with our soggy creme brulee), but no comped glass of champagne or dessert or anything. Not that it's expected, but always a nice touch when fine restaurants acknoweledge special celebrations.\\n\\nOverall, I think we're going to continue our quest for the best Steak in Boston, but I wouldn't be opposed to giving Grill 23 one more chance with adjusted expectations."},{"name":"Yugo Restaurant","address":"4265 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Nice quiet restaurant with very fresh and tasty selections.

So after not offering an apology, throwing a fit, and taking 10-12 minutes to bring the drink I had ordered in the first place, we got to order. Everything from here went fairly smoothly. We had the courses, and had a great deal of fun, but what we didn't have was a pleasant waitress. She ran through things explaining it all as though she hated her job, and ran through this spiel a million times a day, clearly not having any fun, and making it seem rushed and negative. I'm sure she was just having a bad day. The entertainment is great, loved the belly dancer, loved the food (we had a King feast), and the mint tea was amazing.

Hardwood floors and yellow light, and a golden menu board advertising \\"Spaghetti Feed, 10$\\". Two women outside on the christmas-light-lit patio feed each other garlic bread and marinara from tongs in the fading dusk. A man inside offers a taste of his beverage. \\n\\nWe get our drinks and lurch upstairs. Model airplanes, and dark walls, and golden doors, and clear windows that look out to the warm dusk.\\n\\nThe beauty of the place is that someone cared. Someone knew enough to make sure the vinyl chairs upstairs matched the vinyl seats, that the walls were perfectly painted to give the impression of age, to put tiny, blue camping cups atop the mason jars of water, to convert an old closet to a cozy nook for couples, to keep the claw-foot bathtub in the bathroom, to have a painting of Bob, from the Church of the sub-Genius.\\n\\nRay Charles plays in the background: big band, big voice..\\n\\nThe cocktails aren't the cheapest in Portland, nor the best, nor the most interesting.

If you like crispy bacon, it's not for you. But if you like bacon that's more meaty, this is where you need to go. Same with the biscuit. Easily my favorite part of the meal. It was perfectly fluffy, and the blueberry preserves to go with it were good (if just a tad too sweet).\\n-Friendly staff: the waitress who helped us was very attentive. They were really busy when we went (1 PM on a Saturday), so we didn't see her too often. But that's sometimes a nice thing, since we didn't feel rushed to get out.\\n-Good menu: it's just big enough to give you adequate choices, while still keeping to a specialized list.\\n\\nWhat I didn't like about Sun in My Belly:\\n-Noise level: it was really loud. The rooms are really large, with walls and a floor that bounce back sound. It wasn't really easy to have a conversation with my husband, and it would be really difficult to have a conversation with a full table. It's a good place to bring kids, but not a good place to bring anyone who has difficulty hearing, or who likes to have conversations over meals.\\n-The food was too rich: Don't get me wrong here, it tasted wonderful. It's just that after a few bites of my meal (the Kirkwood Breakfast), I really didn't want to eat any more. The flavor of the cheese, along with the richness of the bacon and the super sweetness of the blueberry preserves on the biscuit, were just too much. There wasn't anything on the plate that was simple, to give you a break from the rich food. It's like when I eat dark chocolate: great for a few bites, but I wouldn't want an entire bar of it all at once.\\n\\nOverall, the food was quite good (though the blueberry brownie that we bought up at the counter was tough - probably overmixed), and the staff is friendly.

However, by lunch time, they had run out of most types of bagels.\\n\\nOne time, they obviously forgot my order and I was waiting for about 10 minutes. None of the staff behind the counter asked me what I ordered, just kind of stared at me, and most of them were just talking to each other (it was pretty empty). Luckily, one of the managers saw me and came up and asked me what I ordered. He told them to make it (they hadn't started) and he also gave me a free piece of fruit. He told me to go ahead and sit down and he'd bring the order to me when it was ready. This definitely made up for the long wait. \\n\\nI'm giving this 3 stars mostly just because I love ABP.

The bread is wonderful and they use fresh, quality ingredients. The majority of the staff here are friendly and I would ordinarily give them high marks...but not today. I work in the area and I go here, on average, about once a week for lunch. Since $10 is pretty steep for a sandwich, it's a treat for me to eat here on occasion. Since they can be pretty busy at lunch time and I only get 30 minutes for lunch, I normally call my order in ahead of time and take it to go. After driving over and waiting in line to pay, I was told they didn't have my order. When I gave her the name of the person I spoke to, I was told that I had called my order in to the other location on Fremont. I was then told there would be a 20 minute wait to make my sandwich...that was all I had...one sandwich. There were maybe 3-4 other customers waiting there for their orders so it wasn't as if they were insanely busy and there were 3 people working the sandwich line at the time. I politely explained to the woman helping me (who I think may have actually been a manager) that I didn't have that long to wait since I only get 30 minutes for lunch and I was already 20 minutes into it at that point. I asked if there was anything they could do to expedite my order. She went and checked with someone else and returned and told me that no, they couldn't do anything because they had just been hit with a rush of call-in orders. So even though I was there standing in front of them, they couldn't quickly make one sandwich? I can understand not putting me ahead of the customers waiting in the lobby, but the call-in people weren't even there to pick up their orders yet. I realize it was my mistake and that it was my fault and not theirs; however, what happened to customer service and trying to be helpful and accommodating?

I'm usually not as \\"adventurous\\" of an eater due to digestive issues. We got the Hummus trio, chicken and orzo soup, chicken kabobs (which came with rice pilaf, pita bread, and Greek salad), steak kabobs (which had grilled potato and roasted veggies). We obviously ordered WAY more than our two stomachs could handle in one sitting. The fact that my hubby, who isn't into leftovers, ate the rest of our order the next day is almost miracle worthy in our house. \\nThe first night I ate most the salad and we downed half the hummus trio down together. He devoured the steak kabobs and most of his sides. The salad was fresh and crisp, the veggies ripe and flavorful. The color on my plate made me smile, lots of bright, clean ingredients. The smells, textures, and flavors were spot on. \\nToday he had the soup, while we split the last of the hummus trio, the chicken kabobs, and rice pilaf. Hubby enjoyed the soup. And even thought we reheated the kabobs in the microwave, the chicken was still moist, the cherry tomatoes still juicy, the onions and pepper and rice weren't dry. The flavors were more blended and just as delicious. \\nAs this was a to-go meal, and I wasn't there when he ordered, the only thing my husband seemed \\"upset\\" about was the wait time in ordering. If that wait is what it took to get food of this quality, I say it was well worth it.

I would give it 3.5 stars. While the staff was amazing cool about dealing with my Canola allergy, very nice of them. And the dishes we had, a party of six, were certainly tasty, for the most part. The concept of bringing by dishes and offering them up certainly is somewhat appealing. It eliminates the order procedure and that definitely speed things up. Now, there are a few aspects of this restaurant that don't jell with the ambition of the food and the prices charged for it. First off, the setting reminds me of a college cafeteria. The decoration, tables and chair are minimalistic, but that is probably the idea. On top of the place being loud already, there is rock music blasted at a fairly high volume. Okay, another choice to give the place the vibe of having an edge. Being a wine guy, I was thoroughly disappointed by the wine list. There are six reds by the glass and three more by the bottle. We tried one of the latter, a big, bold Grenache from Argentina. For our second bottle, since I don't order the same wine twice, I choose a bottle of Zinfandel. This was the thinnest Zin I have ever tasted and a poor representation of that grape variety. So, a bit more attention paid to the wine list would go a long way. As I said, the food was good, but not quite that far out there as I had come to expect. Heck, I just had a very tasty beef heart at another Atlanta restaurant. And, there is no valet parking, even though the neighborhood is a bit challenging in regards to this. Again, probably another choice of minimalism.

I think so.\\n\\nOn the other hand, when having been informed that some of the food is very raw (meaning it's still alive and has retained it's nutrients) and then encountering a live action salad with the action provided by a worm vigorously doing it's best to escape my fork...well...I'm not certain I want my food THAT live! :-O  Eek!  \\n\\nGiven that I know how to slaughter various animals and know my way around growing things, not sure why one worm makes me squeamish???  Perhaps it's 'cause the slaughtered animals are thoroughly roasted, stewed, fried, or boiled by the time I'm done with them and not trying to escape the plate with life left in them...oh wait!  I just went off on a tangent when talking about a vegetarian / vegan restaurant!  (Apologies to all my veggie / vegan friends and readers!)\\n\\nAnyways, the chef's reaction was even funnier when I quietly and kind of embarassed took my plate and worm up to him.  He looked really sternly at me, then at the worm, took my plate, then proceeded to SQUASH the little guy!!!  Not what I was expecting...he then looked like he wanted to hand the salad plate, squished worm and all, back to me.  Seriously.  He wasn't kidding.  Ahhahaha!  \\n\\nWell, my friend, quite concerned for my first experience at Casa De Luz having taken a turn for the unexpected, wondered if I wanted to go.  But, we braved the rest of the meal (it was cooked - a key element here!), which was quite tasty, filling in a satisfyingly refreshing way, and worth the whole worm experience.  \\n\\nAnd I made a new food discovery: organic ginger jello!!!  Hello!?  The most tantalizing salivary taste explosion I've had in a while!  While I forget it's proper name, this dessert alone will make me go back to Casa De Luz, again and again and again.  In fact, the ability to taste / eat my way through their entire dessert fridge is reason enough to return.  The organic coconut jello is pretty good, too.\\n\\nSo, all in all...while I might skip the salad bar on a next visit, there are the soups (delicious), cooked items (the food really digests well!), and desserts to enjoy.  Add it's peaceful environment and we've got something here...\\n\\nMaybe I'm not so conflicted after all :)\\n\\n\\nPS If you're not a fan of lightly flavoured / bland tasting food, this might not be the spot for you.  But if you do want to promote healthy digestion post eating, this is definitely something to do once a quarter."},{"name":"Siam Thai Restaurant","address":"123 Sycamore St","city":"Decatur","stars":"3.5","text":"My only wish is that it were closer to home. \\n\\nA friend and I were bumming around the square one evening and decided to pop in and give this place a shot.

I was surprised how good everything tasted, not that I should have been. My curry was slightly sweeter than expected, making it more Americanized, but it was still delicious.

We sat right next to each other.  I call this the sweetheart table.  Decor was simple and rustic just the way I like it.  It was very open and just a beautiful simple space that they spiced up in a classy way.  Our server was very polite and prompt.  We started off the night with a couple of appetizers aka \\"Small Plates.\\"  My favorite \\"Small Plate\\" was Sweet Corn Soup.  There was a good portion of lump blue crab pieces swimming in it.    The carpaccio was nice as well.  Very pretty presentation and touch of greens and sprinkled with chunks of cheese which made my palate dance. The boyfriend got the Scallops (which he loved and I agreed that they were pretty darn good) and I got the \\"Three Little Piggies.\\"  We also paired our meals with the quad sampler (not what it's really called) where there were a variety of fresh vegetables/sides.   Everything was well seasoned and fresh!  I really liked the seasonal menu concept (similar to Seasons 52) and their farm to table concept.  Another thing that was nice was that they split the appetizers into two for us without even requesting it since we were sharing.  We ended our meal with one of their desserts which was also tasty and fresh.  This is a restaurant where service was great.  They were always one step ahead of you.

The food and execution here are classically inspired. refined new American.  The dishes tend towards the delicate rather than the rustic.  The place is not much to look at from the outside but somewhat unexpectedly glitzy inside, looking a little like Rathbun's.  The service is not quite as impeccable as Canoe, Woodfire, or Bacchanalia, but it's very much more of a white tablecloth dining experience than most restaurants at this price point, more so than, say ESS or One Eared Stag, and certainly more so than rustic restaurants like Cakes & Ale or Local Three.  Aesthetically it's also a bit more old-school fine dining, look at the plating of dishes in the pictures and you will understand.  Whether that's a strength or not depends on personal preference.  But I thought that explains why the price seems rather high.   \\n\\nDishes had:\\n\\nWood Grilled Octopus with Ligurian Whipped Potatoes, Watercress, Charred Oyster Mushrooms, Chorizo Vinaigrette - preparations like the whipped potatoes and chorizo vinaigrette are refined, the octopus goes very well with the oyster mushrooms, the whole dish gives a wonderful smoky smell like it's supposed to\\n\\nWarm Maplebrook Buratta with Wood Grilled Naan Bread, Tybee Island Shrimp, Calabrese Chiles, Split Fava Beans - shrimp is super tender and delicious and goes wonderful with the buratta.  I thought the naan bread was not very naan-like and unnecessary.  \\n\\nBlue Ridge Trout \\"A La Plancha\\" with English Pea Fennel Dumpling, Pearl Onion Confit, Shaved Asparagus, Beurre Espelette - the fish is cooked perfectly, shaved asparagus is interesting to see and textually, is a fun way to eat asparagus.  I've never had dumplings like these before either.  It was a technically impressive dish.  However, I felt this dish starts to taste too \\"green\\" after you eat it for a while.\\n\\n\\"Three Little Piggies\\" Berkshire Pork Loin, Wilted Spinach, Cotachino, Chicharron Popcorn, Pickled Red Grapes - Porky and delicious.  The different preparations contrast well and keep the dish interesting.  The loin at times was a little tough to chew.  \\n\\nAlso had a couple cocktails.  Compared to the slightly traditional tone of the restaurant, the drinks are very up-to-date with the whole craft cocktails movement, complete with a mezcal drink, use of various vermouths, righteous base liquors, etc.   The drinks I had were creative and well thought out.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I would totally come to the bar just for the drinks.    \\n\\nUnlike a lot of restaurants these days, this one makes their own bread (instead of get it from H&F).

We average every other week for happy hour at this spot, and it never gets old.  A few reasons why include the happy hour menu, the strength of their drinks, and the vibe at the 6th street location.\\n\\n--The 6th Street location has the best vibe and setup of the three Z'Tejas locations I've visited (other ones being Arboretum and off Parmer).  You can choose outside or inside, and the inside dining room has a nice back room and front room that are quieter and less bunched-up than the main dining room by the bar.\\n\\n--The drinks are tasty, but most importantly, they are made strong.  You can get a lot of good drinks for cheap on their happy hour menu, but the best part is that they are made with a punch.  I don't mind spending good money on drinks as long as I feel it.  I'll pay $20 for a cocktail if it knocks me on my butt.  But nothing pisses me off more than ordering margaritas or other mixed drinks, and feeling like I just drank a virgin slurpee.  You won't find that at Z'Tejas.\\n\\n--The happy hour menu is great.  The Tejas Trio is a must.  The street tacos are outstanding, and the quesadillas are great.  They are all on heavy discount during happy hour, and if you order 3 appetizers between two people, you don't need to bother with an entree.  Ensure you ask for the corn bread as soon as you sit down!  Hint: in case they ask you trivia about the corn bread, the secret ingredient is yogurt, which makes it the best corn bread I've ever eaten (sorry, I'm not from the deep south, but I did live in Mississippi once...)\\n\\n--The staff has always been great.  On the rare occasion that we do decide to split an entree in addition to the appetizers, they are kind enough to bring them out on two plates so that we don't have to share off one plate.  \\n\\nOverall, we've had great experience after great experience, so I think you'll enjoy it as well."},{"name":"Sun in My Belly","address":"2161 College Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I loved this place.

Although they were pretty good, they weren't mindblowing.  Nevertheless, the table really enjoyed them.\\n\\nAnother heavily raved dish was the Diablo Pasta.  The sauce was good, but wasn't enough for the amount of noodles.  Essentially it was eating a plate full of noodles with maybe a hint of taste from the sauce.  Not a fan.  The Patron Fruzion was pretty tasty, but I wish it was more \\"frozen\\".  Like Trudy's margaritas \\"frozen\\".\\n\\nOverall, we all had a fun time there, and the waiters definitely made everything run smoothly.

Discovered one of my new favorite wines here at dinner one evening. The menu is extensive, and available online to view before you visit; they are great about updating their website. Daily specials are always available in addition to the regular menu. \\n\\nService is solid, occasionally there are reasonably-long waits for tables (either show up early or 45 minutes after opening on weekends!) and/or food, because the restaurant is busy.

OMG!!  In the many, many years I've dine out I have never,ever,ever, had a worse experience than this one!!  It all started with having to wait 15 minutes for a soup I ordered.  I wouldn't of minded the wait that much if our server was not counting her tips and then eating and mindlessly talking with the other servers instead of checking on my soup.  Once I finally got the soup, I found a hair in it and was immediately turned off.  I wanted to tell the server, but she never returned to check on us.  I wanted to leave at this point, but it was around 3pm and I had no breakfast or lunch so I was famished.  After another 15-20 minutes our main entree finally came out.  We ordered what is called the \\"Bandeja Paisa\\", Columbia's typical dish.  Well, the order was not as we asked for it.  First, we asked for green plantains instead of yellow, but they claimed they had run out of the green ones (I then saw another table get served green plantains), second, there was no avocado with the meal as its suppose to and the server stated that the avocado was not ripe, third, the beans were missing.  I asked the server for a salad to replace the avocado and she went to get those two things.  Five minutes later she comes out with the salad, but no beans still.  I like my rice with the beans so I was becoming very upset now because my food was getting cold, I was starving and couldn't eat my food how I wanted it.  So she goes gets the beans and puts in on the table and starts to walk away without asking if there was anything else we needed or if my husband who was already eating was liking his food.  I had to call her and ask if there was any salad dressing since she didn't offer any.  She never checked on us again.  I was so furious I couldn't eat but a couple of bites.  We asked for our check from another server.  When she brought the check I noticed that the soup that I didn't eat because it had a hair in it had not been taken off the bill.  I pointed that out to her.  Folks, following is the reason why I said that has been the worse experience of MY LIFE!!!!  As the owner approches our table, my husband and I expected an apology for our terrible experience and possible a discount.  NOPE, not even close to what happened!!  The owner instead tells us that once the food is served we have to pay for it!!!  What the heck?!!!  I told him I've never heard of such a thing.  I reminded him that I didn't eat the soup, but he didn't care.  He kept insisting we had to pay the full bill.  I'm sorry to say, but I was so furious I had to just leave.  Folks, I am not even going to say that the food was the worse I ever had (a hair in the food can happen anywhere), the service and the owner's attitude however were!!  Don't patron this place.  The owner knows nothing about customer service or retention!!!!

I've had appetizers and entrees I've liked more or less; I enjoy their pineapple fried rice and pad thai, but am less excited by their larb tofu or their chicken satay.  One of the things that keeps me coming back to them is that they offer bubble tea smoothies in a number of flavors, and (if you ask for extra bubbles), as much boba as you'll find in a bubble tea joint, which is uncommon for delivery, especially in Arlington.\\n\\nCUSTOMER SERVICE: Amazing. Seriously. Probably the best I've ever received, to the point where I was almost a little embarrassed about mentioning a mistake.  Their assistant, Cody/Bom is pleasant and mostly sticks to solution-focused responses, and their manager, Banditt, is out of this world in terms of customer response.  The one time there was a serious mistake, we not only received a refund, but a free meal of our favorites, and /flowers/!  I was kind of stunned.\\n\\nWHY NOT FIVE STARS: I like a /good bit/ of their food, but there are still hit-and-miss dishes.  Additionally, there was /once/ -- out of 10+ times, to be completely clear -- that we found tiny pieces of plastic in my bubble tea smoothie.

The prior time I ordered the pork chop and it was so tough that I had to literally saw each piece (with a steak knife) to where both it and the sides were flying off my plate.  It was tasteless so I stopped eating it because it wasn't worth the hassle (and the mess).\\n\\nThe sides (Vermont Cheddar Stone Ground Grit Cake, Braised Greens, Grilled Peach Tasso Piperade) were unimpressive and the Grit Cake was truly gritty - as in dirt consistency.  I would not recommend this dish.\\n\\nThis Saturday, we had the tall, very slender waitress with hair that was super short in the back and long in the front.  I was the only one to order a salad (the beet salad) and she asked \\"do you want them together?\\" and I said \\"no, not really but don't hold up anyone's dinner because of me\\" - meaning no need to wait until I finish my salad to serve the other entrees.  \\n\\nIn an unexpected fashion (when everything else had been so slow), ten minutes later, my salad was served along with the others' entrees.  There were about 4 or 5 pieces of beet and some frisee (which was especially bitter with the buttermilk dressing - plus greens were not even mentioned in the description).  I was done with that in about 5 minutes because I was ravenous.  We had to wait for a table (even though there were empty ones).\\n\\nI surfed the others' plates because I was hungry.  No waitress in sight even though the place had emptied out (a very large party left).  This went on for about 15 to 20 minutes.  \\n\\nOne woman at my table said, \\"Oh she MUST have forgotten, and I said \\"I hope so at this point.\\"  Once my friends were done with their dinners, the waitress appears with my plate of risotto with NO apology! \\n\\nI said, \\"no thank you, I'm all set.\\"  She said, would you like it wrapped to go?\\nI said, \\"No that's ok.\\"  She said \\"Well, I'll still have to charge you for it.\\"\\n\\nI said, \\"I don't think so - I've been sitting here for at least 15 minutes without food or a cocktail and you never checked in on me.\\"\\n\\nShe said, \\"Well, you SAID you didn't want the salad and your entree at the same time and you still had food on your plate.\\"\\n\\nI said, \\"I was done with my salad about 15 minutes ago and I certainly did not expect to get my entree once everyone else was done with theirs\\".  If she had watched me, my fork did not touch my mouth after the first five minutes.\\n\\nThen, this is the topper, she says, \\"Well you never cancelled the order\\".\\nI said, \\"You never checked in so that I could.\\"  She then stormed off.\\n\\nTo have FIVE back and forths over something so clearly unacceptable is shocking and pretty much ruined my evening.  I go out only one night a week and wanted a nice dinner with friends, not to get into a verbal altercation with an obnoxious server.  The other effect was to make my friends uncomfortable in having to witness this.  Major damper on the evening.\\n\\nAdding insult to injury, I was still hungry and I hadn't even had a drink to sip on during this time.

Very nice ambiance though and perhaps their entree's are better\\n\\n(5/10) Coxinha de Frango\\nSeasoned, diced chicken breast with cheese, rolled up into a pastry. Served with spicy malaqueta vinaigrette on the side. This basically tasted like fried cheese balls. And there were only 3 of them...now granted it was happy hour - but still very small portions. We love cheese but expected more for the price and since its supposed to be Brazilian food. Also, the malaqueta vinaigrette is pretty oily and lacked in flavor.\\n\\n(5/10) Mandioca Griddles\\nYucca cakes seasoned with Portuguese herbs and cheese, lightly pan fried. Served with a spicy tomato vinaigrette. We were excited to have authentic Brazilian food but we honestly felt we were eating a piece of deep fried potato with tomato sauce and cheese on top. Yucca can be savory but Sampaio's let us down again. Will we have better luck with the next dish? Read to find out...\\n\\n(5/10) Marisco ao Molho Verde\\nMussels sauteed in a verde-anise garlic butter sauce and served with crostini. Oh no another disappointment! Although this dish had a lot of mussels, the garlic butter flavor just didn't come through. The only fun part was dipping the crostini (thinly sliced, toasted white bread) into the soupy sauce and enjoying the crunch.\\n\\n(8/10) Pastel de Frango Com Passas\\nDelicate pastry stuffed with chicken, raisins, corn cilantro and cheese. Served with mango relish on the side. Finally, a dish that is better than average! The outside of the pastry is warm and soft and the corn cilantro is a nice addition. The mango relish complemented the pastry well, and there was not a crumb left on our plates.\\n\\nService (7/10)\\nWe went during happy hour, where Sampaio's advertises half-priced appetizers. We were promptly seated and the hostess, bartender and waiter were all nice. The waiter offered suggestions when prompted, and he checked up on us often enough. Our dishes were brought out on a timely manner, but to be fair we should note that the restaurant was almost empty.\\n\\nAmbiance (7/10)\\n\\nSampaio's has booths and tables, bar seating and an outside patio. There are only a couple parking spaces outside so you may have to park on a side-street. The interior has a dark wood, upscale feel to it. But you can dress casual or dress up a bit - either would be fine. They left the doors open so there was a gentle breeze and it felt nice. The atmosphere may have been more energized if there were more patrons dining. The quality and quantity of the appetizers weren't special, but perhaps the entrees are better. Either way, there are too many other places to try in Austin!"},{"name":"Uncle Kenny's BBQ","address":"157 N Hwy 27","city":"Clermont","stars":"4.5","text":"The food here is pretty good.

I don't know if they were just setting up or putting things away, but it was 12 noon - lunchtime - so neither makes sense. I then proceeded to build my bowl with the little options they had. I initially asked for steak but they didn't have it, so I went with the tofu option but the server misheard me and scooped out the pork instead. I should have taken that as a bad sign but honestly I was tired and I figured pork is fine, I like pork. I then added white rice, roasted salsa, and the corn salsa. Like I said, they barely had any options when I went so that was all I could choose that appealed to me. So I paid and the cashier gave me the wrong change, he owed me another $10.

I started out innocently enough with the endive, watercress and spiced walnut salad--very nice, but then I have a soft spot for endives and walnuts. The beef sirloin capriccio was magnificent--the vinaigrette was so light it didn't overpower the thin slices of meat like I've sometimes experienced. For sides, we had the exotic mushroom mix, creamed spinach, truffled parmesan fries, potato gratin--- all very good/standard but it was the moo mac and cheese with lobster which really made my heart thumped. I don't think god approves of culinary foreplay but be that as it may, I kept on digging spoonfuls of it into my mouth and sighing in anticipation of the next spoonful. For entrees, I got a bit more sinful and ordered the Beef Wellington--the layers of foi gras (how I've sinned!) and spinach between the tenderloin and pastry shell had the right texture/consistency but the pastry shell itself was a bit too soggy by the time the dish came out. Flaccid pastry aside, I borrowed my coworker's bone marrow butter to taste with my steak-- overkill perhaps but nevertheless added a rich succulence to the meat. I also tried the sea scallops with parsnip puree and oyster mushrooms--- can I inappropriately \\"moooo\\" here? Moooo. Big time delicious.

Recently, after a hard day of database-wrangling at my company's new digs, during which I neglected to have both breakfast and lunch, I realized that I needed a burger and a martini desperately. This wasn't a run-of-the-mill desire, this was a get-the-f****-out-of-my-way-before-I-chew-your-face-off addict craving. I went on yelp, drew a straight line from my current position to North Station, and filtered by \\"full bar\\". Then I looked for a menu with a burger under $10. This place fit the bill.\\n\\nOn a random weekday around 3:15, the place was almost empty. Good, I didn't want to talk to anyone anyway. I sat down, ordered my standard \\"Beefeater martini, extra dry, straight up with a twist\\". The bartender did a doubletake and asked me to repeat it. So I shortened it: \\"Beefeater martini, extra dry.\\" I got exactly what I asked for. A big glass of cold gin. Nectar of the gods. I ordered a cheeseburger as well. The burger was exactly what I needed: a barfood cheeseburger. The martini and the burger were each under $10.\\n\\nI was so happy.\\n\\nFast-forward less than a week. I am still working at the new site, and I suggest to a friend we meet here for a drink. It's almost empty at 5:30 (2 other people at the bar). I order my Beefeater martini exactly as before. I watch him pour the gin and think, that's not even a shot. Sure enough, when he brings the drink over, the martini glass is not even half full. Martini glasses are shaped like funnels, right? this one is barely making the halfway mark in height (much less volume). Now this has happened before (although not to this extent). The bartender usually has the common decency to look sheepish or avoid eye contact while walking away quickly to another patron as if to say, you ordered a martini at a dive bar, what do you want?. Nope. The bartender has the nerve to say \\"Sorry for the big glass, I promise you it's really a full drink.\\"\\n\\nMotherf***er. Don't f ***ing piss on me and tell me it's raining. I've gotten meager martinis and been charged $14. I've gotten great martinis and been charged $6. I've drank martinis in plenty of parts of this country and abroad. I've made a fair number myself.

I ordered items from different sections (salad with grilled salmon and BBQ pork sliders) and was happy with both.  I think the prices were on par too.  A lot of places would try to price gouge on salmon but I didn't feel that was happening here.  \\n\\nMy pork sliders were pretty good.  The meat was mostly lean and cooked well with a lot of BBQ sauce.  The buns were nice and soft.  The cole slaw was served in the bun on top of the meat.  There was a bout a tablespoon of slaw on each one.  It was not the worst slaw I've had but it was surely not more than mediocre.  They use mayonnaise rather than vinegar in it too.  (Again, this is normal for some slaw styles but I prefer the vinegar style.)\\n\\nMy server was properly attentive.  The food came out in just the perfect amount of time.  The lighting was just the perfect amount of casual with a touch of romance but not necessarily romantic. \\n\\nThe place has spacious seating.  I think this would be an excellent place to bring a group of people for food and drinks or even to bring a date. \\n\\nHere are the things that I didn't like:\\n\\nIt had been snowing out earlier and although melt pellets had been sprinkled out front it was still very very slippery when I walked through the front door.  I think if I hadn't had to pull so hard on the front door I would have lost my footing but thankfully I had a firm grip on the door. \\n\\nLet me preface this by saying that, from what I understand of salmon preparation,  it was prepared perfectly.  I, however, am a weirdo who enjoys dry overcooked meat (when I eat animals, which may explain why I eat a lot of meat replacement foods).  The salmon, for MY tastes, could have been cooked a minute or two longer.  I only note this because this is a tidbit of information that I would love to read in someone else's review.  I ate all but the very center lower portion of the fillet and to be honest, there was so much food at a good price that I didn't mind leaving a little behind on my plate.  The part I left, while totally cooked, was just a bit too soft for my texture needs.  \\n\\nLastly, something seemed a little off with the parking lot.  First of all, as I mentioned above, it had been snowing earlier in the day.  The parking lot is sortof a donut shape around the building.  When I first pulled in I thought it was weird that a few of the parking spaces towards the entry to the restaurant contained cars that had obviously been in the parking space for over 3 hours.  To me, there is a good chance that employees were the ones parking in those spots.  In all my time working in restaurants, this type of thing was never acceptable.   \\n\\nThat said, there was also what seemed to be an unusually high number of available handicap parking spaces.  So if you are handicapped, rest assured, you will park close to the door. \\n\\nOne last positive thing- I noticed a nice sized patio towards the rear of the building.  It looked like a great place to meet up with friends in the summer for food and drinks.  \\n\\nI'm an out of towner, so who knows if I'll be back in but if you live nearby you should definitely consider trying this place."},{"name":"Cheerful Tortoise","address":"1939 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"T the best food in the world but definitely not the worst.

Who knows? Without the candles nearby it would have been impossible to see the other people at my own table! Also, we're under the impression that the staff was somehow spying on us during the meal. We were convinced there was some kind of listening device at the table, because as soon as you say something, you get a result. You could just write it off as them being efficient, but it doesn't always apply to the meal. Sometimes you're just pointing out the hot members of staff floating around the dining room, and as soon as you say something, they react in some way, giving you a sign that they're on to you. \\n\\nSpy games aside, the food was pretty good. Pretty average for a steakhouse like this, but pretty good. I'm a big fan of tomatoes, and I thoroughly enjoyed the tomato bacon and blue cheese salad. Everybody around me got the beef wellington which each showed up in their own little doughy cocoon. The presentation made me jealous, but I hear the steak itself was standard. I opted for the au poivre, which was peppered very well. It was cooked just right, but I would have liked a better piece of meat. \\n\\nThe dinner rolls were fabulous, as was the accompanying butter. I had 4 or 5 myself because apparently everybody else at the table thought they were at a buffet and didn't want to \\"fill up on bread.\\" Suckers. \\n\\nDesserts were also presented very well. The bananas foster looked like something out of a food photo shoot, but I had a bite and wasn't impressed. The blueberry pie was not a slice from a larger pie, but a whole mini individual sized pie. It was a nice touch. I had to be talked out of ordering the bailey's ice cream sundae for two, and eventually went with the chocolate cake. It was a standard chocolate layer cake, but was very tasty, maybe too tasty. I had to stop eating it and pass it off before I could finish. \\n\\nOverall Mooo is a decent steakhouse if you wanna blow it out for a night, but compared to most of the other high end steakhouses in the area, and I didn't feel I got wowed enough. When I'm eating, I'm not looking to be wowed with sight, I'm looking to be wowed with taste.  At one point after taking a few bites of our dinners, the waiter came out and asked how everything looked. This really bothered me.

During that time we've tried every other steak house in the area and nothing comes close in terms of quality of steak and cooking process. The open BBQ pit really adds that lovely flavoursome crust while meat remains tender and juicy inside. Personally I always go for a Kansas or strip steak or equivalent on the bone. \\n\\nUnfortunately over the years nothing else has changed! The place is a bit drab and needs a makeover. Service is hit and miss and all depends on the server and how many tables he/she is covering. On this visit our server was excellent. \\n\\nWine list is pretty good but pricey. I am not convinced about the storage as the reds are often served too cold. A good sommelier would be a bonus and I am sure wine sales and quality would improve. \\n\\nStarters and sides are ok but nothing special. Why they can't do simple fries rather than some sort of cheese coated wedges I don't know. Asparagus was over cooked and mash a bit sloppy. You get a decent salad and warm bread anyway so you really don't need too much extra! \\n\\nWord of warning. Everything is fried in peanut oil so if you have an allergy avoid. They don't tell you this and should. \\n\\nSo, if you are after good steak, this is the place. If you are looking for a more rounded foodie experience then head to somewhere like Chatham Place or Bull and Bear."},{"name":"Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET","address":"1110 W 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Somewhat rainy Sunday and after a morning of shopping decided to head to Z'Tejas for late lunch/early dinner.  I used to go to the Z'Tejas in Bellevue, WA and loved it until they closed down.  Had always had amazing meals and great service so was expecting nothing less in Austin.  \\n\\nPros:  \\n- Great location and the old house it is in winds around with open indoor and outdoor spaces.  Imagine at night it is pretty as well as lights were strung up outside.\\n- Nice menu and drink selection.  They used to do a great bloody mary bar on the weekends.  We were there a bit later so not sure if they still do.  \\n- Our server was super sweet and balanced quite a few tables successfully as everyone seemed to want to sit in her outdoor section.\\n- Salads we ordered (pecan encrusted chicken and jerk chicken) were both relish.  \\n\\nCons: \\n- Reception desk girls seemed less than thrilled that we were standing there waiting for a table. We had a reservation (not that they were busy) so got seated right away but a little less tude would have been nice.\\n- Tableside guac was pretty bland.  Not much flavor so I would recommend something else if you can.\\n- We found street parking, but kind of a busy area so not sure how hard it would be at a busier time.\\n- A small thing.. but the manager (guess by his attire) was standing up front eating food and not interacting with the guests.  Everyone needs to eat, but doing it standing at reception, shoveling food in?  Didn't look very professional.  \\n\\nMaybe it was just too much to think this location would live up to my previous experience.

I order it and all hell rains down at this location. On the app theirs no way to add it so I put in notes but also order cream cheese to get charged the dollar. Then put no on the notes to not give me the cream cheese. I have been doing this order for almost 10 years. My wife goes to pick up they go you can do that you should've called so forth. She calls me I'm like what's the problem I use the same notes every time. Not it's funny because at other locations in Tampa, Orlando, and Fort Myers they all always tell me don't worry about adding the cream cheese it's not a problem. But I do because it's only fair.

So, the wife and I decided we would try this place out for brunch. She isn't much of a meat eater, but the brunch menu offered a lot of items she would enjoy while I'd get my steak fill. \\n\\nWe walk in, get seated and told the specials and drink menu by the server. Everything was going smoothly. We walked over to the salad bar to plate up all those yummy and exotic offerings. We sit back down and begin to eat. This whole time, we never got our glasses of water. No biggie, we'll wait,  our server must be busy. 10 minutes in, we had to flag down one of the meat servers to ask for water. The wife also wanted to order a cocktail that whole time. \\n\\nWe get served a bread basket with the water and drinks we asked for pretty much halfway through the meal. I think it's safe to say those are things you get at the beginning of the meal, which was a bummer and a flag for me when I eat out at restaurants. \\n\\nThe filet mignon was good and the meat offerings were very flavorful. We were finally being attended to with refills for our drinks towards the end. There was a point where there were no servers at all on the floor and I noticed a few tables of people around us looked like they wanted more food or wanted service for their check. \\n\\nAfter the meal, our server who completely ghosted on us at the beginning was nowhere to be seen throughout the whole experience. We sat for almost 20 minutes to even get the chance to flag a server for our check.

You have two main categories to choose from: old-school Italian style pizza, which is cooked right on the surface of the pizza oven or in flat pizza pans, has a thin, crispy crust with a layer of cheese and sauce; and Greek style, which is only seen in the New England area, is made in pie pans with an edge on them, has an airier crust that is a little doughy, and has a thicker layer of cheese and less sauce. I like them both, but have a slight preference for Italian style. \\n\\nVinnie's is one of the best Italian style pizza's I've had in the greater Boston area. Very thin crust and a great cheese-to-sauce ratio. I like the sauce, although some reviewers here didn't think it was that great. To me, it is a nice, mild sauce that isn't too spicy or too sweet. The toppings are always fresh (although the mushrooms might be from a can, but they tasted delicious to me) and the bottom of the crust is just crispy enough. \\n\\nThe biggest plus for me is that the guy who runs the place, and every person I've ever dealt with - whether in the shop or out on a delivery - has been really friendly.

It also includes big prawns and some kind of meat jerky. Try to get everything into a bite, and you'll be forever satisfied. Mixed vegetable fried rice looked very plain, but the egg in it gives it a nice kick of flavor. One of the meal combos, on the other hand, are just so so. Nothing special about them.

Located not too far from the historic downtown main street of Stone Mountain, this restaurant is a nice option in a town seemingly devoid of unique cuisine. We were staying at a Stone Mountain Marriott resort and I was not about to pay cash money for insipid hotel food.\\n\\nSo we made the drive on the long roads of the park and onto 78 to get to Stone Mountain the town. Chains chains chains. I get it, it's a small town, not Buckhead. Almost nothing but your normal fast food places. Well, that's no fun, and of the independent options Weeyum's seemed the most popular on yelp and closest in line with our cravings.\\n\\nI 100% suggest YOU SHOULD CALL IN YOUR ORDER. We called in on a Saturday night and were told it would be ready about 35-45 minutes later (a little bummed about that). Well, when we got there it still wasn't ready for another 8 or 10 minutes. I am not super familiar in the area. It was pitch black in the small off-street parking lot while we waited for our sandwiches and frankly it felt a little sketchy after dark, but I wouldn't have a problem visiting during the day and if I knew the area better I could make the judgment about actual safety at night. However, there was a security guard keeping watch over the restaurant (may have added to the unsafe vibe I got, ironically, despite making it probably safer).\\n\\nThe Phillys are good, but honestly not exceptional. One of the best \\"authentic\\" Phillys I've had was in St. Augustine, Florida at a place called South-a-Philly: had cheese whiz topping, the whole nine yards. This is a good sandwich, but frankly to me it felt for like a steak and cheese sandwich rather than an authentic Philly. It kind of reminded me of a (much) higher quality version of the steak & cheese sandwich at Subway. Finely minced beef with cheese and by default mayo and onion. I left off the mayo and added green peppers ($.35 a topping, which is a little irritating to me but I get they have to make a living),\\n\\nThe large-size philly is VERY big. If you try to eat it all like I did you will be VERY full. I suggest that two normal-sized people could easily split a large, though I'm not sure how that pricing compares to getting two regulars. As a side we ordered a family portion of the cheese fries. They tasted pretty good, but they were basically frozen crinkle-cut fries topped with cheese product. I could make that at home and have it come out the same.\\n\\nIt was a little above $20 for two regular sized Phillys with green peppers added and a large cheese fry. Price is not bad. Would I return if in Stone Mountain? Sure - there's a couple of other eateries there that caught my eye (Caribbean/Jamaican food) but given the selection in the city I would definitely try again."},{"name":"The Family Dog","address":"1402 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Great place to hang out!

And for an added bonus, they allow dogs on the patio!!!\\n\\n* The salads are great!! I love the house dressing. The lettuce is fresh, the veggies (tomatoes, onions, green & black olives, and bell peppers) are always fresh & crunchy.  One side salad is big enough to feed at least two people.\\n\\n* My usual order is a slice of the spinach & mushroom with sausage.  It's really yummy!!! The slices are huge and they cook it right there so it's really fresh. Depending on your appetite, a salad & a slice are usually filling. \\n\\n* Other great options are the Fellini's Special (with everything on it)!!!

They were horrible. Think vaguely chick pea flavored clay. The side came with a very bland and tasteless sauce. My Falafel sammy with Hummus seemed to either be lacking hummus or else the hummus resembled tahini sauce. \\nThe cucumbers and pickles in the sandwich were great though. \\n\\nSoon my co-workers realized we were missing the salad dressing for their greek salads (pretty average) so we called up and asked for the dressing and a chicken kabob . They offered to deliver, but one of us drove out instead. The chicken kabob was thrown in for free as an apology (very classy).\\nHoly crap... the chicken Kabob was amazing.

Imagine going to brunch and never being asked if you want a refill on your coffee. Imagine waiting 25 minutes for your waitress to return to your table after requesting the check. The trick, I've learned, is to sit at the bar. The bartenders will take care of you. They'll chat with you or leave you alone to read, whatever you're in the mood for, they will pick up on it. Basically just avoid sitting at a table at all costs. That said, the mussels are to die for and completely live up to the hype. The flatbreads are delicious. The brussels sprouts are unbeatable.

It was about $8, and it was nothing special. The cheese was from-the-bag shredded cheddar, the chicken salad was pretty stock (good, but nothing I couldn't get elsewhere), and if the sandwich had been put in a panini press at all, it was only for a few seconds--  the bread wasn't even warm, much less toasted. This was served with a slice of cantaloupe, watermelon, and orange. The watermelon had gone soft/mealy, and the orange was so dry that it actually looked like it'd been intentionally dehydrated.\\n\\nOverall, I'm disappointed to say Babs wasn't really worth the endeavor.

I was pretty upset because I had just walked 12 blocks to get here. There was no way I was about to eat outside. So we decided to go to the bar next door. To our surprise, there was a connecting window to the restaurant in the bar where we could order. The bar seemed pretty empty so we decided to just have a few beers and get a couple tacos. We ended up getting the mahi-mahi and the shark tacos. My companion was not a big fan of fish tacos. However this place was amazing to him. I personally found the tacos but a little bit hard to eat. These overfilled them But I guess I cannot complain about too much food. But I can tell you is that the fish was cooked perfectly. All of the toppings blended together perfectly. Everything just worked perfectly. It was a messy taco. By the time we looked up from our food we realize the entire bar was full and everyone was eating tacos. I'm glad we made this choice. The only thing I can really discourage people from trying is the cilantro fries. French fries and salon Truax are my favorite thing in the world. But these are nothing special. It was literally fries with cilantro thrown on top of it. They could've at least added a truffle oil or something to it. Maybe some Parmesan maybe some onions something.

(For the record, this was already a make-up birthday party - her intended birthday party was canceled due to the snow.)\\n\\nMy sister's boyfriend beats us there.  Apparently they were pretty rude to him when he got there, but I wasn't around to actually observe it.  They glared at him when he walked in.  The server came immediately over and basically demanded that he order right away. \\n\\nWe get there just a few minutes later.  It's pretty empty but there are definitely people there drinking.  In hindsight it might have been the bartenders' friends that were there - it certainly felt like the whole place against us.  As soon as we walk in the female bartender yells \\"LAST CALL!\\" - in and of itself this was not offensive to me, but a) it seemed to be a response to our walking in, and b) it was done is a really abrasive, almost angry fashion.  All the staff similarly greeted us with stone-cold stares.  We were Not Welcome.  \\n\\nThe server walks over with sister's boyfriend's beer, which is about 2/3 full.  Apparently he got the last of whatever beer that was.  The server asks us in a flat voice, \\"do you want to order something.\\"  By that time we had decided to just get out of there.  Sister's boyfriend was like, \\"we'll just take the check for this.\\"  He said \\"it's on the house.\\"  Nice?  I guess?  Because it was 2/3 of a beer and he really wanted us to get the hell out of there?  But I tend to factor in soft factors to \\"cost.\\"  That experience was unpleasant enough to cost us well more than the price of that beer.\\n\\nI was a little oblivious to the whole thing because frankly, rude staff can bite me.  I was sort of inclined to order something really cheap and stay there for a really long time.  But my sister was upset by it, and it kind of ruined her night.

I could eat here twice a day, every day and never get tired of it. I've eaten here on average 9 times per month over the last 1.5 years. I enjoy that you don't have to choose what to order, you just get what they are serving (soup, salad, grains, beans, blanched greens, something pickled, and an entree like a taco or steamed veggies). The lunch menu changes to something completely different at 5:30pm. You can check what they are currently serving on their website. They always have Tacos for dinner on Thursday which are amazing. Their suncheese condiment is also off the chain, so be on the lookout for when it's on the menu. Some people might say $12 is expensive, but when you take into account that tax is included and you don't have to tip then a comparable restaurant price would be $9 and change. Not to mention that you get a ton of food that's vegan and organic. I always leave stuffed but feel so good about what I put in my body. If you come frequently enough, buy a gift card for $150 and get $162 worth of credit (a free meal, essentially). I love the hibiscus tea (nile valley brand) and their salads are usually awesome (they use nuts instead of oil).

Unless you go down during the day from Monday to Friday, you WILL have to pay around 8 bucks to park in paid parking, then have to hike to the shop, so plan your trip accordingly.

The atmosphere is fun. The employees are helpful and the cigar rollers are awesome to watch. Being able to walk in off 6th street and have a good cigar and a cup of cuban style coffee to regain your balance while hanging out at night is very relaxing. The cigars themselves are quite good. Bobalu's only sells their own brand of cigars, but they have a style and strength to fit anyone's tastes. I really enjoy their double maduro sticks, and they have a buyers club that costs 50$ a year which entitles you to half off the price of any cigar with no number restrictions. Want 40 cigars? Each cigar is half price. This makes it worth the parking hassle, in my opinion. They also have later hours than other Austin area cigar shops, which is nice if you are having a long day at work and want to sit down and have a good smoke before heading home. They also offer all their inventory for sale via their website.

The pita bread was a good solid delivery vehicle for the luscious mixture.  And my wife and I both had a Malbec win -- modestly priced and a delicious accompaniment.  She ordered vegetarian moussaka.  She told me it was superb.  It was surely beautiful to look at.  I had the chicken kabob with vegetarian rice (to avoid the onions).   Well presented, succulent and crisp on the outside healthy chunks of chicken with grilled peppers and tomatoes.  A delicious dish.  A lovely salad came with it -- full of feta and extra crisp cucumbers -- along with the lettuce and tomatoes you'd expect.

I know there are some pho purists out there who refuse to deviate from beef broth and consider anything else as some insulting sort of imitation. However, for those of us who love the concept of pho but hate eating animal, vegetarian pho is a godsend. And Pho Gia makes one amazing bowl of veggie pho. Stocked full of vegetables (some you wouldn't expect but they all work, trust me), noodles and tofu in a five spice broth, this bowl will fill that hole in your heart. \\nMy novio ordered the meatball and beef flank bowl and was equally enamored.\\nThe bowls are huge yet inexpensive. The service is incredibly quick- I couldn't believe how quickly the food made it out to our table. The waitstaff is also very friendly and accommodating. \\nI also ordered the veggie spring rolls and a thai iced tea. The spring rolls were simple but delicious. The thai iced tea was a bit on the sweet side, but a decadent beverage nonetheless.\\nI am excited to come back to try more options! \\n\\n\\nOh, one side note- this restaurant is a bit schizophrenic in its decor. Apparently inspired by greco-roman art, be prepared to slurp noodles while listening to classical European music and looking at grape covered trellaces, vatican inspired sculptures, some fancy columns incorporating Greek Gods, Ralph Waldo Emerson quotes, and 19th century European artwork.

We didn't like the way they cooked the steak (not talking about temperature). When you cut into the steak it was a bit rubbery.... usually when you cut steak it's first crispy from the fat layer and then tender from the meat. The roasted forged mushroom dish was okay... a bit chewy and cold. The creamed spinach was too creamy (like how right?) yet bland.

I drove in and immediately went to the left as there were no signs or arrows anywhere - I discovered that it was actually one-way, but I was still able to park and I completely avoided the valet.  I hate valet (particularly when it is pointless like at their location) so that was a bonus actually.  \\n\\nFour of us went without reservations on a Wednesday and were seated with no problem.  The restaurant is nice enough - modern/industrial feel, fancy but not too stuffy.  \\n\\nI had part of an appetizer special: chorizo-stuffed calamari with mussels and a garnish frisee salad with peppers.  The calamari & chorizo part was decent, but nothing particularly special.  The mussels were just randomly thrown on the plate and didn't contribute to a cohesive dish.  I don't normally eat mussels, but I made an exception this time and was reminded why I don't eat them.  This was pretty mediocre.  \\n\\nI didn't really see anything on the main course menu that really appealed to me at that moment so I opted to get 2 starters instead: the lamb lasagna and the Brussels sprouts & apple salad.  The lamb lasagna was really good - hearty flavor, nice bit of cheese.  I definitely recommend this one.  The Brussels sprouts were a bit of a letdown.  They were still very crunchy.  It might have been better if they were quartered instead of halved.  The outer part was crispy as advertised though.  Unfortunately, the apple part of the \\"salad\\" was virtually non-existent - the small, paper-thin slice or two of apple in between each large Brussels sprout was merely a garnish at best.  I couldn't really taste the apple much at all.  They definitely need to have more apple in that dish because it really is just sliced Brussels sprouts on a plate covered in criss-crossed sauces.  The sauces were pretty bland and it was definitely a form (nice-looking plating) over function (taste) deal with those.   \\n\\nAlso, I know someone mentioned this already but I have to comment on the silverware as well.  While they are kinda cool to look at, they have a tendency to slide off plates due to their design.  It happened to me and I was even aware of the possibility of it happening since I remembered those comments about it before.  Luckily, I caught it before it hit the ground.   \\n\\nService was decent enough but the guy seemed a little new and uncertain.  Also, they somehow lost the signed receipt I left in the booklet in the 2 minutes between my getting up, going to the restroom and leaving the restaurant.  Everyone saw me sign it and leave it in the book.  Not a big deal but kinda annoying as I had to go back and resign.    \\n\\nOverall, it was ok.  Sure, the restaurant had form (upscale d√©cor, unusual silverware, crazy plate garnishes, etc.) but it lacked function - the food was disappointing with the exception of the lasagna.    I'm a function over form type of guy.  Food is first and everything else comes second - I'll take some fantastic food that's slopped on a plate by a filthy bum in a shack over the opposite any day.  This place struck me as being a little too form over function for me so it didn't go over too well.  Frankly, I'd much rather eat across the street at Repast - moderately similar cuisine, significantly better food, comparable atmosphere...\\n\\n2.5"},{"name":"Diamond Resturant","address":"8047 120 Street, Unit 160","city":"Delta","stars":"3","text":"4 stars:\\n\\nSuper cheap, super greasy.

The food was decent, but the service was pretty bad.  Since it's inside a nice hotel on Universal property, I expected to service to be excellent.  It should be after spending so much money in their parks, restaurants, and hotels.  My father ordered a burger and he thought it was alright, but nothing special.  The only vegan option was their chicken and fruit salad without the chicken.  I just love paying extra for chicken that I don't receive. \\n\\nI love beer and pubs so I thought this place would be awesome.  They advertise a flight of beer with 4 tastings.  I ordered this and the server looked at me like I was from Mars.  I guess it's not ordered that often?  It's an American pub that advertises the beer tastings, so it shouldn't have been a problem.  I had to explain it to her and then repeat my four beer choices about 5 times.  Just annoying.\\n\\nThe server was nice enough, but she was painfully slow.  I didn't want her to leave because I knew we wouldn't see her for a while.  It took forever just to see her the first time.  She was MUCH too chatty with us.

And this handpicked deal was a great value--we would have paid $75 for all of that food and only ended up paying $40 + tax. If it comes around again, grab it!\\n\\nOnto dinner: we started with an antipasto plate which had 3 delish, creamy cheeses, bread, proscuitto & salami. With the addition of marinated artichokes & olives, this was waay huge and really, really good. I got the sweet potato & kale soup, while boyfriend got the salad nicoise. Both were very good but the soup was better. If they were selling it, i would have bought a take-home portion that night and probably ate it, if I wouldn't have been so full.\\n\\nEntrees were on par with the rest of the meal: fab. I had grilled meat loaf with an extra side of mac-n-cheese; the chef was running outta mashed potatoes and thought I needed something else (?). Boyfriend had the night special of shrimp which he said was great. By the time dessert rolled around, we needed to be rolled outta there!

I've had a few Philly's from Philadelphia and to me, this particular Philly's doesn't taste like the new age Philly that you get from Philadelphia. Weeyums reminds me of a traditional style Philly, but today, if you get a real deal Philly, you choose the cheese you want, which makes a huge difference in the outcome of the taste. To me, there are other places that can compete with Weeyums like Woody's in Atlanta who also maintain a traditional taste. \\n\\nWeeyums is not bad. By all means, if you're in the area and you want a Philly, go for it. You won't be too disappointed, but based on the reviews, I really thought that it would taste like a modern day Philly. Because Philadelphia is known for award winning Philly's, there's a lot of competition to move away from the traditional style Philly and I'm telling you the cheese is it. I was just in Philadelphia a few months ago and I tried a cheese on my sandwich that's not even sold in the grocery store and it completely made a difference in the overall taste of the sandwich. In Philadelphia, restaurants will even provide options with the type of bread you want to use and depending on the restaurant, you'll have several choices. Also, the seasoning is different. It's no longer just salt and pepper. It's a special blend with a hickory flair. Philly's are a bit different than they were back in the day. However, for all of you who like the traditional style Philly with limited options, Weeyums is cool. It took about 20 minutes to get my food and although it wasn't bad, it wasn't what I expected."},{"name":"Grindhouse Killer Burgers","address":"433 N McDonough St","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"The food is good and we really like the burgers, BUT: even when the restaurant is not at all crowded, the front register is so slow that there's a line going out the door (possibly this is the desired effect to make it look like it's really crowded).

They do have a nice heated patio but seats are not very comfortable. I had their prime rib with salad and a side. Maybe I have not been to the Keg in ages so I was mighty disappointed with their 'wedge salad'. You get served 1/4 of an iceberg lettuce topped with meagre pieces of tomatoes, bacon bits, and ranch/blue cheese dressing. Presentation fail, taste unexciting. Seems to me like someone who decided to save kitchen staff time came up with this salad. I kid you not. One lettuce cut into 4 and throw everything else randomly over the top. Very unimpressed. I ate about a third of what was served to me and pushed it away. I will have Caesar salad in the future even though I am not a real fan of that either; but the lesser of two evils I suppose. I enjoyed the prime rib however. It was medium rare and tender and prepared just the way I remembered it to be. I also had a sangria which was a little too sour for my taste. Service was mediocre, nothing to get too excited bout either way. I would go back again for the prime rib/steak but certainly will opt out of the salad.

Honestly, the crawfish deserved five stars.

That might make it sound like I don't know what I'm talking about, but I've had plenty of crawfish in my life. I love 'em!  Anyway, these crawfish were *huge*. Like little lobsters, but better!  Perfectly cooked. Perfectly spiced. (I like 'em spicy.)  Served with just the right amount of corn & potatoes - not too much; just enough. The ambience was typical Sam's Boat, and the reason I'm not giving five stars. Very busy & sports-bar-ish. Lots of corporate happy-hour-ers standing around among the tables, talking shop. It was super loud, and the wait staff was in the weeds pretty badly. Maybe a waiter/waitress or two didn't show up that night - I dunno, but they could've used a few more. We were originally seated outside (our only option for immediate seating), and the hostess warned us it might be a while til our waitress came. Well, she was right, so we finally managed to find seats at the bar and we ate there, which was fine with us.

I don't even remember what he was trying to say to convince me to order the risotto he just made, there was no way I would say no whatever he said. And the risotto was very tasty, especially the briny savoriness provided by the pork skin. There were other really good dishes- the banana pudding, the bacon egg and cheese veggie style and lastly the chicken sliders, which were the best. Mattie F. and I decided it was an elevated version of a chick filA sandwich, just like we decided that the H+F burger was an elevated version of a mcdonalds cheeseburger (this is a good thing). \\n\\nThey started serving wine and beers- $6 for either a glass of red or white (yesterday this meant solid options of tempranillo or sauvignon blanc) and $4 sweetwater 420s. \\n\\nThe fair pricing stops here though, and is the main reason I removed a star. After tax and tip, Mattie and I spent $65 each. This seemed overpriced to me for several reasons. First, the atmosphere and set up (kinda like a dim sum restaurant) feels more casual dining than special occasion. The lighting is bright and the room is loud. When I drop $65 at dinner, which is not very often for this poor grad student, I want it to feel pretty special, like it's more of an event (though arguably seeing Kevin Gillespie cook 6 feet from you can be pretty eventful). And it wasn't just the ambience that didn't feel like a $65 pp kinda place- though the meal was very good, it was not the best meal I ever had, nor the best meal I had in the past 2 months. Finally, I remember reading an article (I believe in eater atlanta, but may have been elsewhere) where Chef Gillespie explained the impetus behind Gunshow- he wanted to cook at a place where his father would perceive as more approachable and frequentable, a place that didn't charge $14 for a salad. Sadly, the small portioned salads here were in the low teens- enough for a few forkfulls. If this place cost closer to $35-40 total per person, I would give it that fifth star. \\n\\nHaving said all this, I will likely come again.  I may have missed some of the dishes with greater wow factor- They ran out of the chocolate dessert, and we were too full to have any of the fish options or the short ribs. Additionally, the service was splendid. The people working here are a great crowd and the whole space felt like an awesome casual hang out spot.

I recommend you go for the deep fried squid and the wings, don't waste your money on the other items since there are better places for that style of food (cheaper too). The wings are great! crunchy, salty, sweet, sour, and umami, usually overcooked but that's how they always have been. The better dish is the squid (imo) way less work than gnawing on a bone and way more textural fun in the mouth, it's the exact same cooking process and flavour but that subtle chew to the squid is where it outshines the wings.

He then suggested we do the royal feast dinner and dine family style. Perfect! That meant we each pay the same price, but got to try 4 dinners instead of one. The beef and lamb dishes were my favorite, but the humus was so deliciously spicy that I couldn't quit eating it. Not only did we get a chance to eat our full meals with our hands, but we got to sit on the floor while doing so. This might not be for every one, but we had a blast and felt like we'd stepped off a plane and landed in Morocco. It was truly an authentic experience. Unfortunately, we all had plans after dinner so we couldn't stick around for the belly dancer, but got to see a glimpse of the show as we were boxing up our heaps of leftovers.
