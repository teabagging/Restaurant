I then tried my lamb and was extremely disappointed. It was bland and looked nothing like the picture. It tasted like it was burned the first time it was cooked, and then seemed like it was microwaved prior to arriving at our table. The lamb was extremely tough and I couldn't stomach eating the rest of it. I left hungry and very disappointed. \\n\\nAs for the service, our server was nice enough but unfortunately not very attentive.

The fluke crudo, however was more radish than fluke, and disappointing. \\n\\nThe entrees were meh. Three of us got the lobster and ricotta ravioli. Small portion (3 ravioli), and each had something \\"wrong\\": 1 had only 1 ravioli with any lobster at all, 1 had lobster in all, but missing cheese, 1 had lobster in all but overcooked and tough. The hangar steak was cooked very well, though lacking flavor. And the pork shoulder sugo was severely lacking flavor on top of lacking pork. The pasta itself was gummy, and the sauce was bland. \\n\\nNow, this is after it took 45 minutes for the entrees to come out after the appetizers were cleared. Again, the server was exceptionally apologetic, and agreed that the kitchen needed to work faster and more efficiently. And it's not even like it was all that crowded - there were about 6 other parties dining at the same time. \\n\\nThe upside of the evening was the dessert. The amaretto cannoli were simply heaven. Cannoli shells that were more lacy caramel than traditional fried shells, lightly scented amaretto filling, whipped cream and cherries that made it complete. \\n\\nIf we had stuck to the corn soup and cannoli this would have been a fantastic experience. \\n\\nOne other note: the sommelier was very nice, though his service seemed nervous.

I don't know why my stomach reacted so badly (I mean, I've had worse), but the food just didn't go down well. Anyways, let's cut to the chase. I ordered the england chowder and the lobster roll. Chowder was creamy, but odd--I don't drink chowder soup a lot, but it tasted really weird. I hadn't eaten lunch that day, so I gulped it down, pausing every now and then to contemplate why it tasted funny and chew on some rubbery shreds of clam. Now, the big disappointment was the lobster roll. I've gotten the lobster roll at Panera a couple times, which was quite nice, so I had some pretty high expectations for a real fresh lobster roll. Unfortunately, the bread was neither fluffy nor light. It was a sad, small sandwich that fell apart into two sodden halves after my first bite. Totally not worth $18. In the end, I picked out the pieces of lobster and ditched the bread. Thought I could salvage some of it, y'know? It wasn't one of my better ideas. The lobster was tough, rubbery, and tasteless. I thought I could dip some in butter to make it taste better, but what it really needed was some salt. And less cooking time. Oh, and the fries were slightly better. Just when it seemed like they would become a ray of hope for the dish, the fries gradually became less and less appealing. They were crispy, but too oily. Moreover, they stuck together (perhaps the starch wasn't soaked out?). I gave them to my dad. Speaking of dad, I felt bad for him. He ordered the special, but it wasn't worth the hype. He was looking forward to a nice seafood dinner (a lobster stuffed with scallops and clams to be exact), but instead he got a smallish lobster with a lack of meat in the claws and a white starchy sauce that had the texture of mashed potatoes, according to him. It was relatively cheap entree ($15), but it didn't look too good. In my opinion, it kind of looked like someone had puked clam chowder on a spread-eagled lobster. I'm sorry. Mostly for my dad, but yeah, I guess I'm just going to be honest here. On the slightly brighter side, the service was pretty nice. The waitress was friendly and popped by every so often. Calamari appetizer was light and tasty. It took a long time for the meal to get to the table and for the receipt to get processed, but the view of the beached dock and boats was alright, I guess."},{"name":"Bangkok Bites","address":"7950 SE Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I love Thai food and am typically pretty picky about it.

Usually when you ask for something \\"hot\\" you get just a smidge of spicy on your tongue. But their \\"hot\\" means it! :) I loved it!

Usually I don't like Masuman Curry, but I LOVED it here! (I will add, usually Green Curry is my favorite, but it didn't knock my socks off) The Salad Wraps were beautiful presented (someone earlier said they used ice burg lettuce, but that wasn't how it was served for us) and was bursting with flavors. We really adored the peanut sauce that came with it! My husband says the Mango Sticky Rice was worth coming back for every day. :) It wasn't overly sweet and we prefer it that way. \\n\\n4. Presentation! Everything was beautifully presented and it was clear they took great care to make it so. We thought the decor was fitting and relaxing. I really loved the colors of the walls.

We had visited once before a few years ago. I think our first trip may have been closer to the busy dinner hour. My memory was that the food was decent, and there was quite a selection of seafoods and asian foods that I enjoyed sampling and they tasted pretty good. This recent trip really soured my impression. Many of the foods and both the hot and sour soup and the egg flower soup were stale or old tasting. The sashimi that was displayed was really warmed to room temperature, the texture was off and the taste was very bland. I didn't think it was still good to eat. The sushi rolls that I tried were ok, but the nigiri sushi that I tried was very stale tasting. \\nThere were some Chinese style pot stickers out, they were really offensive to me, they were filled with a greasy, grisly sausage -like stuffing much too oily and heavy and not good. They did have some Korean style beef spare ribs out. I tried one or two on my first trip around they were not bad. I made a second trip to the buffet line and got one more of the Korean spare ribs, it was totally cold and the oils or fats on the meat were congealing in a translucent glob on the bottom of the meat, not very appetizing.\\nI commented to the cashier at the counter that our foods were very disappointing he said we should have told him while we were still here, they would have done something to make sure we had fresh food. I thought that was the idea behind running a restaurant in the first place, you need to monitor the foods and ensure the quality is maintained, not let the foods get stale so that customers will be turned off to your restaurant. We will not go back here again."},{"name":"Grand Day Cafe","address":"1284 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Another excellent omelet.

Then we got the salad layonaise? (Poached egg and a tasty bacon).

Mi hubby ordered the scallops which was divine! I would definitely order those over the lamb chops. There is a side of vegetables that comes out with main entrees- I don't care if you don't like tomatoes...you have got to put it in your mouth (That's what he said)! Finished off with the creme brulee which would have been absolutely scrumptious had a quarter of the top caramelized part weren't burnt. (Every place has its good day or bad day I supposed).\\n\\nTook off two stars because the presentation of the food was really plain. Being french food lovers we were expecting an enticing presentation but that was an epic fail. The food itself gets a 4.5! The wine list was sub par..kind or surprised there weren't more choices. Service was actually confusing since 3 different servers came to the table throughout the night. Food took forever too..we were there for 2 hours on a weekday? Also the restaurant gets loud and there isn't that much space between you and the table next to you.

The man was really nice about wanting it to not be watered down, and the bartender (at the ripe old again of probably 19 or 20), sort of rolled her eyes about it.

It'd be a mistake to skip this one! First of all, the restaurant is beautiful!!! It really looks and feels like you're in the movie, but it's not all stagnant. It snows out the balcony windows, Beast is your host and you can meet him and get a picture after your meal, you're welcome to walk around and check the place out-the 2 dining areas are the large ballroom and the smaller West Wing where you will see the rose and the Beast's torn portrait, and as you exit from meeting him, you walk past the talking suits of armor! Aside from everything to look and interact with, the food is very good, and one of their desserts is the Grey Stuff!(it's delicious) It's a slightly fancier place, but still family friendly and no dress code. I couldn't care less about alcohol, but if you like to drink, they're also the only place in the Magic Kingdom to serve beer and wine. Lastly, I know they now do quick serve meals for breakfast and lunch, but if you're planning a dinner here: MAKE YOUR RESERVATION EARLY!!!

Now this side cost 4.95. For 4!! What?!?!\\n3- I am NOT ok with a line cook eating ON THE LINE COOKING....!!!! This is what we had the joy of watching, the line cook, cooking the food for the customers, EATING AS HE WAS COOKING!!!! Like WTF!?!?! \\n4- Waitress chewing gum, not discreetly, NO NO, walking around, talking to people, CHEWING GUM LIKE SHE WAS CHEWING CUD......NASTY. So must that we could almost hear it smacking in her teeth.\\n5- Now this is the topper- One of the manager was telling a waitress that there was 6 bone-in chickens left, and then SHOUTED out loud for everyone to hear \\"Unless I eat them first\\". Like, what, really???? \\nSo, this has been a very expensive, traumatic meal out, and we will not be going back. I hope they make some major changes, but I think they need to have the Health Dept pop in.

Awesome margaritas!"},{"name":"Causeway Restaurant & Bar","address":"65 Causeway St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"If you haven't checked out this hidden gem you need to. STAT. Let me break down why this place is so kick ass.\\n\\n1. Food. This is NOT your average bar food. This place serves some fricking tasty BBQ. From ribs to wings to briskets to pulled pork and more. Plus unique sides, big ass pieces of corn bread, and a pretty kickin' selection of beverages. Prices are great and you definitely get your money's worth of food and more\\n2. Staff. Laid back, friendly, and just the right amount of attentive (no checking on you every 6 seconds). I had a personal experience that puts these guys above a lot of other places. I had a gift card for $35 went in and got a meal that cost $18. When I went back to use whatever was left on the card to my surprise it showed $0. Instead of giving me a hard time like some places would the manager took me at my word and bought me dinner on him (of course I left a big tip).\\n3. Trivia. Yes! This place has a super fun and awesome quiz every Thursday at 8pm (brought to you by Geeks Who Drink). It's free to play and your team of 6 or fewer can win awesome prizes!. This is not your average bar trivia. Rounds and questions are unique, diverse, and have fun themes. The Quizmaster is fun and makes the experience of playing that much more awesome. Better yet, it takes place in the upstairs room away from the regular bar crowd.\\n\\nSo definitely give Causeway a shot. I promise it's worth it!"},{"name":"The Lion & Rose","address":"701 S Capital of Texas Hwy","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I came in for a late night outing, and it was pretty good I must say chap!

Fajitas seem relatively hard to ruin, but this place accepted the challenge.  They were weirdly saucy and not at all what you would do expect - drowning in a gelatinous sauce that was such if Asian tasting.  Enchiladas were more like taquitos...hard and crunchy. Margarita was good, but mostly ice.  Lastly, we lost our waitress for about a half an hour.  Had to ask hostess for the check. Not good on any front and expensive to boot.  Huge disappointment."},{"name":"The Hub","address":"3815 Dry Creek Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Luckily in Austin we have numerous choices when it comes to eating out. The Hub is not the only grub in town and I will definitely not be returning to this sorry excuse for a restaurant. I cannot imagine that the Hub's bland offerings and lousy service will be tolerated in this competitive climate. On this beautiful Sunday afternoon, my husband and I decided to give it a try, anticipating a juicy burger on the patio. We should have known from the beginning that this was not going to be a wonderful experience. \\n\\nWhen we walked to the back patio we passed a grungy individual looking very bored and out of place. Our host sat us down and went to get our drinks. The hobo-like character came over and our host introduced him as our server. You have got to be kidding!  It was like a Seinfeld episode, but not so funny. Our server seemed very disinterested in being upright and having to work. He took our order, brought our appetizer sans napkins. We saw a napkin dispenser on an empty table so we helped ourselves. My husband's coke was being attacked by a bee, not the restaurant's fault, we were in the bee's buzz airspace. My husband went to see if he could get something to swat it with - I asked our server for a fly swatter or something. He said he may be able to find something but he had another table that just came in and we were basically SOL.\\n\\nOur appetizer was the HUB trio: greasy tortilla chips, guacamole from a package, queso from a can and watery salsa. For our entrees,  we ordered a \\"fatty\\" burger and a BLT. When ordering, we realized later that we needed to play 20 questions with our server. I despise playing games, especially when ordering from a burger joint. My husband ordered a burger, the server asks which of 4 cheeses he wants on it. Then he was asked what side he wanted. Well, we guessed these items were part of the package deal - nope, it was $.50 for cheese, $1.00 extra for fries. My husband asked if the fries were made on site. A simple yes or no would have sufficed. The server had to talk it out, he says \\" well we peel potatoes and cut them and stuff\\".  OK, but then it kept happening. I ordered a BLT. He asked me if I wanted fries or tater tots. Hmm. Which did he recommend? He said onion rings. Not sure why I said ok - he was just trying to upcharge me, which of course he did - $2. The onion rings were not made in house, they were not crispy and not to be recommended. The fries, however, were very tasty - the highpoint of the meal really. My husband's burger was overdone, really tough. My BLT was sad, nothing special. Both were made even less special since they did not even seem to come with a side. My husband was even charged for 2 cokes, because he got a refill. Wow, $3 coke, not a common practice to charge full price for a refill, most places do not even charge for a refill. \\n\\nWe felt ripped off and there were not any redeeming qualities. The french fries were merely a glimmer of hope. We would have been better off at P. Terry's or any other mediocre burger joint. Oh well, maybe I have just had it with places like this and know that there are several other local establishments that will take my money and give me good food and service in return. What a concept!"},{"name":"Ichiban Bakery","address":"1157 Kenny Centre Mall","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"I read an article about this bakery and decided to try it out. I tried the Green Tea cake, Blueberry cake, and Japanese cheesecake. I could not believe how much I loved each type. \\n\\nWhipped topping icing is not something I normally like, but it goes perfectly with Ichiban's cake and flavoring. Light, fluffy, flavorful yet subtle. I can eat this cake without feeling bloated or bogged down, unlike a traditional western-style cake. \\n\\nThe Japanese cheesecake was amazing. It had a great taste and texture without being heavy and overpowering. The owner is very friendly and appreciative. He doesn't mind explaining exactly what you're buying so you know what to expect. I buy cake every week from Ichiban and I highly recommend it to anyone."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Let me start by saying I'm a huge Disney fanatic, annual pass holder, and someone with huge expectations of this restaurant before ever dining here. The hype this restaurant has is unreal and now that I've dined there I can honestly say it's everything and more. \\n\\nThe first time we went to Magic Kingdom I remember walking up to the gates outside the bridge and saying \\"Hi, we're here for dinner for 2\\" and they asked if we had a reservation, I smiled and said \\"no, but we don't mind waiting\\". They respectfully smiled back and informed me people make reservations on average 4 months in advance to eat there and it fills up usually the day they open reservations for days months out. I knew right then and there it was my mission to dine here, all these reservations cannot be wrong.\\n\\nAfter making reservations and checking in, we were given a buzzer to wait and waited about 10-15 minutes on the bridge for tables to open, we were then showed into the castle and given a brief tour and told that after dinner we can feel free to walk about and enjoy ourselves and take in the scenes. There are 3 main rooms, the large ballroom, beasts room, and what appears to be Belle's Room, each with their own beautiful theme. There's artwork all over the place with painted scenes and fantasies of the movie and it's everything you'd imagine. \\n\\nOnce seated, the server arrives, greets us with a Bonjour ca va. Knowing French I responded in full sentences and he knew some starter conversations and it was very genuine. I later asked if he actually spoke French he said they're taught basic conversational sentences and I really enjoyed the authenticity (somewhat like the world showcase in Epcot). He explained the menu and you can see from all the photos we took that we selected steak, another member selected chicken, green beans, fries, and French Onion Soup. It's also the only restaurant in the park you can get alcoholic beverages and full wine menu. We told the server we had an allergy and minutes later the chef came out and talked about what they do in the kitchen for guests with allergies and it was very professional and refreshing to see, that of a 5 star restaurant when the chef comes out. I'm a HUGE onion soup snob, having been to France and trying this dish everywhere I go around the country and the world I can say I've had it all. This onion soup entirely blew me away, it was fantastic, perfectly seasoned, and the blend of cheese was fantastic! The meals arrived and the steak and fries were amazing and the green beans tasted so fresh and slightly crunchy and were fantastic. The service was excellent and the experience was magical! It came time for dessert and they rolled the dessert cart over, introduced the desserts, and told us to try the grey stuff it's delicious! Of course it was delicious and the citrus eclair was also.\\n\\nAfter dinner service we wondered around, admiring the artwork, the spinning status of Belle and Beast in the center of our room we were in. We went into the main ballroom which looked straight out of the movie, we even noticed the fine detail of the windows, they were made to appear 3D and resemble actual scenery at night with snow actually falling, it was wonderful. We went into Beast's room with his portrait and the animated rose which was great.\\n\\nIt was too late for our reservation for the character dining at that hour (it told you at reservation there wasn't any at that late hour) which was fine, we were all adults. However, you still got to meet Beast. Intermittently throughout dinner the lights would dim and a voice would say our host this evening and he would go room to room and wave. Plus after dinner you got to go to the hall and see Beast and get photos with him before leaving.\\n\\nOverall, this is an absolute must on your Disney experience list! I heard so much about this and honestly I built my expectations for this so high ever before stepping foot in this and was prepared for my extremely high hopes not to be fully met, however they were not just met, they were FAR exceeded. You absolutely must dine here, it's beyond wonderful and has thoroughly impressed me beyond compare.

No problem.\\n\\nFirst, the style of the restaurant is very chic. From the valet area to the waiting area outside the restaurant, to the host stand - I was impressed. Every employee that we interacted with was pleasant. We started with drinks. No complaints. I had a skinny margarita (my drink of choice) and was pleased. My friends had some sort of strawberry drink that they loved! On to the appetizers.\\n\\nWe tried the calamari and lump crab meat mushrooms. Both were very good! I was partial to the mushrooms but I would definitely order both again. For entrees we all had either the salmon, halibut or rib-eye. I had the rib-eye and it was divine! I substituted spinach for asparagus and mashed potatoes for the baked potato. It was a healthy serving so I ended up with 3 servings. Had I not had appetizers, I would have had 2 servings. \\n\\nWe didn't order dessert because we brought a birthday cake. The restaurant was very accommodating and did not charge a 'plate fee' like other restaurants. I will try a dessert on my next visit.\\n\\nThey have live music nightly. The guy that performed was decent. He played a lot of my favorite songs and it was nice background music. He wasn't so good that he distracted us from the meal.

And while some of them don't always hit the mark (their bacon beer is far from good), most are more than decent and are varied enough to catch just about anyone's interest. From stouts and porters, to summer-style, lighter beers and even weirder ones like bacon or spearmint flavored ones.\\n\\nGoing there wasn't my choice, as I'm usually one who frequents the Gaff across the street but the group of eight of us had no troubles finding a table and getting settled down there on a not-so-busy Saturday evening. After being handed menus, we all promptly ordered our drinks and some food - for my girlfriend and I, to start, we split the boneless buffalo wings ($9.95) which were originally overcooked but then redone once we complained and came out great. The sauce was spicy and the meat was juicy and tender. It was a hit. Along with it we got a large-sized dinner salad ($7.95) which featured some mesclun greens, spiced walnuts and crumbled bleu cheese. It was very tasty and was also pretty good.\\n\\nTheir menu features daily specials - on Mondays, they have a fisherman's platter for $20 - Tuesdays has spaghetti and meatballs on there, and there's more specials for every day of the week, each handing out generous portions for a pretty good price. But despite all of those, the meal itself I think was pretty forgettable. There was no unique twist, something to let the food standout. While it was good, it just was what you'd find it every other typical bar which isn't always a bad thing... but... not original by any means.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the beers that they offer, each brewed in house are something which I originally found intriguing. I found it to be actually a pretty neat thing and the Moody Street Stout that I ordered was pretty good. It had some pretty tasty aromas of coffee, chocolate and roasted nuts and the carbonation was just perfect on it. Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised. On the other hand, I was perusing through my Yelp iPhone app and noticed in the Quick Tips that this place also served up a bacon beer - being a terrible Jew, I had to try it and although it was not advertising anywhere, I decided to ask for a sample - It was pretty.. gross. It was very smoky, almost like a Lagavulin scotch, but it tasted nothing like bacon. A giant disappointment.\\n\\nAll in all, this place is clean, reliable and serves up some interesting beers making for an enjoyable time. Plus our waiter looked like Larry David which was a plus although he was a bit overwhelmed and wasn't always very responsive. Make this a good place to grab a pint or two, not a place for dinner.

I'm not sure exactly how long this particular Applebee's has been here, but if it's an older one, then it's been very well taken care of.\\n\\nAfter 10pm, the appetizers are 1/2 price.  We decided to share everything, so we ordered the Brew Pub Pretzels & Beer Cheese Dip and the Mozzarella Sticks from the appetizer menu.  We also ordered the Fish & Chips from the dinner menu.\\n\\nI was shocked when the mozzarella sticks arrived.  I counted 9 of them in the basket and they were nicely sized.  Usually when I order mozzarella sticks, there are only 4-6.  I can't say there was anything special about them...  it was just fried cheese...  but they were nice and hot and the cheese was perfectly stringy.  \\n\\nThe pretzels and beer cheese were also good, but again, nothing special about them.  I don't normally like beer cheese because I can't stand the taste of beer at all, but this was really good as the beer taste wasn't overwhelming.  I would order this appetizer again.\\n\\nThe shining star were the fish & chips.  Wow!  The best fish & chips I've ever had are the ones at Yorkshire County Fish Shop at Epcot.  Well, the fish was right on pare with the fish from Epcot.  There were 3 pieces of fish served and I only \\"allowed\\" hubby to have one piece.

I will absolutely be back to Applebee's to order the fish & chips again!  I only hope they are as good at our Applebee's in Jacksonville.\\n\\nBecause of the 1/2 off appetizers, our check was just a little over $20 bucks.

The New Zealand Spring Lamb is high quality, very tender and the portion is generous. I'm also glad to see that they have shrimp paste (Xia hua) and beef tripe and many other hot pot items that are common in China but that you don't usually find in the US. Another big plus is that when the broth is boiled down, they add you more broth (instead of water, which is common practice in many other places). The only reason why I took off one star is that they don't have a \\"dipping sauce bar\\" like those in China where you can customize your dipping sauce. They don't even have any dipping sauce on the menu. Although they say it's because their broth is so good that you don't need any sauce, I strongly believe that sesame based dipping sauce is an essential part of any complete hot pot meal!! \\nHowever, it's still my favorite hot pot place in Boston so far!  \\n\\nI actually went there 2 weeks in a row and for the second time, I actually brought my homemade dipping sauce, which made it a perfect meal :) \\n\\nAlso, if you like lamb, try their lamb skewers.

The guacamole was very thin and watery - I wonder how much actual avocado was in that.  It still tasted good.

Maybe their niche is the brunch but I'm just kind of amazed of the quality of food that I experience here. Having grown up around Columbus, I know the midwest, but now I live in the food mecca of New York City (which also has its share of crap food, believe me), and I've always been a self-righteous food snob, but bear with me.\\n\\nFirstly, the rolls. I don't know why the commenters think the rolls are amazing but jesus, this is just overprocessed white flour and tons of sugar. I mean, they were sweet to the point they taste like a pastry of some sort. The butter is weirdly flavorless. It tastes like crisco with a little salt (seriously). Our server was super friendly, and working so hard, but rushed us along. Gave us our check before everyone was done eating. There was no line so I can see how they would want to turn a table over, but seriously, that's not okay esp when we waited over 20 minutes to get our food. Not the server's fault, but at the end of the dinner, I started to think the kitchen was full of newbies, high, or just short-handed. As well, she was (told to) push the gift cards. Twice she asked. The promo is complicated but really, you only need to ask once and you should ask before you bring the check.\\n\\nThe food.\\nMy mom ordered shrimp scampi. The server was great b/c that's not on the menu as a single entree so she just swapped the other shrimp dish with scampi style. The weird thing--the shrimp part of the order came out in two dishes at two different times, about 5 min apart. The good thing is that the server brought all the orders w/o that last dish b/c she wanted to get us served, but it was strange they couldn't cook shrimp together and in one dish (Shrimp is probably the quickest thing to cook).\\n\\nMy dad ordered the \\"famous chicken tenders.\\" I have eaten and made a lot of fried chicken. Seriously. So, take this with a grain of salt that I am a fried chicken-eatin' and making self-proclaimed expert. Chicken tenders should not be fried in the same oil or use the same batter as your fish/shellfish. It gives it a, well, fishy flavor. Yes, they were fine. They tasted like Nathan's at the ballpark. It's kind of hard to f- up chicken tenders so making them \\"famous\\" is kind of like saying you are really good at making toast. But whatever. They were moist but slightly fishy tasting.\\n\\nMy kid ordered the chicken soup (Sat soup). It was super salty. Everything was super salty. I like salt. I use a lot of salt. But salt is not a herb. It's used to make the spices come out more. This was like salt soup with chicken in it (and dark meat chicken). It was gloopy. I don't know if it had been sitting there too long, but my kid didn't really like it. My kid is one of those kids you hate as a parent b/c he is a GREAT eater. I'm going to crow a bit, but that kid can eat sushi all day, squid, I saw him pound 2 dozen steamed clams and a lobster. He likes seaweed soup, carrots, cukes, anything that isn't mush. He is 4.5. I trust him when he says he doesn't like something or doesn't want to eat it. He did like the lemonade (the homemade one which was nicely sour due to additive I wondered, and sweet).\\n\\nMy husband ordered the Western Burger(?) b/c the description reminded him of Carl's Jr. He said Carl's Jr. was better but it was okay (Reminder: Carl's Jr. is a fast food restaurant)\\n\\nI ordered the club sandwich. And I admit, I usually order the off things on the menu. Seems to be my luck. And I will admit that maybe this isn't what you order at O'Charleys, but I figured \\"how can you f- up a turkey club?\\" I use the Turkey Club as my litmus test on a restaurant b/c if you can't make a turkey club then you cannot be a good restaurant. And here you go. The turkey club came with DELI turkey (not real turkey...) and ham (no bacon). It had about 8 tablespoons of mayo that was not very good quality mayo b/c it was not opaque...kind of translucent. The bread was not toasted enough (or was it even toasted?). I had to take out the middle bread to get rid of some of the mayo which was oozing out the side. It was super salty b/c of all the deli meat and mayo in it and there was more lettuce/tomato than meat. That's just sad. AND it was $9-10! Seriously, that's what you pay in NYC for a turkey club in a diner. And it is made with real turkey and toasted bread (of your choice) and bacon. WTF. I was kind of insulted by this egregious food blasphemy.\\n\\nThe fries were actually good and they did not taste like fish.\\n\\nSaturday I would think is a busy day for eating out I'd imagine.

He runs off to the kitchen and comes back and says 5 minutes.  OK.\\n\\nThen my food arrives.  Burger and fries.  Except not the sweet potato fries I ordered - just regular ones.  OK, not a crisis.  Fries are fries.  But the SP fries are extra and after all this I'm not paying extra for something I didn't get.

Huge production ensues.  \\nMr. W: \\"No, let me bring those right out.\\"  \\nMe:  No, really, it is ok.

AND, it was not even close to my drink.  it was a latte with regular milk and chocolate syrup, to-go.  what???  i told the guy making the drinks and he showed me the receipt, which was clearly wrong.  he offered to make it over, which i appreciated -- but then he informed me that he was out of skim milk.  in fact, he was completely out of milk except for the sad dregs of a gallon of 2%.  reluctantly, i said it was okay, and he began to remake my drink.  he put the vanilla syrup IN the milk and then steamed it (do they usually do that? i feel like at starbucks they put the syrup in the cup, not the milk), and the result was some absolutely disgusting concoction.  Upon realizing he filled my cup with about 1/2 foam, he said, \\"oh, man i gotta start paying attention!\\" and started scooping it off.  impatient, i said, \\"don't worry about it\\" and took the latte back to my seat.\\n\\n3. on their signs they promise \\"free wi-fi and a comfortable place to use it!\\"  pfft.  the wireless wasn't working, and the manager said it hadn't been working all day, but that he'd \\"called the help desk\\" and that it would \\"hopefully be working again soon.\\"  not only that, but panera is either out of range or in an awkward position in relation to the free Brookline wireless (which is somehow perfectly functional at nearby Peet's, and which makes Panera the ultimately useless place to do any work/studying).\\n\\n4. their food itself is okay.  i think the half-and-half meal is a good idea and a relatively good deal, but holy crap -- don't read the nutrition facts unless you want to hate yourself for the rest of the year.\\n\\nthe only thing that bumped this review up from 1 to 2 stars is the idealistic hope that this place will be more enjoyable in the summer when the outdoor seating opens up, and that when available, the indoor seating is nice (fireplaces, big comfy chairs, etc).  but if you just want a place to grab a latte, chill and use the internet, don't bother."},{"name":"Chatime","address":"1545 West Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Completely over hyped and not worth the wait.

My wife had the braised pork with asparagus and mashed cauliflower. Both tasted ok, but I was hoping to be more impressed with both choice and presentation.

Let me just start off with the one positive thing about Barley's - nay, two positive things - great beer and decent bartenders. I have been here on a weeknight for a beer and it was fine. The end. \\n\\nOtherwise, this place makes me want to pull my hair out, or step on my own foot. Repeatedly. This review is for everyone else whose scene this is not. There is nothing inherently wrong with Barley's, but let me give you an idea of the dbaggery that you'll be getting into should you decide to stop in. Saturday night strike one: Skillet does not do dinner. Saturday night strike two: Knead has a 45 min wait and my lady friends and I are on a timeframe for dinner. Saturday night strike three: we end up at Barley's. \\n\\nMy friends were running a bit late, so I put us on the (ten min wait) list for a table and sat at the bar with a pale ale. It is VERY loud inside Barley's, and not in an awesome way - cacophony is probably the correct word. I was a bit overwhelmed by the Arena District/suburbanites-out-on-the-town crowd and their inane conversations, so I stared at my beer and waited for my friends. When they arrived, we were seated pretty much right away, which was nice. \\n\\nThe food here reminds me of a souped up, slightly-German Applebees. I ordered a bistro salad with chicken (and I just remembered, it is still in the back of my car... oops), and also ordered a to-go perogies and sausage for the boy (which he also did not eat right away and then flung into the trash at three in the morning after we got home from the bar, making some declaration that the amt of whiskey I consumed last night is loathe to allow me to recall). My friends ordered the fried sauerkraut balls for the table. I was nonplussed. I guess what I'm getting at is I paid forty bucks for food I didn't even like or eat, to be in an environment I didn't like, where I couldn't even hear my friends, who i LOVE, talking. Every time I have come here to eat, it is basically an epic fail. Oh AND - I got a $50 parking ticket because apparently the METER I parked at turned into a valet spot while I was gone... you have to be able to contest that on account of not hanging out in the douche district with any regularity and therefore not being aware of this fact, since there were no signs to indicate that this would happen, right?? \\n\\nIf you're looking for brews, sure, and maybe even apps (though I can't be certain), yeah, give Barley's a go - on a weeknight, when it's quiet and not insane and replete with people who don't get out much. Their beer is good. Eating dinner here makes me Uncomfortable, though. It's almost food for the sake of gluttony - instead of food for the sake of the culinary experience, like the places we had originally intended to go - Skillet or Knead.

I purchased one today and was totally satisfied.  I also have found my favorite $5 COMBO meal.  The order is a small chili (no cheese), a garden side salad and a plain baked potato.  If you gouge out a large portion of baked potato and only eat the skins this meal comes in at a miniscule 358 calories and is filling.

This makes it a rather perfect spot for the dinner-and-a-movie thing.\\n\\nTeatro is a bit small, reminiscent of any neighborhood joint in NYC where there is a banquette that runs the length of the wall and small tables that you really must pull out to maneuver around.  Not a huge deal but can be a pain in the ass when the place is packed.  The first thing you notice is the beautiful lighted baroque design on the ceiling.  It's really mesmerizing.  They keep the dinner music a bit loud; that combined with the noise level of the dinner guests because of the size of the place made it a tad hard to hear.  For that reason I probably wouldn't recommend it for a first date, or you'll be shouting at each other in your dating interview.\\n\\nI started with a cocktail containing Ciroc vodka and frozen grapes.  It was delicious, but deceptively strong.  I was half in the bag by the time our appetizers came.  This place bills itself as modern Italian, and I can agree with that: the menu was inventive but somewhat traditional and the variety was nice (so nice that it took us forever to decide what to eat).  The bread and garlicky bean puree served at the table were delicious.  We started with the fried zucchini and beef carpaccio.  The carpaccio was dressed with arugula and parmesan and was delicious.  The zucchini was a bit hard to eat because it broke very easily.  I can think of many things that would cause that problem, but all I can say is that I never experience it when I make fried zucchini.  However, it wasn't heavy  at all and the marinara it was served with was very good.  \\n\\nFor dinner, I ordered the ricotta gnocchi with duck confit and spring peas and my date ordered the rigatoni bolognese.  The gnocchi was boiled, which is not my preferred preparation (I like mine seared) but was perfectly cooked for what it was.  The same can be said for every element that composed the dish, but it was just okay.  Not great.  It was missing something huge and for the life of me, I couldn't figure out what that something was.  Gnocchi can be very heavy, but this was very light and thus great for the summer.  The bolognese was delicious and I kept stealing bites of it in envy.  It was leagues better than my gnocchi.  \\n\\nThe portion sizes were good and the pasta serving wasn't completely insane like it is at most restaurants in the US these days.  If you were hungry, you could certainly finish an appetizer and an entree.\\n\\nThe service people were very nice but not super attentive.  It never really became a problem, but it was mildly annoying.  I recall it taking a pretty long time for the waiter to take our dinner order because he brought my drink and then left for about 10 minutes.\\n\\nThis place books up really quickly, especially on the weekends, so reservations are a must.  There are a ton of garages in the vicinity if you're driving, and of course the Boylston Street T station is right across the road.\\n\\nOverall a good experience.

Maybe because I'm a masochist or maybe, just maybe there was still a little fire burning inside me for nostalgia sake. I wanted to give it another try and it actually did get better.

The menu has grown as well.\\n\\nMy go to dish is the chili ramen with beef.

Maybe not anymore after our last visit for our Anniversary.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, the food was outstanding and I still love the atmosphere of Frasca (if you are seated in the main area), but considering the price (expect to spend a minimum if $150 per person depending on the wine/drinks you choose), I also want the experience to be  perfect or close to perfect.  Unfortunately, It was far from perfect.\\n\\nWe had a reservation, but had to wait for about 15 minutes (fortunately there was room at the bar, otherwise I don't know where you could wait), which is fine, but, it would be nice, to offer a small (even tiny) drink while waiting for more than 15 minutes.  After all, it is Frasca, supposedly one of the best (and definitively most expensive) restaurant in Boulder.  The hostess was very nice and apologetic about it.  After a while, I ordered a cocktail, and we were seated before my husband ordered his drink (it took him a little longer to decide).  \\n\\nOnce seated (in the back room, definitively not as nice as the main restaurant area, it was very bare and chilly), my cocktail almost spilled over because the table was very wobbly.  It took us a while to get our waitress' attention, and then back to the bar (for quite some time again), until they could fix the problem.  I still had my cocktail, untouched, while waiting for my husband to get his drink, that he was finally able to order.\\n\\nBack to the table, it took once again quite a while to get our waitress attention after looking at the menus.  I was not the least in a rush, but still, we'd been at Frasca for quite some time by then, mostly at the bar :).  We were given two fixed priced menus, and since I had read online that everything was also offered A la carte, I asked for the A la carte menu.  Evidently, Frasca is pushing the set menus since no A la carte menu is available and our waitress had to go through the dishes with prices, not very sure of all of them.  In the end, we opted for one of the menus, which was fine, considering that each plate is quite small.  Sometimes even two small, even for me (really, that chocolate mousse was 4 bites at the most!!!!).\\nTo be fair, the hostess realized that the evening had not started very well for us, and after the second course, we were offered a glass of delicious wine and an amazing plate of spaghetti, which almost made us forget and forgive that unfortunate beginning. \\n\\nIn the end, yes, Frasca tried to fix that bad start, and I really appreciate it.  But there were too many things that are not acceptable for such an upscale restaurant.  To list a few of them:\\n- the restaurant was chilly, my husband had to put his coat on after a while, and a lady seated at a table next to us did the same.  \\n- The website mentions that all plates are available A la carte, but you are only offered the menus (starting at $78) The client has to request the A la carte menu which is not available printed, the waitress can more or less give you an idea of the prices if you really want to skip one of the menus. If you don't ask, you don't even know that you have an option other than one of the menus.\\n- For the first course, the waiter gave my husband my plate and I got his.  These were carelessly dropped on the table and some of the decoration even collapsed. \\n- plates were removed once we were barely done with a dish, every single time.  We felt totally rushed. I could tell though that it was just bad service, since we had reservations for 8:30, no one was expected to use our table after us.\\n- I did not expect big portions (and I prefer smaller ones), but the dessert was ridiculously small, this could almost be considered a \\"mignardise\\" or \\"amuse bouche\\" if it was at the beginning of the meal.\\n- Please check your tables, a wobbly one is not acceptable in a place where the least expensive menu is $78, it's already annoying enough when happening in a coffee shop.\\n- Waiting can happen if you have a reservation, but 15 minutes or more is stretching it.\\n- Coffee served in a cup as big as a mug, not expected in a sophisticated restaurant, and it was not very good either. \\n\\nIn the end, we loved most of the food (exceptions: the torta for dessert was good but not very refined, more expected in a trattoria, and the insalata was not very inspiring) , but after spending close to $300 for both of us, Frasca fell very short of our expectations.\\n\\nI wonder if Frasca rests on it's laurels."},{"name":"Taco Loco Mexican Grill","address":"44 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Better than Anna's, but not as tasty to this Cali girl.\\n\\nI've been craving Mexican food and Chipotle and Borders could no longer satiate these taste buds.

Let's paint a picture to explain why exactly I've changed my star rating to a mere 1 lonely star, shall we?. 1 star is horrible...I HATE giving 1 star reviews but I'm not scared to be honest. If I gave all 5 star reviews or all 3-5 for that matter, nothing I say would be accurate. Thus the star system...to be fair after all was created for this reason right? SO 1 star...thus I can honestly say after last night I will NOT go back. Period. Here's the picture I promised:\\n\\nWe walked in, of course on a cold night, and were seated within 5 mins of standing by the door. We were seated in the back again in between a table of children and another table where their parents were all sitting. The girls were in grade school, probably around 5-9 years old. I'm making a point to tell you this not because I care there are kids sitting next to me. I like kids. Hopefully I'll have some one day. But these little girls were dry humping the floor next to where we were sitting, trying to show off their latest lessons at dance class. Now... ponder this will you... yeah ok so little girls are learning this 'technique' at a school..sure. But not their educational school...no! At dance class. Of course..why am I so thick. KEEP UP! I must be so old this just disgusts me. I mean 24 is the new 50, but I digress. So the delightful little 6 year old was showing her newest moves to her mommy, who clapped along proudly to her whorish daughter. Fine. I understand times have changed and little girls are being bred to start families too early but seriously...no one stopped them. The waiters just stepped..over..them. Yeah. My fingers hurt typing this.  \\n\\nSO 40 long mins later we get our food. I honestly don't remember ordering at this point. I know I got the shrimp somehow and the hubs got a 7 topping pizza. Note-our $2.50 glasses of soda were empty for a good 20 mins at this point and no one noticed. Not to be bitchy but their soda costs way too much not to get upset when they know your glass is empty and still not finish it. On a side note..the hubs can down 4-5 glasses a night and at $2.50 he gets his money worth; I've learned to ignore this habit by now, the point being that he was unhappy so it's been noted. \\nOur food came out after the longest 40mins of my life, and it was cold. BUT before we could even say it was cold the waiter darts off, like he does 'oh so well.' The guy we usually get here is fan freaking tastic. This guy, on the other hand, needs loads of lessons on how to be a nice person before he should even try to be a server. SO glasses empty, foods cold, our view of the next tables entertainment, and no waiter in site. 50 mins now, 10 mins after getting out food we decide to just eat our dinner and just ask for the manager whenever our waiter shows up. 20mins later he comes by to pick up our plates and runs away before we could even ask him to stop. He probably heard us to but kept going. Ridiculous either way! So eventually he comes back and gives us our check and we ask to see the manager. He walks away. 15 mins later (you keeping track of the time?...we were) he's back. No manager in site. He leans in and says \\"manager's busy' and walks away. THE MANAGER IS BUSY!??!!? WTF?! I have NEVER been refused by a manager before. RED flags everywhere on this for me! \\n\\nAt this point we're freezing our butts off since this place is allergic to freaking heat and our night is shot since he took forever with our table. The manager refused us service which obviously means they don't give a flying 'f' that we were unhappy and don't care for our business. We're not exactly someone random customers either. I mean..we live right across the street (& down a little) but still..WTF!? If they treat repeat customers like this I cant imagine how they treat new ones. Absolutely pissed about this place.

It was very nice.\\n\\nThe service was excellent. The food was excellent.\\n\\nWe ordered two appetizers, the Roasted Cauliflower flatbread (with Chuna Masala, roasted Cipollini onions, lamb chopper cheese, and Mitmita Gremolata) and the South African \\"Vetkoek\\" (three house-made naan pastires filled with herb-braised rabbit, coconut-egg curry, and Durban vegetable curry).

It was tender and juicy, and just the right amount to save room for dessert.\\n\\nWe couldn't decide on only one dessert, so we got two: a milk tart, with a fig & port reduction, and a pistachio cake with cherry compote. They were both yummy and not overly sweet; the pistachio cake was made with added sugar and was perfect.\\n\\nAfter the meal, we receive two, small chocolate crinkle-cookies. Four desserts in one evening!\\n\\nI should also note that we overslept and awoke right at our reservation time. We called in to say we were arriving late, and they were still able to seat us within 15 minutes of our arrival. The hostess also expressed appreciation that we called, since they were able to juggle seating times.\\n\\nJiko is a Signature restaurant at Walt Disney World, and has a moderate dress code.

Must add hot sauce to make any flavor at all. Potatoes a bit leathery. Seem pre-cooked not fresh.\\nHot sauce green: This sauce could have been very good. It seemed fresh and had a kick to it. But sheesh it was completely unseasoned. No salt, no lime no nuthin. They told me they do that on purpose. hmmmm...not seasoning on purpose is too bizarre. \\nCarne Guisada: Where I live the Carne guisada is seasoned meat grilled and scooped into a tortilla. Onions, cilantro lime hot sauce. Taco heaven! Here it was meat that looked vaguely sauced but the meat was all soupy and brown and, I hate to say it, smelled stinky in a way that made me think twice about eating it. In fact I did throw it away. It just wasn't appetizing. I've eaten enough of this type of stuff in many cities so always trust my instinct when it says -Do Not Eat\\n\\nHow to make it better:\\nSeason your salsa! Salt is not a dangerous condiment. It brings life to the flavor of foods. \\n\\nMore fresh stuff on the carne guisada. I asked about cilantro, onions and lime. They said they had the first two but didn't include them.  \\n\\nIf you have to make the potatoes in advance at least fry them on the grill before putting them in the taco.

Dip it in honey or any of the chilli's that you order. My favorite would be the breakfast taco with chorizo. You get a hefty protein dish that is quite tasty in between a delectable freshly made tortilla. The huevos rancheros came with an extra spicy sauce in addition to the red AND green chili that I ordered it with. While still really good, the sandwich was my least favorite. Maybe because I attempted it last and was pretty full by the time I got to it. While everything was tasty, I think there was just a little too much chili on the huevos rancheros where you start losing the flavor of the individual components.

So I went back last night for free pizza with a couple friends. What could be better?\\n\\nA lot of things could be better.\\n\\nUnfortunately the issue with their pizza apparently was not just that night. It is just the pizza sucks. Flat out sucks. Sucks balls. Monkey balls. It's just absolutely terrible pizza. And the menu is dumb to.\\n\\nSo what's the name of this place? Oh that's right, it's Bostone PIZZA. It's not Bostone subs and pizza. It's not Bostone calzones and subs and pizza. It's Bostone PIZZA. So let me ask you, where's the pizza menu? It's not on the wall where the subs and calzones are mentioned. There's no pizza menu at the tables. There's no pizza menu at the counter. There's no pizza menu. Period.\\n\\nI walk in and present my coupons for my 2 slices of free pizza and my free 16 inch pizza. \\"What toppings do you offer for the 16 inch?\\" I asked. \\"Cheese\\" was the answer. \\"Really? Nothing other than cheese? No mushrooms, sausage, pepperoni... nothing?\\" \\"No just cheese.\\" \\"OK I guess I'll take cheese.\\" And then I asked \\"do you have any slices other than the Sicilian pizza?\\" \\"No.\\" \\"What about toppings other than pepperoni?\\" \\"No.\\"\\n\\nAnd there you have it. A \\"pizzeria\\" that serves... just cheese pizza. And slices offering such variety as.... only pepperoni. I mean seriously, come on! How lazy and crappy can you possibly make a pizza joint? No peppers? No onions? No mushrooms? No sausage? What in the world is this, Lazy Ass I Suck Boston Pizza?\\n\\nOK so maybe it would be REALLY GOOD cuz they only do one thing???\\n\\nNo. It sucked. Here's how it sucked. The Sicilian pizza was gummy and flavorless, just like last time. Oh wait, it was GREAZY too. Let me add more GREEEAAAZZZZY to that.\\n\\nNow the 16-inch pizza came (which took at least 20 minutes, and it was an empty night, whereas most good pizza places I've eaten at take 15 minutes busy, and 7 minutes when it's quiet). It was big, it looks appetizing (for being just cheese). But wait, first I had to grab about 4 napkins PER SLICE to wipe off ALL THE GREEEAAAAZZZE. I mean seriously, soak the napkin see through kind of grease. First bite and..... where's the pizza? The crust was limp, falling down like a skin flap. Even when I folded it the grease seeped through and made the crust soggy. Oh and the grease, it added no flavor. The cheese tasted like crappy Kraft cheese. And it was barely a pizza. I mean I couldn't imagine getting the cheese any thinner, and the crust any less substantial. I ate dinner with 2 girls. So 2 girls 1 guy, 2 slices of Sicilian pizza and a 16-inch pizza. And we were so hungry on the way home we bought a bag of Sunchips and Sour Patch.\\n\\nAnd the Sunchips and Sour Patch were the best meal of the night.\\n\\nBostone Pizza, you have impressed me with just how terrible a Newbury Street food place can be. Primo location, you're suckering everyone who walks through the door. It's not pizza. It's crap.\\n\\nIf you want better pizza, order Domino's. At least that way you'll have it within 30 minutes AND it'll taste better.

It was very filling and not very memorable so I would skip it unless you're into this sort of thing. 3.7/5.\\n\\nMillion dollar roll: My companion ordered this. Standard imitation crab filling with fish, crumbs, and a Siriyacha mayo dressing on top. Maybe blander than I expected. More of an Americanized dish which is fine but not what I typically enjoy. 3/5.\\n\\nCold soba with uni: The uni was amazing! 5/5. It was prepared properly. The portions were generous and it tasted like the sea. Not a hint of a metallic aftertaste. The soba itself was actually the limiting factor of the dish. It was very aldente and the dipping soup it came with was lackluster. The saving grace was the uni.\\n\\nThe service was great! But the tables were really sticky.

First, make sure you have deep pockets and a shallow belly bc this is a very expensive dinner that you should not arrive hungry for. That being said, my review is based on the food, the service and the ambiance. \\n\\nI was the last to arrive for dinner and informed the hostess that the rest of my party was already seated in the Hennesey room. She looks me up and down and points with her elbow no less, to the back of the restaurant and says the room is that way. That immediately made me upset. First off, you're a hostess. Your main job duty is to show people to their seats, not just make an ambiguous gesture towards the back which is where the kitchen is bc this is obviously not a seat yourself type of establishment.\\nWhen I made an agitated throat clearing sound and ask, where? without budging, she sighs and starts walking without instructing me to follow. Halfway down the floor, she tells me over her shoulder that the room is already full and if I wanted to have dinner there, they will need to pull up a chair as if that in and of itself was me asking her to move the world. \\nHer attitude already was wanting me to call management. Of course I wanted to sit there and have dinner, my party was already there! She was rude, and just seemed like another customer that night was not on her to-do list.\\n\\nThankfully, I was shown into the room and there was already a chair for me and the waitress was so much better which saved the night. \\n\\nSince my party had already ordered, I glanced at the menu quickly and decided on the oysters for starters and the lamb as my main. Most of my dinner mates had decided on the dumplings so we shared a few bites from each others plates. There were about 4 pcs of oysters on my plate. Although tasty, nicely cleaned and cooked they just seemed so lonely on such a huge plate.\\n\\nMy main was ok. I got 3 pieces of lamb, medium cooked but they were very inconsistent. The first piece was tough, I really had to lay into my knife to cut off pieces, but the second was so tender that my knife glided thru like it was butter and yet the third piece was also tough. \\n\\nSpeaking of butter, I liked that the butter offered with your bread (choices are wheat, cheese and rye) was room temperature, creamy and unsalted.\\n\\nService was pretty top notch, with the servers and the busers coming around frequently to top off glasses (wine, water & Henney). They even offered a glass of Henney with dessert which I had to decline since a) Henney gives me a migraine and b) I was driving that night.\\n\\nFor dessert, I decided on the pound cake and SO ordered the doughnuts which were the popular item of the night as 4 other guests ordered it as well. My pound cake was good, a bit dry but it went well with the blackberry jam and vanilla bean ice cream. It wasn't overly sweet, but I could only have a few bites before throwing in the towel. I feel like the jam had way too much seeds and I couldn't keep eating it and being discreet while pulling seeds from my teeth.\\n\\nWhile walking out, a different hostess was validating everyone's valet tickets and you can hear the live band (which consisted of a singer and 2 string players) playing in the patio. If I do come back, I would like to sit out there under the lights!\\n\\nIf it weren't for the awful hostess that dampened my mood as soon as I stepped foot inside Atlas would have received 4 stars.

Yes the staff was very welcoming and attentive, but it really didn't make up for the average Ph√¥ and rundown setting. Not to mention we were the only ones there during our whole meal (which could have been an indication to the status of the restaurant).

After waiting for 10-15 minutes for attention at our table, we ordered fajitas and fish tacos -- simple, basic, likely delicious. I mean, how can these not be delicious at a Mexican restaurant? The tacos were somewhat soggy and largely tasteless. The fajitas were just boring. No sizzle, no spark. A few shells, somewhat chewy meat, and less-than-fresh veggies. \\n\\nPrices were fine and service, when we got it, was friendly.

But.  Oh. My. Gosh.  Pepper Box Cafe serves up authentic New Mexican food!\\n\\nWe got there right at 11am on Mother's Day Sunday...the line was back to the door, and all the tables were full.  I almost decided to skip it, but the line was moving steadily, and the tables were starting to clear, so we stayed.  I'm glad we did.  \\n\\nI was eyeing the big menu over the counter with mild suspicion....pastrami?  In New Mexican food?  And what the heck is 'chipotle crema'??  But then I got up to the cash register, and noticed a little board with specials on it...and there were enchiladas.  \\n\\nWell, enchiladas are my base-line for NM food.  I always order them at any new restaurant (any new restaurant in NM, that is, where I lived four of my five decades) .  If you mess up enchiladas, you can't make NM food.  So I ordered them.  And I ordered red chile...because it is VERY easy to screw up (and also because I'd ordered carne adovada, and putting green chile on carne is just....wrong. Wrong.)  Green chile is easier to make...but if you can make a good red chile, then you can probably make good New Mexican food.  That's my opinion, others may differ...the 'red vs green' camp is alive and well in NM, although my experience is that natives and semi-natives tend to prefer red, tourists and new comers tend to prefer green.  Lest there is outrage over that statement, note that it is just my observation and experience, and statistical deviations do occur.  There are other cultural variations as well...more red in the winter, green in the summer...more red in the north, green in the south...et cetera. \\n\\nAnyway.  \\n\\nWe got a table and waited a few moments.  Then the plates hit the table....a big stack of enchiladas, a pinch of salad, a spoon full of beans, and all of it swimming in red chile.  It looked just like a plate of food at Barelas, or Monica's, or Garcias, or Monroes, or even the old Los Cuates.  (all of those are restaurants in Albuquerque).\\n\\nThen the taste test....BINGO.  Red chile, dense and complex.  AHHHHHHHHH.....\\n\\nThe carne was outstanding - meltingly tender, and plenty of it.  The beans were delicious.  The egg (right, I forgot to mention that - fried egg on enchiladas, very NM) was perfect.  \\n\\nMy companion had thought to order two sopapillas, and I was glad of it.  Often, people put honey on or in them, and eat them like a dessert (and it does cut the heat, if chile is a bit too hot for you).  But an even more appropriate cultural use for sopapillas (or extra tortillas) is to tear little pieces of them off and use them to sop up chile and as a 'pusher' for your food. We did that thing. \\n\\nI'm holding the five star review for after I've had an opportunity to visit again and try a few more things, like the migas, and the green chile cheeseburger.   And here are a few observations/critiques/suggestions:\\n\\nThe sopapillas were good, but dense, chewy, and round.  Usually when you get them in NM, they are very light and flakey, and triangular in shape.  These were more like....well, kind of like quick-fried flour gorditas.  It worked, but...\\n\\nAn easy way for the restaurant to up the authenticity factor even more would be to ask \\"Onions? or no?\\" for enchiladas.   Easy to dice white onion small, and sprinkle it in or on enchiladas. \\n\\nI didn't see sour cream as a side you could order, but it is often eaten with chile, especially red chile.  \\n\\nAnyway, I'll definitely be back.  Panza llena, corazon contento....and I can get my fix without having to 1) Drive to NM, or 2) Whine to my mom to mail me dry ingredients and make it all myself.  Although I've promised some co-workers a NM feast around Christmas time....maybe I'll take them to Pepper Box instead.  *lol*\\n\\nOh, one more thing - a reviewer before me was complaining that there was \\"too much red sauce\\".  Dude.  It is NOT red sauce, it is red chile.  Or green chile.  Always spelled with an 'e' on the end.  And if you just drizzled it on and set that plate down in front of someone from Albuquerque (or Pojoaque or Las Cruces or Chimayo) they'd look at you like \\"uhhhhh....where's the chile....\\"  But it's fine to ask for 'easy chile' or ask for it on the side.  :)"},{"name":"Xinh Xinh","address":"7 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"You know what?

No. It is, however, a DECENT place to get food when you're hungry, you've been stuck and traffic for a while, you just checked into the hotel, and you're trying to avoid getting back into the chaotic traffic of I4. It's not cheap and the dinner sounds better than the lunch options (just my opinion). \\n\\nI just ate there because the idea of getting back on I4 gave me a headache. The food was good. I ordered the Bistro Chicken and it was pretty good. The portion was smaller than I was expecting but it wasn't bad. Whatever was on top of the chicken was the best part! If it hadn't had that on top, the chicken would have been boring. They say it's grilled but it was kind of rubbery. Maybe broiled? But not terrible! \\n\\nThe worst part? The staff just didn't seem nice. I sat at the bar and the bartender barely said anything to me. Then, when I asked for my check and tried to use the 20% discount the hotel gives you when you stay, he kind of copped an attitude and said \\"You can only use it once. You can't use it everytime\\". Confused, because it was my first time ever eating here, I told him this was my first night at the hotel and he said,\\"Can you prove it?\\" I didn't know I needed the little card they gave me when I checked in (that was my fault) , and I told him I could give him the room number, last name, and ID( I even had my room key on me)  but he sternly said \\"No. You can't do that. It doesn't work that way\\". He then kind of quickly got my check and handed it to me... I then found out I could have just charged it to the room... I'm not mad about not getting the discount, but he was very rude about it.\\n\\nIn my opinion, if you are a family on vacation, I don't recommend eating here with little ones because it's just not worth the money.

The Malva pudding was a bread pudding and paired with the lemon curd was yummy. My favorite was the Pot de Creme with the almond Creme. If you're a chocolate lover you can't pass this one by.

The soup was pretty good though, but the bulgolgi was a little upsetting.  I probably should have ordered beef instead, but nonetheless, it basically just tasted bland and spicy.  I've heard a lot of hype over Korean meats, but this place was probably just a bad choice.  Overall, the meal was satisfying, but the bill came out to be like $50, and even though the portions are large, soup and two mediocre entrees just didn't feel like it was $50 well spent..."},{"name":"Sweet Carrot","address":"1417 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I have conflicting feelings about this place.

The alarm proceeds to blare for 5+ minutes until the fire department shows up to turn it off.  During this time, our waiter came back (again without my drink, which I REALLY could've used given the circumstances) and took the last couple drink orders.   He delivers all but two drinks (again, not my drink).  We ordered guacamole, which they didn't make table-side (I thought this was Papagayo's shtick?

But get this - the food took maybe 10 minutes to come out!  Now, I'm not typically a pain in the ass if the bar is clearly busy, but they kept continuing to bring other drinks out without even acknowledging the fact that I was sitting there without, even after my group mentioned it multiple times.

Carrot cut into a little heart atop the rice was a cute touch! Date's chicken basil thing was satisfying, but he kept stealing pieces of my potatoes and veggies.\\n\\nWe were there on a Wednesday night, and when we arrived at 6:30, only one other table had people.

Time flies when you're having fun!  Let's celebrate and find a place that's tucked away and many times found by those who seek good paella...FINO.\\n\\nSharing is caring and here is a place that's all about small plates and tapas.  We tried the fried goat cheese, which were lightly fried balls that came with pieces of crackers and breads for dipping.  Scrumptious!  My date preferred dipping with the crackers since the bread was a little cold.  The swirls of honey and red onion jam paired with the fried cheese nicely.\\n\\nBeing no meat Friday for me, the next plate was also a dairy & veggie one, called filo cigars with spinach & feta.  It came three to a plate like the fried goat cheese.  These filo cigars looked exactly like Vietnamese eggrolls.  Small, with a crispy tan and topped with a dollop of lemony yogurt and bits of green olives and feta.  So good!     \\n\\nAnd the finale, the seafood paella.  When it came out, my visuals quickly communicated to my tummy that the medium sized pan of  seafood buffet before us was not going to be enough for two.  We squeezed the lemon over the whole pan and discovered mussels, shrimps, calamari, and peas bedded over slightly red rice.  The size of the short-grain rice reminded me of Korean rice.  It had the tomato-saffron flavoring and some of the rice had a crispy taste due to it being pan cooked but not burnt.  The lemon aioli sauce gave a creamy texture to the dish, and it was prepared with a balanced amount that didn't overpower the seafood taste.  Only downsize to the dish, very minute detail was that the chef oversprinkled the salt.\\n\\nOverall, the pan of seafood paella was more than enough!  And for our first paella experience, we enjoyed it very much!  Our curiosity for paella came from watching Bobby Flay's paella throwdown and finally been somewhat quenched by FINO.  I'm more of a seafood girl than anything else, so I don't think my seafood quest will ever be completely subdued.  \\n\\nBy the way, I might have picked the wrong dessert because the zucchini cake was a bit hard and cold.  Oh well, every now and then you must try something different even if it's a veggie cake.  Yet, that doesn't make up for the sub par dessert.\\n\\nI would like to return on a warmer day and share the many other plates on the menu.  There's a nice patio and also lounge chairs outside the restaurant overlooking the quiet neighborhood nearby.  Looks ideal for a loungy happy hour of sipping and sharing.\\n\\nI'm so overtaken by the meal, that I almost closed off without mentioning FINO's service was prompt and friendly.

I was delighted to find an Italian menu that was so different from what I had been used to.  The chef is very successful in creating tasty AND light Italian fare that is creative but not overly complicated.  We ordered the pole bean and rabbit salad, wagyu beef tongue (OMG....), melt in your mouth potato gnochi, swordfish, quail, and an absolutely scrumptious pork leg.  I loved the integration of seasonal fruit into most of the dishes which really provided that lighter touch to the palate.  Didn't have dessert so no comment there.  Solid wine list.

The clam bakes were $29 and was worth every penny and helped offset the small portions of the other meals. The sauteed scallops were cooked perfectly but at $29 it came with only 3 scallops and a sour quinoa mixture. The worst one was the swordfish tacos for $26. It came with beans and cheese, rice, 2 tiny pieces of fish on soft tacos. The fish tasted fine but honestly it was looking at bite size twix bars. If I do come back we would only get the clam bake.

We also ordered a side of their famous macaroni and cheese. It was deliciously cheesy.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I started to get kinda full from all the delicious starters and had quite the challenge to finish my entree! I went with the very popular maize-crusted corvina, which is essentially a cornmeal crusted fish. It was prepared perfectly and paired with a delicious creamy tomato and butter sauce and crisp vegetables.

She said they were the best short ribs she has ever had. I took a bite and would not argue with her.

One one side was their Kenyan coffee creme brulee topped with koeksisters (or little donuts), and on the other was their white chocolate cheesecake.

I don't know if it's the cut/quality or what but that steak was sooooo chewy. We've been to other more affordable places where the steak was 10x better than that. Heck, anything was better than that sorry piece of meat. That was disappointing to say the least. Had he not reminded a server (not even our waiter because we couldn't find him), he would've never gotten his spinach (which came when he was almost done with his chewy steak).

Let me help you with that!  Check out this turkey burger from @gobblegobble_atx It is called the #gobblegobble because you have to gobble it up and well... you know what the turkey says!  It's a simple and original menu offering up a lean, turkey burger mixed with organic vegetables (namely red bell pepper-  think turkey/veggie burger)  topped with arugula and @antonellischz White Cheddar Cheese.  It's topped with lemon pepper aioli and served between a fresh locally sourced #brioche roll.  Mine was served up with organic seasoned potato rounds, and fabulously seasoned crisped Brussels which are served with a creamy homemade buttermilk dill sauce. (I don't usually like dill in anything but in this sauce it compliments rather than overpowers). They are very proud of their one of a kind turkey burger.  #ficklefact:  Overall this is another one of the many and wonderful family run businesses that uses a secret family recipe. So you will not get this burger anywhere else.  They also have the #moomoo.  All of the ingredients on it are also locally sourced, fresh and organic and the beef is grass fed.  I'm showing this with their homemade potato rounds and a yummy @uprivercacao.  Can you just see the vibrant health in this meal?? Check them out in the warehouse district at the two hundred block of @southcongressatx (is that still south congress?  No but you should still go there after you get your burger!)

My only complaint was on my last visit the ginger sorbet was not smooth, but rather, had almost pea sized ice pellets. Something went awry when they made it because ice crystals should not be in a sorbet like this. The owner was so incredibly gracious to my friend that I could not possibly say anything in that moment. I did very willingly give my dessert away though as I just didn't enjoy it.

Let me begin at the start when I called to make a reservation for four, only to find out that they only accept reservations for five. The man I spoke to on the phone assured me that since it was a Thursday evening and not a weekend, I did not need a reservation and could just \\"walk right in.\\" Well, this did not prove to be the case, as the entry way was crammed and we ended up waiting over 40 minutes for a table. That is all fine, to be expected, I presume, but I was certainly mislead on the phone. \\nNext, the service. When we finally got seated, we waited for about 10 minutes for a server to come to our table to receive our menu choices. We were not even greeted, nor asked if we wanted any other drinks other than water, which surprised me. \\n\\nThe food came, and was satisfying. The hot pot experience was fun and the food was well displayed. Despite this, our server did not come to check on us until we flagged him down to notify him that our broth was nearing the bottom and some of the food in the pot was actually burning as a result of it. After that near crisis was attended to, we did not see our server again until we flagged down another server asking for the check. When we submitted our cards for payment, it took over 15 minutes for us to get the attention of yet ANOTHER server to take our cards for payment and even another 10 to get them back. Overall, the experience was stressful and we as a group felt rather neglected. I am very understanding of how busy they were when we got in, but I do not feel there is any excuse for a waiter to be so negligent.\\n\\nThe food was good, but the experience as a whole was a little more than disappointing. It is hard to say if I will return."},{"name":"Spice Modern Steakhouse","address":"407 E Central Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"I'm pretty new to the Orlando area and this has become a favorite. service was great and so was the food, my bf also got a cucumber vodka drink that was amazing. they also have inside and outside seating right on the edge of Lake Eola."},{"name":"Henri's","address":"2026 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Nailed it!\\n\\nAre you kidding me?

So this is THE place to be folks. \\n\\nI love Henri's and you will too."},{"name":"Frasca Food and Wine","address":"1738 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Let me start off by saying I would have given 3 1/2 stars if Yelp allowed it.  \\n\\nFrasca is good, don't get me wrong, and the service is nearly always impeccable (minus an occasional upturned nose from the sommelier when I ask for a wine under $50).  And it is expensive, which is to be expected from the kind of pedigree Frasca boasts.  \\n\\nThe problem with Frasca, and the reason why I would knock off 1 1/2 stars, is the entrees.  Unfortunately the most important course is disappointing, especially after the act it follows.  But let me get back to that in a minute.  Or how about this, I'll just take you through a meal like I usually do.\\n\\nYou enter the restaurant through heavy velvet curtains into a fairly petite rectangular restaurant (but don't worry they are relocating).  The  quaint bar to the right (superb cocktails by the way), white-cloth tables scattered in front.  You will be greeted by an extremely kind, and beautiful hostess who already magically knows things about you.  She will take your coat, and as your cheeks warm from the blistering Boulder air (I assume its winter), you are gently guided to your table that is set up as you requested, the two places facing the restaurant so you and your guest can view the others enjoying their meals, together.  \\n\\nAct 2, the food:\\nOrder the salumi plate.  Sliced fresh every evening, you get four impeccable cured meats, these fantastic \\"grissini\\" to wrap the meat around and dip in a handmade horseradish crema.  Believe me, if you knew what they went through to make this crema, you'd walk right up to the man slicing the meat (he's the one that made the crema) and thank him immediately.\\n\\nGet the Frico Caldo!  Imagine the best cheesy hashbrowns you've ever had, and then imagine something 3 times better.  'Nough said.\\n\\nNow we get to the Antipasti.  Yes some are decent, and some are disappointing.  I say skip it.  Go to the pasta.  The meal will peak at the pasta.\\n\\nThe pasta:  you really can't go wrong, but if you like gnocchi, Lachlan has found a way to make them melt in your mouth instead of being chewy.  If you want heaven in your mouth, go with the filled pasta of the night, be it tortelloni or ravioli, it will knock your freakin' socks off.\\n\\nThe entrees: best avoided.  After what you've just experienced with the expertly crafted hand-made pasta, you WILL be disappointed.  If you are still hungry, order another pasta.  Trust me.\\n\\nDessert: For an experience of dairy-free creamy sorbet, get it.  You'll swear its ice cream, and damn good ice cream.  \\n\\nSo, to recap, if you go, get the wine, its fantastic, the salumi, the frico, and 2-3 pastas.  And if you have a sweet tooth, the sorbetto I believe its called.  And while some say this restaurant deserves national attention, if you ask me, with those entrees, it wouldn't survive long in the city*. \\n\\n*reference my Chopsticks review"},{"name":"No.1 Beef Noodle House","address":"4741 Willingdon Avenue","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3.5","text":"My two buddies and I came here on a Sunday night for some takeout bbtea. \\n\\nIt looks great inside!

The sad part was that they would only allow a maximum of nine people to order the omakase in our party of 17, but I got to try most items because my SIL wasn't feeling great and kept giving me her leftovers.\\n\\nWe ordered a bunch of items off the a la carte menu and they were all quite delicious.  I especially enjoyed the tuna tataki and the mini udon, but it was all very nicely prepared.  The vegetable tempura was light, flaky and not at all greasy, the yakitori was flavourful and the fish was all extremely fresh and of very high quality.\\n\\nI would like to give Kimura a five star review, but their service was slow and disorganized.  I might have chalked that up to our large group, but it seems to be the case with even small parties.  The wait staff was very nice, but things seemed to come out in the strangest order.  Omakase items arrived quickly in the beginning but then very slowly at the end of our visit, well after the a la carte orders were totally complete.

I've eaten at west African and Ethiopian restaurants and can see how the buffet is trying to emulate such foods.

The sandwich was difficult to eat, as there was a lot of stuff on the roll that kept falling out, but man it was so good! I also got a golden crema latte (I think that's what it was called?) and an oatmeal cookie to go. I had read reviews about this latte, but it just wasn't quite what I was expecting. I think I would skip it next time. The cookie wasn't quite as good as I wanted it to be, but nothing bad-- just not amazing (except for its size!)\\n\\nThis is a place I want to come again to try other sandwiches.

It's impossible to find a Belizean restaurant, but sometimes we can find a restaurant that serves food that tastes like something pretty close to home.Well, here's what I thought of the following:\\n\\n-Chicken tamal was pretty good. However, it was overly salty once.\\n-Tamal de elote is pretty good, however a little dry.\\n-Pupusas are okay -- definitely had better.\\n-Tacos - really awesome, they give you a lot of meat per taco, it is a bit dry though;\\n-Tostada - eh, it's alright\\n-Micheladas - amazing! best I've had in the U.S.\\n-chips and salsa - great! tastes pretty authentic to me! I love the freshly fried tortilla chips.\\n\\nI'm rating it a little low because I really wanted to make this place my usual. However, I came in here with my boyfriend and my other Belizean friend, raving about the food. The service was fine. But at the end of our meal, I asked the server if we could split the bill between two parties. My question apparently was a ridiculous one to her because she said sternly: \\"No.\\" Before I could respond, she said that we could pay with multiple credit cards. So we wanted to split our food literally between two credit cards.\\n\\nWhen she brought the bill and I told her this, she got upset, didn't respond to us and stormed away. She came back, handed a pen to us roughly and said: \\"Write!\\" and walking away. So we had to do the math ourselves and wrote how much to charge on one card and how much to charge on the other. It was a really confusing experience because I paid me and my boyfriend's bill plus extra to account for the tip, and my friend paid for less and was supposed to tip more. However, I'm pretty sure by the end of it, we under-tipped by accident.\\n\\nShe kind of treated us like children, which was pretty damn awkward. She turned something positive and made it weird.

Fantastic burgers, friendly staff, and fun environment for the whole family makes me want to come back for more. \\n\\nThe burgers here taste like what a burger should really taste like. They don't try to put in any fancy sauces to lure customers in. They keep it simple by sticking with the basic ingredients like beef, lettuce, pickles, onions, etc. Whats better is that they use 100% fresh ground beef that is ground on-site and hand-formed right in front of you. You can watch them make it behind a glass wall! The meats don't have any chemicals such as antibiotics or preservatives either (as quoted from the website). It is also sustainable and sourced from certified small ranchers.  How awesome is that. \\n\\nThe hand washing machine is pretty cool too. If you use it, make sure you run through the entire cycle and not pull your hand out too early.

Granted, I know this is a pain, but we have never had any problems paying separately before. The woman refused to split the check, saying that there was a $15 minimum for each credit card. Seriously? We had just eaten there two days ago and the waiter had split the check for us. The only reason they refuse to split the check is because they are charged a service fee for every credit card transaction. \\n\\nAfter she paid the bill (in full, btw), my friend did not put a tip down on her card because she always tips in cash.

My friend said that we would never eat there again, and they did not apologize. It did not even seem to phase them.

The service we received from our waiter = questionable. I'll explain later. \\n\\nLet's talk about the pros. Good BBQ brisket. A bit dry but very tender. Just breaks apart. The seasoned waffle fries = delicious and crunchy! No soggy fries here. The baked beans were good. They cook it with pork I believe because there were bits of pulled pork in it. The texas toast was huge (see picture) and not drenched in butter like other places. Lightly buttered and still crunchy like toast rather than a piece of bread that went swimming in butter. \\n\\nThe place is a bit pricey? A plate with two sides can run between around $10-15.

Plenty of parking too btw. \\n\\nCame here because of a coupon for a free app we got in the mail. Got the Porky Pig Mac & Cheese = THE BEST MAC AND CHEESE EVER! Right amount of cheese sauce. Not too light not too much overpowering cheese. The pork and BBQ sauce along with some pork rinds = GENIUS! \\n\\nOur experience was a little ruined by our waiter. He seemed out of it for whatever reason. Was quiet. Didn't really check on our table much at all after taking our order. Only saw him when it was time for the check which we had to ask for from another staff nearby. Not sure if he was about to be on break or if there was something going on. Other tables around us I feel received better consistent service. The same people who took their order, checked up on them, and also brought them their food. But we had different people bringing us our food and providing us service. My biggest issue with this guy was that we paid in cash and rather than giving us all our change, he kept some of it. Our bill was $35.91 and we paid $50. We only got $14. He kept 9 cents. We didn't say anything because it was a trivial amount, however, that combined with his poor service wasn't ideal.

This rustic hole-in-the-wall looks like its been there forever, belying its actual youthful 5 years in business.  Right through the front door is the ordering counter, menu hanging over it on large blackboard.  Behind that is the kitchen, which takes up at least half the space, the source of tempting smells and a cacophany of food prep and folks busy cooking.\\n\\nIt was one of only a few places that had a line when we arrived, there never being a shortage of people showing up, but it works like a fast food joint and the few tables turn quickly, often of people's own volition, astonishing for this jaded New Yorker.  Indeed, although it looked like there wouldn't be anywhere to sit when we walked in, we got a table and there was a great communal spirit to share space.  There are some seats outside and the bar next door offers their outdoor seating to spillover PSB eaters.\\n\\nNot much to say that's not already been said about the renowned Reggie Deluxe, which was a must-order.  Fried chicken, bacon, cheddar cheese, and egg over easy sandwiched in a giant buttermilk biscuit, overflowing with sausage gravy.  Delicate and subtle this is not.  I suppose there's a certain bravado to stacking all these things together in one monstrous sandwich, unless this is typical in North Carolina or other parts of the South.  \\n\\nIts an experience to eat, but it didn't win me over.  The quality of most components is good but I've had much better fried chicken and biscuits elsewhere, which knocks down the enjoyment quite a bit; the sausage gravy was yummy though.  As an overall sandwich, its decent.\\n\\nMuch of the menu is taken up by biscuit sandwiches; build your own with egg, cheese, bacon, sausage patties, country ham, flank steak, or fried chicken, or choose from the house combinations (of which the Reggie Deluxe is one).  We also tried The Chatfield, selected because we apparently don't talk to each other when ordering, as this too was a fried chicken sandwich with bacon and cheese, just with apple butter sitting in for sausage gravy, and minus the egg.  Less decadent, but chicken and biscuit still subpar for me.\\n\\nThe menu finishes up with plenty of classic Southern sides, plus hash and andouille corn dogs, a selection of Southern sodas, Stumptown coffees, and a few desserts.\\n\\nPine State Biscuits is a fun place, casual and laid-back, serving up comfort biscuit-centric Southern foods.  It works, and its easy to see why there would be a cult following; there is more to that than just good food.  Not my thing though, and still not impressed with the chicken and biscuits."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"This is a highly popular restaurant inside of magic kingdom.

You can get stuck behind non-English speakers as I did.  A Cast Member had to explain what each little menu item and ingredients were.  IT TOOK SO LONG.

I forgot what this third room was like except it was medium sized and had a statue of Beast and Belle dancing.\\n\\nRECEIVING FOOD:  When you sit, you place your Magic Bands / Roses at the table with the receipts.  RFID readers for the bands and roses (for those paying without Magic Band) are at an edge of the table (closest to the servers, feel for the warm spot under the table) instead of in the middle.  So, if the RFID readers inevitably DON'T pick up on your stuff, you can wait a while for your food.

DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY. If you insist, go for lunch. I went in tonight with my friend for dinner and was so excited! They had a wait which was to be expected since it was Valentine's Day. We put in our name, waited the half hour+ and ordered right away when we were seated. We were there for probably 20-25 minutes before they come around and say the kitchen it closing if we wanted any other food. We were fine so we said no, thank you. TEN minutes later a girl comes over with a checkbook and says, can you pay now?? We literally had half of our food uncooked. We said whatever and put the checkbook to the side and went on eating and talking. LITERALLY 5 mins later she comes back and says are you ready to pay?? She just stood there and waited for us to get our wallets out. Absolutely rude and disgusting service. We spent over $100 for two people and were being forced to pay early?? How is that ok?!!!! We appease her and get our money out and say split it with this much in cash and this much on the card. She OVERCHARGED THE CARD!!! I'm so irate about this and I honestly never write reviews but it actually got worse. We finally just pay to get them off our backs and they pretty much already ruined our meal and experience and some guy comes over another 5 minutes later and tells us we actually need to leave the restaurant in 15 minutes!!!!!!! WHAT THE ACTUAL F*CK?! They were mopping the floors in front of us next to our tables!!! I finally couldn't even eat my food because I was APPAULED so I said I'll use the bathroom and we can leave. I walk up to the bathroom and there is a man in there cleaning with the door propped open!!! I had to ask him to leave just so I could use it. I washed my hands and he had taken the garbage so I literally threw my paper towel down. I have never had such terrible service and such a bad experience at any restaurant in the whole city and honestly in any state I've visited. They are way more polite at fast food restaurants. I'm still spinning from how awful and rude and just flat out terrible this place is. If it was late they should not have sat us or at least could have warned us that they were aggressively trying to close and leave. We tipped 20% because that is standard for us for even the minimum service and even that didn't get us respect as paying customers. So thank you happy lamb garbage can restaurant, we won't be back and will tell everyone we know about this experience."},{"name":"Hon's Wun-Tun House","address":"1339 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"I've probably eaten at Hons around 50 times.

Chicken corn crab chowder, add soy sauce. just a bit. 3. brown rice with these odd beans in it. its like $1.50 a bowl , 1 feeds 2 . 4. House special chow mein .

It wound up being the best. In fact, I seriously regretted not making another reservation there. After five nights eating mediocre food in other areas of the WDW, the vibrant flavors would have been a welcome reprieve.\\n\\nThings started on an awkward note when an unfamiliar pre-dinner hand washing procedure was brought to the table. With no explanation, what looked to be two servers brought warm towelettes to us on a plate. We hadn't ordered yet, but assumed they were for us in case of messy fingers. (Reminiscent of BBQ joints?) But then the two servers just stood at the table. And stood there. Still not a peep for explanation, just an expectant stare. Hmmm...ok, maybe my hands looked a little questionable. I did, after all miss that memo about the Magical Express taking four hours to get your luggage to the room, so there I sat in the same clothes I wore on a coast to coast flight. But no, we finally got it...just wipe and hand them back. The ceremony ends with a smile and a nod, our grubby paws back in tip-top shape. On with the food!\\n\\nI was charmed by the names of several different appetizers on the menu. Tibs in Brik, Taste of Africa, Duck Bobotie Rolls, it all sounded very exotic and wonderful. We wound up with a Grilled Boar Tenderloin and the Crispy Duck Bobotie Roll. The tenderloin was served very rare, which we liked. It was meltingly tender and had a spice note that we couldn't quite put our (very clean) fingers on. That was a common theme throughout the entire meal. If you like to be adventurous with flavors, this should be a happy place for you. The tenderloin was set atop a bed of delicious mashed turnips with chopped onions, garlic, amd tomatoes scattered around in a rich gravy.\\n\\nI couldn't wait to sink my teeth into the Bobotie Roll. I had been intrigued by this dish since I first spotted it on the menu months ago, while making the reservation. It lived up to the expectation. Resembling a thin egg roll, the outside crunch was familiar, but the savory, mildly spicy flavors of the filling definitely were not. \\n\\nI loved the bold colors that really made both of our entree presentations shine. My plate of short ribs was adorned with a bright yellow and red splash of sauce that added so much to the succulent meat. The BF's Lamb Two-Ways was another winner with a portion of fork-tender pulled lamb paired with a nicely grilled, rare lamb chop. Both entrees came accompanied with roasted root vegetables. These were the only small disappointment in an otherwise perfect meal. Those vegies could have used another two or three (or seven) minutes of cooking time. Some of them were rock-hard.\\n\\nOnce the hand washing debacle was forgotten, service was exemplary. Even being embarrassingly under-dressed, we were still treated like VIPs. Looking around the room, I noticed that we weren't the only ones who were told it was ok to come casual. There was a variety of people dressed to the nines and then there were also quite a few slackers like us. There were also a few well-behaved (thank goodness!) children being treated just as special as their parents.\\n\\nWe were exhausted and skipped dessert, but there were a few addictively delicious complimentary crackle cookies served with the check. When the BF mentioned how much he enjoyed them, the waiter smiled and brought out six more for him to take back to the room. It was a perfect end to a fantastic meal."},{"name":"Best of Szechuan","address":"15930 SW Regatta Ln","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"Good food, clean, and the most courteous staff ever.

So... it didn't take much prodding for me to walk away from laundry and housework.  We headed north toward Salem and the boy asked what I wanted for lunch.  Being it was that kind of day and all I said seafood... but someplace on the water with a view would make it perfect. \\n\\n Ahhhhh.. the best laid plans of mice and moms...  We ended up at the Black Lobster.  (Who's ever seen a black lobster.. should have taken the hint I guess).   After a spell the waitress came over, I can't imagine why it took so long... there were only two other  tables and one other waitress.  We ordered something to drink.  The boy got an iced coffee and when it came he took one sip and said the feared phrase \\"taste this... does this taste like dishwater\\"?  No folks, I'm smarter than that.. I took his word for it!  At this point we should have settled the tab and moved on.  But nooooooo we're beggars for punishment...\\n\\nWe ordered the bacon wrapped scallops, salad and a chowder to start.  The chowder was great (explaining the one star I gave) it went downhill from there.   The salad was out of the bag with no added frills (and not cheap), the scallops/bacon were deep fried.  They were tough and barely palatable.  For a main course (yeah... we were dumb enough to order everything at once) he got the stuffed sole and I got a fish sandwich.  Again... he says \\"taste this... does this taste fishy\\" ... this time fell for it and took a small bite.  YEP.. he was right .. it was fishy... really fishy.  Then I tasted my sandwich/fries... both very greasy and the fish looked like Gortons.  Then... the realization hit... there was a strange taste to the whole plate... was that... bacon?? YEP... it was all fried in the same oil as those scallops lending a heavy bacon grease taste to all that followed...  The waitress never even had the decency to come ask how it was.  I suppose the fact that neither of our plates had been touched was a heads up.  Needless to say we asked the other (unsuspecting) waitress for the check, squared the bill, which was pricey for two people at lunch, and left pronto. \\n\\nI guess I should have stayed home, did laundry and made us both tuna sandwiches for lunch.  But never fear dear reader...  when we came home later that evening I made a fabulous french onion soup for us!!!

Eventually I stopped ordering it until a friend highly recommended Zyka and its butter chicken. \\n\\nThe butter chicken here ticks all the boxes. It has the right amount of sweetness that its supposed to have and is delicious. Their nan's are fabulous as well, very fresh, soft and perfectly complement the butter chicken.

Well that's because all my friends here have written great reviews!

Or maybe I just don't know much of it.\\nReasonable pricing on cocktails and local craft beer, $5 for a burger where you can choose how it's done? I'm a happy camper! My friend and I shared the burger, the sausage and cheese plate with 3 drinks. It all came to less than $40. That to me, is quite reasonable.\\nFast forward 4 days and the morning we were leaving, we grabbed a coffee next door at Stumptown planning to walk down Stark towards 2nd. But as we walked by we noticed brunch was being served. Well why trek 8 blocks, albeit short blocks compared to my city, when there's a perfectly good place right here?\\nSo we went right in and got seats at the communal table. \\nI've never had a fried duck egg before. Only in Chinese dishes such as preserved egg and sticky rice etc. It seemed bigger than chicken eggs but didn't have a big difference in taste. Just a more concentrated yolk flavour. Which was indeed cooked to a perfect consistency that smothered the sausage, pork belly and beans when broken. \\nI couldn't resist ordering the truffled popcorn my friends kept raving about. I noticed it was a different type of popcorn during the happy hour menu so I'm glad I was able to try it in the end. We couldn't finish it all so I took it all the way back to Vancouver. And yes, I had it for breakfast the next morning and was still quite good. \\nThe service was friendly and attentive on both occasions. During happy hour, we were told it would be a 30 minute wait but ended up only waiting 10. \\nI'll drive down again in a heartbeat if I can have more of that popcorn! 4 hours isn't that long right?"},{"name":"Bangkok Xpress","address":"7000 NE Airport Way","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"price good, food good, like you are in a restaurant, not in an airport.

We were literally the last table in the back corner, which was cozy, but I felt a little forgotten at times. Our waitress was very nice and took our drink order, but never brought us water until we asked for it, a second time, during our meal. I was so parched!! That aside, we had the kimchee calamari for a starter. This was not my first choice, as there were some other items that looked tasty, but my boyfriend wanted this one and I felt like being nice. Anyways, it was delish and I'm glad we went with it. There were a bunch of lightly fried veggies with it and, although there was a sauce on top of everything, the calamari and veggies were still super crispy, not at all soggy. For entrees: blackened swordfish with the avocado pico topping, and a lobster stuffed sole. The latter was mine, which I chose based on some other Yelp reviews, and I was quite pleased with it. I also had a bite of the swordfish and it was SO good. Each dish also came with a starch and veggie, though the menu made the swordfish dish sound like it was just the fish - not sure if that was just a NYE thing or not.. And although we were full we HAD to have one last dessert for 2016 (diet starts tomorrow). We went with the apple/cherry crisp and it was just 'okay'.

It was close-by and open at 3 in the afternoon. The staff was so friendly and helpful and funny!! The decor was very pleasant. I didn't order a drink, but I noticed quite a nice-sized bar of options. The food was fresh, cooked right, presented beautifully and delicious!! My only complaint was that the service was a little slow, but we did visit at a quiet time. I was also hoping for more noodle options. I am gluten-free and I'm tired of rice and love rice noodles. I am not a fan of the wide noodles. So the only option was pad thai, which I just had last week (somewhere else). So I ordered the pineapple fried rice. It comes with chicken, pork and shrimp. They made a substitution for me at no extra charge. It was so good! :) It did only come with 2 or 3 shrimp on top and needed a little more pineapple. But overall, great place! Most likely will visit again! :)"},{"name":"Zyka","address":"1677 Scott Blvd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"Meh...

Since there's a big difference between $5.99 and over $9 I asked the server if I got the $5.99 special, after a few hems and haws she has to go look up the receipt and responds with well you ordered a 4 piece meal. . and said well the special says 4 piece meal.

The decor inside is very cute, however, despite it's crunched spaces. \\n\\nThe one server was very nice and friendly.

Either quality has dropped off, the demand is too high, and in most cases, they've all closed and been replaced.\\n\\nThat being said, it's in Atlantic Station, so if you're planning on coming for an extended period of drinking, or to stack on top of a movie night or something, parking won't be free after two hours, and I'm not entirely sure if anywhere outside of the movie theater actually validates parking.\\n\\nAnyway, it was a fairly nondescript weekday evening when I came with a friend, hoping for a decent expedient dinner.  It wasn't busy when we got there, and we were seated pretty quickly by a friendly hostess.  We were greeted and had our drink order taken, and our server was a friendly guy, and I had no objections to his demeanor or how he treated us.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, as a whole, service was a little underwhelming, in spite of the slow night.  Maybe if we sat at the bar with the evident regulars, it would've been a different story, since there were two bartenders for like five patrons.  \\n\\nThey had no steak for my friend's salad, and they outright forgot to bring us out our appetizer.  Granted, they took it off the check completely, which was way above and beyond what I would have expected, and was appreciated, especially when it turned out to not be as good as we had hoped.  Goat cheese is a pretty powerful flavor, but when it's somehow managed to be overpowered by an edemame mash, it's pretty impressive.\\n\\nRegardless, the entrees were about the quality that I had hoped it would be.  The fish and chips I ordered were as good as any of the other Meehan's that I've had them at, which ultimately is the biggest deal for me, since I really like their fish and chips.  My friend stated that her salad was a little over-dressed, and the fact that the restaurant had apparently run out of steak outright was kind of a turn-off for her.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that this particular experience was kind of underwhelming overall, but I still like the place, probably on the equity built from my general pleasure with the other Meehan's locations.  Service was slow, albeit friendly and willing to make very right on innocuous things, but the food was still good, which is important.\\n\\nThe centralized location in Atlantic Station is nice and all, but if I'm going to prepare for a night of drinking, I think I still would favor the Vinings location if I were given a choice."},{"name":"Mighty Fine Burgers Fries & Shakes","address":"10515 N Mo-Pac Expy, Ste 105","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Very simple and the best foods are always simple.

Total Fiorentine trattoria...the only thing that would make this place more Tuscan would be communal tables (which isn't a bad idea).  The food is typical northern italian (Butter, noodles, Mushrooms, Veal, thick hearty food)  I would recommend Firenze during the cold months just because of the heavy, homey, food that they offer....but please go during the summer months and move to the more lighter side of the menu.  All in all this place gets a definite must try from me.   The small italian style \\"fast food\\" joint they operate on the corner is good....not too spectacular. The smaller shop is a good turn away from the chain locations (quiznos, panera, finagle, etc...) that are in the area.

As another reviewer noted, you enter the restaurant by descending down a winding broad stairway with lush greenery and babbling water on either side. The restaurant itself is very well appointed, with high ceilings with many wood tones, white table cloths, and an open-view kitchen area. I was dining alone, as I was traveling on business, and was a little disappointed to not have a bar at which to eat. This is not uncommon in more traditional high-end restaurants, though you would think this is a common request for a restaurant inside a hotel.\\n\\nThey started by providing a complimentary piece of bruschetta that was very tasty. They also brought sliced bread and a saucer of herbed olive oil. This brings me to my next quibble: the olive oil was bitter and may have been fine for cooking but was of inferior taste/quality for dipping bread (probably not cold-pressed). My waiter--with a little prompting from me--recommended a pinot noir. It was smooth. I ordered a ceaser salad with homemade dressing; it was very good; crisp romaine and a well-balanced dressing. The entree for me was a veal ravioli with a vodka cream sauce. This dish was simply outstanding and the highlight of my experience. The presentation of the dish was artfully done with a shitake mushroom atop each ravioli, and the sauce in the middle topped with mildly cooked spinach. The vodka cream sauce was not the typical overcreamed, thin stuff you find many places, but was a rich dark pink color and the tomato flavor veritably exploded onto my taste buds. After dinner I ordered panna cotta with a raspberry sauce, and a cafe mocha (cappucino with Godiva and Baileys). \\n\\nI found portion sizes to be perfect for me (I prefer quality over quantity), though a large eater might want to add an appetizer.

I've attached a photo from my two recent visits here. I came on Saturday and I am back again on Monday. I even told the chef my favorite dessert and he made it from scratch. Ilove the food and the people here. They go out of their way to make sure your belly is exactly how it should be which is full and that you leave here happy. In the picture is dungeons crab (ordered this twice), Chinese hollow plant, beef chow fun, fish fillet with onions/scallions, sizzling XO sauce squid clay pot, snow pea tips, beef short ribs with black pepper sauce, and last but not least a homemade red bean dessert not featured on the menu because the chef knew it was my favorite from my last visit. He even gave me the rest to go and told me he made it special for my family and I. \\n\\nWith all that said if you haven't already eaten here you really should start!"},{"name":"Lime Fresh Mexican Grill","address":"500 N Orlando Ave, Ste 100","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"While the food was good, the service was less than good.

And according to the website, all the meat served here are halal, which is a very rare thing to find around.\\n\\nAnd many of my sub-continent Asian friends actually fond of this place, which always be a good thing for an ethnic restaurant!\\n\\nWe had a couchsurfing gathering here, so some 25 people show up. The place, as advertised, catered to our needs.  Move-able tables and chairs to form a long dining table, which the waiters were completely cool with that.  Separate checks (more of a cafeteria style where you ordered your food at the counter and they would call your name once your order is ready), so don't worry about separating bills etc.  Ready-to-use, fill-your-own pitchers for water from cups/silverware station.  So, Zyka is definitely a friendly place for big groups!\\n\\nOne thing I have a little problem was the price of the food, which was a little too pricey for my liking.  Don't get me wrong; my Hyderabadi Mutton Biryani dish (and Vegetable Samosa) was very tasty, but I feel that the 6-7 dollars per plate for the main dish was too much.  \\nThey served your food on stereo-foam plates and cups, which wasn't reflect the price you have paid.  Maybe because this wasn't a typical humongous American size dish, or perhaps because the environment didn't justify you to spend that amount of money for your food?  For two people (two main dish, samosa and naan, and one diet coke), we paid 22 bucks plus tips.  Slightly too much.\\n\\nBut man, the food tasted good.  Like everybody else has mentioned, the Chicken 65 is a must to have.  Yes, granted, it was a small portion appetizer with too high price tag, but it was very spicy.  Not the hot-sauce kind of spicy, but the good herbs and spices kind of spicy.\\n\\nMy good Indian friend suggested their Butter Chicken, which was very saffroni and curried, and add the naan bread to scoop up the broth, you have your perfect Indian meal.  Nom nom.\\n\\nI completely understand and respect that they chose not to have an alcohol license in the establishment (I called before hand to ask whether it was allowed to bring your own *alcohol* beverages.  And they don't allow alcohol in the restaurant).\\n\\nI've had a better Indian food experiences before, so I probably wouldn't necessarily come back to Zyka for another ethnic dish by my own (I could spend 22 bucks on sooo much better ethnic food along Bufford Highway!), but I would definitely come back if there are friends who want to go."},{"name":"Clyde Common","address":"1014 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Both times that I have visited, I have not been disappointed by food, drinks, or service.

The reviews on Mellow Mushroom were outstanding. I was very disappointed with this restaurant. The place was packed when we got there on a Friday. Waited about 30 minutes, I was not sure what made this place so attractive. It was loud and I noticed a lot of customers waiting for food as we waited to be seated.  We got our food about 30 minutes after ordering so about an hour total. The pizza has a good look, large crust. 16 inch cheese was $13.99 which is on the hign end for our area of town. We also had a cheese Calzone which was $7.99. Drinks were $2.20 each.  The problem was the pizza wasn't fully cooked, and they also use bread dough of some kind. So there is a lot of bread in this pizza, I'm not kidding. It just didn't taste very good, way to doughy. Think of subways wheat bread with bland sause and chesse on top. That kind of doughy.\\n\\nThis thick breaded pizza dough will give you a feeling that you are full. If you over do it with a side order of knots, you will most likely leave there with a belly ache, if not worse.\\n\\nThe calzone was nothing special but I did not have any of that. You leave thinking why did I eat two slices of that. We were too hungry to complain and left it at that.\\n\\nIt was probally number 1 or 2 of the worse pizza I have ever had. Even hungry howies beats it by a notch and thats saying something. I am not sure how it has received such good reviews on yelp? I am starting to question this guide. \\n\\nI guess younger people go there, maybe because it's trendy and sell craft beer of some kind.  I am not sure why anyone would go back.\\n\\nUpdate:\\n\\nChanged by review and upped it a star, I may have been too harsh. But give me a break with the 4 and 5 stars.

It was my first trip to Pinbusterz.\\n\\nThis place used to be the Rose Bowl bowling alley. It's now a bowling alley/Chuck E. Cheese-type arcade center, complete with little prizes for kids to win. It's a dive, not that there's anything wrong with that. \\n\\nI'll get the few cons out of the way first:\\n\\n*They knew a party was coming, but didn't seem prepared. The \\"family fun\\" aspect is new and given the professionalism of the staff, I expect these wrinkles will be ironed out in no time. \\n*The room for the party was nice and out of the way. However, there were broken bowling balls under the booths, a huge open janitor's trash can next to the table and several brooms and dustpans stacked against the wall. It felt less like a party room and more like a place to hold junk.\\n*Many of the games were broken or unplugged.\\n*The pizza was awful, even for bowling alley food.\\n*I am assuming the switch in names was recent, as several items were still carrying the Rose Bowl name and logo.\\n*The prizes for the games were very cheap and several broke almost immediately. Dollar store toys are more durable.\\n*The parking lot is weird. One of the exits has been repainted and a barrier placed to create more parking when frankly, the lot they have is more than adequate. It's not well painted, and looks like it's still an exit...until you attempt to use it as such, and find you must turn around in a narrow part of the lot just to exit. \\n\\nThe pros:\\n*The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Some allies have staff that pretty much ignore anyone who isn't a regular, and that is absolutely not the case here. They were very welcoming, and it was appreciated. Even when getting the prizes, they were patient and enthusiastic. This must be a good place to work to produce such pleasant employees.\\n*Instead of tickets and coins, they issue you a key card. I loved this; you didn't have to worry about your kids losing money or having to wrestle with a ton of tickets. It's environmentally-friendly, too.\\n*The games were very modern and cool. They had much more for older kids to play than Chuck E. Cheese. I particularly enjoyed the new take on the classic Frogger, and Operation.\\n*Unlike Chuck E.'s, this place doesn't turn the game volume up to Def Con 4, and there aren't a ton of kids running around like maniacs. It's quieter, the people more well-behaved, and even my autistic daughter was able to enjoy the venue without a problem.  If you have a child who has trouble tolerating the crazy lights and deafening sounds in most arcades, this is a good alternative. \\n*They had lemonade in February. This Southern-born gal appreciated this greatly. \\n*The *very best thing*, and the reason I would recommend this place to others? When the kids wanted to bowl, I was concerned the serious players there would be displeased. Instead, they encouraged the kids, gave them tips and cheered when they did well! They couldn't have been nicer. My kids showed up with zero interest in bowling, and now they can't wait to go back.\\n\\nThree stars, but I expect that after this \\"shakedown cruise\\" period that will go up to four."},{"name":"Bellmont Caffe","address":"80 Leonard St","city":"Belmont","stars":"4","text":"Adorable.

Normally I might ask a fro yo place if I can sample a flavor to be certain it is worth the buck or two but surely with Dole's actually trademarked name on it the thing MUST be their actual whip which I have not seen outside of Disneyworld.

Incase you don't know, what will happen is you will choose a type of soup to have set up in the middle of your table. The soup will be heated by an electric stove type heating plate. Next, you will pick a variety of items to heat and cook in the soup! This reminded me of a fondue pot but with a twist. My party had a blast cooking all the different foods. We had broccoli, spinach, calamari, dumplings, and chicken to name a few. We all felt we got enough food and loved just having the soup by itself. The price was very reasonable as well.

Literally the best anyone can get both of Tennessee and east of the Mississippi! \\n\\n\\nJust go there folks! \\n\\n\\nI am a BBQ snob. I admit this. I prefer places that aren't chain related and where there is an actual pit. I have given places higher marks based upon atmosphere, however the atmosphere here is that of a root canal, and the food? Well let me get to that. \\n\\nThe brisket has the flavor profile of McDonald's. The pulled pork is almost as flavorful as sewage, and the smoked turkey Brest is almost as awful as their sweet vinegar slaw. \\n\\nThe green beans have little to no seasoning which they merely rely on what I can only imagine is store bought, factory made, liquid smoke added bacon. \\n\\nThe greens were good, but that's the real trick, greens should be good, though tasted \\"tinny\\" as I suspect they might be canned. \\n\\nThey advertise \\"competition quality\\" ribs, which were sampled on a second visit (I always give a place at least two visits before passing a judgment.) and to out mildly, if these ribs are \\"competition quality\\" then one can only suspect the competitions are that for a church, community festival, or even a preschool. I know in completion style they look for slight chew, but these ribs literally could pull teeth out. \\n\\nOn the 3rd visit (I have ventured 4 times to this locations) I was joined by a friend, Myron from Georgia. Myron who does BBQ competing, and even runs a school for BBQ. He pointed out the flavor profiles for the sauces were horrid, and one thing that he, his wife, myself and my wife always check out are the sides, especially deep fried pickles. To be polite,  I cannot tell you what he compared the  too, I personally compare them to garbage that has been battered and deep fried in sewage. \\n\\nThat staff either needs a raise, or something to make them at least appear as if they wanted to be there.

The ribs were better then i thought they would be. They were thick and i added extra spicy sauce bc i love saucy ribs  my bill came out to be $35 for my beer, appetizer and entree. I was beyond stuffed and had plenty to take home with me so i definitely feel like it was worth it.

We don't normally eat French Food, and thought this would be great for something different.    Wow, I have been missing out on so much!\\n\\nFor starters, I had the salad Lyonnaise, delicious. Lovely greens perfecly dressed with a poached egg on top. My husband had the cream of mushroom soup and said it was very good. For dinner, I had the trout, he had the steak. When they first bought out the entrees, I had some remorse for not ordering the steak, it looked superb, thick steak perfectly crusted on the outside and a soft dark red in the middle, with a nice roquefort sauce. However, the tide quickly turned once I tried the trout and both my husband and I agreed the this was the hands down favorite.   The fish was perfectly cooked with a delicate meaty texture and an addicting orange butter sauce that was very light and melded excellently with the fish flavor. If I were at home I seriously may have licked the plate when I was done.  :)\\n\\nFor dessert, the chocolate mousse was just ok.    However, the profiterolles were amazing.   How can you go wrong with fried pastry filled with vanilla ice cream and swimming in a dense chocolate sauce, YUM.

That's the first thing I noticed when I walked in. Big boxes full of potatoes and supplies line the area where you place your order.  It seemed like a weird decoration, but perhaps one of convenience.  A boy did take 2 boxes of potatoes back to the kitchen while I was waiting for my food.  Bottles of Hellmann's mayonnaise, French's mustard, Heinz ketchup line shelves on the wall, too, so maybe it's just a different philosophy of storage.\\n\\nOnce you wind your way past the supplies and up to the counter, a very enthusiastic, clean-cut, smiling young person will take your order.  If you want a burger, you can choose your size (1/2 or 1/4 pound), choose your toppings (pickles, lettuce, onions, tomato), and choose your condiment (red, yeller, white).  In the spirit of Rudy's \\"sause\\" Mighty fine decided to mis-spell a word.  Personally, I was not amused by this, but my food came out exactly as ordered, probably because my preferences were clearly written on the paper bag in which my food was served.  Also in the spirit of Rudy's, this place has no plates.  You eat off of paper.  That doesn't bother me, and I bet it helps keep prices low.\\n\\nAs for the food, well, I've only tried the cheeseburger so far.  If you like a thick meat patty, you'll probably like this burger.  It was quite juicy, so I don't think they use particularly lean meat, but I found it quite tasty.  I saw an advertisement indicating that Mighty Fine uses \\"Coleman Natural Beef,\\" and I like to think that means the cow I ate had a happy, antibiotic-free life, roaming pastures full of wildflowers and wasn't scared at all when it got slaughtered.  Right.  Anyway, the hamburger buns are lightly toasted Mrs. Baird's, so there's nothing special about that, but mine tasted good.\\n\\nOne item of note, this place is CLEAN.  I mean really clean.  Despite how  busy the restaurant was on a Sunday at noon, I saw no garbage on tables, the kitchen looked sparking clean, and all the counters were gleaming.  Even the beverage area was spotless.

Except then any resemblance at all to burrito started to fade. The proportions were all wrong, too much greasy greasy meat, not enough beans or rice, and, in Peter's and my mole chicken burrito, the mole sauce was overwhelming.

This worked out great, because it was the cooked food that I wanted to try. \\n\\nThe server was really nice, and warned us well in advance that if we were in a rush, it wouldn't be a great idea to eat here right now. We did have a time deadline, but surprisingly things came out much quicker than expected.\\n\\nHere's what we had:\\n\\nYakitori with Sake Shot\\nFirst of all, I never had a great yakitori experience... After all, it's only chicken skewers right? Well, even for the most skeptical, it was actually quite tasty. Everything was tender and well cooked. Even the offal skewers were good. The set included chicken breast, heart, liver, dark meat, and some with onions, and some with egg plant, and a sake shot. Well done for a simple dish.\\n\\nPork Cutlet with Curry\\nI am crazy about Pork Cutlets (or Tonkatsu) but not huge on Japanese style curry. Here I am, redeveloping a new love for Japanese curry. Flavourful curry, soft rice, and on top a perfectly crisp yet tender tonkatsu. Ah love. Really really liked this.\\n\\nLastly, we finished off with the spicy tuna on crispy rice. Not really knowing what we were ordering, we chose this and were surprised! It was a flat deep fried disc of rice and on top was marinated spicy tuna, and a jalepeno. Although the rice was a bit oily, (not surprising) it was something you needed to try at least once. It's a completely unique and fun dish.\\n\\nAt the end of the meal, the server came back and told me something incredibly surprising. If there is some Japanese dish that I really wanted to eat but wasn't on the menu, I could request it if I called in ahead of time. The main chef will try to make it as best he can but in his own style of course. That just blew me away. \\n\\nI had a good meal, good service, and then it just went beyond. I will definitely come again, and next time will try the tonkatsu, oden, omakase or even my own special request."},{"name":"Queen of Sheba","address":"2413 NE Martin Luther King Jr Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Solid Ethiopian food.

Fortunately for us, there was a cancellation and we just took that reservation and made sure we planned our trip around that date & time. \\n\\nThe \\"Be Our Guest Restaurant\\" opened in December of 2012 and it's located in Fantasyland. The food is French-inspired. As you approach the gates to the restaurant, it's supposed to look like you're entering the castle, including the entrance of the castle. There are three dining rooms located within the castle; including the ballroom where Belle and the Beast danced, the West Wing where the rose is kept, and the Rose Garden. Being able to dine at the ballroom is the best, as you find yourself constantly looking at all of the details that they did to resemble the movie. Even after you are seated, you are welcomed to walk around the entire restaurant.\\n\\nAs for the food, it's definitely their high-end quality version at the amusement park with their full professional table service. Their entree was about $30/adult; whereas our total bill for a party of 4 adults & 1 child was about $240, including tax & tip.\\n\\nDo you remember the lyrics to the song \\"Be Our Guest\\"? Try the grey stuff, it's delicious! Don't believe me? Ask the dishes! Well.., they do serve the grey stuff, which is a type of Cookie Cr√®me dessert. FYI, you will be able to take a photo with the Beast in the library of the Beast's castle after your dining experience.\\n\\nIt's definitely worth the price of the meal if you're lucky to be able to make a reservation to this restaurant.

I've been to Germany twice so maybe that's why I am a little biased - but don't get the wrong impression, the food selections really aren't German (I mean there's a few Americanized versions of German food but I mean they also have crab cakes soooo), the German aspect comes in through the beer.

They recently added more items to it and raised the price a couple of bucks to $11.95, but there's still a lot of room for improvement in my book. \\n\\nIt was very busy so I went to the bar since there's plenty of room.  Two bartenders (BTs) working, one guy greets me then goes off to do his thing and never comes back.  The other BT is a ways away but eventually catches me and walks over to greet me - - he gives me a water and puts my order in for some BACON!!!  Then I go up and hit the brunch spread. \\n\\nThey've added more food (just what I need), including mini desserts (chocolate cheesecake, tres leches, bread pudding, pecan bars, flan) - none of which will rock your boat, similar in mediocre quality compared to the Buffet Palace's mini desserts.  There's pancakes, fruit, some slaws and mayo salads, salsas (the avocado and mango+habanero salsas were tasty), queso in a pot, and more starchy-carbo stuff.  I loved their carrot cake french toast, it was really good - - definitely get that. \\n\\nThere are several regular items that I just don't care for so I skipped those, but even w/ the new additions there just weren't that many new items that I really liked.  The quality is sub par, some of the food is bland, the gravy for the biscuits is quite runny, and same w/ the grits.  The fried chicken cordon blue was not fully cooked through - pink on the inside, not good.  \\n\\nI got back to my seat and a waitress comes up w/ some bacon, she asks BT #1 (who did not put in my order) \\"who gets the bacon?\\".  He deferred her to BT #2 so she went around the bar and disappeared.  Then BT #1 looked at me and asks:  \\"you ordered bacon too, right?\\".  Yes, I did.  Ten to fifteen minutes later, I'm playing with my bland brunch and runny gravy, and still NO bacon.  I ask BT#2 - - \\"where's the bacon?\\".  He says \\"you didn't get it?\\".  NO.  Then he puts in a new order.  So these two BT's don't communicate closely enough on orders, and BT#1 just left me hanging.  That's so kewl I tell ya.    \\n\\nSo to sum it all up, out of the 25 or so items they put out for brunch, only a few were worthy of eating (carrot cake french toast, hash browns, waffles, crab salad, migas, fruit, avocado salsa) while everything else is just mediocre and blaahhh.  Those items alone saved it from being a 1-star experience.  Had the service been better, it would be 3-stars.  The BTs work hard, they clear your dirty plates, but you gotta stay on top of them for extra orders - - like BACON!  \\n\\nSo I don't think I will be in a mad rush outta the church parking lot and run everyone over just to get a seat at Trudy's Sunday Brunch, unless I'm really extra hungry for starchy and bland carbs and runny gravy n' grits.  But if $11.95 is your in the realm of your budget, then you may be running over people in the church parking lot just to eat here."},{"name":"FINO Restaurant Patio & Bar","address":"2905 San Gabriel St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This is another upscale-ish restaurant.

Pretty good swath of things to sample I think.  Salmon was OK, a little bland for my taste.  It was served with an avocado/yogurt puree which tasted basically like guacamole.  Not sure if those two things are supposed to go together or not.  Sweet pea agnolotti was actually the best thing we ordered.  Again a little bland, but adding some salt and fresh ground pepper to it did the trick.  Lots of sauteed mushrooms with great little pockets of pasta and cheese and sweet peas.

The martini was fine, she was not super happy with the wine (wanted Malbec, again took bartender recommendation: Serra Nuove).  Given this, we decided to head to another location.  No harm, no foul - that is until the bill arrived.  $28 for a small glass of wine?  Without warning?

We had always wanted to go, but it was always so packed.  But it was a Saturday night and there was hardly anyone in there, so we went.\\n\\nParking was a bit of a pain, but we managed to find a spot at a meter down the street.\\n\\nIt's a cozy place, but big enough for a big crowd.  We were confused walking in because apparently the hostess stand wasn't by the door, but next to the bar. Definitely a strange placement for it, because you don't even see it when you walk in. We walked in and felt like idiots because we didn't know where to go, so we stood there awkwardly for a second, but then a friendly bartender pointed us in the right direction. We sat in a huge booth that was pretty comfortable, but the seats weren't padded or anything.\\n\\nLooking at the menu, they seemed to have plenty to choose from, but it all looked more expensive than we thought it would be.  Someone had previously recommended the wings to me, so I ordered the chipotle wings, which I was told was a step lower than their \\"Gates of Hell\\" hot wings.  My boyfriend got the quesadillas and I wanted to try their pale ale.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere was pretty cool, but we were surprised to see so few people inside.  At least there was no wait to be seated, I guess.  My boyfriend was also trying to keep an eye on the game on the TVs behind the bar, but they were pretty far away.  If you want to watch any games here, sit at the bar.\\n\\nOur food came out pretty quickly, and the quantity seemed good.  I took pictures of each of our meals if you are curious.  The wings were $14 for 20 of them, which isn't bad.  They were also cooked on a grill so they were different from the kind of wings you can get anywhere else.  The sauce was good, but not that spicy, but it was OK because there was a bottle of Tabasco sauce on the table - always a plus!  The wings were yummy but not all that meaty and kinda fatty.  I've definitely had better, but at least they didn't taste all fried.  The quesadilla was pretty good, but nothing really special about it.\\n\\nThe pale ale was a little heavy for my taste, but it was pretty good, but my only complaint is that they didn't really have a very organized drink menu.  I might have picked a better beer for myself, but I didn't really know what I had to choose from.  The menu was confusing to us newcomers.  But the beer tasted pretty high-quality so the beer itself wasn't a disappointment.\\n\\nOur server was also pretty nice, but she kind of seemed to be ready to go home for the night and we felt a bit rushed.\\n\\nAll in all the food was pretty good, and it cost about $30-$35 for our two dishes and two beers.

They have changed the sides with the plates, instead of tabouleh they now serve olives, you can add tabouleh for $1.

It's the only Peruvian restaurant in Vancouver, and it's in an auto spa. No, that is not a typo, it really is in an auto spa. Not right in the middle, but it's really easy to miss if you don't know what you're looking for. We first heard about it when Amelia told us about it a month ago when we all went to Harambe, and the mere fact that it was attached to a car wash was enough draw for us to decide our next dinner would be there. Since then, I've been reading about what Peruvian food is like, looking up reviews, and repeatedly going to Mochika's website to look at their menu. Suffice it to say, I was pretty pumped to go.\\n\\nIt's pretty dangerous to go to a new restaurant with high expectations, but Mochika's definitely did not disappoint. We pretty much had the place to ourselves tonight, but the place was comfortably casual and the chef (who was also our waiter) was very attentive. Carmen told us that his brother (who works for BMW and gets the cars detailed at the auto spa) called ahead and told the chef that they should take care of us. That might of been a good reason to be attentive, but Carmen also said he looked nervous that I was taking photos of the food, and he probably heard me say that I would blog about it. Whatever works!\\n\\nCarmen asked the chef what he recommended and listed almost exactly what we chose, but also added the daily special, which was a fresh mussel topped with a red onion and corn salad. The salad was pretty delicious, but the mussels were the green lipped ones you generally buy frozen and already on the half shell, so it didn't taste as good as an actual \\"fresh\\" mussel, but it was still pretty tasty.\\n\\nThe next thing that came was our yuca frita con chicharron. The yuca tasted a lot like a drier taro, and was served with a yellow pepper sauce, and Amelia shared her Peruvian mayonnaise that came with her yuca (she is vegetarian and order the solo yuca frita and tamal). The chicharron was my favourite thing of the night. I love pork belly. I love crackling. It's so simple and perfect, and the onion salad that came with it complimented it perfectly with it's slightly sweet and spicy acidity. It looks a lot like chinese roast pork, but it isn't heavily salted, so you really get to savor the natural taste of the pork and the really luxurious texture of the fatty pork melting away in your mouth.\\n\\nThe next thing that came was the ceviche. We opted for the mixed seafood one that had sole, mussel, squid, and prawns. I've only ever had ceviche twice. Once in Nice, and once in Buenos Aires. Both were fairly mediocre and pretty disappointing. This ceviche didn't have a lot to live up to, so maybe I'm a little bias, but it was pretty delicious. The sole was still pretty raw, which is a bit unusual for a ceviche, but I love raw fish, so I wasn't complaining. All of the seafood was fresh tasting (save the rogue mussel that was on the side) and the marinade was fresh, tart, and a little bit spicy. I'd like to see ceviche on more menus, there are so many variations.\\n\\nOur two mains came at once, and I was already getting full, but being the professional eater that I am (thank you, Amelia), I powered through. We had the arroz con pato, which was duck braised for 6 hours in beer and peruvian spices atop a huge bed of delicious, wet cilantro rice. The duck was surprisingly delicately flavoured, considering how long it was braised, and it was just so delightfully tender and moist. The rice was just as good to eat as it was to look at, but i definitely didn't eat as much of it as I wanted to since there was so much food before and after it. Girl's gotta pace herself.\\n\\nThe other entree we had was seco de cordero con frijoles, which was braised lamb and beans with salty, garlicky rice. If I had to pick, I would say I preferred the lamb over the duck because I love lamb, and it's earthy flavour was really pervasive throughout the sauce and beans. I'm not sure what cut of lamb they used, but they braised it with the bones, which I always like more since bones always make slow cooked food taste better. The beans definitely made me think of italian cannelini bean dishes, and were probably my favourite part of the dish.\\n\\nAfter all of this, we still managed to share a piece of the crema volteada, which is described as Peruvian creme brulee, but is actually peruvian flan or creme caramel. Whatever it was, it was delicious. It is way too richnot to be shared, but definitely worth trying at least once. The chef also gave us what appeared to be house made dark chocolates filled with caramel and pecans, which were really delicious as well. It should be noted that Carmen was able to pack away a lot more of the cilantro rice than I was, and she is really thin, so I think she may have another stomach instead of another lung or something. Girl can eat, and that's saying something coming from me."},{"name":"Los Pinos Mexican","address":"4919 Hudson Bend Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Excellent food and service, always!!

Head over to the Kitchen. \\n\\nReasons why I dare to give the best ranked restaurant in Denver 3 stars. \\n\\n1. The food isn't *that* good. \\n\\nOk, it was good. Even very-good on account of the Frico Caldo and the Panna Cotta, but everything else was overly salty without a good note to balance it out. \\n\\nOf course one might expect a salumi plate to be salty, and maybe even a creamy pasta dish, but serve one without a fresh garnish for balance? Bad idea. \\nBasically, I was stunned as to how salty everything was. \\n\\n2. You get talked-down to.  \\n\\nI know what you're thinking: it's fancy, they're supposed to walk you through the details. Well, sure. I'd expect that. But I'd also expect some fucking correct italian pronunciation and an awareness that risotto is traditionally gluten-free and made of Rice (not pasta!). \\n\\nI lived in Italy for a while and I ate good food both there and stateside, but there must be some expectation within the culture of Frasca that all diner's are having their first-time foodie experience (especially if they look under 50?). To be fair, I don't think the couples on either side of us knew what was happening.  But still. The best way to share information is not to condescend. \\n\\n3. The cost. \\n\\nAs I mentioned, the food was good. And for a nice bottle and two full tasting menus, perhaps $340 is reasonable. However, we can have a fantastic tasting for 4 at the Kitchen Upstairs and it still comes in under 300.  \\n\\nThis one might be on us. I can't taste the difference between a $60 bottle and a $100 one. (However, I'm told that there isn't always much of a difference.)\\n\\n4. Last, but not least, the interior. Again, the design here reinforces the fact that it's an uppity, great-place-to-prove-you-have-money location. There are some potentially nice touches, but it ultimately speaks to your 60 year-old mother, not your 30 year-old cultural sensibilities. \\n\\nOn the flip side, the service was mighty attentive, the sommelier friendly and sweet, and the frico caldo was fucking amazing. \\n\\n---\\n\\nAs for returning?

Also, how can a patty so thin be grilled so uneven? It was hit & miss of medium then rare bites of Oregon's all natural beef. I couldn't finish it nor the fries. There was a good quantity of them but they weren't anything special.\\n\\nThe plastic covered gazebo was occupied with cheering OSU & Oregon cheerleaders. While Benny Beaver & The Duck were inside the heated gazebo trying to excite the shivering crowd for the anticipated Civil War on Saturday, we were left to sit out in the cold to scarf down our mediocre burgers & fries before they got too cold. :-(\\n\\nThe next time we're in the area & have more time, we'll try one of the sit down restaurants instead.

Are you also looking for something really juicy, cool and refreshing in a cafe? Are you also willing to spend more than usual to get this sandwich and this drink? If you said yes, this place might have your answer. I came here on a busy Friday afternoon to meet up with someone for an appointment. While I was waiting for her, I decided to get something to eat, along with a cool drink. \\n\\nI decided to get a Herb Roasted Lamb sandwich on toasted French bread. This is a roasted lamb sandwich with walnut aioli, roasted tomatoes and arugula. Arugula (Eruca sativa) is a leaf vegetable rich with Vitamin C and potassium with a rich and strong flavor. It is also known as a \\"rocket\\" (no, not the mechanical rockets that fly in the sky) in more sophisticated countries where they speak English as the official language. \\n\\nAfter waiting for less than 10 minutes, I got my sandwich, sat down and began to eat it. After a few bites, I closed my eyes for a few seconds, relaxed and enjoyed the taste of the sandwich. The juicy and tender meat, the flavor of the tomatoes and the arugula, along with the slight crisp of the toasted bread made this a tasty sandwich. It was probably one of the most wonderful and delightful sandwiches I have eaten in a long time. Although it is the most expensive sandwich at $9, it's probably worth spending a couple extra dollars if you want something wonderful and delightful.\\n\\nI also got a Ginger Lemonade, and it was a great complement to the sandwich. It was very cold, refreshing, and had a nice sweet flavor. It was not too sweet, but the flavor was just right, which is almost exactly how I want my lemonade. It is definitely a few marks above the lemonade manufactured and sold in a fine quality supermarket, and significantly better than drinking a carton of Newman's Own Lemonade. This refreshing drink is also great if the weather is more than 30 degrees Celsius outside. \\n\\nSeating is hard to find, especially if the weather is sunny and the temperature is more than 17 degrees Celsius outside on a Friday afternoon. You just have to be lucky, patient and have good timing to get a table. Although the food and drinks are good, the prices are a little high so make sure you have a $20 banknote in your pocket. Atmosphere was a little noisy, so it is not a bad place to meet up with someone, but it could be a little quieter. This place is at a great location within walking distance to Harvard University, which is probably the most sophisticated university in the somewhat decent state of Massachusetts. \\n\\nOverall, if you are looking for a wonderful and delightful sandwich along with a juicy and refreshing drink at a great location, this is actually a great choice. If you are looking for a place to study, it's not a bad choice, but it can be a little noisy and getting a table might be difficult. I believe that this cafe has a lot of potential to be one of the best independent cafes in Cambridge."},{"name":"Blue Star Restaurant","address":"11 Corinth St","city":"Roslindale","stars":"3.5","text":"Finally made it here after living in Roslindale for 2+ years & bummed I hadn't been here sooner.

I finally got to try out this establishment for myself recently and came away pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant is tucked away inside a giant strip mall on Peachtree Industrial Blvd, just south of I-285.  It's in the same shopping plaza that China Inn used to be in.\\n\\nThe restaurant space is one giant rectangle with booths running down both sides and tables in the middle.  Decor is simple, yet elegant.  Small chandeliers hang from above, tablecloth dining with real flowers at each table.  The booths on the north wall have extra furnishings and decorations including artwork and individual lamps.  At dinnertime, most parties are seated in one of the booths.\\n\\nDuring the evening hours, these guys bring candlelit ambiance to a whole 'nother level.  You're almost literally dining in nothing but candlelight.  It was so hard for us to see when we first entered the restaurant.  When I took pictures of the food (as I normally do), I felt like the flash on my camera was lighting up the entire place.  After our meal was over and our eyes had adjusted, I still thought it was too dark.  I'd actually like to be able to see the food I'm about to eat!  They just need to turn up the interior lighting a tad.\\n\\nThe restaurant serves about 70 or so different selections of Indian cuisine including biryani (meats cooked with aromatic basmati rice and flavored with saffron) and tandoori (meats roasted in an open-top clay oven).  Most of the entrees are priced around $9 to $15 each.  At lunchtime on weekends (12:00-2:30pm), they offer an all-you-can-eat lunch buffet for only $8.50.  The buffet features about 10 selections and is the best value when dining here.\\n\\nI tried the following:\\nLentil soup\\nPapadam (crispy spicy tortilla) with condiment stand consisting of:\\n - onion chutney, brown tamarind sauce, and green mint sauce\\nNan - puffy bread\\nRaita - yogurt\\nPilaw rice - rice cooked in a seasoned broth\\nChicken Tikka Masala - boneless chicken tandoori (white meat) sauteed in masala gravy with fresh tomatoes\\nChicken Kurma - cooked with very mild spices in creamy sauce\\nMango lassi\\n\\nThe lentil soup was mild, light, and refreshing.  It had little bits of green vegetables in it.  The papadam was great.  One order comes with 3 delicate, extra crispy \\"tortillas.\\"  The papadam was infused with spices so it had a small bite to it.  The condiments had strong flavors and we liked them so much we asked our server to leave the condiments on our table after we were finished with the papadam so we could eat them with our rice and nan bread.\\n\\nThe nan was fantastic.  It had been freshly baked and was huge and puffy.  It was overflowing from the plate it was served on.  Soft and pleasant texture.  The raita yogurt proved perfect for cooling off our tastebuds in between bites.  It went well with everything (carbs and proteins).  I loved the pilaw rice as it was fluffy and aromatic.  Almost addictive.\\n\\nBoth the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Chicken Kurma were made from white meat chicken.  The best thing about these dishes were the gravy sauces the meats were cooked in.  Full of spices and seasonings, so a lot of flavor.  The Chicken Tikka Masala can be prepared as spicy as you'd like it.  The sauce was a deep burnt orange and a little tangy thanks to the fresh chunks of tomatoes.  It's one of the restaurant's most popular dishes.\\n\\nI preferred the Chicken Kurma, one of my favorite Indian dishes, because of it's rich, slightly sweet, creamy sauce (light brown in color).  Some cuts of chicken were more tender than others, but as a whole, these dishes were very good and I recommend both of them.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a good drink to try, definitely order a lassi.  Lassi is a yogurt-based drink that is also mixed with Indian spices.  Himalayas has 3 flavors: plain, mango, and cherry.  I tried the mango lassi and it was superb.  Ice cold and nice and thick.  Once you start gulping it down, you can't stop.  Seriously.\\n\\nService was interesting.  One of the servers saw us headed towards the restaurant from the parking lot, so he grabbed some menus and opened the door for us to welcome us in.  Most, if not all, of the servers here are big time upsellers.  After I ordered the entrees, the server asked us if we wanted any bread.  Before we could even answer, he mumbled, \\"Papadam would be good. OK?\\"  Then he briskly walked away.  They were also hard sellers on the mango lassi and dessert.\\n\\nI overheard one server taking away an empty wine glass from the table behind us and then trying to convince those customers to have more wine.  One of the customers replied, \\"What are you trying to do? Turn us into alcoholics?!\\"  That was funny.  So, the upselling was annoying, but the rest of the service was good.  The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and the servers were attentive to our needs."},{"name":"Via Napoli","address":"EPCOT World Showcase - Italian Pavilion, 1510 Avenue of the Stars","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"It's the little things that make me grateful.

What really irks me is the kids that study there and take up valuable table space when all their doing is sipping on an almost-empty drink. \\n\\nThe thing I really like about Crema is that, if you are craving something that isn't on the menu, they'll make it for you. I tend to get a sprout, tomato, lettuce and cheese sandwich on foccacia and it's really good. The chips really aren't worth the extra dollar if you are into salty chips because these definitely lack salt to the point where a salt shaker can't even help you. The ginger lemonade is really good (especially if you are nauseous, as I was last time I went here). I've eaten here with meat-eaters and vegetarians and the consensus is that the food is consistently good.

I came with a large group for the breakfast special Bon's is best known for. I didn't know bacon costs extra now. That was news to me. I also didn't know right away because I didn't even look at the menu. I walked in knowing what I wanted. One of our group is an admitiddly picky eater so she asked if she could have the special but with just potatoes and toast. \\"Sure!\\" I like how they're always cool with people substituting and customizing their orders. I had the breakfast special with bacon, eggs over medium, and rye toast. On one side of my eggs there was a bit that was kinda rubbery but the yolk was cooked just right. The rye toast I had must have been from near the end of the loaf because the pieces were quite small so they gave me an extra one. Overall, everything was good. Everyone else was happy with their food too. It's cheap diner food so you don't come here expecting the greatest quality but it's good for hangover brunch and some coffee or even a cheap pint. Just so you know that if you come in with 6 or more people they will automatically put it into one bill. We couldn't understand the writing when we got it so we brought it to the front and had Bon help us sort out our payment and he was cool. The only problem we had was that we sat there for a really, really long time before we were able to stop someone and ask if we could order. There was a bunch of us so I'm sure they noticed a big group appear. I also don't like the dirty feel of the place but apparently that hasn't been enough of an issue to prevent me from returning for the occasional cheap breakfast after a night out."},{"name":"Queen of Sheba","address":"2413 NE Martin Luther King Jr Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We went to Queen o' Sheba tonight, mostly because we saw on their website that they can prepare gluten free vegan injera upon phone request.

They forgot to sub beans so I had rice, but it was actually pretty good this time. \\n\\nAnd my burrito? That was FREAKIN' fantastic!! Seriously! It wasn't at all spicy but was flavorful and delicious. \\n\\nBecause the dreadful enchilada sauce featured so heavily in my first review, I wanted a side of it to try.

I ordered a chile relleno and tamale, which came with a side of refried beans and rice. One bite of beans (bland), one bite of rice (even more bland). I wasn't impressed. \\n\\nAt this point I accidentally got some of the \\"enchilada sauce\\" on my fork. Dreadful. It tasted like plain canned tomato sauce with a dash of cumin and chili powder. Inedible. \\n\\nI scraped the sauce off the tamale and ate three bites, but it had a strange metallic taste to it. \\n\\nAt this point I was starving and downed the chile relleno, sauce and all. It was small compared to other places but would have been very good, minus that ever present sauce. \\n\\nWhen the server asked how everything was, I told him (politely) that it really was the worst enchilada sauce ever. He proceeded to sit down in my booth opposite of me and scrape the food around with my (used) fork. I think only my shocked by expression stopped him from tasting the food on my plate!\\n\\nThe manager stopped by to apologize and thank me for my feedback, apparently someone else had a similar response.

I could tip the pizza over and the butter came sliding off. I also felt the prices here were great. For a specialty pizza it was only $9.00.

We were finally successful during a relatively slow season (first week of September) and at a particularly off time (4:10 PM).  Suffice it to say, our expectations were very high.\\n\\nThings did not start well.  As usual, the check-in line was very long, worse than anything I've ever seen at Cinderella's Royal Table.  We finally made it to the front around 4:20 PM and were told to wait on the bridge leading into Beast's castle for our beeper to be called.  After a 15-minute wait, we started seeing some of the parties who were in front of us get called.  Then we started to see parties who were behind us get called.  After another 10 minutes, we approached the hostess who was blocking the entrance at the front gate to find out what was wrong.  She called to the back and told us to stand by.  After another 5 minutes, she called to the back again to find out what was going on.  At the same time, a party that had been buzzed started to complain that they had waited over 10 minutes for someone to escort them into the restaurant.  After yet another 5 minutes, the manager appeared to find out what our problem was.  We got one sentence out explaining we had been waiting for almost 40 minutes and then our beeper coincidentally went off and a hostess called our name to seat us.  The manager simply stated there wasn't a problem and pointed towards the waiting hostess without offering any apology.\\n\\nNote that, due to all the hype, Be Our Guest is essentially a ride with a stand-by line of 15-30 minutes.  Unlike most other rides at WDW, the queue for this one has absolutely no shade.  So standing on that bridge for 30 minutes in the summer at the hottest time of the day isn't exactly a pleasant experience.  They do have a partially-shaded area between the front gate and the main doors, but you are only allowed back there once your beeper has been called.\\n\\nThe hostess who led us to our table wasn't much better.  She told us we had waited so long because they had a trainee calling tables, and she must have skipped us.  Then, as she walked us through the main dining room, where we saw many of the couples who checked in after us, she seated us in the Library (probably the most vanilla of the three dining rooms) and tried to convince us this was the best dining room of the three because it is so quiet.  Between the manager's cavalier attitude, and the hostess lying to us in an attempt to make us feel better, my wife's attitude bordered on fuming.  We were finally seated just after 5:00 PM.  One thing that stood out in the Library that I didn't quite understand was the number of empty tables, especially considering how many people were waiting outside.\\n\\nIt seems that the entire check-in process has too many moving parts.  There were four cast members up front handing out beepers.  Then there is the hostess guarding the gate who takes your beeper when it is called.  Some mysterious person inside the building is doing the actual activation of the beepers.  Finally, a series of other hostesses are dispatched to call your name and escort you to your table.  Obviously, as our experience shows (and those of other patrons; see above and below), there are too many places where information can get lost, especially during peak hours when things get more frantic.\\n\\nI normally don't call out our servers by name, but Aura was great.  As I said above, my wife was fuming, and she wasn't very pleasant during Aura's first few stops at our table.  However, Aura was a trooper and kept the charm up throughout our meal and eventually won my wife over.  Her attention to detail during the entire service was spot on.\\n\\nThe meal itself was mixed.  I had the strip steak.  It was cooked a perfect medium and was accompanied with green beans and fries.  The fries were awesome, probably some of the best steak fries I've ever had -- crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and seasoned just right.  My wife had the chicken, and while she thought it was good, she didn't think it was anything special (as I said before, our expectations for Be Our Guest were very high).\\n\\nThe desserts at dinner are nothing special: a choice of three cupcakes and three cream puffs.  The best part is the tableside presentation, but the desserts themselves were average.  I had the lemon merengue cupcake, and while tasty, there was nothing memorable about it.\\n\\nJust as we were finishing, a family was seated next to us.  Shortly thereafter, a different manager came over and started apologizing profusely to them that they had to wait so long for a table.  At least that manager had better customer service skills than the one we dealt with.  But again, it shows there is a systemic problem at Be Our Guest related to getting guests through the check-in process and seated.\\n\\nBottom line, we won't be going out of our way to return any time soon."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"If you can get in for lunch or dinner, take it.\\n\\nLouder than you might like, the food is good.\\nLunch is one of two Quick Serve locations in WDW that have self serve soft drinks with refills (Electric Umbrella, EPCOT)"},{"name":"Spare Room Restaurant and Lounge","address":"4830 NE 42nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Whether its for a good stiff drink at a reasonable price, breakfast all day, or some of the very best cheeseburgers in town, the Spare Room is one of Portland's best bars when it comes to food and events!

However, I was generally unimpressed with the food. Just average, not spectacular, but I did grow up having hot pot in Taiwan and at home with my Taiwanese parents, so maybe my standards are a little high.\\n\\nA fair word of warning, after eating here, everything you own will smell like hotpot. I put my coat in my closet and laid on my bed for a bit after returning from my first time here and did 5 loads of laundry the next day because literally everything in my room reeked of hotpot. That aside...\\n\\nThe spicy broth is VERY spicy, and if you eat one of the chilis they put in it, your mouth will go numb. It's worth trying once for the experience. I find that mixing the two broths is the way to go to protect your stomach from eating its way out of your body.\\n\\nI wish the portions, especially the vegetables, were a bit larger. It is on the pricier side for hot pot.\\n\\nMy biggest complaint is that they don't have the normal dipping sauces that I've come to expect with my hotpot, which I think detracts from the taste of the meats significantly.

Everything tasted really good and was the perfect late night snack after a night at the theater."},{"name":"Teatro","address":"177 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My experience at Teatro last weekend was a mixed bag, but in all, I would probably not recommend the restaurant.  There were three specific complaints that I had about my experience that combined to sour my opinion of Teatro.\\n\\nThe first complaint is regarding the service.  My fianc√© and I walked in and waited at the host stand behind another gentleman.  We had reservations and were there right on time.  While the hostess was helping this gentleman, another couple walked in and stood next to us.  While the hostess was seating other gentleman's party, someone else from the restaurant staff (unclear what his position was) came over, completely ignored us - despite the fact that we were clearly next to be seated - and seated the other couple.  I suspect it had a lot to do with appearance - the other couple was older than us and dressed much more fancily.  We certainly weren't underdressed, and I really can't abide by restaurants that make assumptions about the quality of my business based on my age/appearance.\\n\\nThe second complaint is regarding the portion size/value.  They offer two portions for each of their pasta dishes - appetizer and entree.  My fianc√© ordered a pasta dish (the squash tortellini) as a main course, but forgot to specify the portion size.  When his dish arrived, I actually assumed that they had given him the appetizer portion, which seemed fine because we had both gotten appetizers and I had only ordered a pizza for my main course.  Why did I make this assumption?  Because his dish had just 7 tortellini.  (Yes I counted.)  I was quite unhappy when we received the bill and I realized that this was the entree portion.  Seven vegetarian tortellini for $20 is just not an acceptable value in my opinion.\\n\\nMy third complaint is around the representation of their menu items compared to what is actually served.  For the appetizer, we ordered the buffala mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes.  While the mozzarella was legit and truly delicious, the tomatoes were about one-third heirloom and about two-thirds beefsteak.  It was still good, but it wasn't what we ordered and expected.  The much more disappointing experience was dessert.  I purposefully saved room for dessert (hence the main course pizza) because I had noticed that there was gelato on the menu.  So I ordered vanilla and chocolate gelato for dessert.  What I was served was not gelato.  It was ice cream, Breyers-style.  It was quite a disappointment.  They're just not the same product, and certainly a restaurant that bills itself as Italian should know they are serving ice cream as opposed to gelato; either they're purposefully misleading customers with the misnomer, or they are ignorant as to the difference.\\n\\nA few highlights - the food was quite good for the most part.  My fianc√© got the truffle fries and squash tortellini and enjoyed both.  My pizza (sausage, caramelized onions, rabe) was delicious.  And our service once we were seated was perfectly acceptable.  Still, on the whole, I can't recommend Teatro and will not be returning."},{"name":"La Scala","address":"4199 W Dublin Granville Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"3.5","text":"My husband and I made reservations several days ahead of time to eat here last Saturday for an early Valentine's Day dinner.

There was no music playing in this section and although the room was mostly empty it was extremely loud as there were a couple large parties. Although there were several tables that were more secluded and private we were seated directly next to a large party who was extremely loud, to the point we couldn't really even have our own conversation. We considered asking to be moved, however, no one ever came to help us. A person came and brought us water but did not say hello, or speak to us at all.

We ate at several of the Epcot restaurants, both quick and table service. Of the table service places, we went to Les Chefs de France, Biergarten, Akershus, La Hacienda de San Angel, and Via Napoli. Via Napoli is definitely the best of them, followed by Les Chefs de France in a pretty close second.\\n\\nI am the trip planner between my wife and me, and I planned most of the dining. (I'm also much more of a foodie than she is, though.) I had each meal except for the last two days planned, and had reservations for each of the meals that we could get a reservation. I left the last two nights open (of a 10 night trip) just in case we came across some places that we wanted to try that we didn't know much about. While I knew about the table service establishments in the Italy pavilion, my wife is 50% Italian on her mother's side, and so she grew up with home-made authentic Italian. Thus, places like Olive Garden, Carrabba's, etc., are absolutely out of the question - even if classified as a \\"new\\" Italian-American cuisine. I assumed the Italy restaurants were somewhat similar, and decided to steer clear of them.\\n\\nWhile there, my wife suggested trying Via Napoli because she had read their pizza was really good. I was surprised, but certainly agreed. The reservations were a bit difficult, but we found one on the last night we were there for 9:15, and one the night before for 8:30. I took both, and we decided we'd figure it out when it got closer. \\n\\nWe went to the 8:30 reservation. We got a half margherita, half pepperoni pizza. It was absolutely delicious. I was completely stunned at the quality of the ingredients and of the pizza as a whole. I had to remind myself I was in Florida... not Naples. We also got the tiramisu for dessert, which was also delicious. Plus... the prices are not horrible at all. With a substantial tip and tax, the two of us ate for only about $50. And believe me... we were very full.\\n\\nWe loved it so much that, we actually decided to go to the 9:15 reservation the next night as well. This time we were feeling a bit hungrier because the day had been cooler than the previous, and we got the calamari appetizer. It was cooked perfectly. The cornmeal dredge was perfect - not too thick, but enough to crisp up nicely. The marinara was great as well, spicy enough. I also got the Italian beer flight, which had three different Italian beers; one of which was actually a micro-brew that was infused with grapes. It tasted like a cross between beer and wine. It was pretty good. Then we got the same thing as the night before: half margherita/half pepperoni pizza. It did not disappoint and was just as delicious as the night before. I wasn't able to eat my entire half, because I wanted another tiramisu.\\n\\nBoth servers that we had were fantastic. The second evening we had Domenico, who was great. He was very talkative and talked with us about Epcot, and Italy, etc. It was great.\\n\\nVia Napoli is, in my opinion, the best restaurant in Epcot - which, I would argue very likely makes it the best restaurant in WDW by default. We did not have any entree other than the pizza... but the deliciousness of this pizza alone puts it at the top. Add the service, appetizers, ambience, desserts, drinks, etc., it definitively is above the rest.

We ordered the turkey sandwich, roast beef sandwich, passion fruit puff and strawberry cupcake.  Both sandwiches were fresh and very decent sized portion, on French baguettes.  The passion fruit puff had a bit too much filling for me but was very well done (not too tangy, not too sweet).\\n\\nThere's tons of seating and the wait (about 10 min for us) wasn't bad.  It's nice of them to provide umbrellas to guests who are waiting outside and even nicer that the servers cart right to your table to serve the food; it definitely adds to the experience.  I shoved everything so fast in my mouth (literally, I mean I think I ate within 1 minute) that I had serious indigestion.

I've tried a quesadilla and a burrito and they weren't bad by any means they were just missing something.  Based off of these visits it deserves my rating of a 3. \\n\\nThe most recent time i visited however was much much better.  I ordered the nachos which is on the appetizer part of the menu but it's definiately more than i could eat by myself.

Next time I would probably ask for no lettuce since half of the nachos were buried underneath a huge pile of it.  Key words in that last sentence: \\"next time.\\"  Yes, I will definately try Lime again and its not just because its walking distance from where I work but the food was much better and the sevice was *AWESOME*.

I was quite excited about Kaju opening up at Harvard Sq, because I heard good things about the location in Allston. I've visited here more than once, and both times I walked away with disappointment. \\n\\nTo start off, the restaurant is huge, but the poor interior design was a big turn-off for me. There are a few booths by the windows and more round and rectangular tables in the center of the room. I didn't particularly like the set up of the restaurant. It seemed a bit disordered and could be organized much better. \\n\\nThe banchan (side dishes) was interesting, not in a good way. Some dishes were not the traditional banchan that I'm used to. One of them had three pieces of broccoli. Yes you read that right! Pickled broccoli. I was not expecting that lol. The overall quality of the banchan was subpar.\\n\\nThe menu has a large variety of soft tofu soup. It is called a \\"tofu house\\" after all. I like that you can customize you soup with different levels of spiciness. The soup comes in a steaming hot stone pot, with an egg on the side. I like the idea of cracking an egg into the soup myself. However, the problem is that, the soup, although still hot, stops bubbling and cooking very quickly. So I usually end up with a semi-raw egg in my soup, which I don't enjoy. \\n\\nThe service is just okay. The restaurant isn't as busy as BonChon or some other restaurants in the area, so I expected the staff to be a little more attentive. \\n\\nThe restaurant can get pretty loud during dinner time. Last time I was here, there was a large group sitting in the center of the room, drinking soju bombs and got quite noisy and obnoxious. The staff did nothing to make them quiet down just a little, so the other patrons could enjoy their meals.

All in all, by the time we sat down at our table it was about 20 min past our reservation time.\\n\\nWhen we got to the ordering kiosk someone in our party had a food allergy. Now, this is what made this entire experience exceptional. The person I was with was allergic to carrots and apples (she ordered the quinoa salad- no too difficult). The person taking our order paged the head chef and alerted him of the allergy. About 2 minutes later Chef David emerged from the kitchen, spoke to my friend about her food allergy and insisted that it would be no problem to prepare her food safely. After that we were told to find a table. It wasn't too difficult to find a table, the restaurant is made up of 3 separate rooms and you can  sit wherever you please. \\n\\nOur food came out very quickly and was delicious. My friend who had the food allergy had a separate waiter come out and bring her food and make sure she was all set. The food was delicious!

They will not give you that shit, period. I don't care if you are Trump or Obama they will absolutly not give you the sauce you ask for, even if you freely admit you are happy to pay for it, it's not happening, ever. Lest we forget they will look at you like you are deformed when you point out they did not give you what you asked for.

So much so that I joined yelp exclusively to write this one single review. At this point they have posted signs saying you can only get sauce if you order nuggets or strips, in essence if you enjoy sauce with your fries you are not welcome.

I've been looking everywhere in and around ATL to find a real Chicken Finger Sub (CFS to all my Buffalonians) and real Buffalo style pizza. The good news is these things are on the menu. The bad news is they just aren't that good.\\n\\nLet's start with the CFS. The bread is all wrong. There is nothing worse than a CFS with a bready roll. It's def no Jim's or even a Mike's. It actually reminds me of a Wegmans CFS, which sounds like it would be good, but even the almighty Wegmans can do wrong, and CFS' are one of them. If you're from Buffalo you're nodding you're head. If you're not, just disregard this paragraph, you will never find a decent CFS outside of Buffalo.\\n\\nNow for the pizza. For everyone complaining about it being too cheesy and greasy, that's the point. Let me give you a little lesson: Buffalo sits in the middle between NYC and Chicago. Our pizza is a hybrid of the two, very thick, very cheesy, generous with toppings, but not a deep dish. It sits somewhere in the middle. It's not easy to make and probably more expensive to make than the thin crust barely anything on it pizzas around here.\\n\\nBut even after all that, I still don't think Galla's pizza is up to par. It's not bad, but it's nothing special. My hopes were too high."},{"name":"Clyde Common","address":"1014 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This restaurant seems to capture the essence of Portland's quirkiness and youthfulness (in a hipster, socially cool kind of way).  Key is the long communal wood dining table extending across the length of the front window: perfect for diners to mingle with new acquaintances (and old) and to people watch, as well as to be seen.  Carrying over from its adjacent neighboring Ace Hotel, it's a minimalist atmosphere, complete with a rather industrial looking open kitchen.  You get the basics with no frills, from the dinnerware to the decor.  \\n\\nBut once you peruse the cocktail and dinner menu you realize this is no ordinary place; it abounds with thoughtfulness and creativity.  After all, how many restaurants these days are willing to put a deviled offal entree on their menu?  While I was intrigued (after recently learning about offal on an episode of Top Chef) I played it safe with the grilled trout ($19).  The trout came out whole (heads attached on anything isn't normally a big plus for me, but I'm working on my adaptability), well cooked and with a delicious date-almond stuffing.  It was accompanied by herbed couscous.  I ordered a side vegetable dish ($4) of summer squash (a personal favorite and something I miss living in Texas) and zucchini.  My dining companion seemed a bit jealous of my beautiful-in-appearance bright yellow summer squash but thanks to the generous portion I was able to share it with her.\\n\\nI had a difficult time deciding on one of the several interesting cocktails choices, but settled on Black Dog ($8) since its main ingredient reminded me of my recent trip to Brazil (cachaca, lemon, apricot preserves, egg whites, angostura bitters).  It came in a martini glass and made me feel ultra cool while I quenched my thirst and chatted up the friendly twenty-something attired in tweed, dining beside me.\\n\\nI would give this 5 stars, but minus one star for the snobby host (who could care less if you eat here or not).  \\n\\nTip: Definately you should make reservations ahead of time here, yes even for Sunday and Monday nights, and ask ahead for the communal table if you want to get the whole experience."},{"name":"Hon's Wun-Tun House","address":"1339 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"It's good, cheap Chinese food.

Service is fairly quick and courteous.\\n\\nI ordered the Smoked Green Chili Burger ($9) with a side of Texas Tumbleweed ($2.5)\\n\\nI was overwhelmed how dry and bland the first bite was.  The caramelized onions were a nice thought but entirely too thin--like dental floss thin.  I tried a bite of the patty alone and couldn't pick up any chili or smokiness.  In fact, it was flavorless and dry.  The avocado-ranch spread was almost undetectable.  I understand that part of healthy eating is cutting back on sodium but c'mon... there has to be enough salt to pick up flavors properly.  I doused the burger in their homemade chipotle ketchup and it was much more edible.  I thought the portion was on the small side and was still hungry after finishing.\\n\\nThe Texas Tumbleweed was not a good choice in hindsight.  It was a total mess and crumbled at every touch.  Tasted like the small bits at the bottom of the fryer basket.  Wish I would have tried their regular fries or yucca.\\n\\nI have so much hope for this place so I'll be back soon to give it another try."},{"name":"The Mission Bar & Grill","address":"724 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I frequent this bar/ restaurant 2-3 times a week.

I ate til I was full and then I ate some more.\\n\\nWhen I took a break and walked to the men's room, I stopped in wild wonder at the funny-looking, exquisitely carved stone-faced fire gods whose mouths serve as the opening to the grill.

We got the Croque Madame, Vegetable Quiche, and Croissant Donut. All of which came with an assortment of complimentary pastries. The entrees definitely were not worth the price tag. They lacked flavor and some parts of the dish tasted kind of weird. The only entree that was decent was the Croque Madame, which was basically an open faced ham sandwich. The pastries were ok. Again, some tasted good, while others tasted horrible. I'm not sure who's cooking all these breakfasts, but they need to step it up in this department. Coffee and other beverages were self serve, but were also bland and underwhelming. \\n\\nOtherwise, the atmosphere in this restaurant is what makes it worth coming here. There are three rooms. When you immediately walk in, you're entering the Grand ballroom. The glistening chandeliers and murals of the sky are the focus of this room. On the far end of the room, there's a simulated window displaying falling snow. All the while, music from Beauty in the Beast was playing so that you feel like you're in the movie. We sat in this room because it was the largest room. We later visited the other 2 rooms: the West Wing and Rose Gallery. \\n\\nI loved the West Wing because it housed the enchanted rose that, in the movie, was losing its petals because time was running out for the Beast. There was also a painting of the Prince that was slashed partly by the Beast. My sister was able to see the portrait change to the Beast when we heard lightning sounds. The Rose Gallery was a confusing name because the rose in the room wasn't immediately apparent. It was stated by others that theres a stain glassed rose located on the light fixture above the Beast and Belle dancing music box in the center of the room. Otherwise, this room mainly displayed several portraits of Belle and the Beast together in beautiful moments, and of the other characters in Beasts castle. \\n\\nOverall, come here for the wonderful atmosphere.

Perhaps they were a premix? Who knows. But it wasn't happyhour so they sure should have been better. Anyway my wife mentioned it to the bar tender. He was very agressive to my wife and accused us of letting the ice in our drinks melt - at that point we had been there for 10 minutes, and had had the drinks for even less time, and needless to say, there was hardly any ice in the drinks in the first place.

My husband and I went there for dinner using the Groupon deal. We had two dinners and a bottle of wine. The salad bar wasn't the best in the world, but at these prices, who wants to fill up on salad? This is not a salad centered place. They don't advertise as a place where you will go and eat a bunch of salad. If you want an awesome salad bar, go somewhere that promises an extensive awesome salad bar. This isn't your place and that's ok. You go here to eat a lot of meat. And you can eat a lot of meat here. And it's delicious meat, fresh grilled, served at whatever temperature you request. They even give you coasters that indicate what doneness you prefer so you aren't making requests with every server you interact with. It's quality meat that is charred on the outside, tender on the inside, and buttery, with a decent fat content that is common in high end cuts of meat that just melts into the meat and is never chewy or problematic. It's yumminess.\\n\\nWe went right after they opened for dinner and even though the place was empty, our server was attentive without being around too much, every type of meat on the menu was brought out quickly, at a good pace. The chimmichurri and the hotter red sauce were very good. Not that the meat really needed a sauce. The bread was also hot and fresh and pillowy and wonderful. \\n\\nThe wine selection is an entire menu itself. If you use a Groupon you are allowed a bottle up to $30, of which there are an abundance. If you choose a bottle over $30 you pay the difference. All bills are charged an 18% gratuity based on menu prices regardless of what you actually pay using Groupon, coupon or whatever. This is not only fair, but also should be expected. It's customary to tip based on full menu prices even you pay at a discount. The server does the same amount of work regardless of what coupons you use. \\n\\nI'm sure there may better places out there, but they aren't on Groupon and two adults won't eat and have an entire bottle of great wine at other places for the approximately $60 we spent by using the Groupon and paying the tips and taxes due at dinner.

I'll start off saying their food is good, usually pretty quick, chips and salsa are amazing, and margaritas are on point. It's our spot. We love going to Los P's. I give 3 stars instead of 2 because of that. However, I've recently become very disappointed in the lack of customer service, especially for a frequent patron. Sunday night I tried to call in a to-go order, but the background noise was so loud they couldn't hear me so I drove by to order to-go. After a 35 minute wait, which was abnormal, the waiter swiped my card and then proceeded to another computer to swipe it again. I pulled up my bank account and told him it already charged but he insisted he had to swipe it again to get the receipt. Needless to say, the next morning I was double charged. I went back that night to get my refund. I was told no one there that night could help me and that I would \\"probably get my money back\\" but to \\"come back in a few days.\\" Literally that was the first answer I got. I had to push to get a manager on the phone, and they called the owner who told me to leave my name and number and come back in 2 nights for the refund. So I did. I came back as he said, and he wasn't there and so they said they could not issue the refund and I'd have to come back again the next night. Again, I had to push to get the owner to do the right thing. They got him on the phone with me and almost made me go to the other location, which I refused to do. He finally authorized them to give me cash back. I did not get apologies, only excuses - They had new machines, the owner was called over to the other location (which if that were the case, he had my number and should have called me so I didn't take the time to come that night), they can't just issue a refund because of the books. Etc etc. I am disappointed with the lack of customer service the owner sets forth for his establishments to say the least, especially because they know we come there frequently. I said they could give it to me in a gift card- I didn't care! I just couldn't just keep coming back night after night begging for them to refund my rightful money that they took. The whole situation was handled very unprofessionally. They were not rude to me, and the waitresses really tried to do their best. I think the waitresses hands were tied. It's the owner who should have a better system in place for customer relations and train his workers how to better handle these types of situations. It'll be awhile if I go back.

First, it was advertised as a dinner show but all that meant was that they had a special menu for that night (for an additional cost). When we arrived 10 minutes early, the place was already jam-packed but we found two seats on the wall. We asked a waitress who was near to come take our drink order and she nodded yes, but she then went to a different table and did not come to take our order. I went to the bar to order instead and was not acknowledged for several minutes. Once I was acknowledged by a different waitress and not the bartender I was told to sit down and they would bring us drinks. 10 minutes later we had drinks but the wrong ones. We ordered 2 more times and had the same experiences each time. When I go to the bar to order at a place it is so that I may get my drink more quickly. I don't appreciate waiting at the bar for at least 6 minutes to only be told to sit down and it will be brought to me. Lastly, the show was supposed to be from 6-8, and they stopped at 735!! Also, at one point Ms. King brought her drummer up to play and the energy was raised dramatically. It seemed that the guitarist was offended by this and asked that her drummer be allowed to return. If it raised the energy, why refuse it--isn't that what you'd want as an owner!?

I've been searching for some authentic mexican and/or central american and thankfully I found Taco Loco, only a few minutes drive from my house!\\n\\n\\nThe food is *authentic*, which means you won't see Chipotle-type things on the menu...sorry to one of the previous reviewers, but why would you ever walk into an authentic mexican place and think they are going to have all sorts of vegetarian options or familiar items you'd find at a Chipotle????? (Chipotle is owned by McDonalds!!! Ew!!)\\n\\nOf course, the staples are rice and beans, but you will also get some delicious carne or pollo asado, chicharrones, etc etc etc... all authentic, all delicious. My favorite thing on the menu is \\"vegetarian\\" ... a pupusa queso y frijol....basically a corn tortilla stuffed with beans and cheese. I put vegetarian in quotes because most beans are cooked in animal fats - their black beans might not be, but good refried beans are almost always good because they are made with lard.  \\n\\nTheir rice is amazing - get some hot sauce for extra bite!\\n\\nTacos are soft made with corn tortillas - packed with deliciously seasoned meats and cilantro and fresh veggies... guacamole is REAL. If you don't know what that means, go here. You won't be disappointed. \\n\\nThey also have a pupusa made just with cheese and loroco, which is a flower from El Salvador or Guatemala.... those are definitely veggie... and definitely delicious. Pupusas are a common dish in El Salvador. \\n\\n\\nEvery time I go here I am very happy with the service, very happy to watch telemundo and absolutely thrilled to meet people from the central american and mexican communities in the area. Last night we had a nice chat with a couple from San Salvador. I got to speak some Spanish, which I rarely get to do living in Charlestown... \\n\\n\\n \\nValue is outstanding - last night we got one fajita plate with chicken and steak (comes with a bunch of side items, guac, beans, rice, salad), a pupusa and a taco for 13 bucks. Enough for 2 people with leftovers.\\n\\n\\nI hope this place continues to thrive.

There is also a salad bar, which looked pretty appetizing, but I opted for a sandwich. I ordered the zucchini grillini and my wife had the tuna melt. My kids had a mac n cheese and a peanut butter & jelly from the kids' menu. Although we also ordered a soup and one drink, I was surprised that our bill was over $25. Listing everything we ordered here, I felt like the price was steep for what we had.\\n\\nOur food arrived very fast and this was the greatest benefit to the place. My sandwich tasted good, but it was very small. In fact, when it arrived, I was pretty sure they give me some child portion of the sandwich. I immediately wished I had gone to Panera. The good news is that the sandwich tasted pretty good.\\n\\nI also tried my daughter's peanut butter & jelly since she didn't seem to like it and the bread was too dry to eat. The crust was too hard for her to bite into. I don't know if the bread was old or if that's how it always is. I also tried my other daughter's mac n cheese and it was pretty good. She didn't eat much of it though. Another complaint I have is that I ordered a fountain pop and it was so watery I couldn't drink it. I tried the Dr. Pepper and the Coke and didn't finish either one.\\n\\nOn the bright side, my wife enjoyed her tuna melt and french onion soup. She said she would order that again, especially picking it up to go if she was running errands in the area.\\n\\nThey do have free soft serve ice cream for anyone who dines in - both vanilla and chocolate. I wasn't impressed with the ice cream either, but I can see why that would draw all of the families in.

First off this is higher end seafood place so it is not inexpensive. I knew that so I will try not to let it play into my review too much. Oddfish is located on West 1st ave on the corner of Cypress street near Burrard. Parking here sucks, fyi. Luckily I can walk here. This venue is the old Baccano and Smoking dog bistro. Tough spot to survive with the rent and poor parking so we will see if it lasts or not. Renovated nicely inside with some comfy booths and a bunch of tables. I don't know if I would like to be seated and the tables. It seemed crowded to me. This is a very noisy restaurant, which I hate, so I subtracted a  Star for that reason. Its hard to have a conversation but doable, don't talk about anything's by personal. You have to really lean in and talk loudly lol. Service was top notch and fast. No complaints there. The wine list needs work in my opinion. I know it's a seafood joint but us red wine lovers are still gonna drink red even with white fish FYI. I had a hard time finding a great wine. $15/glass for a Syrah than was so so. A few more rich, full bodied and bold wines would be appreciated!  \\n\\nOn to the menu and food. Menu is small, but.... there are additional specials on the board. The change up their vegetable sides as well.  They had the option of a platter for $65, but you don't really know what you are getting.\\n\\nWe started with Himatchi (sashimi). I love sashimi but I wasn't too sure how this would play out with jalape√±o and lime. The himatchi itself was very fresh and high grade. The jalape√±o adds a surprising bite to the fish but is a little overpowering. There was also salt sprinkled on the himatchi and I don't think I was a fan of that. It was also lying in an oil which I felt was unnecessary. I never tasted any lime. Overall I wouldn't order this dish again. \\n\\nNext, we had mussels which were wonderful!! Tons and tons for $18. Priced very fair. Huge and plump and juicy!!! Nice white wine broth. Unfortunately, the baguette or toast or whatever that was was awful. It was burnt on one side and super chewy. I love dipping a nice bread into the tasty broth and this was just not happening. I tried. A few times. And than gave up lol. I'm thinking some nice warm bread would be so much better and simpler. \\n\\nThe vegetable dish was roasted Brussels sprouted with bacon and Parmesan cheese. Wonderful. No complaints. I think it was $18.\\n\\nAlso ordered the seared scallops for $22. Fresh and juicy and cooked nicely. I am not sure what the sauce was but it was alright. Not mind blowing but good. Definitely have to say for $22 this dish is too small. Only 4 scallops (not large size, medium size I would say). If you are going to charge that much make it 6, otherwise throw in some vegetables or something!

Look, in the comfort of our homes we obviously don't use gloves to prepare our food, but at a restaurant... I sort of think it's health code. PLUS phones are full of germs. I was so shocked that I didn't even argue, I had already payed, so I just took my food and left.

The chef I talked with was a nice South African man named Pierre, who chatted with us and told us about the food, how it was prepared, etc.  I asked about \\"caviar lime\\" which was an ingredient in one of the dishes, and he gave me a taste of it.  It was a small black skinned lime.  When you cut it open, you can squeeze out small caviar-like beads that have a lime flavor.  I enjoyed dinner at Jiko so much, I might go back again tomorrow night before I return to California."},{"name":"Rossetti Restaurant","address":"47 Sutton St","city":"Lynn","stars":"4.5","text":"First time tonight, certainly won't be the last.

I recently had the 'Combo Curry Bento' with brown rice. It's essentially comprised of some steamed mixed veggies, some chicken and brown rice covered in a very mild curry sauce. The chicken was soft and tender but I would prefer it be grilled. Veggies were decent (especially when covered in some sauce). The nice thing is, if you want other sauce flavors, they offer several bottles from rooster sauce to peanut sauce that you can add to your food or put in little containers to take with you for later 'saucing'.\\n\\nHaving eaten here before I can say that this establishment, when the line is longer than about 4 people, is very slow.

After scouring menus online to find the best vegetarian options, I decided Clyde Common looked awesome!  So, we headed down for a lovely weekend in Portland with a Saturday night dinner at Clyde Common.  \\n\\nSince they change their menu frequently, and they happened to have only one option that night for a vegetarian entree I just went with it, not really questioning exactly what it was.  First we choose some local Orgeon wines which were delicious, and then had some of the best salads I've ever tried - very simple but balanced with great ingredients.  And then our entrees came.  My bf had the pork which was so good he's been on a pork kick for the last 10 months.  And I had ordered what turned out to be spaghetti with Parmesan and olive oil.  Granted, it was amazing Parmesan and amazing olive oil and the pasta was perfectly cooked, but I couldn't help but feel duped for ordering a whole big portion of something so ridiculously simple.  Our dessert - I believe it was panna cotta - was redeeming and overall, it was a great dinner and I'd go back again.  I just wish they'd had vegetarian options as creative as their meatier plates."},{"name":"Jiko - The Cooking Place - Temporarily Unavailable","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I don't give out 5 stars lightly and I am honored to give Jiko 5 stars. If I could give them 10, I wouldn't hesitate to do so. By far, this has got to be the best restaurant that I have visited......ever. Great food (understatement of the year), great service, beautiful location, it's all there. Long and the short of it, make your reservations, and gooooooo...you will NOT be disappointed.\\n\\nThe Place -\\nJiko is located in Disney's Animal Kingdom Resort on the lower floor and the place is absolutely beautiful. I took pictures of the outside as you approach the main lobby and a picture of the lobby itself. You truly get transported to a different country/world/environment and you almost forget that you're in Florida. As a person who enjoys escaping reality, I REALLY enjoyed the fact that Disney aims to transport individuals to the world that they want to emulate. It's simply amazing. The restaurant itself is very elegant, while I didn't get to tour around the whole dining room since I sat at the bar, I could tell that Jiko was a place of class and that they pride themselves on delivering an authentic feel to their guests. The bar is quite small and if you dine there, you can tend to feel cramped as people arrive to claim their reserved tables since the bar is the first place individuals go to kill time as they wait for their table to get ready. All in all, the environment that Jiko creates is amazing to say the least. Bravo Jiko, bravo.\\n\\nThe Service -\\nI was in town for a Conference so I wanted to make sure I took full advantage of being at Disneyworld. I saw the rave reviews for Jiko and made it a priority to make it the first place I visited while I was in Florida. The first day of the conference concluded around 4:00 and gave me some time to freshen up. When I arrived at Jiko, they had just opened up for dinner service and I approached the hostess table to let them know I was a walk-in. She looked at me as if I was crazy for not making reservations and said that they were all booked for the evening; however, I was more than welcome to sit at the bar. Since I had arrived at the very beginning of dinner service, there was no one at the bar. I quickly took my seat and prepared myself for the ride I was sure to enjoy. The bartender that was my waiter for the evening was very friendly and made it seem as if I was regular at Jiko. Answered all my questions about the menu and made some recommendations. REALLY great service and I have no complaints at all.\\n\\nThe Food -\\nNow, onto the main event....the delicious offerings of Jiko. The menu is very focused only offering a certain amount of dishes. I ALWAYS like to see a focused menu and not pages upon pages of options. It lets me know the Executive Chef has a certain style and wants to stick with it. A lot of the appetizers seemed very appealing; however, I wanted to make sure I saved room for the main entree and dessert as that is what I was more interested in tasting. I started off with a glass of the Jam Jar \\"Sweet\\" Shiraz....a REALLY good wine for those that like to have a sweet flavor profile as this is a REALLY sweet shiraz, as the name implies (See Pictures). Absolutely delicious and refreshing. For my main entree, I chose to go with the Spicy Botswana Style \\"Seswaa\\" Beef Short Ribs (See Picture). It was served with a cassava-potato puree, sambal, mushrooms, and fava beans. I've had quite a few short rib dishes during my food adventures and I have to say that Jiko has now taken the spot on my list as THE best short rib dish I've ever had! It was absolutely delicious and I HIGHLY recommend it! The short ribs were very tender and fell apart as my fork cut through it like butter. The accompanying spices, sauce, and other accoutrements made for an EXCELLENT flavor profile, texture, and gave it a little kick in the right direction. I TRULY enjoyed this dish and can only WISH I could have it again. Following the greatness of the short rib dish, I expected the dessert to not disappoint either and I was right! The \\"Coffee & Doughnuts\\" dessert was REALLY good and a very innovative take on the traditional duo. The \\"coffee\\" portion of the dessert was presented in the form of a Kenyan Coffee & Amarula Creme Brulee and the \\"doughnuts\\" portion came in the form of 3 cake koeksisters dusted with cinnamon and served with a creme anglaise (See Picture). The creme brulee was creamy and delicious with the prominent coffee flavor. The doughnuts were crispy, light, fluffy, had a great taste with the cinnamon dusted on, and was just that much more delicious with the creme anglaise. Truly an EXCELLENT meal!\\n\\nOverall -\\nBefore I reach the character limit for writing a review, I just wanted to keep it simple. GO TO JIKO!! You will NOT be disappointed! Enjoy!"},{"name":"Bakersfield","address":"733 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"You like tacos and Mexican food a great place to dine out. Try the spicy margaritas they are good.

When we first walked in, we were seated pretty quickly as the place was not very crowded even though it wasn't very big. Even though we were seated quickly, it took a little while for someone to come take our order. Besides this delay, it was actually decent service, not very common at Indian restaurants.\\n\\nThe menu was pretty standard fare, although there were some interesting spellings of some items. We ended up ordering the dinner portions of a couple of entrees, malai kofta and sag paneer along with garlic naan and the onion bhaji appetizer. The dinner portions come with soup and raita.\\n\\nWhen the soup came, it was way too hot to eat right away and both of us scalded our tongues trying it. It was basically a lentil soup and once it cooled down and we were able to eat it, it was ok, but nothing special. The onion bhaji appetizer was a lot bigger that we thought, it was almost like a blooming onion except it was shredded onion that had been deep fried. It was also ok, but nothing special.\\n\\nThe entrees were better than we expected. We had ordered medium spicy, but when we tried the entrees, they were a little spicier than we expected. It was still pretty good though.\\n\\nAll in all, we didn't have very high expectations of Himalayas and only went because of the Scoutmob and we wanted to try it out since some other friends had told us it was good.

The small stone interior is charming and feels authentic for those who have ventured to holes in the wall abroad in Italy. \\n\\nThe meals are moderately priced for the home-style Italian food. It may not be the most creative Italian fare, but then again, Italian food is about the ingredients, and in true Italian style-- these are always fresh and delicious. I have had several dishes at Artu (I'm a loyal Patron). The Antipasti appetizer is enormous for two, and is done well with excellent meats and a variety of Mediterranean goodness. From the light yet satisfying Shrimp Scampi to the plentiful classic eggplant Parmesan, all the dishes brim over the plate in taste, flavor and portions.\\n\\nThe hostess at times has an Italian-mother no-fuss attitude (like the menu) You won't be fooled over your wait time, although I've rarely waited for a table at Artu. As a patron, be smart about going a little earlier to enjoy a good meal, then head out for drinks afterwards. It's a small place so clearly it fills up quickly. Great for a small group of friends (3-4) or a duo. \\n\\nLastly, after trying out the Artu in the North End, I would say, if you're looking for truer, plain good satisfying Italian food with no fuss, go for Artu on Beacon Hill.

A few friends and I wandered in recently for an early afternoon breakfast and booze.  There were a couple people standing at the bar and several tables had people, but the place was mostly empty (it was a weekday).  After trying to discern if we were supposed to have someone seat us or seat ourselves (a huge pet peeve of mine) we finally sat ourselves at a booth, and waited.  Then waited some more.  Does anybody work in this fucking place?  There were no apparent servers on the floor.  After about 10 minutes we thought we'd be proactive and grabbed some menus off another table, that way when someone did show up we'd be ready to order.

But how this place is going to survive is beyond me.  Jopa was at least an alternative in this part of town to other burger places, but I don't see much with Joe's to be optimistic about.  The burger menu is actually pretty short for a place with burger in the name, the pizza is exactly that same as Jopa's (also nothing special), then some tacos options (didn't try, but probably will next time, if we go back).  The atmosphere is kind of weird (dark, alot of black, bad 80s rock) and definitely not as comfortable as Jopa (they took out the booths).  I just don't get it, they said Jopa wasn't doing that great financially, but this place has lower prices and not a great alternative to Racoon Lodge, or even 3 square or Seasons and Regions.  I don't see this making it a year, which I am not at all happy about because we don't have enough dining options in this part of town to begin with."},{"name":"Casa Chapala","address":"3010 W Anderson Ln, Ste 100","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"The salsa is made fresh at your table - you get to specify mild or spicy - and is served with hot fresh chips.\\n\\nCasa Chapala is one of our family's favorites.

We sat at the bar and the wine expert was very engaging and had many suggestions.  He checked back with us to see if we liked our choice.  The cheese person was not as friendly and did not follow up with us on the cheese and meat platter we asked her to make after we chose our wines.  They have a very good chardonnay from Calif  that is worth a trip to try.

It starts at 7:30, not 8 like we were told so we were glad we arrived early. We had to wait about 15-20 minutes for a table and then we were seated outside on the patio. Lovely space and perfect for a summer night, however, the speakers weren't working so we had to go inside to hear the trivia questions. The server we had was great but the food took forever to come out. It was kind of okay though since we were there for trivia anyway. At one point our server came over to our table and apologized and said the food would be out in just one minute, and right behind him was someone with plates of food for our table. A friend had ordered an appetizer that never arrived so she asked about it and the server brought it out promptly and complimentary. Great customer service.\\n\\nI ordered the BBQ Chicken sandwich with the seasoned waffle fries. It was very delicious. Although the menu said it had avocado on it, I didn't see any on my sandwich. Next time we go back I'd like to try the Pressed Bahn Mi.\\n\\nAt the bottom of our receipts it mentioned a secret bar and we think we spotted the door to it on our way out of the restaurant."},{"name":"Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue - Temporarily Unavailable","address":"4510 N Fort Wilderness Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Fun for the whole family!

Their drinks list is extensive and has a lot of different types of wine too. \\n\\nWe started with the charcuterie board and had the risotto and the white pizza for our entrees. My fav was the charcuterie board ($18). The board includes 2 different types of meat, 2 generous slice of different types of cheese, deviled eggs and cute little veges. Honestly, I was mid-way full after the board! \\n\\nThe risotto was cooked perfectly to al dente and the pizza was good, but nothing too special. The crust was nice and thin but the flavor seemed average. \\nI recommend getting some apps too if the party is bigger than 2!"},{"name":"Peaceful Restaurant","address":"110-532 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"My wife always raves about this place and we finally had the chance to go together one Friday afternoon. The young lady and guy out front provided pretty good customer service and made sure we always had some tea and water. We ordered some dan dan noodles and green beans with wild rice. The dan dan noodles were drenched in oil and tasted like Kraft peanut butter. However, my wife says no so what do I know. The green beans were actually very good. Paired with their wild rice, it helped cut down the grease on the beans and added a nutty texture. I thought I didn't like wild rice so either they have good wild rice or I'm getting old. What surprises me most is that there isn't more talk about how gross and dirty this place is. They've been shut down numerous times by the Health Authority and the floors have never in a single day been cleaned. I walked to the back to use the washroom and it was literally like I was on an ice rink due to all the built up grease on the floors. Extremely nasty. If the floors are like that, makes me shudder to think what rodents and critters are in the kitchen, or what their foodsafe practices are like (or lack thereof)."},{"name":"Bagel World III Bakery & Deli","address":"323 Main St","city":"Reading","stars":"3.5","text":"I stood in a stationary line of about 25 people this morning watching a few workers slooowly assemble orders.

The meal was brought out by who I can only assume was the manager, as our waitress roamed the restaurant aimlessly and seemed to be working inside some sort of exposed brewery in the front of the store.  When we received the nachos I can only describe the chips as inedible, not only were they not fresh they were so disgusting and fragile that I ate about ten nachos from my $12 plate of nachos and then stopped...that bad...\\nWhen we tried to order desert to follow our main meal we were told by our waitress \\"okay, but I'm not going to write that down so just remind me\\"  Really?

I went with a large group of friends this weekend for my best friend's birthday and we all ordered something different. My observant eye noticed that even though the presentation was great for every dish (which included a small Hibiscus flower on top of every plate) there was a lack of meat when it came to the steaks.  Although, that is just modern restaurants everywhere.  I must say my food was delicious. I ordered the Lobster Ravioli and it wasn't disappointing!\\n\\nMost of my friends ordered some type of pasta, which I believe is a safe bet when you are eating someplace new, because it's difficult to mess up. After your soup or salads, you are presented with a tiny tilted cup filled with sorbet  to cleanse the pallet before your main dish.
