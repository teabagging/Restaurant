The noodles were curly and had a dense bite to it, not soggy or soft at all. It was certainly al dente, if that applies to ramen! The soft boiled egg was beautifully creamy. It was definitely cooked but far from being overcooked. The chashu was flaky and fatty as well. Finally, I have to applaud their ground pork. I know, how much can you do with ground pork? Well, it actually had a ton of flavor that really complimented the noodles and the broth. I was so surprised by it! My boyfriend got the tan tan noodle and I loved his broth as well (he didn't let me try anymore than that!).

Settled in a dirt covered parking lot and operating out of a trailer, we knew this was the real deal. Amongst the three of us we got plenty of meat - all for $30 not to mention this spot is BYOB:\\n\\n-Brisket - This is what you're there for right? It was epic. Just so tender, pulled apart like string cheese. Like most of the other meats, the brisket was covered in a gorgeous cracked pepper skin that gave even more smokiness to the taste. My favorite were the thicker tips that were thrown in there as well. If you fed me those and bbq sauce for every remaining meal of my life I'd be far less concerned about having the same meal for the rest of my life - e.g. it rocked.\\n\\n-Pork shoulder - none of us were too excited about this when it hit our lips. It was fine, well cooked, seasoned nicely but it just didn't have the panache of the brisket or the other meats we had. If this was pork belly we might have sang a different tune or if it were the \\n\\n-Pork Ribs - YUM - fell of the bone. HUGE, tender, deliciously marinated - they didn't even need sauce. These were b-o-m-b.\\n\\n-Sausage - we didn't really want to get any but they were so cheap ($3.25 a link!) and it was great. A little hot but very juicy. So good.\\n\\n-Turkey - we were told this was the hot item. It sold out after we ordered. I've never had turkey like this. Again, more of that delicious pepper corn crust that uplifted the already terrific turkey with more flavor. This is unlike any turkey you've probably ever experienced. Eat that, pilgrims.\\n\\n-Prime Rib - this was a special. Holy cow. Literally - the cow this came from must have been some deity because this meat was insane. I've never been too big of a prime rib fan but this was just so got-darn tender, and THAT CRUST! OH THAT CRUST! PRAISE YE PEPPERCORN, MASTER OF FLAVOR - RULER OF MY MOUTH. I usually need jus or horseradish to amp up my prime rib - not this time. Not like this...\\n\\n-For sides, we got chipotle slaw and beans - neither of which were that brilliant, though the former was surprisingly more out-of-the-box than expected. The BBQ sauce was a bit on the thinner side - not the most memorable sauce I've ever had but good enough.\\n\\nIronworks & Stubbs  pale in comparison, I have yet to try Franklin's and Salt Lick (at the airport) was a formidable competitor - but this is by far the best bbq I've ever had in Texas."},{"name":"Grindhouse Killer Burgers","address":"1842 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Ordered the gringo.

Sometimes you get places were there is waaaay to much dough.

Island Creek Oyster happened to be conveniently located near my workplace and since I didn't want to fight traffic sounded like a good place to go.  Located near the Burlington mall the restaurant has both indoor and patio seating.  The inside has a bright and clean look to it with everything being very bright and done in white, beige and a weathered wood look.  Since I was by myself, I decided to sit at the bar which was large and yet still dominated by the massive size of the dining room.\\n\\nFor dinner on this evening I decided to start out with the clam chowder and then debated between the fish sandwich or the lobster roll.  Ultimately it was the old bay fries that won me over to the fish sandwich and I ordered it.  My clam  chowder came out first and looked amazing.  It was covered in chives and with some croutons floating in it and piping hot.  Like hot enough that I blew on it a few times and it was still hot.  It wasn't a terribly thick soup but the flavor was buoyed by the addition of bacon to the broth which paired well with the creaminess.  There was an ample amount of clams in it but my favorite part was probably the croutons which were nicely crusted balls of bread (not mushy at all even after sitting in the soup) which reminded me of a salt stick.  After I had finished that my sandwich came out next.  While my fries looked great the fish sandwich looked small and reminded me of a filet o fish sandwich.  That may be my western PA roots talking though as the fish sandwiches there are always obscenely big.  Thankfully it all ended up tasting good and I really loved the tartar sauce which reminded me of a remoulade.  The fries were also really good as they came out piping hot with most of them being crispy and the perfect amount of old Bay on them.  It made them slightly spicy while still being nicely seasoned.\\n\\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  While I would certainly order the lobster roll the next time time I did still enjoy my meal here."},{"name":"NaraDeva Thai Restaurant","address":"4696 Millenia Plz Way","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Came here for a early dinner with my boyfriend.

We ate there for a late brunch on Saturday and had horrific customer service from the waitress and manager. I ordered the huevos rancheros and due to the egg shortage, I couldn't order egg whites. That was fine, so I instructed the waitress to please tell the chef to fry the egg hard, so I can cut out the yolk and eat the egg whites. She said she would tell the chef and it wouldn't be a problem. My husband ordered the muffaletta with a side cucumber and avocado salad. We also ordered some cocktails and benignets. We finished our benignets, but no one bussed our table to remove the dirty plates. That was the first of many issues. Our food arrives, and I cut open my egg to remove the yolk and low and behold, yolk is oozing out all over my huevos rancheros. I\\"m upset and bring to to the waitresses attention. She doesn't care and says \\"I told the chef,\\" and walks off. My husband offered me some of his food and I took a bite of the cucumber and avocado salad. I bit into inedible avocado pit and stems! So the chefs didn't bother to remove portions of the avocado that no human could possibly eat, and didn't cook my eggs to my dietary preferences. Again, we tell the waitress and show her the portions of inedible portions of avocado in the salad. She said \\"its just a stem,\\" and walks off. She comes back, puts the check on the table, mumbles something and walks off. We could not discern what she said, so look at the check. Apparently, she did us a favor and removed the charge of the eggs from my plate, a whopping $2.00! The check is still over $50. I asked to speak to the manager, and this is where is gets interesting. I explained to him all the issues regarding the service, food preferences, inedible portions, etc. He said to me \\"Ma'am, what do you want me to do about it? The chefs are tired and its just an avocado stem in the salad, and I took off your eggs from the bill.\\"  What do I want you to do about it? How about own up to your mess and have some accountability. How about an apology for the horrible service? That would be a great start! I told him this is the best answer you can give me? You're allowing egregious mistakes in the kitchen to happen, not speaking to your chefs and wait staff and your response is \\"The chefs are tired.\\" My in-laws are restauranteurs/chefs and own Mexican restaurants in California. Never once have they had inedible avocado pieces served in their food! When issues arrive and customers aren't happy, they make no excuses and especially don't tell customers \\"What do you want me to do about, the chefs are tired.\\" This is a poor excuse, and I expected more from this establishment.

You can see it being roasted in their giant fireplace behind the counter! I recommend getting the rice and beans as your sides and eating it with the chicken! Mix the white cream sauce and the salsa and pour it over your chicken and rice for a chipotle burrito bowl style meal! \\n\\nIf you check in here you also get a free ice cream cone which I think is Blue Bells! :)"},{"name":"Bar 145","address":"955 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"The only thing worse than the burgers at this joint is the service. In my one and only visit to this restaurant, I was served with a burger that had no sauce whatsoever, and the patty was not cooked medium like I had asked. I took one bite, and asked the waitress to take the burger back given that it was barely edible, and especially not for the $9 they were charging me. At this time, I was already half full from the appetizer and beer, and told her I did not want her to bring me another burger. Most restaurants that I've been to would typically NOT charge for poorly cooked meals OR they would leave you with the food. Bar 145 not only charged me full price for the burger, but they took it away. If you're going to take away the food, then don't charge me - regardless of whether or not I actually like the food. I paid for it. If you're going to charge me, then leave me the food since I paid for it, and it's mine to do as I wish.

I didn't see sizes on the menu (cup vs bowl), and our waiter didn't mention any either, so when we received our soup, I was surprised by how large the portion was. There was so much soup that I was almost full by the end. It seems strange to complain about, and certainly I could have eaten less, but I've always been told to clean my plate. Anyway, I think I would have been happier with cup or something. My friend ordered a gumbo and I ordered a chowder.

I think these were the highlight of the evening. Great, obviously fresh, perfect seafood.\\n\\nThe halibut was...not what I expected. It was a whole fish - head and all - and it was fried. I asked the server to fillet it for me, as I didn't know where to start. It came with a tangy bell pepper side/sauce. Because it's a whole fish, there were obviously plenty of bones to be had. I wish I'd known, as I probably would have ordered something else.\\n\\nI felt like our experience was pretty mediocre. Nothing stand out, but nothing offensive - which to me, after hearing so many wonderful things about this place, made it a let down.\\n\\nSo, not a great experience for us, but I hope to try again someday.

The service, atmosphere and food are each worthy of 5 stars.\\n\\nI loved the space from the moment we walked in.  The building, which used to house Nava, was once dated, cheesy and commercial.  The people of King + Duke have transformed the space into a refined, uber hip, inviting and modern restaurant. The dark open bar beside the open kitchen pairs perfectly with the comfortable chairs and dim lighting.  The outside bar and table area are also especially lovely. \\n\\nWe started our meal with a celebratory bottle of champagne provided by a friends kind husband. Their drink menu is quite unique. I had the Yearling which is bourbon, rhubarb tea, strawberry and lemon. At first, it seems like their drinks are on the smaller side, but it took me the whole meal to finish mine. Each drink is named after a famous book or a line from a famous book.  The names are clearly carefully selected to reflect the drink as well as the vibe of the restaurant. Even the \\"King + Duke\\" name is a nod to The Adventure of Huckleberry Finn.   \\n\\nThe best part of the whole meal was the bread and butter.  Our table of 9 had almost 4 full platters. The Yorkshire pudding style popovers come served on wooden boards with a boat of some of the best butter I've ever had. \\n\\nThe menu here is spot on for a contemporary \\"steak house\\".  I think of King + Duke's menu as more of a forest variety than traditional steak house as rabbit, fish, lamb and duck, are as present on the menu as steak itself. One friend ordered an appetizer of bone marrow for us to all try. While I found it tasty, I just feel a little weird about eating bone marrow straight out of the bone. I ended up ordering the bar steak which is basically a flank steak with fries.  I rarely eat red meat, but I knew I could not pass it up at King + Duke.  It makes me want a steak just thinking about it. \\n\\nOn my first trip to King + Duke, I was with a group of 9 girls during a bachelorette party weekend.

It isn't huge in size, but quality is better than some competing Indian buffets.  Others might look better, but they don't taste as good.\\n\\n      The buffet is 11:30-2:30p  TUES to SUN. Now WHO ELSE GIVES YOU A BUFFET BOTH SAT AND SUN??  Same price too! $9 and change..\\n\\n      Another feature I like here is the prepaid meal cards for lunch.  They sell them at the register.  The more you buy the cheaper they get  If you pay cash it is cheaper yet as they don't have to pay a credit card fee so they discount that to you!   They recycle these paper cards so some look a bit used, but they work fine!\\n\\n      Each card pays for the buffet, PLUS any drink they have,  PLUS TAX AND  TIP!!!\\nWOW!  So you don't have to fiddlephart around with cash or cards or decide who had what....just leave a  card on the table and go!!! One card per person.  I generally let them know its on the table when they take the drink order so they don't have to bother with making a check up and figuring when to bring it.\\n\\n     The mango lassi is the best drink.  Alcohol is not served.\\n \\n      If it is your first time there and you think you might return, just mosey over to the register and look at the pricing on the prepaid cards.  They generally save you about 1/3.  Remember  when you add tax, tip and a drink your over $15  each so  compare that to the prepaid card price and you will see the value.\\n\\n       I only went once for dinner and it was about 15 years ago.

It's easy to grab a beer while you wait; and the wait time is usually less than what they quite you (bonus points for underselling and over-delivering). \\n\\nI've tried the tonkotsu black, premium whites and the cha cha cha. Favorite so far was the tonkotsu premium white. Definitely has more ratio of chicken broth than it's prefer, but it's very well balanced. I usually add a bit more tar√© to it. I ask them to cook the noodles a little bit more since that's how I like the thin white noodles that go so well with tonkotsu. The mayu black garlic oil for the tonkotsu black was not burnt enough- it should be inn black so it goes well with that rich tonkotsu broth, but it wasn't bad by any means. \\n\\nThis place is equidistant to Hajime for me, so I'll probably be alternating both for a weekly ramen fix, but I think I prefer Jinya just a tad bit more (service is way better and they have a liquor license)."},{"name":"Launderette","address":"2115 Holly St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Our favorite restaurant.

They're all exceptional, though the one downside is that there are not enough vegetables in their dishes compared to other Thai restaurants. Most of their dishes are more curry-centered rather than an even blend between ingredients (meat, vegetables, and curry paste).\\n\\nNow let me describe to you why this place deserves a blazing four star rating. I ordered Thai Hot for my Panang today and seeing how Thai Hot at most restaurants in the area means little to me in terms of spice, I was not alarmed when the kind waiter told us that, \\"We serve it spicy here.\\" The instantaneous response that I thankfully did not say aloud was, \\"Sure you do.\\"\\n\\nIn a few moments, I was feeling a kind of spice ecstasy.

I loved seeing this place open up in my neighborhood, and it's become popular very quickly.  Our first time there, we hadn't made a reservation, and there was only room at the bar.  The atmosphere of the small lower floor dining room is intimate and romantic.  The staff is friendly and happy to tell you about the dishes and make recommendations.\\n\\nDuring our first visit, we got the scallops (I thought the orange was an odd pairing), roast chicken with root vegetables (which was great) and the spreads quartet (which we loved!).  I can't remember what we got the second time, but I was on the Whole30 cleanse/diet at the time, and the waiter helped me out a good deal with finding something I could eat.  A funny thing, though, when my dish came to the table, it had an unexpected side to go with the main food.  The waiter explained, \\"I wasn't sure if the original side had butter in it, so I had the chef prepare something different for you so you could enjoy it while still being Whole30.\\"  I appreciated him looking out for me, and it was a little weird that he didn't let me know beforehand, but I tend to roll with things like this, so I wasn't upset.\\n\\nMy third visit was a quick breakfast with a friend.  I got a blood orange soda (in a can) and a muffin, and I loved both.  I keep seeing lovely pictures of their breakfast and brunch options, and I really want to return to indulge myself with those foods.  My first time trying to go there for brunch, though, I discovered the restaurant doesn't open till 10:30 on the weekends.  We were really hungry, so we started a small family tradition of going to Dakota Blue for brunch instead (about a mile away).  I'm sure I can convince my husband to try again with me, though, maybe during the week when they open much earlier.\\n\\nMy husband has a larger appetite than I do, and both times he had dinner with me here, he didn't leave feeling full after his entree.  I've always been happy with my portions, though, but take this into consideration.  The food here is very, very clean, and won't have much carb foods, which means your body won't feel full as quickly as it would if you were having a burger or pasta.\\n\\nThere's free street parking around the restaurant.  I haven't visited the rooftop patio yet, but it's on my list.  The entire place is very cool and yet down to earth thanks to the care and attention they spend on their ingredients and menu.  The entire menu is Paleo and changes with the seasons to make sure you're getting the freshest and most delicious meals possible.

At work, we received menu's from their staff and decided to try them out. I placed my order over the phone, went in and picked it up. I was foolish enough to leave the establishment without checking my order and when arriving back, realized two of our Sandwiches were the wrong item. I called and informed them of the error, they asked if I could come back and I said yes, I will be there in about 15 minutes. I know mistakes happen, so I wasn't annoyed with this at all, but how I was treated after arriving back, was completely unacceptable. \\n\\n         I arrived back, took a seat and was approached by a gentleman asking if I was the customer bringing back the 2 sandwiches. I said yes, gave him the product and then side swiped by his next comment \\"I heard the waitress on the phone, she repeated the order back to you so I am not sure where the miscommunication was, but I will have to charge you the $4 difference for each sandwich.\\" I agreed, and the waitress came out, stating the exact same thing. I generally avoid conflict, so I told them I would go back and get the money, the waitress then stated it was only $4 total. I told them I would be back. They said that's ok, we will make the sandwich this time, but I did repeat the order back to you.\\" This would have been a nice gesture if the finger pointing did not happen in the first place. I grew up in the customer service business and I am pretty sure the expression is not \\"Always blame the customer\\". I am not even blaming them, it very well could have been my fault, but I was not shoving that down their throats.

The sweet and sour chicken was just fried chicken with corn syrup (?) drizzled over the top.  It was not sour. At all. The \\"sweet n' sour\\" pork was exactly the same as the chicken.  Literally no detectable difference and served in the same revolting sauce.  The pork fried rice was a mound of white rice, stained with something brown containing exactly two pieces of dessicated pork.

That changed since the place has been bought (and re-bought?)...\\n\\nBoth of our meals were pretty good but really not the same taste and quality as in years past.  Wait staff was friendly, refilled our water glasses promptly, etc. HOWEVER, there was a incident representative of some of the recent complaints posted...\\n\\nA younger couple and us were the only patrons at the time.  They were sitting outside and got their food.  The guy came back in and politely asked if they could have another smaller bowl because his girlfriend wouldn't eat all of her soup so they wanted to share.  The waitress, albeit nicely, basically told them no, it wasn't their policy to give extra plates.  The guy did look dumbfounded (as we did) and he nicely tried again but the answer was still no.  He gave up and went to join his girlfriend/wife outside and was telling her the story by the looks of it.\\nSoon the waitress came out with more water/tea and again the conversation must have ensued but both the patrons never appeared to have raised their voices, it looked like an extremely civil dialogue.  By then the owner (lady in her 60's?) was closely watching and went outside on her own and, while I don't think she was rude (we couldn't hear), she obviously stood her ground and no extra plate was brought out.  After she left you could tell the couple were completely taken aback by this but I never saw them appear to be visibly rude, or making any wild gestures, etc. It did appear that both of them were trying to make their case to the owner by the length of time she was out there. It all seemed very civil.  They pretty much then asked for 'to go' boxes, boxed it all up, paid and left.\\n\\nWe were also astounded by this.  We couldn't think of any reason why a restaurant would not bring out an extra plate/bowl to two paying customers.\\n\\nOn that note alone we will likely never come back but we will continue to check yelp to read about more interesting stories of this interesting phenomenon!"},{"name":"Scales 925","address":"30 Ivan Allen Blvd, Ste 125","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"Ok so where do I start.

I also asked how the food was \\"plated\\" and his response was \\"It comes on a plate\\". I placed my order. When he walked by I asked him to confirm what I ordered,,,. Yep it was a totally different order.. lol.  Our bill came to $76. We gave him 2 credit cards and asked him to split it evenly between the two cards. He put $40 on one and $36 on the other and told us the math was easier to do it that way. (SMH) There were a handful of other incidents but even talking about him is making my head hurt so lets get to the rest of the review. By the way, he was very very nice and polite and professional.\\nThe food... Delicious. We started with the wings. They had just the right amount of crisp and sauce on them. Not to bland or not too spicy. I ordered the short rib with mac and cheese and collards. The rib was moist. It said it came with BBQ sauce, but it definitely wasn't BBQ but it was delicious. My friend had the spare ribs and said the sauce was waay too sweet. My mac and cheese tasted like someones auntie made it for Thanksgiving. It was the real deal. Baked mac and cheese made without the artificial cheese sauce. It was amazing. The poor greens.... not so much. I called them hypertension greens because they were so salty and I love salt but this saddened my palate.I substituted for the green beans which was smothered in garlic and red onions so heavily it made my eyes water. I just left them on the table and had to cover them up.   I wanted to try a dessert but no way was I going to pay $9 for a piece of red velvet cake. No ma'm. \\nOverall the food was great, the atmosphere was lovely, service was friendlly, but the food was quite overpriced but I do understand that the overhead is high.

We were asked to wait near the takeout counter and told that it would be a max of 20 mins. 40 mins later there were 3 other couples waiting with us and the hostess came out, asked a few of us to get up from the stools and table we were waiting at and sat a 4th couple (who had just walked in) where we had just been sitting. None of us were told that we could eat in the front, and after 40 mins to be kicked out of our stools so someone else could eat was ridiculous. We waited another 20 mins and finally gave up and went to our our good old standby, Alfresco. \\n\\nWe are both 5+ year veterans of the food service industry so it's not like we don't understand the hassles and complications that can arise. However, when you tell customers who have been waiting 30+ mins to get up so that you can seat someone who just walked in (and don't offer the same service to all patrons in the first place) something is seriously wrong with your priorities.

I understand that and some circumstances this could prevent people from holding tables however if there's a party of 10 and one person is missing ..carry on!

However, this wasn't their fault, as we didn't specify where we wanted to be seated when we reserved.  \\n\\nThe meal itself was very average.  The Bibb lettuce was good and the wines we ordered and rolls were good.  Our entrees (my girlfriend got the salmon and I got the pork) were average, but still edible.  Nothing special to be honest, but we took the Restaurant Week menu and felt that this was why the meal wasn't out of this world.  Then again, given the place, you can't be blamed if you get your hopes up a bit.\\n\\nThe killer was the dessert.  We both got the chocolate pound cake and were massively disappointed.  The cake was dry and tasted old.  You could get a better cake at Au Bon Pain and pay 20% of the price you'd pay for this dessert.  We both refused to eat it and the waiter and his \\"assistant\\" kept thinking we were still eating despite us putting the spoon in the \\"we're done\\" position, pushing our plates away and looking up to make eye contact.  The clincher was the fact that the waiter asked us if we wanted a box and my girlfriend said \\"definitely no\\".  Shouldn't this be a sign of \\"something's wrong\\"?  Nothing.  We just got the check.  We simply went down to Pinkberry and ate froyo for dessert.  Restaurant Week or not, this is unacceptable for a restaurant of this caliber.  You can definitely tell where they cut corners to meet the price of the menu.  Their attempt at making the cake tasty with a load of cream and a couple of strawberries massively fails.  \\n\\nDon't expect  the best meal ever at this place.  The high price is due to the allure of sitting on he 52nd floor for dinner and, if you're lucky,  a nice view.

My boyfriend and I brought visitors here from out of town for brunch as we were all starving and in the past we haven't had to wait long here to be seated. When we got there, we were 4th on the list and could see several tables soon to get up so we figured it wouldn't be long. We were wrong. Turns out they take reservations so we watched for almost an hour as parties arriving after us took several tables we were sure would be ours. I understand that this is how reservations work, but had we been quoted an hour wait time, we would have gone and got coffee and came back instead of standing awkwardly in their tiny entryway FOR AN HOUR. There was no communication from the staff with parties waiting to be seated. \\n\\nAfter finally being seated, we ordered drinks which were fine. The food however, is the reason for this review. Two of us ordered the salmon hash. The salmon was almost non existent and the pieces that were in there were cooked to a crisp. I'm talking black. There was also no spinach which the menu claimed was part of the dish. It was essentially a bowl of potatoes and eggs with a piece of blackened salmon here and there. I notified the server who let me know they would redo the dish. She comes back a few minutes later to inform us they're out of salmon so we had to order something else. She asked if she could get us drinks on the house for the inconvenience but we had already ordered a round and weren't really looking to have another. By the time our corrected dishes came, half our party had finished eating so I ate a few bites and took it to go. I was shocked to see we were still charged for all four meals.\\n\\nThis morning I decided to eat the leftovers from yesterday's breakfast and found a HUGE chunk of egg shells.

In other issues, chatty server. All I can say, is read your table, and err on the side of professional and friendly. A running commentary of little jokes is just annoying. Our table had difficulty selecting wine. Server should have helped us understand the wine menu rather than saying, \\"oh, that is available only by the bottle\\" and continuing to wait. Or, here's an idea: Make an appropriate suggestion. My cioppino was good, but I won't order again; too much work, but that's how cioppino is. Braised ribs delicious. Fish and chips, too much batter; not enough fish, all served on a too-small plate. Things got messy. Desserts--we tried them all--were ok, but nothing special and nothing was mentioned as a signature item -- although they should promote the cheesecake as made in-house. Coffee was served warm, not hot. Sent it back. In other issues, host wanted to seat us next to the noisy group in a room full of empty booths. We asked for a different table.

Emphasis on the 'bar' part.  And for a burger bar, Grass Fed gets it just about right.\\n\\nNow, to business: this really is a hell of a good hamburger.  I came in with not-so-high expectations because of some negative reviews I'd read, and I was totally floored by how good this burger is.  On my first trip here, my wife and I came on a Wednesday, which is their \\"burger and a beer for $10\\" special.  She got the special; I got the version with bacon and blue cheese.  They were both excellent, but after I had a bite of my wife's, I realized I had erred in ordering toppings that cover up just how tasty the burger itself is.  The fries are excellent, and seasoned just right.  The beer selection is impressive, and not horribly expensive.  Next time, I'll get a boozy milkshake--the ice cream they use is from Batch, and my love for Batch ice cream is not the sort of thing that can be expressed in words.\\n\\nOnly two things keep this from being a 5-star rating.  \\n\\nFirst, it's a tad pricey for what it is.  I'm sympathetic, because this is a genre of restaurant that's a little uncharted: it's not fast food, but it's also not a sitdown place, so I'd expect the prices to fall somewhere between, say, Five Guys and burger-in-a-restaurant.  Grass Fed is toward the upper end of that scale.  With toppings, you can be looking at a $14 burger, which puts this out of range for casual lunch.  \\n\\nSecond, the cooks are a little inconsistent.  On my second trip, I ordered a burger without specifying how I wanted it cooked, because on my first trip, they had told me that all their burgers come out medium to medium-well.  On this trip, though, mine came out rare-bordering-on-blue.  It was still delicious, and they grind all their hamburger on-site so I'm not worried about bacteria like I would be with supermarket hamburger, and I am a man who hates overcooked burgers more than just about anything, but this was a little much even for me."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"What can I possibly say that has not already been said?

I actually remember meetings my friends there and having done zero research about this place - from the outside it seemed like just another generic Irish-themed bar that would serve some Guinness and some mediocre bar food. I was completely wrong. \\n\\nActually Donohue's excels at a lot of things. It's spacious, there's a solid number of televisions and the place serves up some great food. I've had it all. Their burgers, their pastas, their sandwiches, you name it, I've had it. And so have my friends. We actually eat there when we go to trivia and a lot of us look forward to digging in. Not only that but their food is actually priced pretty fairly and comes quickly. Add to that a pretty decent beer selection (although they have no printed list which drives me nuts) and decent service and it's basically become one of my favorite spots in Watertown, if not my favorite. \\n\\nThey also have a pretty decently sized patio in the back where people can lounge out and relax while downing a couple of cold ones and there's also a ton of events taking place there on a near daily basis. While I have yet to attend any of those except for trivia, I'm definitely considering it in the near future. And as far as trivia goes, the host, Michael is outstanding and one of the many reasons we only go there now - Don't believe me? Check out his Yelp ratings over at http://www.yelp.com/biz/michael-o-neill-boston\\n\\nOverall the place is clean, stands apart from all of the generic pubs by providing a great experience both on the side of service and on the food and drinks and it's definitely a winner in my book. Like I said, my only complaint is that I have to ask our waitress to name their craft beers every week because it's not printed anywhere. Why not add a printed sheet with the menus? It would simplify everything. \\n\\nOh and did I mention that they have food specials for every day of the week including weekends? Prime rib dinner on Saturday and Sunday is only $13.95.

They were probably the most supportive managers I ever had working in a restaurant, as far as being present and participatory with the runnings of the restaurant from a server's standpoint- running food when needed, checking on tables for you, etc. \\n\\nSecond, Chef Q and staff are super. To work for and with, and for the food they put out.\\n\\nThird, the food. Coast has special nights- the very popular Wednesday $5 dozen oysters, half-price wine Tuesdays, etc- but every single night the kitchen puts out special dishes. Always a fish done in parchment with vegetables and oftentimes another chef's special, app and/or entree. Definitely try the specials if they sound tasty to you, as they will be!\\n\\nMy favorite dishes (this is one place I worked where I really didn't get tired of eating):\\n\\nTuna carpaccio, the yummy and lightly fried calamari, or the arugula salad to start.\\n\\nThe crab cake entree (two large ones with minimal filler, seared, and jumbo crabmeat) - I recommend grits as the side instead of the mashed, if you are inclined to enjoy yummy dinner grits. Beans come with also.\\n\\nThe lemon sole- note: it does have capers but they can be left off- with a buttery sauce. Delicious. \\n\\nThe pick-your-own fish that you can have cooked how you like (grilled, sauteed, blackened) - and the snapper is my pick. Get it pan-sauteed as it will be lightly crispy but not \\"fried.\\" Pick a side to go with- the spinach is great, the mac-n-cheese is rich but delicious, and the brussel sprouts are tasty if that's a veg you like.\\n\\nA few random notes: 1) Kids get a free mini-cupcake for dessert any time (anyone gets to pick a full-on dessert on their birthday) so ask your server! 2)Get a Friend of Tom's card and you get 10% off your meal at all H2S restaurants. 3) Vince is the valet and he truly is as awesome as everyone says-he owns the valet company and really takes pride in his work. 4) The side mac-n-cheese (especially if with the shrimp and bacon) is big enough for two to share, so be careful if you think you want the entree! 5) If you sit at the bar, Tara or Charlotte will take good care of you.\\n\\nThere's also a great private room downstairs if you have a larger party and this is a place that cottons to special occasion customers."},{"name":"Bollywood Bites","address":"13551 NW Cornell Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Nice little Indian restaurant; loved the kulchas and nan and all the curries we tried; okra masala, dal, paneer tikka masala.

It was very awkward. I asked to move to a smaller table, but was told they had nothing smaller unless we wanted to wait. I spotted a corner round table for 6 and we moved there, but the hostess was extremely curt and annoyed. Usually OpenTable VIP means great treatment, but not here, apparently. Very disappointing!\\n\\nThe craft cocktails are delicious with clever literary names. The pimento cheese fritters were fantastic.

It seemed stuck in an identity crisis for a while, but now they've found a formula that works: a classy, hip bistro/club fusion, a la Mantra or 33.  (Difference: this place actually *is* classy, definitely unlike Mantra and sort of unlike 33.)\\n\\nI was there this past Friday, and it was without a doubt one of the best times I've had out in a long time--both for dinner and the club.  Dinner was packed, and I think they had a wait.  Fortunately, my party (13!) had a reservation, so we were seated right away at an awesome table right by the bar.\\n\\nMy only complaint would be that they were a bit understaffed.  Perhaps they weren't expecting it to be this busy.  But if they keep up the good work, it will stay that busy--and more.  The sushi was delicious--maybe not up to the grade of Douzo or Oishii, but hey, you pay for the experience as well as the food, and the prices here are a lot better--and more importantly, the atmosphere beats the crap out of any other sushi/Asian place in the city.  Posh, cool colored lighting, good music (and volume), beautiful decorations.\\n\\nAt around 10:30 or so, the staff transitioned the room into a nightclub.  That's a daunting task, but they did it with almost no disruption to anyone else in the dining room--no small feat when they have to move all those tables.  The bar was absolutely *packed*, and the restaurant was, too.  I'd say about half the people there were people who wanted to get into the club early, and the other half were dinner lingerers.\\n\\nOur dinner was so good that we decided to stay for a bit in the club.  The music was terrific--somehow, they mix house and hip-hop stuff really well.  The crowd was great, too--not pretentious, everyone just there to dance and have a good time.  Pretty rare in the Boston club scene, no?\\n\\nWe eventually had to leave on account of preexisting plans, but I'm looking forward to going back.  They need to work on their staffing level during dinner, and a friend has told me that their cocktail waitresses aren't stellar.

This was the first lobster roll I've ever had, so I have nothing to compare it to.  What I do know was that it was incredibly satisfying and delicious!  They chop the lobsters into huge chunks (as opposed to tiny pieces) so you could really taste the lobster.  It's mixed with some mayo and celery and scooped into a soft baguette.  Some places use a heavy hand with mayo, but I didn't think it was the case here.

First of all, let me just say, it's unprofessional to accuse a customer of not paying their tab. If The Backspace didn't want to cause such chaos in their business then they should adopt professional business practices such as, oh, I don't know, splitting their checks to accommodate large parties. If checks were split, there would've been NO confusion. It's easily gathered that they don't like large parties. With that said, I don't understand how it's possible to stiff a waiter out of tip when everyone overpaid their totals, after tax, even though we didn't think the waiter deserved 18%.

Same variety in cheese's. That would also be, \\"Make Your Own\\", at a cost. The entire menu is ala carte'. Which we prefer, because we rarely want a beverage. They have many grilled cheese recipe suggestions to choose from at a better price. Just like any sandwich shop. A couple of different soups to choose from, with the option of smooth or chunky. We were very surprised to see that there is NO signature grilled cheese and tomato soup combo. Doesn't the name practically scream it? Now for our experience...\\nWhen you walk in, it's bright and colorful. Employees standing before a GIANT chalk menu, ready to take your order, I think. Guests are standing back, looking at menus that one of them comes out and hands you. \\"Do we seat ourselves?\\" Wherever you like sir. \\"Will someone come to take our order?\\" No sir, you have to come back up here to order. We sit, we browse, we get up to ask questions, we sit, we decide, I get up to order. We chose counter seating right in front of the kitchen station, to observe what we may order on our next visit. The drinks are all self serve Coke products. Not all were available. Seems like the perfect scene for one of those 1000 choice Coke machines. At the bread station, we watched a girl give 2 swipes of a buttered brush, and THROW it to the grill. The butter will not cover all of your sandwich, which is grilled bread(toast). Cheese choice goes on, cover to steam cheese. These are moved to the building station, where the accompaniments are added. A lot of hot open cheese bread sat there waiting it's turn to be dressed, getting cold. We did see a stack of crumbled bacon on some, while still on the grill. She cuts it, lays it in a basket, and pushes it down the counter. Someone then may put a cup, or bowl of soup with it. This will continue to sit under no heat source until the entire order is complete. Then it sits there, as someone says \\"Runner!\\" and no one comes. It appeared that runners only picked up when there were about 3 tickets, or 6 baskets. In a restaurant, there is a check back after the first bite to see if you need anything else for your meal. These people vanished behind the kitchen until sent out again. We observed others going up to the cashiers, or calling over the counter of the kitchen for assistance. We were served, and poof, she was gone. The soup of the day(Beer Cheese) was warm, not hot, and without any flavor. The side of Mac n Cheese is made to order in a skillet. It was hot and gooey, but without flavor. My wife's sandwich(Pep + Chez) had only 2 pieces of pepperoni on a side, with a drizzle of sauce. We had to do what others did, and flag the attention of the kitchen over the counter. The girl asked the bread girl to start another. They left the mistake in front of us, to continue to lift the bread, staring at the sandwich, next to the $20 receipt. We ate the soup, mac n cheese, and my sandwich. It claimed to have spicy mustard, but we both agreed it was better after I got up, walked to the drink station, and added a packet of Guldens spicy mustard. We associate sandwich in a basket with chips, a pickle, and a condiment packet. Not here. Now we are done eating, AND STILL NO RE-COOK. I ask for a manager(Ashlee), who we explain this visit to. She apologizes, and tells us that the item can not have much seasoning, so they will appeal to many. (The nursing home bland dietary crowd was more like it) During our entire 3-5min conversation, we say, \\"The sandwich has STILL not come out\\". She refunds our entire check, and invites us back again on her. \\"Is Sunday lunch a bad crew? Would we be better on a stronger staff day?\\" \\"Any day is a good day\\" she reassures us. That refund, and invite is another 3-5 minutes, and STILL no sandwich. We have mixed feelings about a return. Yes it's a free meal, but does it taste good if it's a hassle? I was at the VA clinic canteen on Monday where I had a better grilled cheese with tomato slice for $.99. Skipping all of my drama, you will get a sandwich for a price you may balk at.

I found it extremely difficult to find the restaurants number online. After 10minutes of searching, I finally located it and called. I was unable to get someone to pick up the phone. This was strange since Scales 925 website stated that anyone could make reservations, same day, before 6pm. Upon arrival, I was greeted by the hostess. She was pleasant but I ended up waiting over 45minutes on a Monday evening to be seated, with reservations. I requested a large booth for a party of 2 in the reservation. Finally after waiting 45 minutes, we were seated and our order was taken. I will say that the sever was pleasant but quality wise, it was awful. My friends order was wrong, twice. The food order, not to mention, the dressing was not even correct. So I had to wait to eat my food due to my friends food being returned, which made my food become cold by the time my friends order was finally correct. Additionally, was made this truly an awful experience was how SLOW the service was for a MONDAY evening. I could only imagine how slow and awful it would be on the weekends. Then to make it worse, the server offered a dish on the house and we proposed  peach cobbler. Even that, we were told would take 15min to bring out. This was at the end, 30min after we requested the cobbler. Now why wouldn't the server have had this in preparation already? No manager was ever sent out to speak with us. The owner, Tip Harris, was on site and came out. But he was to busy \\"hanging with his boys\\" instead of ensuring that the customers were being cared for.

It's Buckhead, so it could have been hit or miss, but luckily we wound up with an excellent server who was attentive and had a witty personality as well as a chef who served up a delicious special fish dish that night. I also liked that it wasn't too expensive; often location dictates a cost when quality isn't up to par, but Coast manages to be affordable and provide a good meal and service for the price.\\n\\nPerhaps my favorite part were the drinks. They're steep at $9 a piece, but they won't stiff you on the liquor. I'm almost positive I should have stopped after one drink, but I had to try a second.

While more traditional steakhouses may appeal to my parents' (or even grandparents') generation, this one is certainly the spot I am eyeing for celebrations, meetings, and all the nights when I just want to hang out and be a little fancy. \\n\\nThe cocktail menu is full of creative and inspiring combinations. Sure, you can get your martini or your cosmo - but you can also get a margarita made with ghost pepper or a cocktail spritzed with bourbon. Try something from the menu and you're guaranteed a drink experience like you've never had before. There is also a great selection of beer, wine and spirits including top-of-the line flavors from every profile.\\n\\nFor eats we tried the artichoke and calamari appetizer - though small, it was satisfying and expertly prepared. The char on the artichoke was perfect and the calamari was juicy and tender, not at all rubbery. The \\"house\\" salad (a mix of herbs and greens with a balsamic dressing) was filled with flavor - the variety of fresh ingredients packed a flavor punch and the greens were well-seasoned, allowing the salad to truly shine without fear of being over-dressed. We also tried the strip steak that had a 'southwestern' preparation. I could not imagine a more delicious and perfectly cooked piece of meat... the medium-rare was dead on, the steak was tender, juicy, and so incredibly delicious. Served with charred avocado, thinly sliced green onions and some marinade/dressing I can't put my finger on (but don't need to). I would not change or add a thing. The cheddar grits that came on the side were a great accompaniment as well. Though pricey, the dish was a nice portion - even though we split it (and the kitchen did the splitting for us) we couldn't finish it all. \\n\\nWe did make some room for dessert after hearing about the in-house pastry chef, and the seasonal sundae did not disappoint. Home-made brown butter ice cream (basically a delicious vanilla, and the canvas for the rest of the flavors) served with homemade butterscotch sauce and caramel popcorn. The textures and the flavors were perfect together, and as full as I was, I would have made room for three more sundaes if they had happened to appear in front of me...\\n\\nI also can't neglect to mention the free bread (yeast rolls sprinkled with sea salt and served in a hot iron skillet) that is in a class all its own.

You can basically see how everything is done right in front of you and the servers are very nice, patient, and helpful.  The waffle here is malted unlike any of the other Dwarf Houses.  I chose to get a burger with mac and cheese along with fried okra (based on recommendation from the server).  The sides were great, especially with the ranch dipping sauce for the okra.  The burger was a little left to be desired as it was a bit dry.  Drinks were refilled promptly and you get credit on your chick-fil-a app for eating on this side as well."},{"name":"Sidelines Sports Grill","address":"4060 13th St","city":"Saint Cloud","stars":"3.5","text":"Wings! for a great price with awesome sauces.  I have gotten the teriyaki with garlic twice now the same result YUMMY!!!!  Wing snob hubby, who is a traditionalist, had the buffalo hot sauce.  Now this is unusual because usually he goes for the xtra hot, but from previous experience he learned that the xtra hot is EXTRA hot leaving him with hiccups ;-) Love to see him whipped by a hot sauce :-).\\n\\nAlso GREAT for large groups and KIDS.  Always looking for a place that I can take the family and meet up with more of our friends that have kids too.  They have about five video games with the requisite Claw game.  We left with plenty of stuffed animals. They also have pool tables,... so many that I didn't even bother to count.  Cornhole anyone?? you can rent bean bags by the hour for a minimal sum.\\n\\nThis place turns into a nightclubish hangout after 9 or so.  It is soo large that it has a natural break in the place to have a section that is 18 and up after 9pm.  So you can still have family time in the other half until your hearts content.\\n\\nThis Sports bar has been in the area and operating for many years.  I have always had the feeling that it was kinda sketchy.  But my last two recent visits have really changed my mind.  \\n\\nThe BEST part is that we came out of there with bills that made us smile!  Compared to the other sports bar type restaurants you can easily bring kids to that are in the area,.... the quality of food,... variety of food, atmosphere, spaciousness that allow kids to have room to be kids and the perfect price point will make us regulars!!!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I probably should've listened to people on Portland's Yelp Talk when they said to avoid this place. Not that it was horrible to go to at all. But, in the end, Voodoo Doughnut is still just a doughnut shop. And, honestly, not even that great of one at that.\\n\\nI convinced Boyfriend that it was worth going to at least EXPERIENCE it -- after all, why go all the way to Portland to only then disappoint people when they ask if we had Voodoo? Luckily, we only waited about 20 minutes in line before we were walking up to the register (surprisingly, the line wasn't too long but it was probably because we went during a time most people are enjoying dinner). A good friend of mine had made a request that, if we went, to please please PLEASE bring her back some Voodoo, so we had a list ready to go to hand over to our cashier. Which he apparently really appreciated. He said it made his job easier!\\n\\nWe got a dozen doughnuts and the total ended up being $24 even (bless the lack of sales tax in Oregon). Still, that's a hefty price to pay for 12 doughnuts. We ordered a voodoo doll, a maple old fashioned, a Captain My Captain, a No Name, a Dirty Snowball, a Memphis Mafia (totally a fritter, not a doughnut and $5!!), a McMinnville, a Mango Tango, two bacon maple bars and two Mexican Hot Chocolate doughnuts.\\n\\nI personally ate the Captain My Captain, bacon maple and Mexican Hot Chocolate. Not a huge fan of the Captain My Captain -- it was a regular doughnut, liberally covered in icing and cereal. I ended up picking the cereal off to eat and dumping the doughnut. The bacon maple bar was really good though! Savory and sweet, but not overly so in either spectrum. And I should've passed totally on the Mexican Hot Chocolate. It tasted kind of gross to me.\\n\\nMy friend who had requested six of the doughnuts in that list was pretty juiced that we managed to get them to her through security, TSA and flying. Too bad the cabin pressure made them kind of implode on themselves since we individually bagged them into Ziplocs before flying :( But she said they were overall pretty good, but, again, nothing too special.\\n\\nIn the end, they're just doughnuts. I kind of wish I had either a) not gone at all and saved my money, or b) bought a smaller amount. Definitely worth the try, and now I can say I've had Voodoo in Portland, but I don't think I'll be going for return visits."},{"name":"Cadillac Cafe","address":"1801 NE Broadway St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This is a very good place to bring your parents or grandparents, or visiting suburban friends, or anyone who wants a big, Big traditional breakfast."},{"name":"Blitz Pearl","address":"110 NW 10th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Wife had egg veggie scramble.

It is in the same plaza as Kingstons (good Caribbean food) and the Flying Biscuit!! \\n\\nOkay now the restaurant: I walk in and asked to be seated at the bar. Looking around, the atmosphere was awesome! Very sleek and clean. I was a bit startled because they shout something a loud when someone walks through the door, kind of like when you go to Moes and they shout WELCOME TO MOES! I sit down and I was immediately greeted by my waitress which I don't always get. She was such a nice woman; I'm southern and know nothing about ramen noodles besides what they sell at Walmart lol so she explained the entire menu to me. \\n\\nMy waitress brought me a salad since id came with my food. I believe it's a ginger dressing that they put on it. Honestly it could have been the toe jam they scrapped off of a worker's toes as the salad dressing and I would've eaten it. It was so good! I could've ordered another one and have I'd be my meal. They have rice bowls and different kinds of noodle bowls including vegetarian options which is cool. I wanted to try both since I know I like rice bowls but wanted to try something new. She told me that I could do a combo, cool! The food is really tasty! I asked for chicken in both my rice bowl and noodle bowl and I don't know why lol but they were good. I ate the rice bowl right up. Please note that there is a spicy element to this food even if it's mild. Very important if you don't like spicy food. \\n\\nI was able to take my ramen noodles home with me; they took my bowl and expertly placed it in a container for me to take home.

I enjoyed saving the salsas to eat with the mains much better.\\n\\nWe started with the stuffed peppers and steak tartare. Both dishes was solid and made me excited for our main courses. The tapas was small, we got 2 small peppers stuffed with quinoa, cheese, and ham and the tartare portion was generous in my opinion.\\nI chose the pork loin stuffed with cheese and it was a hit. The pork wasn't the best part for me, it was a standard loin but all of the accompaniments really elevated the dish.

They even comp'ed us a free dessert because it was our wedding anniversary. I am definitely coming here again for a special occasion meal.

The unique decor makes you feel as if you are in a quaint, downtown Chicago restaurant, and the Jazz music is also a HUGE plus.\\n\\nMy issue with De Novo was the food and what they charge for it.  Although the food was pretty good, the price is pretty hard to swallow, pun intended, as it isn't 5 Star quality, which the prices on the menu lead you to believe.  I had the lobster mac and cheese which was around $23.  Granted, I understand there is lobster in this mac and cheese, but the pieces were so small you couldn't tell if it was lobster or a hunk of cheese you were about to eat.  My husband had the burger, I can't remember the exact name, and he said it was pretty salty.  There really wasn't anything all that special about it either, so the $12+ price tag was a little high, in my opinion. The couple we went with ordered a crab cake dinner, which had 5, fairly small crab cakes that didn't include a side dish for around $20, and Kobe beef sliders, which are one of their specialties.  Again, the dish just contained the 3, pretty small sliders and no side for $12+.\\n\\nTheir drinks are pretty pricy, too. Our guests had 5 drinks, 3 of which were ONLY beers, and that was easily $40 of our bill.  That is a LOT for 5 drinks if you ask me, that's around $8 a piece!\\n\\nOn a scale of 1 to 5 on just rating the taste of the food, I would give De Novo around a 4. However, when you factor in the cost of the food compared to what they actually give you on your plate, it quickly drops to a 3, hence my rating on here.\\n\\nThe jazz and atmosphere are very pleasing, though. If you're a jazz fan and want to enjoy an evening out listening to jazz, I'd say this is the place to go, just don't order more than 2 or 3 drinks and you'll be fine.  ;-)"},{"name":"Launderette","address":"2115 Holly St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Light and fun restaurant - perfect for brunch!\\n\\nWe shared the zucchini bread to start - sweet, tasty and topped with a generous amount of butter. \\n\\nI had the salmon gravlax - sunchoke cream cheese, capers, hard cooked egg, sprouts and rye toast.

The squid was overcooked and greasy, but the dipping mayo was tasty. the salmon in the don was ok, but the tuna tasted a bit fishy/not-so-fresh. after my second piece of tuna i was put off of the raw fish all together and ended up eating mostly just rice and squid. if the server noticed that more than half the fish from my don was still in the plate when she cleared it, she didn't acknowledge it. i was out the door at 2:56, so i can't complain about the speed of the little service i did receive."},{"name":"The Paramount","address":"44 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Why  are people giving this place 5 stars?

A few times orders have been \\"forgotten\\" and coffee/water is never refilled. I've also been for dinner, this is usually when I am most impressed, the worlds of food and service collide and seem to work in unison. Last weekend I went for lunch with my parents and while the food was good the service was just......odd. My moms order came out wrong and my dads side dish was late to the table even though the restaurant was literally empty. Our waitress seemed like she was rushed the whole time, like she needed to turn the table quickly, but again it wasn't busy so I was alarmed at how rushed she was. Due to the incorrect order, our appetizer was taken off the bill which is nice. My parents are utilizing the upstairs event space for a large retirement/birthday party in the Spring so we toured to space and talked to the event manager after lunch. I really need to point out that this restaurant desperately needs a major cleaning. Its a nice space, but a nice space that needs vacuumed loses major points with me, especially when we are paying a good sum of money and bringing in a very large group to enjoy an evening with them. We mentioned that we would like to see the space at least vacuumed prior to our event and got a lackluster response.

But that was entirely because their brunch menu looked amaaaazing. I'm uploading a photo of the menu that I took before we ordered because I was so impressed with it. Given the menu and the great decor and atmosphere inside, we were super excited to try everything. \\n\\nUnfortunately we were all really underwhelmed at what arrived. The menu was completely hit or miss. One thing would knock our socks off, just to find the next a total flop. There were really no menu items that were so-so: literally hit or miss. In general, I would suggest sticking to the entrees rather than choosing the sides-plate (\\"The Franktastic Four\\" - wa wa) that they offer. \\n\\nA run down:\\n\\nHIT: Bloody mary and fresh apple mimosa. The mimosa particularly was so delicious, refreshing, and a far cry from the usual OJ ho-hum.\\n\\nMISS: Buttermilk pancakes...excuse me, \\"flapjacks.\\" (Yes, the waiter was not amused when I dared call them pancakes. Come on.) I don't know how a place can manage to screw up pancakes but they did. My pancakes were so undercooked, I assumed they had sent them out in haste, so politely sent them back asking for them 'well-done' (har har) but got the same sad pale-as-batter pancakes in return. Another person at our table had better luck with some browned edges, but had similarly 'rare' interiors.\\n\\nHIT: On the other hand, the corn pudding was delicious -- it isn't your typical corn pudding and there is no custard-consistency here. It's more like a corn casserole, and it was really fantastic.\\n\\nHUGE MISS: Grits. Oh, how I love grits. Having grown up with quality southern grits just about every weekend, I know good grits when I taste them. And I wanted to introduce my grits-virgin friends to their glory. But these not only weren't good grits, they didn't even look like grits or taste like grits. Frank's grits tasted like dry dry corn meal, and they weren't served in a bowl -- that's how clumpy and dry they were. Truly awful and an embarrassment to grits lovers everywhere!\\n\\nHIT: Bacon waffles!! No need to explain this awesomeness, right? Chunks of bacon cooked right in. Yum!\\n\\nMISS: The fried chicken that comes with the bacon waffles. I actually really like chicken and waffles when done well (hello Roscoe's!). But this fried chicken was way too salty, and the skin lacked that crunch that makes good fried chicken so very good.\\n\\nHIT: Not surprisingly, all the meats were wonderful. Delicious, crisp bacon; tender, flavorful sausage. There's a reason it's called Frank and not Flapjack.\\n\\nSUPER MISS: Biscuits. I don't know how these pass as breakfast biscuits, but these little guys reminded me of a garlic-less and less appetizing version of those little cheddar biscuits they used to serve at Red Lobster. (Maybe they still do, I wouldn't know.) Regardless, these were not the large fluffy biscuits we had hoped for, and certainly weren't worth paying extra to have. (Btw, vegetarians beware: they will still charge you a full $5 for this little thing, even if you don't get the meat gravy. Real nice.)\\n \\nHIT: Hash brown casserole. Delicious delicious!\\n\\nAll in all, I would come back to Frank for the drinks and the bacon, corn pudding and hash browns, though more likely, it'd be to try the dinner menu, since that seems to be the real draw."},{"name":"Buona Vita!","address":"450 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"3.5","text":"my favorite :) \\n\\nthe first time i came here was actually with my father, and we've been back countless times since. the decor really isnt much, with vinyl table cloths, a mural on the wall, and a sprinkling of pictures, but who cares? the ambiance is still great, and youre just here to eat. its definitely small, and a little cramped, but not to the point where you feel like youre dining with the people sitting next to you. a really relaxed place with fantastic food. the dipping oil comes with olive tapenade, which is delicious. ive never had a bad meal here, but my favorite is the carbonara, and their meatballs are amazing. the one waitress who works there is the wife of the owner i believe, and extremely friendly and attentive. the only downside is that the wine list isnt great and is a little expensive for what it is, but the food will more than make up for that."},{"name":"Caf√© 47","address":"47 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Yum!

Two people, two appetizers (that were huge!), one small pizza and one bottle of wine: $25/person, including tip (and I was stuffed!)\\n\\nFood: delicious! Sweet potato fries are a must. We also got the spinach/artichoke dip (which was more cheesy than anything else) and a pepperoni pizza (which was good but I only had one slice of because I was stuffed from the two aforementioned apps/side dishes). \\n\\nAmbiance: nothing fancy. They have a small bar area. Tables are close together and might be hard to hear people if it's crowded (it was practically empty on a Tuesday night). Lots of people getting take out I think. \\n\\nService: overzealous waitress for the first 30 mins until she realized that we wanted to take it slow and hang out for a while. Had good recs on the apps though and gave us a complimentary wine upgrade since they were sold out of the lower-priced wine that we originally requested (gave us a nicer bottle for the same price).\\n\\nOverall: definitely coming back here - esp since it's around the corner from my apt. Reasonable prices, good food, decent atmosphere, would work for a group of 2-6 people.

At this point, we were taken aback but figured \\" hey the food looks great, can't wait!\\" \\nFinally our order was ready and we walk back to our hotel. Open up our food, order was messed up. They did 20 honey BBQ and 10 mild. Kinda annoying but once again no big deal. Initial reaction though once opened was that they forgot to put the wings in sauce. I literally had to put my finger on the wing to even see if it had flavor. That was the only way that we found out what the sauces were. \\nThe majority was fried chicken wings with very LITTLE sauce. Which is disappointing because the wings were fried just right! Not greasy or burnt. If they would've just had sufficient sauce it would've been fine but you can't tell the difference between the honey BBQ and the mild. \\nOverall, since we are from out of town we won't be back in our brief stay here in Orlando."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"First visit here, I rolled solo and was surprised by the valet on a Wednesday after work--but I guess.

I got the Guinness burger, a salted caramel \\"adult\\" shake, and shared the beet fries. The only thing I actually liked was the fries. The caramel shake was extremely salty - halfway through I was just getting sips that tasted like pure salt, even though I kept stirring to make sure everything was evenly distributed. I couldn't even finish the shake because of that. The Guinness burger (a burger with a Guinness marinated patty, bacon, cheese, and caramelized onions) had good flavor but the patty was overcooked and honestly tasted like a frozen beef patty from McDonald's. It wasn't just my burger, because my boyfriend mentioned after that his patty tasted the same.

It's not too dry nor too crispy, which I think is perfect. Another thing I really like about the menu is the sides - with each entree, you can have two sides. My plan of attack is have everyone in my party choose different sides. When the food arrives, the sides are shared family-style, passed around in a circle with everyone putting some on their plates. Everyone wins!\\n\\nFor sides, I enjoyed the cheese grits, collard greens with crackin' cornbread, okra/okra and tomatoes, fried green tomatoes, and sweet potato souffle.

The location has nothing to absorb noise so if all the tables are full (as it was when we went) the noise level is pretty intense. Granted, I don't like really loud places, so it may just be me.

Yet in Portland, one of the most popular breakfasts is at broder, a charming sliver of a restaurant dishing out surprisingly elegant Swedish food.\\n\\nThe low-key exterior blends with other shops on a quiet commercial block, with the word \\"cafe\\" lit in old-fashioned neon lights.  The street window is large and left open, with the bench outside frequently occupied by the folks waiting for a seat.  And those waits can be expected.  The restaurant is tiny, with 12 tables and some bar seats, a total seating capacity under 40.  So even on an early weekday morning, we put our names down to wait, which happily turned out to only be 15 minutes.\\n\\nSeated by the sunny window, we perused the always available breakfast menu (with dinner hours probably being an easier way to enjoy it).  Chances are, Norwegian foods will be unfamiliar to most people, and can be hard to approach.  Breakfast/brunch is a great way to showcase a cuisine's flavors and ingredients on a familiar canvas of eggs, breads, and pancakes, and broder does it very well.\\n\\nThe concise menu leaves the decisions to savories (baked egg skillets, hashes, crepes), sweets (pancake, fritters, granola parfait), or one of two smorgasbords.  Those \\"pancakes\\" are Danish aebleskivers, fluffy spheres lightly browned, with an irresistibly subtle tart and sweet apple flavor, paired with two sauces of your choice.  The sauces are excellent too; both the fresh sour tang of lemon curd and the bright house-made applesauce.  The aebleskivers are easily a must-order and rightly shareable; get one for the table.\\n\\nA signature dish is the pytt i panna, a hash of smoked trout cooked with tender cubes of potato, peppers and onions in a shallow earthenware bowl, topped with eggs baked into a square shape and pickled beets.  It is a simple, satisfying dish, where the trout works quite well and the beets add a nice tang.  Just as good was the very savory forlorade agg, which translates as poached eggs, but at broder, these are sandwiched between ham and spinach and a crunchy parmesan-panko topping; the Swedish angle seems missing but its a delicious dish.\\n\\nThe Swedish Breakfast Bord is a lovely, balanced cutting board filled with goodies such as smoked trout, cured meats, chunks of cheese, fresh cut watermelon cubes and orange wedges, whole grain bread and rye crisps, a slice of cake, and a small cup of granola and yogurt parfait.  A very complete breakfast by itself, and just enough of each item to sample.\\n\\nDining at broder is a pleasant experience; despite the waiting crowds, there is an unhurried atmosphere inside, like that of an easygoing neighborhood cafe.  Their rendition of Swedish breakfast is instantly appealing and well-executed, and different enough from the usual American version to start a new craving.  Great breakfast."},{"name":"Bambudda","address":"99 Powell Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Loved this restaurant! \\nSuch interesting dishes, flavors I have never tasted before.

Tourist attraction alert. Voodoo has unique donuts which really portrays what Portland is all about. I usually get a dozen donuts where they pick. I have gotten good donut picks and sometimes all lower end kinds of donuts. The lines are long during peak times and weekends. I recommend going during off times during the weekdays and there will be no line at all. \\nThe price is definitely above average for a donut. They are unique and different for specialty donuts but still charge way too much in my opinion. For example one of the pricier donut is the cock n' balls which is about $5 for the one. It is a peculiar donut which is shaped as the name suggests. filled with cream, and when you take a bite it squirts out. A big fan favorites is the bacon maple bar, which is a strip of crispy bacon on top of a sweet maple donut bar. \\nWhen you get inside it is a relief you made it so far. They have cool decor and alot of voodoo type stuff. Definitely keeping Portland weird. There is an ATM inside just in case people didn't bring cash.

Voodoo Doughnut was one of the repeated suggestions from friends back home in San Francisco, so we had to try it out.  We drove up on Sunday night, around 11pm, hoping to get a crack at some of these so called delicious donuts.  This was a complete no go.   After finding a parking spot a block and a half away, we arrived to a lineup of ~50 or so people waiting for donuts, plus maybe another 10-15 vagrants who smelled really bad haggling folks for cash.  With no washroom, and no hope of getting out of there any time soon, we bailed and came back Monday evening.\\n\\nTurns out that Monday evenings have a much shorter lineup, but the 10-15 bums were still hanging around.   Parking was a lot easier, so at least two aspects got better overnight.  We got inside and I was a bit shocked to see that these donuts were mostly just regular donuts with cheap crap thrown on them.  Really?  Captain Crunch on a donut?  Fruit Loops?  Rice Crispies?  How old is the target audience for these donuts?\\n\\nI was happy to see that they had a bunch of vegan options, so I kindly asked for a dozen donuts, half regular, half vegan, letting them choose.  I was surprised to see their prices:  $7 for a dozen 'regular', $10.75 for a voodoo dozen (wtf does that mean?)  They also listed another *something* dozen, but that part of their menu was covered up by storage crap.\\n\\nThe guy at the counter, a douchebag hipster that looked like he *loved* his job, agreed and boxed us up the dozen.  \\"$15\\".   WTH?   I don't think I've ever paid this much for donuts.  Way to make me feel ripped off.\\n\\nFast forward to a couple hours later.  We're sitting in our hotel room with 10 donuts left, each with a single bite taken out of them.

Here are the details of my visit.\\n\\nWhen I first walked into the Rossi, I thought the atmosphere was lovely. The low lighting, murmured conversation, and clinking of glasses felt warm and comfortable. When we first sat down, we had a look at their cocktail list, and then had to request a wine list. That's fine I suppose. \\n\\nWe started off with the lamb lollipops. They set the nicely plated dish in between the two of us without giving us small plates to eat the lamb from. By the time we were able to flag down the inattentive waitress, get our plates and dig in, the lamb was cold. It was also very tough, and difficult to cut with a knife. Perhaps that was because they hadn't provided us with steak knives and we were trying to saw through with butter knives. Although there were three \\"lollipops\\" and two of us, there was no fighting over the last piece; it went untouched.\\n\\nFinally, our food came. I ordered the pesto chicken sandwich and she ordered the beet salad. My sandwich was fine; nothing to complain about, certainly, but nothing to rave about either. The fries, though they looked great, were quite a disappointment. They were soaked through with grease and limp. Not very appetizing. My friend was not impressed with her salad either. She said it felt haphazard and thrown together. \\n\\nShe decided to order another drink, and asked the waitress if this cocktail had a LOT of mint. (Unfortunately, I can't recall the name. It was the one that was similar to the whiskey  smash). The waitress assured her the drink had only a hint of mint. When the drink came, it was as if an entire mint plant had been floated in the whiskey. She kept sucking the plant up through the cocktail straw. The drink itself was good, she said, but she had already had her salad for the evening.\\n\\nI hope you got the feeling that the service was less than stellar. Truly, it was abominable. My friend asked for water several times before receiving it, and the waitress seemed more inconvenienced by our presence than anything else.

No tomato one time, no cheese or tomato another time, and no order at all the third time. Their solution? Take the bagel back and throw in a cold slice of tomato and/or gruyere. Cold! Completely ruins the experience and makes the $4+ I'm spending a total waste! I can't even finish the damn thing. Honestly, when the cheese ain't melted, the only solution is really to start over.

Well worth the flaws!\\n\\nWe were on our way to catch a theater performance, but we arrived with plenty of time (so I thought)-- about an hour and a half. I was interested in trying a lot of dishes, but didn't want to be bloaty, uncomfortably full, or poor. So, the two of us decided to split 3 courses. It ended up being the perfect amount of food and the perfect variety of flavors.... once we finally were able to eat!\\n\\nThe wait time between ordering and getting our food (we ordered the pork belly app, grilled caesar, and lobster roll-- and I told the waitress I didn't care whether the salad or the app came out first) was INCREDIBLY LONG. Not only that, but I was looking for our waitress for quite a long time to inquire about the timing before she finally walked by again. She seemed aware of the delay when I brought it up, though. It would have been nice for her to check back earlier and let us know what was going on. At this point, we only had about a half hour to suck down our food before we had to start heading towards the theater. I told her we were on a timeline, and everything came out quickly after that.\\n\\nWe both ordered a glass of the \\"dry\\" riesling listed on the menu. I don't like sweet rieslings (which is more common here, it seems), so I was excited by the description. Whites are generally hit-or-miss for me anyway, but the drier whites are usually a safe bet. Well, it wasn't dry at all! I still drank it, of course, but not a fan.\\n\\nThe rest of the meal was fantastic, however. The pork belly dish was more creative than I was expecting, with a thick, square slab of belly in a perfect earthy sauce with mushrooms. The grilled caesar was life-changing. I've ordered and made grilled caesars before, but this one had the end of the romaine bundled in prosciutto. Genius! The lobster roll was pretty much perfect... buttery, crunchy-yet-soft roll, succulent lobster (no heavy mayo dressing here!), with a side of teensy tender potatoes and pesto, with asparagus spears. \\n\\nTo top it all off, the waitress perfectly split our caesar and lobster roll on two separate plates for each dish (we shared the pork belly from the same plate, which I preferred for that dish). I love it when restaurants take the time to do that-- it's a little thing that goes a long way for the dining experience. \\n\\nOh, and the waitresses were all wearing supercute outfits.

My GPS took me down an ally and told me I had arrived at my destination.  I was a little leery, but they did have a chalk board sign outside the door welcoming us in.  I guess this was the back door, but it was ok.  When we walked up the back steps, they welcomed us right in and sat us in the front room at a large comfy booth.  \\n\\nOur server was great!!  I can't remember what his name was, but he was very charming and seemed to know the menu relatively well, even though they had opened about a week before we had dined.  He did have to go and ask the chef how many scallops were on the scallop dish, but at least he took the time to ask.  When I showed my interest in the scallops, our server suggested if I was in the mood for seafood to go for the sea bass.  When he said that it was served with parsnip puree, I was a little skeptical because I have had some bad parsnips before, but I took his word for it.  My friend ordered the bistro portion of the butternut squash ravioli and a side of truffle pomme frites with triple smoked ketchup.  \\n\\nWhen our food arrived everything looked wonderful.  As I dug into the parsnip puree, I was pleasantly surprised.  They were for sure the star of the dish and I probably liked my plate when I was finished.  I tried my friends butternut squash ravioli and they were pretty good.  The bistro portion was plenty.  The fries were nice and crisp, but there wasn't really a truffle flavor.  The smoked ketchup was interesting.  I have never had smoked ketchup before and I am not sure if I really need to try it again.  I guess if you like a smokey flavor, then maybe you would rave about it, but I'm not really a smoke lover.  \\n\\nEven though we were pretty full, the desserts were very tempting.  We splurged and went for the homemade ice cream sampler.  We tried the spiced dark chocolate, roasted banana peanut butter, ricotta chocolate chip, and kaluha stout.  Each one was served in a homemade cone and presented on a cute wire rack.  It was a good thing that our app plates were still at our table, because this ice cream was a little bit of a mess.  The cones tasted good, but they weren't very stable, so when you tried to eat them, some of the time they broke in our hands.  I don't think I can pick my favorite flavor because they were all amazing.  After I tried one, I would say that was my favorite, but then when I tried the next, my favorite would change.  I would say that they rank up there with Jeni's.  This dessert is definitely one for sharing.\\n\\nOverall, our dining experience was very pleasant and we left very full with smiles on our faces.

We started with a simple, yet elegant spinach and grape tomato salad that was dressed with a light vinaigrette. For the second course, we ordered the Borsch and Mushroom Soup. It was the first time I had Borsch, so my basis for comparison is limited; however, the flavors blended nicely - honestly, I would just go in for a bowl of that (minus the sour cream). Going off of an old family recipe, I can tell you that the Mushroom Soup was both authentic and delicious. The barley, potato, mushroom, and carrots were cooked to perfection, the broth was savory, and both soups were a perfect portion (although we could've easily made a meal of the soups). For our main courses we ordered the Vegetarian Crepes and Chicken Stroganoff. The crepe was filled with more vegetables than I could possibly name - all cooked, but still al dente and perfectly diced. The crepe itself was light and let the veggies do the talking - each bite was fresh and imparted a new bold flavor. While we tend to stay away from cream sauces, the Stroganoff was fantastic. The mushroom and chicken were well cooked and the sauce itself was creamy, but not overly heavy or overseasoned. The mashed potatoes were tasty and complemented the Stroganoff and carrot/cabbage accoutrement well. For dessert we had the blintzes (not something we would typically order), which were tasty but nothing outstanding. \\n\\nThe price would probably preclude us from coming back, but the flavors were all there.

There are plenty in Atlanta with better food, prices and service.\\n\\nFirst, let's talk about the service. \\n\\nThe waitress who served us did not know the names of the rolls. When we asked which roll was which, she actually stood there and shrugged her shoulders like we were supposed to figure it out. \\n\\nOn top of that, she was literally two steps away from the sushi bar and the sushi chefs, so she could have at least turned around and asked them what was what. I don't know if she was new or something but it should come as a no brainer that a waitress is supposed to know the menu. \\n\\nShe also spilled my soy sauce all over the table while setting a dish down and did not comment, apologize or even attempt to clean it up. Poor service.\\n\\nSecond, the sushi was mediocre. \\n\\nIf you want to know a secret to good sushi, pay attention to the taste of the rice. Their rice was overcooked and did not have enough vinegar in it. For the price that you are paying (about $10-$18 a roll), you should be getting quality, excellently prepared sushi. I got mush that tasted almost okay.\\n\\nThird, and my biggest complaint. The food made me sick.\\n\\nI understand that eating any form of raw food is a risk but I have never gotten sick from eating from a sushi place until last night. Yeah, I've gotten indigestion from eating too much sushi in the past, GOOD sushi, mind you.

The \\"budget gourmand\\" in me feels like you couldn't do much better than Austin. Great Mexican food? Pick a street. Great BBQ - easy to find. But one area of great importance always comes up short  here - pizza. It's difficult to find good pizza in Austin. Most of what you find is so-called \\"New York style\\" pizza with flat, lifeless crust and greasy, not-so-fresh toppings.

The pepperoni just had that slight char on them - oooh! Delicious!!! And the most underrated element - the foundation - the crust. The crust is a focaccia style bread, thick but airy, and chewy.

The bread was really good and I was anticipating the food afterwards. I ordered Southern Staples such as chicken wings macaroni and cheese and collard greens. When the food arrived it was very strange that I had to drain my macaroni and cheese not of Grease but it was a strange watery substance inside of the bowl. Upon tasting the food it was evident that it was not going to be a great dining experience. The chicken was underseasoned to which I had to add salt, the macaroni and cheese was strange and Bland.

So..maybe take this review with a grain of salt. \\n\\nFirst, parking is a nightmare here - I did go on a Sunday - for lunch - which I'm guessing is the worst time to go. The parking lot was completely full - so full that they wouldn't even let anyone enter the lot to wait for a spot. I found street parking - but be careful. If you park in the wrong spot, they will ticket you! \\n\\nOnce we got in the restaurant, we did have to wait quite a while for a seat - probably 30 minutes or so - but that's pretty standard.\\n\\nThe service was pretty slow - but, again, it was very busy! \\n\\n\\nHere is what I ordered...Chicken and Dumplings with two sides: Fried Green Tomatoes and Mac n Cheese. The Chicken and Dumplings were fine - nothing out of this world. The Fried Green Tomatoes were good - but it was the first time I had tried them, so I also have nothing to compare them to. The Mac n Cheese was not good at all for me - it was very separated and oily. I like my Mac n Cheese to be creamier. For dessert I ordered the Peach Cobbler...this was not good at all.

Also, the place was very nice and clean, although their real estate is lacking for how busy they are. We did have a big party and it was a Friday night so we were fine with the wait until it kept getting pushed back 30 to 45 minutes - which happened about 3 times, at least other places give us a realistic time frame if it's going to be a long wait. We waited about an hour and 45 minutes total. The service started out very friendly, then took a nose dive about the second time they came out.\\n\\nWe asked if there was any update on the wait time when a waitress brought out some drinks, about an hour later, and she said she wasn't the hostess and walked off.\\n\\nOne waitress came out and said we could take two tables if we wanted outside. So we did. Then our hostess who served us before came out and tried to kick us out of the tables until I explained that the other had said we could take both because of our party size. She then explained it's only for people who are eating outside, which we did plan on ordering food. \\n\\nAt this point we just paid our tab and went somewhere else. To be fair they seemed stressed and it was probably miscommunication but they might want to further train their staff on how to handle stressful situations like a busy Friday night, and ask them to provide a little friendlier customer service.\\n\\nAlso, they can't split checks or our hostess didn't know how. When I said I wanted to pay for my drink + another, she said I can't do it like that just tell me how much you want to pay.

The place has a nice ambiance with high ceilings and edgy asian decor. \\n\\nWe ordered a bottle of wine and as we scanned the menu, we were immediately impressed with the reasonable prices on the sushi. We decided to start with the tuna tartar, a personal favorite. There was a large amount of tuna, topped with black caviar. It was very fresh and tasty, the caviar added a nice texture to the dish.\\n\\nFor our dinner, we decided to go with the crazy maki, caterpillar roll, spicy tuna tempura, and alaskan roll. While all the rolls were great, the crazy maki was our favorite, and for only $6.25!!! My second favorite was the alaskan: fresh salmon, avocado, cucumber, and cream cheese. The caterpillar was nothing to write home about but still fresh and tasty. The spicy tuna tempura was fresh, flash-fried with a nice kick.

We came here around 11:30am on a Sunday and I was happy to see that, even though there were definitely people around, it wasn't packed at all. The line was short and moved quickly. It's attached to a gym so I can see how it could get real busy at certain times of day. Even though our food and juices were on the house, I have to say the prices are really fair. The 8 oz juices are only $5 (compared to other juice bars this seems to be a better deal!) and there are a LOT of options- I tried a basil, orange, grapefruit one that was really yummy as well as a watermelon, agave, strawberry one with chia seeds that was super tasty! Their bowls are around $8 and are a really generous portion of smoothie and toppings. We tried one of their most popular ones that had blueberry smoothie on the bottom and topped with granola, banana, coconut and goji berries- it was really cool and refreshing! I had one of their almond milk iced coffees, and their cold brew is really delicious (my friend got their macha green tea latte and really enjoyed it too). I ordered their bbq jackfruit sandwich (most of their sandwiches also seemed to be around $8) and, as a vegetarian, it's the closest I have come to a pulled pork sandwich in a really long time! The crunchy slaw on top really made it. And the little side salad their sandwiches come with has a really great dressing on it too FYI. The major star of the lunch, and the thing I would absolutely come back for if I lived in Columbus (and have since tried to copy at home) is their avocado pesto toast- it's so simple, just a piece of toast with avocado, house made pesto and hemp seeds, but it was AMAZING.

I made a reservation for outdoor seating, but having never been there, I didn't realize there wasn't great ambience facing Kneeland St. And it was breezy and chilly.  When we arrived we decided we'd rather sit inside. Despite the fact that the place was empty except for maybe 2 tables of people, the host told us they were completely booked and we would have to sit at the bar if we wanted to be inside.  Fine, except, for almost our entire meal, the place stayed very sparsely occupied. And by the time we'd lingered at the bar over almost 2 hours, there were still at least 7 empty tables.

See Treehouse, Botticelli's, Quattro Gatti, Backspace, and now Cherry St. Just down directly a few blocks south of the UT campus, you would assume it to be pretty low-key.\\n\\nIn fact, it is actually pretty well constructed as a restaurant entity. The menu is simple, but the goods are handcrafted. The decor is warm and inviting, yet humble as can be. Lastly, the service is good. All in all, Cherry Street knows how to deliver a medium-grade Italian experience. Italian-American, I will note.\\n\\nIt is not as high-end as expected, but this concept was a steal when it came to the pricing and quality comparison. A buddy and I split a meal, and the grub ended up being under $28--shared appetizer, pizza, and pasta. Pretty wild huh? Additionally, I think they do pasta and breads by hand. And handpulled mozzarella.\\n\\nFrom an outside looking in, I would say that they get some major points for cranking out goods by hand. But, the theme in terms of ingredients erred on too much in the realm of tomato. The fresh baked mozzarella was milky and light, but the tomato was far too overpowering. A few blotches of the fresh fermented dairy sat in a pool of watered down tomato sauce--I just desired more slow-cooked depth. This stuff was also done by hand; you can tell by the chunks of carrots. Ain't no bottled sauce gonna have this rabbit food.\\n\\nThe pizza dough was killer. The mozz, basil, tomato was spot on.\\n\\nThe putanesca pasta offered many an olive and caper, but the normally complex and spicy sauce fell flat. And the linguine was a smidgen overcooked. I prefer my handmade pasta fairly \\"to the tooth.\\"\\n\\nCherry Street has my vote, despite a few little cracks here and there.

Such was our experience last night at Two Urban Licks. \\n\\nLet me explain. My husband and I arrived fashionably early to better take advantage of the craft cocktails. This was a good idea. We fell in love with the Purple Rain...never had jalapeno syrup before but it makes a lovely, subtle, exciting edition to a cocktail....SO BLOODY GOOD! The strawberry bubbly fizz thing was also sublimely good. Later, my husband had a beer with watermelon notes that was, again, amazing. The bar here does seriously good work. \\n\\nThe bar was comfortable...cool, dark...comfortable, except for the oddly sized drum stools on which you are forced to sit. At one point the skylight of dining area next to the bar (the one with the wall of plants) dramatically opened...when I say the skylight opened I mean most of the roof disappeared. We are in high summer here in Atlanta with swampy humidity and 90+ temps, even in the evening. Slowly but surely comfort dissipated as the temperature rose. \\n\\nWe were part of a large birthday gathering and....lucky us...we were seated at long tables in the area with the missing roof. It was hot...even after sunset. We were not comfortable and a few turns of the head revealed that everyone was hot as evidenced by menus being used as fans. We sat. We sweated. We longed for our car air conditioners. Our servers sweated as well. We pitied them. For this privilege we paid fine dining prices and while the actual food was well worth it, the overall experience was so, so not. \\n\\nJust to state the obvious...this was not a situation like on a patio where you have a cross breeze. This was just broiling under the dying but still potent sun. Word to the management. We drank substantially less than we would have because the combination of alcohol and heat made everyone a bit queasy. We did not all order dessert. We, and people at other tables asked repeatedly for you to fix the climate situation and you did NOTHING!!!!!\\n\\nThe birthday boy's statement to his girlfriend who had planned the evening ran along the lines of \\"Honey, this is awesome and thank you for doing this but next time can I have air conditioning.\\" \\n\\nAs much as we would all like to be we are not in CA. It's miserable here in the summer and if you are going to put people in a sweat box you need to warn them first or create a crossbreeze with industrial grade fans. \\n\\nI do want to mention that my bronzed scallops were excellent and as far as appetizers the salmon chips were yummykins as was the empanada. This place should be a lively, energetic, dining experience with a top-notch bar and good food. Close the sunroof and show some respect to your patrons!\\n\\nPS- the stools at the table in the center of the sweat box are really uncomfortable.

Push past the latte addled, stroller guiding sophisticates  on the non-student end of Beacon Hill and you'll find this small neighborhood institution.\\n\\nThe thing that vexes everyone I've been to the Paramount with is the wait line and seating, even though the house rules are plainly written on the wall.  The deal is, no seat for you until you've got food in hand after waiting in a wicked pissah line.  The system seems to work 'cause I've never had to eat standing up.  \\n\\nWhile the masonic inner workings of Paramount's line system ultimately yields the promised table, the standing wait implies a quality of food promise that isn't quite as well met.  It's not bad certainly, and I'm usually pleased on the weekend with billowy pancakes, or whole grain French toast w/ fruit.

It's typically around $12 (they charge you extra for feta and onion) but I always felt that the salad was a decent size and it was always cooked to order and was always delicious. \\n\\nThis week, I convinced my boyfriend (who could care less for their food or their pricing) to get take-out from here because I was dying for the honey tip salad. We called and placed our order. The girls they have working at the front desk always answer the phone and greet customers with a less than thrilled attitude, but said our order would be ready in about 15 minutes. We arrive, and it cost us over $25 for a honey tip salad with feta and onion and a chicken finger dinner (ABSURD). I'm pretty sure my boyfriend used a different expletive at the front desk (with no response from the girl at the counter) but continued to pay for our food anyway prior to bee-lining it back to the car to complain about the prices of the less than quality food. \\n\\nWe drove all the way home, and I opened my salad and I was beyond irate. The salad is now half the size it used to be and it had no feta or onion on it. Honestly, it was a 1/2 cup of lettuce with 2 slices of tomato and 2 1/2 pieces of small steak tips (no feta or onion, which I asked for and paid extra for) no olives, no cucumber - nothing. I could have picked up a bag of salad at Stop & Shop for $2.50 and spent much less for this salad.\\n\\nI called them back to advise that they messed up my order and I was upset about the recent change in quantity of the food for the price we paid. I was given to 3 different young girls to complain to before one of them finally thought it was smart enough to give me to the manager. She was extremely dismissive and passive aggressive. Offered no apology and told me to come back for my $1 (for the feta and onion that was missing) or she could send a delivery driver to drop it off. I advised that I was more disappointed in the size of the salad for the price, and that I would probably finish my salad within a couple of minutes so sending a delivery driver to my house would be of no use and not fair to the driver as I would not have tipped him/her for a mistake made by one of her other incompetent employees. She gave the excuse that she gave me someone else's salad who wanted it plain. No offense, but I wouldn't be paying $12 for lettuce - just saying. I ended up hanging up on her. \\n\\nNeedless to say, we will never be returning to Anthony's again and will be telling our friends and family not to return here either due to the outrageous prices ($8.99 for a sub, really?) and because of the major lack of customer service that Anthony's provides. It's clear, based on all the other reviews here that they have major work to do. You may want to start with removing half your staff and hiring people who actually are competent and want to work.

We said yes... he apologized stating that he had his own tables but he told our supposed server that we were out there. He said he would have offered to help us himself if he did not have a huge table already because \\"it's more money for me, you know\\".

The view is breathtaking, the food is superb. However, they really need to work on their service and booking policy. I booked in advance and specifically asked for a window table and I was told that I got it, yet when We arrived we had to wait for 15 minutes, and we got seated at what can be considered the worst table in the place, way at the back and at the corner. Now i still got to see the view, but that's not what I signed up for, and when i asked for a different table I was told i had to inform the hostess and that the wait is at least 40 minutes. My other issue with this place was the service, our server would disappear and not even check if we needed anything, the food took ages to arrive although I have to say it is delicious and nicely presented. Finally, we were celebrating Mr. Right's birthday and I have asked for candles and a birthday wishes writing when we ordered dessert, you might have guessed that I didn't get that! And of course because our server was once again MIA we had to call the manager and explain what happened, another 10 minutes wait till we got it by that time the surprise was not only ruined it was just pointless.

Even though it is a french restaurant, it reminds me so much of being back in Ukraine, and that has my heart.\\n\\nNow I don't want to just speak of only the good from this experience, but I honestly have absolutely nothing bad to say about this place. It was such a beautiful evening. We sat on the patio outside and there were fans going to cool down the warm summer night. The waiter was extremely knowledgable about the wine menu. We trusted his recommendations and he offered something that we both loved from the Rhone rouge section (Janasse \\"Terre de Bussiere,\\" VdP, '10). He describes it as not as sweet as pinot noir, but very sunny. It indeed is sunshine in a bottle. \\n\\nWe skipped the appetizers, and went for entrees and dessert. I had the salmon (Saumon √† La Po√™le: pan-roasted salmon, Roquefort risotto, julienne endive, pear, saba vinegar). I have to say, this is THE best entree I have had in my LIFE. Too much credit? No. My boyfriend had a bite and we were left speechless (and hoping to recreate this at home since I'll be craving this haha). It's pan roasted atop a bed of creamy risotto. Simple yet comfort food at its finest! He had the duck (Confit de Canard: duck leg confit, petit sal√©, French lentil ragout) and it was good, but the salmon was the winner. For dessert we shared the creme br√ªl√©e. A perfect ending to a perfect meal. \\n\\nIf you're looking for a date night, this is a wonderful location.

We watched the two of them dip their fingers into the plate and taste the sauce (not the problem), and then the manager came over and said they served fresh lobster and that maybe I was unfamiliar with what that tasted like. I said I've had lobster before but not that tasted as awful as this was. She then said, \\"well, it's a vodka cream sauce,\\" maybe you are unfamiliar with that.  Again, not the problem, and that wouldn't have caused the extremely unpleasant fish taste. We had shared my husband's dish and were planning to order dessert, but after that exchange with the manager I was so offended we instead asked our server for the bill. \\n\\nAlthough our server did bring us some Limoncello and again apologized to us for the bad meal, the $20 lobster dish was still on the bill. I have no hard feelings against our waitress; she did the best she could for her customers, but I will NEVER eat at this place again. I recommend you find a different place if you want fresh fish and pasta."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I would recommend this restaurant for any who like to yell at their dinner guests the entire time. It is just way too loud for my taste and way too crowded.The servers literally have to raise menus as they guide you to your table, in case you get smothered by the thick fog of bodies. I have already visited during brunch hours (and had a less than mediocre experience then), but I still wanted to visit during dinner hours for some time.\\n\\nWhile the restaurant is beautiful, the service was inconsistent. There are plenty of servers about, but sometimes they leave a dirty plate on your table for over 15 minutes even after placing a new entree. I received a free birthday dessert, but my guest had to remind the server even though she called beforehand. We never received any utensils for our desserts (we ordered an extra one off the menu). I'd actually hold off on the free dessert; it wasn't worth it, and that's saying a lot. Did I mention it was free? Our server Jacqueline was thoughtful in other instances (she knew I did not drink alcohol and brought me and my guest champagne glasses for free with mine being filled with ginger ale). Overall, I don't blame her for our inconsistent service, because I can't imagine working in such a deafening and congested environment. \\n\\nTalking about the parking situation is necessary for new patrons. Are we going to a restaurant or an end-of-the-year sale? Because it looks like I arrived late. TWO Urban Licks shares their lot with Nexto. Once you figure out where valet is, you'll then enter the second phase of Atlanta traffic, where the dozen cars in front of you will make you wonder why you even considered coming out. I've come to this location three times (once for Nexto, which is overhyped, and twice for TUL). I don't know why I even bothered with valet. I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to just park in the lot, but I highly doubt that they could even regulate who is and isn't using the service."},{"name":"Hamilton's Kitchen","address":"300 E New England Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Every time we've visited for breakfast or brunch we've never been let down. Food is always delicious, as it was on 11/20 when we were there for dinner to celebrate my mom's birthday. The atmosphere, regardless of whether it's a BFF Brunch, romantic breakfast or dinner with mom, it's always great. And the hostesses and servers are always super nice and helpful too.\\n\\nI always enjoy returning to Hamilton's Kitchen and try to dine there when it is a special occasion or we have no reason at all but are in the area. After over a year of visits I have to admit this is the first time I was very annoyed with some of the experience I had. Perhaps it's because we normally have breakfast or brunch...but I just thought that dinner would be far more enjoyable of an experience. Food wise, it was FABULOUS. However, there were 2 specific perplexing incidents:\\n\\n1. Thank you card: I have never received  a thank you card from Hamilton's Kitchen nor any restaurant for that matter. So when my relative purchased a bottle of Moet for my mom, why would most of the card be written out expressing Hamilton's Kitchen thanks for spending the birthday there with only 1 line specific to my relative's purchase and best wishes? My relative is the one who requested the card... a bit tacky for such an upscale place.\\n\\n2. Sommelier: Was interesting to find there was one employed but honestly he was a bit pushy and quite honestly not catering to our specific desires, instead more focused on up selling. When 2 of us indicated we were likely to go with what's most familiar, he decided to ignore us and focus on the one person at our table who was willing to try. The other 2 never said they didn't care to taste test, just simply that they would likely go with what's famliar. The up sell to a $16 glass was not worth the money in our opinion.  [We're not sommelier's but we are avid wine drinkers and we know what we like.] The dessert \\"coquito\\" offered at the end was not only incredibly expensive ($15 for a glass??) but as a Puerto Rican who makes and drinks this annually, it was not worth the money. We drank it because we felt obligated to get money's worth. What I found to be most interesting is that as a \\"sommelier\\" he certainly spent a lot of time at our table, serving, taking orders, etc. He was a bit intrusive, it was after all, a private dinner...but it seemed as if he wanted to join us or maybe he was just selling..? Either way, not enjoyable.\\n\\nYou want to impress us? Send the manager out to ask me how things went. Allow taste tests without favoritism over who might pay the bill. And don't be so intrusive, birthday celebration or not, it was a private affair and our conversation was continually interrupted quite abruptly. Thankfully, we don't allow a single incident to chain our opinion overall. But I will  say that we will likely not attend dinner there again for a long time after this first experience. Breakfast and brunch are not quite as intrusive..."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow.

The hostess sat us 2 in the bar area and the server took a while to come ask what we wanted to order for drinks/apps.

Via 313 has all that crispy, deep dish, crispy caramelized cheese around the crust goodness, with none of the chain store boringness.\\n\\nI had a bite of the Cadillac and it was so good that I have never forgotten that bite.

When you walked into this place, you might have to wait a bit due to their popularity, so get your hands on the menu and take your time deciding. Apart from southern specials they also have burgers, fried steaks and other things, and their sides list is a couple dozen strong.\\n\\nIf you are a first time visitor, they will give you some potlikker to start - potlikker is the liquid and bits left from boiling collard greens, and it is a rich stock usually made with ham hocks and chicken. It is an intense and delicious broth, definitely worth a try. I decided to go for some fried chicken with collard greens and stewed okra. The collard greens - like the potlikker - was delicious. The okra and fried chicken were so-so, somehow not as mindblowing as I expected. I also got to try the cheesy grits, the fried green tomato, and sweet potatoes with marshmallow. They all tasted good, being comfort foods, and if I must choose, I think the grits are my favourite. \\n\\nThe portions are GIGANTIC, so be prepared (or take a to-go box). The one very big downside to this place is, they take forever to do anything. Take your order... bring you food... give you the check.

I know- who wants to wait a long time when they are hungry. But this also means it must be bomb right? My advice would be not to go when you are absolutely starving, since the chances of you having a long wait time is high. There are no reservations either but if you are a mile away from the restaurant you can then reserve your spot on yelp and it will tell you how many minutes until you are seated and how many parties are ahead of you.\\n\\nWhen you start getting close to your time to be seated the person at the front will ask what you want to order so that when you are seated, you will not have to wait for your food to come, instead it will be served to you quickly. I actually liked that they did this, it keeps everything moving faster.\\n\\nSince its a small spot, you will be very close to pretty much everyone around you, but everyone is constantly moving and out quick. \\n\\nWhat you must try: Gankara Miso (14$) and the Tan Tan ramen (13$). Both were soo good! Seriously the pictures don't even do it justice. If you love spicy, go with the Gankara Miso. Tan Tan is also a little spicy but not too bad.

Not only was this the most amazing tasting meal of my Portland restaurant experiences, the presentation was amazing--absolutely stunning food brought out perfectly presented, often times with the server stopping to again explain what it was.\\n\\nFor dessert we had the plato de crema quemada (creme brulee).  Again, the flavors (raspberry, verbena and vanilla) were amazing and beautifully displayed.  I also had coffee with dessert-- I loved that I got my own little pot to drink and the flavor and richness was wonderful.\\n\\nThere are many wonderful places to eat in this town, many of which I have gone back to.

We split the hushpuppies, salmon chips  and empandas among the 7 of us and I would recommend them all in that order.

The cheese was kinda velveeta-like, and the fries weren't really crispy, but at least it was edible. The swamp dog was AWFUL. Toppings were okay, but the sausage itself had this flavor (maybe fennel?) that overwhelmed everything else in the dish, stuck to the skin on my fingers so I was smelling it for hours, had the most vile aftertaste, and kept \\"returning\\" on me because it upset my stomach.

Here are a few standouts among the smaller plates: \\nBuckwheat pancakes covered with a sauce containing pan-fried snails, hen of the woods mushrooms, and maple -- rich beyond description, but so delicious and satisfying that you don't notice you've hardly any more room in your belly until you've finished. \\nChar belly with a mustard (?) sauce that was curry-like and on a bed of what appeared to be black chickpeas for a brittle texture to complement the soft belly. \\nSmoked swordfish with couscous and various citrus fruits -- perfect marriage of the sunshine of the citrus you didn't know you craved with the smoked winter fish more typical of the season -- like a bright blue day on the slopes! (The fried sardine had a similar marriage.)\\nAs for service, the team was universally friendly, perhaps more so than any restaurant in the city, yet not at all hovering or in your face.  They were understated in their enthusiasm for the food -- willing to suggest and describe, but not going to force everything on the menu on you.

We came for dinner and were seated by the window, as I requested when making a reservation, which was nice. Though the view is probably the best you'll get in the area, it's still a view of Boston which isn't really anything spectacular in my opinion. The ambiance is nice; dimly lit with a live Jazz band.\\n\\nUpon sitting at the table, my expectations for what matters most, the food, started to drop a bit. The silverware and plating looked like it had seen better days, and a few things were a little dirty. This is something that really bothers me. Our plates were taken away regardless, and replaced with those that our meals were served on, so I guess it wasn't a big deal. The service was pretty good, perhaps a tad on the colder side, but good nonetheless. It was later at night, so it's understandable.\\n\\nI decided to go with the 12oz center cut NY strip steak. It was cooked to perfection, medium rare, just as I ordered it. It was flavorful, but still needed to be topped with salt and pepper. I found myself sprinkling quite a bit of salt on it, but I do prefer my steak on the saltier side. The sides were asparagus and potatoes, both of which were good. I ordered their house wine (Cabernet Sauvignon, if I remember correctly) and it was surprisingly really good as well.\\n\\nOur initial plan was to visit the North End for dessert, as the person I was with had never been there, but the Jazz band kept our attention. We ended up sitting back down near the band, on the other side of the venue, and ordered some drinks. They have an extensive, and somewhat impressive, list of liquors including a $300 glass of Richard Hennessy. Needless to say, their mojitos are really good. I forget which one our waiter recommended, might have been mango, but its ingredients were fresh and delicious.\\n\\nI wasn't sure what to expect from Top of the Hub.

It has a very limited menu and a few affectations meant to make customers say \\"hey, here's a place with a personality.\\" I think that part smacks of artifice, but they do make a great burger. The employees are cool people, which goes a long way in my book.\\n\\nEach time I visited the restaurant was clean, and the that crisping smell of fries wafted from the open kitchen. More on the fries later. The key to enjoying this burger joint is to be clear about your expectations beforehand. All food is served as though it is to go, in a paper sack that quickly becomes translucent from grease -- at least, if you're ordering fries. If you crave a large menu, then save Five Guys for another time. They basically serve variations on three things: burgers, hot dogs and fries. And (just to throw a bit of style on the whole affair) they also serve complimentary peanuts. \\n\\nSo about the fries. As I'm sure other people have noticed, this place always pours an extra scoop of fries into their bags. While I like the idea of this, it's a pain to keep the food in the bag for very long, and I can't finish them all. \\n\\nVerdict: Despite several attempts to cultivate a 'feel' or personality, Five Guys is unremarkable.

They serve the best black bean- veggie burger in Boston. My husband loves the fresh homemade salsa and quamol√© with the burger. They serve fresh salads, vegetables and fresh fruit cups. They offer wonderful, healthy options. Dinner service comes with a complimentary humus dip- simple and delicious. My carnivore family members love the chops, steak and other items. The breakfast is over the top. You can smell the bacon walking in, huge pancakes and everything is served the exactly the way you wanted it.

On a mezzanine level with an open view of the Whole Foods store on one side, and a wall of windows overlooking Cambie on the other, with wood planked walls and a long central table, it's a light-infused and airy space.\\n-when I visited, the counter staff were friendly and helpful\\n-amazing display of pastries (mostly humongous muffins, in many different flavors, all selling for $3.99 each. Also croissants and cookies), and a smaller refrigerated case with wraps and sandwiches and yogurt parfaits and cold beverages.\\n-their menu shows that they also sell wine and beer. \\n-I had to park in their underground garage. $6 for 2 hours. I liked how this cafe will validate your parking in total if you spend $10+ here. \\n\\nNot so good:\\n-the seating situation here really bites. I visited mid-morning on a weekday and there were zero available seats. After waiting 10 minutes, a small table with two chairs opened up so I grabbed them. A few minutes later, a gentleman in a wheelchair came with a friend and they had to wait on the sidelines for an available spot for at least ten minutes, too, along with other people who came here for a relaxing break and cup of coffee. It was packed. Craziness.\\n-whereas the muffins were great, I wasn't a fan of the coffee. (I totally acknowledge that taste is subjective and other folks out there may love the coffee here.

The first part of the night, the bf and I were talking about how to make the place more warm and welcoming. But that doesn't mean it's a bad place. So I still had high hopes.\\n\\nFirst thing's first--the drink. I was trying to decide between two drinks. So when the server came up I asked if the conga tea was good. His response? \\"Yep.\\" Um...ok. I kind of wanted a little more than that since it's a cocktail I've never even heard of and it's infused with thyme. But that's ok. I ordered it. I wasn't a fan. It was weird tasting, which is fine, but I wish he would have told me so I could have chosen the other one I was debating on. It was probably one of the first cocktails I haven't finished. Oh well, it was still my choice.\\n\\nThe food. Server comes up and asks us what we'd like. I get the lamb harissa. It comes with a choice of rice or couscous. I wanted couscous but he immediately went into a conversation with my boyfriend and didn't ask me what I wanted for a side. I was really disappointed when it came out since I'm not a fan of rice and figured that since it was his job, he'd get my side dish order. Even more annoying was the conversation with my boyfriend. \\nBoyfriend: Which of these four sauces are the spiciest?\\nServer: None of them. I don't really find anything spicy.\\nBoyfriend: Ok, well could you tell me, like, the order of spiciness? Which one is mildest and which one is the most spicy, even if they aren't all that spicy to you?\\nServer: I couldn't tell you. None of them really are that spicy to me.\\n\\nOk, dude, I think you need to step back and realize what your job is. You are supposed to help us out with our food choice. This isn't mcdonald's and this isn't a competition with your buddy to see who has burned off the most taste buds!\\n\\nSo my bf picks a sauce for his kabobs and asks if he can have an extra cup of a different sauce just to try. Of course, the server forgets that and so we have to ask for it again. Did he put the sauce in a ramekin for pleasant display that even Applebee's will do? Nope. He took the squeeze bottle from the kitchen with masking tape that was labeled with marker, \\"extra spicy\\". \\nWe tasted both sauces. Yep, both extremely spicy. \\nWe love spicy food. We are the first to put hot sauce on our tacos and tapatio on our eggs and red peppers on our pizzas. We like spicy. So we were rudely awaken to find that not only is it spicy, but to not warn a customer and to actually say that none of them are spicy at all is absurd. If i had sensitivity to spicy foods I would have had a few words with the owner/manager. \\n\\nNot only all that, but when I tried to get his attention for a water refill he ignored me. How do I know it was deliberate? Well I am a server/bartender. I make sure I don't do rude things like wave and yell. I just simply make eye contact and nod. Sometimes I flit my finger to let them know I need them. I did  all these nice things and he looked me in the eye and avoided me. I was also considering trying a dessert but when he finally came over he just dropped off the check. So I took a cue and left.\\n\\nI will never go back because of the horrible service. I was extremely jealous that other tables got the server wearing a white shirt with a black tie while I got the guy wearing a worn out t-shirt with faded jeans. He could have been a construction worker.\\n\\nI'd like to reiterate that I am pretty freaking lenient on servers. I make excuses for them on why they suck. \\"Maybe they're back up in the kitchen.\\" \\"They probably had to make a dessert.\\" \\"Someone ordered a long, complicated drink.\\" But there was no excuse for anything he did.\\n\\nI gave two stars because I felt the food was good.

While I appreciate the wide variety of doggy styles, I myself am more than satisfied with a little Spike's own mustard and some saurkraut. The bread is a little overwhelming, as some reviewers have pointed out; my attack strategy is to rip off the excess bread to optimize the dog-to-bun ratio. Really really good hot dogs, even for someone who doesn't usually like them that much. Got a friend who won't budge? Not to worry! There are lots of non hot dog items, like chicken sandwiches, burgers, and even vegetarian options. \\n\\nThe fries, however, are undeserving of the descriptor \\"curly.\\" Much like my hair, there are a few notable ringlets and the rest is simply a dry wavy mess. I negotiate this tension by ordering my fries \\"junkyard\\" style, which means loaded with chili and cheese-- an effective \\"conditioner,\\" if you will. The chili is good, and Spike's uses real cheese, not cheese sauce, melted right on your wavy fries. Lesson?

But, save the best for last because I had to sample my buddies sandwich and let me tell you, coming from someone who adores (adored is more appropriate since I haven't had one in a few years) cheesesteaks, this vegetarian one was one of the best tasting ones EVER!! The sauce, the cheese, whatever it was I simply didn't believe how great it tasted.

True rating: 4.5 stars. \\n\\n***CEBICHE DE PESCADO \\"5 ELEMENTOS\\" - Our iconic preparation of fresh fish in leche de tigre 18.\\n\\nThis was one tasty ceviche, with fresh Ono fish, light, white, and absolutely odor free, intertwined with slivers of red onion, all marinated in a proper sauce--lime heavy, with a kick of habanero pepper, cilantro, and some other unidentifiable but delicious elements. Ceviche is difficult to get right, but this was a winner. An exciting start to the meal. \\n\\n***YUCA RELLENA - Yuca croquetas stuffed with mozzarella and cotija cheese, served over huanca√≠na sauce. \\n\\nI was a bit less enthusiastic about this small dish, which contained two fried sticks of yam. Judging from the fried crunchy exterior and the accompanying cheese whiz sauce, I would have guessed jalapeno poppers. Well, besides the mediocre yuca center, that's basically what it was--not exactly the best match for an upscale place like Andina. I mean, if it's good, it doesn't matter, but in this case it tasted like something made by Kid Cuisine. Save your $12.50 and get something else. \\n\\n***SECO A LA NORTE√ëA - An old family recipe--lamb shank slow-cooked in the Northern Peruvian style, in a rich cilantro-black beer sauce, served with a classic guiso de frijoles, garlic rice and salsa criolla 25.\\n\\nThis dish was the belle of the ball, one huge lamb shank, so soft that an infant could tear into its tender flesh. The sauce was mild in spice and flavor, but was everything it needed to be, and perfect with the fantastic oily garlic rice and delightfully tender black beans. It was seriously one majorly marble piece of lamb leg, the kind I dream of. The best part? Of course sucking the fatty chunks of marrow from the long leg-bones. Oh the memory makes me weep...\\n\\n***ENCANTO DE ICA - Traditional red wine-caramel flan, served with baked Zamorano cheese, paprika-dusted Brazil nuts, and cinnamon-grape sorbet. \\n\\nUp there with this flan I had one time in Mexico as pretty much the best you can find anywhere. Extremely creamy and perfectly thick, with the red wine-caramel sauce offering a beautiful contrast. However, it was really its pairing with the tantalizingly light cinnamon-grape sorbet that took everything to the next level, and the crunch of those little Brazil nuts for the perfect blastoff. One of the best desserts I've ever consumed.  \\n\\n***EL CL√ÅSICO - A traditional colonial dessert; maiz morada pudding paired with delicate arroz con leche, coconut brittle and seasonal fruit.\\n\\nSlightly less mindblowing than the flan, we found the arroz con leche a bit dry, and no flavor in particular stood out. I guess the maize morada pudding was integrated therein, for I remember a kernel here or there, but I would have much preferred a creamy pudding on the side. Coconut brittle was nice was unmemorable, seasonal fruit was kinda interesting but not super developed. I tasted some pineapple chunks in there I think. \\n\\nALL IN ALL:\\n\\nIn a week of culinary adventure in Portland, Andina was easily our most favorable experience.

I was recently in Atlanta for a conference and two friends and I tried this place one night for dinner and I'm so glad that we did. At first when the gps was leading us back behind an old warehouse we were a bit skeptical. Then we saw a sign for valet parking and we were wondering if we were dressed nice enough. Once we actually got inside we were loving the cool vibe of this place. We were seated right away and after looking over the menu for a few minutes we all agreed that while a TON of the zeros and ones (appetizers and small plates) sounded amazing most of the twos (the entrees) didn't appeal to us as much. We all agreed that we would rather order a bunch of the zeros and ones to share and be able to try a good amount of different things than each get an entree we weren't sure we would love. We decided on the salmon chips (our awesome waiters recommendation), the pimento cheese hush puppies, the calamari, the butternut squash, and the brisket empanadas. Now while I struggle to pick a favorite because they were all truly amazing I have to say that this is the first time I have EVER in my life eaten salmon and actually liked it! After a bad salmon experience in France which I will not go into its been something I've only recently even been able to handle the sight and smell of but something I've always wished I liked because it's so good for you. Now I can say that I enjoyed this salmon dish! And it makes me excited to try another one sometime soon! So this dish is their smoked salmon with onions and capers on top of house made potato chips. I seriously can't recommend this enough! Next the calamari was the best I've ever eaten. I can usually eat a few rings when someone I'm with wants to order it but it's never been a favorite of mine either but this dish I had a hard time keeping myself from eating it all. Now I knew I was going to love the empanadas and I was right. The brisket was tender and spicy and the shell was tender and flaky. Yum! The squash salad was also great and I loved the big chunks of Gorgonzola cheese in it and the pimento cheese hush puppies were unexpectedly spicy which I liked a lot! After our appetizer extravaganza we also decided to split a dessert and we went with the sweet potato cheese cake because it was different than something we had seen any place else and because none of our husbands would have selected it to split with us had they been there.

My friend had been here several times but i had not. I read great reviews online and drive past the restaurant all the time. We got there around 9:30 and we're seated immediately. The service was good and quick. The ambiance of the restaurant was so adorable and quant. The menu was very broad and had a lot of options. I was debating between the heathy chicken and an egg white omelette. The waitress told me the chicken was good so I ordered that. The entree came with a chicken breast, egg whites, fruit, an english muffin and saut√©ed mushrooms and onions. The chicken was rather dry and the egg whites had no flavor. Granted egg whites are pretty bland to begin with, but I was at least expecting some sort of seasoning. The saut√©ed onions and mushrooms were delicious. I only had a bite of the english muffin but it was very tasty. I wish I had ordered the omelette but I will know next time. My friend had the salmon eggs Benedict and loved it (she gets it almost every time she dines here). There is complimentary valet parking in a side lot for Folk Art. The valet men just work off of tips. Overall I enjoyed my breakfast even though my entree wasn't too great. Next time I'll know to go with the omelette.

That is crazy and looks like I'm not the only one that really likes this place.  I didn't have reservations so I expected a wait.  Up front Dwight told me that for a table for two it's a two and a half hour wait.  He was able to get me and my guest at the chef's counter without waiting.  My boy Dwight hooked it up!  Okay there was seating available at the chef's counter but I'll pretend he hooked it up for me.\\n\\nAnnie was our server at the chef's counter.  After ordering a couple drinks, she brought out ciabatta with olive oil infused with chili oil.  I told her you didn't have to do all that for me, bread and butter would have worked but I appreciate the extra effort.  She said everyone gets it but I preferred to ignore that part and believed I was getting some special treatment tonight.  The drinks were decent.  I remember having some kind of bourbon julep and also remember that the love potion #2 was quite strong.  \\n\\nIt's more of a simple and limited menu to choose from.  Don't expect to flip through lots of pages as it's a one sheeter.  Despite being one sheet, there were a lot of choices that sounded appealing to me but I decided to go with the bistro steak and my guest went with the brisket which she really liked.  The bistro steak was excellent and the yellow corn chimichurri that came with it was something I don't have often and was really good.  I tried some of the brisket and it was it pretty good but not as good as the bistro steak.  Before finishing my meal I had a reaction which made me realize how much I enjoyed my entree.  One of the runners came up from behind me thinking I was done and tried taking my dish away.  Usually it's a good guess when they take it away as I would be pretty much done but in some cases I may say \\"Hang on, not done yet\\".  In this case, I was surprised as the words that came out of my mouth were \\"Oh Hell No!\\"  It kind of startled the guy backwards and I never talk like that so blame it on the food!   \\n\\nIt was a fun experience sitting at the chef's counter and watching the cooks do their thing.  If you manage to choose where you sit I would recommend not sitting in front of the POS station.  I kept trying to snap a picture of the open kitchen and each server would jump right in front of me on the POS station.  I couldn't get a break on that one.

The chicken breading was nice and crispy with an excellent crunch, but it needed a little more salt or seasoning. The gravy on top had a decent flavor, but I still found myself dumping pepper on it because it just wasn't doing it for me. The okra was fried well, but the breading was thin and fell off easily--it reminds me of the frozen breaded okra from the store that my mom used to fry. The broccoli souffle was also prepared well, but lacked flavor.\\n\\nAdd a little salt and pepper and it's pretty solid, but really not worth the wait and the portions, in my opinion, are average (or a little small) for the price.\\n\\nI forgot to mention the service.

I tend to rotate between the pork and the scallops, but I have been tempted to try food that others with me order and I really haven't had anything bad.

My favorite is the beet salad, thick slices of red and golden beets with a light ginger vinaigrette. Salads were pretty good sized would make a good lunch if paired with soup.\\n\\nGorgonzola Cheesecake - it was our favorite 2nd course for the table. It came with a slice of seasoned gorgonzola with a cornmeal(i think) crust. The cheese came with an entire bulb of umami packed roasted garlic and delicious balsamic glazed veggies.

But I also thought it was too far of a drive and never made it up there. So I was really excited for the Brookline location to open. However, after trying a bunch of dishes on the menu, I think it's only worth a 3-3.5 star rating. \\n\\nWu Er offers a variety of small dishes (tapas style) or you can order one of the large plates for 2-4 ppl to share. We decided to go with the tapas and ordered about 5-6 dishes and some skewers. My favorite was the cucumber salad (the seasoning tasted exactly like what I always had growing up in China!). I also really liked the ribs, which were perfectly tender on the inside and crunchy on the outside! However, I have to say that the skewers were a disappointment. They were way under-seasoned (seems that the only seasoning on them was cumin). The skewers were not nearly as good as those from its food truck in Chinatown. I was excited to see Zha Jian Mian (noodles with pork black bean sauce) on the menu, but the sauce was way to sweet and tasted nothing like the authentic one in China. Also note that I wanted to order Liang Pi (cold noodles), however they said that they were making new ones and that they wouldn't be ready until dinner time (bummer). \\n\\nI was able to find a groupon for $20 that is worth $40 in value, so the bill came out very reasonably.

The fajitas here were the biggest disappointment.. Elsi's might be good for some foods, but we were not happy. On the plus-side the service was great - waitress was friendly and helpful but unfortunately.\\n\\n(4/10) Fajita Dinner (Chicken)\\nWe like to order fajitas at Mexican restaurants because it is generally a good indicator about the quality of the restaurant's food (and because we love it!).  At Elsi's this is definitely the case.  The chicken is dry and bland, and the flour tortillas are extremely chewy. These are the worst fajitas we've ever had.\\n\\n(5/10) Salvadorian Empanadas\\nEmpanadas are Central American turn-overs filled with either beef, chicken, cheese, or spinach & mushroom.  Since this dish comes with 4 empanadas, we naturally ordered one of each!\\nCheese - This is plain and the cheese is very stringy.\\nChicken - Better than the cheese, but the chicken was bland.\\nBeef - A little more flavorful and moist, better than the previous two.\\nSpinach & Mushroom - This one was the best! Did not taste any mushrooms, as it was all spinach and cheese. Yummm!\\n\\n(6/10) Enchilada Trio\\nAs the name states, it comes with three enchiladas: chicken-verde, beef-roja, and cheese-chipotle. All three enchiladas had decent flavor and did not suffer from bland chicken, stringy cheese, or chewy tortillas.\\n\\n(5/10) Chicken Quesadillas\\nWe hate to sound like a broken record, but the chicken was tasteless and needs lots of salsa to increase the edible factor of this dish.  Also the cheese was very stringy (we made one about 2 feet long).\\n\\nService (8/10)\\nIf the food was as good as the service, then Elsi's would be a winner. Our waitress was friendly and voluntarily offered her suggestions on what to order from the menu since she could tell we were Salvadorian food newbies.

Southwest Atlanta officially now has a hip and trendy coffee shop.  Its right off Sylvan road about a mile from my house.  I live in a neighborhood called Capitol View and we have patiently been waiting for these type of places to come to SW Atlanta and now one finally has.  Its a small little place and has a very modern industrial type look to it.  Exposed beams, cables, wires, walls made of tin...just a really cool look.  But what you really want to know about is the food right?  Well.....eh......its not bad or terrible.  The first day i went i had a chicken salad, a shrimp Po' boy sandwich and a side of cole slaw.  It was not that great.  I mean, how do you mess up a salad?  There really was not that much flavor to it and the chicken strips on top of the salad didnt have any spices or flavoring added to it.  The cole slaw was not of my liking at all.  You get a side of french fries with and sandwich you order and its a generous portion.  Its the large crinkle kind (my favorite) but once again.....no flavor.  No exotic spices sprinkled on them to make them pop or taste wonderful.  The Po' boy...blah.  I hate to be so negative for such a much needed restaurant in this part of town but i'm not gonna lie.  The Po' boy had no spice added on the shrimp.  Not much flavor again.  I was determined to make myself like this place and went back the next day.  I got the turkey burger and fried green tomatoes.  The turkey burger was great.  About 2 inches thick, juicy and very tasty.  I would have that again.  The fries...same as the day before boring.  The fried green tomatoes, i've had better but they were not that bad.  Especially with the spicy dipping sauce they give you for them and its a generous portion to.  I got to go orders each time and it was quick and expedient.  Employees are nice but i did see that woman that other yelpers are talking about was rude.  I think she might be the owner.  Yeah, shes a little abrasive and could be a little more friendly.   So in summation would i go back again, maybe i dont know.  Should you go?  It depends where you live.

I dropped off my vespa to get an oil change in downtown Austin. I thought to myself \\"Since I'm stuck downtown, I'd love to grab some Starbucks and Franks.\\" Now a bit of information to understand why what happened did the way it did... I'm a regular at Starbucks, and ALWAYS save my cup, as gold members get free refills (plus I'm environmentally friendly!). I drink unsweetened iced green tea, no frills here. So after visiting Starbucks, I head over to Franks, am seated by the hostess with my tea in hand, and have an amazingly friendly male server offer me the lunch menu. He makes recommendations, which I ultimately took him up on, opened up my laptop and answered a phone call. Roughly 10 minutes into my visit to Franks, a woman came over and told me that I wasn't allowed to have my tea \\"because it was a health code violation and if I got sick, they could be liable.\\" Now, let's look at the makeup of unsweetened iced tea, shall we? One part ice (H2O) and one part water (again, H2O) that had tea leaves seeping in it at one point in time. Now, fortunately for me, I don't live in a third world country and dysentery has yet to be a problem for me. So getting sick wasn't a concern I had over drinking this antioxidant filled diuretic. However, I understood what she was saying, and allowed her to pour out my tea, but asked for the cup back. Again, I'll claim responsibility for possibly going against some cultural norm about bringing my own time-stamped drink into a restaurant, or completely missing any signs on the door (if they exist) that say no outside food or drink. Anyway, she acknowledged I wanted my cup back and went to the back to pour out my tea. Upon return, she told me she had to throw the EMPTY cup away \\"because it's also against the health code.\\" Listen, if I went shopping for housewares, would you force me to throw away my cups? No, of course not, that's irrational. They're EMPTY cups we're talking about. So, in all honestly, I responded in an extremely rude way because the situation was irrational, and I also happened to use an expletive. So, to the woman I said that to, I'm very sorry for that. It was impolite. HOWEVER, when I said that I would leave your restaurant and grab my things with a quick \\"holler\\", you proceeded to mock me with a \\"hollerrrrr\\" in the most annoying, belittling voice you could muster. Listen woman, and Franks, if you think it's okay to belittle your customers after they get angry, you're wrong. There is this really amazing thing called customer service, something that the greasy-haired attitude-laden beast working there apparently lacks. So, I'm going to give you one star for this incident. Again, I'm sorry for missing the signs on the door, for going against cultural norms, and I'm sorry for being moderately rude to your server. But if you think that your servers can act that way, you won't be in business long.\\n\\nP.S. - I really love your food and the male server that originally was serving me.

Fortunately, it's also one of the best.\\n\\nIf you just look at the surface, you might mistake Lenoir for any number of (also very good) recent additions to the restaurant scene. It's a small, local, chef-driven restaurant that focuses on locally-sourced ingredients and creative, casual upscale dishes. It is all of these things, but if you look a little closer, you'll see a very unusual restaurant.\\n\\nIf you remember the previous occupant of this space, Somnios, you're going to be surprised at just how different the interior looks. Lenoir has a vastly more professional look and feel. Unfortunately, there wasn't much that could be done to the size of the building Lenoir is tiny and the seating arrangements are dictated by the unusual dining room. There are a few small, raised tables, one long table that is shared by several parties, and a curved bar where four more couples can eat. There has been some grumbling from people about these arrangements, but I find them charming. I've sat at the long table and the bar and I've yet to find the other guests or staff sharing the space obtrusive in any way. All in all, it makes for a somewhat noisy, very friendly atmosphere that fits in with the decor, the service, and especially, the food.\\n\\nThe menu is as unusual as the dining room. You get to choose three items for a fixed price (currently $35, although I wonder how long they can keep it so low). The menu has four categories: salad, meat, fish, and dessert, and there are three small plates in each category. The mathematically inclined among you may have noticed that there are four categories and you only get three choices. You can add a fourth (or more) for another $10 and you'd be mad not to. Picking one from each of the four groups lets your experience how broad-based the chef's skills are. We've been twice now, which means we've tried sixteen different dishes, and we've yet to be disappointed with any of them. \\n\\nMy last visit, I tried the sweet corn agnolotti, the kasu-cured snapper, the roasted pork loin, and the blueberry pie. Items rotate on and off the seasonal menu, so each visit may have a slightly different menu. The agnolotti used a mix of semolina and masa in the pasta, which gave it more corn flavor and seems to have allowed for a lighter, thinner pasta. The matching of the sweet corn, the rich cascabel aoli, and the bite of the roasted garlic was heavenly. It was dusted with just a touch of lime zest to give the dish a little brightness that pushed it into \\"heavenly\\" territory. The snapper was, in my opinion, a show-stopper. The dish was a visual play on nigiri sushi, with the snapper laid on top of marinated crab in place of the sushi rice. The creamy avocado butter had the look of wasabi, but was instead a perfect counterpoint to the slightly-acidic cured fish. The pork loin wasn't quite as successful; the smoked shrimp provided the much-needed flavor boost to the pork, but it wasn't as memorable as the snapper. The okra, however, was julienned  vertically so as to avoid the gummy seeds. It's the best use of okra I've yet encountered. \\n\\nThat brings us to the blueberry pie, which you probably will not get a chance to try as the fresh wild blueberries are now out of season. I'm deeply, deeply sorry for your loss. The small, tart wild blueberries bear almost no resemblance to their inoffensive farm-raised cousins. That said, on both occasions, my companion has opted for the less-sweet cheese dessert and both times has been delighted. My guess is that the only way you could go wrong with the desserts is to skip the course entirely.\\n\\nThe service is calm, casual, and extremely confident. They're there when you want them and seemingly invisible when you don't. There's exceedingly nice folks and they know what they're doing and they certainly don't make you feel like an idiot for asking questions. There's a fairly small beer and wine list, but everything they have is excellent and the staff have been magical at matching drinks to meals. They're also excellent at pacing the meals. The courses arrive at a relaxed pace which is a welcome change from the assembly-line experience at many other restaurants.\\n\\nReservations are must on weekends, especially if you want one of the few small tables to yourself. But, honestly, part of the fun is sharing the experience and catching little shared smiles when the food arrives at the table. This is a special restaurant, and special things are best when shared."},{"name":"Santouka Harvard Square","address":"1 Bow St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Best ramen in Boston.

The dressing was great and it had spicy little pumpkin seeds and a feta-like cheese on it.  We also tried the octopus kebab, and it was mostly mediocre.  The tentacle was a little tough and didn't have a lot of flavor, but the yuca puree it came on was awesome.

My dish came swimming in oil and sauce that tasted like fish sauce. If I wanted non-vegetarian fatty food I wouldn't have ordered vegetable noodles.  I actually had to put a sauce dish under one side of the plate to get the oil to be on one side so I wouldn't be drinking fish oil with my noodles.

He specified very clearly (and answered questions to confirm) that he wanted no shellfish, no squid, no octopus.  He got both a squid and an octopus sushi.  He didn't want to embarrass anyone so did not send the dish back, but mentioned it at the end in case it was a mistake.

Even if not, maybe a waitress should have come back to explain this and offer to give us more of the fish that the customer would eat instead of forcing him to have seafood that he has already said he doesn't want/can't eat?  And am I crazy or should the waitress have said something when bringing the plate of sushi instead of just leaving it without any explanation?  I mean, they brought the place, left, and we stared at the octopus and squid for a few seconds.  If they ran out of vegetables would they have just brought me a stead takiudon, without saying anything?  How is that acceptable?

Is Flat Patties supposed to be high-end? I think not. Is the Back Bay Social Club burger meant to be served and wolfed down like a fast-food burger? Of course not. Grass Fed in Jamaica Plain isn't trying to hide behind anything; they are a neighborhood burger joint serving up fairly simple burgers in an easy-going fashion. That's it. Everything is served a la carte, with single burgers starting at around $6 and climbing up to over $8 in some cases. Fries are on the pricey side: $4 for a small and over $6 for a large, but the small can certainly be a shareable serving size for two. Milkshakes, both adult and regular, round out the focus of the menu (along with other sandwiches and hot dogs), so the sky is literally the limit and will dictate how much you end up spending on a meal.\\n\\nThe bacon cheeseburger ($7.50) is simple, straight-forward and delicious. The wide patty is thin, it's cooked to a medium but no temp on the burger is ever actually asked, which is often the case with the thinner burgers. The seasoning is done properly, highlighting the natural flavor of the presumably grass-fed beef and is far superior in flavor to 99% of the liver-y, and often unspectacular grass-fed beef I've had elsewhere. A soft yet mildly toasted potato roll is the perfect choice and doesn't complicate matters like another bun may have. It soaks up the juices, has a pronounced flavor yet the beef is still the prime suspect. A good chunk of iceberg lettuce is normally something I might scoff at, but here it's crunchy and fresh and adds up to that classic burger flavor profile they worked so hard to achieve. A common tomato tries its best to add to the party but offers little to no benefit other than that quintessential ingredient we all seem to think we need. A mayo based sauce (mayo, pickles, Dijon, cayenne, paprika) is both spicy and sweet and carries throughout the burger in a positive light. Pickles are vinegary and delicious, but borderline less crunchy than the ideal. A couple of slices of bacon are crisp and successful; they do not overpower and even better are not a greasy mess like bacon can often be on a burger. A side of beet fries, unfortunately, are pretty abysmal, and I was disappointed especially with beets being half of my company namesake. They are severely under-seasoned and mostly just taste like raw cornstarch. Truffle-Parm fries are exactly what they need to be: crispy fries with that take-it-or-leave-it truffle oil flavor with a good accent of Parm. They almost have a battered texture to them, which makes them both hollow and crunchy as a whole.\\n\\nGrass Fed delivers the good on a solid all-around burger experience. It adds up though, because a regular burger (which on the smaller side, but additional patties can be added) plus fries already puts it at the $12 mark, and any milkshake or beer addition would make this way more costly than it needs to be. Is it worth a $12-$16 price tag? I'm not sure, but that burger is quite refreshing and balanced, and with an order of truffle-Parm fries instead of the beet variety, I'm a pretty happy camper. This is a neighborhood burger joint worth checking out; it wont make you re-think burgers, but it will deliver a memorable experience."},{"name":"Grindhouse Killer Burgers","address":"1842 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Grindhouse recently put the Impossible Burger on their menu so I like to come here with my vegetarian friends.

No business has been more of a veritably shocking letdown since the horrendous experience at The Adolphus Hotel in Dallas.\\n\\nSaturday morning rolled around and, once again, I found myself on the east side with Jen and Miss Sugarbaker. Consulting my Yelp bookmarks, I requested Blue Dahlia as it had been suggested by church friends at brunch the weekend before. They already culled high marks for their policy of using organic and local products, their green initiatives, and their support of the local community.\\n\\nThe place is adorable. Darling. It's cute as a button. Their front patio would be the perfect place to enjoy a cup of coffee on a sunny day, or catch up with a friend over a light lunch. Unfortunately for us, it was a little windy and cold (and empty), so we requested the back patio.\\n\\nIt's cozy and inviting inside, as you'd expect a French-inspired bistro to be. It was also crowded, which is always a good sign. We were led to the back patio that featured tables that came complete with soft blankets in case it were a bit chilly. As soon as I checked in on Yelp, echoes of approval from friends who adore Blue Dahlia came in quickly. I sat back and awaited to experience what could only be a fabulous lunch.\\n\\nWaitress #1 took our order of iced tea and the cheese platter. Waitress #2 brought out the platter, and the dour scowl on her face was where it all began to go south. She more or less dumped the preserves off on our table before leaving. I figured maybe we wouldn't see her again, so I shrugged it off. The cheese platter was delectable, offering the usual assortment of bleu, brie, and goat cheese. Next to the jams I discovered Nutella, and tasting that again reminded me of my summer in Italy when I'd eat Nutella-filled pastries in the morning before exploring that beautiful country. Ahh. This was nice. And then Waitress #2 came back. \\n\\nShe seemed put out that we asked for more bread (not a whole lot came out initially, mind you). It was then we realized no one had offered to refill our teas, and all of us were dry. We asked, but received no tea for the time being. \\n\\nIt was time to order from Waitress #2. Miss Sugarbaker went for the tomato basil soup and a side bagel, while Jen opted for the French goat cheese tartine with olive tapenade, roasted red peppers & shaved parmesan. I noticed they had a smoked salmon tartine that came with herb cream cheese spread on wheat bread; I asked of they could substitute a salt bagel. Waitress #2 made a face as if I had ordered my salmon dipped in rat poison and served on a dirty hubcap. \\"You mean, you want the salmon, like...ON the bagel..?\\" I replied yes. She gave me another sideways glance like I was a recent insane asylum escapee and said \\"We...don't...well, do that. I mean...you can have a bagel, at an upcharge, with a SIDE of salmon...but that's about all we can do.\\" To this day, I fail to see how requesting a bagel and cream cheese topped with smoked salmon was treated as the most oddball of requests. Even Jen and Miss Sugarbaker were confused by Waitress #2's very real hesitancy. \\n\\nWaiter #3 brought us the meal. A+ for presentation. Miss Sugarbaker liked the soup, and said he enjoyed the more rustic, savory texture rather than one heavy on the cream. Jen said the tartine was \\"just OK\\", but that it was nothing spectacular. She didn't finish half of it. I thoroughly enjoyed my bagel and lox, even though I wasn't served the herb cream cheese it was supposed to come with. The salmon was smoky and not fishy, with a nice texture. That was the most important part. I just wish I had had iced tea to wash it down. Waitress #2 came back around and spat out \\"I see you haven't finished the second round of bread I brought you\\" before walking off. Jen asked: \\"Is this chick for REAL?\\" \\n\\nOur tea was refilled once in the span of an hour. Not sure when tea became such a precious commodity, or when smoked salmon ON a bagel is enough to blow someone's mind, but apparently these are both the case at Blue Dahlia. Waitress #2 didn't win over anyone with her surly attitude, and it certainly didn't help the situation. When it comes to being French, this place nailed it with the laissez faire attitude and unjustified rudeness. \\n\\nAnd the final \\"coup de grace\\"? The check was signed, we were standing up to leave, and Waiter #4 graciously asks to refill our tea. Are you kidding me? It was laughably absurd. \\n\\nJen was pissed enough to want to speak to a manager, but none was around and Miss Sugarbaker just wanted to go. I figured this review would be warning enough. \\n\\nBlue Dahlia stands as an unfortunate example of a restaurant that can have everything working in its favor, and have it all be completely ruined by incredibly subpar service. What's even more appalling is that this occurred while having no less than FOUR people attending our table. What a mess. \\n\\nBlue Dahlia, you dropped the ball.

My sister decided that she wasn't that hungry and wanted for us to split a bowl of noodle soup, I said fine but the waitress wouldn't allow it.  So my sister decides she doesn't want any food, fine, whatever.  We order 3 dishes as there were 4 people, and the waitress begrudgingly gives us our utensils and our food comes.  My mom asks for a small plate or bowl and the waitress, probably seeing that my sister didn't order anything, refuses to give one and we're like k... wahtever.

As I puled off the highway, I remembered all that I drooled over on the voodoo website.  Was it going to be as fantastic as I dreamed?\\n\\nParked across the street (using Portland's strange to me parking system, but hey it works!) and headed over to the line of people waiting to get their hands on something savory.  All I could think about was that Maple Bacon bar!  I took a peek in the store before heading to the end of the line.  I'm guessing there were about 10 voodoo seekers inside hot bakery walls and another 10 people outside.  As I waited, I watched people exit the store holding all kinds of monstrosities in their hands, eyes bulging, mouth anticipating.\\n\\nI finally got the the door and gazed upon the chalkboard menu hanging from the wall.  Where to start.  So many choices and only one stomach!  Again, I continued to watch as one person after another made an entire experience out of drooling over the display case, ordering, paying, and receiving their deep fried friend.  The interior of this place has little to be desired.  If a frat-house had a man-dungeon, this might be it.  The walls were cluttered and seemed dusty - not particularly a place where you'd expect a bakery.  To me, the decorations made it less appealing, so I'm knocking off a 1/2 star from a \\"5\\" - If they had 4.5 stars, I'd give Voodoo that.\\n\\nFinally, it was my turn.  I ordered the Maple Bacon Bar, a Jelly Voodoo Man, and Captain my Captain.  This was going to be my lunch on the road until my next pit stop.  I dove straight into the Maple Bar which didn't look the freshest and maybe had been handled by a few before it sat in the case.  It was a little dry and first thing that came to mind was day old.  Probably not, but even though I think bacon should be wrapped round everything edible, this doo'nut did not live up to the expectations I had hoped for.  The Captain was not yesterday - in fact the frosting was still wet and this little thing was gone faster than I could say \\"ahhhh\\".\\n\\nFinally, my little voodoo doll ... OMG there was this bloody-red jelly spewing out of his neck as I guillotined this poor fellow with my teeth.  Chewy, sugary sweetness.  I then sucked the remaining entrails from his Pillsbury-like belly and within a few seconds pounded the rest of my dough boy down with a large diet coke.\\n\\nBy now, I was 15 miles down the highway and starting to burp up my saccharin-sucrose yeast-leaden mix.

There are SO many choices you have to make. Do you want a salad, pasta, or wrap (called \\"piada\\")? Want to add pasta to your wrap? What kind of meat? Sauce? Toppings? Dressing? (Yes, there are both sauces AND dressings.) Parmesan or mozzarella cheese? Want a drink or side? \\n\\nWhew. I'm exhausted. I'm all about build-your-own, but this is too much. \\n\\nWhen it was finally time to eat, I wasn't impressed. Store-bought tortilla + pasta from a box + watered-down sauce + cheap meat and veggies. Nothing was terrible, but nothing stood out. Anyone could have made this.\\n\\nMy recommendations:\\n\\n1. Cut down on quantity, and focus on quality ingredients. The meat we had was questionable and not fresh. Put one of your employees to work making fresh meatballs and grilling up quality steak and chicken.\\n\\n2. Add a few pre-designed combinations to your menu. This would give your guests a starting point, so they don't feel lost and overwhelmed. \\n\\n(It would also make call-in orders MUCH easier. \\"I'd like a Rosa's Favorite with chicken\\" takes a few seconds.

You really don't need them, especially on a piada. Just turns the whole thing into a runny mess. \\n\\nIt's a unique concept, and I want to like it. But I was disappointed this go-around.

I had no problem with this- there was meat to be had in that area, anyways.  I had to admit that while all the meat dishes were savory, they specialize in fish, and it shows.  The soy/shrimp squares were probably the best I've ever had, although their texture was sort of a surprise.\\n\\nDislikes: The Chinese staff kept looking at two other Caucasian guys and me and repeating \\"General Tso Chicken!\\"- I understand where they are coming from, but .... some of us didn't grow up with American Chinese food from suburban take-outs, full of bland flavor.\\n\\n There's a reason why people go to places like Victoria- they offer authentic cooking at a reasonable price.

Salty in whatever sense of the word will tickle your brain.  From literally salty, heavy food and needing more water to unexpectedly high and uncommon fees - yeaaaa.   Before delving in, here's the quick and dirty:\\n\\n1) Food was a mixed bag - good or mediocre/unimpressive. Nothing standout that made any of us want to come back - ultimate reason for rating, but not the only reason for the rating. However, might come back for brunch given all the awesome reviews.\\n\\n2) Staff overall - very friendly, sweet and patient. Good vibes with a couple mishaps and things that could have improved.  \\n\\n3) Cakeage and living wage fee - Cake cutting fee is $19 per person, not including kids, if you bring your own birthday cake or cake for any occasion. For our table it would have cost $114 to serve cake.  Living wage fee for the evening was $8-9. \\n\\n4) D√©cor - trendy, casual, hip, open. Loved it, and they have outside seating! 5 star on this front.\\n\\n2.5 stars overall \\n---------------------------\\nIf you're down to read an essay here ya go:\\n\\nIt was my cousin's birthday and she was in town from San Francisco with her 5 year old daughter. She wanted something different from our tried and true faves - Craigie and Barcelona Brookline, so she booked dinner at Townsman to celebrate. \\n\\n1. Bread and butter presentation was awesome. Loved it! Very tasty bread, very tasty butter. YUM. \\n\\nThe good dishes: ribs with candied ginger glaze, chicken livers, deviled eggs with hen skin (crispy and delicious!); raw oysters were pretty tasty, liked their garnishes too!\\n\\nMedium: broccoli salad, beef tartare (not bad, I'd say it'd err closer to good but maybe I'm biased because I had better at an Italian restaurant earlier this month); grilled sardine - now this had the right amount of salt and was kinda good but not standout.\\n\\nMeh: Braised chicken leg (unremarkable). Scallops - I'm all for adventurous but wasn't a fan of the balsamic vinegar as the acid or maybe it just didn't work this time around. Not sure which. \\n\\nUncertain: mahi mahi as it never arrived even after our server put the order in again\\n\\n2.  The hostesses were sweet and accommodating, our server also sweet and patient, and the rest of the waitstaff also nice. We needed more water (or perhaps taller water glasses) throughout dinner, and this was in short supply until the end of the meal (they have several different water fillers, or maybe the runners were in charge of doing this?). We saw 5-7 different staff members putting down plates, taking orders, filling waters, clearing plates, etc, so I'm not sure what happened. Also crudo dishes - they forgot to bring 2 of them out and when the server asked the kitchen for it, we ultimately only received one (scallops, we didn't get mahi mahi). Some sort of miscommunication I guess. Also, crudo should be served first since they're cold dishes and simpler to prepare right? Not sure what happened but maybe the universe was telling us to stop pigging out. Overall, service was friendly and all the staff members were sweet and accommodating. \\n\\n3) Ahhh cake fees and living wage fees. Was it a bummer? Yes it was as not everyone in the party was able to sing Happy Birthday to the lady of honor that evening, but we were all in agreement including the b-day gal herself that $114 is more valuable spent elsewhere. While this did make me salty personally, I factored this less into my rating for this restaurant because it was totally my fault for not calling ahead and asking day before/day of. To shed some light: reservation was made the day before by my cousin and I bought the Lady M cakes 40 minutes before dinner started (ok ok ish hit the fan majorly at work and I had to triage up until I could leave work!!). \\n\\nIn general, please call ahead as a courtesy to the restaurant - they need to offset costs as well, of course (and/or they just want you to get their dessert!). They were very sweet in storing both of our cakes in their fridge during dinner without a charge. Our water filler informed us the living wage fee was to pay the chefs more or else they'd have to raise menu prices - something to that effect and I'm sure there's some finance calculation/argument that would justify it. This is an FYI so you're not caught unawares, too. \\n\\n4) Loved the d√©cor. I want the interior decorator's number. \\n\\nOverall, I asked myself, \\"Would I come back for the food or recommend this place to someone else?\\" Since the answer is \\"No\\" I bumped it down to 2 stars.  Would I come again if a friend made dinner plans? Maaaybe. While unlikely, it's not an emphatic \\"no!\\" as maybe it was just that night that the food was just ok and some of the service points could have been better. Maybe I just need to give brunch a chance since this place is getting rave reviews on that front?"},{"name":"Pizzeria Locale","address":"1730 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Pizza is delicious, had the margherita and two glasses of red wine. Yes it's a bit pricey but you're paying for good quality food and drink. We will be back to try more."},{"name":"King + Duke","address":"3060 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My girlfriend and I went to K+D for our anniversary. We had the best, and I mean the best, bone marrow ever! The only problem was with the main courses. Don't get me wrong everything was delicious but, for example, my girlfriend's lamb saddle chop was raw (she does not mind rare at all, so...) and the potatoes were cold. My duck main course was beyond cold as well. Carl, the server, was amazing, very knowledgeable of wine and fixed everything right away. We never got bread with dinner and had to make-do with the bread from the bone marrow app. The octopus appetizer was good but not as good as the one in 4th and Swift.\\n\\nOverall, it was really good but the problems with the temperature on the main courses resulted in the very courteous management comping them.\\n\\nIt could have been 5 stars!"},{"name":"King + Duke","address":"3060 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Went for a work dinner.  Sat in a patio.  Quiet enough for easy conversation.  Food was excellent. Service was good.  One mix up with a beer order but they resolved it quickly.  Duck frites was great and the burger looked very good."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Skip Brunch. While service was great, the meal was just bland. I was expecting much more as this restaurant seems on the nicer side. Great view on the patio, but empty at Brunch. Might have been a sign. If you order a sweet tea, know that it is simple syrup & not actually brewed sweet ~ makes a difference."},{"name":"Broder Caf√©","address":"2508 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Accidentally stumbled into this place when other plans were bust.  It was certainly a happy accident.  I actually ate here twice in two days because it was good enough to beckon me back.

Now it's usually eaten with cornbread crumbled in it, and some hot pepper sauce.  \\n\\nThis place is quite large, with a designated parking lot, and plenty of seating.  We were shown right to a table.  Service was prompt and very warm...complete with a hug, a 'hey  baby' and a 'y'all come back now ya hear!\\"\\n\\nThey have pretty much everything you could ask for on the menu, shrimp & grits, fried chicken and catfish, fried green tomatoes, mac & cheese yadda yadda yadda.   Everything I had was a tad bland for soul food, but our server's great personality added enough spice for me.
