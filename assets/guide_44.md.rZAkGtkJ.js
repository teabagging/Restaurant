It was good, not exactly what I wanted, but I loved the fact that he took the time to talk to me and help me out.\\nSince then I have been back several times. The food is so good! One of my favorite things to get is the tid bit plate because I can choose 4 things out of 11 things. Their crab ragoon is typical but plump with filling so I always get them. Their pork dumplings are also good. Again typical Chinese food fare so we always get them. \\nI really like their shrimp egg foo young. You get 3 big egg inlets packed with veggies and shrimp. They are served in a thin sauce. I get extra white rice with it so I can have my rice soak up the sauce. Egg foo young with rice and covered with siracha sauce is a great dinner.

It had a spicy but not too spicy kick in the mayo. The fried green tomatoes were also really good, but the best part of them was the celery...it was crunchy and was really good in the sauce. \\n\\nFor my entree I got the white bass with sunchokes, onions, cream peas, and polenta. The bass was so fresh tasting, and the peas were creamy without being overly-rich. The sunchokes added a nice contrast in texture, and the polenta was just deliciousness to the umpteenth degree. \\n\\nFor dessert we got a spiced chocolate lava cake with espresso ice cream. After some debate with Billy over the caffeine concentration in espresso ice cream, I decided just to go for it. I'm glad I did. The kick of cayenne at the end made it so different, and definitely in a good way. \\n\\nFor a cocktail I got some sort of purple rum drink with lilacs in it. It could have used a little more citrus, but I didn't squeeze my lime (not a big fan of limes in drinks...too many gin and tonics in my past I suppose). \\n\\nAll in all, quite fantastic.

The veggie lomein and veggie delight had the exact same sauce and veggies in it. So we basically got two orders of veggie delight with some noodles in one of them. The noodles they use are definitely not Asian noodles...I suspect they are linguine. The orange chicken was probably my favorite dish, but only because they use all white meat. \\n\\nOverall, the redeeming factor for this place was that all their food tasted very healthy.

But even that gets kinda old once you realize it's the same decor in all their establishments.  It's like they have a cookie cutter design that they impose on all their pubs.  I guess that's part of how they send their message: \\"Expect the same tired old routine from yet another McMenamins.\\"  Everybody on Yelp complains about the bad service and mediocre food, so why do you tolerate it?  Start sending back bad food!  Stop tipping bad service!  You're just going to encourage the lazy, slacker hippies!  \\n\\nThe food is nearly the same, no matter where you go.  If they even get your order right, it's probably going to be greasy and bland.  The cocktails are overpriced and weak.  And I don't know who told you McMenamins beer is great.  Because it's not.

As we sat at the bar we were greeted by the sweetest bartenders! My friend bought a drink, a lychee martini which was one of the best I've had! And believe me I've had quite a few lychee martinis. I was really hungry so I ordered the lobster wontons for an appetizer and they were absolutely delicious! The creaminess of the lobster with a little kick combined with the sweet sauce on top with the saltiness of the caviar was the best bite of a wonton I've ever had! If Chinese restaurants could replace crab rangoons for this wonton I would eat it every day!! As for dinner, I ordered a steak medium rare, which came with a sundried tomato crust and wasabi mashed potatoes. The crust on the steak was a perfect amount of crunch and flavor and the steak itself was extremely juicy! The wasabi mashed potatoes were amazing as well, with the normal taste of potatoes with a very subtle taste of wasabi. My friend ordered the fried chicken and lobster mac and cheese, however she is extremely allergic to shellfish so had to order it without the lobster (therefore I had the appetizer all to myself, not complaining at all here). The fried chicken was HUGE!! I was quite surprised! It also came with fried seaweed on top which she asked me if she was supposed to eat or not and proceeded to eat all of it. I never had a chance to try her food but she said it was AMAZING.

After that she kind of disappeared.  We watched as other tables that were seated after us placed their orders and even received their food before our waitress even came back for our orders.  I gave her the benefit of the doubt anyway. You write you own order down which lessens the margin for mistakes, however I never received the sweet tea I ordered. It wasn't a big deal and didn't make the meal unenjoyable, but it was noted.\\n\\nShe brought mix basket of bread, which included cornbread, yeast rolls and cinnamon rolls. The cornbread was pretty disappointing but the other two were melt in your mouth delicious! I ordered the four fried chicken legs with a side of macaroni and cheese and sweet potato souffl√©.

We had a blast and ended up playing another few games afterward. \\n\\nI love the huge selection of games they have - everything from low-skill but super fun party games to really intense role-playing or dice ones. The stickers on the sides of the boxes makes it really easy to find one (tells you the type of game, how many players and approximately how long the game play is) and ALL of the employees are knowledgable and friendly and more than willing to help out.\\n\\nAs others have mentioned, there is a $5 library fee, which gives you access to as many games as you would like. They have a wide array of drinks (coffee, wine, beer, cider, unique sodas etc.) and some snacks. There are a good amount of tables, set for different groups sizes. I love that all the tables and chairs are mismatched - it leads to a really cozy feel - like you're in your parents basement playing games. The only downfall is that there is no air conditioning which during a hot day like the day I went, can lead to a sweaty, stuffy environment. \\n\\nWe will definitely be back (often!) and I highly encourage others to check it out as well.

They have a patio with a bar in the back, and a ping pong table to make an ass of yourself with while you wait.

At the very worst you go sit on the stoop outside and crack a beer while you wait for your pizza, not a bad deal.\\n\\nMy only issue was that some of the pizza's were not always that filling or hearty. This may be because I am used to Chicago style and don't get as much thin crust, but I've had some thin crust before that still fills me up no problem.

He got a calzone with sausage, bacon, mushrooms, and onions, and I ordered the carbonara with penne. The first bad sign was when I pulled my pasta out of the bag to find that they hadn't made the carbonara with penne, but with linguini. \\n\\nThe carbonara was possibly the worst I'd ever had. The sauce was thick, bright white, clearly the same they used for alfredo, and tasted like Betty Crocker alfredo powder. The \\"bacon and ham\\" was a good amount of ham (which was cut deli-thin, weird...) and NO BACON. To top it all off, the pasta was overcooked.\\n\\nThe garlic bread that came with it was a chunk of stale, dense Italian bread that I don't think would set off a reaction in someone allergic to garlic. \\n\\nThe calzone was probably the highlight of the meal, but my boyfriend described it as \\"boring\\", \\"rubbery\\", and \\"stingy on the good ingredients\\". \\n\\nOver all, I'm convinced that their pizza must be sprinkled with fairy dust, because the rest of their food is most definitely not four and a half star quality."},{"name":"Alchemy Caf√©","address":"625 Parsons Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"We hands down go here too much- ALCHEMY SPONSOR US ;) just kidding, but really.\\n\\nFood: fresh, vegan friendly, and good for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

The Chai Tea had a bit too much spice? - something was off.\\n\\nNow, The Renedict - everything was good, but what threw it off a bit was the hollandaise sauce.  It was a bit too lemony?  I know it is not a regular hollandaise, which is fine but there was too much of it and the taste was off a bit.  But, everything else about the Renedict was fabulous!  From the buttery ciabatta on the bottom to the perfectly cooked over easy egg and the fresh tomato & spinach to the last little bit of soy bacon on top.

Server was helpful but was like pulling teeth.  Food for the most part was excellent.  We had party of 4 and shared 8 tapas.  Some standouts were the beets.  Beautiful plate and that jalape√±o sauce I could put on anything.  Ceviche was also excellent and the crab stuffed avocado.  One dish really fell short for whole table was the octopus kabob.  Was tough and just not that good.  Also wouldn't order the purple potato and chicken stack again.  Very one note and kind of bland.  Shared creme br√ªl√©e trio for dessert.

There were two women and a younger guy working the front area at the registers.  I watched the guy dig through a trash can with his bare hands as though he dropped something by accident while talking to one of the other women.\\n\\nAfter digging through the trash, he chatted for a few more minutes, and then turned around, and packaged my food without washing his hands.  I could not even believe what I was witnessing.

I checked in with my husband and 2 year old daughter, and the hotel staff seemed very accommodating, even calling me prior to my trip to ask if we needed any kind of rollaway bed or special unit for our toddler. They have 2 minor friendly restaurant/bars, and even had a daily evening showing of My Little Pony in the theatre. But the truth is that McMenamins Kennedy School needs to be more upfront and honest about the fact that they are not a good vote to stay at with kids under 5. There are no bathtubs, only tiny single shower stalls for bathing kids. So oh can imagine when I tried to take my 2 year old in there, she absolutely lost her mind, screamed bloody murder and cried, even for a full 3 minutes after we took her out of the shower, and literally all we were able to do was to get her hair wet. She was traumatized and wouldn't go near the bathroom after that. Second issue is our room was uncomfortably cold all night. They give you a tiny space heater to keep your room warm, which does not much at all. There was freezing cold air coming from the vent in the ceiling and when I inquired about it the lady at the desk told me that the thermostat for our room had been switched to cold when it should have been on heat. Even when they switched the heat on, it did very little to warm our room. It was quite uncomfortable, and my daughters nose would not stop running. Third, we are at the Courtyard restaurant there, and I'm pretty sure my husband and I got mild food poisoning. We had dinner there (the only thing we had eaten that day since traveling), and we both woke up in the wee hours of the morning puking our guts up. We also noticed a very odd smell coming from our food, almost overwhelming. By about 8am we decided we had had quite enough and made reservations elsewhere for a MUCH more enjoyable stay. Kennedy School would be great if you don't have kids and just want a place to go drink or wander the historic halls of the school, it's aesthetic is breathtaking. But that's all the good I can say, besides that despite all of the negative situations the staff there was very friendly and helpful as much as they were able."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I love Home Slice!!

After perusing online menus for about a day and a half I settled on Two Urban Licks.  After reading reviews on yelp, however, I was a bit hesitant due to the complaints of how loud it gets and how hard it is to find. I am very happy to say that this was the absolute perfect place for 2 kids in lovey love to go on a Saturday night.\\n\\nWe walked into Two Urban Licks and yes it was loud, but man was it cool.  The kitchen is in the center of the restaurant with the tables surrounding it. I think that may add to some of the loudness. We were seated outside on the patio & our server came over pretty quickly.  He gave us a 10 minute explanation of the food, the wine, and how his dad was a dentist in the army & loved it. Weird, I know. Anyway, we started with the tuna tartar & brisket empanadas. I wasn't the biggest fan of the tuna tartar app because it had a very creamy sauce on top & I'm not into mayo/creamy sauces. The empanada was delicious & the brisket was so perfectly tender & tasty. I ate it up like it was going outta style. We then ordered an apple & pulled pork over goat cheese ravioli appetizer, a salad with plantain chips on top, and the bistro steak to split.\\n\\nThe pulled pork/apple appetizer was really good. It was an interesting combination of flavors and textures. I thought the goat cheese was a bit too powerful, but the cooked apple & pulled pork made up for it. Seriously, it was divine. The salad was really good & had a lemon dressing. The dressing was definitely homemade and really refreshing. The steak had a chimichurri sauce on top with mushrooms and garlic mashed potatoes underneath. It was honestly the most tasty & tender piece of steak I've had in a looooong time (sorry dad!).  Our waiter was very good about bringing out the dishes, but not rushing us after delivering the food. In fact if I wouldn't have been with mister manfriend I probably would have gotten a bit annoyed by his absence. We then decided on a dessert....a fancy banana split.\\n\\nThe bananas had been cooked with brandy, so they were very rich & yummy. The came out on a bed of peanut brownies & topped with homemade whipped cream & three different flavored sorbets. The only problem at this point was that it had gotten very dark outside & 4 tiki torches are not enough light for the entire patio. I was having a very hard time reading the dessert menu, the bill, etc. I felt like it was that moment when you're 40 & realize you can no longer see the small print on menus. Kind of like living in a nightmare for a few minutes-scary!\\n\\nAnyway, after all this food, three 24 ounce cans of Coors Light (classy, I know), and a dessert wine our bill was.....$93.00. Yep, that's it. I love the south except for all the republicans. If I ever go back to Atlanta I am definitely hitting up this spot & if anyone else is heading to Atlanta, please check it out. It's really unbelievable."},{"name":"Sweet Cheats","address":"692-B Kirkwood Ave SE, Ste B1","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I'm a little bit obsessed with desserts and this is definitely one of my favorites in Atlanta.

There are times (like today) when both the service and food are very good, making the restaurant deserving of a 4 star rating. There are other times, when the service is terrible, slow and the food ends up coming out cold. These visits call for a 3 star rating.\\n\\nThe good things about Bar 145 are their burgers, bourbons and live music. The local cover bands that i've heard play here have been quite good. Their burgers are pretty tasty, I must say, but they are pricey starting at $11.99. They even have a $19.99 burger if you're feeling \\"baller.\\"\\n\\nThey also have a Wednesday burger night where you build your own burgers starting at $5 (as opposed to $9). $5 gets you a pretty basic burger and the price quickly adds up for additional toppings (even cheese is an extra $1). For this reason, I would say that Bar Louie and Brazenhead's burger nights are a better value, but Bar 145 is better in terms of taste.\\n\\nThey have a decent happy hour, with discounts on most alcoholic beverages. The one thing that stops me from being totally enamored with their happy hour is their lack of craft beer on special. Only their domestic beer is discounted, which is a bummer. But I guess, I shouldn't complain about $2.50 beer. \\n\\nIn term of happy hour snacks, they have quite a few options to choose from. Their pretzel bites with cheese fondue are great for sharing, but my favorite thing has been their tempura green beans. They are slightly salty, sweet and perfectly crunchy. The fact that they are green beans is also less guilt inducing. \\n\\nOverall Bar 145 is a good bar with some pretty decent food, especially their burgers. However, I've found their service to be inconsistent at times, with food coming out slow and cold. For this reason i'm giving them 3.5 stars."},{"name":"Santouka Harvard Square","address":"1 Bow St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I really liked the ramen here, but it didn't change my life.

We were there on a Tuesday night and it wasn't very busy.  It's a good place for catching up and chats between close friends.\\n\\nThe place is higher priced than their neighbouring restaraunts and bistro on Main Street as their food quality is comparable to fine dining.

The fried pickles, peppers, and okra app was great. The bbq chicken was fine although the Alabama white sauce I ordered with it was a little thicker than the traditional. It worked better as a dip for the onion rings which were great. Pork was fine. The biggest disappointment were the prices. Now bbq has become one of the most overpriced cuisines these days and their prices were not unlike most of the other bbq joints in town so i can't fault them for that but the beer...the beer. Come on. I understand craft brew drinkers are more willing to pay for better beer but these prices were outrageous. $18 for a pitcher of Bud Light. $22 for a pale ale. That's $5.50 a beer! Just crazy. This makes dinner for two plus a pitcher and tip around $60. I can smoke a pork butt at home, buy buns, bbq sauce and a twelve pack for less than $20 and feed 5+. It really sucks too because this is someplace I could see hanging out at weekly. A pitcher of domestic light should cost less than $10, it's $8 at my favorite wing joint in Sandy Springs.

However, the blue cheese on the top layer made up for the bottom - just the right amount of blue cheese crumbles gave the burger a nice tangy flavor.

I love the funkiness, LOVE the art and the prices are very reasonable.  I could overlook some of their shortcomings (mediocre food, so-so wine and coffee) because they were made in-house and maybe they needed time to refine.\\n\\nI don't live In The PNW and they don't have anything like McM properties where I live so I look forward to my stays.  \\n\\nI noticed a distinct difference in the level of service this last visit.  The front desk staff, while seemingly knowledgeable, we're highly indifferent. We had a little bit of musical rooms going on due to the fact that we were staying with family with the same name.  While it ended up being figured out, the verbal gripe aboutus goingon between the front desk staffers that we encountered as we approached the front desk shortly thereafter was highly unprofessional.\\n\\nWe had 2 roll-aways in our room and neither was made up the next day, though the king bed was.  It was odd to come back to only one of three made up beds.\\n\\nOur used glasses were not replaced and, although we left the wet towels on the floor as requested if we wanted new ones, we returned to a pile of wet towels on the floor.\\n\\nWe went as a group to the courtyard restaurant and, although there were multiple seating options open and available, we were told we would have to wait 10 minutes to be seated.  We asked if we could sit at the requested table to wait , figuring the 10 minute wait had to do with keeping the waiter from being overloaded-  we had 5 children with us and the waiting area consisted of one bench which was occupied.  Without offering any explanation the host said, no sorry, it'll be 10 minutes.  We watched the table we requested for 10 minutes... Nothing was done to it... We never could figure out why we couldn't be seated right away.\\n\\nWe spent 3 nights at the Kennedy School.  At 3AM night 1- the fire alarm went off.  It is a very frightening experience to be jarred awake in a strange room at that hour.  Since we did not smell smoke, we turned on the lights, dressed more appropriately and headed out to see what was going on.  10 minutes of waiting in the hallway for some type of direction from the staff, hmmm, not a single sign of anyone.  10 more minutes of ear splitting alarm, strobe lights while my husband prowess the property for someone, anyone, to tell us what is going on... Still no smell of smoke.  All the guests are milling around the hallways wondering what's going on, the lights and alarm making it impossible to go back into the rooms.  Finally, I call the hotel from my cell phone... Some one actually answers the phone calmly!... I hear no alarm.  I ask what is going on and the woman tells me, \\"we are trying to figure that out.\\" another 10 minutes later and the alarm turns off, only to go on again 2 minutes later.  The issue was finally resolved 10 minutes later for good.  Never did see ANYONE from the hotel, nor was there any apology or explanation from the staff in any form.\\nThe next day I was told by someone that the alarm was set off by a drunken bar customer who thought it would be fu to pull the alarm... \\n\\nThe wait staff at all the bars -Bartenders and waiters - were all friendly... Although a bit slow and not detail oriented ( we had to ask for water more than once, same for subsequent drinks, mustard, extra napkins, etc).  Food was slow in coming but always served with a smile.  \\n\\nOne evening I walked to the courtyard rstaurant and ordered a sundae to take back to my room for my kids.  The restaurant was not crowded... It took 40 minutes...\\n\\nAfter Our 3 days at Kennedy School we were slated to stay 3 days at Old St Francis in Bend OR... I was certain that our poor experience was going to be relegated to Kennedy School... Boy was I wrong!!  **See my review of Old St Francis.\\n\\n\\n THE COMBiNED POOR EXPERIENCE OF OUR 6 DAYS STAY AT MCMENAMINS PROPERTIES AND THE UNPROFESSIONAL MANNER OF CERTAIN FRONT DESK STAFFERS PROMPTED US TO CANCEL OUR FIANL 3 DAYS."},{"name":"McMenamins Kennedy School","address":"5736 NE 33rd Ave.","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I'm not too keen on McMenamins, as they normally have the same feel as going to a Red Robin.

It's an experience to have at least once. You can even stay in the hotel they have on-site if this is really your jam. By the way, it's totally haunted, so have fun with that. \\n\\nThe barstaff are a lil crusty and don't want to serve your group what they deem to be \\"too many\\" drinks, i.e., two at a time.\\n\\nGo and say you did because people will seem to keep asking you if you've been."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Went here with my staff while on a retreat in Atlanta and it was pretty good!

First, as others have mentioned, the bunkers stink and have no sand. Judging by past comments about this, I wouldn't expect a change any time soon. Tee boxes, fairways and greens were in decent shape considering it is February golf.\\n\\nMy main complaint comes with the staff. I played on 2/6 and received and email during the week to call and see if there was a delay due to frost. I had a 1120 tee time so I called at 9am. I was told there was a delay but that would be made up by my tee time and to show up on time. Another in our group called and he was told we would go off around 12. \\n\\nI showed up at 11 thinking we would tee of between 1145-12. I was told at checkin they were back on time and I would be teeing off at 1120. I skipped the range and just hit a few putts because I didn't have enough time. Frustrated that I didn't get to warm up, I went to the tee box at 1115. The starter told me there was 5 groups ahead of me. So, I would have had time to warm up if the pro shop had not stated they were on time. Others in my group were also upset. They were over 45 minutes behind. Total bs from the pro shop.\\n\\nFast forward to the 7th hole and we are already 2 hours in with groups stacked in front and behind us. We were on a 6+ hour pace. When the Marshall came to check on us I complained about the pace, and he stated there was no gaps and everyone was keeping up. IF that was the case (doubtful), the first group was playing at that pace and not forced to speed up. The round took 6 hours in the end, way too long, especially with the temperatures. I wish the marshals did their job.\\n\\nGreat course but I don't know if I would go again unless I had nothing to do ALL day."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I change my mind completely!

Yelp only has 4 reviews to this point, but they are all uniformly spouting its excellence. So, I decided to give it a shot. Now, I can be counted amongst the fans here.\\n\\nIf I had to use one word, and maybe this doesn't sound too hot as a choice, I would say \\"transparent.\\" Let me explain why I think this idea is important, appropriate, and a reason to run right out and give Alana's a shot.\\n\\nEvery fork-full of food I put into my mouth tasted purposeful and genuine. The ingredients were clear and each and every one tasted like it was chosen because of its quality and special role in each dish. There was no mystery to what I ordered. It was pure and excellent... Transparently so!\\n\\nFirst, we tried the cold soup sampler and each one would have been a refreshing, and satisfying, choice on its own but it was a good opening to the chef's style of preparation. The gazpacho was chock full of fresh vegetables that grew in character as they mingled in the bowl, convincing me it had been prepared right before it was placed before us. The vichyssoise was simple with clear indications of its individual ingredients and each one's quality in the mix (this was where \\"transparent\\" first crossed my mind.) The corn curry soup was exciting in it's mixture of individual elements and how they each competed with each other. It was almost the opposite of the way the vichyssoise's ingredients worked together, but just as effective on the taste buds.\\n\\nMy salad was a tomato, and mixed greens under a crab/cheese/vegetable/dressing mixture, and I am not doing its combined ingredients justice in that slash combo above, but the flavor interaction was fantastic. There were so many subtle things going on that I became incredibly focused with each bite and was pretty disappointed when it was all gone.\\n\\nI didn't want to go overboard, so I ordered a pasta and squash in garlic,lemon, and Parmesan sauce as an entree and it was very straightforward and best enjoyed while slowly savoring each bite. If rushed, I probably would have thought it wasn't as good as the rest, but it revealed itself as a worthy part of the meal.\\n\\nAlana's is an excellent spot for dinner and I am excited about going back when I visit Columbus again. The staff was very friendly and the environment was comfortable and genuine (although I wasn't a fan of the current artist on display). The pace was leisurely and some might get impatient with it, but I found it to be a nice, extended, experience.

They have a great beer selection, plus interesting drinks and creative foods.  Last 2 times I went I had some sort of venison sausage, and of course the Notorious PIG (sausage with mac and cheese on it). Most of their sausages are made there. Also an espresso with chile and cinnamon, and some good dark beers and a summer wheat.  My friends got cocktails with herb and mint that looked pretty good.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere is basically wood floors, high industrial ceilings, and sausage themed art (if there ever was such a thing).  The wait staff is typically helpful, especially the waiter with the sideburns if you can get him... he said just ask for the guy with the sideburns.  And its sort of famous, like Thai Passion and their wall of celebs who have visited.  Last time I was at Frank I heard Pee Wee Herman (not sure of his name) was there...which is pretty amusing.  \\n\\nWith an ideal, central location, great food and drinks, and a fun atmosphere (plus a fairly cheap meal), i'd recommend it."},{"name":"The Bancroft","address":"15 Third Ave","city":"Burlington","stars":"4","text":"I give this restaurant top marks for ambience, decor, service, people, wines, and food. We had dinner at The Bancroft last nite and all four of us were very pleased with our experience there. I had the risotto/lobster entree and while it was very flavorful I found it a little too salty but that didn't ruin the overall dish. We had an awesome waiter named Jason. He is the best waiter I have ever dealt with in a fine restaurant. He was friendly, knowledgeable, and on the ball. Really great guy. I have only one negative comment regarding the craft cocktails the restaurant has to offer. There are many craft cocktails on the menu but the one I had called Smoke and Daggers was just awful. It was bitter, and the flavors of the number of liqueurs included in the drink made the taste awful. It was as though the bartender just poured a bunch of liqueurs into a glass and gave the concoction a name. Maybe others like this drink but I didn't like it at all. \\n\\nI hope The Bancroft survives for many years to come. Great restaurants are hard to come by in  communities outside Boston.

Whenever I'm in Boston, I make time to come here for a hearty breakfast.\\n\\nAs others have said, there's usually a line (esp on weekends during peak times) and they don't take reservations, but you know what? Waiting in that line with some great friends who aren't in a hurry has consistently been a pleasure. The whole sensory experience: anticipating the food, smelling it as the kind Mexican workers who own the place cook it for ya and sliding your tray down the line as if you're back in your high school cafeteria, but with far superior food.\\n\\nTheir $6 or so breakfast special with two eggs, home fries and coffee is great. The home fries they serve are delightfully addicting, the eggs always perfectly cooked to order. The coffee could be better - it's your typical diner fare. Would love if they sourced some higher quality beans.\\n\\nThe blueberry / banana pancakes are full of freshly cooked dough with tasty bits of fruit. It's worthwhile to pay a little extra for real maple syrup, otherwise you may just ruin this divinely crafted plate of flapjacks. I love how you can just order 1 pancake to try. I haven't eaten lunch here, but they also serve some mighty-fine lookin' sandwiches. I speculate, but I imagine they must be great.\\n\\nIf you're visiting Boston and have some time for breakfast, don't let The Paramount pass you by.

My our usual Corner Grill was packed so we decided to give this place a try. For starters my glass of water was dirty and had black dots floating around in it. Our waitress somehow seemed to get lost, though it was not extremely busy, so I asked the next available waiter for another glass of water, he politely said okay but never came back with it. The waitress finally brought our food: MINE: french toast, salmon scramble, and a side of potatoes; MY GUEST: buckwheat pancakes, salmon scramble, applewood bacon and a side of grits, but no silverware. After about 2 minutes of sitting we asked again the next available waitress for silverware. I unrolled the silverware to see an extremely dirty knife that had food still on it, my guest uncovered the same. As she walked away she saw the disgust on my face and asked if everything was okay. I explained to her that cleaner silverware was needed and she quickly ran and got them. Again we had no idea where I waitress was. The French toast was definitely nothing special, it was one small piece of Challah bread, (I honestly expected more at that size) but the compote was delicious. The scramble was very good too but the potatoes which are not fresh cut, you can tell they are previously frozen, were room temperature at best and hard. Again I had to send that back and ask for FRESH potatoes. As you can imagine by the time it came out the French toast was gone and the eggs were halfway finished. The buckwheat pancake was very dry and room temperature is well. I've had many buckwheat pancakes before and because they have the propensity to be a bit more bitter then regular pancakes typically a nice fruit compote or butter balances it out. The menu says this came with a honey butter but there was no butter on this pancake and you could tell it in the taste. All in all I was not impressed with this restaurant at all. I think management should advise their staff to make a greater effort to ensure dishes come out clean the FIRST TIME as well as have the cook notify waiters as soon as the food is up. Some, like my guest, don't mind room temperature food. I however am very particular and like my food hot and fresh. I believe this place took over the old \\"Pecan\\" resturant which was overpriced and not good.  If they want to compete with the other restaurants in the area including \\"Feed Store\\", they need to step it up .This definitely will not become a new \\"Regular\\" for us, maybe a second or third backup if Corner Grille or Thumbs Up is packed again."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Although we dined at the restaurant about half an hour before they were about to close the service was still exceptional.

However, their use of grass-fed beef allows them to charge a premium. For those that aren't health nuts, grass-fed beef is healthier for you as it is lower in saturated fat, and higher in omega-3 fats.

They often do have a wait, but it is well worth it because I have never been to another restaurant where you can practically watch pasta being rolled out from scratch a mere meter away from your table. That is how fresh the food is there and probably why Ask For Luigi remains as one of the best hidden pasta gems in Vancouver. \\n\\nThe only downside is that if you do come for other meal times, you unfortunately are not going to be able to have the dish you love and being the creature of habit as I am, I always gravitate towards what I am comfortable with.

My focus is on the curried chicken salad, its really good.  Problem with chicken salad is finding the balance between savory and sweet.  It swings either too savory or overly sweet.  The curry chicken was light not overpowering which happens often when using curry. The grapes balance it out.  I read the menu saying it contains pecans, but I didn't taste any.  Good I didn't because I'm allergic to pecans.  Nothing else stood out besides the chicken salad but the deserts look tasty."},{"name":"Lenoir","address":"1807 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"A friend had dined at Lenoir and was dying to go back - I happily agreed. Lenoir has a prix fixe menu, and our server informed us that we could pick as many items from any section to make our 3 choices. I said \\"So I could choose three desserts?\\" She soberly nodded yes, that indeed I could.\\n\\nWell, I didn't, but I was still completely happy with our selections. We chose items that both of us were interested in and shared everything - we considered adding a course, but ended up having PLENTY of food. \\n\\nAs is my wont, we started with sparking wine - a glass of prosecco and a glass of gamay, just to see how they differed. The prosecco was right on target - the gamay was lyrical and delicious and we were already super duper happy. \\n\\nDishes sampled (oh, okay - gobbled with glee):\\n\\nSweet potato agnolotti - this ravioli-type pasta was delectable, and the lime brown butter offered a delicious counterpoint. But the marshmallow piped at the edge of the plate a lightly toasted stole the show.\\n\\nPoha-crusted Drum - poha is some sort of crispy rice, and the super crisp crust on this drum made the fish inside moist and delicious. \\n\\nSmoked Quail - Probably my favorite of all the choices, the crisp quail was stuffed with a lightly seasoned dirty rice and was super tasty.\\n\\nRoasted Antelope - slices of a tenderloin-style cut were served beautifully medium rare in a star anise flavored pho broth with savory matzoh balls.\\n\\nPistachio Kulfi - this Indian-style ice cream was a bit of a mystery, and probably my least favorite, but still interesting and tasty - I felt that the flavors were a bit too subtle by this point in the meal.\\n\\nImperial Stout Chocolate Cake - a scene-stealer, this chocolate cake would have made my husband weep with joy. \\n\\nThe restaurant is tiny and a bit crowded, with a funky decor that looks like salvaged bits from the Goodwill home store, but it all comes together in an intimate, cozy environment. Our server was very knowledgeable and the meal timing was impeccable. Only a couple of marginally negative thoughts ... the wine list is missing quality wines at \\"reasonable\\" bottle prices - the by the glass prices are about what you'd expect, but bottle prices are $40 and up, which feels a bit steep. \\n\\nOverall, though, hats off to Lenoir for a lovely dining experience - I'll be back with the husband, so he can try that cake!"},{"name":"Rheinlander German Restaurant","address":"5035 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Wound up in here last night, sort of a last-minute unplanned kinda thing.

I love it when i don't have to ask for a refill on my Coke. Sara was great.\\n\\nOkay so everyone knows this is a German-themed restaurant, so i wasn't shocked by their lack of vegan items. Vegetarian-friendly... meh. Kinda. I wound up with a nice-sized serving of penne alfredo and a Bavarian pretzel with a bit of Swiss fondue. If you're a vegetarian, these are pretty much your only options... i'm sure if you ask really nice, they'd give you different dressing on a Caesar salad. Anyway... happy hour portions are smaller but it was enough for a good meal. I could have forgone the fondue and still been satisfied.\\n\\nTotal for a Coke, penne, and pretzel with side of fondue came to $9.24. Food is pretty good, service was good and atmosphere was comfy.

I didn't know what to expect when we drove to this place. It looked like a hole-in-the-wall place...which usually means good cheap food. And yes... that is what this place is good and cheap, but not hole-in-the-wall at all. It is what I would imagine a Southern tea room to be.To me, this restaurant represents the dainty and quaint side of the South with all of the affects of Southern hospitality.\\n\\nAs I peer through the window of this resturant, the first thing that I notice is the humongous hostess station with pretty white baskets on the counter. Then the plush emerald green carpets and the very white walls. As we walk in we join the very many people waiting without a reservation. The chairs and benches for waiting are also white with ornate decoration. For some reason, I feel like this is a very warm, comfy, and homey place. I feel happy and excited because I can't wait for what is to come. The staff is very friendly and love to converse about everything. Even though there are many people waiting, there isn't a long wait. Why? Because as small as this place looks from the outside, it is expansive on the inside. There are a multitude of rooms for dining, each with its own original name. There is even a buffet room. This place isn't just \\"a\\" tea room... it's a bunch of tea rooms. And the wall hangings are just beautiful. In addition, the walls are full of black-and-whites of stars and politicians that have dined here including the Dalai Lama and Richard Gere. \\n\\nWe get seated and I notice that there are many groups in the same room. It is well lit and it isn't noisy despite all of the groups of people in celebration of something. Our waiters are friendly... And I say waiters plural because we had one waiter to check on us, tell us stories, and give me a back rub (Yes i received a back massage and it was damn good!!), another waiter to serve our water, and another waiter to serve our food. The menu and order ritual is similar to that of The hamburger place the Counter or japanese restaurants for sushi... where you read a menu and then checkmark what you want on a piece of paper. You get to pick an entree and it comes with 2-side dishes and a dessert of your choice. We also order fried green tomatoes (an appetizer that \\ni always wanted to try in the actual South) and of course SWEET TEA!!! We also request a complimetary Pot Likker since I am a newbie to the tea room. \\n\\nI honestly love most everything that we ate in this place. The sweet tea is homemade and refillable (we each drank 3-5 glasses). And we received a fresh batch each time and each batch tasted different but good. Everyone is served complimentary bread. The bread basket includes cinnamon rolls, cornbread and buttermilk biscuits. The cinnamon rolls are divine!! They don't have icing, which I can very much do without, and the rolls are not too sugary with the cinnamon. They are perfect. The cornbread is rather dry for my taste and the buttermilk biscuits were scrumptious and moist. I couldn't have seconds of the rolls or the biscuits because I knew that I had to leave space for the entrees and the dessert. The complimentary pot likker was absolutely delicious with its cracklin cornbread, bits of bacon, and floating greens cooked in chicken stock. I would eat the pot likkers as a bowl of soup if I could. The fried green tomatoes appetizer was juicy, tart and not too oily. \\n\\nFor our main meals, the fried chicken was cooked to perfection... juicy and not salty like KFC. The meat loaf was yummy and moist. And the tomato sauce served on top did not taste like ketchup which is a plus. The side of mac and cheese was very authentic. It is very good, but not good for the body. The mac and cheese is very rich and fatty. It congeals as it cools down. The sweet potato souffle just wasn't for me. If you are a fan of candied yams then this would be a dish for you. The souffle was too sweet and full of cinnamon. It was more dessert-like. The cole slaw was just right. It didn't need the addition of salt and pepper and the veges were crunchy, indicating that the slaw isn't too creamy and drenched in dressing. \\n\\nFor dessert, we both picked the peach cobbler which was a good size. It is pretty good but I have had better at the Green Mesquite BBQ place in Austin, Texas. The peaches were canned and seasoned well with cinnamon and sugar. It wasn't too sweet. It is the crust that doesn't get my 5-star approval. It didn't have enough butter and taste to it. \\n\\nOf course with all of this food, neither of us could completely finish our meals. The portions were huge. We both had food coma and I had to run to the bathroom twice. Because the food is so rich, it just all accumulated in the belly and didn't want to move. I desperately needed to exercise to get it out of me... or drink coffee.

Never noted the restaurant because it is in the back of the plaza.  But it is worth the search.\\n\\nUpon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by a man that I believe to be the owner.  He told us about the no corkage fee and told us of the nearest place to buy wine if we desired to go grab some before being seated.  We opted to be alcohol free and we were seated immediately (surprising for a Friday night since many reviews note the crowds on the weekends; I'm chalking it up to the bad weather keeping folks at bay).\\n\\nAnyway, we had one waiter (the person that took our order) but we had about two other servers.

All were good except the tikka masala.  The chicken shingaara was a fried dough pocket filled with great seasoned ground chicken meat and veggies.  The vindaloo was really spicy (just like I like it) and had lots of sauce to dip the naan in.  The naan was the best naan I have had.  Soft, garlicky, and good for sopping up sauces. YUM!!!  So glad we decided to go for it over the plain naan.  The tikka, how can I put it, was not good.  I mean it was edible but it lacked the flavor of the usual tikka spices and the tomato flavor was overpowering.  In short, I've had better.

They loved that our server was appropriately \\"Austin\\" (sassy and had tattoos) but was also attentive and friendly. Not to mention the delicious food!

It had a good savory, almost sweet, flavor that worked well against the saltiness of the Vienna beef dog. The cheese wasn't bad, but not great either. I think the mellowness of it (is this a mild cheddar?) kind of negated the subtle flavors in the rest of the dog. \\n\\nZwiebelwurst - 4.5 Stars - A brat served on a crusty roll with caramelized onions and horseradish mustard (which actually looked like horseradish and deli mustard).

Unfortunately, I was extremely underwhelmed.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is great.  The place is clean, nicely decorated and very homey.  My first disappointment came as we were about to order, the server gave my guest and I two 'order sheets' and asked us to complete our orders using the pencils provided on the tables.  I was extremely confused.  It was very unusual for the server not to take the order.  When I asked both the server and hostess passing by, neither could give an explanation as to why guests were expected to write their own orders.\\n\\nUpon tasting of the Pot Likker appetizer, I, once again was very disappointed.  The cornbread was dry and crunchy, while the pot likker itself tasted of collard greens in salt water.  There were no other discernible flavors.  \\n\\nFor my entree, I ordered the fried pork chops, potato salad, fried okra and cheese grits.  The pork chops were good, fried nicely, seasoned well and moist inside.  However, the sides left more to be desired.  The potatoes in the potato salad were unevenly cut, which made the overall texture inconsistent and unpleasant.  The cheese grits tasted like instant grits and were watery and flavorless.  The okra was regular.\\n\\nI really wanted to like this place, however, when I compare to other southern style/soul food restaurants in the country it is quite evident that this restaurant is sub-par.  \\n\\nFor good soul food, I recommend:\\n\\nAmy Ruth's (Harlem, NY)\\nRoscoe's (Los Angeles, CA)\\nMacArthur's (Chicago, IL)\\nO'leans (Tallahassee, FL)\\nThe Lady & Sons (Savannah, GA)"},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"You can get a really filling vegetarian meal for not much $$ at Bouldin Creek. I love the house special salad with the apples and goat cheese. They add slivers of basil to their salad and it's a real treat! The beans in the Slacker's Meal are savory and not spicy so my 5-year old pepper-phobe will eat them. (how did she get those taste buds with her salsa-lovin' parents?!?) And like a few others have said, the veggie burger is way, WAY good. In general, the food is very home-made in quality and presentation.

Sometimes the posters around the bathroom have just a wee too much information for young eyes.)

I grew up eating Chicken Cordon Bleu here but now they only serve the pork version...the last two times I've been I've requested chicken anyway and the chef has made an exception and done it for me (to me the sign of a good chef and a quality restaurant). The red cabbage is amazing as is the spatzel. The mashed potatoes are creamy and delicious.\\n\\nFor birthdays they serenade you with a duet and the accordion. They used to bring you a balloon, take your picture with one of the dressed up servers, and feed you whipped cream off your complimentary Apple Strudel as they give you a love song solo.

They have, in my opinion, achieved what virtually no other pizza parlor has, in all of Florida or the South East for that matter. They've triumphed in doing, what countless places have attempted but never succeeded in, and that is, in creating authentic NYC pizza from absolute scratch with fresh ingredients. They toss their dough by hand, and use old-style ovens, and even bring you your food if you choose to dine-in. They serve and prepare a variety of Italian dishes besides pies, just like a real NYC parlor would, while still being very reasonably priced. \\n\\nThey're lunch special is prime, at $5 for a large, 1-topping slice with a soda, and less than $8 for two very LARGE slices, 1-topping each, and a fountain drink.

I figured for that price, it was not a bad deal. \\n\\nThat was my BIG MISTAKE!! First off, the menu was a tad confusing. It says all you can eat but does not specify how you order, etc. We even asked our waitress, a young woman, and she did not understand and was not really able to articulate on how to order. You get a small slip of paper with several rows of food and 3 columns. Basically, there are items on the left side by name (ie kalbi, rolls, pork, etc) and 3 rows, the first being your first order of meat choices by number of slices. \\n\\nBy the time we figured out how to order and were able to get someone to help us, etc, it was probably like 10-10:15 pm (mind you they close at midnight and if you do the all you can eat option, you can only eat for 2 hours). We had ordered 10 pieces of kalbi (you only get 5 pieces of kalbi per person max), a soup, 2 pieces of the seafood pancake, an order of sushi roll (remember you order by pieces ie 3, etc and not per roll), 3 pieces of chicken and 5 pieces of pork. We were starving and quite disappointed to only see 4 plates of banchan. Really? Maybe it is a US thing but even when I order to go from restaurants in CA, I get at least 8-10 types of banchan. Plus, if you are wanting to recoup more money back from the all you can eat, shouldn't you offer more banchan in hopes that they act as fillers? \\n\\nSo we get the chicken first and the pork. The kalbi finally comes and lo and behold, they bring out TWO pieces! We flagged down the young girl again and told her we ordered 10 pieces and know that we were allowed 15 max. Her reasoning was that it was a lot of meat and we would be charged extra a la carte for any meat we do not finish. UM, I am the customer and I already read that and know what I am ordering. Plus, she kept telling me, the kalbi pieces were big. (Well, according to what I saw, it was no different and no bigger than what I get when I order kalbi anywhere). Then she went on to say that it was a lot of food. How did she know if we could finish it or not??? Anyhoo, we told her we ordered 10 and that was what we expected. We had already been grilling our food and the flame was pretty lame and weak. The food was not grilling quickly and we were famished at this point. Each time we flagged her down to ask about the meat or for a fork (we asked FOUR times!!), the staff member would come and turn down our heat/flame. WTF? It does not take a genius to know you need flame and heat to cook, much less grill. We finally got our fork after flagging down yet the 3rd person. We told him we had asked for a fork 4 times and he went and brought us 4 forks. Problem was, they were not super busy and at many times, their employees were just standing around. \\n\\nTheir only saving grace was that their food was ok. Nothing special and definitely not worth all the drama, wait, and horrid service. I will never come back here again and hope to save other Yelpers the trouble. Take your business next door to No 9 or to another Korean Restaurant. I am not sure how this place stays in business.

There's also the issue of upkeep and repair of the facility -- if you've eaten on the porch/patio, you may already have noticed -- as the tables, chairs, and entire outdoor area are often in need a good washing, if not replacement of old, damaged items.

I think our server had to come back three times while we deliberated and divided and conquered-I could hear the Swede 'bork, bork, borking' the utensils in the back waiting for our order. The smoked trout pytt i panna-the fancy Swedish term for 'hash'-was not only the most colorful breakfast I've ever had, but so flavorful and filling. The friterade √§pplen is the token non-commitment plate, with apple fritters, baked eggs (of course), and some apple pork sausage, and I was so happy that my friend ordered it so I could take some bites. Everything was deleeciuoos, but I also have to give a shout out to the open-faced broder breakfast sandwich, which as you may have guessed, also has eggs on top. \\n\\nBroder is a small place with about ten tables, so I recommend getting there just when they open or planning on a long wait. Even though we got there before they opened, food nerds we are, there were somehow people already there. Miss Piggy's VIP guest list, I presume. Whatever the wait, it is definitely worth it for this underrepresented cuisine. Swedish food is not just lingonberries and meatballs, so I found out.

Our service was a little slow and the waitress did need to read the menu to see what came with our choices but she was new and I'm sure she'll learn the menu.  \\nShe brought us over 3 pieces of bread with marinara sauce(where's the oil???). Actually they were bite size cubes that were so small they were hard to butter.

My chocolate pound cake had a nice taste (the perfect amount of chocolate flavor), but disappointed me by being a bit on the dry side. On the other hand, my fiance's panna cotta was extremely good, with a lovely texture and taste, and a very tangy passion fruit sauce. One big pet peeve: the bread and butter were average. Both were cold and not very impressive, which always turns me off a little at the beginning of the meal. Plenty of restaurants in Boston provide warm, well-baked bread and creamy butter - be like them, Top of the Hub! It makes a much better impression.\\n\\nThe service was very good. Our server was attentive, remembered our orders without writing them down (which always impresses me), and cleared away plates and dishes in a timely manner.

I grew up in the Midwest, moved here from Chicago, and spent years working in the NYC area...I'm not sure who they source their beef from, but they might consider looking for another vendor. At an average cost of $45-$50 a plate this is not Peter Lugar, or even close.\\n\\nA word about the wine list. It is well chosen, thoughtful, and overpriced as is almost every list in Boston. At 4 times their cost they might consider given their customers a break. An interesting aspect if the highend wines by the glass they offer under a separate section.

It consisted of small cubed potatoes, peppers, smoked trout, and was topped with two baked eggs, pickled beets, and a side of walnut toast.

There are a couple of things to consider though when doing this. \\n\\n1) If you end up not liking what comes with the package it is going to increase your costs immensely to get what you want. I found that the people that were coordinating with the elite seemed to try and talk us out of the customization that we did. (To be fair we were looking for a pretty fancy look). \\n\\n2) The yacht is not HUGE like the Spirit of Boston so you are very quickly going to run out of spots for guests. \\n\\n3) The DJ they arranged for us was pretty awesome and really helped keep us on schedule for the night. \\n\\n4) The food is pretty plain, meaning that its not spectacular but its not bad. The hors d'eouvre options they give you are pretty sweet. I would definitely suggests purchasing individual platter as opposed to going with the packages because the options are better. (Note they change the offerings from time to time so that might not be the true anymore)\\n\\n5) The Ceremony spot on the boat is just the upper deck so you may need to do some things to spruce it up. We actually added our own chairs to the mix. \\n\\n6) Look at the chairs in the pictures they have. Not very wedding-y in my opinion.

If your unhappy then get another job! The women bartender took away my drink and then I asked her why she did so? She then replies that I took away all drinks that look empty. I was drinking Tito's on the rocks!!!!! Of course it looks empty but there was plenty of alcohol in that glass. She replies with the worst attitude saying \\" what were you drinking, I will give a little pour\\" I said no thank you ,I'm good.

Fancier than I had imagined.  Still playful with the cadillac planters and actual car on the premises.  Clean lines and white tablecloths and warm wood everywhere.  Lovely.  \\n\\nThe food was great.  My omelet, the Sonora, had some of the best guacamole on top that I've ever had - even my own.  The avocado was real - not that frozen stuff from the big tub - and had a good dose of garlic in it, making it super flavorful.  The omelet underneath the green heaven was my favorite kind - delicate sheets of egg, not overcooked, folded perfectly without a brown edge anywhere, and chock full of perfectly melted cheese and chunks, yes chunks, of good smoky bacon.  I have to mention the tomatoes - they were RIPE.  Chunks of deep red and flavorful tomatoes - now when does this happen?  It did here.  \\n\\nThe drink I ordered, a raspberry orange juice, was three words:  divine, superb and FRESH.  I'd have another one right now if I could.  Probably the best juice blend I've ever tasted, and if you knew me you would know I've spent HOURS trying to develop a \\"new\\" blend in my head that is unique - I needn't bother.  This is it.  I wonder what they can do in summer with peaches?  Oh my!\\n\\nSo omelet great, juice fantastic, coffee just right - hot, often and a good dark roast.  The potatoes?  Meh.  Nothing wrong with them, just those chunky kind that look all seasoned up but when you bite a piece it's so bland you just want to remove it from your mouth - why bother?  So nothing wrong with them, - they were done and hot and pretty - just not my style.  They may be your style.  I would have loved some Hollandaise to dip them in!  But you won't find benedicts here, so sigh, no sauce.  \\n\\nStill, husband got the smoked salmon (Pacific, not Atlantic, but if you get the fillet it is Atlantic) and it was bland but nice.  He loved the bread that came in lieu of toast - a berry sweetbread that had a good crumb and was cake-ish - needed butter so I asked for some.  It's real butter.  YES!  I always give a full point for real butter.\\n\\nSo delicious, such a nice atmosphere, no wait at 8:30 am. on a Sunday, what could be better?  The server - was he in a bad mood?  Is he super duper professional and not prone to idle chatter?  I tried to joke with him a bit by saying \\"My good man, may I have a nob of buttah?\\" in an English accent, but he didn't crack a smile.  Well, it's not his job to amuse me, right?  \\n\\nFive stars minus 1/2 of one for the blah potatoes and 1/2 for the stuffy water.  Otherwise five for sure.  That omelet rocked.

The first time we came on a  Saturday afternoon after strolling through the Portland market there was a long line. I felt confused since it was in the afternoon. Why would there be a long line for doughnuts? We came back the second time on a weekday  & the line was much shorter but the doughnuts still had too much sugar. I thought it was just that batch on Saturday that had too much. The wait was around 15 minutes which I felt was a little long to wait for doughnuts. The staff was very fast.

The service is truly atrocious.  Which is sad, because the food is quite good (slightly greasy upscale-ish bar food).  For example, went there last night with a group of friends.  We started off with a round of drinks and apps.  All good so far.  Then, we put in our entree order.  Everyone's food comes out within 20 mins (four entrees) but my friend's and mine are missing.  The person dropping off the food doesn't enquire about this glaring lack of food.  25 minutes pass by and our server never makes it back to ask the others how their food is (during which I was hoping to ask about the two missing entrees).  Finally, we flag the gentleman down, who arrives and is completely flabbergasted/surprised about the yet-to-arrive food.  Annoying.  When the food finally gets to us, both my friend's and my entree is cold.  Not as ice, but definitely  lukewarm and unpleasant.  I had to flag the server down again for some warmer food.  At this point, however, my friend just gave in out of sheer hunger and decided not to send her entree back.  Our server never apologized or offered an explanation.  Having previously worked as a server for eight years, I hate tipping less than 20%, but I was kind of forced to this time (left 15%).  I realize that the kitchen output times are out of a server's hands, but a simple apology/explanation would've rectified this situation completely and earned Bar 145 more stars.

So tasty!  Next were the entrees.  Again, we were instructed to start with the mixed tandoori and use the naan spread with raita as the base.  Then for the chicken vindaloo, the proper consumption was to pile the rice onto a plate, spoon the vindaloo on top, mix it all together and add raita to taste, and finally use the naan to scoop it up.  Holy carb loading, Batman!\\n\\nThank goodness there was an expert guiding us through this adventure.  The vindaloo was spicy but the raita helped make it not too, too much and the naan was unique and flavorful.  The mixed tandoori grill and rice were good as well.

I kinda fib that the place closes at 9pm (well it was sunday afterall!), so he steps pedal to the medal to get  us there...I was hungry and in need of a drink. but I think going w/ the flow is always a good thing b/c I feel like it was fate that brought us to the Oyster Bar. I had planned an evening of fine dining in the main dining room of the Optimist, but I think we got a much more interesting and fun experience at the Oyster Bar.\\nFirst Ryan (really cute manager at the bar I believe) overheard me explaining the history of the Optimist to my b/f (everything I know I read in the Atlanta magazine:) and came over to introduce himself and shake my hand (made my b/f a little jealous I think..yay!:). So I ask him about Ford Fry (owner) and Adam Evans (exec chef), apparently this is all part of the JCT kitchen and 246 empire in ATL, this being the newest. kudos to these guys for bringing good stuff to ATL! If what we experienced at the Oyster Bar is a premonition of what's to come in the dining room, I'm sooo looking forward to it! \\nWe started w/ the mother of pearl cocktail (saw a pic on yelp and it was just too pretty to not get)..yummy and interesting: salt and pepper rim w/ dill and celery for garnish, and a yuengling for my b/f. the coolest thing is our waiter served it in one of their signature koozies! (but I think the punch is the thing to get at the bar. we were told later the juice is fresh squeezed daily. ) then we ordered their famous lobster roll-better than any I've had! the only thing I didn't like was the chips it came w/. they were cold and greasy. I think they could substitute it w/ pickles or some neat vege instead. then we finished off w/ their savannah style beignets..omg soooo good! the pastry chef made it just sweet enough w/ the chocolate and pecan garnish and powdered sugar. Overall, the environment was fantastic, service was 5-stars! Ryan keep up the good work! and our server was super cool, even though I didn't order a beer he gave me a koozie to take home as well!:) we'll be back for sure! I hope we get a table at the Optimist next time, but if we don't I wouldn't mind the Oyster Bar again either! lesson here for all b/fs out there: don't drag your feet when your g/f wants to go out:)...you'll enjoy the experience!"},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Not much can be said about this place, except that it is a true classic.

The latter of these two points surprised me but did not detract significantly from the overall experience. The brisket also showed up pre-sliced; this was another aspect of the meal I did not expect. While I do not expect to find full pieces of brisket at restaurants, the menu description didn't lead me to think the meat would come pre-sliced.\\n\\nI definitely recommend Bison County!"},{"name":"656 Sports Bar & Grille","address":"656 Pryor St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"I called on a Tuesday and reserved two tables for the following Friday with a lady name Vanessa, who was not only rude but sounded as if I was bothering her with my questions. After I reserved the tables I asked if I needed any type of confirmation and she responded with such lack of professionalism that I considered canceling and taking my business elsewhere but because the invitations had been made I was stuck. The Friday of the event,  I called again early afternoon and poorly raised, mannered lacking Vanessa picked up the phone, I told her I want to confirm that my tables are reserved, I didn't want to any issues when I arrived. Of course she was rude and responded in a condescending tone that I wouldn't have any problems, I must be there on time or my table would be given away. I get there at 8:55pm (my table reservations was at 9pm) and guess what? No tables no reservations no nothing!!!!. After speaking to the hostess and the waitress who were doing everything they could to accommodate me, I finally was seated after an hour. It was embarrassing since my entire party had already arrived and were waiting. It was too late to change venues so we just waited until we were seated. My table spent a lot of money in drinks, bottles that were ordered, hookahs and food. Little do they know that Vanessa's lack of professionalism and ignorant attitude caused this review.

It was supposed to be a 4 course meal and comedy show with Bill Bellamy and an open bar from 10pm-midnight. This was my first time here and I don't know who was responsible for the event but I will not be returning. My ticket for this event was $125... 132.50 with eventbrite.com fees. Event was to begin at 8pm they had us standing outside in the freezing cold for an hour like we were at a club we got in and sat down at 915. Finally we get in, the girls at the front door were incompetent and the hostesses asked for my ticket again after it was just scanned and I was given a wrist band, clearly I needed a ticket to get to them. Next they tried to put us at a table that was behind a huge pillar so we couldn't see the stage. My meal was terrible. Crab cakes were cool, lobster bisque was cold, I asked for my steak to be medium, it came out well beyond well done I'm talking BURNT. Then as I was eating my dessert that was supposed to be BANANA fosters bread pudding (it had strawberrys  and strawberry sauce on it) our waiter who I had not seen since he took my order asked me to either take my dessert to go or move to another part of the restaurant bc we were now taking up their VIP section. So not only did they start the event over an hour late but you're telling me to move while still eating? I proceeded to finish my dessert. We then moved and went to find the coat check that was advertised. We were told by one of the hostesses that just bc you see something written doesn't always mean it is so. My friend let her know when I pay $132 for an event and you advertise something I expect it to be there. On top of all of this Bill Bellamy was on stage 15 mins, being nice I may say 20mins.  I was so disturbed by the execution of this event that I was gone before the New Year and before the open bar. Smh I will never step foot in this restaurant again.

As the waiter poured our wine, he was SO excited about the wine and went on about the viscosity, flavor, color, etc. I'm really unimpressed at this point and find this part to be really awkward when it happens. So, I taste the wine, and just say \\"yup.\\" and he is appalled. Everything about his demeanor changed instantly. In fact, he literally did not check in with us other than bringing our food the entire rest of the evening. We even witnessed him PLATE food for the tables next to us.

It wasn't that it was stale either, worse, it was raw! Undercooked, premature, the Pillsbury dough boy BEFORE the oven!! It tasted like pure flour and was the texture of chewing gum. It also didn't taste fresh at all, like it had been sitting there for three days or something. The brownie wasn't much better, the concept was interesting but in the end there was too much going on and my taste buds were confused. And it also tasted like it had been baked two, three days ago. I was really disappointed. \\n\\nBut, the reason I still gave them two stars is because my wife really enjoyed her cupcake. I took a bite myself and it really was moist and delicious.

They will spin and spin in front of you, sending you a spell that says \\"eat me\\".   It's hard to decide what you want because the display of doughnuts keep on spinning, you think you've made up your mind until you get to the front of the counter and you get a closer look and than you heart is telling you to try it all but your mind is telling you no.  \\n\\nThe last time i was in a Voodoo doughnut I got the Lemon Chiffon crueller and I never forgot about it.

It's so fresh, light, fluffy and zesty. \\n\\nMango tango-  This was fresh as well, but i wish it had more mango frosting on it. \\n\\nPortland cream - This was good and tasted similar to most doughnuts with cream inside, instead the Bavarian cream inside wasn't too sweet which was good. \\n\\nCaptain crunch- this will bring back your childhood memories, if you were a fan of the cereal that is.\\n\\nMemphis Mafia- this was surprisingly good.

Located across from Costco inside of Cumberland Mall, F2O offers allll sorts of salads, paninis, sandwiches, and other entrees that alllll look too good to be true but I myself have always stuck to their soups and salads.  This go round, I got a Southwestern salad with salmon and their raspberry vinaigrette dressing and OMG....what a great way to end my work week.  It comes with tomatoes, cheese, mixed greens, tortilla chips, and golden raisins which for me is a marvelous mix.  While the salad is $8, it's $4.30 to add salmon but so worth it in my opinion.

My second impression is, \\"oh my god, where is the waitress?!\\", this place is seriously understaff, maybe it is a Saturday night, but why would you have only two waitresses running around at a Saturday night. These two girls were running around like they have lost their mind, and it took 10 minute before I could flag down one of the girl. The positive side of thing, she was really nice and sweet.\\nSo, does it get better from now on? The answer is no. After the \\"where is the waitress\\" moment, it was the \\"where the heck is my food?!\\" My friend and I sat there for 50 minute before the food actually come out. I was seriously debating whether to just stand up and walk out 20 minute into the wait, if it was not because of the certificate, i would've be gone. I noticed we were not alone on the waiting, the other table waited for 40 to 50 minute as wells, and the lady at that table looked really unhappy. \\nI would've been fine if the foods are good.

Let me tell you this, there is nothing special about it. My two words description for my dish \\"salty, and small\\". This $10 dishes, and one piece of lonely cod on the plate with way too much salt, and few scope of risotto next to it. Risotto was \\"meh\\", a touch a butter or cheese would've helped the creaminess. Anyway, the total for the guys-out for two came down to $70. I remember my friend and I was looking at each other when the bill came.\\nSo, does it worth $70? Sadly, I say \\"nope\\". I have tried places have better service and foods than this place.

She had not finished out the previous transaction. So...I went to make my coffee and was watching her get my bagel...oh, which she had to ask me which one was an everything bagel...then I saw her put cream cheese on it. Then she realized I said cream cheese on the side...and got a new bagel. She was nice and all, but just kind of odd, and I think the burrito snafu could have been handled better.

Some of their pastries are okay. My go-to is the Napoleon. I'm not a huge coffee drinker and have only ordered a couple drinks.

You know, I have to say that I just don't understand the hype surrounding this place. Maybe it was an off day or something, but my wife and I took a friend visiting from out of town here, and had what could only be described as a bad meal.\\n\\nI'll start by saying that the establishment is lovely, and really conveys a sense of old-fashioned, southern charm. In addition, the service was also good, and our waiter was very attentive. No complaints about either of those two aspects.\\n\\nPerusing the menu, it looked wonderful and they had all of the great southern comfort foods that you could be looking for. After ordering, our meal got off to a great start when we were brought out a collard soup (the broth was made from the water the collards were boiled in. The soup was quite yum, and we were all thinking 'If what they bring out for free tastes this good, imagine the food that we're actually paying for!'. Sadly, none of the rest of our meal came even close to that soup...\\n\\nOur friend ordered the chicken fried steak, which was soggy and mostly unappetizing. It was all right at best, but I've had much, much better. I had chicken and dumplings (my personal favorite southern dish), which was disappointing. It was nice and creamy (good texture), but the flavor was much blander than I'm used to. Neither were terrible, but both were disappointing experiences with these southern staples.\\n\\nThe largest offender of the meal was the fried chicken, which was (by a wide margin) the worst either my wife or myself have ever had in our lives. In all honesty, I think the fried chicken at KFC was much better (and I hate KFC). To start, the fried chicken pieces (drumsticks) were massive -- about the size of large turkey legs. This meant that in order to cook them through, they had to grossly overcook them. They came out dry and tough. On top of that, it was clear that they had been fried well before being served as they were cool when they came out. The breading was almost non-existent, and what was there had very little in the way of seasoning. This dish missed the mark in almost every possible way.\\n\\nOur sides were very hit-or-miss: the fried okra and fried green tomatoes were very good. The sweet potato souffle was also good, albeit a bit sweet. The squash souffle was downright dreadful, and the mac n' cheese was also pretty disappointing. Finally, their cornbread was dry, tough, and cold.\\n\\nSo many people love this place that maybe it was an off day ... I don't know. All I know is that we will never be returning.

I've had 4 of their pizzas now, two of which are pretty spectacular (the margherita and the eggplant pies) and two being more of the distinctly average variety (pepperoni & mushroom and the sausage, ricotta, & red pepper pie). I tend to be somewhat of the mind that the mark of a great pizzeria is a place where you don't HAVE to add the grated parmesan or chili pepper flakes that are on the table. The pepperoni & mushroom and sausage, ricotta, & red pepper pies definitely needed additions to make the rest of the flavors really come alive. The garlic knots are unnecessary and I wouldn't exactly recommend them unless you've been waiting for a table and are starving.\\n\\nOver all, I'd rank Home Slice a 3.5, but their service has been nothing short of great and I have to give them credit where it's due.

Beautiful facility.  Comfy bed.  Wonderful idea.  We stayed in \\"The Crooked Room\\" -- and it felt like a vacation even though we were just there for the night, so we could make an early flight from PDX (we live 2 hrs from PDX).  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Everything worked.  Here are my reservations:  \\n\\n1.) No TV.  I know.  No big deal -- but we were looking forward to a favorite show (it's a ritual -- so shoot me) and it wasn't an option.  TVs are cheap.  It should at least be available. \\n\\n2.) Our room had windows facing 33rd -- which was wildly noisy on a Friday night until about midnight.  This could have been improved just by the addition of better windows.  When a rain storm blew in about 4am -- the windows actually rattled and howled a bit.\\n\\n3.) There's something up with the ventilation.  There are space heaters in the rooms, so warmth isn't an issue - but once the bars/restaurant started to hum, our room became heavy with tobacco smoke.  It was about 2am before the air was clear again.  And it was enough of a problem to set off my asthma. So be forewarned.\\n\\nCOURTYARD RESTAURANT (DINNER) * * * * *  (BREAKFAST) * * *  \\nDinner was above and beyond good.  Started with a Salty Dog -that set the tone.  Husband had a burger with excellent (really) fries.  I ordered one of their salads called a \\"Sweet Potato\\" salad (no actual sweet potatoes were harmed to make this salad)  It was lightly dressed chunks of potato (white potato) on a bed of baby mixed greens, caramelized onions, sweet spiced pecans, and whipped goat cheese.  I got it with chicken and every bite was yummy.  Even if the name was misleading -- the salad was perfect, and made with the best ingredients.\\n\\nMy only complaint about breakfast has to do with an extremely poor sausage gravy that was both greasy and cold.  Which is not a good combination.  Sausages were excellent, hashbrowns were good.  Coffee, and husband's eggs, bacon and toast were all good.  But the gravy needs some work.\\n\\nYou can get food and drinks to take back to your room if you're staying -- which is good since there's no soda machine or ice machine in this too-cool-for-school building.  You can buy a cup of soda at the bar/restaurant and get a refill if you keep your receipt.  \\n\\nCINEMA * * * *\\nA really cute theater -- and the ticket price was included with the room -- but they were only playing movies we'd already seen.  So, with no TV and no current movies, it was a little disappointing.  \\n\\nOverall, this is a nice place and a welcome change from corporate closet hotels, and too frilly B&Bs.  The artwork in the halls of this refurbished elementary school was well chosen, and wonderfully whimsical.  Because the place is so family friendly, there were children, grandparents -- and on a Friday night, lots of tables of friends in the restaurant and bars.

Although it was a little salty for my taste, it still tasted very good! It is a thicker broth compare to the shoyu ramen. \\n\\nShoyu ramen ($11) was lighter in broth, but also doesn't come with the sliced pork (which is the best part). I added crunchy garlic and my boyfriend added garlic oil for a kick. Additional $1 for each. The 5-minute egg is amazing. \\n\\nWe also ordered the cucumbers, but seems to lack consistency, because last time I got this, it tasted balance with sesame oil, but this time it tasted like all soy sauce.

It is a very tiny spot so we had to sit at different tables across the restaurant but it worked out just fine. The waitress was super friendly and made everyone feel at home. She even was patient with me having my baby and a special needs aunt to order for. This is not always the case with restaurant staff as they can get foot tapping when I am trying to help with orders. I really appreciated it. My mom was able to maneuver from one table to the other to grab the baby and sit with her and they had highchairs which is a plus in a tiny place. The food came out in shifts and was all very fresh albeit a bit slow. I ordered oatmeal with apples and it was a big thick bowl of oatmeal that filled me up and tasted perfect with brown sugar. I think I made a mistake though when I said no milk because the apples seemed to be cooked in butter which for some reason I didn't think of and should've said I was vegan and allergic to milk not just that I didn't want milk in the oatmeal. So that was my fault. I had a stomach ache later in the day but it passed and I moved on with my mistake lesson learned. So for any other vegans just an FYI and check on the cooked apples if you go. I will if I go back. Otherwise everything was on point and my husband ate enough to feed three people and my daughter chowed on fresh fruit and sliced avocado like a champ.

I would argue that the specialty rolls rival the quality and taste of rolls at much more expensive places around Columbus like Haiku and Shoku.\\n\\nIt was so good on Thursday, that we returned on Sunday.

I've never had service like this before!  Let's start from the beginning. Everything is going good, we get seated, the server is friendly. We place our orders grab our food of the belt. Now I'm not sure the customary practice in Japan but I guess this place expects you to eat with your hands or with your face directly in the plate like a dog because we waited about 15 minutes before we were given our chopsticks. But I guess I'll cut them some slack considering we had a really complicated drink order, four waters. Eventually we get our waters, chopsticks, and the rolls we ordered. Except that half of those rolls we received were incorrect, but like good sports, we mentioned that it wasn't what we ordered and accepted them anyway. One member of our party wanted to order a small beer, the lovely aforementioned manager decides to come up and tell us he didn't have that particular beer in a small just large.  When we said we didn't want the beer if it wasn't available he became very pushy and tried to have us order beers and sizes we didn't want. Someone give this guy a raise. He's clearly multitalented as a manager AND a used car salesman. As we try and enjoy our meal as that very same manager decides to show us another skill set! He decides that it's appropriate for him to mime an assault on one of the members of our party behind her back. When I promptly tell him what he's doing is incredibly rude and inappropriate and ask why he would do that, he let me know something I've never known about myself, that I'm \\"no fun\\".  My bad, I never really understood the humor of pretending to assault a female customer. Guess I need to sign up for for local improv classes.  I then ask for the check to which he says we pay up front.  What he didn't mention when we asked for the check is that he was charging us extra for a bowl of unfinished ramen. Instead he showed yet ANOTHER amazing skill set, the skill of delegation. He had the sweet female server come and break us the news.  It seems that since we were lenient with their mistakes a quid pro quo would be appropriate, and waive the charge for the uneaten ramen. Anyway, I don't know what this renaissance man is doing managing a sushi restaurant when he has so much to offer the world! \\n\\nTL;DR. Manager here is a jerk.

But if you don't mind waiting a bit (and it really is only a bit, since they have three cashiers at a time cycling through the line), then the pay off is rewarding. Once inside, you see an expansive menu of donuts, from something as simple as a \\"maple bar\\" to more \\"out there\\" varieties like the \\"gay bar\\" and \\"giant peach,\\" both of which we sampled, as well as the \\"voodoo doll\\" that they are famous for--a chocolate glazed, ghost-shaped donut with a jelly center that is being stabbed by a pretzel stake. Awesome. Every donut listed shares space on rotating pedestals where they are showcased to the line, and from there you can see how different and complex some varieties are. Because the menu is so developed, these really help to narrow the options down. It also led me to choose the \\"Homer Simpson,\\" a simple strawberry-frosted with sprinkles, a nostalgic novelty with great icing that tasted like Dunkin Donuts if they were still independently owned.\\n\\nWe only waited about 15 minutes or so and ordered smoothly, getting a really cute pink box with their logo and five delicious donuts inside. They all tasted fresh, taken from the array of racks in the back of the store, where employees were working on them behind the scenes.

I decided to go the full-service route (on a barstool since I was alone on business), and am glad I did. One review suggested the regular chicken sandwich was bigger & better than other Chick-Fil-A restaurants, but I disagree. It tasted exactly the same as the ones in Texas, and I actually think the chicken was smaller here. So don't order the standard chicken sandwich if you go there -- get one of the unique items. I wasn't able to find a menu of the unique items online (and the lady on the phone didn't seem interested in giving me a comprehensive list over the phone), so maybe this list will help some of you that are wondering just HOW different the full-service menu is:\\n\\nLunch/Dinner menu (in addition to normal stuff):\\nOne-piece plate, two-piece plate, chargrilled one-piece plate, chargrilled two-piece plate, steak plate, Hot Brown (other reviews describe this), hamburger plate, midnight sandwich (ham & cheese), ham/bacon lettuce tomato sandwich, giant burger, steak sandwich, dwarf burger, grilled cheese sandwich, kids meal.\\n\\nVegetables:\\nfried okra, fried peas, collard greens, mashed potatoes, sweet potato souffle, cornbread, mac & cheese, kernel corn, green beans, broccoli & cheese. Also note they serve \\"straight\\" fries if you ask for them instead of the traditional waffle fries (I only saw waffle fries on their menu sign but was able to order straight fries).\\n\\nBreakfast (served all day):\\nEggs & toast & grits (bacon, ham, or sausage optional), steak & eggs, Chick-Fil-A chicken & eggs, chicken egg & cheese bagel, waffle, cinnamon cluster, etc.\\n\\nAnd they have individual slices of pies - some fried and some regular. I had the lemon and it was great (tart but that's how I like it).\\n\\nI tried the regular chicken sandwich (same as everywhere), dwarf burger (small but perfect when sampling other things too), straight fries (pretty standard fries - medium size sticks -- fatter than other fast food fries), and a small slice of lemon pie (the most enjoyable thing I ordered, which is how it's supposed to work). \\n\\nI'd love to go back someday and try some of the other unusual items on the menu -- including breakfast!  The nice server at the bar gave me 3 little stuffed cow toys as souvenirs for my 3 young kids back home -- but only when I asked (like other reviews have said).

It's was fairly crowded considering the off hour for a meal, which is usually a good sign.\\n\\nWe were greeted by a friendly server upon walking in the door.  We decided to sit inside and I got a great view of the guys preparing the pizza.  They looked like they were having some fun!  \\n\\nOur waitress suggested two nice reds to go with our pizzas- the Diavola and the Maiale.  I strongly recommend both- they were true Napoli style pies, just like I remember from my trip to Naples a couple of years ago.  They dough was fresh, evenly cooked, and had a nice portion of protein.  \\n\\nThe decor/ambiance was upscale for a pizzeria and very clean.  We didn't stay for dessert, but the table next to us did and they had something completed stuffed with nutella- whatever it was smelled and looked delicious.  To be honest, I completely forgot about dessert because I was lost in my pie, it was delicious.\\n\\nMy two complaints- we weren't told that it was happy hour, but we noticed that the tables seated to both sides of us were told shortly after we sat down.  Just seemed a bit lame not to be informed of a happy hour special when clearly all of the other tables were.  We had already ordered and I'm not sure that it would have changed my order, but I would have at least appreciated the heads up.  My second, and bigger, complaint is that we were charged the regular price for the Diavola pizza even though it was during the Aperitivo time.  The pizza was worth the full price, so I'm not taking a star away on my review, but lame of the waitstaff to have charged us full price.  I worked in restaurants for 10 years in New Orleans and I would have never done that.

Wasn't planning to go back, but only went here (for the last time), because the genuine Mexican place at the other end of this strip mall had a flood due to a frozen pipe and were closed for the day.  The same unfriendly, 20-something female bartender who always seems to be there was too busy to pay attention to me, so I had to flag down the new, even less friendly 20-something male bartender with a beard to get a beer and order food. He served me without saying a word to me, and never asked how my food was, or offered to get me another drink when my glass was empty.  I had to initiate each contact, as is usual at this place.  Even worse, I had to sit there and watch the female laughing and joking with her five friends at the end of the bar, at the expense of me and every other customer in the place who were being ignored.  And it gets worse....I sat there and watched the male bartender drinking on the job.  Really?!   My mediocre food was over-salted and almost cold by the time I got it.  I took two bites, finished my beer, paid them and left for the last time.  There are 2 years worth of negative comments about service at this location on Yelp and other sites, which the owners perpetuate via their lack of action in correcting the problems.  This place has the potential to be a gold mine, but the owner's obvious lack of attention to quality will surely result in them going out of business before too long."},{"name":"Full Moon","address":"344 Huron Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"We went for dinner at 5 PM on a Sunday of a long weekend.  It was great to be seated right next to the play area since our friends have a two year old.  But the place quickly filled with other families with young children, and it got louder and louder.  \\nOur food was just OK.  We had the spring rolls, which were deep fried, served with a sweet and sour sauce.  They tasted like basic fried sprinng rolls. The pear, blue cheese, and walnut salad was good, unfortunately the pear was tough.  The mussels with sausage, fries, and spicy aioli was on the verge of bad.  The spicy aioli was too spicy for me, and the mussels had a strong flavor of fish - I didn't like it and found myself eating the fries (they come on top, so you sort of have to dig around them to get the mussels) and sausage pieces.  My wife and I split the spring rolls, salad, and mussels and our bill came to $60.

I returned after much anticipation, with two friends who never dined here before. You know how it is when you bring someone to a place you haven't shut up about in a couple months... they were supposed to have been blown away. \\n\\nWell, the bread and basalmic/chili oil was delic. The purple rain cocktail was amazing (I squeezed my lime this time and it made all the difference), the appetizers were yummy, and the dessert was fabulous. The only thing is, our entrees--all of them--were mediocre. \\n\\nLet me start from the beginning: the tuna tartar, which I had been craving since my last visit, was just as awesome. Unfortunately, I had to share it with three other people so only got a single piece. The salmon chips were decent, but I would not order them again. My friends seemed to enjoy those more than I did. We also got a cheese plate, which was interesting but only one cheese and the pineapple jelly were worth the expense.\\n\\nThe entrees were underwhelming at best. My mahi mahi was underseasoned but the rice upon which it sat was overly salty and tasted akin to boxed spanish rice, only with a little bit of lobster stock drizzled on top. The swiss chard in the rice was good but not stellar. The only great thing on my plate was the two pieces of shrimp... too bad only two pieces. \\n\\nTwo of my friends ordered a steak, which I thought was tough and blah. The other girl got duck. It was def the best entree, although I thought a little overcooked (to Two's credit, she ordered it medium well... don't ask me why!). The flavor was great in the duck as were the sweet potatoes it came with. \\n\\nThe dessert was really tasty--nutella and chocolate bread pudding with white russian ice cream. Delic!!! We also got a peach cobbler and the pistachio ice cream sandwiches. The bread pudding was the winner, although the ice cream sandwiches were tasty as well. Their homemade ice creams were quite excellent.\\n\\nAll in all, I was disappointed with the entrees. If I return, which is doubtful anytime soon, I will likely just get drinks, apps, and dessert and skip the entrees.

Went a few weeks ago with a group of five who were prepared to spend about $30 per person. We sat down at 8:20pm and ordered drinks which came about 10 mins later with cornbread (not too bad). We ordered our food from the limited over priced menu (entrees are between $15 to $30). Then the wait began. We waited and waited some more. No food and no waiter. Granted the night was a little busy due to one of the employees there hosting his own bday party with about 20 people and then a group of people doing a fundraiser in the back. But you would think any smart restaurant would prepare for adequate staffing for special events. So anyway about 40 minutes later, we call over some guy in a suit who looks like he could be a manager and tell him we've been waiting for an hour for food. He starts to give all these excuses and says they're working on getting it out. We ask for free drinks and he obliges. Waiter also brought some more complimentary cornbread. About another 30 minutes pass, the \\"manager\\" hasn't even checked on us to see if we are OK. Our food comes out now and it's completely cold like it's been sitting in the kitchen counter the whole night. We complain to waiter and this lady from the kitchen comes to our table saying it was reheated before they brought it to us so we shouldn't have a problem. Um excuse me lady -food shouldn't have to be reheated. We told her to take the food back. After our whole two hour debacle, we finally left still hungry as hell and ended up going to Applebee's.

However, it is outside of Chinatown and a little easier to find parking around here than in C-Town.  I'd definitely recommend it as a choice worth considering.  Read on for the details...\\n\\nSo my friend and I got a hankering for some sit-down family style Chinese food last night.  After Circling C-Town a couple of times, we decided that it would be futile to try to look any more for a spot in C-Town around 6pm-ish.  I was a bit hesitant to have a family-style Chinese meal outside of C-Town.  They usually don't end well with a few shining exceptions.\\n\\nIn any case, they have fresh seafood here.  And by fresh I mean they have small tanks right out in the open and you can actually see your meal still moving around.  That's always a good thing to me.  In any case, on to the nitty gritty.\\n\\nSeafood soup with Tofu - This was a bit on the bland side to be honest.  This is supposed to be a bit more on the refreshing, light tasting side, but it went a little too far over that line.  There was plenty of seafood in it, though.\\n\\nBeef with pea pod stems and carrots - The meat was tender and the veggies fairly fresh.  It was right on par with some of the other Chinese places I've been to in C-Town.\\n\\nFried clams (in shell) with black bean sauce - Another seafood staple that I like to order.  This was again on par with other places, though you won't want to eat this dish when it gets cold.  Finish it quickly or don't order it.\\n\\nSteamed Tilapia - Yes, a whole fish, steamed.  Its not for everyone, but those of you out there who like fish should try this sometime.  The traditional Chinese way of steaming fish dictates that you steam the fish till fully cooked, then add garnish, usually scallion but they used parsley here, then you heat some oil in a pan and pour it over the fish and garnish.  This gives the skin a nice crisping.  Add a little Soy sauce to finish.  This is what I got here and it was awesome.

We ordered four other appetizers for our 8-person group, but the rest were okay (crudo, veggies).  As with most tapas-like places, the portions are small, but these were especially so, this time.   The service was really a disappointment, as well.  Our server was friendly, but we were too rushed to order our appetizers, and drinks took took long to arrive.  The server also spilled a glass of cold water down the back of one of our guests.  The big issue came at the end.  It took some time to get our bill, and once we tossed in our four credit cards to split, took a bit of time to have her take the bill.  That's when the real delays occurred.  After 15 minutes, we could not see our server.  I got up to locate her, and asked another server where she was.  I was directed to the other side of the room, where this server said that our server and manager were working through an issue with the transaction.  I gave it another 5 minutes, and then had to go over to the station and ask what was taking so long.  I was told, factually but not apologetically, by the manager that there was an issue with the transaction and it would be done in a couple of minutes.  The check eventually arrived, with an automatic gratuity added.  Nothing special for the inconvenience.  Nothing special for our friend who had to wear a wet, cold shirt through what became a three-hour dinner.  Glitches can happen, but no word from anyone for over 20 minutes?  Wow.

I always find that having a sports channel on tv (a distinctly North America thing for a restaurant to do) doesn't help either. I might go back again as it's a nice spot and a purely vegetarian restaurant always removes any fear from ordering something with meat in it by accident. Maybe I will try again, just my wife and I this time and see if it does better.

The slices are thin and relatively big.  You can find slices bigger at the Onion, but still a good size.  The cheese and sauce are the best part of the pizza, though overall the slices are somewhat bland.  So far I would say that this place is the closest thing to \\"New York\\" pizza in Austin, but it is still a long way from actual \\"New York\\" pizza.  \\n\\nThere are a few downsides to Home Slice that I list below:\\n\\n1) During certain hours of the day they do not sell individual slices.  I don't care if you are going to serve individual slices or the whole pie only, but I would like a place to be consistent.  If I want just a slice for dinner and you normally have that option than you should HAVE that option at all hours.  \\n\\n2) The pizza is somewhat bland.  It is better than other places I have reviewed thus far, but I would not go out of my way to have it either.\\n\\nOverall review.

I've been a loyal customer for about a year now, and I can honestly say this is my go-to diner spot. I get off work at 11pm, so I usually stop at J&B's when there's pretty much no one there. Maybe it's because I'm a regular, but the staff always makes sure I feel at home when I walk in. I always sit at the bar when I order, and the cooks always ask me how my day is going and how I particularly want everything cooked. The food isn't AMAZING, as if it's the best thing you've ever tasted, but it's good food. I can't complain. I see other reviews bring up pick up orders being a little wonky. Again, I come in at almost midnight, so I have yet to experience any problem with my pick up orders. I think it should be taken into consideration that this place is in the heart of Downtown Columbus, so orders may sometimes be messy simply because of the heavy traffic flow coming in and out. As in all my reviews, I always bring up customer service and attitudes, and I've never had an incident where I've ever felt uncomfortable or unwanted. I also love the fact that they have Apple Pay and use a tablet to pay for the meal. It's very convenient and a nice touch to the experience.

I will start with the positive. The salmon chips were AWESOME! My husband thought it tasted too fishy but I had to disagree with him whole-heartedly on that. A friend that was with us had the NY Strip and said it was great. On my first visit there I had the lamb lollipops which were phenomenal but on this visit I was told they had been discontinued...:( \\n\\nNow we will delve into the negative. Our waiter was not very friendly at all My husband is a jokester and this waiter didn't even crack a smile. Granted my husband is kinda corny (in a good way) but he is the diner so the waiter could have indulged him a little. Secondly, he went over the menu like he was running late for a hot date and we were his last table. I was not feeling him at all. My appetizers were good but I ordered the BBQ chicken for my meal and the chicken which was dry and the mac and cheese that came with it needed a straw. It was way too crowded in there and I just felt rushed the whole time. I must say I have given this place two chances and shame on me. Needless to say I will not be returning unless someone else is treating and even then I will only get appetizers.\\n\\n*Side note: On both of my visits there I had an awful server."},{"name":"The Paramount","address":"44 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The food is sooo good, I don't mind standing in line.

Waited over 45 minutes for a burger, burrito and huevos rancheros and some juice to go. Each juice was $5 and came in a tiny kids cup. They were out of the first two drinks I tried to order. By the time we got our food and went to eat it, it was cold and the tortillas were completely soggy. Waited a good 5-10 minutes at the entrance just to get someone's attention to order. The restaurant itself is nice but it's overpriced for the quality of the food and service. Didn't seem like the wait staff cared that our food was sitting back there forever and didn't apologize for the ridiculous wait time or lack of attentiveness and cold food.

I highly recommend the 5 elements ceviche and their cocktail with passionfruit puree and habanero-infused vodka. It's sweet and spicey! I also love their salad with hearts of palm and the tapas dish with avocado, crab, and shrimp. I personally don't think their entrees are worth the price, so stick to getting lots of tapas of varying sizes. Every time I've had an entree I was overly full and not as impressed with the flavors. \\n\\nOh and this place is excellent for special occasions! If you say it's a birthday, anniversary, etc when making the reservation, they will bring out a special dessert with a hand-written message, which is always a nice touch.

Fortunately, we were early so neither had sold out. The bigfoot was the most incredible hot dog I've ever eaten.

Given Austin's eclectic, health-conscious culture, there are no shortage of restaurants here that cater to the vegan crowd.  Despite that, Bouldin Creek sets itself apart with a strong menu and a \\"laid back without trying too hard\\" vibe.\\n\\nThe combination of chic and vintage decor gives Bouldin Creek an immediately homey feel, which was apparent for me after my first sip of coffee out of an authentic, throwback high school prom coffee mug (they've got a great collection of mugs!).  The food is what really keeps me coming back.  Whether you're a vegetarian or a meat-eater like me, you're guaranteed to find a great meal.  My favorite is the the \\"Oven Cake Breakfast,\\" featuring blueberry cornbread with agave nectar.  Regardless of what you order, make sure to grab yourself a side of their tofu scrambler, a healthy, salty, protein-filled dish that will blow your standard side of eggs out of the water!  \\n\\nService and attentiveness can be a bit inconsistent depending on when you visit, but requests are usually met in a timely fashion.  Just try to beat the brunch rush, and your day in Austin will be off to a great start with Bouldin Creek.

I called ahead and asked if they take reservations and they said no, so my boyfriend and I just decided to head over anyway. There was no line outside when we got there and when we walked in I immediately saw an open table on the floor so assumed it wouldn't be too long but the host told us it would be over an hour. We went to go get a drink on the back patio and wait and noticed there were three other empty tables. I went to the host stand and mentioned that there were a lot of available tables and no line so I didn't understand why the wait would be over an hour. The guy rudely responded \\"yeah, you can go next door and order a slice.\\" Then another young couple walks in and he tells them the same thing. Right after a party of four come in and he seats them immediately at a table. Since my boyfriend and I had already driven downtown, we just odered a slice and sat on the padio (area where anyone is welcome to sit but you get no service/waiter) the whole time we were there the three tables on the lower padio, that we were told we couldn't sit at, we're never even used. The pizza is good but nothing special and the garlic knots are good too (we weren't able to order them, because you have to be seated at a table, but i have tried them in the past and they're good) just not good enough to put up with that again.\\n\\nIt's seems like the host was just picking and choosing who to seat based on party size and looks...I haven't been back since and really don't plan to. There are so many better places to eat in Austin (you would probably get better service and food at a food trailer, honestly) but if you are just dying to try it, I suggest just going to the window and buying it by the slice so you can avoid the insane wait time and rude staff."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Please put the salmon chips here on your bucket list!

This past evening, I got my friends ready, requested an Uber, on its way, about to pick us up, and decided to give the restaurant a call because we wanted to make sure we would not go there for nothing.\\n\\nWe could predict somehow the restaurant would be packed. However, we just wanted to confirm how long we had to wait first before we actually came there. Traffic was bad. My friends had to be back early because they had things to work on. Thus, we could not afford 2-3 hour wait. \\n\\nYOU WILL NEVER KNOW HOW QUICK THINGS CAN CHANGE IN 5 MINUTES UNTIL YOU EXPERIENCE WHAT I DID. The people on the phone were rude. I asked them about 5 times if the restaurant was packed, just to be sure that if they said yes, i would ask them how packed it was. They kept on saying they couldn't hear me, while I was screaming and rephrasing \\"Is It Packed?\\" in different ways because I thought they couldn't understand me. Then, the girl over the phone passed it to another guy, who laughed at my question (I guess it was stupid for him, and for some of you who actually like it there), and asked me sarcastically: \\"It's a Friday night. What do you think *hahaha*?\\" After that, he suddenly hung up.\\n\\nSo I decided not to go anymore. Maybe not on a Friday night. Maybe on a weekday. Or, maybe not at all, because the restaurant is always PACKED, that I sound so stupid and redundant asking such an obvious question, which I could find the answer on Yelp, instead of calling the restaurant and being turned into a fool."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Tapas are a tricky species.

Please, let me love you.\\n\\nI headed over today for breakfast with my trusty New York Times and took a seat. Love the location, nestled right across from the historic Victory Grill on the east side. I adores me some east side. The atmosphere is very cozy, cute little patio and a charming inside space with (local?) art hanging round and a big wall wine rack. It's cute, you'll see.\\n\\nHaving worked in restaurants myself for many years, I hesitate to comment negatively about members of staff, especially on Yelp, unless they are downright rude. I recognize that people have bad days, and personal problems, and sometimes just can't fake a smile. Everyone is entitled to a day or two like that every once in a while, even in the service industry. But.....oh, hostess. I honestly can't remember the last time I felt that instantly unwelcome walking into a restaurant. She had a vacant, sulky expression on her face when I opened the door. In lieu of a greeting, she flicked her eyes up at me without changing her expression, grabbed a menu, and used it to point at a table. I sat down and she wandered away without saying a word. I was so taken aback by her negativity that I made it a point to continue glancing in her direction throughout my meal, and I never saw a smile on her face. I hope you're okay, hostess. Fake it till you make it.\\n\\nOn to the rest. Breakfast here is very affordable; I think the most expensive thing is the frittata ($5.95), which I did not have but many folks around me did. It looked beautiful. I got coffee (DELICIOUS, in a huge, pleasing mug), the blueberry blintzes, and the soft-boiled eggs, and got out for just over $11 before tip.\\n\\nI was excited for the blintzes, but they weren't the greatest. Not bad, but not excellent, either. The blini itself was a bit chewy, and the dish wasn't hot enough. The dish has potential; the blueberries were fresh and the sauce was flavorful. I'll get the waffle next time.\\n\\nThe soft-boiled eggs were excellent. I would return for this dish. I'm a huge egg lover, and the two eggs were perfectly cooked. They were served with two pieces of rustic bread that was very, very good. A forgettable little salad came with, which was fine. Take my advice and ask for their jams (raspberry, orange marmalade, Nutella) for the bread.\\n\\nWaiter was a nice guy who mostly made up for the hostess.

If you have a dog, the garden out back is an appropriate place to have it join you for lunch. Nice place to go with friends for a casual, off-beat hangabout. If you want haute cuisine, that's somewhere else.\\n\\nHave now been here three times. All of the above remains the same. Bread is good. The rest is trendy and average. I won't be back.

Well, these looked like what the shells are supposed to have on them AFTER you have eated them.  There were only slivers of oyster leftovers on the shells.When I told the waiter that we didn't want them, he gave us a nasty look, as if we were low class citizens and didn't know what oysters were \\"supposed\\" to look like. To me, it was an insult that they expected us to pay over $10 for some crappy oysters.  If I'm going to spend $10 on oysters, they damn better look like oysters and not something you throw away after someone ate them!\\nFor entrees, I ordered the fish and chips basket with fries and my boyfriend ordered the grilled fish (tilipia). The fish on my basket tasted ok and had a huge serving of dripping grease on it. The fries were over cooked and soggy. My boyfriends \\"entree\\" seafood dish only came with the fish and NO SIDES.  If you want sides, you have to order them, including garnishes!\\nWe heard some commments by other patrons as well. The table next to us (3 elder couples) ordered Bloddy Marys.  They all sent them back because one gentleman said that they were too spicy. And at the end of their meal, one of them told the waiter to tell the cook that he should work on the fries, because they were over cooked and soggy.  I was glad that I wasn't the only one who thought the same thing.  Another table ordered lunch baskets (like me), and the guy also asked the waiter to bring take the food back because he was not happy about it.\\nI'm not trying to bash Coast.  All I'm saying is that if they're going to promote their establishment on t.v., they should live it to it.\\nOverall, $65 dollars (including tips) later, we left there feeling like we didn't get what we paid for."},{"name":"Equinox Restaurant and Bar","address":"830 N Shaver St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I have yet to experience a bad meal at Equinox.

THE PUFFY TACOS DO NOT DESERVE TO BE CALLED PUFFY TACOS - THEY ARE NOT WHAT YOU THINK OF WHEN YOU THINK PUFFY TACO.  really.  are the caps necessary...well, if you don't want to feel tricked or fooled, then yes they are necessary.   traditionally, as i know it and for my entire life, puffy tacos have always been a fried and puffed up corn tortilla.  if this is what you want in a puffy taco, please go elsewhere.  don dario's puffy tacos are not what one would normally think of.  they fry a flour tortilla, fold it in half like a crispy taco and fill it. there's no corn/ masa flavor in sight and there's no light fried crispyness to it at all.  the flour tortillas were overcooked so much that they were almost burned.  they were dripping with oil and looked inedible.  even worse, the beef didn't really have any flavor/seasoning...so what may have been redeemed by a nice yummy filling completely failed us that night.   as our waiter removed our dishes, i could see his lack of surprise and a slight head shake when the puffy taco plate went back less than half eaten.  perhaps he should have recommended something else if he knew......\\n\\noverall, we didn't hate it but we didn't think it was fantastic either.  i'm sure they have other redeeming entrees on the menu, and like i said, my dish was good.  we may go back and try some other items, or if nothing else, they've got cold beer and margaritas!   check it out sometime, it's worth a shot, but don't expect it to taste like Serrano's or Baby A's."},{"name":"Woodys Wing House","address":"161 E Campus View Blvd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"My new favorite wing spot in town!

I felt like the dirty bastard, a yeast doughnut with oreo crumbs, chocolate icing and peanut butter, was way too heavy and even with my ridiculous sweet tooth, it was impossible to finish. The jelly breaks up the heaviness of the toppings nicely and was probably the highlight of my Voodoo experience.\\n\\n3. If you don't want to buy 4 doughnuts, you can pay an extra $1 for the signature awesome pink box! \\n\\nAll in all definitely worth trying."},{"name":"Little Big Burger","address":"3747 N Mississippi Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Fantastic burger, simply DIVINE fries, and that's all you need to know!\\n\\nPROs:\\n+SUPER delicious burger\\n+Best fries hands down.

Of course other fast food chain burgers are ok, if you just want a burger to eat and not to enjoy, but there's a good reason why In N Out is so famous: they're really delicious, cooked exactly when and how you want them, and while most Southern Californians who still live there take them for granted, they are a burger that is made to be enjoyed.\\n\\nAfter my history there, I moved up to Seattle and I learned of \\"Dick's,\\" another really great local burger joint, that was great for both budget AND taste. Different than In N Out, but on the same field as them, with great fries and fresh burgers.\\n\\nI've also toured Japan and had Freshness Burger, another top class, locally-owned franchise-type burger place, with very good burgers (a difficulty to find in Japan), and alright fries.\\n\\nNow, with those three other places on the table, I really have to say Little Big Burger (LBB) is worthy to be compared alongside them. In fact, I would say, the beef patty in burger I had there was the closest thing in terms of quality and taste I've tasted to an In N Out burger patty... very delicious, and rather unique being so thick, but small, and nicely cooked. The cheeses are different, but that's because LBB uses local ingredients, like the bun, cheese, and even beef!\\n\\nThis is to say nothing of the fries, fries that are not to be forgotten! They are worth the trip to LBB all by themselves. And, if you're a beer fan, there are 40 varieties of beers to enjoy.\\n\\nOf course, there is also a veggie burger on the menu (my wife raves about that as well!), and oddly, that's about the extent of the menu. But they do do it very well, so why would you need more?!\\n\\nDefinitely check this place out if you're looking for a great burger, great fries, or a fun variety of beers for a burger place!

Figuring she would be in need of a good cocktail and tasty food, I chose Coast Seafood as our destination.  I took a gander at the menu online, and the selection of items on the menu looked quite good. and not too heavy (it is bathing suit season, after all.)  The seafood tower caught my eye immediately!  I knew I had to try this.  My impression of the decor of the restaurant is: nice-simple, clean, and casual.  We would have gone to the patio if it wasn't raining as it looked quite inviting.\\nWe all agreed to start with the seafood tower...well, it is not exactly a tower.  Rather, it is a platter of mussels, oysters on the half shell, crab meat, peel n' eat shrimp and half of a half of a lobster tail on ice.  The items were very tasty, but the name is very deceiving.  I suppose they thought a platter on top of a pizza pan holder makes it a tower?  In any case, we enjoyed it.  Unless you order one of the specialties that comes with a side, the menu is a la carte.  I had the grilled tuna with a butter sauce (Mmmm....butter), my husband had the hot chili medley of seafood (iFYI-it's fried seafood with hot chili sauce),  and my friend had the seafood linguine.  The hot chili seafood was delicious, but it would be better as an appetizer, not an entree.  It was almost like ordering fried calamari for dinner.  The entrees were good, but hardly memorable.  The best things were the Skinny margaritas and the shrimp&bacon mac&cheese.  I plan to go back and try out their patio when it's not raining.

The pasta was great with the perfect amount of sauce.  The drink was small, but you could upgrade to a larger cup.

That being said, Fireside fits into the demographic of 23rd. I think the restaurant ambience appeals to people in their twenties/thirties or hipsters for lack of a better term. The decor was very open. From street view, it seems like a small restaurant, but when you walk inside you can notice how roomy it feels with the tall ceilings. I think an important aspect to dining on 23rd is outdoor seating. Fireside seems to have this down pat. In addition, eating inside feels like your outside at the same time. With the open environment, warm and breezy weather, sitting next to the fireplace really makes the dining experience comfortable. \\n\\nAlright enough about the setting. Lets talk food. My girlfriend and I were looking for something refreshing to eat to compensate the hot weather. I ordered the braised lamb sandwich and my girlfriend ordered the steak salad. The braised lamb sandwich came with a simple side salad with sliced daikon. Don't get me wrong the sandwich was full of rich flavors from the mustard bbq sauce. However, for thirteen dollars the portion size seemed a bit small. I was not full after finishing my plate as well as a few bites of the steak salad.\\n\\nThe steak salad also had a lot going on flavor wise. However, the flavor was not cutting it for me personally. I am not a fan of earthy or bitter vegetables which is what I strongly tasted from the Belgian endive. It was also too crisp for my liking. If you are a fan of radicchio salads then you will like the endive. I do love the PEARing of fruits and veggies which I was hoping to get from the d'anjou pear but there was only one slice of pear. The bleu cheese was too clumped together and mushy which made it hard to spread evenly throughout the salad. The salad was a very small portion as well and was not worth 12 dollars in my opinion. I would much rather get a steak salad at home. The steak definitely made the salad as it should. As soon as I tasted the steak I thought, \\"Fireside\\". It tasted as if it was wood fired and the seasoning made for a flavorful bite. Overall, the dining experience was still enjoyable, but the food portion wasn't enough to have me completely satisfied."},{"name":"Marathon Taverna","address":"1735 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"They had a $2 breakfast of eggs, bacon, and toast.

We started with Papadums served with a nice cilantro dipping sauce and one I'd say with tamarind.  Yum.  Our appetizer was Aloo Tikki, a rich potato pancake with perhaps a little too much dairy (for my taste at least) but OK.  Then our main courses, Vegetable Korma (medium heat) and Dal Makhani (mild).  No kidney beans seen in what was served but no deductions for it, everything was tasty, tastefully presented and the server was spot on with attending to everything.

It's a very open dining experience, but the soft lighting is very romantic and it's quite quiet and intimate for being an open floor plan.  The waiter was fantastic (Gabriel) and was helpful, insightful, and just a real pleasure to be around.  And as we all know, the wait staff in Portland is usually par at best.  Not so here and with Gabriel!\\n\\nThe food was simply delicious.  My date and I split an appetizer of a trio of bruschetta that was a combo of smoked salmon, kale, and dijon; a bacon chutney with sirachi sauce; and a chorizo mixture.  The smoked salmon was amazing and although hot from the sirachi, the bacon chutney was wonderful.\\n\\nFor dinner, we both ordered the Spaetzle with smoked salmon with spinach in a light cream sauce served over toasted rustic bread.  I've been to a lot of the top restaurants in Portland as they are constantly popping up every week it seems and eat out probably three times a week. I have be honest, this was one of the best meals I have had in a very long time.  The mixture of ingredients were perfect and the uniqueness of having in house made spaetzle was fantastic.  I guess the spaetzle dish changes seasonally, but if you find the smoke salmon as part of this dish, I highly recommend it.  \\n\\nOverall Equinox was a great place that I'm sorry to say took so long to discover.  It's not written up in local publications nor will it be on the Travel or Food Network channel.  But this is a Portland gem and a great place for great food, great service, and at prices that are very reasonable, especially when compared to other dining establishments that have a big name chef behind it.  \\n\\nPlease note, they also seem to have a very cute, patio for summer time dining as well."},{"name":"Top Thai Kitchen","address":"5000 E Fourth Plain Blvd, Ste A101","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Their Panang curry is rich, layered and frankly the best I've ever had.

Once we reached the front of the line we were able to see the available choices. We chose 4 donuts- the voodoo doll of course, Portland cream, bacon maple bar and the loop. The donuts were good, but they weren't to die for. There is quite a bit of a hype for this place, but I think it is the large variety and odd flavours available that keep people coming back.

The food is wonderful, the drinks list is adequate, and the service is top notch. Complimentary valet parking is convenient, but one should always tip [in my opinion].\\n\\nThe last time I dined here, I had the mussels (which were prepared with unabashed perfection), loud de mer, and the coconut bread pudding to finish. I couldn't have been happier. I'm sure the apple cognac had something to do with that.\\n\\nI gave it four stars based on how I rate food in comparison to other highly decorated restaurant cuisine.

The wine alone isn't too special but with the food it's pretty nice. All their dishes are great, good tasty mains and nice sauce for their salads. Very reasonable prices especially in downtown. Parking lot, skytrain station, and bus stops all at walking distance so it's very convenient. In Nordstrom but there's an entrance outside that have an elevator that brings you directly to Bistro Verde, it's really not hard to find at all. Good attitude and service, decent speed. The staff that guided us to our table wasn't too friendly or welcoming at all, not a face that should be seen when customers first walk in, but the waiters and waitresses are all very friendly and attentive. Clean and organized, good atmosphere a bit on the louder side but still relaxing with a nice view. A bar and quite a few seats and usually not super packed so no need to wait too long. Would highly recommend it if you are around the area and want actually food or something decent but not extravagant for lunch or just a more casual date, this is a pretty nice spot. I'll definitely go again for sure. Love the salad and highly recommend their roasted chicken. It's crispy on the outside, nice and juicy on the inside not over cooked at all, nice sauce with the mushrooms, ginger, and lemon. Great combination and delicious. A bit on the savoury side for me personally because I eat very light but to most people it's literally the perfect seasoning!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Why anyone would wait an hour for a doughnut is ridiculous!

I had the chicken and waffles, my meal was around $15 and would definitely have been more than enough food to share. The service was also good but I went with a friend and we ended up having to sit at the bar, which brings me to a few negatives. \\n\\nUpon arrival the hostess advised us that it would be an hour wait for a table, although the restaurant appeared to have plenty of open tables. The hostess explained that the tables were reserved for customers who had previously made reservations. However, while we were there, we saw a total of 4 reservations come in, which still left plenty of open tables (Yes, I was petty and counted the guests who came in and were seated with reservations), we were at the bar which is right by the host stand so this was easy to do. I should add that we walked in the door at 1:38 pm, I found it odd that a restaurant wouldn't have any open tables around this time and even more odd that there would be such a great need for reservations on a Saturday afternoon...but I get it, its a new place and really in-demand, or something! \\n\\nThere were lots of tourists to come in, sit down at the bar for a little while and leave! I suppose they were just trying to see T.I but it got annoying quick. We knew they were tourists because they told us, btw. \\n\\nThe restaurant was beautiful, which is not a typical compliment for a restaurant, I suppose, but upon walking in the door it is obvious that a lot of work went into the place and as a guest, I appreciate that. So after my meal I went to the restroom and I felt very let down. The restroom was really plain, with a small mirror, dirty sinks and not so well-kept floors. The trash cans looked like they belonged in someone's kitchen and the mirror was so small that I hardly noticed it when I walked in. I just feel like if your dining area is awesome then your restrooms should be as well, waking into the restroom was a completely different atmosphere.  \\n\\nValet parking was $20 and self-park was $5. We did self-parking and had to pay before we parked, which was different! When we left the restaurant we were not even able to get back to our cars the same way that we came from the parking garaged and were advised that we would have to walk all the way to the other side of the building and through the parking garage to do so. This was a huge inconvenience and no exaggeration, it took us about 12 minutes just to get back to our cars. \\n\\nQuick summary: The food was great and plentiful. The fired chicken was beyond amazing and the sweet potato waffle was worth going through the extra drama. All-in-all I feel like they still have a few kinks to work out but I will be returning ASAP for more yummy food!"},{"name":"Sushi Me","address":"3655 SW Hall Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"Let me start by saying I was a Sushi Me believer until this last visit. \\n\\nThis visit started by being greeted by man who appeared to be the owner... greeted by a not so funny joke. I disregarded it because it seemed like he thought he was funny (throw a dog a bone). We were seated & our drink orders were taken.\\n\\nIt is a sushi-go-round so you would think we could eat almost immediately, however, we couldn't because we were never given utensil. Fast forward 15 min, I turn around & the server looked at us with an \\"oh shit\\" face proving he forgot about our table. \\n\\nWe placed our orders & things were going okay. I received the orders & literally half of the things were wrong. I also confirmed with my order that I only ONE item of each. Apparently their goal is to screw you up for the AYCE & bring you TWO.\\n\\nAs we are waiting, the funny man came back & asked if we were doing okay. One of us ordered a beer & he said he might be out. We said if its out, we dont want any beer. This guy literally had the most awk convo with us by trying to upsell every friggin beer on the menu. Dude, leave us alone.\\n\\nIn the middle of our dinner, apparently this comedian decides to come up behind me and pretend to shake my head, give me bunny ears, etc. When my sister said \\"dont do that; thats rude to do.\\" He walks away & says \\"ugh you guys arent fun\\"... well sorry dude, you aint funny.\\n\\nAnyways, we ate our food as they slowly... I mean slooooowwwwwlllly come out. At the end, we have a bowl of ramen left over that was partially eaten. Yes, I understand that at AYCE, you will have a charge for uneaten food. But heres the f'ed up part...\\n\\nWe asked this hilarious man for the check, he tells us to go to the front counter to pay. A few minutes later, this poor server came to us & said the in-house comedian told her to let us know we would be charged extra for the ramen. OMFG this \\"boss\\" sent someone to do his dirty work?!

Like you were weak-in-the-knees-after-having-your-face-sucked-off-while-making-out kind of turned on? Well, the Cherry Adam just blew my mind. I am slack jawed in love. I have only laid my lips once to this bad boy and he has left his name forever branded on me like a slutty tattoo above my ass.\\n\\nI have been aware of HOTD for a few years now, and it wasn't until today that I had ever tried any of their beers! I typically go for HUGE flavor profiles in beer, so how I have let this brewery escape me for so long is truly a mystery! We came in on a Wednesday around 4pm, and there were maybe 5 or 6 people hangng out, having some food and drinking. A good sign to me right away was that almost everyone there was eating! \\n\\nDespite being full from a late lunch, we ordered the large pickle plate and a coconut curry chocolate bar. Even if the chocolate was imported, I was still impressed with the 8 different chocolate bars they had for sale ($4.50) that paired exceptionally well with the Cherry Adam and most of their vintage bottles. Big enough to share, the pickle plate did not disappoint either! The pickle plate ($6) had 10 different kinds of pickles, mostly sourced from Pickleopolis or made in house, including beets, carrots, asparagus, green beans, caper berries, sweet pickles, kosher style pickles, cabbage, and sweet pickled jalapenos. \\n\\nMy companions each ordered the Walk The Dog, which features 4 of the 3oz samplers for $7. All of the draft beers are available in 12oz pours for about $4.50, and in 3oz samplers for $2. With only about 6 beers on tap at any given time, the Walk is really a great way to introduce yourself to the concise and complex availability.  While the beers are mostly mild when it comes to hoppiness and bitterness, they are  simultaneously sexy and assertive with large bouquets of florals and fruit. Each beer felt very true to its menu description!\\n\\nThe Cherry Adam was $8.50 a glass, and $4 for a taster, but the Cherry is a very special, small batch of the Adam beer that has been bourbon barrel aged for 20 months. This beer truly is spectacular! They only have it on draft for a month or two at a time, and only every 12 to 15 months at that! I was extremely fortunate to sample my new favorite beer today when I had the chance! The waitress said there was only maybe 10 glasses left in the barrel! They are selling 12 oz bottles for take home as of this Saturday, 3/12, until they run out (which will be soon!) for $10. You can buy some of the 2009 vintage Cherry Adam to drink in house for $12, or $15 for the 2008. If you are dating someone who loves chocolate covered cherries, this beer will make her feel like you see into her soul. It truly is take your panties off right now kind of good."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Excellent doughnuts, art and prices!

I was really surprised because I've been here before and had good food and experiences, but this time we were seated in the Atrium for the first time. I'm not sure if that had anything to do with it, but we sat there for around 35 minutes before we even had our drink orders taken. Then, we ordered a few tapas and several entrees as well. The server asked if we wanted to split the service into two parts and we told him to bring it all out as it came up so we could go ahead and get eating more quickly. The server ended up splitting the service so that we thought we were done and he was just bringing additional tapas that we had forgotten that we even ordered by that time! They also brought my husband the wrong entree. We told them to not remake it because it would take too long and just take it off the bill instead, which they said they would. We waited forever to get our bill and when the server came back, he actually was bringing the new entree that he had said he cancelled! We had to ask another server for our bill. We all put our cards in the bill to be picked up and nobody came by for it. We were just about to go find someone when the manager came to the table and told us we needed to leave because we had been at the table too long and there was another party waiting for the table! I told him that we had been ready to leave for quite awhile and that nobody had been back for us to pay our bill. He took it and we paid. Our bill was a couple hundred dollars.

Me and the sister shared the trio de papas, which is exactly what the name is, there were three types of boiled potatoes with three sauces.  They were ok, just that I was expecting them to be prepared in three ways and thus was disappointed.  The next item we got was the yuca rellena. These were good when they were warm, once they got cold (which happened very quickly once they got to the table) they were chewy and didn't taste as good.  The last item we got was the tortilla de patata, which was the best dish of the 3.  The had the right balance to potatos to egg mix and was seasoned very well. \\n\\nOn a speparte note, the drinks here are very good.  I had pisco sour \\"kuong tong\\" which was the right balance of sweet and sour for me.  Plus, it allowed me to have a pisco sour without that nasty egg whites that come in a traditional one.

I had heard from a couple of people that it was their favorite restaurant when they felt like spending money on good food. Needless to say, I was excited to try it. I made a reservation on Open table,  and indicated that it was a birthday celebration. I was pleasantly surprised to be given a menu with happy birthday stamped on it. Also, the hostess and our server also knew it was my birthday. \\n\\nNote about valet: it's only $3, but they'll likely give you a speech about how they don't see any of that and live off tips. In that area, unfortunately, it's hard to find street parking that is convenient. So like a lot of places in Atlanta, the valet is required (albeit not necessary since it is a parking garage). \\n\\nOnce seated, we looked oved the menu. Their entrees are a la carte, so the meal can add up pretty quickly when you have to pay for sides separately. I ordered the monkfish with a side of grits. I enjoyed every bite of my dish. Along with the romesco, it was flavorful and flaky, cooked perfectly. The grits had cheese (yay!), were flavorful, and silky smooth just how I like them. My friends ordered mussels and scallops, and really enjoyed those, too. There was enough on the menu that if you're excited about seafood, you'll have enough tasty-sounding options from which to choose. \\n\\nWe also ordered drinks. I opted for a Manhattan, my favorite drink.  It was well-made and very strong. I also asked for 3 of my favorite \\"special\\" cherries because you can't just get one, lol. \\n\\nIn recognition of my birthday, they brought out a plate with a candle. I am a minimalist, but this is something I have never seen before. Before I could make a wish, it went out on it's own! I appreciated the intent, but can say without hesitation, that something else on that plate (i.e. food) would have been welcomed.\\n\\nOverall, it was a great experience. Service, food, and ambience all worked together. I would definitely return. This was my first time, so I can't give it 5 stars until I know that they're consistent and other things on the menu are equally as delicious.

The salad included plentiful veggies, and even though it was simple, it was delicious.\\n-Prices - one of the best-priced brunches you'll get in the area. An entire breakfast plate (with generous portions) is less than $8! Unbelievable! The value alone makes Mixtura worth going to.\\n\\nCons:\\n-Slow service & noticeable lack of waitstaff.

LOL.\\n\\nI'm not jaded but I don't see the big deal here.  I've tried 7 or 8 different doughnuts from the VooDoo Dozen and they are more or less made from two or three base doughnut recipes with different toppings. All things considered, only a very small portion of their menu is that creative and unique tasting.  Otherwise it's just a different flavored icing (and the flavor isn't that strong) with some different types of sprinkles.  So I'd recommend avoiding the tempatation to get the $9.95 Basic Dozen or $13 VooDoo dozen and choose your doughnuts individually and carefully.  You'll have plenty of time to decide standing in the ridiculously long line for a half hour or up to an hour depending on day and time.\\n\\nI honestly don't think they surpass a freshly cooked Krispy Kreme or Top Pot but I get the cult following thing.  Not worth standing in line for more than 15 minutes in my opinion unless you're a tourist and REALLY into doughnuts, or just want to say you've gone there - just don't let your expectations get too high.\\n\\nMy hat goes off though to the business and how well they've hyped their brand but otherwise any level headed person I think would agree this place is overrated.\\n\\nDoughnuts get a 4 star (I've had better), customer service, mainly the long wait in line gets 2 stars, prices get 3.5 stars = 3 star average."},{"name":"Don Dario's","address":"8801 S I H 35","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Great food.

Of course, all the history in the world means nothing if the food's not up to par, and considering that this is the oldest restaurant in America, it's pretty fair to say that literally generations of culinary fans have given the Oyster House a thumbs-up.

I have been to this place 3 times in the past. I have always enjoyed the food, ambiance, and the presentation of the food. (I love to take pics of my food and post on social media) However today ended up being The ABSOLUTE worst dining experience I've had in my 20+ years being a patron at restaurants. First the parking is terrible so I waited in the valet line for 15-20 mins to park. Because of that we were late for our reservations. (15 mins) The hostess was completely rude and very passive aggressive. However I did have a friend explain to her what was happening. My reservation was for 6 but I had a friend bring an extra person. Ok I do understand a small space needs a heads up to accommodate but the treatment we received because of it was uncalled for. The so called manager/owner/bartender (Queen James) came to the table and only made the experience worst. He was unapologetic about the way we were spoke to or treated. He lacks class and tact which is important for running a restaurant or anything that has to do with customer service. I usually don't write review unless I have a positive experience and I'm surely not the person to call names but I over heard him discussing what happened with some of his co workers and he called us names. Yes I understand that does not warrant me calling him names but I am out of character because of how my friends and I were treated today. Last my food was terrible, I wanted to send it back but my friend begged me not to.
