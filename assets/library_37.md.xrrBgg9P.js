This could very well be the next biggest national brand.

Besides no drinks for nearly a quarter of a game, it got worse. When we tried to pay, with a gift card and a BYFAD (buy your friend a drink card), none of our money was accepted.

EDIT: The BYFAD card doesnt work here for drinks, so while frustrating and confusing, not technically King's fault. \\n\\nIf you had studied any service marketing, you would understand the damage of pissing off a repeat customer.

What levitation my buds experienced.  Perfectly cooked belly, a HUGE piece - must have been 6 ounces or more, richly coated with some marinade and roasted to perfection, perfect balance of fat to meat.  Not only was the belly superb, the the squash was a new experience - skin on!  It was delightful.  Kind of crunchy with the skin, and much more flavorful than typical naked squash!  I'm going to cook mine that way from now on.  \\n\\nHusband had the little breakfast sammies, pork with egg, and we both loved both their looks and their taste.  The sausage inside was garlicky and flavorful, although it did need salt.  The eggs were fluffy and light and not overcooked.  The coffee cake slice we ordered when prompted by the waitress (as an appetizer, yum!) was superb.  They know baked goods.  \\n\\nNow let's discuss the Hollandaise!  Buttery, the perfect amount of lemon, thicker than I get mine at home, and spot-on.  I got one little side of this wonderful sauce to go with my pork belly.  Are you incredulous yet?

Almost all restaurants group the meat-based dishes together and the vegetarian foods are usually grouped together.\\n\\nI thought the food was otherwise very good and it's a shame they screwed this up for me.

Unfortunately for them, I have other options and will not have to question whether a dish is chicken or paneer, even though the identification card may have said chicken.

It's quite refreshing to meet a passionate and talented chef that pours his skills and soul into each dish. Fluent in French, Chef Jake received a culinary arts degree while studying at √âcole des Beaux Arts in Annecy, France and continued his education at Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts in Orlando. No stranger to public accolades, Jake has been featured on the table at the James Beard House and in the pages of Food and Wine, Sommelier Journal and USA Today.\\n\\nHis re-crafted menu showcases a bevy of interesting fare with 11 highlighted ingredients and a signature 11 spice blend - which I took home and have since enjoyed on everything from chicken to popcorn.

Between the unobstructed views of South Orlando and the memorable cuisine, here's why you should trek out to Eleven this summer.\\n\\nThree Words....Meyer Lemon Butter. While the butter to accompany the bread service will change based on what's in the kitchen and in season, this carb accompaniment became a standout of our experience. Have you ever heard of a chef that changes the BUTTER based on the season? This level of detail is why this spot shines.\\n\\nServed warm in a mini Staub tray, your meal will start with a new take on the traditional Parker House rolls.

Bonus points to the restaurant for firework views at night!\\n\\nFrom family reunions (pun intended) to date nights and drinks after a day on the golf course, this spot is suited to meet a wide range of dining occasions.\\n\\nI found a filet on the menu that was served over a bed of five cheese mac and cheese and then topped with a pomegranate glaze. Why have steak and potatoes when there's meat and mac? A fun twist on a classic.\\n\\nRarely can a kitchen turn out equally exceptional steaks and seafood. Their grouper with Anson Mills grits and asparagus, not only looks pretty but delivered on all the flavor you'd expect.\\n\\nAfter the sorbet, seasonal butter and decadent entrees you'll be tempted to skip dessert.

We came in around 3pm on a Friday, and the restaurant was half empty, so that was the upside- no long line like they have during the weekend brunch hours.

The sausage ragu wasn't as salty, and I thought the flavors worked better together this time around, Recommended!\\n-Tasty Mary (Monopolowa Vodka, Tomato, Worcestershire, Horseradish, Lemon, Sriracha, Celery Salt, Celery, House Pickles, $8, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tasty-n-sons-portland#VuTKypG2rK7xbK6kG5dWcw): Yum! The have more than 1 version of the bloody mary here, which we sadly did not have a chance to try.

The fries were delicious though, and nicely crispy.\\n-Fried Cauliflower & Olives w/Harissa Cream ($5, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tasty-n-sons-portland#dnCdFldKwGfONiqQ2tjUiQ): Yum! I loved the fried cauliflower and olives, although the olives were super salty if you popped the whole thing in your mouth. I also loved the harissa cream, but I wished they served it in a separate container versus dolloping on top, since it was hard to wipe off a blob of cream for some of the cauliflower pieces. \\n\\nAlthough I was disappointed in the smaller menu, I still had a good \\"snack\\" at Tasty n Sons. Next time I'll have to check out the Tasty n Alder location since they have different menu items there. Service here is just ok- the waitresses seem very detached/disinterested, and are not warm at all. At least they get the job done.

I looked at the website & was looking forward to the meal. From the description of the restaurant & from the price, I was expecting exceptional service & food. The place is called Beast, so I expected a meat-heavy meal. What we received was not even close. We were a party of 4 (mid 20's-early 30's). The website told us to arrive in a timely manner, so we arrived 10 mins before noon. We walked in & were the first guests there. A hostess informed us that they weren't ready to seat us yet. There is no designated waiting area in the restaurant, so we kind of just awkwardly stood in the entrance area in front of the coat rack & main door. We were seated after about 5 mins of waiting, so that's not too bad. It smelled very nice, so we were looking forward to the meal.\\n\\nI did not drink the coffee, so I can't comment on it. I do know that it was French Press. The water was room temperature w/ no ice. I don't know about everyone else, but I like my water cold. The waiters did keep my glass full though, so they were attentive. First course was very good. All 4 of us cleaned out each of our ramekins, so we were hoping the following courses would be just as impressive. The next course was what we were all looking forward to: Beast Hash w/ braised pork belly. I would've loved it if there were more than 2 measly pieces of pork belly. I was digging to find the meat. It definitely was NOT a beastly hash. The next course was a salad w/ cheese & grapes. Grapes were good. I left some salad & some cheese on my plate. Last course was a really rich, deep chocolate cake. I am not a chocolate fan, so I only had one bite. Those who like chocolate would've loved the dessert, though.\\n\\nIn summation, we had a nice time together in the restaurant, but would not recommend it or return to it. All 4 of us agreed that it was not worth the money we paid & we left still hungry. We had a much better brunch the day before at Bad Habit Room for a fraction of the cost."},{"name":"Machine Head Coffee","address":"1701 East Mlk Blvd, Ste 103, Veracruz All Natural","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I am visiting from out of town and Machine Head was at the top of my coffee shop list.

No breading please.\\"   They soon brought the  fish. Both sides I ordered were missing and replaced with something I did not want.  Waitress did not even notice the screw up. I brought it to her attention and the sides were brought out. Right fish;  wrong sides.  Annoying.  \\n\\nBut big issue was that fish was unseasoned.  It was extremely bland - seemed like a steamed fish I have when dieting.  I asked if it was steamed .  They assured me  it was baked.  It was Gross - bland, flavorless  wettish haddock . Awful preparation.  Not at all what I expect flavor wise. Chef must be bad to serve something like that. \\n\\nWaitress was awful too. After unsuccessfully pushing us hard to buy pricey specials and exotic drinks, waitress lost interest in us. Instead, Waitress devoted her fake smiles and snake-like charms to the big party (big tip!) next to us.  She just blew us off.  We watched her avoid making eye contact with us.   It was so obvious.

Would've given 5 stars but when I went for a refill some AA chick with hindi painting on her face, wearing a choker, deliberately ignored me until I said may I have a refill. I guess me holding a cup with melting ice in eye level view wasn't enough. I realize she was helping other customers which is why I held my cup up and pointed at the tea so I wouldn't interrupt a customer verifying their order. **shrugs** whatever. \\n\\nFood: 2 stars: the mac n cheese is the best I've had anywhere besides making it at home myself. The chicken was greasy a.f., I know it's fried chicken but damn! Church's chicken isn't even that damn greasy! Would've given them 4 stars but it was just too effing greasy! Seasoned well but once that grease hits you, you get nauseated. \\n\\nPrice point: 3 stars: good prices considering where they are operating from. I'm sure their monthly rent is a kick in the nuts. They are a hell of a lot cheaper than some of the other eateries in there. I ordered 1/2 a chicken, 1 drink (comes with 1 free refill), it came with 2 rolls, and a  side order of mac n cheese for about $15 and some change. That was enough for me and the brood (2 kids) to share and it take the edge off of hunger pains. \\n\\nOverall: would I come back? Idk man, it was just ok. But popeyes is up the street and I can get more for $15 from popeyes and it not be so greasy I have to blot it with napkins. The mac n cheese was good, but that's like $4 for a small cup. For $16 more I could make a whole damn pan at home. Ijs... if you are feeling lazy it's a good place to come. It was nice to try out but I've been there and done that. Just depends on my mood I guess, it's a coin toss. Would've given them a 3 but I threw most of it away because it was too greasy and the \\"types\\" that work there it wasn't even worth it to me to complain, my blood pressure was already raised by the chicken I didn't need to have a stroke combating a bad attitude. Don't be fooled by all these 4 and 5 stars reviews, they are coming from people who can't boil hotdogs! If you can really throw down in the kitchen you will feel short changed eating here.

Sounded appealling - how could you resist a restaurant named Toast?\\n\\nIt was pouring down rain, and we were lucky to cram into the waiting area before the rush of peeps - but upon entering it was freaking chaos. There was no real immediately visible order to how tables were called, and someone promptly walked up from behind us and wrote their name on a clipboarded list sitting on the counter. Would not have noticed it otherwise. \\n\\nWe got our name down  next - and were faced with the relatively confusing request for table or bar. Well, either would be fine...but who wouldn't prefer a table when dining with a companion? Seems overly complicated. Also insinuates some moral deformity if you're the asshole who writes down \\"table\\" when everyone else writes \\"either.\\"\\n\\nThe host himself was very gracious about checking in with us during our wait and being friendly in a way that earns tips without seeming fake or grubbing.\\n\\nThe artwork and decor is meh - nothing that fascinating to look at. Kids drawings hold their allure for about five seconds. Would be better concentrated in one area.\\n\\nWe were seated after about 10 minutes (maybe more) of waiting and that's where the hospitality left us. \\n\\nThe waitress seemed rushed and promptly announced that they were out of several meals because it was nearing the end of their operating hours. OK - that's cool. But way to make people feel unwelcome before they've even been welcomed. She was good about mentioning specials - but rattled it so fast I could barely remember what they were when she returned to get our drink orders. I just had whatever my friend ordered - some orange juice concoction because I felt rushed. \\n\\nI ate something plain and basic because all the entrees looked overly complicated - which it shouldn't be - because it's BREAKFAST. Where the hell is the French Toast? At Toast - there should be some French Toast. I wanted it - but not on the menu. Or pancakes. I'm sorry - if you serve breakfast, you should at least have the staple foods of breakfast. Right?\\n\\nThere was no one meal that seemed appetizing, so I switched out the bacon on the Pacific Northwest Plate (or some similar title) for sausage. The sausage is the best thing this place has going for it. Best I've ever eaten...which is why it gets three stars. The eggs were runny and undercooked (yeck) and the toast in TOAST was dry and a bit burned. Hmph. \\n\\nThe waitress returned to collect our payment for the check - I'd gone to the trouble of starring my orders - and she promptly asked before even looking if we were just splitting it down the middle. Why no, we weren't. Not only is it awkward then to explain that I'd ordered cheaper items and didn't really WANT to split it...but I'd already starred it. \\n\\nAfter some embarassed spluttering on my end - she opened the book and said, \\"Well I don't know which is your card sweetie.\\" Sweetie. WTF? Only grizzled elderly waitresses at a truck stop or sweet old Grandmas or any other person but a smarmy hipster waitress gets to call me sweetie.\\n\\nOverall - while the food was edible (and in some cases, extremely delicious)...I can think of no real reason to return to this place. It was loud (not great for conversing), the wait staff was rude, and their decoration scheme (or lack thereof) is like some second-rate regretsy bullcrap.\\n\\nA resounding \\"pass\\" from me.

I joined the group and sat for 15 minutes before even being offered water and had to basically grab a passing server to get in a drink order. There was zero service. Watching the servers, unless you reached out and waved your arms in their face, they passed you by. And once you got their attention, they got your order and ignored the rest of your table as if they could only take 1 order at a time. Then good luck getting them again. And when they finally brought my drink, dropped it off without a word and took off, couldn't even put in a food order and didn't check with the rest of the table to see if they wanted anything. People from the table started going to the bar after sitting with empty glasses for 30 mins to order since the servers were so bad. One lady said she had asked the server twice for a drink and finally went to the, bar. After watching a bit, this was common with the other tables as well.

The turkey was sliced into super huge thick slices that were somehow soggy and overcooked on the edges all at the same time (would've been better if turkey was actually sliced thin - felt like turkey came from processed breasts instead of actually from a fresh roasted turkey breast), the brie had pretty much melted out except for the rind and I could have used more of the fig preserves and actually the fig preserves could have used more fig themselves! This sandwich was probably what I was looking forward to the most and it was disappointing. \\n\\nI also had the side of asparagus and tofu salad. Surprisingly, the tofu was pretty good but the asparagus was very fibrous and stringy so a little difficult to enjoy. \\n\\nThen there was the Asian green bean salad - love the concept but didn't get a whole lot of Asian flavor and the beans could have been cooked longer which also left them a little stringy. \\n\\nOn to what drove me to write this review - the field green, goat cheese, pecan, apple salad.

NOT a great way to invite customers into a restaurant. Despite my protests to leave while we had the chance, 'he' insisted we go.

Dumplings were 'interesting' according to hubby. Knowing him, I took this to mean \\"yeah, won't be ordering those again\\". The soup tasted like no other Tom Yum soup I've had before. It was missing the sharpness from the lime and heat from the chilies and it had little floating globs of oil in. It's not really supposed to be an oily soup. Also part of the seafood concoction in the bowl was made up of pre-cut squid rings (I guess the same that are used for their calamari dish). Now if the soup was on-point with flavor I would forgive the squid rings, but it just added to my disappointment.\\n\\nOnto the entr√©e..\\n\\nI had Wild Curry with Chicken (it's a force of habit that I gravitate to the spiciest things on a menu) with brown rice.

We also had beef ribs in bean curd which was FAR better than it looked and also ordered lotus paste wrapped in a roll of some sort.  We also had an order of Beef Chow Foon which was a huge amount of food.

I enjoyed a wonderful and generous portion of pacific smoked salmon accented with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, capers, minced onion and herbed cream cheese all on a nicely toasted bagel (that last part is important because who hasn't dealt with the misery of adjusting the hotel conveyor belt style toaster only to get either untoasted or completely burnt bread).

Then I had a perfectly prepared  Veggie omelette by a friendly and incredibly efficient cook. For my third course I went for a fruit plate topped with dried apricots, natural almonds, and fantastically thick plain yoghurt. There is also at this buffet a good assortment of baked goods (scones, croissants, strudels etc). As well there are cheeses, cold cuts, pancakes with blueberries and maple syrup, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, hot vegetables, salad, bread pudding, oatmeal and cold cereals. You name it and they have what anyone used to a North American style breakfast would want or expect in a fabulous morning meal. On top of that the coffee is excellent (strong and dark which is how I like it). Wait staff are friendly and will keep refilling your coffee and water without prompting as well as refill any of the food items that are running low. Breakfast doesn't really get any better than this in my opinion. I also came here this evening for dinner as I needed something quick and convenient. They didn't disappoint.

This could have merited a 3 or 4 star rating, but only 1 star because one of my friends is now suffering from food poisoning due to under-cooked chicken in the seasonal gnocchi dish, which apparently is common because I recently heard a story of another friend who got food poisoning from under-cooked chicken here.

I had a salmon, scallop and shrimp dish over couscous that was *really* good.  A  bit more pricey than I'm used to in a pub, but well worth the price considering the taste.  Their chef should definitely be commended.  They weren't in a hurry to get us out the door, the music wasn't so loud that I had to yell to my table mates, and a lovely evening was had by all.

Then once we sit were all talking for a few minutes, after a while we notice no one has come to take our order, so I walk over to the bar where there are 3 employees doing nothing and I ask can we have menus. The guy was nice and apologized then came right over to bring us menu's. He took our drink order and shortly after came to take our food order.

Quite possibly the best meal I've ever eaten.\\nHere's a breakdown of the dishes I ate.  My apologies if I get something wrong.\\n\\nCheese plate:  This came with three cheeses.  A blue cheese that was top notch, creamy and pungent.  A 2-year smoked gouda, which actually tastes nothing like what you'd find in the store.  It had gritty crystals in it, more parmesean-like than the creamy texture I'm used to.  And a goat cheese, which was harder than the soft, creamy goat cheeses you'd find at a grocer.  All three were delicious.  This came with homemade applesauce, fig jam, and honeycomb, as well as bread and house made beer nuts.\\n\\nCharred edamame with pop rocks.  You heard me right.  Homemade pop rocks made with salt.  Very cool texture to add to the beans.\\n\\nRaw scallops with sorbet and cucumber.  Best scallop dish I've ever eaten.  The combination is a great mix of cool and warm, icy and silky, sweet and salty.\\n\\nPork cheek with fig jam, mustard, and toast.  Very tender.  The cheek alone is worth its weight in gold, and the combination is through the roof.  A must.\\n\\nOxtail on flatbread with mushrooms and blue cheese.  The blue cheese can be a bit much, but if the proportions are right, the oxtail is extremely succulent, it makes for a great dish.\\n\\nFoie gras and pork belly bahn \\"minis\\".  Very rich, but a smaller dish.  I hinted a sweet chili sauce that balanced out the savory ingredients.\\n\\nDessert:\\n\\nFoie \\"PB & J.\\"  Maybe the best dessert I've ever eaten.  The combination is amazing.  A pillowly, fluffy french toast with a foie mousse and some homemade jam, along with crunchy, crispy, peanut butter crackles that added nice texture.\\n\\nLemon panna cotta with beet sorbet and \\"thyme bomb\\".  The dish wasn't spectacular, if it wasn't for the beet sorbet.  Fantastic idea, and it pairs well with the thyme.\\n\\nThis restaurant could quickly climb the ladder to very top of Austin's eateries.

Living in California, I have been exposed to a wide array of different Vietnamese restaurants/foods but I must admit that nothing is comparable to this place. My experience here has been nothing but wonderful. On my first visit, I ordered the vermicelli bowl with meatballs and crispy pork belly and the spring rolls. The crispy pork skin crackling perfectly atop soft vermicelli was to die for. Together with the veggies, it created an amazing combination of textures. The spring rolls were extremely fresh and well matched with a complementing sauce. This dipping sauce added a unique flavor and give a further boost to the already satisfying appetizer.\\n\\nDuring my second visit, I ordered a rice plate with grilled beef short ribs, black tiger shrimp, and lemongrass chicken and the Taro Milk Tea. Can I just say that the meat at this place was marinated and grilled to perfection? It really was. Everything was impeccable! Additionally their Taro milk tea was amazing. Unlike other milk tea places which usually use flavored powder to make their drinks, Fresh Roll made their Taro milk tea using real taro root. The sweetness of the milk tea hits the right spot. Also, the price for the milk tea is reasonable for the quality.\\n\\nI'm a little bit sad that I didn't get to try the Pho.

This place is in the MFA. We had tickets to the 8pm Hopper Exhibit Friday night. Since we didn't want to rush dinner I had the bright idea of going to the Museum early and trying Bravo. I knew almost nothing about the place and could not find an online menu.\\n\\nWell, when we showed up, the way the hostess said  \\"You don't have a reservation??\\" should have tipped us off. Or, the fact that we were the youngest people in there by at least 20 years (and we're not spring chickens) may have been another indicator.\\n\\nSince we had no reservation, we sat at the bar. The bartenders was slammed. He was making drinks for all of the tables and taking care of at least 6 -8 parties that were dining in the bar area. It took a while to get drinks but we were understanding. And, it took forever to be able to place our order but again, we were forgiving. \\nWe saw others at the bar with bread so we asked for some as well. Turns out, the bartender had to go all the way back to the kitchen (which is very far from the bar) to get it. No one was there to help him with simple things, like a bread basket.   \\n\\nThe menu was limited and kind of pricey (apps all close to $15 and entrees around $30+). And, we could tell it was going to take forever (by how busy the bartender was) so we opted for a bunch of apps instead of entrees, thinking that would be quicker. \\n\\nI'll start with the good:\\n- Tuna tartare was delicuous, A great portion and lightly seasoned with soy & citrus. It was very simple. I actually would have liked if it was served with wasabi or a spicy sauce but it was still very good.\\n- The cheese plate at the end of the meal was good. Three generous portions of cheese with an apricot chutney, honey and candied pecans. The two slices of bread it came with were lacking but the cheese made up for it.  \\n\\nOkay, the good is over:\\n- The California figs with mixed greens were good but the serving size was a joke. We got one and a half very small figs (not even 2 full figs) with a teasponn of riccotta cheese and a half a cup of mixed greens. For $13!\\n- The grilled eggplant dish was equally small. It had about 4 small slices of eggplant with a few cherry tomatoes & a few mixed greens. Some of the eggplant was completely raw and we couldn't even get a knife through it. I think this dish was $14\\n- The worst dish of all was the grilled asparagus. Although it tasted fine, it consisted of 3 (yes only 3) small stalks of asparaugus and a few greens with a miniscule amount of shaved truffle on them. The quail egg it was supposed to come with was noticeably absent. This dish cost $15. Yes, that equals $5 per stalk. I know truffles are pricey but there is no way this dish was worth $15 (even if they hadn't \\"forgotten\\" the quail egg).\\n\\nSince the bartender was so busy and pretty much non-existent while we ate, we didn't have a chance to say anything about the missing quail egg or the hard-as-a-rock eggplant. When we finally got a chance to order the cheese plate I very nicely said 'I know you're really swamped but we wanted to let you there was no quail egg on our dish and the eggplant was raw.\\" \\n\\nDo you what what he said?\\" I'm going to have to kick some ass tonight!\\" That's it. He did not apologize at all. He did not offer to comp. anything or try to make it up to us in any way. The way he handled the situation was terrible.  He had no people skills and was not customer-centric at all. \\nThis was the most overpriced, poorly executed meal I've had in a long time. We spent over $100 on a few very small apps, 2 glasses of wine and a cheese plate. Since I can't justifiably under-tip someone even if the food & service is crappy, I gave him a decent tip. Then, I wrote him a note on the check explaing to him what went wrong. Hopefully he might learn something.       \\n\\nSide note: The Hopper Exhibit was excellent, although very crowded (which is understandable for a Friday night). \\nOh, and my boyfriend was still hungry when we got home and had to eat a bowl of Rice Krispies. It sucks that I offer to take us out on a date and I spent over $100 on dinner (plus $50 for Museum) and he had to still eat cereal in order to feel satiated."},{"name":"Swift's Attic","address":"315 Congress Ave, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Pretty much everything I've ordered here was spot on!

Both were outstanding; the portion of tartare was generous and well flavored without overshadowing the creaminess of the meat, and the pasta was perfectly al dente with tender mushrooms bathed in a sauce that I wish I knew how to make.\\n\\nI ordered the pork chop and my friend had the lamb. I'm picky about my pork and this didn't disappoint. It was a huge portion though, and so some sections were drier than others. The sauce it came with was really what made the dish. There were some creamed cabbage on the side, but it was too heavy to go with the pork. My friend's lamb was medium rare and flavorful - another huge portion with an excellent sauce. Stuffed beyond belief, we still managed to share the chocolate mousse in all its thick rich chocolately glory.\\n\\n The Butcher Shop was pretty good - it excelled in the small plates, but some parts of the entrees weren't as outstanding as I've come to expect from one of Barbara Lynch's places. The service was a little hit and miss too; we sat for a good while at the bar and no one approached us to explain the menu, and there were already a few people seated in the place. Later on, the service picked up, with the bartender demonstrating a thorough knowledge of cuts of beef and the thought process behind creating a good tartare. Coming in early did beat the rush, but the staff was a bit slow to catch up."},{"name":"Chevys Fresh Mex","address":"12547 State Rd 535","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"Very good fajita steak, great kids meal and good sampler platter.

Sure the burgers were good, but definitely not to die for, as so many people put it. I wasn't a fan of the fries; they had a sweet taste to them, yet very potato-y. An odd combo, I must say.

The answer is yes we can! I ordered ahead and picked up during my lunch hour. I ordered the Grape Leaves and the Chicken Shawarma platter. This platter includes my absolute favorite which is Hummus with Pita Bread and let me tell you the Hummus was mighty fresh, and the Pita bread was to die for. The Chicken was marinated in indescribable herbs and spices that leave your mouth tingling. The Tabbouleh also comes with the platter  which was amazingly fresh as well. Tabbouleh is a traditional salad dish made of tomatoes, mint, olive oil, lemon juice, and salt. \\n\\nA platter will cost you around 8 to 10 dollars for lunch, which in my opinion is not to shabby. This place is located in the Publix Shopping Plaza on Hiawassee. Please Note make sure you check in when you come here, because you might find yourself with a nice discount from Yelp. I am looking forward to trying the other platters that they offer, considering the first one was such a major hit. I am also stoked because this place is located not to far from my house.

It's not like the other places that try to do the salt and caramel thing-it's good but you need to have a glass of water by your side.

Charcuterie board (about 10 bites) had 2 memorable items: the foie gras bon bon and the beef tartare.   The palate cleanser sorbet was delicious (and sadly the most tasty item of the meal).   The duck leg confit was so salty that I could barely eat it after the first bite.  The salt level was out-of-bounds and ruined the course.    Scallop course:  1 sea scallop with a teenie salad... seriously? The cheese course:  what a joke.. no cheese was memorable.  Naomi couldn't remember one of them.. 3 small pieces of blah.

He told us the fish was grouper. My friend asked about the preparation. Instead, he started telling us what a grouper was. When she clarified she was asking how it was cooked,  he didn't know. He also didn't know what kind of sauce it was in. He had to go to kitchen two times to find out how it was prepared. Managers, make sure your employees know what the specials are!!!

There were 4 of us at the table and everyone enjoyed their food. we had several rolls, pork dumplings, sushi etc. I ordered the pad se ew to try something different. It was very sweet.

I wanted to try Mary's Tacos, but it was closed. So I thought of Taco More, but they don't have diet Dr. Pepper and I REALLY wanted a Diet Dr. Pepper with my tacos. So I headed for Tierra Linda. \\n\\nIt's located inside of a Shell station. The gas station in itself is impressive enough, I may do a separate review. Full on meat market, extensive collection of aloe drinks, rare Hispanic treats... pretty awesome.\\n\\nI took a right from the entrance and made my way to Tierra Linda. A few ladies stood behind the counter, preparing food. The first thing I saw was a girl making fresh tortillas. Score. The menu boasted all of the Mexican standards, and some different stuff like bacon wrapped jalapenos and hot dogs. Obviously, being a weekend and noon, I needed breakfast. I ordered an egg and bean taco and egg, potato and cheese taco. To my pleasure, they did state breakfast is served all damn day, every day. I had my choice of corn or flour tortilla, which I left up to the cashier.\\n\\nAfter placing my order, I walked around for a few minutes, grabbed one of my favorite local bottled coffees (GREAT local selection, by the way) along with my Diet Dr. Pepper and then picked up my order. I had my choice of spicy salsa or not spicy. Obviously, I chose spicy. You do pay at the restaurant rather than the convenient store, so I paid, then paid again, then went home to eat.\\n\\nMy order was wrong. I received a bean and cheese taco and an egg and bean taco. I was really kind of pissed, because I REALLY wanted mass eggs this morning. My anger was just so quickly abated. Both homemade flour tortillas, perfection. The egg and bean was alright- the beans were wonderful, but the egg had no seasoning WHATSOEVER. The bean and cheese, which I didn't even want, was OMG DELICIOUS I LOVE YOU. As I said, their beans are great, and with the PERFECTLY melted, generous cheese on that amazing flour tortilla? YEEAAH.\\n\\nSound good? I haven't even gotten to the best part. The salsa. Man.. this stuff was good. Exactly to my taste- spicy, liquidy, and with a KICK. Very similar to the spicy Taco More salsa. Not better or worse, but use it for reference. Delicious.\\n\\nLess than $2 a taco. Great deal. Amazing flavor. In disclosure, I do think there was meat stock in the salsa. Probably in the beans and tortillas, too, since this place seems pretty legit. Still- this shit was GOOD.

Literally grabbed cooked bacon with his bare hand and put it on a plate. I was so appalled at this! Actually disgusted is more like it. How do you not wash your hands after being outside, touching handles, and coming back in to cook????? Isn't that like food handling 101?

The almond croissant is just a regular croissant with almonds on top. That is NOT the way it should be done, Easy Tiger. A real almond croissant should definitely have almond paste and almonds inside...much like your danish. However, the danish is a bit different with the cardamom glaze, which totally changes the flavor. I highly recommend working on a new recipe for that almond croissant. As for the chocolate croissant, tasty, flaky and really yummy (and I am not a big chocolate person).

However, our overall experience was disappointing.\\n\\nAfter we took a booth around 6pm, our server handed us menus, water, and said he would return when we were ready. Since we were only one of four other tables, we felt lucky; we were starving and assumed we would be able to order and be served quickly. For the next 15 minutes, our server and the other server stood with their backs to not just us but the entire section where all of the patrons sat.  At one point, the other server walked by us to serve another table and though I said something, she didn't hear me. We almost walked out, but then our server finally returned. \\n\\nI ordered the vermicelli grilled chicken bowl and my BF ordered Pad Thai with chicken. We also ordered the crab rangoons to snack on which were described as having been made with ravioli dough. The dough was too thick and the texture just wasn't pleasing, especially when you expect a crispy outside. The dipping sauce was too sour to eat. \\n\\nBoth our dishes arrived arrived around 20 minutes after the app, which was a long time considering there weren't many people there. We both had a lot of chicken, but it really was too much for both our dishes; it was dry and flavorless. Mine was especially dry since it had been cooked and then grilled. Seeing as the chicken must have been already cooked before we ordered, we really didn't understand what took so long. My vermicelli noodles were cooked well and the cucumber and carrots were julienned beautifully. But the bowl was loaded them; aren't they a garnish, not the main ingredients in vermicelli?  The Pad Thai sauce was a bit too gooey. While we were eating, we realized that there was no flavor to either of our dishes. Not even a pinch of heat.\\n\\nWith such a great location and so much competition, they really need to consider how to improve service and their dishes. Though in this neighborhood, it seems people tend to just go to restaurants out of habit and ease of location.

To me the food was just OK. I found the prices here a little high for what you get, I found the menu a bit restricting. There are combo plates, but they reflect the desire to bridge that eclectic creative, pseudo-health, we are saving the earth with our food patina that so many places are trying to pull off. I kind of liked the simplistic yet trendy decor, however sometimes you just want the standards all together, and I recall that it seemed to be a bit ala carte, where if you tried to get an \\"hearty\\" breakfast like many places offer, you probably would spend a lot on too much food.

The service leaves a lot to be desired, but since we like the food and the atmosphere we keep going back. There's one short, dark-haired waitress who is a sweetheart, and the rest make it seem like getting you another drink is a chore. Unless you're a handsome group of young men, then you'll likely get good service. The owner seems likes a friendly lady who is often at the bar but doesn't tend to interact with her customers.\\n\\nOverall: Good food, good atmosphere, good beer selection, slightly overpriced, and mediocre service.

Went for weekend brunch and it was just okay, but I am a bit annoyed about their menu. The place seems like a really upscale Cracker Barrel. I appreciate the organic and locally sourced ingredients that are proudly listed on the chalkboard wall (a little like Portlandia if I do say so). The starter, \\"Bakeshop on a Board\\" was really delicious and all the pastries were nicely presented. There was a nice selection of muffins, scones, and fritters. Our server was great and made sure we received everything quickly. \\n\\nThe reason I am giving a one star rating: I ordered the \\"Fried Chicken & Waffles\\" which was $14.00.  I was served 1/2 of a traditional waffle with one egg that was covered in chicken sausage then deep fried (a scotch egg). I am just going to say this, as a restaurant you put the word \\"waffleS\\" on your menu, then it's really chintzy to serve only 1/2 a waffle in the main entree and 1 deep fried egg. I am thinking this place doesn't understand a plural word, or they were just being cheap. Either way, I left still hungry and their \\"artistic\\" menu description left me disappointed and annoyed.

Ask if they've got your special brand or brew, you might be surprised. \\n\\nFor regulars, join the beer club. My corporate home office is nearby, and nearly everyone I work with is a member.

The reception we got from our waiter, who was fantastic, and the rest of the staff was delightful. I don't care much for seafood but my brother-in-law is a big seafood fan as is his wife. The only seafood I tried was the buffalo popcorn shrimp, which I found to be pretty tasty, even though, again, I'm not much into seafood. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich which was cooked well and hit the spot wonderfully. The rest of my party, who ordered the crab cakes, fish and chips, clam chowder and mac and cheese, all found their meals to be delicious. Plus, my sister-in-law was over the moon about her Manhattan. All in all I would definitely recommend Turner's Seafood.

We arrived at 7:00PM.  There were a grand total of 4 tables occupied, including ourselves.\\n\\nThe furnishing was nice enough.  Overall it was nice and cozy.  The music was fun and upbeat but a little loud and the lighting was interesting, but not in a bad way.  I'm sure it's more than adequate as a hookah bar.  But neither of us are into that sort of thing, we just wanted dinner.  So we sat down.  A waiter took our order promptly, but didn't ask nor offer a drink.  We didn't mention it, because it's basic restaurant service to offer and we figured they would when ready.\\n\\nThen we waited.\\n\\nAgain, only 4 tables, all of which aside from us weren't ordering food.  It took 30 minutes to get 1 of the 2 appetizers we ordered, (which seemed to simply be store bought sambosas that only require frying).  No water was ever offered, we had to ask for it when the appetizers arrived.  An additional 15 minutes of waiting was required for our entrees.  The other appetizer never came.\\n\\nThe entrees weren't amazing.  But they were passable.  Good portion sizes.  The chicken was well flavored, but the rice tasted like it was left under a heating lamp and dried out and crunchy in places.  The hummus was rather salty.  Overall, up to this point, the service was slow, the food was adequate, nothing to write home about, but nothing really to get upset over.  But we were only about half done with the evening at this point.\\n\\nIt is now about 7:55PM.  Our waiter (a different one from before) comes over to ask if we need anything, this is the first time (and last time) anyone came to check up on us. Another yelp review mentioned a manager checking up, we never saw him, maybe he was off that night.  We just ask for the check.  We also make it clear by piling up plates and such that we're just waiting.\\n\\nFive minutes later we see him sitting at a table, using a hookah, playing with his phone and watching TV.  What?  Maybe he's on break?  Maybe he handed us off?  It wasn't clear to us.  It did seem like he was just blowing us off, but we were willing to assume no malice.  It was frustrating though.\\n\\nNow it's 8:10, we've been waiting for 15 minutes for the check, so we can pay and leave.  I get up and ask the other waiter.  He says sure, he'll do it.\\n\\nWe wait another 10 to 15 minutes before I get up again to try to get the check.  Only at this point does the other waiter actually go to print out the check.  Overall we spent 30 minutes and had to prompt three times in order to pay and leave.\\n\\nI don't know what was going on at this place this evening.  I assume this isn't normal based on the other glowing reviews.  But I personally will not be returning based on this experience.\\n\\nThe reason why this review is so long and detailed is because we are expecting a defensive reply based on the reply to the other negative review.  For the record, we were a party of two, who came in several hours before closing (after attempting to make a reservation), on a slow time of the night, with a simple order (which was not fulfilled correctly).  I've attempted to be fair, but I do feel that a negative review in this case is well justified.\\n\\nI'm actually quite disappointed that I didn't find a place worthy of the other reviews.  The location is near my home, and I happen to like this genre of food.  But the purpose of this review isn't to get a free meal or whatever from the manager.

The Seafood Casserole was tastylish, with hints of the coconut milk that make it rich without overwhelming the dish overall.  The fried yucca is tasty, and comes with or without slices of linguica (although it is a little dry on the outside... the dipping sauce may balance that, I didn't have any), and the fried plantains are of the sticky, sweet, yummy variety.

I will definitely be back.\\n   My friend had the bologna sandwich, which was quite large and he seemed to enjoy it.\\n\\nThe Good:\\nBarrel aged Old Rasputin, insanely good. I like Old Rasputin, but I LOVED the barrel aged version. It was a bit pricey at $16 but worth every cent.\\n   The pretzels, firm and crusty on the outside, soft on the inside, and they weren't overly coated with salt, which was nice.\\n   House made mustard, nice and spicy. My friend, who apparently is only familiar with the processed and dyed grocery store variety was suspicious of it's brownish, grainy appearance and was reluctant to try it but once he did he couldn't get enough.\\n   Beer Cheese, had a nice, sharp bite and went well with the pretzel. I don't get the complaints about bland flavor unless you try it after a few beers and your sense of taste has been deadened by the alcohol.\\n   The tiger claw (their version of a bear claw) was surprising. In their description it says, \\"spiced pecan filling\\", I didn't really take the \\"spiced\\" part seriously but it did have a nice, muted, bite to it that came as a pleasant surprise.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\nI have nothing to say here but the service did narrowly escape being placed here.\\n\\nThe Indifferent:\\nThe Jerky was more peppery than I had expected, which is a good thing. I like jerky but I'm not a huge fan but this was pretty good and was a nice snack while I sipped on my beer.\\n   The service wasn't quite bad, once or twice we had to actively get the waiters attention when we wanted something or he'd start walking away before we had finished with our requests."},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I remember when this location housed a crappy local bar that reeked of broken dreams and Bud Light.

They have a daily special menu that is constantly changing from what I understand!  I am a sucker for lamb entrees.  I had The Lamb Chops in a Balsamic Honey/Cherry Reduction.  The Lamb was cooked to perfection.  It came with asparagus that had been drizzled in a buttery oily and pepper and garlic.  It was to die for.  The meal also came with a potato croquet that was cooked to a perfect golden brown.  I am going back soon.  Next time I want to go with like 4 other people and order 4 different entrees and have them serve it to us family style.  I want to try the Ravioli's, Meatballs, Chicken Parm and The Veal.

Checked out the menu and Yelp ahead of time to get an idea on the dishes. Thanks fellow yelpers! We made a reservations but was seated at a table right at the front door - not cool. The service was slow as the restaurant was busy. Our waitress was training another waitress at the same time, so it was distracting. Another waiter was filling up water glasses as well. Lots of activity but no food. \\n\\nSmall plates: deviled eggs (although small with three pieces/plates, so we had to order 2 for party of 4). The yolk was creamy and the combo of the fish eggs, pickled shallots and cured ham was good. The hog and hooch biscuit was good as well, but the pork belly may have been just a little overcooked. Both dishes would order again. \\n\\nLarge plates: shrimp and grits was the best dish overall. The chicken and waffle was okay- sad that it didn't come by country gravy like they do in the South. The chicken was nicely fried and surprisingly the white breast meat wasn't overcooked and dry. The waffle was fluffy but didn't taste much of the Cheddar or chives. While the Mac and cheese and cornbread were fabulous (sides to the ribs plate), the ribs were not. Similar to another review, the ribs were cold. It was very odd to eat a cold dish expecting it to be at least warm. The flavor wasn't to die for, but the cornbread was one of the best. Soft and buttery, too bad it was only a small piece. \\n\\nUpdated for the homemade pies- visited twice for dessert specifically. Tried buttermilk, peach, and mud pie. Just okay- while the filings were good, the crust is very hard. Maybe it's because they are from the fridge. Think I'm over it \\n\\nCocktails: both the peach daisy and the one with raspberry mint were strong and fruity.

We looked at a number of blogs and magazine sites and kept finding Cask & Larder being named as a must-visit, so we made our way out on Tuesday evening.\\n\\nInitially, we were a little thrown off as the parking lot is right after a fork in the road and train crossing, so it was confusing as to where to turn; we had to go to the next parking lot and circle back. \\n\\nOnce we got inside, everything was great. We sat on the bar side in a very comfortable booth and were quickly attended to by the waitstaff. We ordered waters, though I was given a sample of the Hoppy Coffee Cask (two thumbs up). We ordered the kale salad and the farro pappardelle to share. The kale salad was HUGE. We each had two plate-fulls with some leftover, commenting after each bite how good it was. Once we got to the bottom, we discovered an avocado puree that we had initially missed (even though I thought we did a good job mixing it up). It's a wonder we didn't actually lick the bowl clean.\\n\\nHad we known how big the salad was, we probably wouldn't have ordered the entree as well, but I do not regret that decision at all. This dish again was easily enough to split between us, with what appeared to be handmade pasta, a generous portion of greens, and fish so good it just about melted in your mouth.\\n\\nIn our food stupor, we decided we did not have room for dessert, although we did take a look at the dessert menu. What caught my eye was the fernet & rootbeer cocktail, with absinthe whipped cream. I mentioned to the waitress how I wish I had room for it, and she asked the bartender if they could give me a small sample. Sadly, they did not have absinthe, so I was not able to - but she said that would restock before the end of the week...\\n\\nWhich brings me to our second visit in 5 days. We were so enamored with the kale salad that we made our way back to C&L on Friday night as well. Reservations were packed so we didn't get a table until 9:15, and we knew better than to order two big dishes. We again ordered the kale salad and this time paired it with the crispy corn: four 1/2 ears of corn, covered in bbq sauce, cornbread crumbs, and so much butter that Paula Deen may have been the chef. Beyond delicious. After chowing down, we ordered dessert. My sister ordered the chocolate mousse bar, which was good but didn't blow her away (she ate all of the caramel, wished there was more ice cream, and said the cookie was decent). I ordered the fernet & rootbeer cocktail, after asking twice if they had the whipped cream available (first when we got there and again right as I ordered). Imagine my surprise when I'm delivered my drinks, sans whipped cream. After questioning the waiter, we were told they were out of the whipped cream. I, sadly, turned down the drink, but was pleased a few minutes later when our waiter triumphantly explained that the bartender could make enough whipped cream for my drink. Phew! It was delivered a few minutes later and was exactly what I had hoped for. I need to figure out how to make that myself, since I live about 1200 miles away. \\n\\nAnyway.. the moral of this story is that Cask & Larder is everything the magazines and reviews says it is; definitely worth seeking out if you are in the area, even if only for a few days."},{"name":"E J Cabot's","address":"282 Cabot St","city":"Beverly","stars":"3.5","text":"We keep coming back for the mussels, which are superb.

Right out of the gate, she had told us all of the information we needed to know, without dragging on about promotions, or other filler. In fact, I flat out told her after the spiel(it lasted about 2 minutes) that it was the best opening lines I have ever heard from a server! \\n     After ordering house margaritas(my standby judgement of any Mexican restaurant) we looked at the menu. If I'm honest, it wasn't too innovative or inspired. However, the core of most great Mexican lies in it's simplicity, so I wasn't too worried. We were told about how everything including the tortillas and sauces were made fresh, in house, which is always a plus in my book. I ended up with a chimi-chuy(cute!) and my girl got an avocado enchilada. It's a bit of a regret, since what my girl had was clearly more planned out than my dish, but you live and learn. That is to say by no means was my meal not incredibly flavorful, and hearty. Those sauces I mentioned were also incredible, and definitely fresh.

Like smart 20-something childless lassies we are, we went on Halloween/trick-or-treat night. Woo hooo not crowded! We had walked in here once before after dinner elsewhere and were overwhelmed by how crowded it was. The wine tasting, per person, is $12 for 5 pours which I would guess ended up being like 1 1/2 glasses. So it's not a total rip off. We ended up buying a bottle of one of the wines as they offered special pricing. I mean $7.99 for a BOTTLE? YES PLEASE. They will re-cork it for you if you don't finish, but we aren't amateurs so of course we finished it. There is a representative from the wine place who does your pours and gives you the education scoop on what you're drinking. My friend and I were more interested in getting our drink on and catching up w/ one other than learning about each wine we guzzled down, but thankfully the wine lady did a good job and wasn't too intrusive or lingering. \\n\\nAs for food, we split the calamari, shrimp, zucchini appetizer. Can't really screw up anything that's being deep fried but not sure the amount that they give you warrants $10. We also split the chicken pizza w/ some fancy sounding cheese.

The entrees are where the big bucks are at, if that's what you're coming here for. \\n\\nIf I return again on a Monday night, I am going to see if I can just buy a specially priced bottle of wine off of the wine tasting menu without purchasing the $12 wine tasting.

Outdoor seating is available, but we took a seat inside by the window-- not a spectacular view as there is construction right across the street, but the setting was okay.  Their decor is simple, but the place itself is very small and cramped inside compared to your typical restaurant.\\n\\nWe ordered the Caesar salad, grilled asparagus with prosciutto, tagliatelle verdi alla bolognese, and grilled Atlantic salmon pasta.  The salad was pretty standard.  The asparagus was good overall, it came out a little colder than I'd like it, but the presentation and taste was spot on.  As for our pasta, there was nothing really good about it.  My grilled salmon pasta was very lacking presentation-wise, and it didn't have a distinct taste for me-- just thought it was under-whelmingly bland.  The tagliatelle was okay, but the description sounded way better than the actual thing.  Anyways, it was just mediocre food, and I've had better pasta elsewhere in Atlanta.  For a place that specializes in pasta, it sure did not seem like it.\\n\\nService was good and very attentive.  The staff work together to take care of their customers, which was nice.\\n\\nMaybe we just didn't order the right entrees, but everything on their menu should be good considering their reputation.  I'm not a big fan of chicken, and the night that I came, I wanted some red meat and pasta, sadly there's not many options for that."},{"name":"Maurizios","address":"364 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I have one, one small gripe about Maurizio's: In the window is a really tacky sign about the bathroom being for patrons only (not how it's worded).

We were seated down stairs, which is slightly cramped, but interestingly didn't get too loud. For salad we had the Insalata alla Cesare (Cesar salad), the dressing was perfect, not too strong, the anchovies were amazing, not oily or over salted, the whole lettuce leaves were crisp and fresh.\\n\\nAppetizer was the Involtini di Melanzane (eggplant).... Oh.. My... God. Could have just eaten that and been happy! One of my party, someone who said he hates eggplant, nearly ordered another as his main course. We were practically fighting over who would lick the plate (no one did, but we were all tempted).\\n\\nWe all ordered a dish, and we all ended up sharing and loving everything we tried for main courses; Malloreddus alla Campidanese, Linguine al Frutti di Mare, Pollo al Marsala, Ravioli di Prosciutto e Fichi. I genuinely can not say which I enjoyed more, though I was quite fond of the Campidanese and the ravioli. \\n\\nPersonally I would suggest, if you're going in the evening, make reservations as Maurizio's is rather small. Prices are on par for the area, and of course this is the North End, so parking can be interesting. There is another, larger and generally packed restaurant just a block away with equally good food. Personally I would suggest Maurizio's over the competition, primarily due to the smaller crowds, actually being able to hear yourself and the people you're with. \\n\\nI can be very, very harsh on restaurants, particularly anywhere the main course is over $20 a plate.

The coffee, usually a highlight in Portland restaurants, was watery and tasted like it had been sitting around a while; at three dollars you'd expect a little more care. No care seemed to go into timing the food to come out together, this was explained away as family style dining, but that isn't what that term means, and even if it was it wouldn't apply to biscuit sandwich as it isn't really a traditionally shared item. I ordered the Frittata which wasn't at all fluffy seemed to have been over cooked. It also featured a ball of fired cheese, which I bet would have been good smeared on top, but I mistook it for a hush puppy and left if for the end.

Rather it is a reflection of the poor customer service offered by the owners of this establishment. On two separate occasions my wife and I have been double charged and in both cases it is not been resolved. \\n\\nThe first time was an honest mistake with a pre-ordered birthday cake, they decorated the wrong base cake. Apologized and offered a new cake in its place the next day.  I believe I was accidentally charged the second time for the replacement cake.  But the real issue was in the resolution process in which this store shows up as an \\"Aloha\\" store 97006 on my credit card.  I showed them the double charge on my credit card statement. The owners argued with me and told me \\"no, this is Beaverton.\\"  The husband was supposed to contact the bank to resolve and never followed through. Unfortunately so much time passed that I couldn't even dispute the charge. \\n\\nRecently, my wife treated herself to an ice cream. The credit card reader seamed to fail, the other transaction was supposedly voided, and she was asked to re-swipe and chose to use a different card in case it the magstrip was faulty.   It turns out she was charged on both credit cards.  Again, and honest mistake and only $5.49. But when she sought resolution with the store.  All my wife received was pushback and denial. \\n\\nBaskin Robbins ice cream is classic and family friendly, however, the owners of this store (and one other) are tarnishing the brand they bought into.  I wish there was a corporate liaison who would intervene.  I'm not telling them how to run their business, but they need to adjust their focus on customer satisfaction. \\n\\nCase in point we have avoided this particular location because of the bad experience and have driven further to get ice cream or order a cake."},{"name":"Crooked Bayou","address":"50 E Central Blvd, Ste D","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Crooked Bayou is a staple in downtown Orlando.

The jerk chicken from this place was delicious.\\n\\nAfter trying a piece of her chicken I knew I had to go check this place out. I told my boyfriend about it as he also loves jerk chicken. I must say the uniqueness of the building and how vibrant it looks on the outside is a breath of fresh air in the middle of Dudley. We walked into the restaurant and was instantly greeted by the man behind the counter. As soon as I looked at the menu I knew exactly what I wanted - the jerk chicken grilled cheese sandwich- well isn't this a unique spin on grilled cheese and the star of the sandwich Jerk chicken. \\nMy boyfriend ordered the jerk chicken plate with Mac and cheese and brown rice. As he said his order I also decided to order a jerk chicken plate in addition to my sandwich. My plate had brown rice and collard greens. \\n\\nAs we waited for our order we sat and listened to the live jazz music and to Jeremy the cafe manager talk about the mission of the Haley House and what they are all about. I just continued to fall in love with this place more and more. \\n\\nWe got our food and headed back to the car.  My boyfriend asked for a bite of my sandwich. As he took the bite and chewed a few times the expression on his face said it all- I was in for a TREAT. I took a bite next and was in love. The sandwich was perfect in every way. Warm, crispy, the right amount of spice and a little sweet. We devoured the sandwich and the delicious cabbage slaw that came on the side.

Yes | No"},{"name":"Dave & Buster's","address":"2215 D And B Dr SE","city":"Marietta","stars":"2.5","text":"TLDR: Quite possibly the worst customer experience I've ever had, at any business, of any type, in any city, at any time. Flee! Save yourself!\\nAs I told the server manager, \\"This is exactly what Yelp is for!\\"\\n\\nThe rest of the story:\\nWe went with high expectations, since I've visited here before, several years ago, and it was great back then. It would've been my daughter's first visit to a Dave and Buster's ever. She was very excited as was I.\\n\\nThe place was very busy, as is the norm for a D&B. The line inside to get a power card was wrapped around the lobby. An employee carrying a walkie-talkie comes out and makes his way down the line, and we see people peeling off and heading inside. Then we found out why. As he approached he told us, \\"Hi, if you are also dining with us tonight, you don't have to stand in line here. You can go ahead and seat yourselves and your server can get your player card for you.\\" So we did what several other people did... We thanked him, left the line and went inside.\\nAwesome. So far, so good, and we're still happy campers at this point. \\nWe're still eager to grab a bite to eat, and have a fun night of games.\\n\\nThings went sideways almost immediately. The first location we spotted, we go to sit down and are told, \\"Sorry, this is a private party\\" so we continue looking. The next area was where several others were starting to seat themselves, so we figured this was a safe spot. Nope. We couldn't have been more wrong! In seconds a young lady came around to each of us, in turn, letting us know that we couldn't sit there, either.\\n\\nNo explanation was offered whatsoever. You just can't sit here.\\nAt this point, the whole thing seems a bit ridiculous to me, and I asked to see a manager. She seems exasperated but goes to get one. Manager shows up and the first words out of his mouth are, \\"What's the problem? You can't sit here.\\" I mention that they have an employee up front directing people to go seat themselves, and he had just told 20-30 people the same thing. Where should we sit? Offering zero apologies whatsoever, he just fires back with, \\"We have a 30-minute wait for people to be seated here, and you need to go.\\" No suggestion on how I might get on that waiting list myself. (I'm used to wait lists. Not a big deal.) When I repeated that he had an employee out front, telling people to seat themselves, he rattles off a couple sections where one might seat themselves, but only the 'bar area' rang a bell. Perhaps if I worked there it might have made sense. But he didn't give me time to ask for clarity.\\nHe finally pops off that he will have a conversation with that employee out front... but that we still need to get up and leave. Period.\\n\\nNot a single word of apology was uttered. Not a single direction on how to properly get seated, just demands that we get up and leave. This guy exhibited zero customer service skills, and zero care, for the business itself, imo. I am not sure how this person is still a manager. Anywhere.\\nI finally say, \\"Fine, this is exactly what Yelp is for\\" and we leave.\\n\\nI purposely made myself wait a week before posting, thinking that I would calm down a bit and be able to see the other side somehow.\\nSorry, but I can't. It still makes zero sense at all.\\n\\nThere was a silver lining. While I probably won't show up to this D&B again, unless I hear it's under new management, we did end up at an awesome restaurant after we left. It's a lovely place where they care very much about their customers, and their food was nothing short of amazing. I'll be leaving a much different review for them soon. :)\\n\\nThis place?

The ice cream is good to.\\n\\nThere are two approaches to tackling Salt & Straw . . .  1) the ice creams that you just know are going to be great variations on the flavors you are familiar with or 2) the ones that challenge what you think you know about ice cream.\\n\\nMy first time there I went with the first route, a molasses and ginger ice cream with ginger cookies. It was really good. Creamy, spicy, sweet with just enough cookie to add interest and texture. \\n\\nThe next visit was smoked cherries and bone-marrow. Because really good ice cream isn't rich enough as it is, the bone-marrow gave it an over the top mouth-feel and unctuousness. The cherries were lightly smoked, but still had a little acidity with them. A little more smoke would have been nice. More than one small scoop of this, and you'd need one of PokPok's vinegar sodas -- which they sell on site -- to wash it down.\\n\\nBecause we had gift certificates for a couple of pints we walked out with some sourdough olive oil and chocolate and a pint of strawberry balsamic black pepper. \\n\\nI have decided that anytime I make fruit ice cream at home I'm adding a balsamic swirl and some crushed black pepper.\\n\\nThe sour dough olive oil might actually end up being my favorite. I would say it's a challenging ice cream though. Imagine the tanginess of a very tangy frozen yogurt with the grassiness of a good olive oil, broken up with chocolate chunks.

We ordered the mushroom pizza (very greasy and sticky from the honey with a giant piece of fried gouda laid on top of it... the gouda was awesome but misplaced) and the blackened cod sandwich which was ok.  The pizza and the fries desperately needed some seasoning and there was no salt and pepper on the bar so we had to wait until the bartender made his way back to us.

We did end up waiting and eventually found a place at the bar where we ordered drinks ($7.50-$10/drink), and got the calamari appetizer (which was pretty good).  We finally got seated and ordered our food (yes, after the hour wait).  I chose to get a salad and the steak, and my friends each got a side with their food.

The hot dog (more like a sausage because it was so big and thick) was extremely savory and flavorful without feeling sickeningly greasy and fat. The bread it's served on--like a softer baguette--was a good pairing. I didn't think much of the sweet sauerkraut (I prefer sauerkraut sour), but the rosemary chips were interesting. The boy loved them and scarfed them down so quickly, he almost finished them without realizing there were no more left in the bag. Very sheepishly, he gave me the last 2 to try.\\n\\nI got the Slow Roasted Pork Belly with white beans and mustard greens. A very simply dish but rich and delicious. The broth was heavenly and reminded me a little of my mom's cooking. The pork belly was perfectly roasted: crisp on the top, tender and fatty on the bottom. The greens and beans were a perfect non-salty side to complement it. Highly, highly recommend this dish.\\n\\nI also loved the baguettes and housemade Irish sour bread with butter topped with Fleur de Sel that they served at the beginning. Very yummy!

No need for that here! \\nThe meatballs were so savory and warm; I wish I could put that on my pasta for dinner once a week! \\nFor the main we shared a 14 ounce beef coulotte, it came with a side of something similar to hollandaise. The beef flavor was wonderful, and cooked a gorgeous medium rare. It wasn't as tender as I was hoping but I guess that's just the way that cut is. We also had a side of parmesan & salumi risotto, OMGGGGGGG, it's just a genius idea to put those two ingredients together! YUM! \\nWhen the dessert menu came, I contemplated ordering every single cheese on the menu (come on who doesn't love cheese for dessert?), but we restrained ourselves by just splitting an apple tart.

So 1.5 overall.\\n\\nI passed Roxy Burger a bunch of times on my way into the City Center and considering the name, I thought this would be more of a burger shack than a bar (especially since the Roxy is next door and that's where you go for the nightlife). Not the case. I wanted to grab a quick burger before a night out, so didn't want to start drinking at dinner. Pretty much everyone else was drinking, and not even eating, and when we asked for water instead of beer I sensed judgement and irritation from the waiter. On top of all of this, we sat and waited for 30 minutes for our food to come out. That is a little ridiculous considering most pubs can put out food, especially popular items, in 10 minutes or less. \\n\\nSince the food took so long to get out of the kitchen, and since this place is called Roxy BURGER I was hoping that 30 minute wait was going to gain me an amazing burger. Unfortunately, I was not impressed with the burgers at all. I am a bit of a buffalo burger enthusiast so whenever I have the opportunity I will order it. DO NOT get it here. I was extremely disappointed to see that all the burgers look like they were frozen patties as opposed to fresh meat, and the buffalo patty tasted like processed gunk. It was also very measly compared to the beef patty and was really dry and overcooked, it barely even tasted like meat. My boyfriend got the Canadian Roxy (signature burger with bacon and cheddar added), and it was much less disappointing even though the patty was still from frozen and pretty dry compared to regular burger standards. On the plus side, the fries were pretty good and tasted fresh.\\n\\nOn top of all of these disappointments, the bill came out to $30 just for two burgers. Definitely way over-priced. I have a feeling that Roxy Burger somehow boasts their reputation based on reviews from people who stumble in for 3am drunk food and can't tell the difference."},{"name":"Uno Pizzeria & Grill","address":"12553 State Rd, Ste 535","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"They have a \\"Gluten-free cheeseburger\\", yet their cheese is not Gluten-free.

Its very easy to get to, right off 93 and Morrissy Blvd with plenty of parking. The building has a very nice appeal to it and the water garden area by the entrance is beautiful.

The restaurant was completely empty, not one person was seated at any of the tables. I guess all reservations? I wasn't sure, but we decided to sit at the bar. The bartender Brian was frankly a mess, the guy was busy chatting with a few regulars seated in the corner about some new girl he met and really could careless about me or my friend. We got up to get food from the buffet, the buffet had an excellent selection of breakfast classics, eggs Benedict, french toast, waffles, plus a decent lunch selection and a very nice looking salad bar. Most of the food was OK....nothing spectacular but OK. The worst part of this meal was dealing with this bartender, who just was a mess. When I would ask for a refill of water he would stick his fingers into the glass to pick it up then would put my dirty glass back into the ice bucket to fill it with ice again and refill with water....I stopped drinking the water at that point.

I typically only write reviews of places I hate or that rub me the wrong way on yelp as a form of venting I suppose, but my love for this place is such that I must share it with the world (or yelp people I guess).\\nI have been going to Cantina for several years now. I do a radio show and various film projects across the street at SCATV and this place is sort of a haunt for some of us at the studio. It might be the Boston area's biggest sleeper bar. You will walk by a packed Brass Union, Indo, and Bronwyn, all charging $7 for a Harpoon, and into the Cantina where there is a seat at the bar waiting for you, and unlike most Mexican food establishments, an array of fine craft beers on tap. Here's the kicker: they sell pitchers....for $15. Please find me another establishment within 20 miles where I can get a PITCHER of Clown Shoes, or Dogfish Head or Jack's Abby for $15. You can't. Those suckers at Bronwyn paying $7 for a can of craft beer and a $8 Brat must have money to burn. Cantina has one of the best selections of Tequila I have seen around town as well. I am not a tequila guy but THATS OKAY because they have a great selection of whiskey there too for a guy like me, even some Mexican Whiskey, which I had never tried before but is not bad at all, especially on ice.\\nOkay, the food. I will admit that I understand the mixed reviews here because I have had some mess-ups with their food in the past, but there was a period of some rough transition with staff and such during those times. In the last year or maybe two the place has really hit its stride for me. I have tried a little bit of everything from their menu but my consistent fallback has been their a la carte tacos. $2.50 each for your choice mix and match if you want. The tacos are delicious and the closest I have come in Boston to the \\"real\\" tacos I experienced in southern Cali so many times. This is a family run establishment, the food can vary from cook to cook sometimes. The chips and Salsa most people here laud are home-made. They make the chips, and they make the salsa, every day. What I like about this is the salsa is never the same. Sometimes it is really spicy, other times mild, but always fresh and delicious! This Xmas I had them cater (yeah they cater too) a lunch at my office (we get lunch once a week during the holidays in lieu of an office party) and everyone in the office loved it. For a couple people it was their favorite holiday lunch, and guess what? It was the cheapest of the 4 and Cantina HOOKED IT UP. I ate tacos for days after with the leftovers.\\nThey have an entertainment license and occasionally you will catch a musician or band or DJ there. I once saw a wedding reception happening there!\\nOn top of all this the staff is REALLY nice, polite, and helpful. The Roberts (Sr and Jr) are usually there when I go and always have a good story to tell or a new drink to try. They live in Somerville, and their business is in Somerville. They take pride in their work. Whenever there is something going on in Union Square (Honk, Fluff festival, Xmas) they are participating, having fun and handing out free samples or Mexican hot chocolate or what-have-you. I am happy to support a local, family business and not a bar/restaurant owned by someone with 5-6 other such properties around the state/city. Give them a shot.

Fish ball, lamb and pork belly skewers...tiny portions, empty flavors and very disappointing. The lamb actually tasted bad, not just not good, but bad...I've had lamb in many countries around the globe, have cooked my share, and savored it all across the USA...this was approaching nasty. The fish balls were pretty pointless...only the pork belly came close, mainly because the accompanying sauce finally offered some real flavor. The  nine buck pork leg dish was, in my opinion, a rip off, maybe 2-3 ounces of pork shreds, an ounce of greens, and a sorry boiled egg that had clearly not bathed in aforementioned sauce. I remember a place in the East Bay of SF that offered this dish for about seven bucks, was easily a half pound of pork, served in a solid chunk, in some sauce, with the egg, and a nice heap of greens. And, it actually tasted great. The Ping version was, again, devoid of much flavor, though the pork seemed to be cooked correctly with nice hunks of gelatinous skin...but all pretty bland. (I realize this is a subtle dish, really, but they somehow managed to achieve a strike out regardless.)  My pal shared my views and we both decided Ping is not worth another visit, leaving plenty of room for the butt-kissers and groupies. Sorry to be so harsh, but a place that has such a hallowed pedigree (at least according to some) sets a pretty high bar, and they just don't meet it, and it leaves me puzzled how so many can heap so much praise on such so-so food."},{"name":"Cask & Larder","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Great menu and excellent, knowledgeable servers.

Even getting there is cool. You see a sign for women's clothes before anything, and are slightly puzzled till you see the Swift's sign. Then you open the door and see the stairs, like something out of a Dashiell Hammet story. At the top you are greeted by two beautiful young women and you start to wonder if you haven't wandered into a private 'club'. The ambience is described as 'Steam Punk meets Jules Verne' and that's a good description. Another would be Philip Marlowe's favorite spot for a nightcap after finding the Maltese Falcon. If he lived in the Nautilus\\n\\nWe went early to try the bar and I recommend doing that. Austin is blessed with a good selection of bars that make unusual drinks that taste great, and you can add another great one to that list. The bar itself is substantial, with an end cut wood top,  and is very nice for pre dinner drinks, or after dinner drinks for that matter. I know you are expecting me to name the drinks and what they tasted like. They had cool names and they tasted fantastic. You're welcome. \\n\\nThe other reviewers that compared Swifts to Barley Swine have a good point. They serve small plates, as does BS. The dishes are beautifully plated and taste fabulous, much like BS, and the servers are extremely knowledgeable about the ingredients and the preparation as well. But to me the difference is that Barley Swine makes their meals events, and Swifts makes them part of the evening, like another guest at the party. Both are wonderful. I personally prefer Swifts. I love the lively interplay between the servers and the diners, and the energy of the place. There are booths on the sides and two tops as well, with the middle given over to community high top tables.

I have driven past this location for the past few months while it was being built. It is an interesting design on the inside and the walls are like mulitcolored lights on the inside. I read about it in a magazine and saw they served food.  I also saw Atlanta Hawk Zaza Pachulia was a partner.  The dinner menu is limited.   Sides are priced separately. The table next to me ordered the burgers ($8-10) and they were thick but very small. I read about the white chocolate peach milkshake (two of my favorite flavors mixed together) and ordered that.  It arrived at my table and this milk, had no shake.  It was as thick as oatmeal.  I could not drink it through the straw and with the spoon; it tasted like marshmallows blended with vanilla flavor.  There were no peaches or peach pieces in the milkshake.  I ordered the mussels with fries. The mussels were cold and bland. The fries were too brown with no seasoning, not even salt.  The waitress was extremely slow, it took over 20 minutes for the food to come to the table and the fries were only warm, not hot.  I told the waitress and she says \\"I do not think the mussels are supposed to be hot.\\"  Huh?  She was wearing booty shorts and a BBB tank and it does not matter how cute and casual the outfit is, it does not excuse poor service! She said the kitchen was backed up. The manager comes over to the table and I told him the shake was good but did not taste like peaches and was way too thick to drink through the straw.  He said it contained peach nectar.  I asked him if there was any ice cream in it, he did not seem sure.  Anyway, the one cocktail I drank was mediocre at best and for $9.00 it was not worth the price.  I sent back the milkshake and ordered the cheesecake. The consistency like a souffl√© and the \\"sorbet\\" was chipped ice flavored with syrup that was melting in the humidity of the summer Atlanta night.  The upstairs outdoor area consists of a Red Bull stand and a smoking area with no tables or chairs.  The restrooms are unisex (very big and nice paper towels) and a man who stumbled out of the handicapped stall informed me the lock does not work.  Also, there is a door walking on East Paces Ferry that I opened thinking it was an entrance but is not.  There was a long table with chair wedged against the door and when I opened there was a group of people sitting there. This might be a place to stop and get drinks one night if you want to watch the majority of people in the bar area consume one too many and while leaving almost vomiting in the bushes outside the patio area. Otherwise, I would not return, at least not on a Saturday night. I may drink and dance on Saturday evenings, but not dine, especially after 7pm.

But I'd rather tell you about the dessert: a perfect sphere of caramel ice cream (less salty than some of the trendy versions out there) with caramelized banana, a slump of heavy cream, and a chatter of peanuts. Simple, just like the rest of our meal. They offer freshly brewed Stumptown french-press as well. After six courses, the dessert could have lost-out but Beast made it the highlight of an otherwise decadent, made-especially-for you feast. \\n\\nWhile other raved, I didn't care for the crimson beet soup, which reacted oddly to the drizzles of cr√®me fraiche. I promptly threw myself into the baguettes and salted butter. While the fois-gras bon bon was super good, I preferred the pungent housemade salumi and the chicken pate with maple candied bacon. Served on a buttery cracker, it was comfort food at its richest. \\n\\nFor the main course, Beast served a new york steak (seemed like 6 ounces of meat) over chilled asparagus with a dollop of b√©arnaise, sliced potatoes saut√©ed in duck fat, and a phenomenal demi glace sauce.  The presentation was so elegant and the flavors stood out, each to his own. (We were told that Naomi, the chef, had burned her hadn the night before making this recipe. Our Naomi-less experience was still great.)\\n\\nFourth course was a salad of local greens with a ramp and ricotta toast. The wild greens packed a powerful punch and the toast highlighted the ramps fresh, springy flavor. It was the perfect prelude to the cheese plate, three cheeses (one goat and two sheeps) with a crumbly anise salt shortbread. The highlight though was the stonefruit poached in champagne. Mmm. \\n \\nSome folks have complained about the price. From my perspective, six courses for $52 (before alcohol) is impossible to beat. Have a drink before you go, skip the wine pairings, and get out of there for about $8 a course.

The sandwich is a Chick-fil-a copy cat with a buttered toasted bun, and pickles. You can get their special sauce as a side wich is similar to Zak sauce. I felt the sandwich was on par with Chick-fil-a or slightly worse. I do like that CFA uses peanut oil which gives it a unique taste. The mac and cheese was a real bummer. The cheese was more like the mystery cheese you get at an airmark ballpark. Very soup like. Tasted a lot like KFC mac and cheese. I would give it another shot, but my initial thought is I would rather have zaxbys or CFA if they were at the same price point, and this is double the cost.

The spread is very basic: lamb, chicken, pork, beef, and some vegetables and two different kinds of noodles. Thanks to the other reviews for how to properly prepare your bowl. Put the light stuff first- vegetables then the meats, so you can fit more! There's an assortment of different kinds of sauces even giving you a chart that shows what sauces will give you a Taiwanese or Singaporean type of flavor to your bowl. We literally took AYCE to another level by sitting there from 1:30-5:30 4 hours! I think because of us they are going to put a 2 hour limit for each customer like the Japanese AYCE places. I've never been at a restaurant that long except for a wedding reception. I can't believe we were at the restaurant  that long. We just had such a great time catching up and sharing ideas. What's cool was the waitress and owner didn't push us to leave. The AYCE comes with a miso soup which I heard didn't taste all that great and salad which looks quite weak for a salad.

I did like the Southern-influenced hipster vibe, with the plaid shirts on all the staff, wooden industrial chic decor, and the handwriting on the blue-lined-paper notebook that is the drink menu.\\n\\nThe service is friendly and attentive in some ways (no need to ask for more water) but seemed a bit disorganized. We had someone visit and ask if we had questions about the drink menu, and then leave without taking any orders, leaving us confused if he thought we didn't want anything because we had no questions. We had to ask for silverware after food arrived, and one of the side dishes was forgotten and arrived a bit late. Actually, the food took a long enough time that our server came by and said that the porkchop was holding up food for the table. We had ordered two sides and two main dishes, and I don't know why they didn't at least offer to send those out first as an appetizer course (which is what we would have wanted whether or not the food was taking a long time). We never got offered dessert, though looking at their web site I see that they have pie.\\n\\nPeach Daisy cocktail is reportedly very tasty. Food had some interesting flavors and excellent presentation, and was pretty good, though I think the inside of my chicken was a bit under-flavored and some parts of the pork chop dish were overwhelmingly smokey.\\n\\nSome things I think went awry because of my lack of familiarity with Southern cuisine. The Pimento Cheese Fritters sound good and were tasty fried goodness, but they have a weird texture on the inside, and I wouldn't order them again. But I think they are supposed to be that way. I ordered fried chicken and waffles, and again I think it's supposed to be that way, but I got chicken with all the bones and everything still in.

If you didn't bring food but want to eat, Stanley's Farmhouse Pizza is also on-site. \\n5. Check the website to see what beers are available. When you're there, be sure to go for the limited edition and guest beers first. \\n6. Do number four because those said beers actually do run out (started running out of some beers around 3 when I went). \\n7. Bring your dog. I would've if I had one. Everyone else who has a dog brought theirs. \\n8. Cost is $10. Cash and credit are accepted. \\n9. If a beer you want runs out, they'll let you double up on a specific beer sample if you've already had it. \\n\\nThis was my first experience with Jester King, and they churn out some top notch beers. Unfortunately, coming at 2:30 was late, so some selection was limited.  I did get to try five beers, finding that each one has distinct character.

My favorite had to be the Hibernal Dichotomous (sour ale). It was light, crisp, and slightly sweet. It's brewed with lavender, rosemary, spearment, and refermented with watermelon juice. How awesome does that sound? It tasted even better. Hands down - Jester King is my new favorite craft beer company.\\n\\nSpending the afternoon at Jester King Brewery was the highlight of my weekend visit to Austin.

No kids and can wait forever? I guess you can go there and eat their average overpriced food.\\n\\nUpdate: he had the nerve to lie about our situation. We didn't even talk to a girl. Never would. It was an older woman who was going around yelling others' names. And she was the one claiming to have told us. I had a 2-year-old sitting on my lap at a bar for over an hour. Clearly, they didn't jot down my wife's name correctly. The waitress at the bar also knew we were waiting and never bothered to check on our situation. I didn't get irate until the woman said we were wrong instead of just admitting it was a mistake and try to rectify it. What nerve!!!! Then the owner treats us like this on yelp.

I stopped in here on a Saturday at about 5pm and waited no more than 30 minutes. We walked down the street to a bar for a glass of wine while we waited for the hostess to call us when our table was ready. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is adorable. It's a tiny, boisterous Italian restaurant, packed to the gills but cozy and comfortable at the same time. It definitely has that old school neighborhood vibe, like something you would see in a movie.\\n\\nThe food is out of this world. Like I said, best Italian food in Boston! For an app, we ordered the rolled eggplant. It was AMAZING! They use smoked mozzarella in it and drizzle with fresh pesto, which gives such a beautiful, special flavor to an otherwise predictable dish. It's these little touches that make the food at Rino's stand out.\\nFor entrees I got the Lobster Rav - their claim to fame - and my friend got the Gnocchi. The Lobster Ravioli was perfect. Huge chucks of lobster in and around the raviolis, flavored with shallots and a divine tomato-sherry sauce. Absolutely a must-have dish. The gnocchi were pillowy and fresh, covered in a lush red sauce and heaps of cheese. A great, albeit simple, dish!\\n\\nWe didn't have enough room for dessert, unsurprisingly, but we did have some tea and espresso which were very good. We also enjoyed a bottle of Sangiovese during our meal, and I must say that the wine list is well curated and very fairly priced!\\n\\nOur server was great, very attentive and friendly and nice to chat with.\\n\\nI recommend this place without hesitation!"},{"name":"Tomahawk Barbeque","address":"1550 Philip Avenue","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Like star said its \\"Meh\\"..I ordered the roast beef dinner and my friends ordered the lasagna.

Historically I haven't been a fan of stuffed grape leaves, but I licked that part of the plate clean too.  Hummus is outstanding, and  the pita just welcomes anything you spread on it. Not taking a star away for this, but the place has a real industrial look to it (remember I said I'm not sure it's even past its soft opening) and the white walls just cry out for some wonderful Mediterranean scenic posters or perhaps works of some local artists.

My fears were confirmed.\\n\\nI had the calamari and my friend had a salad to start.  I thought the calamari was ok, but really no different (except for the small portion size) from take out Thai with bottled Thai chili sauce.  Definitely not worth it.  I had the chargrilled pork chop.  It came with macaroni and cheese and collard greens.  Again, a plate that I could get somewhere else done better for much cheaper.  The theme was basically high priced crappy southern food.  My friend liked his beef tenderloin.  I really wasn't impressed with the food, especially for the amount I paid.\\n\\nThe service was good.  The atmosphere is what I like to call frat-tastic.  Basically, most of the clientele was wearing cargo shorts, button up shirts or t-shirts, and flip flops.  It was a total bro convention.  If this describes your type of environment, go for it.  The bar area was packed, and everyone around there appeared to be enjoying their sushi dishes.

My girlfriend had the Gnocchi with prosciutto, onions and peas in a mascarpone sauce, and I had the Fusilli with sausage and broccoli rabe with garlic and hot pepper.

My first visit sometime last summer was a little disappointing. I ordered the Fried Tuna Steak with string beans on the side and my gf ordered the Crawfish Po'boy. The tuna was pretty good, but the string beans came loaded with bacon (not listed on the menu, but apparently something this is the way Southerners eat string beans) which I sent back and exchanged for fries and my gf really enjoyed the po'boy. Fast forward a couple months... we had forgotten about the place and thought we'd give it another go. And I'm glad we did.\\n\\nOn this second trip we found an all-new menu, with fewer selections, and more simple and fresh Cajun-influenced selections, and it looked like they also expanded the beer menu, too. We both really enjoyed the new offerings and have since tried almost everything on the menu! My favorites are the Crawfish Po'boy, the Fried Catfish, the Grilled Tuna Steak (which replaced the Fried Tuna Steak) and the cole slaw. For lunch, I recommend the all-you-can-eat catfish lunch with the jalapeno hush puppies and cole slaw. The slaw, by the way, is some of the best I've had in Austin. \\n\\nThe Saloon itself is pretty big with 2 large rooms and a large patio. The main room is sports-oriented, and has TV monitors at almost every table playing some sports game. If you don't like what's playing just ask someone to change the channel. There's also shuffleboard and a big bar. The second room, the Lift Party room, is a ski themed, like the name implies with a bar and lots of tables. \\n\\nThe patio is is my favorite part. It's chill and right on the creek with a view of the park and is split with an area for smokers and another area for non-smokers. There are even more TVs out on the patio playing more sports. And, unlike places in South Austin, the best part about the patio is that it is one of the few where you hang in peace and not worry about being accosted by someone's dog. The parking lot is small, and depending on the time of day parking can be rough. But there is an annex lot just a block away across Lamar.\\n\\nMost of the menu is under 10 bucks, and there is always good food and good drink specials. With its new, fresh menu, good beer selection and patio the Shoal Creek is a win."},{"name":"Swagat Indian Cuisine","address":"4325 SW 109th Ave","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"This is our favorite Indian restaurant in Beaverton.

I was at the Westin for a comedy show later that night at Laugh Boston next door, so I figured I would stop in at MJ O'Connors for a drink and some food.  \\n\\nFirst thing you'll notice is that this bar is huge compared to its sister location at the Park Plaza in the Back Bay.  The bar actually wraps around.  The next thing you'll notice, especially when it's busy, is that this place gets very loud very quickly.  Of course, there's practically always something going on at the BCEC or at the Westin, so there will always be people with expense accounts sloshing back drinks or ordering everything on the menu.  Keep your fingers crossed that they migrate to the back of the bar, or just be prepared to deal with it.\\n\\nAs it would turn out, when I came to visit, the place was totally packed.  However, since most people were just standing around, I wrestled my way to the front and scored a bar seat.  By the end of the night, it was like gold.  There were only two bartenders on staff and there were two large groups of people from the BCEC and an event at the Westin, so they were getting rocked.  I think what irked me the most is that the manager stood there and watched it all go down rather than stepping in to help his staff.  That's definitely a low-blow move. \\n\\nNow I'm not a classy girl at a bar like some may assume, so I ordered a Bud Lite draft.  Really, I wanted anything that was less complicated, quick, and easy.  The bartenders were nice and really apologetic to those around the bar for the longer wait times.  Now, one would assume that if you're a restaurant attached to a hotel and across the street from a mega convention center, you would look at the schedule of events closely to best assume how many staff you'll need?  The restaurant was filling up quickly, too.  The entire wait staff was getting rocked.\\n\\nI ordered the short rib tacos which were actually pretty good and certainly a filling appetizer.  To be expected, it took a little longer than I would have liked to come out.  The short ribs were cooked and seasoned well; plus, they didn't fall out of the actual soft taco shell.  No one wants a taco mess!  There was a weird carrot slow with an interesting sweet sauce on top, but overall, they were good.  I'll admit that I didn't have the highest of expectations.  \\n\\nI'd say it's a pretty solid place.  However, there were some weird patrons there that gave me the creeps.  One guy kept asking the bartender (female) if she poured his Guiness with the shamrock marking just for him as he kept winking.  Dude, it's a Thursday night.  Cool it.  The bartender was clearly weirded out, too.  There was another person that asked for onion soup with no onion.  Lastly, there was a party of four guys that came in and asked me to move while I was eating my meal  So, whatever rock some of these people have been under, it's calling them back just not soon enough.\\n\\nFriendly service.

I've been to 3-4 others and they don't compare. I will say the salad bar was more plentiful on the weekend but that is to be expected given lighter traffic during the week.\\n\\nOf course, no one goes there for the salad bar... the meats were very tender and full of flavor. They were able to accommodate the various requests by those at our table (from medium rare to medium well). There was a pretty large assortment of meats as well.

Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations, so it was a bit difficult to be seated since half the party showed up almost an hour late (better late than never, though!). We were among the first to arrive and went ahead and gave them a head count of 15-20. It actually wasn't too long until the tables were ready, but in order to be seated, we had to have at least 8 people present. At the time, we didn't, so we made the executive decision to give up our table and wait until they could get enough seating again later. It was a shame, because they actually held our table for about 40 minutes. If only people would just show up on time. The staff was extremely understanding, accommodating and kept us informed throughout the duration of our wait. 5-star service right there, folks.\\n\\nFast forward an hour later, and a few moments after the final guests arrived, our new seating arrangement was ready for us. Here's the rundown:\\n\\nService: Our two waiters were friendly and came by often enough for refills on everything but water, for some reason. Overall, not bad.\\n\\nDrinks: Frozen drinks were good; I'd recommend the Georgia Peach. Mixed drinks ($10) were okay but they were mostly ice and not enough of the drink itself. Just request for a little bit of ice and you'll be good to go. One buddy of mine ordered his usual Crown on the rocks ($12) and received some sort of mixed Crown concoction. The color was VERY off and it tasted extremely light. Skip on getting anything on the rocks, because they seem to cheat you of your spirits.\\n\\nFood: For the bigger foodies, we thought the dishes were very.. mediocre / subpar. For those who don't get out nearly as often, they thought it was great! Food portions were giant (that's their signature thing) except for the \\"combination\\" plates. So, keep that in mind when you order.. whether you have a big appetite or not. I got their crowd pleasing Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (according to the menu) but I found it to be very bland and the shrimp was overcooked and tough. If you come here, I'd suggest sticking to ordering small plates / appetizers and desserts only. I can't remember a time when I thought any entree was bomb[dot]com.\\n\\nFor small plates / appetizers, I recommend:\\n1. Vietnamese Tacos. It's not authentic, and it's pretty much a glorified, Americanized version of a banh mi. It was interesting, but pretty darn delicious nonetheless.\\n2. Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip. You can never go wrong with any sort of cheese dip to start off your dinner!\\n3. Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes. D and I got these on a whim when we were here before and it's probably my most favorite thing off their entire menu! However, much to my disappointment, it wasn't there or I overlooked it, in search of it ten times over.\\n\\nFor desserts, I recommend:\\n1. Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake. There are layers of red velvet cake and cheesecake, combined to create this piece of heaven. It was sweet, but not overly sweet. Simply put: it was perfect!\\n2. OREO Dream Extreme Cheesecake. This one is new, and an amped up version of their OREO cheesecake they offered before.\\n3. Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel. I thought getting something with fruit in it would make me feel less guilty about ordering a dessert. Nope! This one is actually the sweetest tasting of the three I suggested. Surprising, huh?\\n\\nThere is no free dessert for birthdays (darn!) but they do write a pretty message on your plate and come by to sing happy birthday. There were a LOT of birthdays celebrated yesterday.

I wouldn't say the food knocked my socks off, but it was still very tasty and different from typical cuisine. And even if adventure isn't your palate nothing was so distinctly different that you'd either love it or hate it. Definitely a place to go and can't say enough about the atmosphere.

Took me a while to get there since it's out of the way and I knew from other reviewers that it requires a commitment for the wait time. But a friend was visiting and staying near the airport so I used this as an excuse to finally give it a try. There were 4 of us and we put our name on the waiting list around 5:45pm on a Friday evening. We hung out across the street at their bar until we were called at 7pm. Not nearly as long of a wait as I was expecting. We ordered the calamari and stuffed peppers for our appetizer. The calamari was like any other calamari you'd get anywhere. The stuffed peppers though were very good, one of the best dishes of the night. For entrees, I had the lobster ravioli. Very tasty, but definitely heavy and a lot of food. Others had the pasta al forno and pasta bolgonese which were both also very good. Finally, one friend has the pollo saltinboca which was average at best. It did come with a \\"side\\" of pasta which was as much pasta as the pasta entrees. But it was just linguine with tomato sauce, so pretty boring. I would suggest sticking to the pasta entrees. All of the entrees were huge and we had enough for dinner the next day and still had leftovers after that. \\n\\nSo while it was overall a fun night with good food and wine, I'm giving Rino's 3 stars because it's hard to get to, the long wait times, it's on the expensive side for such standard Italian food (though the servings are enough for several meals), and perhaps besides the lobster ravioli, I didn't think the food was anything I haven't had before and couldn't get at any other standard Italian restaurant.

Unfortunately my \\"regular patron\\" experience was pretty mediocre.\\n\\nMy group of 5 arrived around 3 PM on a Saturday afternoon, thinking it would be a slower time. Wrong. The wait for one lane was 1-2 hours. Which is a big time range, to say the least, but they have a bar! So I guess we can hang.\\n\\nWe grab a table at the side bar area and let the waitress know we have a gift card. She informs of that there are limitations. Of course. It can't be used on alcohol, and you can't use just part of it, ensuring that we have to spend more than the amount to use it up completely. Well great.\\n\\nWe order an appetizer sampler as well as an order of tortilla chips with guacamole and mango salsa. The app plate was pretty good with personal faves being the southwest rolls and the mac n cheese bites. There were too many chips and not enough dips, so the tortilla place was just ok. The drinks were also fine - we got a variety of daiquiri/margarita concoctions - although very sweet and overpriced.\\n\\nAfter nearly 2 hours, our buzzer goes off for our lane. We grab shoes and head over to the far corner of the space (that I didn't even know existed) for cosmic bowling. It was dark and the music was good, which led to a fun environment and us forgetting that it was still afternoon. More drinks! \\n\\nBowling started off fine, but after a few rounds the machinery started malfunctioning and not counting all the pins that we knocked down. We alerted the staff, who looked into fixing it. For about thirty minutes. So we just hung out at the lane without bowling in the hopes that we'd be able to eventually continue with the accurate number of points (maybe that's why the wait for lanes is so long). Unfortunately, that didn't happen. They couldn't fix whatever bug was causing the inaccuracies, so we were forced to keep bowling and just not trust the score on the screen. We're all winners, right?\\n\\nLastly, the waitress we had at the lane was in a funk. We ordered a brownie sundae, and when the glorious creation arrived, it came with just one spoon. There are 5 of us. We asked for more spoons when we eventually found the waitress again, and she rolled her eyes, returning about 10 minutes later. She asked how many we wanted (again, there are 5 of us) and dumped about 8 on the table. Luckily the ice cream hadn't completely melted at this point.\\n\\nOverall, Kings is a good option for a fun group outing, but you have to set your expectations. I'd return only if I know I have hours to kill (you never know when you'll actually get to bowl. or if the lane will randomly poop out on you), and if I don't have to pay for it myself (work outing, anyone? or better yet.. another free Yelp event)."},{"name":"Turner's Seafood - Salem","address":"43 Church St","city":"Salem","stars":"4.5","text":"Good but very pricey.

The weird thing is that there were clearly tables available in the aforementioned more desirable front section so I immediately asked to be redirected back to that area.

Wow! I was in and out in under 10 minutes and even got all the dishes, spoons, and napkins I needed. The client was very impressed. I had to buy one of their branded scoops because I forgot my own...it was $20! Business expense. I later noticed there was water trapped inside...so I called thinking it was defective and they told me it's actually anti-freeze to keep the metal handle from sticking to you. Brilliant! This little Salt&Straw party has become a staple of mine with my clients now. Gotta use that scoop somehow!\\n\\n2. It was a lazy 11am on a Saturday. Strolling with my wife and we decided to stop in. No, 11am is not too early for ice cream when there's no line in front! So, we did what any reasonable parent without children in tow would do - snuck inside.

The dishes were fine...but I've had better dim sum in Boston. I understand that the sauces on the table add to the flavor of the dishes, but everything was otherwise pretty paste-y in consistency and lacking in flavor. My shrimp dumplings also had had shells in them, so the shrimp weren't cleaned all that well. Again, this is something I was aware was an issue...my friend often warns me of these kind of things when dining at a new restaurant in Chinatown; that said, it's not especially delightful to bite into a dumpling and get a chunk of shell. That's not something I've experienced in other dim sum locations around the city either.\\n\\nThe place is small, and there's very often a long and a 20 minute-ish wait (at least).

We later discovered that the reason it took us so long to get our meals is because the \\"fast food\\" part of the restaurant which is attached, had a lot of people coming in and out. \\n\\nTo tide ourselves over we ate the chips and salsa.  I am not a fan of their salsa which is more like a tomato and onion mush/puree versus a traditional style salsa.  Kind of a bummer. \\n\\nThe weird part of the night was when one of the girls in the group who had ordered veggie tostadas was approached by some guy working at the restaurant about 20 minutes after we ordered.  He told her that he recommended she try another dish that's similar instead of the tostada, and if she doesn't like it he'll buy her a margarita on the house.  She wasn't really feeling it, but clearly he was implying that they were somehow out of tostadas (even though one of the guys in our group had ordered the same thing), so she didn't have much of a choice.  Very strange interaction.\\n\\nAnyway, after the food FINALLY comes, it was just okay.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas which I felt were small, but maybe it was because I was starving by that point and felt totally underwhelmed.  My friends had a taco plate, a chicken mole and the tostadas which they all thought were OK.  The girl who ended up with the chef-recommended dish didn't love what she had and ended up getting a few glasses of peach sangria to make up for it on the house.\\n\\nThe sangria was the best thing any of us had all night.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I won't be going back to Cantina any time soon."},{"name":"Truluck's","address":"10225 Research Blvd, Ste 4000","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Absolutely amazing restaurant. 5 stars for the quality of the food, atmosphere and customer service.

They have priority bowling so when you eat dinner and you get your check they add you to somewhere on the list of people waiting for a lane and then you get to bowl without waiting hours. It is based on how many people get a entree, but normally for a few people it is worth it. It is $6.50 per game of bowling with a max of two games after 6pm and $4 to rent the as usual awful bowling shoes. \\n\\nThe big thing is that Kings is not good for large groups - unless you are large enough to take over the entire establishment. Last night my friend had a birthday outing to Kings with about 20 ish people. Some coming for dinner, some for bowling, some for both. We warned our waitress in advanced about the stream of people and the waitress who was wonderful understood and did everything in her power to help us out. We got our check and the buzzer for the bowling lanes, and it took us a long time to pay the check since there were 20ish people and when we got our check people were still finishing up drinks when the buzzer went off for the lanes. Two of us went up to the bowling desk and asked if we could have some more time we were having issues splitting up a rather large check. The clerk was annoyed and said she might be able to give us 10 minutes but needed to know how many people were bowling. I said I was not sure and apologized and thanked her. I told the birthday girl that we had about 10 minutes when the waitress came up to her and asked if everything was okay because someone in the party was screaming at the bowling desk manager! I cannot believe the bowling desk \\"manager\\" had the audacity to be so unprofessional to tell the waitress that about customers. I have worked in restaurants before and it is common to talk about customers in staff only areas, but to have another employee confront that customer was completely rude. The rest of the bowling night our large party was met by the bowling staff being rude - when one of the issues was the fact that the lane machine was not working properly. \\n\\nEvery time I have been at King's I have had a really good time and I would always recommend it to friends looking to do something besides going out to drink at a bar. However, this past occasion at King's left a bad taste in my mouth and I will have to think twice about recommending them to people and going there with a group."},{"name":"The Butcher Shop","address":"552 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We went there for late night and the atmosphere was magical.

A first for us.  What did we do to warrant such a diss, you ask?  Be patient - it is a slightly long story...\\n\\nWe walked up to Holy Taco on Saturday afternoon - about 30 minutes before the start of the East Atlanta Village Strut Parade.  We were told to \\"sit anywhere [we] liked.\\"  There was no hostess.  We scoped the covered patio - the available options included 2 small 2-tops in the sun or one 5-top round table with a nice umbrella where 2 guys were paying their bill and leaving.  We opted for the shade.  It wasn't crowded and we planned on eating and then heading out to watch the parade. \\n\\nOur waiter came by, we ordered beers and then 3 tacos and some $6 chips and salsa.  All was well. Then, in the middle of sipping our beers, and after we had been there for over 15 minutes, the waiter came back and told us that his manager has told him our table must be saved for a larger party and that we will need to move.  We said we would be glad to move if we could take our umbrella to one of the sunny 2-tops. \\n\\nWe heard nothing else until another 15 minutes later we were almost done eating our chewy chips and mediocre salsa when the manager (?) (I assume b/c she never introduced herself) came by and physically took the food from in front of us and informed us we were being moved (without our consent) to a 2-top in the shade which had become available.  She said she needed our table for a large group.  In shock, we complied and followed her to the corner table across the patio.  Then I told her that never in my life had I been forcibly removed from my seat in the middle of a meal and that although I understood the need to maximize seating, we had been told to \\"sit anywhere\\" and that 2 people had previously occupied the same table without an issue.  She got defensive and sarcastically said that she was \\"sorry\\" we had been so misinformed.  Really? If you don't want 2-tops at 5-tops, get a friggin hostess.  And if you realize after 2 customers have sat down, ordered, and started eating-it is your bad you sat them there and you suck it up or you ask them nicely to move and offer them a beer or an umbrella.  You NEVER force customers to chase their bowl of weak- ass salsa to a new table so you can cram in a few more guests on your patio.  \\n\\nSince our complicated order of 3 tacos was not ready at this point (about an hour at this point) we chose to relieve Holy Taco of the burden of having us as customers,  They quickly got us our incorrect bill, and we walked on to the Australian Bakery where they were actually happy to take our money and serve us."},{"name":"Hop's Chicken","address":"675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Simple and tasty!

First, today was the fourth time I've tried to try Mandy and Joe's and the first time I was successful. They've had a little sign up in their window that says \\"Closed Sundays through the summer\\" that I apparently should have taken literally since I'm pretty sure this was the first Sunday they've been open in a long time. It's my own fault for assuming that everyone else thinks the end of summer to be Labor Day, but I'm still a little irritated. Sue me.\\n\\nSurprised to find it finally open, and with open tables for Sunday brunch, no less, we sat down at one of the totally retro orange laminate tables and perused the menu. I was happy to see Eggs Benedict as the first thing on the menu, making my decision very easy. My BF also got the EB and BFF got the chocolate chip pancakes. Our food came relatively quickly and seemed to be missing some items. The menu may be poorly organized, but there's a little blurb underneath most of the menu items that states \\"The above items come with home fries and toast.\\" All of what we ordered was included in \\"the above items\\" but no one got toast (understandable with bready breakfasts) and BFF didn't get her homefries. The server didn't come by so we didn't get a chance to ask her about it. Sad day for the girl who looooves potatoes. The food was pretty good, but nothing particularly special. Everything needed salt and pepper.\\n\\nWe received our bill and tried to figure out whether we should pay our server or if there was a register somewhere at which to pay. After about 15 minutes, the server came by again and in response to our question, said, \\"Sorry hon, we only take cash, but there's tons of ATMs around here!\\" Ok. It would have been nice for that to be posted somewhere so BF didn't have to run out in the rain to get cash. FINALLY, we pay (at the register, not the server FYI) and get out of there.\\n\\nConclusion: Not bad, but not particularly good.

Throughout the year, whether it's cozying up on a rainy Vancouver winter night or the warm open air summer nights on the patio, the Arms Reach is inviting. The food is  tasty (their carpaccio and caesar are two of my favs). Certain evenings of the week they have a three course menu which includes a petite wine or liqueur serving with each coarse. Brunch is good too. It's also a perfect destination for taking out of town guests, especially in clear weather. The view is nothing short of breathtaking! Then, if the weather's nice, a stroll around the cove afterwards. Reservations are wise as they are popular. You can sometimes scootch up to the bar area if you have no reservation. The staff are pleasant and professional (no snooty pies lurking here).

I was recovering from a weekend of gluttonous out-of-control eating, so I demurely had a soup (wild mushroom) and brussels sprouts. They were both good, but the brussels sprouts (with bacon!) were too bitter for me. The mocktail, however, was amazing! I told the bartender via the waiter that I like either ginger + bourbon/scotch cocktails or St Germaine + grapefruit juice cocktails. He whipped up something that had ginger beer, lemon, honey, and rose water (essence?), among other things. It's usually disappointing when a 'mocktail' tastes like regular juice, but this one actually tasted like a fun cocktail. Win!\\n\\nOther pluses:\\nSince it was a bachelorette party, they gave us free dessert - s'more pudding, yum!\\nOne of the girls had the short ribs and they were too salty for her, so she left most of it uneaten.

We made sure to leave an extra large tip.\\nOur bachelorette mentioned that the grilled cheese was the best she'd ever had.\\n\\nThe decor is also fun and classy.

We also had some mussel soup (Caldo de Sururu), also really delicious. Their cocktails are also great (they have a full bar).\\nThen we had their signature dish Moqueca Completa, and since both of us ordered the same, it came in one large pot for sharing, with sides of rice, plantains, etc. It was the best seafood dish I had all week (in Connecticut and Boston). Such a perfect blend of fresh, delicious fish, shrimp, mussels, and calamari. We could only eat about a third of it, the portion was so big. \\n\\nWe should probably have shared instead of ordering a ton of food, but we planned to take some home.

So far I've had the spring rolls (cut diagonally, presentation counts!) and the fried tofu.  Both were fried well and not too greasy.  I'm not sure what all is in the spring rolls, but they were delicious.  They also have a selection of soups and Thai salad.  I've had several entrees, and each has been delicious.  I ordered each \\"medium\\", and they were actually medium - I've lost count of how many times I've ordered something \\"medium\\" at a restaurant and either got \\"spicy\\" or \\"mild\\" instead.

Let me start out by saying that I didn't have a bad experience.  I'm not really a fan of tapas by nature and part of it is due to the fact that each person gets about a bite and the price comparison when you factor that in is basically high.  \\n\\nI had the Ce Q (or something like that as there is no drink menu on their website).  Basically a cucumber martini and it was tasty.  However, garnished with a cucumber slice that had been out too long and was dried out.\\n\\nTo start we had the Charred Edamame with comes with four types of salt and pop rocks.  It was hard to dip them in the salt mixture and not get a clump of salt on it (so too much).  You also had to really hold it in your mouth for about 20 seconds before (and if) the pop rocks exploded.  Only two of us had it happen.  They were spicy without any seasoning.  I would've liked them to just salt them as they usually are.  The pop rocks are gimmicky so they could be eliminated as only 2 out of 5 had them pop.  We also had the warm peaches w/creme fresh and honey.  The honey ended up pooled at the bottom of the bowl.  These were good but not sweet enough.  They would've been better had they been grilled with some sugar on them to keep the sweetness of the peach in, since creme fresh itself is not sweet.\\n\\nNext we had the Scallops with cucumber sorbet.  This was very good. The sorbet was very refreshing.  We had a plate that I don't see on the menu and I don't recall it's name.  It was slices of tuna and that was delicious as well. That was followed by the trout.  It does come skin on which I realize is normal but was messy to remove so that it was easier to take a bite for everyone.  Then there was House tater tot \\"Swiftine\\", which tasted like tater tots and was quickly gobbled up.  Finally we had the Warm Niman Ranch pork cheeks.  Very tender and it was served with a choice of mustard or fig spread and slices of grilled sourdough bread.  I loved the combination of the fig and pork.  However, they could've given us a slice of bread per person.  There were four, we were a group of five.\\n\\nFor dessert we ordered Popcorn and A Movie and the Peach sorbet and Tres Leches.  Both were good in different ways.  The P&M had a house made candy bar and popcorn ice cream and was very rich.  The Tres Leches and sorbet was very light and refreshing.\\n\\nOverall thoughts.

Price - pretty typical for Harvard Square.\\n\\nFood:\\nIt's a little hit or miss.  The lamb nachos are fantastic.  The earth bowl is really good.  The short-rib lasagne really really good (especially on a cold winter night).  I had a BBQ pulled pork sandwich once that was meh. And one other entree that was forgettable so I forgot it.

The spare ribs in black bean sauce were some of the best I've ever had, but the rib pieces weren't as meaty as others that I've had.  The bone/cartilage to meat ratio made me rethink the value.  Also, the beef tripe with ginger could have been sliced thinner as it was a bit chewy and clunky to eat.  \\n\\nThe service was okay.  No water was brought out, tea had to be requested and it got confusing after 4 different staff members came to the table for various reasons other than filling our glass with water.

My pollo en mole, which was described as chicken cutlets in mole sauce came out looking like sesame chicken (yes, complete with sesames and all.)  It was thigh meat chopped up into chunks that you would expect in your takeout burrito, and it wasn't well trimmed.  The mole sauce had no mole taste to it, it was just a red sauce with waaaaay too much salt.  I usually like salt on my food, and tend to add it to alot of what i order, so if it was too salty for me, I can't imagine who would enjoy it. \\n\\nMy wife wasn't crazy about the chile rellenos.

We got there exactly at 5:30 and avoided the dreaded wait. They sat us in a weird corner booth directly facing another couple eating which I thought was odd because about 80% of the restaurant was empty but whatever. After a pretty long wait for our waiter to come to us, we ordered the buffalo Brussels sprouts, catfish po boy, and veggie burger. \\n\\nThe Brussels sprouts saved the day in my opinion. Thought they were still pretty tough inside the breading was really great. If they were cooked on the inside longer they would've been a lot better and more manageable- you couldn't even cut them in half they were so dense. \\n\\nThe catfish po boy was a 7/10. The remoulade was very garlicky but the fish itself was great and well seasoned. The pickles on the side were sweet (?) which was unexpected. \\n\\nThe reason this restaurant has 3 stars instead of 5 is because of the veggie burger. The bun was ROCK SOLID. It was so hard that you couldn't bite it or even cut it. The patty inside was crumbly and fell apart immediately- a weird combination of rock solid bun and mushy burger. They added so much guacamole which didn't help the burger texture much. I felt bad for my date who ordered the veggie burger because it was an extreme let down. \\n\\nNo one asked how our food was- probably because they knew it was sub par.

My friends got there at 7:30 and had to wait about 30 mins to get seated (this place is popular!). I rolled in around 8:30 and joined them. They were already eating appetizers and had drinks, and we ordered dinner together. \\n\\nTheir homemade veggie burger is NOT vegan (it has egg in it), but their mezz plate on the appetizers is vegan - hummus, walnut spread, and something else. And if you hate olives like me they will leave them off! I ordered that - it was really good. It comes with a ton of pita bread which is nice (usually places never give you enough bread). It would be neat though instead of all the pita bread, to give you some veggies to use to dip (less carb action!). \\n\\nI also ordered a side of sauteed spinach (cooked with olive oil and garlic). It was decent - I always can have more garlic in everything... \\n\\nThey had some good looking salads. The only other vegan option is the grilled kabobs. They will hold off the feta in the orzo salad and instead you can add some hummus on top. I didn't get it because it's kind of pricey (around $15) I think for grilled kabobs and I'm not a huge fan of green pepper (they are already made so you can't order specifics on them). \\n\\nI got a white sangria which was really yummy HOWEVER I asked the waiter about the fruit in the sangria because I'm wicked picky with sangrias and I want good fruit. Like fruit that's been saturated in the drink for a day - big chunks. And he assured me there was fruit. But there was no fruit, just an orange slice on the side. =( \\n\\nThey had other yummy mixed drinks too. My friends got the Spanish corn, mac n cheese, pulled pork, deviled eggs, wings, etc. and all seemed to like it. They also got the chocolate pudding and the bread pudding desserts - and ate every bite. I could have gotten lemon sorbet but decided to skip it. \\n\\nThe best part of the place was the service - our waiter was so nice and helpful. He knew so much about the menu (what was vegan, what they could change,. etc.) and I really appreciate that. Big props to him. The place is a little dark so I wasn't able to take pics of the food. \\n\\nI certainly want to come back for brunch - they have a vegan tofu scramble that looks good!"},{"name":"Tomahawk Barbeque","address":"1550 Philip Avenue","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Great decoration and good amount of food served.

After 8, or so visits a year since it opened this latest meal was the first ever where we had to complain about neglectful, languid service. \\n\\nWhat makes the experience all the worse is the fact that my party was something like the third, or fourth table of the day, so being busy had nothing to do with the remiss service. \\n\\nIn reflecting upon the experience I am struck by the curious thing that happened after we confronted the offending server. Unlike what you'd expect at a better Boston restaurant, which the Barbara Lynch brand tries to be, we got a double helping of this server's bile and vinegar attitude. \\n\\nIn the end the manager came over and spoke with us, but even this was odd because the server, like a dog with a new bone, sought to amplify and play out the affair as theater for the rest of the now full bar. Yes, we had our appetizer and wine comped, but the added insult to injury that came from confronting our server was that we were made to feel like asses for addressing our server's attitude. \\n\\nI would recommend to B.L. that she make it policy for servers to not to accompany the manager in handling customer complaints and that in all future hiring an interest in customer service be required in addition to general wine knowledge.\\n\\nThe bottom line: The Butcher Shop can be pretty good, however I suspect what my partner and I were subjected to is a symptom of a franchise of restaurants that has expanded too fast and is experiencing growing pains.

We were recommended this place for their great breakfast and short drive from the Capilano Bridge. So we were off... We get there I think around 10am and the place was pretty busy. We had to wait about ten minutes before we were seated. \\n\\nI guess this place is famous for their Yukon bacon so I had to go with that. My friend and I end up ordering the Campfire (the smaller version of the Yukon Bacon and Eggs) and my two other friends order the Tomahawk Traditional. I also ordered the Cranberry juice which apparently is freshly delivered to the restaurant every morning. I had to try this out... never had that before. \\n\\nWhen we got our food, our eyes glistened as we were about to tear up some food! Everything looked so good. The Yukon bacon looked different from what I was accustomed to. It was a circular slice of bacon.... not the long rectangular strip I'm used to looking at. Either way, it smelled great and I took a bite into that first. Delicious! Perfect texture where it's wasn't too crunchy or too soft and with a hint of sweetness too. I then had the hash browns which were probably the best hash browns I have ever had. Cut into small cubes, these hash browns were crunchy and flavorful... no oily taste either! \\n\\nI then take a sip of my cranberry juice... Whoa that's GOOOOOOD! That's cranberry juice?!? This time I take a gulp! The juice tasted and smelled so fresh. It was real thick and pulpy too... the way I like it. What's crazy too is that it didn't have that strong, almost bitter taste like all cranberry juices have out there. I wish I had a glass right now. \\n\\nSince Canada is also known for their syrup, I had to take one of my friend's pancakes and syrup in return for hash browns and toast. It was worth the trade because I swear the pancakes with the syrup were off the hook too! Probably not the best pancake I've had but definitely the best syrup I've had. The syrup was light with just the right amount of sweetness. It didn't overpower the taste of the pancake but complemented it very well. \\n\\nIf I were to come to Vancouver again, I would make sure to drop by and have breakfast here. Not only did my friends and I have the best breakfast ever but we were able to meet the owner of Tomahawk, Chuck. He was a very nice guy.

The others at the table who ordered \\"Chuy-changas\\" also had clean plates. But there weren't resounding endorsements either. A common complaint was that there was lots of shell, but not a lot of stuff inside. My burrito was stuffed full for what it's worth.

I'd say look for the items that are \\"house specials\\" and you should have pretty good luck.\\n\\nAs with most restaurants these days, the only place the service fell down was between the end of the meal and delivery of the checks. This is a common complaint of mine (especially since the children can't be contained any longer at this point) But I would have liked it sooner. \\n\\nOverall, a good choice. It was a good meal and nice to not be gouged by WDW for dinner. I think most will be pleased. Also- kids meals came with a push-pop ice cream at the end. Nice touch! I'd come back.

The pricing was reasonable by Disney standards but the food quality seemed better than other park choices.  \\n\\nAlso tried the Pandora Sunrise which was basically Powerade mixed with fruit juice, guessing pineapple and melon.  It was ok but nothing great.  I wouldn't order it again.\\n\\nFour stars for now but hoping to increase it to five stars once I have a chance to come back for lunch or dinner and try the beef bowl."},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The beer cheese is the best thing i have ever tasted.

I was feeling breakfasty, so I ordered the Triple-Double which was essentially eggs (any style), your choice of bacon/sausage/ham (I went with bacon, because bacon always wins), home fries, and two pieces of french toast (either plain or with your choice of fruit). The meal took up the entirety of two plates, and left me stuffed for hours. The home fries in particular were extra-crispy and flavorful, just the way I like them.\\n\\nMy husband went for the sandwich & soup combo; he got the pulled pork sandwich and the soup of the day - chicken, lemon, and rice. Both passed the test (though the pulled pork was quite messy!), and portions were very generous.\\n\\nThe only two slight bummers were: 1) They were out of both their fresh orange juice AND their fresh grapefruit juice (I was definitely craving OJ to go with my brunch) - thankfully the fresh cider was tasty as well, and 2) My husband ordered fries, which were forgotten. To be fair, as soon as we saw how GINORMOUS the portions were that we received, we were fine just focusing on the food that we did have, and we immediately decided to let the fries go. I'm sure if we had mentioned the omission, our waitress would have immediately and apologetically brought us the fries (she was awesome!). We weren't charged for them though, and we couldn't even finish the food that we did have, so it all worked out for the best.\\n\\nThis was definitely one of the best and most filling meals that I've had for under $25 (for two) in a long time.

It's a pretty substantial burger on its own, and I'd probably be surprised at the size of the regular burgers.  \\n\\nI was greeted in a friendly way as I walked in the front door.  I had to stop for a minute and look over my shoulder as I wasn't sure who they were shouting at, but it was me, and I guessed it was OK that they were shouting at me as I wasn't holding the place up or anything (but seriously I'm having some fun here and it was done in a fun way).  \\n\\nThe overall store colors of red on white works very well here.  Everything is super clean and shiny, which is appreciated, and I was thrilled with the signage.  The signage is not up too high and is lettered nicely enough that it was super easy to read and order.  Oh and it was not digital signage.  I've grown to not like digital signage, although I'm sure business owners must love it.  The cashier was very helpful in explaining how to order the extra free toppings and was friendly as well, and when I didn't choose to order a beverage, immediately offered me a cup for water.  Sometimes in other places when I choose just water, I often feel like a cheapskate.  I wasn't made to feel that way here at Five Guys.  I also think the traffic flow here for such a large venue is very well handled and very efficient.  I never once felt like I had any problems getting in and out.\\n\\nI didn't order fries (some who know me well might chuckle a little bit at not ordering fries as I've spoken about my love of fried potato products at other places often here on Yelp), which I guess I'm going to have to remedy because I've heard the fries are really great at Five Guys.  The lack of fries ordered is evidently what emboldened me to order the bacon on my cheeseburger.  What really impressed me was they got my bacon fried totally perfect for me, still a little limp and not crispy.  I know it's un-American, but I simply don't like bacon fried crispy.  \\n\\nOK, moving on from my bacon preferences, I really enjoyed my burger an awful lot.  I don't very often order burgers or fries anywhere anymore, so it was excellent that my treat was so tasty.  As I left, someone shouted a friendly good-bye, but I just smiled as I walked out the door and said to myself \\"oh, that's just the Five Guys way.\\"  Overall, the experience was really so good that I will have to come back and have burgers and fries in order to probably up the experience to five stars."},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Cool Joint-Food just fair\\nBrisket Dry Dry Dry and Stringy \\nApple Cole Slaw all mushy probably left over from lunch. \\nRibs fair but overcooked.

The place always smells so wonderful and the food is super tasty.  The sides are wonderful.  My only complaint is that the order taking process is so broken and we always have a problem with it. It's rather aggravating!  When you walk in, the person handling the meat can only do 1 order at a time, even though we are ordering the same thing.  So it takes longer than necessary, when the person could ask what we both want and make the order much quicker.  Then the side order is taken by the same person that works the register, but they don't really communicate with the person making the sandwiches, so it's a lot of back and forth.\\nDon't get me wrong the food is really good, but the slow order taking process really brings down the whole experience.  If this process could be fine-tuned, I believe this would greatly improve the overall experience and become a really great bbq restaurant.\\nI covered the basics in my previous review(s); the only change is that they don't do meals anymore. It used to be you purchased a sandwich and then added 2 sides for an additional charge. Now everything is a la carte and it's more expensive this way.  Also they don't have the \\"lil sandwich\\" or the onion tanglers anymore. The onion tanglers were arguably one of our favorite sides, because they tasted great on the sandwich!

First stop: Simply Thai. Came at 8pm and joked about easily being able to find a seat after seeing the empty patio with tons of tables and chairs. Then saw the inside of the restaurant and realized it was full. Joke retracted. We stood at the front desk for about 5 minutes before someone came by to help us. We were told to find a table in the back and so we navigated ourselves back there. \\n\\nWe were informed that there were only two servers working that night and so they were quite understaffed. We hoped that this wasn't also the case in the kitchen, as thanks to parking meters, we were limited for our time. \\n\\nWe had the wrong wine brought to us after waiting for a considerable time for our order to be taken. We were then informed that the wine ordered wasn't in stock but they had a different white available for the same price. No notes on the taste could be given and so after tasting it, we figured it was okay. \\n\\nWe tried the traditional menu, which was $25/person with a minimum of 2 people. First the Tom Yum Goong soup was brought out. Small individual bowls were brought so we could serve ourselves. The broth was delicious and very flavourful. Floating on the top were quartered and partially cooked white mushrooms and at the bottom were 4 prawns. Neither the mushrooms nor the prawns had much flavour to them, but I would assume they were cooked and then quickly added to the broth. \\n\\nNext came the appetizer dish with 2 chicken satays, 2 Cho Muang (violet coloured dumplings with minced chicken), and 2 Tod Mun (fish cakes). The chicken satays were nicely cooked and the sauce on top was okay. Peanuty but I scraped most off. The Cho Muang had a very squishy texture and are bright pink. The Tod Mun was very spicy and I'm not sure what kind of fish was used in it. \\n\\nOur entrees of Pad Thai, Massaman Curry, Gra Paow, and the world's largest bowl of jasmine rice were all brought out. There were definitely enough portions for 4 people, especially after the appetizers. The Pad Thai was delicious. Nice and sweet. Not too oily. Lots of chicken and tofu. The Massaman curry had a fabulous curry sauce and the potatoes and carrots were perfectly cooked. And the Gra Paow had tons of basil and all vegetables were perfectly cooked. The entrees overall were very good and we had tons of leftovers. \\n\\nDessert was banana fritters with a choice of coconut, mango, or vanilla ice cream. The fritters arrived cold and very oily. Not being a fan of bananas, mine were pushed over to my friend's plate, where they also sat uneaten. The ice cream was generic but served as a large portion. \\n\\nOverall, the food was good and the restaurant was bustling.

We'd been there before, and although I recall it being perfectly mediocre, we went again, since they had outdoor seating and it was an utterly beautiful day. \\n\\nBut this isn't really a redemption story. \\n\\nWe weren't seated immediately, We stood awkwardly in the entrance until one of the three waitresses there noticed us. We were instructed to seat ourselves outside. So we did. Someone came by to take our drink order, though with no sense of urgency. The patio was about half-filled with diners, with fewer indoors. Despite the heavy staff load, it took more than twenty minutes for the waitress to come take our food order. In fact, a couple who arrived after us were eating their quesadilla before we were even approached to order. \\n\\nIt's not our style to speak up unless something is really wrong, so we just sat, sipped our beers and chatted the afternoon away, enjoying the company. Eventually the food came--a fish sandwich and a veggie burger. We asked for a side of tartar sauce. It came more than five minutes later. I can't complain about the food, nor can I commend it. It was average, though pricey for what it was. My pint of draught beer was $6.50. I drink a lot of beer in a lot of places and that's unusually expensive. Unless you're at one of the top-tier Boston eateries, in which case I have no problem paying a little more, if for no other reason than for the unadulterated joy of watching someone use a scoopula to remedy the mess I've inevitably made with the dinner rolls. It's like watching Bob Ross paint, but backwards. Sort of. \\n\\nAnyway...\\n\\nI get frustrated by restaurants that could be awesome, and for no reason than apathy, are completely middle-of-the-road.

The price was good, about $18 for a dozen pieces of sushi. The fish itself was very fresh, with the possible exception of the mackerel which had an ever-so-slight off taste. Pros: Good, basic sushi without added wasabe. I like to control how much of that I use, if any. In this case, the sushi had a really good taste without it. They offered a free serving of edamame while the order was being prepared, a nice touch. Cons: The rice was overly cold, and crumbled when I tried to pick up the sushi, making it frustrating to eat without looking like a slob. Also, the atmosphere was poor. It seems to be a redecorated fast food place with stains on the ceiling. I know that may not be important to many, but for me, sushi is more of an experience just just a meal. They were also conducting business with a vendor in the dining room which was a bit distracting. No fault of the restaurant, but after I was seated, a family with a small child was seated nearby and screamed non-stop. Again, not the fault of the restaurant, but it did affect my enjoyment of the meal. I only tried the sushi, not the other menu items. Recommended if you want a quick sushi experience without spending a ton of money and don't mind a very casual environment. Personally, I would give it another try.

It was supposed to come with sour cream but I noticed that there was none. After alerting the waiter, he reassured me that the sour cream was inside the bowl but when I got home I noticed that they didn't add it. It was very annoying to have noticed at the restaurant that the sour cream was missing and that they totally dismissed it and sent me on my way without even checking. I can't decide what was worse, the soup or the soft shell tacos. Both the chicken and the vegetarian tacos were bland and dry as sandpaper. There was no seasoning, no sauce, no condiments.

The food is nothing to rave about, but it gets the job done as a lunch option. It's relatively cheap (between $6-$9), quick, and decently good. \\n\\nA couple tips:\\n1. When you walk in, all the lines are usually jumbled for the lunch rush. The sandwich line is usually the longest, so if you're not there for one of those, walk up front and look for the actual line for the food you want.\\n2. Get a punch card.

I had the Chicken Piccata which looked really good, fresh veggies, lots of chicken, etc but it lacked a little something in taste.

The waitress was really attentive to us even though they were really busy. It's a great place to go and catch a Blazers game or watch a sporting event, especially when the whole restaurant is into the game. The atmosphere really facilitates and encourages sporting events. \\n\\nThis particular location is good, it has ample amount of parking. The wait is usually pretty short, and it's right off the freeway which is always nice. If you come with a large crowd they are always willing to accommodate the amount of people you have even if that means putting multiple tables together. The wings are great. I personally get the traditional style wings, with the sauce on the side, and blue cheese. I always like to have it with a thing of fries, the best part is they always offer you free celery and carrots which is nice when you're eating fried food. \\n\\nThe bar is open seating so you're able to go in as you please without having to wait. Every Buffalo wild wings I've been to has Buckhunter which is an awesome game to play while waiting for your food. \\n\\nThe cinnamon bites with caramel sauce and ice cream are a great dessert and only $4.99. At the end of the day I wouldn't go in there with super high expectations, it's a wings restaurant, not an elegant five-star restaurant. So if you're looking to go out with some buddies, or even friends and family want to have a good time watching sports and have a few drinks it's a great place. If you're looking for a nice restaurant to take your girlfriend or wife out on a date this would probably not be the best place for you. \\n\\nI wouldn't eat this every day but it's nice every once in a while."},{"name":"Lee's Burger Place","address":"216 Sumner St","city":"Newton Centre","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this place.

I order the alfredo pasta with smoked gouda and penne noodles, and I also ordered the fried shrimp appetizer. When I ordered I asked the young lady if the shrimp was a big seller and if it was a good choice over wings. I wish I never asked her opinion because she clearly has no palette. \\n\\nI specifically requested the shrimp to be tossed in a buffalo sauce. I also said if they were not able to do that I will take the wings instead. I would have checked it there had the guy at the counter not quickly tied the bag into a not before I could check my order. To be quick the shrimp were not tossed in a buffalo sauce. They were coated in grease. They also were reminiscent of cheap onion rings, the kind that taste like a dissolving frozen fried gloop. That sums up the shrimp. I hope I don't get sick from all the grease.\\n\\nIf I had to describe the Alfredo in one word, I would call it disappointing.  Then again, I feel as if I could use a string of choice words to describe the disgust of this pasta. If you love and respect your mind, body, spirit, and wallet then avoid this place!
