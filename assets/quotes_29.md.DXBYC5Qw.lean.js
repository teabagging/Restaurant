One of my first experiences here was a first lunch date with a girl who had never eaten Lebanese food before (which has always been a favorite of mine). Hoping to make a good impression (and expand her culinary horizons) I put my faith in Karam after having eaten here only once before and walking away extremely pleased.\\n\\nFirst, the food. . If you want to sample various different appetizers, I would recommend the \\"Veggie Mezza\\" which gets you some taboule, hummus, grape leaves, baba ghanouj, and falafel. It's a nice way to get a taste for lots of different traditional items. Plus, wrapping up some hummus and falafel in the fresh pita makes for a tasty pre-meal snack.  Shawarma is sort of a de facto standard or entry dish for Lebanese food and, even though it's pretty simple, it's one of my favorites. Both the chicken and lamb shawarma are served in good portion sizes and the spices are excellent.  The meal comes with either rice or hummus and because I hate being forced to choose I usually opt to get a bit of both. The first thing I loved about this place is their hummus is smooth and zesty. Especially nice is that they bring in more freshly cooked puffed pita bread whenever you run out so if you have some hummus you have constant zesty garbanzo bean paste slathered on warm and delicious flat bread. If you want something different that will compliment your meal check out the Lebanese soda selection (soda water flavored with rose water, jallab, tamarind, or mulberry).\\n\\nThe atmosphere of Karam is pretty laid back. Some of the other Lebanese places in town seem a bit stuffy but this is definitely not the case here. From experience, you can either have a quiet date here or bring the family down for some good food. The staff is really friendly and always attentive. In the end, I think this was a great choice for a first lunch date since I ended up marrying the girl and now she loves Lebanese food."},{"name":"Buckstop","address":"833 Denman Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Great cozy space on Denman to have some greasy BBQ and drinks!

There was stuff laying our that you shouldn't see when you're eating: cleaning supplies and mops, junk stuffed into cabinets, and an old cake behind an open glass case, under the counter where you pay, near your feet. And everybody had on dirty aprons. They were cute aprons, but they were dirty, flour and food-stained from cooks wiping their hands on the front. \\n\\nIn their defense, they are new and just recently opened. They have all the makings of a great  little cafe, but they really need someone to organize, clean and get them looking like professionals. Their appearance gives the impression that  they are just working like crazy but can't get it all done, which is understandable for a new business, but an enjoyable dining experience usually  happens in a clean setting. It doesn't need to be an expensive, fancy or even a beautiful setting, but it needs to be clean and neat.

We took the paired version.\\n\\nWe started off with the \\"Greek salad shooter\\" which was actually cucumber water with a hint of olive oil with little bits of tomato, cucumber, and feta cheese to give the overall flavour of a Greek salad.

Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/Nf4qbw8t6e1CKsDXfl9vWw?select=oY1ALQdG2JjozORFxtllzQ It was paired with a glass of See Ya Later Ranch Chardonnay, which made for a good pairing as it held up well against the overpowering oregano.  \\n\\nThe main course was herb roasted chicken served bone-in on top of an orzo stuffed bell pepper with a tomato sauce.  This dish was nicely balanced, with a nice crust on the chicken while being moist and tender on the inside.  The orzo was cooked perfectly and the bell pepper had a nice char.  Overall a very nice dish.  Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/Nf4qbw8t6e1CKsDXfl9vWw?select=2W1iEWiGeQSKOl2LVf0xKA It was paired with a glass of merlot (I'm sorry, I forgot which vineyard) that paired well with the tomato flavours.  \\n\\nDessert was a thin slice of cake topped with a chocolate mousse, plated with a fresh caramel and a small Greek style meringue cookie.

For me, the more things you shove into maki, the better. The highlight of my night was the American Tango roll, an outrageous creation featuring hot pepper tuna, cucumber, avocado, goat cheese, shitake mushroom tempura, and a strawberry and balsamic vinegar sauce.

I ordered the fried tomato benedict. The fried tomato was little heavy on the batter which was admittedly tough and chewy, and the tomato itself was very mild and lacking the expected tartness. The eggs were poached perfectly, but the (pimento?) hollandaise, like the tomato, was extremely under-seasoned and tasted a bit off, not bad, just... maybe unbalanced? I'm not a picky person, but I thought maybe it was a personal taste issue, so I had my fianc√© try it as well. In this case he strongly agreed and wouldn't take another bite. I feel they had a good concept here, the execution was just off. Maybe with a slightly riper tomato, less batter, more seasoning, and more acid to balance the pimento in the hollandaise? \\n\\nWell, after the main course the superb service continued and our waiter was kind enough to offer us a smaller portion of the caramel popcorn sundae as we were dying to try it but could barely manage another bite.

He was a sweetheart, and he did the best he could with a pretty crazed situation.\\n\\nAs for the margaritas, I think I described them as \\"tasty\\" in my previous review.  This time, I wasn't a huge fan of the taste, but they weren't awful... and man, were they STRONG.  I mean, that may have had something to do with the fact that I'd finished a whole drink and started on the second one before my dinner came out, but I am not a small girl and I'm not that big of a lightweight.  They weren't skimping on the alcohol.\\n\\nSince other people have criticized the food at RIo Grande, I kept it simple and ordered a chicken quesadilla.  As a result, I can't say much about the quality of the food overall, but my quesadilla didn't suck.  Then again, it's pretty hard to screw up a quesadilla.  But the portion was good, the chicken was coated in a sauce that had a little kick to it, and there was plenty of cheese.  So no complaints there.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Rio Grande is a restaurant I'd probably never choose to go to on my own.  But my experiences there haven't been bad, and the staff seem to be genuinely nice people.  If you're more interested in drinks than food and you're willing to deal with a few mishaps, I'd recommend booking the private room for an event because from what I hear it's a pretty cheap deal and they did us right."},{"name":"City Winery","address":"650 North Ave NE, Ste 201, Ponce City Market","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"This place is pretty impressive.

I have already checked out many reviews before we went there for dim sum, so since the reviews are of mediocre rating, and we have had not much expectation except to try out another new restaurant in Vancouver.  As expected, food quality was average, and the price tag was way above average.  Take the Harkow \\"steamed shrimp dumpling\\" as the first example, 4 pieces at $12, and nothing impressive that you could go to any Chinese restaurant to get the same quality at less than half of this price.  On top of that, if you have tried the food court style \\"Market East\\" downstairs, they serve the same Harkow at only $6.50.  The only impressive dim sum was the steamed roll with scallop and spinach, which tasted like fresh seafood and there was scallop and spinach at every bite.  Another highlight was the tea which started from $6 - $15 per person.  I would recommend each guest at the your table to order their own flavor of tea, because anyway the tea is charged per person.  If you order the same tea leaves for everyone at your table, you will pay per person for the same pot of tea.  They do have an impressive tea leaves menu, which include some of tea leaves that most Chinese restaurants don't carry.  Sorry that I could not put out the names of these Chinese tea leaves because the tea menu does not actually translate from Mandarin to English but have the Pin-Yin only.  This is very confusing because they only have the tea menu in English and not in Chinese, so I wonder who would understand this Pin-Yin tea menu, and who are their target audience?!  The Caucasians would not understand the Pin-Yin tea menu, and the Chinese would not understand the English tea menu.  Very poor menu-planning!  We have also ordered lobster boiled rice which came in a big bowl, so portion was good for sharing.  However, another inexcusable mistake happened when we were served this dish as the first one at our table, even though we have told our server 2 times to serve this after all dim sum.  What has surprised us the most was the manager in suit bringing this lobster  boiled rice to our table as he should understand it is common sense to eat dim sum before any rice or noodle dishes!  Our server looked very embarrassed and immediately asked the manager to stop serving!  We were quite sure at this point they will keep this lobster boiled rice after dim sum, and simply warmed it up to serve the same dish!  Last but not least, we have ordered 4 kinds of desserts, and none of them were something you would go back for.  Our server has highly recommended what he called \\"homemade egg tart\\", so we ordered and consumed, but the egg tart were only luke warm with runny custard, not being cooked thoroughly.  We have heard this restaurant has a Michelin star chef on site, and hope that he wasn't the one cooking any of these dishes that day, otherwise his reputation would be going down the ditch!  You can go for much better Chinese food in Vancouver and Richmond at a lower price.

The bartenders are really helpful & friendly, and they've come up with an inspired list of libations, especially whiskey-based mixes (they have a very nice selection of American Bourbons, and a couple of Ryes, but not a terribly impressive selection of Scotch.)  Of course when your drinks are as complex and subtle as H Harper's often are, it takes a bit of patience to get your drink.  Naturally as they get busier this becomes worse, and the impatient among us end up getting frustrated.  I suggest ordering a punch bowl if you can, therefore, as 4-6 of you can share a nice drink while laughing at the ridiculous old-fashioned crystalware they serve it to you from (which is a nice touch, it's ridiculous in a fun way, mind.)\\n\\nThe menu is interesting with lots of small plates and some good flavors but some of the combinations are a bit off.  For example, the chicken and dumplings has a beautiful, tasty broth, but they throw a chicken wing and biscuit in the bowl.  Unfortunately the wing has a lightly breaded coating, which just ends up soggy, and you have to pick it out of the bowl by hand to eat it anyway - so why throw it in the middle of the dish?  In fact why have it at all, how about more of the yummy dark meat chicken?  Standouts for our table were the bacon bread (it comes on the side of a couple different plates) and root vegetable salad, which is beautifully prepared and presented.\\n\\nI can recommend this place overall, but don't go in a hurry, on a very tight budget or without wanting to share plates, as the experience they are creating lends itself to a laid-back, cocktail driven, meal with a variety of smaller dishes."},{"name":"Tan Tan Cafe & Delicatessen","address":"316 SE 123rd Ave, Ste A3","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I went here for lunch today.

My husband opted for the Wonton Soup instead. We also ordered the Hot tea. The tea came out first and it was a delightful Jasmine Tea. My husband also ordered the Vietnamese Coffee. It was presented in a small camex-like pot. It had a sweet coconut cream on the bottom and he really enjoyed it. The portions are enormous. His bowl of soup could have feed 3. The only thing we did not like was that the broth was rather bland but once he added Hoisin sauce and my cilantro to it, it changed and became much better. There were lots of dumplings and there were also noodles which most Wonton soups do not have. The Pad Thai was different then the normal Thai Pad Thai. This one has a sweet tomato base with lots of noodles, onions, fresh bean sprouts and cilantro. I opted for the chicken which well cooked and abundant.

While i enjoy an exposed kitchen, if i'm just looking at line cooks and a giant hood over the flat top, I'd rather not see it.  The prep area was cool to watch as the waiters and (i'm assuming some other chefs) did the finishing touches prior to the food going out.\\n\\nAnyway, sat down, and the service was a bit lacking. However, the waiter recognized this and apologized as he had a big table near us. Also, the couple in the booth next to us also had bad service, and that waiter also lamented how poor his attention was to that table (he also had a large table).  So while it was nice that they recognized the lack of attention and apologized, wouldn't it be better just to give good service and not have to apologize?  basically the only reason it is not 5 stars.\\n\\nWe each had cocktails, which are pretty stiff here, so I enjoyed it, but my wife prefers not to taste the liquor so she didn't like it so much.\\n\\nStarted out with the Knife and Fork Crostini and Soft Shell Crab appetizer.  The Crostini was nice, but I was a little taken aback by how overpowering the blue cheese mousse was, but the dish was pretty good, not great. Also, it's just one crostini, so it seemed a bit lacking for $10.  Ths Soft Shell Crab app, however, was awesome. the mix of the warm black bean salsa with cold mangoes and the crunch from the pan fried soft shell crab was quite the treat! It was really a great texture and taste experience.\\n\\nMy wife had the quail for entree (which comes with 2 birds) and I had the lamb (which was basically 3 ribs).  Both entrees were really good and cooked perfectly. The portions were pretty hearty so I was pleasantly surprised and happy about the quality and quantity of food provided.

Last was the El Rey chocolate cheesecake.  My wife's steak was prepared perfectly and she loves the mac and cheese they do at Zoot and Wink.  I eat out a lot but rarely go out on the top end of expense.  While I consider Zoot a mid range dinner for expense at $100+ for 2 I really need to feel the expense is justified.  Zoot exceeded expectations and was a great time.  The atmosphere, wait staff and food was excellent.

I awaited my party at the bar. The bartenders were rushed--one hurried through a drink description before running off to do something else, and the other carefully futzed and ignored my gaze for a few minutes before taking my order. I ordered the Bobby Burns, a blended scotch cocktail that tasted only of blended scotch. \\n\\nAt the table, we ordered several items: arancini, which were very good, with the perfect ratio of crunchy exterior to melty interior, and with a bright lemony note; the pork terrine plate, which was alright--the duck was a bit gamy to my taste, but the jellied ham was somewhat of a revelation; fig and melon salad, which suffered from flavorless melon; a burrata and tomato salad, which suffered from flavorless  and underripe tomatoes; a dish of scrambled eggs and vegetables, which was very nice, with perfectly soft eggs, scarce and average grilled vegetables, and a very nice version of romesco; and a really tasty little dish of farro. Most portions were quite small, more appetizer than small-plate-sized--only the farro (billed as a side) seemed appropriately portioned.\\n\\nThere was about a 20-minute delay between the clearing of our smaller plates--which came out all at once--and the delivery of the eggs and farro. There was no mention of or apology for this, even after we inquired as to their whereabouts.\\n\\nFor dessert, we got the Mississippi mud cake and the Black Forest cake. The mud cake was terrific, with an unctuous chocolate-mocha pudding, a soft pile of whipped cream, and a malted crunch to the cake. The Black Forest cake, which is about 1/3 ganache, was served cold, which gave it the texture, sliceability, and appeal of wet soda bread. The cherry mousse made a mess, and the proportions  and flavor were all wrong. The accompanying chocolate malt ice cream was good, but was overwhelmed. Coffee, served in an adorable single-person French press pot, tasted odd, almost like a chicory blend. It was not to my taste.\\n\\nThe restaurant charges $1 per person for unlimited bread and filtered water. The bread is good, but served in tiny portions with good salted butter, and only on request. On our visit, there was often quite a delay between requesting refills on bread and receiving them. The water is delicious--just about as delicious as Atlanta tap water, which is clean and tasty, and, notably, free. \\n\\nI found the charge for bread and water gauche as hell, especially in a restaurant where so many other items seemed priced beyond their value. I suggest revisiting this policy. If the charge persists, the bread should be brought in quantity, and promptly.\\n\\nWhen I noted to the server that an item could have been improved by being served at a different temperature, she replied defensively. There is no excuse for this in a restaurant that takes itself and its customers' satisfaction seriously.\\n\\nThe dining room and the bar, for what it's worth, are done in a beautiful, understated farmhouse chic--elegant, with a simultaneously rich and comfortable appearance. The bathrooms are similarly lovely, with pretty, blush-colored penny tile and crystal-knobbed furnishings. The cloth handtowels are a nice touch.\\n\\nUnless I hear that a lot here has changed, I will not be returning, no matter what Bon Appetit says about it."},{"name":"North By Northwest Restaurant & Brewery - Stonelake","address":"10010 Capital Of Tx Hwy N","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"finally decided to try after all...

Still, my interaction with them resulted in a fairly big customer service failure, I'm guessing because they're not used to dealing with businesses. \\n\\nOn a Monday, I call on behalf of my company's Human Resources department to send a gift basket to an employee on leave.

I ask the clerk if she needs the name on the card, and she says no. Increasingly puzzled, I run all over the building, talk to the accountant, and get a third manager's card from a completely different bank. Also declined. In desperation, I finally give them my personal card number. Accepted!\\n\\nAfter some consultation with our accountant, I talk to the credit card company and the light bulb goes on: MY name was on the order, and the credit card service was comparing the name on the card to the name on the order.

I almost didn't want to eat it because it was salty. I had to eat a lot more white rice to balance off the taste, and even this could not help. We brought one dish home because we hardly touched it.

The other manager (sorry I don't know the proper spelling) Yung, came by apologized and offered 2 appetizers and a warm happy birthday to my wife. Good recovery but for nearly an hour wait it just breaks things even and nothing more. Over server was great until we finished our entrees....By that time they must've made cuts on the floor as she had 5 tables and hadn't been by in quite some time. The aforementioned manager who did not seem to be very comfortable and did not speak walked over and cleared our plates...silently. Our server came by and offered dessert which we enjoyed and delivered our check promptly after finishing. All the food was amazing!!! 5 stars all the way. Service was a 4 but the initial wait was a 1. That's 10 total divided by 3 so they stood at a solid 3.3 stars. I say to my wife, \\"they get the ever elusive 4th star if a manager comes by and checks in one more time.\\" Yung did come by and had our check processed quickly but only thanked us and said happy birthday. This might seem like I'm being picky but when you're told the place is like that every night they should stop thinking their turn times are less than they really are. The wait and non talking manager were deal breakers. Yung was great and we thank him for trying. The food itself we will be back for but realize if you want to eat before 8 make your reservation for 630.\\n\\nWe will be back but just like the Seinfeld rental car episode,\\"they know how too take the reservation but not hold it.\\""},{"name":"Domino's Pizza","address":"743 Main St","city":"Winchester","stars":"2","text":"Ordered food at 10:50pm saying guaranteed delivery if order is placed by 11.

Unlike other cities I have been to, Columbus is lucky to have a place where dozens of food and specialty gift vendors are all under one roof.

There's definitely something for everyone!  \\n\\nI have also found myself studying upstairs from when I was a college student, and have brought my staff over for team-building sessions by reserving the conference room upstairs.

We went on Christmas Eve. We were sat right away by an older, short hair red head woman. She was short with us and didn't seem really friendly. When she brought our drinks, she filled the coffee mug with the pot 2 feet.. no kidding.. from the mug, splashing coffee on the table and my partners jacket. She then walked off. \\nAbout 10 minutes went by and we had to flag her down to get our orders. I ordered a salad and my partner ordered cheese sticks. Pretty simple. We sat and chatted for a bit and noticed others coming in and being seated, served drinks, placing their orders and receiving their food.. first. So we waited a bit more. Maybe they had to milk the cow or hand pick the tomatoes...  So, once we saw another table get sat, served and eat their food, we decided that 45 minutes to wait was too long. All we had was coffee and water, so we decided to pay for the coffee and just go somewhere else. \\n\\nWhen we asked for the check from someone else as our server was too busy laughing and cutting up at the front, we were approached by our server, who said, \\"They are putting the salad together now. You don't want to wait?\\" We said no, and that we would like our check. She then snapped at us, saying that it would be ready in a minute but if we didn't want it, fine. She then went to the line and yelled at the kitchen staff, \\"Never mind. They don't want it now.\\" She brought us our check and said \\"Here. Have a nice day,\\" then walked off. No apology, no smile... nothing. \\n\\nAs we approached the counter, the manager apologized to us for the wait. We explained that other tables, sat over 20 minutes after we placed our food order had already been served and finished their food, we just decided that we would leave. We didn't have time to wait all day, thus the light and simple order. As we paid, our server again went to the line and said something to the effect of, \\"no, they are leaving. They didn't want to wait.\\" To which a line cook yelled, loud enough to where I could hear it over 20 feet away, \\"This ain't no fast food restaurant!\\"  \\"I know,\\" said the server. My partner had to push me out of the place before he blew his top, and mine too. So, if this is read to the staff, here is a little tip.  I've worked in the service industry as a bartender. My partner is the Assistant Manager at a very well known and popular restaurant in Decatur. We know the difference between fast food and I-Hop. Drop the attitudes and do what you are paid to do. We are normally very generous tippers and very patient. We have both had bad days when at work and understand when folks get stressed out. We also know when a server forgot to put an order in. It wasn't the line cooks fault. It was the server. Her attitude sucked. She could have told us that she forgot and apologized for the error. We would have been fine with that. But instead, she copped an attitude, blamed us and disrespected not only her guests, but every person working there that day.  We will never return to this place. Consequently, we did go somewhere else. We went to another place just up the street. That server was great and in return, received a $20 tip on a $14 tab.

Is the pasta gone?  Replaced by a burger joint?\\n\\nWe walked down to Papi's and entered the same entryway but on the left, there is now a new place, an addition of sorts called the Mondo Burger Bar.\\n\\nA twist between an old style diner and modern dark woods, a bar that looked more like it belonged to Papi's or an actual bar.\\n\\nSo they're trying to gussy up what they call their award winning burgers.\\nI had to be keen, yes I was keen.  I love burgers and always willing to give  up on my dietary needs for some good greasy burgers.\\n\\nSo despite being confused as to what this place really was supposed to offer. I mean, I know it's burgers, but now it seems like fancy burgers.  And you can enjoy it with expensive beers.  The burgers were certainly pricey and you had to order fries separately.\\n\\nRight away I was thinking the owner was confused.  Maybe it was a few owners and a chef who wanted one thing and all decided to do something of their own.  In this case it didn't work.\\n\\nSo when it really comes down to it. it is the food.\\nSo lets talk about the now eh?\\n\\nMenu on a printed piece of 8x11 and folded.  Black and white.\\nClassy for such expensive burgers.  \\n\\nThe burgers ranged from $5.95 - 6 0z of ground chuck steak with Drive in Sauce (thousand island dressing) to $8.95 for a Kangaroo burger.  I wonder how many have tired it?\\n\\nWe ordered the Woodstock (vegetarian) for me and the Canuck for my pal.\\n\\nThen we decided to do it a bit healthier and got it in a bowl at no extra cost.\\n\\nThat means it comes in a bowl without the bun.  OK I liked the idea, and now you had to eat it with a knife and fork, but really, at no extra cost?\\nWTF??  Excuse my French here, but really?\\n\\nAt the time I thought it was cool.\\n\\nI sat in an area where I could watch the cooks prep the food.  The patties were cooked on a grill and the fries put in the deep fryer and  so on.  Unfortunately from the time that we ordered to the time they put the meat on the grill 15 minutes had elapsed. by  a half hour we got our fries with chili and cheese.\\n\\nThat was small for $4.95, but it wasn't really that. It was that it was extra to order a side of fries and to justify that I felt that I had to order the loaded fries to indulge my cholesterol.\\n\\nI enjoyed them cause I was famished.  My pal there, didn't . There wasn't much chili on the fries.  Or not enough for liking it.\\n\\nThe the couple next to us got their burgers and fries and Yam fries.  It was then at this point I decided to check Yelps reviews because I was worried that it wasn't going very well for us. It had to be an OFF night for them.  It was Sunday.  Shouldn't every restaurant to serves food to a paying public have an OFF night?\\n\\nYam fries are frozen and precut while the potato fries are done in house.\\n\\nSo, I checked our neighbours fries and the potato fries were done nicely, just like ours seated under our chili.  However their Yam fries looked like jagged spinters of dark brown burnt oak chips that sat in a smoker too long.\\n\\noh oh. they cooked them too long.  Doesn't the sugar in the Yam fries have an affect on their appearance?  They weren't happy with their burger and buns either.\\n\\nI got my Woodstock in a bowl and it was pretty good. Vegetarian; Portobello mushroom topped with caramelized onions, roasted peppers, and roasted garlic aioli.  On top of a small bed of salad greens, in a bow.\\nOh and yes I ordered it with a fried egg on top for a buck.\\nI did like my dish which would give it a 3.5 stars, but if I was wise enough to order it with a bun.\\n\\nbut...\\nThe Canuck came out sans' bun bacon was crispy, yes, Onion rings were non existent and there was no hint of BBQ sauce cause it was trying to cover up the hardest piece of fresh 60z ground chuck steak patty ever!  \\n\\nAhhh! I know. It was called the Canuck because - Canuck, - Canadian - Hockey team - Hockey puck.  The burger patty was an ode to the the puck.\\n\\n1 star for that burger. Sorry guys.  It just wasn't an award winning burger that night.\\n\\nSo instead of the two of us disapointed about our meals, it was four of us.\\nOur neighbours did not like their meal at all.\\n\\nOn a plus side the soda was great and I loved the lemon wedge.\\n\\nSad to say though, I wouldn't be coming again, unless someone else says that they have improved.\\n\\nSo it's not the cost of it all, it's the confusion and the execution in the food.\\n\\nAnd that's what it's all about really."},{"name":"Merguez Restaurant","address":"11951 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"We had lunch here twice while in the area for business.

There's a lot of effort that goes into having a date night--finding a babysitter, giving the babysitter all the instructions, trying to put your face and hair on while having four kids hanging on your legs, figuring out what to wear, etc... The last thing you want is to have a negative experience and bad food at an expensive restaurant.  Staplehouse did NOT disappoint.  \\nOur first dish was the trout, which presented much differently from what we expected.  It was a small amount of food on a huge plate for $18ish.  I initially thought we made a mistake coming down here until I took the first bite.  It was a burst of fresh, acidic flavors in my mouth.  The trout was not cooked, it was a tartar.  It was delicious and just the perfect portion for the first dish, although I didn't think so initially.\\nOur second dish was the bitter greens, which was by far the best salad I've ever had in my life.  A mix of bitter greens with a \\"crab broth\\" for the dressing.  It was the perfect combination of a little sweet and seafood savory.  I loved loved loved the hint of crab in the dressing, or \\"crab broth.\\"\\nThe chicken liver tart was probably our least favorite of the dishes.  It was very interesting that upon each bite I would get an unpleasant aroma of chicken liver, but as I kept chewing the aroma would disappear and then it would have a very pleasant taste.  I just had to get past that initial aroma with every bite.\\nThe potato bread came with an olive oil butter, which I had to use great restraint from using a spoon to scoop it into my mouth.  It was the best butter I've ever had!  The mushroom dish was quite tasty also.\\nFor our last courses we had the beef cheeks and snapper.  Both were so amazing.  The beef cheeks were so juicy and tender, it makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  It came with a side of fat foam (which I'm sure they had a much fancier name for it) that was so delicious.  The snapper was also so amazing.

I have given it several tries because I know sometimes you get a bad carhop or they get busy, etc. After five attempts, I am done. I will drive up to Polaris when I want Sonic from now on!! Some examples of issues I've seen/experienced: 1) when no cars or even one car, it will take at least 10-15 minutes for someone to take my order and another 10-15 to get it, this is for a simple drink order and I never get an apology for wait time. 2) I have ordered something easy, like a cherry limeade, and was given the wrong drink. I had to go back through the drive thru for my correct order and they did not apologize. Instead, rudely had my correct drink and close the window. 3) Waited so long to even place an order, that I drive off and go to another place for my drink. 4) Often can't tell it's even open because at night they don't turn on their lights 5) Waited so long that the car in front of me drove off before ordering and the car behind me drove off AFTER ordering. 6) the glass on every visible surface is disgustingly dirty. Makes you wonder what else they don't clean.  My husband wrote into corporate about our experiences. We got a nice call from the Manager Brooke about our experience thus far. She said they were under new management and asked us to give them one more try. Offered us \\"meal replacement.\\" We Waited in the drive thru for over 30 minutes, they didn't have our name on the replacement list, a younger gentleman spoke to us as if this was our fault and talked negatively about Brooke and they messed up our order. We tried! Don't judge all Sonics by this one. Promise! Im honestly not even sure how this one remains in business!"},{"name":"Sam's Restaurant","address":"36 School St","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"Since I like diners, and Sam's was within walking distance of my apartment, I tried to eat here twice.  Didn't actually manage it.\\n\\nThe first time, I was by myself.  I was also on crutches, from an accident.  The place's policy is, seemingly, that people by themselves must sit at the counter, however many tables are free (four of them, at that point).  I pointed out that I really couldn't sit on the counter's tall stools, and needed to extend my injured leg.  No dice.  So out I hobbled to IHOP -- happily, only two blocks away -- where they didn't care where I sat.\\n\\nThe second time I came in with my wife, 25 minutes before closing.  Now it's the LAW that a restaurant HAS to serve you, whether you come in 45 seconds before closing or not.  Still, they said they were \\"closing\\" and declined to serve us.  So out we went to IHOP, which seemed to feel that they were in the business of peddling food.\\n\\nThat aside, even by the low-rent standard of diners, this is a dreary, dingy place, and could stand with a fresh coat of paint, a bit of degreasing, better lighting, and for the linoleum to be pried up and burned out back.  (You might note that of the horde of pictures posted, only ONE is of the interior -- and it's a tilted, out of focus shot -- and most of those are posted by \\"Yelpers\\" who haven't actually posted any reviews.

Pretty much all of these places have patio seating & those pretty lights outside across the venue, so it's super laid back and chill at night time. Once first getting dropped off on this street, my boyfriend and I were immediately excited at our destination because it just gives off this really cool and welcoming, fun vibe.\\n\\nAs for Banger's itself, the place is big! There's a large outdoor seating with countless of bench tables and inside has a ton of bench tables too if you want to escape the heat. We saw a sign outside that stated that Banger's is expanding too, so it's only going to get bigger and better than it already is! During our stay, we decided to sit at the bar, which was a great idea.\\n\\nThe bartenders who work at this venue are VERY informative, welcoming, personable, and kind. Being total Austin noobs for our first real day there, they gave us so much advice about the restaurant and Austin in general, free beer samples, and made us feel at home.\\n\\nWe ended up getting the \\"Duck, Bacon, & Fig\\" and the \\"Jalapeno Cheddar Bratwurst\\", which are both on the 'Exotic' sausages menu, and we also got grits as an appetizer on the side. The \\"Duck, Bacon, & Fig\\" was considered unique and an acquired taste by the bartender, but honestly, this sausage combo was me and my boyfriend's favorite one. It was soooo good and the fig is the right amount of sweetness to complement the savory sausage. It was seriously amazing and I would highly recommend that one! The \\"Jalapeno Cheddar Bratwurst\\" was good too and the sausage was juicy and perfect, but if you're not very good with spicy food, this was pretty spicy to both me and my bf. That particular sausage combo had stringy jalapeno garnished on top of the sandwich and we had to take it off because we could not handle the heat! (maybe we're just wussies). The grits were really good too as a side - probably one of the better grits I've had!\\n\\nThe really cool thing about this place too is that they have an incredibly large selection of beers on draft. I believe there's over 100? I ended up picking the Electric Jellyfish IPA from one of the local Austin restaurant breweries and I loved it, esp. pairing it with the sausages. The bartenders are generous and patient with allowing you to try samples too, which is awesome.\\n\\nOverall, the ambience, the food, the size, and location of this restaurant will forever be memorable to me. It was the first place that wow'd me in Austin and I'd definitely return :)"},{"name":"Bistro Niko","address":"3344 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Very good food.

When first walking into the Greek temple-like building, I was overwhelmed by the myriad of food vendors, displaying a variety of appetizing choices from lobster rolls to pizza to Boston cream pie. Was I in food heaven? I found difficulty choosing one vendor to order from (just cause everything looked and smelled wonderful) but knowing that Boston was notorious for fresh seafood, I wanted to base my meal off shrimp, lobster, etc. One food came to mind- clam chowder! I've only had clam chowder a couple times in my life, so I was not exactly sure what to expect or how to judge. La Pasteria was where I ordered my food, and their clam chowder apparently was the \\"best\\"; the creamy and warm texture of the soup, along with the bread bowl bread was a delectable combination to my, and my whole family's, taste. I also ordered the Shrimp Alfredo Tortellini from La Pasteria, which not only came in a large portion size, but was more than enough to fill me and my sister up. The cheese inside of the tortellini was a perfect cheesiness to compliment the spinach in the pasta. I am not a fan of cheese, but I was not bothered by the filling.

They serve the food almost by tossing it into your plate, except with flawless execution (not a grain of rice was to be missed!!). Although we all enjoyed the experience as a whole, I am forced to give it 3 stars. I made a reservation weeks in advance for 8:30 PM. We were not seated until 10:30 PM that evening. We waited awkwardly in the hallway for 2 hours, in the way of all the wait staff and servers. And they gave me a buzzer to hold to signal when my table is ready.. Why even take reservations if I'm still going to have to wait? Why did I even make a reservation? Halfway through the awkward hallway-waiting, we were redirected to go the bar downstairs and that our table was being prepared now- 45 minutes after that conversation is when we were seated.

My first impression of the place was not terribly favorable- $4+ for a taco? $6 for queso? The decor is pretty sleek and modern, which is a nice change from the primary colors that so many Mexican places splash about with abandon. \\nThe chips and salsas- one green, one red, were free, and pretty solidly tasty. I think the red could use a little more cilantro and onion, but it lacked any hint of canned tomato ickiness and I couldn't stop eating it, so that's a win.\\n\\nMy mom got the grilled shrimp and buffalo chicken tacos and raved about both (and she's hard to please!) I also tried a bite of each and agree they were good, and also absolutely stuffed with goodness.\\n\\nI got the calamari taco and the grilled chicken taco, the calamari taco was good, the sweet chili sauce adding lots of flavor. The grilled chicken, however, was terrible. Had a strange, watery taste that others have mentioned. But! I was very pleasantly surprised, when I mentioned the problem to our sweet, helpful waitress and she brought over her manager, Walt, he was very concerned that the flavor was so bad and offered to get me another taco! I got the pulled pork and it was absolutely delicious, hot, meaty, juicy, with crisp slaw and spicy bbq sauce! Seriously freaking good. Plus, when we got the check, the manager had taken off the chicken taco and comped the pork one, which was incredibly sweet of him, and as we were leaving, he and the other manager woman on the floor made sure the substitution had been to my liking and seemed genuinely pleased with how happy we were. Plus, since we had to rush out, our waitress got us some drinks to go as well.\\n\\nSo, in conclusion: while the prices might look too high for this casual place, 2 tacos will probably leave you stuffed (mom and I both showed up really hungry, and with the larger-than-average size of the tacos and the chip refills, you should be good to go!) and if you have problems with your food, just tell your server!

We were seated quickly, we got to the restaurant at about the same time as usual. Crowd size was about as can be expected at 11:45 am. I am just going to itemize our complaints:\\n\\n1) It took about 5 minutes to get someone to our table...just to have him throw us our coasters. I can understand sometimes waiters throw down your coasters in a playful \\"ninja star\\" type fashion. We are totally down for that. This was not that. They were thrown at us, they flew everywhere and some fell into our laps. We bit our tongues. \\n\\n2) Guy says he will be back. 10+ minutes, he DOES in fact come back. We had been waiting for so long to even get  the chance to give our drink order, that we ordered our meals with our beverages: \\"Water; and a soup and sandwich combo\\".  We didn't want to give him the chance to disappear for another 10 minutes. Guy takes order. Leaves.\\n\\n3) Guy brings waters, decently fast enough.\\n\\n4) 45+ minutes go by. I shit you not. 45 minutes before our food comes out. We contemplated leaving, but we had gotten this far, and selecting another place would put us even further behind. We all took out our phones and promptly started sending emails to our coworkers: \\"Hey, we are taking a little longer on lunch, we will be back in the office as soon as we can.\\" Food comes out. We scarf it down. Those of us that got soup didn't even get to finish the bread bowl because we had to leave. \\n\\n5) Note: during the 45 minute wait, we saw no sign of life...no water refills, nothing. Not even a heads up, like \\"Hey, I am sorry about the wait.\\" \\n\\n6) Getting the server to bring us our check took another 10 minutes. \\n\\n7) Getting him to run our cards and bring us the receipts to sign was actually the quickest thing that happened. \\n\\n- I would have complained sooner, but complaining before food comes out is a no-no in my book (not that anyone at Gourmands would do anything horrible to our food...it is just a precaution).

Passing through the main building, you'll see the 101 taps on the back wall and a well-appointed beer hall that is at once cavernous and inviting, rife with patrons chatting animatedly over brats and brews. The hostess will seat you or lead you out to the backyard and hand you a rather daunting menu. The beers are grouped helpfully, served with attention to glassware, and poured from the modern bierhaus aesthetic of the tap wall.\\n\\nPerusing the sausage menu, there were quite a few I wanted to try, but I ended up with the Boerewors, a South African spiced blend of pork and beef. Through the Banger's methodology, you pick your sausage, then your bun, then from an array of toppings and condiments. My Boerewors on a kolache bun with caramelized onions, sauerkraut, spicy mustard, and curry ketchup was quite frankly a thing of beauty. On this multiple choice test, I came up aces. The spices played well together, and the savory sausage against the sweet kolache bun made an excellent contrast.\\n\\nOnly open about a week, there are still some kinks to be worked out at Banger's. First, they were out of a few specialty beers, but more than a few of their menu items. I had wanted to order the antelope and venison merguez (gone) on a pretzel bun (86ed), the new staff had trouble keeping the 100+ beers straight, and there was a mysterious peanut in our chili cheese fries. All of these critiques become infinitesimal though when viewed in the larger perspective of the place's potential energy, rather than just the actual kinetic energy of the pistons firing now. What's more, the staff was eager to rectify any oversight or mistake, and couldn't have been more attentive. Gregarious too, glad to chat with us and gauge whether we liked the place - which is easy to do: impressive tap list, robust, piquant snausages, old-world beer hall, dog-friendly biergarten, and a live-music-ready dais.

I was on Rainey for a Texas Exes Alumnis pub crawl later in the day. It was sunny and cool so it was perfect weather to be outside and enjoy Bangers. They have many picnic tables outside and it is dog friendly. Its fun to see other's dogs enjoy the outside with their humans as well.  I believe it is on Sundays when they have live music which is pretty entertaining. Those who are brave also dance so it is also fun to watch. As for the drinks, I always go for the manmosa. It is a great value and you get a huge mug of mimosa that you can share, or in my case, drink all yourself. It usually lasts me my whole meal as well. \\nThe food is good. I was devastated to learn that they no longer serve the cheesy grits as they were like eating a soft, puffy, cheesy cloud. I opted for the poutine. My boyfriend who has been to Montreal did say that while, obviously the poutine is Montreal is superior, that this poutine was the closest he's had to it outside of there so that a plus. He said the main difference was that here the cheese was melted whereas there it is mostly in cheese curd form.For me, who has nothing to compare it to, it was pretty delicious to mix the fries with the cheese and the gravy. \\nI will admit that I do not do well with spicy foods. \\n\\nMy first time I went there, I asked the server which sausage he recommended and assured me it wasn't spicy. He didn't know that I am a legit baby when it comes to spice so I couldn't handle the slightest kick. I don't typically like to send things back, especially if its what I had ordered but when the server asked a friend of mine admitted that it was too hot for me and he graciously brought me a different one which was not spicy at all and very delicious. I remember I had the duck one but I don't remember whether it was the spicy one or not.\\n\\nMost recently though, I went with a safe choice - the bratwurst - and it was good. It was the perfect food to fill up on before a pub crawl. \\n\\nI would also like to add that they have a wide variety of selections of beers on draft. It can be overwhelming but the staff is very knowledgeable and wiling to help you pick one that is right for you.

The rest of the staff is cool but Gabe had an air of honesty about him that I appreciated when offering suggestions or apologies. The only time he lied to me was when I asked him was the meat reheated and he said no but then explained that the meat was slow cooked for 6 hours earlier and then reheated per plate... which is unacceptable for the price point.\\n\\nThe food is... mildly ok and borderline unacceptable, especially for the price point. With mains averaging around $27 and appetizers averaging $12  (in Atlanta) I totally expected  to have a meal worthy of happiness but what I got was a cold appitizer and a pork shoulder dish with reheated meat. The oysters and shrimp starter was not at all warm, borderline cold and literally tasteless aside from the clams themselves which were moist and somewhat flavorful. The pork shoulder was obviously reheated in some form right at the first bite and it made me so totally disgusted that I couldn't even try the loin. \\n\\nWorst part is the manager never even came over to talk to me about the experience after, so I guess the $22 + tip that I just spent on a cold appetizer and a bottle of club Soda made me unworthy of a conversation.

The service was awesome as per usual but then the salad of doom was placed in front of me. I ordered a simple Caesar salad. It was warmish when it arrived, but I did not think anything of it until later on that evening. While I was in class I started to have horrible stomach pain and lets just say I had to leave in a hurry and spent most of my time for the rest of the evening not in class. I will spare you the details. \\n\\nOf course I brushed this off thinking well maybe someone accidentally left the dressing out and it was a just a mistake. It probably would never happen again and I would not even bother complaining because it was just a mistake and I have worked in the service industry for years and still do and little mistakes happen all of the time. \\n\\nThat brings us to today, I did not even get to order. I went in during my lunch hour. It was busy and there were a few tables open. It is usually a seat yourself place with a relaxed atmosphere except during lunch hour where they usually have some sort of wait and the servers seat you. So, I was standing by the sign waiting for a table, I was dinning by myself. A server came up and asked where I would like to sit and I said there was a table in the back that looked appealing and she responded that the bar would be a better choice. I did not want to sit at the bar. When I told her this she got a little annoyed and did not hide it well and pretty much rolled her eyes at me and said \\"I guess that would be ok.\\" The table I wanted to sit at seated two, it was a small table and sure I would be taking one extra seat away, but there was no one waiting for a table behind me and it appeared they had a four top right next to the table I requested so I thought it was not that big of a deal. Her tone was so rude, while I was walking to the table I said \\"fuck it\\" and left.\\n\\nNormally, I would brush this off thinking it was just a fluke and that server was having a bad day and my request was just adding to that. But, then I thought no. After yesterday with the salad incident I could not seem to let it go. \\n\\nLike I said I have worked in the service industry for years and it is a hard job that requires you to be nice to people or at least hide your annoyance with the general public in clever ways. You do not have to be overly nice, hell you do not even have to smile, I sometimes don't, but you do not have to be so rude when someone has a simple request. It is not like I was asking for a booth, which used to annoy the shit out me when I was hostess...So yeah, this place went from a conveniently located place for mediocre food and coffee, to a place I would never step in to again or recommend to anyone.

The cheesesteak that showed up was soupy and tasted a bit sour (probably bc of the peppers) - it was like the meat and cheese were just mixed together and the whole thing was a peachy-colored paste. We were disappointed but didn't over think it too much, maybe that was how they're made out here? But then! We saw the photos other yelpers posted and man, that's nothing like what we got at all! Not sure if they changed cooks or they're training something but definitely inconsistent. My fiance was very disappointed. \\n\\nThe Italian Grinder was pretty good - the olive oil on the bread was a little too much for me but this is definitely a sandwich that you had to eat all in one bite - if you pick the meat out, it's too salty and if you peel the bread to eat the olive oil was too much. A good combo of flavors, I'd recommend first timers try this...judging from other yelpers' pictures it's pretty consistent.\\n\\nMini Mary (their bloody mary) and the salty greyhound were decent - do not get the salty greyhound if you do not like the salty/sour combo..you've been warned. \\n\\nRedemption came in the form of the shoestring fries! I know I know, that sound ridiculous but best thing I had here. Well-seasoned with a tiny bit of kick (think curly fries) and not too skinny, not too fat. They were not soggy or over - fried but definitely crisp...if I was by myself I would have licked that plate. Best $3 spent ever. Get these!\\n\\nOverall, pretty pricy sandwiches but chill Portland atmosphere.

I've been here a few times before, so today's visit was utterly unappealing.   We walked in 10 mins before the late night happy hour and we were asking to wait till 9pm to be seated.  We were asked to wait at the sushi bar till a smaller table opened up, as only larger tables were available.  Other people were coming in after us, and we noticed that two other tables of two were seated.   We were then given menus at the bar and we reminded the hostess that she had asked us to sit at the sushi bar to wait for the table.   She then said we could wait for the next available table.  We got to the restaurant on purpose so that we didn't have to wait, and now we were expected to wait after other ppl were seated before us out of turn.\\nLet me also add, that as we were waiting at the sushi bar, I could not help but look around me.  When was the last time they dusted, cleaned and sanitized this place?!  I'm all for cool decor, but if I can see 2cm of dust built up on the decor..... Yuck!    I looked down and saw dirty rags underneath where I was sitting, the floor was dirty and sticky, and as I looked in the little sushi refrigerator... I realized that it wasn't actually on.... So raw fish was in the little refrigerator, thawing out and probably rotting.  This is such a same because the food in past has been decent.  This really is a hole in the wall.

Deep flavors and heavy, but welcome on a winter evening.\\n- Loup de Mer (Sea Bass, Citrus Emulsion, Fingerling Potatoes - $26): Excellent cook and no 'fishy' taste on this lighter, non-guilt inducing dish.\\n- Tarte Au Citron (Meringue Br√ªl√©e, Mandarin Orange Sorbet - $8): Favorite desert, citrus was nice palate cleanser.\\n- Creme Brulee a la Vanille ($8): Had hoped for more vanilla flavor in the custard, I don't recall the vanilla bean being all that perceptible to the eye or palate.            \\n\\nNot usually worth a comment, but I have to say the warm bread and butter served to start were excellent and addictive!    \\n\\nBeverage\\nGreat job on the wine list here, with many excellent (French focused) wines offered at quite reasonable pricing.

These are more geared towards families. The other class is the romantic/business steakhouse that serves a $40-60 and up prime steak a la carte. Ruth's Chris has all the trappings of a $20-30 steakhouse, but they serve a (legit) $50 steak. I had a ribeye and was able to try a filet. Both were superb, very tender, extremely flavorful and nearly perfectly seasoned. My only critique is that they were just slightly on the salty side, but I much prefer that to under seasoned.\\n\\nThe steaks at Ruth's Chris are as good, or better than, any of the famous steakhouses in Buckhead, Bone's, Chops, Hal's, etc. But, the accompaniments and service fall short of the competition. The good news is that the appetizers, sides, etc. are appropriately priced.\\n\\nWe tried the onion rings, creamed spinach, shoestring fries, and mushrooms. All were decent, but not great, except for the onion rings which were pretty bad. They were so thickly breaded that the onions were essentially raw on the inside.\\n\\nThe salads were very standard except for the chopped salad which was very good.\\n\\nThe desserts reminded me very much of the desserts at a \\"neighborhood bar and grill\\" like a Chili's. Not becoming of a high quality restaurant. The two we had were both identically shaped cakes with a sauce in the middle. Now, I know that most restaurants, even really good restaurants, buy their desserts from a vendor since they don't staff a pastry chef. But good restaurants try to personalize them some way with a garnish or a presentation. The desserts at Ruth's Chris seemed like they were popped out of a box from the freezer, mircrowaved and brought to the table.\\n\\nI'd go back for sure, especially if someone else were paying, but I'd just get a chopped salad and a steak."},{"name":"The Original Dinerant","address":"300 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Dear Original,\\nEver since I visited you for breakfast with my sister 2 years ago, you've been one of my favorite places for a quick and delicious breakfast in downtown Portland.

I further explained that the server was not doing a good job...taking only 3 orders at a time when he should be taking everyone's orders (yes, all 20 guests!)  Ben responded with \\"don't tell me how to run my staff\\" & then he threw his hands up & said, \\"It's not my fault your party reserved 10 instead of 20!\\"  (WHAT??)  \\"I'm a guest here, not the organizer,\\" I said, \\"& it doesn't matter how many people arrived, WE NEED SERVICE!\\" \\n\\nHere's the KICKER...\\nBen continued with \\"Go back to your table, take a seat, order some food and then we'll serve you a drink.\\"  (WOW!!!

Let's face it Weymouth Massachusetts isn't really well-known for its culinary hotspots so this place is a very welcome addition to the neighborhood. There is an amazing variety of flavors. The Chef creates dishes from all over the world hence the name passport. It's primarily a tapas style theme with varying sizes of small plates, taster,s teasers and appetizers. I do believe these are the different categories on the menu. If you're looking for full entr√©es they have those as well I believe it's listed under \\"splits\\" section of the menu. I enjoy the service very much we've been there twice already and we've had excellent experiences. In fact our first time there was a Friday and we enjoyed it so much we were actually planning on going back the very next day. Very few restaurants have I ever felt that way about. The reason is they were so many other items on the menu that my wife and I Wanted to try that we didn't get a chance to on Friday. I've enjoyed everything we've eaten at passport the only item I could critique is the bi bim bap which is a Korean sort of rice bowl. My wife is Korean and I've been spoiled in authentic Korean food and I am a big fan of bi bim bap. I still Found it to be quite tasty and I ate every little bit of it but it is more of an interpretation of authentic bibimbap. I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from ordering it and trying it I am simply comparing it to what I've been having for years. We love the hush puppies with the cayenne honey butter. Also for dessert last time we tried the basil ice cream which sounds funky and I almost didn't order it but I'm so glad I did because it was out of this world !! We've tried many other things and they were fantastic these are just a couple items off the top of my head. My wife and I plan to be regulars here, I wish this restaurant much success."},{"name":"Cha Yen Thai Cookery","address":"613 Mt Auburn St","city":"Watertown","stars":"4.5","text":"I can see why Cha Yen won Best Thai Restaurant from Boston Magazine in 2016! Everything I had was so delicious!!\\n\\nI started with the shrimp donuts. It's like eating shrimp toast without the actual toast. It came with a delicious sweet sauce for dipping. \\n\\nThen I shared the Sukothai with beef and the Marinated duck breast. The Sukothai had egg noodles (or you could choose rice noodles) topped with a fish cake, fish balls, green beans, peanuts, a soft boiled egg, and lovely slices of beef. I'm a little so-so on the fish ball texture, but the flavors were really wonderful. The duck was marinated in a really delicious brown sauce and came with broccolini, a marinated soft boiled egg, and rice. If I hadn't been so full at the end of the meal, I would have dumped the leftover rice right in the sauce and eaten it like that. \\n\\nIt's a pretty small, cozy place. The tables are close together and the people seated next to us were pretty friendly-- I was complimented on my shirt and asked what I had ordered when it came to the table.

If only I could give this no stars, I would.\\n\\nGinza claims to have an all you can sushi buffet for $30, and for an extra $5 option, it includes all you can drink beer.  A group of us went there to try out this deal recently and this was disappointing at best.\\n\\nAt first impression, the service was good and the food was on par with what you would expect to be low-mid-range sushi joint.  The server came by the table and served us several rounds of beer, and a first sizable round of sushi and hot appetizers and entrees.  After that though, the service severely dropped off to nonexistent and avoidance.\\n\\nThe server and (what I presume) the manager (owner) completely avoided our table fearing us ordering another round of sushi and beer.  When we finally got the attention of a bartender, we placed an order of beverages and food with him.  Shortly after, the sushi chef had a loud argument with the manager (owner) to what I assume to be due to the lack of staff as he was the only sushi chef on the line.  It was extremely uncomfortable and we ended up canceling our second round of food and drinks.\\n\\nAnd the kicker and the slap in the face was when the bill came.  They automatically added an 18% gratuity to the bill.  Ok, we were a party of 5, but most places only add this when there's a party of 6 or more.  I wouldn't be so pissed to pay that gratuity if (1) there was some *actual* service and (2) it wasn't such a crappy dining experience.\\n\\nAvoid this place especially if you're doing this buffet.

It's not what I would think of as authentic knowing what I know about Thailand and I didn't like everything I ordered but I thought it is very well executed and the chef put a lot of care into the food. We started with the roti, which is very similar to a Chinese scallion pancake, which was very good. Then we ordered the chicken satay which came with two sauces that paired extremely well with the tender chicken skewers. They were not as heavy as the sauces you may find at other Thai restaurants and tasted like they were crafted in house. We also got the crispy poh piah which I didn't particularly like since I felt the filling wasn't very substantial and it was mostly wrapper. Maybe next time I will try the fresh poh pia. We also got an order of the corn cakes were very unique and it wasn't something I've seen before. One order is quite large and although it was delicious, it is very easy to get full off these lightly batter corn fritters. I wish they offered a half order since even though they were very good, all that chewing of the corn can be tiresome and by the third piece I was ready to move on to another dish. If you have 4 or 5 people it would be a perfect size though (problem is it's a pretty small place and most tables only seat 2 people). We also got an order of the Pad Kee Mao with pork and it was very good. The flavor was relatively light and the texture of the noodles were very chewy which is a key characteristic of this Thai dish. I probably wouldn't order it with the pork again since the meat was quite dry and didn't complement the noodles at all, it's probably safest to go with the tofu but the quality of the noodles still saved the dish. I ended the meal with their house made black sesame ice cream which was more of a sorbet and lacked the creaminess one thinks of when they order ice cream but it tasted very clean and natural. I've read that this restaurant has been open for a few years now and am very impressed that they have been able to keep the quality of their food at this level. I've also read that it is mostly a delivery and take-out joint which I think is a shame since they have a very beautiful interior and offered a great dining ambiance.

We turned our extended family onto this place and now it's all they want to do, eat and drink at the Black Horse. Check it out.

Being that I am always open to visiting new cities, I agreed.  When researching places to eat in Atlanta, Staplehouse constantly came up, so I knew I had to try it.  As mentioned by other reviewers, the reservation process was competitive and things get scooped up quickly.  I managed to secure a 5:30pm reservation on a Friday, not ideal but better than nothing.\\n\\nWhen we finally got to Staplehouse, I was amazed at the beautiful space.  Plenty of regular seating, open kitchen where you see the staff at work and the bar at the far end of the restaurant.  We were kindly greeted by the host and she even knew I had traveled from California to pay a visit [ little things count! ].  After a brief introduction with recommendations from the waitress, we dove in and ordered the following:\\n\\n1. Chicken liver tart\\n2. Foie gras \\n3. Cabbage\\n4. Trout\\n5. Aged pork\\n\\nThe chicken liver tart was served with green strawberry, ginger and pecan.  I was in the form of a pie which was interesting.  It was something I'd never tasted before but in a good way.  I love chicken liver and was impressed the way it was presented.  Along with the tart came the foie gras.  This was served with sorrel, radish and hoshigaki.  It was a salad-like dish of sorts.  The foie gras blended well with the other ingredients.  Next came my favorite dish, the cabbage.  The cabbage was served with sake bushi, rice and mussel broth.  When you think of cabbage you think of a simple vegetable with limited flavors but the way Staplehouse served it changed my mind.  Each piece of cabbage packed so much juicy favor and was extremely tender.  I forgot I was even eating cabbage and thought i was eating some sort of braised meat.  This dish was simply light and delicious.  The last two dishes was the trout and the aged pork.  The trout was served with kale, watercress, roe and dill.  It came with the fish skin which added a different texture to the dish.  The pork, conversely, was served with ramps, spring onion and hominy.  The aged pork was extremely tender and melted in my mouth.  Both dishes were unique takes on simple fish and meat dishes [trout and pork] but both tasted fresh and deliciously executed.\\n\\nFrom top to bottom, each and every dish at Staplehouse was thoroughly thought out and outstandingly created.  You can taste the care and detail applied to each dish.  One of the best meals I've had in 2017."},{"name":"Serranos","address":"5030 Hwy 290 W","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"My family loves this place.

Also ordered the Meat Mazawat (I know, it's an absurd amount of food).  Fantastic way to try a lot of different things.  Labne was pronounced \\"good\\" by our dining companion (who grew up with his Lebanese grandmother, she made her own, of course).

I LOVE Tim Hortons and was so excited for this location to open, but I will likely never go back. I understand that it is a new location, but if you are not ready to be open and can't provide adequate service, then don't open. After waiting 30 minutes in line in the drive thru (there were only 4 cars in front of us), we finally got to the menu. We were told to wait for a minute, and we did. We ordered a large double/double, a medium double/double, BELT (bagel, egg, lettuce, tomato sandwich), everything bagel with cream cheese and a donut. We were given our food and we left because due to the long wait, we were already late. The large coffee was luke warm at best, the medium coffee was ICE cold. The BELT sandwich had no lettuce or tomato and was cold, and the everything bagel had barely any cream cheese. So after paying 11 dollars for breakfast, we had to stop at another Tim Hortons on our way to our destination (our meal at the other TH was perfect!)

If I did that when I was a kid my mother would've smacked me.  They're doing nothing.   Actually, they're crooning.\\n\\nThen she starts running up and down the length of the restaurant, right by my table, so fast and so hard the floor under my chair is vibrating.  Up and down, up and down the length of the restaurant.  There was also circling and climbing.  And nobody is doing ANYTHING, not the mother, not the aunt, not the manager, not the waitresses.  This wasn't one of those situations where you give mom a break because being a mom is hard.  Kid was literally running around the entire (otherwise quiet) restaurant and mom didn't care.  I'd figured out by now they were related to the manager.  Oh, I see, since you're related to the management you're allowed to let your kid run wild when nobody else would allow their child to behave like that, and too bad about the paying customers who are here with the valid expectation, seeing as how this is NOT a family joint at 7 PM, that they're not going to have to deal with misbehaved children.  \\n\\nManager notices I'm exasperated, so he grabs the kid and puts her on a bar stool without actually saying anything to her.  Then he goes back to talking to her mother.  Next thing the kid does is grab a toothpick off the bar, jump down, and start running by my table over and over again with it in her hand.\\n\\nSo NOW I'm distracted because this kid is going to hurt herself, and I'm debating what to do about it since mom's (and the manager is) completely ignoring her.  Some of the waitresses have been giving me anxious faces because they know I'm pissed.\\n\\nFinally I snap.  I would have walked out except my food had already come.  So I get up, mumble to myself \\"I can't take this anymore\\" and start moving my shit to a different table.  One of the waitresses rushes over and offers to help me move my food.  The brunette lady at the booth finally grabs the girl into the booth and apologizes, so I sit back down.\\n\\nBut then the mom looks over at me from her booth and goes in accented English \\"what's your problem?\\"  So I look at her and say, \\"what's my problem?\\" and then she tells me to come over to her booth so she can hear me.  EXCUSE ME - you're the one who wants to confront me about the fact that you can't control your child, how bout you get up?  But whatever, I go over, start explaining myself in a calm voice and she interrupts me and starts bitching at me, won't let me get a word in, about how the kid's only 3 and what do I expect from a child and the kid doesn't know any better.  She pulls that \\"are you a mother?\\" crap on me.  As though I don't know good parenting from the way my mother raised me and watching my three cousins and their babies (they would be aghast).  She was a piece of work - black track suit, flashy gold jewelry, perfect makeup, blonde hair in a bun, tan skin.\\n\\nSo when I finally get a chance to speak I calmly explain to this bitch that when I was a kid my family ate out every night and my MOTHER made sure that I behaved myself.  The other lady starts talking, too- I'm a psychologist, I'm so sorry, don't pay any attention to my friend, she's just being a mom, sit next to me, my husband is the manager and he'll give you a discount - I try explaining it has nothing to do with the money - and they're BOTH TALKING TO ME AT ONCE.  Meanwhile manager has come over and is just standing there not saying a word while these two talk at me.  And the nice one is TOUCHING ME.  OMG, no, American - three feet, three feet.  I would much rather have gotten into a fight with blondiemom, who clearly cares more about her Chanel purse (don't think I didn't notice) than her kid.  This whole time the kid is UNDER the table - and I can just think what my mother would've said to me about that.  Finally the kid comes out so I start talking to her because, what, I'm going to stand there and bitch out her mom in front of her?  I get her to give me the toothpick.\\n\\nThe nurturing psychologist lady won't leave me alone, keeps apologizing, manager-man is uncomfortable and telling her to leave it, finally asks her to talk to him outside, I go back to my table, scarf my food ASAP, and ask one of the waitresses for my (large) bill.  They bring it -full price -, I pay exactly 15% tip, and a waitress brought me a free mochi - I think that was her own idea, and I bail.

So we went last night for the grand opening.\\n\\nWe opted for the hibachi experience since we wanted to see how Osaka would measure up. We were seated right away, and the staff leading us to the table was plentiful (we were \\"passed of\\" from the hostess to another gentleman to another girl en route to seating). Unfortunately, as you'll know, the art of owning a hibachi restaurant is trying to fill up the hibachi table so that you can feed the most customers but not make them wait too long. We waited for probably twenty minutes before two other couples were seated at our hibachi table. By then, we were ready to place our orders, and it would have been nice for the waitress to offer to take our drink orders and orders for appetizers.\\n\\nWe had the Hidden Dragon roll for an appetizer. The sushi came out beautifully and was pretty tasty, although we will remain true fans to Fin's sushi for our sushi fix. Their house salads were pretty tasty, although beware that the gigantic dinner fork is probably too large for the salad bowl. For dinner, my husband ordered the filet mignon & lobster tail. I ordered the filet mignon & scallops. The filet on both our meals was cooked perfectly. Served hot and amazingly tender. My scallops were to die for (I wondered aloud about ordering just scallops next time), but my husband's lobster tail was tough and overcooked. The hibachi chef gave everyone at the table two pieces of shrimp as a \\"hibachi appetizer\\" and to our surprise (compared to other hibachi experiences), the shrimp was perfectly cooked and amazing with their seafood dipping sauce.\\n\\nThe hibachi was definitely entertaining, especially if you've never had the experience before. As experienced hibachi diners, my husband and I weren't overwhelmed by Osaka's take on it. The chef was friendly and his tricks and the show he put on was definitely on par with other hibachi chefs we've dined with in the past. He made the fried rice first, followed by protein and then vegetables. It's always an odd eating experience because you never know whether to wait for the next item or dig in while it's hot!\\n\\nThe hibachi chefs we observed last night (ours included) seemed to perform two common tricks requiring audience participation. One involved small pieces of melon that the chef would flick at each diner to see if he/she could catch it in his/her mouth. Unfortunately, sometimes they stacked the dice (or melon in this case), so you had three or four pieces of melon coming at you. The other trick involves doing a \\"shot\\" of sake. They put some sake in their fried rice and the hibachi chef will ask if you want some... he then proceeds to pour sake from his squeeze bottle toward your mouth until you signal for him to stop. Both of these tricks were a huge hit with younger diners around the restaurant. I didn't mind the melon flick, but I do have to warn you that if you're dressed to the nines, you might want to rethink participating if your clothes are dry clean only. My husband and I didn't partake in the sake offerings, and I think our hibachi chef probably thought we were crazy for declining free sake (He kept saying, \\"Free sake is always good!\\").\\n\\nThe wait staff is plentiful. There were a million of them in Osaka shirts running around clearing plates, filling water glasses, and picking up any stray food items that didn't make it into diners' mouths. Having said that, however, I was disappointed in the service experience. As I've mentioned, they could have taken drink/appetizer orders for diners waiting for the hibachi table to fill up. Secondly, no one seems to know who's table is whose. When one of our tablemates asked the closest waitress for another drink from the bar, the waitress looked very frazzled to find our assigned waitress to come back to take the order. Also, our waitress seemed unfamiliar with the menu; she had to look at each item we ordered (drinks and appetizers). When the table asked for the check, it took a good ten to fifteen minutes for them to come back with our credit card receipts.\\n\\nLastly, the ambience. If you're going for an intimate setting where you can hear each other, you might want to try the table side of the restaurant. The hibachi side is so loud between the hibachi chefs' shows and the crowd that you have to shout to hear your dinner partner.\\n\\nWill we be back?

I mean enough for some of the staff and manager to recognize us (not an easy thing since they see like a thousand different customers a day) and even though we do frequent it, it isn't because it's the best Chinese place nor the best dim sum place in town.\\n\\nIn fact, the dim sum falls kinda short as far as variety goes. We end up always eating the same 5 dishes cuz all the other ones we tried were either 'meh' or 'never again' \\n(but their fried calamari, beef noodle rolls, egg custard buns, sesame balls, and the beef wrapped in bean curd are spot on delish)\\n\\nThe thing is though: these guys are FAST! None of that waiting for 1hour like Wong's King. You walk in, they seat you, someone brings you tea and water and the carts pull right up to you, within minutes of arrival. You can always order something off the menu (and for some odd reason, they also serve some Korean, Malay, Thai, Vietnamese food in addition to the Chinese. So if you have a large party of people who can't seem to decide on what they want to eat, this is the place to go.)\\n\\nThe fried rice and the usual Chinese American fare is pretty decent and service is efficient if not sometime gruff. (you want doggy bags? Bam. Somebody comes and wraps those babies up in seconds. Sure, no big smile or \\"is there anything else I can get you folks sort of banter but hey, it's a Chinese place, not your local diner) \\nAnd the place is pretty loud, not due to music but the sheer # of people in the room (it's a really large restaurant) so no problem for us cuz we got two rowdy boys.\\n\\nIt's also nice not to have to drive 20 miles out to SE 82nd since we live close by Jin Wah.\\n\\nIf you've got kids, drop by the Petco (or was it Petsmart) that shares the parking lot after your meal and kill some time.

The mild chili, AKA \\"X\\" i got was too chunky with large peices of meat that were too dry for me personally.

Despite the 18th St. address, the front of the store actually sits on 17th 1/2 St, across from the 271 17th St. office tower and nearby to Dillard's department store.

The service here is good.\\n\\nThe featured $5 Footlong this month (June) is the Chipotle Chicken & Cheese.  It consists of strips of grilled chicken with red onion and Subway's \\"Chipotle Southwest\\" sauce, which has a smoky flavor.

In the US, the Northern style is prevalent with strong, pungent flavors. Southern food is different; it's delicate, more subtly spiced, usually hotter and coconut milk is used frequently. Go at lunch for the buffet as it's the best bargain and you'll get to sample food representative of different States. It's all vegetarian but meat-eaters, you won't miss the meat. If you think that vegetarian food is lacking in flavor, Madras Pavilion will change your mind.\\n\\nFor all of its positives, there are a few negatives. Service can be spotty but it's always cordial. I love chai, it's one of my favorite drinks. Here, unfortunately, I cannot recommend it. In India, it's made by boiling the tea, spices, milk and sugar together; here the sugar is left out, which makes a huge difference. Lastly, the masala dosa was soggy rather than crisp, despite my request to fry it in ghee.\\n\\nBut don't let those few things dissuade you from going to Madras Pavilion.

We were familiar with many of their beers going in, having them available in St Louis.  I normally don't rate beers, it is such a personal thing.

Luckily it was on par with the best \\"chips 'n salsa\\" Mexican joints in PDX, and reasonably cheap too.\\n\\nThe building is pretty cool and unique looking from the outside -much like a cathedral for which the restaurant gets its name - and is decorated pretty nicely inside with cool Mexican murals on the walls.  I gather it is part of a larger chain of semi-Americanized Mexican restaurants (judging by the long list of locations printed on the menu), though I'm not sure exactly what that chain is, and don't recall where their sister restaurants may be located.\\n\\nNo matter though, the menu offerings are pretty much identical to what I've seen in countless other restaurants around town - many of which also incorporate the \\"tapatia\\" into their name.\\n\\nThe prices seemed to be a tad cheaper than many similar locations here in Portland.  About $9.50 for a combo plate with three enchiladas (stuffed with pollo or picadillo; cheaper for cheese or ground beef), black beans, and rice; a lot of other places would serve you two enchiladas for this price.  The rice was nothing spectacular, but the beans were better than average.  Often times the frijoles negro come a little too soupy for my taste, but here they were prepared pretty much to perfection.\\n\\nThe enchiladas themselves were also quite good, though I they do use the ubiquitous \\"ranchero-style\\" sauce that, while not offensive, just doesn't do that much for me.  The meat was reasonably spiced and cooked nicely.\\n\\nI'd say the above would earn Catedral Tapatia 3*s in my book, but then we took the party downstairs to the lounge for further drinking and karaoke.  In the lounge my Dos Equis Ambers entered my frosted glass via draught, rather than a bottle as served in the restaurant upstairs, but the margaritas were still served in fishbowls and seemed every bit as strong.\\n\\nThe karaoke was fun, especially for a group, and with a rotation of singers that totaled about 6 (including myself and one other from our party) you pretty much get the mic on demand.  A first for me though, you browse and select your songs via computer off behind the KJ's little entertainment booth.  I prefer the more traditional flipping through a giant 3-ring binder at your table, as I felt the pressure as people waited for me to find and enter the song I wanted.\\n\\nBut no matter, the KJ had smoke and bubble machines as well as a full on light kit that went from dim ambient lighting to full on hostility traffic stop in .2 seconds.  Pretty cool, but having 6000 lumens blasted into your retina while squinting to read the karaoke screen can make you feel like you're having an aneurysm...or at least a very severe hangover headache hours before you've really earned it.\\n\\nUltimately the above average food, with good service and even better prices, coupled with the opportunity to let the good times roll down in the basement lounge, earn Catedral Tapatia 4*s in my book.\\n\\nOne last note: while in the lounge downstairs I almost did a spit take watching the door labeled \\"Restrooms\\" open to let a waiter carrying a plate of food pass through and deliver it to the KJ, before turning around and leaving the lounge by the same door.  Do they actually have a kitchen next to the urinals?  Curiosity forced me to follow the man and I will be forever grateful to have discovered that the door leads to a hallway with both stairs up to the main floor and the restrooms."},{"name":"Ball Square Cafe","address":"708 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"Liked the omelettes and the french toast specials..

I ordered the Fried Chicken, Poutine, Side of Mac and Cheese and a Grasshopper!! My Fianc√© ordered the Club sandwich and a Caesar Salad!! Let me start with mine  \\n\\nMy fried chicken came out almost black and soaking in grease. It was way undercooked and way too wet. I don't know how they seasoned it but there was no salt or pepper, it tasted like boiled chicken that had been breaded and deep fried in week old oil. It was so bad my heart started cramping so i stopped picking at it. \\n\\nI tasted the collard greens hoping to have success; yet i found none!! They had no sweetness or savoriness, it tasted like pure vinegar unfortunately it was way to acidic! \\n\\nNext i got a side of mac and cheese!! I asked the waiter how good it was and his words were \\"bomb\\" well it was bomb... A shit bomb, this hot noodle mess was ridiculous it again had no salt or pepper. The cheese sauce was their pasta water with cream and maybe some parmesan it was horrible and had no flavor! \\n\\nThe biscuit however was amazing!! Nice and golden brown and flaky!!  \\n\\nI got my booze loaded Grasshopper which was great!! Even though it was ice-cream and bottled liquor, i don't think you could mess that up!\\n\\nI ordered Poutine which is supposed to be fries, cheese curds and gravy!! The gravy was delicious and so were the fries however there was literally a blocks worth of cheese on there not cheese curd which is different!\\n\\nMy fianc√© Ashley got the club sandwich; her bread was way to buttery, they pretty much burned the bread and used butter to soften it back. The sliced turkey tasted like a whole boiled turkey that was waterlogged then sliced and heated! Her fries had way to much salt on them, they only had vegan organic ketchup which was disgusting and their ranch was watered down. She says her soda was delicious! \\n\\nHer caesar salad was amazing and delicious.  \\n\\nI returned all my food and was asked if i wanted something else?!?

I never thought I'd find a local Greek restaurant to compare with my favorite in Tarpon Springs, but Zorba's surprised me. I'm half Greek so I've grown up eating Greek food, and of course every family has their tricks and preferences. I find the food here to be delicious, authentic, and amazingly flavorful, even for Greek food. \\n\\nThe avagolemono soup looks too simple to be impressive but the flavors are absolutely perfect. The amount of lemon is ideal, and this is now my \\"magic soup\\" when I'm not feeling well. The staples like gyro, pastitsio, and salad are delicious, and I especially love the added touch of meat on the salad. Their specials are also wonderful - last week was half an eggplant roasted with spiced meat and bechamel. \\n\\nOne day they had a divine Greek potato salad as a special - if that was an everyday option on bottom or top of their Greek salad, it would be perfect. My favorite surprise is a Greek risotto-style dish with tender rice, spinach and feta cheese. If I hadn't tried it, I'd have dismissed it as too simple, but the flavors are explosive and soothing at the same time. It's now my favorite comfort food. \\n\\nSo many things to love here, not the least are the friendly and personable owners, who are loving and kind. They greet me by name now, and they opened early for me the Saturday after hurricane Matthew so that I could pick up trays of food for my father's memorial service. Service and kindness like that mean I'd be a customer even if their food wasn't my favorite, but consistent 5/5 visits have made this my new favorite Greek home-away-from-home."},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Beer is good, although it's fairly typical for a nice microbrew-- good but there's a few that are only meh.\\n\\nBurgers are great.

We had the cheese plate and the seared ahi. A little shy of ten bucks each for amounted to maybe two or three ounces of cheese? It wasn't even terribly nice cheese, the smoked gouda from Costco is probably equivalent in quality and a lot cheaper. The seared ahi was five (decently sized) slices artfully arranged. Uh.

I usually get the large size hook and ladder sandwich fully involved (with everything on it) or the hook and ladder salad. The sandwich is huge! It bearly fits in the bag! The salad is definitely ham packed with ham and turkey as well as all the different toppings you could want (i.e. black olives, banana peppers, cheese, onions). I usually ask for extra extra extra dressing because the containers of salad dressing are super tiny. The salad can easily be eaten by two people. Will definitely be back to this location again and again :)"},{"name":"OSAKA Japanese Sushi & Steak House","address":"14 Green St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"I think this might be my favorite sushi restaurant ever.  And given that my husband's pet name for me is sushi monster, that means means a lot (or not much at all depending on your interpretation).\\n\\nSome people ordered hibachi.  They were happy with their meal, but I think we concluded that the standout food was the sushi.\\n\\nThe fusion rolls are excellent.  I think the people who said the rolls were sweet might have been referring to these because they have fruit in them.  I liked the mix of sweet and savory.  These rolls embody the creativity of Euro-Japanese fusion that I encountered in one of the nicer sushi restaurants I went to in Hawaii.   The presentation of these is also remarkable making the meal an enjoyable visual experience.  (Check the pics I uploaded!) \\n\\nFor starters, we had the yellow submarine, which had mango and lobster tempura on a plate dressed with a mango and Thai chili sauce.  We also had a hidden dragon roll and a garden roll.  The latter is vegetarian and has kiwi draped over it with a strawberry-mango-kiwi sauce.  The fusion rolls were surprising and balanced sweet with savory and Asian with European ingredients. These rolls were excellent.  They aren't huge, and I think the higher prices are because they are more labor intensive and the ingredients are more expensive.  (Many of them have 2-3 expensive fishes.)\\n\\nWe also ordered from the sushi in the back of the menu.  These are smaller, less expensive, more standard rolls.  However, these rolls are high quality and represent excellent crafting.  They have a very thin layer of rice on the outside with a substantial amount of fish in each roll.  In many places the layer of rice is as thick as a single grain.  I say this with admiration, as cheep-o sushi usually has a lot of rice.  You can see this sign of quality in my pictures.  Our favorites are the salmon roll (check out that hunk of fish!) and the pearl roll, which has asparagus.\\n\\nThe seaweed salad was good, as it always seems to be.  At Osaka, it comes out in a large bowl with iceberg lettuce underneath.  The crisp lettuce contrasts nicely with the limp seaweed.  I liked that pairing although when I saw the big bowl, I gave my brother a much larger taste than I would have had I known half the \\"large bowl\\" was iceberg lettuce.  :)  I guess he just got lucky.\\n\\nAnother reviewer gave me a good idea.  He said that the fusion rolls that I love so much are so sweet he thinks it is a desert.  Well. I know just what to do with that suggestion.  I think the seaweed salad is a good appetizer.  Then follow that with one fusion and one smaller roll (Alaskan or pearl) for the main and finish the night with another fusion roll for desert.  \\n\\nHealthy choice tip: In all seriousness, the seaweed salad is a great starter to the meal.  Avoid tempura (fried) rolls or rolls with mayonnaise or cream cheese.  The fusion rolls probably have a higher sugar content, so I limit myself to one fusion in the meal and get the rest from the back of the menu.  YOU CAN SUBSTITUTE BROWN RICE!  I am very excited about this.\\n\\nThat is how the sushi monster rolls."},{"name":"Ball Square Cafe","address":"708 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"This was our first meal stop for our New England adventure weekend (except for Chik-Fil-A on the long drive lmao).

Many of them are BBQ joints, but if you're sick of brisket and pulled pork, you might want to swing by Thundercloud Subs.  It's a bit of a walk if you're leaving from the gates at the western end of the airport, but well worth it.\\n\\nI'm not sure what the other Yelper(s) who complained about surly service were talking about.  Everyone I saw there was pleasant and friendly.  Maybe that person has been fired or re-educated.  Or killed and chopped up into sandwich meat and served to the customers.  In any case, the problem has been solved.\\n\\nThe subs are tasty, a good size, and an excellent value, especially for normally-extortionate airport food prices.  I did have a hard time eating mine without making a mess, which may be attributable to user error.  The layer of guacamole they used acted as a lubricant, causing the top half of my sub to slide apart from the bottom half.  \\n\\nI was a little bummed that they didn't have any of the Italian meats (salami, capicola, etc.) to make the kind of subs that I grew up on (and still crave).

Their food is fantastic across the board. Here's what we got\\n\\n- Roasted Red Pepper Hummus, A+: The best restaurant hummus I've ever had. The flavor was excellent, texture perfect and a huge portion. Plus, the pita bread it comes with is amazing, warm and you get at least 3 full-sized pita cut into quarters. In fact, we ran out of pita and our server brought us some more free!!!!\\n\\n- Prosciutto Mac & Cheese, B: This was very good, but not A material in my opinion. It's closer to a \\"Shells and White Cheddar\\" dish than Mac & Cheese / Kraft Dinner, and the prosciutto flavor was almost non-existent. I think it would be great if labeled as \\"Shells with White Cheddar (with prosciutto)\\", but when you promise Proscuitto Mac & Cheese, stuff better be amazing.\\n\\n- Pulled Pork and Green Chile Crepe, A+: This was the surprise of the night for me. The most unique crepe I've ever had, and somehow they made it work perfectly. The pork is cooked to perfection and the green chile accented it wonderfully. Crepe itself was not chewy and the perfect base flavor contrasted against the strong pork. Dish was huge was well, and came with a good salad!\\n\\n- Cheese + Charcuterie, A: We were pigs, and went for the 5 dish version, so we got to try almost everything. All the cheese pairings were very good, even on the cheese I'm not a big fan of (brie). My two favorites were the Gorgonzola w/ Guava Paste and Manchego w/ Chorizo. Once again, huge portions, and the good news is that if you take anything home it's good the next day!\\n\\n- Service, A+: Service was excellent, even though there were crowded.

Our server, as expected, knew everything in the food menu and described it to us flawlessly. But then, we turn to this multiple page wine book (not list, but book) and ask for a comparison between two Malbecs, out of maybe 10 they offered. DId the server call the sommelier? NO NEED. Girl had it down. She's telling us about the different altitudes of where the grapes were growing, region, and palate. I mean that is awesome. Some of us decided to share appetizers or entrees and the kitchen seamlessly split the dishes for us, they looked like they were meant to be that way, still perfectly presented. Even red beet salad, that was served to look like a round cheesecake type thing, when shared was made to look like two smaller cheesecake like things- no semi-circle appetizers at this table. Anayways, moving on...\\n\\nThe food is great and I would recommend the smoked salmon, the lemon sole and the rabbit. The sole is fillet'ed at the table by your server so that it stays nice and moist til consumption.

There were also another 20 to 30 people sitting down eating. \\n\\nAs I began eavesdropping on the conversations around me (Come on, who doesn't do this?) I quickly realized that many of these people were regulars. I asked the guy in front of me what his \\"go to\\" is, and he mentioned the meatball sandwich. \\n\\nI already had my eye on the ruben. Combine that with the fact that I almost never order anything with meatballs because most people/restaurants can't produce quality meatballs, I did not take his advice. \\n\\nI ordered the ruben, and it was very good, not great, but very good. My wife ordered a hot Italian. Now because I was born in Philadelphia, I never order Italians HOT. But my wife likes weird things (like lettuce and tomatoes on her cheesesteak) so I ordered one for her. I have to admit, it was really good, better than my ruben. The roll her sandwich came on was the perfect combination of crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. \\n\\nI ordered the chicken breast sandwich for my toddlers to split. I ended up eating half as they are not big sandwich fans. The bread was on point, but the rest of the sandwich was just okay. \\n\\nThey have a nice variety of chips...which is nice.\\n\\nOne final thought, and the reason I gave this place 4 stars, the customer service was great. That line I told you about? I was sitting down and taking my first bite in about 15 minutes which was pretty impressive. Also, I loved the guy at the counter taking orders. He was personable, and when he had the time he chatted with me while I waited for my food.

Those who like or love this place have no idea what good food is and are only going here cause they feel, think, or have been told by someone who they think is cool that this is the place to be. If you want not good but great authentic Asian, Vietnamese or Thi food at a fair price drive 3 minutes further south of this place step a little bit out of your comfort zone and eat food cooked by some who knows how to cook and although they my not be able to talk to you the menu is in English and the food will knock your socks of in flavor and spice. Honestly wish i could say something positive about this place but it is disgrace to the restaurant industry and to the cultural cuisine they are making a piss poor attempt at representing."},{"name":"Soul Vegetarian No  2","address":"652 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"If I can give them 0 stars I would.

This is tough... We were looking outside our area for a good place to have Asian cuisine. We decided to look on yelp for reviews. We were literally salivating from other yelpers reviews. Happy to try a place that appeared to have great food. Sadly, we were disappointed. When the hubby and I saw the variety of different cultural experiences we thought yay we found it... Nope... So here's the rating..\\n1. The first star, the service was pretty good. Not great but not horrible. We tried getting service on several occasions, not very attentive. It was more of employee interaction than customer interaction. \\n2. The fried green beans were awesome. \\n3. The Roti was great too..\\nHence three stars...\\n\\nNow to the not so great...\\n1. Upon arrival we immediately were disappointed. During our wait to be seated, we reviewed the menu. We knew going into this that it was going to be similar to a major restaurant chain like ** changs. Yet the aura smelled pretty good. \\n2. We ordered a variety of ethnic cuisine however it was very Americanized. If you put Vietnamese sandwiches, or sliders as you call them, then prepare it somewhat to the authentic style. None of the veggies were pickled. However the amount of duck was substantial. \\n3. Your bulgolgi was far from authentic, not even Asian fusion. We ordered the lettuce wrapped with bulgolgi and it was a complete failure. Horrible...\\n4. Your curry potatoes were nothing more than smashed potatoes with curry plopped on top. Dreadful. \\n5. The spring rolls were plopped together like leftover junk. However the peanut dipping was pretty good. \\n\\nWe wouldn't run to or recommend this place to anyone...However, on the plus side we discovered an area that has the potential to locate a great dining experience.

At the start of this draft I am standing outside of the restaurant feeling the need to pen my initial experience. True to most Chinese Restaurants that are often busy (always a good sign) the hustle and bustle of Jim Wah is not to go unnoticed. TE young lady who correctly assumed I was looking to place a to go order also assumed I knew what I wanted. Although a bit presumptuous, definitely a good sign; their recidivism rate must be high! After sliding a menu to me from the stack in front of her she immediately asked, \\"Are you ready?\\" Honestly I had only cracked open the front cover. I politely responded \\"No\\" with a chuckle and continued to scour the menu. \\n\\nThe only certainty I had was the Salt Pepper Squid. It was the first quick tip on the home page and sounded thoroughly intriguing. A few menu pages in I came across the rice & noodle offerings and decided I would be a little more adventurous and order the Chicken & Salted Fish Fried Rice. The look on the gentleman's face as I repeated my rice choice was priceless. He asked, \\"Have you had it before?\\" to which I replied, \\"No but I'll be fine.\\" \\n\\nHis face remained unchanged. \\n\\nI repeated, \\"I'll be fine\\" with a chuckle as if to convince him but his face remained the same! It was as if he had dollop of manure on his lip and was trying to figure out where the smell was coming from. 10 seconds later he said, \\"It's Chinese anchovies\\" and in an instant I too had the manure lip funny smell face! He must have noticed because he suggested chicken or shrimp fried rice. Obviously he was more convincing and I quickly consulted his expertise asking, \\"What's better, pineapple or chicken fried rice?\\" \\n\\nIf my take out Salted Pepper Squid & Chicken Fried Rice ($19 total) tastes as good as it smells I will be increasing the stars but simply based on my interaction with the staff who was not only eager but also willing to lend a helpful suggestion I'm halfway to a second visit and enamored enough to give them 3 Stars without having tasted so much as a green onion.\\n\\nWelp! It was all it smelled like it was cracked up to be!! The first bite of the Salted Pepper Squid was incredible; like a sensory overload. However, I must admit when I opened the carton my immediate thought was \\"Oh! This is gonna be disappointing\\" but much to my chagrin it was exactly the opposite. I would have never thought that a dish that looks like a half finished sweet and sour chicken dish without the sweet and sour would be so... sweet and sour! It was incredible! I was in such disbelief that I checked the carton to make sure it was in fact what I was eating. I am a fan and can't wait to try some of their more traditional dishes and by traditional I do mean American tradition ie.

Food-wise my mom loved the green goddess salad, which comes with a tasty crostini smothered in goat cheese. The truffle fries and green beans were my favorite thing on the menu, for they were perfectly salty and had that savory truffle flavor from Jacobsen's Truffle Salt. Another favorite was the steak frites with feta. For dessert, the snickerdoodle cheesecake did not disappoint.

Ridiculous."},{"name":"Staplehouse","address":"541 Edgewood Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Note: They have a consistently rotating menu. This review is based on a visit for dinner on April 1st. \\n\\nThere's an almost paradoxical feeling at Staplehouse between feeling completely at home and the upscale intricate experience of a Michelin star restaurant. The often humble supporting actor takes center stage with their primarily vegetarian menu (on the day I went), and the execution was on point. Seriously, the creativity applied to create so many of their dishes made otherwise bland ingredients not just surprising, exciting to the eyes, and most importantly SO pleasing to the palette. \\n\\nOk, their asparagus dish. Asparagus, yolk, vetch, shoyu,and begonia - but more of an asparagus three ways. A light asparagus custard as the base, with shaved stalk, and baby tips, beautiful begonias, and these delicious twig looking, but sweet foraged root (?). I think one of the best parts of dining here is discovering these foraged ingredients I would never have tried otherwise. \\n\\nAlso, a must mention, the green garlic agnolotti with morels. Have mercy. \\n\\nMy group (party of 4) ate through the whole menu (11 items). With the kick off of one of their excellent cocktails (I loved the Ivy League: lavender honey, lemon, bourbon) and a bottle of wine, this meal really couldn't have been any better.

The bar was pretty packed, but that may have been due to a birthday event going on. Every time I went up to the bar, I felt unnecessarily rushed by the older gentleman taking my order. Maybe he felt rushed because of the sheer amount of people in the place, but it was really off-putting and unwelcoming. I bartended for 3 years, so I get the stress of a rush, but I also made sure to go up to the bar during lulls in the busy times when the crowd around the bar had thinned.\\n\\nMost of the drinks were good, I had a mediocre whiskey sour and my lady had a poorly mixed vodka lemonade. The food is okay, my buddy liked his Cobb salad but the prosciutto sandwich I got had way too much fig jam that overpowered the taste of the meat. My gf had the caprese panini that was tasty. \\n\\nThe main reason for the 4 stars is the interior of the bar and the patio. Everything is clean and nicely decorated, and the patio is huge for plenty of seating and summer ambiance. There's bocce ball and ping pong. Crowd seemed like a mix of a couple college kids and a majority of older (30s-40s) people. I wish they had the Duck game on the projector screen instead of the Timbers game (the Timbers fans didn't even seem into the game) but they had 2 smaller TVs to satisfy the non soccer fans.\\n\\nI dont know if I'd recommend this spot on busy nights but definitely one of the best patios in St Johns and good place to socialize"},{"name":"Jack Allen's Kitchen Oak Hill","address":"7720 Hwy 71 W","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"First time here...sat outside, perfect weather and there is a bar outside!

I hadn't really eaten all day, so I asked him what I should get among several things on the menu, as my husband ordered a draft beer.  He pushed the fish special, which sounded nice, along with a cup of the seafood gumbo.  I agreed...the gumbo came out, light blonde,amateurish roux, with chicken and sausage - no seafood to be seen.  Plus there was corn in the gumbo.  WhoTF puts corn in gumbo?  As we remind the waiter about the previously ordered beer, the table next to us gets ice water and an amuse-bouche of crispy chips and house made pimento cheese.  We mentioned to our waiter that we had yet to recieve either.  He was sweet, and apologetic, and more than 5 minutes later appeared with said beer, bouche, and H20.  Main dishes were good - we had a bit of fish left over for a doggie bag, and asked that it just be wrapped in a bit of foil instead of wasting a big to-go box.  The waiter came out with a big to-go box, citing that it was \\"easier for him\\".  And then, dessert.  Watching our diets as of late, we were going to pass, but the banana toffee pie sounded too delicious to pass up...great presentation, and as my husband and I took a simultaneous first bite, the taste was wonderful - until he told me to stop chewing.  He turned the pie towards me, and there was a fly, still alive, stuck inside the pie.  Still alive...seriously.  The waiter promptly took it away, apologized, and sent over the manager.  He offered to give us a dessert to go, which we declined given the state of our recently repulsed appetite.  We asked for the check.  When it came, nothing had been comped.  Not the appetizer, not a couple of drinks.

The waitress also wanted my input as to what I would like to see more of on the menu and what other veggie choices I thought would do well in an area where there are a lot of veg/vegan customers. She also said that they would be adding more veg options that would appeal to this market and possibly be making a veg only menu. AWESOME!\\n\\nLastly, this place is cute - really cute. Unlike other sushi places on the drive that have harsh fluorescent lighting and stark decor and tiling, Volcano is warm, inviting, cozy . . etc etc. Perfect date spot.\\n\\nOh, one more thing - at the end of my meal she brought me a cute little orange, cut into cubes for dessert!

Our order was repeated back to us and arranged into courses. Drinks were refilled and food was promptly delivered. Mistakes in our order were quickly rectified. \\n- We were given food items free of charge to compensate for other missing food items on the menu.\\n- Nice d√©cor and the electronic toilet seat is a nice touch.\\n\\nCONS:\\n- Took an additional 20 minutes to be seated, despite having made reservations a week in advance.\\n- No free wifi, although Yelp states the opposite on Umi's profile page.\\n- Poor marks for variety and selection. The pictures featured on Yelp are not representative of what is actually being offered. Don't come here expecting to find bizarre and unique varieties of sushi.\\n- Umi ran out of several items that we ordered due to our late seating time.\\n- Too noisy and overcrowded dining room.\\n- Did not care for the music selection, which was better suited for a nightclub than an intimate setting.\\n- The food was average at best and definitely not worth the price.\\n\\nReservations/Arrival:\\nWe made reservations at Umi for 8:45pm (the only time slot available) a week in advance to celebrate an anniversary. When we arrived our table was not yet ready. The hostess requested that we grab a drink at the bar or sit in the front lounge, but there were no seats available. We decided to wait outside until called, which took approximately 20 minutes.\\n\\nOrdering/Menu:\\nAfter we placed our order we were informed a total of FOUR items were not available: monk fish liver, shishito peppers, uni (sea urchin), and the kyu chocolate ball. Our server stated the chocolate ball (repeatedly featured on Yelp) was only produced in small quantities of 8 per night and it needed to be reserved well in advance. That's something the person taking our reservation last week could have mentioned! At this point we asked to speak to the manager. He informed us that due to our late seating time certain items had run out. Umi orders their food in small quantities to maintain freshness. This seemed like a bit of a copout for not managing their inventory properly, but whatever.\\n\\nService:\\nOur server was very attentive and friendly.\\n\\nAmbiance:\\nWe didn't care of the ambiance at all. Umi is basically one big room with a divider that separates the front bar/lounge from the rest of the main dining area. Although we sat along the wall, the tables in the center of the restaurant looked as if they were right on top of each other. Furthermore, Umi was extremely noisy.\\n\\nFood:\\n\\nSpicy Tuna Crispy Rice\\n- This was probably the best item of the night. The spice was well-balanced. The fish was creamy with a smooth texture that matched well with the crispy rice on the bottom. \\n\\nOtoro Caviar\\n- One Yelp reviewer stated, \\"You must order this no matter the price.\\" So, we took his and our server's recommendation. We were extremely disappointed. Several pictures found on Yelp show this as having shaved truffle. However, our otoro had a small drizzle of truffle oil, which I could not distinguish as synthetic or the real thing.The black caviar, although very small in quantity, appeared to be the cheap stuff you find at the supermarket. For being Umi's signature dish, and at a $23 price point, I was not impressed at all!\\n\\nLive Scallop\\n- This dish appeared to be one large scallop cut into relatively thin slices with a very thin slice of lime between each cut, served with ponzu sauce. It was good, especially if you love the taste of lime. However, I felt the lime was overpowering the sweetness of the scallop just a bit. Overall it was good (cost $17).\\n\\nLobster Toban-Yaki\\n- The portion was small, approximately 6 ounces, which couldn't have been more than a tail. I've seen more meat on a New England Lobster Roll. I would have rather gone across the courtyard to Chops Lobster Bar and paid $20 for a flash fried lobster tail. The lobster tasted good, although it was covered in butter and soy sauce. Ultimately it was nothing special, especially for $30.\\n\\n5 Sashimi Chef's Selection\\n- I wanted a nice selection of sashimi, but I wasn't very impressed with the portion or the variety. There was nothing out of ordinary with this dish, as with the others. You can get the same quality and a much, much larger variety of fish at Shoya for a much, much lower price.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nThe old adage of \\"you get what you pay for\\" is generally true, but not when it comes to Umi. I was prepared to spend $500 on this meal and that's how much I paid (not all items ordered were discussed in this review). But the price is not reflective of the level of flavor. For $500 I expect to be absolutely wowed! I chose Umi because of their Yelp pictures and glowing reviews. It is my hope others don't get suckered into this restaurant's mediocre \\"offerings\\".

Many time I can not find a single waiter when I need them; grill meat is just so-so; sushi roll is not fresh and nearly shoddy-job; also DO NOT order drink, they don't even know what they have. Overall, I am very disappointed! I thought they are new and willing try to built a good reputation, but It turned out that THEY DON'T CARE. I WILL NEVER GO AGAIN. \\n\\nIt seems this is a family-run business, there are only four people in total. I can barely find a waiter because they are ALL hide in the kitchen. We ordered the Waltham suchi roll, which says \\"covered with Salmon\\". In most of case, it means the salmon covers all over the rice, but I just had a tiny piece of salom on the top, just like the sushi \\"wear a hat\\". Also, the soy source taste weird, I am a big sushi fan, but I have never had that kind of soy sourse in any other restaurant.  \\n\\nBarbecue is the major reason we came, but I don't have any thing to say about it. Well... it taste like simple home-made grill work, but it charges a lot for it. Furthermore, I was trying to order a drink, and I pointed one picture in their menu, and the waiter said \\"The picture is not match the drink list\\". EXCUSE ME?!

The menu is extensive, innovative and filled with \\"got-to-try\\" options. And, I will be back often. But, I have a problem with some of the reviewers on Yelp and elsewhere...\\n\\nYelp should not allow people to write reviews for at least the first two weeks after a restaurant opens. Unfortunately, some people don't understand how very difficult it is to open a restaurant and therefore write bad reviews based on a one-time experience in the first week or two after opening. And, other people read these reviews and assume that opening missteps and hiccups are the norm for the operation. Not only is it unfair to judge a restaurant on a one-time visit, it is completely unfair to judge a restaurant so soon after it opens. Posting a bad review is potentially damaging for the restaurant, the owners and the staff who depend on the restaurant to make a living. It is just not fair to write a bad review so soon after opening!\\n\\nMurphy's Law - everything that can go wrong will go wrong - is especially true in the restaurant business with all the equipment, systems, electronics and people. In the first few weeks everyone is getting used the system, the equipment and the guests and problems WILL happen. I usually wait a t least a month to go to a new restaurant, because I know they will have to work out problem areas.\\n\\nHarold's is a great restaurant that is working out the kinks. Once they work their way through the opening period this restaurant will be one of the top restaurants in Columbus. Please give restaurants a chance and refrain from writing bad reviews until the restaurant has been open for at least two to three weeks.\\n\\nI urge people who have written bad reviews to give the restaurant another chance and modify their reviews if the situation has improved, which I am sure it will."},{"name":"Staplehouse","address":"541 Edgewood Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Staplehouse is one of the hardest places to get a reservation for in all of Atlanta.

One of the poached eggs was 98% runny (runny egg white - yuck! hello?!) but since I was surrounded by my coworkers, I decided to push that egg aside and not say anything.  Other than that, there were about 4-5 teeny little pieces of smoked fish under each egg and 3 spinach leaves under that, then half of an English muffin.  \\nSo I ate 1 poached egg (sans sauce), 6 spinach leaves and a few skimpy little pieces of smoked fish for $14.

Oh, and I'm a foodie, I like variety! We tried the Pork Belly Bao (not my favorite, but still good), Roti Canai (delicious, love the curry gravy and I'm not normally a fan of curry!), the Wok-fired Lettuce (smoky wok flavor shines through on this one, I could have eaten all of this by myself), Hokkein Mee (loved this... so many things going on in that bowl with the veggies, the proteins, and the sauce was great!), Miso Ramen Soup (also not my favorite but it was tasty - I'm not big on soups due to messy factor), and the star of the show - Crispy Roast Pork Siu Yoke - which might be one of my favorite ways to eat the king of meats - Pork Belly! Cannot give enough love to this presentation of pork fat, it was delicious.\\n\\nTo add to this review, I made a trip to Hawkers in Orlando 2 weeks later with a different dining companion and we changed up a couple of things for that meal. Additional items tried included Mee Goreng Noodles (actually liked them better than the Hokkein Mee, totally different sauce and the combo of Tofu and Shrimp was perfect for my tastes that day), as well as 5 Spice Green Beans which were like vegetable candy and my anti-veggie dining partner devoured them. \\n\\nAt both locations the service was spot-on, the food was amazing, the prices were excellent, and the beer menu is deep on bottles and drafts with something for everyone. At the St. Pete location we were able to have our dog out on the patio with us and the server brought water for our furry companion. Altogether a fantastic experience at both locations and I highly recommend.

Before we arrived, they warned me that it's not flashy and the patrons are a bit older, but it is simply one of those restaurants that has become a family tradition.\\n\\nUnassumingly tucked into the Toco Hills shopping center, I never would have sought this place out on my own accord. I was excited to try out a true family place and experience the charm of its tradition.\\n\\nTaking in my surroundings, my first reaction was that it is just precious. White table cloths, doily-style white curtains, old wooden benches, servers in slick ties and black vests...inflatable turkeys, stuffed little scarecrows, fake orange leaves (they really get into the holiday spirit). My favorite part was the expansive mural on the large wall of the restaurant with a lovely scene depicting the French countryside. I also couldn't help but notice that most of the patrons were in the senior citizen age range. Let's just say that by 8:15pm, the entire restaurant had completely cleared out.\\n\\nBeing regulars, my friend's family had their usual waiter - a delightful older gentleman named Sammy - who took great care of us. He made sure that water and wine glasses were always filled, and he was polite and charming. I was kind of disappointed to learn that I missed out on the piano player who used to entertain the customers on a regular basis. Apparently he has moved on to bigger and better things, and been replaced by a soft soundtrack of jazzy seasonal tunes.\\n\\nI have to admit -- for being such a hole-in-the-wall type of place, they have an absolutely delicious menu of classic French dishes. I opted for the Coquille (sea scallops) and asked for extra veggies. It came on a crisp white plate with a tower of asparagus and looked like a true piece of art. On top of that, the scallops were some of the best that I have had in a long time. They were plump and juicy and flavorful, and they harmoniously paired with the seasoned asparagus, broccoli, and tomato. Yum! After my meal, I was too stuffed for dessert. But my fellow diners ordered some beautiful selections including chocolate mousse and bread pudding. All came in dainty little dishes and were, according to the tasters, positively decadent.\\n\\nI don't think that I would come back to this place with my friends or without a family of regulars, but I am very glad that I had the opportunity to step outside of my normal scene and check out this darling Atlanta tradition."},{"name":"Oudom Thai & Sushi","address":"100 S Eola Dr, Ste 105","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Awful service, good food.

She has never eaten at Ruth Chris Steak House before but has heard that it was supposed to be a top quality dining experience.  It was such a disappointment for her, especially on her birthday.  To start off, they seated us in the bar area so our server was the bartender which was sort of awkward for an intimate dinner.  My wife pointed out that my beer glass was chipped on the brim, which she asked them to replace it.  We ordered the special consisting of soup or salad, a side dish, and an entree.  I ordered the salad, nothing special, but my wife ordered the corn chowder which after several minutes we were told that they were out of.  She asked them to substitute the gumbo instead which they did.  My entree was a 12oz. steak medium rare with garlic mashed potato as a side.  My wife ordered the lobster tale and 6oz fillet medium rare with green beans for the side.  They served the entree's and they really must think we are idiots, because my wife's lobster tail turned into shrimp.  The server didn't mention anything till I started poking at the shrimp with my fork.  Why would you serve something we didn't even order?!?  They covered it up by saying that they ran out of the lobster tail, and they would get Justin the manager to explain everything.  On top of that, her fillet was medium well (not even a hint of pink in the center).  After several more minutes Justin the manager finally came by our table and told me that he would get my wife a lobster tail to replace the shrimp and that it would be a larger portion of a lobster tail than usual.  I asked him to just take the whole plate back because it appeared like it was the wrong order and to bring the correct order.  Mean while my wife tells me to just enjoy my meal as she only gets to eat the green beans.  I give 1 star because my steak was great, but my garlic mashed potatoes had no garlic, maybe just garlic salt.  Something seriously wrong going on in the kitchen there... So I awkwardly eat my dinner while my wife eats green beans for her birthday.  Finally they serve the lobster tail but we had to wait another 5 minutes for her fillet.  They said the lobster tail was bigger than what we were supposed to get, but how would we know if we had nothing to compare it to?  What a horrible first time experience my wife had, especially on her birthday which we were suppose to be celebrating.  They did provide us desserts to celebrate with, but we were too far from the point of enjoyment.  I asked to take out our unfinished steaks and my so called garlic mashed potatoes, which we found out later they just put both steaks in one take out box minus the garlic mashed potatoes.  I called Justin the manager over again, and it still took him a long while to get back to our table.  All he did was comp our drinks, which I only had 1 Fat Tire and my wife had 1 glass of wine ($18).  Justin the manager explained that he took the drinks off the bill which is more than the price of the lobster tail, but in the end I ended up paying ($122) for a dinner that wasn't worth finishing.  I didn't feel like arguing especially in front of my wife on her birthday.  At the time I just cut my losses and wanted to get home.  The conversation we had all the way home was just how horrible the experience was at Ruth Chris!  I wish I would have looked at the reviews first before going there...

There are some definite advantages for the place as far as drinking goes, putting this in my \\"Best Pint Night\\" list: the draft selection is huge, Sunday is all-day $3 Texas craft pints, and Monday is $3 pints of many different 16oz pours. (It is not, however, a discount on \\"nearly everything,\\" as their promotional materials maintain; less than half of their drafts are on special.) There's also a $3 fire sale most days for a draft they're trying to push, which, obviously, is a good deal provided that it's something you like. (Additional note: since tax is not included in drink prices, as it is at most bars, it's really $3.25. Not fatal, but worth mentioning)\\n\\nAs a location, there's a nice-looking patio that may or may not be dog friendly (they're in the process of revising the policy as of this writing). The tables are nice and vary in size, making it a little more intimate than the park-benches-in-dirt that you get at most of the local places. Inside is going for funky sports bar, which will draw you in or keep you out based on your predilections. If you can ignore the giant TVs, there are some comfy overstuffed couches in the middle room of the three large rooms (bar area, lounge area, and back room for overflow/private parties) that make up the interior.\\n\\nBut the food and service can leave a lot to be desired. The menu is decidedly corporate, and has been shrinking throughout the years to get rid of the few things (wraps and the salmon plate, for starters) that I liked. Very little seems to be prepared in-house, so if you want something not out of a bag, go for the pizzas (made from a kind of biscuit dough, but pretty good). The sandwiches and starters, for the reasons listed, are nothing to write home about. The wing sauces are a particular disappointment.\\n\\nService works on a collaborative principle, so you'll often be greeted by one server, have your order taken by another, and have your food run by someone else. I actually like this in theory, and it usually works, but when it breaks down or you're not spotted immediately coming in, it can lead to long wait times, especially during peak hours. It isn't helped by the fairly high turnover in the very large wait staff that means you're breaking in a rookie every third visit. As part of the corporate theme, they hire young girls in short skirts, high socks, and tight shirts, kind of like Hooters for hipsters. This is nice for eye candy, to be sure, but tends to work out in practice that you're getting servers with limited or no high-volume experience.\\n\\nSo, go on pint nights, join the UFO Club, and tour the world of brews.

My oldest daughter had the bruschetta for her dinner and I had the roasted spaghetti squash with peppers and tomatoes.  Oh man was it all delicious.  My youngest had chicken tenders because she's my picky child and that's about all she'll eat so I'm grateful they had the option (even though I'd love to get her to expand her palate).  I even got the 11 year old to try the spaghetti squash and she thought it was terrific.  She devoured her bruschetta.  \\n\\nWe went on a Tuesday at 6:00 which meant not much of a crowd and a good deal with half priced appetizers and half price Ohio draft beer.  The total for all three of us, including tip, was $40.  Can't argue with that at all."},{"name":"IHOP","address":"2741 Clairmont Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"Efficient and properly prepared breakfasts.

Our water was never topped off, and we were never really checked on. Even after my girlfriend asked for the manager, the waitress said he was busy so we just asked for the check and left.

Actually he was the only server--do you really need more than one server for just 10 tables?)  After taking a look around at the patrons in the restauarant, I realized that this was a truly authentic Japanese place and that it had to be good if the locals were eating here. \\n\\nWe were given menus and had no clue what the lunch specials meant.  After asking about the difference between Option B (the \\"sunflower\\") and Option A--the waiter explained that Option A came with 2 types of fish whereas Option B came with 3 types for a difference of $3.  In the description, it also had something about \\"fried, broiled, steamed, and tidbits.\\" \\"What are tidbits,\\" I asked our server. He explained it but I still didn't quite understand what he said but we went with it anyway. Both my friend and I got Option B to my surprise, it was excellent. \\n\\nWhat comes in Option B you ask? The chef decides on the fish selection--and on our plate we had 3 pieces of fresh salmon; 4 pieces of yellow tail; and 2 pieces of white fish.  In addition. the \\"tidbits\\" was a cold mushroom, vegetbale medley that comes in the center of the plate. There are also 2 pieces of egg, and a broiled piece of salmon.  Each lunch special comes with salad, miso soup, shrimp and vegetable tempura, and rice (white or brown).  This is a long shot here, but I am guessing that the fried is the tempura, the steamed is the rice, the broiled is the salmon, and the tidbits is the vegetable medley appetizer.  Hot green tea was also included upon request.  The portions were pretty large and filling.  All of this for $15. Not bad.\\n\\nI was definitely impressed and completely full.

My favorites are the vermicelli bowls and the crispy fried noodles. The stir fry dishes are also really tasty. However, when they are off, the pho is lackluster and in fact comes out just luke warm, leaving your meat behind raw and therefore not edible. They need to work on the Pho because this is a common complaint I hear about this place. The soup needs to be scorching hot especially if ordering the raw meat.

A request for bread was met with \\"we'll have to charge you\\" which was odd but OK- though the bread when it arrived just before the meals was thick slices of buttered toasted white bread with peppercorns which was not as bad as it sounds but not worth paying for either (particularly as two of the meals arrived with the same slab-like slices of bread- another waitress might just have served this five minutes earlier. \\n\\nThe meals (burger, beef wellington, seafood linguine and two orders of winter vegetable risotto were all just so -so- the winter vegetable risotto was actually less than so-so- it was just bland- clumpy and a little glutinous, with a couple of what tasted like frozen carrots and not much else- certainly no discernable vegetables, winter or otherwise; the seafood linguine had half a lobster tail, a couple of shrimp and some sandy mussels and not much to recommend it. The burger arrived with \\"hand-cut fries\\" that were also apparently hand left sitting on the counter as they were served at room temperature. \\n\\nOur distracted waitress then vanished, appearing once to try to sell us another bottle of wine (although we still had full glasses) - and then was not seen until she delivered the check. It included an 18.5% tip as we were a party of 6 (although one of our party only had an iced tea), which was about 10% more than I would have voluntarily given based on the food and service. No offer was made to wrap up the large amount of unfinished risotto, or linguine (which we would have declined- but still). As we were waiting at the front door for one of our party to return from the bathroom, our waitress came bustling over, showing more energy, interest, and speed than we had seen during our entire meal and loudly announced that we had forgotten to tip her. When we pointed out that the gratuity had been added automatically she said that \\"he\\" (whoever he was) had forgotten to add it. We asked her to check and sure enough it was included, and the waitress (no name- she never managed to share that) sheepishly agreed that she had in fact received a tip (although this information was shared at a much lower volume than the previous announcement).\\n\\nIt as not a particularly memorable meal- really the most memorable part was the eccentric service and the mix-up about the tip. We just felt like we had made a mistake and $176 later our only interest was to get out of there. \\nAfter supporting this restaurant since it opened I will not I think be returning."},{"name":"Point Zero Four Fusion","address":"8500 Alexandra Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"2.5","text":"Overall, it's not that bad.

The food was as good as we have come to expect from Oudom but the rest of the experience left us questioning a return visit. We were seated, at our request, at the rear of the restaurant due to a birthday party being held at the bar-side tables - a party that came with their own DJ. We questioned management's decision to allow a 'dance party' DJ playing on a Friday night as it definitely didn't fit the mood we'd expect in a posh sushi restaurant. Starting with saki we were surprisingly disappointed. Warm saki is presented in a wide mouth glass carafe which allowed the it to cool too quickly and the saki cup was a mini coffee cup; the cold sake was presented in a wine glass. Part of a sushi dinner experience is the presentation and the saki presentations were far too 'Westernized'. The staff failed to empress as well. Our server was not knowledgeable of the menu and pronounced items incorrectly. When hiring servers, they should at least know how to pronounce the basics - it's not \\"sal-man'. Our server's style was that of flying by the table saying in passing \\"how's that sushi?\\" while not stopping to wait for an answer. He was so absent that we had to ask the hostess for our check who, again, asked how our dinner was but failed to wait for an answer. Finally, I witnessed a server spill a drink, grab a rag to drag it around on the floor with his foot and then throw the rag back onto the wait station for someone else to later pick it up to wipe down a table - a disgusting sanitary issue.

Restaurant had about three other parties eating, but wasn't busy at all. We received the menus and waters right away. Didn't take us long for to figure out what we wanted on the menu since we both were craving shrimp. Waiter came back in less than 10 minutes of us sitting down to order. We ordered a wonton soup, crispy noodles, shrimp basil rolls, general shrimp with fried rice and Szechuan shrimp with steamed white rice. I ordered an unsweet iced tea, which of course has unlimited refills. Keep in mind, The ice tea in the unsweetened iced tea are the ONLY drinks on the menu, besides water, that is free refills. The wonton soup came out rather fast. Very clear liquid from what I'm used to it wonton soup, plus there was shrimp and a lot of veggies in the soup. I felt like it was vegetable soup with the wonton. Next came the steamed rice in the fried rice. Both out before our meals, but only a couple minutes. Between this time, I refilled my unsweet iced tea two times. And they never let my cup get a quarter from the bottom, to where they were picking it up and getting me more. Very fast and staff that paid attention to what was happening on my table. Food came out. Typically, Szechuan in general flavors at a Chinese restaurant or spicy. We were told that both of them were spicy, but neither one really had a kick to them. Overall the meal was great. Fast from service. I've been to this Golden Buddha a few times before so I'm always happy with the service. The reason I'm giving four stars rather than five; when we got our fortune cookies at the end we both opened them up and they have the same fortune. This is how you know they are housemaid and packaged rather then factory made, ordered, and given to guest.

It was small and cozy. Do I like the decor? It was alright. It reminded me of a pub. \\n\\nI asked my friend what was good on the menu since he has been here many times. He said everything is good.

Whenever I order from a Thai restaurant I always get the tom yum soup, i think it s a good test on how good and how authentic their kitchen is. Both of the above mentioned other Thai places had pretty crappy tom yum soups - Sweet Pepper's one never disappoints me! I also love their pad thai - another good indicator -  the chicken is cooked just right, and the whole dish is not too soggy, not too sweet, not too greasy, just right, just love it! Try their appetizers too, you won't regret it.

The wok fired lettuce turned out to be the best tasting item we tried. Wok hei is really highlighted in this dish and flavors spot on. The roti canai can be ordered with additional roti (flaky crepes), which is highly suggested. Their curry accompaniment is a lot thicker in consistency and mild in flavor. The laksa was pleasantly firey bite with a hint of coconut, but was otherwise the broth lacking in more depth in flavor. However, still warms you up from the inside. The laksa is definitely a good soup option and can be easily divvied up to share family style in small bowls. The five spice calamari was nicely crisp without feeling overly greasy. Just skip the char kwei teo noodle dish; lacks in flavor and wok hei terribly. Hawkers also offers three kinds of hot sauce: Sriracha, hot chili oil, and sambal. Just go for the sriracha and sambal, the hot chili oil is devoid of any chili flavor or spice.  Dessert was the three teas creme brulee trio, a nice way to cap off the meal. Cute presentation to highlight three different tea flavors. They weren't overly sweet and the tea flavor was quite mild. \\n\\nHawkers is a great concept that is fun to eat. Lacks in flavor in terms of seasoning and wok hei for some of their dishes. I wished that it fully embraced the southeast asian punch of flavors (a better mix of the savory, salty, sweet, sour, tangy interplay), but I understand that this could scare away beginner clientele.   \\n\\nService was extremely attentive and on point.

The man came to our table and told us that the woman was a new employee and would be pretty much useless--the first 'quirky' behavior.

He sat down next to me and said 'Fuck yeah, man!' \\n\\nThings got weirder from there. A person at our table ordered a glass of wine, which the server brought, put down at the table, then a moment later came back and wordlessly took the still-full glass away. When we asked about this, he mumbled something unintelligible and brought the glass back.\\n\\nAt the end of the meal, we asked for an itemized receipt and things really went south. The server started giving us the silent treatment and visibly sulking. As we were standing up to leave after paying, he asked if one of the people I was with was my boss. When I said she was, he said he was sorry for me and asked if she always talked down to people. This was within earshot of the whole group.\\n\\nIn short, this was one of the most bizarre dining experiences I've ever had.

The other platter had bbq ribs, bbq chicken, pulled pork sandwich, beans, fries and coleslaw. On the side were some bbq sauce and ketchup. We both enjoyed the corn bread (with or without the honey butter). The Hush puppies tasted better with the honey butter. Without it, it would be a tad bit dry. I find the ribs to be tasteless and in need of the bbq sauce, but even then the bbq sauce didn't provide enough of a kick to it. There were fall off the bone so that's a plus. The chicken was ok. I'd prefer it to be juicier. Weirdly, there was only one pulled pork sandwich. I'd expect it to be two or at least cut in half to share. I did find this to be phenomenal. Best pulled pork I've had. The brioche bun was delicious on its own. The sides:The beans which were said to have bacon in them had no bacony taste to me, but they were good. The coleslaw tastes so much better when it's mixed so don't forget to mix the top with the saucy bottom before eating. The fries were yummy. Crisp and had a hickory taste. You can also choose to dip them in the ketchup which has an onion aroma to it. \\n\\nWe enjoyed our time here but did felt a bit rushed but this may be because it's such a small place didn't want to risk having a line-up.

We were seated at the far end of the restaurant, and although it was loud because there were around 15 or so kids between 4 and 12 on the other side of the booth from ours; loud was certainly expected. What was not expected is that their parents, who were all drinking copious amounts of alcohol were seated across from their kids, and they completely ignored their kids bad behavior for the better part of an hour. The kids kicked the seats and booths, they jumped up and down on the seats, they banged on the partition between us and them, the ran from their section to the bathroom, and around the bar, and were completely unsupervised. They ran around in circles around the section where we were seated; banging into customers as well as wait staff. What kind of parents allow their kids to behave like that in a restaruant? I'll tell you ... rude and uncaring parents. That kind. We asked for the manager and all she could say was, \\"they were at a fundraiser.\\" Really? We heard that they were at a Reading softball something or other. At one point one of the rude parents said something like, \\"Well, those people don't have any kids.\\" Actually, we do. They are 9 and 5 and even if they were with an entire team school aged kids at a restaurant they have been taught not to disturb other guests, becuase, after all, those guests are there to have a nice evening too. The manager should have asked the parents to kindly restrain their children, but I guess she was simply overwhelmed; or maybe she was simply as aghast as the rest of us. We like the atmosphere at Grumpy Doyle's and will go there again.

But it's still clear that it was marinated in tandoori paste for some time (perhaps not for the 24 hour overnight stint, but it's definitely passable). There were also several very noteworthy chicken curries- makhani and a vindaloo I believe were on the buffet when I went on a Saturday. Also, the chicken biryani isn't bad. The meat is tender and flavorful- a common problem encountered with chicken that hasn't been given the time to properly marinate.\\n\\nBut there are also plenty of selections for the vegetarians: a fantastic saag and a savory tomato daal. The sambar is also quite delicious but no dosa or idli to eat it with. The channa masala was undercooked- the chickpeas being a bit too hard and retaining not enough flavor. Those however are my only two complaints.\\n\\nFor just over $10 I ate very well and was very satisfied on the way out the door. If you like Indian food this place is at least worth a try.

It didn't work, I hope they fix it or someone is going to spill a drink or their food. We ordered the antipasto appetizer. When it came we got three side plates for the appetizer and the top plate was dirty with some black charred crumbs of some type. The carrots on the appetizer were rubbery and soggy. We had two pizzas for lunch, a Margherita and their 'Brick' pizza. When they came the Margherita looked like it was covered in arugula, but no, it was overloaded with way too much julienned basil. We spent most of the time eating that one and picking off 2/3 of the basil. The Brick pizza was just OK, but one side of it had a lot of burnt crust bubbles towards the edges. The server/hostess was doing her best to keep up with everyone and then we noticed more staff starting. Don't know whether they were having a staff meeting or people just rolled in when they wanted. But nobody came over to take over the section. I am going to leave the server out of this,  because she was trying. The condition, cleanliness and food flavor/pizza construction were not what I wanted or expected from B.J. Willys. I will not be back and that is sad.

So, I've heard that their quesadillas are strange in that they look very much like burritos, rather than the flipped over half moon thing normally served.\\n\\nPeeking at their menu, I noticed that they offer something called al pastor... what's that?  Well, according to Wikipedia:\\n\\nPork is marinated over one or two days in a combination of dried chiles and then slowly cooked with a gas flame on a vertical rotisserie called a trompo (lit: spinning top), very similar to how shawarma is cooked, with a piece of fresh onion and a pineapple on top.[2] The juice from the pineapple contains an enzyme called bromelain, which breaks down protein and makes the meat very tender. When ready, the meat is then thinly sliced off the spit with a large knife. It is served on small tortillas, with finely chopped onions, cilantro and a small slice of pineapple, and usually topped with some lime juice and hot salsa.\\n\\nMmmm... they also serve lengua... that's tongue for those of you who don't know.  Tongue is a wonderfully tender meat when done right, but just a warning that the lengua served by Anna's still has taste buds attached.\\n\\nSo, for $6.90, I got myself a taco al pastor for $1.95 (vs $2.85 for all other taco options) and a lengua quesadilla regular for $4.50.  I finished both, but felt quite full... probably should have just had the quesadilla...\\n\\nThe Taco was a pretty fat little foil wrapped package - two would have probably been fine for a light/just right lunch.  The taco al pastor had a bit of a kick.  Tasty... but not my cup of tea.\\n\\nThe quesadilla began as a flour tortilla grilled open faced while the cheese was melted in the center.  It was then topped as you wished, bundled up, foil wrapped, and packed into a plastic baggie inside the long brown paper bag.  Good idea on the plastic - my lengua wasn't well drained, so there was a pool of murky liquid left once I had finished eating.  Probably would have been less messy if it was tighter wrapped, but a tasty meal nontheless.\\n\\nNote:\\nCash & Tech Cash Only at this location\\nMexican rice made with chicken broth\\nHorchata includes milk & peanuts\\nGuacamole made with sour cream"},{"name":"Ebisu On Robson","address":"827 Bute Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Had dinner with friends for Dine Out Vancouver Festival at this restaurant and our overall experienced was excellent.

Simultaneously quaint and modern but not annoyingly trendy. Didn't feel like it trying too hard. \\n\\nFood:\\n\\nSteak Tartare - Above average. The pickled onions? added an interesting tartness that I'm not all too sure I'm fond of. Not as tender as I like my tartare but I'm probably too spoiled by Jeffery's.\\n\\nMeat board - Not bad. Not great. I didn't feel like the charcuterie was complex or distinctive. \\n\\nAvocado with some fancy stuff on top and crickets. Honestly, this was the most creative and tasty dish I had...if I could get over the psychological barrier of eating an insect. The juxtaposition of buttery avocado with the texture of the jerky followed by the distinct nuttiness of the crickets was exquisite. I had one bite. Look, I'm working on my entomology palate, ok. \\n\\nGrilled Beef Rib - It's one rib and it will feed Fred Flintstone or 3 normal adults easily. It's also delish. Dry rubbed with spices and a hint of sweetness - fork cutting tender. I had it with a side of mustard greens that had just enough bitterness to cut the fatty ribs. \\n\\nFish Soup - this was part of the supper club menu. Wasn't much to look at and way too much garlic aioli spread on the bread floating on top. The broth was nevertheless tasty. I just couldn't get that excited about it. \\n\\nCarrot cake - cream cheese frosting was unusual. Had a hint of lemon. Cake itself was too dense. Meh. \\n\\nTrifle - served in a jar.

Most recently though (last Friday) , it wasn't as good as before. I went with my dad, and we ordered the crab cake for an appetizer. This cake had virtually no fillers and didn't hold together well because it was huge crab pieces and was seasoned extremely well. I liked the vegetables and sauce, it helped lighten up the heavy seasoning on the dish. The price was seventeen dollars which was pretty expensive considering you can buy a whole pound of crab for around twenty at Costco, but it was a good start to the meal. The bread was delicious- crusty and warm with a soft inside and I love salted butter. For the entrees, I ordered the steak and fries while my dad ordered the bouillabaisse. My steak was nicely cooked, and although it was too charred for my dad's liking, it had awesome flavor and I really liked it. The fries were warm, crispy, and nicely seasoned as usual at Bistro Niko. On the other hand, the bouillabaisse wasn't as much of a hit. The fish had a strange fishy taste that kind of ruined the dish, but the broth wasn't too salty and had a nice flavor. I also liked the vegetables, but my dad said that he disliked the dish. On previous visits, I've had the red wine salmon, the mushroom \\"pizza\\", and the duck confit, which we've all enjoyed.

My friend and I come here bi-weekly if not weekly during our dinner break and it's usually a good experience. Kudos to the chef! Tonight was a different story. We enjoyed our meal, and when the waitress brought back our check, she had charged a different table's check to my friend's debit card. $77.00! She came back about a minute later and snatched the check away from my friend and said, \\"This isn't right.\\" and disappeared. She came back a few minutes later and advised that she had charged the right amount and voided the other tab. The only problem is, we had checked my friend's card activity online and found that there was already a pending authorization for the wrong amount. We told the waitress this and she told us that can't be right, and ran off again muttering something about a manager. We waited...and waited. The manager finally came over with some papers in hand and showed her what they had done to reverse the charge. Then he proceeded to ask, \\"What can I do to make this better?\\" Um, you tell me Mr. Manager! He proposed that he write her a check now for the amount, and she can drive her butt up there later to pay him back. WTF? I thought that was an awkward solution. At the time, I didn't want to ask for a comp on the meal but now I wish I had! No offer of appeasement, nothing. $77.00 for someone else's meal for 7-10 business days until the bank decides to release it. I think that is worth something more than an offer to write a check.

I actually feel BAD for writing this review because my friend knows the owner. But.... Listen up OWNER. \\n\\nI lived in Japan for a little while and know what the style and experience is like. What they do have over there? EXCELLENT SERVICE! What does Shiki offer? AWFUL SERVICE!\\n\\nI will talk about the food after, but let's chat about why I will probably never go back here. \\n\\n1) Charging for cake cutting service. YES, I understand that some restaurants do charge for cake cutting fee per person. BUT there was a very very short list of desserts... maybe like 2-3 things. And this is a BIRTHDAY cake I'm bringing in. It's not even an upscale restaurant where they offer an extensive list and charging for cutting cake from an outside vendor is justified.\\n\\n2) Two waitresses in the restaurant. I wish the other one was our main server, but the one that served us threw a little BIG attitude that I did NOT appreciate or expect from a Japanese run restaurant. \\n\\n3) We are here to celebrate. We are in public. We are allowed to do more than whisper. Yes, we had a crowd of 10 people. Yes, in a crowd, the volume is maximized because we're together. Is this normal? YES. We were asked to lower our voices although we were all speaking in normal tones and laughing and having a good time. I understand that people like to enjoy their dinner and be able to hear themselves, but the way the waitress handled it was just unwarranted. She didn't explain to us exactly why we were to lower our voices to whispers in a restaurant. She just simply treated us like children and told us we were being too loud. \\n\\n4) The portions were TINY. I have never seen smaller portions at a Japanese restaurant/tapas/izakaya anywhere else. That really wasn't the worst part, but I must address that issue. \\n\\n\\nTHINGS WE ORDERED\\nWhat to Get\\n1)  Hamachi Kama - Pretty good. Always good. I love this dish. It's that type of dish you get while drinking beer. yummm\\n2) Ebi Fries - Came with 3 deep fried shrimp with a sauce. \\n3) Agedashi Tofu\\n4) Chicken Karaage\\n5) Avacado Salad\\n6) Ochazuke - usually eaten at the end of the meal, but it's so good.

My friends and I remarked that it was no more expensive than going to the Cheesecake Factory, but leagues above any chain restaurant out there (that is such an understatement... I will think up a better hyperbole later). The crab cake on a citrusy watercress salad was pure heaven. Plus, this was the first time I had been to the restaurant during daylight hours, and my, are their gardens gorgeous! I'd like to just go sit on their patio by the Chattahoochee with a glass of wine.

Jesse and his wife, Tamara Mayfield, have put together an inviting space with in innovative meat-tastic menu with awesome servers. \\n\\nThe butcher shop is in the front of the space and loaded with fresh cuts of venison, beef, wild boar, goat and more. The restaurant is in the back with an open kitchen and wine bar. I wont spend a lot of time on tonight's menu because it will change constantly based on availability as the core principles of Dai Due are to go wild and go local. What you can count on is it being creative, fresh and tasty...and often times outside of your comfort zone, but be brave and you will have a great experience. \\n\\nThe only thing holding me back from that 5th star today was our cocktails and dessert. The Michelada leaves a lot to be desired including a tart base that resembles vinegar. It might be the base beer that they are using. Either way, I would go back to the drawing board on that one. Finally, the Pear Cobbler with Mesquite Ice Cream missed the mark as well. The pear was undercooked and the mesquite beans were not steeped enough to really bring any flavor into the cream. \\n\\nLet me be crystal clear in that this was a GREAT meal and experience. And since they have only been open for 48 hours, I know they will work out these tiny kinks in no time.

Probably my mistake for getting soup at a sports bar.\\n\\nThe appetizer sampler was pretty good! The boneless wings and fries were great. The boneless wing sauce had good flavor (I can't remember the exact name) and the fries were crispy and well seasoned. The fried pickles were average but still tasty.

I did appreciate that there was an option for a half portion of pasta for my dish because I was getting full.

They take reservations the old fashioned way...over the phone!\\n\\nThe owners are very visible, constantly interacting with guests and making sure service is humming along without a hitch. It is definitely a family-owned business with several family members working there...which translates into genuine passion for the restaurant business and lots of pride in what they are doing. We LOVE what they are doing. Divine, simple, classic Italian food. High quality ingredients, starting with olive oil and balsamic poured on a plate and offered with complementary bread, are the cornerstone of Mezza Luna's success.\\n\\nThere are off-menu specials offered nightly. We have never ordered anything we didn't completely finish and rave about. Some standouts have been Veal Marsala, Lobster/Crab Ravioli and any version of their Marsala dishes. The Marsala sauce is to die for!\\n\\nThey have live music: solo singer, accordion player, et al on the weekends that play lots of standards from Frank Sinatra to Jazz Samba. The music really adds to the convivial feel of this restaurant.\\n\\nWe can't wait to go back...Ciao Bella!"},{"name":"The Original Dinerant","address":"300 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"AMAZING!!!

She also told us that they have a vegetable garden in June that you can look at outside and the restaurant actually uses it in peak times of the year!\\n\\nI started off with the Sweet Potato Clam Chowder which was the best soup I have ever tasted EVER! Then the main course was the Enchanted Rainbow Trout with Lobster Rangoon Ravioli in a Mustard Cream sauce. I wasn't abnormally impressed but it because it came to the table with the silver skin facing upward which didn't look too appetizing. After taking it off, it was pretty good but I probably wouldn't order it again. The Lobster Rangoon Ravoli was delicious and I wished there was more of it on the plate! For dessert, I had the homemade popcorn Cracker Jack  Ice Cream Sundae. It was even better than it sounds and I've never had anything like it! \\n\\nThis is a great restaurant for celebrating special occasions and enjoying wonderful weather.

When we complained, the aunty who is the head chef came over and legit scolded us for being rambunctious and that we shouldn't be complaining because she's serving home cooked food.

Firehouse is a national chain of sub sandwich shops with a firefighter theme.  The company was founded by firefighters.  I've generally found Firehouse to be good.  Of the chains, I put it on par with Jersey Mike's and think it's slightly better than Jimmy John's and Which Wich.\\n\\nThis Firehouse has a lot of local Atlanta firefighter touches.  There's a giant painting on the wall of Atlanta firefighters in front of an Atlanta fire truck with the Atlanta skyline (Tech's Bobby Dodd Stadium, the Bank of America building, the AT&T building, etc.) in the background.  Real Atlanta firefighter equipment is on display throughout the store.  There's even a book detailing the history of Atlanta firefighters.  Like other Firehouse locations, the store is painted in red and white, just like a fire station.  The tabletops have a black-and-white Dalmatian pattern.\\n\\nFirehouse specializes in hot subs with nearly 20 different varieties.  Most subs are about $6 each and you can double their size by adding $2 to any sub.  The large subs are huge and a good value.  They're ideal for sharing or for saving a half for later.  I recommend the following subs:\\n\\nNew York Steamer Sub - corned beef brisket, pastrami, melted provolone, mustard, mayo, Italian dressing\\nFirehouse \\"Hero\\" Sub - roast beef, smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham, melted provolone\\nSmokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket - beef brisket, melted cheddar, special sauces\\n\\nAll subs come on white or wheat bread and most come with mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, and onion with a dill pickle spear on the side.  The bread is toasted and is soft.  The ingredients are typically fresh and the quality is good, particularly the meats.  The brisket is smoked for over 10 hours.  Regular-sized subs are hearty and filling.\\n\\nCombos are $2-3 more per order and include a bag of chips (Doritos, Sun Chips, Miss Vickie's, etc.) and a large fountain drink.  All Firehouse stores use Coke Freestyle drink machines.  These are the machines with touchscreens and over 120 different sodas to choose from.  Try Firehouse's suggestion and add fresh lime juice (from the supplied lime wedges) to a Cherry Lime-Aid.\\n\\nIf you're not feeling like having a sandwich, try the Chief's Salad ($5.99).  I've had this a couple times.  These are large, prepackaged salads that have romaine and iceberg lettuce, bell pepper, cucumber, red onion, tomato, provolone, sliced egg, and a choice of meat (ham, chicken, turkey, etc.).  It's not a bad salad -- sufficiently fresh, crisp, and surprisingly quite filling.  Generous portion size.\\n\\nGood, friendly service.  Catering options are available.\\n\\nParking is free, though spots might be hard to come by during weekdays when class is in session and all of the businesses are open.

To my surprise and excitement, I learned Cheyenne Grille is home to the Bills Backers Atlanta and well, say no more, I've been coming here for the last four Sundays.  \\n\\nOn my original visit here, we sat outside and the service was good.  I ordered the turkey reuben with tavern fries.  The sandwich was tasty and the fries were thin and crisp.  Good bar food for sure.\\n\\nOn my subsequent visits, I have been sitting inside at the bar.  I have to say that my experience with service on game day is less than favorable.  The three bartenders are seemingly overwhelmed with tending the bar and waiting on the tables in the bar area.  It can take a few minutes to get a drink and last week we ordered food and after waiting 20 minutes, questioned the bartender and he said \\"they lost the ticket\\".  So, they put the order in again.  When when he brought the burger and fries I asked about my onion rings and apparently, he didn't hear me order them.  Not a big deal as I wasn't going anywhere and I must say, the beer-battered rings were worth the wait.  They were hot and crisp and the dipping sauce was a perfect pairing.\\n\\nI'm giving Cheyenne one extra star than I think they truly deserve because they are the home of the Bills.

Apparently there are cooking classes or the like being offered.  If on the second floor, be sure to check out the community bulletin board for interesting adverts and info about upcoming shows and such.\\n\\nThe stores themselves offer a range of products: cheeses, chocolates, flowers, alcoholic beverages, spices, gifts, pastas, meats, and fish.  The best part about it is the variety - you can find your hamburger and bacon, but also get duck, venison, bison, and so on.   Prices can be a bit high, though not unreasonable for these sorts of specialty items.  If I lived closer, I could see me dropping in now and then to get something just a little special and unusual for dinner now and then. \\n\\nOf course, more likely since I am a very lazy cook, I would end up dropping in on one of the restaurants or snack shops. There are a variety of flavors to choose from, after all, including typical deli and BBQ food to sushi and curry, not to mention crepes, pretzels, and other sweets.  \\n\\nThe tough thing about eating here, though, is navigating the crowd.  Maybe it's just because it was Saturday, but the place is packed.  Balancing a take out box, drink, and a wallet can be tough given that the aisles are fairly narrow and the people plentiful and distracted by displays.  But if you can get up the stairs and manage to open the door without spilling things, the upper level is wide open, calm, and a nice place to get away from the throngs while you enjoy your lunch/dinner/whatever.\\n\\nParking is the other nightmare, though again, I suspect it isn't normally so insane.  I managed to arrive at a time the lot, which had been full, was just starting to empty so I did not have to wait long to get into the parking lot  (don't forget to get the voucher stamped by anyone in the market to save some cash!).  You can also park on the street near the market or in other parking garages, but doing so can be extremely difficult at any time since there are a number of other businesses in the area in need of parking space.\\n\\nAnyways, I'm not sure it's a place I would go every weekend to do my grocery shopping, but it is relatively convenient with everything in one place, and a good place to try something new once in a while."},{"name":"Dil Se Indian Cuisine","address":"1201 SW Jefferson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We had lunch for the first time here!

It appeals to families and individuals who want a mild beer and some food to go with it.\\n\\nFor many, it looks like the local equivalent of a RAM, Claim Jumpers, or a number of brewpub type restaurants.  However its local community appeal and above average beer were worth a return especially during their OctoberFest.\\n\\nThe beer they brew in house is above par many of these brewpub places but still suffers from 'mass-produced/rushed' craft beer indicative of the type (bright alcohol mouthfeel ending in a limp watery flavor).  \\n\\nCouple of the draws were over-carbinated and had to send them back to stick with the cask style.  \\n\\nFinally, I tried several of the foods during their happy hour.  The food itself shows promise for the first few bites but then falls flat.  For instance the goat cheese topped cornbread borders too much on sweetness and gooeyness but does not bring out the flavors of either.\\n\\nTry the happy hour and see if it meshes with your style."},{"name":"IL Mondo Pizzeria","address":"738 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I ordered a very large pizza/salad order from here last week for work, and was not disappointed!

Honestly,  we were impressed with the food.  On arrival, I checked in and noted the relatively average aggregate ratings here, but honestly we thought the food was excellent.  My Seafood Fettuccine had clams, mussels, shrimp, fish and scallops in it. Both the fish and scallops were perfectly cooked,  despite them both requiring different amounts of cooking time, and the sauce had a delightful slow burn to it,  nicely spiced. Wife's chicken was great, zero complaints. They used a different sauce for each dish,  so this isn't just a \\"ladle the same vat of sauce on everything\\"  kind of place.\\n\\nHonestly, we thought this place was great, and we'll be back again in lieu of Vinotopia next time we're here for a movie.

The ambiance here is great. The lighting is dim, yes, but that's part of the experience. I hate when people complain about lighting in restaurants, and it really contributes positively to the overall vibe of this place. Also, I see a lot of people are comparing this to Apizza Scholls. There is an ambiance here that does not exist at Apizza Scholls and even Ken's and you don't have to wait for an hour to get inside. \\n\\nI shared the prosciutto pizza ($14) and it tasted exactly like a pie I'd had in NY recently. The crust is incredible. I definitely wouldn't call it super crispy, but it was not soggy at all, as some other reviews have suggested. Maybe I've become used to foldable NY pizza. It was perfect. The cocktails are good (my husband had an italian manhattan and loved it- $8). We shared the nutella dessert ($8) and really enjoyed it. It's simple, but tasty. We suggested to our waiter that it should be served with vanilla gelato. \\n\\nThe service was good and our waiter was not hovering, he was there exactly when we needed him to be.

I joined the UFO club back when I was in college in Houston but didn't get a chance to frequent it as much as we tended to stick with the on-campus bars and those in the Rice Village. However, here in ATX, the Saucer is closer to me than 6th street and the huge selection of beer makes it a great spot to frequent.\\n\\nLet me address a few of the complaints people have...\\n\\nParking - There is ample parking available. Face it, you're not going to get street parking if you come in during the evening because of all the restaurants in the area. However, there is a 5-level parking garage a stone's throw away from the Saucer (across from Mama Fu's). I've never been unable to find parking there, even during the annual Saucer Beerfest, where I got the last spot on the roof of the garage.\\n\\nBeer Selection - Their selection is massive. They don't have as many lagers on tap as I'd like but they have a decent collection of IPA's and ales. Their Belgian-style ales are a bit pricier--they used to be a lot cheaper and pint-night specials, but it seems like they've learned that they could be making more money on them. That apart, the entire menu changes every season (every 3 months, in this case). Also, don't forget the bevy of seasonal beers that aren't listed on the menu. You've got to ask the waitress/bartender--it's not their fault if you don't want to ask about it!\\n\\nPrice - Maybe a bit pricey, especially if you throw in a meal with the beer. I disagree, though, that it isn't worth it. Most of their beers are on tap, not bottled. They have lots of specials going on. In Monday most pints are $2.75. On Sundays TX pints are $2.75. On Tuesdays they have trivia night where you can win a $50 gift certificate. Wednesdays are glassware night--you buy the featured beer and you get to keep the glass. They have a happy hours 3-7pm from Tuesday-Thursday where you get Biggie Beers at pint prices. On Friday, the HH is extended to 8pm. If these specials don't suit you, then you're being a little too tight on your wallet. This bar isn't meant for college kids--that's why 6th street exists. If you've got a bit of cash and enjoy beer, the Saucer is a great place to be.\\n\\nCheers!"},{"name":"B.J.

The toppings were fresh. I got a dollop of guacamole. I would have liked a little more guacamole. The fries were cooked with rosemary. They had an interesting taste to them. You could have gotten a regular or large burger. I opted for the regular. I was very surprised that they did not ask me how i wanted my burger cooked. The patty was very thin, almost as thin as Whataburger burger patty. The meat was good. I liked the fact they use the \\"Fresh never frozen\\" for your burgers. The patty was almost dry but did have some juice to it. Gee, I am not at my  Sister's in Law's house where her husband burns the burgers and they are soo dry they are almost dehydrated. I did not see extra condiments available. There was ketchup on the tables. What if I wanted Honey Mustard or Mayo?\\n\\nThe wife got a salad which was large and had quite a bit of chicken. It was reasonably priced at $8. I did try the salad and it had a tangy taste to it. I am not a big salad guy, but would order one. \\n\\nI would suggest Smashburger give customer's their choice of bun.  If you want a Baja burger on a Ciabatta roll, so be it.

We were sad that we'd have to travel to enjoy our favorite - the Super Taco. When we saw that this one opened recently nearby, we were so excited. But had they changed? Did they mess up a good thing? Would we still like it? Had we built it up in our head too much?\\n\\nUm. No. Sarpino's is, hands down, the absolute best pizza in this area for delivery. I love Saccone's too, but Sarpino's does have them beat, I'm afraid. The crust is always a perfect crunchy yet soft inside dough. Delivered timely and still warm (and they text message you when it's on the way if you order it online - did I mention that? You can order it online!)\\n\\nMy kids loved the sauce and pepperoni and the husband and I pigged out on Taco pizza. We've had many different types from their I35 location and couldn't be happier that there's one here and they don't seem to have changed the recipe - don't mess with a good thing is something a lot of pizza places could learn from.\\n\\nNow, all my friends in Anderson Mill - order pizza from Sarpino's.

We heard a brass band down the street and wondered where it was coming from.  As we got closer we realized it was Bangers.  We thought for sure it was recorded, and were delighted to find a brass band performing on the back patio! Bangers has a great community feel with large picnic tables outside and inside, and it's bar and sausage display case are beautiful.  Eating outside with the band felt like a lazy Sunday afternoon in a friend's backyard.\\n\\nminus: Sunday brunch? We went at 2 on a Sunday and were only offered the brunch menu.  Menu switched at 3- lame! There were sausages from every section (one norm, exotic, and veggie) on the brunch menu, which alleviated the \\"I already had breakfast\\" issue, but I couldn't get my first choice, the smokey & the boar.  Also, the menu allowed me to indulge in a michelada bar; oh my! I ordered the cheapest beer (who cares what you drink when it has hot sauce and clam juice) and the michelada add on, and it was only $4.50. Bar was kind of empty (out of bloody Mary mix, clamato juice, and lacking worcestershire sauce), but I still made a killer drink. So brunch, not as bad as I though it could be.\\n\\nplus: great food! We found our bangers to be full of flavor. Boyfriend got the venison, and it was super good with chili. I got the traditional brat, and the spicy mustard was on fire, but so excellent.  Pretzel bun was a little dry, but I just picked off hunks.\\n\\nThe biggest thing stopping it from being a 5 are the prices- definitely a reasonable amount for lunch, but for $9-$10 a banger it should at least include a side.  Consider offering the lunch menu a little earlier on Sunday, maybe offer both from 1-3?

They don't coat them with cheese midway through to get the proper cheesy-veggie mix. Nope they just throw them on top.

Several beers on their beer list were not available, but the waiter didn't know that until we ordered and waited for 10 minutes for drinks that never came.  Then of course we consulted the menu again, waited for our server to reappear, and waited for the beer.

I complained to the bartender about the pour, who said it was company policy to serve drinks that way, and pointed me to the manager.  The manager tried to convince me that 3-4 fingers of head in a pint glass was a proper pour.  I can't blame the bartender if their boss is ridiculous, but I can't believe that the management is trying to sell a cost saving measure (15-20% less beer per pour) as a feature of their extensive beer knowledge.  \\n\\nWhatever.

I mentioned it to the counter person who told me that I can order is less sweet next time.  \\n\\nThe second time I went I got the chicken pad thai and was a little disappointed by the presentation and taste.  It just didn't taste like pad that that I've experienced at other places.  The food here tastes more like home cooking than from a restaurant.

Normally, I LOVE thai food, but the food here has not really hit the spot for me.  \\n\\nThe thai iced tea is very tasty here.  I found out that they only use whole milk and was surprised because it tastes more complex than other places..  Most places use half and half or a combination of milk and creams.

The $16 steak tartare was drenched in mustard, and could never stand up to the (cheaper!) version at Laurelhurst Market. The moules were bland, and the French onion soup was decent, but not stellar. And for all the reviewers who mentioned the atrocious service, I agree. Our server was so pretentious it was laughable. We'd order something such as a glass of Viognier, and we'd say it in a perfectly acceptable way - \\"Vee-ohn-yay\\" and he would repeat \\"eu, zee vee-zjhon-ahy?\\" It was as though he just HAD to let us know he had some sort of indistinguishable accent (didn't sound French for all his fussiness) and we were just SO American. Obnoxious. The kicker was when we used a Restaurant.com certificate we got from our credit card company - he added in the gratuity, but never gave us an itemized receipt, obviously thinking he could trick us into double-tipping him.

My girlfriend and I came for happy hour drinks before a ladies night dinner, but we missed happy hour because it is only from 4-6pm. The margaritas were $10 each but very tasty, I had the strawberry banana and would definitely order it again. Drink prices aren't listed on the menu though-so be ready for a hefty tab if you're celebrating a promotion at work or something. The ambiance of the restaurant isn't that of a place that charges $10 for drinks -it feels more like El Torito or other Mexican chains. Chips and salsa were served to us when we sat down but we didn't get a chance to try any of the entree's. There isn't any separate bar seating, and I definitely felt a bit of pressure from the server to order more drinks or food (we would have had more to spend if the drink prices were a little less), but overall the service was good.

Today I'll amend that list. I tend to like a sandwich shop menu that has a number of \\"pre-designed\\" sandwiches, but the Which Wich concept of designing your own can work out pretty well.  It's good for people who know what they want - not so good for the indecisive. Be warned - don't go crazy with the cheez whiz and put EVERYTHING on your sandwich (because they do in-fact have Cheez Whiz if yer into that sort of thing). Think about what flavors go together... although this can take some trial and error.\\n\\nI went a little crazy on my recent visit to this new location at the Triangle - Pastrami on wheat, extra meat, provalone, sauerkraut, lettuce, tomato, hot peppers (called Giardenera on the menu) and oil and vinegar. Turns out I wasn't so crazy as was a darn tasty sandwich.\\n\\nSo - Which Wich = cheap eats. Basic sandwich is $4.75 - add .75 for extra meat or cheese - which I recommend if you're a good eater like me.  Compares pretty well with Potbelly.

When I told the barista that I was expecting a pourover from a real pourover, he said that it was the same and that they just poured it over on the carafe. In my experience a pourover is always served directly from some pourover contraption like perhaps a melitta or v60 for example. It is so sad that cafe brioso which I consider one of the finer coffee shops would do pourover this way.
