From the time we got there she had an attitude ( thinking she's just tired and it's fairly busy) I attempted to push through as she told me if I order food at the bar I need to eat there and I can't go to a table. I looked around and saw there was only 1  avail.  I said I understand and ordered the food to go( she took my card and still had an attitude). Since while I was standing in line earlier I was attempting to order for pick up and got hung up on. The food came out and a chair became avail- so we sat down to eat our food. I always end up taking my food to go anyway so I'm thinking it's better this way- she comes back while we are in the middle of eating our food she comes to us and sheepishly says \\"next time when u order to go u should go to a table or u will have take it to go\\" ???

I was easily convinced that I had to try this unique restaurant as the previous reviews showcased its great pastas and delicious dishes. Plus I had a craving for some authentic Italian dishes. \\n\\nStreet parking is available and quite easily to find. It never seemed that parking was ever an issue. The restaurant was easy to locate and was on a corner lot making it a lot more visible. \\n\\nThis quaint little restaurant is quite small and is unique and has it own personality which was a plus. \\n\\nI had ordered the following and shared the fried Cauliflower, chick peas, herbs and aioli, partner ordered the Gargenilli wth chicken liver raghu, with pancetta and sage and for myself I order the spaghetti al pomodoro. \\n\\nHere is what I found about the dishes that we ordered. The Gargenilli that my partner ordered was completely over-soaked in olive oil. Honestly there was about a half an inch of Olive oil on my partners dish. My order of Spaghetti al pomodoro lacked flavour and seemed very bland and plain. The appetizer that we ordered Caulifower was the only delicious item that we ordered. \\n\\nI am disappointed in my experience as the fellow yelpers were raving about their positive experience.\\n\\nI had notified the waitress about the over excessive use of the Olive oil on my partners order and she had indicated that she would let the kitchen know about the issue. It felt that the establishment did not care nor wanted responded to the issue.\\n\\nI was going to order the dessert, and was planning to try the Olive oil cake - however having this experience had swayed me not to order this dessert.\\n\\n:("},{"name":"Townsman","address":"120 Kingston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Oh--where to begin...\\n\\nThe whole night started off poorly when my friend who had made the original reservation, requested to change our reservation from 7pm to 7:30pm. After calling the restaurant and being denied the change in reservation times, he was able to find 7:30pm available via OpenTable. After another call back, the hostess agreed to change the reservation time. While I understand that restaurants are busy, this seemed a bit peculiar and there were actually several empty tables when we came in for our 7:30pm reservation.\\n\\nOnce we were seated for our reservation, we started off with the beef cheek pierogies (per other Yelpers) and the lamb crudo (per our waiter). The pierogies were not bad--the part of the pierogie that actually had meat in it was pretty tasty, but there wasn't much to go around in the three that were served to us. The lamb crudo was served with yogurt, some sort of cumin sauce, and strawberries. This dish made for an interesting flavor combination, but I am not sure it was successful.\\n\\nAnother weird quirk in this restaurant is that they serve their pumpernickel and honey butter starter, after the appetizer round. I didn't mind this too much, and this was easily the best part of the meal as the bread and butter provided the perfect amount of salt and sweetness.\\n\\nMoving on to the entrees, I was very excited to try out the game hen for two that everyone has been raving about on Yelp. Unfortunately, I was unable to order it. \\n\\nWhy, you might ask?\\n\\nNo...not because they had run out, but because THEY HAD TAKEN IT OFF OF THE MENU!! I don't understand how you even decide to take your most popular dish off the menu.\\n\\nIn its place, they had a whole fish for two, which our waiter mentioned was quite good--because my friend is not one to eat around fish bones, we double-checked to make sure that it came deboned. Our waiter let us know that it did so we ordered it.\\n\\nThe fish dish itself was quite large and came served upon soba noodles and was stuffed with grilled ramps. The fish was cooked decently, but I wasn't really a fan of the grilled ramps as they didn't provide much flavor to complement the fish. The noodles, on the other hand, were very tasty and were our favorite part of the dish. While this fish was not quite hitting our standards for what we were expecting for a $50 dish, it was decent enough--that is until we started pulling fish bones from our mouths. Not one or two bones, but a large number. At one point I had to spit out an entire mouthful of fish since it was just riddled with bones. I don't know how many bones are allowed in a \\"deboned\\" fish, but this seemed like a lot. And for me, nothing ruins a fish dish like getting a couple bones.\\n\\nAfter we let our waiter know, he called over his manager and she took my napkin and the plates with bones to show the chef. However, this would be the last we would see of her as she never came back to check in on us and ask us if we would like anything else in place of the fish. In addition, our waiter hardly made eye contact with us and seemed to avoid us the rest of the night, save the time he ran by to give us dessert menus.\\n\\nNeedless to say, we were sort of over the meal at this point and decided to skip out on dessert and asked for the bill. As the bill was brought over, we were shocked to see that they had charged for the fish dish that we had barely eaten, considering the plethora of bones we encountered while eating it. Once our waiter appeared again, we called him over to just mention that in our opinion, the fish we had ordered did not meet our standards or the $50 price tag. He quickly apologized and had it run by his manager to remove the item from our bill. After paying, we quickly got out of there as the total meal time was approaching two hours.\\n\\nWhile the food was lackluster and had its own issues, what really killed me was the lack of customer service and etiquette showcased by both the manager and our waiter, as well as with the hostess when we booked the reservation. We were constantly searching for our waiter most of the night as he seemed to disappear for long periods of time. In addition, the fact that we were not approached by the manager after the fish bone debacle was shocking to say the least. For a place that markets itself as a $$$ restaurant, my minimum standards for service were not close to being met.\\n\\nIn addition, I still do not understand why their most popular dish was removed from the menu. I understand that menus change, but if that's the case, they should also change their online menu to reflect the current menu being served.\\n\\nOverall, I know this place is new and still working out the kinks, but their issues go far beyond the food and appear to be deeply ingrained in the management of this restaurant. I'm really hoping that I just got them on an off night, because based on that experience, I will not be back any time soon."},{"name":"Element Bistro","address":"6315 Lookout Rd","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"My daughter and I tried this place once for Happy Hour when we were moving to Niwot in Nov..

Their lunch special is $10 for a 10 inch pizza, small salad and a drink which is an awesome deal.  The star of the show was definitely the Ooh LaLa, one of the best pizzas I've had in a long while.

Once seated, We waited for 3-4 minutes before we were spoken to. We were ready to order so we did. Our appetizer came out before our waters. Our food took an appropriate amount of time to arrive but one order was wrong, probably because our server didn't write it down. The pizza was sub-par.

Meatloaf was great as well."},{"name":"Nickey's Pizza","address":"64 Lynnfield St","city":"Lynn","stars":"4.5","text":"Small joint, we came here after a training at MGH with a few coworkers and was not disappointed.

It's a must-see! Even though you don't like donuts, just stop by to check out the place out. \\n\\nI came here for the first time last year and tried their famous maple bacon bar and cock-and-balls donut. The maple bacon bar is like eating pancakes with a side a bacon. It sounds weird, but it tastes good. The cock-and-balls is just two chocolate bars perpendicular to each other with vanilla pudding in the \\"balls\\". They make great party favors for bachelorette parties and those crazy nights with the girls only.\\n\\nOn my second visit, I got the maple bacon bar and got another specialty, the Tex-ass. A huge glazed donut that is about the size of a regular dinner plate. It probably would go straight to your ass if you eat the entire thing by yourself. Fortunately, my friends helped me eat it.\\n\\nWhat I find hysterical is that they offer wedding packages for their two locations, but they offer more options at their Davis Street location than at this location. I didn't see where people can get married, but I assumed it was upstairs since I saw a roped off staircase. If you don't want to get married, they do offer a commitment ceremony for $25.\\n\\nThey are not the best donuts I ever had, but I really enjoyed the novelty of them. If you don't wait in the long line during the day, head back here again at night. Hardly anyone in line. I would say that this place is similar to Psycho Donuts in Campbell back home."},{"name":"The Optimist","address":"914 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Very good seafood, we had a large group and the service was exceptional.

This is not an upscale restaurant so don't expect Texas de Brazil type ambiance, it's still located in a strip mall so don't expect anything lavish, however for $25 per person not only is this a nice place with great food but also great service.\\n\\nService was very friendly and attentive, we were promptly served our drinks and traditional Brazilian cheese breads which were freshly baked  and once we got our plates from the salad bar the servers started the meat parade which never let up.

The slices of water shoot bamboo and wood ear mushroom added another layer of texture to the already chewy, springy noodles. \\n\\nShiyo, super sized (5 pieces of meat) - Despite having a nice pork flavoring, the broth was too salty and fatty for my liking. \\n\\n+$1 to upsize to a L / -$1 to downsize; well worth upsizing, hefty portion of noodles!\\n\\nDon't forget to ask for a frequent purchaser card.

We started our meal with the queso fundido con chorizo (big fan of their chorizo here, just like homemade by abuela) and added two Jalisco margaritas.

My family and I were driving through Atlanta on our way to Blue Ridge, GA for some vacation time, and wanted a place that would be great food, at a great price, and close to I-75 so we didn't have to wander too far off the beaten path, since we are traveling with a 4 year old.  A quick survey on Yelp, and we wind up at Mary Mac's Tea Room.  This place was as advertised, great Southern food, with friendly service, in a place that had some real Southern charm to it.  \\n\\nBefore we started our meal, we had the privilege of enjoying a Pot Likker (you get one on the house if it is your first time).  My best description would be a small cup of broth with collard greens, with a side or corn bread.  It was really a treat, and something I have never seen in any other restaurant.  As for the main course, they are known for fried chicken, and I haven't met a piece of friend chicken I didn't like.  It was moist and friend well, so as not to be overly greasy.  I ordered a side of white gravy, which proved to be an excellent decision, as it really made it over the top good.  \\n\\nFor sides, you can't go wrong with cheese grits.  Sometimes I wonder how I spent the majority of my childhood life ignoring the goodness that is grits, let alone cheese grits.  These are quite cheesy, definitely buttery, and bowl licking good.  The sweet potato souffle is also not to be missed.  Whipped sweet potatoes topped with caramelized marshmallows, you just can't go wrong.  The kids portions here were also quite good, and the hot dog we ordered for our son was better than your average, run of the mill hot dogs as they toasted the bun.  We will definitely be back when we head through Atlanta again."},{"name":"Adelitas","address":"5178 Victoria Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I love this place !

GREAT IDEA!  We didn't have a reservation so there was a 45 minute wait.  The staff kept us in the loop and it was a great night for sitting outside.  Once seated our server went over the specials.  The habanero mango drink was way too small.... but that's only because it was rather tasty.   I wasn't a big fan of the $35 lobster entr√©e, but it was an ample portion and quite tasty.  We also had the Seafood Siam Stir Fry which was delicious and also a nice portion of food. If you get a chance, get out there and people watch on the patio.

It's probably unfair to compare it to Santouka which is a chain, but I think as you can tell from my rating that I think highly of this new ramen spot in the area. \\n\\nStaff was friendly and polite. Service was quick. I love that they have a mesh bag for your bag at the side of your table. They definitely brought this over from Japan. No more trying to balance your handbag on your chair and no praying that the contents inside will stay intact. Thank you for whoever decided to bring this concept over! \\n\\nThe ramen noodles here are possibly one of the best I've had in Boston. So chewy! I had miso broth and at least I didn't leave feeling like I'd dumped an entire jar of salt in my mouth. At other places that I will not name, I would have left the place looking for a two-gallon spring water bottle. \\n\\nI would recommend getting the combo sets, especially the karaage (fried chicken) one as well as the gyoza set. For about $15-16 depending what size of ramen bowl you order, you are pretty much full for the next few hours. That gives you ample time to roam around Harvard Square before your next meal. It's a good deal if you like variety in your meals. \\n\\nThey have a location in Toronto, which I have also tried. It's just as good as this one.

Our group of 3 was seated immediately. (I'd say around 10 or so, the busyness picked up and the place seemed pretty full.)\\n\\nFood: There are a lot of options for food! I'm not vegetarian, but it still made me happy to see the variety! I had the tamale breakfast and added refried beans. So good with the corn tortillas. The salsa was REALLY delicious, and I'm not usually a big salsa person. It tasted fresh and bright (definitely not spicy, if that's what you're hoping for though). The sweet potato pecan tamale is great! I'm really happy I went with it. It's that fine line of sweet and savory. My husband had the veggie chorizo taco. He enjoys vegetarian meals once in a while, but can't live without the meat. He said that he can definitely tell it's veggie but it still very satisfying and yummy. My friend got the zucchini migas plate and enjoyed hers as well! And price-wise, it's all very reasonable. Not too expensive!\\n\\nDrinks: I couldn't say no to coconut water (it is canned though). So I ordered a latte with hazelnut syrup to-go. Husband had black coffee, and my friend had an almond latte with mint. Definitely don't leave without trying their coffee! Or get it to-go at least!\\n\\nAmbiance: Lovely casual, hipster cafe. We opted for indoors, but they have a nice covered patio (dog-friendly) with some fans. They have a bar section as well as indoor restaurant. Clean, eclectic decor, very classic Austin!\\n\\nService: Our server was so sincerely friendly. Service was at a medium pace, it did feel a little slow though.\\n\\nParking: The private parking lot is small for the size of the place. So you might be SOL searching. Again, we arrived 9:30a on a Monday but there were still 3 or 4 spots left. When we were leaving, the lot was full and there were people circling.\\n\\nOverall, I was very pleased!!

We made our way through more of the starters with the Tuscan Onion soup which was a great take on the French Onion. Our table had Stuffed Shells, Fettucine Carbonara, and the Chicken Sorrento. The meat sauce with the Shells has probably been the best meat sauce we've had recently - perfect tomato tang with a hearty serving of meat. The lemon sauce with the Sorrento was also exquisite - chicken was cooked perfectly tender and the capers and mushrooms add just enough excitement.

She had forgotten to include it with the original order.  We only had water to drink.  Glasses only were refilled once we had completed our meals.  There was quite a wait to get our bill as well as to get my change back.  With all that said, the service was always friendly and engaging, just not very attentive and slow.  \\n\\nOverall, not a really bad experience and the food was okay.  However, these days with so many choices out there, along with other wing places that offer meatier choices for comparable price ... I likely will choose another place for wings."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I LOVE Voodoo Doughnuts!

Since it just opened, the line is generally quite long. The sitting is a bit awkard here, there are two large tables that gets shared with a bunch of small tables.

The broth is creamy and tasty, a bit salty but not too salty to drink, the noodles have the right texture and are chewy, you can also add $1 for large and $1 less for small. I got the large and had trouble finishing it. Santouka has displaced Sapporo ramen as my favorite ramen place in Boston :)\\n\\nEdit: After a few menu changes and many more visits, I can still say this is the best ramen joint in Boston. Everything I have gotten is simply delicious. Their new dipping ramen is sooo good! The dip was so delicious that I took the dip home and made 2 more meals out of it! I also really love their jalapeno ramen, its just the right level so spicy and the broth is so creamy and tasty.

Poor Calvin's is the \\"absolute fusion\\" and a culinary fusion it indeed is. \\n\\nLobster wontons:\\nVery unique and interesting. I didn't care of the berry compote glaze on top. It threw off the flavor profile for me. The filling was okay/good. The oregano was very prominent and therefore felt this to feel more italian. Didn't love it. Didn't hate it. \\n\\nSeafood spring rolls:\\nThis was just okay. Crispy exterior with the interior filling that reminded me of Chinese take out egg rolls. I did appreciate the full size shrimps. \\n\\nChicken and sweet potato waffles:\\nPersonally, didn't like it. The waffles were DRYYYYYY and cakey, even with the syrup. The chicken's seasoning was a bit off for me. Had a little heat but also tangy/sour..... not the flavor profile I had imagined but also wasn't well executed. \\n\\nCrab meat grilled cheese:\\nThe waitress raved about this one, maybe a bit too much. As it sounds, imagine grilled cheese with crab meat and there you have it. That's your meal. Can't really mess it up. The French fries were crispy and well seasoned and should've been left alone. They drizzled wasabi mayo and balsamic glaze over the French fries!- a big fat NO. Do yourself a favor and ask for the sauce on the side at least. \\n\\nShrimp Cajun sausage and cheese grits:\\nThis was was good. The grits weren't as cheesy as I thought and a lot more kernel texture which I didn't mind. The tiger shrimp and andouille sausage were also good.

It didn't seem to be over crowded and neither did it seem that they were short in servers at the time. However, 30mins has already passed since we've placed our entree order with the waiter, and instead, we've noticed that other parties arrived after us had already gotten their entrees brought to their table. Thinking perhaps our waiter may have misplaced the order, I politely asked the other waitress (EMILY), who actually did brought our appetizer to the table, if she could check in the kitchen whether or not our entree orders had been ready. So, she went in and came right back out with two entree order which appear to be sitting in the kitchen probably being neglected from being served. I could feel that the food is not as hot as you'd imagine (grilled Mahi), as i placed my hand over the food to felt the temperature. With that, I politely asked her if the food has been sitting in the counter for too long and perhaps if she could help reheat the dishes. She then said, \\"no, it hasn't been THAT long!\\", and then mumbled, \\"you got be more patient!\\". Obviously, the food would not taste any better at that point being told that such. This Valentine's Day treat at that point had became a disaster at that point...I then asked for the manager and explained the situation to him, and fortunately the manage was being reasonable and apologetic about the unacceptable action by Emily's end. So just as I thought we could forget about it and move on, things has gotten worst when I walked pass by Emily to go to bathroom. Instead of coming up to me and apologize, she gave me such a nasty look like I owed an apology to her. With all this, we've decided not to ever go back to the restaurant again, not recommend anyone to go to the restaurant! If you did, just be sure to request for another waiter if you encounter Emily!

And before I go any further.. the place is actually called de-NOVO.. I feel like the owners are probably those kind of people that get really emotionally upset if you misspell the name like people who feel the need to correct you when you don't say THE Ohio State University (they really need to calm down with that). Anywho let's get down to the meat, alligator meat to be specific. First off DON'T try the alligator tacos.. unless you have a weird fetish for chewing something so tough and tasteless it would make yoga mats blush with envy. With that being said, the drinks and the rest of the food are super on point and the interior is everything you could ever want and more. It's like the love child of Louis XIV on crack and Bansky.. you know.. but on a Columbus scale. Really though, you have to see it for yourself. Only downhill is you might have to sit through the symphonic soothing tones of the construction going on literally right next door. Overall, de-NOVO (see I made sure to spell it right) is a lot like the still-single billionaire old guy in the Bentley Continent.. it's kinda over-the-top, slightly nauseating (seriously, avoid the alligator), dressed to the nines, and yet somehow it all works and his current 19 year old \\"girlfriend\\" is hotter than any chick you've ever pulled combined.

Walking in, you see a ton of eclectic/artsy/antique things all over. For example, there was a huge bird cage turned into a lamp with metal birds hanging from the top. It was cute. There were a ton of tiny tables. Would be ideal for meeting to have an espresso and a pastry, but we had to pull together two tables to have all four of us sit together. \\n\\nI ordered the chicken salad sandwich and a side of the potato salad. The chicken salad was quite tasty. It had large chunks of chicken and likely a mayonnaise-y mixture. It was good, not too overpowering. The potato salad had a TON of dill and mustard seeds. I tried to scrape some of it off, but it was quite overpowering. Other's meals looked good as well. Salads looked fresh. They had two soups of the day listed, but when we tried to order one of them, the girl looked at the board, then said, I'm not sure why it says that, we don't have that one today.... ok... then change the chalk board? \\n\\nOverall, cute place, probably will go back there but for a pastry and coffee instead of lunch."},{"name":"The Optimist","address":"914 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Hubby and I are attempting to have a date night once a week. Naturally, that would entail trying one new restaurant per week on date night since we both love to eat!

I would suggest making a reservation as it was a full house the night we visited. \\n\\nThe inside is nautical meets cosmopolitan feel. Felt like I was back in Miami a bit with the big open space and high ceilings while eating seafood.\\n\\nThe menu is simple and easy to review. It seems like most people for dinner stuck to items offered and served on china but being my first time and to be macro friendly we ordered the \\"the refuge\\" plateaux for two plus a dozen extra oysters. People seem to slightly dress up for dinner here so that might be why. \\n\\nThe wait for the food was short, but they still offered us some of the complimentary bread. In addition my husband drink was excellent. I was surprised. \\n\\nThe plateaux consists of shrimp, lobster crab, ceviche, and oysters.\\n\\nI have to say the plateaux offerings were surprisingly fresh for Atlanta being land locked. However, the oysters of chefs choice were not my cup of tea (to muddy and grimy tasting). But the other dozen oysters we ordered that my husband and I personally picked were excellent.

If I was to rate on burger alone, I would give it a 5. Best burger in Austin so far. One of the best burgers I've ever had, anywhere. Yes, it took awhile to arrive. That's what happens when you have to stuff and cook each burger to order. No problem there, I expected it and arrived early. I had a Localiter coupon, so I decided to try a bunch of different things and make it last a few meals. So I ordered the Chi Cheng burger (teriyaki meat with pepperjack, veggies, and wasabi mayo), some Texas wings (which turned out to be legs, not wings), fries, onion rings, and pickles (was supposed to be mac & cheese, but they were out).\\n\\nLet's start with the sublime. The burger was, quite literally, amazing. On the first bite, my hand was covered in a molten ooze of cheese and teriyaki sauce. While I was indeed scalded, I consider it an acceptable risk to have a burger full of such juicy goodness. I'm not sure there's a level of care that could avoid this hazard, but I'll try harder next time. The meat was flavorful, bursting with juice, and all of the elements blended together into a taste sensation. Yes, probably the messiest burger I've ever eaten (thank goodness for the Tide Pen in my desk). But worth every napkin. The fries were good, quite good, and served a good purpose to sop up the cheese and juice covering my basket. For some reason I can't quite put my finger on they weren't the best fries I've ever had, but they were very good. Obviously from whole potatoes, nice and crispy. A couple of them were a bit dense, maybe that was it. But very good fries.\\n\\nThe rest of my items were packed to go, and I had to wait for them after I'd finished my burger (yes, you heard right - I finished it. I'll regret it all afternoon, and I didn't make it through more than half the fries - but I finished every bite of that juicy burger). While I was waiting the owner, Ryan, introduced himself. What a delightful person. He obviously cares a lot about his food and his restaurant, and he's very proud of what he's created. He's also proud of his mackin cheese, and I can't wait to try it next time. He apologized for being out.\\n\\nWhen I got back to the office I decided to try one bite each of the other items, just to inform my review (and to try them while hot). The onion rings were good, but no different than any other decent onion ring. I'd say the same for the fried pickles. The wings, now . . . I've never seen legs in place of wings, and in fact I prefer wings to legs, so while it's definitely a crazy good value, I'm in that minority who'd rather have those small, crispy wings rather than a meat-laden leg. I'd ordered the garlic parmesan, and for some reason they didn't smell good to me. I called to make sure it was just me, and nothing was wrong with the \\"wings.\\" They assured me they were fresh, so I tried a small bite. Tasted fine. But that smell may be hard to get over for me (probably some combination of the garlic and parmesan that is just not agreeing with me). \\n\\nI'd read other Yelp reviews, and it looks like some of the complaints have been handled. It seemed to be air conditioned in the screened-in patio, so it was not unpleasantly warm. And I saw only one fly, and it was toward the end of my meal. And it was not overcrowded, even during the lunch hour. The seating is family-style, so don't expect your own table. And I had no trouble parking in the lot, and there was more street parking available if needed.\\n\\nI think the best bet with Your Mom's is to stick to the star - the burgers (and fries). It's so much food, you really don't need anything else. And why waste the real estate in your stomach? Save it for juicy, cheesy, flavorful wonderfulness. I'm looking forward to going back and getting outside of my burger box and trying every burger on the menu. It will take time.

The cornbread was good but I was hoping it would be a bit more moist, it was on the dry side. Also the lavender latte wasn't as hot as it was warm and it was a very subtle taste of lavender which was a bit of a let down.

I came across this place and it had great reviews so I booked it a few days in advance.  The valet situation is a bit weird, we came here in a group and actually parked our car ourselves, the valet was no where.  Then he just appeared from somewhere when we were walking in and took the keys, it was a bit random.  Anyway, walked in and we were seated promptly.  For drinks we all got cocktails, Autumn Leaves, Frankly My Dear and a Martini.  I'd have to say the Autumn Leaves I got was the best, nice gin mixed cocktail.  For starters we got the Fried Goats Cheese and Chicken and Pork Dumplings - both were great.  The Goats Cheese went perfectly with the mashed potatoes, and the sauce for the Dumplings was flavourful.  For mains, we got the Grilled New Zealand Lamb Rack, Grouper Thai Curry, Stir Fried Vegetables and Prik King Shrimp.  The lamb we kind of got partly for the NZ meat - so badly missing that and also a bit of a change to the other dishes.  It was really tender - I asked for it to be made medium rare - it was perfect.  The Grouper Thai Curry was good too, the fish was slightly crispy and the curry sauce was tasty.  The Stir Fried Vegetables was an unnecessary addition, firstly because we couldn't finish it and had to take it home, but secondly, it's just stir fried veges - yes it was good but I'd go for something else next time.  The Prik King Shrimp was great too and comes in a pineapple - nice presentation touch.  As it was a birthday - and I had mentioned this when I booked the place, they brought out a complimentary Tiramisu cake and a candle - which was a lovely touch.  The cake was yum too.

Whether your preference runs to puffy pillows or savory or buttery and toasted, you're covered. I'm relatively new to the world of biscuit adoration after too many wasted years of too much worrying about eating healthily (which I still do, but with more room for deliberate and decadent error). But even in those sad old days, I held a special place in my heart and stomach for road trips that involved the possibility of a Biscuitville visit.\\n\\nThose of you who've spent any time in the South know what I mean, and you're probably channeling your memories of licking the butter off a biscuit wrapper the morning after tying one on and/or then hiking ten rainy miles out of whatever forest campground you were in. No sin, pulled muscle, or headache that a bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit couldn't redeem. Biscuitville biscuits were the size of a small head and buttery as hell. No flakiness or delicacy here: just heavy glistening BISCUIT enfolding a working-man sized ration of bacon topped with a fried egg and a layer of American cheese. \\n\\nI never thought I'd find anything as good as that, until TILT. But damn, dreams do come true.\\n\\nAnd thank God, because this saves me a plane ticket to Carolina. Not a menu for the faint of heart or dainty of stomach, this no-frills shop offers hearty fare (several varietals of burger, biscuit, and sandwich) that's worth the indulgence. A $10 sandwich or $8 biscuit would serve two folks with normal appetites (I'd just run six miles and still couldn't finish mine), especially if you're also picking at a plate of their house fries and exquisite TILT sauce (what Big Mac special sauce could be if only it were made of real food). I'm a discriminating biscuit eater, but I'm an even rarer French fry lover and these are some of the best I've ever had: perfectly crisped and perfectly salted, with a hint of spice from somewhere. They even held up perfectly after a later-in-the-day re-crisping in the oven. \\n\\nAside from the burgers, sandwiches, and biscuits (served all day!), the tap list is totally legit with some great breweries including pFriem and a solid cocktail list. (There's a full bar tucked around behind the main kitchen.) It's a great informal space (shop towels as napkins, serve-yourself drinks and silverware), with lots of seating options from booths to bars to benches to a little elevated spot. TILT's open until eleven (midnight on the weekend), and they open at 7 am, so there isn't an unhealthy-but-delicious need they can't cover. Be bad, as I was, and chase your biscuit with a mini coconut cream pie - delicious! Take your kids, your parents, your cheap friends, and go indulge.\\n\\nI'll be there after my next half-marathon, eating a fried chicken biscuit and washing it down with an IPA. Wish me luck!

Now that we've gotten that out of the way, settle in because this will be one of my longer reviews. \\n\\nI've been familiar with Ford Fry's restaurants ever since eating at The El Felix and King & Duke and enjoyed both of them, but I was somewhat skeptical of The Optimist because seafood is a whole different ball game from San Antonio-style Tex-Mex or farm-to-table fare. I was afraid the restaurant was an attempt to fill a niche in Fry's portfolio, rather than based on a true love and understanding of all things seafood. It wasn't until we saw him on The Chef Show and heard him talk about why he opened the restaurant that we decided we'd give it a try. \\n\\nI booked a reservation for my guy's birthday this year and we decided to Uber so we could have a few drinks and not worry about driving back home. Our reservation was at 8, but not knowing how traffic might be, we started out early and wound up arriving a little after 7 p.m., so we took a seat at the oyster bar to wait. Unfortunately we'd missed the $1 oyster happy hour but there were still plenty of oysters to be had at regular price. \\n\\nOk, yeah, yeah, yeah, get to the actual review, right? Here we go.\\n\\nWe started out with a dozen oysters, selecting 4 different regions (NB, VA, FL, and WA); they were well shucked and slipped right off the shell. The oysters came with homemade \\"saltine\\" crackers, a mignonette, a house made hot sauce, house mixed cocktail sauce, and more horseradish. The crackers were lovely and crisp and just salty enough and I'd have eaten a pile of them on their own. I'm not a big fan of mignonette so ... eh. The cocktail sauce was just the right balance; I usually like being given the ingredients to blend my own at the table, but I was perfectly happy with the one that was served. The horseradish was actual FRESH grated horseradish, not the kind from a jar (my guy didn't recognize it at first, thinking it was some kind of shredded cabbage). And finally the house made hot sauce, which started off delicate and built to a slow burn on your lips and the tip of your tongue.  \\n\\nWe enjoyed the oysters and our drinks and spent the hour watching the activity around the wood fired stove and the staff behind the counter. Everything from the various crudos & ceviches to the lobster roll to the famous shrimp a la plancha was made before our eyes. We got to chat with the folks making the food and with the expediter as he lined up plates to go. It was a fun part of the experience and the next time we visit we may go for just the happy hour/oyster bar part. \\n\\nOnce we were seated we ordered the following:\\n\\nShrimp a la plancha: Absolutely amazing. 5 head on shrimp atop a thick piece of toasted bread, drenched in a spicy, creamy butter sauce (I looked it up online - the recipe is 3/4 of a stick of butter and a cup of cream!). Don't try to be neat, just get your fingers in there and peel and sop and soak and be messy. It's worth it and they'll bring you lemon towels for cleaning up. The shrimp are perfectly cooked and the sauce is the right combination of rich and spicy. The bits of roasted pepper in the sauce almost have the texture and consistency of pancetta and were delicious. We used the yeast rolls brought out when we were seated to sop the rest of the sauce after the toast was gone because we couldn't let it go to waste. \\n\\nThe Refugee platter came with another dozen oysters and all the accessories, 12 steamed shrimp, 1/2 a lobster, & 3 small ramekins containing: fish and scallop ceviche with melon, lump crab meat salad, and a salmon poke with sesame and crispy black garlic. The shrimp were perfectly cooked in a spicy boil. The ceviche was well balanced and the melon was an unexpected sweet \\"pop\\" of flavor. The crab salad was a slight disappointment; the dressing was tart and tangy but completely obliterated the flavor of the crab, which was otherwise well cooked and delicate. The lobster was ... well ... lobster. And by far the best thing on the platter was the salmon poke; salmon that melted in your mouth with a buttery finish, coated in just the right balance of salty and tangy (soy, mirin? something else?) and the crunchy bits of black garlic and toasted sesame to give it the right amount of texture. \\n\\nCorn milk hushpuppies: Perfect. Pure corn flavor with a dusting of powdered sugar and a honey butter that accented the sweetness of the corn. Crunchy outside, tender inside.\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the blueberry pudding with toffee sauce and paired it with a MacAllen 12 scotch. The combination was just right. The pudding was not too sweet or rich, and the blueberries popped. The scotch set off the toffee sauce to perfection. \\n\\nTL;DR: Amazing food. Fun environment especially in the oyster bar. Don't miss the shrimp a la plancha. Or the salmon poke. Everything is more food than you think it is.

You get your own drinks, utensils and condiments before you sit. We didn't realize so were up and down multiple times before we had everything. The staff was all very nice but since this was still their soft opening a bit unpolished. The girl at the counter recommended their meatloaf, served as the Blue Plate Special ($12) so I went with that. My friend, the other Biscuit Babe, got shrimp and grits ($13). \\n\\nWe sat down and after a short wait food was brought out. My meatloaf plate came with chips instead of the mashed potatoes I'd ordered. When I told the young man this he took the plate away and quickly brought it back with the correction. My take on the food... the meatloaf had a wonderful flavor but it was dried out on the edges and not hot. This leads me to believe it had been sitting out and dried out and cooled off. The mashed potatoes were wholly unremarkable. They required added butter and salt to make them more palatable. The best thing on my plate was the choux-fly corn, roasted corn with bacon, red peppers in a cream sauce which was delicious! I would for SURE order that again. It was like cream corn but not. Yum! The meal overall was pretty small for the hefty price tag. My friend said her shrimp and grits were very good and the portion so large she took half home. The cornbread that came with her meal was deliciously moist.

Once you walk in there's a mixture of seating for each individuals preferences. There are communal tables, an open bar area and booths or high tops. Exposed brick, dark and dimly lit, with gas candles adorning the tables, an excellent place for a date or hanging out with friends.\\n\\nOn a cold winter night, I opted for their special gl√ºwein, which is hot spiced wine. I've had it before, and it was a perfect drink for a cold night. We had a couple of their beers, which all had a nice medley of flavors. The mellow notes of chocolate, coffee or spices are distinct yet subtle. \\n\\nMy other half ordered the schnitzel and opted for spaetzle with mushroom gravy and the caper carrot salad as his side dishes. He smothered his meal with the mushroom gravy, and it was divine. As a mushroom and gravy fanatic, this gravy was perfect. The caper carrot salad was a great addition to the hearty meal. This meal is of size, and can be shared. \\n\\nI ordered the Maultaschen, a savory pasta dish filled with leeks and topped with mushrooms and brussel sprouts surrounded with a buttery white wine sauce. It's in the medium section of the menu, and if you're in the mood for a light dinner, this is a dish you need to try. \\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the apple strudel. It was topped with fresh whipped cream and hot caramel which was a nice light dessert to end our dinner date. \\n\\nWe were checked on, multiple times, and the service was great."},{"name":"La Tapatia","address":"13450 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"For nearly two years I have faithfully eaten at this restaurant. You walk in and it is like you are in a Mexican cantina. There is an old-fashioned jukebox that about every half hour plays a random Mexican song unless a patron actually picks a few to play in a row which happens occasionally. In the opposite corner of the establishment is a TV that is usually turned to Mexican soap operas during the day and news or sports later on.\\n\\nYou seat yourself. Don't wait around to be seated or the servers think you are just waiting to order take-out. Promptly upon taking a seat, the servers will appear with your menus and chips and spicy homemade salsa. They will then ask your for your drink choices. Choose a soda or a fresca or iced tea or whatever sounds good (they do have beers both American and Mexican). Coffee refills are free and the coffee is good.\\n\\nIf you want to order a really good queso, order it now with your drinks.\\n\\nWhen your server returns with your drinks, they will ask if you are ready to order. Order if you are, but if you are not expect to wait a bit for them to return because in all likelihood, especially during the lunch rush, about five other tables have filled up and they are also trying to coordinate them.\\n\\nSo, you want some suggestions on what is good and of good value?\\n\\nFor breakfast, they have a wonderful 3 tacos for $2.50 deal that is good. You can mix and match from their \\"cheaper\\" breakfast taco options and make your own little taco heaven. If you arrive before 11 AM, they have excellent Migas (the price just goes up after 11). Their other breakfast dishes are quite wonderful. AND if you happen to have a hangover, they have excellent menudo, both a small and a large, with or without hominy. Very good value and very large size. I usually take some of it home in a large Styrofoam cup to finish later.\\n\\nFor lunch and dinner, they have very good chicken tortilla soup, two meat combo dishes (large serving of your choice of one-two meats, rice, beans, tortillas, salad, avacado, tomato, etc.), and other dishes. They usually have a special going and it is usually fairly good (currently I believe it is Tilapia...which could be good but was overcooked and whole...eyes and all!)\\n\\nSo, there have been complaints about the lack of FREE refills, but the glasses are so large that after eating its hard to finish it. If you are that thirsty, you should probably be drinking more water, not soda or tea.\\n\\nOnce you have finished your dining experience, go up to the cash register to pay. Enjoy the time and relax.

This is one of those places where you really get to experience culinary excellence in a relaxed environment.\\n\\nI've never done a review this way broken down in categories, or this lengthy, but everything here deserves its own shine.\\n\\nCustomer service: from the moment you walk in the door and you're waiting in line because it's apparently always crowded, you're acknowledged. I hate when you walk in somewhere and you're completely ignored. Whether they're busy or not, take the time to greet/acknowledge your patrons by saying \\"Hello, I will be right with you, thanks for your patience.\\" at least. That was done here, so off the bat, already a good first impression. After that, the positive energy and amazing customer service from every single employee was nonstop. They all make you feel like they're happy to be there, and they're happy you're here. From the hostess with the most as I call him, that was super funny and candid joking with us as we waited, to the guy that noticed I was looking for the bathroom and walked me to it, to another guy coming to the bathroom to suggest it was ok if I used the men's restroom to wash my hands since the woman's bathroom was occupied and he didn't want me to have to wait, to the girl that brought out our wine who took time to make small talk and joke, to our amazing waitress who we think was a manager/owner of some sort that was phenomenal. She described each meal, each item, each ingredient, of every menu item we asked about, and broke down the elements of each meal and explained choices for someone's first time visit while giving her opinion and suggestions. She describes food better than any waitress/server I have ever had. She really made you feel like you were going to have an amazing delicious experience no matter what item you chose as its all all delicious. It was easy to see she loves and stands by the food and this place. The customer service alone is worth the visit.\\n\\nThe food: I eat with my eyes. If you're like me, food is about taste and presentation. This restaurant has the most phenomenal presentations of their meals. The presentation of the cocktail drinks, to their appetizers, to entr√©es, and desserts bar none. I ordered the fried chicken with lobster mac & cheese with collard greens $23, a lavender lemonade. We also ordered a bottle of Prosecco for $29. The collard greens were delicious because I like sweet things and they were sweet and tasty. The lobster mac was equally delicious with big chunks of lobster pieces in it and the fried chicken was hot crispy and fresh. Really, really good. Lastly, their desserts are to die for. I ordered the red velvet cake, which needs a review all its own. It has so many elements to it from graham crackers to white chocolate pieces to pearl balls to whip cream, strawberries, chocolate, it was amazing and a humongous slice. I'm anxious to go back and try more entr√©es more appetizers more drinks and definitely all of their desserts.\\n\\nRecommendations: I had the lobster wonton with caviar as an appetizer and it was scrumptious. It was like the best gourmet crab rangoon on the planet. I highly recommend that appetizer, it was so good. I also wouldn't leave without at least sampling the lobster mac and they're in house lemonade mixes. Several restaurants try lobster mac & cheese, but this one gets it right. This is not a place you go to dinner after you eat any type of full meal. Go hungry, as the portions very large.\\n\\nOverall, I cannot say enough great things about this restaurant. I'm mad we waited so long to try this place even though I've had it bookmarked for years. I will say it's probably closer to 2 1/2-3 dollar signs as far as cost but they have extremely large portions and great tasting food with originality. That in conjunction with the awesome customer service is worth every penny. 10 stars."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"At last, I have been to and eaten from the offerings at Voodoo Doughnut's original location in downtown Portland.  It is immediately south of Chinatown, across Burnside, and smack in the middle of the Old Town / Skidmore Fountain /  Downtown areas.\\n\\nThey are getting a 5 because of basic math.  I would give them a 5 if not crowded.  I will give them a 4 since it tends to be crowded.  So when are they NOT crowded?  I was told before 6 am.  Sorry, but the suburbs and a warm bed are more inviting at that time.  \\n\\nOn a cool late February day on which it was not raining, the line at about 12 noon took about 20 minutes to get into the door and another 5 minutes to order and pay.  This enabled me to make this doughnut run without having to feed a meter for which payment is required beginning at 1 pm on Sundays.\\n\\nI had preselected 2 doughnuts based on looking at their website rather than hemming and hawing with indecision at the counter.  I opted for a Neapolitan doughnut and an Old Dirty Bastard doughnut.  The first is a more subtle chocolate cake doughnut with strawberry topping and some marshmallows and costs $1.15.  The second is an overload of  chocolate with toppings such as Oreos and peanut butter and costs $1.95.  Truth be told, the donuts were excellent.\\n\\nAgain, if the line was always long, and it often is, it can dissuade one from going.  However, a field trip every now and then is indeed worth it, based on what I saw and ate.

She said she couldn't add our name if we were not there, and they didn't take any reservations. Turns out, you can actually put your name in a waitlist on yelp. I wish she mentioned this because we got there at 9, and didn't get a table until 10 or so. I was annoyed. \\n\\nIt was so busy on a Sunday night, that we couldn't even get a table. Instead we joined a community table. At this point, we were so hungry we didn't even care. \\n\\nTo start, I ordered a Lychee Cocktail. He said they were out of the alcohol for it so I needed to choose something else. There were two more cocktails in the menu \\"Kyuuritini\\" and \\"Yuzutini\\". I asked him what these were, but he said he didn't know. Okay... I asked him to bring me any of those cause I just wanted to try it, but when he came back, he brought a Lychee Cocktail, really?

Whatever. \\n\\nI ordered JINYA Tonkotsu Black: pork broth, pork chashu, kikurage, green onion, nori dried seaweed, seasoned egg*, garlic chips, garlic oil, fried onion, spicy sauce, served with thin noodles.

Initially I went for lunch but I got there too late so I stuck around for dinner which starts at 5 PM. When I walked in I was not greeted at all (I came from the upper-level entrance). Anyway, there was a real nice male host that led me to the dining/bar area.  The hostess led me to a booth per request. She handed me what was supposed to be a menu but there was no food /drink items listed in it. I told my waitress (who was very polite by the way) and she brought me a menu. She suggested the salmon but I had my heart set on the short rib for some reason. I ordered mac and cheese as a substitute for mashed potatoes ($1 more) collard greens, and corn bread. I also ordered strawberry lemonade. The lemonade was warm and only had a few pieces of ice in the glass and a slice of strawberry. I got my entree maybe 10 minutes later. I always thought short ribs had a bone in it. This was just a molded, square block of short rib meat with brown stuff on it. I honestly thought it was a piece of chocolate cake at first. It was barely warm but tasted decent. The mac and cheese was just OK. It needed a little salt. The collard greens where good but a little salty. U could tell they put sugar in there greens. The peach cobbler (my favorite dessert)  that I ordered was just OK, the crust is not the tradition dough-crust but the kind you pour over the peaches and bake. I ended up taking most of the food with me.\\n\\nThe decor is OK. U can tell they are not finished renovating. Unisex bathrooms? SMH.  The music they were paying was sexual in nature.

The fish was really good and hips were ok. The clam chowder was also meaty and good texture. I'd come back here for sure when I have the chance again. It's a classic Boston restaurant that's been around for centuries and the wall is stashed with lots of police and fireman patches from all over the county. Pretty patriotic and really good service.

Suite B217, Sandy Springs, Georgia 30328. This is a smallish storefront towards the back of the \\"L\\" shaped building on the side facing Lowe's in Sandy Springs. Parking basically sucks, with most of the spaces reserved for the nearby jewelry store, but you can find plenty of additional parking as you stretch out from the lot dedicated to JINYA, you'll need to walk a bit.\\n\\nThe first thing you'll notice about JINYA is the horrible parking situation, which has helped to keep people from realizing just how fantastic this West-coast ramen chain's first Atlanta location is. The second thing you'll notice is the line - sometimes it can be really long - although this has been offset a bit since they've expanded into the space to the left (doubling the seating capacity). I've hesitated to write a review as it's impossible to get a seat due to the acknowledgement of locals, but with the expansion of both this store's footprint, and with several new Atlanta Metro locations planned, I think the proverbial cat-is-out-of-the-bag.\\n\\nThe interior of JINYA is beautifully rendered with wood finishes in cool geometric shapes above the ramen bar. It's an open kitchen concept so you see most of the action if you're lucky enough to be seated there - I usually hit this location by myself during off-hours - before 11:30 and after 2:30 or so - the lunch crowd is too tough to get through and I can't stand waiting in lines. Right at lunch expect at least an hour wait during most days. Evenings are a bit better but people linger longer so while there's less people, there's still a wait.\\n\\nI love ramen, it's hands-down one of my favorite foods - of all Japanese food, ramen has a special place for me because it brings back so many memories from living in Japan (mostly from the fragrance, but also from the tactile sensation of slurping). For me the tonkotsu broth is where-it's-at, but I also like miso broth and mazeman dipping-style (no broth), each have their own place. JINYA offers up a LA-style ramen that intensifies the broth flavors - the idea isn't so much balance, but rather an explosion of flavors bedded in umami. Matched with great ingredients and homemade noodles, and wow, what bowl. The bowl that sold me is no longer on the menu but you can order it from the \\"secret\\" menu - it's the Cha Cha Cha (it's the garlic - I also add extra garlic, ask for it and they will bring you a jar of cloves and a press). In keeping with the intense flavors there's also a dish of \\"hot sauce\\" - it's really gochujang and it just makes everything better - use a spoon or two to really open up the sinuses.\\n\\nSome of the Things I've tried:\\n\\n* Pork Gyoza - my only problem with these is the quantity - make a double order if you're sharing. Pan seared on one side and quite good.\\n* Crispy Chicken - deep fried juicy boneless chicken thigh with garlic pepper, served with baby leaf lettuce and ponzu sauce - your basic karaage style, pretty good but I like the pieces a bit smaller.\\n* Brussels Sprouts Tempura with truffle oil - surprisingly good - I'm usually not a brussels sprouts fan but the crispy exterior adds something to these - good for sharing.\\n* Caramelized Cauliflower with pine nuts, crispy mints and lime ponzu - these are quite good and worth sharing \\n* Cha Cha Cha Ramen - pork broth, pork chashu, egg, bean sprouts, chopped onion, green onion, fish powder, chili powder with thick noodles and garlic - my favorite dish here and my go-to when I visit. I add 2 extra cloves of garlic and two spoons of gochujang.\\n* Sprouting Up Ramen - pork broth, pork chazu, brussels sprouts, egg, green onion, kikurage, chili oil with thick noodles - this is quite good.\\n* Spicy Chicken Ramen - chicken broth, chicken chashu, spinach, bean sprouts, tokyo negi, green onion with thin noodles - I order this EXTRA HOT! Quite good and a change-up from the pork broth.\\n* Tonkotsu Spicy Ramen - pork broth, pork chashu, spicy bean sprouts, kikurage, green onion with thick noodles - I order this EXTRA HOT!\\n* JINYA Tonkotsu Black Ramen - port broth, port chashu, kikurage, green onion, nori, egg, garlic chips, garlic oil, fried onion and thin squid-ink noodles - love this, my second favorite\\n* Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen - yeah I know, what's with the vegan? I ordered this on a whim and it's surprisingly good - hearty vegetable broth, tofu, onion, green onion, spinach, crispy onion, garlic oil, chili oil, sesame with thick noodles. I'm not sure what they're doing to achieve the umami but it's quite tasty AND creamy considering no meat! Try it with the spinach noodles for a different texture\\n\\nService is good but limited. Make sure you ask for a to go for your extra broth and some extra (free) noodles.

However, our last visit was so upsetting that we decided not to return to this place ever again. We invited our family, one who is currently serving in the military. It was his birthday so we decided to take him to one of our favorite restaurant. First, even though we made a reservation for 5 people, we got a tiny table with only 4 seats and they had to squish a chair between ours and table next to ours to accommodate for 5 people. I asked if we can be seated in a bigger table and the host was nice enough to change our seat to a bigger round table instead. (Not sure how they thought they could fit 5 adults to be seated like that as if one of us was a toddler in a high seat when they decided the reservation). When we got to the bigger table, our waitress who was so. So. So. So. Sarcastic. Rude. And beyond insulting. She took forever to get our waters. Then she didn't return for another half an hour to take our order. We were still enjoying our time with our family and not minding her. After the appetizers, one of the servers brought out a slice of birthday cake with a candle on it. We thought it was weird that it came out before our dinner entrees, but we did tell the server it was his birthday so we just sang the happy birthday song and he blew out the candle. The rude. Insulting. Waitress came back and asked if we ordered the cake and we said no it just came out to us. We did tell her that we thought it was weird that it came out before our entree. She then took the cake and said \\"yea let's get this out after your entree. I will bring it back\\" and took it away. I was sitting on the side where I could see her taking that cake back to the counter at the open kitchen and they just relighted the candle of the same cake and brought it to the table next to us. Mind you that the he already blew out the candle on the slice of cake so that's really gross. Anyway so we had our entrees and the waitress came and asked if we wanted to order any desserts. We all were just expecting her to bring the slice of birthday cake back since she said she will bring it back as she took it away earlier, so we didn't order any other desserts. The waitress came back with the check so one of our family member asked where is the birthday cake she promised us. She then sarcastically said \\"okay I will bring it out\\" and she brought out a tiny plate with 5 lit candles melted on the plate with nothing else to our 27 year old military soldier. On top of this insult, this waitress saw our reaction to this and added more insult by saying \\"you guys said you guys were full. So here's the candles.\\"\\n\\nIt was so embarrassing to us that we invited our family member on his birthday because we said this is one of the best restaurant in Atlanta. \\n\\nWe would not have expected them to do anything for us because it was someone's birthday. If this already insulting sarcastic waitress have apologized to us initially by saying hey sorry this cake is for another table. We would have laughed at the mere concidence and it would have been fine. However, how this waitress treated us with such disrespect and mocking us with the tiny sauce plate with 5 melted candles by saying \\"we didn't order dessert so there is it\\" is just unacceptable. Before we went out, I told the host about this incidence saying you guys are always awesome but this is not acceptable.\\n\\nManager did call back asking what happened, but honestly disappointed that he was taking the waitress side by saying they don't have any complementary cakes for anyones birthday. We explained that wasn't the issue and we weren't expecting that, but we were only expecting it because what the waitress promised us and instead of an apology, she mocked us instead for her mistake. He offered us to come back and said he will follow up. He never did.\\n\\nNever again. Will we nor our family will come back to this place and nor recommend this awful place to anybody we know.\\n\\nMind you all. The slice of cakes you get or any plates might have been at another's table and someone already may have blown their spit on it.\\n\\nThanks."},{"name":"Kiki's Kwik-Mart","address":"236 Faneuil St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4.5","text":"A breakfast sandwich that includes BLACK PUDDING and eggs on a fresh portuguese roll, and all the junk food from my British childhood!

They suggested the chef table as I mentioned I would be dining solo this evening. The chef's table was amazing, very open, and had two sides that allowed customers to engage and enjoy the entertainment from the chefs. \\n\\nA server immediately greeted me; he was charming and engaging with me. He shared a few of his favorites from section 0 - 1 - 2 - 3 on the menu. Yes, the list is labeled this way lol. After providing me with water and getting me started with exceptional items to choose from, my actual server came over and introduced himself. We chatted a little, and I finally decided on the Baked Oysters. \\nFood\\nThe baked oysters were very good but very small. You receive five fresh oysters, and they are VERY delicious, which is why I was disappointed in quantity. That should be noted on the menu somewhere.

You just eat the oysters then throw the shells into a trash trench connected to the counter top. The napkins are overhead so where it's easy to reach.

My impression of Armando's was that of a classic family-owned hole-in-the-wall Italian joint. The walls are adorned with photos of all the Little League teams that they have sponsored in the past. It's a neighborhood pizzeria that gives back to the same community that keeps it afloat. It's unfortunate that many places like this have given way to corporate pizza chains and even more modern wood-fired ovens; but, Armando's has proven that with good ingredients and pizza made right, you can succeed with a loyal customer base.\\n\\nThe menu consists of submarine sandwiches, pizza, and some pasta dishes like baked ziti. We ordered a large pizza, half mushroom and sausage and half eggplant for $14, which was a very reasonable price. The pizza was fantastic. I loved the perfectly baked crust, the generous amount of quality mozzarella, and the great toppings. There's nothing I appreciate more than good pizza dough and cheese. My only complaint was that the mushroom side of the pizza became quite soggy from all the excess juice from the mushrooms after they cooked. Still hungry after two slices, I also tried one of their submarine sandwiches. The steak and mushroom sandwich was like a cheesesteak without the cheese and onions.

Almond chicken isn't crispy anymore soggy and gross same with anything battered. Sauces in the chop sueys have changed and are very watery. My biggest disappointment is that they changed the wonton soup recipe. WHY would anyone want to change one of the best things on the menu? I know so many people who raved about the soup coming from as far away as Surrey to continue to come here for it. The buffet is highly disappointing now as well, and thats a shame. I'm genuinely upset that the food isn't the same, my grandparents will no longer be coming and are spreading the word that the food is now disappointing.

My favorite by far was the pork filet on mashed yams with broccolini. The beef shoulder was also great - better than your momma's pot roast, but with all the love and character. I had the redfish which others liked more than I did - it had a blackened flavor which would have been better complemented by some mashed potatoes vs the quinoa whose flavor ended up being too similar to the fish. The fried chicken thighs are worth a nibble but I wouldn't order them as my main dish. \\n\\nDessert? Always. My one regret is that I didn't try the lemon bars. I'm still thinking about that lost opportunity. The beignets are good if you like donuts - they really don't resemble beignets so as long as you realize this in advance you won't be disappointed.

I may go a little hotter next time, but since it was sweltering outside and so packed inside, I figured I had sweated enough. The noodles are perfectly cooked, thin like I like them, and not too full of ramen. The meat and the broth are also clean and delicious, flavorful with the fried onions. The seasoned egg I will have to come back and try again. I didn't realize it was not a hard boiled egg, but a semi poached egg. I'm not sure if that's the way it's supposed to be, but the yolk was runny. I also didn't get it in my ramen, so I had to ask for it separately although it comes with the dish.

So if you find a good spot, you tell every heckin' person you can! Ganko's got a simple menu that offers you 6 options. First, your classic Shio (salt), Shoyu (soy sauce) or Miso broth ramen. Then you have their Gankara Miso, Gantetsu Shoyu and Tan Tan. \\n\\nMy favorites are the rich and every so flavorful Gankara Miso and Gantetsu Shoyu ramens. Start with the Gantetsu Shoyu which I think defines everything you imagine the word \\"umami\\" to mean. SAVORY AF and packed with a colorful assortment of veggies including corn, scallions, and crunch garlic. If you're feeling a little spicy tonight, go with the Gankara Miso. It's not too spicy but it'll give you a warm tingle down your ....esophagus. \\n\\nI had a friend who came and asked for the rest of her order to-go. The ramen chefs poured out her broth, placed her noodles in a separate container and poured her a fresh serving of broth for her to bring home so that she could still enjoy the noodles the way the chef intended them to.

I found Lee and Rick's Half Shell Oyster Bar while searching the Yelp website.  I called about a week in advance to see if I could make a reservation.  Manager (Owner?) Debbie picked up the phone and explained that she would gladly find us a seat!  Loved it how she called me \\"Sweetie\\" and \\"Honey\\" on the phone!\\n\\nOur initial few minutes in the restaurant made me suspicious - we walked in and no one seated us.

The snow crab legs looked like they were leftover from other orders; they were very sandy, like they sat on the bottom of the pot and picked up all the sand from the clams.

But my guy enjoyed the balance of doughnut to chocolate to filling ratios.\\nThe maple bacon bar, doe. Killer balance of flavors in that! The bar itself isn't overly sweet, the glaze is fabulously flavored without just being sweet, and the bacon is a thick-cut high-quality piece that adds the right touch of savory to the sweet. I'd actually eat this again.\\n\\nService was a bit mixed: there were about five people stumbling around the kitchen, none of whom were wearing hairnets or gloves, and only one person on register who was quite slow. When we got to the front, a new guy replaced the girl who'd been running the line before and he was much faster, though not what I'd call friendly."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"One star goes straight to the hostess with the purple/blonde hair at the front who was extremely rude to my party and I. Will never come to this place again. \\n\\nWe wanted to try out a vegan/vegetarian place, and there were about 14 of us. 6 were already seated, so 8 remained. The hostess rudely tells us that they can't fit a part of 14 (?) and then tells us they can't fit a party of 8 either. What? You can't fit 2 tables together to make a seating arrangement for what is basically 2 average families? We're told that this is due to a fire hazard. Again, what? The two tables are right next to each other and she told us that we could just \\"lean over\\" and talk to other people. Wow.  Every restaurant I've ever been to has been able to accommodate 8 people- including restaurants larger/smaller ones, and they have had much more professional hostess' at the front. After dealing with her rudeness for nearly 15 minutes, we arranged to sit at a booth to which she replied \\"you may now sit there\\" as if we are in elementary school. They don't seat complete parties and we had one person in the restroom. What a ridiculous rule: if we say we have 8 people then a table for 8 should be arranged. 8 isn't an outrageous number. These are just some of the issues we had with her. After dealing with her, I really never wanted to step foot in this place. If you're going to have someone working the front entrance, make sure the person isn't rude. No one should treat patrons this way. \\n\\nI can understand all the rules and regulations for seating. The main issue that turned me off was the interaction I had. \\n\\nI ordered the massamun curry for myself, and while the curry was good, the rice was dry and didn't taste too fresh. My friend who ordered a vegan omelette ended up getting one with actual egg. When we ordered a dessert, we asked for ice cream on the side and ended up with the ice cream on the top. So while the waiter was nice, I was wondering if he was understanding what we were asking him to begin with."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Homeslice in my opinion is as much about the experience as it is about the food. Located on South Congress, your bound to experience some great people watching and see some cool hotrods parked outside. \\n\\nSo, let's start off with some pros. Pros: The food is excellent. There's no denying that homeslice is good pizza. This is one of those restaurants where you'd definitely want to take a crowd with you as you may get a \\"food baby\\" if you try to eat the whole pizza yourself, unless you come in the afternoon when they do their pizza by the slice.  This is about as close to New York Style pizza as your going to get in Texas. To top it all off-- their dough, is even flown in from New York. Talk about authentic! \\n\\nThe cons: The wait. Ever since this restaurant became an \\"It\\" restaurant in town,  you can expect the wait to be two hours any day of the week. And if your coming during tourist season- AKA ACL or SXSW, forget about it. This place becomes a zoo during SXSW, as it is usually turned into a music venue during the week. So if your one of those people who enjoys listening to live music while drinking a beer and a eating a good slice of pizza, and your willing to endure the two hour wait, then their back yard may be the perfect spot for you during spring break aka SXSW.\\n\\nOverall, the ambiance of homeslice and the experience of soco  is worth a trip for everyone. If you don't want to wait  for a new york style pizza, you may want to try their \\"homeslice two\\" their second location they opened up next door to try to limit the wait for their main restaurant. The homeslice two has everything as good as homeslice one, but homeslice two is just for takeout."},{"name":"Andrea's Pizza","address":"883 Main St","city":"Winchester","stars":"4","text":"Andrea's was the gold standard for greasy pizza when I was growing up: cheap, greasy, and decent.

Then when you realize no one is coming to valet your car, you turn. And drive up a ramp that looks like a shed. Where am I going? Finally I reach the valet but I could see the signage causing a traffic jam.\\n\\nThey only seat complete or nearly complete parties so we sat around the bar until everyone arrived. Once we were seated by this guy (remember this guy), no one came to check on us for about 15 minutes. Then the lady comes over and fills our water glasses. We ask, are you the server? No, she'll be over soon. Ok....\\nOnce she arrived, the experience was ok, but we immediately picked up on an attitude or at least an indifference towards us. It was my friends birthday so we just wanted a good meal and laughs, we could overlook her. \\n\\nShe was very curt with us while taking orders and didn't even suggest appetizers before taking dinner orders. So of course we wanted to try salmon chips and placed two orders, hoping they would come out before the entrees. They came out 5 minutes before the entrees. SMH. We did enjoy the bread that was brought out to us about 10 minutes prior to that though. Really yummy, hot, bread that's slathered with butter and olive oil.\\n\\nI ordered the chicken with macaroni and cheese and an Ol' Razzle Dazzle cocktail. My meal was delicious and so was the cocktail. The chicken wasn't overly seasoned but it was well seasoned, moist, tender, and a little crispy on the outside. The cocktail was vodka and champagne with some fruit flavors infused, DELICIOUS. I'd get that again for sure. So for me, I enjoyed my meal. No one else out of the 7 of us did. \\n\\nMy friend (birthday boy) ordered the steak and ordered it medium. It came out NEARLY well done with some pink in the middle. I only eat medium well and I wouldn't eat that. Another guest ordered brisket, too fatty. She gave up and asked to replace it with chicken and then waited 15 minutes for silverware. No one liked the corn. One person ordered mashed potatoes that NEVER came until she asked and the server says, \\"oh you still want them?\\" YES! The burger was too big for the bun and fell apart, which prompted one guest to order brisket to go since he didn't enjoy the burger. So we asked for the manager. The guy who seated us comes over and brings the mashed potatoes. Before he walked away I said, \\"are you the manager?\\" He says, \\"Yes\\". Why did we have to ask?! He then debated with my friend over whether or not the steak was cooked properly. Wow. He offered a discounted meal, some champagne, and a free dessert (1) for the table to share. I'll spare you the rest but I really feel like they ruined my friends 30th birthday dinner. He was so disappointed. The most egregious thing in my opinion is that after we complained, the manager didn't remove the server, he allowed her to continue serving us even after we told him how bad her attitude was before we even got our food! And then we paid her 20% gratuity. That's an incentive to continue bad behavior. SMH.

Everyone at the table tried it and even people who thought they hated meatloaf discovered they actually like it. The chicken pot pie was good. The chicken tenders were exactly what you would expect in the south- amazing!! The turkey was good but if you are craving thanksgiving turkey you better wait. I enjoyed the beef pot roast.

It was as thick as pea soup when I went, which is unfortunate because the view is really what you're paying for. Once the fog cleared (around 8pm), the view is spectacular. And I've been to the Skywalk on clear days, and the daytime view is the best around. \\n\\nNow, for the food... I should really stop going to restaurants with the $$$$ next to them, because I always expect to be blown away when theh restaurants expect me to pay that much. The food at Top of the Hub is probably really, really good. Like I said, though, I was expecting to be knocked out of my chair.

The place is next to a post office so it doesn't look like a restaurant at all. Parking is vast but valet only I believe. Because I was confused on its location, I parked on the street. The ambiance is gorgeous but once inside, it was a little bit hot. There's not a good waiting area as you always feel in the way of someone. As with many large parties, you are not seated until the majority is there. We (6) were seated at a large family-style table with approximately 30 to 40 other people. It wasn't a problem though. The running on the table is actually a stream of water layered with glass pebbles. The combination of running water & conversation was amazing! The back drop is a wall of plants. I took a picture. It's absolutely beautiful! Food was really tasty. Most expensive meal I recall seeing was $40. The menu is setup in numbered categories in which ur server explains. We order drinks, apps, and entr√©es but no one had room for desert. Everyone commented that they enjoyed their selections except me. I had the calamari but it wasn't prepared like I like it. I was able to try a friend's chichen and it was delicious... moist & flavorful!!! The only downside and the major reasons I rated a 4 is because it was a bit chaotic. We had 3 servers and it didn't appear as though they were communicating with each other well. We were actually confused on who we should be ordering with. This is evident because our apps (3) didn't come out until after our entrees & a reminder that they had not been received. Both our servers apologized and comped the apps but you always want the best wherever you go. There was also live music. I think it's a great date spot. There are smaller tables too so you might want to request. I highly recommend reservations; especially on weekends, as they had a continuous & consistent flow of diners. They have a lot of neat decorations too. It has a warm contemporary vibe. The noise level is high though or at least where we were seated. I couldn't hear the person diagnal to me until the larger party left. The servers are very interactive and I did observe them taking several pictures of folks. All in all, I would recommend and I would also go again. This is actually my 2nd visit so combining the 2 visits, i would keep my rating of 4.

Truth be told, so long as the defining Thai \\"four pillars\\" balance of sweet, salty, spicy and sour is present, chef interpretations have seen me thoroughly enjoy a wide range of creative spin.  \\n\\nIn an unfamiliar Thai restaurant I'll usually order a Pad Thai dish.  First, Pad Thai generally predicts how well the kitchen honors the \\"four pillars\\" of balanced Thai cuisine.  Second, and most important, I genuinely enjoy a good Pad Thai.  At this stage of my review I'll interject that I really liked my lunch at NaraDeva. \\n\\nTheir preparation of Shrimp Pad Thai combined a very generous portion of properly cooked rice noodles with tamarind as the souring agent and deeply-flavored palm sugar as the sweetener.  Both of these ingredients are the most common \\"corners cut\\" in pedestrian versions of Thai cuisine.  An overly-restrained hand was applied to the uses of fish sauce (salinity) and cayenne powder (spice heat); both are inexpensive and readily obtainable.  The result was a balance that wasn't perfect, but was pretty darn close.  A half-dozen properly cooked medium shrimp rounded out a thoroughly enjoyable lunch.\\n\\nService was attentive and cordial when needed, but never hovering or imposing.\\n\\nNaraDeva is located in a retail strip mall, yet has effectively created a calming and attractive dining atmosphere.  Lunch entrees range from $9.95 for beef, chicken, pork, tofu or vegetable preparations to $12.95 for shrimp dishes or $14.95 for mixed seafood.  For food this good, these prices represent a true bargain.  \\n\\nI would gladly return to NaraDeva at any opportunity that presented itself, and recommend it highly."},{"name":"McMenamins Kennedy School","address":"5736 NE 33rd Ave.","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Spent the weekend with my love and our bestest friends.

Our server Catina was cool and patient while we perused the menu (deciding is hard) and requested a table change which she kindly accommodated.\\n\\nSetting: King + Duke reminds me of what you'd get if you combined a hotel restaurant and library, with a dash of art gallery. It was classy. The only quibble was that the ambient temperature was chillier especially at foot level when you sat in the round booths by the windows, further from the kitchen and the 24' hearth. Hmm. Invest in some space heaters for wintry nights?\\n\\nFood: Complimentary white cheddar popovers were airy and a great way to start the meal.\\n*WAGYU BEEF TARTARE* shallots, capers, dijon, toast ... 14.

Whoa, cholesterol. But you only live once.\\n*\\"THE DUKE\\"* house grind burger, pickle aioli, caramelized onion, bleu cheese, fries ... 21. I got this beast of a burger, and it was a smart choice. Between a sesame seed bun lay a mammoth juicy beefy patty cooked to my desired temp, dressed up with an aioli and a generous amount of blue cheese. Dee. Lish. And the fries were standouts on their own too. Lots of 'em, crunchy and with a golden exterior.\\n*HEARTH ROASTED DUCK, figs+cherries, frisee, cherry jus ... 38. I sampled some of this dish, spectacular! A generous portion of duck too. Lovely cherry flavor.\\n*HEARTH ROASTED MUSHROOMS, salted cashews, thai chiles ... 12. Definitely not for spice wimps, but I enjoyed the mixture of various mushrooms with flavors of southeast Asia.\\n*PEANUT BUTTER PIE, malted whipped cream and cola syrup ... 8. This might've been my least favorite, but it was still quite good. Maybe it just needed chocolate, haha. I liked the cola syrup.\\n\\nParking: The recommended parking option by King + Duke is to use the adjacent valet service. Oddly enough, you have to pay full price if you self-park in the deck, but valet is $2. Be sure to get your receipt validated for the discount. The valet is located right behind Seasons 52, accessible from Buckhead Avenue.\\n\\nConclusion: I'm glad I could cross off another Ford Fry restaurant off the list. This one's named after characters in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, a book which seems like everyone knows but no one's read. Sorry, Mark Twain.

They were crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. I do wonder if they use the same dough as their pizza crust because it had the same texture and tasted essentially the same sans garlic brushed on top. That brings me to my next point. They don't do anything to their crust, which made it really bland to me, and I didn't even bother eating it, despite loving crust almost as much as the rest of the pizza. \\n\\nI found the sauce to be on the boring side. I was expecting more, whether it be more sweet or more herby. It was neither. It kind of just tasted like sauce from a can for me. The only flavor I was getting was from the toppings themselves. While I really enjoyed the chew of the crust and the thinness of it, I just couldn't get over the blandness of the crust and sauce. \\n\\nI got the Ginger Brew, which is essentially ginger ale, to go along with the food, which I felt like I needed to cut through the grease of the pizza. It was pretty greasy, especially the pepperoni. I got sausage on my half, and I found it to be fairly boring as well.

If I could rate the bar and restaurant separately, that would more accurately reflect how I feel about Townsman. Their bar decor/service/menu is all fantastic. I wish I could get behind the restaurant portion of the establishment, which just isn't amazing. \\n\\nA modern brasserie is fabulous when done right. You want an exciting and interesting twist on a familiar dish. But with the menu at Townsman, I spend more time grasping to recognize the familiar than I do appreciating the new twist. The food is either bizarre or just *fine.* The diversity of the menu is also a little restrictive - you don't need to be Cheesecake Factory, but perhaps a few more options could help. \\n\\nOne standout here is definitely the service - helpful, knowledgeable and approachable. They could maybe slow down a bit on the upselling, as we had \\"the plateau\\" suggested to us multiple times one lunch. \\n\\nBack to the bar - it's a terrific spot to grab a drink after work.

Our dinner here was very good and I loved the tapas cuisine. I was expecting to be blown away, yet it never lived up to the hype for me. \\n\\nThe restaurant is well decorated and was packed and lively when we checked in. The loft style of the building gives you plenty of space, though I got the sense it could get pretty loud. We were quickly taken to our table and perused an impressive cocktail menu while munching on bread that was accompanied by three different sauces for dipping. The jalapeno one definitely had a nice kick to it. We decided to forgo the tempting assortment of mojitos and other drinks and opted for a bottle of wine to go with our tapas. \\n\\nThere were a bunch of things that we wanted to try, so we had to go the tapas route. We started with the quinoa salad served with queso fresco, avocados and olives. This was my least favorite of what we had, and I left the Mrs. the lions share of this rabbit food. On to the grilled diver scallop with a garlic lime butter sauce and crispy onions, which was a let down as well. Just kind of bland. Next up was the traditional causa of purple potatoes with chicken. This was good, though I could have done without all the mayo that they used in the chicken salad. The cebiche was easily the best dish we had on our first round. So good, in fact, that we got back in and had another. First up was the special of Hawaiian Ono that kicked ass. Next we had the fruity green mango, passion fruit, and prawns, which came with a hidden little punch of habenero ribbons laced throughout. These were so good they made me regret some of our lesser choices and overlooking potential greats like the grilled octopus, empenadas or rellenos. What can I say, my lady is tiny and keeping those things off the table is probably why. We finished with the decadent chocolate torta and then slipped away into the warehouse neighborhood for the short walk back to our hotel. \\n\\nMaybe I expected a bit too much from Andina. Our service was attentive and helpful. However, the food was a bit of a disappointment and the only dishes that really brought it were the cebiches.

The baked egg scramble was what you envision any baked egg dish to be: FLUFFY! It came in a small cast iron griddle that was adorable. My only complaint is that it was a smaller portion than I expected. Most items were portioned really small but the quality of the food made up for it. The Uunipuuro dish was also amazing! The baked oatmeal was nice and chewy on the inside but also crunchy on the outside. The compote was the perfect addition that primarily was made of rhubarb which wasn't too sweet but also not too tangy/sour. \\n\\nDuring our second trip out, we got the √Übleskiver (danish pancake; 6 piece with lemon curd and berry jam) ($11) and the Broder bord (smoked salmon, house crackers, bread, yogurt & granola, beet egg, and cookies) ($15). The √Übleskiver is what dreams are made of. Seriously delicious - so fluffy and the warm! We loved the lemon curd and raspberry jam that paired nicely together with it. The presentation of the dishes were great, but again, portions were small. The  Broder bord was not our favorite dish and disappointing as it was essentially more of a snack board rather than a dish within itself. I think I wasn't expected it to turn out the way it did but I guess I should have done more research prior to ordering. \\n\\nWe came around 9 AM both times and were seated right away.

At one point,  a server even came running out to catch a customer that had forgotten their leftovers behind. For drinks, we ordered The grape crush and a caramel apple martini.

This chicken dish is consired a signature dish,  but based on what we had, it needs to be thrown in the trash. To start, the risotto, though being cooked decently, was completely overpowered by all the wine in it.   (Generally, when cooking with alcohol, you want to burn off the alcohol, so there should really only be a subtle taste of it.)  Sadly this dish tasted like they poured half a bottle in.  The chicken was also completely unseasoned, as was the asparagus.  This dish was a dud.

It's standard Mexican fare similar to Taqueria Arandas, except it's in northwest Austin, where good Mexican food is hard to come by and overpriced Tex-Mex is the norm.  To be fair, my husband and I speak Spanish and have no communication issues with the staff - not sure what things would be like for non-Spanish speakers, although we've always seen some in there.  There's always the point-and-nod method for those Texans who still haven't learned how to say food words.  \\n\\nAnyway, we've only been for lunch and dinner, but here's how things stack up: Prices are CHEAP.  Portions are HUGE.  Service can be slow but the place is so small it's not difficult to wave over a waitress if they aren't attentive enough.  Quality is solid.  Some dishes are a bit on the salty side, but nothing that sets this place apart from other similar table service joints.  The best values are the combo plate (you can get your choice of two meats, beans, rice, and salad) and the faijtas a la plancha - both $7.99.  Where else in Austin can you get a hearty portion of fajitas with all the fixings for that price???  Granted, there's no cheese and you get slices of avocado rather than guacamole and sour cream, but if those things are more important to you than the grilled meat, onions and bell peppers, then you probably are fine with Taco Bell when pressed and should just go there.\\n\\nAnd the clincher: They have the jalape√±o-based salsa verde that gringos only experience at TacoDeli, but you have to ask for it.  FYI, any Mexican restaurant worth its salt will have this in their refrigerator case, but no one in Austin seems to realize that and gives TD credit for some sad reason.  You could dip your shoe in this stuff and be astounded by its deliciousness, but it's not for the faint of heart.

Delicious clam chowder and a tasty lobster roll. The bread was particularly good and didn't split apart like other rolls I've had in the past. The stand even has a seating area. Would I come back?

Between the beets appetizer and the bread pudding dessert, I was sold. I was looking forward to this dinner all week and it did not disappoint.\\n     As we walked in the Alfond Inn, we admired some of the artwork and enjoyed the live music (guy playing the saxophone). We were seated right away. The first table was a little uncomfortable due to the sun shining in my husband's face so the hostess instead seated us at a table in the corner which we much more enjoyable. \\n     We started off with drinks. I ordered the granderita (basically a margarita made with mezcal). Tasted great and was brought out right away. My husband ordered a glass of red wine. The bread service is not your typical bread and butter. Instead it was crackers and pimento cheese. I preferred this since bread and sometimes be too filling.\\n     For appetizers, I ordered the beet compilation which had regular beets and golden beets. The ch√®vre cheese and walnuts complemented the beets very well. My husband ordered the Rueben fritters. It tasted just like the sandwich but in a nice bite sized form. For the main course, I pressed the salmon which came with black forbidden rice and bok choy. Wow!! The salmon had the prefect little crisp on the top edges and the flavor was on point. It was juicy and cooked perfectly. I ate every bite of my salmon. My husband ordered the pork shank, which came with grits and fried green tomatoes. The pork was huge!! My husband took leftovers home and he's a clean the plate type of guy. It was juicy and delicious.\\n     As I mentioned, the bread pudding on the magical dining menu was a reason I came here. When we got the menus, it was not listed. We asked our server and she said she would check. Luckily they did have it so we got that and the scotch pudding. The bread pudding was light, seemed like they used sponge cake or angel cake for the base. The scotch pudding was also soooo yummy. My husband and I did finished both desserts.\\n     The service was great. Our server was attentive and we never waited long. The chef came around and spent a few minutes talking to us about our meals. He was so nice and listened to my husband's story about some pork knuckle entree he ate in Germany. \\n     Overall we had an awesome experience.

The line loops around and you place your order right at the front of the line. So they make it WHILE you're paying. We were a party of 2 and our server gave us the option of sitting at a 2 seater RIGHT next to the line (where no-doubt everyone lining up would be breathing over your breakfast) or a bar table that was also RIGHT next to the line...but since it's higher up, you get stares instead of breathing. \\n\\nMy breakfast sandwich ($6 or so?) was a hearty dish with 2 fried eggs, ham and cheese wedged between thick multi-grain bread. It's definitely something you could make at home, but eating it at a diner just made sense to me that morning. The breakfast potatoes were not exciting. They had been sitting in a giant mound on the grill for a little too long so not only looked but tasted rather soggy. \\n\\nWe also split an order of French toast ($7), but somehow the order didn't get thrown on the grill until we were done with our entrees and we had to keep going back to remind them we were missing an order. \\n\\nThe french toast was however, well worth the wait. It was a piping hot plate of pillowy, fluffy, sweet, pudding-like toast sprinkled simply with powdered sugar. \\n\\nI wouldn't be thrilled to come here on a relaxing weekend to enjoy food with friends.

My reasons mainly include: rude service, nothing-special-doughnut, and a hype which I don't really understand or wish to share with all the eager late night doughnut mongers. \\n\\nThe counter help was rude, and had no energy to work up any amount of customer service. My advice would be, don't work there if you are miserable and miserable looking. The counter person asked me if I wanted a bag for my donuts, I said yes, and they reached for a bag and left if on the counter next to my donuts. I waited and realized the counter person wasn't going to bag it. Here I am reaching over the counter bagging my own doughnut holding up the line wondering what went wrong. Then realized I must have offended the person with my faux fur trimmed coat, this person had \\"vegan\\" tattooed across the front neck.

My guess if you're not going to get some outrageous bacon cheese doughnut, just go somewhere like Krispy Kreme. You'll probably get something more fresh and soft. \\n\\nThe hype, which is bogus, is generated with eclectic and obscure underground music, rugged interior decorations, night creatures, and hand stamped pink doughnut boxes to make people feel ultra sassy, artsy fartsy, and liberated by other \\"plain\\" doughnut companies.

There is street parking but poor direction to where the actual entrance of the restaurant is- answer? From the courtyard (which looks like a lovely place to hold a ceremony of sorts). The hostess greeted us and sat us immediately. The inside was large with a number of tables and decorative bottle-chandelier lighting. While it did not make for a more intimate ambience it wasn't crowded at all so we were not bothered by this. The few other diners whom were present represent a much older crowd (just think of your normal Park Ave demographic).\\nJust as we were opening our menus our server arrived - we shall call him \\"Jacob\\" since that was the name printed on our bill ticket and since he never bothered to even introduce himself.  His first words were \\"Hey how ya doin? I have nothing to tell you because there is no chefs special tonight because we just finished magical dining month and the chef is tired ...\\" And proceeded to ask if we knew what we wanted (though we hadn't hardly peaked at the menu).  He also did not bother to offer any other recommendations or more intel regarding the rest of the menu. Fail Jacob, Fail. He was not even remotely attentive to our table; he never checked on us to see how he food was nor did he refill our table water- not once!\\nOk ok ok venting aside let me get to the food: we started out with the Beef carpaccio appetizer. It was sliced delicately and plated beautifully, but sadly I found it to be boring in flavor; while this dish doesn't require a lot of seasoning the meat didn't carry a strong enough impact on its own, requiring more than the small simple sauce dollops allotted. I would prefer the carpaccio from Santiago's Bodega (at the Winter Park location). At least I can say besides this, everything else (food-wise) was enjoyable. For beverage I had the MBA, which was bourbon forward with a fruity finish. For entr√©e I selected the crab topped scallops upon potato medallions - while there are only 3 scallops the pack a melody of flavor; it would have been perfect if they had actually scooped 3 equal portions of crab topping; I had \\"small, medium, and large\\" scoops (you can see there is a significant variation in the picture). My wife's entr√©e selection was the Grouper on house made pappardelle - I only had a few bites of this but the fish was lightly fried to crispy excellence with a light & savory sauce. \\nWhile Jacob was our major downfall of this night, I must add a few extra positive notes - Lauren (whom appeared to be a manager of sorts) stopped by our table & delivered our entrees; She was genuinely nice and very personable; I would have preferred her as our server for the night to make a more memorable evening and probably should have mentioned something to her but for some reason I had hoped Jacob would surprise us and turn things around (he did not). The Chef also made an appearance towards the end of the night that was brief but also appreciated, and more meaningful that any of Jacobs nonexistent check ins. I generally always snag a dessert, but was really over the lack of service so we tapped out of the evening and headed elsewhere for a sweet treat.  \\nAlso, while I don't expect freebies, we had a reservation in which they ask if there is a special occasion; the hostess confirmed this at check in, but besides that it wasn't ever acknowledged.  I could see their brunch doing better but definitely would not recommend the service for a special occasion of any kind otherwise based on this experience.\\nBottom line? The food was good but didn't wow and Jacob most certainly killed the mood; Lauren and the Chefs visit are really what kept this rating a float."},{"name":"McMenamins Kennedy School","address":"5736 NE 33rd Ave.","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I love the concept of McMenamins -- turning an old school into a multi-functioning space, including restaurant, bars and hotel.

I took the 5:00 route and was able to have excellent service.\\n\\nI ordered the Cold Mala Sliced Beef, pungent and jam packed full of flavor.  The beef is sliced super thin and has the right balance of sweet, salty, spicy, and tangy.  \\n\\nThe Folded Buns with Ham and Crispy Bean Curd Skin are drizzled in honey, that pairs perfectly with the salted ham.

We went for happy hour, but found that the craft cocktails were so much more of an experience. I enjoyed the Winter Park Pearl. This was like nothing I've ever tasted. There were other drinks with WP themes. What I liked was that the drinks were original and not a standard drink re-named with a 'local' spin. \\nOn to the restaurant. We were seated by the doors leading out to the patio with allowed us a view to the outdoor courtyard behind the lobby. This was a really pretty lush view. Our server was attentive and patient as we asked a lot of questions. We started out with the crispy octopus app. This was more for my husband who really enjoys octopus. He loved it and is picky about his octopus. He said it was \\"cooked right.\\" The entree's we selected were salmon with bok choy and forbidden black rice. The salmon was a very nice size, well cooked and flakey, the black rice sweet & yum, and the bok choy added a nice crunch. Presentation was beautiful. My husband had the Chilean Sea Bass with polenta, swiss chard and tomato relish. Again the portion was more that ample, well cooked, and again presented well. Dessert was a beautifully presented bread pudding that was burned on the bottom. I'm not going to throw the baby out with the bath water because the effort put in to it was there. The rest of the pudding was good. Service was attentive and willing to answer all our questions and we never felt rushed.\\nThe joy of Hamilton's Kitchen being located in AI is the art.

He actually took my order and gave me a free drink for my troubles experience with the rooftop staff(ugh). He kept apologizing and said he would take care of it. I ran upstairs to get my wallet since I really just came down to speak with a manager but the time I came down my food was ready. NICE!!!! The other Pro, the security guy who helped me bring the food upstairs to the rooftop. RIGHT! You read that right the security assisted me in my first ever waitressing experience, smh. They both actually kept me and my friends from walking out of the establishment. \\n\\nCons: ROOFTOP STAFF!! So if you paid attention from my Pro's you will have taken note the Bartender and Security were my waiters. *insert palm to face*. We arrived right after the game  started and there were ONLY 3 of us(two guys and me). I believe there was a total of 9 ppl on the rooftop and two waitresses(one with the blindest wig I've ever seen and one who just looked lost). We sit there 8 min(yes I counted, I too am an entrepreneur and I pride myself on customer service) no greeting no I'll be right with you, I guess because the entire focus was on these two guys also upstairs, not sure who they were but apparently no one else mattered when they're around *shoulder shrug*. Any who, finally after I stopped the chick in the wig to ask when could I place an order for food and drinks she said the other waitress would be with us right away. But my thing was why couldn't she do it, oh I'll tell you why: she was too busy drinking and snacking behind the bar! WTH is this a business or naw?!?!\\n\\nAnyway the other waitress makes eye contact with us and STILL walks past us and beeline a for the guys AGAIN! So now I'm thinking they must be related to TIP but damn we want to eat and drink too AND pay!! By now 20 minutes passed with NO service or second acknowledgement from the staff!  Which, prompted me to go downstairs place my order with the bartender and be my own damn waitress.

The other option was sitting at the bar, but as I do not like to sit at the bar and we were dressed down (driving in car all day), we chose to sit outside and freeze. After few minutes, we managed to get a little table inside, so it was pretty nice that they found something for us, without having a reservation.\\nWe noticed that the food portions were huge. Especially the cakes. And after our huge main dishes, we did not have any space left for the cake.

So the whole dish was about $16 and it was pretty big, good to share.\\n- I rate my Vegetable Curry 4/5 because my dish was, even though it was very tasty, missing salt. Also, there weren't enough vegetables, my curry consisted mainly of huge tofu blocks (they were supposed to be \\"added\\", not the main thing!), so I was a bit disappointed. I wish I didn't order tofu with veggies, so I could enjoy vegetables only. Another thing about this dish - there was not enough rice for the amount of curry served. The rice I had was enough for 1/4 part of the curry only, at the end I was eating only the sauce and tofu.\\n- Pad Thai was delicious. Really good flavors and texture, absolutely loved it. Still, I would rate it 4/5 because the food was a bit too oily and I think they could have added more veggies, in my opinion.\\nWe did not try the cakes, but we saw people eating them and not even finishing a half.

These were all dishes we have had at the old location so we know what to expect and we were not disappointed!  The lobster come with linguini in a Fra Diavolo sauce which is perfectly seasoned with just enough kick and 2 lobster tails!  The fusilli Angelo consists of a lobster tail two or three shrimp and the same number of scollups in a light white wine, garlic and butter sauce with broccolli rapi - it was a bit light on the rapi but that's just my taste. The fusilli Marche consists of a lobster tail, shrimp and crab meat in a butter and white wine sauce. All the dishes were just as they were back in East Boston - cooked to perfection!\\n\\nThe wine list is much more extensive than that of the East Boston restaurant and also a bit pricier although not outrageous. We had a nice crisp Trebianno for about $30. \\n\\nFor desert we ordered their mascarpone cheese cake, chocolate bomba and a lemon torta (also made with mascarpone), they were all delicious. \\n\\nThe only reason I am not giving Off the Boat a 5 out of 5 is because we had to wait almost 30 minutes for our main courses to come out - they need to break in the new wait staff and do a better job getting the food out. I know they will work it out - they have only been open for less than 6 weeks - so there are still some kinks. \\n\\nOff the Boat is by far my wife's and my favorite place to go for authentic Italian seafood.

Actually, it doesn't, beyond the point that Maluken's karaoke is like a hadouken.   It's strong, but you're left wondering whether there should be something more.

Their karaoke list isn't too bad: a nice mish mash of 1980s and 1990s standards coupled with some public domain stuff (yes, you can sing \\"Baa baa black sheep\\").  You'll want to come with a group though, as it's far more fun that way.\\n\\nAs for the food/ambiance, food is quite good:  I got a box dinner for $9 which satisfied me quite well (miso, salad, rice, shumai, California roll, and chicken teriyaki).

I ordered mine medium well although the server repeatedly suggested that the chef recommends medium rare. Listen....people have preferences. My preference is medium well so do what you want. I asked for my eggs scrambled too. This was a new take on their steak and eggs because previously it was served differently. I like the version better. It was so delicious. The steak wasn't really tender but it was well seasoned. I do wish they had scrambled my eggs a little more so they weren't runny but fluffy. All in all, it was a solid choice. The sourdough bread was such an interesting twist to the dish.\\n\\nFor dessert, I ordered the doughnuts. The four of us were able to have a half of a doughnut and one person opted for the doughnut ball so it was enough to share. Similar to krispy kreme but much more dense. \\n\\nYeah this meal was great and I might bring my parents back here soon.

They didn't have a reservation list but they did have a preferred seating list.  I don't know if that's standard for them, but it worked out fine.  It was about a 10 minute wait, which was fine considering how many people were waiting to be seated. \\n\\nThe bread was great.  The moment I saw it, I said, there is no way I'm keeping passover today. There were 3 varieties.  We got the special all you can eat family style meal and our server, Tamika, asked us several times if we needed refills on any of the dishes even though we hadn't finished anything yet.  I appreciated that, and even without any refills, 3 entrees and 3 sides plus bread and dessert was way too much for us so she let us bring it home even though it says no doggy bags.  Everyone there was very nice and happy and friendly so 4 stars for service.\\n\\nThe food was good but I would only give it 3 stars. We got the ham (it was Easter after all...), Fried Chicken, and Roasted Chicken.  The selection was limited because it was a holiday so I figured, if we can't finish, we can bring home the roasted chicken, and we did.  The fried chicken was a little soggy on the underneath, I don't know if that's normal.  The ham was soft and juicy.  We didn't try the roasted chicken yet... just packed it up for leftovers.  The whipped potatoes were standard, and while the broccoli souffle and tomato pie were both tasty, they were overly greasy and a little salty.  The banana pudding and peach cobbler were both yummy but not the best I've ever had.\\n\\nIt's definitely worth a trip to Mary Mac's if you just moved to Atlanta or if you have some visitors who want a taste of southern cooking and southern hospitality, but this isn't a place I see myself eating regularly."},{"name":"Korita Sabor Casero","address":"5800 NE Mlk Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"I had a cheese pupusa.

The capellini was cooked very well and the garlic tomato sauce was very tasty but the issue was that the lobster chunks were tough, chewy, and smelled fishy. Obviously this lobster was past it's prime and then over cooked... Sad day. So I ventured over to help my husband with the giant plate of risotto and lamb. The lamb was tough and fatty so we mostly dined on the creamy risotto but the issue this time was the risotto was super thick and sticky like it was over cooked!

We started w/the corn soup that had a ridiculously large piece of smoked salmon floating in it. The salmon, in my opinion, was completely out of place and altered the taste of the soup -- in a bad way. I got the mushroom risotto after the waitress raved about it. It was good, but not the best risotto I have ever had. Don't think the risotto was cooked long enough. It tasted like mushroom but it was not as creamy or decadent as I imagined it would be (especially since truffle was used in the description). My husband ordered the salmon and bluntly said he could make it at home better himself. He expressed his displeasure, and the staff just said they would talk to the chef. His chief complaint was it lacked flavor, shocking considering the reputation on this place. We got the bread pudding with pumpkin ice cream for dessert. Again, it was fine. But nothing near the best thing I have ever eaten. I love warm bread pudding that falls apart as you scoop it up. This one was not really that warm and not really falling apart.

Now granted I have not tried many items, but a server even told me about some items I questioned on the menu. Doesn't mean the food is bad. If anything it's consistent. For example there is 2 choices of GFS sausage gravy available, and one is bland, while the other is much better than the homemade gravy many restaurants brag about. After just having an Irish Breakfast Shot the other day, I inquired if it was the same. \\"Yes, but we're out of Jamesons, so it's Makers Mark\\". Hmmm. \\n\\nI've tried the biscuits & gravy, breakfast burrito, pancakes, and today the country fried steak. All are OK. Pancakes were a bit chewy from over mixing. The bacon is the best thing going.

That's a good reason for a pub to open it's doors early enough to serve breakfast.\\n\\nAll the tables are high tops since years ago when they had booths. Good luck to anyone in a wheelchair, looking up at everyone eating. A small stage for a single performer is at one end. A jukebox competes with all the TV's. This is a Cleveland Browns fan hangout.

Certainly makes me wish I'd been flying like the biscuits that are so daintily painted on the walls! The restaurant is quite adorable -- brightly colored, flowered table cloths and walls that are decorated to match, with even the lamps painted as sunflowers to blend in. \\n\\nThere are too many good sounding options for breakfast, so I stuck with the wings-theme and got a little bit of everything in the High Flier. I have a big appetite to begin with, and after weeks of training, and having eaten nothing that day by mid-afternoon, I was ready for a big meal (that wasn't an MRE). But the High Flier was too big for me! Seriously, this was made for someone who was flying high, but not the kind of flying/jumping I'd been doing. This meal was straight munchies status.\\n\\nWhat the High Flier came with: two large farm fresh eggs served with their signature chicken breakfast sausage and creamy dreamy grits, plus an organic oatmeal pancake with warm peach compote (on the side), served with maple syrup. And of course a flying biscuit with homemade cranberry apple butter. The eggs were eggs. The sausage didn't even taste like chicken sausage it was so tasty. The pancake was the one part that fell short...there was no amount of syrup that could have made it not taste dry. But, all that, frankly, was insignificant to the best parts of the meal--\\n\\nThe biscuit was very good, and the grits were amazing. The biscuit was neither overly dense nor too crumbly, which made for a much more pleasurable eating experience than most places that do not pride themselves in their biscuits; butter and cran-apple butter were able to stay on the biscuit without it falling apart as it flew to my mouth. The grits are described as \\"award-winning creamy, dreamy, southern-style grits\\" and live up to each of those accolades; I may have had dreams of eating them again...but then that may have just been a day dream. Grits have never been so creamy and rich...I didn't even know they could be! I wish I could go back and try the shrimp and grits and biscuit pot pie...you know they'd be banging with those grits and biscuit.\\n\\nIf it isn't already obvious, breakfast is served here all day...these biscuits musta flown from the pearly white gates because all day breakfast is Heaven-sent, if you ask me. My waitress was sweet and happy, and who wouldn't be when you are surrounded by these grits and biscuits all day? She mentioned that there was a military discount but I was quite surprised when she brought me my check post-discount and it was around $4. Four dollars. One, two three, four. For multiple plates full of food that was too much for a beastly Army chick to eat. Who ever came up with that discount must have sampled the \\"high\\" flier because there's no way that could be economical. But, hey, that works for me! \\n\\nFYI, the Flying Biscuit has an attached bakery that's only open until 3pm, so don't do like I did and think the place is closed because you're at the wrong door.

While driving on Wells Branch, my truck took over and steered me toward rotisserie chicken and Inka chicken presented it self.  Having eaten here before which was about 4 years ago, I was interested in seeing if they had evolved or remained the same.\\n      As i entered the paring lot, much had not changed which is okay.  The building use to house Long John Silvers and A&W, so you cannot do much with aesthetics.  Upon entering, seasoned smoke was airborne and it was reminiscent of previous visits.\\n      As I approached the counter, I was greeted by friendly gentlemen who explained the menu thoroughly and offered me a sample which i did not refuse.  Moments later he offered a small cup filled with a caramelized plantain, beans and rice, and mixed vegetables.  So, I ordered what he offered.  \\n      Once I arrived at home, I opened my container I was pleased to see the meal.  The half chicken was cooked perfectly and the bark was seasoned well, the plantains were caramelized but firm jewels that were succulent, the mixed vegetables looked ordinary, but were buttery morsels, and white rice with black beans were just perfect.  Finally, I was in rotisserie chicken heaven hoping the plantains would regenerate in front of me.\\n       In conclusion, the meal was as good as I remember and I must keep them on my rotation.  In fact, they have also expanded their menu by offering other meat choices and sandwiches.  The only regret i have is not ordering the dessert!

First we get there and the wait to get seated was an hour fifteen which we understood for it being Austin but still sucked. It took more like an hour twenty five and the cocktail patio was so hot even our dogs were struggling. Once we finally got seated we placed our order. First thing they tell us is they're out of the asparagus benny which was the one thing my friend could really eat from the menu since she was vegetarian. My friend asked the waiter if there was any way for her to just order a normal benny or anything but apparently they were completely out of everything to make it so she had to settle for the BLT without the B which kind of sucked since we were there for her birthday. After we ordered drinks the waiter comes back and tells us they are also out of the potato latkes another thing my vegetarian friend was looking forward to. They knew we were visibly upset and not once did management come to try to talk to us and when we asked if this happened often they said no but i don't know it's just weird to run out of things in such a small brunch menu at a place that people in Austin like to go to. When we got our food my ricotta spread toast had too much spread and the bread was almost impossible to cut through. My boyfriend said his pork shoulder hash was weak in flavor and he was still hungry afterwards. At this point we are annoyed at how the whole experience went so we ask for the check and are trying to leave. When we get the check I see that they charged us for the latkes even though we never got them. Like way to put more salt on the experience. We got that fixed but still no one apologized about how terrible everything went.

My heart fluttered in expectation that it was a restaurant with bad lighting and house wine served in small plastic tumblers.  Oodles of handmade pasta pouring over the edge of the plate provided an image I had been dying for.  Being in Ball Square, Somerville, maybe I would meet a dude and rendezvous to the train tracks behind Tufts' sports fields.  Perhaps there would be a baby in the future.\\n\\nEh. But who am I kidding?  And who dreams that stuff up anyway.\\n\\nPescatore: the dining room, though adjacent to its family owned pizza shop and liquor store, was itself a lovely romantical Italian restaurant emanating of garlic, starch, and seafood, all situated in the balls of Ball Square.  The space was renovated in November 2009 and has ample space for a large crowd of diners.  The floors are freshly tiled.  The bathrooms are spacious.  They even have a private patio tucked away on the backside of the building.  So cute.\\n\\nThe menu is inspired by fresh seafood from the Amalfi coast of Southern Italy, but the chef uses ingredients common to our Atlantic, like lobster and PEI mussels.  She features Piccata and Parmesans but to get a true taste of Pescatore (pesca: fish) you gotta go for the fish!\\n\\nI have a soft spot for homemade fusili and seafood, but I get nervous about ordering seafood sometimes... The restaurant name tells me that this owner knows seafood, though; so I opt for the Fusili Amalfi (as in gorgeous Amalfi coast ... where breathtaking cliff-villages of Sorrento, Positano, Castellemare, Amalfi and Capri are located).  At $17.95 it's the most expensive item on the list (believe it).  Dave (not someone I met in ball Square) ordered the Haddock Paisano.  Both dishes were delicious, but I think Dave's haddock beat our mine in terms of clean flavor since I think lobster tends to overwhelm the flavor of the other shellfish.  I couldn't resist the fusili.\\n\\nBut the best part about dinner: for a bottle of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, arancini, two fab entrees, dessert, and an espresso: we paid under $100.\\n\\nAnd although there was no rendezvous, I did seriously think I was pregnant after dinner... with a pasta baby."},{"name":"Spicy Vegetarian Cuisine","address":"132-4200 No 3 Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"4","text":"This place is great for small or large group!

But to big CFA fans like me, this place is such a special gem because it's the ORIGINAL Chick-Fil-A! \\n\\nI actually came to Atlanta for work and this was the first place I went as soon as my flight landed. As the only crazy person going around this place taking pictures, most people probably thought I was a tad odd. However, I have been going to my local CFAs since I was a kid. In fact, my dad told me that he and my mom ate there all the time when she was pregnant with me...so I've technically been a fan since before I was born! As you can imagine, paying homage to the OG CFA was a must-do on this work trip.\\n\\nAs some background, this location was originally called The Dwarf Grill and was where S. Truett Cathy got his start in serving customers. It initially only sat 10 people (it was small...hence the somewhat politically incorrect name) but was unique in that it was open 24/7 and served many travelers going in and out of town in the mid 1940s. \\n\\nWhat's great about this location is that they are still true to their 1940's diner roots, while also incorporating a standard CFA experience. It's essentially two restaurants in one: go to the right and you're in a CFA; Go to the left and you will see booths and a long dining countertop. I am all about that old nostalgic experience, so I opted for the countertop on both of my visits (because yes, I went twice during my stay here...after all, it is very close to the airport!).\\n\\nThe staff here is very friendly, just like all CFAs. I actually spotted a veteran who had been there 23 years (it was designated on her namebadge). They also work super hard--my second time in, it was a Saturday afternoon and the place was PACKED. The servers were really working hard to ensure everyone was taken care of. \\n\\nMy first night there, it was a Wednesday around 7p. I was trying to take it all in. However, I was caught off guard when I saw a burger and fries on the menu! So off-brand for Chick-Fil-A! I later saw them cooking a big ole steak in front of me as well! Like I said, they try to pay homage to their old roots and believe it or not, Cathy had beef in his first restaurant! \\n\\nI decided on Truett's Famous Chick-Fil-A Platter which is essentially a CFA sandwich with two sides. I opted for fries and mac & cheese. It came out in less than five minutes. I love that it comes out on diner style dishes. Makes for such a nostalgic experience! I did ask for Polynesian sauce, which they of course had. That is by far the best of all CFA sauces!\\n\\nI devoured my sandwich and fries, but left most of the mac & cheese. It was just okay. I should have opted for extra fries. I ended the night with a coconut cream icebox pie! I had been debating between that and the chocolate. It ended up being good, but nothing out of the ordinary. The second time I went, I got the same platter, with fries and cornbread. The cornbread was subpar. Kinda dry. The sandwich and fries were on point though!  I also ordered the chocolate icebox pie. Again, it was okay. To be honest, all it is is pie crust, chocolate pudding filling and whipped cream. For me though, I just tried to envision myself as a weary traveler (which I was just heading to the airport) back in the 1940's, just getting a bite to eat. Then the pie seemed to fit right in! I can just picture these pies spinning in a glass case back in the day as Cathy was serving his customers!\\n\\nAll in all, if you have any affinity for Chick-Fil-A, this location is worth going out of your way for. I'm so glad I was able to make it there once, let alone twice! What a gem! So amazing to see the growth and success of this company...especially now being able to see where it all started!"},{"name":"Banjo Coffee","address":"38 N Avondale Rd, Ste B","city":"Avondale Estates","stars":"4.5","text":"One of my favorite coffee shops!

A puny serving at $10.25, and almost inedible. The four of us sampled three of the beers at $5.75 for a 12 oz serving. That's about $7.65 a pint. All three beers were  among the worst IPA's I've ever had. The baby beer (polka dot I think, but they've wisely not listed it on their website.) most closely represented a Hefeweizen, the mama bear (blue dot) was a personality-less, under hopped mess, and the papa bear (green dot) had the vaguely redeeming quality of being a high octane alcohol bomb. Two of us ordered beers right away while the other two perused the menu. One beer came right away, the other had to be reordered. However, as IPA's go it was bottom tier. Oh, by the way, you have to pay if you'd like a 3 oz sample of any of their beers. The lightest eating member of our group noted that we'd need snacks in a bit as the portions were so small.

I'm loving the boldness that De Novo's throwin' down and if my boyfriend would let me, I'd try to replicate this style in my own home. (Most of it anyway.) But some people prefer dark wood... pfft.

I haven't seen an adventurous menu quite like this in Columbus. Again the boldness of the menu is cohesive with their overall concept.

These menu items are unique for Columbus and I loudly applaud De Novo for pushing the envelope! Both the dishes I had though (the kobe chorizo burger and curry salmon could've been a bit bolder though.

Crowds in there with anything from girlfriends, dates, seniors, birthday groups, bachelorette party and some singles so overall a great mix of people!\\n\\nThe bread is so yummy.  It's not \\"house\\" bread as they charge you around $6.  The sauces that come with it weren't my favorite but they were able to bring butter, my Mom loved the sauces.

It's in the same building as Wisteria and Il Locolino. The restaurant is from the same chef and owner of Wisteria, Jason Hill. Unlike higher-end Wisteria, which serves dinner only, Folk Art serves breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner. Over the last few years, Folk Art has been one of the best additions to the already local restaurant-rich neighborhood and surrounding area.\\n\\nThe restaurant is located at the corner of North Highland and Colquitt. A free parking lot is located in the back. During the daytime, it's self-park. At night, when Wisteria is open, there's valet service. Free parking is also available on any of the nearby residential streets.\\n\\nFolk Art is a popular brunch spot. We visited for a Sunday brunch around 1:30pm and there was an estimated 30-minute wait. Our true wait time ended up being closer to 20 minutes. There's no waiting area inside, but there are several theater seats lining the sidewalk outside. The restaurant does not accept reservations and will only seat customers when the entire party is present. If your wait is 30 minutes or more, consider walking around the idyllic neighborhood. Freedom Park is only a couple blocks away.\\n\\nI love the distinct vintage look and feel of the restaurant. A lot of reclaimed materials have been used, from the sturdy, bolted, wooden tabletops to the converted, skinny bulb, light fixtures. The walls are decorated in an assortment of eclectic art, old Ford wheel hub caps, and clocks/signage for products from decades ago, some of which still exist today (e.g. Cheerios, Coke, 7 Up, Diet Rite). While the decor is old-timey, the atmosphere feels fresh.\\n\\nThe restaurant isn't terribly big, but I think it's sized just about right. At brunch, a peak time, seating was rather cozy. We were easily within earshot of the tables next to us. There are three areas of seating: a sun room out front containing nothing but booths, the main dining room with more booths plus some high-top tables, and a small, white-tiled bar in the back which faces the diner-style, semi-open kitchen.\\n\\nThe brunch menu is served Saturdays and Sundays from 9am to 3pm. It consists of a variety of waffles, French toast, pancakes, eggs (any style, including eggs Benedict), three-egg omelets, various entrees including shrimp & grits and chicken & waffles, beef, turkey, and lamb burgers featuring ingredients such as kimchi, Gruyere and pimento cheeses, pork chili, and fried green tomatoes, sandwiches (their \\"Craft 5\\" Grilled Cheese made with cheddar, provolone, Gruyere, Swiss, and creme brie comes highly recommended), and a nice mix of sides including housemade jelly, sunflower seed pesto pasta salad, and \\"flat-top\\" mac & cheese. The latter presumably cooked on a flattop grill.\\n\\nI tried the Eggs Benedict with Whole Hog Sausage ($8.50) and Apple Bacon ($2.99) as well as the \\"Folk Southern Fried\\" ($12.99) which consists of fried chicken and biscuits, eggs any style (in this case, scrambled), and sausage gravy. The food was delicious.\\n\\nBoth the English muffins in the Eggs Benedict and the biscuits in the Folk Southern Fried had a considerable amount of char on their open-faced ends. The English muffins were fantastic. Crispy, and I suspect they were buttered. The Hollandaise sauce on the eggs was smooth and creamy. The poached eggs were soft and not runny. Nicely done. The sausage patties were small, but savory. The apple bacon was terrific. Not overly crispy nor greasy. Just thick, chewy, satisfying slices of bacon. If you couldn't tell, I thoroughly enjoyed this plate.\\n\\nThe Folk Southern Fried was quite good as well. Chicken, biscuits, and gravy. It's Southern comfort food at its finest. The fried chicken was boneless and lean. Good quality and a decent amount of meat for a breakfast/brunch plate. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and went rather nicely with the tasty sausage gravy. It all made for a rather satisfying and filling dish. Generally, I like how Folk Art's takes on these breakfast foods aren't too heavy.\\n\\nTable condiments include Sir Kensington's Ketchup and mustard. The restaurant also carries a few different hot sauces (Tabasco, Cholula, and Sriracha) which can be good on eggs. The Folk Art glasses (\\"Artful Eats for Simple Folk) are cool and I believe they are (or once were) for sale.\\n\\nI also tried a 10-ounce glass of the restaurant's homemade apple carrot juice. It was light and refreshing, but for $6, perhaps a bit much. For a little bit more, I'd rather grab a 16-ounce bottle of juice at Kale Me Crazy down the street.\\n\\nWe had a helpful and friendly server, though service was slow, probably due to the high brunch demand. Not a big deal, but something to note if you're running under time constraints.\\n\\nI had a swell experience at Folk Art and look forward to returning."},{"name":"Broder Caf√©","address":"2508 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Broder- means brother in Swedish and if you love Scandinavian food this is the place to be.

From the outside the parking lot is brand new and spacious with plenty of handicap parking.  When you walk in, you can see the place is spacious and has a huge bar.  There are at least 40-50 nice looking Samsung big screens, including a bunch around the bar.\\n\\nThe bar itself has a lot of seats and looks like a great place for a happy hour.  We of course went for the wings. The menu shows traditional an boneless wings with several interesting flavors that you probably have seen elsewhere and a couple of new ones I'll have to try.  There are 5 heats of traditional Buffalo sauces.  Labeled 1st degree through 5th degree, we asked our waitress about the levels and she related that 4th degree was comparable to most places HOT.  We usually like to go with a hot level the first time to make our comparisons somewhat valid. \\n\\nIn addition to the wings, we ordered some potato skins and French Onion soup.   Our service was excellent and our food came fast.  I found the described heat level to be accurate and found the sauce very tasty, a slight hint of butter.  The wing was lightly breaded and not crispy. The chicken was very moist and in my expert opinion, I would say they were fresh never frozen.  A mixture of flappers and flats they were good, but I like mine crispier.   I didn't later notice that the menu says you can get them without breading as a healthier option.  Not sure how much healthier they are without breading as my health is usually not on my mind when eating Buffalo wings. \\n\\nThe potato skins were less than amazing as they weren't hot and if I had to guess may be premade and reheated. (I will mention we visited around 3pm on Christmas eve and the restaurant was upfront that they were closing at 5 and were going to stop taking orders around 4.  My wife's French Onion Soup was tasty, but the bread in it was mushy. \\n\\nThe service and drinks were very good. I saw several burgers and pizza I would like to try. I will go back and try unbreaded  wings.  You may very well really like these wings with their great tasting sauce and fresh moist wings. \\n\\n2nd visit - I tried the same wings again without the breading. They still weren't crisp, but they were good. Again, great taste and proper heat level.   This time I tried the cheese sticks as an appetizer. They were ok, just not real hot.   I sat closer to the bar this time, had a cold draft beer and had very good service.\\n\\nI still want to come back and try pizza and burgers.  I do think this place will thrive and be a hit.

Very fast!\\n\\nAs some others have mentioned, the XLB themselves are very thin skinned.  I found that the trick to lifting one to your mouth without puncturing the skin is to grab them gently with the chopsticks and slightly rock them back and forth until they \\"let go\\" of the steamer basket.  I only ruptured one, but once I got it down, it was not a problem.  These dumplings are amazing in the flavor department!  I absolutely loved them.  They very much reminded me of the dumplings I've had in Taiwan, and I'm definitely coming back for more.\\n\\nThe pork and cabbage baozi were also very good.  The only gripe on these were that the dough was incredibly thick compared to the soup dumplings... if only they could find a middle ground between the 2 items' dough thickness... if they did that, both of these dishes would have been absolutely perfect.  The filling for the baozi was very tasty, however, so it was still a big win.\\n\\nAll in all, XLB is a great little dumpling spot on Williams.  I will definitely be returning.  :)  One thing I wish I had realized... for the last few bites I made a little mix of chili oil and soy sauce, and it brought the food to the NEXT LEVEL.

After being seated, we had to wait for 10 minutes to get menus, cold stale cornbread, and water. Then we waited 15 minutes before we even got our orders taken. Another 10 minutes before we got the drinks that we ordered, and they didn't split the beer we requested into two cups. \\n\\nOysters arrived next, half a dozen of Long Point and half a dozen of Brewster. Holy cow, for an oyster bar, their shucking job absolutely horrendous. So much shell everywhere. These were actually the worst shucked oysters I have ever had in New England. Come on guys, live up to your reputation a little. Our server couldn't even tell us anything out our /oysters/. \\n\\nClam chowder was lukewarm, not even hot. Creamy and smooth, good amount of meat, but I wonder how much butter's in it. Thai mussels arrived room temperature, by the time we started digging in a few minutes later, it was cold. The broth was quite delicious though.\\n\\nWe also got the seafood Newburg which.. Had a ton of rice probably way more rice than anything on the place. The creamy sherry sauce was.. Interesting, and definitely did not look appetizing at all. Puff pastry was nice though, but there wasn't enough seafood on it. At least it was warm! LOL\\n\\nLast item we tried was a lazy man's lobster basically, a lobster casserole. The breading was a little tough, but there was a good amount of lobster meat in it. Flavors were OK. Mashed potatoes were over peppered and lukewarm. I think it didn't have enough salt, but I can't really tell over all the pepper. How do you even mess up mashed potatoes?! \\n\\nDessert was a chocolate lava cake with ice cream. Uh.. It's not bad. Nothing to scream home about, but definitely the best thing we had all night. Moist, lukewarm (seriously what's with this place and temperatures?), and very chocolatey. Lava was missing, though, it was cooked right through - instead.. There was.. Chocolate syrup on it? \\n\\nHad a Boston Tea Party drink (iced tea, vodka, lemon) - tastes exactly like what you think it might taste like. Ew. I expected something more elevated.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this place has survived by being a tourist trap. The warning I should've spotted was fixed-price half dozen oysters at an oyster bar, with no names.\\n\\nHard avoid. \\n\\nWould: chocolate lava cake, puff pastry in the Newburg\\nMeh: Lobster casserole\\nWould not: everything else, including service."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Words I used during this meal: \\"wow this is so amazing, I think I may need to drink the sauce after I finish with this meal.\\"  This is one of those times I'm so grateful for yelp as I probably never would have found this place otherwise.

In addition, it has big windows with a view of a park across the street and outdoor seating available  in warmer weather.   The staff was amazingly friendly & attentive.  They even arranged for an uber ride to take us back to our hotel for free- which was an unexpected bonus to the great meal.  I ordered the seafood Siam- and we both agreed every bite was the best we had ever had (scallops, shrimp, veggies- all cooked to perfection).  We ordered the coconut shrimp but my meal was much more filling than expected and definitely could have gone without an appetizer.

The hostess was extremely rude from the moment we walked in. She was quite unhappy to see us and just kind of stared at me...so I asked if we could have a table, preferably near the window. She said \\"no.\\" Sooo I said \\"ok, well we were hoping to get a few cocktails and enjoy the view for a bit.\\" She said \\"Well we have a $24 minimum at tables so you can't have a table.\\" ...\\"ok, can we sit at the bar?\\" ... \\"YEA. There are three seats at the end. You can't walk around and look at the view though.\\" \\n\\nAre you kidding? The place is EMPTY besides two guys at the bar. She did not help us get more seats for the rest of the party, and she watched us struggle with our coats (barstools make it difficult) and did not offer to help. I could not believe how rude and unprofessional she was. She spent a lot of the time after that just talking to a waitress.\\n\\nBartender. SO unfriendly. Not helpful when I asked for a suggestion. Not happy when we asked what beers were on tap. Beers were served in water glasses....weird. I ordered a custom cocktail, which was very good (only redeeming factor of the evening). \\n\\nThe other guys at the bar left, so it is just the 6 of us. They had been showing UFC (ultimate fighting) the whole time on TV at the bar, and we (including the guys with us) were tired of all the blood and guys beating each other up. I asked the bartender if he would mind please changing the channel. He said \\"what do you want to watch?\\" I told him I didn't care, just something less bloody. He laughed at me. Went over and talked to the bar back and they had a good laugh together, looking at me and snickering. They debated for awhile over the channel and left it on the women's golf channel. Bartender came over and said \\"there is that better--sorry I couldn't find the church channel for you.\\" Are you kidding me? Why do you have to be so rude? Don't you want a tip?! If you work with people all day, might as well try to enjoy it and let them enjoy being there, sheesh! I told him I didn't ask for that, but that we all wanted something less bloody. He said, I guess assuming we were all tourists when we were not, \\"Well this is Boston, everything is like that. I gave you one that isn't.\\" Funny, I somehow find other things to watch while LIVING here. \\n\\nOverall:\\n-Worst service experience I have had in the entire Boston metro area. Ever.\\n-$24 limit makes the place feel cheap and tawdry. If you are going to pretend to be a fancy place, let the service, food, and drinks show that for you. Come on. I would have had 2-3 cocktails had we been seated at a table and treated well (totally 26-39 dollars! That is worth it at 11pm when otherwise you're just paying staff and staying open for little to no reason!) \\n-Again, if you're going to pretend to be a fancy place, service should be of utmost importance. Apparently it is not, as I have heard reviews from lots of friends on this and am reading lots of similar reviews here. Get with it, Top of the Hub.

It was on my husband's list and he kept trying to figure out a way to get us there.  Unfortunately, Voodoo Doughnut is a hot spot and on the busy 4th of July holiday week, the lines were out of this world.  There was no way we could wait in line more than 30 minutes with a 7 and 8 year old if we wanted to stay sane, especially in the summer heat.  Luckily, one of the times we came by the line was relatively short.  We waited about 10 minutes.  It was actually fun to be in line, because I was able to see up-close the awesome glitter/brick exterior.  There is also a treat as you get close: the scent of freshly-made doughnuts wafts through a pink grate, and you can see racks of them cooling off.  You know you are close when you can see the pictorial doughnut menu just outside the door.  It's helpful because once you are inside on a busy day, it's not easy to see all of the different types of doughnuts.  \\n\\nOnce you get to the door, you will see a sign that says to wait to enter until there is space inside so that you do not block the door.  Please follow these directions!  My children and I were landlocked when trying to leave and had to comically hop and squeeze through.\\n\\nYou've read enough reviews about this place to know that it is eclectic and cool inside.  Lots to look at, just check out everyone's pictures on Yelp. Although there was a rushed feel to the line process, the person behind the counter did not rush us at all once we got there.  My husband had many questions and she answered them all.  He got a few doughnuts to try, including one that can't be named in polite company.  My son went with his fave, a maple bar, my daughter got the \\"Homer\\" (pink with sprinkles), and I went for my personal favorite, a plain glazed.\\n\\nBased on the glazed doughnut, I can say that they are quite tasty.

My husband was recovering from a recent knee surgery, and since he was still walking gingerly, a long walk was not in our plans.  Imagine our frustration that while there were places still available in the parking lot they were all for \\"car to go.\\"  Great for promoting use of car sharing; however \\"car to go\\" doesn't service our area, neither does any other public transportation, so that just wasn't an option for us. There also wasn't any sort of valet option, so I left my husband off in the parking lot and then went for a hunt for a parking spot.  When I eventually walked into the restaurant, I was fuming about Lenoir's lack of initiative to make it practical for people who don't live downtown to dine with them.  However once I joined my husband at the cozy bar, the evening went much much much better.\\n\\nLenoir is a teeny tiny little box of a restaurant, best for singles, couples, and possibly a group of 3 or 4.

We ordered three things- xiao long bao, the shrimp wontons in chili oil, and cold sesame noodle salad with chicken. I've had a lot of xiao long bao and haven't eaten one that I disliked as much as these. They were extremely doughy and had an odd taste. The filling was fine, the soup was decent. Overall disappointing. I'm used to quality soup dumplings from places such as Din Tai Fung and Dough Zone in Seattle. I was hoping to find a place in Portland for when I'm visiting my family and have a XLB craving- sadly, this is not the spot.

I need to do more digging though.\\n\\nThe sesame noodle salad was okay, the noodles were wide which I'm fine with, but had the worst texture. It felt like I was eating a noodle mixed with a bit of plastic. They were super slippery and off putting. There was a weird taste of almond extract in there, and just a lot of strange bitter flavors. There was barely any chicken in it, which was the only actually decent part. The shrimp wontons were served in chili oil. Like... a lot. Too much. And it's not so much the oil part as much as the chili particles and the unfortunate texture. It was overwhelming the entire dish. Very one dimensional flavor and pretty disappointing. It also was not cheap. We spent about $40 for the two of us including fountain drinks. As we were eating I said, \\"I wouldn't come back here.\\" My mom agreed. Neither of us are picky eaters, we usually find a positive dish in the bunch. The LEAST bad was the XLB, but they were not... good, as I mentioned before. \\n\\nThe service was strange.

I would give 2.5 stars if I could.  The host staff was fast and friendly, as was our waiter.  It's just a shame that the food wasn't as appealing.  I do admit that I base a large part of my review of Mexican restaurants on their salsa.  And unfortunately, Don Dario's salsa was not good, in my opinion.  I know everyone has their own favorite kind and type, but this tasted more like tomato sauce than salsa.  It did have a little of a kick, but it was soupy.  And the tortilla chips were from a bag, not freshly baked or fried.  \\n\\nThe menu was ample and there was a lot to choose from.  I selected the barbacoa plate, which came with rice, beans and a side of lettuce and pico.  The barbacoa that I've had at other restaurants has been thick chunks of pork, in a juicy marinade.  However, the barbacoa plate here came out and looked like a dark brown hash.  My husband got the fajita chicken plate, and found his chicken to be over cooked and rubbery.\\n\\nThough it was touted as one of the best, most authentic restaurants in the area, and had a busy crowd to prove it, it isn't a place I care to try again.  Maybe it's my Americanized tongue that prefers a salsa fresca with fresh fried tortilla chips that keeps me doubting.  With all the possible Mexican restaurants and food trucks to try in Austin, this doesn't make the top 20.

That's the interesting thing about yelp and about tastes... even people you trust may have a wildly different opinion than your own. So here goes my two cents:\\n\\nI am no expert on ramen. Like many born & bred Americans, my total experience with ramen up until a few years ago were the instant packets in the grocery store (which I still love btw). I had no other reference when I tried real ramen for the first time, and I actually didn't like it. Since then I've had ramen at several restaurants and have learned that it can vary greatly by the country or the region that prepares it. \\n\\n\\n[ RAMEN AROUND ATLANTA ] \\n\\nMy least favorite ramen in the Atlanta area is Mizumi Ramen in Duluth, which borders on disgusting in my opinion. Umaido in Suwanee is my next least favorite ramen, although I will give them credit for being the first place I actually liked. Since then I have discovered better and will likely never return. The Bone Marrow Oxtail Soup @ Food Terminal in Chamblee is one of my favorites and my top favorite place for ramen is Paopao Ramen Factory in Buford, which I discovered attending a Yelp Event. On some days the Spicy Garlic Tonkasu is my favorite and on others it's the Angry Pao Pao. \\n\\nI also recently had the tasty Chicken Paitan ramen (where I substituted pork belly) in Tampa @ Ichicoro Imoto, which would fall just under Food Terminal in terms of my top 5 favorites.\\n\\n\\n[ THE FOOD & EXPERIENCE ]\\n\\nJINYA's Cha Cha Cha Ramen is a garlic lovers dream and was placed on my radar after reading a 2016 article by ZAGAT. The title of the article was 5 Must-Try Dishes @ Jinya, with only two of them being ramen. I was informed by the hostess that the Cha Cha Cha ramen is sadly no longer on the new menu, BUT, it's now kind of a secret menu item that must be requested... so I did! \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is pretty small, but solo eaters can find a spot at the bar on busier days! My ramen came out fairly quickly. I was honestly a little scared it might be too garlicy based on a conversation with the hostess whom prefers the JINYA Tonkotsu Black with slightly less meat and garlic. I'm happy I stuck with the Cha Cha Cha! It was deeply rich and flavorful. So rich in fact I was tempted to ask what the calorie count was on this dish... but decided it was better if I didn't know (trying to lose weight). I decided instead to just eat enough to satisfy my craving and took the rest home, where I divided it into two bowls to eat later.\\n\\n\\n[ FINAL THOUGHTS ]\\n\\nThe Cha Cha Cha ramen is now my second favorite ramen in the Metro Atlanta area. I hope it remains available even if on a secret menu. Thank you JINYA Ramen Bar for giving me one more reason to always be open to trying new places. I almost gave up on ramen after my first two experiences elsewhere, but so glad to finally have a regular rotation of places to satisfy my new found cravings when they hit! I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and your pleasant staff.\\n\\nNext visit I hope to try some of the other items mentioned in that Zagat article, which included: The pork gyoza, Brussels sprouts tempura, the \\"spicy-creamy\\" shrimp tempura and the spicy chicken broth ramen.\\n\\nSIDE NOTE TO SELF: Ask for thinner noodles next time. Would prefer something less thick than the noodles served with the cha cha cha. \\n\\n\\n2018/106"},{"name":"The Ocoee Taco Company","address":"40 Taylor St","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4.5","text":"I came to this place for the first time because my best friend told me it was the best tacos in town.

Known for their raw oyster bar, we decided to order a few to get the night started. \\n\\nWe ordered our drinks from the long list of wines, beers and spirits and I must admit I had one of the best brown liberation cocktails ever. My original cocktail was no longer available, and the server quickly suggested the \\"Wildwood\\" $13 - Bonded Rye, sweet cinnamon and blended bitters, touched with absinthe and an orange peel. A beautiful, complex marriage between all the ingredients. Truly one of the best cocktails I'll be reminiscing and craving for in the future. This deserves 5 stars - hands down. \\n\\nAs for appetizers, we ordered half a dozen Littlenecks ($2 each) from Smith Island, VA. It didn't \\"wow\\" me and didn't care too much for the oyster juice residue. In my opinion, it's probably best to order oysters closer to Massachusetts instead of Virginia to ensure the freshest supply.  \\n\\nThey served complimentary sliced bread with butter mixed with cayenne spice and honey. The spread was delicious along with the bread itself and the servers kept a close eye on refilling the bread basket.\\n\\nFor my dinner entr√©e, I was debating between the Lobster Roll and the Lobster Roe Noodles $34 (grilled lobster, braised short rib, oyster mushroom and Pecorino). The noodles won, and it was a good choice because it was more like a surf and turf with thick noodles in the middle. I enjoyed the dish with the chunks of lobster meat and tender braised beef but noticed the portion size was rather small for the price. I easily ate the whole dish and loved the sweet lobster meat. \\n\\nWe ended the evening with two desserts because we were so indecisive: Cortland Apple Crostata $9 (almond cream, spiced maple syrup) and Banoffee Pie $9 (dulce de leche, banana). Each of these desserts had their own personality and I'm glad we ordered both. The Crostata was beautifully packaged in an encrusted tart with the almond cream floating on top. The apples were perfectly sweet during the autumn harvest. The Banoffee was new to my dessert repertoire. I love the banana and toffee together and the crust was especially firm to balance the inside filling. \\n\\nThe service was never rushed however we could have ordered earlier as our server noticed we were in deep conversation. The modern d√©cor was tasteful without the pretentious attitude and the raw bar was the highlight of the room. The autumn theme was neatly presented and had a quaint New England feel throughout the restaurant. \\n\\nAs soon as were seated, the lights were dimmed to bring out the evening ambiance.

[I feel her pain, I actually prefer salad after the entree.] The same waitress probably came about 3 times to ask if she could take the plate. Another two waitresses and two bus boys also asked the same, to the point where it was extremely annoying.\\n\\n2) My colleague wanted to drink coke. She told this to the bus boy (yes I realize this is her mistake, but this task is something a bus boy can handle), and he brought her club soda. We were all very confused when a clear, carbonated drink arrived. How does \\"coke\\" sound like \\"club soda,\\" and how does it even look alike? The third time was the charm, and finally my colleague received the right beverage. For the service, I give two stars.\\n\\nI should note I was here for a private event, and my meal was paid for by my employer. Therefore, the meal was free. However, in the back of my mind, I am still conscientious about pricing.

However, over a round of drinks in the hotel bar before bedtime, my colleagues informed me that I had missed a critical item on my Portland to-do list: a visit to the famous Voodoo Doughnut shop.  Being from New Orleans, I obviously have an affinity for voodoo dolls, and I'm actually familiar with this doughnut shop, both from the Food Network and from some Google searches for voodoo doll-themed desserts.  I had completely forgotten, however, that it was located in Portland - and only three minutes or so from my hotel!  So, I stopped by the front desk before heading upstairs and changed my cab from 6:30am to 6:15am so I could pop by and grab a doughnut before my flight.\\n\\nIn the morning, the very nice cab driver agreed to make a pit-stop at Voodoo Doughnut.  I had looked at its menu the night before and decided what I wanted - however, when I learned that their \\"cream\\" filling is actually Bavarian creme and not the whipped, sugary \\"Kreme\\" one finds inside a Krispy Kreme doughnut, I changed my order a bit.  However, I still ended up with a whopping five doughnuts (this behavior will not bode well for me in a few years).  For $10.80 (cash only, but thankfully they have an ATM), I walked away with a lovely pink box full of the following doughnuts:\\n\\n(1) Dubble Bubble - This was my \\"fun,\\" \\"funky\\" purchase, but it ended up being my second favorite doughnut.  It's a soft, fluffy yeast doughnut topped with vanilla icing and bubble gum dust, making it a lovely pink shade.  The dust on top gives it a strange but only slight - and actually quite enjoyable - chewiness.  It even comes with a piece of bubble gum!  Very cute and very creative - and very tasty in that nice, old-fashioned bubble gum way (it does not have the artificial bubble gum taste of children's toothpaste).\\n\\n(2) Old Dirty Bastard - This doughnut was extremely delicious, but very heavy.  It is another delightful yeast doughnut topped with chocolate icing, Oreo cookies, and peanut butter drizzle - and it's truly a dessert.  It should be banned before noon.  Except it's too good to pass up!\\n\\n(3) Memphis Mafia - I've read rave reviews on this one, but I really disliked it.  The cake doughnut was too heavy and the glaze too saccharin to be combined with cinnamon sugar, chocolate sauce (not chocolate icing; it was much harder and had an odd flavor), chocolate chips, bananas, and peanut butter.  I only took two bites.\\n\\n(4) Captain my Captain - I love Captain Crunch cereal, but having crunchy carbs on top of soft yeast doughnut carbs was a little much.  Too many carbs, too many different textures, and too much sweetness from the vanilla icing overpowering the salty-sweet flavor of the cereal.\\n\\n(5) Voodoo Doll - Saving the best for last!  I love the concept, design, and flavors.  Their chocolate icing is great and less sweet than the vanilla.  However, I didn't get an authentic experience, as my doughnut somehow wound up with cream in the center instead of jelly.  Kind of a bummer, but I will say, the cream was far better than I could have hoped.\\n\\nOverall, this was a great experience - high quality, fresh doughnuts with inventive toppings and amusing names, all at reasonable prices.

I can't lie... these donuts are definitely esthetically pleasing! If they were in a best looking donuts contest, they would probably win hands down. But, you have to have the taste to really back it up, and these donuts just didn't have that.\\n \\nI ended up getting three donuts: the Captain my captain, Butterfingering, and their seasonal gingerbread donut. The Captain my captain is topped with icing that has Captain Crunch cereal on top. The donut tasted okay, but the cereal tasted very stale. The Butterfingering was probably my least favorite because it was extremely dry. The Butterfinger topping and outside coating was moist, but the inside of the donut was still dry. My favorite one was their seasonal gingerbread donut! The frosting had a wonderful gingerbread taste but the donut still tasted pretty stale.\\n \\nI can understand donuts being a bit stale if I was getting them late at night. But if it's 10 am in the morning, there is absolutely no reason why they should taste like they've been sitting out all day! This coupled with the bad attitude of the employee who was pushing the bucket made me feel like I had chosen the wrong donut shop to go to. Maybe it's harder to make fresh and fluffy donuts with all of those crazy ingredients on top of them, but I'd rather have a fresh plain donut than a fancy stale one. Overhyped? Hell yes!

After what seemed like an inexplicably long time, I got my order, which was tasty enough I suppose, though having to pay $7 for a few flimsy slices of mostly raw sweet potato smeared with some kind of vegan spread seemed like hardly-any-food insult added to inexplicably-long-wait injury. \\n\\nIf restaurants like this made even the slightest move to acknowledge the fact that a massive number of Americans are somewhere on the spectrum of developing full-blown diabetes--it is, after all, easy to slather things on leaves of lettuce or low-carb tortillas--I would take their claims of serving \\"healthy\\" food much more seriously."},{"name":"Ganko Ittetsu Ramen","address":"318 Harvard St, Unit 3","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Today was cold and rainy and I remembered that I had been wanting to try ganko ittetsu for a while. What better weather than that for ramen to really hit the spot?\\n\\nIt is a bit hard to find, no signage from the street and it is inside a small strip mall. \\n\\nFirst things first, yes there is a long wait. Even during off hours we waited a bit over the estimated 45 minutes. Luckily yelp lets you hold a place in line when you are close enough. There was a cranky old couple and their grandson (?) that complained like 20 times about the wait. I can't stand that, you know how long the wait is going to be based on google, yelp, the hostess' estimates, and the fact that the waiting area is packed, so quit whining about how long you've been there - newsflash, we've all been here long. Lol. The system is pretty efficient though, they take your order before you are seated so turnover is quick.\\n\\nThe interior is very small but extremely well ventilated and laid out so it doesn't actually feel packed or claustrophobic. \\n\\nThere's a good selection of beers to have with your ramen, most of them IPAs. When we were seated the food got to the table pretty quickly. I ordered the shio ramen. The noodles were the perfect texture. The broth was packed with richness and flavor but not so heavy as to make me feel sick or give me that greasy mouth-feel that i sometimes get after ramen. My boyfriend tried my broth and he thought the chicken flavor was too strong, but i personally liked it a lot. It came with a lot of toppings too, and the aji-tama came out perfectly soft and tasty. On the downside there were only two slices of pork if you don't order extra and they are pretty thin. They were tender and delicious but i wish i had ordered more. This is probably my only real complaint is that there should be a bit bigger portion of pork. Other than that though, the bowls were massive and both of us left completely stuffed. \\n\\n\\nHow does it compare to other ramen in the area, and Is it worth the wait? I'd say yes, considering people wait twice as long for a place like Yume Wo Katare which in my opinion is highly overrated and subpar food, not to mention an obnoxious dining experience. The wait times here are maybe slightly longer than Santouka, but even though Santouka is a chain I think I'd prefer to go there more regularly seeing as their pork portions are larger and they offer cheek meat as an option. However if you are not starving and/or pressed for time, Ganko is a wonderful place for ramen that i would put up there with Pikaichi. We're very glad to now have a new ramen place to add to our rotation and have already told our friends to come try this place."},{"name":"Boi Brazil Churrascaria","address":"5600 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Awesome Brazilian steakhouse buffet at a fraction of the price of other competitors out there.

A never again experience. 2 stars."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Voodoo Doughnuts is an insulting joke.\\n\\nParked across the street is a building with the self-indulgent cliche, \\"Keep Portland Weird\\". And that, apparently, is what Voodoo thinks it is doing. At least, that is what its patrons seem to be celebrating.\\n\\nBut don't fall for it.\\n\\nVoodoo Doughnuts isn't weird. It's just a sub-par, hyper-commercialized, offensively expensive donut place full of empty promises of creativity and memorable experience.\\n\\nThe donuts are nothing to speak of. They are decidedly \\"not bad\\". But you won't be paying \\"not bad\\" prices -- no, you'll be paying the Portland-promotion-premium. That apple fritter you want? That plain cruller you're eyeing? Yeah, check the price on that before you buy.\\n\\n\\"BUT\\", you say, \\"you're paying for the experience!\\" Let's talk about the experience. You wait in a long line (probably an hour wait on average, and certainly longer at peak times). The line is poorly managed and ends up making traffic in and out of the store congested and bothersome. As you wait, you'll no doubt be surrounded by tourists and \\"OMG I LOVE PORTLAND IT'S SOOOO WEIRD!!!\\" natives talking about the very donut store they are now patronizing.\\n\\nOnce inside, you'll be bombarded by merchandise -- including slutty underwear -- brandishing the Voodoo Doughnuts logo. Overpriced merchandise. Everywhere. As you slowly work your way through the packed-in crowd, you'll find a disturbing lack of explanation of the various donut varieties. What exactly is a \\"Maple Blazer Blunt\\", you might ask. And as you notice the price, you'll wonder what magic they've worked beneath the surface to make it such an extraordinary specimen. If you take the dive, you'll discover that you spent way too much money on what is essentially just a donut with maple frosting and red sprinkles.\\n\\nSo the lack of donut descriptions isn't really a problem. They're just normal donuts with perhaps a strange topping and an unusual name.\\n\\nAnd therein lies the kicker. This whole \\"experience\\" that people speak of? It's entirely empty. Like standing at the corner of Hollywood and Vine, it's only an \\"experience\\" in that you can say that you've done it. But it's not particularly unique or enjoyable, and you certainly wouldn't care for it at all had the very successful marketing campaign not convinced you to somehow brave Portland drivers in the rain in order to spend way too much money on decidedly \\"not bad\\" donuts. The creativity of the donuts is...well, you tell me: Is it \\"creative\\" to put Fruit Loops on top of a donut? If you think so, then heck, I guess you'll love this place.\\n\\nYou want real creativity? How about a \\"Cock-N-Balls\\". It's chocolate-covered, cream-filled donut. In the vague shape of a crudely-drawn penis. If that's the amazing experience and creative one-of-a-kind weirdness that you want to have as part of your Portland experience, then go for it.\\n\\nBut let's not pretend that it's anything other than a normal donut with a slightly different shape and a name that is nothing more than a cheap marketing gimmick.\\n\\nAnd let's not pretend that you're really helping the local community when you buy from Voodoo. Voodoo is ripping off natives and tourists alike, offering nothing special in exchange. You're not supporting Portland; you're supporting Voodoo. But I guess that's what Portland is -- a whole bunch of people wanting really badly to believe that they're creative and weird, but they're really just an audience easily marketed towards (see Obama's record-breaking crowd in the same city).\\n\\nOn the plus side, the donuts are by no means bad. And the variety, while mostly stupid and just a repackaging of your typical variety, does have some gems. The peach fritter, for instance, is a rare find. The Mexican hot chocolate donut is another enjoyable varietal that you're unlikely to encounter elsewhere. Still, the prices are exorbitant and you can just as easily have an apple fritter as a peach fritter. Likewise, a chocolate donut won't suddenly pale in comparison the Mexican hot chocolate donut.\\n\\nBottom line: Voodoo donuts are pretty good donuts. But they're not amazing, they're not creative, they're not worth the price, they're not worth the wait, and you're better off going to any other \\"pretty good\\" donut place."},{"name":"Cafe Matisse","address":"9700 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"This is one of Orlando's best kept secrets.

Mostly to scope out the parking situation, and also to see if there are any must-try dishes. I have to say I was shocked at seeing a 2.5 star average for Communion. Kevin Gillespie's other ventures have been very well-received so why is the rating so low here? \\n\\nAs you can see from the reviews, the complaint is pretty universal: The prices suck.\\n\\nDo you ever go somewhere kinda pricey and wonder, at what point would people just refuse to pay what the place is charging? I definitely wondered that here. \\n\\nFor beer, there are three options:\\n\\n1 token ($5) will get you the smallest glass, which looks like it's maybe 10 oz. \\n2 tokens ($10) will get you a half liter glass, which is 16.9 oz. (a regular pint glass is 16 oz.)\\n3 tokens ($15) will get you a one liter glass, which is 33.8 oz (so about two regular pints)\\n\\nThere are a couple of German beers on tap and when I was there, a craft beer from a NC brewery, and a local craft (Wild Heaven White Blackbird) as well. There is also a small selection of cans/bottles. Token prices vary but I do know the Founders All Day IPA was 1 token. \\n\\nThe half liter is an absolute ripoff. They let you know that the tokens include tax and tip but the typical bar bill for one pint with tax and tip doesn't come anywhere near $10. The full liter is better. You're coming in at about the equivalent of $7.50 per pint. With tax and tip, this is much more reasonable. \\n\\nI've seen the comparisons to Der Biergarten downtown and they have their beer prices and selections right on the online menu, if you want to compare yourself. If you can't be bothered to open a new tab, their half liters are $6 (with a couple coming in at $7) and the full liters are $11-12 (again, with a couple priced at $14). Quite the price difference, especially at the half liter level.\\n\\nSo my SO and I purchased $50 worth of tokens and this is what it got us:\\n\\n2 full liter beers (roughly four regular pints)\\n1 bratwurst plate with a side of beef fat fries (two sausages and a decent portion of fries)\\n1 Founders All Day IPA can\\n\\nMoving on to the food, still pricey but I'm much more willing to pay more for food. I just tell myself that the ingredients are high quality, locally sourced, prepared by professionals. And the food was pretty good. My friends ordered the currywurst plate, which was the clearly the standout dish. The sauce with the beef fat fries was fantastic. The pretzel was kind of whatever. \\n\\nSo overall, I'd come back here. I would definitely not suggest it myself, as there are way too many Decatur spots with good, properly-priced beer and outdoor space. Not to mention the two Decatur breweries (three if you count WH in neighboring Avondale Estates) that also have lawn games like cornhole. But if a friend had their heart set on it, I wouldn't say no.

We were easily able to stop by Caffe Paradiso on the way home for some amazing gelato after dinner. The fourth and most important reason is the food! As soon as we were seated we were served fresh, warm, and complementary bread with some delicious olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Our friendly waiter even served us seconds upon request, the bread was that good! I ordered the Gnocchi al Forno, which had soft potato dumplings baked in a tomato sauce with some fresh mozzarella and basil. I could taste the freshness of the dish in the homemade mozzarella and the crisp basil. The servings were also generous, expect to have some leftovers. Lastly, the restaurant is on the small side, as most North End restaurants tend to be, but they accommodate groups well, just make sure to make a reservation!

And while this one doesn't serve beer yet, I usually grab a Modelo to go with my football-sized carnitas burrito.\\n\\nThe burritos here are huge. If they stuffed them any more full, they'd need to wrap them in another tortilla. And maybe they should, since most of the time my burrito explodes before I can finish it.\\n\\nThe problem is, at least for me, that they're too big. I don't need a burrito that big, and I'd rather it didn't fall apart on me half-way through eating it. I'd much rather pay $1 less and have a normal sized meal.\\n\\nOn top of that, like other people, I find that the ingredients inside are usually not well mixed. The guacamole that I just paid extra for is always on one end and not applied throughout.\\n\\nHonestly, I still love Chipotle, but it's not the best place to go in Harvard Square.

The restaurant was rearranged to fit our needs, and the set up with the food flowed perfectly. Alexandrea coordinated everything for me to make sure the night went exactly how I wanted. We had a huge assortment of appetizers, set out buffet style so the guests could enjoy a cocktail hour, with some quick bites. This was followed by a seated, plated dinner and dessert. The guests were all blown away by the quality and variety of food options. Radek also provided a source of entertainment, allowing me to \\"saber\\" a bottle of champagne in front of our guests. Once again, the wait staff was professional and exceeded our expectations in every way, making the ambience perfect for our night.

If you ask, nice you might half and half.   This is all complemented by a huge amount of really fresh herbs: Shiso, mint, cilantro, and sawtooth herb.  You wrap any combo of things you like in the lettuce leaves, dip into the sauce, and enjoy.   A very fresh and light meal that never disappoints.

It gave off a really homy feel which I liked.  We sat at a quasi communal table with a little divider between us and the next two top.  We got a happy hour menu to peruse.  Very impressive selection indeed.  We ordered up the Truffled Deviled Eggs and the Triple Fried Duck Fat Fries.\\n\\nOh my.  I love Deviled Eggs and these were quite yummy.  Not for Easter Sunday brunch any more.  The Fries were crisp and flavorful and both were at HH prices.  As were the drinks which I quaffed down.  The appetizers were followed by the Lamb Barbacoa, Blackened Redfish and Brussels Sprouts Leaves.\\n\\nSuzie enjoyed the Lamb and I stole a few bites and it was very flavorful, however I prefer a more traditional lamb preparation with a mint sauce.  But that  is just me.  My Blackened Redfish was a hit.  It has been a long time since I had Blackened fish and it through me back to the late 80's when this seem to be all the rage.  It is not the easiest of things to do since you need to burn/sear the outside of the fish and keep the interior moist and flavorful.  They executed this easily.  The only let down was the sprout leaves.  They seemed to me to be over cooked and really didn't do much for me.  A nice full roasted sprout would of been a better choice.\\n\\nOur server, whose name I cannot recall, was on point.  He was pleasant, informative and efficient.  He didn't hang around and try to be friends with us, but rather was available when we needed him and not around when we were enjoying our new dining neighbors.  Which brings up the divider.  We had some casual conversation with our dining neighbors and after we finished our appetizers, I asked if we could remove the divider so it felt more of a dining experience.  Our waiter, being on the spot again, swooped in took the divider away which really opened up the table.  I like that divider idea, it works.\\n\\nDefinitely will be back when we are around the Manor Road area, which seems to be more often these days."},{"name":"Vino Volo","address":"Austin Airport","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"So we've been to many airport bars/wine bars and Vino Volo in the Austin TX airport stands out.

We assumed they were meeting soon and so my boyfriend requested a table for 4.  They sat him immediately, even though he arrived alone.  So when I arrived to the table he already had a drink, the waiter was there as soon as I sat down asking me what I wanted, I hadn't even look at the menu and as soon as he brought the drink he asked where the other people were and what we wanted for dinner, we said they were running late, but we would come soon and we would order.  He said, \\"Good, because while you just sit here, I am losing money!\\"...As if that wasn't rude enough, the waiter kept harassing us for our order, asking where the rest of the party was, so we finally decided to order without them arriving.  I understand them being upset that our friends were late, but it was not our fault and by now I order an entr√©e (the most expensive on the menu) my boyfriend had 2 appetizers, plus the 2 drinks we were already drinking, still they didn't think it was enough, I guess, so the waiter went and complained to the manager.  \\nThe manager came over to the table to ask where the rest of our party was and that if they did not come soon he would need our table, because they were very busy.  We reassured him again that the 2 other people would come, they were on their way...Our food arrives and as we are taking the first bites, but that didn't stopped the manager from coming over yet again and this time he just starts taking the other 2 menus from the extra plate settings and says: \\"I'm sorry but I am gonna need this table, right now, I can't wait anymore!\\" - Mind you, by then we had our food in front of us and were eating. My boyfriend, started to tell him, how rude they had been all night and how upsetting this was since they never told him that the 4 of us had to be there and eating at all times.  The manager said \\"Fine!!!\\" and took off mad.  \\nThen our friends arrive, apologize for being late but unfortunately said they were having appetizers at their lecture and were not hungry, the waiter was furious.  Our friends still both ordered wines and we still ordered more drinks and coffee.  However the \\"rude fest\\" just continued from top to bottom!  \\nI went and talked to the manager at the end of the meal and asked him what was going on and why that whole scene had unfolded so badly.  He apologized begrudgingly and said \\"I guess I shouldn't have acted the way I did\\"...\\"GUESS??!!\\"  He said that it was a busy night and we were basically hogging the table and our 2 friends didn't have food as we had said initially.  I told him that we didn't lie to him, that we did think that the couple were meeting us there for food as they previously told us. I explained that they had food at their event that went later than expected.  I understand times are tough but to tell someone they need the table you are sitting in, while you have a $30 plate of food in front of you is just bad business!  Overall, that night we spent over $100 + tip (YES, tip for bad service!).

The duck fat fries are topped with a 110 minute egg that oozes over the fries and comes with a to die for dipping sauce - this is a must get every time I go. I'm a huge deviled egg fan and also love their truffled deviled eggs.The cheese board was good, but you can't really mess up a cheese board too bad unless you really try.

In the eight years I have lived in the Atlanta area, downtown Tucker has evolved from virtually nothing into a pretty cool place, with Local No. 7, a really good bakery called Sweet Dee's, and a serviceable Mexican restaurant, Las Colinas. Each of these warrants their own review and shall get one in due course.\\n\\nLocal No. 7 is fairly typical for a sports bar in looks and decor, but certainly has more of a laid back, distinct neighborhood feel to it that one wouldn't find at a Taco Mac or Buffalo Wild Wings. I have nothing against those restaurants, but I always prefer to support small business over large corporations and franchises. \\n\\nThe beer selection may disappoint the snob, but there is enough variety to satisfy the vast majority of customers. I can't speak with much authority on the food as I have only tried three items - the burgers, the fried pickles,  and the chicken tenders. The Buffalo (burger) was quite good, drenched in buffalo sauce and blue cheese crumbles, but not extraordinary. The fried pickles were good, but I personally prefer mine a bit thinner and crispier. The chicken tenders are outstanding with a nice, thick, crunchy batter  and generally served with honey mustard though I request Ranch and Buffalo sauce instead. These are some of the best chicken fingers I've ever had. The fries are also thin, crispy and certainly better than those served at the vast majority of restaurants. \\n\\nThe service is so-so, not appreciably better or worse than what one would expect at any other sports bar or pub. During our last visit our waitress sat down and to chat and do not one, but two shots with the table next to us. Given that I was enjoying a beer at the time, it didn't bother me too much, but it did slow down service and I can see how that would annoy someone who was there with their family, or just wanted to pick up dinner after work. In other words, know going in this sort of thing may happen, and enjoy your drink and the game on one of the several TVs. \\n\\nIn summation, this is a really cool little bar despite some of the annoyances mentioned.

The seafood pancake batter was crispy and not extremely doughy as we've had it at other places. Their tofu stew was spicy and came out extremely hot that is perfect match with white rice. Yummm!

I was especially worried about the speed of service as it seems like a lot of people complained about that.  My friend and I had a show to catch so we definitely needed an efficient server.  And we got one.  My friend arrived a few minutes before I did so got us our table (we had reservations) and told our server we had a show to catch.  He was very efficient and we had absolutely no problem getting to the show in time.  And we were also not rushed.  The chips and salsa that were provided upon seating were very good.  The chips were slightly salty (which I liked) and the salsa was delicious (though a bit runny).  We got the guacamole and were pleased with it.  I got the short rib enchiladas.  They were very good but the sauce was a little spicy for me.  My friend got the Mahi Mahi taco appetizer and liked it a lot, but the portion was very small (the server had warned her about this).  The meal surprisingly came with a bowl of rice and a bowl of black beans.  Overall I'd say the menu is a bit pricey for the portion sizes.

Food service takes a little while go come out and can be little confusing.

The brisket is undoubtedly the best I have had.  The turkey was very moist but not smoky or very flavorful.  Not a fan of the sausage at all.  The pulled pork was good, especially with the pickled onions they give you on top of it.  The potato salad was very good, and once I brought the leftover cole slaw home and added salt it was good, too (There was no salt or pepper anywhere.)

I have Red Robin and Chili's well ahead it.  Let me also preface this review by saying we only went to Applebees because we had a plan to go to South Bay to pick up some DVDs that just came out and go to Stop and Shop for some groceries to make dinner, but I had to work late so by the time we got to South Bay, both of us were starving and we decided to settle for Applebees.\\n\\nWe've been to this Applebees once before and it was a horrible experience.  Fool me once, shame on you...\\n\\nSo we sit at the bar area at some hightops and it takes us forever to make up our minds on what we want.  That's our own fault.  Finally I decided on the 9 oz steak with topped off baked potato, with instructions for the steak to be medium rare and the potato to not have sour cream.  Abby got some herb chicken thing.  And so we waited...and waited...and waited.  Finally the waiter comes by and tells us that our meal is coming out shortly.  This is a tactic I don't understand at all.  If our food is coming out shortly, then just bring it out, don't tell us in advanced.  I mean, is that suppose to make us feel better?  All I know is we waited another 10 minutes and no food.  Our waiter did come out to tell us that our dinner was being plated right now and should be out soon.  I really wished he didn't tell me that, because it took nearly another 10 minutes before our food was being brought out.  The gave me time to think that my steak was probably getting overcooked by sitting under the heatlamp.  Sure enough, our food comes out and there's sour cream on my potato.  (Oh yeah, the waiter didn't write down our order either, he was one of those \\"I'll remember it all\\" types.)  I mention this and the runner said she can take it back.  I'm so hungry, I really don't care.  That's when I decided to check my steak, and sure enough, tougher than a boot's sole and well overdone.  I tell her I ordered medium-rare and she said she'll have them refire a steak.  Fine, I can live with that.  \\n\\nAgain, we wait for what seems like forever.  A 9oz steak cooked at medium-rare should take 8 minutes top.  After 20 or so minutes, and two different people assuring me that my food was coming out soon, we decided we had enough and that we wanted to speak to the manager.  He comes out and says that the steak is almost ready, but I tell him we just want to pay for Abby's meal and to leave.  He tells me the steak will be free and we can take it to go, but I really don't want it.  I tell him no and that we just want our check and want to  leave.  He says to not worry about the bill but if I wanted to leave a tip for the waiter that would be great.  Normally I wouldn't leave squat, but I felt this time it wasn't the waiter's fault and leave him a couple of bucks.\\n\\nFool me twice, shame on me.  It was our own fault to go to Applebees.  We know their food suck and their service is just as bad.  However, it shouldn't take an hour to get a medium rare steak out to a customer, not once, but twice.  I give Applebees at South Bay a 0 out of 5.

A few pieces of chicken and a bunch of green leaves are not that expensive. \\n\\nOn top of that, the service was very disappointing, they ran out of menus (it wasn't busy when we arrived, the gentleman next to me lend me his), and had a rush attitude with clearing our plates.

I couldn't get a handle on the vibe or the desired demographic. I came for dinner on Saturday at 9pm and the cavernous place was about half-full. The clientele definitely skewed older than I expected, but hey, I'm not ageist.  The back bar area definitely seemed a little hipper. Still, the decor could use an update, in my opinion -- just because the place is named for an old movie doesn't mean the interior design has to be ancient-looking (and just to be clear, I don't mean it's designed to look like the 1940s...it literally just looks like they haven't updated anything for at least a decade).\\n\\nSo, I found Casablanca by searching \\"tapas\\" on Yelp and yes, they have a section of the menu called \\"tapas and appetizers.\\" It's really just appetizers. My friend and I decided to just get 4 \\"tapas\\"/apps and share. We got Sari's lamb, the mussels, a beet and burrata salad and a fried softshell crab that was a special. \\n\\nThe lamb and mussels were pretty good -- the mussels rather unnecessarily come with lobster salad, which is unceremoniously blopped on one of the pieces of grilled bread in the bowl.  The softshell was....really really fried. The batter was kind of flavorless. And the hearts-of-palm \\"salad\\" underneath it was dressed in mayo.  Thumbs down. The beet salad was ok....I liked the burrata as a twist on the standard goat cheese that often comes with beet salads.\\n\\nDessert was a decent pumpkin cheesecake, replacing the apple fritters which they had run out of.\\n\\nThe food experience was redeemed somewhat by the wine we were drinking and this is my highest praise for Casablanca -- they have an excellent wine list. The person buying wine for them knows their shit. Some really great domestic wineries represented -- Elk Cove, Bonny Doon, Shafer, Cooper Mountain. I was very pleasantly surprised by the wine list.\\n\\nThe service was pretty good, with a few missteps (forgetting to bring us new silverware, not clearing empty glasses from the table when new drinks came, not giving us share plates) but everyone was very friendly.\\n\\nOverall, I don't know if I'll come back....the place just seems pretty dated/tired, both in terms of the food quality/presentation and the decor."},{"name":"La Famiglia Giorgio's","address":"112 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Really love this place!!

First off this idea is excellent! It's like AirBnB'ing between restaurants. I love La Bucca, took my dad here on his birthday. So when I learned that Hunny Milk is spreading their brunch love here on the weekends, with out a doubt I knew I had to go ASAP. Honesty it's hard being a foodie and a health freak at the same time. (I met up with my friend here literally after a work out!) But when they offer you a croissant donut masterpiece plus graham waffle topped with fresh strawberries, you simply don't say NO to that! You say, heck yeah, please! Love the presentation, and love that they are all about quality over quantity. Portion size were perfect, I was able to indulge without feeling so overwhelmed. Oh that croissant was so crisp, I can here it crack the moment my knife touched it! The bacon, the maple, the egg, everything just meshed very well, think tastebuds overload! (In a good way, off course)! And that graham waffle, topped with freshly goodness strawberries was to die for! It was melt in your mouth goodness! Perfect hint of sweetness. If only my waist could afford it, I'll be here every weekend. Only tip I have is, like every brunch spots in Portland, get here early. It's the weekend.

Sure, we had read about it in our never-ending search for great fried chicken...but we finally got a chance to see what their chicken looked like on that show. After watching the show, we were salivating, and it didn't take long for us to make a trip down to Peachtree and sample their food.\\n\\nThe inside of the restaurant is about what you would expect: an homage to everything Gladys Knight and Ron Winan. There's the music, videos, and gold records adorning the walls.\\n\\nMy wife ordered the dark meat Fried Chicken, with a couple of sides. I ordered the Midnight Train (Chicken & Waffles). The one thing that I liked is the size of the chicken pieces. We recently ate at Mary Mac's, which serves fried chicken pieces that look like they were taken from a turkey, and came out over cooked and very dry. Here, the pieces were big, but not too big, so they came out juicy and delicious. The batter was also perfect -- golden brown and thick enough so as to know it's there, but doesn't dominate like at fast food places (where you're getting fried batter with a bit of chicken thrown in). The Chicken & Waffles is served with a ginormous waffle and four chicken wings. The waffle was excellent, crispy on the outside, with a great malt flavor throughout. It's better than many waffles I've had out at most places.\\n\\nI must admit that waffles with syrup and fried chicken is an odd combination, but one that works quite well. The yin and yang of salty and sweet that the meal provides is weird on paper, but great in reality. To me, the only complain was that, overall, there was too much food. In the future, I would probably just order two wings and a waffle (a la carte), to get the right amount of food. My wife's sides were also fine, but nothing to write home about (can't even remember what she got, save for Mac & Cheese, which was all right).\\n\\nOverall, quite impressed with the food, and we will (despite the location) be returning in the future."},{"name":"The Coop","address":"6214 N Interstate Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Brunch on a Sunday, no wait and quick service was nice.

The shady clientele are gone but the mirrors remain.\\n2.) If you look around those mirrors you may see a lot of Chinese patrons at the restaurant. Helen pointed this out to us as an indicator that she was serving authentic Chinese dishes.\\n3.) We didn't order authentic dishes, instead opting for orange chicken and General Tso's chicken. To be honest they just weren't that good. The meat was low quality and the sauce was okay but nothing special. \\n4.) However, Helen's husband treated the guests with some beautiful piano playing and opera singing. You don't get this in any other Chinese restaurant around town.\\n5.) We could have made the experience more enjoyable by taking advantage of the open bar. We didn't but another nice option to differentiate Helen's from other restaurants.\\n6.) Other people mentioned service problems but ours was totally adequate.

The brussels sprout leaves are almost like candy - they have a delicate crunch and an understated sweetness that is truly amazing. Every bite we were surprised at how good leaves can be. Charcuterie board is *choice* with great accompaniments and the chicken liver mousse is sublime. The butterscotch budino is delightful - even if you're not a huge fan of butterscotch. Almost has a creme brulee consistency to it. Portions are perfect for sharing so we split all our dishes.\\n\\nBig parking lot. Great wine and drink selection. Knowledgable staff. Pricing is very reasonable considering the quality of the food.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\nAmbiance is fine but it gets pretty loud. The place is large and depending on where you sit, you could be in a super echoy space or sitting in some oddly low chairs that make you feel like a child. I wouldn't call this a 'romantic' place, but cozy and elegant. The waitstaff was great the first time, fine the second time. A bit cold and left us alone - sometimes that's fine, other times you feel forgotten about.

I would highly recommend Newcomb Farms to anyone looking for a nice breakfast place."},{"name":"Contigo","address":"2027 Anchor Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I think this place might be \\"too cool\\" for me. It's got that sort of hipster vibe that isn't really my style, but might be right up someone else's alley. But I really wanted to like it since it's so close to our house, and there's a dearth of good restaurants around here!\\n\\nFirst off, word of warning, it's ALL outdoor seating. Which is fine when it's cool and breezy, but Texas summers can be unforgiving. There's a patio area with a roof, and they have a bunch of fans, so it might not be TOO bad in the dead of July, but just know what you're getting into. Obviously, the folks at Contigo can't help the fly/bug problem, either. Oh, and if you're a tasty morsel for mosquitoes, you might wanna spray yourself down before going. I left with a couple of huge bites. Again, not Contigo's fault: just sayin'.\\n\\nThe food's decent, and I'd probably bump the review up to 4 if it were JUST about the food. When my husband and I went, they were doing a special where you could get drumsticks for $1 apiece. They were quite tasty, although room temperature (which I thought was odd). Still, I ended up having 3 (1 was complimentary, I swear!) and I gobbled 'em all down, along with the pickles they came with.\\n\\nThe plate-portion's are a bit smaller than I'm used to. Maybe they're going for a more European style? And reading the menu can be confusing if you're not all posh & sophisticated and have no clue what \\"Charcuterie\\" means. Just ask the waiter if you're unsure about anything. Some of the dishes are served cold, which could be an unwelcome surprise if you're not expecting it.\\n\\nI got a shrimp special. It wasn't bad, but I liked the drumsticks more. My husband got the rabbit & dumplings. We joked that they should call it the \\"Middle Earth Special,\\" since it looked like something Samwise & Frodo would cook up. It also took FOREVER for them to bring out his plate. Maybe they had to go hunt & skin the rabbit first? But it was tasty and my husband left a \\"happy plate\\" (i.e. empty). He just wasn't thrilled about the wait.\\n\\nThey have a full bar and some interesting drinks. We just stuck to the house wines, though. It'd probably be a good place to go with some friends, for drinks & appetizers some evening. Perhaps the little hiccups we experienced might be ironed out after the place has been open longer. \\n\\nIt's also a bit on the pricey side, so be prepared. Overall, food was probably a 3.5-4, but service was about a 2. I settled on 3. Good luck to 'em, though: I'm still happy to see a new restaurant in the area and might be back to try 'em again and see if the 2nd go is better than the first."},{"name":"Pistilli's Bistro & Pizzeria","address":"304 South Washington Ave","city":"Titusville","stars":"4","text":"Best pizza around!

Holy Crap! This is the best BBQ that has ever touched my lips! La BBQ is parked at one of Austin's many permanent food truck park locations (GENIUS IDEA BTW) we waited in line for a while for this BBQ in the hot Austin sun. Although it was scorching out, we met some really cool people who were also waiting in line and partook with them in the free keg beer (tips suggested) and honor system of water and soft drinks to help keep us cool as we chilled and chit chatted along with each other. It reminded me of some sort of weird tailgating experience except we were waiting for a heavenly food event instead of a sporting event. Our time finally came to order. We decided on the brisket and pulled pork along with some buttermilk potato salad and Mexican Coca Cola. There was no knife necessary to eat the Brisket. It literally melted in my mouth like \\"BUTTA!\\" Yum OMG! I had thought coming from Florida that I had tasted some awesome BBQ but I have to admit that nothing touches this - not by a long shot! I have no idea what their secret is but it was well worth the wait. We left with happy tummies and happy hearts as we took home fond memories of great food and great company that we met and shared an outdoor table with while waiting in line. At first glance I seriously questioned why everyone in Austin digs this whole waiting in a line for food longer than waiting for a ride on Disney's Space Mountain concept. After this I totally get it! It's about taking the time to live in the now. Meeting different people from all over, different countries even, having fun, sharing stories, spending time face to face. No electronic devices, no emails, no deadlines, and in the end, the kick-ass reward of consuming an amazing feast together and bringing home fond memories.

However, we were undecided on an appetizer or salad, all of which looked terrific on the menu. On our waiter's recommendation, we both decided on a caprese salad.\\n\\nThe caprese salad was delicious, as both the tomatoes and mozzarella were fresh and tasty, but what really tied it together was the basil-infused oil that was drizzled over it.\\n\\nThe cioppino was also delicious, with shrimp, mussels, fish, scallops, and calamari in a tomato-fennel broth. It was served in traditional San Francisco style, with a few pieces of a toasted crusty Italian bread (the name escapes me).

In fact, my husband and I typically share a salad and then eat our own pizzas. The House Salad is ok, it will do in a pinch. I'm not the biggest fan of their Caesar, I wish the dressing had a bit more flavor, it's a little bland. My favorite pie is the caramelized onion, goat cheese, and garlic confit.

Last weekend while visiting friends in Atlanta I got my opportunity to try it out.  Living in Austin, TX doesn't afford many opportunities to dine in Atlanta.  Man was it an adventure.  The place is a tourist trap and the waits can be long.  We were were a large party of four adults and four kids.  They don't take reservations so myself and the other Dad went ahead at 1:30 pm and got on the 45 min wait list so the kids wouldn't go out of their minds.  We actually got seated at early at 2:05 pm and power to the building went out.  It seemed for the moment that fate conspired against me and that I would be robbed of my Chicken and Waffles experience.  Fortunately power was restored and we went about the business of ordering our meals.\\n\\nThe headliner plate is the \\"Midnight Train\\" which consists of four fried chicken breasts and one large waffle.  The wife and I decided we would share the \\"Midnight Train\\" and the \\"Veggie Soul\\" which basically lets you pick any four vegetable side dishes.  The food was plenty for the two of us.  The fried chicken was golden and crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.  It was as is should have been.  The waffle was delicious and went well with the chicken. When I first heard about the dish I thought those two wouldn't work well together but I was wrong.  The Veggie Soul was a pleasant surprise.  We had squash casserole, macaroni and cheese, fried corn, and house potatoes.  The squash casserole was sweeter than I imagined but very good.  The macaroni and cheese was better than average with a layer of slightly burned cheese coating over the top of the bowl.  Not sure why the fried corn was called \\"fried\\".  It was your basic blend of corn off the cob, onions, and peppers served in a bowl.  It was spicy and good.  Finally the potatoes were a spiced up variation of hash browns and quite enjoyable.  We capped it all off with a sweet potato cheesecake that we took home to our friends and ate after dinner that night.  The cheesecake was stunning.  It was creamy, sweet, and had a spicy nutty aroma.  Some of the best cheesecake I have had.\\n\\nThe place is very clean and well decorated with memorabilia from the Owners' music careers.  All of the staff were friendly and welcoming.  I am glad I got to try it and cross this off my bucket list.  One has to approach this place with the right mindset, however.  It is not simply about the food but the whole dining experience.  You have to plan ahead and prepare for the fact that there will likely be a very long wait.  Bring plenty of patience and plenty of appetite."},{"name":"SuperDog","address":"1438 SW Park Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I happened to be in this area on business but I totally wasn't hungry.\\nBut then I saw the sign for Superdog and I remembered that I'm a big, fat, boar-faced pig with an eating disorder and I should go inside and try this independant hot dog joint.\\nI'm glad I did....I ordered the Mt.

We went for the initial one this week and tried a couple of new items. Most everything we had was good , with the sole exception being the baked brie appetizer. While it is described as being served on toasty french bread, we did  not realize that meant a sandwich loaf of bread simply sliced open and lightly toasted and then topped with the cheese and other toppings. The amount of cheese is way too little in comparison to the bread that it is served on. My wife ended up pulling it off the bread entirely so that she didn't get full just from the bread. The dockside mahi sandwich was flavorful but I probably would not get it again, as there are other sandwiches there that are better. If you're in the mood for mahi, you'd be better off adding it to one of the salads. My wife had the eggplant napoleon and really enjoyed that. It had 3 nice large pieces of fried eggplant and she said the texture and taste was just right.\\n\\nWith the Monday deal for the summer. It is a great way to try some new items, but I think I'll stick to the more tried and true ones that I know I like from the past. If I was just rating the food, I'd probably give it a 3.

A second location opened a year later in Buckhead. This place reminds me of Tin Drum except with higher quality ingredients and customization options. You can build your own bowls or burritos (\\"rolls\\") here.\\n\\nThe restaurant is located on the ground level of the Pencil Factory Lofts, near Old Fourth Ward and Oakland Cemetery, with other businesses such as Caramba Cafe and Village Theatre. The restaurant is easy to get to because it's located close to the Downtown Connector (I-75/I-85) and there's plenty of free parking in the lofts' parking garage. Signs to parking are well-marked on Decatur St.\\n\\nThe restaurant has a clean, simple look and is spacious enough. There's a bar (with drink specials), multi-tiered seating, and TVs on every wall which is great for watching sports (they have ESPN, but not in HD) or other programs. You order and pay upfront and your food is brought to you. Delivery and takeout are popular options.\\n\\nChinese food typically isn't healthy, but Chow Bing manages to make it so. Their meats are all-natural, antibiotic-free, their seafood is sustainable, their tofu and vegetables are organic and \\"locally\\" grown. Bowls and burritos are priced just under $8-9 each. They've also got salads, soups, appetizers like fried calamari, \\"wonton nachos,\\" and pan-fried dumplings, and Chinese tacos. Everything is made to order and comes piping hot out the kitchen.\\n\\nThe Fried Potato Balls aren't a bad appetizer. They're almost like French fries in ball form. A small plate of eight come with each order. They're soft and delectable. They come with a side of \\"Yummi\\" sauce which is a savory, mayo-based dressing.\\n\\nI like the spicy Sichuan WIngs. Five come with each order. The wings are tender and meaty and are coated in a red pepper sauce which bring the heat. I like spicy food and found the wings to be spicy, but only mildly so. Despite the name, I don't believe real Sichuan peppers are used. The wings also come with real bacon bits. Note this dish can be messy to eat because of the sauce.\\n\\nFor your bowl or burrito carb, you can choose from white rice, fried rice, brown rice, or lo mein noodles. I've tried both the brown rice and lo mein noodles and they taste just fine. Of the meats, I've tried the \\"General's Chicken Tenders\\" and the Roast Pork.\\n\\nThe General's Chicken Tenders are made of all white-meat chicken. They are very good. Lightly battered with a slightly crispy exterior, moist on the inside. The chicken is served with a sweet and spicy sauce, pickled veggies (carrots and daikon radish), raw spinach, and cooked broccoli. The spinach and broccoli are green and fresh and I think the addition of the pickled carrots and radish are great.\\n\\nThe Roast Pork is tasty too. It's Chow Bing's take on charsiu, which is Chinese BBQ roast pork. Chow Bing's charsiu is less greasy and fatty than traditional charsiu. It also comes with a special hoisin BBQ sauce, which I think is OK. The leaner pork has been marinated in a red wine sauce. It comes with lettuce, pickled carrots and daikon, cilantro, and jalapeno.\\n\\nI haven't tried a burrito yet, but I heard the burritos are big. Like Mission-style Chipotle or Moe's big.\\n\\nNon-alcoholic beverages are self-serve from a fountain machine. Along with daily drink specials, they've got organic coffee and BOOZY BUBBLE TEA (in addition to non-boozy).\\n\\nService is terrific. Shout-out to Jossa and Dre.\\n\\nIf you couldn't tell, by no means should you expect an authentic Chinese restaurant experience at Chow Bing. While the owner is Chinese, the food is healthy, quick, affordable, Americanized Chinese. If this is what you're looking for, you probably won't be disappointed."},{"name":"Gladys Knight's Signature Chicken & Waffles","address":"529 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"It's a shame that after living in Atlanta for a little over two years, this past weekend was my very first attempt at Glady's and Ron's Chicken & Waffles. The wife and I were in town for a few reasons and found ourselves hungry early Sunday afternoon, and figured then was a good a time as any to finally try out the place. Since this was a first-time visit, I'm not sure about the typical scenario when trying to eat here, so I'll just share our overall experience relative to the thoughts others have posted.\\n\\n* Parking: To the immediate right of the restaurant (facing) is a parking lot that charges 7 bucks to park there all day and takes payment electronically. $7 might be a turn-off to some, but for the convenience I thought it was worth it. There's also mention of free parking to the rear of the place on the restaurant windows, but we didn't discover that til after we parked.\\n\\n* Wait time: After we snaked our way through the large group of people waiting to get a seat, in order to put our name on the list, a guy came in to place a to-go order and I overheard him tell another guy that on Sundays, the way to go is \\"to-go\\" since the wait time is ridiculous on that day. I'm not sure about others' experience(s) but our wait time was maybe a total of an hour real-time, instead of the 45 mins. the hostess mentioned. For us, that's a cake-walk compared to some places we've tried both in Atlanta, and even in Birmingham (i.e., 90-min+ wait). So - a non-issue IMO, especially considering how much worse it could be for a very touristy spot... in Atlanta no less.  We stood outside and waited as a server/hostess would come out every few minutes to call the next group in to be seated.\\n\\n* Atmosphere: Not having been before, I honestly was expecting a hole-in-the-wall, with the attractor being the food; but the atmosphere is very clean, roomy, and appealing. Motown playing in the background, a TV or two playing sports/news/what-have-you, wait staff moving back and fro, temperature moderate - overall pleasing and comfortable.\\n\\n* Service: I know this particular aspect can vary even within a few minutes from one patron to another, but our service was pretty great. Our server (Angelina perhaps?) was very patient as we wound our heads around the fact that we wouldn't be able to try *everything* in the one visit. She was also attentive, thorough and helpful over the entire meal, and genuinely seemed like she enjoyed doing what she does. And after scanning the room a few times, taking pics and just absorbing everything going on, I never saw a server that didn't look cordial or professional. So w.r.t service, we found no issues.\\n\\n* Food: Comments on the food have ranged from \\"best fried chicken I've ever had\\" to \\"over-hyped frozen food\\" it seems. We thought the food was pretty good. Honestly the food didn't cause a soul-altering experience in either my wife nor I, but it was well-prepared and it was tasty. My biggest *like* was the fact that they serve salmon croquettes which I've never found offered at a restaurant. (Typically I only get them when I cook, or my mom does.) And they were deep-fried and great. With grits, cinnamon raisin toast, and an apple cinnamon waffle thrown in, I had a wonderful meal. Of my wife's fried chicken, collard greens, sweet corn, mac-n-cheese, and sweet corn muffin plate, I tried the former two things and I thought they tasted great as well. (She loved all of it, but extra kudos to the chicken.)  So for us, the food met the mark also.\\n\\nSo, would I go back again? Yup. There are quite a few other dishes I'd like to try, and it's not often I get the chance to get my fill of soul food at a restaurant.  Touristy or not, long wait or not, parking challenges or not, I think it's definitely worth a try.

The toasted panini was comprised of kale, mozzarella, tomato slices, tomato tapenade and pesto in between multigrain bread slices. Definitely a delicious must-have as other places have much plainer sandwiches. The chicken pot pie I was neutral with, mostly due to the fact that I've had too many of the Campbell's version (canned food) in my younger years. Still decent though, you get a good hearty amount of peas, corn, carrots, chicken, and potatoes in each bite. \\n\\nIt's a pretty nice place with well lit areas, a good amount of space (you won't feel squished sitting and walking around), and nicely decorated.

But if you ask me, pizza in its most pure form is Neapolitan, and Life of Pie makes a damn fine Neapolitan pie, without the wait or fuss that often drags down similar venues.\\n\\nSo what makes a great Neapolitan pie? A thin hand-formed dough with basic toppings, typically tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil, but there are other great combinations. The pie baked in a very hot oven fueled only with hardwood, for a minute or two. Once done, the dough should be charred and smokey, but elastic and steamy inside, and the ingredients warm but not scorched.\\n\\nOnce upon a time, there was a pizza parlor in the location that now houses Ned Ludd.

They both ordered cheeseburgers (Obama requested dijon mustard on his), they joked with the staff, wrapped up their photo op, and it barely made the airwaves. Ha, just kidding! Conservative pundits from Shawn Hannity to Laura Ingarham used precious airtime to lose their minds and call the President a snob because of the mustard choice, and chided him for not being a real man for foregoing ketchup on a cheeseburger. It was a little taste of what was to come in the political climate of America from thereon in (although the insults eventually skyrocketed from \\"effete snob\\" to \\"foreign Kenyan socialist Muslim atheist Marxist dictator and ultimate Antichrist intent on destroying the USA and the entire universe\\"), but the point was I wanted to try this \\"Five Guys\\" and put dijon mustard on one, just to see what all the fuss was about.\\n\\nSo, yeah, that was like, three years ago. After a particularly fruitless visit to the Arboretum shops where my mother and I didn't find anything we were looking for in terms of Christmas gifts, I noticed this Five Guys. And I was starving. It was finally time.\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed was a quote from GQ on the wall, proclaiming Five Guys to be the best burger a man can get for $5. That was heartening, despite the fact it's wholly contradictory. How can I fit into all the designer crap they suggest if I were eating at Five Guys all the time? Then I remembered it wasn't all the time, so I felt better. \\n\\nPeanuts. Lots and lots of peanuts are out in the open, although I was never the \\"crack open peanuts\\" type of guy. Not even at a restaurant where you can throw the shells on the floor like at Willie Nelson's place, whatever it's called. \\n\\nThe menu is straight and to the point, reminiscent of In 'N Out's (although I must pause and emphasize that NO FAST FOOD IN THE WORLD beats In 'N Out, so that's not what I am implying, at all.) From what I gathered, Five Guys also does NOT have a secret menu, so I refrained from asking for a Double Double Animal Style and instead ordered a bacon cheeseburger with everything on it except ketchup. Gah, I'm such an evil, un-American socialist! I added the Five Guys fries, a la carte, which are cooked in pure, no cholesterol, peanut oil. \\n\\nTheir unsweetened tea was horrendous (as so many in fast food restaurants are), so I switched to soda. As I was filling up my Diet Coke, a woman walked past me in a coat I faintly recognized. Surely that wasn't Catherine T.? Was it? She didn't say hi to me. I'm glad we are both check-in fanatics, because I verified she checked in to Five Guys 7 minutes before me. Good...now I can say hi without the potentially awkward scenario of approaching a stranger.\\n\\nShe totally hadn't noticed me, which also allayed my fears she had seen me and was purposefully ignoring me. We were catching up so much, she finally invited Mom and me to join her at the table. While I scarfed down my meal, Catherine and Mom talked about the Beatles and assorted restaurants' openings/closings. I was busy enjoying a burger that can be described as juicy and very delicious (albeit a little *too* greasy). I especially enjoyed the grilled mushrooms, and for someone who has a distaste for melted cheese, I didn't mind this one at all. This burger was inhaled, barely even chewed...but that was more a function of hunger than taste.  \\n\\nThe fries are above average in quality, and surprisingly large in quantity. When I watched an employee fill another order by pouring fries into a bag, I thought that customer was stocking up for several people. Turns out everyone gets a ton of fries with an order. Interesting approach. But remember, they're tasty on the lips, and dangerous on the hips.\\n\\nI'd rank Five Guys \\"up there\\" on my list of preferred fast food. It certainly comes highly recommended...although to be honest, I have to say overall it is slightly \\"oversold\\". It's a decent bacon cheeseburger and I didn't leave full. but all the pithy one line reviews all over the place extolling its many virtues would make it sound on par with In 'N Out, when it is clearly not. \\n\\nThe best part about the stop was definitely hanging out with Catherine. I'm glad she got to meet my mom and get to know Mom's quirky personality, mostly so she knows I'm not just making stuff up about her as I go. \\n\\nI'll definitely be back the next time I have a craving. If it's good enough for the President, it's good enough for me.  \\n\\n3 1/2 Stars."},{"name":"Angel's Taqueria","address":"2225 NW Wilson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Carne Asada Fries - need I say more?

Thinking the taco would have been better. Flavor was drowned by bread. And I thought my meat was a little fatty.\\n\\nPARMESAN FRIES: First, the name isn't accurate. It's their basic fries. Second, I only knew they were Parmesan fries because I looked at the menu online (no description on big truck menu). Third, good, but I wish it would have been served with some sort of dipping sauce - aioli, siracha mayo, etc. Fourth, I still prefer Cover 3 Parmesan fries over these.\\n\\nBBQ TACO: Solid BBQ taco. I even yummed out loud. I did get a hunk of fat (eww), but I overcame. Not your typical Texas BBQ taco, though. The slaw (Asian slaw?) on it was delicious. Wish I would have gotten a second taco instead of a slider. The size was not impressive. 2 of these tacos = $6. Yet I can get a Torchy's taco for $4 for an even more full and more flavor.\\n\\nWould I eat Peached Tortilla again? Absolutely. In this food truck crazed town, I didn't feel jipped.

As a promotion at the time, bento and ramen were discounted, and they served mochi ice cream for free (which is always a treat).\\n\\nThis wasn't our best ramen or bento ever, and we wish the menu were expanded, but it was more than adequate for a casual weekday evening out."},{"name":"Stanford's Restaurant & Bar","address":"913 Lloyd Ctr","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"The menu has a large variety of options and service was friendly and prompt. \\n\\nI ordered the beer cheese soup and fish tacos for lunch.

Juices are delicious.  So why only a 2 star rating?  PLASTIC CUPS!  Each time I order a juice, it is automatically put in a plastic cup, rather than a glass one!  I know it's easier on the employees to simply throw out cups, rather than run them through a dishwasher, but the waste really bothers me.  I found the veggie burger a bit undercooked, but my nieces LOVED them.  The other reason for the 2 star is the gluten free option for burgers.  It is simply a piece of heavy buckwheat bread, simply awful!  There is a gluten free baker (Pane Rize) a 2 minute walk away, which supplies light fluffy hamburger buns. Also Whole Foods sells Udi's Gluten free buns which are fantastic.

I haven't tried any specialty drinks, but have had quite a few of their food items and I would not recommend coming here to eat. I'll just list the individual reviews of food items I've had below:\\n\\nDouble Barrel Queso- regular size velveta tasting Queso with some ground beef thrown in. Nothing special. Guacamole is pretty chunky and tasty though. \\n\\nPulled Pork Bourbon BBQ Nachos- This is by far the best thing I have had here. But I may be biased because I love pulled pork. \\n\\nTriple Cheese Flatbread Pizza- This was awful. For starters, they kinda pile the slices on top of each other for some reason, which seems to be totally weird... And messy. To add to that, they also didn't cook it enough at all. It was doughy and way too much runny cheesiness. \\n\\nChicken + Waffle- What a letdown this was. I was really craving it too. Chicken was flavorless and waffle was soggy. Alternatively, 24 Diner has an amazing chicken and waffles. \\n\\nOriginal House-Stuffed Hamburger- My friend has had this, when asked how it was, he replied \\"Acceptable\\". So yeah, take it how you will. \\n\\nChocolate Chip Cookie Ice Cream Sandwich- I'm not really a big sweets person and only had a couple bites of this. It's pretty good. Pretty chocolaty and lots of cookie. \\n\\nAs I mentioned above, the service was pretty phenomenal. Granted, I think we were the only people there on a Monday at 8pm... But props to the server dude for not slacking at his job. \\n\\nOne last thing, I'm not 100% on this, but I have a good memory and I'm pretty sure our CC bill was $5 higher than I signed for. I don't keep receipts and it's not that huge of a deal, but still, keep an eye out. I remember having cash I wanted to get rid of and leaving that as a tip while only leaving a little bit of a tip on my actual CC.

This proved to be a daunting task as it was July 4th (El Azteca and El Patio were our first two choices, and were both closed for the holiday).  But we finally remembered Amaya's, and they answered when we called, so we went there with a party of 6, and everyone was really happy.  \\n\\nI guess my husband and I have now decided to make it a tradition to eat at Amaya's on July 4th.  We headed there for lunch after checking out of the downtown hotel we stayed in to celebrate our first wedding anniversary.  \\n\\nWe were surprised that there were so many people waiting to eat there, as we'd only been for dinner before and never had to wait for a table.  We were given a buzzer and told that it would be about 15 minutes, so that sounded okay.  \\n\\nWhile we we waited we surveyed the other folks doing the same, and felt under-tattooed (I have 3 tattoos, only one of which is small, but none were showing at the time).  Used to that in Austin but not so much at Amaya's.  \\n\\nAnyhow, this review is already too long and I haven't even gotten to the food and such.  Better do bullet points!\\n\\n*drinks: I ordered iced tea and water, and my husband ordered coffee and water.  My iced tea seemed to both of us to be chamomile, which we found pretty odd.  I wanted to wake up, not get drowsier.  Oh well.  My husband had settled for coffee after finding out they had no aguas frescas.  I guess he liked it okay.  Our drinks were refilled many times despite the fact that the restaurant was quite busy, so that was cool.\\n\\n*appetizer stuff: Salsa was very spicy, kinda nice for a change.  Chips were okay ... crispy and thin, but we kept getting the tiny pieces, oh well.  We ordered a small queso, and that was fine, not great.  We added some salsa to it and it tasted better.  Had to flag our waitress down once for a chip refill, but at least it worked.\\n\\n*main dishes: I only order one thing at Amaya's: 2 chicken puffy tacos, no lettuce, with rice and beans.  It's very rare for me to keep going back to one dish at a restaurant, but this particular item is so good that I find myself extremely reluctant to stray.  I really like their stewed chicken.  So often stewed chicken at Mexican places is fatty, stringy, an odd color, or full of bones, but this chicken is the opposite of that.  Of course the fresh-fried puffy taco shells are great, and don't seem to get soggy as easily as they do at other places.  Cheese is the typical Tex-Mex orange stuff ... gotta love it.  The tomatoes were nice and ripe this time (not that I can recall them being any other way at any other visit).  Rice and beans were good too.  The rice was the perfect texture and obviously made with love.  The beans had a good amount of lard flavor.  They needed a bit of salt but of course I could add that easily.  I asked for two corn tortillas to eat with my meal, and they arrived promptly, hot, fresh, and delicious.  My husband made fun of me for ordering the same thing again, but when I gave him a bite of one of my tacos, he said he might have to order it too next time.  He liked his food, just not as much as he liked mine.  He'd ordered the Machacado con Huevos.  I tasted it and thought it was good, nice amount of beef flavor, saltiness, and other ingredients.\\n\\noverall:  I'd like to keep the July 4th tradition going, but that doesn't mean we'll be waiting another year until we go back!"},{"name":"Peoples Rx","address":"3801 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I LOVE coming here!

Much to our pleasant surprise, there were only about 4 people in front of us, so we only waited 30 minutes! \\n\\nI ordered the beef rib, brisket, turkey, and chipotle sausage. The beef rib was excellent: it was classic fall-off-the-bone juicy but did not feel overly greasy. This was actually my first time trying BBQ beef rib, so I can't comment how it stacks up against the rest. The brisket was very similar to the beef rib in terms of taste and texture, so it was quite enjoyable too and among the best brisket I've tasted. I was really impressed by the turkey: never before had I tasted such flavorful, soft turkey! While the beef rib and brisket still tasted better on an absolute basis, the turkey far exceeded my expectations and was a great addition to the meal. \\n\\nWhile the meats were superb, I was left desiring two things from la Barbecue: (1) the chipotle sausage was alright, nothing spectacular, and (2) the pickles and bread cost extra. Instead of the chipotle sausage, I should've gone for the pulled pork or the pork ribs, both of which were quite tasty (from my friend's plate).  \\n\\nI'm looking forward to my next visit (that will hopefully also include just a short wait)!"},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Free beer while you wait in the scorching heat???

After that debacle, I finally received my (cold, begrudging) coffee (with milk instead of the cream I asked for), and it was time to order.

A selection of impressions from the meal itself:\\n\\n* Ribs: Very tough all around. Pork ribs were extra-tough. Lamb ribs were... odd. Sauce: Spicy, and yet somehow still bland. Amazing! \\n* Mac 'n' cheese: Meh. I've had better. Same for the potato salad.\\n* Greens: Too vinegary for my taste, but to each their own.\\n* Trout plate: A diamond in the rough. Pretty kick-ass delicious.\\n* Atmosphere: We sat DIRECTLY beneath a peaked A/C unit, which was set to 68 and still didn't manage to cool the cramped, slightly-below-ground-level restaurant off a whit. Sweat beaded on our foreheads while we attempted to choke down the mediocre food and hear each other talk over the thump and whirr of the broken-down A/C and the overly loud, jarring mishmash of faux-Southern folk and modern radio pop hits.\\n\\nThe server made sure to stop by - not to refresh our drinks or ask how we liked the food, no.

REALLY?\\n\\nAfter finishing our meal and some really weird posturing from the our favorite server about whether or not we wanted boxes, the check arrived.

They just figure \\"oh, you're ordering a veggie burger, here, have that with a single leaf of arugula.\\" And oh man, were those onion rings fried to perfection. As an added bonus, you even get a choice of burger - I went for the mushroom chickpea burger which not only combines two of my favorite things ever, but also kind of tastes like falafel. Add some heat in the form of pepper relish, some mayo, and yes, even some arugula, and you have got yourself some greasy goodness in the form of a veggie burger. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think I may have just found a veggie burger that beats Local Burger's. \\n\\nObviously I have to go back, because I need to try everything else on their menu.

Yesterday's was actually OK--the waitress was kinda prompt, and kinda attentive.  I ordered a combo plate of barbacoa and lengua, and one of those yummy \\"Hecho en Mexico\\" Cokes.

It was not my taste buds that is the problem, but it was the whole table who agreed. We have all had multiple Thai dishes and have tried Tom Kha before... this was NOT Tom Kha. Tom Kha is supposed to taste similar to Tom Yum, just with some coconut. This was coconut with a pound of salt in it!\\n\\nHalibut- nothing to mention\\n\\nRoasted Duck Salad- Once again, the sauce was super salty ... i've had Thai salads before and they tend to be a bit more sour and sometimes sweet... this one was too salty... the fish sauce was not altered enough and I can smell and taste the saltiness of it.\\n\\nBasal Chicken- Probably the only one that was not salty but nothing notable to mention.\\n\\nFried Calamari- Sadly, the only thing I found good was a generic dish that can be found in different restaurants not exclusive to Thai.\\n\\n\\nThis place is on my \\"banned\\" list... never AGAIN... \\n\\nEdit: this was my SECOND time here ( i always give a place a second chance), and the first time wasn't that pleasant either... aside from the Happy hour pricing, i would NOT come here just for taste."},{"name":"Asian Kitchen","address":"2828 Stelzer Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"\\"A Google User\\n5 years ago-\\nThe spicy wings are AMAZING\\"\\n\\nFive years later, these are still my favorite wings in CBUS.

It's not my favorite version as it is fried in lots of oil making it very greasy and there is no accompanying sauce/vinegar.

The food options are incredible, especially having it be an all-vegan restaurant with available substitutions. I ordered the Kendall Square burger -- this was HUGE but so delicious. I barely got halfway through the burger because it was a large portion, but kept trying to eat my way through it because it was delicious. My friend got the falafel burger, which was okay, but the falafel was a little dry. We also ordered onion rings, which were twice the size of average onion rings but taste just as good, and the fries, which were good. Lastly, (I know we ordered a lot), we ordered a dessert recommended by the staff. I believe it was a caramel bourbon \\"cheesecake\\" and if they have it when you go, I highly highly recommend it. It tastes like regular cheesecake and wasn't overly sweet like I expected it to be. \\n\\nSERVICE: The staff here are extremely kind, however, we did have to wait quite a long time to place our order. Regardless, the staff are great and very knowledgeable about the establishment. \\n\\nOTHER: The layout of Veggie Galaxy reminds me of an old and homey diner, which I absolutely love. They serve \\"diner comfort food,\\" which is fitting for the restaurant as a whole. Additionally, they partner which local farms and stores for all of there food resources, which is encouraging to see in the Boston community. \\n\\nOverall, I would recommend coming here especially if you're a vegan/vegetarian.
