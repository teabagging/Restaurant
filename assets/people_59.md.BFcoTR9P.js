Its just not how I was raised to complain, but dang, this place was bad.\\n\\nTHE FOOD:::\\nThere were three of us, and we disliked everything we got; The spicy chicken sandwich was neither spicy, nor good. It was bland, too thick for the seasoning method (imagine 1 1/4 inches of un-seasoned white meat) and came with maybe half a teaspoon of the jalapeno ranch (i ordered more, but when it came it wasn't spicy either, and even when I added it to the burger, the burger still managed to be the blandest chicken sandwich ever). The pretzel bun was good though. The burger was not excessively large, but I did not finish it, opting instead to go back to eating the chips and salsa rather than force it down.\\n\\nThe Taos burgher was spicier than the chicken sandwich, but still not deserving a spicy tag (it didn't have one, but it made me more upset that my spicy chicken sandwich was bland). The mushrooms didn't work for any of us, and the burger was cooked wrong. House fries were good.\\n\\nThe veggie fajitas were not good. The spice was off and made everything taste cloyingly sweet. We asked for a to go plate for it because my GF couldn't eat it and we didn't want to leave a full plate on the table. \\n\\nThe perfect margarita wasn't great. IDK what to say about this, I think its subjective; My mother-in -law thought it needed more tequila, I thought it needed less. Probably don't judge the drink on this review for that reason.\\n\\nTHE RESTAURANT:::\\nCame for the view, waited for the deck, spent 45 minutes staring at the crowd of people between me and the lake. Crowded does not begin to sum it up. Mother in law went down to the edge of the deck to see the water, was asked to return to her table by a server. I got upset when I realized there were 5 tables at the edge of the deck that were empty, and never got filled, but that they shoved me against a wall with no view of the lake.\\n\\nService was slow, like really slow. Place was hot, but not unbearably so, because they had fans and a lot of umbrellas (those made it hard to move around though). Most telling was the fact that the table next to ours had their deserts comped because they never got their food, and when a server noticed that none of us had finished our food and we all looked dissatisfied she very helpfully offered to send over a manager. I looked up and noticed that there were three managers, each talking to different tables. They all looked like they were apologizing, and we just decided that we didn't want to be there any more.

Our waiter was extremely nice, he suggested the Putine, which we have never tried before. To be honest, it wasn't that great, it was very salty. We ordered the ribeye steak, and again, not great at all. I probably would have compared their steak with a steak from roadhouse. Roadhouse has a better steak in my opinion.

It doesn't even have a real sign up yet, so it is super new.  \\nMy boyfriend and I decided to stop in and grab a morning snack while out visiting a couple nearby neighborhood yard sales on Saturday.  \\nUpon entering my first thought was how sparse it all seemed.  There was very little d√©cor on the walls and what was there seemed too small for the room.  There were lots of little phrases on the wall, but they were in a small font so they looked kind of funny.  \\nMy next thought was this place advertises as a donut caf√©, but there were not that many variety of donuts available.  I would say there were 8-10 different types of donuts, which is not an insignificant number, but decidedly less than what is available at Dunkin or DK down the street, so I feel like they will need to expand their options to compete.  \\nMy next thought was that it advertises as a caf√©, but they didn't seem to have a variety of coffees or even an espresso machine.  Caf√© literally means coffee so I expect more than just standard regular and decaf.  Trust me I was excited about the prospect about getting my caffeine fix somewhere other than Dunkin or Starbucks.  I would much prefer to frequent a small local business, but as of current it doesn't look like that is an option here.  \\nSo, the boyfriend and I ordered a cream cheese pastry with honey that was quite delicious.  Truth be told it reminded me of a homemade cream cheese toaster strudel which is not a bad thing as I love toaster strudel (Insert Gretchen Wieners joke). \\n He ordered a bagel sandwich with sausage, egg, and cheese.  The sausage was very good and the bagel was an excellent consistency.  I ordered a croissant breakfast sandwich, but they were out of croissants, so I instead opted for a breakfast platter.  It said my breakfast platter came with eggs, ham, and toast.  Naturally, I presumed this was 3 separate items, but when my plate arrived the ham was diced up in the egg like an omelet.  It was totally fine, but not what I expected based on the description.  Food was served with plastic silverware and Styrofoam plates.  This did not thrill me as it is far from environmentally conscious, but more than that I just really hate the feeling and sound of Styrofoam. When I asked for hot sauce I was brought out some very good hot sauce, but it was essentially in a ketchup style packet.  Again, I'm not feeling as though this place lives up to the name caf√©.  Yes, there are seats inside, but with Styrofoam plates, plastic forks, and hot sauce packets I'm not getting the sense that you are meant to dine in at all.  \\n The place was pretty busy when we were in there, but it was a Saturday morning, during Snow bird season, and there was a community yard sale going on right down the street.  The question is will they be able to maintain that business in the summer time?  I'm not sure and with their current pricing I find it unlikely. The pricing was my biggest disappointment.  $4.75 for a breakfast sandwich?  That seems really steep, especially for this area.  The Davenport cliental is used to used to 2 for $3 egg mcmuffins or $1 sausage biscuits.  $4.75 is more than Dunkin, Starbucks, or anything in the area that I can think of.  The problem is that it can be difficult for a small local business to compete with the mammoth chains, so they need to make it stand out somehow.  Decorate the place a little more, put on some great music, get an espresso machine, and serve those dining in on real plates and I think there might be something here.  \\nBecause the food was good I am giving the place 3 stars for now.  I intend to give it a little more time to find its identity and hopefully I can update this review in the future."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"This place has an amazing view over Lake Travis.

Preposterous, right?\\n\\nAlaska Roll - $3.95 (7/7)\\nThis isn't your typical Alaska Roll that you get at sushi joints. This is basically an Avocado Roll drenched with some sort of mysterious awesome sauce (it might just be the typical salad dressing you get at sushi place's, but it's full of garlic-y goodness) topped with a thin slice of salmon sashimi. A lot of Sushi Garden/Town/California noobies don't know about this because the restaurants don't write a description as to what's in the roll, nor do they provide pictures, but GET THIS.

The tofu lives up to how it's supposed to taste - sweet and juicy. Have this without dipping it in soya sauce!\\n\\nTamago - $1.00 (5/7)\\n\\nBecause the tamago is quite thin, you can't really taste the sweetness of it. Still a good piece of sushi, though. Soya sauce may be needed.\\n\\nEbi - $1.20 (7/7)\\n\\nThere's not much to say about this, it's just your typical piece of ebi nigiri. They do, however, put quite a bit of wasabi underneath, so if you can't handle spice - you have been warned. \\n\\nToro - $1.30 (7/7)\\n\\nAs with all other sashimi, you definitely get your bang for your buck here. The pieces are huge!\\n\\nAmaEbi - $1.80 (7/7)\\n\\nAgain, it tastes how it's supposed to. You can safely say their sashimi are fresh, thus, food = awesome.\\n\\nHotate - $1.50 (7/7)\\n\\nFat, plump, juicy. Need we say more?\\n\\nMasago - $1.30 (7/7)\\n\\nThey load this up! It can get quite messy. Be sure you either eat this all in one bite or have your plate right under your mouth to catch all the falling eggs!\\n\\nSaba - $1.00 (7/7)\\n\\nCan't go wrong with this. Or any of their nigiri's. Or roll's. Or cooked item's. Or sashimi. \\n\\nRatings:\\n\\nFood: 7/7\\n\\nService: 3/7 (they're getting better, though!)\\n\\nValue: 7/7"},{"name":"The Greek Corner","address":"1600 N Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This is my absolute FAVORITE restaurant in all of Orlando...

LET ME START OFF BY SAYING THAT I HAVE NEVER WRITTEN A REVIEW! I have never felt the need to until now. I was having sunday lunch with a friend and as usual I ordered the sushi. She started off with the avocado egg rolls with were okay. She also ordered the crab crunch rolls even though she is not a big fan of sushi. We waited for our order and when it came out there was a BUG under one of the sushi rolls on her plate. A BUG!!! She poked at it with her fork to see if it was really a BUG and to our disgust it was. We informed our waiter and he very nicely told us he would bring another plate out. So we waited and waited and waited while I was already done with my rolls. BUG free thank goodness.. As the new rolls came out she had already lost her appetite as it took longer than the first time. She ate one and couldn't have anymore. Of course she couldn't after finding a bug the first time! So when the checks came out I noticed that the rolls were not taken off her bill. I immediately spoke to the water and told him I did not think her rolls should be on the bill after finding a BUG first of all and second of all having the wait a longer amount of time for the second order to come out. He agreed and said he would speak to his manager about it. Two minutes later and a manager came to our table and asked what happened. I explained and when I was done he said it was not their fault it was an open outdoor setting and that there could be bugs around. I quickly told him that it was true but that the bug could've also came from inside the kitchen. He quickly gave a disapproving shake of his head and said there was no bug when the plate was brought back to the kitchen. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!!!??? At this point I was ANGRY. Did he really just say that? Is he accusing 2 young ladies of lying about there being a bug on the plate? Of course the BUG wasn't there anymore we poked it with the fork to make sure it was a bug. I told him regardless of where the bug came from it was on the plate and we were going to walk out of this restaurant without paying for that. It was RIDICULOUS. Truly unprofessional on his part to come to our table and argue about the incident. Also that he would speak to us in a tone that made it seem like he was skeptical about the whole situation. I have never dealt with a WORSE experience in my life. Especially at a restaurant like this where people come to enjoy drink and food specials. After this particular manager left I asked the waiter if there was another manager I could speak to because the whole thing was ridiculous for this manager to put us in this position. The next manager came and was polite enough to say it was uncalled for and he would take care of it right away. All of this could have been avoided had the first manager done just that. I explained to him that if that was the way management worked around this place that I would not be a returning customer. And I stand by that it was ABSOLUTELY THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!! It's a health concern to the public and people who eat here. PSA:CHECK YOUR FOOD FOR BUGS!!!!!!!

So, needless to say, I know good crawfish when I see them.  \\n\\nSure, it's tucked away in a strip center, but the crawfish are the best I've found in town.

What a great touch!  \\n\\nOf course no one eats the shells, but the reviews that say \\"don't season the shells!\\" apparently don't appreciate the added effort for flavor.  You see, the sauce gets on your hands when you're pulling off the tails and in turn it gets on the tailmeat once you've peeled it. Therefore, the seasoning on the outside does make a difference!  \\n\\nAnd their gumbo is excellent too.  We've ordered the boiled shrimp and crab legs in the past, an they were both good.

I have been a regular patron over the last three years, but the service and quality of food had taken an absolute nose dive. I would usually sit at the bar, especially when Jerry was serving as he was the only bar tender who genuinely cared about his guests. \\n\\nToo many of the other servers and bar staff are too preoccupied with each other, and not their customers. Also, quality control issues were shown in the news. After not seeing a college gal pal of mine for nearly 13 years, we sat at the bar ordering drinks and appetizers. We were appalled when a female bartender looked at us and said, \\"If you're not going to order anything else, we need you to leave because we need these seats.\\" I couldn't believe it. Although I talked with the manager on duty, I wasn't given an reassurance that the server in question would disciplined or coached for her behavior. \\n\\nI attempted giving them a last chance this past week, and they did not have the ingredients for two of the coffees I wanted to order. I've never had to settle for a third choice at Intermezzo, and I don't think I'll ever step foot in there again.

I had heard good things about the food.  The portion size was fine.  The actual food was just okay.  I ordered the schrod.  The fish was cooked well but there was wayyyy too much butter.  They forgot my husband's entree.  It took a while for anyone to come back and explain that it was not made yet.  The manager came over and handled the situation well.  The offered him a salad while he waited which he declined.  They also immediately offered to take his meal off the bill.  When it came time for dessert we ordered one of each for the table to share.  Honestly the desserts were just okay.  The apple crisp.  They did not core the apple well at all.  You can feel some of the core as you ate it.  The cheesecake was slightly frozen so you could not taste it.  The waitress was young and inexperienced.  She didn't come over to make sure we were happy with the dessert.  She just came and gave the bill.  I told her about the cheesecake and she just said sorry.  Then she said it was in the refridgartor.  I said that it was frozen with icsicles and it didn't have any flavor.  I didn't mentioned how I didn't like the other ones.  I said I wanted the cheesecake taken off the bill.  She just looked at me, sighed and said I will ask.  I understand that she can't just say okay but she kind of had an attitude.  The first mistake with the missing meal was her mistake.  She should have been nothing but apologetic.  The manager came over and had the same attitude.  Honestly I was shocked.  I could have told them exactly what I thought of the meal but I didn't.

We are told that upstairs is the only available seating for now, so, upstairs we go!  Right away, I order espresso with Frangelico...my friends follows suit (why wouldn't they? Espresso + Frangelico = delicious).  It took a really long time to get our espresso, and one of them was cold when it arrived.  \\n\\nI decided on french toast (no pancakes on the plate menu :(, though I do love french toast ) while my friend got corned beef hash.

Which is fine for me - if I am getting what I pay for.  Sadly, I didn't.  While the french toast was good, it was sooo small, and the home potatoes I got as a side were only lukewarm.

This food cart blow 'em out  of the water (not to mention any of Columbus's other barbecue establishments.) \\n\\nSo far I've only tried the brisket. The meat itself is perfectly smoked (as evidenced by the pink smoke ring) and has a nice, crunchy crust. Even sans sauce it's amazing, smoky, tender, and still incredibly lean-- you're not gonna end up with big, inedible chunks of fat and gristle from this place. The sauce is sweet, slightly peppery, fruity, and has hints of liquid smoke. With a smooth, caramely flavor, it makes the perfect compliment to the smoky beef but, again, this barbecue's rub is so good that the meat can certainly be eaten without.\\n\\nThe sides, like previous Yelpers have said, definitely aren't Ray Ray's strongest suit but they're still damn fine compliments to the stars of the show. The coleslaw was of the creamy variety (rather than vinegared), with crisp, fresh shreds of cabbage. Oh, and the baked beans-- freakin' heavenly. I made these lunch the next day on their own.

I'd noticed the Luke's trailer on multiple occasions and had even caught whiffs of the wonderful smells emanating from within. We decided to give it a shot. Well, I don't even know where to begin with the descriptions of awesomeness, but I will try...\\n\\nWe had a great first impression right off the bat. The girl who took our order noticed us standing outside the trailer right away. She was very friendly, attentive and informative. The menu was surprising. I had expected a bunch of burger variations, but Luke's has pulled pork, shrimp, chicken, beef, cheese, and veggie sandwich options. They all sounded *amazing*, but we settled on \\"The Burger\\" and \\"The Pig\\". As we sat outside the trailer enjoying the evening breeze, we just hoped our food would taste half as good as it smelled. Uh, it DID.\\n\\nMy burger was cooked to perfection (pink in the middle, thank you very much), and it was a sloppy, delicious thing of beauty. It came with two kinds of cheese and bacon and some delicious fresh red tomatoes and spinach. But it was the sauce. Ohhhhhh.......the SAUCE that made it divine. I think it contains a bit o' mayo, a bit of bbq sauce, and \\"love.\\" My boyfriend was extremely happy with his pulled pork sandwich as well.

They just do everything right from the bahn mi's to the sandwich. And they have a perfect combo that I also get. Half size of beef pho, and half size of bahn mi. You can upgrade your bahn mi to full size if you'd like as well. The prices are also something that you cannot beat. The prices elsewhere upcharge for bahn mi and pho and it's not even that great. I recommend lee's bakery to everyone when they ask where they should get pho. Usually it's not a busy rush when I go in. But I went on a Sunday for lunch and they were pretty packed. This is just. The only place you need to come to get pho and bahn mi's at. At the front counter, they also sell their bread and it's very very cheap. You can also buy a day old bread which is still perfectly fine but they make the breads daily so if it's a day old they need to sell it and best part is that they sell it for even cheaper!

They offer a wide variety of foods, and their breakfast menu is available from opening all the way to 4 P.M, which is astounding and incredibly convenient. \\n\\nAfter 4, the lunch and breakfast menus give way to the dinner menu, which is really good. I see a lot of reviews here about gyro sandwiches, and if that's what you're going to Antoni's for, that's fine I suppose. But the dishes such as their dolmathes (my favorite) and flaming saginaki are far and away more enjoyable. \\n\\nThe place is very much family owned and run, and your mileage may vary as far as service. Sometimes our waiter/waitress is exuberant and full of energy, while others are more laid back. For example, most often when the saginaki is set alight, the waitstaff will loudly exclaim \\"Opa!\\" before handing it to  you, while another particular individual sort of just said it, and handed it to us before explaining he's not much for yelling (for this reason, this particular server is my favorite. I didn't come here for a spectacle, just good food). Regardless, the service has always been attentive, though when it gets crowded you should expect some waiting, as you would any other establishment.\\n\\nIf you're looking for great desserts then I would suggest going elsewhere. While they do have a selection, and the items are good, it's not really extensive, nor will it really satisfy your sweet tooth.\\n\\nIn summary: Great food, attentive staff, reasonable prices.

Again, they use a freshly baked pita that is warmed before constructing the sandwich.  I wouldn't call the seitan fake meat - I'm not sure what I'd compare it too.  All I know is that it is smothered in BBQ sauce and is warm and tasty.  At times I'll pair the sandwich with an order of the rosemary fries.

While the two of us waited at the table, the waiter brought coffee, but seemed very flustered and busy.  If we had been in a hurry at all, we might have been annoyed by his slightly inattentive service, but as it was we had no problems.\\n\\nA friend had recommended the banana stuffed french toast to me, but as my other friend got that, I went for the chocolate friend toast , adding a side of home fries to satisfy my savory taste buds.  I only like going out to eat with people who will let me share their food, but I definitely enjoyed my meal better than the banana french toast-  it was just TOO banana-y and mushy for my personal taste.  I know people vary on their appreciation of french toast and for me, I don't enjoy when the bread has soaked up enough egg to take on the eggy texture inside.  Anyway, the chocolate french toast was delicious-- neither eggy nor overwhelmingly un-breakfast like, it came with raspberry sauce and syrup, and i asked for strawberries on top as well.  Home fries were nice and crispy and a good size.\\n\\nAs for the decor and atmosphere-- it was kind of confusing.  I really liked the nicer-than-normal-deli-or-diner atmosphere without being pretentious.  And the paintings and the table set up were cool.  But,  I found it weird that they were selling T-shirts with cheesy puns on Jewish words.  I know even the restaurant website emphasizes this place is more hip than \\"traditional\\", but somehow the T-shirts just makes me think Hard Rock Cafe tourist attraction or something.\\n\\nOverall, good experience.

The biscuits and gravy are quite good but everything else my friends and I have ordered here has been average at its best.\\n\\nWhy give one-star to a place that has average food, you might ask. This brings us to the critical issue of wait to food quality ratio. As Mother's website claims that the restaurant does not take reservations for weekend brunch (I'll have readers note that three parties were seated ahead of us today that the host announced were reservations), you are going to wait to get a table during peak brunch hours (10am-1pm) especially if you are more than two. \\n\\nThis wasn't our first trip to Mother's, so we were prepared when we were told at noon that it would be a 30-40 minute wait. As many others have pointed out a tasty coffee and scone awaits at Stumptown just two blocks away to pass the time. 1 hour and 10 minutes later, we were seated. Now this means that the host was off by a multiple of two when estimating our wait.

It was very good. Slightly juicy, but a little cold. The bread it was served on did not jive well with the meat. It was a hard, dark, cold sesame seed roll. Something softer would have been nice. Also the seeded bun gave a dark nutty flavor that overpowered the meat. I do like that they put the sauce on the side, because the wood smoked flavor did not warrant any additions.

There are no chairs and tables; there is no salt available (because \\"we're such good cooks you don't need salt\\"); if tahini pours out of the sandwich and down your shirt because there's no plate, well, at least we're not harming the environment by giving you a plate. I paid $2 for a homemade pomegranate soda that tasted of nothing and could not have been more than ten ounces in volume if you subtract the ice. I said I was very hungry and was told, \\"French fries are a good filler.\\" Okay, I'll try, but sadly the fries were mediocre--both too thin and mealy. The eggplant-and-egg sandwich is a good idea but I could have fried or braised better eggplant myself (and I might have used a touch of salt). The egg was a sliced, hard-boiled egg not spread evenly about the sandwich but inserted, like a lump, in the middle. Tahini was used extremely liberally. The thing didn't taste much different from the seitan sandwich I had a few months ago that was so bad I threw it away (but that was my first time eating seitan, which I discovered I loathed, so it's unfair to blame CFL for that horrid experience). Re: the should-have-been-much-better eggplant/egg sandwich, pomegranate soda, and fries: I didn't complain because I could sense that there would be a lot of \\"Well, you don't understand how We At Clover Food Lab approach food\\" and that if I couldn't sign on as a disciple, what was I doing there? I *loathe* chain places but this, my second visit to a Clover-Food-Lab operation had me wishing for (1) comfortable seats (2) food that didn't come with implied preaching (3) a customer-service orientation (4) unlimited refills on my soda.

It is pretty inconsistent, but I figured because of such a great big location like Copley Place, it would be one of the better ones. It's really a fine hotel, right off the bat you should valet your car because there really is not too many other options. Even as a gold or platinum status Marriott member, you still have to pay $60 per night to park your vehicle. It's because the parking lot is owned by a  different company so they have no pull. Be prepared to pay an additional $60 per night if you plan to have a vehicle with you. There are other lots around but you would have to walk, which is always a struggle when you have luggage with you. That was not my favorite. Checking in was fine. The elevator situation is a little bit bizarre so just make sure that you're paying attention to that! You have to enter your floor before you get in the elevator otherwise it will send you where everybody else is going. The rooms are fine. We had a pretty good view, beds were comfortable, and the spacing was great. The reason why we were staying here is because my sorority sisters and I were all dressing up like different versions of Lady Gaga and going to her concert at Fenway that night. We were definitely ready to party in the hotel room, we walked across the street to the Stat market and picked up food and alcohol to get the night going. We got home late and went to sleep (after doing some cleaning). We left really early the next morning because I had to get on a plane. My sister and friends checked out for me so I'm not sure how that went, however the only report I got back is that they charged my card $60 for parking!

The tacos do fare a little better, but are certainly nothing special.\\n\\nThis is even more disappointing because the 12th & Hawthorne food cart pod is a late-night hot spot that is severely limited in hearty, non-snack dinner options. This cart does not live up to the Portland food cart scene or even a good quality Mexcian cart - there are better options even in the suburbs.\\n\\nHowever, if you need some late night Mexican food that's not from a major fast food chain, you don't have many options - probably one of the only reasons this cart is probably still alive and well.

Pho Thien has a small number of issues that could be easily fixed to make this place feel top end. First off, the location feels small which is not really their own fault, but the decor feels cheap which only feels amplified by the limited space that they have. 2nd is that the service wasn't really professional. During the meal I was having a private conversation with my dining partner, at the end of the meal the server at the register asked us some specific questions regarding our previous conversation which meant they were eavesdropping in on the entire thing, not really a big issue but kinda made us feel uneasy.- not to mention when we walked to the register to pay one of the employees mentioned that they could not help us and had to pull someone else out of the back which took even more time. I am pretty confident that this place is small family business which isn't a problem in itself, but seemed highly disorganized that someone would rudely tell us to wait while the only person who can help is walking away to do some other job.

After another 5 to 10 minutes, we had to get another server, who simply turned around to get the jug of broth and pour it into the pot. The jug was literally right behind them on a counter. For some unexplained reason, the original server could not do a 180 turn and do it for us. I could have done it myself if I knew it was there.\\n\\nThe food was actually not bad once it did arrive.

We aren't big fans of most breaded fried foods and we missed that the Gobi was just that. So it isn't something we would order again, but it was a new dish for us and the flavors were very interesting so we still enjoyed it.\\n\\nFor an entre I had the Madras (Chennai) with tofu and asked for it spicy. This was  a creamy dish with lots of heat. My wife had the AjwaniI Salmon Tikka. It too was very good with an interesting blend of spices.\\n\\nThe serving sizes were typical so there was food for leftovers for lunch the next day.\\n\\nWhile we waited for our check, the owner who was tending bar that was next to our table, said hello.

IE I wanted to get drunk, and I wanted to do it for either cheap or free. So after spending a few hours researching I had narrowed it down to breakfast for dinner at Denny's because they\\"d give me a free grand slam or Yale town because they advertise a fee t-shirt, free shot, and free dessert. \\n\\nSo i pick up the phone and call down to Yaletown brew pub thinking it was too good to be true. I explained to the girl on the phone that it was just myself and my sister and she said no problem. Come on down and we'll treat you great, its your birthday after all. \\n\\nI couldn't wait for 5 O'clock to come! Its my birthday, I'm pumped. ha. and that ha is more of a derivative snort.\\n\\nWhen i got to the restaurant there were 4 waiters/waitresses standing around chatting with the hostess. I explain to them that its my birthday. I wait for the happy birthday to ensue. NOTHING. 5 people not one of them shows any inclination that they give a rats butt. So I tell them I spoke to someone earlier and she said if I came down I got all this stuff. The hostess says to me 'well tell that to your server\\" and then directs us into the pub side, even though we stated we wanted the other side because we were going to be eating.\\n\\nWhen the waitress comes to us we again explain its my birthday. She says \\"so are you ordering a drink?\\" Again no \\"happy birthday.\\" i mean to me it seems pretty self explanatory if you want a tip to say it whether you care or not. \\n\\nIf only that was the end of the store, but no there is more. We order our drinks and when she comes back my sister makes a point of asking if I get anything and the girl says \\"No, just a happy birthday\\" still not even DIRECTLY saying happy birthday. Then she walks away.\\n\\nFine. whatever. I get at this point I'm not getting any special treatment on my birthday. I'm wishing i had gone to Denny's and not Yaletown.

Does she stop to ask if we want another drink? no. does she completely ignore us and pretend we aren't there? yes. So after sitting there for 40 minutes feeling pretty rejected, 10 minutes of which our glasses are completely empty and signaling to get her attention with no response she comes wandering over. \\n\\nand this is where the s**t hits the fan for me. This is where i get totally mad and just give up.\\n\\n\\"do you want the bill split up or all together?\\"\\n\\nAre you serious??? She didn't check in once, and she didn't ask if we wanted anything else. \\n\\non a normal day I can put up with that but on MY birthday?

Our waitress was excellent, to the point my husband and I both made comments during and after the meal about how attentive and helpful she was. Considering it was our first experience with this brand of Chicago style pizza, the waitress took the time to explain the portion-size and the best way to share a pizza. We ended up with the honey-mustard chicken salad and the Original UNO pizza in the personal portion size. The amount of food was perfect for two people splitting and the server threw in an extra breadstick with the salad so we would have two. She even gave us coupons for our next visit. Since then, we have ordered to-go about once a month. If you use the 'Pick-2' menu, you can get two individual sized pizzas for the price of one. They also have take-out specials where if you buy one pizza you get another for $5. They always run coupons so sign up for the mailing list and check your junk every once in a while. We never pay full-price for our food. Sometimes the take-out isn't quite the same quality as in the restaurant (i.e. no breadsticks with the salad one time) but still very good for restaurant take-out.

Husband decided on the dancing eel roll, and ordered an extra tuna roll. We washed it down with a bottle of cold sake - the large one - and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The quality of the sashimi is the higher than the fish served in the rolls--definitely on a par with Nickiemoto's. Good, not great. A worthy three star sushi bar.

The chicken was thoroughly marinated and spices did reach to the innermost core of the meat. It won't be far-fetched to say that their tandoori chicken was by far the best I've had in US. The chicken bhartha also good, finely grated and well prepared.   Their prices are the best as they can ever get, no doubt the restaurant was amongst best 20 under 20$ in Boston.

There weren't any paper towels in the bathroom, as if they hadn't thought of that yet.  I like this place despite the service and oversights.  We went there for brunch on Sunday and it just seemed like they were caught off guard by how much business they had.  My bloody mary was one of the best bloody marys I've ever had, and my lamb shoulder and eggs (served like steak and eggs, only with lamb) was really great.  The coffee was good, but it came out a bit cold because of the backlog of stuff to be brought out by the server.\\n\\nReally great place and I hope they do well, but the staffing issue is going to have to get fixed. \\n\\nOh, don't go there with any special requests because the chef either doesn't care or doesn't have the ability to make changes on the fly; it's coming out the way it comes out.  I was with a lactose intolerant friend and another friend with an allergy to onions and garlic, but there was no way to modify anything.  At least that's the way the server made us feel.\\n\\nIt took about two hours from the time we walked in to the time we left with a solid hour:15 of waiting for various things wondering if we'd been forgotten.

So we went down to The Oasis. \\n\\n~SERVICE~\\n* The greeter was really friendly and welcomed us nicely\\n* We were told that a table for 5 would be at least a thirty minute wait, but, like amusement parks, the wait was shorter and turned out to be 5 minutes\\n* Our waiter, Moe, was nice enough but seemed pretty tired\\n* The guy who brought out our food with Moe was really gruff and not nice at all\\n* The food came at a good time; not too early, not too late\\n| 3 stars |\\n\\n~ATMOSPHERE~\\n* This place is fun\\n* It reminds me of an amusement park restaurant (not sure if that's good or bad, though)\\n* It is very loud and surprisingly dark once the sun sets\\n* People are noticeably drunk; not in-your-face drunk, more playful\\n| 4 stars |\\n\\n~FACILITY~\\n* It definitely isn't In-N-Out regarding cleanliness\\n* There were forks and pieces of chips littering the ground around the tables\\n* Great view, but you can only see it well if you go out to the balcony, which is quite crowded\\n* Great decorations and building\\n| 4.5 stars |\\n\\n~FOOD~\\n* First of all, my siblings were there and had the kids menus, which weren't very creative (see pictures)\\n* The regular menu has about 20 entrees, none of which are super original\\n* We had just regular chips and salsa. Let me just say that the chips honestly seemed like they warmed up a bag of Tostitos and dumped it in a basket\\n* The salsa was good, although I couldn't tell how real it was. It tasted roasted, which personally I like\\n* I got the chipotle ribs. They had good flavor, although they were massively overdone or something. The bark was too thick, the meat was near impossible to get off the bone, and personally I would have enjoyed a steak knife to break them apart. They came with coleslaw, which was mediocre, and sweet potato fries that were drizzled with honey\\n| 2 stars |\\n\\n~DRINK~\\n* You have to ask for water\\n* My mom got a pi√±a colada and said it was good, but way too sweet\\n* My siblings got Shirley Temples, which had barely any grenadine in them\\n* Every single drink came in these dumb plastic cups. Even my mom's pi√±a colada came in a smaller plastic cup. At a restaurant, I want to drink from a glass\\n| 2.5 stars |\\n\\n~PRICE~\\n* Way too overpriced. I think they increased the prices since the other reviewers were here, too\\n* $9 for guacamole OR qu√©so is way too much\\n| 0 stars |\\n\\n~VERDICT~\\nAll in all, I think that everyone should come here at least once because it's a staple of Lake Travis. Yes, the views are nice, but you'll get an even better one (and better everything), if you go upstairs to the Tavern. And if you want to get away from the crowds, then go a few miles down the shore to Rough Hollow's club restaurant. It has free valet parking, too; it's view is almost as nice as The Oasis. This whole experience really gave me a Disneyland vibe: long lines, a million tables, tired staff, subpar food, and royally expensive.

The sweet potato and the Venezuelan plantains are particularly great.\\n\\nThe quality is lacking sometimes--the sandwiches are served in pitas and almost every single time I get one, there is mayonaise PILED at the bottom of the pita, so the last 1/3 of the sandwich is usually inedible.\\n\\nMy biggest issue with Clover is that they don't allow any changes to their food. I once tried to order a sandwich without the mayo and they refused to serve it to me--the guy at the desk said that their  sandwiches are designed to be served only the way they are originally made and they don't allow any changes--I found this ridiculous because I wasn't even asking for a substitution, just an omission.

We were told there was a parking lot a block away but it cost us $40 because there was also a Bruins game that evening.\\n\\nSecond, the restaurant advertised that they accept credit cards but they only accept cash for bar purchases and told me that they had an ATM upstairs for my convenience. I was able to pay for the cocktails and wine that I had with dinner with a credit card so I left confused about the difference in policies within the same restaurant.

Located in Baldwin Park, Seito Sushi is a modern, upscale restaurant that still has very affordable rolls and specialty rolls of sushi, along with bento boxes and all of the staple Japanese foods as well (chicken teriyaki, etc). We decided to go with the fanciest roll on the menu, the Distinguished Gentleman, as well as a classic Salmon & Cream Cheese roll. Our food was delicious, and honestly the sushi was light enough that it really made me want to try one of the desserts, which included red bean or green tea ice cream, or even tempura ice cream. The other thing I enjoyed while dining here was the good service. Our waitress was patient when it took us a while to decide on which rolls we wanted to try, and got us anything we needed right away. \\n\\n\\nMy one word to the wise, however, would be to either arrive to Seito Sushi early or even make a reservation in advance because typically (especially on a Friday or Saturday night) there is usually a wait for a table, even if it is just a ten-fifteen minute wait. Although there are outside dining tables in addition to inside tables, we all know that the way the weather is in Orlando, eating outside typically isn't the best choice. Also, the parking situation in downtown Baldwin Park can be less than ideal, with parallel street parking (hint: drive around the corner and look for the open parking lot area in the back of Baldwin park). \\n\\nBut all in all, I definitely think that my partner in crime and I concur on the fact that we will definitely be dining at Seito Sushi again in the near future.

But the only reason I noticed this is because our group had to be split into 2 separate tables and no darker-toned person was served until ALL lighter-toned were. \\n\\nI thought about pulling out the racist card, but then again the service was equally awful for everyone."},{"name":"3 Country Bistro","address":"379 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"4.5","text":"First time trying this place and we had a great experience.\\n\\nIt was a small place with only a few tables.

We got seated fast but it took a little while to get the menu cause they were busy running around and bring dishes out of kitchen. \\n\\nThe girl who served us is very nice and the food came pretty fast after wen placed the order.\\n\\nWe went to a brewing company before dinner, and this place doesn't have any liquor and you need to bring your own alcohol which is fantastic news for us. They provided glasses and we were drinking our own beers there. \\n\\nOur family love all types of food. It is good we can actually choose from Japanese Korean and Thai food. The price are reasonable and the dishes are better than expected. I personally loved the sashimi and the seafood madness we ordered today. \\n\\nAfter we got there there came more people and people start to wait in line right by the door, the host told us, it is always good to make an appointment since it is a small place.\\nAnyway it is cozy and just feel like you are eating in a friend's house.

We finished with a serving of the apple and green chile pie, which had just the right undertone of green chile flavor. And who wouldn't love the idea of coin-style margs on tap?

You could definitely spend an evening there by going to dinner, a show at Cirque, bowling, or a music event at House of Blues, and topping the evening off at a bar. However, it was a bit too touristy for me. \\n\\nThe parking was pretty accessible, however, have some idea of where you are going if you are going to one specific place so you know what entrance to park at. It is organized in a manner that prevents overcrowding which is nice, since this tends to be a huge tourist trap. \\n\\nIf you are looking for Disney-esque shopping, DD has you covered. We did not buy some gifts that we needed while in the parks, so we were able to do that at DD before leaving Florida. \\n\\nIf you have time, go to DD.

There is only a hint of chili oil at the bottom of the bowl.  \\n\\nEntrees: \\nDan Dan Noodles: Good, but by definition not Dan Dan Noodles.  The mushroom puree and the egg play together to create a silky sauce, the tofu is done well, and the chili relish is non-existent.  The problem is that there is no chili oil, the one ingredient all recipes for dan dan noodles include.  I know, I spent an hour researching this today.  From now on I shall call these Bob Bob Noodles, and perhaps I will like them more.  \\n\\nBrisket Fried Rice: OMG, really the best thing I have put in my mouth this year.

But if you're like, say, over 22, not entirely wasted, and not looking to contract any sort of STD or get arrested, I'd recommend steering clear.\\n\\nPros: \\n\\n- There was a free shuttle from most I-drive hotels, so if you had a sufficient number of drinks to maintain your sanity while there, you don't have to worry about driving back to your hotel.\\n- Shuttle driver was friendly, in a manic sort of way.\\n- The bellhop at our hotel gave us two free drink coupons (see above), but it's only good for limited beer and \\"house special\\" drinks.\\n- Servers were friendly (albeit in a forced, \\"we're made to pretend we're your friend\\" kind of way)\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n(Oh, where do I begin...)\\n\\n- Unbelievably loud. There's a DJ, who for some reason only plays a part of every song. Periodically, a band plays, which was really, really bad. I can only assume the singer was the manager's girlfriend or something. Forget about having any sort of normal conversation. Or any sort of conversation, period. We had to resort to pointing at our menus to let the waiter know what we wanted to order, and actually wrote notes to each other on our napkins.\\n- \\"Large\\" beers (and I'm assuming other drinks, too) come in silly, really tall plastic cups with whistles and plastic beads in the bottom (although our 10 year old was entertained for a while by trying to blow the whistle loud enough to be heard.)\\n- Drinks are very weak, and you really need them to be stronger...\\n- The floor was so soaked in beer (and God only knows what else) that one of my shoes actually stuck to it at one point, and I had to reach down with my hand to pry it off the floor.\\n- There are friendly signs in the ladies' room reminding patrons that it is, in fact, illegal to deal drugs or other contraband at Se√±or Frogs, and that doing so MAY result in you being asked to leave.\\n- Food took a REALLY long time to arrive (my assumption is that they wanted you to drink more, but I could be wrong, but I'm probably not.)\\n- The first time our food arrived, the waiter dropped it all on the floor, so we had to wait an even longer time.\\n- Oh yeah, the food. Pretty bad. Well, we ordered queso dip, which wasn't terrible, but pretty bland (think of the Velveeta \\"queso\\" dip that someone always brings to a Superbowl party.) I got chicken soft tacos, which were kibbles of cooked chicken-ish meat in a flour tortilla. Sour cream and a green, guacamole-ish substance were served on the side. I ate one before the boiled-meat texture of the tortillas got too nasty for me. Daughter 1 got cheese quesadilla, which she ate, because quesadillas are pretty hard to screw up. Daughter 2 got tortilla soup, which she ate, because she's 10. Husband got \\"mexican\\" sampler, which he didn't really eat, 'cause it was pretty nasty, and we had almost lost our minds by the time our food showed up anyway.\\n\\nThings I personally see as \\"cons\\", but you may view as \\"pros\\", depending on who you are and where you are in your life's journey:\\n\\n- There're two guys roaming around making silly hats out of balloons for people.\\n- The DJ seems happy to encourage people to stand up on their chairs and dance like imbeciles.\\n- There are scantily clad girls with low self-esteem selling shots out of test tubes, which are periodically announced as \\"2-4-1\\" by the DJ.\\n\\n10 year old suggested we spend the rest of the evening aiming spitballs at the bellhop who suggested this hole to us when we got back to the hotel. While I wasn't entirely against the idea, I REALLY needed a decent drink by that point, so we headed to the hotel pool bar to try and wash away the memory of Se√±or Frog's.\\n\\nLong and short of it: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON'T GO TO SENOR FROG'S"},{"name":"VO2 Vegan Cafe","address":"1001 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this place.

My one experience was positive and I will be visiting again.\\n\\nMy wife and I walked The Domain with the goal of trying out Kona Grill.  Upon first entrance, modern yuppy explosion of style is there to greet you including the hostess that is wearing a dress from on of the high end cloths store (real or knockoff, not my area of experience), a sushi bar complete with Japanese headband wearing sushi chefs and a large fish tank.\\n\\nThe tables are well lit but still give you a sense of privacy.  Plenty of room to boot.  Of course service can be hit or miss but this day was a hit.  Our waitress was very pleasant and fast.\\n\\nStarted off with an appetizer of calamari which was a little over breaded but the combination of seasoning made it very tasty.  Not sure if I have had chili powder on calamari before.  Tasty but possibly a flavor of a lazy chef.\\n\\nA short wait later, my wife had the Hawaiian pizza which was fantastic.  All fresh ingredients and a masterfully done crust.  I was boring and went with the Kona burger.  The shoe string fries were perfectly cooked as to be crisp.  The burger was large enough for any appetite but when asked for medium rare, I was given a medium burger.  Still, the flavor of coming off a char grill made up for the transgression. \\n\\nMy Sunset drink was excellent and potent enough (I have yet to find a place that yet makes a reasonable priced strong drink).  The ice tea was a little over brewed but passable.  My wife asked for a drink not on the menu because Kona Grill advertises a full bar, Mexican Coffee which is coffee with amaretto and frangelico.  Turns out, frangelico not as common as we thought, Kona Grill did not have it.\\n\\nPricing is what one would expect at a place like this in The Domain.

The ricotta filling was ever so slightly sweet, very rich, and delicious.  A winner overall.  I have to eat this the moment I leave the store next time.

I think they were both delicious/better off with plain shoyu.  The Sexy Roll was highly recommended by their hostess and it was indeed delicious and definitely a great choice for those on a low-carb diet as it's made without rice.  The hotate, ikura, hamachi, and hirame nigiri sushi were great.  The fish was fresh and the salmon roe was the kind I prefer (red pearl).

Don't get me wrong, I know all restaurants have to prep, but my French toast had clearly been fried earlier in the day and then refried. The grease in the cornflake crust also had the taste of reused fat (butter, oil, I don't know).  Kind of like mcmenamins tater tots. I know plenty of people like their prefried refried previously frozen tots so maybe I'm sensitive on this.

Uniqlo, Zara, and Anthropologie are staple clothing stores but they are all spaced out and you have to walk pretty far to get to each. \\n\\nOther than maybe the Disney store, there's no store that offers anything unique or local that I HAVE to get in Orlando.

The specials for the day are always amazing and well worth the $25+ you'll spend on each dish. Most of the days of the week you will find a wait of 30-45 minutes unless you get there closer to 10pm. Waiting can be a pain depending on how full the bar area is, which is fairly narrow. If you can, belly up to the bar and ask the bartenders for suggestions on wines, usually they let you taste many different ones before deciding on a glass.bottle (one bartender was voted best bartender in Austin for 2006 so they know their stuff). Ordering an appetizer while waiting has always the time go by faster, especially the tuna tar tar. Once seated, you will notice that the acoustics are not the best; it can get fairly loud of you are in the main center room where you can see all the chefs cooking. When you finally see the menu, take a look at the specials page and take time to notice which ones are sold out. If the risotto is out, which many times it is, be sad because it is amazing. Additionally as savory is the seafood mixed grill, which has been different every time I have been there. Anything with prawns has proven to be wonderful as well as the beans and vegetables picked directly from the garden behind the building. If you are looking for something off the regular menu, I would recommend the Pomodoro, although I think they use a bit too much oil in making it (still fabulous though). I usually skip dessert, but the few times I have eaten it there, the trio of chocolate has been delectable. A few additional notes would be that 1) the service is wonderful and the waitstaff very helpful. 2) If you can sit in one of the 'side' rooms, do so. 3) After your meal, walk around South Congress if you can. 4) Beware of First Thursdays if you go, you will not be able to find parking anywhere."},{"name":"Shabusen Yakiniku House","address":"755 Burrard Street, Suite 202","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Yelp, you have led me astray.

They were out of at least 4 beers on the draft menu (completely unacceptable for a brewery) and also, the charcuterie board had a TON of some kind of weird pickled vegetable that we couldn't even figure out what it was.

It's across from the old Gold's Gym and near the IH-35 feeder road.  I was in the general area and had recently read that it was now open, so I popped in for lunch.  \\n\\nI asked to start with the ceviche mixto ($15) because this is how I mainly judge Peruvian restaurants.  They have lunch specials for $7.99 that include your meat of choice with rice and a soup or salad.  I chose the adobo limeno and the sopa de pollo.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I was sad when they brought everything out at once.  I really prefer things in courses, but I was too hungry to discuss so I dove right into the ceviche.  THIS is what my Peruvian dreams are made of!  The super fresh fish, squid and shrimp were perfectly balanced with the citrus lime and a touch of heat from a jalapeno.  I could truly eat this everyday.  It was accompanied with toasted corn (think corn nuts) and hominy.  They provided some texture as I was chomping away.\\n\\nThe sopa de pollo was hearty all on its own.  A chicken thigh swimming in delicious broth, carrots and a mix of macaroni and penne noodles.  It was a tad bit oily, but it did not deter me from finishing most of the bowl.  It did not need any additional salt or pepper, which is unusual for me as I am more often than not adding pepper to almost everything I eat.\\n\\nThe adobo limeno is Citrus-marinated pork and sliced sweet potato in a delicate stew and is served with steamed garlic rice.  The pork was a tad bit dry but when i asked for a bit more of the adobo sauce, it fixed it all up very well.The sweet potato was a nice touch as it added a tiny element of sweetness to this otherwise savory dish. And the rice was perfectly steamed and garlicky.\\n\\nThe owner Susana is an absolute doll and I want nothing more than for her to succeed.  I will be running back for ceviche all the time as this is close to my house and I am so happy that more flavorful food is in close proximity.  I hear that the pisco sours are amazing and that there is salsa dancing on some evenings.

The flavors meld and link all together into that perfect bite .. especially when you eat that potato because you get that salt and pepper spice plus a dense texture to offset the lightness of the egg.

I wasn't sure if that was a jab or not, but what was true it was great selection for us.  A little more about the wine in second.  It was about 10 mins, and we were able to sit at the bar... GREAT!\\n\\nFor the appetizer we ordered the fresh Mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes and basil... No salmonella here, just truly fresh flavors and wonderfully presented.  The fresh basil tasted like they had chopped it right out of their garden a minute before serving it to us.  Small little green ribbon bits of flav o flav.\\n\\nI chose the Seafood Stew, and Suzie M ordered the Veal Ziti.  Again, great suggestions from our French Dude.  Now back to the wine.  We were seated at the bar, and in front of us were two bottles, in chrome coolers.  The bar was busy, and the bartenders were very attentive to serving our wine.  I finished my second glass and decided to help myself to what I thought was our bottle....there was about a glass left, so I just filled up my glass, turned the bottle upside down and put it back into the chrome cooler.  When Suzie M finished her glass, French Dude asked her if she wanted more, and I thought well perhaps another bottle since I had just drained it?.. however, it was then I realized when the French Dude, grabbed the other bottle to pour her a glass, that I had emptied a bottle of wine which belonged to a couple which was waiting for a table behind us... Dohh... French Dude looked at me, I looked at him, red faced, I told him, I just emptied the wrong bottle into my glass about 5 minutes ago.. we laughed, he said not a problem, went to the cooler and grabbed another bottle and served the couple behind us, and asked them if they wanted another bottle, they declined, and he saved the day.. didn't charge me for the \\"twit of the moment\\" event... +1 star for that!  Their bottle was $20 more than ours, and I liked our's much better.. great choice!\\n\\nMy seafood stew was chock full of goodness.  6 Mussels, 5 Clams, two huge 20ct shrimps and halibut mixed with a wonderful tomato broth, and two foot long brochette to sop up the broth with... perfection.. Suzie M's Veal Ziti was a perfect combination of spice, texture and sauce... we finished it later in the evening when we got home..\\n\\nWe have been to Vespaio's on many occasions, but I don't like to Yelp anything we haven't visited recently.. We almost always sit at the bar, so we can meet new folks, and laugh with our French Dude behind the bar... The food is always top notch and the atmosphere laid back...An Austin Gem.."},{"name":"Topgolf","address":"9295 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Look at this place.

The sales staff was so helpful in making arrangements for our and our guests' stays,  in setting everything up for the rehearsal, and in arranging shuttles to day activities (hair and make-up at a local spa) and for the bridal party to get to the venue.  We hired an outside limo company to do take guests to and from the wedding because we needed larger shuttles.  The limo company forgot to send a shuttle at the end of the evening, and we could not reach them, so at 11:45 pm, we called the hotel to ask if they could come and get us - 35 minute drive from the hotel.  They quickly sent two shuttles to pick up the 28 stranded guests and wedding party.  The hotel staff was so accommodating, helpful, responsive and courteous.  In addition, the rooms are clean and nice, and the outside courtyard is a great place to hang out, and there are some nice/fun places to go in the hotel to gather - music, cigar bar, restaurant.

I am Gluten Free, my dining companions on both occasions were not. These are the impressions from both sides of the allergy table.\\n\\nLunch:\\nWhen you go to order a sandwich for lunch, you should never be told it isn't enough to satisfy a regular person, period. When the sandwich arrives, it shouldn't be on some supermarket potato roll. Finally, if you're going to make a lamb sandwich, you should let people know it's pulled lamb, smothered in sauce, and just tastes like pork; totally defeats the purpose of ordering lamb.\\n\\nI had trouble with lunch, because, as the bartender informed me, they basically use wheat fillers in everything. It is SO EASY to make many of their items gluten free, but they just don't want to make the effort. I did have the Tuna Poke, which is GF, but the flavors are so horribly balanced, and the saltiness so over the top, that even my husband wouldn't try a second bite! I ate because I was starving, and my other option was basically not eating, but I should've just skipped it.\\n\\nDinner:\\nDinner with women and small plates is a no brainer, it makes everything so easy, except here. Again, we encountered that fillers and random ingredients made most menu items not edible for me, so we split and my friend got some of the regular stuff for herself. This bartender was kind and apologetic, but was like, this isn't the place for you. I don't get that, not when there are easy adjustments that could permanently make the menu more friendly, but why be friendly, I should only ever eat at home, right? How a rice dish ends up with a wheat filler should cause everyone to ask what's being put in their food. Never mind the fact that the plates are so small that you end up spending the same as if you were eating down the street at Craigie, but Craigie has way better food, amazing service, and has the best approach to food allergies at any place other than a Ming Tsai restaurant.\\n\\nFinally, on the drink front...wine list was mediocre.

Then Chloe says to me what tequila do you want, I am thinking okay you get a choice of tequila because she did not say it was extra, so I told her cuervo gold, and a glass of water.  10 minutes later my mexican martini shows up, then it takes another 30 minutes to get her attention,Still no glass of water. I am being treated like I don't tip or something,Chloe, Just want you to know, I always tip 20%  but not to you, it was frustrating, I even told her I was celebrating. my birthday.   Finally she shows up again I order queso and chips with and addition of guacamole which is on a $2.99 up charge to add..  One of the guys from the band decided to buy me dinner also, and for himself. As the night started to come to an end, Chloe brings me a check for nearly $27. and explains to me that she messed up the checks and even though the check she is giving me is the same amount except for .13 cents.  I was confused as she ran off.  So, I went inside to the bar to get a breakdown and correct check the amount seemed like 7 or 8 dollars off, or too much.  The bartender gives me a correct breakdown, where I found out I was charged for the tequila $3. for the upgrade. without being told it was extra, I was also charged for a full order $6.99 of guacamole, as though I had ordered only guacamole and chips and then queso and chips, for $6.99 another 4 dollar upcharge and not what I asked for. and why didn't she tell me the tequila was extra when she offered it to me then the waitress comes over to the table and throws the correct ticket at me, and walks off, my friend said is it right and I bent over to show it to her and all of a sudden Chloe's head had came between us from out of nowhere and angrily she said is there a problem.She scared the cap out of me. OMG!.  Then in a rage she grabs my chips and dips and food which we hardly touched and where going to take home and she slams them into a bin, Before we could say anything and she did not even ask if we wanted to take it, ad she didn't care either.I felt like I was under attack. Not only did my bill get padded without my permission or knowledge of the upcharges, but I  never got to eat my food and I was treated so cruelly on my Birthday, by this waitress Chloe. Not to mention we walked up to talk to the band and one of the band guys left his t g food on the table and our purses where there also, when we turned around and looked she had already ran off with the drummers food creating more confusion.

But, like all other popular tourist spots, you brace yourself for a potentially long line and trust the process. And Mike's is **cash only**, so prepare accordingly (and it's better to overshoot than to regret not having enough $)\\n\\nMike's Pastry is no-frills, with something of a historical vibe. You can imagine that the store hasn't changed too dramatically since it opened in 1946. The cannolis, lobster tails (note this is a pastry), and other goodies are laid out in display cases. All the options are also showcased in photos surrounding the shop. If you come with a group, I suggest you take turns looking at the pastry cases so you're ready to order when it comes your turn. They are no-nonsense and the line moves quickly, so don't be that person holding everyone up.\\n\\nEverything looks so good and it's exceedingly difficult to choose one cannoli, but I don't think you can go wrong. I got the amaretto cannoli thinking it would be laced with Amaretto, but it was non-alcoholic and they probably just meant almond. \\n\\nIn any case, it was heavenly: the pastry shell was half crisp and half soft, and sinks into the luscious creamy filling. The ricotta has a beautifully fluffy whipped texture and isn't too heavy or sweet, so even though the cannoli looks big it is quite manageable. Interestingly, the experience changes throughout. You are first greeted with one of the fanned ends, featuring a mouthful of ricotta filling and the toppings, tapered to a more pastry-focused center, and returning to the other indulgent end. \\n\\nTip: Seating can be hard to come by, and the way the cannolis are individually wrapped may require some manipulation for your Insta-perfect shot."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Huge fan of the cannolis here but the other pastries are just as great too.

The seared ahi tuna salad however was not at all what the menu had described. The tuna was supposed to be on a bed of salad greens with some sort of dressing but it came with 5-6 pieces of seared tuna with only some brussel sprouts on the top.

My nigiri tasted almost exactly like it does at every sushi place from Columbus to the West Coast to Tokyo, which is to say, good.

Heh, brilliant marketing!\\n\\nA few key things to note:\\n\\nAvoid \\"Pleasure Island\\".  Although it no longer cost extra to get in, it's still a dark and lonely \\"dead zone\\" in the middle of Downtown Disney.

The fish is fresh and not too expensive, meaning that we have the ability to house a lot of good sushi places. Sushi garden is a place that I now use as a standard when going to these other places. At Sushi garden, the price is reasonable, they serve you and the food quickly, and the selection on their menu is more than enough to serve your needs. This is all that's important to a sushi restaurant you can trust and constantly come back to. \\n\\nBecause of those reason, we constantly order take out from here. If the family doesn't want to cook or if a party is happening at home, this is the place.

The salad was really good although it could have used a little more steak especially for $18.  The tacos were OK although the pork belly was really not crispy.  Flavor was average.\\nI will admit I am not really a fan of mexican food.  However I do think I know flavor.  The fajita steak is very good without a doubt.  Very tender and great flavor.  The table next to us had a full order of steak fajitas which looked great.  I checked the menu and a full order is $24. A little pricey but the wife and I might split that next time.\\nAll in all Superica is in a great location but has a little work to do.

The sriracha sauce on the top changed the taste completely!\\n\\n\\nI've been to Seito a few times. I've had mixed experiences both with food and also staff. Here's a summary of my experience. \\n\\n- Food: 4/5 lets be honest, their food is good. Sushi is great. I've always enjoyed the food. Been here both for dinner and lunch. The reason I'm not giving it a 5 star is the salad that's served with lunch as well as their spring roll. The spring roll was soooooo greasy that the oil was dripping off my roll. I ended up not eating it. Last time I tried the salad with my lunch order, the lettuce was not fresh. So overall 4/5 is fair to me.\\n\\n- Staff: 3/5 some are super nice and some are not. In particular one waiter( I think his name was Timmy) was not friendly and didn't seem helpful when asking his opinion on what to order. \\n\\n- late night happy hour: 1/5 \\nI would call this a late night sad hour. I went last Friday night. It felt like eating in the middle of a club while a bunch of drunk people dance around you. But regardless of the atmosphere, the menus was so limited. There was no sushi roll in the menu. The online wine on happy hour menu was the house wine which is $6. What is a house wine? Is it the cheapest that is $6 in the regular menus too? I order the highball for $8. Didn't seem like a good deal. Just go to Osprey Tavern and you'll see what is a great cocktail in the happy hour menu. The skewer was each $3. They were so tiny that I ended up ordering four of them which came out $12 and it didn't even taste great. What kind of happy hour is that? The only good option was the eel fried rice. \\n\\nI really wanna give this a better rating but I think 2/5 is what matches my experience."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"People love cannolis, but to be honest I'm not a huge fan of cannolis in general.

The tall female bartender at night is a tad less social but she's amazing and attentive as well. \\nI've been going here for years and not because of the atmosphere (which tends to be a little bit like a college food hall) but because of the bar staff and the food.

They have a decent beer selection (one of the best around) which is frequently changing and they are nice and cold. The prices are reasonable and the food portions are perfect. I also like the way the bar is set up. It is in the shape of a square so you get to see everyone at the bar and the bartenders are sort of stuffed in center leaving more room for seats (the way a good bar should be). They have TV's but they are kind of tucked away which I also like. Having the TV's out of sight encourages you to look around the bar at the other patrons and allows for the opportunity to engage people in conversation.

We sat down and was greeted by our server who was also running the bar and she handed us menus. We began looking through the menus and realized our menus were completely different which was extremely confusing and apparently they had updated some of the menus but not all of them? ANYWAYS. We figured out what we wanted & ordered.\\n\\nWe ordered the beef miso ramen, chicken yakisoba, 3 salmon and 3 tuna nigiri, and the Ren sushi roll. The food was awesome! The chicken yakisoba was extremely flavorable and the noodles were to die for. The beef in the ramen was kind of dry but it was still pretty damn good. The sushi was pretty average but they had a wide range of selection. \\n\\nAfter we ate we decided to try out the juice and smoothie bar, I still think they could step their juice game up if they are going to cater to that kind of cliental. I got a thai tea bubble tea and it was a delicious way to end the dinner. \\n\\nWhen we asked for the check it wasn't even 30 bucks between the two of us....AWESOME. It was really good food for super cheap!! \\n\\nThe environment was kinda slow and our service wasn't great. I had to walk to the bar and get water refills myself instead of her bringing it to the table, and same goes for the check BUT all in all I'd definitely go back....well more like order it for delivery!\\n\\n\\nEdit: since this review we've ordered from this place and it's still awesome.

So I had been sitting there for 35 minutes without seeing a server at our table. I went to the host stand and she re-seated us (I'm not sure why she just didn't get another server to take over that table since clearly the server that had the table didn't care). Once we were re-seated a friendly young man took our order and of course I asked to speak to the manager. The manager came over and apologized and offered to discount our meal.\\nThe food: I ordered sushi and my guest ordered steak (I'm not sure of the specifics of his meal). My sushi was below subpar. I have tasted fresher sushi at Rusans. My guest's steak was \\"blah,\\" and was not seasoned properly and overcooked.

Ten minutes later I'm standing outside my room on the 16th floor gazing upon downtown listening to the sounds of the city. The rooms are on par with the price tag of $200. \\n\\nAfter spending a few hours downtown, we ended up at the bar a few minutes before midnight. Our Irish Coffees were the last drinks served out the bar that night.

So, his birthday rolled around and I volunteered to take him to Bricktop's to celebrate. I thought I'd get off cheaply, which is important as I am unemployed right now.\\n\\nLocated in the Terminus building and run by the same folks who brought us Houston's, Bricktop's seems very similar. It is a little brighter inside than a Houston's but the decor is about the same and the clientele seem about the same as you would find in a Houston's - people conducting business dinners. Or groups of business associates having dinner, but definitely not the scene for young hipsters.\\n\\nI wanted to sample one of their specialty drinks, and having a fondness for vodka gimlet's I decided I'd try theirs. I asked the server how it was and she pointed out that it tastes like a mojito only with vodka instead of rum. Ok, so why don't they just call it that - A vodka mojito, because it has no business having the word gimlet anywhere near it. It was ok, but I don't think worth the 10 bucks I paid for it.\\n\\nOur appetizer of deviled eggs with bacon came out shortly after our drinks. The deviled part of the eggs were a generous portion. The bacon, although not extra crispy as I like, did have a sweetness to it that complimented the eggs well. We devoured the eggs and bacon in what seemed like 5 seconds.\\n\\nTiming was good here. We got our app shortly after our drinks arrived and there was about a 5 minute lag from when our app was taken away before entrees came out. I went for the fish tacos as the fish of the evening was mahi-mahi. Although Bro said he gets the rotisserie chicken every time he comes here, this time he ordered steak. \\n\\nThe tacos had a great flavor to them, I really loved the blackened mahi-mahi, which is probably the best way this fish can be prepared. The tacos come filled with guacamole, slaw, and white cheddar cheese. While the tacos were delicious, I wouldn't recommend getting them on a business meeting or on a first date as they are pretty messy. A couple bites into it and they were completely falling apart.\\n\\nMy brother's steak was cooked medium and very tasty and juicy. He ordered mac n cheese for his side and I ordered creamed spinach for my side. Now, I never thought I'd utter these words, but in relation to the tacos, mac 'n cheese and creamed spinach: TOO MUCH CHEESE. Did I really say that? Yes, the cheese was too overpowering in all of these dishes and detracted from the rest of it. In fact, with the guacamole in the fish tacos, they would have been fine with the cheese left out completely.\\n\\nEven though we were full, we still took a look at the dessert menu. Nothing really jumped out at us. I did inquire as to whether or not they give free desserts on birthdays. Our server said no, but she could put a candle in the center for us. Gee thanks, that's almost the same as getting a dessert for free.\\n\\nThe verdict? Bricktop's is a great dinner spot if you find yourself in Buckhead on business and are craving something conventional. You know you'll find that here. With starters just under $10, entrees are about $20 - $25. Sandwiches and salads are between $10 and $15."},{"name":"Doc's Motorworks","address":"1123 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I was in Austin for a Bachelorette party in the 2nd weekend of ACL and this was our meet-up spot.

The fillet my wife had and the New York strip I had were both filled with veins and tendons. Whomever cooked the steaks has no idea what medium rare is and they both came out almost blue. The potato turnip gratin on their menu is horrible. I don't care how sophisticated your pallet is the gratin is vile. To top things off when Johnny came back with the bill he both probably had 3/4s of our meals left and he took them away. We had thought he went to box them up but never came back. We paid our bill and left but on the way out my wife said something to a hostess about him taking the food. We ended up speaking to a manager who had the dinners re made to go for us. The new steaks were of better quality but the gratin did not improve. If you are looking to spend $150 to $200 for two people at a steakhouse skip this overrated place and run if you get Johnny.

Did not dine in, but rather my artist friend in Denver ordered our dinner and had it delivered.  Magnificent...I was very impressed with the entrees.  Delivered hot, and well-made, and the 4-dessert box was splendid too.  After that I remembered the name Pasquini's, and when a Pasquini's opened in Louisville, closer to home, of course I had to go there.\\n\\nWe've been dining at this Louisville Pasquini's every now and then ever since it opened.  Never was much of a fan of Colacci's...their sauce didn't agree with me.  I know it was much-loved and quite popular.  It's me...my sensitive gut!  \\n\\nPasquini's food agrees with me.  \\n\\nI would prefer regular garlic bread rather than the bread sticks they offer, but it is a minor issue as I'm personally better off not eating bread at all, anyway.  In fact, most Italian food is way too high on the glycemic index for me.  But it's no fun to talk about health issues here, is it?\\n\\nI don't really eat much meat, although I am not a complete vegetarian.  I enjoy their vegetarian lasagne here, and also their eggplant.  For me, how the eggplant parmesan is prepared really defines an Italian restaurant.  Declasse?  Perhaps.  \\n\\nI'm perfectly satisfied with this restaurant, although the part about being popular with kids has changed it over the years.  I love a place that welcomes children and also welcomes them to be themselves.  That is so rare these days other than at Chuck E. Cheese's...\\n\\nBut, sometimes it does feel a bit noisy and chaotic.  That is not a complaint, because the vibrance and aliveness that lots of children bring to a place is a blessing beyond measure.\\n\\nMaybe some day I'll have some grandchildren!  With my children grown,  I rather miss having young ones around...\\n\\nI love hearing that they let children help in the kitchen.  Oh....and...I enjoy their homemade salad dressings and just love it that salad comes with the meal and does not have to be ordered separately at an added cost.  \\n\\nThe purple in the decor is a nice touch.  I find it a welcoming place.  I have had varying experiences with service but I try to go into places without expectations because life goes more smoothly that way.\\n\\nBravo to Pasquini's!!"},{"name":"Buckeye Pho","address":"761 Bethel Rd, Ste E195","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I am a little ashamed to admit that I have been to Buckeye Pho three times over the last two weeks... haha... I drive by the stripmall daily, so I have been keenly watching for its opening and at first sign of its opening, I made a bee line for it.  My first visit was last week during their soft opening - the interior is light, modern-ish, airy and open.  While waiting for my grilled pork bahn mi, the owners chatted with me for a while - what a cute couple they are!  They are super sweet and make every effort to make you feel welcome but not in an akward or pushy way.  On to the food, my bahn mi was excellent!  The bread was toasted and crunchy, the meat was flavorful and veggies crisp, cool with just the right amount of acid and sweetness.  I must admit, I have had better during my recent visit to San Francisco, but as far as Columbus is concerned, it was the best bahn mi I've had!  \\nThe official opening week, cooling air put a wicked spell on me to seek out brothy, fragrant pho.  What perfect opportunity to try pho from well... the Buckeye pho!  I went with well done steak - the soup came with abundant veggies and piping hot broth!  Oh my goodness, the broth was fantastic!  It was wonderfully fragnant and had a delightfully clean finish with lingering spice in the back of my palate... star anise? and maybe a little bit of cinnamon?  Don't know, don't care what that was, but I was hooked!  The only thing that put a slight damper on my experience was the steak... I'm not sure which part of the animal it came from, but it had a good sized blood vessel coursing through the middle of every slice that provided a bit of a gamey flavor that I didn't really care for.  My next visit, I went with pho with meat balls and they were fantastic!  I will have to try pho with rare steaks next time!  Oh, I also saw and smelled beef stew in the works in the kitchen and that's on my list of stuff to try very soon!  What I like about Buckeye Pho is that they give you an option of ordering 3 different sizes of soup - small, large and jumbo, ranging in price from $7 to $10.  So I can order only what I can manage to eat.  Bhan mi ranges in price from $5-6.  As far as comparing this place with other pho restaurants, I think Buckeye pho wins with clean, modern, playful decor, friendly service and flavor profile of the food.  With consistency, Buckeye Pho will get my business any day."},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"As many have described in their reviews, the best way to describe this place is like walking into Willy Wonka that ran into steampunk. I love the theme of this place and they even have a character walking around, greeting the guests, providing a bit of talk entertainment.\\n\\nThe store to the right of the entry has numerous pieces of merchandise from edibles to typical souvenirs. To the left is what I'll call the dessert bar. They serve milkshakes, sundaes, crepes, and ice cream.

I was informed by the cashier it would be 15-20 minutes and as I write this review, it has arrived 25 minutes after the the receipt time. So hopefully you're not in a hurry should you see long lines here.\\n\\nThere are no reservations at this place. So it's a first come first serve. The 2 nights I went here, they were extremely crowded. The first night I actually had dinner here. I didn't want to wait hours just for a table for a party of 1, so I asked if there was a bar available that served food as well. Bingo! Went up to the bar and a few seats were available. The menu is pretty extensive. I finally went with high fashion for my cocktail, totchos for the appetizer, the Tour de France for my entree. The high fashion is one one of their crafted old fashions with Old Forester 86, brandied cherry, and chocolate bitters. It was one of the best old fashions I've had. The totchos is a nacho version using tater tots. The size is very huge and not made for a party of one. It was highly advised in some of the reviews I read, but they were just Ok. They're tossed in nacho cheese with pork belly and a green chili. I could have done without it. Now, the Tour de France burger was really good. A 1/2 pound burger with a fried egg, crispy onions, avocado, brie, lettuce, and roasted tomatoes on a brioche bun. I love my burgers with a good fried egg sunny side up and a juicy burger patty. Cooked to order, this burger was amazing. Full of flavor and not your typical fried egg burger you'll find at Denny's. My server at the bar was great. Provided some great recommendations. Perfect service.\\n\\nThe second night, as I mentioned above, I had a milkshake at the dessert bar. Got me an expresso buzz. The coffee ice cream milkshake was good, I've had better. But it was served in the plastic mason type jar. I could not finish it while at the store and requested for a lid. Well folks, I guess the anticipate that everyone will finish their shake. But this poor unfortunate soul could only finish a third of it. No lids are provided. The best part of the shake was the chocolate coffee beans and the chocolate whipped cream. The whipped cream was nice and thick, very creamy, and a mild chocolate flavor. But this shake took over 25 minutes after the time stamped on the receipt. This is supposed to be quick service. Yeah, not so much. Although the jar cup is such a great idea, but us traveling vacationers have no use for a plastic cup or space to put that in my luggage. So this cup is going straight to the dump. Maybe they should have a greener option for those of us that don't care much about the cup that has no lid, maybe like a cup with a lid. Whoa, what an idea!\\n\\nMore like 3.5 stars.

It would not have been that big of a problem but she was rude and let a group of all men sit across from us but never bothered to tell them their policy. \\nIts a very odd mix of people. Some looked like they were in town for the night and thought this was the hip place to go, lots of men in jeans and button downs and then guys we allowed in with sneakers, shorts or flip flops on. The music was good, drinks were strong and should be because they were on the expensive side but we only stayed for one drink. I would probably never come back here.

If Anna is at the bar you must sit there and listen to whatever she recommends - she's funny, knows her stuff and has great input on what to order.\\n\\nIt's a beautiful restaurant with a great atmosphere.  We didn't have reservations so put our names in for a table and went to get a drink at the bar - some seats opened up and Anna let us know we could order from the full menu there so we decided to stay put just as they called our name for the table (which we cancelled). So glad we did since I'm sure we wouldn't have had as good of a time sitting at the table vs the bar.   \\n\\nWine selection was amazing.  Got a great bottle to have with dinner.  Started off with the charcuterie platter which was a good variety of cheese and meats and pickled veggies and toast points. I was particularly enamored with the duck pat√® in the little dish as well as the pickled pearl onions. \\n\\nSince we were in Austin, I had to get brisket - they serve the fattier meat under a bunch of cuts of the leaner meat.  I should've requested more of the fattier bottom pieces since it was my favorite (and they would do it if requested). \\n\\nIt's family style sides so we all shared the Brussels sprouts (a little underdone) , the collard greens (my favorite of the 3) and Mac n cheese (rich and creamy).  Hubby originally got the lamb ribs.  Anna intimated it wasn't her favorite but he got it anyways - he should've listened to her - it came and it was awful- Anna, however, fixed it for us - she got him the red snapper instead and it was one of the best dishes he's had in his life (his words).  I tasted it and i agree - it was awesome. Red snapper topped with blue crab over a gumbo like rice that had just the right amount of spice that had layers of flavor-soo good.\\n\\nFinished off with 2 decadent desserts that were orgasmically good - a dark chocolate Mexican brownie topped a chocolate sauce with toasted hazelnuts as well as a pistachio empanada.  Both were so good - a great ending to an awesome meal.  \\n\\nOh - get the carbonated Mexican water - it was so much fizzier and tastier than the Italian Pellegrino.

I ordered the fall hash which was supposed to have sweet potatoes, pumkpin, kale and an egg on it, but when my food came there was no kale (which is why i chose that item in the first place). It was basically a pile of sweet potatoes with one fried egg on top--and it cost TEN DOLLARS for some odd reason. When I spend ten dollars on a plate of food, I don't think I should have to use plastic plates and silverware--especially at a place called the Kitchen!

The husband and I still continue to frequent here because it's so close to home. The owners are as charming as ever, and it really is the little touches in service that make us come back. \\nFood wise, after having frequented often we have gotten to see the highs and lows of the food. First the positives: I love the pineapple fried rice even though it doesn't seem like anything much special. It has good flavor and it's a staple on our ticket. \\nThe yellow curry is also good, it has a tiny bit more heat than some places such as Arawan, but the curry is more liquidy. They also have a great peanut sauce. \\nThe cons: If you don't come in early, by the end of the evening the salad rolls are pretty much retired. I have gotten salad rolls on at least three occasions in the evening where the veggies had started to brown and began to taste like refrigerator. \\nI am guessing they were probably made early in the day, so no luck in eating the leftovers of those the next day. \\nThe other big detractor is the shrimp. It's the only seafood I have tried here, so I can't speak to any of the other seafood dishes, but another yelper said it correctly in that it seems to taste \\"a bit off\\". It's the taste like the frozen prawns you buy at a grocery store, forgotten to thaw in the back of your fridge and has developed that faint \\"frozen not so fresh anymore\\" taste. Also, I have on several occasions come across shrimp that were not properly de-veined and that is just  pukeville. The last thing I want to see in my dish is the long black poop-entrails of the creature from it's former life. \\n\\nThat being said, it's still got it's positives so I am sure we will pop in on occasion, just not for the shrimp."},{"name":"Hot Chicken Takeover","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Am I the only one in Columbus that isn't impressed with this place?

We also had some lemon duck soup or something I cant really remember exactly what it was because I was concentrating on my gyoza but i do remember it was also good. I also remember the location was really cool with a neat view, and I remember that the variety of beer they had was good as well, but ya what I mostly remember was the gyoza.

The bright forest glow really allowed this cannoli to stand out and entice the senses. In a bakery like Mike's, where the portions are pretty generous and the ingredients rich with flavor, the sweets can get overwhelming. These savory pistachios act as a great juxtaposition to the sugary overload, and give you the always-sought-after excuse to claim \\"at least there was something healthy in my treat!\\"\\n\\nI can tell you that Mike's Pastry is very good.

The meatloaf was slightly on the dry side, but the side of gravy I ordered helped with that.

After the parks closed my two kids and I decided to get some desserts.  My son got the brownie milkshake, my daughter got the cheesecake milkshake and I got the salted caramel flan sundae.  Based on the desserts alone I'd probably bump the review up to 3 stars, but the place was chaotic and the seating area was kinda gross.  All the customers were crowded near the counter waiting for their orders to be called.  Once we got our order we found a table but most of the unoccupied tables still had half eaten desserts left on them.  We didn't see any staff clearing the tables the whole time we were there...only customer cleaning up after previous customers.  When our desserts came they all looked amazing but we all felt they were pretty average when it came to taste.  My son said his brownie shake tasted \\"artificial\\" and my daughter just said hers \\"wasn't all that.\\"  The flan on my sundae wasn't silky smooth and creamy like most flans I've had but more like a cheesecake.  Based on all the hype around this place we all were expecting to be blown away but instead we were all somewhat disappointed.  My advice is to skip this place (at least for desserts) and head to the Cold Stone across the bridge where the ice cream is better and half the price."},{"name":"Modern Pastry Shop","address":"257 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Wow was my cannoli ever delicious!

Yes they make your mouth go numb and yes they're spices the american palate may not be accustomed to- but they shouldn't be only flavored with numbing peppercorns and oil.

I understand things happen, but they weren't exactly apologetic about it.  Then, we were seated and expected to have great service.  One waiter came up and took our drink orders.  Then a second one came up and explained their specials and had no idea someone had already taken our drink order, so that was a little weird for such a nice restaurant.  All of the wine glasses stayed on the table even though no one ordered wine.  I finally lined them up at the end of the table so we could make room for appetizers and they got the hint.  \\n\\nDrinks: My drink had a funky taste to it like there was a cheap flavored vodka in it.  Another person got a vodka tonic with lime and said the first one was perfect and the second one was awful and just mostly vodka.  Moscow mules were good. It's a little disappointing when you go to such a nice restaurant because you expect the bar tenders to make consistent drinks.  \\n \\nFood: We got 2 appetizers - calamari and ahi tuna.  Both were AMAZING! One person got the crab cake meal and said it was good, but a little too much breading and not enough crab (again, for the price...). Two people got the \\"salmon special.\\" The waiter described it to us and said it comes with scallops, kale, and a cauliflower puree.  They said it was awesome.  Then, they got the bill.  It was priced as a salmon meal for $44, then a scallops add on for $14.  When they asked the waiter about it being a special and why it was rung up like that he said \\"no, it's a feature not a special.\\"  Absolute bullshit and a scam.  I ordered the parmesan crusted scallops with the lobster risotto and a side of brussel sprouts.  Thank god I ordered the side.  The scallops were good, but the lobster risotto was awful.  Super sticky and like a massive lump and very dry.  The whole plate needed some liquid or sauce.  Also, the bread didn't come until about 2 minutes before our entrees.\\n\\nUnfortunately I won't be back to this restaurant.  Mediocre service and food for a very high price.

Go figure.\\n\\nClover doesn't look like it belongs in Burlington.  Tucked in a little strip mall across from the behemoth Burlington shopping center, it's very different than it's neighbors.  If you walk past and peer through the window, you can only sorta tell that it's a restaurant.  With the conspicuous lack of cash registers and the enormous, open kitchen area it looks more like a up-scale culinary school classroom.\\n\\nSure enough, it's a little piece of Cambridge stuck in the midst of the 'burbs.  It's got everything a suburbanite might love about that (interesting, well-cooked food  in a unique setting) and some of the things they might not (mostly their hipster-without-a-cause modus operandi). \\n\\nIt's worth stating up front that this is a vegetarian place, which is neither a pro nor a con in my book.  There are lots of tasty ways to make vegetarian food.  And it doesn't seem to be vegetarian for health-consciousness reasons, either -- there are lots of tasty fried options.  Anyway, if you want a cheese steak you should look elsewhere.   \\n\\nSo, here's the breakdown.  First, the cons:\\n\\n* The whole ordering system is jacked.  I think they're trying to project a cool, techno-savvy image with the whole 'we use iPods, not cash registers' thing.  But with the tiny screens, the non-traditional menu, the hit-or-miss card swiping system, the slightly-too-small area near the door and the inevitable flux of slightly befuddled mall patrons it's really inefficient and a bit awkward to place your order.  In a food truck setting it makes sense to use a small, mobile platform, and I know their origins are with food trucks but still...it's silly and feels forced.\\n\\n* Speaking of the menu, you have about 20 square feet of monitor space for the menu.  It'd be a good idea to put some descriptions of the food next to the names. 'Breakfast sandwich' is a bit nondescript.\\n\\n* It might because they only recently opened, but they don't seem to quite have their stuff together yet.  For example: I placed a to-go order.  Each item I ordered was offered over to me individually as it was prepared, which meant I had to stand there and keep stuffing my food, item-by-item, in a to-go bag.  Sometimes the food comes out quickly, sometimes is really, really slow.  I'm sure they'll get there, though.\\n\\nWhatever.  I won't dock them a star for these.  It's all fixable.  And the pros:\\n\\n* Popovers and french fries.  These are their secret weapons.  All of their food is good, but I'll be coming back for these.  For the uninitiated, popovers are like muffin-size Yorkshire puddings.  Mostly hollow with a crunchy exterior and a spongy, egg-y interior.  Stupidly good.  I'm waiting for them to serve them with marmalade or jam or something.  God, that'd be awesome.  And the fries.  Oh boy.  They've got the same fry-making rig as In-N-Out burger out West, but the fries are SO much better than that.  No ketchup need apply.  Perfect as-is. \\n\\n* It's really tasty.  Vegetarian can be done well, and they succeed at it.  The ingredients seem fresh and you get the sense that it's all real food of the type that you might make for yourself if you were inclined.  No mass-produced, form-pressed, preservative-laden crap here.\\n\\n* Prices are great.  A $7 plate of food at Clover is every bit as filling as a $8 burrito from Chipotle next door, and way better tasting.  \\n\\n* The staff are actually pretty friendly.  They're all cooler than me.  I'm ok with that.  But they'll chat with you, and happily explain the menu, and if something is amiss they'll work to correct it.  No complaints.\\n\\nClover is a 8 minute drive from my house.  It's by far the best fast food-style restaurant in the Burlington-Bedford-Billerica suburboplex.  I have a feeling I'll be back regularly."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"When I asked the lady who was behind the counter if the red velvet cupcake has a cream cheese frosting, she said it has a  mixture of buttercream and cream cheese frosting and suggested that I get a red velvet cake that has only the cream cheese frosting.\\nThat was not true at all. \\nDo not get a red velvet cake here! \\nAlso the lady was very rude when she asked me to pay and didn't even offer to put it in a box so I had to ask.

With that being said though, the decor inside isn't all half bad. The majority of the floor is lit with recessed lights, and there are big windows on the right side (or left depending on which way you're facing) of the restaurant that lets in more than ample lighting during the day.\\n\\nThe tables and chairs are simple, but they work. Wooden tables all around, with booth seats lined across the walls (not actual booths, but faced towards the middle). The place is generally clean, although the table does get a little sticky sometimes if the server didn't wipe it properly from the prior patrons. The place itself isn't exactly large, but they do cram quite a few tables on the floor, so be prepared to bump into someone when moving about; people are generally nice about it.\\n\\nNow the vibe is completely different from your typical sit in restaurant; everything is quite fast paced here, and the servers are always moving around.\\n\\nAlways.\\n\\nIt almost feels like you're at a fast food restaurant, with the added bonus of your food being brought to your table. This could be taken either way... You're benefiting from the fast service you usually look for at an establishment like McDonalds, but you're missing the service of an actual server that usually comes from a typical sit down restaurant. I'm not saying they're rude or anything (although they can be at times), but it their minds will always be on their next task, which can clearly be seen on their faces.\\n\\nFood:\\nCan't necessarily say the food is terrible, but you can't really say it's exceptional either. It's one of those places where the food is just \\"ok\\", a place where if you're craving for sushi and in the area you might walk in just for the convenience.\\n\\nWe ordered a couple of rolls, a tuna gomae, and a salmon don... As expected, nothing too special. The rolls were a decent size, and had a good ratio between rice and filling. The rice itself has a good texture to it, nothing too mushy, so that's always a plus at a restaurant that doesn't exactly pride itself on 3 star Michelin quality food. The salmon don was quite typical, but it was a big portion so if anything it is worth its weight in... Well, rice and fish I guess. The tuna gomae... Well let's just say it was drenched in a liquid-like peanut sauce, and the tuna was slightly frozen... Not recommended.\\n\\nOverall:\\nI'm not entirely sure what to make of this place. At a glance the place looks like it can be a fancy Japanese restaurant, but when you actually sit down at a table it feels cheap. The food isn't spectacular, but compared to other Japanese restaurants in the Lower Mainland it is quite inexpensive. They are always busy, but half the time it feels like they are doing take-out orders. Staff are quite inattentive, but at the same time it feels like they're trying to do 5 things at a time.\\n\\nIt's a sit down fast-ish food Japanese restaurant.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts:\\nIt's not a great place, but it's not a bad place... Given what it is. Cheap Japanese take-out in the area? Go for it. Hate crowds? May want to look elsewhere.\\n\\n- Malffej\\n\\nFrom my \\"food bite\\" on my blog: http://ffejiebytes.com/2014/03/26/food-bites-sushi-garden-lougheed/"},{"name":"Yaletown Brewing Company","address":"1111 Mainland Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"I find that the vegetarian options at restaurants are often exceptionally good, presumably since they have to make up for that lack of dead animal flavour somehow.\\n\\nMy portobello mushroom burger was no exception: the \\"meat\\" was a \\"6 hour balsamic marinated portobello\\" (because 5 hours of marination just wouldn't do), topped with young mozzarella (AKA bocconcini), truffled garlic aioli, and other fancy-sounding things that you don't have in your fridge.\\n\\nA. also went for a veggie-inspired option: an inventive spinach & apple pizza topped with Bechamel sauce.

Staff - everyone is friendly, fun, and delivers wonderful service\\n2. Food - not just typical bar food, they switch the menu (at least the specials) frequently, deliver delicious food with good presentation and have great happy hour (4-7; till midnight on Tuesdays)\\n3. Drinks - always some unique cocktails with ever-changing specials (try the cheap date, with freshly shaved ginger)\\n4. Outdoor Seating - bring on the sunshine and watch SE Portland residents strut by\\n5. Special Events - from burlesque shows, comedy troupes, outdoor block parties to one of the official spots for the Naked Bike Ride after party, there's always something fun happening here.  Also, a projector for occasional viewing parties (where I watched the most recent presidential election)\\n6. Layout/Design - Split into two adjoining spaces, the bar side has a good amount of table and bar seating; the event space next door has comfy couches and cocktail tables, facing a newly (bigger) redesigned stage.

We found this restaurant from one of our Yelp lunch quests. During that first visit, we had a very pleasant experience. Staff was friendly. My daughter wanted to order steak from their dinner menu as it was not offered during lunch. They gladly obliged, saying \\"not a problem.\\"\\n\\nToday, we were going to celebrate my daughter's birthday and she specifically asked me to have her birthday lunch at this restaurant because she wanted to order their steak again. I called a few days ahead to make our reservation. During that phone call, I asked the lady on the line if we could order steak from their dinner menu as it was my daughter's birthday lunch and her special order request. The lady put me on hold and asked the manager if that was possible. She came back after speaking to her manager and I was told, sure, they would gladly serve steak for our meal. I asked her to be sure about it as I told her, \\"I do not want to show up on Saturday, asking for steak from your dinner menu and be surprised to be rejected.\\" She said, for sure we will gladly serve the steak from the dinner menu. I asked again, \\"would you like me to speak to your manager about it?\\" She said, no need, I just asked the manager and it was approved.\\n\\nSure enough, we show up today for our reservation. We were a little late for our reservation but I told the person on the phone at the restaurant that we are coming, it's just the mass was a bit long. They said fine, no worries.\\n\\nWaitress started asking for our orders. It turns out there were 2 other people wanting steak, in addition to my daughter. Expectedly, the waitress said, we are only serving brunch menu, not dinner menu. So I said, I already informed your staff that we will be ordering steak from your menu and that they should be okay with it, I have been granted approval when I made my reservation. So she said she will ask her manager.\\n\\nManager comes, in a very business-like, terse tone, not apologetic sounding, \\"sorry we are only serving from our breakfast and lunch menu. not from the dinner menu. okay?\\" And he left. RUDE!!!!!!!!! We were all dumb-founded by the manager's statement. No ho=hum, came and went.\\n\\nWe all stood up and started to leave. I told the waitress, that reaction from the manager was uncalled for. As I passed by the counter, the manager and a few of his staff were all still talking about us as we may have caused a bit of a commotion with our reaction. So I went up to him and explained that I did not need that kind of rude behavior from him, towards his customers. I explained the whole situation to him but what he did was rude and unnecessary. He later said, \\"if all you wanted was steak from the dinner menu, we have cut-up steaks in the basement that we could serve you. But to prepare the rest of the food that goes with it, we cannot do it.\\" I said, do not bother. And I left.\\n\\nMind you, there is not a good free parking nearby, so we had to go to a paid parking lot, cost $12 a car, and we had 2 cars. We did not mind that expensive parking because we were all looking forward to a nice meal.\\n\\nLater that afternoon, the owner called me and apologized saying they dropped the ball on us, invited us to go back, meal on her. She explained that the staff may not have expected that we were going to order more than 1 steak. (How could I tell the rest of my party not to order steak?) I thanked her for the call. It was a nice gesture at least and I appreciated her effort for reaching out to me. She even greeted my daughter happy birthday. However, damage has been done. My daughter was disappointed at the incident, but we were able to find another restaurant to go to and still enjoyed her birthday late lunch.\\n\\nSorry but this will be a restaurant we will NO LONGER be visiting.

The primary reason for the review is this- After a long day at work and a Mopac-traffic ride home I decided not to cook, so I called in a take-out order from Yanagi.  Its in a convenient location & has not failed me yet.  \\n\\nI ordered the Philadelphia roll, the Las Vegas roll, the Crunchy roll & spicy garlic edamame.  I also asked for extra soy sauce, noting laughingly that we were out at the house.  \\n\\nMy husband stopped in to pick up shortly after I called.  After a short wait he returned home with our order.  \\n\\nThe bag was knotted shut or else maybe he'd of checked it before he left the restaurant.  Not thinking he'd have to look for an impending mistake, he brought the bag in and we checked it out.  \\n\\nInside was 1) no chopsticks (the girl I ordered from mentioned they would be) 2)no soy sauce (even though my request for extra was not going to be a problem) 3)edamame that was not cooked through 4)only two of our three rolls we ordered.  \\n\\nThe food was alright- edible for sure, but lacking that sparkle you expect when you spend $40 ON TAKE OUT!!!\\n\\nHere's THE WORST PART- If I come across a mistake like this, all I ask is to fix it.  I left with $25 worth of merchandise- you should reimburse me for the product I did not receive.  When we called the restaurant we explained what happened and we were told they'd call us back.  20 minutes later the phone rang and they apologized but offered no recourse.  We pushed further for a solution and were placed on hold while the hostess talked to the \\"manager\\".  When the hostess told us there was nothing she could do we got upset and decided NOT to drop it.   We demanded to speak with the manager- a man came on the line and we explained what happened- then he laughed, \\"I am just the waiter- the managers not even here tonight...\\" We about flipped out.  All we wanted was to be reimbursed for the food we never got- thats practically like stealing RIGHT out of our pocket.  \\n\\nThey were not willing to even provide another roll- something we may have (begrudgingly) accepted.

The Florentine is the traditional cannoli with chocolate chips, but the shell is made with almonds and honey.

The Chocolate Ricotta was also extremely decadent, but did not live up to my expectations. The shell was not as fresh - it was slightly more stale and soft. The filling had the same consistency as the original, but lacked the deep chocolate flavor I was expecting.

I had a bad feeling because I saw the cakes in the cases, and their frosting was stark white with brightly colored accents... What this means is that they don't use real butter.

If you want white and bright colors, you have to use vegetable shortening (ahem, Crisco). This is all fine, but it's not what you expect from an Italian bakery. Come on guys, you have enough business that you can spend a little more on ingredients, can't you? Am I just a snob?\\n\\nBut back to the cannoli. So sweet. Inedibly so.

You have to wave down someone because they don't come to you, and so we wave down the guy in the suit, I guess the manager on shift... and asked about our order. He asks the waitress..she has a look on her face that looks like it reads, \\"OH sh** I totally forgot to put the order in!\\". They were apologetic and we were hungry and they said things would come out quick. 10 minutes later nothing came and we were about to leave and they gave us one dish. Things slowly arrived 10 minutes later. Terrible service. Didn't offer to discount our bill or anything."},{"name":"Umami Mia Pizzeria","address":"1500 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This is a very different pizzeria. I visited there today for lunch and had the oak grilled meatball sandwich. The spread on the sandwich was scrumptious and there were plenty of meatballs on the crisp bread. The cucumber salad that came with the sandwich was equally unique and tasteful. The waiter was quite attentive and delightful. He even turned down the music so our large table could better hear each other. Overall, I was quite impressed and highly recommend Umami Mia."},{"name":"Cambridge Common","address":"1667 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"This place has become the unofficial hangout place for my group of starving grad student friends. Between the welcoming atmosphere (so chill compared to all the bars in Harvard Square) and the grad student prices, we're hooked!\\n\\nSome tips if you're also a grad student and new to the Harvard area:\\n\\n1. The burgers are an awesome deal. My habit is the $8.95 1667 burger, but the daily burger specials tempt me often as well (mmhmm pulled pork).\\n2. The Victory Golden Monkey is priced way below market at a measely $4.95. (I really hope the management isn't reading this so they don't wise up!)"},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"SAVED BY THE VIEW!!\\nThe food was average, but the view was definitely not average! I have never been to a Mexican restaurant where they can't cut the onions off the fajitas and just leave the bell peppers! I was only told this fact after the fajitas arrived to my table and the waitress went back to correct the order. She came back to our table and told us that it was not possible! Did I mention the views are amazing ?? Despite all, the waitress was friendly and attentive. The only way to experience \\"a hurricane\\" in Austin is to have one at the Oasis!! The drinks are strong and served in a commemorative glass!  Still we enjoyed the experience and if you have never been then definitely worth the trip!! Overall, the hilltop views will keep us coming back to this destination time and time again!"}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:O},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:z,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],j={key:0},L={key:1};function R(n,e,s,f,i,r){const c=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",D,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",L,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",j,"See more"))],8,N)):w("",!0)])}const F=u(H,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-3ddcb311"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/59.md","filePath":"people/59.md"}'),G={name:"people/59.md"},Y=Object.assign(G,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(F)]))}});export{V as __pageData,Y as default};
