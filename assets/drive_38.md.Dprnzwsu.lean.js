I'm just glad that they provided us food while we waited...and not just samplers too, the lady gave us a whole dish!\\n\\nSo my reservation was at 8:45 and did not get seated until almost 10. When we got our table, our server, Mike, was very helpful with the menu. I was very sad to see them not serve Razor Clams and Bone Marrow though! I picked this place specifically for that as my girlfriend loves them! Sigh, but we opted for other food that I read from here that were pretty good.\\n\\nMussels al Diablo - Good, not too spicy and had a pretty good sauce. The mussels were on the small side and the bread that came with it was WAY too burnt.\\n\\nCalamari - The calamari was not what I expected, not the usual deep fried ones that you would get from other restaurants...which I actually enjoyed for a change! The squid was very tender and not chewy at all. The sauce was excellent. Definitely a good change from the norm. I just saw on the menu that they have a Crispy Calamari, so that's probably the deep fried one.\\n\\nPrawns a la Plancha - I acutally ordered the wrong one. This one comes with the shell on with red chimichurri. The ones I wanted was the Gambas al Ajillo. It was my fault, I just dislike shell on...cause I'm lazy. But it was delicious regardless.\\n\\nScallops - Don't remember what this one was actually called, but it was delicious. Came with 3 scallops, but sadly we only got 2 and a half scallops as one of them seems like it was missing half of it.\\n\\nHanger Steak - These were pretty good, but I'm not sure if they were supposed to come out hot...or cold. Our hanger steak came out cold, but it was pretty good. Not something I would kill for, but decent.\\n\\nThat was all we tried, I think our stomach shrunk from all the waiting...therefore we did not try dessert.. I would definitely come back and try all the other items that people are saying is awesome! The ones I really want to try is the crispy pork belly and the Arctic Char a la Plancha. Hopefully they'll bring back the razor clams and bone marrow soon! Awesome thing is that they offered us 2 tokens for tapas next time we come for the survey! Love the tokens, a nice touch."},{"name":"The Cowfish - Atlanta","address":"4400 Ashford Dunwoody Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I'm leaving a review for 5 Stars because I was pleasantly surprised!

Located next to Cheesecake Factory in Perimeter Mall, the Cowfish serves a large menu of burgers, sushi, and fusion items that the restaurant calls \\"burgushi\\".  The atmosphere of the restaurant is really fun.  You'll see Broadway posters and famous artwork with cows and sushi superimposed on top of them.  There's a fish tank behind the bar (can't remember the last time I've seen that). At the front, there's also a virtual fish tank where the fish were named Mackerel Jordan and M.C. Hammerhead.  Seating is both indoor and outdoor.  Burgers are priced around $12-15 and fusion items are priced around $14-22.\\n\\nHighlights: The combination of burgers and sushi works.  To get the full experience, I ordered the \\"Ultimate Brento Bento Box\\".  This bento box comes with a large portion of edamame, Thai cucumbers, sweet potato fries, two mini-burgers of the day, and your choice of one of three sushi rolls.  There are two slightly cheaper bento boxes, which are differentiated by the rolls and number of mini burgers you get.  For a non-traditional sushi establishment, the sushi was very good.  My Boss roll had good quality fish and had a great blend of items in it.  Sides were excellent.  I noted that my sweet potato fries were seasoned with the right amount of salt, so no ketchup was necessary.  The Thai cucumbers complemented the sushi well and were a great palate cleanser for the mini burgers.  The lightly seasoned special burger of the day had jalapenos and cheese on it - there was a nice kick of spice from the pepper.  As mentioned, the atmosphere is awesome.  Look around and you'll notice a lot of thought was put into the interior design.  I came with two other people and everyone enjoyed their food.\\n\\nCritiques: I thought the mini burgers could have been a little moister, but all in all the burgers were still very good.  My friend wolfed down his Longhorn burger before I was half done with my bento box, so I'm guessing that one was excellent.  Next time, maybe I'll share a full size burger and full size roll with someone.\\n\\nOverall: The Cowfish is a fun restaurant with a huge menu, interesting decor, and well prepared meals that combine American and Japanese tastes.  My friends and I all have decided we will come back."},{"name":"bartaco","address":"969 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Really loved the atmosphere of this place!

And, that's a good thing. I live close by in Dorchester (where the same gentrification is also changing the restaurant landscape) and I work out of South Boston, and it is ALWAYS a pleasure to visit a Boston staple where, like that other, albeit fictional bar...\\"everyone knows your name.\\"\\n\\nThat friendly neighborly ambiance speaks volumes about the indigenous staff, many of whom now live in \\"Southie\\" or hail from close by (Quincy, Dorchester, etc.). The familiarity and sense of being close to \\"home\\" lends to a very relaxed but vibrant vibe and sometimes creates an amazing volume of bar and restaurant chatter, especially when things are busy, which they usually are moving toward the dinner hour. In my opinion, most people like Amrhein's for its laid-back and casual atmosphere, and they come back and relative to that \\"familial\\" feel you will, indeed, find entire families--all three generations--gathering in Amrhein's for fun, food, and festivities.\\n\\nBetween myself and my friends, we've had just about everything on the menu. (One fella is addicted to their cheesy, aromatic French Onion Soup, another to his specialized order of grilled salmon over Caesar salad). I love their Roasted Beet & Goat Cheese salad, risotto, and Mac-n-Cheese \\"Premium Sides.\\" Some of the portions (meat loaf entree and chicken pot pie, come to mind) are humongous. Their pizzas are creative and tasty (yet another friend special orders a potato-and-bacon pie). Their daily specials keep things interesting. Prices, mid-range. Food service, usually spot on (EVERY restaurant will have a day or night when things get batty due to sick calls, special events, large groups arriving simultaneously, etc.).\\n\\nWe usually post up at the bar where the service is superb.\\n\\nBartenders: Kaitlin, Victoria, Christine, Rory, and Jodi...superstars!\\n\\nOn it, like hornets. Attentive, hilarious, and amiable.\\n\\nBelieve me, as an ex-bartender, I know how hard it is to keep your bar guests sated and satisfied while also keeping up with the--seemingly endless--drink orders arriving via the sit-down patrons.\\n\\nAmmie's bartenders work with the wait staff...flawlessly.\\n\\nManagers Mike and Donna, and the entire Amrhein's staff: the New England Patriots personified in a restaurant staff.\\n\\nChamps! And, they do it with a smile, sincerity, and a neighborly touch.\\n\\nAmrhein's has the usual variety of craft beers, either on draft (where some selections change by season) or by the can or bottle. Judging by the cluster of wine bottles situated near the service station, I'm not going out on a limb saying that they have a decent wine selection too (they do have a \\"wine list\\"). Amrhein's had some renovations in 2005 and it is the proud home of the oldest hand carved bar in America and still has the first Draft Beer pump in Boston on display.\\n\\nI think of Amrhein's the same way I think of the Old State House near downtown Boston: a stately, old-timey place that stands proud and tall amidst more contemporary attractions. Always welcoming, always reliable. \\n\\nLike that elegant building downtown, Amrhein's will remain a (South) Boston tradition, forever."},{"name":"Orinoco","address":"22 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"One of our new favorites!

The 'Tiger Tears' salad was amazing and though small, was the most flavorful salad I've ever tasted in my life. I have no idea what they really put in it  (the server listed the ingredients way too fast) but it's spicy, salty, vinegary, sweet, pungent, and crunchy, all at the same time. I was licking the sauce off the plate. The moo shu pork was also pretty great, and was made with 3 kinds of pork- bacon, Chinese sausage, and sauteed pork. The plum sauce was meh but I used Sriracha instead. Also tried a bit of a stir fried beef and pepper dish that was really smoky and actually spicy. Everything here is appropriately seasoned and actually spicy when they say it's spicy. The drink I had (had St. Germain in it) was also good but seemed light on the alcohol. I loved the decor also;  the Chinese newspaper placemats, the good luck cat, and the haiku wall are all various nice touches.\\n\\nNow the gripes 1.) The hostess was very, very nice but seated us at the bar when there were clearly tables for 2 available (it was only 5:30 and I eyed 2 seaters throughout our whole time there). 2.) The waiter was very knowledgeable but not attentive at all. I understand how busy this place gets but I think they ignore the counter to their detriment. 3.) The portions are a weensy bit small for these prices. I understand that higher quality restaurants  will always serve smaller portions but if you're going to call most of this 'tapas' then lighten up the prices a little bit, or increase your portions on the 'entrees' section. I was not really bothered by the \\"served as it's ready\\" sequencing but can see how others wouldn't like that. \\n\\nThat being said, the food is so fresh, flavorful, and fun that I have to come back.

I have to say this one of the better burgers I've had in a while. You can pick your own side and I ordered the caeser salad.  The lettuce was fresh with a vinegar based dressing. Not bad for a salad. *Note I don't normally like salads, but I ordered it to make myself feel better about the burger :P\\n\\n2.Chicken Fried Chicken - my husband ordered this meal and it was EXCELLENT. It's a big piece of boneless pounded chicken breast breaded in a wonderful crispy way. It 's topped with gravy..yum. and served with green beans. I don't like green beans at all, but my husband made we taste them because he claimed there were SO GOOD. So I took a bite and he was right. They were really tender and flavorful. It also came with a potatoe pancake, again this was delicious. We were shocked that everything on the plate was delicious. \\n\\nNeedless to say, I was stuffed after eating my entire burger and picking off my husbands place. The burger was a decent size, but the portion for the Chicken fried chicken was huge.\\n\\nThe bill for 2 beers, 1 soda, 1 appetizer and 2 entrees came out to $51.00 not including tip. Not bad deal for a good and a meal!  Not the cheapest Tuesday type of meal, but it was definitely worth it.\\n\\nYes we will come back again."},{"name":"Yard House","address":"825 Battery Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"If you are not a beer drinker the ale drinks are fantastic!

I was complaining loudly to my boyfriend and my friend about why they didn't let us in, and two new people (who didn't wait) got seated right away.

There aren't many Korean joints around this location, so it's a wonderful addition (I hope they can continue and stay!).\\n\\nThe place was pretty empty when we got there around 6pm, 3 tables of people. We were greeted warmly and seated promptly. The place looked clean and neat. I guess the fusion part is that they still offer some Japanese sushi.\\n\\nFirst to arrive was the Bossam ($18.99) which is a boiled pork belly dish with sauce and wrapped in greens. The pork was nicely marbled and seasoned well. The napa cabbage it came with was crisp and contrasted well with the soft, melt-in-your-mouth pork belly. I'm not sure what the spicy dish was but it tasted like radish, and added crunch and flavor to the bite. Side dishes weren't remarkable, there was kimchi, bean sprouts, zucchini slices, and a ball of sweet mashed potato.\\n\\nI couldn't resist getting a sushi roll and I love scallops so I got Under the Sea ($6.95). This is a torched spicy chopped scallop roll with surprise cream cheese. I say surprise because it wasn't a listed item on the menu. Overall the taste was average, fresh scallops were overwhelmed by the cream cheese and sauce. I wish they had went easy on the spicy sauce, otherwise a well made roll.\\n\\nCan't forget the Korean style rolls so we settled on the original Gyori Kimbab ($5.25) with fried egg, spinach, crabmeat, fishcake, pickled radish, burdock, and carrot. This was the only dish that was good bang for its buck. The roll was quite large in comparison the the previous and although simple, the flavors went well together and in good proportion. I enjoyed this quite a bit!\\n\\nOnto hot foods! We got their Soon Dubu Jjigae ($11.99)--otherwise known as soft tofu stew. We chose the mix, which included seafood and beef. Considering how much I'm paying for it, I was disappointed with the quality of this. It wasn't as rich as I'd had at other places and a little on the salty side. No egg went with it either.\\n\\nThe rice that accompanied the dish was really well made though, and they pour cold water (which the waitress leaked all over my jacket and didn't notice, but we'll let that slide) over the hot stone bowl with the remaining rice to make a soft rice stew thing. The pot was so hot it boiled out of the pot!\\n\\nSilly us, we got another rice dish, the Hot Stone Bibimbab ($12.99) had mixed veggies, beef, and an egg atop rice. Bowl was big but the ingredients only filled half the bowl, which kinda makes it look bad. It tasted good though! The hot stone kept the rice warm for the duration of our meal and we got crispy rice at the end, one of my dad's favorite parts of the meal!\\n\\nBefore we got our bill, the waitress brought us a sweet rice drink (on the house). I hear that rice water brightens and whitens the skin, so maybe this is the secret to how Koreans maintain their beautiful complexions! Anyways, it was a light sweet drink and quite nice to end the meal. My mom thought it was a little too sweet for her liking.\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed the meal. The food was above average and flavors were great. Service was friendly and almost the right amount (sometimes it was hard to find anyone since there's only two people running the front). Not that great quantity-to-price-wise because this isn't Vancouver, people will expect more food for the same price since there's a lot of competition around with equal quality and price but more quantity-- people want good food for a good price.

Garlic rolls weren't hot enough or soft enough, very doughy; somewhat of an afterthought it seemed.  For my entree, I had the eggplant rollatini with spinach & ricotta.

The eggplant had a nice crisp edge to it, and I finished it all off.

The second I went with my husband there was about a 20 minute wait which is understandable because it was Sunday morning, we got seated I wanted to try the stuffed French toast I asked the waitress what she recommended I always do that when I am yelping so I have an opportunity to give them a good rating on there most popular dish ... she said we should try the banana, caramel pecan stuffed French toast I asked if they had a lot of pecans as I am not a fan she said they were just sprinkled on top... very untrue the French toast is actually stuffed and jammed packed with pecans we literally left the entire order behind.

And good lord it is inexpensive.  6 adults cost a mere $59 and there was so much food left over.\\n\\nThere were a few courses.  We started off with soup that seemed to have a potato and onion base, but it was not heavy at all more of a broth.  Then there was a flat bread with a tomato and olive oil sauce with just the right amount of spice.  There were a few beverages with a mango drink, water, and the most amazing tea.  The tea was dark amber, sweetened with honey and had a blend of ginger and cinnamon. \\n\\nThe main course was roasted goat with rice.  The goat was good.  The rice was nicely seasoned and blended well with all the other spices throughout the evening.  It was never overwhelming or too much of any one thing.  We sampled each others dishes and the chicken will be my next dish.  \\n\\nThey have a an amazing hot sauce.  So good that it gets its own paragraph.  It starts out sweet - kind of like sweet barbaque, but it was not barbaque.  Then after you finish the bite the heat comes on slowly, like an old man easing into a warm bath.  Then it heats up and lingers in the center of your tongue like a first kiss.  Your second and third bite of food after sampling this sauce and spice is still there to flavor your food.  Too much of it will cause a light sweat and a little watering of the eyes, if you are not careful.  And like a hard liquor too much too early and it will hurt you.  The approach to this hot sauce should be the approach to a long and happy life.  All things in moderation, savor, and only take what you need - do not over indulge. \\n\\nI expect to return many more times.  I really like the idea of slowing things down and enjoying food.

It began almost three years ago...\\n\\nThe moment we drove into Portland from our trip to move out west from the east coast, we found ourselves in the never-ending struggle to find parking for our mini-van rental that was full of our earthly belongings. Which we needed to unload into our new apartment. Which was about five or six blocks uphill from where we found ourselves - which was at Blue Star. While I secured the air conditioned car in our street-side parking spot, my guy ran in for a coffee he was desperate for. \\n\\nHe came back to the car talking about how incredible the donuts looked - they were different. And in our household, that's not a statement we take lightly, not when it comes to delicious foods. So we got settled into our new home and find ourselves at Blue Star all the time and at this point, it's a newer thing. No one has figured it out yet and we made memories there! We once sat at the bar along the window eating donuts in short sleeve shirts and watched it start to snow. And another time we ran out of the doors mid-donut because we saw the singer of a band we were seeing at Crystal Palace later that night walking across the street. \\n\\nThey are literally the best donuts ever to happen. Ever. They are fluffy and chewy with pockets of aromatic donut air all over the place. The flavors are inventive without being ridiculous and they are real - real flavors. And seriously don't get me started on the old-fashioned. I can't, I can't even...No bullshit here, eating at Blue Star is a spiritual experience and that is something I will always hold close to my heart, but here's the thing...\\n\\nIt happened - what naturally happens, and SHOULD happen, when something is this marvelous - success. Suddenly there were lines outside and far along the building, every day, all day! The small, quaint building we used to love became a madhouse of hungry children and stuffed sardines of people organized in a confusing fashion. It happened quickly; they didn't seem prepared. Everything stayed slow and we literally couldn't make time to be at Blue Star. The magic was gone, and for that I'm taking a star.\\n\\nAnd maybe that's selfish, but you know what, this one's my star, and I'm taking it back...I'm taking 'em all back...\\n\\n(I love you, Blue Star!)"},{"name":"Milestones Restaurants","address":"2425 Cambie St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"We used to go to Milestones for every celebration, BIrthdays, guests visiting etc. We've been there twice in the last year and were very disappointed each time.

They do get fairly busy and have very long lines especially on the weekends, however it's worth the wait. If you don't feel like waiting, check out a different location; there's six in portland.

It's that good."},{"name":"Barley Swine","address":"6555 Burnet Rd, Ste 400","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Does Austin know how lucky it is? A place like Barley Swine is--staggeringly long wait time aside--pretty close to perfect. It only adds to the pantheon of world-class BBQ, sushi, food trucks, football, live music, and general weirdness the city has to offer. Oh, and if the natural progression of gourmet food truck to fantastic fixed-space restaurant is normally this impressive, Houston's Eatsie Boys should have some very high expectations indeed.\\n\\nBarley Swine is the brainchild of Bryce Gilmore, who made wait times for a food truck legendary with now-closed Odd Duck. Barley Swine is small, communal and always packed. If you prefer not to wait very long, come right at opening. But if you do have to wait, I suggest grabbing a pre-dinner snack and drink at neighboring Henri's, which is equally and unequivocally as awesomely Austin as Barley Swine. \\n\\nLike so many restaurants nowadays, Barley Swine focuses on seasonal, local, and varietal. It reminds me of places like Underbelly in Houston, Farmhouse in Chicago, and Girl & The Fig in Sonoma. If you come hungry, order the entire menu. If you come semi-stuffed, like us, a few choice dishes will suffice. Your bill's magnitude will suffer depending on your hunger level, but we split five dishes between the two of us and came away with a very reasonable check.\\n\\nIf you're at all familiar with Odd Duck, Barley Swine's dishes, ingredients, and style should be intimately familiar. The Grilled Heirloom Tomato tasted, pound for pound, like something I once had at Odd Duck, only on a ceramic white plate instead of a dixie paper tray. The famous Pork Belly, which we didn't get, makes its obligatory appearance on Barley Swine's seasonal menu, and I caught a glimpse of another table's Grilled Quail, which looked awfully familiar.\\n\\nBeyond that, though, Gilmore appears to have broadened his horizons. Southeast Asian, for example, appears to be much more prominent at Barley Swine. The Thai-influenced Corn Soup, with sharp bites of plum and tamarind flavor mellowed by a lovely coconut-based broth, is simply divine. Mediterranean also appears to be getting more run, with ingredients like saffron, chickpea, and cous cous making appearances.\\n\\nMore deliciousness ensued. One of the off-the-menu specials, the Head-on Gulf Shrimp, was a lovely bite of cajun but recalled the crunchiness of head-on amaebi sushi. Meanwhile, the Blackened Scallops brought back some of that southern style charm fused with southwestern daring that results in something undeniably Texan--who knew green chile grits and pickled corn could taste so good when eaten with scallops?\\n\\nGilmore also isn't afraid to take a turn towards the fancy: the vermouth foam accompanying the aforementioned Grilled Heirloom Tomato was impressive. But by far the best and most revelatory dish of the night was the outstanding Grilled Foie Gras...for dessert. Yes, dessert. The foie sits atop an oatmeal cookie, complemented by a reduced blackberry sauce and crunchy granola. The bite of all four together is a mind-blowing tasty treat that reminded me of a French Laundry plate that featured lobster alongside cherry. If the Pork Belly Slider was the dish to get at Odd Duck, the Foie Gras dessert is no doubt the \\"it dish\\" of Barley Swine.\\n\\nThe thing most impressive about Barley Swine, and other similarly praised restaurants like Houston's Underbelly, is the remarkable balance of flavor. Barley Swine's dishes are an amalgam of sweet, salty, savory, spicy, etc., and so forth, without being overbearing or subversive to any one particular side. The plates, in short, are harmonious. And, of course, they taste pretty freakin' good.\\n\\nBefore I wrap up the review, I'll leave you with this: take some time to enjoy the decor, the open kitchen, the community ambiance, and the friendly waitstaff. Gilmore and the Barley Swine crew have set up an impeccable operation--as long as you don't mind waiting an arm and a leg before you can actually enjoy it. I can't wait to go back."},{"name":"Whiskey's Food & Spirits","address":"885 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"This was my first time here and I will never return....First thing is they never came to get our drink order for 20 min then when we ordered our food and our app came out 3 min before our dinner so never got a chance to really enjoy our app before the food....Spoke to a manager and she didn't really seam to care too much about what we had to give her for feed back and not all the Feed back we gave her was negative...will never return...."},{"name":"There","address":"305 Brookhaven Ave, Ste 1200","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"WOW this place has INCREDIBLE photos of their food!

Stay away from my kidneys.\\n\\nI went with the special of the day, the B√°nh M√¨ burjer, and a Fois Gras milkshake. (I am aware of my spelling of the word 'burjer'. It is a congenital defect that I have dealt with all my life. Please don't be like Laura Stanley from 4th grade and taunt me relentlessly about it during 6th period (I am not a little burjer boy!)).\\n\\nThe B√°nh M√¨ burjer was fantastic. I could clearly taste the Vietnamese influence and it elevated that wonderful slab of meat to new heights. And while I was the only one brave enough/bad enough with money to be willing to spend $8 on a milkshake, I was proud of my choice. The Fois Gras milkshake basically tasted like a really rich vanilla milkshake and I was fine with that.\\n\\nI got to try a few of my friends' milkshakes and I enjoyed the Cap'n Crunch and the Nutella Burnt Marshmallow shakes. The Krispy Kreme one was actually kind of gross, though. The little pieces of dough floating in the milkshake really bothered me. It guess it reminded me of the war.\\n\\nThere was an incident with our waiter. He did drop a milkshake on one of my friends. Now, it sucks that the waiter dropped a milkshake on my friend, but I'm really glad it happened. We got all our milkshakes taken off our bill! Thanks, friend, for being such a wonderful milkshake canvas!\\n\\nThis was my first time at FLIP, so I can only assume that the events that transpired here happen every time you visit. So in that case, I can say with confidence that FLIP will always give you free milkshakes, but with the small caveat that they will drop a milkshake on someone at your table. I find that the flavor of food is enhanced by danger, so this is a positive for me.\\n\\nEveryone else at the tables seemed to enjoy their burjers as well, so I highly recommend that you visit FLIP Burjer Boutique and treat yourself to a burjer.

However, if you ask for something, they'll make it for you.  The Cuban is my go-to but the Ben's Black and Blue and the Brown Bag Sub are also very good. You can walk out of the Brown Bag with a sandwich, a bag of chips and a soda for about $10-12.  The sandwiches are always made fresh while you wait and you usually never wait more than about 5 minutes to get your order.  There are the usual members of the German Village art crowd coming through the door but on the weekdays you can expect a proportionate number of business people in suits and ties as well.

When we walked in we were greeted by the hostess who explained how the seating process works; walk through the restaurant past the bar to order, then come back through to the front to get your table. I find it odd that the order line is in the back of the restaurant instead of in the front like most \\"order then sit with your number\\" restaurants. \\n\\nI ordered the Magic Shroom (goat cheese, mushrooms and basil pesto) and a Live Oak Hefeweizen while my dining partner got the classic burger and a bottle of lonestar. We shared an order of fries. The girl taking our order asked if I wanted mustard or mayo on my burger which I thought would have tasted odd. Why would I want yellow mustard with my goat cheese? No thanks. \\n\\nThe dining area has a nice atmosphere; low lighting, high booths, a couple TVs and a lot of windows. We sat down and waited about 10 minutes for the food. My beer came in a schooner glass which is typical for a Hef, but at $5 for less than a pint I was left with more to be desired. \\n\\nThe burger had a lot of good flavors going for it, but it was dry, I suspect because of the type of goat cheese and pesto used. Or maybe because the goat cheese was on the cold bun and not the hot burger so it couldn't melt. I should have added the mayo. \\n\\nThe fries were very good! Small, McD's sized but had a lot more care put into them. We used the horseradish mustard to dip them in which is house made and fantastic. \\n\\nFor the ladies; have your man sit facing the street. Otherwise you'll get a distracted conversation all night; the televisions are only on one side of the room on the kitchen wall. \\n\\nOverall, I was hoping to get more from the burger with that price, but everything else was good. The Smokey Goat at Red's Porch is much better tasting, albeit it has bacon which is going to make anything taste better.

The helpful staff were very attractive -- water glasses never empty-- and helped us understand the menu... which is not as clearly presented as one might like.  The menu has pictures of each offering, by let's face facts:  one bowl of ramen looks a lot like the others.  It's hard to see the difference between miso and soy base.

Yes, yes, and yes.\\nI usually don't dig too hard on themes (they're fun the first time, but then it gets old), but honestly, they could call this place PeeWee's Breakfast Playhouse and as long as the food and service were the same, I'd dress up like the King of Cartoons to get in if I had to. \\n\\nMy asparagus omelette was perfect- the right size, the right level of cheese, the right level of doneness- and the homefries were a good rendition of the traditional Greek diner style potatoes.  The scali toast was nice as well.  Next time though- eggnog waffle.\\n\\nThe only off experience I had was my waitress flaked on giving me the check, but I used that as an excuse to talk to some cute college girls who sat down at the bar.

Located in the heart of German Village, a meal at the iconic Schmidt's restaurant will transport you to Bavaria. Established in 1886, Schmidt's serves authentic German food. Yes, you will eat real pretzels.\\n Before you decide to have a meal here, remember that they do not take reservations. The 45-minute wait gives you plenty of time to build up an appetite and go on a walk through the streets. The restaurant hasn't undergone any major renovation work over the years. The interiors are archaic and intricately done. The delicious aroma of sauerkraut and Paulaner(famous German beer) lingers in the air. You can't really go wrong with menu. \\n     The food is simple, the kind you will find in a German household. I would highly recommend the German meatloaf and Bahama Mama. The sausages are succulent and are a perfect match with the soft bun and faintly pungent sauerkraut. You can enjoy your meal while watching the world go by on the cobbled streets. \\n      A group of charming musicians in traditional German clothing liven the mood with folk music. They will not miss an opportunity to pick you out from the crowd to get you to sing, so be prepared. However, there is one protocol you must follow in this festivity. No matter how heavy you feel at the end of your meal, accommodate space for the cream puffs. They are soft, spongy and much lighter than you would expect them to be. \\nThey say that you never eat at Schmidt's just once. Once you eat, you keep coming back for more.

When Yalla re-opened, the line was about 15 people long. Luckily we were in the front of it.\\n\\nThe menu was a bit confusing to me at first so I asked a couple of questions and learned that you pay for either a bowl, laffa (flatbread), or pita and the price varies based on your meat choice, or lack thereof. I opted for a falafel yalla (say that 5x fast) and went down the line and the was asked what kind of toppings I wanted. Everything you add is included in the base price- so pile it on! I added hummus, red cabbage, sweet potato, broccoli, olives and probably some other delectables I cant recall. The end result was a massive rolled up flat bread that I had to eat with two hands. Yum! I also ordered a side of hummus, which was a huge portion that I didn't need. The laffa was more than enough. But, I have a hard time passing on hummus. Since I had already had beer- I skipped the handmade sodas that I have read so much about. I will have to save that experience for next time.\\n\\nI will definitely return to Yalla and I have to give them props for having a menu that also caters to non meat eaters.

All of the hype surrounding La Quercia and all of the glowing reviews had me itching to write this place off as a restaurant for pretentious food snobs (y'know, the snobs that you love to hate).\\n\\nBut, I was wrong.\\n\\nFirst of all, to enjoy La Quercia means you need to adjust your expectations somewhat. It's very clear from the get-go that La Quercia is a restaurant that demands that its patrons play by its rules. And there are lots of them. But, if you play along, you will be handsomely rewarded.\\n\\nRight off the top, when you call the restaurant, it's more likely than not that you won't get to talk to a real, live person and that instead you'll get immediately bumped to voicemail (even if you call when the restaurant is open). It can be a little off-putting, but just hang in there.\\n\\nThen, when you actually speak to a real, live person for a reservation, you're given the option of 2 seatings: an early seating (usually 5 or 5:30) and a late seating (usually around 8:00). There are no choices other than \\"A\\" and \\"B\\", so don't even bother asking, Princess. Also, if you get the early seating, they make it clear that you have to eat and be gone within 2 hours, 30 minutes. \\n\\nIf you can get past these initial hurdles, as the poet Bon Jovi has said, you're halfway there. But -- surprise! -- there are a few tips to heed. Although it's not an outright \\"rule\\", your friendly server will give you a polite, enticing hard-sell the 7- or 10-course \\"alla famiglia\\" tasting menu, even though there are usually about 15 or so a la carte items. The tasting menu requires the diner to submit and surrender absolutely to the whims of the kitchen; translation: the kitchen will cook whatever it wants and you're going to enjoy every bite, damn it. \\n\\nDon't worry, you will.\\n\\nIf you choose to submit, the madness behind all of these little rules becomes crystal clear: dinner at La Queria is a carefully choreographed dance. The reason for the 2 strict seating times is so that the food can come out at the same time. At the end of it all, the house staff can then strike down and reset the tables with little fear of disturbing its patrons. A little self-serving for the restaurant, but I'm not complaining -- it's actually quite clever. \\n\\nWhen the rush of food starts rolling out of the kitchen, you quickly realize that the hard-sell of the tasting menu is another stroke of genius on La Quercia's part. While the kitchen prepares its food a la minute, I'm pretty sure it does so in batches. You see, while the kitchen is slaving away on the dishes for your table, it's likely working on the identical dish for the table next to yours, too. Perhaps this is a method that the kitchen uses to ensure quality and flavour. Whatever the reasoning, I don't care and neither will you, because it works. \\n\\nThat being said, there is some flexibility in the tasting menu and the kitchen is very accommodating in this regard. For instance, on the night I visited, we asked for a 7-course vegetarian/pescetarian tasting menu. There was no fuss or drama from the kitchen (even though we were -- gasp -- breaking the rules!), and our tasting was markedly different from the other meat-centric tasting menu. Even within the meat-centric tasting menu, I noticed some small differences from table to table.\\n\\nAs for the 2 hour 30 minute time limit, don't worry: even if you hmm-and-haw over whether to order the tasting menu or go a la carte (and trust me, you will be torn), and even if you nibble on your food at a leisurely pace, you can definitely finish a 7-course tasting meal (which includes a dessert course) within the allotted 150 minute time limit. The food comes at a fairly steady rate and there isn't much of a lag between courses.\\n\\nNow, for the food itself. It makes little sense to talk about individual menu items because La Quercia changes its fresh sheet every day. The food isn't mind-blowing, but it is carefully prepared, with interesting but familiar flavours where the ingredients remain individually distinguishable. Rest assured that your meal will be well-executed and impeccably seasoned. Odds are also that you'll probably enjoy some delicious fresh, house-made pastas (both of the stuffed and noodle variety) that are cooked perfectly. Delicious.\\n\\nThe service at La Quercia is fantastic: the servers are knowledgeable, patient, detail-minded and attentive. Our server carefully went through the 16 individual items that were written on the menu board, which blew me away both from a service standpoint and from the sheer fact that the guy literally knew something about everything on the menu, which I will remind you, changes (even if only a little) every day. Impressive.\\n\\nMake sure you give yourself plenty of time to call ahead when making a reservation, because once you make it in, you won't be disappointed."},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Lemme just say this......

One item listed in the set never arrived and the rest consisted of half-spoons of this and that arranged, not very artfully, on a series of plates. I had the hanger steak (pretty good), which came with the following: 3.5 over-roasted, oily brussels sprouts with several 1/2\\" squares of limp tasteless bacon on top (no relation to the brussels sprouts) and a 2\\" solid homogeneous cube of what was called potatoes gratin (aka scalloped potatoes). The potatoes were one with the gratin. Solid. Another couple ordered the same thing and sent their plates back twice because the potatoes were cold. Don't they know how dangerous that is? Anything could happen. Anyway, my potatoes were extremely hot! Hotter than anything else on the plate! \\n\\nThe food was okay but not worth the price even with the groupon. Maybe they're going for Nouvelle Cuisine but if so, the food needs to be tastier and more beautiful. As it was, it was just sparse, stingy and not very interesting.

Without any hesitation, Gina offered to have it redone and she comped us! Later on, I went and found Gina to thank her for help make our night, and she seem genuinely pleased. She was so happy to see that, this time, my friend had finished every bite of her food. We'll definitely be back. \\n\\nWe had the Primetime burger, Magic Shroom burger, a Mexican Coke, and a Skinny Dip (margarita). \\n\\nThe burgers were amazing, the margarita was amazing, and the Happy Hour deal is a steal: $5 for the seasonal burger (we didn't get that this time), or for any of the craft drinks. I strongly recommend the Primetime burger, it's seriously so good. \\n\\nThe system is super cool: you get in line to order at the kitchen, you're assigned a table number while you're in line, and then your food is brought to you.

They brought out olive oil and good parmesean cheese with bread.  It was delicious.  I ordered their special - tilapia prepared with a basil caper butter and my husband ordered the salmon after read several reviews on yelp.  It was supposed to be salmon in mustard sauce.  My tilapia came out cooked well but it was battered and fried (which I wasn't expecting from the description).  It was good but nothing to write home about.  It was served with some mashed potatoes and sauteed veggies.  The veggies were cooked very well.  Everything tasted fine - no complaints but no raves either.  My husband's salmon had this really REALLY thick bernaise type sauce on it with the slightest hint of mustard.  I wouldn't have called it a mustard sauce if  I hadn't read it.  He ate like 3 bites and said it was too rich so we packed up our food and took it home.

The small menu and the prices are really why we hadn't been before. And we didn't know if they would be happy to make vegan dishes or not. \\n\\nWe had a really nice dinner there, I posted photos of everything. It is very NON traditional Thai food. Most of the items are things I'd never heard of. I see what the chef is doing, trying to distinguish this place from every other Thai place, but I wish they had more options for curry. \\n\\nWe got some sort of deep friend tempura greens, mushrooms and vegetables to start. It was really different. It was cold by the time we got it so a little hard and too tough to eat. \\n\\nThe Tom Kha mushroom soup was pretty good. Lots of mushrooms, but they were giant and stringy and really really messy to eat. It was embarrassing to be chewing on giant stringy mushrooms getting splashed and trying to rip them apart while wearing a nice dress. This is inconsiderate. They should be sliced smaller if you expect people to share and eat out of tiny side bowls and have no knives. \\n\\nThe banana blossom salad was really flavourful and tasty, my only gripe is that it is super oily and this is unnecessary. \\n\\nThe stir fried eggplant we got was almost inedible. It was still spongy and undercooked and WAAAY too salty. Maybe this was because it was vegan and they used soy sauce or something instead. We had to send it back.  They replaced it with Pad Thai.  The Pad Thai is really good here, I would get it again. \\n\\nThe curry we got just had baby corn and green beans in it. I don't think they have a lot of vegetables to offer for vegetarians as this would not be my choice of filling. They are so low calorie and not as delicious as squash, potatoes, yams, and other veggies. I was disappointed and felt like we were given a dish just without the meat and nothing else to bulk it up. \\n\\nThe dessert was interesting. It was made just for us.  Some canned lychees and other asian fruits in a coconut syrup with coconut ice freshly made.  It was neat to try. I liked the ice, but canned fruit is way too sweet and was a little much to eat it all. \\n\\nI'm glad that they tried here, it was very nice.

Mysteriously, a friend and I got food poisoning from soup - soup! It was a vegetarian bisque... I don't even know how we got sick from that...\\n\\nThe servers are nice, the hostesses are awkward and unfriendly, and the bartenders can be weird. Not necessarily rude, but definitely not nice. \\n\\nA few of us went for drinks one day and a friend asked for a bit of tomato juice or bloody mary mix in his beer (it's common to do that in the Southwestern states where we're from.) After WAY too much confusion (my friend had even tried to nix the request - it wasn't worth the hassle - but the bartender had already gotten the manager. Total overkill) he finally got his splash of bloody mary mix. When we got the bill, they had charged him for a full bloody mary! $10 for a splash of juice. We tried fighting it, but it just became too much of a mess and we had somewhere to be, so we split the cost among us so it wasn't too painful for our friend and booked it out of there. I get it that it wasn't a request commonly heard here, but that was totally inappropriate and it was handled horribly.\\n\\nAlso, all the locks in the women's restroom are broken. You'd think since they're charging a dollar extra for all their beers these days, they could take some of that profit and fix the locks. Just a thought.\\n\\nI will add, even though no one's really a fan, we do still go here because it's close and the view is incredible, but no more special requests and NO ONE eats."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I've been here many times and can say it's one of the best places to get a hamburger.

We had the vegetarian dumplings, the tsel phaley, okra vegetarian dish, and beef with potatoes.  Although each of us had our own favorite dish, they were all excellent.

I visited La Mongerie due to raves from a colleague. Free mimosas and great food at a reasonable price?! Who could Pass that up? I will, next time. This place sucks monkey balls. \\n\\nMy first visit was on June 9 with my little sister who came to visit from California. I should have known better when I noticed wait staff bringing in food from the back of a car parked in front of the restaurant smh. I didn't think anything of it because hey they serve free mimosas and I can sip while I wait-WRONG. After our first mimosa we asked for another and were told they ran out of OJ. Are you serious?! Thats fine at least I got one and I'm still there with my sister enjoying her company. We finally got our food about an hour later. The food LOOKED great. My sister ordered the French toast with turkey bacon and grits; I had the sweet potato pancakes, scrambled eggs and soy sausage. When she bit into her turkey bacon it was cold and my pancakes were half cooked. Bummer!! At least the soy sausage and eggs were good. I told the server about the issue they brought my sister fresh bacon, but told me it'd be another half hour before I got my pancakes. Ummm no thanks take it off my check. No apologies or nothing. When we went to pay they left us with an iPad to swipe and sign but there was no receipt. UMMMMMM what if I wanted a receipt? Or better yet, what if I'm not tech savvy? Shouldn't you make sure the server stays to answer questions if needed? Guess not. \\n\\nNeedless to say, my first experience was not a good one but it wasn't terrible. I wanted to go back because hey, maybe they were having a bad day, right? NO. My second trip was even worse!!!!!! \\n\\nToday my friend and I went and were sat outside by the hostess who seemed pretty flustered. She brought out water, no straws no silverware and did not ask us if we wanted anything else to drink. We finally get an opportunity to ask for mimosas and she told us to wait because they ran out of glasses, but 5 minutes later served our drinks to a table that was seated after us. 20 minutes later we are still waiting for our drinks and to place an order, a server look me dead in my face and takes the order of a table that was just seated! For real?! Mind you, this occurs right after a single gentleman got up to leave because he was seated and not served water or anything for a good 15 minutes. My friend and I left.\\n\\nNo food is good enough to wait through PISS POOR service. We ran into 3 folks at Cafe Intermezzo that looked familiar. Why? Because we saw them leaving La Mongerie prior to us being seated for the HORRIBLE service we received there. Guess they left because of poor service too.

I understand maybe he was trying to be conscious about tipping, but there's no excuse for it taking that long.\\n\\nWhen the cheesecake finally came to the table, our server had brought spoons with it instead of forks.

Suffice it to say, we're sorry it took us so long because we had a delightful and delicious lunch.\\n\\nThe place is tucked away off a main drag but far removed so that it seems somewhat hidden and therefore a little magical especially when eating outside in the back.\\n\\nThis is both a deli-restaurant as well as a gift shop. Somehow melding both these things works in a quirky kind of way.  It's is adorable inside with all kinds of kitschy, country-ish things for sale in the gift shop portion.  These things are not my particular style but worth a browse.  In the main deli section there is a big blackboard wall with a colorful list of all the sandwiches. It's a lot to take in and took us a few minutes to decide which of the delectable choices we wanted.  \\nI chose The Columbus which was slices of hot ham and prosciutto.  You have a choice of bread and I chose their signature scali roll.\\nI think my husband had a reuben...it was something with sauerkraut inside. He loved his sandwich.  \\nWhile the prosciutto on my sandwich could have been sliced a bit thinner, overall it was a delicious and well-filled sandwich.  It was more than I could eat in one sitting so  I got to take half of it home for later.  It was served with a briny pickle spear.\\nThere isn't a lot of seating.  There are several tables inside the deli and a couple outside.  I am guessing they do a brisk take-out business. \\nWe opted to eat outside and we were so glad we did. The back overlooks a gorgeous vegetable garden...and get this...you can pick a tomato or zucchini to eat or take home if you find one ripe....donations appreciated.  There was a table nearby on which some zucchini and tomatoes had already been picked....for the taking.\\nWe have our own garden lush growing at home so we left the veggies for others...but what a generous and beautiful touch.  \\n\\nYou order your sandwiches at the counter and someone will bring them out to you when they are made. There are an assortment of beverages and chips to buy as well along with a few desserts.\\n\\nWhen you're done eating you can walk across the courtyard and go look at the beautiful things in the pottery shop and in the stained glass shop.

I had no idea that Yelp was live in Canada, but it now is and he told me to Yelp away!\\n\\nWhile I love to Yelp, I knew that one day, my knowledge of my favorite eats would conflict with my desire to keep these places secret.  After all, I've seen Yelpers at Elite events!  You're a ravenous bunch with absolutely no fear of long lines out the door!  My favorite Canadian restaurants have, til now, been quiet places shared amongst friends and family and kept on a hidden Excel spreadsheet many years pre-Yelp.\\n\\n*sigh*  \\n\\nI absolutely love Canada and especially the greater Vancouver area.  The people are friendly, they speak English, the dollar used to be strong, the seafood is second to none, and they use the same voltage plugs that we do.  But more than anything, Vancouver is the Chinese mecca of food in the Western Hemisphere.  \\n\\nIn 1997, when China completed plans to take over Hong Kong, some of the best and the brightest chefs and cooks left Hong Kong and settled in Vancouver.  Many wealthy Hong Kong Chinese did the same, fearful of changes with the Communist government.  When they saw that little changed financially, they simply took their first class tickets and returned.  The chefs, waiters, cooks, etc. weren't blessed with such mobility and many settled in Vancouver and the Chinese restaurant industry exploded in Vancouver and neighboring areas like Richmond.  \\n\\nNeptune Restaurant is one such restaurant.  Consisting of two restaurants in one, Neptune is actually a high-end Seafood/Shark Fin and a casual Wonton Noodle restaurant next to each other.  \\n\\nAfter every flight or drive into Vancouver, Neptune Wonton Noodle restaurant is where we stop every time.  Their casual Hong Kong fare includes beef noodle soup, wonton noodle soup, and porridges.  The fare is true comfort food for my parents and the closest they can get to Hong Kong (Hong Kong Saigon is the closest in the Bay Area).\\n\\nThe absolute stand out dishes at Neptune though are two: the cold sesame and chili oil infused shrimp and the snake soup.  \\n\\nThe cold shrimp has an unbelievable taste that is like crack.  Once you start, it's impossible to stop eating them.  Incredibly fresh, savory, and spicy, I haven't seen this dish anywhere else.  \\n\\nThe snake soup is another wonderful item that includes gorgeous pieces of snake and a broth that is always piping hot.  It's a seasonal item (winter) and brings me back to eating snake soup when visiting the streets of Hong Kong as a child.  \\n\\nOverall, a stellar 5 stars.  The real kicker?  It's super affordable and all fare comes out within 10 minutes!     \\n\\nVancouver and Canada, welcome to Yelp.  I'm glad to see you here as you're a true foodie town.  I may write about pho, wax about ramen, and savor eating sushi, but Chinese food is my true and original passion.  In Vancouver, you shine."},{"name":"The Cowfish - Atlanta","address":"4400 Ashford Dunwoody Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I first visited Cowfish for a Yelp Elite event and loved the concept of having both sushi and burgers!

I went Thursday morning at 9 am to be told they had sold out of bacon the previous night.  I don't want to hear that in a breakfast restaurant.  I was offered turkey bacon.  TURKEY IS NOT BACON!!! \\n\\nI decided not to order and come back the next day.  I went to the counter and looked at the pastries for sale. A couple were full and clearly new (or not liked), and then there were all these single items. I asked the waiter if they were from yesterday, and he admitted that some of the pastries were on their last day and some only come in twice a week.  That grossed me out in a BAKERY.\\n\\nSo I bought a blondie and headed to my car to just find a new place to head. But I was taking so long on my phone, the cook came out to my car and said she had heard me ordering the blueberry pancakes and already dropped them, so I could have them with bacon for free.  Okay, that's an unnecessary and very good customer service gesture.  \\n\\nI was given the food to go, and ate at home.  However, (and I know, how do you complain about free food?), the pancakes were overdone to almost burnt and the bacon was half raw.  I had to finish cooking the bacon at home and it was still very fatty bacon.  \\n\\nI appreciate the free breakfast, guys.  But this place needs quality control.\\n\\nOh, and the part that pissed me off, though with the free breakfast I must now rescind and not care about is my bill was four bucks for the blondie. I have at this point had no breakfast and decided to leave. I give the guy a fiver and he says, \\"Thank you.\\"  and gives me no change.  Um, did you really just give yourself a tip?

Then, as I approach the front door on Temple, I feel an idiotic grin appear on my face. It spreads to an equally-if-not-more stupid smile as I walk in and find a place in line, until finally I'm reduced to a blubbering imbecile when it's time for me to give my order to one of  the very kind and very patient women behind the counter.\\n\\nI'll try not to sound like a Wendy's commercial from 1992, but what makes Herrera's great is the ingredients. I don't know what time they actually start cooking things like the steak, chicken, or pork,  but  when a customer witnesses either of those three ingredients are taken out of the warming pan and liberally applied to a slathering of yellow rice and your choice of cilantro infused black beans or onion-tinged red beans, one could swear they were pulled right off the grill. The same applies to the veggie burrito. I tried one just after finding out (ie stumbling upon) about Herrera's and lemme tell you, although the pepper'/mushroom/zucchini medley was grilled, there was still a nice amount of crunch to it. I like that since limp, cooked vegetables are generally greasy and makes me want to hurt an elephant.\\n\\nWhy an elephant? Because 'Dumbo' made me cry when I was four years old and I have never forgiven Walt Disney Studios nor those peripatetic pachyderms since.\\n\\nWhy I can't give Herrera's the magical fifth star might strike some as being petty, but I'll be honest, it hurts me not to do so. Hurts deep. Inside.\\n\\nMy first complaint is the quality of the horchata. Man, I've tried the stuff three times (the third time because I was convinced that because the joint was so incredibly busy, that might've affected the quality of the stuff the first two times I tried it. Why? I have no idea, but I do have a tendency to fooling myself into making excuses for places that have one bad item which doesn't jive with the rest of their wonderfullness. Much like driving a Corvette that leaks oil; it's still a Corvette, right? So stop bitching already)\\n\\nAnyway, to put it simply: the horchata is weak and chalky. REALLY chalky. \\n\\nGod that hurts to say.\\n\\nThe second complaining is that Herrera's closes at, like, 4 PM. I mean, freakin'-A. That's the PERFECT stop if you're on your way to catch a flick at the Boston Common Loewe's and just want a tide-me-over before sitting for two hours in order to watch the pinnacle of acting talent that is Renee Zellwegger pucker her way through yet another comedic tear-jerker whose plot derives from the plucky feel-good story of a nobody who's man has done-her-wrong and yet, by the grace of God and a six pack of Schlitz, she pulls herself out of her funk and dates somebody else who the viewer knows will end up treating her like the first guy did because everything about Renee Zellwegger projects 'doormat'.\\n\\nA great burrito from Herrera's would help you through that pain."},{"name":"The COOP: A Southern Affair","address":"610 W Morse Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"Love The Coop.

While I also consider myself a 4 Rivers fan, I can safely say that I won't be joining the hype train for The COOP.  From the mediocre service to the disappointing food, my experience at COOP was not at all what I was expecting from a 4 Rivers family restaurant.\\n\\nThe building itself is absolutely adorable, and it is furnished with delightfully eclectic Southern charm; the mismatched chairs and tables and the framed, chicken coop inspired art are fantastic.  The dining area is very spacious with even more seating available on the patio out back.  My only real issue was that all of the tables that I could see were for four people or more: it felt wasteful to go there with just two people and not have any smaller tables to sit at so that we didn't feel like we were taking a space meant for a larger party.  And while having the drinks on ice available for you to grab while in line is a quant idea, I saw someone walk up from their table and grab a drink, then go sit back down again without paying for it, so keeping this in an area that is easier to police might be better for business.\\n\\nWhen we got to the counter the workers were inattentive, talking to each other instead of addressing the customers while on the line.  We were given sides we didn't order because line server wasn't paying attention, despite the fact that the first server we spoke with wrote our order down on the tray liner.  The food on the line didn't look fresh or appetizing, which kept me from ordering some things that I might have otherwise tried.  Many dishes were nearing empty and hadn't been changed out for fresh food, as well.\\n\\nMy biggest issue with my trip to The COOP was that this is a chicken joint, a place whose namesake is inspired by chicken, and the chicken itself was the biggest disappointment.  I fully expected that their signature dish would be made and served fresh, but mine came right out of a warmer that it had been in for who knows how long.  The batter on the outside was soggy and overly peppery, and the meat on the inside was dry.  While the mac and cheese was the only thing I actually enjoyed because it was creamy and flavorful, there wasn't anything special about it that made me want to come back for more.\\n\\nThe other sides that we ordered were all very disappointing: the mashed potatoes were pasty, the gravy had an odd flavor that was off-putting (it sort of tasted like carrots, maybe it's made with a vegetable stock?), the biscuits were burnt / overcooked on top and raw toward the bottom and on the inside, and the hush puppies and cornbread were both very dry.\\n\\nI'm not usually one to have leftovers, but I didn't even eat my second piece of chicken and I ended up leaving my take away in a friend's fridge because I knew that I wouldn't want to eat it once I got home, either.  Unless I was told that there were major changes made here, I am almost certain to never return to The COOP."},{"name":"The Local","address":"758 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"5 stars for their buffalo wings.

You need to get here NOW!  Come with a few friends and order everything.  Seriously order everything and share with your friends.  The food is amazing.  You will be disappointed when your neighbor orders something you didn't.  The smells alone will kill you.  Order everything.  Give yourself about an hour to 2 hours for a great evening.\\n\\nBarley has 26 table seats and 5 seats at the bar.  They do not take reservations but if you show up and there is no room they will call you when they have an opening coming up.  Service was really great.  They encourage you to take your time which was nice.  Our server took our complete order and made sure we didn't want for anything.  There were no seats at the bar so we sat at a cozy 6 top and eventually other guests came and joined us.  While I hated being so close/cramped at 24 Diner it felt so comfortable to be paired up with strangers here at Barley Swine.  It was so relaxed that we were getting our dishes prior to the others and we showed them what we had and we all spoke comfortably with each other.  I even shared some of my beer in an effort to convince them to also order it.  The Local 2 is what I shared with them.  It was recommended as a palate cleanser prior to our mains.  It is such a lite but tasty and sparkling ale.  I already located it at Spec's.  Do yourself a favor and order this.\\n\\nThe food is so well thought out and just sings.  Every dish we tried was delicious.  We ordered three starters: ricotta dumplings, broccoli, cumin crumbs, spicy garlic; spice grilled carrots, goat feta, smoked almond vinaigrette; potato fritters, goat cheese, leek espelette.  Every bite was followed up with a smile.  I am not big on broccoli but they managed to get me to eat it.  We had the Rare Vos with our starters.  For our mains we ordered: grilled strip loin of beef, snails, capers, onion puree and barley, foie gras, duck sausage, mushroom, sweet and sour onion.  Wow!  We had the Local 2 at this point of the meal.  It was amazing with the beef and even the duck sausage.  I tried but I just couldn't do the foie...  I told myself I was going to do it but I am a slave to texture first and couldn't do it.  Luckily that meant my buddy could enjoy more of it.  He loved it and raved about the taste.\\n\\nOur server paced out our evening and we never really waited long for anything.  She knew when to fire them and she took great care of us.  We finished with:  goat cheese, fennel, saffron, orange and a Real Ale coffee porter float made with a house made pecan ice cream.  The pecan ice cream is so rich and creamy and is perfectly paired up with Real Ale's seasonal offering of their coffee porter.  Barley Swine has it as one of their drafts.  They have several (eight) great draft selections as well as many 750 ml offerings to be shared.  Every selection...both food, beer and wine have been carefully chosen.  As comfortable of a place as Barley Swine is you get a feeling of such detailed thought and dedication given to everything under the roof.  Maybe I am overreaching with that but that's the impression I get.  We rallied with a final beer selection of Old Rasputin...we finished heavy.  Our final tab was for $116.  Just like anywhere when you start adding beer or wine you can rack it up quick.  Half + of our tab was beer. \\n\\nBased on the food I enjoyed at the Odd Duck I knew I was in for a treat.  Bryce Gilmore continues to buy and serve local and small independents as he does at OD.  I have been excited about the opening of Barley Swine.  I wasn't alone.  There were 6 food bloggers waiting to get in at 4:30 and a few others came who were also eager to get in.  They are only open for dinner service get there as soon as you can."},{"name":"Truva Turkish Kitchen","address":"60 Andrew Young International Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place was amazing. Went while at DragonCon around 7 pm on Friday night and did not have to wait. Only had a couple appetizers and a glad of wine so I could get back to the festivities. And after walking and standing all day, the pillows in the booth were a much welcomed surprise. I had the hydaria yogurt dip and the lamb/beef cigars (lamb/beef mixture with some shredded carrots and another veggie wrapped in phyllo dough and fried). They also brought bread and olive oil with spices and basalmic vinegrette for dipping. The wine selection was moderate, but found something delish. The waiter Kaleb was so nice and friendly. I want there too long and the belly dancer (who is very technically trained and interacted with the crowd very well) came out twice (once right as the bill was brought). I'd love to have more time to go back for dinner. P.S. - there were a couple Kalamata olives on the plates that were not pitted. I prefer them this way as when the machines remove the pits, sometimes a little sliver of pit is left behind and is not very nice. *Note: when you enter, you do have to go up the elevator to the restaurant, else you are only inside the steakhouse downstairs, which is a different restaurant."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I came here for brunch with the girls on a weekend, and as expected there was a line up.

Unfortunately, it was just a sad pile of lettuce, beans, pico de gallo, chicken, and dressing.  Fortunately, it was delicious.  Actually, really delicious.  So delicious that I may dream about it until tomorrow's breakfast.  Everything was full of flavor from the chicken to even the beans.  The chicken didn't have that old chicken \\"funk\\" it gets when it isn't freshly cooked and the lettuce was fresh and crisp.  Overall, a pretty good meal to make for a pretty good evening.\\n\\nNext time, i'll be sure to get one of their burritos although I have seen them and they are rather on the smaller side.

Despite having a 7pm reservation and arriving at 7pm, we were told it would be at least a 25-min wait and a reservation \\"didn't guarantee anything\\". One hour later, we were seated, 10 minutes later we ordered drinks (which arrived AFTER our food) and after the last straw of difficulty splitting the bill, we asked for the manager to come over. She was incredibly defensive, saying it was a \\"Groupon event night\\" and they were slammed -- had that been told to us when we made the reservation, we would have come a different night. She mentioned how the staff looked forward to us coming every year, yet didn't offer to make any amends to our bill to make up for the poor experience until we flat-out asked her to.

The booths sell overpriced touristy items, and by overpriced I mean a Ye Olde Rustic Christmas tree made out of scrap pieces of wood for $120! There's a lovely carousel, but nothing much else for the kids. The only reason I'm giving this one star is that the food was good - we had the bratwurst and seriously considered going back for seconds, or trying out the pork hocks. We ended up getting the pretzels - okay, but not the best I've ever had. The problem, though, is that there's nowhere to sit and eat, which is ridiculous when people are trying to carry plates of food or bread bowls of soup. All that's available is stand-up counters. They desperately need some heated tents and sit-down tables. We were so cold that we got some unbelievably terrible coffee - more expensive than Starbucks, and no lids for the cups, no stir sticks, nothing except sugar cubes and cream.

I ordered the bulgar barley burger, my wife ordered the mushroom ravioli and our friend had the turkey burger. I tried some of each dish. The fries were good, though I am not a big fan of sweet potato fries. My burger was pretty bland. If it were not for the standard burger veggies that accompanied it the dish would have been tasteless. The ravioli had the taste and texture of previously frozen, store bought ravioli. The turkey burger was ok, but not great, fortunately this one was flavored with maple, so it, having one of my favorite flavors, won the best dish of our table award.\\n\\nNow the hit. My wife and I went back recently (the second of my visits). We ordered drinks, and after a while of drinking, we decided that splitting an entree might be worth a try.

As a recent convert to vegetarianism (I fully blame my doctor,) I thought their original Janis Joplin burger patty was *amazing*. They replaced it with a new veggie patty which is quite tasty but not amazing. I guess it has more \\"broad\\" appeal being black bean-based, rather than a \\"hemp\\" (horrors!) base, which I suppose appeases the less \\"adventurous\\" diners - a.k.a. those of you responsible for us not being able to have nice things. \\n\\n2. The counter service means lines out the door and around the building. While I understand the compromise of counter service and think it makes sense in many cases, the table turn over rate and the total number of tables seems to be the main problem here, not the speed of service (which is friendly and on the ball) or the food prep (which is quite zippy). The wait time is simply just not worth it at peak hours. If you have more than 2 people with you - just forget about it.\\n\\n3. They allow to-go orders, but you have to get in the *same* line for it and you can't call ahead. What? Just. What? Let us call it in! Better yet, allow online orders and take our cards upfront and provide curbside pickup - you can even do a padded time estimate and make to-go orders a lower priority than in house if you are worried about causing delays. You'd shorten the line, increase table turn over and make everyone happy.\\n\\n4. You feel like a tool every time you try to say the name.\\n\\nOkay, enough whining. The burgers are awesome (I loved the Poblano, the Diablo, the Greek and the Ahi Tuna burgers back when I was allowed to eat meat,) the Green Chili Fries are great and the Salted Caramel shake is so very good. Go before the lunch rush or around 2:30 to on a weekday to skip the crowd.\\n\\nRats now I'm craving one of their burgers but it's 6:45 on Friday and I just don't want to wait that long...

The space is so small you can barely move and once you sit down all of the chairs are bumping in to each other-which is quite annoying!  On top of that our table was unsteady so anytime we touched it drinks were spilling everywhere.   No one enjoyed their meals (overly salted pasta with watery clam sauce and rubbery veal piccata) but I was the only one who said anything about it (shame on me which I learned)!   The lobster ravioli with vodka sauce I ordered was inedible! The filling was very very dry and the sparse amount of sauce was certainly not a vodka sauce.  The waitress came over right after we took our first bites and asked how everything was ... not even being able to judge at that point I said \\"ok\\".  Realizing after bite two and three how horrible the dish was I didn't touch anything else on my plate. She never came back to check on us which would have been nice because I likely would've ordered something else.   At that point I knew I was going to leave hungry and have to find food elsewhere.     Another waitress came to clear our table.  When she asked how our food was I looked at her and said: \\"it was really bad\\" ...  she looked right back at me, took my plate, didn't say anything and walked away.  We were baffled that she had no response.  It was comical at this point.  For such a small restaurant it can't be that hard to be attentive to what is going on at your tables.  Clearly waitress #2 who cleared our table did not say anything to our first waitress because the bill came quickly and my meal was still on the check. When I got up to tell our waitress that my meal was very bad she told me that my opportunity to tell her that was when she came to first check on us - then she had the audacity to say that it is my fault that I didn't tell her at that moment. She was so rude and condescending!!!!  She would never last a day in a fine dining establishment with that rancid attitude!!! The table next to us (which was not even 2 feet away) stopped to look up at her during this conversation because it I was so ridiculous (and they could hear every word).  She continued to tell me that I had my opportunity when she first came over and that is when I should've told her.  Like I have never dined out before... I don't need your advice on when I should say your food sucks!    Her professionalism was nonexistent and it baffles me that someone like her works in the service industry.  She was scolding me like a child for the timing of my complaint.  She had to have the last word.

Everything I tried at Schmidt's, from the beer to the sausage to the cream puffs, was delicious! \\n\\nI love when places have samplers, because it is a great way to try a lil bit of everything! The beer sampler gives you a variety of the beers that they feature on tap. You get about a shot of each, more or less. The glasses come in a cool holder with a card explaining a bit about each one. They are also arranged from light to heavy. Nice! \\n\\nOf course we ordered the sausage platter as well. WOW! Great flavors, great texture. I thought everything we tried was really, really good! I'm definitely a fan. All the mustards on the table were really great too, as I tried them all on my sausages! \\n\\nWe also ordered the sauerkraut balls.

We selected this place for a special dinner for our anniversary, since it was close to our hotel and it had gotten a fair number of good reviews and we like seafood.  It wasn't that the restaurant was bad - it wasn't - it was okay.  It's just that with their pretentiousness and the prices they charge, it should be really, really good, and it just wasn't.  We had crabcakes for an appetizer.  They were actually pretty good, but they were $16 for one ... and so we got two for $32.  And again, they were pretty good.  But before going to the restaurant, we had a drink at the hotel bar where we're staying, and we also got an order of crabcakes there  - three for $8.00.  Our hotel crabcakes were better than those at the Coast!  I ordered mahi mahi, and it was okay.  (But the tilapia filets I buy at Costco are about as good.)  It came with a very small amount of fresh veggies, which were once again, okay (but there really weren't enough ... and did I mention they don't even give you bread).  V ordered their special, which was sable fish.  And she liked it.  (But she didn't rave about it.)  Overall, it was okay.  But here's the thing.  It was probably in the top five of most expensive restaurant meals I've had.  But it wasn't in the top 400 or 500 of the best restaurant meals I've had.\\n\\nOh, and I didn't mention the seating.  We were against a back wall, which was lined with tables for two.  I think there were five tables in total, and we were in the middle.  There were two other couples on both ends, so the tables on either side of us were vacant.

Then someone was so excited about cheesy tots, as they no longer will sell them in CA (probably due to everyone being concerned about gluten), but those were so over cooked they were not cheesy. Just dry and tasteless.

The food is good but not great, but that's reflected in the prices - it's very reasonably priced, perhaps at the expense of keeping the food from being of higher quality, but, it's decent French bistro food. Still, we usually leave saying it was \\"good, but not amazing.\\"\\n\\nWe've tried practically the entire menu over all of our visits, but the items we've ordered with the most frequency would be the steak frites and the duck confit, staples of any French bistro menu. The steak frites is usually pretty good, nicely cooked with your choice of a couple different sauces or a mustard butter, I usually go for the butter which gives it some more richness and doesn't overpower the flavour of the steak. The duck confit is good, but a bit underseasoned and I wish they would crisp it up a bit more before serving it. It also comes on a mountain of salad greens. On our last visit we also ordered the salade nicoise, which was good, but again served with a mountain of salad greens with some very fishy tuna confit. I wish they would include some green beans as per classic salade nicoise, but again, it was pretty good. Grilled tuna would be better but this would drive the price up. They have a nice selection of cocktails and french wines, as well as local beers on tap as well as imported French beers.\\n\\nWhere LFB excels is the atmosphere and the service, it's impeccable. The servers are attentive and friendly, and the interior is great - with the wood paneling and mid-century modern brass fixtures you could imagine yourself in France in the 70s. It's a decent size, and they make use of the space very well, with quite a few banquettes along the walls and a strip of smaller tables for two up the middle. If you sit in the middle, be prepared to be bumped by servers and other guests as they make their way through the narrow space. However, you can request tables when you call to reserve, so I'd recommend asking for one of the tables in the windows or along the walls.\\n\\nSo, a good experience and we'll probably be back.

DELICIOUS"},{"name":"Verde Cocina","address":"524 NW 14th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been here once before when I was last in Portland while doing a Forktown food tour, and again for dinner when I came here again. The first time I came I remember the food being fresh and good (I seem to remember eating a salad and mole enchilada type dish); the drinks were good but somewhat watered down in the juiciness and flavor - and I'm not a fan of premixed margaritas either!\\n\\nThis time while in Portland, I stumbled upon Verde while searching for a place that was paleo friendly (not just gluten free like last time). We booked a dinner reservation on OpenTable last minute on a Friday night easily. We ordered a couple rounds of drinks, starters and a couple entrees.\\n\\nTo start, we got the shrimp aguachile, guacamole with veggie sticks, and plantains. The shrimp aguachile was very good and same with the guacamole; I just wish they included jicama sticks in their veggie sticks like their other appetizer cause they only gave carrot and cucumber sticks. The plantains we asked them to omit the sugar, but they still came out super sweet; I'd consider it more of a side dish or even dessert rather than an appetizer.\\n\\nThe paleo bowl with salmon was okay; the salmon was too cooked and the chimichurri style sauce was the best part, but it was hidden under everything in the bowl and didn't come with a lot. I asked for more, but I had to ask several times throughout my meal and didn't get it until my last two bites.\\n\\nFor drinks, I got the tamarind sour and the Maria Feliz. They were good, but I would switch the ice style for those two drinks; the bourbon drink was diluted with many small ice cubes while the mezcal drink had one big ice block that mellowed it out. \\n\\nOverall good experience with somewhat spotty service. I'd consider this a good place for happy hour drinks and snacks, but wouldn't go too far out of my way to come back while in Portland."},{"name":"Hooters","address":"209 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"This location is absolutely horrible.

Being from a much larger city that I significantly busier than this location and to receive such terrible service is a shock. On top of being late, they messed up my order and didn't even include dressing for my salad. The \\"shrimp and spinach salad\\" was basically just plain spinach with 3 pieces of shrimp. Come on!

I didn't see any noticeable signs indicating its location - just saw a valet, chose that one - the wrong one, and tried another to find The Painted Pin. This place definitely wants to come across as a \\"upscale\\" and perhaps a bit preppy.  \\n\\nThe interior is fairly attractive. There are plenty of flat screens, a large bar and several other games to play besides bowling. The bathrooms are strange. There is no wall between the sinks in the men's and lady's bathrooms so you can be washing your hands and look up and see another person. Clever, I suppose, but it's certainly weird. \\n\\nHere's what you should in deciding whether or not you want to visit: \\n\\nMost bowling alleys will charge per game, the Painted Pin charges $35 an hour with a maximum of 6 players a lane, plus $4.50 for shoes. When you work it out, that turns out to be quite a bit more than what you would pay a typical bowling alley. In addition, once your hour is up, it's up. Your game is shut down. Now, in a sense, that's not a bad thing because you don't want to be charged an additional $35 for a few minutes of play, but there is no reason whatsoever they couldn't sell time in 5 - 10 minute increments. \\n\\nThe seating is very cramped. There are couches and a table for each pair of lanes, but very little leg room. This leads to stepping over people and people constantly having to get up and sit down as different players take their turn. They really should consider putting in smaller tables or something because every single person in our party remarked about how inconvenient it was. \\n\\nI had the pepperoni pizza which was pretty good, and by that I mean better than Papa John's, Pizza Hut, etc., and approximately on par with any random pizzeria in town. There were some other items on the menu that looked good like the ribs, grilled corn, tacos and waffle dog but I wasn't able to try those. The food isn't super expensive, but not cheap, either. We paid $13.50 for what was basically a small pepperoni pizza - not terrible, considering it could easily feed two normal people. The service is pretty good. They will deliver your shoes to your table and put your names in the computer for you. Our waitress was friendly, quick, made recommendations and in general did her job.  \\n\\nIn conclusion, the Painted Pin is a fun, neat place to go to but if you're not careful you will end up spending a lot money. If you have some extra money or live in the area, check it out. Three stars.\\n\\nPros: Attractive interior, friendly service, decent food.\\n\\nCons: The seating arrangement in the lanes make it very uncomfortable to get up and move around. \\n\\nVerdict: Recommended"},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Really enjoyed the atmosphere.

There's a big patio in back that looks very nice. The inside of Bartaco is good too: tables are close together since the restaurant's space isn't huge, there's a good-sized bar and the decor looks modern and trendy - just the kind of place you'd want to hang out at for happy hour or a quick bite.\\n\\nAnyway, as soon as I sat down at the table with my dining companion, our waiter descended on us and explained the lunch system: you can order a trio of tacos that comes with a salad for $10 or you can order a la carte from this other little menu they offer. For either menu, you mark on a little scorecard what you want, and that goes back to the kitchen as your order.\\n\\nBartaco has a number of vegetarian and gluten free options - all tacos come in corn tortillas made in house, they offer some rice bowls, and have a number of side dishes you can share like guacamole, spicy cucumber salad, fried plantains and more. \\n\\nI decided to get the lunch special: one fish taco, one chicken taco and one pork belly taco plus a little side salad. My friend got the curry shrimp rice bowl and spicy cucumber salad, plus a side of guacamole to share.\\n\\nIn no time at all the guacamole was out (and very tasty and chunky) and then the entrees arrived. I was very impressed with my three little tacos and the looks of the curry shrimp bowl too. Those little tacos, although they looked small, were extremely tasty - by the third, I was very pleasantly full and I'm really not sure which one I liked best - each had great flavors. I also had a bite of the spicy cucumber salad and it was a unique, zesty flavor too. All very good.\\n\\nOur waiter was great the whole time, answering questions, refilling water glasses and quickly getting our check when we asked for it. Very nice guy. \\n\\nAll in all, I was happy with Bartaco.

In addition to their hormone and antibiotic-free Black Angus beef (grass-fed is another $2), they offer lamb, bison, tuna, and even a bean patty. The toppings bring plenty of Texas flair and heat. I appreciated the Maine Root sodas and chipotle ketchup. Dessert-lovers will appreciate their homemade custard shakes, and foodies will enjoy their kale salad and truffle fries.

Cold and hungry, she excitedly mentioned a place she'd been wanting to try. Turns out, we were 1 block away and when we arrived we were immediately seated. Perfect!\\n\\nBoth in the mood for some warm soup, we were a bit disappointed to find out it was only a special dim sum menu, but our disappointed wore off as soon as we perused the menu items. We ended up settling on 5 shared items (listed in order of arrival):\\n1) a version of their nasi goreng** (indonesian fried rice - pork, shrimp, pineapple, farm egg): pretty sure ours didn't have pork or shrimp. It was DELICIOUS. Probably my favorite dish of the day (#2 is a close second, if not tied for first). So spicy, but so delicious!!\\n2) a chinese sausage omelette that doesn't appear on any of the online menus, which is a shame, as it was AMAZING.\\n3) mama chang's pork dumplings: these were tasty, but in comparison to everything else, not our favorite. I've had better dumplings, I've had worse. These had a very thin dough, so I felt they were more like gyozas. They were good - and we loved the dipping sauce (of which there was way more served than needed) - but everything else put them to shame.\\n4) pork belly buns (braised pork, steamed buns, hoisin, pickles): these were not the actual buns either of us expected. They were more like tacos, which ultimately resulted in us squishing the amazingly fluffy bun. Sad. The pork belly was tasty though. And I think they had beets, rather than pickles...\\n5) housemade daikon kimchee, soba noodles, cilantro***: This dish was interesting. The daikon was hard, which made us wonder if it was cooked at all. It was a very fresh-tasting meal, which we enjoyed after the yummy greasy-ness of the other dishes.\\n\\nNote: *** means spicy. My mouth was on fire, but in a good way.\\n\\nWe did get the complimentary Jasmine tea, which was way too bitter and floral for me. Rachel drank mine. (In hindsight, their sodas looked delicious.)\\n\\nOverall, the special dim sum menu turned out to be perfect for us, as we got to sample a bunch of different dishes and were sufficiently stuffed.

When her first response was \\"let's go to Chef Hung's\\", I immediately knew there's much promise in this food trip.  I virtually lived along the food stalls of Taipei's night market when I was briefly exiled there to learn the language.  In fact, I spent so much time price haggling and trading barbs in my haphazardly spoken, pygmy Mandarin with food stall vendors that I learned more Mandarin from them than I learned from the school I paid tuition to.  I can order skewers of barbequed things eloquently but I can't for the life of me tell you how old I am or what my hobbies are in Mandarin (and I have a Chinese name in Chinese characters to boot!).\\n\\nSo when I heard about his famous beef noodles and the Taiwanese chicken nuggets, I was stoked.  In addition to these, we ordered a braised pork dish on rice and none disappointed.  Everything was pretty great, well presented in a surprisingly airy, comfortable restaurant that had clean, modern lines in decor.  I still miss the traditional thin noodles from the stall vendors, almost similar to Cantonese thin egg noodles.  Chef Hung had their own version that I didn't fancy too much.  Other than that, it was great Taiwanese comfort food, at a higher price range than usual.

The deal was the pulled from the groupon website before its expiration so we couldn't purchase it again even though we were already finished with our meal.  We have had extensive conversations with the manager, clear that we only came because of the deal, and the manager refused to honor the groupon.  It was more important to him that we had a barcode and that groupon took a share of his revenue than it was for him to keep a higher percentage of the discount (instead of paying part to groupon) and retain a customer for the future.

I'm writing this review now because we went to Burnside brewing twice in one week and both times it was absolutely another disappointing service and I'm searching yelpers now to find a place to go tonight!.. Okay, the very first time I ever walked in here the service was really really bad and I gave it at least a dozen to twenty more tries because I thought it was just an off day for the server and I really enjoyed their honey fried chicken, but I can get fried chicken elsewhere or make it at home. I'm not about to overpay again for fried chicken, to be treated like crap from the servers. One star for food and one star for beer. If the food and beer alone were worth more stars I'd give more stars, but both are mediocre. Seriously, this place gets two stars. Yes, I am taking three stars away for customer service it is absolutely horrible, rude tone of voice, acting as if we are bothering them from walking in happy, to be honest I feel like it sooo wanna be so called high class hipster, that if you are of color, if you're in a group of people that are multiple races, they are extremely rude and you feel almost like you're out of place, which is really weird on Burnside in Portland Oregon!. Where there's multiple ethnicities and it shouldn't make a difference anyways. I hate to pull the race card but not sure what else it could be. Since, the one time I can ever remember actually be treated nice here was when it was just my daughter and I, both of us caucasian looking skin, and blonde hair. My daughter and I we were treated just fine from our male servicer, except for the disgusting guy in the kitchen was making tongue motions at my 16-years old at the time, this was two years ago. Yeah, disgusting right!? I should of stopped going here then and still tried it again!... Anyhow, they really only have one great beer which is the project ale, the food is extremely overpriced for the tiniest portion ever! $10 deviled eggs those must be made of gold. One time we went in there and they actually had decided not to serve us from the moment we walked in, we came in a group of about eight of us all of ethnicity, for a birthday party, first stop of the night about 7 or 8 pm trying to grab food and a drinks before we started our birthday party, none of us has had one drink at any other places prior to walking into Burnside brewery. The waitress approached the table letting us know she would not be serving all of us, how she determined whom she would not be serving is beyond me, because we had just walked in the door and like I said none of us has had one drop of drinks anywhere else, just happy woman! Immediately after her speech, I kindly said, \\"then we'd all be leaving now\\" and none of us ordered anything and left. I still went back to this place. I am not kidding the service is absolutely horrible. They make you feel bad don't go there unless you want to give your money to somebody that is rude condescending, talk to you like you're stupid and act like you're bothering them from the min you walk in the door. My last straw was this last Saturday when our waitress gave us the death look as soon as we walked in when asked if she could put together a table for 9. It all makes sense to me now though, why we had such poor service with the horrible tone, tone is everything, it's not what you say, it's how you say it's. She was surely to let us know, very rudely and very loudly and very direct and oh in a very rude way that everybody will be billed the extra 18% to their tab. Really chic, everybody knows that you pay gratuity on your own tab, however you should be earning your tip not expecting your tip and if you were rude to us from the beginning we walked in and that was the only thing that everybody heard, except yelling at my girlfriend, \\"I'm not to you yet, you need wait\\".  Tone is everything chic!!You're doing your job wrong lady!! She actually cut herself short because 18% 20% 25% if you're a good server. I will tip above and beyond and everyone of my party will tip above and everybody knows that if you're going to a restaurant you pay a percentage. Again, it not what you say, it's how you say it! Being in the hospitality industry myself there is no excuse for reoccurring bad service from multiple servers not just one bad apple. If you're happy and you're smiling too much, if your voice is a little loud, make sure you don't go here, this place is not for anybody that's in a good mood!

For example, while waiting in line, we passed right in front of the bar, and the friendly bartender there asked us what we'd like to drink. My BF ordered a bottle of Lone Star beer. All the burgers looked so delicious that we hadn't decided on which to order until right before we arrived at the register. So those 30 minutes went by quickly.  I wish places in LA would consider these kinds of things for waiting guests.\\n\\nWe decided to get the Primetime and the Magic Shroom burgers and split them in half so that we could each try both. Soooo glad we did!  \\n\\nThe Primetime: I thought this burger was pretty pricey. $12? Whoa! Those are LA prices! It promised to delight with its toppings of brie, truffle aioli, arugula, grilled onions, and steak sauce. I bit into it, and it was good, but not $12 good. I wanted more flavor impact from both the brie and the truffle aioli.\\n\\nThe Magic Shroom: This one was only $8.50, but ironically, the better burger! I'm a sucker for goat cheese, and this burger was loaded with it, as well as mushrooms, mayo, and basil pesto. Mmmm!\\n\\nOther Stuff: We also ordered the Nutella and chocolate pretzel shake. Holy cow! It was amazeballs! Creamy and chocolatey and just a touch of salty from the pretzels. I don't even like Nutella or chocolate pretzels all that much, but this shake was the perfect unison of two ingredients!  We split an order of the truffle fries, which were pretty good, but not stellar. I also enjoyed watching the food prepares bake the buns fresh from scratch!  Those buns were delish!\\n\\nHelpful Tips: Once you get inside, you should line up immediately and grab a menu. Once you pass in front of the bar, order a drink. Continue to peruse the menu. You will order and pay once you make it to the register. A waiter/waitress will hook you up with a particular table at which you will sit, by the time you arrive at the register, so no fighting for a table (another great consideration for waiting guests!).  \\n\\nThe Confusing Part: We weren't sure how to tip appropriately. There's a tip line on the receipt at the register, so who does that go to? Our server? The person who found us our table? Our cashier? Food preparers? Or does the restaurant split the tips evenly between all the staff? Then our server was awesome -- he hustled to bring us our food, as well as additional items we wanted, and to whisk away our dirty utensils/plates, so we felt we should leave a tip on the table specifically for him, but we didn't know if we already had. \\n\\nHopdoddy is a winner!"},{"name":"Verde Cocina","address":"524 NW 14th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Tonight, my experience at Verde Cocina was lovely.

Okay so I went to Hopdoddy after much hype and the huge crowds I'd been spotting there. After work on 3/26/13 I sauntered on in ready to be amazed by the Hopdoddy cuisine. I'd made it at a good time considering the number of sheeple I'm accustomed to experiencing when I've driven through the parking lot. I get right to line and one of the waitresses asked if I needed help? I explained it was my first time there and she showed me the wall of HD bliss(so I thought). I ordered the Greek for my Wife and the goodnight for myself. When I made it home I was excited to dig in as was my Wife. We washed up and sat down to dig in. We noticed the thickness of the patties, the nice bread and all the toppings........but something was off. I guess I'd liken it to how you see a car you've been wanting and you go see it in person, test drive it but something is off. Yeah perhaps a bit of an embellishment folks but here it is. We began to eat and I tell you Yelp family I didn't see nor understand even now the hype. Perhaps we chose the wrong burgers.........and for the price and quality they tout I figured the meat should have been less greasy. We both left about half our burger to the garbage. I hate wasting good because I grew up poor and know that every meal counts. Heck I'm still poor and know every meal counts. Sometimes though you just can't stomach anymore. We both were shocked at the lack of flavor in the food as well. So yeah MEH MEH MEH. We've eaten burgers much better around Austin. I'd say save your money or don't judge for yourself.

My buddy Andy helped facilitate our name getting on the list.  1 hour 15 minute wait, with this crowd...that did not seem bad.  We were lucky it was a nice day in February so waiting outside, where there are speakers to hear your name, was not bad.  There is a nice candy and fudge shop that is owned by the restaurant just a 2 second walk away so we headed over there.  We found out you could hear the names they were calling much clearer around this building.  We killed 30-45 minutes in there and was hoping we would be close to being called.  We see people coming out that we saw go in when we got there so we were ready.  Tick tock, tick tock.  Our 1 hour 15 minutes is up.  The sun goes down and it is time to head inside.  Stuffed to the gills.  No room in the small waiting area, but we make our in there anyway and fight the masses.  Our name is still like a page away.

The masaman curry would be better if the sweet potatoes weren't hard but they consistency never seem cooked through so we don't order it anymore.\\n\\nA bit of advice for Nisa:  please try to not be stingy with certain items.  For instance, they have really wonderful, refreshing Thai salads, such as the mango salad which consists of thin slices of ripe mango, red onion, tomatoes and iceberg lettuce for $8.95.  There's shrimp in it but that's a singular shrimp, and it's a small one.  You may think for $8.95, you're getting at least 2 pieces of shrimp but it's actually only one little shrimp that's been split in half to look like 2!  For $8.95 people!  Just think of the mark up this salad provides the owner.  Ditto with their Shrimp Pad Thai.  3 small pieces of shrimp so if you're sharing this dish with someone, you and your dining partner will have to divvy up that third tiny shrimp!  Come on Nisa.  \\n\\nOne more bone of contention is that the owner plays Fox News nonstop so while you're waiting for your order, there it is on tv blaring.  The owner often and unwisely engages her customers in discussions of politics and can't help but espouse her conservative, Republican viewpoint, which really displays poor business instincts on her part.  She's not a bad lady and is endearing in her own way, but she can't seem to help herself.

They have Spanish menus too.\\n\\nI no longer live in the area so I can't go as often as I used to, but I have absolutely no problem driving 40 minutes to eat there at least 2 or 3 times a month. The food is reasonably priced (we spend less money on a full meal there than we do eating fast food), the portions are huge (My boyfriend is one of those guys who can eat his weight in food and not gain a pound, yet we still only order one plate and share it with fried rice... And usually have a little bit left over for me to take to work with me the next day), and the food is delicious. I highly recommend going with a big group (4+ people) so you can order multiple plates and share. They serve you in one big plate with a HUGE portion and give you individual plates, which makes sharing really easy.\\n\\nAs other people have mentioned, it's in kind of a sketchy place, but it's really not as bad as it looks, and I've never had an issue there."},{"name":"Santarpio's Pizza","address":"111 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Next to Chicago style deep dish, this is the best pizza I've ever had.

I tried the raspberry caramel and lavender milk chocolate. The raspberry caramel was finger licking, lip smacking delicious.

However on this particular day the waitress must have had a bad day and decided to take it out on me. I had arrived before a friend and was told I wouldn't be seated until she arrived, which makes sense, it was not a problem. I was sitting there with only one other lady  in the waiting area sitting about four spots diagonally away from me when the host came by and called my name I looked up and he said \\"right this way\\" and before I could tell him I was still waiting for my friend he was already walking to the table, so I followed. When I got to my table the waitress was already in a mood with a rough \\"Hi\\". Came back a few minutes later to take my coffee order. I ordered for myself and my friend since I asked her what she wanted to drink. The waitress looked rather annoyed that I ordered for my friend too and just said okay and walked away. My friend arrived right after the coffee did and we started chatting as normal people do for about 2 minutes, when the waitress walks up and asks us \\"do you ladies have any questions about the menu?\\" We said \\"no\\" since we've been here many times before.  And without taking a second she responds \\"well, do you know what you want then?\\" In her exact words. We said \\"no\\" and you could see that we were looking at the menu still. But what bothered me more was her tone. Think Regina George talking to Gretchen. I've never had my order taken this way. From the time I sat down at the table to this encounter it had only been 11 minutes. I had checked the time I texted my friend to let her know I was seated see if I had really been sitting there for such a long time that the waitress would be that annoyed with us that she just had to really rush us out of there. All in all from when we were seated and left it was less than an hour. She messed up our bill and I guess she knew she wasn't going to get a tip so she sent the host over to collect.

I had bites of the BABY BEET SALAD (my fave of pretty much everything I ate), SPANAKOPITA (lighter, flakier and less oily than any other version I've ever had), DOLMADES (I don't think I like these in general, but these were slightly oily or something that I didn't like), and AHI TUNA (very light and delish! the mushrooms were unexpected but had a great tangy bite that somehow went really well with the sear on the tuna). \\n\\nOther people in my group ordered the cheese pie, zucchini fritters and Greek fries and everyone seemed really happy.\\n\\nEntrees: LAMB CHOPS: I actually wasn't a fan. They were really fatty and chewy and knowing how flavorful Greek spices are, I thought it could have been flavored much better.  The yogurt sauce was good but the chops themselves didn't cut it. When a friend asked how they were, I failed to notice that the waiter was also refilling my glass as I said it wasn't good. Given that it was my birthday and he was a fantastic, service-oriented person, he offered to replace it with the lamb pie. I had already eaten what I could of 1 of the chops and I was sharing with a friend, so I told him not to worry about it but he brought it out anyway.

It's not music related, but I agree with everything Alex G. said in his review.\\n\\nUnlike a few previous reviews, I found the service to be good.  However, the buffet did little for me.  The rice was perhaps better than most Indian buffets, served in a very large rice cooking vessel, but instead of pakora there was a hot plate with a label with \\"mixed\\" on it.  Taking the lid off, I saw two shapes of what was obviously some sort of frozen app. wrapped in dough and fried, so I quickly replaced the lid.  There were a number of vegetable dishes, but I only cared for one of them with carrot pieces and peas.\\n\\nI didn't find much if any seasoning in the dishes, but the onion chutney is one of the few surviving hot versions to be had in the city - it's been duly Americanized elsewhere, such as I.Q.  The chicken tandoori looked good, but was sadly as dry and tough as pretty much every other place in Boston.  The only chicken tandoori in Boston that I find actually edible is at Bukhara in J.P. - others welcome to submit their candidates.  I actually just did a search to find out why it is always dried out, suspecting that it was the cooking method.  I mostly saw hits on foodie sites claiming they had recipes to cook it so it wasn't dry and hard.\\n\\nWhen I went to pay my bill I noticed that they charged $11 for the buffet, minus the 15%.  However, the postcard I received said the weekday lunch buffet was $10, so I questioned them.  The manager said the postcards were sent 3-4 months ago, but I told him I'd received mine in September.  I'm guessing they were re-distributed then with the college ID offer to appeal to incoming students, but the manager had conveniently forgotten this.

While the atmosphere was a little cramped, the food and service absolutely make up for it to give you an authentic experience.\\n\\nWhen you drive up to Desta, you'll immediately know you're in the right place because of the sheer number of people waiting. For a Saturday night around 7PM, our party of four waited for 45 minutes to an hour before being seated. I noticed there were lots of families there, as well as a few larger parties, but the space is small and you'll mostly be waiting outside (buyer beware if there's rain!). We grabbed a few Ethiopian beers to pass the time, and before we knew it, were being seated. \\n\\nOur server, Mimi, was really helpful in assisting us with the menu, which also has a handy little legend on the side to describe some of the dishes. After some deliberation, the group decided on kitfo, meat lovers tibs (cooked \\"awaze\\", or as I interpreted it, pretty hot!), and miser, as well as salmon salad and shiro (this really thick chickpea stew). In full disclosure, I wasn't adventurous enough to try the daredevil kitfo (essentially a raw beef tartare with spices and injera- a spongy bread for dipping), but the rest of the group couldn't stop talking about it. Instead, I stuck with the salmon salad and shiro, which had incredible flavor and would be awesome in the colder months. The salmon salad was also amazing, with way, way, way more perfectly cooked salmon than I could ever eat. It should also be mentioned that everyone RAVED about the tibs (fresh fish, beef tenderloin, and ribeye), and among our group of 4, there was so much food to take home. \\n\\nOur total bill, including tip and a couple of beers each, was just over $100, which in the Atlanta area is just unheard of. We will absolutely be back to try some more of the dishes, and I would love to go during lunch when it might be a little bit slower!"},{"name":"Amrheins","address":"80 W Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been here twice and the food is pretty hit-or-miss from what I've experienced.

Everything was fantastic, but especially the burger with the fresh baked bun. \\n\\nSo yeah, it was worth the wait. I really really enjoyed the burger and I can say I've had good burgers in my life.

If I don't like a place, or have a not so pleasant experience, I usually just leave it alone.  But my experience there on Saturday evening has caused me to share my displeasure.\\n\\nThe majority of the reason that I gave this establishment 1 star, is because I never got in.  Not because it was closed.  Not because it was during Boston's Watergate of 2010, but because the staff there is made up of giant tools.   I'm generalizing based on 2 of the staff members that I encountered, but by reading other people's comments I see it tends to be a trend.   Before I further detail my experience, let me briefly describe the type of person I am in order for you not to think my judgment was clouded by my own immaturity. \\n\\nI never drank until I was 21 (I know, I was the life of the party).  I'm not obnoxious, belligerent, or confrontational.  I've been drunk maybe twice in my life and have only gotten sick once from drinking.  In general, I'm courteous, polite, and appreciative of people in service positions.\\n\\nIt was late on Saturday evening, and 5 or 6 of us approached Whiskey's.  I was last in line, and the bouncer at the front door let us all in.  The place was crowded, but the line was short.  I had a bottle of water with me which was rightfully taken away.  I was a little bit behind the rest of the crowd.  This was a little bit past midnight.  I had 2 beers all night, starting at 8:30, and I was very much sober.  Sober enough to prove it, speak civilly, and explain why I fumbled with my wallet. I suppose I fumbled a bit putting my license back into my wallet, as I keep both my student ID and my license in the same slot.\\n\\nA short (I'm short myself, so I'm not judging) HGH-enthused man approached me right away.  He was very official in his 2 sizes too small t-shirt that said staff on it and  his headset.  He said to me, \\"Sorry, we can't serve you any more tonight.\\"  I responded, \\"Well, you haven't served my anything at all, I'm just walking in.\\"\\n\\nThe man with the Napoleon complex began to argue with me, never making eye contact or paying attention to the words I said.  \\n\\nAs the man tried to use polite words, his reactions were something he probably learned in TIPS certification class (which I've attended myself) but never actually addressed the things I was saying.  He was relatively timid in his responses, but flexed his inflatable muscles at me to prove his self worth.\\n\\nI was not allowed to go in after my friends to tell them that I had not been let in.  It took me a while to get in contact with them, as you can imagine the level of noise in a crowded Boston bar.  I finally got a hold of my friends.  All of them were completely shocked given my reputation as a sober person.  They laughed a bit, but were even a bit upset at Whiskey's for having no ability to tell a drunk from a sober person.  They had bought themselves drinks already, so I waited outside as they finished their drinks and the drink they bought for me.\\n\\nAs I waited outside, I watched the bouncer let in every stumbling drunk that tried.  I stood besides him and made comments comparing my soberness with the slurring words of teens with fake IDs he let in.  Lance, is the bouncer's name.  It's clear that Lance works under my steroid friend.  Lance said, \\"Listen man, I can tell you're sober, but he must have seen something I didn't, so I'm sorry.\\"\\n\\nInstead of Lance being a gentleman and telling hulk hogan that he made a mistake, he stood there as I waited outside for my friends.  At this point, I could tell that HGH had also realized he made a mistake.  Instead of being apologetic, he could not admit that he was wrong.\\n\\nMy friends came out shortly after and found the whole situation ironic.  They came storming out pointed at me saying, \\"You wouldn't let this kid in?!   Seriously?!\\"\\n\\nAlso, my friend pointed out the individual sitting at the window table literally rolling a joint.  He was very animated and pointing at the man from outside.  \\"There's a guy literally right behind you rolling a giant spliff and you will not say anything to him?  You don't know that's going on?\\"\\n\\nLance refused to turn around or acknowledge what we were saying.  In filling out this review, yelp asks \\"Is this establishment smoking or non smoking.\\"  I was tempted to select that this establishment did allow smoking, but only of marijuana.\\n\\nRules of Whiskey's\\n\\n-No sober fun\\n-Illegal drugs are OK."},{"name":"Tassili's Raw Reality","address":"1059 Ralph D Abernathy Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"To say that this place is awesome would be an understatement.

The locals had seen a few start and miss. \\n\\nEnter Hopdaddy, a peculiarly monikered brews and burgers mash-up with an eye on the local artisan grub scene and a soft spot (at least on the night I ventured in) for anthropomorphic music photos. It's a heady mix, and though the process and product have changed for this spot (it works, if you're wondering), the nature of the local acoustics are the same as they ever were - there's a regular hum and chatter that comes not just from the crowd, but from the fact that there's really not a ton in here to dampen the conversations in real life surround sound. \\n\\nNevertheless, I never had vitriol for Cissi's, and the re-imagining of this space seems another happy incarnation for the aforementioned star-crossed space. The new ordering system may be a little different (I was slow on that one, so who knows, perhaps it was user error), but they were eager to please without heading into omnipresent.

I am a seafood fan who randomly ended up at Sea Level this past weekend, where oysters are a specialty, but I did not try any seafood. It had been a long day and I was starving. It was one of those moments when I needed a large, juicy burger to the face immediately in order to tame my Hangry-ness. Mission accomplished. \\n\\nI visited Salem with friends on our annual fall trip to enjoy the ghost tours and hunt for witches. We happened to park close to the wharf area and stumbled upon this restaurant completely by accident. I am giving Sea Level three and a half stars without having tried any seafood. My meal was good, but I have a feeling their seafood is even better. We had a great server named Anthony who was friendly and attentive. Our table was perfect as it had a beautiful view of the harbor at one angle, yet I could still catch the the Bruins game from the TVs above the bar. Sea Level has a casual yet classy and trendy type feel in an ideal location right on the water. \\n\\nThe fried pickles here are fantastic! Possibly the best I have ever had. We started our food fest with the pickles and an order of nachos. The nachos were decent and the burger I chose for my entree was as well. Not one of the best burgers I have ever had, but it hit the spot. I did not have any alcoholic beverages, but the beer/drink list seemed to be a little out of the ordinary in a good way. An oyster list was handed out along with the menu. Oysters can be purchased individually according to type. I have not had oysters in quite awhile, but believe this would be a good place to indulge as they seem highly knowledgeable in the oyster department. \\n\\nI'm sure Sea Level is a real hot spot in the warmer weather with its outdoor seating and upper deck.

I can't explain it, maybe you can.\\n\\nShowing my roommate around L5P during our visit to Atlanta to escape the cold of Chicago for a week, we began to get to that vaguely cranky point of hungry where you need to eat something to balance your blood sugar before you hulk out on a bitch. After juice at Arden's Garden, we looked around and saw our closest options were Sweet Lime and an Indian place up the block. We should have done Indian because when Indian sucks, it's the equivalent of getting a boring pizza but when sushi sucks, it's like WWIII in your mouth and you want to die.\\n\\nIn any case, I ordered a couple of make your own with inari, shitake, and avocado and 2 veggie tempura rolls. My girlfriend went with a rainbow roll, and a couple of basic single fish rolls (I forget which). My roommate, who was not feeling well, grabbed their crab cheese crispy rolls.\\n\\nProblem 1) was when our server tried to memorize our order but seemed to have trouble, coming back to check on what I wanted again before placing it. \\n\\nProblem 2) occurred when they had the crab cheese crispy rolls out in under 5 minutes and our server said, \\"It'll be a while on the sushi.\\" Well, why did you throw these into the fryer right away then?

Based on the plethora of positive feedback I was hoping for a wow-factor, however, in the end HopDoddy came up short.  In essence, this is a Yuppie Burger Bar where everything is high end and premium priced yet comes up way short in providing a bang for the burger buck.  In other words, they skimp on all the good stuff.  \\n\\nThis place is nice inside, I like the ambiance, it's a cool and hip place to be.  It's pretty wide open, so when it's busy it will be loud and you will easily hear other people's conversations.  The customer service was all good and friendly.     \\n\\nOrdering process can be confusing, but someone was there to help out.  You put your order in, they tell you your number, and you go to that respective table.  A group of us wanted to try a variety on the menu, we got the Lamb Burger (Greek) w/ fries, Magic Shroom, and Buffalo Bill - - all cut in half (no problem!).  An order of Chile Cheese Fries too, please, and 2 fountain drinks.  \\n\\nThey have all Maine soft drinks there (Root Beer, Orange, Lemon Lime, Cola), along w/ Dublin Dr. Pepper and Coca Cola.  They have a condiment center where you can get Chipotle Ketchup, Spicy Mustard, and BBQ sauce as well as bottles of ketchup, mayo, mustard.  There's also 2 types of pickles:  sweet and normal.  I like the selection and variety.  The Chipotle Ketchup didn't do much for me, I liked the mustard and sweet pickles for sure.  \\n\\nOur burgers arrived, I became riddled in disappointment.  In a nutshell:  a lot of bun, good toppings and taste, but way short on the meat.  I was picturing a large piece of meat - Casino style - that just burst out staring at you and instead the size was underwhelming compared to the price I was paying ($9+ a burger).  The fries were good, however, the Chile Cheese Fries are just a large basket of fries w/ a small styrofoam cup of chile cheese queso, and they only fill 2/3 of the cup.  Come on, guys, fill the damn cup up and stop skimping.  Overall the burgers did taste good, however, too much bread and not enough meat.  Not worth 9 bucks.  \\n\\nAs I looked around I noticed more of the same skimping theme, they serve beer in ice cold goblets with some of the biggest heads I've seen.  I used to work at a bar, and if I served beer with heads of foam as large as that I would get a lot of complaints.  Stop skimping on the good stuff and give it to us full throttle, we are paying for it.  \\n\\nFinal tab:  $38 and change.  Yeah, for 3 burgers, 1 chile fries, 1 side order of fries, and 2 drinks.  IMO I did not get my money's worth, and had the meat 'n queso n' beer portions been more robust I think this place could pull off 4 stars.

Located 1059 Alberni Street, Thierry offers many indoor and outside seating.\\n\\nTaste: the shells had an amazing texture; chewy and not crumbly in the slightest.  Although some were more airy than others, it was still considerably condensed.  The inside had a lot of filling (which I liked), and as you bite it it would ooze out a bit, but that's understandable since you just crushed the shell, the ooze holds and doesn't fall however as the consistency of the filling was thick enough to hold its own. \\n\\nFor the flavours I got one of each, from left to right they are: lychee, cassis, vanilla, gianduja, vanilla again, and lime.  Cassis and gianduja were my absolute favourite, it was harmonious.  The lime however, in my opinion, was not good.  The flavours didn't compliment well and were too strong.  Overall, I think the classics like chocolate and vanilla did better than their fruity flavour; they were just unnatural and were too overwhelming.\\n\\nAll the flavours were very potent and the macarons themselves were quite heavy, which isn't always a bad thing!  \\n\\nPrice: a box of 7 for $14.75, definitely pricey, probably the most I've ever spent on macarons.  But keep in mind that it's a lot more filling than other macarons; I ate three and I was already full. \\n\\nAmbiance: very classy interior designing.  The inside is very elegant and outside seating has wonderful shade and is in the midst of a fairly busy street that isn't packed with shoppers, but has the bustle and joy of the city.\\n\\nOverall: I enjoy Thierry a lot, it's probably my favourite place to go to for French pastries, although I can only afford it every once in a while.\\n\\nCheck out my website for more reviews: \\n\\nhttp://www.trulycindy.com/four-bellies/thierry-macarons"},{"name":"Buffalo Wild Wings","address":"5240 Bethel Center Mall","city":"Columbus","stars":"2.5","text":"Hot wings, trivia, and a decent beer selection.

Choose your poison.\\n\\nWhen Jeremy came back to take our order I decided to give the cucumber salad with beef a whirl and my buddy tried the chicken salad sandwich on a croissant.  The salad was impressively large - it came heaped in a bowl (I believe the cucumber was roughly the size of a baseball bat before it was chopped up) with tomatoes, onions, oregano and a dressing of red and white vinegar.  The beef actually resembled tuna due to the thin slices and choppiness of it, but it was beef (reminded me more of roast beef from the deli case than anything else).  It was fine, not spectacular, but fine and certainly filled me up for about 3 hours.  My friend like the chicken salad sandwich fine though he didn't care for the extra mayo on the croissant and wanted a pickle spear to complete the meal (which apparently wasn't chi chi enough for CafeNineteen's exacting standards, as they had none).  \\n\\nIt was all ok.

Sure, this place is tucked away and kind of private which is nice, but not worth much of anything. It's not exactly expensive either, but I definitely did not get what I paid for. WIll never return.

Which of course he loved also. \\nThe place was packed..only a few spots open at the bar..and 2 available spot at the Sushi bar. We chose to sit at the sushi bar than wait for a table.\\nThe Dj was spinning music but it wasn't as loud as I had expected.  You kinda had to listen hard over the chatter. Which is fine for most people who don't want blasting music while they're talking.

Fresh and crusty baguettes were served and refilled endlessly. This went well with some appies, their charcuterie picnic offering, and the escargot, which despite being a bit gritty, was still tasty and nevertheless a great starter. For mains, the staple duck confit was moist and tender on the inside and crisp on the outside, with the red wine reduction cutting through the oozing fatty juiciness, just sinful and delicious. The fillet of wild salmon with lemon tarragon sauce was seared to perfection, accompanied by some refreshing potato salad and zucchini coleslaw. This dish was the star of the show for me. Simply well done. \\n \\nAnother score - outstanding service. Bread basket and water refilled, cutlery replaced, I don't need eye contact or lift a finger, they know what we need.

Though this bistro seems lost in the myriad of Asian shops and restaurant in that area, I think the nondescript location lends to its charm, and I suspect this makes up for the reasonable price point too.

That's the norm generally. Leave the bills and give your table some time before coming back with the machine. Anyway, besides our waiter at the end of our meal, Chicha was okay!

I called on Friday evening to get reservations at my favorite restaurant, La Sambra, only to find out the owner, Cameron, closed it down to enter the highly competitive Italian restaurant genre.  But, we loved La Samra so much, we were willing to give it a try.  So, we took a few friends.  \\n\\nThey were running 45 minutes behind on getting us seated, so we headed next door to Apothecary to grab a meat & cheese plate and a glass of wine.  (I highly recommend checking out Apothecary btw.  Their food & wines are incredible!)  The interior of Gusto has changed considerably from La Samra.  I liked the design of La Sambra a lot more than the kitschy, fad-ish design of Gusto.  But, it was still a beautiful interior, and well laid out.  \\n\\nThe service was very good throughout, which is what we experienced w/ La Sambra.  I had a panini, and the rest of our group all had various pastas.  My Soprano Panini is very good, but not other worldly.  The rest of the group liked their pastas, but said they weren't memorable.  Essentially, it was what you'd expect from any one of the other 150 Italian restaurants in Austin.  The pricing was good.  Nothing was over the top.  \\n\\nAll in all, it was a good dining experience.  But, nothing was good enough to make you WANT to go back.  For the money, Andiamo, Vespaio, and Enoteca Vespaio absolutely destroy Gusto in the food department.  And, I'd put Reales and Maggioanos comfortably ahead as well.  \\n\\nI'm not sure what Cameron was thinking in closing down La Sambra to open a middle of the road Italian restaurant.  The issue with La Sambra wasn't the food, it was the management and marketing.  Cameron's an accountant by trade, not a restaurant manager.  And, he's only in his mid to late 20s, so he doesn't have many skins on the wall.  La Sambra could have been a star on the Austin restaurant scene, but he doesn't know how to promote his restaurants and entice customers to come in and keep coming.  His restaurants all have the same thing in common (he has many of them):  quality food, sometimes phenomenal food, a great environment, but never packed.  It's not the concept, it's not the food, it's the execution that's the problem.  And, thinking he's going to open an Italian restaurant in Austin, using the same management, marketing, and business principles, and it's going to just magically perform better than La Sambra, simply b/c of the food genre change, is foolhardy.  He essentially closed a 5-star restaurant and opened another 3-star Carino's."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place sometimes feels too pretty to eat in.

So the wait wasn't as bad as I expected,  usually we wait at least 30 minutes.  \\n\\nWe sat down to eat, well some of us did.  One of my friends was already drunk, it was 5 in the afternoon.  I'll leave the story alone but let's just say we got a few stares.\\n\\nI had been craving the Krispy Kreme milkshake, which is soooooo delicious.  It's a doughnut in your mouth....*drools*.  I have had the Nutella milkshake too which is so delicious I can't describe it in words.  Just try it....\\n\\nI ordered the turkey burger with fries.  Fries were on point and the turkey burger was so juicy.  I think I found my new favorite here!\\n\\nOne of my friends ordered the fauxlafel on a lettuce wrap.  She said it tasted good but the wrap kept falling apart in her hand, she ended up eating it as a salad.\\n\\nNow the burger that surprised me the most, the Butcher's Cut.  I hate bleu cheese, it smells and is just gross in general but this burger was AMAZING....and it had onions, and i hate those too.  This burger has made me question my entire life....it was that good.  The burger was cooked perfectly and the flavors with the bleu cheese, onions, jam, etc. worked magically together to create a flavor party in my mouth.  I will get this burger next time I am here!!\\n\\nOverall good experience and yummy food!"},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"It's kind of a hit or miss if there will be a line.

Conveniently located near Marine Drive residences, this place sells overpriced burgers and a few other entrees for students who are too busy to cook. \\n\\nUnfortunately I fall into that category as well, and thus I have tried many of their burgers. My personal favourite is the BBQ burger. Beef dip sandwich is the worst I've had (the dip they give you tastes really weird and bland at the same time). The salmon burger is surprisingly juicier than what I've had at the burger bar, but the sauce is sub-par. pulled pork sandwich is incomparable to other places outside of Ubc (the sauce again isn't very good). \\n\\nThe garlic fries are the best imo, but it really depends on who is making your order. Sometimes the fries are great, sometimes they're burnt and bad :/\\n\\nI haven't tried it myself but I heard the pastas - prawn+tomato linguine, mushroom penne, and Mac+cheese are quite good. \\n\\nDon't get the steak/fish and chips - overpriced and highly not worth your money. \\n\\nService depends on the server, don't expect anything great though.

Well, Blue Star Donuts bounced back and with full force! It was sooo fluffy, while having a great denseness to them. Overall, their donuts are good, but their flavors are a hit or miss!  \\n\\nButtermilk Old Fashioned Donut - Most popular one and my favorite! Great take on the classic  glaze donut with a nice richness from the buttermilk.\\n\\nBlueberry Bourbon Basil - Indifferent about this one.

We read so many good reviews and were excited to finally try this restaurant. We were greeted and seated quickly. We knew what we wanted and placed our order. Our amuse bouche and appetizer dishes arrived quickly. And then the wheels fell off the bus.\\n\\nFor the next 30 minutes, we were basically ignored. It was pretty surreal. Considering we were seated pretty much in the middle of the restaurant, it was hard to believe that our server, other servers, and the manager, were all busy buzzing around serving other tables without once stopping to check on us, or wonder, \\"Why aren't these people eating? How come they don't have their food yet even though they've been here longer than the other tables?\\" I thought about just leaving, but decided to flag someone down to find out what the deal was. Honestly, if I hadn't said anything I doubt anyone would have even noticed. The manager came by to explain that a computer glitch caused our dinner order to not go through, but she \\"put in a 911 to the kitchen and our food would be out shortly.\\" Not sure how something like this could have happened considering we did receive our starter. And seriously, did it not seem strange to anyone that we weren't getting served?\\n\\nI think our food arrived about 10 minutes later, but it felt like an eternity since it had been 40 minutes between the time our starter and mains were served. The thing that upset me the most was how poorly the staff handled the situation. Yes, both the server and manager apologized for the screw up. But no one tried to make things better. A simple, \\"I'm very sorry for the mix-up. Could I offer you a drink or something while we rush your order?\\", would have gone a long way to making things right. But, nope. Instead, things just got awkward. We felt awkward just sitting around some more waiting for our meal while others finished around us, the staff felt awkward as now they were just avoiding us, and the rest of the dinner experience was ruined.\\n\\nIt's too bad, because the food was pretty good. We enjoyed the pork belly salad, the roast chicken Penang curry, and the banana roti dessert.\\n\\nOur bill came and, of course, there wasn't a discount offered or anything. The server didn't even ask if we enjoyed our meal because she obviously still felt awkward about the whole thing.

The decor is eclectic, somewhat 50's diner-esque featuring various paintings I'm pretty sure I could buy at Bed, Bath and Beyond, but they mean well.  The staff is friendly, and the food quality is consistent.\\n\\nNow let's get to the goodies - when you get your menu, you might be taken aback by the 75 thousand ways a hamburger or chicken sandwich could be prepared, but you'll soon develop you favorites.  \\n\\nI'll spare describing the obvious points of what comes on a burger, and focus on some of the things that makes Red Robin unique:\\n\\n- Some of their burgers feature onion straws - which freakin RULE. Even if your particular choice doesn't come with them, you can have them added.\\n- They are alternate patty friendly - you can swap in a turkey burger or veggie (Boca) burger in.\\n- They feature the \\"Royal\\" Red Robin burger, crowned with a fried egg.\\n- And finally, my personal favorite, the Banzai Burger. The patty is marinated with teriyaki and topped with grilled pineapple slices. Mmm!\\n\\nNot in the mood for a samich? They also have a great prime-rib dip, top -notch french onion soup, wraps, and like 8 different salads.\\n\\nNow, for those of us who have gluttonous intent when it comes to certain foods, I've saved the last two items I wanted to mention: Their Fries, and their Freckled Lemonade.  I'll be sure to upload a picture of the lemonade; this is a drink that, like the burger price, you have to first get over the fact that it's like 5 bucks.  Then you have to get over the fact that it comes in a crazy glass (can request a regular one, but it's fun the first time)\\n\\n... but then that mixture of lemonade and fresh strawberries hits your lips... and it's on. You'll suck down like 3 refills before the waiter can come back with an appetizer. 6 more by the time your food is ready, and pretty soon you'll wonder just how many strawberries a human can consume before expiring?\\n\\nThen they bring you your burger and the basket of fries that comes with it. Nice, big, steak fries - and you add that Red Robin seasoning, which I'm pretty sure is 2 parts crack, and go to town on what initially seems like a small portion.  \\n\\nThen the waiter tells you that the fries are free refills, too.\\n\\nAnd there you are, with your endless basket of fries, your bottomless glass of freckled lemonade, and the person you came with staring at you in horror like there's a rubber hose tied around your bicep and you're about to check out.\\n\\nSo... yeah... Red Robin. Great place, great burgers - oh, and Atkins friendly. If you're following my AATX list, just stay clear of just about everything I described and go for the \\"bunless\\" feature on their menu- they'll bring your burger in a lettuce wrap instead of a bun!"},{"name":"360 Pizza","address":"6203 N Capital Of Texas Hwy, Ste A100","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I can tell this is a fresh made product, from the sauce to the dough.

My meal was the minced chicken lettuce wraps, which were..... good.  Not great, as it is very generic and full of sugar/salt. BUT I was desperate for some vegetables, and thus seemed like the best option.  My pal ordered the tofu chow mein, and that tasted even more generic.. ugh, I know I know- it is Disneyified.  I am glad for the experience as it was a cute little restaurant, and probably the best in the Animal Kingdom....

I walked in around 7pm on a Saturday and was able to get seated at the bar. As busy as the bartender was she immediately made me feel welcome. We discussed the menu and I started with the Turkish Lentil Soup. Seriously, it was out of this world. Creamy, fresh and flavorful with a warm spice fragrant unrecognizable. When I finished I wanted more. However, I saved room for my main entree. I didn't order a traditional popular Mediterranean menu option. I ordered the Salmon dish placed on a bed of potatoes and spinach perfectly drizzled with a light sauce and it was amazing. I am a true salmon snob. I order it everywhere I go, I've had it fresh off the boat and this was exceptionally prepared, tender in the middle and slightly crisp on the outside.

Burger bars went from no-man's lands to welcome reprieves of food glory. DMK in Chicago got me started: Their grass-fed burgers, specially made buns, and glorious toppings hooked me. Others would come and try to match that glory---Bailey's in St. Louis, Chicago Burger Bar---but none could compare.\\n\\nThen there was Hopdoddy's.\\n\\nThe elements all were in place: Grass-fed beef. Freshly made buns. Crisp toppings. Hip atmosphere. Thick shakes. Full bar. Good tunes. I went with the Buffalo Bill because I'm a much bigger bison fan than beef fan and because the first burger I had at DMK also was the bison option. The sandwich has good additions to the high-quality meat; you get blue cheese, hot sauce---and Frank's, to boot---bacon, and the house-specialty sauce called \\"Sassy Sauce,\\" which is like a much-needed upgrade to McDonald's unsettlingly named \\"special\\" sauce.\\n\\nTaste wise, the burger was great. The flavors blended together well---the spicy with the cool and tangy, the savory with the salty, and so on. Each component was great on its own, too. The problem I had, however, was with the execution. Each burger, in addition to its own special toppings, comes with a set of \\"underneathings\\": additional, common burger condiments settled underneath the patty but on top of whatever sauce is on the bottom bun. Because there is sauce on the bun underneath these additional condiments, and a patty with delicious fat atop them, and because the condiments are water-based (lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles), they slide around between the two layers and end up a wet mess on your hands or plate, everywhere but your mouth, when you try to take a bite. So the burger suffers from too many things happening at once plus an inability to take in all those flavors at the same time. \\n\\nI also tried the black bean burger. Again, the burger and toppings are great, but the set of additional condiments made for a very messy, fork-and-knife dining experience, the kind you don't expect or plan for at a burger bar. This patty in particular also crumbled with each bite. Delicious but poorly held together.\\n\\nThe fries are not bad, but they also do not stack up to some of the other options out there. And no sweet potato fries? Hmm. The shakes are solid, as is the bar, though the gigantic goblets in which they serve draft beers are quite heavy. That might pose a problem for anyone with weaker wrists (\\"Meris?\\"), and they're super cold. Again, that isn't all bad because no one in Austin wants warm or room temperature beer. But holding it in line for the food is a bit problematic.\\n\\nAt bottom, the food is good but the execution has a few flaws. Clearly, those flaws have not affected the popularity of this local favorite spot: I've always seen a line (though it moves pretty quickly) and with well over 2700 reviews, it isn't going anywhere."},{"name":"The Breakfast Club","address":"270 Western Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"The other day my friends and I went to The Breakfast Club for brunch.

Im guessing it was a herb flavor and nutritional yeast. My fingers were just sticky and covered with it! My food was ready in about 10mins. In and out. \\n The wrap was delicious as usual. I think the Morocan cousous is the secret ingredient... I wanted to try another wrap but I can't get enough of the Border wrap. The collard green salad was delicious. I think the dressing is an apple cider vingar base.. it had a good balance of tang and crunch!! The spicy kale salad.. whhoo spicy .. but great. The hummus was interesting. I keep trying to like hummus but I don't know if it is for me or not. But its good to try new things right! \\n  My only complaint is that they don't have labels for the popcorn.

Located near the intersection of Clairmont Rd. and N. Decatur Rd, the restaurant is frequented by young people and families alike.  The margaritas are popular here and the atmosphere can get loud and lively.\\n\\nNothing really sets Los Loros apart from other Mexican restaurants around town.  Everything on the menu feels standard and formulaic.  I visited for dinner where the entrees range in price from $8-13 each.  A la carte items include $2 tacos, $2.50 chile rellenos, and $4 burritos.  As is customary with Mexican food, the prices aren't bad.\\n\\nI had a plate of chicken and beef fajitas for about $12.  I thought it was nice they give you the option of having more than one type of meat with your fajitas.  You can order a version that includes shrimp too.  The fajitas weren't bad, certainly savory with all the fresh-sizzled onions and green bell peppers.  My only gripe was with the meat.  The cuts of skirt steak and the chunks of chicken didn't taste very fresh.  They were tough, rubbery, and had that \\"frozen\\" aftertaste.  The fajitas were served with flour tortillas along with shredded cheese, pico de gallo, and sour cream.  All in all, a very filling meal.\\n\\nMy tablemates' meals looked pretty generic.  Plates of Spanish rice and beans along with tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc.  The rice did appear to have some veggies in it and the beans were topped with melted cheese.\\n\\nThe chips and salsa, one of my favorite things about Mexican restaurants, were pretty good.  The chips were warm, thick, crunchy, and oily.  The salsa was runny, but  spicy and seasoned well.\\n\\nService was very good.  Our chips and salsa and drinks were replenished quickly and our plates came out fast.\\n\\nInterior is on par with other Mexican restaurants.  Outdoor patio seating with umbrella'd tables is available.\\n\\nOverall, Los Loros isn't bad for inexpensive Mexican if you're in the area.

After our visit last night, I don't think I'll be dining with her again.\\n\\nWe had called ahead to make sure that there would be music and belly dancing.  Check.   We made a reservation.  Check.    We arrived at 8ish and were taken to our table on the nice rear patio.   Check.   \\n\\nWe opened our bottle of wine (BYOB) and ordered the Shawarma Hummus plate as an appetizer.    It was at our table in a couple minutes and didn't look so hot.   The \\"lamb\\" was clearly from a freezer and was the ridiculous lamb loaf processed crap.   It was lukewarm and tasted something like cat foot.   The hummus portion was about a tablespoon in size, seriously.   The warm fresh pita bread was cold and stale, almost tasted moldy.   Absolutely terrible.   At this point, we should have cut and run, but we had a bottle of wine opened and decided to relax with the music and dancing.\\n\\nThirty minutes later, still no music, still no dancing.   Phara is walking around in her dancing outfit, but most of the staff is sitting down smoking.   Feral cats are fighting under the tables (maybe they want the cat food, err lamb).    We decide to split the Aegean salad and the Lamb Shank, but of course they are out of the Lamb Shank, despite about 9 other people in the restaurant, so we go for the Beef Tenderloin La Zeez.    \\n\\nThe salad comes out and looks fresh but doesn't seem to have much dressing on it.   Tomatoes are sad and pasty.   Not good.\\n\\nStill no music or dancing.   More smoking staff.   Cats chill out a bit.\\n\\nLa Zeez comes out.   The steak is cooked fine but doesn't really have any flavor, seems lukewarm again.

Having grown up in central Ohio and being a Cameron Mitchell fan by default, I want to love this location instinctively, but things usually go wrong here.  First, it's mustier and darker than other locations (possibly because it is older and the carpet is just gross?).  I prefer the New Albany and Lane Ave. locations.  Additionally, the servers always, always seem to be incompetent here (other than my friend, Dave, who no longer works in this location, sadly).  I'm definitely not coming here for M style service, but refills, courtesy, and timeliness should be part of this location's major overhaul.  For example, on a recent visit, the gentleman and I went and sat at the bar.  I went to visit the ladies' room and upon returning many minutes later (yes, I'm a gross bathroom texter), the bartender had still not  acknowledged our presence.  She appeared to be busy.  But a simple \\"Hi!  I'll be right with you\\" would've solved the problem.  Next, she finally sauntered up to us and asked \\"Are you all ready to order?\\".  Mind you, the prior guests' stacks of dishes and glasses were still piled up in front of us; no one had bussed the area or even provided us with menus.  When I asked for some menus, the bartender looked nonplussed.  Really?  We then ordered a turkey burger with fries to split (needed a snack before a grocery store run; hence the split entree) and it took at least 30 minutes, if not more, for the burger to arrive.  On a Sunday afternoon, when most of the restaurant (except the bar) was quite empty.

Don't get me wrong, my take-out food from last night was pretty good, but I have eaten take-out and dined at other Chinese restaurants in Atlanta whose food tasted just as good, if not far more delectable than the food at China Cook's.  Also, it should be made clear that when I rate a restaurant, there are other qualities that I incorporate into my rating besides the food. \\n\\nChina Cooks is located on Roswell Rd. in the Sandy Springs area.  I don't know what it is about this area, but every other road seems like a different part of town.  Driving down Roswell you will pass one street that is filled with upscale nice restaurants and places to shop, and then the next street down the road will make you feel as if you driving through a \\"gangsta's paradise.\\"  \\n\\nUnfortunately China Cooks is located on a street that could be considered one of the rougher part of town.  \\n\\nTo make a long story short, I parked in front of China Cooks front door so that I could keep an eye on my car while I went inside, and told my girlfriend to stay in the car that I kept running with the doors locked. I then strolled inside and picked up my order and paid for it quickly to ensure that I could promptly get the hell out of dodge.\\n\\nDespite the ghetto fabulous scene outside the restaurant, the interior  of China Cooks Chinese Restaurant was pretty nice.  The area was fairly small though, so I am sure that it could become easily cramped if the capacity inside exceeded more than 25 or 30 customers.  \\n\\nWe both ordered the dinner sized portion meals which were extremely large portions, but ended up only costing me around $20 for the two of us.  \\n\\nI had General Tso's chicken, which was decently delicious, except for those tiny Chinese reed peppers they sneak into the mix,  which if eaten will most likely lead to a string of vulgar language, chugging a gallon of water and running around fanning your mouth with your hands. \\n\\n My girlfriend had the Sesame Chicken, which she described as \\"tasting a little burnt on the outside and overcooked on the inside because the chicken tasted dry.\\"\\n\\nOverall, the place was decent, and I may give them another try in the future because of Stephanie and Micheal's 5 star reviews."},{"name":"The Cowfish - Atlanta","address":"4400 Ashford Dunwoody Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"A very unique restaurant on the Atlanta food scene. \\n\\nThe place is located in the Perimeter Mall shopping center, where Gold Fish used to be.

The name gives the impression of a burger joint or bar food, but  I would call this is a 'burger restaurant'. The ingredients used here are top notch and the buns, toppings and sides are varied and high quality. Meats available include angus, turkey, and bison. There is a bean burger for the veggies though sadly the Janis Joplin does not appear to be on the menu anymore (hemp burger). You can order your burger as a straight up bacon cheeseburger or get as eclectic as you want with toppings like goat cheese, avocado, pickled ginger, tzatziki sauce etc etc. The line can get long, especially during high traffic hours, but as others have said you can get drinks in the meantime as you pass the bar. The frosted goblets they serve beer in are fantastic on a summer day. The reason so many people wait in line? It's worth it.

I think it's safe to say we've been here at least around 50 times. \\n\\nI'm a picky eater, my parents are picky eaters. We're picky about service, quality, sanitation, atmosphere, presentation and all those other terms you can associate with evaluating a restaurant and its food. For maybe 3-4 times, we decided to try other Japanese restaurants around the area including \\"Crazy Sushi\\", which is, surprisingly, higher rated than this restaurant. In doing so, we just developed a much higher appreciation of this restaurant. My parents went to Japan a few months ago. They say this restaurant's quality of food is even more \\"authentic\\" and \\"satisfying\\" than the food in Japan. I don't know how the first part is possible, but okay.\\n\\nMy biggest complaint is that the service is slow, but it is always always worth it. As me and my parents like to say, they put a lot of \\"heart\\" into their dishes. We're fond of their bento's (which are pretty large proportions of sushi, tempera and your chosen entree dish). All the ladies working here are very polite, sweet and offer good service even if it's not fast. If you are in a rush, don't go here. \\n\\nMy favorite part about this place, aside from the food, is the atmosphere. It's generally quiet and chill. The soft incandescent lighting creates a very warm and relaxing environment; japanese music plays softly in the background. The tables are divided with dividers so it creates a nice illusion of privacy and even intimacy.

Of course, that's the only picture I saw, so imagine my surprise when I walked in and saw multicolored walls decorated in posters, flags, and other trinkets. I thought I was in the wrong place until the hostess/waitress invited us in. The seating was also different that what we expected. The tables look like goblet drums but instead of a flat surface, its surface was concave. \\n\\nI ordered the Vegan Drek Tibs ($13) and my non-vegan friend had a spicy Lamb dish ($13). When the waitress brought out our food, my order was laid out on one side of a large piece of injera and my friend's was in a separate bowl. Then, the waitress began ladling the lamb dish onto the same injera as my vegan dish! I politely stopped her and after clarifying that the lamb was in fact the lamb dish and not just another part of my vegan dish, I asked if she could please keep the food separate. She looked surprised but kindly obliged. So a note to all the vegans enjoying a meal with your non-vegan friends... ask to keep the dishes separate and explicitly mention that you don't eat ANY meat. \\n\\nThe Vegan Tibs were amazing! The taste was fabulous and the tibs had a nice crunch to them - even my non-veg friend said it was good, and she's not the type to lie to spare feelings. I was very surprised that I liked the dish as much as I did. It came with cooked onions, jalapeno, and tomato which added depth and more flavor to the tibs. I would definitely recommend this dish! \\n\\nThe waitress gave us plenty of injera to enjoy and was friendly throughout the meal. I would definitely come again for the tibs!\\n\\nCONS:\\n- The pricing was okay with the extra 20% off.\\n- I didn't like the tables, because I felt like I was sitting very far away from it and was nervous about making a mess!

Really?  Really?  Upper Crust sucks.  Yes, any pizza place can make a fantastic Goat Cheese/Prime Rib/Truffle Oil-whatever slice, but the real test is whether they can make a good plain slice.  Upper Crust cannot.  Pizza Regina cannot.  The only decent slices I've had in Boston are: Proper Slice (good slices, excellent specialty slices), Brickoven (it's decent, not great), and Pinos (surprisingly good).\\n\\nNow I don't know why Boston pizza sucks so much, but it really does.

Went nicely with my sandwich. I look forward to eating both again! \\nMy bf has the Classic Club and Redskin potato salad.

We love Southeast Asian food, but have grown weary of the selections and somewhat depressing atmosphere at Siam Cuisine.  A review of the menu  convinced my husband, son and me to try Wild Ginger for dinner this past Tuesday night (before the storm that never was) and we were delighted on all levels.  The menu is extensive but not overwhelming, with many unique dishes we hadn't  seen elsewhere, and our food was impeccably prepared and artfully plated.  While we usually dine family style in Asian restaurants, we did so this time only with the appetizers, as we each wanted our choice of entree all to ourselves.  Started out with light-as-air vegetable tempura and chicken satay - four skewers of moist chicken breast with peanut sauce.  Husband had the Spicy Crispy Chicken - topped with a perfectly cooked sunny-side egg; son had the Hot Classic Salmon garnished with crispy basil leaves, and I enjoyed the Hot Thai Spicy Chicken.  All three dishes were cooked to perfection, at \\"two chili\\" spice level, packing just the right amount of punch without numbing our tastebuds.  The vegetables in each dish were cut imaginatively and cooked just al dente.  Service was gracious and attentive, with obvious pride in the food; our tea and water glasses were replenished several times.  Another nice final touch - the big tray of wrapped hard candies rather than a tired little  bowl of after dinner mints.  A terrific find - we will return often.  The restaurant is small, so i expect there'd be a wait on weekend nights. but worth it!"},{"name":"Navarre","address":"10 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We moved from the area and still after ten years this place doesn't disappoint.

Then I watch her poor the hot drink in an iced cup and dump ice in it. Seriously, WHY. She asked me twice if it was hot and I said yes, and she came back with a half full luke warm drink that tasted like cinnamon water. It was atrocious. Then my partner received his drink and there was no vanilla in his coffee. To top it off, they forgot to charge us and we had to go to the counter and remind them and they didn't say a word.\\n\\nWe live in the neighborhood and come to this place often and it's usually pretty good.

My friend shared half of a spicy kale wrap with me, and I just had to get another one. \\n\\nI walked in today, around 2:15 PM, and the line was almost out the door. I accredited that to good food, so I didn't mind. I waited in line and observed my surroundings. There were a couple paintings of liberated Melanated women that I admired, but I did not see a menu. I didn't think it was an issue, because I knew exactly what I came in for. I also observed refrigerators of drinks and raw desserts, but no prices.15 minutes later, I had finally made it to the front of the line. \\n\\nThe order process was kind of like Subway. A man asked me what I wanted, and I ordered 2 spicy kale wraps, with extra spice. He then asked me \\"half or whole\\", I assumed he was asking if I wanted a half or whole wrap.I said whole. He stuffed 2 tortilla wraps with spicy kale salad, cayenne pepper, and soy mayo. The extra cayenne pepper was pulled from a rack, where I sighted a paper menu. A woman then topped the wraps with avocados and tomatoes, and wrapped them up. \\n\\nI had no idea how much they would cost, but I imagined that they would be reasonably priced. The Cashier told me the total, and I thought I heard her wrong. Two wraps came to $32. I couldn't believe it. I paid for them considering they had already been made, and left. \\n\\nMy wrap was huge and delicious. However, $16 for a kale wrap is extreme. Considering I witnessed my wrap being made, the ingredients that went into the wrap does not compensate for the price. Honestly, if I would've seen a menu, I would've considered purchasing a half. Back in 2015, I recall there being a menu present, but hey, I may be mistaken. Regardless, it seems that the prices are hidden until you have put your order in, or happen to ask for a menu. When I walk into a restaurant that I have to stand in line for, I would prefer to see an overhead menu, or at least laminated menus that are easily accessible.

After hearing about Flip Burger from a few different people a friend took me there to experience what all the hype was about.\\n\\nWith a name like \\"Flip Burger\\" one's pre-conceived perceptions of what the restaurant will look and feel like are not even close to what one actually gets when arriving inside the actual establishment.  Think classy, clubby, trendy, high-end gourmet restaurant...with a burger bent.  By clubby, I mean that the place has several flat screen TVs on the back wall, surrounded by large, antique-looking picture frames painted in high-gloss white.  Tables sit in rows that feel elevated so you can see (and be seen) by the whole restaurant and everyone in it.\\n\\nThe menu is very interesting, with several burger selections that are not your everyday, run-of-the-mill,m garden variety burger.  Several other reviewers have gone into great detail about what their favorites are and why, so I won't re-state the already reviewed, but I can tell you what I ordered and what my thoughts were.\\n\\nFor starters, I had the butternut squash soup.  If I go to any restaurant and they have this on the menu, I'm ordering it.  I love the stuff.  And I am just as astonished as you are to read this that Flip Burger had probably the very best bowl of butternut squash soup I've ever tasted...ever!  From there, I ordered the Korean BBQ burger, which was quite good, but sort of just tasted like a regular burger.  I didn't get much of a Korean BBQ flavor to it, other than noticing some other kind of pulled beef texture on top of the regular burger patty.  I was expecting it to have more of a Korean BBQ seasoning to it than it did, but oh well...not a deal breaker.  \\n\\nFor dessert, I saw they had a Nutella or Krispy Kreme shake and found myself in a serious dilemma about which one to order.  I opted for the KK shake and sure enough, it tasted like a Krispy Kreme donut had been converted into a milk shake.  Unfortunately, they did use actual KK donuts in the mix, as you can taste the soggy crumbs of a donut as they leave the straw and land on your tongue.  I didn't really like the crumbs in my shake experience so much, but it did taste delicious.  I could only drink about a third of the shake, since it was so rich and heavy, I just couldn't make room for the rest."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This is definitely a popular cafe with a queue at any given time.

Literally...like, this was the best Mofongo we've ever had.\\n\\nLet's go back to the beginning. I'm perusing a local JP facebook page, and I see a post about a new Dominican restaurant opening up on the main drag in JP. My fiance is in town, and aside from always getting sushi, we like to eat Mofongo. Good mofongo. I mean, we'll eat anything really...but we can't pass up a place that has BOTH mofongo AND oxtail.\\n\\nInitially we walk past it on our way to get breakfast at another spot, but we stop in first to get a menu, knowing that we'll be back for dinner. Welp, we had to try their empanadas natch. FANTASTIC, light, hot, crispy, and not too big. The spinach/cheese and beef empanadas were perfect little parcels on our way to breakfast. The people were super friendly, and albeit skeptical when we said that we would return for dinner.\\n\\n8.30pm on the nose we arrive at their door, eager to order our mofongo. They packaged up our oxtail, beans and rice and a little side salad ready to go and we chatted with Sarah (awesome, smart staff) about work, life, school while they make our mofongo FRESH. IDK, maybe 10 minutes later our steaming mofongo comes out, placed in a container and we go on our merry way.\\n\\nSmells GLORIOUS! With mouths watering we open up the container a few minutes later at home and HOLY AMAZING DELICIOUS JUICY MOFONGO. It was moist, not fatty, crispy pork crackling, fantastic flavour, not too salty. I can't stress enough how glorious this was. It came with a little container of golden deliciousness. Now, usually with Mofongo it's either drenched in garlic butter or you get a container of garlic butter on the side. You smell like you're trying to ward off vampires for weeks. But no, this was a glorious juicy parcel...resplendent with a soupcon of garlic, butter, and broth. A perfect accompaniment to literally anything on the planet, but a perfect marriage with the Mofongo. I must now capitalize Mofongo, because theirs is the Mofongo to rule them all. Just...DO IT.\\n\\nNot to be outdone, we also ordered their oxtail. I've had my fair share of oxtail stews from different regions of the world, but I have rarely had one with such complex flavour. IT was perhaps a tomatoey base full of spice and flavour. Juicy and tender meat and a generous helping of stew/sauce was accompanied by straight up mama's cooking rice and beans. Now, I'm always here for an honest review, and the oxtail/rice and beans were a bit cold. Did we notice? ABSOLUTELY NOT, because we gulped everything down so quickly. Only briefly breaking to exclaim how perfect the meal was. For less than $25 for 2 people, we were happy to leave a generous tip and will be BACK FOR ALL OF THE FOOD.\\n\\nLook, they sell stewed mushrooms and a dish of okra. I HATE both of those items, but if 100% Delicias makes them, I'd eat them.\\n\\nGO GO GO GO. Please don't wait. I want them to be around forever. My children need to have their Mofongo."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait for this place!

The food here is good, my favorite being the Tenzin's Bean something, I can never remember the full name of the entree for some reason. The atmosphere, in my experience, is the main reason why to come here. The waiters are fun to be around, the belly dancing is really freakin' cool, and the interesting music are some of the reasons why this place is great. It's a party place. If you don't enjoy loud music or belly dancing then just come here before 8pm and you'll be safe. There's also hookah here, and you can BYOB with a 3 dollar court fee per person. There are a few flaws that I observe from time to time here, especially during the busy hours, but overall Phara's is a great unique restaurant that I'd recommend, especially if you're in a group. If you're looking to save money the vegetable medley here comes in a huge serving that can be shared with multiple people unless you have a bottomless pit of a stomach. The most popular entree here is the lamb shank and it is also the priciest. I don't like the Shwarma here much, weird meat and fatty, but it is unique I will give it that.\\n\\nEdit: I came here a week ago and the food here has gotten much better here since I worked here (I moved on to a different job).

I also got the Ode to the Trailer (frito chili) as an appetizer for my group to share, which was absolutely delicious! Love fritos and it was perfectly covered in oozing cheese and chili. It was so good that I questioned if I wanted to actually share it with my friends or devour it all on my own. \\nThe entr√©e portion was very generous! The chicken fried steak was good - although a lot of the fried breading kind of just fell apart. A big gap between the breading and piece of steak, so there must've been something off in the binding.

It was a bit earlier in the morning so they had all the donuts we wanted! A friend and I decided to split 4 of their donuts: Cointreau Creme Br√ªl√©e, Valrhona Chocolate Crunch, Strawberry Pistachio, and Apple Brandy Crumble. All together, it cost about $15 for the 4 donuts. They put them in a cute box with their open wrapping, and we were on our way!\\nThe Strawberry Pistachio was phenomenal! It was cream-filled and tasted amazing. The mix of flavors went so well together! The Valrhona Chocolate Crunch was simile to a Bostom Creme but with chocolate crunch on top. I love cream-filled donuts so I was really digging it!\\nThe Creme Br√ªl√©e donut was really cool too! In the middle of the donut was a little syringe that you can inject more of the sweet syrup into (as if it wasn't sweet enough). The top was a little too burnt for my liking but the cream inside made it manageable for me to eat.\\nThe Apple Brandy Crumble is the lightest donut out of all of them, and that's your typical \\"drink with coffee/tea\\" type donut.

Despite the seats not being very comfortable and the space is a bit tight, I enjoyed my meal here. \\n\\nThere's a wide selection of pastries to choose from and it changes daily (?) perhaps not that often but check their instagram for updates. I noticed Saturday's and Sunday's lineups were the same. You typically order and grab your seat after. Your sandwiches are brought to you when they're done while pastries are given to you after you paid. \\n\\nI'm happy that they weren't as busy as it can be. I managed to find a seat and didn't have to fight or hover above anyone. \\n\\nThings I've tried:\\n\\n- Fried chicken sandwich (4.5/5): This chicken was crispy and not overly battered but more oily that the crispy chicken I had at Annalena. The description says it had jalapeno aioli, I didn't find it spicy or had any kick at all but that's fine 'cause the taste of the sandwich was good the way it is. \\n\\n- Pork Cubano (4/5): This was a very greasy, heavy sandwich. This is was what I expected so no surprise there. I wished there were some jalapeno's or spicy something to cut back the grease a little. They do have hot sauce and I found myself dipping my sandwich in it between bites. Love the cheese pull I get when eating this sando. \\n\\n- Latte (4/5): Coffee isn't my usual beverage of choice. I'd normally get something sweet but their drink menu is basically coffee or juice. But if you look at their menu (which is what I'm doing now), it seems like there's a wider variety of drink selection. So may be if you pull it up and ask for something like matcha latte or CREAM they'd be able to make it for you. Will try next time. The latte was good though. It was very smooth and enjoyable. \\n\\n- Matcha Tarte (2/5): The tarte shell was undercooked and wasn't very enjoyable. The dark green colour of the tart gave me the impression of a bold matcha flavour which didn't deliver as the matcha flavour was very little. I also wasn't too fond of the gelatinous texture.\\n\\n- Pumpkin cronut (3.5/5): I absolutely love cronuts and Their there did a good job in making it. I didn't think the pumpkin filling was necessary and could do without. \\n\\nI'll definitely return. Hope their apple caramel croissant sticks around till I come back.

Ordering\\nTrevor and I shared the El Camino ($11.75) - Angus beef, chipotle cheese blend, chipotle mayonnaise, pickled jalapenos, bacon, cilantro, sliced tomato and fried onions. \\n\\nWayne and Sumana each had the Ron Burgundy ($11.75) - Angus beef, bacon, fried egg, two slices of American cheese, cilantro, guacamole, sliced tomato & mayonnaise. \\n\\nBurgers come with fried Yukon chips, but Sumana upgraded hers to warm sweet cream corn instead (+$1.50).\\n\\nII. The burgers\\nThe patty was a good size and a nice sear. It was not super meaty, but at least was juicy. They could have used more seasoning. All the toppings were really good. The bacon was plentiful and crispy yet chewy. Everything else: the onion strings, chipotle mayo, cheese cilantro, everything was so flavorful! However, maybe it was just too much. I think maybe going with the Plain Jane would have been better to highlight and showcase the whole reason you go to Gourdough's - the doughnut! We all sort of expected the doughnut to be light, fluffy, and glazed. However, the doughnuts on the burger were not sweet and tasted more like a mix between a biscuit and a Chinese doughnut. The doughnut definitely felt greasy and I felt a little sick after eating it. This burger had a lot of potential. Perhaps I didn't know enough to order properly. If I were to go again, I would get the Plain Jane with cheese and see if I could get a glazed doughnut instead of the plain one they use for the sandwiches. That being said, I understand why they might be hesitant to use a glazed doughnut for the sandwiches. But the whole reason I wanted a doughnut burger was for the juxtaposition between sweet and savory.\\n\\nIII. The Fries/Sides\\nChips were good. They are kettle style chips. Nice and salty. The winner was Sumana's cream corn! It was SO good and gave me the sweetness I was searching for in my own meal. Thanks for sharing, Sumana!\\n\\nIV. Miscellaneous\\nThey have such a great space. It's large with all all wooden interior. They have a full bar and an outdoor biergarten in back. They also have Chameleon cold brew on nitro. I was excited to try it, but if you're familiar with Stumptown cold brew, Stumptown is way better. The Chameleon was a little bitter, which is surprising for a cold brew. They have a trailer out back as a nod to their humble beginnings. Service was great.\\n\\nV. Value\\nWe have a new way to measure value. I ask the members how much they would pay for the burger they ate. We would pay anywhere between $9.50 to $13 for these burgers. So this burger is right on target being priced at $11.75.\\n\\nVI. The verdict\\nLots of potential, but didn't quite deliver.

Both the hotel and the staff were an incredible part of our wedding weekend.  Shelly and her team were so accommodating, and really went above and beyond to make the weekend special. The hotel itself is also SO cool - the rooms are all nice and well-designed, there are gathering spaces on every floor, a lobby bar aaaand a rooftop patio, with views of downtown and a moontower! It's also very convenient to great food and drink options - walking distance from Nickel City, Hillside Farmacy, Quickie Pickie and a food truck court. Five stars and more!"},{"name":"Sokongdong Tofu & BBQ","address":"2850 SE 82nd Ave, Ste 11","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place is meh and way too overpriced. Their japchae is dry and devoid of the sweet/savory flavor.

The parking lot was pretty full when we visited so we had to go on a side street. \\n\\nThere's some seating and we didn't have too much of a problem finding a seat, although we did share a table with another party. \\n\\nThe aquas frescas was really refreshing! We had the migas too which were very good and the steak quesadilla was another great pick. \\n\\nVeracruz has a cozy, clean atmosphere and good food!"},{"name":"Thierry","address":"1059 Alberni Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"SOOOO happy that i found this place ! Thank you yelp for helping me find a dessert shop in the downtown area that's open til late. Up until now I used to go to True Confections for my after-dinner dessert cravings, and that's all the way in the west end and is at best a 7/10.\\n\\nThierry on the other hand definitely is a 9/10 ! Delicious range of pastries an desserts, and the macaroons - oh my ! All the other reviewers are right, these are the best macaroons in Vancouver ... I tried the chocolate caramel and chocolate coconut - absolutely heaven ! They were soft on the inside with just enough crunchiness. I also tried their chocolate torte which was absolutely delicious ... good quality chocolate and very decadent !\\n\\nThe prices for the pastries range from $6 - $8 and the macaroons are $2 each. The coffee and drinks are in the $4 - $6 range.\\n\\nI also really liked the friendly service. They were super crowded but even then the lady behind the counter took her time and made excellent suggestions based on what I liked. Definitely a plus ! \\n\\nCan't wait to go back and try the rest of the desserts ! They have indoor and outdoor seating and are located on the trendy Alberni street, so the atmosphere is great :)"},{"name":"Tope","address":"15 NW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"The bar is great inside with a hip vibe.
