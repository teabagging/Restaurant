What you see from the outside does not prepare you for what you see inside - you are literally transported to Morocco. The whole place is done up very traditionally - interiors,chandeliers, paintings and tapestries.Floor style seating of course but very comfy. They have belly dancers there every night and I went there mid-week to see the place pretty busy and at least a few birthday parties being celebrated, you know as they come out with a drum and sing in Arabic. Their 5 course dinner is priced at $45 and a very reasonable deal when you see the portions and taste the yummy food. Everything is fixed except for the main entree which you can order off their menu. It comes with a lentil soup, salad - a few different small preparations in one plate, both served with bread. Then they serve appetizer which is like a chicken pastry - very nicely done. Then the main course...I tasted both the rice with sweet lamb as well as the chicken with couscous and they were both cooked to perfection. Finally the dessert which was a fruit salad dipped in honey I think or maybe orange blossom water, and some really nice mint tea - hot and sweet. You also get a small piece of puff pastry - dry fruit and nuts wrapped in godiva chocolate in a filo dough , and its a good thing it is bite-sized, it is sweet but not baklava-sweet so it is just the right portion. Eating all that can take a while so be prepared for a long relaxed meal. They encourage eating with your hand as the food is typically eaten to indulge in the full experience. They do offer wine and other drinks but I could just about do to eat all that food for dinner! Their servers seemed pretty nice, they give you enough time to finish each of your courses and check in on you from time to time. They explain dishes clearly so thats nice.

Pricey? Yes it is. Worth it? Absolutely!\\n\\nSo I actually found out about this place through a recommendation of one of my boyfriend's friends. Seeing how this place has been recommended highly on Yelp and articles/blogs, I couldn't leave Boston without checking this place out. \\n\\nNow I was prepare for the wait. I've read everywhere that you should expect to wait a couple of hrs to be seated since the place isn't that big, and there's tons of people that line up to eat here. We came mid-December and I expected the weather to be much colder, so I actually brought some body heat packs with me to keep me warm while waiting out in the cold. My boyfriend and I arrived at Neptune Oyster around 6PM, to our surprise, there was no line! We got seated once we came in! Keep in mind that we got seated at the bar area (they told us if we wanted a table seat, we would have to wait approx. 10 minutes which is not bad, but we didn't mind the bar seating and took that option instead.) It was also pouring down rain that day so I'm assuming the weather played a role for why the place wasn't packed.\\n\\nOkay so onto the food, we ordered the Lobster Roll. Market price at the time was $31. Definitely the most I've ever paid for a lobster roll, but you're getting a good amount of fries with that as well (even though it doesn't seem like it in the photo, it's a lot!) Normally for that amount of fries in NYC, it would cost possibly $6-7 as a side add-on. So I'd like to think I paid $24-25 for the lobster roll, which I feel is pretty avg for lobster roll in Boston. Whatever excuse I can think of to justify spending $31 on a lobster roll LOL. This lobster roll was amazinggggggg. An overflowing amount of lobster meat on the hot roll, so juicy and delicious..\\n\\nWe also ordered oysters: Wellfleet, Island Creek, Mookie Blue & Kumamoto (2 of each). My boyfriend and I could definitely agree that we preferred the Wellfleet out of them all. Super plump and juicy (plus the biggest one out of the ones we ordered)! It was actually my first time having oysters, so I wasn't sure what to expect! But Neptune Oyster has definitely set the bar high for me. \\n\\nSince we were still somewhat full from lunch earlier, this was all we ordered.

I was very tired and while traveling southbound through TN, I stopped and made a reservation through Travelocity for this Hyatt. I made the reservation around 5 pm est and it showed that there were plenty of rooms available. I got to the hotel about 4 hours or so later and when I got to the \\"front desk\\", 2 employees were there. One was on the phone and the other told me he would be with me shortly. They both then tried to sort out whatever was happening on their phone call (I'm still not sure if this was a personal call or not). 15 minutes later, I was checked in. I didn't have my glasses on, he didn't tell me the room number, internet access info, what kind of amenities I could enjoy, nada. Only that the only room he still had available was a handicapped standard king. I asked him why this particular room was left for me when there were plenty available when I made the reservation. He said, that was all he had. I paid for a king executive room with a king tub. I got a very small shower/tub with handicapped rails, and a much smaller room than what appeared to be in the photo. I then proceeded to the elevator which wasn't far, but wasn't communicated to me where it was, how to get to my room, etc. There were 2 elevators, and only 1 was working. There were 3 large parties (2 weddings and a bar-mitsvah). I had to wait another 15 minutes just to get in the elevator, which by the way, was completely packed by people (especially in the parties) waiting to get on. I stepped off to let some people off the elevator and the guests shut it on me and I couldn't get back on. Instead of waiting ANOTHER 15 minutes to get back in the elevator, I had to drag a heavy suitcase and my computer bag up the flights of stairs. I finally got to my room and couldn't sleep all night as there were partiers going up and down the hallway throughout the night until well after 5 am. I have a difficult time understanding why a hotel can't put individuals not in a party on a different floor to prevent this from occurring as I had driven all night and wanted some peaceful sleep. It was very difficult for me to drive the next day without almost falling asleep and ended up having to stop at a rest area only 2 hours outside of Atlanta for a nap.\\nFinally, to top it off, when I arrived at the garage to park my car, there was NO parking and there was a sign stating to park in an outside lot across the street. This is also unacceptable as a guest should have precedence over people just there for a party and leaving the same night. Oh, and I also forgot that I had to put one of my pillows in the hall after coming to my room as there was blood or chocolate (something brown-looking) on one of them. I would have asked to move rooms, however, there were no other rooms."},{"name":"Mikasa Sushi and Ramen","address":"8777 N Lombard St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great ramen and even better service!

I had the Crab Corvina with asparagus and potatoes. The grouper was grilled to have a crusted well seasoned outer edge which sealed in the delicate white meat. The ouie gooey blueberry pudding/cake had a unique texture and I should have had coffee with it.

Italian Kitchen is a Glowbal Group restaurant in the hub of Vancouver near Robson & Burrard. Perfect for an intimate dinner for 2 or great for a holiday work party of 30! This award winning restaurant has amazing wait staff, talented chefs, beautiful decor and a mouthwatering menu. My most recent visit was this last week to try their new menu items and my first time at their new location that is gorgeous and elegant!\\n\\nWe started off with a refreshing beet salad made with roasted red & yellow beets, fennel, beet crema, preserved lemon, pistachio crumble, peppered greens, citrus vinaigrette. It was light and delicate and a great start to the evening. Next we tried some entrees, first off was the Parmesan crusted chicken, oh it was delicious. Licked my plate clean! It came with roasted brussels sprouts & cauliflower that was perfectly cooked, my fav kale gnocchi and mushroom m√©lange. I never used to like gnocchi but it's now one of my favourite items... I even had it twice! Next off we had the pan seared Pacific Salmon and smoked salmon cannelloni with caramelized fennel and citrus tarragon. Couldn't believe how tasty the cannelloni was, so flavourful and beautiful presentation! Lastly and the main even was the Sicilian duck for 2, the chef even came out to show us the duck before carving it up for us, served with pan fried gnocchi, seasonal vegetables, porcini & orange jus, once again the gnocchi was just to die for.\\n\\nI feel like a generally go towards the pasta platter which is mouth watering and delicious but was so happy to finally try some other items that might just be some new favourites! We also had a chance to try some amazing wine that was paired perfectly with each course, this is something I would suggest, is having them pair a glass with each course, plus a nice glass of bubbly to start the evening off. Although we were too stuffed for dessert, their Italian style donuts are an absolute must, they've been on the menu as long as I can remember and are so delicious served with a vanilla cr√®me anglaise. Also be sure to check out their happy hour, some great deals, can't go wrong with $5 sangria! Also check out their bar to see the bartender carve up some fresh prosciutto with pasta hanging in the background, yum!\\n\\nA special thank you to Jennalee the GM and Chef Kai Leitner as well as all the staff!"},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"AMAZING Lobster rolls and JOHNNYCAKE at a price that reflects the quality of ingredients (read: expensive). \\n\\nWe got here half an hour before they opened and waited in line to get a spot when they opened.

This place is nothing like what I experienced there.\\n\\nIt's more like a Moroccan themed strip club that serves expensive, mediocre food where the girls don't take their clothes off. It's what they have to do to sell Moroccan food in Atlanta because few people here are familiar with the culture.\\n\\nImperial Fez is something special and unique that caters to the Atlanta party / special occasion crowd.

The bread was hard and cold. More like a biscotti. Our waitress called it \\"Moroccan bread\\" and generally put the word Moroccan in front of a lot of the things were served. All the bread I was served in Morocco was soft, crusty and often warm.\\n\\nThe Bastilla was small but good, probably the best part of our meal. They served it as an appetizer and usually it's a main course and larger.\\n\\nThe Harissa was very bad. It tasted like tobasco sauce and the carrot salad was equally disappointing.\\n\\nThe Chicken tagine was not good. First of all, it didn't actually come out in a Tagine.

I thought it was pretty good, though admittedly I dont commonly order this dish so its hard to compare to other places we've had it.  My husband thought it tasted alot more fishier than normal, though according to the website the chef is from Busan, so that could explain it.  \\n\\nAlas, as for the kalbi tang, ordinarily one of my comfort foods, was quite disappointing.  The pieces of meat were large chunks, very chewy and not tender at all.  There were also a bunch of daikon radishes in the soup, which ordinarily is supposed to be extremely soft and almost melts in your mouth...however, these were barely cooked, and basically like eating an undercooked potato. \\n\\nWe were given about 7 or so panchan, my husband thought it was a good variety, though i found the kimchi well over its prime (i.e., tasted sour).  \\n\\nThe server did the bare minimum, even when we asked for water, she never came back after taking our orders, and we had to ask for the water after we were given our meals.

I wasn't sure if the roommate and I were going to make it to Pine State Biscuits since we had such a tight schedule and they don't take reservations. I had read about the long lines and wait times, but we decided to chance it. We stopped by this location on the way to the airport on Monday, October 10th at 11:35am. The wait wasn't too bad. Only 25 minutes. We were at the register at 12pm.\\n\\n*The Reggie Deluxe: fried chicken, bacon and cheese topped with sausage gravy, with an egg ($9)\\n*Hash Ups: golden hash browns topped with grilled onions, mushrooms, cheddar and steak ($7)\\n*Mimosa ($7)\\n\\nWe quickly ordered, were given a number, my mimosa, and found a table inside the restaurant. They also have a tented area with plenty of seating if you keep walking. I didn't check it out since we grabbed a table, but it looked like that area may have been communal seating with picnic tables? The food took a while, but I wasn't in a hurry, so I didn't care. The table next to us had been waiting a while, so they had to ask the server where their food was. It arrived shortly after.\\n\\nI love fried chicken sadwiches, so the breakfast sandwich was oh so comforting. The chicken was moist and tender. The bacon, cheese, egg, and gravy all melded into an ooey, gooey, melty bite. If you love biscuits, the ones here are huge. I took a couple bites with the gravy and it was on point. The hash was delicious as well. Crispy and satisfying. I did wish we had ordered a side of gravy for this as it would have made the dish that much better. Make sure to grab the hot sauces at the counter if you like your food with a little kick. I believe the ketchup was also there.\\n\\nBe ready to leave Pine State Biscuits in a food coma. The dishes here are heavy, but sooo comforting. I'm glad the wait wasn't too bad on a Monday morning, even though it was Columbus Day. Happy we were able to stop before we left.

The smoky one was very... well, smoky. Almost too much. I ended up not using that one again. The habanero one was much better, but not very spicy at all.

Incredibly bland. The chicken in it was very burnt and the outside was crunchy, surprising for being in a broth. I also almost chipped my tooth on a small chicken bone.

I have no complaints about our waitress.\\nThe issue was we were seated at about 9pm. I got my food at 9:50pm. My family got their food a solid 20-25 minutes before I did. They had finished their meals and still didn't have mine so we all waited \\nThe waitress was very apologetic and I recognize that this was not her fault at all. I asked to see a manager about the wait time. The manager came with my food. He was kind however only said sorry. I asked if he would please reduce the price of my meal considering the fact that my entire family had finished before I even got my food. He agreed. However when I got the bill he had only taken off a drink. I appreciate this however I didn't think it was a fair compensation. I spoke to him again and expressed this and he was very kind and took 50% off of my meal. I'm giving this review two stars for the waitress and for the fact that the manager eventually did compensate me although I had to work for it, otherwise this review would have one star. \\nWe also never got the waters we asked for and my family's food was served room temperature. These were  things we could have overlooked if my meal didn't take 50 mins to get to me. \\nI have a huge feeling this is a common occurrence.

Our waitress also told us that unfortunately this is how the restaurant is usually run.

There are two styles: Maine-style (hot lobster with butter) and Connecticut-style (cold lobster with mayo). Of course, I tried both.\\n\\nThe Maine-style lobster roll is my favourite because it's more savory, but if you want some more refreshing, go with the Connecticut version and squeeze some lime on it. The Connecticut one is probably more suited for lunch and the Maine one can be saved for a heavier dinner that will make you want to take a nap.\\n\\nNOTE: The lobster rolls are huge and the portion of fries can only be described as \\"American-sized\\".

Located in the England part of Epcot, Rose & Crown is actually part bar/part restaurant and quite a bit of fun.\\n\\nWe went inside the bar area first. Since it was rather packed, we went around to the side entrance to the restaurant and checked to see if we could grab a table. While the originally said no because we didn't have a reservation, the hostess used some Disney magic with her manager to get us on the list for a table. She handed us a buzzer and told us to make sure we stayed in the UK area, but it went off so fast after we went back outside that we hadn't even made it across the street! \\n\\nWe went inside, took our seats and were greeted by a lovely girl from the south coast of the UK. She was extremely polite and thoughtful throughout the entire meal. When we asked her about some of her recommendations for food and drink, she both gave us some good recommendations for drink (ended up ordering a fantastic beer flight with 4 types of beers, including a Boddingtons beer that I hadn't tried before) and confirming that the fish and chips was indeed an excellent dish to get. In fact, since the fish and chips was a good size (and we were already rather full from drinks and the Food & Wine festival), we saved most of it for the morning...and it actually tasted even better when re-heated. How does Disney do it?\\n\\nOverall, the Ross & Crown Dining Room at Epcot is a solid spot to grab some British food. While the prices were \\"Disney high,\\" the service was excellent and food tasty enough to make this a place worth checking out for dinner during one of your trips to Disney."},{"name":"Clyde's Prime Rib Restaurant & Bar","address":"5474 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Tried Clyde's because of Yelp.\\n\\nOne star for the friendliness of the Staff.

And since it wouldn't be Austin without queso, their spin on the cheesy dip called Mag Mad has black beans and avocado in it. \\n\\nMagnolia is the \\"other\\" main 24/7 diner in town, but in my opinion it is far superior to Kerbey Lane in terms of menu creativity and food quality. There is a long, sometimes insane, wait during late night or peak brunch hours, so come during off times if you can. Lot parking is available, but very limited.\\n\\nIf you find yourself with a bit of a wait, it's fun to browse Prima Dora next door to kill time. Table announcements for Magnolia are made over the PA system at the shop so you don't have to worry about missing your name being called.\\n\\nOne of my favorite things to order is the Flamingo Sandwich on rye, a vegetarian sandwich that I add bacon to  They also make a good Tuna Melt, and be on the lookout for anything cooked in Love butter (butter with garlic and serrano peppers--yum!). They used to offer cottage cheese as a side item (yes, I actually like it!), but it's sadly no longer available.

One employee managing the registers and four other employees making the pizzas. Within 10 minutes I had my pizza as my order number was called out.

Their prices and menu indicate they want to be a more than  a sports bar,  but the service and food is deplorable. The strip tenderloin came out cold resting on four soggy potatoes. It was tough, undercooked, and mostly fat, yuck. When I told the waitress I couldn't eat it,  she was apologetic,  but we instantly became invisible. To top it all off they had regular salt in a grinder,  and when you used it, the salt poured out ruining the meal,  really!

We heard them making excuses to other tables about how \\"the kitchen was backed up,\\" and \\"the bar was backed up.\\" Maybe because of the show at the Symphony which they could easily have looked up and checked the schedule. \\n--Our meals finally showed up at 6 pm, literally one hour after we got there and ordered. In the intervening time, no waitress or manager showed up with apologies about how long it was taking. Customer service? What's that?\\n-The food? I got a (very small, very flavorless) filet mignon with asparagus and potatoes. (Check out the pathetic joke of a dollar store \\"steak knife\\" they gave me. I have better ones at home.) It was lukewarm and slightly overcooked. If I hadn't already been waiting an hour I would have sent it back. \\n--My wife got the smoked BBQ pork shanks. We've both had that dish elsewhere several times. Boy was this a mistake. The \\"shank\\" seemed like some cheap cut of meat and it tasted like they poured supermarket BBQ sauce over it. Just terrible. My wife didn't finish it and said she'd never get it again. Plus it was clear it had been sitting under the heat lamp for a while. Both meals seemed like they came more from Applebee's than a restaurant in Boston. \\n-We didn't stick around for coffee and dessert as the show was at 7 that same night and we couldn't afford to wait for the servers who, as likely as not, were hiding in the kitchen so they wouldn't have to make excuses. \\n--Wow, what a big disappointment. I gave it three stars last time. This is a fairly new restaurant. I suggest getting that guy in from \\"Restaurant Impossible.\\" Start by firing the chef (I can cook better and that's sad) and training the otherwise pleasant staff. A complete and total waste of $117 and I tipped accordingly. \\n-The best part of the night was going across the street to Caffe Nero and having cappuccino and chocolate fudge cake there. \\n--So long, Westland, it was fun while it lasted. There are plenty of restaurants in this area who know how to do it right. You are not one of them and until and unless you get your sorry act together, we won't be back. Oh and if you read this and want to respond, don't insult our intelligence by reciting how short-staffed you were.

But now, a new champion has risen to the challenge- and that champ is in the form of skin tight shirts on 20 year old girls.  The wings truly live up to their reputation; they are wicked good.  It tasted different from the other wings that I usually eat, since Hooters' wings are more breaded and not spicy at all- almost like eating fried chicken.  Nevertheless, amazing.  \\n\\nUnlike the other Hooters locations that were open in the New England area (Boston, Nashua), this one actually has very attractive ladies!  Remind me to bring one of these church going girls home for mother, she'd certainly approve!   And the waitress \\"was really into me\\".  She kept on \\"coming over and talking to me\\".  I think \\"she wants me\\".  Yeah.  \\"She definitely wants me\\".  \\"She just gave me that I want you look\\".  Hooters girls know how to draw all your money from you (without contact), so just make sure you don't end up like Butters in South Park and think the girl digs you out of all the 300 customers she's served already.  \\n\\nOther than that, I dare say this might just be the best new lace to grab a frosty brew and catch a game.

My Steak tips sub was outstanding. Everything from the balsamic dressing to the veggies worked so well with the char of each steak cube.

I had no idea it made good business sense to convert an old Payless Shoe store into a modern, sleek New American eatery for Southie's jetset crowd. But an evening at the recently-ribbon cut dinner & drinks destination proved otherwise.\\n\\nWe knew what we were getting in to: Friday night, hyped opening, basically barren stretch of W Broadway. It'll be packed, chaotic and the staff will wear their frustrations on their sleeves. Couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised. From the time we stepped in to a moderate wait, there wasn't a team member that didn't pass by without offering to order a drink from the bar or ask if there was anything else they could do to make us more comfortable. The service didn't notch down a bit for the rest of the evening, and if management takes one nugget from this review, let it be this:\\n\\nYou hired the right folks.\\n\\nOn to the ingestibles! First, but not foremost, nothing on the menu will surprise you. It's simple, clean, American fare that's easy to create, marries rich flavors and is perfect for a upscale bar grub palette. Neither the food nor the drinks will snag blue ribbons in creativity, but this isn't a bad thing - Lincoln offers cocktails and dishes that, when executed properly, are sure-fire winners. See also: wings, 'wiches, fish tacos, wood-fired pizzas, fried chicken, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.\\n\\nThe polenta fries killed the starters. Huge planks, mistaken for French toast sticks, of well-fried cornmeal with pesto and a red pepper aioli received high marks around the table. The wings, while nicely crusted with a fire-charred, peppery dry rub, just weren't meaty enough. Great flavor, though.\\n\\nEntrees yielded heavy interest in the braised short rib, steak frites, a grilled cheese (next!) and my seared scallops. Bites were exchanged, plates were passed and in the end, a resounding huzzah goes to the skirt steak. Perfectly tender and right at temperature, the well-seasoned cut complimented its truffled fry mattress and melted under tooth. High hopes for the short rib dropped to moderate appreciation, as the truffling of the mac and cheese overpowered everything else on the plate. Standalone, the fried onions are terrific. My scallops had a great sear, but needed salt and not just from the crumbled bacon/creamed corn dressed over the five bivalves.\\n\\nMuch could be drawn from this first time, and on a slammed Friday night, I'm aware a new kitchen may not be on its A-game. Amazing service, decent food and the bar's Quiet Man (a seasonal spin on a Bulleit Manhattan) earn Lincoln Tavern a solid four stars."},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The lobster roll is sub-par.

I've made good choices today.\\n\\nThis place is a little off the beaten path, but that means there's plenty of parking and tables available. The cheese selection is really great; lots of domestic and international cheeses alike. The menu has salads, cheese boards (of course), sandwiches, soups and alcohol. It's all well done and a little elevated, and I do think you'd be able to find something for most palates. \\n\\nMy friend and I got two cheese boards, salads and wine. The rotating special cheeseboard was all European cheeses; there was a nice selection of three cheeses. One from Italy, one from Croatia, and one from France. They were all hard cheeses, but very different in taste. We also got the soft cheese board which had a Brie, a Camembert, and a semi aged goat cheese called boucheron. The boards came with a sweet chutney and little baguette crackers. The cheese was all a little cooler than room temp and it was all amazing. We also got some salads which were well done with thinly sliced veggies, light dressing, and solid portions. We didn't get sandwiches because our focus was on the cheese, but they sounded really good. Vegetarians could definitely eat here; I'm not sure about vegans or anyone who is gluten free.\\n\\nThe service was prompt but a little disjointed. We had two servers; the first was the one who was a little awkward. At one point he asked us if we wanted more wine but as we were discussing if we should have another he just walked away...so...anyhow after the shift change our second server was on top of it and very pleasant. \\n\\nThe space inside is moderate - not a ton of space but it wasn't claustrophobic feeling either. It's clean and bright, and honestly all I was looking at was the cheese anyway.\\n\\nThere's a glass case full of cheese, and this is really where it gets good. There are tons of cheeses reasonably priced from all over. My husband has been searching for an aged cheddar for a while, so when I saw the Novak 7 year cheddar from Wisconsin I immediately bought a quarter pound. It's everything a properly aged cheddar should be - a little crumbly with salt crystals and an intense flavor unlike any that you'll find at a grocery store. They also had Wabash cannonballs, which are ch√®vre rolled in vegetable ash and then aged. It's crazy good. I could have stayed there for days.\\n\\nIn all, if you like cheese you should check this place out.

We tried going as soon as we got into town, at around 1:00 on a Saturday afternoon. We couldn't even put our name down--the wait list was fully booked until the restaurant stopped seating for brunch at 2:00. We learned our lesson, and on the Monday, Mike K. and Gino G. put us down for a table before their morning coffee, which they got at the Heart across the street. Even then, it took about an hour for our table to be ready. We sat down at 10:45 in a packed house.\\n\\nThe restaurant was cheerful and attractive with a lively, bustling vibe. It was very busy, but the service was excellent--friendly, attentive, and prompt, without feeling at all rushed. Our server was great. She made some key recommendations and took care of all our needs.\\n\\nI had a Tasty Mary with my brunch, and this was nice: straightforward, spicy, and well balanced, with vodka, tomato, Worcestershire, horseradish, lemon, and sriracha, finished with a celery salt rim, a stalk of celery, and a skewer of house pickles--beet, cucumber, and carrot. My husband Matt B. had a Basque Martinez, a gently boozy cocktail made with Earl Grey, Hayman's Old Tom gin, Atxa white vermouth, Maraschino liqueur, and Basque bitters.\\n\\nThe food was fantastic. We ordered a lot, and several of the dishes were absolute knockouts. I loved all three of our small plates. We got half sizes of the radicchio and the potatoes bravas--both house signatures--and these were spectacular. I had no idea a radicchio salad could be so delicious. The radicchio was beautiful, tossed with bacon lardons, manchego, and six-minute egg. The potatoes were also wonderful, dense, creamy hunks fried in wagyu tallow, served in a hot skillet with over-easy eggs and aioli. We opted to add seared foie gras to the banana walnut bread with cajeta, and this was dreamy and decadent, a sweet, fatty union of spongey banana bread and melt-in-your-mouth foie.\\n\\nMy favorite of the larger plates was the Tasty steak and cheddar eggs, which we almost didn't get, tacking it on after deciding on the rest of our meal. Do not sleep on this dish. The steak was juicy and flavorful, the cheddar eggs fluffy and light. They came in a skillet with jalape√±o butter over a Cascade Natural cornmeal pancake. That pancake made the dish--it was moist and savory, finished with scallion and jalape√±o, just perfect with the steak and eggs. I was less sold on the biscuit sandwich, though I liked the biscuit. It came with fried egg, cheddar, and house cured bacon (you can also get it with fried chicken or sausage). Not bad or anything, but I didn't need more than a couple of bites. Likewise the Korean fried chicken, which seems to be one of the most popular dishes on the menu. Maybe it's because I'm used to good KFC being Korean and from L.A., but I wasn't especially impressed. The chicken was solid enough, with a mild gochujang glaze, and it came over a bowl of rice with house kimchi and egg and scallion. The rice seemed extraneous and the dish as a whole was just very forgettable. I guess you might want it if you've never had Korean fried chicken before. For dessert, I took some of Matt's french toast, and this was great, served with pear maple and whipped cream.\\n\\nI didn't love every single thing at Tasty n Alder, but most of what we ordered was not just good, but outstanding. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a special brunch in Portland. Just plan to wait, and make sure you order the radicchio, the potatoes, the banana bread with foie, and the steak and eggs.

And the bowl my waitress brought out was practically the size of my head!\\n\\nI watched what the other patrons were doing and, self consciously added my sprouts, tore the leaves in to the soup, swirled the peppers around, added a little of the brown (housin) and red (siracha) sauce and timidly began to eat.\\n\\nWhoa!  The texture of the rare beef as it cooked in the clear broth with the crunchy sprouts!  The texture and taste of the tripe!  The cooked beef was so flavorful and almost falling apart! That wonderful firm texture and lightly pungent note of the beef balls!  The tendon was so soft I could feel the gelatin melting in my mouth!  The aroma of the basil!  Those noodles!\\n\\nI was no longer a pho virgin.  I was in love!\\n\\nIt was so good I had to go back for a second bowl the same day!\\n\\nSince that day I have had many bowls of pho, and while I can't say this is the very best I've had it's pretty solid.  Next time I find myself in Boston and need my fix there is a good chance you'll find me here leaning over a steaming hot bowl almost bigger than my head."},{"name":"Tibby's New Orleans Kitchen","address":"2203 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"We this was our first time at Tibby's.

Coming from the middle of the prairies we aren't spoiled like this coastal city with an abundance of fresh seafood. So, one would assume you could get some pretty awesome sushi just about anywhere right? Wrong. Despite trying almost 75% of the menu items with the large (20 people) group we had, I just couldn't find one thing I enjoyed. First off, the oshi sushi looked good but crumbled upon picking up and it was just so greasy. There was very little fish and I can't remember which one but there was one which was extremely fishy. Next we had multiple rolls which weren't horrible but definitely nothing to write home about. Some of our party enjoyed the monk fish liver but it wasn't for me. I tried one piece of rather warm tuna sashimi and I just couldn't bring myself to try the rest. Since I was pretty hungry and none of the sashimi or rolls tasted very good, I decided to get a miso soup. It was probably the worst miso soup I have ever had. It smelled like dish soap/water and tasted not much better. Of the 4 miso soup we ordered, only 1 person finished even half of it before they couldn't stomach it anymore. \\n\\nOverall, I would say the quality of the food here is slightly subpar but it does have potential and the service was good. Since it was busy, it tells me there is a possibility that others who don't go in such a large group and order so many things may fare better but,  for me, I wouldn't come back based on the experience I had."},{"name":"Lincoln Tavern and Restaurant","address":"425 W Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I was really impressed with brunch this morning.

We mourned and gave them about a month to get up and running and sort out the kinks. Our neighborhood blog was a buzz about how incredible the food was at Rising Son that I figured this place had to be to die for and on par with Sun in My Belly...but better...walk-able. We would read about the intense crowds, shutting down early due to demand and supply and got excited...we timed it right, a Tuesday morning at 1100. We entered what was eerily familiar, it was the decor of the bishop with a more colorful name! No booze, at least at that time, I've heard they fixed that. The gf ordered the kickstart and I the hashed up plate. Hashed up was a bit pricey considering there were no eggs included. it was tasty but its cheese, hash browns and additional toppings - kind of hard to screw up. The gf had the same sentiments about the kickstart, basic breakfast fare. The coffee was decent, it was strong, delivered with hardly any cream and served in second hand store mugs (nice touch, felt like i was at home, except wearing pants). The only negative was the attention to keeping the cup full, there weren't many people in there and despite 4 employees walking around, shuffling things (Christ, sounds like my day) we never did get a refill till we were asking for the check. Good tunes on the PA, playing a lot of classic R&B. Got the sense that no one was in a rush but at the same time trying to figure out what to do, don't be shy, visit your tables.\\n\\nI haven't tried lunch, I don't quite understand the whole southern meat and three shtick. Due to no fault of rising son my past experiences with it have not been superb so I'm a bit gun shy on trying it. Will report back if I do. \\n\\nStill, while it was a solid experience and a place worth supporting I don't get the ranting and raving, we're hardly foodies, and certainly not food snobs. Perhaps its some form of survivors guilt from AE'ers realizing they let the Bishop down so they must champion rising son.

The line was around the building, but went by pretty quickly as it was a Thursday morning.

They also have an outdoor patio that you can sit at. \\n\\nAt the counter, we asked for recommendations and ended up ordering the Reggie deluxe, chatfield, hash with mushrooms, onions, and steak, and a few drinks. Waited around 15-20 minutes before getting our food as the hash takes longer.\\n\\nReggie deluxe (deluxe is an additional egg)- wow. The best of their menu. The sausage gravy was so thick and savory, and the cheese and bacon and fried chicken and everything went perfectly together. Ran out of the gravy before running out of the sandwich. The biscuit was good, but nothing special in my opinion. \\n\\nChat field- basically the same as Reggie but with homemade apple butter instead. There was not enough apple butter as the sandwich tasted really dry at times. The apple butter was delicious, but they definitely need to slather it on.\\n\\nHash with steak, onions, and mushrooms- the hash was cooked perfectly golden brown. Crunchy on the outside yet soft and steamy on the inside. This was by far the heaviest dish, but it was cooked to perfection. Could not get enough. \\n\\nLocal apple cider- very crisp and refreshing. They don't put ice because it's already cold, so more for me ;)\\n\\nOrange juice- can't go wrong here.\\n\\nThe price came out to around $26, which I think is really cheap for what you're getting.

A hidden gem you need to try.  \\n\\nAnybody on Yelp ever watch the show X-Files from way back when?  Because they need to do an episode investigating the mystery of how a place this good got attached to a bowling alley.  That's not a slam against bowling alleys, mind you.  It's just that after eating here, I would be in too much of a calorie coma to bowl!\\n\\nLike other Yelpers, I was drawn by the high ratings and number of reviews of this place.  I arrived and tried the Poblano, which is a one-third pound patty served with lettuce, tomato, onions, pepper jack cheese, grilled Poblano peppers, and a homemade chipotle mayo. \\n\\nWhoever dreamt up this combo knows their flavors.  Easily, this is one of the best 'balanced' burgers I've had, in that neither the smoky peppers, the zippy mayo, or the zippier cheese dominate and blot out the beef or the rest of the burger's ingredients.  \\n\\nExtra kudos for wherever they get their buns.  They're not sponge dough and not brioche, but something in between which has a nice feel, especially at this price point.  Extra Extra kudos for the perfectly done fries, served with (from what I can tell) large-grain sea salt, pepper, and spices that remind me of Old Bay seasoning.\\n\\nI'll definitely be back to try the rest of their menu, which seems to have a  surprisingly wide variety of delicious stick-to-your-arteries food. \\n\\nPro Tip: Lebowski's is located just inside the Highland Lanes bowling alley.  If you don't see the sign high up on the building, don't worry - just park, walk in, and look to your left.  \\n\\nThis place scores a 5 out of 5 on the 'CTJ Scale', as noted below.\\n\\n5 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Jesus good.

The decor on throughout is truly authentic and I could not stop smiling. \\n\\nWe ended up getting a booth and our waitress was Katie. She was very nice and suggested a few appetizers to us as there were so many to choose from. We went with the Shrimp and Alligator Cheesecake. Mind you, its not a cheesecake...its more like a pate and they give your crispy cheddar baguette crostinis to spread it on. It was truly fantastic! \\n\\nThey have a wide variety of entrees that can please even the fussiest palette (ME). So I went with the Blackened Chicken Pasta which was a linguine with a lemon butter sauce. It also had red bell peppers and artichoke hearts and was truly amazing. The portion size was huge! My boyfriend had the Catfish with fries and hush-puppies along with a side of cheese grits. When I tell you he wanted to wrap up the cheese grits and take them home in his pocket to save them for later....I mean it. If he could have had just a bowl of the cheese grits, I think he would.\\n\\nFor dessert, we opted for some fresh beignets topped with powdered sugar. Since my boyfriend had never had them before, I loved how our waitress described them to him...\\"It like a doughnut and a funnel cake had a baby.\\" I could not stop laughing.

A lot of fries still. \\n\\nDry aged ribeye $20 (+$1 horseradish) - ordered medium rare. Came w/ 3 slices that are pretty fatty though, just fyi.

Today I got some damp, limp, and cold fried food that was a bit of a disappointment. \\n\\nThe real thing that drove me to finally write a review after a few visits is the attitude in here.  The past few times I've gone I've gotten some pretty condescending attitude from one bartender.  What particularly annoyed me today was when she gave us a hard time for giving my 2 year old daughter milk and crackers that were in our stroller.  We came in with about 10 people in the mid-afternoon when the place was dead, dropped a couple hundred dollars on food and drinks, and had to hear a lecture about how \\"this is a restaurant\\" and we were being jerks for bringing in outside food.  My daughter is 2.  I gave her milk in a sippy cup.  I understand this isn't a kid-friendly place (no reason it shouldn't be with couches, a quiet ambiance, and food kids like, but the lack of anywhere to change a baby kind of sends that message as a starter before we start getting the attitude), but I take some serious issues with getting a lecture in these circumstances.

This week, after many suggestions to try this lobster roll we decided to make our way. We arrived right at 11:30 am when it opens and the line was already down the block. We just missed seats by one person so they took our number and said they'd give us a call when there was seats. The waiting process took about 45 min- which was perfect for a stroll in the North End. If it would have been a later arrival time, this would also be the perfect opp for a vino.\\n\\nFast forward to 12:15 pm where we are greeted by our server/ bartender Julie and the track list to lobster greatness began.\\n\\nOysters were the start of the show. They have a little cheat sheet with oyster tasting profiles that helps you pick your choices on the half shell. I immediately checked off two of each of the high salt, high brine oysters. The two that stole the show we're the Cotuits and the Mookie Blue.  Woah. Those Mookie Blue oysters were something else.  \\n\\nThen the booze: they've got lots of harpoon on tap but I went with a nice Muscadet. There's a pretty long list of wines by the glass, so your friendly bartender will help you find what pairs with your meal.\\n\\nWe started with the oyster piggybacks. Crispy fried oysters over tender Berkshire pork, with golden raisins and toast. This was so unique and flavorful. This made me decide that pork goes with everything, as it was such a juicy sidekick to those fried oysters.\\n\\nNow to the lobster roll. This thing is MASSIVE. You can choose to order hot and buttered or cold with mayo. In my mind, life is better with butter and hot lobster is heavenly so this is what we went with.\\n\\nThere is so so much lobster in this beautifully toasted brioche roll. I mean, as you chomp away butter drips down your hand in a totally NSFW way, it's impossible not to get hot buttered lobster with every bite. This happens until the last bite of bread, which doesn't happen with every lobster roll and I have had many.\\n\\nHands down, the most magnificent lobster roll experience I have had. Believe the hype and get this bad boy.\\n\\nAlso, because vacation diet calls for excess we also ordered the cioppino at the rec of Julie. WOAH. It may be hot AF outside but do yourself a favor and order this hot, spicy seafood stew. It is filled with fish, mussels, clams, and saffron rice. There's even a nice side of crusty bread to dip into the sauce. The folks at Neptune know what's up.\\n\\nNeptune Oyster is like Destiny's Child. It's chock-full of hits, and I'd find it hard to believe any item here is disappointing. The lobster roll is def their Beyonce- the show stopper everyone comes to see. It can definitely stand alone as the greatest of all time and keep people coming back time and time again. BUT Neptune's got more to offer than just that. The cioppino, other magnificent sides and raw bar are  the restaurants Michelle and Kelly. Harmonious editions that make this spot just a little sweeter."},{"name":"Athens Pizza","address":"1341 Clairmont Rd","city":"Decatur","stars":"3.5","text":"Great pizza place!

You know you have a problem when you crave oysters 24/7, you dismiss all health risks each time you slurp one, and you unfriend any oyster haters.\\n\\nThe bivalves here taste fresh, are always shucked clean, and each type has a nice finish to them. All my meals here (countless times) have been nothing short of amazing, and I've tried almost the entire menu (I'm fat, leave me alone).\\n\\nIf it's your very first visit, the obligatory order is raw oysters on the half shell (there's a dozen variety to choose from) and the hot butter Maine lobster roll, which has been featured in gourmet food magazines. I like to complete my meal with a refreshing blood orange bellini. My other fave items from the menu: blue crab cocktail, buttermilk johnnycake, yellowfin tuna, fish tacos (Sunday Special) and lobster spaghettini (Monday Special).\\n\\nDespite the long wait and no reservation policy, I always find myself returning to Neptune Oyster for every occasion and even when there's no occasion at all :)"},{"name":"Jake n JOES Sports Grille - Waltham","address":"70 Market Place Dr","city":"Waltham","stars":"3","text":"Food was just ok, it's the basic stuff you get at any Applebee's or TJI Fridays, but way over priced and small portions.

The Korean side of the fusion equation shapes the offerings - most dishes feature ingredients like shredded carrots, kimchi, noodles and rice. The American side features things like fries and wings. I've only been once and had the standard Koma box and was blown away. Served with beef and the aforementioned Korean ingredients and topped with a poached egg with special hot sauce, this was the perfect lunch on a cold Portland afternoon. It was so good, in fact, that I was, as promised, induced into a state of deep unconsciousness.\\n\\nI'm actually writing this review from the dreamworld - a world where I am gently cradled in the arms of a giant, cuddly hippo named Henry who feeds me from a never-ending Koma box.

Please note I was very patient and nice in all my interactions with the young woman. She played different roles: cashier & also taking orders/server to those eating in.\\n\\n1) When asking about the wait time she literally said I'll let you know when it's ready. When I asked but can we get an approximate time she said I'll let you know near the time it's ready which does not help especially when we had already been waiting for awhile (myself, my mom, and 2 other friends). Did I mention they were extremely hungry as they were helping with a move.\\n\\n2) Not sure if it's management or her but they are extremely cheap with the itty bitty cups of sauce served on the side for the cachapas & arepas. When the woman brought out the sauces she only brought 4 mind you we had ordered 2 cachapas and 6 arepas (with the small size of those cups you'd assume each arepa would get its own- I wish I took a pic to show you how small these cups are and you'd see why I am passionate). And when we asked if we can have more she had the nerve to say I already brought the sauces. And we just said yes but we would like more.\\n\\n3) On a separate order, I ordered natural juices for me and my mom which on the menu says $3 per juice. I wanted to pay after I did the order but the cashier said it's ok pay later. Why did I even listen? We were already fed up with waiting so long to eat & did I mention I had to wait even longer since an order with a guy I'm guessing who does GrubHub was being reviewed. So I went to pay I notice after my card is swiped I say how is this $8.5 and she simply says taxes and I'm like hm the math doesn't add up. So when I get the receipt it says 'pineapple w/ milk'. The cashier says don't worry it's the same charge when mind you no it's not. It added an extra $1. More than the $ it's the principle of being honest with your customer and saying I made a mistake even if it's 25 cents to $1 to $5. \\n\\nAnd did I add my little sisters friend was taking the arepa to go- and she had asked for a small sauce. The young woman had the nerve to say oh we don't have anymore and we can tell she was lying but let it go.\\n\\nI was not in the mood to go back and forth for a $1. I just left. It doesn't make it any better that my sister was pissed at the length of time we waited. \\n\\nI like the food from here but due to the extreme slowness, the lack of acknowledgement in a mistake by the cashier and the cheapness of this place with the sauces, this is the rating I will give. I had made the suggestion to come here but wish I hadn't. I guess I would only have this again under the condition that I call for the order 45 min before and make a clear runthrough of what I'm paying before I get charged because I will call this cashier out & put her on the spot next time. And in addition check the bag to ensure enough sauces are added."},{"name":"Jam On Hawthorne","address":"2239 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The food at Jam was definitely worth the hype that they receive.

Not your average lenguas. This is slow cooked and macerated to perfection, formed into a patty and deep fried.  \\n\\nFoie Gras - Excellent.  I basically ate this for my meal.  It came with a beautiful \\"apple sauce\\" replete with petite melon balled pieces of apple.  My 15 yo son ate up the sauce - and tried foie gras in the process - he said he could have eaten a bowl of the sauce.  Quite a review from him.\\n\\nSteak Tartare - Average.  It is not prepared table side, which - in my mind - is significant.  It was good, a very standard preparation, but lacked enough punch from capers or onions.  Skip it if you are hard core and/or on a budget.\\n\\nBeet Salad - Very Good.  The beets were cooked nicely, diced, and served with mache.  It was very rich.  On the downside, my waitress couldn't understand (or simply didn't like) that I wanted a salad after my main. Hm.\\n\\nEntrees\\nCoq Au Vin - Excellent.  If you are introducing someone to the joys of French Bistro, this is your home run.  No surprises - unless you've never had a well prepared version.\\n\\nShort Rib Pot au Feu - Excellent.  I tried to steal this from my daughter.  It was her birthday, but did she really NEED all that food and the whole marrow for herself??? heheh. The short ribs were fork tender, the vegetables integral to the dish as opposed to optional.  She walked away understanding what pot au feu is all about, the accompaniments, putting the marrow on the bread.\\n\\nSteak with Creamed Spinach and French Fried Onions - Excellent.  My son sat and composed his bites so he could enjoy a little steak with a bit of spinach and onion.  He loved the spinach!  He wouldn't share!

It didn't come with any protein but it was completely unnecessary because of the sausage gravy and egg. It was so rich and decadent.

There's typically a long wait but you can put your phone number down and they'll give you a ring when you're ready to be seated. This allows you to walk to nearby Quicy Market and do some sightseeing. The interior is extremely small and there's not much of a host counter. You are going to rub shoulders or elbows with someone when you're dining so you gotta get cozy with your neighbor. \\n\\nFor starters we got oysters and clam chowder. The oysters were fresh and properly shucked. The chowder was very delicate and very light on the cream side. I typically like my chowder a little more creamy so this was a light alternative. \\n\\nFor my main, I got the lobster roll with fries and I have to say... I was pretty disappointed with the lobster roll. It's definitely a no-frills lobster sandwich. You can ask for it hot or cold and I opted for it hot with butter poured over it. You're getting a lot of lobster and not much sauce. If you like freshly cracked seafood without any sauce, you'll like it here. I had a lobster roll from Atlantic Fish Co and I thought their lobster roll was amazing.

We aren't in Northern Thailand.   We are in Austin.  We aren't used to eating dishes that spicy for the majority of our lives, so perhaps they'd be better off meeting Texans in the middle and toning down the amount of chili and heat in the dish.

The decor is solid with great lighting throughout, and an interesting layout. Run your hand over the walls, they're actually textured and not just wallpaper. Very cool. The addition of standing tables means you have a place to put your drink and still be on the bar floor, handy if only because the martini glasses are a stained outfit waiting to happen. Awkward, awkward, awkward stems. The drinks err on the side of pretty and can be very saccharine, or just overly flavorful. I liked the kirtini but $10 for one of these is kind of a downer. And my dirty martini was fucking filthy. You couldn't see through the glass, it was so muddy with olive juice. The mini-burgers are delicious, probably because they're dipped in butter.

The employee was trying to explain that she has not been paid properly and the older lady tells her maybe it's because someone's stealing money from the back (staff room) and that's why she's short money. This conversation should've been dealt with confidentially, not where other employees and customers can openly hear.

The burger came out pretty quickly and was cooked perfectly (we asked for it medium). The flavor of the burger was decent and very juicy, but I felt like it was lacking some sort of complimentary ingredient. Maybe I have gotten used to all the glamorous burgers that restaurants serve with a ton of ingredients, but this just didn't hit all marks for me, especially since it came in at a high price of $19.\\n\\nIn addition, I think I could count the amount of fries I was given--maybe 10?

The chicken with saut√©ed vegetables was pretty similar in flavor to the chicken lo mein and also featured a large portion of chicken and vegetables. The young spare ribs were probably our least favorite dish of the night as they were a little fatty and hard to eat around the bone.\\n\\nOverall, the food here was decent, but nothing to write home about.

Maybe we should have just gone to Pauli's next door for our lobster rolls! The bf felt like the server was rushing us a bit including having us order when he said he wasn't ready yet although think she didn't hear him bc the restaurant was surprisingly loud but there was a constant long line so not surprised they would want to keep turning tables over quickly. \\n\\nMy friend and I both got the warm lobster roll with butter. I was actually expecting to get a little cup of butter to pour on top myself which is how I've been served at other restaurants but they dressed it themselves, not a big deal. Although I prolly would have wanted to drown it in butter even more haha but prolly healthier that I didn't. Lobster quantity was generous but overall tasted like a standard roll, didn't find anything remarkable about it. The bread actually broke apart super easily which I did not like; it became quite messy and hard to eat about halfway through. Fries were meh. \\n\\nI was also unimpressed by the bf's crostini.

The service here is awful.\\nThe food? Pretty damn good.\\nThe price? Woah, a surprise.\\n\\nWas here the other day before a concert at the HoB, noticed that if you eat at their restaurant, you get to 'skip the line', and wait in a separate line that gets admitted earlier then the others. Kinda nice. ($15 minimum required.)\\n\\nMy girlfriend got in there first, was seated almost immediately, but then didn't see a waiter for almost 20 minutes. Finally got a hold of someone, got her drink, and it wasn't until I arrived almost another 25-30 minutes later that someone came by to take the order. Food took about another 30-45 min to make before it came out to us. During this time, nobody came by the table to say it was going to take a bit, we never had anyone check on our drinks, and when we asked someone for help, it still took them a bit to get the food over. After everything was done, the waitress swooped over to snatch up the check and payment, only to drop the receipts off and run off, never to be seen of again.\\n\\nFood time: I got a cheeseburger, pretty simple, and my girlfriend got the chicken salad BLT sandwich. The burger was pretty run of the mill, I sprung for the 'cabot cheddar' upgrade, but it was all the same. The fries that both of our meals came with though were simply great. They had a good herb-ey taste, and it lingered when you had a couple. The BLT sandwich came with a couple sides of in-house made sauces, and everything was so fresh tasting.\\n\\nPrices: The price is honestly one of the most surprising parts. With a place like this being attached to such a landmark in Boston, you'd think that they'd be astronomical. The burger meal was $11, and the BLT sandwich was $12. They don't put prices on their menu online, so take this stuff with a grain of salt when you go in there in case something changes, but hey, I'd so go back if I'm gonna be paying under 30 for dinner and a couple drinks."},{"name":"Bondir Cambridge","address":"279A Broadway","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Bondir is fantastic!

Every once in a while, there is a dish that confuses me or makes me think, but that's also part of the fun of a tasting menu. Also, I've been with many friends who have dietary restrictions and they have always adjusted the menu seamlessly - not just removing things, but replacing them with other ingredients to make the dish work. \\n\\nThe service --\\nThe team at Bondir is amazing and in such a small space, it really matters. I've seen the same two people every time I've been at the restaurant and they've been lovely. They are thoughtful, knowledgable, and cheery.

I get it, I am a server.  I know how annoying customers can be when they are grumpy and hungry for breakfast.  They get pushy and impatient while waiting and they often lurk around in the way, then after their meal, when presented with their check, they linger at their table with total disregard for the other, annoying, impatient, hungry customers waiting.  So...I can sympathize with a smaller cafe's policy when it comes to posting a sign that asks when there is a wait that you finish, pay your bill and free up the table for the next guests.  I also get that large parties may have to be split up in order to accommodate around small tables and long wait times, another sign posted in the window.  \\n\\nHaving a short staff sucks.  Dealing with a busy Sunday brunch short staffed is hell on earth.  I get it.  \\n\\nOur party of 6 was ignored while we stood waiting in the beating sun for an hour and 5 minutes (to be exact) while we watched the parties before us, and well after us get sat at all of the open tables.  NEVER ONCE were we asked (or even acknowledged ) if we would like to split up.  The only communication that we received from either of the servers on staff was a grumble and a rude \\"excuse me\\" as they got annoyed at us when we were in their way.  I would like to also mention that we were only in their way trying to shade ourselves from the hot sun while waiting an hour and 5 minutes.\\n\\nOn a side note, the busser is cool.  Ever time I have been to this place he is always smiling, and I think for a moment he tried to help us.  By that point, when he had a 4-top in the sun for us to sit at, we were a bit beyond the point of no return, so sorry dude if I snapped at you...I know you did your best.   \\n\\nAnywhoo, sad news.  Even when we tried to be courteous and let them know that we were crossing our name off the list and leaving we were met with blame and snarky rudeness.  \\"You never told us you would split up\\" one of the servers said as she crassly smiled at us.  That is YOUR policy.  It is written plainly on your window.  WE should not have to bring up to YOU, the person who is employed there.

The mini lobster burger is decent, but not worth $8 for the amount that one gets. \\n\\nThe other major issue I had was the overall restaurant climate.  It's hot in there. I don't know if it was because of the mild weather that evening, or because of the aesthetic fire that emboldens the \\"Match\\" name, but it was way too hot.  Coupled with a lot of people in one place, it was kind of a mess.  I was ecstatic when I got outside into what felt like a nice cool breeze.\\n\\nOverall, it seems like a nice place, and the food is quite inviting.  While I'd be willing to try dinner, I think I would end up passing on the burgers in the future in favor of something a little bit larger and economical."},{"name":"La Posada","address":"505 Medford St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Undoubtedly one of the best restaurants in Boston!

Did we order the wrong sandwich? This isn't the flavor factory of yore. Surely, there must be some mistake. Something must be missing.\\n\\nAlas, no. The grilled roasted chicken ($8.50, like all their sandwiches), and not to be confused with their roasted chicken (horrible naming because it's a completely different sandwich and not merely grilled), had every listed ingredient. Yep, all there. Just supremely bland. I will never get it again, unless...might I suggest less brie, more seasoning, more red peppers?\\n\\nInstead, I will go back to the tried and true: the roasted lamb. Slightly dry but at least there's some flavor. Or I'll hit a new one I got a bite of: the roast beef, which is much better than the simple listing implies.\\n\\nWhat would one expect of the so-called best sticky bun around these parts? Well, if you eat it as is, then a simple sticky bun. No more, no less. It's good, but don't expect unicorns or anything. It's just a typical cinnamon bun with lots of thick caramel and pecans on top. Sorry if that ruined the magic. If you heat it up, say in a toaster oven, however, it is a very different experience. The copious amounts of butter start to melt, the caramel actually becomes enjoyable, and pecans are as good as warm pecan pie. Even the cinnamon tastes more cinnamony. So heat it up. Maybe they'll do that there for you if you ask nicely. Still, though, don't expect unicorns."},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I can never get enough of the view of this place - so different from day to night, and no matter which window you look out from, the view is absolutely dazzling and breathtaking!\\n\\nEvery single time I've been to Portland, I make sure to relax for a while at this easily accessible restaurant.

Most good reviews seems to be a long time ago when perhaps things were better. \\n\\nWe made reservations ahead of time and decided to arrive early. There were only 5 table dining in a really large restaurant. We had to sit on the floor which I was not expecting nor do I really mind but wasn't expecting that. When I sit, I have to cross my legs Indian style to be comfortable which means the high heels had to come off.

The starter course is huge with a variety of veg, hummus and other morish delights. \\n\\nWe both order different lamb dishes. My husband asked for the lamp cut into 5 pieces like one of the pictures to the server and he said yes that's available. When it came out it wasn't what he asked and he received mostly bone. Mine was large and plenty but I can tell it was not done fresh to order. It was decent tasting but not fine dining price as this place charges. \\n\\nThe dancing was actually really good, I just rather see someone from their culture do it but specializing in talent, the dancing was on point. When there wasn't dancing they played Arabic  music (my fav!) including my all time loved artist Cheb Mami so just the music alone would possibly keep me coming back. \\n\\nThere were fruit flies around our food ALL night and this was extremely annoying. \\n\\nOur server was wonderful and was excellent in service. He did apologize for the flies and said it's because of the front door opening back and forth.. Fruit flies don't come from opening doors, they come from poor sanitary conditions within a restaurant kitchen and rotten food...... \\n\\nI really had hoped for such a wonderful experience and hope this place can turn things around as I love the concept, the food if fresh, and even more so the music.."},{"name":"Pizza Mia","address":"915 N Anchor Way","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This place has to be a crime front or a hideout house for the FBI, because there's no way this place stays in business on the merit of its food or its service.

Upon arrival we were seated immediately, in the front room of the restaurant, which was quiet, low-ceilinged, and \\"adult-friendly\\".  \\n\\nHowever, due to some air-circulation pattern, strong fish smells lingered throughout that room, as well as some smoke.  Knowing that I would later write a review, I wanted to test how quick the staff would respond to a table change in crowded conditions.  The hostess indeed changed tables quickly, although there seemed to be a few frowns with the wait staff.\\n\\nOrders were: Grilled Mahi-Mahi (off the separate specials of the day printout), the 1.5 lb lobster, the lobster tail (7 oz), and the lobster pot pie, with starters: \\"Captain Crunch\\", and Crabmeat cocktail, by some freak of preference, we all got the same 2 sides with the main course, green beans and sticky rice, all accompanied with a mid-range Chardonnay.\\n\\nA few points dropped since the waitress struggled with the wine opening, and there were a few bits of cork in the taste she offered to me. I felt sorry for her so did not point it out at the time.\\n\\nResults: the starters were great; if that was how I would score the place it would receive 5 stars.  Main course: the Mahi-Mahi was slightly overdone, leading to a dry-ish slab of fish, with OK taste. Lobster pot-pie: 5/5, the two lobsters (7 oz. tail, and 1.5 lb whole) were both average - I mean can you really screw up lobsters?\\n\\nThe major downers were the sides. The sticky rice showed a lack of understanding of rice, probably boiled with too much water, and then overdone a bit, so that it resulted in a bland, clump of slightly dried out rice, with a hint of rice flavor you had to strain to taste.  I strongly suggest they remove sticky rice from the sides until they learn more about its properties, easy enough to do by going to a couple Chinese restaurants in the area that do dim-sum.  The green beans seem to have been slightly aged by the time they were removed from the vine, although they were indeed crunchy, but there seemed to be no point to actually eating them aside from the crunch.\\n\\nWe skipped dessert and went around the corner to some other place.\\n\\nOverall, the settings are nice for a group, especially if you can use the patio (if not for 100 degree heat).

Our waitress was from Glasgow and very pleasant and friendly, though she seemed to be a little overwhelmed.  It was a good thing that I told her that because of the heat of the day I'd probably need frequent drink refills.  She doubled up by bringing me two iced teas at a time, which was a good thing as she'd often disappear for extended periods.  Perhaps she had tables both inside and out, and aside from that our service was very good.\\n\\nWe started with the \\"Mixed Greens with warm Bread Croutons, crispy Bacon, Roasted Onions, Irish Cheddar, and warm Bacon Vinaigrette\\" which was awesome.  There was just the right amount of dressing; not drenched in it, just enough to get the smokey bacon taste.  It was also accompanied by hard boiled eggs and tomatoes, and the Irish cheddar was really good.\\n\\nI had the \\"surf and turf\\" which was a very genenous steak cooked exactly medium rare as I asked, a single piece of fried cod, more of that Irish cheddar in a potato gratin, vegetables and Yorkshire pudding.  I was stuffed by the time I finished it and it was the best steak I had all week at Walt Disney World.  We also had a chicken and vegetable pie which was good and flavorful, but perhaps not as much \\"bang for your buck\\" as my dish.  I took note of what other people were having and I do believe I got the best thing on the menu.  The bangers and mash didn't look all that impressive and I don't know why one would get the fish and chips at $16 at the Rose & Crown when they can get the same thing at the take-away stand next store a lot cheaper.  A table next to us had gotten the cheese and meat plate, and if I had more room I probably would have ordered it as it looked really good.\\n\\nFor dessert we had sticky toffee pudding and a lemon pie.  Stuffed from the surf and turf, I wasn't overly upset about the size of the pudding, but if I had a more meager meal, I don't know if it would have been worth the price.

The slaw that accompanied the fish is light, crispy and the perfect balance. On my second visit I ordered the rattlesnake pasta. Another wonderful choice. The noodles were tender the sauce is well seasoned. The only thing I wished I would have done different is choose the grilled chicken instead of the oven roasted chicken. There wasn't anything wrong with the chicken, beautiful flavor and tender but the grilled option would've allowed the chicken to shine more in my opinion. On my third visit I ordered the grilled pork loin with the Thai bang bang sauce. This dish is in my top 5 dishes I've ever eaten. Great grill flavor, fork tender and the bang bang sauce provides a nice sweetness and is also delicious for the mashed potatoes.

Like others have mentioned the service is incredibly slow, because it is criminally understaffed. I felt bad for the one employee who was basically holding down the bar and the restaurant all by herself on a busy Sunday afternoon. (There is another detached bar by the pool that also looked understaffed.) It took us a long time to get our food - we saw it sitting there for ten minutes. Within those ten minutes we had to ask again for water, and after we got our food we also had to ask for silverware. My gyro was forgettable, and my friend's chicken sandwich was so tough to the point of being inedible. When she told the waitress she took the whole meal away (so my friend lost her fries) and was told that, because my friend used a gift card for touring the place, there was nothing she could do. My friend did ask for more fries and she got that, but it was a very disappointing lunch.\\n\\nGOAT clearly doesn't feel the need to have great customer service at their restaurant because their residents are already paying them. However it feels like an insult to residents and clearly from the reviews it's building a reputation that might bleed into potential residents thinking twice about renting there - i.e., does your lack of caring about the restaurant also translate into housing matters? I know my friend was frustrated with our experience and we likely won't go back again."},{"name":"Revolution Doughnuts","address":"908 W College Ave","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"Found out about this donut shop from a Thrillist article and have had it bookmarked for awhile.

We were rushed because a large influx of people came in after us so we quickly ordered the true blueberry & the chocolate yeast. I wanted the orange pistachio, but wasn't sure if the husband would want that. The donuts are heavy, as in when you lift them up they are heavier than normal yeast donuts. There is a lot of dough and not a lot of icing. The icing is what makes a donut, so when you have a small amount on there, it's not enjoyable.

There are hooks for purses and jackets under the bar that are convenient for you. I ordered the Lobster Roll and some oysters. I had about five different oysters and they were all yummy. Can't quite remember them all, but I definitely had my favorite, the kumamoto. As for the Lobster Roll, it was quite delicious 4/5 stars. The lobster roll here is served warm with butter. The meat is tender and plentiful. The bread itself is nothing special. In fact, I only ate half of the bread since I was on a foodie adventure and needed space to eat more food. The dish also came with A LOT of fries. Again, I didn't finish this and couldn't even if I tried. Service itself was alright.

The addition of honey was a nice balance to the heat and saltiness from the cheese! The base pasta price starts around 11-12 dollars and you can add additional items such as meat, egg yolk, honey, etc. You can definitely customize your dish to your liking.

Served open-faced on thick challa-like toast, there was too much bread and salty meat without enough moisture from the bechamel to really balance the dish out.

I originally was going to order a Chili Breeze as a cocktail but she heard me mention that I couldn't take much spiciness and recommended another drink to me and my friend instead, which we were really grateful for\\n\\nCons:\\n- It was such a busy place with tons of people so it was already particularly hard to talk to my friend even though she was sitting right across from me. We had to yell at each other and knew right away we might have picked the wrong place to catch up with each other after not having seen each other in years. On top of that, they were blasting their music which I thought was really unnecessary since there was not awkward silences in such a busy restaurant\\n\\nSpecifics:\\n- Butternut Squash Pizza = very good! A pretty good size, plenty for one and I might even suggest sharing it with another person since I only managed to eat 2 slices (but I'm not a big eater). The butternut squash was very sweet and paired well with the fontina. I would say that the bacon might be just a bit too salty so whenever a bite included bacon I felt it was too much salt and needed water but then the next bite right after it would end up being super bland so I might suggest a better distribution of taste overall. \\n- Sippy Cup cocktail = This drink was one of the reasons why this is not a 5 star review. For a place that seems to be where everyone prefers to sit at the bar and talk to friends, I had expected their cocktails to be better. This tasted like just soda and fruit syrup. I would not order this again nor would I recommend it to anyone. However, the drink my friend got was really good.

It is small, quaint, curious, and intimate. All of those words I associate with a positive experience. The storefront can only carry the quality of food and service so far, though, and here is where this experience fell apart.\\n\\nWe made a reservation and arrived a bit earlier and were seated right away(gold star). We were greeted by our server, who initially seemed enthusiastic about us being there and got our wine order(gold star). We ordered our apps and main courses and waited while we sipped our wine and noshed on the bread(the bread was pretty good and the butter was fine, although not enough of it given. Maybe I want two pats instead of one. You don\`t know me!). \\nFor apps we had the kale salad(which I'll admit was pretty delicious and I would have been satisfied had that been what I ordered for the entire night) and frites(give me potatoes, please). The frites were fries if that makes sense. They were not what I would consider French frities(thin and crispy and amazing). They were the fries you get out of a bag and put in the oven. The aioli was OKAY. How did we miss the mark on the fries? I don\`t know, dude. I don\`t know.\\n\\nThen this happened...actually nothing happened. We waited and waited and waited. The waiter came by to refresh our water and wine, but we waited a loooooooooooonng time for the food. We were both starting to actually feel a bit impatient and I told my date that if the waiter came back one more time without our food, that I was going to ask what the deal was. Then we waited for some more because our waiter just disappeared for a while. My guess is that something happened with our food, because the wait seemed extraordinarily long and I\`m a VERY patient person. \\n\\nThe waiter finally appeared and came up with no food, but the waitress behind him had our stuff and so I slowed my roll and was just thankful we got our meal finally. I had the wild Alaskan Salmon with some greens under it and carrots that had been glazed. I actually quite enjoyed my salmon. It was flakey on the outside and almost sashimi on the inside(but warm) and I found that quite pleasing. My date ordered the chicken fried trout and she didn't really care for it. It was strange overall and it came with lettuce, so you could lettuce wrap it? It seemed out of place overall. Could have passed on that. So, between the weird lettuce wrap situation and the ridiculous food wait time with no check in about the status of our order, I don\`t know that I would come back here.

First, it's not ridiculously expensive.  Plates average around $12 and you really get the bang for your buck.  Splitting between one plate would still be totally satisfying.  Second, VEGAN AND VEGETARIAN OPTIONS.  You can substitute all cheese too for vegan cheddar and they only charge $1, not some ridiculous amount like other restaurants.  They also don't just have vegan/vegetarian substitutes, they have vegetarian meats!  The chorizo tasted just like the real deal.  Thirdly, HALF PORTIONS.  I try to avoid overeating, which is so difficult since restaurant portions are absolutely ridiculous.  Thank goodness they have options to order 1 pancake or 1 French toast because I barely finished 1.  This saved me money and guilt and I wish every restaurant had half portion options.  Fourth, great location!  The hour wait on Sunday afternoon didn't bother us at all because we spent it walking down Hawthorne and grabbed coffee.  Lastly, this place is insanely cute and just has insanely pleasant vibes.  Service was friendly too.  We stopped at HunnyMilk first and left when we realized it's $23 a person and you're required to order 3 items-and no splitting allowed.  There's no way I was going to spend $46 on food I knew I would waste.  Jam on Hawthorne is mine and my bf's new favorite brunch.  We were so full and didn't break the bank."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I really wanted to love Neptune Oyster but I was very slightly disappointed by the food. Don't get me wrong though, everything about this place is great from the atmosphere, service, and food. My only gripe is maybe that my expectations were not met, but maybe my expectations were wrong. See below:\\n\\n1) The half-dozen oysters we ordered were amazing. Be sure to grab a local beer with them.\\n2) The clam chowder had lots of chunks of clam like I've never experienced before. I expected the soup to be a little more thick, but it was more runny. Is real New England clam chowder supposed to be less thick though?\\n3) The lobster roll was pretty good, literally overflowing with plump lobster meat. This fact and the yummy lobster taste do make this menu item worth it but I thought it had some shortcomings. I expected a very buttery and toasty roll, but it wasn't. Maybe it's not supposed to be very buttery though? Also, the fries were too oily. Maybe the oily butter I expected on the bread ended up in the not-so-crunchy-or-tasty fries. Honestly, if I'm ever back here, I wouldn't get the lobster roll again and it wasn't the best I've ever had.\\n\\nPro-tip: If you want first seating, I would come at least 45 minutes before opening. You'd probably be fine 30 minutes before, but that line will start stacking up hard 15 minutes prior to opening. Since I was 2nd in line, they were able to accommodate my me, my wife, and our 7-month-old in a car seat.\\n\\nOverall, Neptune Oyster is worth a visit but I wouldn't wait more than 15-20 minutes for a seat.

Because what is rustic? Is it a slab of beef grilled to perfection with a hint of garnish and grill marks? Is it pan-fried chicken draped in a self-absorbed bliss of gravy? Is rustic rural? Is it country? Is it campfire fare? Or is it just a state of mind?\\n\\nAnd man I haven't even gotten to the beer part yet.\\n\\n101 Beer Kitchen to me is a type of restaurant that wants to challenge your assertions of comfort food with an approachability that both substantiates and defends its slightly elevated price tag.

In terms of the kitchen specifically, sometimes the latter is even more important than the former when it comes to food preparations and execution. \\n\\nNever in my life have I ever been so enthralled with what cast iron can conjure up beyond the breakfast table.

My wife and I couldn't decide between several different options, so we ordered three and decided to split them. The kitchen went out of their way to separate the dishes for two - all of them. And it wasn't a hatchet job. They were plated like they were meant to be presented that way at the table.\\n\\nThe pancakes were fluffy but not mushy, and the hearty bacon served with them provided a beautiful contrast to the whipped cream and fresh sliced strawberries. The burrito brought both heat and flavor. The star of the show was the fried chicken, which you absolutely have to try.\\n\\nOh yeah the beer. I keep forgetting.\\n\\nThey have a LOT of beer options.

We were then greeted by a very friendly waitress who took our drink order and asked if we would like bread, well the bread is where the experience started to go down hill. The bread comes out and to my surprise they are cold, out of the bag, dinner rolls that you can pick up at any super market or even your favorite Shoney's (Look it up if you don't know Shoney's). My opinion, if the bread isn't good, probably a good chance the food will be par to underwhelming.\\n\\nWhen looking over the menu I couldn't tell what they we're targeting, there was no theme, just a bunch of stuff on the menu. I've heard the steaks we're good but just two offerings and none of the other entrees really stood out so we ordered a few apps. We had ordered the Philly Cheese Steak Rolls, Buffalo Chicken Dip and Buffalo Potato Skins (On the specials).\\n\\nThe cheesesteak rolls we're just plopped on a plate so no true presentation as some places will at least cut them on a bias to aid when sharing. They were filled with tender steak and a good amount of creamy gooey cheese (that's a good thing) with a crispy won-ton shell. They were good but left little to desire.\\n\\nWith the Buffalo Chicken Potato Skins; meh. There was too much potato for it to be considered a skin and not enough or at least prevalent sized pieces of buffalo chicken to even know they were there. I've done buffalo chicken baked potatoes at home that would blow these away, plus they we're even serviced or complimented with blue cheese.\\n\\nAs for the Buffalo Chicken Dip, this was by far my favorite. It was well done, piping hot and accompanied by enough chips to accommodate the whole bowl of dip.\\n\\nThe major bright spot of the night was the service.

If you do not enjoy an absurd amount of attention from strangers, do not let them know it is your birthday, because literally every server who comes to your table (whether they take your order, bring you food, refill your drinks, etc.) will tell you happy birthday EVERY SINGLE TIME. I probably heard \\"Happy Birthday\\" about 20+ times that evening.\\n\\nLa Grotta is located on the ground floor of a condo building. There is a small sign at the entrance to the valet circle. The valet is complimentary, so you only have to worry about tip. The entire restaurant is beautiful and elegant.\\n\\n[DRINK]\\nI ordered a single cocktail - a Tuscan Apple (I think that was the name). It smells like an apple candle from Bath & Bodyworks, and it tastes wonderful. Sweet and fragrant. However, my first drink was served with a tiny bug in it, so I had to request a new one.\\n\\n[FOOD]\\nI could not pronounce anything on the menu, but everything was phenomenal! Our table shared the Calamari con Pesto appetizer and each ordered a different pasta entree.\\n- Calamari con Pesto: The calamari was tender and easy to chew, and the pesto sauce was delicious. An appetizer with great flavor!\\n- Pappardelle con Astice: Pappardelle pasta with lobster in a white wine cream sauce. The amount of lobster is generous, and the cream sauce is not too heavy. I finished my plate, but I felt like it was missing some flavor. Good, but I think it could be improved.\\n- Cappellini con Pancetta, Gamberetti, Olive Nere, Aglio, Pomodoro Fresco e Mascarpone: Wow, get a load of that name... It literally just lists every key ingredient in the dish... Pancetta, shrimp, olives, garlic, tomatoes, and mascarpone cheese. I tried a bite of my friend's order, and it was delicious! It had more flavor than the pappardelle, and I would highly recommend it if all the ingredients in it appeal to you.\\n- Penne con Verdure, Salsicce e Salsa al Gorgonzola: Penne pasta with sausage and veggies in a gorgonzola cream sauce. This dish was also delicious and flavorful - especially the sausage. If you like a creamier sauce, I would recommend ordering it.\\n- Tiramisu: Light, fluffy, and creamy. It is what you would expect from a good tiramisu. You can't go wrong with this dessert.\\n- Additional Notes: There was a couple seated next to us, and they were very vocal about their food selection. For one of their entrees, they ordered a dish with truffles. I could smell it, and it smelled delicious... And according to her comments, it sounded delicious as well. For dessert, they ordered the Panna Cotta for dessert, and she literally raved on and on about it, so I would recommend the Panna Cotta.\\n\\n[SERVICE]\\nThe service was good, but at times felt artificial? I was told \\"Happy Birthday\\" at least 20 times in a single night, but every time I replied to a comment our server made, he would completely ignore it and head off to another table. It just felt like the server had a set dialogue and didn't really care to listen to anything from the customer that didn't involve an order. Overall, it was still a pleasant experience. It would have been better if each person only told me \\"Happy Birthday\\" once instead of 5x and actually listened to my replies to their comments.\\n\\nOverall, a great dinner in a pleasant atmosphere with delicious food.

We loved the buttermilk blueberry waffles, Caesar salad, shrimp (not overcooked), crab (decent freshness), roast (their horseradish is pretty weak, get a lot), and creme de pot.

So the register kid turns around and asks one of the more experienced sandwich makers who sternly tells me - yeah 50 cents for the 7 grain ... no upcharge if you want the other breads - turns back around.

HOWEVER, When you eat in a place that hosts such fine amenities you expect to receive those fine qualities the restaurant is known, as well as not have your iPhone stolen from you by the waitress. I had a great dinner experience on sep. 6th I had the stake and lobster. Everything was cooked perfectly. When I left the restaurant and got to the street level I realized I left my phone on the Table. I rushed back upstairs in hopes that the waitress or some innocent bystanders grabbed it and turned it into the lost and found. Once I got there I looked around and saw no phone. I spoke with the waitress to see if she had picked it up and she replied stating she did not see it and someone must have walked by and stole it. I had plans to further spend my night downtown but now all those plans came to an end. I had to go home to Beaverton and log on to my PC to track my iPhone. However the iPhone tracker could not locate my iPhone because it was turned off. I sent a message to my phone asking whomever found it to call my work phone when ever it was found and then I proceeded to locking it out so know one could use it. I had to then buy a new iPhone to replace it which cost me an arm and a leg due to the contract not being over yet. It ended up being a very very Expensive Dinner Night. Almost 6 months later I receive a text message from a 360 phone number saying they have the phone and his girlfriend who worked at Portland City Grill took it Because she didn't know how to get it back to me when she found it. I then call the Restaurant and spoke with the General Manager about the issue at hand to let him know what had happened and his only response was \\"I am sorry to hear that, we can't be responsible for employees actions\\" Well in all actuality you are responsible for their actions if the have the restaurant logo on there shirt and are on the clock.I may be overly raged about this but I come from a different side of America where Customers are treated with respect and Fine Establishments will do anything to make situations like this right, good customer service is all I ask. I'm not looking for a freebie for a dinner but the offering of one would be expected in this matter which I would probably turn down but thank for the offer. I am meeting with the waitress tonight so she can return my phone. I would like to think that they are returning this phone out of good faith however it is unlikely. You see, they avoided turning the phone on for almost 6 months with the hopes that I would wipe all information from the phone which would then render it a lost phone and open for them to use or sell. Because I locked it out and did not wipe the phones memory it remained in tracking mode. the second they turned the phone it marked the phones location which i could only assume is there home address. If I was in there shoes I would now attempt to play it off as a good citizen who found a phone and would now like to return it. What other choice do you have once your address has been located? \\nSo, keep in mind that while the food and ambience at Portland City Grill is the best of the best you should not out your guard down and feel too comfortable there or you could have your personal FX stolen by the servers. And don't expect any help from the General Manager either. I will follow up after I have my phone back and let you know the outcome with my final conversation with the GM."},{"name":"Cultivate Food and Coffee","address":"1952 Howell Mill Rd NW, Ste 200","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"THEEEEEEE cutest quaint minimalist spot that your heart could desire.

The highlights were the charred, tender octopus, the zesty, succulent scallops and the oysters are always good. The Kumamoto was a safe choice and the Beausoleil was recommended by another customer. We would definitely get all of the listed again. The mussels were good and slightly spicy, but nothing extraordinary. The uni toasts didn't really have much of an uni taste as it was overwhelmed by the buttery taste. It tasted like a nice buttery, toasted bread which was yummy but not what we were expecting. \\n\\nOrdered the cioppino and lobster and sea greens salad. The cioppino is always good - it had was delicate but full of seafood flavors in the broth yet feeling so light. It wasn't heavy in tomatoes like other versions. The lobster salad was basically lobster with seaweed, micro greens, nuts and a citrusy dressing. Nice and light if you're looking for something light, but it is mainly lobster and seaweed. So, don't try if you don't like seaweed. Overall, we had a great meal and our friend had the lobster roll, which was nice and yum.

The food is good with some of it being exceptional especially the specials, the dumplings and the noodle dishes. The laphet thohk aka tea leaf salad was probably the weakest dish for me. The fermented tea leaf didn't have the delicious umani flavour and they seemed to dress the greens in vinegar at least that was the overwhelming taste instead of the funky tea leaf. Traditionally laphet doesn't have any greens but when it does it's cabbage and I would have preferred that over the coarse green served in the version here. But all the dishes were large and cooked fresh and were very filling. Many of the dishes have fake meats which are done really well and it's a place a carnivore would be happy to go to and not miss the animal proteins.\\n\\nThey also have very reasonably priced teas served both hot and chilled.

We're from Asbury Park, NJ, where there's tons and tons of vegan restaurants or restaurants with plentiful vegan options, so we were kind of surprised at how few places we had to choose from here. Luckily, our first stop was Flying Saucer, and it did not disappoint. The first meal we had here was a large 8 bit pie, made vegan! They were sold out of vegan meatballs so we substituted vegan chicken. It was so good! Huge, too, though we did manage to finish it. The second day of our trip, we came back, and got a vegan Silurian pie with vegan Mac and cheese and it was even better than the 8 bit. We also had the little cauliflower bites, the fire flower things?? Pretty good! I saved the sauces we got on the side of the cauliflower and dipped my pizza crusts in the sweet habanero sauce, while my bf utilized the bbq sauce as an additional topping on his pizza. We waited about 20 min the first night, and about an hour the second night, but it was Halloween.. duh. Even as busy as it was, we had great service each night and everyone we spoke to was genuine and warm.

PONKO chicken is a new, small restaurant located at the corner of Chamblee Tucker Road and Presidential Parkway.  In other words, it's an ideal stop for dinner for rock climbers after a few hours of bouldering at Stone Summit.  The inside of the restaurant isn't huge, so I wouldn't recommend bringing a huge group here.  But there's a little bit of bar seating on the inside and more patio seating right outside the restaurant.   Food is ordered at the counter and your name will be called when the food is ready.  Service speed isn't super fast, but also not extremely slow in the later evening hours.  The cashier was very knowledgable about the menu - after asking if it was my first visit to PONKO, she immediately gave a good rundown of what's good on the menu - which I'll attempt to replicate now.\\n\\nOn the Menu: For individuals, you have a choice between ordering a plate, a salad, or a sandwich.  Proteins are included for plates and sandwiches and cost a little extra for the salads. The choices of proteins are ponko chicken tenders, ponko vegetable patty, ponko tofu squares, or grilled chicken).  You can then choose a sauce (original, spicy or BBQ).  Plates come with 2 sides (white rice, brown rice, fries, cole slaw, potato salad, or garden salad).  Salads do not come with sides, so if you order a salad you will have to purchase sides separately.  In addition there are options for a ponko chicken rice box or salad box.  Groups or families can order chicken by itself in bulk (up to 20 tenders) and kids' meals.  \\n\\nWhat I Tried:\\nSalad with Spicy Ponko Chicken ($10) - I ordered my salad for takeout and appreciated how they gave me my hot chicken tenders in a separate container from the salad.  The salad itself, while fresh, is pretty basic - lettuce, carrots, and red cabbage.  There are wonton crisps added to give the salad more crunch.  To be honest, though, I don't think I would order the $7 salad without protein.  I chose the sweet sesame dressing, which was very good.  You get a more than adequate portion of the dressing, which is good on both the vegetables in the salad and the chicken.  That being said, the chicken doesn't need any dressing.  It was definitely the standout of the entree.  The chicken tenders were cut prior to serving.  I really liked the breading, which was seasoned with a sweet spicy sauce that had a very slight amount of heat to it.  The chicken itself was hot and moist and I got quite a few pieces.  Thoughts on the price point - this salad does cost quite a bit more than a fast food chain fried chicken salad.  Chicken is an upgrade from most fast food restaurants, but at the same time there's less variety in the salad in terms of other ingredients (vegetables, fruit, nuts).\\n\\nVerdict: The ponko chicken is extremely well done and the restaurant has a pleasant atmosphere.  At the same time, I'd probably opt for a plate next time or just a bucket of the chicken by itself.  It's more pricey than fast food, but if you're mainly interested in the ponko chicken this restaurant is worth a visit."},{"name":"The Westland","address":"10 Westland Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I really wanted to like this place.

The bootleg sauce is amazing, and the \\"optional extra kick\\" really made it special.it also comes with potatoes and two pieces of corn- I do wish we had more corn, because that was amazing and delicious.we finished off with chocolate hazelnut beignets, which were warm and fluffy and HUGE.

The lobster roll, I remember coming with fries and being really good, but I didn't order it the second time around, because I already had one from another establishment earlier in the day. \\n\\nThe interior of Neptune is SMALL, and they are always packed. There's a few booths and maybe around 12 bar seats. Think: wait time of 2.5 hours for seating for two. I learned this the first time around. It's best to come here solo and snag a seat at the bar to get your grub on, which is what I actually did. I waited 10-15 minutes for a seat, while there were groups of 1+ waiting up to 3-4 hours behind me. That's the nature of this place, honestly. This is a place where you get to know your neighbors, because space is tight, and folks typically eating at the bar are lonewolfers, haha. \\n\\nAnyway, I quickly placed my order using a form and received my platter just as fast. It's nice that their form describes the flavor profile of each variety, so you can really sit and taste instead of slurping down a bunch of oysters without really experiencing each. The oysters all tasted incredibly fresh, and I ended up ordering some more of a few of my favorites. They were out of the oyster I specifically came here for (kusshi), so I was a bit disappointed about that. All in all, I still plan to make this place a regular stop whenever I'm in Boston again. Staff was engaging, and there's just a really nice, neighborly ambiance to Neptune I don't really get from other oyster bars I've been to. This is probably due to it's size."},{"name":"Com Vietnamese Grill Restaurant","address":"4005 Buford Hwy NE, Ste E","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"From the outside, this place looks like a dive.

There is so much to criticize here.  For some perspective I just wrote a 5 star review for Mythos (Universal location) and I am a former server and prep cook myself.  Service was extremely (did I say extremely) slow.  It was around 530 pm and it was not at all crowded, yet after 15 minutes of no drink delivery our server explained that their bartender had not yet arrived.  What restaurant that is properly managed places their ability to operate a bar on the chance that their ONLY bartender shows up to work?? We rarely drink and these were really basic drinks that anyone could prepare.  Everything moved slow... I returned my steak because the first one was about 1/4 inch thick and way overcooked--I can't believe they even tried to pass this off as steak.  BTW I am not a picky eater at all and rarely if ever return anything.  My wife ordered a loaded baked potato and steamed broccoli.  The broccoli was OK but the \\"loaded\\" baked potato had a tiny portion of bacon and melted cheese but nothing else (no butter or sour cream).  By the time she was able to ask for it and receive it the potato was stone cold.  Our salads were the only thing that was not completely subpar but not prize winners either.  We had no utensils or napkins at our table until we were able to get the attention our server.  it seems that we had to ask for everything!  What I found to be most astounding is that with such slack service, employees were standing around, dancing and socializing with each other as though they had nothing better to do.  I went into a foul smelling bathroom (the kind of accumulated smell over time) that appeared as though it needed a good cleaning.  There were no paper towels in the dispenser and the bottom 2 inch edge of the dispenser where one would retrieve a paper towel was absolutely filthy; as though it had never been cleaned.  Our server was not horrible and seemingly new to serving (I asked him is he was new and he was--former banquet server) so I did tip him reasonably well as most of the deficits in the location were not his direct responsibility.  This place needs a manager that 1. Cares about the success of the restaurant. 2. Knows the basics of how to run a business.  Awful, awful and awful... I recall telling my wife that this place had the presentation of a restaurants first night in operation in combination with little to no preparation.  I can see why Chili's and other competing restaurants are doing much better.  I would not eat here at half the price.  Actually we had a $15.00 gift card but still felt like we got ripped off.  Hate it but this experience was so awful that I am done with Applebee's (all locations)--just not worth the risk.  I would have given zero stars if that were an option."},{"name":"Cork & Fork","address":"5180 S Conway Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"The reason for 4 stars and not 3 is because the staff and their service was superior.

Kudos!\\n\\nWe loved the selection of dishes (food choices) and the taste of each was tantalizing.  The reason for not giving this place 5 stars because (in my opinion) the food was over-priced. The 10% discount (currently anyway) via Yelp (for checking in) helped - but, even with the discount, the food and liquor is still over priced. The bartender had an computer issue with the 10% discount but the manager was there to the rescue. he could not figure it out either so he offered me a 20% discount. YAY!? no!!! he used a different computer and reduced the discount back to 10% (promises-promises. broken = lost a star).\\n\\nAnother compliant I'll add here is that the prices at this restaurant is higher than their on-line (menu) prices. Could be a bait-n-switch but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt (let this be their advance notice that others will check).\\n\\nMy choice for dinner was the scallops. but $24! ugh.

There was one motorcycle video arcade game, but it didn't look like it was working. The play area is smaller than John's Incredible Pizza Co., but this place is better suited for younger kids.  The merry-go-round looks like it's supposed to run by coin, but it's actually run by a light switch on the wall. So you can get a really long ride if you want.

I can easily say there was no Magic in this experience.\\n\\nWe came on a Monday night and when we arrived it was a torrential Florida rain. In fear of being charged for being late, I decided to Valet our car. That turned out to be a $32 mistake as they charge you the full daily rate whether you are there for an hour for a meal or a 24 hour stay.\\n\\nWe were dry as we went through the lobby only to find that the restaurant is not connected to anything. You can't even hop through the different hotel buildings. So, we got absolutely drenched anyway while trying to make it across the few hundred yards to the restaurant. And we had umbrellas. It only went downhill from there.\\n\\nWe arrived for a 5:20pm dinner and after drying off they sat us on a cute table for two well away from the windows. Looking around, we were the only couple NOT at a window but I wasn't going to make a big deal because maybe a larger party was coming. Not. In the entire hour and a half there was one table of four that got a six-top and all the couples were set at the window. Was I not wearing any Disney attire?

They should have said Corn & shrimp cakes to be closer to any Fair Disclosure. They tasted good, but that was a marketing misdirection. \\n\\nThe misdirection continued with our soup & salad. I tried the lobster bisque. It really had no flavor. I was starting to decide that no one in the kitchen was actually sampling the food that went out. They had prepared it so long that they trusted that it was correct. Not. It was like they either forgot the seasoning or ran out of salt. No problem, the lobster pile in the middle was rubbery enough to give a physical therapy session for dental work.\\n\\nMy date never has a bad word to say about anything (except me of course), but she had me try her Pear & Gorgonzola salad because something was off. Yeah, the quality/freshness of the walnuts were off. It tasted like a large container had been used for way too long and I am convinced the cooks don't try their food or the quality of the ingredients.\\n\\nNext up, I went with the Salmon. It was a taste of Ocean! You know, when you go to the beach and a subtle roller inverts you into the surf. You get a mouthful of salty ocean water crammed down your throat that two bottles of water can't wash away. Yep, that was the taste of Ocean I got with the Salmon. I now understand why they didn't have any for the bisque as they must have used it all. Please, god, start sampling your food!\\n\\nI had two drinks. The second was a very good Manhattan. I was fearful they would miss on that, but it was well done. I had to change it up as I tried the Mango Mojito. The bartender must go through the same process as the cooks: serve it up and never try your wares because it taksted more like a very lemony lemonade and I would never have a hint of what a mango tastes like based on that.\\n\\nSpare yourself, there are a TON of great restaurants I'm experiencing away from the resorts. For the cost, they shouldn't extort you for the convenience.\\n\\nOh, and the only time the water ever came to refill our empty water glasses was as we finished the check.

Based on the reviews and price point- i was expecting some value.   When we got there and sat down, my boyfriend's chair was wobbly (and made of plastic) and he said he thought he might break it, even though he is a normal sized person. Anyway, our waiter came over and we asked for a wine list (the one listed on their website) and he simply listed off wines like, \\"okay, we have pinot noir, cab, merlot and malbec.\\" He didn't provide us with a list and when my boyfriend asked for producer's or vintages he said he had to go check. When he came back he brought a bottle of cab with him as an example he said. My boyfriend asked about an actual wine list again and the waiter said they weren't giving them out automatically because the majority of the wine on there they did not have in stock. He brought the list over and we selected a wine that was listed as a 2007, when he received it, it was a 2008 and when we mentioned something to the waiter he just said \\"oh\\" and walked away. \\n\\nFor our apps, we ordered sea scallops, tuna tartar and the grilled asparagus and shitaki mushroom salad (they were out of fois gras, which were were only made aware of after we ordered it) The scallops had decent flavor, but there was grit in them. The tuna tartar also had somewhat decent flavor, but was totally overpowered by ginger. When we received the \\"salad\\" it essentially was a head of lettuce with the bottom chopped off in this odd crispy shell made of cheese around the bottom so the lettuce would stand up. There were only 2 pieces of asparagus and a couple mushrooms, which ended up not even being shitaki, but baby portabellos. There was also a dressing on it that got stuck in between the lettuce and had somehow coagulated so it was in chunks. We complained to our waiter about this and it was taken off our bill, but we could not believe they served it to us. \\nFor our entrees, I ordered the duck breast and he ordered the rack of lamb (they were out of the fillet, which again, we were made aware of after we ordered it). My duck breast was decent in portion size but was very overcooked. It was supposed to be cumin rubbed, but had some sort of glaze on it that was reminiscent of BBQ sauce. His rack of lamb was unforgivable. It was a $40 entree and before he even cut into it we could tell it was overcooked. The rack itself consisted of 3 bones and the portions of meat at the end were maybe about 2 oz each. My measurements here could be wrong, but it was surprisingly small. When he cut into it, it was gray and overcooked and we could tell it had clearly been previously frozen by the way the meat had kind of seized up after being cooked. Our bill came to exactly $100 after the gift certificate was used, with the waiter automatically putting on a gratuity of $25 (which we were aware of based on the gift certificate, but he did not deserve that much).  Our \\"thing\\" is to go to nice restaurants every chance we get and this was the worst, most disappointing meal we have ever had together including when either he or I have cooked for each other. I wish I could write a review in every paper warning people about this place.

Well they seated anyways with in 10 min. Of course we didn't get a popular window seat as the waitlist was over an hour, etc.  I had already expected that would be a long shot as they are first come first serve...\\n\\n2) It took forever for our waitress to even come to the table for the 1st time to greet us and take our order\\n\\n3) We requested bread which everyone typically gets first and our dinner came before our our waitress ever delivered it. Keep in mind people who were seated after us were served attended to and taken care of way faster \\n\\n3) Our food came and it was not really what it was all hyped up to be. I ordered the double pork chops and it came to the table kind of cold or should I say very Luke warm, it was tasteless and tasted like burnt char broil, It lacked flavor. However my husband's short ribs were pretty decent. \\n\\n4) Our waitress \\"Autumn\\" never really checked on us and it was about 15 min or so before she ever came around again and at that time, we were just ready to leave. We asked her for a box and she didn't even bother to give us a little togo bag to put it in like all the other guest around us had. So basically the service overall was a total WASTE of $$$. I wish we had of chosen one of our favorite restaurants we tend to stick to that would of been good food, better service and way much cheaper.\\n\\nI typically am willing to let some things go, but because it was a very special occasion and the $$$ we spent, it was not ok. I didn't want our night to be ruined anymore, so I didn't make a seen by trying to find and flag our server down, it already seemed super busy and chaotic. I did give feedback to the manager as we were leaving and he was totally understanding and apologetic and in agreeance that the flow of service did not match their standards and because of his great attitude is the reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 like I wanted.

Anyway, the interior of the boat looked great - it has minimalistic aesthetics with mostly greys and light wood tones. We were seated on the first floor right by the window with great views of the water. \\n\\nThe menu had just enough - a good variety but not too much that it was overwhelming. I decided to go non-seafood to start and ordered the wedge salad.

For my main I had the swordfish - it was nice and meaty with a tasty snow pea-shiitake stir fry on the side that had great flavor. For dessert I had the flourless chocolate cake - too big for me to finish myself but that didn't take away from it being super tasty. \\n\\nOur server, Som, was awesome. She was very cheerful, super helpful, and totally on point - I want her to be my server again if I ever come back.

It stands out like a beacon, among the numerous chains spattered around the Polaris area of North Columbus.\\n\\nNow, take what you will with a grain of salt--I didn't pay for very much at 101 Beer Kitchen, as my state professional organization paid for the overwhelming majority of our food and drink as part of their yearly happy hour.  However, I honestly did not expect either as much food as we received, nor did I expect that the food would be that damn tasty.\\n\\nParticular highlights?  The pretzel sticks were warm and delectably crispy, with just the right amount of salt.  The smoked wings were perfectly seasoned and had a glorious, smoky flavor.  But the homemade tater tots?  Those were the MVPs.  I'm not sure what sauce was drizzled over the top of those, but man, they elevated a simple potato to a whole new level.  \\n\\nSimilarly, the drinks I had were particularly tasty.  The Havana Sidecar was a tangy, unique take on a classic drink, and the pineapple juice/vodka I had after that was exactly how I liked it:  just enough ice and juice fresh from the fruit.\\n\\nIf I did have a disappointment, it might have been the flatbread pizzas.  The 'meat lovers' pie was perfectly fine, but the crust on the Margherita pizza quickly became soggy and disappointing.\\n\\nThat said, the key lime pie was damned right on.  I'm not usually a fan with any sort of vanilla with key lime, but the sauce drizzled over the top of my slice was nothing short of brilliant.  I'd easily go back to 101 BC just for a slice of that pie.\\n\\nOur service was great (especially considering that there were easily 30 of us at the happy hour!), the food was phenomenal, and the drinks hit the spot.

This place gets it right with everything.\\n\\nNestled in a strip mall its decor is Deep South BBQ.  Reminds me of what someone's back yard might look like, but indoors.  My family of 4 ordered The Motherload.  The description reads \\"Enough for 6! Brisket, pulled pork, turkey, 1/2 slab of ribs, 1/2 chicken, 2 sausages, 6 individual sides, cornbread, and Texas toast.\\"  They were out of turkey and substituted pulled chicken.  Everything was tender and juicy.  Everything.  The ribs had competition pull and was moist and tender.  I easily pulled the brisket apart with my fingers.  It was moist.  Pulled pork had a great amount of bark on it.  Was very flavorful and smoky, tender and juicy.  The sausage was spiced just right.  Had the right amount of spice.  Yeah.  It was juicy, too.  Only meat I didn't get a chance to try was the chicken.  My oldest daughter ate a piece of chicken and raved.  They cut the breast in half and I could see the juices running out of the meat.\\n\\nIf it says anything about the meat quality we ate all the meat.  Just the 4 of us except for the chicken.  The sides were also very good.  Baked beans were smoky.  Tasted like they were also smoked and cooked in their BBQ sauce.  The vinegar slaw was tangy and sweet with a good amount of crunch.  The green beans were exceptional.  The bacon chunks they cook with it adds a great flavor and a hint of smoke.  They are very well seasoned also.  Tender.  The hush puppies are served piping hot.  It was the first thing I ate on the plate.  I didn't try the Mac n Cheese.  The corn bread was served in loaves and was pretty standard fare for cornbread.\\n\\nI really liked their sauce.  The regular is something by itself I'd buy in a store.  The bourbon sauce was the best tasting bourbon sauce I've ever had anywhere.  Sweet with a bourbon note on the finish.  I let my wife try it and she didn't give it back.  I stuck with the hot.  Not so over the top hot I couldn't enjoy it.  Just a touch of heat.

The viewing of the seafood case with shuckers there was cool to showcase the fresh seafood. We were seated in the side room and not main dining which made it seem more intimate for the 9 of us.

The options I chose were their oysters (add 2 dollars for big fin style which oysters grilled with cheese and garlic on top), lobster (at least 7 ounce) and the ooey gooey dessert.\\n\\nThe bread service here is so good! Its like a ciabatta and it has a good crust but is still airy and soft on the inside. I almost filled my self up with this. The oysters were pretty good but didn't taste as fresh. The lobster was cooked well and not chewy. It was a pretty good size tail too at probably 7 ounces. I've tried a bite of the filet from the mdm menu and even though it was medium rare it just wasn't that tender. \\n\\nThe dessert, ooey gooey, was like a brownie but topping it off with ice cream would've been so much better.

She offered waters and then went missing. When we did finally order drinks, they took a very long to come out. Maybe around 15m? I seriously considered just walking up to the bar and ordering a drink while I waited for my drink at the table. After a while, I considered just leaving and going across the street to a different pub. \\n\\nThey brought our first round out and my beer was wrong. They didn't bring my correct drink out until much later when I was almost done with my food. That brings us to the food. \\n\\nThe food came out even slower than the drinks. It took well over 45m from order to service. This long wait was compounded by the drink confusion. \\n\\nThe quality of the food was just OK. For the price I was paying and experience at the other Hobnob locations, I was expecting better. My burger was dry and overdone (they didn't ask me how I wanted it cooked), my wife's soup was too oily, and the fries were mushy. \\n\\nTo top it all off, they brought a beer from a different table to us and left. Upon realizing their mistake 5m later, they took the beer off our table and gave it to the other table(!). Gross. I didn't touch the beer but it made me wonder what table my earlier beers came from and if someone had touched them...\\n\\nWhen we left, were told that we would be comp'd my missing drink. I gave them my credit card but then I was billed me for the extra drink.

In the end, we ordered both, but only after we tried their rissotto, which was perfectly cooked, and their version of clam chowder. \\n\\nThe clam chowder was made to order with fresh clams in the shell and haddock. Accompanied by red skin potatoes, the soup came out more brothy than what most people might expect out of a chowder. While the soup had cream in it, it was missing that creamy and luscious texture. On the other hand, it was much lighter, which was food at the moment because it allowed me to eat my actual meal.\\n\\nNow, back to the crispy beef hash.... This is a must get item. There was a great balance between the the soft poached eggs and it's sun-dried tomato hollandaise with the spicy crispy beef hash. Crispy on the outside on BOTH sides, and soft on the inside is what you should expect to get when you order this round of yummy goodness. If you're looking for something lighter though, try the salmon. It's flavorful but not over sauced, and there's a million little flavors packed into one dish. The blue foot mushrooms provide a nice earthy counterpoint to the protein.

I and my extended family had been going to the Oak Room for 13 years and loved the food. The service at the time was nothing short of professional. On this visit I had the Delmonico Steak which was good after I cut away the fat. My wife had lobster over rice which had to be a health code violation. It was oversalted, and charred. It was difficult to distinguish what was actually lobster as it was so dried out. The kale that topped it was jet black and scary looking. The odor of the dish was disturbing. Others in my party had the steak salad which was an appetizer size salad with chunks of steak. It tasted fine but was too small for 25.00. One other had the Halibut that was reportedly good. The menu itself is very limited with few selections. It is obvious not a lot of thought has gone into the food end of the business. As I mentioned the priority is now the bar.

However, we did see signs in a couple of windows with \\"coming soon\\".  Parking is in a large lot, in front of all the stores.  Nic & Luc has a very minimalistic decor.  No frills, no circus clowns.  The tables and chairs are movable and the square footage is spacious.  After receiving a menu, you order and everything is made in the moment.  No warming lights and no microwave.  The ingredients are organic, locally sourced, everything is made from scratch.  They even make their own chorizo and slow cook pulled pork.  This is a Mom & Pop place, not a chain, which cannot be anything but good.  No grease smell, slick floors or egg on the wall.  I ordered 2 eggs over easy, wheat toast, home fries and bacon crispy with two lattes.  I like coffee and lots of it.  Hubby ordered an omelette and sourdough toast with homemade mixed berry jam and a Nespresso.  All gone.  The menu has something for everyone including vegetarians and vegans.  Even a raw bowl.  I'm very interested in going back very soon to try one of their lunch bowls or sammiches.  BTW, they also sell their own homemade jams in small jars with no preservatives or weird additives.

Tables are piled on top of each other, so families who suffered through the long wait had to put impatient kids cheek to jowl with tables full of obnoxious drunks talking politics.  We were fortunate enough to land a quiet table in the corner, but I saw one family give up after sitting 30 minutes at their table (after waiting for an hour) because their neighbors were boorish and inescapable given proximity.\\n\\nService was mostly prompt, and we liked our server.  Many of the dishes were really good.  However, there were a few glaring issues:\\n\\n* The biscuits were so overcooked that our 3 year old refused them.  You know what it takes to get that kid to refuse carbs?  I had never seen it happen.\\n* The \\"Shrimp and Grits\\" had 0 shrimp.  They claimed it was \\"shrimp butter.\\"  I'm from the southeast, and I've never heard of that.  That feels like borderline false advertising, like they ran out of shrimp and were covering for the fact that it was still on the menu.\\n* Some of the service was spotty, like an unfilled waterglass for a half hour.\\n\\nI'm hoping most of this is due to them just being unprepared to handle a big day like Thanksgiving, but with all the other options in Boston, we'll never know.

We were taken to our table after about 20 minutes and our orders were taken right after. I had the build your own scramble with hash, the coconut almond gf French toast and the hubby ordered the Ty\`s Big breakfast and a bowl of soup. I did like my food, but everything was slightly underwhelming. The potatoes were under seasoned and the eggs over cooked. They kept the coffee flowing and checked up on us pretty frequently.

The decor definitely could have been out of a swanky New Orleans restaurant with french-style wooden chairs, carpets and chandeliers but juxtaposed with graphic wall art and the \\"Live Nudes\\" bathroom sign.

We were told that they could take upwards of 20-30 minutes, so we just said to bring out everything as it came (it seems to be their standard practice anyway). They have 4 different kinds of souffle pancakes including original, bananas foster, strawberries and cream and chocolate hazelnut. We went with the strawberries and cream and they came out before everything else! There were 3, airy, fluffy pancakes, whipped cream, strawberries and 2 sides - 1 being syrup and the other... gooey frosting? I don't know, but it was sugary and delicious.\\n\\nAfter our pancakes, came our first round of drinks. The bf got an alcoholic cafe au lait which was delicious. He likes sugary, creamy drinks and it hit the spot. I went with a blackberry whisky drink. It was strong, but balanced and very good!\\n\\nNext came our 3 Little Pigs which was 2 each of bacon, sausage and pork belly. While the bacon and sausage were standard, the pork belly was KILLER! I wanted so much more.\\n\\nLastly, came our cubano sandwich with mustard sauce on the side and shoe string fries. Even the fries were perfect!! Salted just right, hot and crunchy. This placed didn't mess up a single thing! With our cubano, we ordered another round of drinks. This time, my boyfriend got the bloody mary and I went with the red sangria. I must tell you that I hate bloody marys and never order them. I have now had 3 bloody marys in my life that I would order for myself and savor. 1: Ruby Slipper in New Orleans. 2: BOOTLEG SPECIAL! 3: Highland Kitchen in Somerville. The trick is that it's actually seasoned and delicious! Not nasty-ass V8 and vodka. It was so good! My sangria was also sweet (but not too), fruity and just right.\\n\\nThe service was great. They must have filled up our water glasses 8 times. They were friendly and everything came out as we needed. It might have been weird if we weren't sharing and I had to wait for my sandwich until after his pancakes were done, but they actually do say on the menu to share.

I also had a beef empanada the day before, but their beef was darker and didn't seem to have that much life as it was probably used in other beef dishes.\\n\\nThe cheese and guava empanada was interesting.

The bartender, Syd, was super nice and attentive throughout the night. We got the Speed Ball, the Yellowhammer, and the Pina-Coco Mojito. If you are into sweeter drinks, and/or are a fan of Yakult, the Speed Ball is right for you! The Yellowhammer was slightly on the stronger side, but packed with pineapple and coconut flavors. The Pina-Coco Mojito was just right-- with the perfect amount of sweetness and fizz, not to mention that it was refreshing for a summer night. For food, we ordered the Fried Oyster Po' Boy with Sweet Potato Fries, the Garlic Noodles, and the Shrimp and Clam two-some boil. The Po' Boys are good for one person, but also for two to share if your party is getting other small plates. We wanted to add pasta to our boil, but the Garlic Noodles really lived up to the hype! Seriously to die for. The two-some boil with Shrimp and Clams was great, as well. There was a generous amount of seafood, and we were satisfied with the rich, garlicky flavor of the Bootleg sauce, which had just the right amount of kick (definitely worth your buck)! For dessert, we had to go with the Banana Foster Beignets with Vanilla ice cream, as recommended by Syd. The food was phenomenal, and the service was great. In addition to the best bartender we could've asked for that night, the hostess was super friendly, and the boss Steve had checked in to see how our night was going.

However, the best part was actually the cornmeal pancake underneath, with Jalapeno butter.  The butter was incredible!  The potatoes were equally as good (they were cooked in wagyu beef tallow.  How could it NOT be?!?).

They have one of the \\"later\\" HH in Columbus, running from 5-7, which I always appreciate. They offer $5 drinks (wine, beer, cocktails) and $5 tapas - a steal! Unfortunately, HH is limited to the bar and cocktail tables inside, so cannot enjoy the deals on the patio :( We were easily able to snag a table when we first arrived though, so that was a nice bonus. Only complaint is that since they are cocktail tables, there isn't a ton of space for all the plates and drinking glasses, so must be careful to not knock anything over - a tiny bit of a larger table might be nice!\\n\\nFor drinks, I had a glass of pinot grigio, which was very refreshing for summer and a nice pair to our tapas. For $5, you really can't beat it - good quality and a great price. For food, we split the hummus verde and the costillos. The hummus has a beautiful green hue and excellent flavor - a little chunkier than store-bought hummus, which I enjoy. Comes with a nicely grilled flatbread, which is definitely hearty enough to withstand the hummus. Our waiter also brought us veggies to finish up the hummus, which was so kind! The costillos were also delicious. The blue cheese and mushroom sauce was so decadent and a perfect match for the short ribs, which literally fell apart as you touched them - a sign of a great meat! Our waiter also brought us a complimentary tasting of a mixed veggie dish, which was a nice start to the meal, in addition to the fresh bread and oil on the table (rare to find). We split these 2 dishes between 3 of us, and it was enough to fill us up (at least mostly).\\n\\nBarcelona is an excellent HH spot in CBus.

There were 3 locations listed on Yelp, so we chose the one that had the most reviews, which happened to be located in the Alberta district.\\n\\nWhen you walk in, you order at the front cash register and then find yourself a seat. They call your name when the food is ready to be picked up at the front. They have both indoor seating and a covered outdoor seating with heated lamps, although it still seemed too cold to be sitting outside, so we grabbed one of the few tables inside. They also have a bar table area that looks into the kitchen, in case you come by yourself or can't find a table.\\n\\nNow on to the food! I got the \\"Reggie Deluxe\\", which is fried chicken, bacon, cheese, sausage gravy, biscuit and egg on top. It was decadent and delicious. The gravy had a little kick to it. My husband got the same thing, but with shiitake mushroom gravy instead, and he liked it a lot. All of the flavors came together well. It's quite a big dish, so be sure to come hungry! My husband got the orange juice and mentioned that it was excellent, too.\\n\\nWhen you're finished, you bus your own table. One other side note to mention is that street parking can be difficult to find since it's in a popular district with other restaurants nearby. Also, we arrived on a Wed. around 9am and there was no line, but I read that this place can get very crowded on weekends and peak times, so just something to keep in mind!"},{"name":"Tibby's New Orleans Kitchen","address":"2203 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"This is hands down our new favorite restaurant...my only qualm is that it took us so long to try it!\\n\\nAtmosphere- warm, fun, and inviting\\n\\nFood- OMG...it couldn't be any more amazing.

I actually ended up getting a slightly unusual dish as far as Vietnamese spots go, a pho with lamb. The scallions were plentiful and fresh. Broth was fairly mild.

Your that used to the smell of rancid oil that has the equivalent potency of a bag of used Urinal cakes. I'm Not even Joking Really!!! It was so offensively obvious that the bread was bad I immediately brought up the issue to the Manager asking how this was even possible. I asked him to smell it for himself then let him know this could very well make someone ill . He stated that they \\"make everything fresh daily\\" and don't know how this was \\"possible \\". In other words oh shit you caught me being lazy and I'm barely sorry. I also asked where such bread was kept because if it wasn't dated then what else goes without anyone noticing. Or is it usually taken care of until someone complains or gets totally sick and throws up. Then they say \\"we will check the rest of our bread in a bit\\", because as soon as I walk out we all know the service goes back to CRAP ! I'm sick of all these older places giving up there quality because they feel like competition is too tough, so they figure you should be happy with whatever service they give you.

Really Blue Star it's not just BREAD it's food, it goes in my BODY as well as all your other customers and if you have someone new or to lazy that won't check dates or make fresh batches out of blatant lack of knowledge, THEN don't put them in a position that could possibly ruin someone's health. Kitchen management is very serious and people can have serious affects to there health when served rancid oils moldy breads and so on ...

A few more meals came at least 5 minutes later and we were then informed that they ran out of the soup that one of us had ordered. We had two guests who both ordered salads which took the longest to prepare and were brought out one at a time at least a few minutes apart.

First off, the restaurant is just beautiful in a modern, funky, spacious kind of way, with cool copper tones, round lamps, a brick oven and plenty of seating for parties of any kind (cozy booths for the groups, chic bar tables for the trendy, white tablecloth-ed tables for the intimate, etc.) The service was friendly and attentive through and through (almost too attentive sometimes--we had 2 waiters ask us if we'd like to order a drink within the span of 3 minutes!). My friend even marveled at how cute the waiters were (so bonus points for good-looking staff).\\n\\nBut good looks and funky decor are nothing if the food isn't memorable. Thankfully, it is.

An enormous plate of fresh greens in a delicious vinaigrette with plenty of spiced seared tuna slices, artichokes, cherry tomatoes and hard-boiled eggs with sardines on top. I devoured everything except the hard-boiled eggs (which I don't like) and it was delicious. I was hesitant to order a salad, since I was heading to the gym straight after, but this thing filled up even my bottomless stomach!\\n\\nMy friend had Truffled Egg Salad on Toasted Peppered Brioche. Wowee Dowee! It tasted even better than it sounded! I'm not a bread fan, but the peppered brioche was absolutely delicious, toasted to a crisp perfection.

I was near the wharf, the Boston Public Market this little spot is across the street from it. With 4.5 stars on yelp, what could go wrong?! Well, I don't know how many staff they normally have but they were VERY busy. It was a Monday afternoon around lunch time and people were lined up outside the door! I get to the front to ask about the waiting period for 4 of us. My name was placed on a piece of paper and I was going to get a phone call once a table frees up. 45 minutes because 1hr 20 minutes for four. We ordered two lobster rolls because I had to have it! One with greens (1$ extra) the other with fries. The lobster roll did not disappoint though. It was piled high with lobster meat and wasn't overly seasoned or sauced up. The buttery flavor of the roll which was toasted to perfection was a great addition. The bread was French like? Buttery of course but hefty enough to handle the meat but light and fluffy all the same. The fries were cooked to perfection and salted well enough. Good portion so I split it with my friend! 31$ for a lobster roll is not cheap. Elsewhere, it's $18-22 at most in other areas. Also ordered the sampler which was a mixture of raw seafood (lobster ceviche/ crab salad/ clams/ oysters/ mussels with lemon wedges and horseradish for dipping for 75$). Everything was worth the wait. The food did taste great and I was eyeing other people's plates all smelt wonderful! The only thing I didn't enjoy was the wait. There's no seating area so after\\nYou put your name, go take a walk and wait for that call. However, I personally saw a man who was there much later than another gentleman get seated first. I also saw a local come in and was recognized by one of the staff behind the bar and was seated and served before myself and another group who was there first. Just like the other guy, my wait was long and I think it's even harder for a big group. The bar is good for single or double occupancy but anything more, you have to wait for the table unless you don't mind seating separately. The staff though, were nice and patient. I hope to see them grow their restaurant or move it somewhere bigger I don't think it's a bad investment, maybe more will come back if they didn't have to wait 1.5 hrs to eat lunch on a weekday!

Absolutely amazing, especially during the night time. The restaurant is located on the 30th floor of the US Bancorp building and is surrounded by sweeping views of the city. It's very spacious with a white table cloth dining room setup and a gorgeous horseshoe bar. The bar area is huge! There are plenty of places to sit including large booths, high top tables, and seating right in front of the windows. The window seating gets taken quickly, so if you want a seat by the window, your best bet is to get there before or after happy hours. I sat at the bar and received exceptional service! Unfortunately, I didn't get the names of the two bartenders that assisted me, but they were workin' that bar like magic.\\n \\nTheir happy hour menu is excellent! They've got tons of discounted appetizers and drinks to choose from. Happy hour is every day and all day on Sundays (at the bar and in the lounge area only)! Woop woop! I loves me a good ol' happy hour deal! One of the bartenders suggested I try their seared steelhead and snow crab dish since it's a crowd favorite. I ordered this along with a Caesar salad, and a few cocktails. All I can say is daaaayum! Everythang was scrumptious! I'm not too familiar with steelhead as salmon is usually my fish of choice and a California common. Steelhead is really popular in Oregon, and now I can understand why. It was tender and flaky at the touch, and the snow crab only accentuated the taste even more. The b√©arnaise sauce tasted incredible! It was notably house-made and I could tell this with each bite. The entire dish retained a great amount of flavor.\\n \\nI also really enjoyed the Caesar salad as well. It appeared to be just a classic Caesar at first glance, but the dressing has a really enjoyable lemony taste and the garlic croutons really brought it to life. The cocktails were very tasty as well! I had their pomegranate margarita and an elderflower greyhound. Both were delicious but my favorite was the margarita. I like my drinks deathly sweet, and the marg was just that! I'm used to drinking greyhounds with orange juice, but the elderflower was a refreshing variation. It was different but I still liked it. Both drinks were pretty strong too. I mean, these happy hour deals are no joke y'all!\\n \\nThey were playing some great tunes in the background. After I ate my food, I moseyed on over to an open window seat to enjoy the beautiful view with my drink in hand. The view up there is really pretty. This spot would make a killer date night!

I forgot, did I make him pick a brunch place?? I must be cos he and the rest just depend on me to suggest almost every single time we meet up. Then again, like M said once, I have better suggestion (maybe taste too? ;) )  Once a while, I really need to give others a chance to shine (or perhaps the pressure to suggest a wonderful place to eat every single time can be much :( ).\\n\\nOh well, thanks to fellow yelpers who gave directions/instructions on where to park. Parking is a breeze at the parking garage belonging to the apartment on site. The restaurant does validate parking. \\n\\nAMBIENCE (3/5)\\nThe place was definitely lively. I definitely was not thrilled with the table we were seated. Those chairs the worst ( = uncomfortable) and what was worse than that? The table has this rod that was positioned the most awkward height. I could not possibly put my feet on it or was I suppose to put my legs over it?? Of cos not. (See pic) Ugh!! Don't get me started, if I start to recall how uncomfortable I was sitting throughout the meal, I would give the ambience a zero. Moving on (quickly!!) ...\\n\\nFOOD (4/5)\\nI remembered ordering Shrimps & Grits. I guessed I wanted to compare to the one at Atlanta Breakfast Club. The shrimp ratio here was sad :(  The Gulf  Shrimp & Grits at Atlanta Breakfast Club definitely won hands down. However, to be fair, for someone who does not like grits, the one here was pretty good. \\n\\nSERVICE (5/5)\\nI really like our server. I thought she was friendly, though she put in a wrong order for one of us. However,  Moustafa absolutely disliked her. I wasn't entirely understand why. I think he felt she was rude. Maybe just to him? One of us said he felt she was not too nice to Moustafa compared to how she was with us. Hmmm.. was it because Moustafa was late?? Anyhow, since Moustafa not writing this review, I would rate it a 5/5. Our server was overall nice, she put in the wrong order but service staffs do made mistakes like that when the restaurant is super busy. \\n\\nSadly I doubt I would return to Cultivate since Moustafa was really unhappy after the brunch.

I think the 4.5 average star rating Neptune Oyster currently has is pretty darn accurate. When planning a trip to Boston, I went to Yelp to explore the types of great food that I just \\"had\\" to try and Neptune Oyster kept coming up. \\n\\nWe decided to put our name in at around 5:15 PM on a Saturday after seeing a play in the theater district. It was very cramped/crowded inside. This is a small place and I can see exactly why there is always such a long wait for a table here, even if it is also supposed to be very high quality. When we walked in, we could barely even budge because there were some people waiting for a table. It seems that they had been called letting them know their table was ready but that it actually wasn't quite ready. I later learned that they call you when the check gets sent out to a table, but that sometimes people take longer to pay/leave. A group cut in front of us, put their name in, and the hostess went away. It took a minute to get her attention because there's no designated hostess stand (I guess there isn't room for it). We were quoted a one hour wait. \\n\\nWe enjoyed exploring North End (including a stop at Mike's Pastry), then we were called after exactly an hour had passed. When we arrived back at Neptune Oyster, our table was ready and we were seated immediately. We were seated at the end of a six-person table which was occupied by four guys. We were in such close proximity to them that it almost felt awkward to have any other conversation. We could hear everything they said; we were all at the same table, after all! In the end, the guys ended up just including us in their conversation for the rest of our meal, including inviting us to add our phones to their pile. It ended up enhancing the meal, making it more fun, but it could have been really awkward. This was supposed to be a \\"sister date,\\" but there's nothing at all intimate about dining at Neptune Oyster. \\n\\nI'm a recent college grad and my sister is a college student, so we ended up deciding to split the lobster roll ($27). We were nervous our waiter wouldn't allow it or make us feel guilty, but he was totally understanding about it. We ordered it hot with butter. They cut it in half, gave us two plates, and two ketchup containers. That was very thoughtful! There was also no extra cost for splitting the plate. The lobster was VERY fresh and slightly stringy. I got a little piece of lobster stuck in my teeth at some point. It was perfect hot with the butter, although I'm interested what the cold mayo tastes like (maybe if I ever have it during the hotter months). The fries were good, but a little salty for my liking--nothing special. The lobster roll was the clear standout. \\n\\nThere isn't enough space to wait by the bathroom with servers going from behind the bar to the kitchen, etc. I tried to wait, but then ended up waiting at the table while keeping my eye on the bathroom door. \\n\\nI DEFINITELY recommend Neptune Oyster for the lobster roll, as long as you're aware it's small, not fancy atmosphere with quite the fancy prices, and there will be a wait (no reservations). If you're aware of that/prepared for it going in, you'll definitely walk away a fan like I did."},{"name":"WUBurger Gourmet","address":"1128 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"Saw cooks through the order window exchanging money with each other and using those same bare hands (no washing) to touch food.

The food is good and the service was friendly. \\n\\nMy family and I have been frequenting this restaurant for over 6 years and had a great rapport with Prima, the manager. Everything seemed fine up until last month when her energy started to change. We first noticed that anytime we'd call for delivery, there would always be a reason why they couldn't deliver. For example, we were once told that there would be a 90 min wait and we told her that was fine but then she told us they still couldn't deliver! Like why even tell me about the wait if you were still going to say no?! That was annoying because we already had our hopes up and minds set on sushi. Being long term clients, we just figured they must have been very busy lately, we did call about an hour before close. \\n\\nThis last time, we ordered two boxes of the beef teriyaki lunch special as well as Winter maki. In general, they have been slacking on their beef teriyaki. It used to be great but lately, whether I dine in or take out, it has been really fatty along the edges of the meat, deeming some pieces inedible. This time, the maki was good but the meat looked almost completely raw. Usually a light pink/brown in color, this meat looked red and the texture as if it were merely thawed and barely cooked at all. So gross. I called immediately to complain (the first time ever, the food's usually great so I've never asked for a refund before). The manager answered and when I told her what the problem was she did apologize but then asked me if I could just cook it myself. Really? I just paid you almost $30 for YOU to prepare my food and yet you're asking ME to do your job? Unprofessional. When I told her I was worried about cross contamination because the raw meat was laid across the bed of rice and that I'd simply prefer a refund, she gave me a hard time. First she said yes, then she retracted her statement and offered a store credit instead. Again, being loyal customers, we reluctantly accepted. \\n\\nRight after agreeing to the credit, she slips in, \\"And by the way, we won't be delivering to you anymore. Our driver said he was almost robbed at GUNPOINT delivering to your area. But you're still welcome to dine in.\\" \\n\\nI was vexed! Shocked and appalled at her accusations! She assumed, because I live in Mattapan, a predominantly black neighborhood, that my area must be riddled with crime and violence. This isn't the case. Seeing as she doesn't actually do the deliveries herself, she was clearly unaware of the fact that I actually live in a gated complex with a guard house at the entrance. Her accusations sounded like she was pulling them out of thin air, straight bullshitting me because when my sister chimed in (it was on speaker) and mentioned that we do in fact have guards, the manager threw in, \\"Security did intervene and stopped the robbery,\\" therefore trying to further bullshit me!!! Come on!! My family has been living in this complex for over 30 years and incidents like this do not occur. If something as life threatening as this did occur, why weren't the police notified? She was clearly lying which was honestly a blow to the heart because we've had such a great relationship up until that moment. \\n\\nWe were regulars that always walked in with big smiles on our faces, ran up the bill, and left generous tips. We even brought them new clientele. We didn't understand where she was coming from and by that point we didn't care. Her words were hurtful, slanderous lies. We even called the guard house, after getting our money back, and they confirmed that the situation I described never happened. The guard even went on to say they probably just don't want to deliver to Mattapan. DISCRIMINATION. That sickens me. As a human, a woman of color, and as a loyal, paying customer. \\n\\nI would've give Ichiro Sushi NO STARS if possible after having such racist service and slander thrown my way! Shame on you Ichiro Sushi! Thanks for taking the time to read! This sort of injustice, prejudice, and disgraceful customer service really needs to stop and people need to speak up for themselves!

They had flavor that was tasty, but what I imagine was some butter thrown on to toss them prior to coming out, became a huge puddle of dark yellow mess.\\n\\nSo I left a little downhearted that the food didn't live up to my grandiose Portland foodie expectations, but I'd like to come back and try during happy hour when it's not such a ding in my pocket for an overall meal that was just okay."},{"name":"Pho Pasteur","address":"682 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Not sure what the hype is.

For example, after being in France and gobbling up plates of steak tartare at pretty much any local cafe, I couldn't believe this fancy little baby was $15. Don't come hungry, come ready to have delectable bites. \\n\\nChampagne actually wasn't expensive, $26 for a bottle! Bone marrow was, well, bone marrow served with sourdough and sea salty tasting salad. My dinner companion and I were talking so much that we barely ate and I wish that I had finished my marrow soaked bread and had more greens! I did pretty much single-handedly take on the tartare, which was seasoned with gochujang and topped with a quail egg and crunchy peanuts.  Crab Rangoon was similar to something you'd get at Trader Vics with an richer, earthier sauce then you'd expect to be served. \\n\\n10 layer chocolate cake with caramel ganache mousse and malted ice cream (which imo was the best part). \\n\\nI definitely plan to return during happy hour which has amazing specials!

What is so special about it?  And is it worth the drive?  The answers are \\"lots, everything and yes\\".  We were staying about 10 miles away and wondered if it was worth the drive, but all the Yelp reviews were so good that we thought we would try it - being big fans of AYCE Chinese buffets and wanting to make this a special evening.  \\n\\nWhen we arrived, we saw a steady stream of people filing in and thought hmm, we must be on the right track.  When we went in and saw how full the place was, and how many Asian people were in there )I would say most of the guests were Asian) we definitely knew we were on the right track for sure.\\n\\nThe variety of food on offer was fantastic, but most appealing was the circular sushi bar with a huge variety of sushi, all freshly made in front of you - and the sushi tasted like you were sitting in an expensive Japanese restaurant - fresh, tasty and just delicious.  I lost track of how many times I went up there to reload my plate.\\n\\nThere was a lot of seafood on offer which my in-laws loved - having just arrived here from the UK, they were over the moon at the crab legs and shrimp - and my husband was groaning with pleasure over the spare ribs and said they were \\"excellent\\" (he's not prone to using words like that, I must admit) - so I knew they must really be extraordinarily good (I'm a pescetarian so don't eat meat or chicken or pork, so I couldn't taste them but he showed me how tender they were by pulling the meat off the bone).  I went mad with the bok choi and string beans and coconut shrimp (and of course the sushi) and have to say again how fresh and delicious the sushi was. \\n\\nThe service was good (clearing of plates etc.), the number of different dishes on offer was impressive, and also the fact that the dishes in the buffet were fairly small, and constantly replenished, rather than large portions sitting there for ages.  The staff was constantly bringing out new portions of food.  While we'd hoped that this dinner would be a great time for chit chat and catching up with family, it was surprisingly quiet, with just the sound of nom-nom-nom and the cracking of crab legs :-)\\n\\nMy husband also loved the duck (he's not a fan of rare duck and said this was nice and done to perfection) - he was just one happy bunny.  The only curiosity was a dish with the dumplings - labeled \\"Meat Bum\\".  What's a meat bum?\\n\\nAnyway - was it worth the 10 mile drive?  a thousand times YES.  Was I completely satisfied, being a pescetarian?  YES YES YES and YES (I think I ate an entire plate just filled with green veggies and mushrooms) .  Would we recommend it?  Oh absolutely.  If in Orlando, would we go back?  Even if the drive was twice this, we would make a point of going back.\\n\\nFresh, plentiful and delicious - better than any other AYCE Chinese Buffet.

She offered us the house made award winning beers, but it was late and we were already tired so we decided against it and got the strawberry lemonade and cream soda. The lemonade was very delicious! It was thick and seemed to use real strawberries in it. The cream soda was also AMAZING! I'm not generally a fan of cream soda but this one was the best. \\n\\nIt took so long for us to choose what we wanted to eat. The menu is over 20 pages long! We decided to share a soup, which only comes as a one size option and we upgraded to a bread bowl. The top cut out part of the bread bowl was completely SOAKED in butter. Ugh. The soup itself had a good flavor, but there was SO much oil pooled up on top of it.. it was hard to look at. (see image) \\n\\nAs an entree, I ended up going with a Parmesan crusted chicken entree served with broccoli and cheesy mashed potato. The chicken had an okay flavor. It wasn't until I was done with the first piece of chicken that I realized each time I had to cut into it, a HUGE amount of oil seeped out of it and it made me not want the second piece anymore. :( The broccoli was fine. Tasted like normal broccoli. But the potatoes.. have you ever microwaved mashed potatoes at home and you accidentally microwave it too long and it crusts up in several areas? That's how this one was. It was crusted in certain places and was very clearly microwaved.. My entree was overall disappointing. \\n\\nAlex went with a small pizza with pepperoni. It tasted pretty good! Except it was just a little too doughy for us. \\n\\nService was eh. For a dead night with almost nobody there, service was a little slow. I didn't understand why until I noticed all of the night time servers sitting around by the bar talking to other people at a high tops while they weren't busy with their guests. \\n\\nI'm unsure if I ever want to return to BJ's.

We were not a huge fan of the fact that when you pay the tip option starts with 18% tip. There is no wait staff at all, and to get a drink you have to get it yourself in the other restaurant. Considering that the Ranch on Fire was hotter than expected, having a drink is a must. You have to get your own refills. 2. The food truck is not well marked from the street; therefore easy to miss. 3. The wings are very unique; however, they ones we had were all a dry rub and the spices were super strong. There was no taste of garlic on the garlic Parmesan at all. The Chili Limon had a very strong vinegar flavor. The others almost tasted like straight pepper. 4. They are pricey for what you get. The blue cheese and ranch are $.75 each. In our opinion those could be included when you're paying $7 for 5 wings. \\n\\nOverall, in our opinion we would not go back.

Just find somewhere else to go.\\n\\nMy wife, friends and I came here as a part of Portland Dining month and ordered from the dining month menu.

The menu, which offered six different items, seemed promising. I had the poke and oysters as an appetizer, prime rib as a main and cheesecake as a dessert.\\n\\nThe poke was good, but then again it is sushi grade fish that was cubed and stacked. I am unsure how hard that is to manage. the oysters we're small but not bad. And then somewhere on my plate were four burned potato chips. I am unsure of the point of those.\\n\\nAfter waiting over 20 minutes for our main course to arrive I received undercooked asparagus, a medium prime rib that was actually cooked rare and world's most depressing mashed potatoes and gravy.

In Houston, there's really no such thing as waiting 2+ hours for dinner let alone a box of pastries... in fact I don't even think I'd wait more than one hour for food at a restaurant (I get hangry); however, at Neptune, more often than not, you will have to give your name and phone number to the host/hostess if you want to have dinner at this restaurant. \\n\\nI'd recommend putting your name on the list around 5pm if you're planning to eat dinner around 7 or 8pm. My boyfriend and I put our name on the list at 5pm on a Saturday night and we were told that it would be a 3 hour wait. Being tourists, we were perfectly fine with dinner around 8pm. In fact, we took this extra time to explore and had dessert before dinner at one of the local pastry shops nearby. \\n\\nAround 7pm I decided to look at my phone to see what time it was. That's when I realized that I had two missed calls from Neptune (apparently, my phone was on silent). Luckily, while I was staring at my phone, the host from Neptune called for a 3rd attempt (3rd time's a charm) and I picked up right away. Lesson to be learned: After you put you name on the list at Neptune, make sure the ringer volume on your phone is turned on! \\n\\nAfter hearing that we didn't have to wait an extra hour to be seated, my boyfriend and I walked to Neptune and we were seated at the bar within 10 minutes. For starters, we ordered a few different kinds of raw oysters from their terrific selection. I wish we could have tried every single type but we might have spoiled our appetite just a tad by eating dessert before dinner... oops. \\n\\nWe ordered 2 Wellfleet, 2 Pleasant Bay, 2 Summerside, 2 Beausoleil, 4 Kumamoto, and 2 Jonah Crab Claws. The crab claws weren't anything special, just regular stone crab claws, I probably wouldn't order them again. My favorite oysters were the Wellfleet and the Kumamoto. The Wellfleet were salty and buttery (YUM) and the Kumamoto really did taste like cold, creamy, honeydew! I thought that Neptune's description of the Kumamoto was weird but after eating these oysters, I could definitely taste the sweet honeydew flavor. Highly recommend the Kumamoto oysters.\\n\\nThe Johnny Cakes were our next appetizer and I would also recommend ordering this. It's the perfect combination of sweet and salty. The salty portion consisted of smoked trout, American black caviar, and creme fraiche in a \\"tower\\" on top of a large sweet, corn \\"pancake.\\" Spread the smoked fish, caviar and creme fraiche over the entire Johnny cake, cut off a little piece and eat it altogether in one bite. It's divine. I wouldn't recommend eating these elements separately as the smoked fish would probably be extremely salty by itself. It's perfect when paired with the sweet johnny cake. \\n\\nOur last dish was an entree of seared scallops and duck confit on a bed of microgreens and roasted brussel sprouts, I LOVED the duck confit and the seared scallops. The scallops were seared on the outside and nice and tender on the inside; however, I did notice that a couple of the scallops were completely white on the inside while the others were underdone (still opaque) in the center. I'm not sure if Neptune was aiming for more of a \\"seared tuna\\" type of scallop (cooked on the outside, raw on the inside) or if they just took the scallops off the pan a little early. I didn't mind either way as the flavor was still spot-on (plus, I like raw scallops), but I can see how someone who enjoys fully cooked sea diver scallops may be a little concerned. The duck confit was tender and savory and the roasted brussel sprouts were perfect for balancing out all of the different flavors in the dish. \\n\\nOverall, my boyfriend and I had a wonderful experience at Neptune and I wish we had room for one more entree... say.. the raved about lobster roll.

Had to wait for parking and in the process I saw a Subaru hit a Yukon Denali, the Subaru driver was bringing in drums for the band.\\n\\nAs soon as I got inside, I was greeted by the hostess and immediately sat down at our nice table.  I had sat down for not even 3 minutes and the waitress came and wrote down our order.  I swear she was stoned.  Placed our order for the portland dining month special and I got the ribeye along with the oysters Rockefeller as an appetizer.  Bread show up 5 mins after ordering.\\n\\nThe oysters arrived within 15 mins and I asked for Tabasco sauce, then the waitress shows up with franks hot sauce and sirracha.  I was like wtf?  What kind of steakhouse doesn't have Tabasco sauce?\\n\\nAnother 15 mins passed and our high as a kite waitress came by and gave us a story about how the computer rebooted in the middle of submitting our order and she had to confirm what we ordered 30 mins ago, wtf?\\n\\nAnother 15 mins passed and more bread showed up while we still had 3 pieces on the original plate, then 10 mins passed and the wife's seafood appetizer showed up which was really good, 2 oysters on the half shell, poke, shrimp salad thing and some cucumbers.  Pretty good.\\n\\nSo it wasn't until 8:30pm the main course showed up.  Steaks were just ok.  Nothing special.  Total bill was $73, I just left $77 because I didn't want to wait another 20 mins just for my card to get processed.  \\n\\nI don't think I will be back.

Nice city vibe with great views when you get to sit next to a window. Service was great & so was the food.

I recommend doing the valet just because it's easier and the cheaper option. After parking you have to walk to himitsu. You have to make a reservation, and if you show up early or without your entire party you have to wait outside, so be aware during cold winters. You need to know the passcode in order to get in as well. The venue is pretty small and there is only one restroom so there's always a long line for it. They do have Tom Ford soap once you are inside. \\nThis place is very very pricey. Their cheapest drink on the menu is $16. For parties of 6 or more, tip is automatically added to your bill. I tried the Raichi and Kyuri cocktail. They were pretty good but it's not enough alcohol for the price to the honest. It's a very upscale place. I also had a chance to try one of their rolls but I forgot what it was. I just know that it was decent and I would probably never get it again. \\nOverall if you like if you're into the whole high end fancy place this is the place for you. Other than that don't waste your money. It's very very dark and not well lit so you won't get any good pictures inside."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Update:   I got a response from a manager a couple days after my initial post.  I appreciate the manager trying to make contact after the bad yelp review.  They offered a voucher which I declined. Since that time I rechecked their menu on yelp and it still does offer minimal to no vegan option despite a claim that they do.  What made me revisit this ad was the fact I didn't choose this place to have dinner- my date did.  It was a series of dates we'd been on and I'm thinking she actually liked me.  She mentioned beforehand that some of her coworkers recommended Tasty and that she wanted to try it.   I can say that based on my interaction with her that she not only wanted to try the restaurant but thought that it could be a way to \\"win points\\" so to speak toward someone she might be interested in.  She,from our short interaction, didn't seem to be  much of an extrovert and it bothered me that a woman would bring a date here expecting to have a great experience to only be ignored and made a fool of in front of her date! I'll have you know that we haven't spoken since the evening of our outing at this restaurant.  I can say that most of it was a surprise in addition to the lack of communication considering personality types.  I've since moved on and have been dating other people.  I think she hadn't communicated after I expressed such disgust from the dining experience.  I likewise haven't followed back up after mentioning the disrespectful server experience.  I left the rating the way it was despite the managers attempt to reconcile. While this restaurant wasn't a good fit for us considering dietary restrictions and general overcrowding it may work well for other patrons.  Honestly, I would have liked to have more time to evaluate the restaurant before agreeing to visit it - didn't really have time to read the menu before going.  I thought I would post this after reading some of the yelp review comments from unhappy customers. If I had known about the restaurant serving style (oddly your party receives food at different times so you don't really eat together), pricing, general overcrowding, and limited vegan options I would have suggested going elsewhere."},{"name":"Joey D's Oak Room","address":"1015 Crown Pointe Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Nick Dew made lunch a pleasure.

This should have been our clue to not go! I called the restaurant who confirmed they had no record of it, and they re-booked us for the earlier slot I was hoping for. We showed up and - despite the restaurant only being half full - they sat the five of us at a table for 4 in the bar. We asked for a bigger table and they said nothing was available. However, a table for five immediately behind us stayed vacant the entire 2-3 hours we were there. \\n\\nWhy were we there almost 3 hours? Because everything was SLOW. We were out for a girls' night so this normally would not have been a problem, but it was slow with all the wrong things - namely, delivery of our food and drinks. Some meals arrived fine, others were lukewarm. The drinks we ordered to go with our meal arrived after we had finished eating. Troubling, considering we saw one of only two bartenders leaving at 9 PM (we didn't yet have our drinks) and while he was still behind the bar he removed his tie, put it in a drawer under the cash register (I assume so he wouldn't forget to be in dress code his next shift??) and untucked his shirt - so unprofessional. \\n\\nWhen I got home I had an email from Open Table telling me *the restaurant* had cancelled the reservation at 3PM on Friday afternoon.

It was a beautiful night and essentially we had the roof to ourselves.  \\n\\nThings took a nasty turn when the systems crashed and nobody could buy drinks with those tiny plastic cards that don't count as real money. But it is hard to really blame the establishment for this.  Gotta understand that things like this happen.  This definitely put a damper on the evening but overall it made for a nice pregame before the trek over to Royale.  \\n\\nAlso note that a lot of the bartenders and waitresses are pretty smokin' hott and actually nice to the people buying drinks.

Tiny boneless fried chicken piece for $6 each. A large cornbread was only 3 pieces which means one of us missed out. Brisket tasted good but a full pound was only a slice each.

Their donuts have been featured on the Food Network and Cooking Channel. A line out the door is a common sight. People love this place. In general, I think the donuts here are good, but there are hits and misses. What differentiates Revolution from other donut shops in metro Atlanta is Revolution's donuts are made fresh daily with organic, all-natural ingredients and no preservatives.\\n\\nSince Revolution doesn't use any preservatives, their donuts don't last long. I learned that lesson the hard way after biting into 1.5-day-old donuts I'd brought home the day before. The donuts had become hard, dry, and unappetizing. Borderline inedible. Note these were yeast-style donuts so I'm not sure if their other style donuts fare better. For maximum enjoyment, you'll want to consume these donuts as soon as possible.\\n\\nMy favorite donut at Revolution is the Buttermilk Bar. It's simple, but phenomenal. It's a glazed cake-style donut that sort of looks like a miniature loaf of bread. Like Revolution's other cake-style donuts, the Buttermilk Bar is hard and crunchy on the outside, but soft and somewhat moist on the inside. I think the Buttermilk Bar is kind of like eating a less dense, more airy pound cake.\\n\\nMost of the donuts cost $2-3 each. Some cost $3.50 or more. If you order a dozen, you get a discount. On any given day, they'll have about 20 varieties to choose from. Along with yeast and cake-style donuts, there's also \\"baked cake\\" donuts (pan-molded donuts that have been oven-baked) and filled yeast-style donuts. Like other \\"gourmet\\" donut shops around town, Revolution does get creative with its donut flavors and ingredients. Examples include their Peach Slider made with fresh peaches and a baked Carrot Cake donut.\\n\\nLots of folks rave about the Crunchy Mister, a savory, filled donut. It's a play on the French croque monsieur ham and cheese sandwich. \\"Crunchy Mister\\" is more or less the English translation of croque monsieur. The donut is filled with slices of ham, bechamel sauce (French white sauce), and Gruyere cheese. I'm not as crazy about this donut as others are, but I recommend it if you're looking for a meaty donut/sandwich hybrid.\\n\\nA couple donuts I'm not a fan of are the Bacon and Salted Caramel donut and the Orange and Pistachio donut. There's nothing wrong with these donuts. I just personally don't like these particular flavor combinations and textures on a donut. I'd prefer a \\"plain\\" salted caramel donut (with no chewy bacon bits) as opposed to one with bacon. I'm not big on orange icing and while I love pistachios, I'm not a proponent of nuts on donuts.\\n\\nUsually, I prefer simpler flavors like Revolution's Vanilla Bean donut. It's yummy. It's like a Krispy Kreme original glazed donut, also yeast-style, except a little bigger and more dense and filling.\\n\\nThe Maple Bourbon \\"Cro-Dough,\\" Revolution's take on the Cronut or croissant-donut, is delicious. It's not as soft nor as delicate as other melt-in-your-mouth Cronut knockoffs I've tried, but it's still worth ordering. The Cro-Dough is big and sweet with a pleasant chew.\\n\\nThe Apple Fritter is delectable. Its glaze is addictive. The donut is soft on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside. It tastes authentically homemade.\\n\\nI can't comment much on the coffee here as all I've had is the iced coffee. It's fine. Their iced coffee is made from a cold brew. You add cream and sugar yourself. They have a self-serve coffee fixing station with milk, half and half, almond milk, simple syrup, and other stuff. The milk they sell comes from grass-fed cattle. Many standard coffee drinks are available for purchase including mocha, latte, Americano, cappuccino, and plain espresso. They also have tea (peach iced tea, chai), chocolate milk, and OJ. Most beverages cost $2.50-4.50 each. There's a limited selection of ice cream too.\\n\\nService is terrific. The staff is friendly. Revolution uses Square for payment transactions so signed and itemized receipts can be automatically emailed to you.\\n\\nThe shop is small. Inside, there's seating for about 20 customers (four four-tops plus window seating). Outside on the sidewalk, there are a couple tables that can seat four each.\\n\\nThere are several free parking spots located directly outside the shop on either side of the street. If all those spots are taken, you can street park for free along nearby Cambridge or Feld Avenues.\\n\\nIn the end, I give Revolution Doughnuts 3 out of 5 Yelp stars: \\"A-OK.\\""},{"name":"Tasos Euro Cafe","address":"125 Access Rd","city":"Norwood","stars":"3.5","text":"I had really wanted to like this place but the food is quite disappointing each time I came here.

We were celebrating my mom's 73rd birthday.   There were 8 in our party.  This was the classic worst service ever.  One of the folks in our party ordered the bone in Ribeye, medium well.  It was served Rare maybe med Rare, but closer to Rare.  He politely notified the waitress who took it back to get the matter resolved.  Well, it came back still rare.  The manager picked up the price of the meal, but the damage was already done.  Another person in our party had the chicken parmesan.     The noodles came out cold.  She sent it back and requested spinach.   Another person ordered a Ceaser's Salad but was served a house garden salad, she notified the waitress who questioned whether she in fact ordered the correct salad.   She realized immediately after reviewing her ordered she did order the Ceaser's salad.  Our next person,  ordered beef ribs only to later be told that they were out of beef ribs.  The kicker of the night was when the waitress assumed that we were all on one check,  brought us the one check and we requested she split it, during our discussion on how we should split to save time, she stormed off without saying anything.   I had to go get the manager to inform him of my displeasure of her attitude.   I then returned to the table where I collected the credit cards for our bill.  We waited another 5-7 minutes for the waitress.   She finally showed and took our bill and cards.  She later came back with our cards, but stated one card was declined.  We knew that was incorrect,  so we again had to search her down.  After going to the hostess station, she made her way back to our table,  where we asked her to re-run  the card.   She began mumbling she had run it and it declined,  we reminded her there had to be a mistake.   She took the card and went to complain about the task to her co-Worker.   She later, came back with the card stating....it went through this time.  We all just looked at her, thinking no joke....we told you that.  I would like to think we were the only table experiencing bad service, but there were at least 4 other tables that had to get the manager involved.   Truly the worst service and attitude ever.

You can barely see any crab in there.  The crab cake in the crab cake Benedict dish used to be packed with real crab meat, and that's no longer the case.  \\n\\nI asked the waitress to check if the kitchen changed it's recipe, and she confirmed affirmatively.  It's truly a shame to see a successful restaurant cut corners on their signature dish (crab cake Benedict is the first dish on the brunch menu), and take away my (and probably many other customers') favorite brunch dish in order to cut cost. \\n\\nHope Murphy's reconsider their decision to downgrade the crab cake Benedict and bring the old recipe back."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"If you love someone, take them to Boston and make their first meal Neptune's.

Also splurged for the Uni Toast- at $4, it's not really a splurge but it is an acquired taste and one that luckily my mom was into. \\n\\nWe shared the legendary hot lobster roll with fries and it was so meaty and delicious.

As I was hanging around the downtown area, I decided to swing by here for some lunch. I managed to grab a spot at the counter without any wait and was handed a brunch menu. If you do happen to be a brunch lover, don't worry there are also traditional brunch offerings here like French toast or omelettes. \\n\\nI ended up just asking my waitress for a recommendation and was told to try the Bim Bop Bacon and Eggs. The recommendation was spot on. This is one of the best brunch dishes I've ever had. I was given a traditional hot bowl of bim bop with rice, kim chi, vegetables, bacon, and topped with a sunny side up egg. If brunch was like this everywhere, I might convert from my dinner loving ways. This was a creative new way to serve eggs and bacon that I much prefer over the typical eggs with a side of bacon. \\n\\nThe service was also great. I think it can be easy to overlook single diners when you've got tables with much bigger parties to attend to too, but my waitress made regular check ins.  \\n\\nPrice: Bim Bop Bacon and Eggs costs $12. Their brunch menu has a range from $9-$17 for the main courses. Portland has an amazing food scene but I wouldn't mind paying this place a second visit if I ever happened to be in the area again."},{"name":"Little Bird Bistro","address":"215 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I've been back twice since that original review and both times, Little Bird just hit it out of the park.

Gaudy Mexican themed d√©cor dominates the interior, but La Casita is certainly not the only Mexican restaurant to be guilty of this sin.  The place was clean both inside and outside, but a little on the small side.  Thankfully, the weather in Columbus has kept the less hardcore diners at home heating up their ramen noodles, but nothing short of the Apocalypse can keep us from getting our grub on.  \\nHigh marks:  Clean and well kept, not crowded\\nLow marks:   Small, gaudy decor\\n\\nService:  Grade B:  We love grabbing a bite at all the various little Mexican joints in Columbus.  But we have noticed a theme with most of them - good but never great service.  La Casita certainly continued that theme.  Our food and drinks came out el rapido (not even sure that's really Spanish for anything), but our server gave us the bare minimum service.  There is usually a small language barrier, and I feel a little bad then I have to point to the menu to order.  But as you can tell, my Espa√±ola is severely lacking (you should see me try to order Chinese food).   \\nHigh marks:  Fast\\nLow marks:   Bare minimum\\n\\nFood/Spirits:  Grade C-:  For most of dining experiences at Mexican eateries, the quality of the chips and salsa has been a good indicator of what the rest of the experience is going to be like.  This was also the case at La Casita.  The chips were stale, and the salsa was completely unremarkable.  As a paying diner, you should not feel that you could have gotten better chips and salsa from a bag of chips and a jar of salsa.  When the corner UDF can provide better chips and salsa than your restaurant, that is a grande red flag.  We ordered margaritas, of course (not ordering a margarita at a Mexican restaurant means you should never be allowed to eating anything Mexican except for Taco Bell).  We were pretty sure there was zero alcohol in our margaritas.  They tasted more like slushees served in fancy glassware.  Katina ordered enchiladas for her entr√©e and said they weren't bad, but also not good enough to be memorable.  I can't even remember what I ordered.  But I do know it had beef, and the beef was runny - like they dumped some left over chili into a tortilla and served it to me.  Whatever it was, it wasn't good.  My instinct was to hand La Casita a big fat \\"D\\" for food, but since Katina said her food was not \\"that bad,\\" I settled on the \\"C-.\\"\\nHigh marks:  Being described as \\"not that bad.\\"  \\nLow marks:   Everything else\\n\\nValue:  Grade B-:  If La Casita were to be located in my hometown of Gratis, Ohio, it would probably appear to be the best Mexican restaurant ever.  But since it is located in Columbus with a bunch of other Mexican restaurants, it comes across as way below average when compared to its competitors.  Portion size was okay and price was what you would expect for this type of restaurant, but the quality was lacking.  Our advice...drive on past La Casita...you'll can find better quality with minimal effort.\\nHigh marks:   Cheap\\nLow marks:   Cheap tasting\\nSee more reviews at www.grubgraders.com"},{"name":"Narcoossee's","address":"4401 Grand","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"First time here, was looking for a relaxing spot away from the kids for one night on our vacation.

Then two instances that led us to realize that these employees have no manners and have never heard of saying \\"excuse me\\" before....one female employee pushes a chair into my boyfriend's and bumps him to get their bus cart by; she looked at him for a second when he looked up in surprise, but nothing was said. As we were walking out, a male employee cuts in between us, separating us, and then pushes my boyfriend out of his way so he could deliver drinks to a table outside. It's not like we were walking slow. And I still had my coffee in my hand, so we were obviously paying customers.

Just an inconvenience to those who simply just want water. \\n\\nThey have a nice outdoor patio section when the weather is nice.  Otherwise, there are plenty of tables inside.   It has a great casual dining atmosphere.   Interior is \\"open-air\\".  So, it can get noisy if there are a lot of people.  Otherwise, it is a great place to dine and have a good conversation.  Parking competes a little with the burger joint next door.  I suggest parking in front instead of along the side of the building.    \\n\\nGet a Cosi card, if you visit frequent enough.  After 10 meals, you qualify for a free one.  Pricing is fairly reasonable.  Good value for what you get.\\n\\nThey change their menu up every now and then to keep things interesting.  I love their signature salad!   Flatbread pizza's are nice too.  I love the Margherita flatbread.  Flatbread sandwiches are good as well ... I just find sometimes they are \\"skimpy\\" with the ingredients (a.k.a I was hungry and should have ordered something more substantial).    \\n\\nOkay - - I admit it - - I am addicted to their flatbread.  Love the multi-grain version.  I try to make it sound healthy so that I don't feel as guilty.  And if you go there to eat with me and don't eat your flatbread, I'm usually asking you if you want your flatbread.  If I was really going to be healthy, I would ask for the small package of baby carrots that they offer instead.  \\n\\nYeah - I'm definitely a fan."},{"name":"Anmol","address":"258 Rantoul St","city":"Beverly","stars":"4.5","text":"Absolutely my favorite restaurant, love driving down (we live about an hour away but so worth it), ordering a couple Old Monk beers, playing Keno and then eating the most delicious Indian food I've ever had.

We also ordered a Mimosa Carafe for the table because it was financially responsible thing to do. Our food took about 15-20 minutes to come out and it was such an agonizing wait because everyone's food around us looked so good!! Unfortunately, when our food came out everything was cold/lukewarm. Two of my friends asked that their food get popped in the microwave. I was just so hungry that I ate the food without asking for it to get warmed up. My Texas Benedict was pretty average but the real star of the plate were those potatoes and the strawberries. \\nI really appreciated that the hostess/manager came to our table and apologized for our food and asked how she could make it up to us.

The coffee selection is simple, but carefully and thoughtfully selected. \\nI purchased three cookies (banana Nutella, PB&J, and chocolate chip) and a white sourdough to go. Each one of the cookies was perfect and offered something to suit individual tastes. The dough is moist, buttery, and not too sweet as to accommodate the sweeter fillings, which I can really appreciate. The banana Nutella is creative and the most popular since, well....it's stuffed with Nutella! While insanely delicious, I'm a sucker for a classic chocolate chip so that was actually my favorite. Let's just say that if you're a fan of chocolate the chocolate to dough ratio will not disappoint. I was skeptical of the PB&J because authentic PB can go so wrong in a cookie and often require a sickening level of sweetness, but ThoroughBread has managed to limit the sweetness to the fresh jam that you'll find sitting atop PB nestled within the center of the cookie. Perfect. \\nNow the sourdough. I've been on a quest to find AUTHENTIC sourdough and I'm glad to say I have finally found it. The texture, the air pockets, the chewiness, the natural sour taste, the crust, and the sheen were all spot on.

The food, however, wasn't anything special and wasn't worth the $8.99, or $11.00 with tax and tip, for sure.\\n\\n-Migas and chorizo were probably the best dishes.\\n-Unlimited corn tortillas = a plus.\\n-French toast was made out of what looked like half a hamburger bun or an English muffin. Bland and floppy.\\n-Potatoes were okay, nothing extraordinary.\\n-Bacon was bacon. Bacon is always great.\\n-There are some other items like black beans, ranchero sauce, tortilla chips. Still nothing too special or worth your $$.\\n-The fresh fruit and free mimosas/OJ redeem the food a bit. \\n\\nBottom line: Unless you want to get a heart attack and eat 3 plates of migas, I don't think this place is worth the visit for Sunday. Judging from the other reviews, the menu items are probably better, but today scared me off enough to not want to go back and try the menu."},{"name":"West End Grill","address":"63 Mazzeo Dr","city":"Randolph","stars":"4","text":"I didn't eat here (honestly, I didn't even open the food menu) but on a Sunday night when almost everything else in Randolph is closed, this is a solid option for a drink. \\n\\nHIGHLIGHTS \\nAmple parking \\nVery clean bathroom \\nFriendly service \\nLaid-back atmosphere \\nNon-rowdy crowd \\nConveniently located right off of Route 24"},{"name":"Food 101","address":"4969 Roswell Rd, Ste 200","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"My first experience here was really good.

The patty had a really meaty flavor and the cheese was thoroughly melted.  The tomatoes were slightly under-ripe, but oh well.\\n\\nThe chicken sandwich was really tasty, probably around a 7 or an 8 out of 10.  The batter was crispy and very well seasoned.  My wife saw the chef use a meat thermometer to make sure the middle was at just the right temperature.  The mustard and mayo really made the flavor pop; my only feedback would be that they were squirted right in the center of the sandwich and didn't make their way out to the edges very well.\\n\\nThe tots were tasty, but the real star of the show here was the fries, possibly the best I've had in Austin.  The texture was just perfect -- crispy on the outside, light on the inside.

I finally got the chance. Despite the reviews, some of them said that the food was good. I came in with a group and we got seated quickly; it wasn't that busy on a Wednesday night. We looked at the menu and ordered the Wednesday special sliders $11.50ish (from 5pm-10pm), 12 piece wings $13ish, and their morningside burger $14ish.\\n\\nThe table we were at looked clean, but it felt sticky. I don't know if it's the cleaning solution they used or someone just wiped it down with water. who knows. A lot of reviews said that they did not like the service hence some of the low ratings, but ours was as standard and we had no complaints about it. \\n\\nAnyways, it took a while for our food to come out, probably about 30 mins or more. The food came out finally: Sliders included one veggie burger, steak burger, and salmon burger. My bf asked for medium cooked for his morningside burger (includes sunnyside up egg and thick layer of blue cheese), but once he cut it in half, it looked rare/medium rare. He doesn't complain much so he just ate it anyway. Our friend ordered the wings with two flavors (the waitress told us he could have 2 flavors): regular Hot and Sriracha Honey something. If you're looking for spicy, these wings are not the ones, BUT we really liked the sriracha flavor and recommend that one. The morningside burger was okay, it also came with side of fries. Besides the burger not being cooked as what he ordered, the guys were not a fan of the thick layer or blue cheese; it was overwhelming and too much. Granted, the HobNob's burgers are pretty unique when you look at the choices on their menus. Fries seemed as though they were sitting out and then re-fried or we got the bottom of the bunch. Half of it were hard as a rock and most of them were short little nubs. The wednesday slider special (not explicitly on the menu) was okay also. Veggie burger had a butt-ton of lettuce that wasn't necessary; it was overflowing. The steak burger (I believe) was probably the only decent one out of all three; not much flavor and had an okay white sauce. The salmon burger wasn't dry, but wasn't flavorful. Overall, you could pass on the wednesday slider burger special. \\n\\nThe place is good for watching sports games, trivia nights and having a drink with half of the restaurant wall open to the outside on a pretty day. Other than that, I would not come back for the food. Especially for the price point, I'd rather go somewhere else. If you're in that area of Town Brookhaven, you can try it for their burgers but to save money, I'd rather drive somewhere else. Service is standard so I don't know what everyone else is talking about; maybe when it gets too busy?

According to the ADA, a business is not allowed to require any type of identification or certification documents for the dog.

I was actually planning to visit another place (we don't come to Portland as often as I'd like so when we do I eat A LOT!) after this but it filled me up so much that I didn't even care to try anything else. We sat at the bar - I love sitting at the bar, it's the best and you get seated right away even when there are 15 people waiting for tables like there were when we went - ordered some drinks, the Cuate and Elizabeth Taylor. I really liked the bubbly drink, I'm a fan of creme de violette and it was well-made and smooth; the bloody maria was also tasty although that is more the guy's thing since it was spicy with the chili-infused tequila. Not overly spicy, mind you, but it had a kick. We tried the meat board which was pretty good, all of the meat was fresh and flavorful and I really liked the country p√¢t√©. We also had the baked prunes with taleggio which I loved, even my boyfriend loved it and he's not that into sweet things - it is sweet but not overwhelming since the saltiness of the cheese evens it out. I tried the Tasty Hangtown Fry; the fried oysters were really good although the batter wasn't as flavorful as I prefer but the biscuit was delicious and the bacon lardons brought it all together with the fatty and salty aspects. My partner had the steak and cheddar eggs which he really liked and I loved the cornmeal pancake with the jalapeno butter, it had the fresh jalapeno flavor  not just spicy dull flavor. I have been to Tasty n Sons and I knew this place would be good so I can't say I'm really too surprised but now it is official: I like Tasty n Alder."},{"name":"Pho O Sha","address":"356 Arsenal St","city":"Watertown","stars":"4","text":"My usual pho place is in Allston.

The wings come with no breading on them and I believe they are cooked in the coal fired oven rather than fryer.  This made it lighter than a normal wing and had a distinct flavor. The meat pulled off the bone easily and made for a great appetizer. The short rib poutine was ridiculous. Period.  For lunch I had the biscuits and gravy and was not a fan. I should have known not to order a southern dish in New England! The gravy was ridiculously salty. Not edible. The biscuit wasn't bad but the dish was ruined by the sausage gravy.

We've widely recommended this place in the past because we like supporting small family businesses and the food is very good but the daughter of these hardworking people has made it impossible for us to continue our patronage. Having read a number of reviews that echo our sentiments I feel a little better. For years we thought she just hated us for some inexplicable reason but now I realize that she shares her disdain for many others as well. At least we're not the only customers that she treats shabbily but why would any normal rational business owner be so overtly rude and disrespectful to loyal customers who have been returning for years, often bringing friends and family along for the \\"experience?\\" It just doesn't make any sense. I'm not a behavioral health professional but I would say that she has a \\"problem.\\"  She is capable of being polite to some customers (\\"the regulars\\") while at the same time rolling her eyes or glaring at others like us. Someone suggested in their review that they are not pleased if you don't order alcohol or other beverages. We prefer to drink water so maybe that's one of the reasons that we're on the outs but we always order plenty of food and tip generously so it really is puzzling that she's so deliberately unpleasant toward us, especially when the now retired patriarch of the family was always so kind and gracious. I don't see his wife there much now but I remember that she was always very pleasant as well. I understand that she still makes a lot, if not all, of the baked goods. I can only deduce that their daughter is miserable and doesn't really want to run the family business.  If she keeps treating people this way, she'll effectively put Taso's out of business.

However, having lived in Greece for 15 years and also having tried Greek restaurants in various countries and at a lot of places in the US, I can tell you this is at best at par with ok places.\\n\\nI went to this place twice, to make sure I sample more of their dishes in order to be able to justify my rating. Had a left my review after just 1 visit, they were getting 1 star. At my first visit I got the gyro and the pastitsio. The pastitsio was ok. Like any ok Greek place. Nothing special. The gyro was not. First off I asked if it was the sliced meat from the spit or the frozen type meat, and they told me it is the sliced meat, not the frozen, they lied. Anyone who has ever tried a real gyro, knows the meat that is right and they use the frozen slabs. They also put lettuce in it and their tzatziki is basically the lazy way where the cucumber is barely strained so the tzatziki is very watery and the flavoring is so toned downed no self respecting Greek would call that tzatziki..its basically watered down yogurt. Not to mention that you cant eat it like a greek souvlaki that you eat wrapped cause it has so much lettuce and drips so much from their watery tzatziki. If you want a proper gyro, go elsewhere.\\n\\nSecond time I went I got the pork chops (Greek style) and the chicken gyro. I tried talking to them about the gyro and they insist they prepare their own meat and slice it, but that is not possible because it looks and tastes just like the frozen slabs of meat you can get at any \\"Greek\\" restaurant here. The woman tried to convince me that they dont use the spit cause its unsanitary...and I thought..so being Greek is unsanitary...noted. \\n\\nI tried asking that they replace the fake Greek salad with lettuce( that is the Greek Salad that most places serve for Americans) in the pork chop dinners with a proper Greek Salad and she said they couldnt do that..seriously..literally EVERY place I ask for that does that. So  I ended up getting 2 sides of lemon potatoes for it as I didnt like the other options. So I ordered a true Greek salad on the side which ended up being huge.like for 4 people and only had 2 small pieces of feta cheese..talk about stingy. \\n\\nSo after proper sampling of their food and checking there prices (really expensive in comparison with every other Greek place here in the U.S.) and the fact that they truly are rude (I noticed tons of reviews mentioning that after I went there), they get 2 stars and I am definitely not going there again."},{"name":"Le Coq Au Vin","address":"4800 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"What a cute place!

Before we ordered, we were told that they were out of chicken cordon blue, steak tartare, and one other dish. Because we had a travelzoo deal, we were told we could not order two additional dishes. Considering their menu isn't that extensive, we were down nearly 20% of the options. This was disappointing as the check in cordon blue is what I was planning on ordering. \\n\\nThey had a magical dining ish menu available where you could choose one of 3 appetizers, one of 3 entrees, and one of 2 desserts for $35. Ow as told we couldn't do this because of the travel zoo and I said to put mine on a separate check to not confuse anything. My mom and aunt could use their deal and I'd do the 3 course meal.  I got the French onion soup, salmon, and crepe Suzette. Around the table we also had beet salad, curry mussels, the scallop entree and the rack of lamb. \\n\\n*French onion soup - not very good. It tasted like cream of mustard with very few onions. \\n*salmon - it was panko crusted with a mustard sauce and it was absolutely delicious!  It was a large piece of fish and cooked perfectly. This was be overall winner of the night. The au gratin potatoes were pretty bad and went uneaten. \\n*crepe Suzette - what a sad dessert. It was 3 flavorless crepes with a little bit of syrup. Not worth the money or calories. \\n*beet salad - this was pretty good, although it was skimpy on the goat cheese portion\\n*curry mussels - weak. I'm not sure why there was a curry dish on a French menu, it seemed a bit out of place. The broth was like a very mild curry flavored water. The mussels themselves were large and delicious. The ones that were open, anyway. We had quite a bit of waste due to unopened shells. \\n*the scallop entree - this was tasty but the crab was a bit overpowering. I'm glad I got to try it, but I wouldn't order this dish. Again, the au gratin potatoes were pretty bad. \\n*rack of lamb - not bad, but definitely not worth $40. The meat was a bit tough/chewy but the flavors were good. Again, the au gratin potatoes were not good. \\n\\nIt took a while to get the check and then pay. The server was running in every direction without much help. I can't really fault him for that, but we were all itching to leave. \\n\\nI'm glad I checked this place out, it's an Orlando \\"institution.\\" Our meals were decent, but I personally don't think it's worth the price.

The lady on the phone was very friendly and gave us all the information that we needed. The dress code is simply business casual since they don't want any tanks, bathing suits, ripped clothing, disturbing or offensive language, etc.\\n\\n When we got there, we actually did self-parking since the cost of valet was pricey ($20.00) and we really didn't mind the walking. The walk to the restaurant was a little far, but it wasn't bad since the surrounding view was quite nice. When we arrived at the restaurant, we were seated right away at a table by the window. It had a very nice view of the water and we also got to see the Electrical Water Pageant (boat parade) while we were eating so that was definitely a plus. The restaurant itself was dark, nice and fancy. Our server and the staff there were very friendly probably because it is Disneyworld and they have to be nice to you.\\n\\n My boyfriend and I started with the Crispy Rhode Island Calamari, which was topped with some Pepperoncini, Mixed Olive Relish and Tomato Coulis. This appetizer was only decent for my taste. As for our entr√©e, we both ordered a Grilled Filet Mignon. The food came out in a timely fashion and the presentation of the dish was simple, but nice. My boyfriend ordered his steak medium while I ordered mine medium rare. We both agreed that the medium rare was a lot better. The dish also came with mashed potatoes and French beans. It was such a delicious dish even though the steak itself was only okay since it was not as tender; however; the flavor (the Cabernet Wine Sauce) was absolutely amazing. When we were done with that, we ordered their Coconut and Chocolate Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e. It was actually pretty good and this  is coming from someone who does not really like to eat cake or dessert other than ice cream. Our server also brought us a complimentary Almond-crusted Cheesecake because we mentioned how we were out celebrating. It even had a white chocolate sign that greeted us \\"Happy Anniversary from Narcoosee's\\" I thought this was such a sweet gesture that they take to make their guest happy. They do this for birthdays as well. However, I did not like this dessert very much since it was a little too sweet for me.Overall, the price for the appetizer, entr√©e and dessert was a bit pricey but also reasonable.  Calamari ($14), Filet Mignon ($44) per entr√©e, Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e ($10).\\n\\nAfter our meal, we just walked out to the patio of the restaurant and watched the Fireworks. If you're still eating, you can just let your server know that you want to step out to watch it. For those sitting at by the windows, you might still have to step outside because there will be people standing in front of you watching anyways!\\n\\nJust another note, If you want a nice and romantic dinner, you should definitely make reservations around 8:30 P.M or so, so that you can watch the parade and fireworks!"},{"name":"Cielo Bistro Mexico","address":"7032 Wood Hollow Dr, Ste 101","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I really wanted to like this place, as it is in my neighborhood. Ever since El Arroyo left, I've missed chips and salsa close by.\\n\\nFirst, the good. I asked for a mocktail, and the bartender came to talk to me and ended up bringing me a really fruity, fizzy drink, which is exactly what I wanted, with pureed strawberries, ginger beer, and some lime. He checked back after a few minutes to see how I was enjoying it. That was the best part of the meal. \\n\\nMy server was pretty self-absorbed, and it never felt like she was listening to me. When I asked how she was, she went on an enthusiastic tangent about her days off and a shopping trip she was planning, which is fine, but it didn't seem like she was listening to me as I placed my order. She had to check back with me to confirm my order. Maybe she was just nervous. \\n\\nThe host had very little to do, so he spent his time leaning against the wall, drinking a beverage, and checking and coiffing his hair in front of the mirror.\\n\\nNow, the food. The chips had good texture, but the salsa was pretty mediocre, with not a whole lot of flavor or heat. The guacamole was served on top of copious red chili sauce and a bed of shredded cabbage. It was impossible to eat the guacamole without enjoying large amounts of cabbage or red chili sauce with it. The calamari was bland, the sauce neither remarkable or spicy, and the dish was not served with any lemon or lime, which would have improved it. I ordered what appears to be the only vegetarian entree, a stuffed half of a zucchini squash. For a zucchini boat filled mainly with corn, the price was a bit pretentious. $16 for a zucchini that was about 1 inch wide by about six inches long? Although there was lot of sauce and cheese, nicely browned, and piping hot, it seemed like a rip-off. Black beans and rice came on a separate plate and were barely warm, so I sent them back. The next plate of beans and rice were no warmer. \\n\\nWhen Joel, the owner, came over to see how I was doing, I told him about the cold beans and rice, and he started talking about how they're going to make a change to bigger plates and put the whole entree on one plate, like people expect from Tex-Mex. He passionately told me how this is not Tex-Mex, and Mexico City style Mexican food is served differently, with all of the foods on different plates. (I don't understand what that has to do with the temperature of the rice and beans, though.) When I mentioned that my server was pretty self-absorbed and not really paying attention to me and that when I had asked her how she was--, he interrupted me and said, \\"But you didn't really care how she was doing, did you?\\" No, I genuinely like to connect with my server. \\n\\nHe had his arms folded across his chest by this time and was taking quite a defensive stance. He made sure that I knew that they are not Tex-Mex, they are not El Arroyo, and that they are adjusting their prices, their plating, and their hours to give people in the neighborhood what they want, and that I should really give them another chance. \\n\\nGenerally, if I have to speak to a manager or an owner, they offer some sort of resolution or context for the problem. This did not happen. \\n\\nBy the time I was done with my conversation with the owner, and finished my meal, there was no compelling reason for me to return.

The steak gods were pushing us to venture out of the comfort zone we've set up camp in. We've driven past it over the years and I went based on the trust of my fellow Yelpers. \\n\\nIt is true when you go in here, it is like the haunted mansion ride meets the Godfather. It is pretty cool. We sat in a large velvet booth and we joked that we waited for the mirror on the other side of the room to show a ghost from the ride sitting between us. If it had been between us, it surely would have been a happy ghost because the food was really good.\\n\\nWe were the first one's in on a Saturday night. They don't open until 5pm, which by now, we are starving. The waitress was nice enough and she did check on us, but then again, she had to walk by us to get to the drinks. The atmosphere, as everyone says, is kind of dark and it sets the tone for a good date night.  We ordered hot wings to start, and they weren't overly spicy and came out really quick. Maybe they had already been cooked because normally, when you order wings, they come out and you wait for them to cool, these were not that way. It wasn't a bad thing, but it did stand out that they were a smidge above room temperature. \\n\\nOther people were coming in, and it is not that big of a place, so that adds to the cozy feeling with the fireplace going. The salad and soup came out almost right behind the wings and my husband had the prime rib noodle soup. He said it was really good, it reminded him of prime rib in au jus.  Then our rib eyes came out. They were cooked to order and were really tender. I had no complaints about the food, but for some reason, it just can't really make it past the three. It is not worth the price, perhaps?  The 12 oz rib eye was $28, plus add another $4 for salad or soup. \\n\\nWe were going back and forth about ordering the prime rib, but I wanted that charbroiled steak flavor, it wasn't really charbroiled flavored, that might be what it was that made me not tip it up to 4 stars. You won't be disappointed if you go, it is really a fun place to eat, because you don't see this kind of setting. It opens up a lot of conversations about where you might think a ghost is coming from, or if the mafia knows they have a set built for them. Then, as if we weren't already stuffed, we amped it up and ordered dessert. I got the pudding cake, which by description is a cake involving pudding, my experience was more like a regular chocolate cake. Good, but just average. My husband ordered the hot and gooey, which came in a decent sized bowl that we both could have shared. \\n\\nA lot of people were ordering the prime rib and they do, in fact, have the hipster waiter roll it over to you and slice it right at the table. The table next to us got theirs and it almost sounded like a porn movie afterward. It was a table of 50 somethings, add alcohol, good prime rib and the sound track to a porno is made. It almost made me sad I didn't order the prime rib.\\n\\nWe finished eating and walked over to the bar area, where they have the bands on the weekend. Its primary color scheme is bright red and it just seems like a run of the mill bar, sort of run down. \\n\\nI thought it was funny too, at how many people we heard asking the waitress, 'so what is the story with this place'. I mean everybody, but us, we were laying low and just enjoying it. I think it showed that we weren't the only 'new' people there. If you want to know what the answers were, no matter what the waitresses were asked, they either said they didn't know or, \\"it is has just always been that way\\". Nothing that would satisfy curious customers.

Instead of a New England-style roll, ciabatta rolls are used and are lightly grilled.  The rolls come to you overflowing with lobster.  Whether you get your lobster buttered or with mayo, it is dressed lightly.  As a result, the lobster flavor shines instead of getting drowned out with too much dressing.
