Just perfectly mixed, complex drinks and, of course, just the right ice.The menu of drinks is overwhelming at first. Then you see how it's organized by liquor and type of ice, making it  easy to figure out which drinks you want, the hard part is deciding which to drink first.The Floradora is a cold burst of ginger awesome.

I have also sampled their calzones - delicious!! The desserts are also wonderful and made by the chef daily. The cheesecake is awesome!! The portions are VERY generous and we always leave with doggie bags that I can make 1-2 lunches out of. I once ordered bruschetta with my boyfriend as an appetizer and we got the equivalent of a large pizza sized order!! Needless to say, we had leftover's!! Gennaro's has been remodeled in the last year or so and they now have a larger waiting area and offer samples of their pizza and appetizers while you wait. The dining room is like being in someones house, in that it is smaller and the tables are close together. I think of it as \\"family style eating.\\" There is often a wait for a table at Gennaro's, so the remodeling and expanded waiting area was a good move. The wait usually goes by quickly, especially if you have a beer or a glass of wine as you wait for your table. The prices are very reasonable you never leave without leftover's.

The owners are very nice people, and try to cater to what they think your tastes may be. The side dishes are alright, with the marinated potatoes being the favorite. The kimchi and the pickled daikon were too salty. We ended up ordering the galbi tang and the beef bulgogi. The bulgogi was too oily - the beef sat in puddles of oil, but the marinade was flavorful. The galbitang was good but again too salty. I had to down quite a bit of water in order to keep the food palatable. If the salt had been toned down a bit, the galbitang would have been a hit. Also, the small plate of bulgogi is unreasonably priced. I could get filet mignon for that price and that weight of beef. A more reasonable price would be around $8. In general, the food here is over-salted to attempt to suit what they believe americanized tastes may be, over-priced, and not authentic per what I ordered.

Upon arriving we checked in and were advised it would be 45 minutes.  About 60 minutes later we still had not heard from them so checked on the status and were told if we wouldn't mind sitting outside we would could be seated in 10 minutes which we agreed to.  About 20 minutes later we still had not been called in and a hostess came outside to tell everyone waiting that if we wanted sushi it would be at least an hour once we were seated.  Considering this is a sushi restaurant we were a bit shocked but still stayed in line since we were this far into the wait.  I went in and asked if we were close to being seated and were told any minute.  (Mind you going on 85 minutes on what was told to be a 45 min wait).  Finally we were seated and when we ordered sushi we're told that they wouldn't even be able to do that since the restaurant closes at 9 and we were seated around 8:20.  Now, I understand the desire to leave as close to closing time if you work there but this was ridiculous.  I have never been to a sushi restaurant that refused to provide their main product because the kitchen was backed up and they didn't want the staff to stay. (My mind is still trying to wrap itself around this management mind set)I have to give a kudos to the wait staff because they were put in a bad situation (multiple parties around the restaurant were clearly upset).  The management of this location clearly needs some help in understanding customer service and setting clear expectations.  My entire group (only 4 of us) was excited to try this place and everyone is now telling others to stay away!  My advice would be if you are more than a 10 minute drive STAY CLEAR of this place.

I'm so glad there is a nice place in Union Square that serves til 11:30 on Saturday.  My group arrived at 10:30 and we chose to sit downstairs.  Though small, there were several open tables on both the main floor and the downstairs (which seemed a bit more lively).Overall I was very pleased with the whole experience and, again, very glad to have a place like this in Union.  So any negatives below are just really some fine-tuning points from a picky asshole.I'll echo that the space is really cute and I love all the fixtures.  The loveseats at the bar looked really cozy.  BUT, the bucket seats at the table were very deep and the tables themselves very tall, so I felt like I was a 5 year old in need of a booster seat.  Maybe a butt pillow in each seat to raise the diners up a bit?  Or maybe I just need to grow a couple inches.The menu and cocktail selection were both diverse, especially considering the monthly specials.  Our group ordered a classic martini, 2 mojitos, and a cuba libre.  Most were great, BUT the cuba libre had way too much lime juice and was nearly undrinkable.The waitress was very nice, attentive, and informative, explaining that some dishes had 2 bites, some 3 bites, some 4 bites and, since we were a group of 4, she let us know in advance which plates we were ordering had which amount so we wouldn't be surprised.  She also explained that the dishes were meant to be finger food, so the cute tiny silverware was really meant mostly for show and not to be functional, which proved true.  I love plantain chips, so I was very happy to get a complimentary basket with asparagus dip at the beginning of the meal. We ordered the banana steamed fish, the boar pot roast, the grilled chorizo, and two orders of the sesame crusted tuna.  All the dishes were quite good, obviously the tuna was great considering we got a double of it.  BUT, how do you eat steamed fish and pot roast with your fingers?  Answer: messily.  Also, the pot roast was a little over salted.  And I'm going to echo the fact that the prices are on the high side - I'm not saying ungodly expensive, I'm just saying for Union Square you can get a much cheaper and much less elegant meal elsewhere.But again, overall I really enjoyed my meal at Casa B and I'm sure I'll be back many many times."},{"name":"Bistro Marquee","address":"200 SW Market St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"We attempted to order the burger rare this time in hopes that it'll be served medium rare since our first two attempts ordering medium rare, came out medium.... but once again, our rare came out medium.

I had the trio fajitas (beef, chicken, shrimp) and all were very tasty. Usually in a combo like that, I like one or two but not all three. All were fantastic. My wife loved her chicken fajita tacos, which were two big to finish so she also got the next day's lunch out of the deal. :) Old Santa Fe has become my new favorite Mexican restaurant, and we'll be sure to ask for Saul next time we're back as he was excellent.

The Castro was also enjoyed and was cooked perfectly.I love that they include a side with the the paninis and wraps: mixed greens, 3 bean salad, or tortellini salad.  The dressing on the salad was really yummy and didn't taste like the generic balsamic you get with most mixed green salads at other places.Definitely go back to try the amazing looking quiches they had on display, which I think also come with a side as that's what it seemed as I saw others coming out of the kitchen.Also a plus: free wifi, just have to ask the employee at the register."},{"name":"Zaza's Cuban Cafe","address":"1 Jeff Fuqua Blvd, Airside 1, Gates 10-19","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Had to finally try a cortadito while waiting for my flight back home, and i am glad I did.

Today they finally got the beans but left off the cheese on one of the tacos. It is just mind boggling how they can't get it right! We've sat in the restaurant a number of times as well and Their service is also pretty bad from phone orders, to the host to the waiter. Unknowledgeable and slow. One big piece of advice I can give to the waiters (having been one myself for 6 years) is to multitask. They run back and forth for only one table at a time rather than stopping by all tables in one trip.

I loved the thick chewy noodles and the coconut flavor.Sii Khrong Muu Yaang: My boss liked this baby back rib dish. It is NOT fall-off-the-bone, like in the south. It is chewier, but still tender. We ordered the Sai Ua Samun Phrai, which was a Chiang Mai sausage dish, but the server kind of messed up and we never got it. Kind of a bummer, but we were stuffed anyways.We ordered jasmine rice and coconut rice to eat with our dishes.

I haven't really been in this particular location for the food but just for the coffee ( coffee addict over here, it runs through my veins haha ) and also the pastries. I love the fact that this is one Panera I've seen with a drive thru which is a big perk to have since the inside is a bit smaller then the typical locations I've been to. Some of the staff are nice but others seem annoyed to work there when asked a question, it's a hit or miss with customer service. I came here to do some homework so I ordered a blueberry scone that was a free pastry for my birthday that just passed and a cappuccino since I LOVE coffee. I saw a coffee cup was put on the counter but I just didn't hear the girl and when I tried to confirm she didn't even bother in looking at me just kind of said \\"yea, cappuccino\\" but you can expect this in other places as well other than that everything is good.

The restaurant is beautiful, mostly only men work there in the front of house. The execution/cookery of the food was on point but the flavor profiles were lacking. The steaks were cooked perfectly, and I mean perfectly. My date did get the 3yr aged steak; it is a hefty price but worth it and is a large portion. I had the lamb chops. Very good taste but the cous cous underneath left more to be desired. The veal venison appetizer was prepared wonderfully but the aioli was more like a bland sour cream not a garlic mayonnaise based sauce. I felt it actually took away from the dish it was so bland. The baked Alaska dessert was nice and I was happy to enjoy since it's harder to find that dessert these days. The meringue was perfect. \\n      The service was the other downfall.

For those of you who don't quite know what a kolache is (I was asked this question the other day), it's a sweet roll type of thing stuffed with a variety of different options.  I've had the breakfast kolache from here, stuffed with sausage, egg, and cheese.  It is pretty yummy, don't make the mistake of ordering more than one, thinking that they're too small for your appetite.  We also frequently get sausage with cheese, sausage with jalapeno and cheese, and fruit varieties.  The store is very clean and donut shop-like.  You walk in and there's a wall sized selection to choose from.  You can see the full variety on their website.  The employees I've encountered have been too friendly for as early in the morning as I've gone.  The hours work for my needs, but probably not for many others.  They open at 6am (people are there a little earlier, though, I think) and close at 2pm.This store is in an interesting location, crammed between Brake Check and a parking garage.

The vibe when we first walked in was really good. We were very impressed. The place had a nice feel to it. The hostess asked us how many in our party, I responded 2. She looked down at her desk and then her and the other woman (maybe another hostess?) walked away. When they came back I was still standing there. Then they just went about their day. Calling up a few parties to seat them. Still standing there with kind of a \\"wtf\\" look on my face. I walked away, standing against the wall right next to the hostess area. A good 5 minutes passes, and she says \\"are you waiting for a table?\\" No. I'm standing here for fun. Yes, I'm waiting for a table. You walked away! So she takes my name down, says it'll be about 10 minutes. Ok, no big deal. I can get over that. I've worked in the restaurant industry for years. I get it. It can be busy. So we get seated, a waitress comes over. Place our drink orders, get some bread, and order our food. Nothing super crazy - steak tips, onion straws and mashed potatoes and a grilled chicken Caesar salad. The salad was awful. The chicken was cooked perfectly... if the kitchen had remembered to season it. But they did not. The lettuce and croutons were whatever. The salad dressing had almost no taste to it whatsoever. Steak tips were cooked perfectly (medium rare) but again... no seasoning. How do you cook a steak with no seasoning? There were random pieces of fried seafood in the onion straws. Luckily neither of us were allergic. The mashed potatoes had no flavor. Ordered an Oreo brownie sundae for dessert. The brownie had no flavor and the ice cream was freezer burned. How could 2 entrees and a dessert have no flavor? I'm baffled. Still left a 20% tip though because it wasn't the waitresses fault. She was awesome. But for $80, I don't want to have to season my own food. I would have just stayed home."},{"name":"Vivo Austin","address":"6406 N I 35, Ste 2343","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Run of the mill Tex-Mex place at best. The inside is drab and unpleasant, and the food had issues. Our food took a long time to come out, despite the fact that the restaurant was empty on a Saturday afternoon. I ordered a cheese enchilada with a puffy bean taco and prickly pear margarita. Unfortunately, the cheese had not actually been melted in the enchilada. When I sent it back... the cheese in the replacement enchilada was even more undercooked. The third enchilada was finally cooked correctly, after we brought the issue to the attention of the manager. My wife's  chicken enchilada was extremely dry and tough. It was basically inedible if not slathered with cream sauce. After 6 months in business, I would have expected these issues to have been ironed out. I enjoyed the margarita, but it was small for the price. I can say that our server was excellent and dealt with the problems gracefully.Now for the comparison with the old Vivo:Eighty percent of the appeal of Vivo was its location: the amazing patio and plants, the hip bar, and sexy, intimate interior. The other twenty percent, for me, was its margarita (noticeably smaller at the new place).\\n \\nThe interior of Vivo Austin is a big box with few partitions, and no patio; your typical cheap strip mall joint. The table of candles is positioned directly in front of the doorway as if to announce \\"See? This is the SAME Vivo.\\" But the candles are all burned low now.Which is worse, a beloved restaurant that suddenly goes under, never to be seen again, or a resurfaced zombie which taints memories of the original?Despite the huge downgrade in location and food quality, prices have not budged.

Put a couple of pickle slices and onions; drizzle it with Rudy's BBQ \\"sause\\" and you have yourself a delicious BBQ sandwich! Usually 1/4 lb is enough for me when I make these sandwiches. If you want to eat the brisket straight up, you might want to get 1/2 lb. The St. Louis ribs and sausages are also great! Along with lots of meat, you should check out their sides. They have cream corn, potato salad, and cold slaw. There are also little pints of dessert: banana pudding with nila wafers or chocolate pudding with oreos? or maybe it's just whipped cream..I cant remember.The people who work there are awesome. They put the brisket, ribs, whatever meat you get on the scale and they ask you \\"is this okay?\\", which basically means \\"if you want more, just ask for it\\". If the scale says .45 and you asked for 1/2 lb, you can always ask for a little more.There are long picnic tables to accommodate large parties; and what also is great is that you pay upfront. No need to worry about splitting the check and calculating what to put on everyone's credit card. The downside is that it can get crowded and you might not get a table.

Our party of six was really pleased with our evening and meal at Commonwealth. I was in Boston for business and looking for a good spot for a work dinner. My brother is in school there and suggested the Kendall Square area and this was one of the top suggestions. I liked that they took reservations and online at that. It looks very unassuming when you first walk in as you enter the grocery section. The hostess took us to our table and the restaurant is bright and welcoming. We had a nice large square table (with seats for eight as we originally thought we would have seven for dinner), which worked out well as we had extra table space for all the plates that we were sharing. We did a lot of sampling for the appetizers and cheese/meat boards. Things that I remember trying - although hard to say if there were others since the menu changes frequently for seasonal items - Kale Salad, Avocado Toast (with Goats' Milk Feta, Radish, Sweet 100 Tomatoes), Grilled Flatbread (topped with Housemade Sausage, Kale, Ricotta) and Lamb Sausage (with Haloumi, Asparagus, Tabbouleh, Sweet Pea Hummus). We also had a salami brought to the table. For my main course, I had the Spinach & Ricotta Cavatelli - very fresh - was a little heavier on the peas than I expected, but it was still good. We also shared sides - Grilled Broccolini (delicious!) and Duck Fat Fries (amazing!). For dessert, I had the Cinnamon Honey ice cream and it was really good. Lots of ice cream flavors to choose from. The wine list was fine - we weren't as impressed with our wine as we were with the food. I did start with a cocktail - the special sangria, which was good. Our waitress was great - really helpful with our questions and ensuring that we had fresh plates and serving utensils for all the sharing we were doing at the table. I would certainly return here and likely be a frequent diner if I lived in Boston. Be sure to make reservations - it is a small seating area and it's the type of place where you will spend time at the table due to the ability to have bits and bites versus just sitting down for one course. Thank you, Commonwealth, for a fun and foodie evening! I believe they also do parking validation for a discounted rate, which the locals we were meeting for dinner were happy about."},{"name":"Counter Culture","address":"2337 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"For the last four years, we have made a point to visit Counter Culture when visiting Austin from Houston, where we lack in good 100% vegan restaurants. This past wknd, we decided to introduce my parents to this favorite spot. The service was terrible, beginning with a rude and incompetent hostess and a detached server.  On top of that, I can't bring myself to overlook the general dirtiness of the restaurant anymore. Perhaps Counter Culture has gotten too big for its britches.

Had the Hot Apple Pie and the Peanut Butter Chocolate Cheesecake - again both excellent.  Additionally, all of us thought the Peanut Butter Chocolate Cheesecake was the best any of us had ever tasted.  Subtle but strong peanut butter flavor in a very creamy presentation with the chocolate-trying to figure out how we get one of these on the plane home.  We sat in the patio bar and the staff was very friendly and nice."},{"name":"Baraka Cafe","address":"812 Memorial Dr","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Baraka Cafe is a really small hole in the wall, decorated well, and with fairly loud music for a restaurant. Expect a wait, we went on a friday night and needed to wait almost 20 minutes to get seated. And that's not where the waiting stops either. Long waits to order, and long waits for food. Extremely long waits. Expect up to a 2 hour dinner.The food was very good, though. We started with the soup of the day, which was a spicy tomato soup. One cup was $1.95 I think. One of the best things about the soup was the warm piece of bread that came with the cup. My entree was the various grilled meats over french fries. All the meat was very tender, the sausage was delicious, and the fries were great as well. The dish cost around $12. My friend got the pork chops ($18), and those were very tender and juicy. Every dish has just the perfect slight amount of spiciness. Not enough to make your mouth hurt or make you sweat (and I am definitely a sweater) but enough to make the food have that little extra kick. The portions aren't that big, slightly on the small side for restaurant food."},{"name":"Keke's Breakfast Cafe","address":"4430 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This sucked.

It didn't appear to be too busy but nobody ever came over to our table to greet us or give us water or even a menu. We waited a good 20 minutes with no acknowledgement whatsoever and we finally got up and walked out. On our way out of the restaurant a manager asked us how our dining experience was and we said we were never even brought a menu so we didn't get to eat. He did not apologized or try to remedy the situation. When I got home I emailed the restaurant and never got any response from anyone. Today my husband and I were in the area so we decided to give it another chance. This time they were pretty busy but we went in anyway. We were seated and given chips and a menu but no water. After about ten minutes I asked an employee that passed by our table for water which he promptly brought to us. Then our waiter came over and quickly said \\"are you ready to order?\\" We said yes and we told him our order to which he was not engaged at all. He repeated our order back very quickly and rushed and we confirmed that it was correct and he immediately turned and walked away. He didn't elaborate or pause for even a second for us to ask any questions. When he brought our food he sat it down and quickly walked away. We realized almost immediately that we were given the completely wrong orders but at this point we were so disgusted with this restaurant that we just ate what was brought to us and we agreed to never return to this restaurant. I was going to tell the waiter that we were not given the things that we had actually ordered but he never once came back to check on us or see how our food was so we never even got the chance to tell him that we were served the wrong things.

Okay so I was going to give it a 4 because of its \\"environment\\" as people seem to care about that but as far as I'm concerned the atmosphere is fine. It is more like a little walk in sushi deli than a restaurant but its not like they hide that. It can come across a little dingy especially because of the area but its not gross by any means and is well kept up. If your looking for a fancy feel go somewhere else. The staff is always really accommodating and nice however can get pretty busy as the place is pretty small and not many people work there. You don't have to wait long for them though.NOW to the good stuff.. The food here is really good. Probably not the best sushi in the city but Ive never had a bad experience.. only delicious ones. The menu is broad and pretty decently priced however where you get the deals is if you get any of the many many specials plastered all over the walls. Last time I went I got the udon special that comes with a veggie udon your choice of roll and appetizer. My friend got a spicy BBQ salmon roll (which he LOVED) and an appetizer of some sort and a drink and we walked away having spent a total of $12 all together.They're generic sushi special (22 pieces of sushi and a miso for 5.99??) is awesome because its not the same yam, california  and salmon. They throw in a Spicy crunch roll which is delicious. They also have a build your own lunch and dinner special that has a large variety of choices.Ive yet to try all the different awesome specials on the walls let alone really get anything straight off the menu, which is fine with me bc if you were to do that you'd probably spend just as much as any other sushi place.I can not say enough good things about this place... matter a fact I think I'm having sushi for dinner now ;)"},{"name":"New Brothers Restaurant & Deli","address":"31 Maple St","city":"Danvers","stars":"4","text":"Want a place you can stop in any time and eat good?

However, we waited a while for our pasta to arrive.  Many customers that had ordered food after we had were given their orders first.  It's an interesting non-touristy Italian seafood experience.  Most of their dishes are \\"missing something\\" and a lot of customers were asking to modify or add to their orders.  For example, we had the squid ink pasta with alfredo - it could have used some shrimp or scallops or calamari on top of it.  The squid ink pasta with calamari was pretty plain and needed some more flavor and sauce, such as cheese.  Advice: I would totally just mix the alfredo pasta with the calamari pasta.

It absolutely ruins the ambience, and because the patio seating is so close to the front door, you can't even enter the establishment without getting a lungful of smoke if someone is out there smoking.\\n2) There aren't many outlets around the shop.

But it started with the host stand, then the non-existent waitress, and then the new waitress and then the manager. Just like going to any rather new restaurant at peak dinner.. you should expect a wait.  Which there was and we were patient.  Our table of three was sat in their BEAUTIFUL OUTDOOR PATIO by the FIRE... but after about 5 minutes of ohhhhing and ahhhhhing... you are going to want to order your drink or at the very least be greeted by your waitress.  NO ONE CAME TO US FOR 20 MINUTES. The waitress who greeted her 2 tables that were seated after us...we pulled her in and asked if she knew who our waitress was.  She assured us she'd check with the host stand.. and came back a few minutes later... took out her pad and pen... and said \\"I guess I'll be your waiter since there was some confusion with the front desk.  There was no waitress in this section.\\"  Ummm....wtduece?!? It was 830 at this point on a Thursday night.  We sat at 8pm. How was the restaurant sections not properly divyed to waiters/ waitresses?  I worked in the restaurant business for years.. I know how it goes.  There was something wrong but whatever.  I was happy the waitress we pulled in had instantly owned the situation and took us in addition to her full section. No more about the host stand/service... on to the food.The Greek salmon was good although I substituted the salad for mashed. I'm glad I did it was delish! My brother ordered the Cure burger with fries (asked for fries to be \\"well-done!) Yum. Best item on the table! And the sad ribeye steak my son ordered was cooked to temp (med-rare) but.. no flavor. I was a little disappointed that the $30+ steak was less flavorful than the ~$15 burger. Unsure if my prices are exact because I admit I forgot the prices...I just was too distracted by the $5.00 charge for each scoop of birthday scoop of ice  cream for the two birthday boys I was out celebrating.  If I was told a head of time that this was a restaurant that charges for the \\"birthday scoop\\".... I would have ordered a more expensive dessert rather than a scoop of plain vanilla. The waitress had an opportunity to upsell but.... nope. Instead she got a customer that gave her some constructive criticism and asked her to immediately reconcile the situation.

We started with the wings and they were FANTASTIC! An amazing array of complex flavors bursting like fireworks in our mouths. We ordered them spicy and they were the perfect degree and balance between extremely flavorful and not overpoweringly hot. The next three dishes we chose were Kung Op Wun Sen, Yam Makheua Yao (smoky charcoal grilled long eggplant salad), and Khao Soi (chicken, mild curry noodle soup).

The decor for the outdoor seating really made you feel like you were in Thailand. From the tin roof, the plastic like tablecloths, the plants... and the flies that were everywhere. We were given a choice for indoor or outdoor seating and picked outdoor. Retrospectively because of the flies, I'd pick inside next time. The waiter did an excellent job of describing the dishes, not just \\"it's good\\" or \\"this is spicy\\", but he really knew the menu and the dishes. I decided to do something different from the 'most popular' dishes and got the catfish dish, which apparently is a staff favorite. My friend got the pork belly dish. They gave us some slight spicy peanuts as an appetizer and brought the food out pretty fast.The pork belly came in a clay pot with a stew like sauce and a side of rice. If you like the fatty pieces, this dish is for you. There was a lot of good flavor and the rice was good to mop up the sauce and cut the richness. Slightly spicy.The catfish came out with a calamansi or lime and a pineapple sauce, which I squeezed and poured over the dish. I also was informed to stir the noodles up because there was some kind of oil on the bottom that needed to be integrated. I really enjoyed it, but there may have been a little too much dill, cilantro, and mint. I know not everyone cares for one or all three of those herbs, so dont get this if that's on your \\"no go\\" list. The catfish was nice and warm and perfectly crispy on the outside.

I know this is a popular practice for many bookstores, but with the amount of leadership books available at Powell's there is really no reason for leadership to not have it's own section (beyond the actual reason that the practice and behaviors of leadership and management are very different).  Powell's has some of the most seminal works on leadership (James MacGregor Burns's Leadership) but is missing some (Joseph Rost's Leadership in the 21st Century).  You can find older editions of some popular books, such as The Leadership Challenge by Kouzes and Posner.

Who knew sausage tasted better with lemongrass??  After that, I now make regular runs to Fubonn to pick up lao sausages.  Yum.I had something in a hot pot.  Amazing.  I've had about half the menu-all great.  No disappointments.The great thing about this place-you could see that other people there were having the same experience with their orders.  I picked up the Pok Pok cookbook and quickly learned that this food is far from easy to make.  Think pestle and mortar and about 10 hours of simmering.  Yeah, I'll just get it from Pok Pok.Word to the wise: the portions look small, and are meant to be shared.  Once you order a couple of orders of sticky rice, those portions last a while.  Get a few to sample  and lots of sticky rice.  You'll go through numerous baskets of sticky rice.The reservations list is a little nazi-esque.  But I had a large group and it worked out well for us.  Prices are fine...worth every penny.Go there.  Now."},{"name":"Pho Hong","address":"2521 Rutland Dr, Ste 400","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Best pho in town.

I am very glad I did!! My husband and I decided to treat ourselves for a late Valentine's Day dinner and have to say the service, food and environment were impeccable. We were seated in the wine cellar area downstairs which was very cozy and romantic. The waiter started off by bringing us our drinks and a basket of different breads (my favorite was the focaccia)! He was very helpful in explaining the menu to us since it was our first time. We split the spinach salad (YUM!), the steak for 2, and the creamed corn and mac and cheese for our sides. The steak was absolutely amazing!! The steak is a porterhouse and plenty but not too much for two. We consumed the whole thing! My husband is very particular about his steaks and he said it was one of the best he's ever had. I couldn't agree more! And the sides were just as great. Although the steak is very well seasoned and amazing by itself, I recommend getting a sauce to accompany it with. We ordered the black truffle butter which was delicious!! Although it was an expensive meal, it was well worth it! We will definitley be returning here and highly recommend for those who have yet to try this fabulous steakhouse!"},{"name":"Torchys Tacos","address":"4301 W William Cannon Dr, Ste G-400","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Did you hear that president Obama visited a Torchy's last time he came to Austin, and shortly thereafter announced he'd retire to Austin when his term is over?

The space - indoors and out - is attractive, comfortable, and unlike anything else in the area. I first noticed it last fall with beautiful flowers on the patio and propane fires blazing. Really lovely. Seating is comfy and there are plenty of seats and dining tables on the patio. We went on a cool night and were toasty in front of a fire. The staff was impressive. Someone else said staff was more professional than any other restaurant in Wakefield. I agree and would include surrounding towns. Waitress brought me 2 wine samples and I wasn't crazy about either. She asked me what I was looking for and said \\"trust me\\" then brought me a wine I liked v. much. We had a 5:00 reservation, but were enjoying outdoors so much, we didn't head inside until much later. Not a problem for the staff. Indoors another waitress began taking our order when we had a text from a friend who wanted to join us, but wouldn't get there for 30 mins. Waitress said \\"no problem\\" and moved us to a larger table. This was on a Friday night. In my experience no other restaurant in the area would have been that pleasantly accommodating. Every server we had enhanced our experience. For food, we enjoyed meatball apps - red sauce was very good. We also loved pasta with shrimp, roast chicken and ribeye. Less impressive was the bread - not worth the calories. I have to say the first bite of steak was gristly - I could barely chew it - but the rest was nicely cooked and digestible. Pay attention to parking. The spaces across the street are not free but they have arrangements with local lots and businesses. A couple of things i didn't see on their website: They have nightly specials (for sure I will be returning for eggplant parm!) and a weekend brunch. The work and thought that went into this restaurant makes for a very lovely dining experience. Highly recommend."},{"name":"Kainos Coffee","address":"6633 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Plenty cool and hip, even for East side Portland. A little more focused on espresso than drip, probably because they just aren't doing enough drip sales per hour to justify higher quality processes. I wouldn't tell someone to drive across town to try their drip; but I would tell someone to drive across town to check out a cool spot with good espresso. Bean selection is geared towards very cool packaging and marketing, but the choices seemed a little overpriced considering most were multi-varietal blends with little to no information about the beans. Their only single varietal option was a natural-processed Caturra from Columbia for $27 a pound. Roast degree is closer to medium roast than light.  I grabbed a bag that will pair well with my auto-drip machine; it's good and interesting, but I won't be making this my go-to roaster.  Seems like they are trying to have a few options that work decently well for drip and espresso, and charge enough to grow a business in a very competitive market. They are winning in the marketing department (although I'd like a little more info about beans) and they have a product that should give them a bright future, especially among younger espresso drinkers."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Powell's is a really cool place!

Most importantly, YES, the food is great!I took my mom to The Daily Catch while she was in Boston visiting based on a friend's recommendation. Since we got there early for dinner and there was only two of us we were lucky enough to be seated quickly (don't expect to be so lucky if you're a large group, as in 4 or more). I loved the simplicity of the place, all your food options are on a chalkboard, drinks and wine are served in plastic cups and your entrees are brought out in the pan it was made in.  Now, on to the food, for appetizers we ordered the calamari and the squid ink pasta with the punttanesca, both were delicious and flavorful. Having tried the black pasta for the first time I really like the texture and all the flavor it adsorbed from the punttaesca sauce. For entrees my mom ordered the mussels marinara, her pasta was cooked perfectly and they didn't go cheap with the amount of mussels either. I had the broiled Haddock which I thought was on of the best fish dishes I have had in a long time. The fish wasn't over cooked and flaked off easily with just a fork.

Hate to say, I am! I had a \\"healthy day\\" going and felt like having a delicious salad for dinner. As I was around the corner from this salad bar, I thought: why not! After all, I've read about Freshii and it says \\"made fresh to order\\". I don't know why but I imagined a Subway for salads. When I found out that it wasn't a Subway for salads, I had lost all interest in this place. Furthermore, I see those prices and I don't like them. But, I decided to order a salad off their menu anyway. I ask the boy for a recommendation and he selected the Asian Chop - also a house special. So, I went with that. Paid for my $10 salad and went home. Watching the boys prepare my salad was like watching 5-year-olds fingerpaint. It warms your heart to see that they are having fun doing something, but you don't want any part in or of the product. I opened up the plastic container to find a small, tiny dish of dressing. For the amount of salad in that container, there should have been at least 2 small dishes of dressing. The salad contained big chunks of lettuce (I even found a whole leaf), spinach, some soy beans, a few slices of mandarin oranges and cold chicken. It was quite tasty, but really not $10 tasty. Everything else on the menu also looked way overpriced for what you will be getting. There will probably not be a next time, Freshii.

I don't ever write reviews but I think people should really know about this. The woman who works here (she could be the owner) can be warm and funny. Or she can be extremely out of line. We waited for a long time (which is totally fine, this is a small place). While we were waiting, she talked to us and explained to us where she is from. We sat. Had our meal. Then towards the end, she comes over to our table, asks us where we are from. Then she starts giving this speech about how the people from my country are oppressed, they don't know anything because they are lied to (keep in mind, she is from Tunisia... But ok). Everything up to this point is still ok - although I just came to have dinner and not a political discussion. Then everything turned south. Her speech became plain insulting, that the people in my country are ignorant, they don't understand, they pretend to be Muslims but the are not, their hearts are not pure, etc... She asked me about my religion, I didn't feel comfortable telling her. And she kept asking. At some point, my friend tried to intervene, and the woman said to her \\"am I talking to you? No? I'm talking to her?\\" And she kept yelling at my friend. At some point, she got so close to her, I thought she was gonna hit my friend. At this point, she turned back to me, I tried to tell her that I have lived for a long time in my OWN country and it's not as she thinks. But she just wouldn't have it. She continued with her insulting speech and walked away. Then I noticed that she had some problems with another table. Apparently she said something insulting to one of them. And they asked her to apologize. And of course she didn't. This ended up in a yelling fight between the woman and someone from the other table. At this point, I wished I had yelled back at her too. Now I don't know what happened at the other table, maybe the other table was at fault... But somehow I doubt that. I will never return here again. The food was just ok. And the experience can be summed up by a bigoted woman trying to tell me about me... If she had wanted to have an open and honest discussion, that would have been great. But she wants to impose her (sometimes extremely wrong and offensive) beliefs on everyone else.

Our waiter told us he was in training, but the poor thing was TOTALLY out of his league--didn't know what was in any of the dishes, couldn't pronounce the food, and came across as very nervous.

I know it's good to have white meat, but I wanted some dark meat, too.  Other than that, I'd order it again.Khao soi $12.00 - This was actually my favourite dish. I love noodles, so that helps. Perfect blend of tasty + sweet + curry.  I want this dish all to myself next time!Papaya salad $8.00 - This is too spicy for my mouth, so I didn't have it.  But my friends enjoyed it!Wings 12.00 - These wings were really good.  I enjoyed them a lot.  Be aware that it is made with fish sauce, so if you're not liking seafood, then don't order (and give to me, plz).

The drink menu looked great too with many choices of bourbons and whiskeys in particular -- and of course, moonshine.The space is attractive, and our server was incredibly friendly, attentive and patient.

When we cut into them each of them was cooked differently, no consistency.  I ordered the fillet Oscar with crabmeat and b√©arnaise sauce. My plate was cold along with the asparagus, crabmeat and b√©arnaise sauce. The steak was lukewarm, not as though it just came off the grill.

We started off our evening with a wait of 15-20 minutes for drinks.  We did have a party of six, but the bar was not crowded and it was clear that there was no real hold up... Our second and third round of drinks were spaced out by at least 20 minutes.  We started ordering new drinks as soon as we got our first ones because it really did take that long.  Being in the service industry myself (I was a server at a very busy restaurant on the Plymouth Waterfront) I tried to give the benefit of the doubt, but round after round of drinks they were slow, not cold, and just disappointing (i.e. the sangria was not good at all).  Then the food came, it took about an hour for our food to come out.  Personally, the lobster salad was great on the lobster BLT but the white toast it came on totally took away from the meal.  At this point, it was frustrating because a lot of us had cold fries or meals, when it took an hour to get to us.  When we told our server the BLT bread was a bit stale, she went and told the kitchen.  She when came back with a hot dog bun (which was really good!) she told us that the bread tasted that way because it was toasted,,, (does she think we are idiots?)  Overall, the lobster salad was good but that was about it.  The food was very mediocre, the service was mediocre at best..I truly wish the best for this place I really hope they get it together."},{"name":"MF Sushi Atlanta","address":"299 N Highland Ave NE, Ste K","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This is in my top-3 restaurants of all time.The ambience is absolutely stunning.

The salsa was the same story. Bland, lacking flavor and poured straight out of a 5 lb container in all likelihood. We were able to spruce it up a little bit with the Cholula sauce on the table.The chips weren't much better. They at least tasted good, but they were thick like store bought chips. My guess would be they're bought bagged, then dumped into a heating bin and kept warm for serving. (Most places actually by them uncooked and deep fry them themselves.) So basically, anything they can make instant or cheaply here, they do. I'd be frightened to try the shrimp or scallops. But nonetheless, my entree was good.

Seating was slow.They start you off with Peanuts which were pretty good.We ordered the chicken wings and boar collar meat. But dishes impressed with its flavor. One of my qualms for the wings were that the fish sauce was a little too overpowering for me on the flavor of the meat. It left and aftertaste of saltiness to me. I would have to say for the price I would have to rethink it. 6 wings for $15 is pretty pricey for me. And a small dish of the boar meat was around $15 as well. The portions for the price in my opinion didn't really match up.

This was decent fare. I had never heard of Mighty Bird before, and upon looking at their menu online, I was honestly sort of confused. Was this a rotisserie chicken place like Boston Market? Or was this a taco place like Torchy's? As it turns out, it's sort of both and while it is an odd concept, it's a good one and it works.  The only thing that wasn't up to par was the rice. It was oddly undercooked and also dry. It looked pretty - with lots of cilantro leaves mixed in and veggies, but sadly lacked taste and the texture was majorly off. The beans were seasoned and nice, the tortillas were really good, the rotisserie chicken was moist and flavorful, and the queso was excellent with big chunks of hatch peppers in it. The guacamole and the chips were also pretty good. I was thinking of going four stars on this, but the rice really was deplorable, so I'm going three, but I'm going to say that really it's 3.5. The other reason for the dropped star count is that their online ordering didn't work for the whole chicken, so my husband had to call it in, and when he got there pick up for orders was a little confusing.

Calamari was fresh and tender. 3 stars.Sicilian littleneck clams: The plump littleneck clams were quite tender and tasty.  Seasoning was spot-on.  Generous portion. 4 stars.Agolio E Olio: Black pasta with ground squid and pressed and chopped garlic.  This dish was kind of broken in my opinion, since the ground squid and garlic cannot blend evenly and bind together, you will naturally only eat the under-seasoned noodles because the ground squid and garlic would stick to the pan and thongs.  The noodles have some doughy aftertaste although they seemed to be cooked properly.  If you can blend the ground squid and garlic with the noodles evenly, it will taste better, but still kind of one-note.  2 Stars.Service: I didn't expect great service here since there are only three employees here and lots of customers.  But I don't understand why they add 18% gratitude automatically even for party-for-two.  The service here was actually kind of slow, and people sometimes stayed in line just because of short of servers rather than short of seats.  2 stars.All in all, fortunately it didn't take too much time for me staying in the line, or I will be super disappointed spending hours waiting for mediocre food."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Such an awesome place to visit.

Turns out, Pok Pok has no lines during their weekday lunch service.We ordered the Kai Yang Chicken - Charcoal toasted stuffed with herbs and spices- chicken was moist, but blander tasting than I expected (expectation based on the description).  The 2 sauces were good and made the bites of chicken taste distinctly different depending on which sauce the chicken was dipped into.Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings was clearly the star of the meal.  Great flavor and crunch.  The 6 wing portion is equivalent to 12 wings compared to the typical chicken wing service since each wing included the drumette and the wing part.I brought a couple of the wings home to pair with the Pok Pok Rhubarb Shandy that I had in my refrigerator- the Shandy paired really well with the wings.I enjoyed the Kung Op Wun Sen - Prawns baked in a clay pot with clear noodles very much.  The chef used caramelized onions to create a great taste experience.I recommend the sticky rice over the jasmine rice to go with the chicken wings while the jasmine rice was a better pairing for the Kai Yang Chicken.I'm traveling to Thailand soon and I'm looking forward to trying the street food in Bangkok.I'll update the review with an after Thailand perspective."},{"name":"Piazza Italia","address":"1129 NW Johnson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The service was poor and the food was salty and cold inside"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"4.5 after eating here, I understand why everyone loves this place and how andy ricker is now an empire.  in order to avoid the wait, come for lunch instead.  otherwise you'll have to wait a long time, probably over at whiskey soda lounge.  offering non-cookie cutter thai dishes was a smart move, especially focusing on northern dishes and starting in portland where I think the competition is a bit easier.  he has chosen some specific great vietnamese dishes and flavors as well, but did a great rendition of steak salad: Neua Naam Tok -- spicy isaan flank steak salad with fish sauce, lime and chili powder dressing, shallots, lemongrass, mint, cilantro and toasted rice powder.  right on point with the heat and citrus.\\nordered the Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings with spice: fresh natural chicken wings marinated in fish sauce and palm sugar, deep fried, tossed in caramelized phu quoc fish sauce and garlic and served with vietnamese table salad, which was good but the garnishes were less pickled than typical.  very sticky glaze, and his own unique flavor.\\nalso had the Kai Yang: charcoal rotisserie roasted natural game hen stuffed with lemongrass, garlic, pepper, and cilantro served with spicy sweet and sour and tamarind dipping sauces.  overall nice.\\nalso the khao soi curry noodle soup with chicken, noodles a bit limp and sweet milky broth, which needs the extra garnishes added in. more mainstream taste.\\nservice great, like many restaurants in Portland."},{"name":"Caf√© Luna","address":"612 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Cafe Luna has my best interest at heart.Now, I had to take 'em down a star for the 'interesting' hours of operation, but other than that, they are amazing.The customer service is great - the employees are quick to greet you and make sure you feel welcome.

Excited to see that there is finally a place that serves Korean fried chicken that is NOT Bon Chon, I decided to try it out.We had the Soy Garlic and Spicy wings, which are called Wow wings. I liked it--it was more crispy than at Bon Chon. And while it did have the soy garlic and spicy flavors as promised, it did not have that immediate bold flavor that you taste at Bon Chon during the initial first bite. Overall, the wings were pretty good. My only disappointment was that the wings did not come with Korean cole slaw or pickled radish, which is why I'm giving this review four stars.Other things we tried:Bulgogi bibimbap: pretty much tastes like the usual from every other Korean restaurant, though not as spicy.Spicy pork bao baos: absolutely amazing!

But VERY salty!Ordered the Pok Pok special: $12.  It consisted Cornish hen, a handful of papaya salad, and a handful of sticky rice.  Hen was good, well seasoned but on the dry side.  Still very good.  Papaya salad was ok.  I asked for medium but it was mild.  Overall, a tasty but pricey meal considering I got 1/4 of a cornish hen.My sister ordered kra pao gai kai dao (basil chicken with fried egg and side of white rice): $10'ish.  I thought it was pretty good.  Very much like how street vendors in Thailand makes it (having visited many times, I know).  But if you haven't been to BKK like my sister you may not be prepared for the chunks of chilis!  Warning!  I still liked it.  Again, pricey for a very very simple meal. $10! Goodness, it is more like 8.50 at most especially with the small portion.BF ordered crab fried rice spice: $12.  This was amazing, well flavored and balanced,  very very good.  The portion was good for lunch but again the price is $12! The plate is appetizer size so not the usual entree portion of most thai eateries.We also got boat noodles and pork satay. The boat noodles were excellent and very good.  Pork satay was a bit dry and the peanut sauce was ok.  Not as savory was I would like it to be.Overall, ambience was cool and very yuppy Portland.  However, having been there three times it's not the kind of place where'd you see me as a regular because it is pretty spendy.I see Pok Pok as the haute couture line of fashionable Portland.  You are paying for a name more so the service and ambiance.  For goodness sakes, we waited over 30 minutes for our food that came plate at a time.  This was at 2 PM! The waitress seemed a bit \\"airy\\" and I don't think she really listed but she was very nice.All in all, a great place to bring someone visiting Portland who wants a great experience of something..

However, with Pho Basil, I never fail to leave with a doggy bag.Third, price: when you consider the portions, and can wind up with two meals for under $10, this place is all win.Service is also pretty great, though I'm not sure how laid-back they'd be if you wanted to savor the food coma after the meal.

I dream about these wings.  Extra spicy, the hotter, the better, and they just melt in your mouth.  They're like meat candy!Other menu items are equally delicious.  the Papaya salad is tasty and goes well with sticky rice!  Every dish has been hand-selected by the owner from his extensive travels of Asian cultures - local recipes from exotic locales, all brought here to Portland for your dining pleasure.  They also have excellent (albeit expensive) cocktails! It's definitley a crowded place on most nights.  The wait is negligible, though, because after you give your name to the hostess, you can saunter across the street to the Matchobx lounge, and Pok Pok will call the Matchbox bartender and let you know your table is ready.  You can relax and have a cocktail or two (which are excellent as well), depending on how long the wait is.  What a great cross-business promotion for these places!The atmosphere in Pok Pok is very cozy - some might say cramped, at least in the Whiskey Soda lounge area.  The tables are close together, and eavesdropping is an unfortunate effect of such close quarters.  This can be a good thing, though - I've tried several dishes just because what the neighboring table was having looked so good!  There is also outdoor seating available, but I haven't been there in the summertime... they have a walk-up window which will definitley be a regular destination for me as I ride my bike around the SouthEast.A word of warning - they do not offer their full menu at all times of the day.

On a whim, I decided to go to Pok Pok for Lunch. On the Trimet, it's a simple \\"jump to the left\\" (#70 Bus), then a \\"step to the right\\" (#4). And as much as watching people is fun regarding my fellow sometimes nerdy professionals, being on a Portlandia Bus is even better. My favourite overhead conversation today was a lady asking the bus driver if he could extend his route an extra hour so that she could get home more conveniently.Pok Pok is a popular place and I had been previously advised that going for lunch during the week might better assure a seat at the table or bar. That was certainly true today, although by the time I left, the place was full both inside and outside.The service could have been better than today's \\"A-OK\\". My waiter had the expected friendly and casual Portland personality. However, he was a bit detached, slow in taking my order, short on menu choice explanations, and maybe a tiny bit flip on top of that. I've seen stronger versions of that behaviour before at well regarded restaurants that let all the praise they receive go to their head. But in the end, I let it go and decided to just enjoy the space, the energetic mid-day vibe, and of course my meal.The food was simply fabulous. I ordered the Phat Si Ew (a woked pork, vegetables, and rice noodles dish) and am still marvelling at the rich variety of flavours that came rushing in and around my pallet at every bite.

The extensive menu covers just every sweet AND savory dish possible. The lemon ricotta pancakes are amazing. It's just tart enough to balance out the sweetness from the fruit and whipped cream. The pancakes are very moist and just melt in your mouth. However, I've had fluffier pancakes before.My go-to is the Joe's Breakfast Sliders. 2 warm honey biscuits stuffed with fig jam, arugula, your choice of meat, and pepper jack cheese. My IDEAL brunch meal. And it comes with the best home fries I've ever had. I usually pick the corned beef hash to go in the sliders. It's so flavorful and the texture is awesome. It's the perfect sweet & salty combo. The home fries are perfectly crispy on the outside and very well seasoned. I would order a side of home fries if they didn't already come with my meal. The one thing I was disappointed by with the belgian waffle. It was just WAY too sweet with the fruit and the lemon/marscapone topping, and the waffle itself was just super crunch and not very fluffy in the middle. It was like eating a cracker. Maybe it was just an off day. This is my favorite brunch spot in boston and I would 100% recommend this place for taking your friends when they come visit for an awesome brunch experience.

I went with the Churro French toast from the daily specials menu as per the waiter's recommendation, and was not disappointed at all! The French toast was perfectly crispy around the edges and pillowy on the inside with a strong cinnamon flavor. The dulce de leche was very sweet and delicious. I ended up scraping a little bit off, but better too much than too little in my opinion.

I'd always enjoyed Dutch pancakes so definitely wanted to try it again....but, I also wanted to have a Dutch omelette breakfast......so, fortunately I was able to bring my father with me.I just love the location of this DD! Right at the waterfront of the Vancouver Convention Center at Canada Place....and right beside where I used to live in Coal Harbor, so the location brings back lots of fond memories.Anyway, this DD location is new, modern, colorful, and bright with huge windows giving you awesome waterfront views out to North and West Vancouver. There's mostly indoor seating, but also outdoor patio, which would be great on a wonderful day, but it seemed that many people like to sit outdoors despite how cold it was.So, I went ahead and ordered the Chicken Avocado Omelette....which comes with cubes of chicken, avocado, cheddar cheese, green peppers, tomatoes, and onions....we get a choice of toast (I had sourdough) and includes fruit or salad (I took the fruit), and hash browns....in the States they're known as country/home-style potatoes. My father ordered the Banana, Strawberries, and whip Dutch Pancake (or Pannekoeken).....ok, I intentionally ordered this for him.Everything was so good! ....and really hit the right spot this early in the morning. I really have no complaints about the food....other than that I was so stuffed after finishing my breakfast, and then helped my father finish half of his pancake!My only complaint would be that service was so so so slow!....and it was not easy flagging someone down for some service.

It was fine but I think I've had the same cup of soup at TGI Fridays in DFW airport. I chose the meatloaf because I thought it would be safe yet unique. It was neither. It was just bad. Not good - bad. It had little to no flavor and while it was a cute idea to serve it in its own little Pyrex dish, that only thing that guaranteed was a burnt tongue with every single bite. The red beans and rice suffered the same affliction as the meatloaf - no flavor. My wife got the BAT sandwich and the bacon was overly fatty and not cooked enough.

The lobster roll on the other hand was not enjoyable at all.  The lobster meat itself was fine, but the dressing was bland.  There was way too much celery flavor, overpowering the lobster.  Worst of all, the bun had a really bitter flavor.  Almost like it was burnt, but it didn't look burnt.  It just left a horrible taste in my mouth.The service was mediocre at best.  We went at 5pm, so it wasn't busy.  One of our waiters rubbed me the wrong way.  When he asked if we wanted still or sparkling water, I answered \\"can we have regular tap water please?\\"  His answer was, \\"uh... it's free.\\"First of all, I dislike restaurants trying to upsell bottled water.  I don't drink bottled water for environmental reasons, and it bothered me that the waiter assumed it was for monetary reasons.  I think that was really rude.  After that, the service was just okay.  Bottom line: I don't think we will be visiting ICOB again.  Oysters were great, but I can get the same quality at Neptune Oysters, where they have the best lobster roll in the world."},{"name":"Wok Eat","address":"946 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"2.5","text":"A half-dozen people (myself included) had to wait 20 minutes to get their food because the manager decided to run a skeleton crew of himself and one newbie employee in the middle of the afternoon (2PM).

It took me three years to come back because all of my Chinese friends told me it just wasn't great anymore. Today, I went back. I had a good meal. real good. My friends and I were hesitant to go, but we wanted to eat Chinese food, we didn't want to wait, and we didn't want to go too far. Din Ho was close and easy. We sat down, ordered a few dishes (family style): roast duck, seafood pan fried noodles, Fresh Shrimp Wonton Noodle Soup, and shrimp with Chinese broccoli. I'm not sure if it was because we came on a Sunday during lunch time, but all of our food came out in minutes. We were starving, so nothing could have made us happier. The duck was DEEEELLICIOUSSS, the soup was great too. Actually, everything was great. Nothing we ordered was bad. We finished everything (between the three of us), save a few pieces of noodle and left happy, full, and with a much higher opinion of the place. (Disclaimer, the dishes we got are pretty hard-- but not impossible-- to mess up for a decent Chinese restaurant. Actually, I've found that the dishes that are the easiest to mess up, and how you can tell if a Chinese restaurant is even worth revisiting, are the more commonly eaten orange chicken, kung pao chicken, general tsao's etc. Those are surprisingly very often botched. Unfortunately those aren't my favorite dishes, so I can't say how they are here, but if you fancy it, it's worth a try.)_______________________________________________\\nTIPS: When you go to a Chinese restaurant, the BEST way to eat is FAMILY STYLE. Why? because it allows you to try the most dishes, the most variety, and get the most bang for your buck. Also when I order, I always try to do: 1 meat/seafood, 1 pan fried noodle, and 1 vegetable AT LEAST. From there if you have money (or the appetite) a soup is always a good appetizer, buns, and maybe an additional meat/seafood dish. Sometimes you can combine some of these options (a la shrimp and Chinese broccoli)"},{"name":"Din Ho Chinese BBQ","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 116","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Just an update, went again last night.

I then selected to have NO ginger, as in, no ginger with the sushi.  Instead, the reversed happened where they GAVE me ginger and skipped the dressing.  I ate my salad dry while I called them back to check if dressing was supposed to come on the side.  I was put on hold and spoke with a girl who (probably) put together the order and then SHE questioned whether or not I knew what I had ordered.

I started off with a nice delicious crisp glass of ros√© which our waitress recommended. For appetizers we got the fried oyster sliders and a plate of raw oysters. The fried oysters were amazing and probably the best thing we had! They were fried perfectly and not too oily and the bun it came on was crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The raw oysters were amazing too! They were super fresh and tasty. They have an extensive rotating list of oysters so we tried 3 types and it was amazing the different taste each of them had. For our entrees my boyfriend got the salmon which had so much flavor and pretty much melted in your mouth. I tried the bluefish which was equally as good and the skin was crisped so it had a nice crunch to it!If you're looking for a nice night out come to this place!

No. It was wicked good though. Certainly the way the serve things is a little different. You walk up to the counter and tell them what you want and they serve it up on some wax paper and put it in a large plastic soda box (there's a better word, I just can't think of it). I actually went there twice, once for dinner after I arrived in Austin and then again when the group went out to lunch the next day. I initially was looking to go eat at a place that popped up on Yelp called the Soup Peddler. I had glanced at the review on my crackberry and didn't read the fact that you have to pre-order it. Needless to say I was disappointed, but if I get back there - I will certainly make the right arrangements the next time. Positives - Prime Rib - smoked and done right, it has that pink ring around the meat that comes from smoking it. That was dinner. Lunch was the moist brisket and that was Awesome!. Also had cole slaw with lunch and that reminded me of a much better version of KFC's coleslaw (please - don't take offense to this, it was very good, the style just reminds me of this!!). Also a piece of the jalapeno sausage and a pork rib and both were very very tasty. \\nDownside - There isn't really too much of a downside, but things that didn't live up to the rest of the experience. The potato salad was too wet and didn't have any crunch (you need to have a crunch factor for good potato salad in my book). The sauce was good. I can't explain why I was disappointed with it. I really did like a little of that sauce drizzled over the prime rib and the brisket, it was just missing something and sorry, I just can't describe what it was. I also had the regular sausage and that was a bigger disappointment. It was just too bland for me - if you feel the need for sausage here - get the one with Jalapeno. Other notes - they have both sweetened and more importantly \\"unsweetened\\" tea. As you walk through the line you can pick out some soda's or beers (Bud/Miller/Lone Star and I think Heineken) as well as hit the case for coleslaw, potato salad and pickles. You order the creamed corn (and they use cream!) along with the meat at the counter. They have two desserts - which I wisely passed on (not for the taste factor, merely for the \\"if I eat all of this I will be the size of house\\" factor.Both locations I went to share space with a convenience store/gas station which just makes me laugh.

Tusday night is $2.00 pizza night and the pizza is the best pizza around in our opinion better than Randolphs Lynnwood restaurant. Thursday nights are $1.00 hamburg nights with each topping only $.50. Most nights you seat yourself so saying there was a long wait before being seated is in our opinion inaccurate.

I always knew this place was the best sushi/seafood buffet Atlanta had to offer.. but with the new items, i like this place even more now.Nori Nori is open only for select Lunch and Dinner hours - meaning they are closed in between. Dinner starts at 6pm on the weekdays and currently priced at $27. Dinner on the weekends are $30.Dinner is always more expensive but offer many more options other than sushi and hot food. This time, I noticed they added some new items to their selections. - The crab legs moved over to where the sashimi and salads are. I asked if they could steam my crab legs but they said they do not. was a bit disappointed but the crab legs were perfectly cooked (shells cracked easily and meat came out whole) - Not to salty. It was just.. cold.\\n- Oysters also moved with them to the salad side.\\n- They offer crawfish now! The crawfish were HUGE. from head to tail, easily 8-9 inches and very thick. Easy to crack and eat. \\n- A couple more tartar dishes and hot food items are available.Overall, this place is clean, has an abundance of food, variety, large interior, and great service. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone that hasn't been before. Yes, you'll have to fork over some $$ but if you think about getting a sashimi/sushi platter at a sushi place for $30 bucks... this place wins hands down.GO GO GO GO GO!!!!!"},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"If you're visiting Portland, carve out at least and hour make a trip to this store."},{"name":"Java Monkey","address":"425 Church St","city":"Decatur","stars":"3.5","text":"I really wanted to like it but the servers were more interested in talking amongst themselves than making me feel like a welcome customer.That alone would not warrant a low rating - but my americano was so poorly executed that I only made it through half my drink and then threw the remainder in the garbage as I left.

I have *never* before had a restaurant completely overlook the fact that two out of the four people in a party never received their order. We ordered drinks, a roll for the table, some miso soup, and four entrees. We were aware that it was a very busy night and knew that getting our meals would probably take a little longer than usual. But then only two of our entrees arrived, and because several servers brought out the food at different times, nobody was checking to make sure the entire order had been filled. There was also no explanation why the other dishes were taking so long. Only when the two people who did get served finish their meals did our original server show up, and he clearly had no clue that half of our orders had never been filled. He spoke to the kitchen and they finally made the other two dinners (by then, it was at least an hour after we were originally seated), but it was awkward having to eat them since the other two members of our party had already finished their meals and just had to sit there, and the restaurant did not seem terribly concerned that things had been bungled so badly. They did offer a glass of complimentary house sake, but that was was not really a helpful gesture on the restaurant's part, since one of our party was underage and another felt her Mother's Day dinner had been spoiled and simply wanted to go home."},{"name":"Thai Wok Kitchen","address":"5000 E 4th Plain Blvd, Ste A101","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"We love Asian cooking, especially Thai and tried the Thai Wok Kitchen reently.

This was my first time eating here so I inquired about the broken leg combo that is advertised on a sign. This is where all of the customer service complaints ring true about this place. The young lady with all the piercings in her face was so rude and acted like she could not explain to me was the plate was. She stated it was a little smaller than the large crab combo plate. I had no idea what comes in either and she definitely wasn't going to tell me so I just went ahead and ordered the broken leg combo. I'm happy I did! The shrimp were really big. It came with a small snow crab cluster and lots of potatoes and sausage! The sauce was really good but maybe too much butter. It took only about 10 minutes for my food to be prepared and I was out.

Getting off at Sand Lake and getting to Chuy's was a terrible experience and put me in an annoyed mood. When we walked into the restaurant I was taken aback. Pretentiously, it's been a while since I've been in a Chilis/Applebee's/Friday's level restaurant (so I think I've been spoiled)- the decor is eclectic and silly and for some reason it looks like a diner. This combined with the tons of tourists toned down my excitement over the menu a bit. BUT, we decided to have fun with it.We ordered margaritas to start. I got blood orange and the BF got the regular one with a Coronita stuck in it and a side shot of Grand Marnier. They definitely weren't what we paid for them but weren't bad. I got a sangria next and it was tasty with a $6 price tag that made me happier for the quality.Chips and a fresh spicy salsa came out quickly. The chips are the thin kind that I like (similar to Chilis) so those made me happy. We ordered queso as well. It's cheese mixed with ranchero sauce and green chili sauce and has a smokey sort of flavor. It's more saucy than cheesy and was not bad.The BF got the steak burrito with a side of guac and I got the Southwestern. It was quite a lot of food and it was pretty tasty food. BF really liked the guac. I've had better food at other local places for much cheaper cost though.Overall it wasn't bad. I probably won't go back because of the location (I know there's other locations), the fact that it's a chain, the crowdedness, and the cost.

My friend was disappointed that they don't carry roast beef and that for as big as the sandwiches are, they don't cut them in half. The lunch sandwiches come with utz chips, and although the price is okay I think they could reduce it by a dollar based on my second visit. Based on my first visit I would gladly pay $6 every day for that service and sandwich. My second visit on a Sat, the women were nice enough. They were out of plain bagels at 2 pm so I ordered my sandwich on a wheat, which normally is not a big difference but I didn't really like this wheat bagel.

Hard to describe if your proboscis isn't as large as a battleship, but should you ever acquire the inane knowledge that comes from thousands of years of pure northern Italian heritage and a mother that cooked like there was no tomorrow, you learn these things naturally, whether you liked it or not. Can't everyone detect a good sauce from 15 yards away?Anyway, the dish is sitting in front of me and the strong odor of acid is wafting through my olfactory glands. Yes, I could tell that this sauce was gonna' burn, and boy did it. Nothing I dislike more than acidic marinara sauce, especially one that could burn the rust off of a car (remember that cocacola rumor?).Not only was the sauce acidic, but even the homemade Fusilli was tough. I could tell it was homemade, but it was undercooked to say the least. Being someone who doesn't complain normally I ate all the Fusilli despite that due to intense hunger, but of course scraped the sauce off of each Fusilli before doing so.The worst part of this ordeal, was that there was SO MUCH of this bad sauce. No lie I had, like a volcano left behind after eating all the Fusilli. Had the sauce been good I would have eaten as much as I could fit and could take the rest of it in a recycled family-sized Ragu jar.The bread that came with it was decent, not the best, but decent, very moist and of course that ubiquitous flavored oil (aka Italian Butter) that everyone has become so familiar with, which was ok by the way.After paying the bill and being in total shock that this whole thing cost me 20 dollars, I had to say SOMETHING to the barmaid. I told her how bad tasting this sauce was and all she had to offer was \\"sorry you didn't like it\\", then walked away. No offer to ask \\"why?\\" or coupons or a talk to the manager or anything. Funny thing was, I wasn't suprised after tasting that bitter sauce and will not be returning unless I am invited (boy I'm full of myself now).Here is some advice to those \\"chefs\\" at Focaccia's. To reduce acid in a tomato sauce, use three large whole unpeeled carrots in the sauce, then throw them out when the sauce is done. That's it - boy was that hard or what. Of course alternatives are to use a few tablespoons of grapejelly (yes I said grapejelly) or sugar, but grapejelly works so much better. Then there are tomato alternatives as well. Ever seen those yellow tomatoes? Those are very low-acid tomatoes and make a decent sauce when mixed with regular red plum tomatoes. Of course, you should experiment.In Focaccia's case, they should use all three examples, at the same time, no really it was that bad. Maybe it was a bad night, I don't know. If anyone knows the owners there please feel free to pass this on, I mean really.Normally for a not-good meal, I would use the thumbs-down icon, which I rarely write about, but this one just made me mad."},{"name":"The Nook On Piedmont Park","address":"1144 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"My friend and I decided to have lunch here today.

The hotel recommended this place because they'll deliver to the hotel but since it's super close I decided to call in for pickup. I ordered a sesame chicken dinner combo. I figured they'd tell me 10 or 15 minutes until it'd be ready but instead they asked ME \\"when will you be here?\\" which I found funny! Upon unwrapping and eating my meal included: small cup of wonton soup (rating:C+ basically broth which tasted off in some way I can't put my finger on and one pork wonton which was tasty) a bag of fried plain wonton strips (not really a necessary addition but I threw some in my extra soup broth) one crab Rangoon (rating:A one of the best I've ever had I was sad there was only one because I would have easily eaten a half dozen of these! Could taste the crab they weren't just warm cream cheese like most places) one egg roll (rating: confused; tasty but filled with just cabbage which is odd but ok) a nice sized portion of sesame chicken (rating: b+ good flavor not too fried not soggy just right on the sauce spinkles of sesame seeds on top all in all not the world's best but definitely satisfying) and a side of fried rice (rating: boring; plain white rice, fried with a tiny bit of egg here and there, with nothing else in it.

Sushi chefs hand us 2 normal rolls,which we give back, since we order hand rolls. Chefs tell the waiter, who doesn't make it back to us for another 10 minutes.  Waiter apologizes while refilling our water and gives us okono (which isn't how it normally is made). Chefs eventually hand us our rolls.We finish that and wait for another 20 min or so. No check in, no water refill,nothing. We see the waiter hanging out at the register the majority of the time.  Finally I go up to him and ask him to ring us up, and to cancel the rest of our order. I said we had been there for an hour without getting our entre, which he said was not true. He was right, but honestly 45 minutes with slow inconsistent service and no entire could make anyone feel like they had been waiting for an hour. He then told me he had \\"scheduled\\" our meal out because we wanted the okano first, even though he got us the wrong rolls first. He then asked me if I had gotten the ramen, to which I said no.

I normally like to bring my lunch from home, but I was excited to try a restaurant I had never been to before.We had both read the Yelp reviews for La Fonda Latina's Buckhead location beforehand, and we were a little hesitant about trying it due to some of the two-star reviews.  However, I made the decision that we'd still give it a shot.Although La Fonda Latina was probably less than two miles from the office, driving from my office parking lot to the restaurant took about 10 minutes after I left around 11:30 am on a Thursday.  I was glad that there was free parking in the back, but I was surprised at how packed the parking lot was since it wasn't even noon yet.The inside of the restaurant has limited space and is kind of cramped.  There was outside seating available, and most customers sat there, but my friend and I decided to sit inside.While we were looking at the menu, our server brought us complimentary tortilla chips and salsa.  The chips and salsa were pretty good, but of course, the salsa contained cilantro.  =(After staring at the menu for a while and trying to decide whether I wanted a burrito or a Bocadillo Cubano (Cuban sandwich), I went with a beef burrito.* Beef Burrito ($7.75) - This burrito consisted of \\"Shredded Angus beef, refried black beans, cheddar and Monterrey jack cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions and sour cream, rolled in warm flour tortilla.\\"  The burritos are served with refried black beans and rice on the side.  I requested for no onions to be put in my burrito, and I was pleased that it didn't contain any.  The beef was tender and flavored pretty nicely, but I think some type of sauce would have made it better.  I added some hot sauce, which helped.  The beans and rice were decent, and the meal as a whole was filling.Overall, La Fonda Latina gets 3 stars for their \\"OK\\" beef burrito and good chips.  Afterwards, I realized I should have tried a Bocadillo Cubano instead of a burrito since they're probably better.  Service was fairly quick, but we did try to avoid the lunch rush by arriving before noon.  I probably won't return to this location, but perhaps I'll eventually try a Bocadillo Cubano at one of their other three locations in Georgia.[Review 307 of 366]"},{"name":"Marcello's at Emory","address":"1540 Ave Pl, Ste B280","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The crust was so crunchy and the staff was so great.

I can honestly say that Nori Nori is a quality sushi establishment so far that you realize that this is a buffet. I have been for lunch ($16) and Dinner ($26) and both have been a pretty good value as long as you can put away some food. The difference between lunch and dinner is the seafood placed for dinner (crab legs and oysters) otherwise its almost the same. Being a buffet style restaurant the main headline of the sushi bar is rolls. And they have a lot! I've actually had some of the best sushi rolls here, with very creative combination of fresh ingredients. The sashimi served during dinner is of good quality but I won't go as far as to say the best sashimi I've ever had, but for what you're paying its pretty good quality. They also have a yakitori grill for dinner and the selection, though modest, is quite tasty. On the opposite side of the sushi bar is a 'salad' bar. I put salad in quotes because this is not your typical salad bar. There's the normal affair but have you had miso and tofu salad? Didn't think so. This however was a very elegant and well done version of the typical salad bar. Here you will also find variations of the seaweed salad etc. Finally the hot foods.

There are good things to be said about this place. I like the metal statue of creatures playing music out front and I especially like the cool little light in the sidewalk that lights them up. I find the interior to be reasonably comfortable. The Tex-Mex menu is OK but not in any way memorable. The bar is good, nice cocktails and great big beers, but sometimes the glass wear tastes soapy.I also feel like Mad Mex is pretty expensive compared to other tex mex places. Somewhere like El Vaquero would probably deliver better value. Every now and then I would go to Mad Mex for a quick drink because it's close to home. Now I have the even more dimly lit Village Idiot for that. Sadly, I can't recommend Mad Mex and I think this spot could use a reboot.

I also see salmon and tuna nigiri on the belt from time to time, as well as calamari and cream puffs and the like.As mentioned, it is conveyor-belt sushi, so this isn't Bamboo-quality fish.

Unfortunately crossing the Sahara through Libya and experiencing the Festival in the Desert are on hold. I don't think I'm up for the experience of getting lost and going native in Bowles' The Sheltering Sky. But I am curious about the food of Northwest Africa.Fortunately it's available right here in Portland in this small cafe!They have a simple menu, with breakfast all day!I had the Merguez lamb sausage with tomato sauce and an egg. It was accompanied by a white flour harcha bread, an about 3/4 inch thick puffy North African take on the pita. There was an about 3/4 inch diameter sausage and another about 1/2 inch, with the smaller seeming a little bit more hot spiced, though I may be mistaken. Overall the sausages were relatively mild. The tomato sauce had chopped tomatoes and a slight lemon flavor. Fresh tomato has been declining in flavor for years, but these canned were of good quality. The egg was a great sunny side up, and some sliced green olives provide saltiness and texture. Whoever invented the olive, thanks!I also had the mild eggplant, tomato and oil Zaalook dip. It reminds me of my ideal baba ghanoush which omits the tahini. The Zaalook is also mild, is accompanied by harcha bread, and comes in a cool mini tagine hatted dish. I'm not sure what I would serve in them, but I need some of these dish hats for home! Again a simple offering of ground roasted eggplant, a little tomato and oil.This little casual restaurant is painted in a muted orange. It has Islamic tile wainscoting, traditional lampshades of the region and decorative artifacts on the walls. Islam's prohibition of some pictorial depiction has resulted in centuries of geometric patterned tiles. It's always a pleasure to see their infinite variation - it's the original psychedelia sacred geometry. The spot has a soundtrack of music from the region that was fun, interesting and not intrusive.Order at the counter with a $.50 cent charge for credit and debit cards. The owner, chief cook and bottle washer does it all and each meal is made to order. But he was not to busy to check mid-meal on customer satisfaction.

The atmosphere sitting outside was very enjoyable, (they had large fans blowing into the patio area.) But our server Jeff treated us incredibly rudely. When he first came to our table, he was soft spoken. When I asked if he could speak up, he said no, claiming it was the noise from the street traffic, and proceeded to lean forward and talk directly into our faces, completely disregarding personal space. Thereafter, he continuously ignored our table when we tried to call him over for help understanding the menu, help when we received the wrong food, and when we were in need of drink refills. He left us feeling that he went out of his way to make himself unavailable for our table, as we saw him checking in on other tables frequently and engaging with them in a pleasant manner. We waited a long time for the check because he had disappeared, and when he came with the check he threw it down on the table and walked away before we could even ask him to split it for us.

My friend ordered the French toast but received fried chicken. She went to have it remade, however this still did take about ten mins or so. She comped the meal which is great, but still frustrating. My friend and I asked for some of their house made chili sauce and waited for over five minutes. She came back to the table to fill coffee and she had totally forgotten. By this point my food was getting a bit cold.The food itself was pretty good. I had the fried chicken which was on mashed potatoes with a dill pickle \\"sauce\\" (more just pieces of pickles).

My order was the BBQ pork and BBQ duck on rice since they didn't have any crispy skin pork under the light. First off if I'm paying for something and I'm taking the order to go. Please please please make sure that I get exactly what I ordered. It's really an inconvenience to have to turn my vehicle around to get the portion of ducky that I paid for but didn't get. Since I brought up portions. The meal was $12.00 with a roasted milk tea with pearls. Now this is me comparing to Richmond standards. The Togo box was a sectioned plastic container. I guess I can appreciate the separation. But I prefer to have my meat juice soaked all through the rice. As most places will put it in a styrofoam box with the meat on top. Maybe I'm just taking a guess here. But how the container felt when I opened it was \\"wow that's a lot of rice!.. and only a small section of meat.\\" I believe how the containers are designed they are able to give smaller meat portions that look like the containers are full to the brim. I only got about 6 pcs of BBQ pork and 5 pieces of BBQ duck.(oh and when I went back and told them I didn't get my duck. I watch the butcher search for a smallest piece possible, was not impressed) The meat itself was done decently pork was good and fatty and soft duck was moist and delicious. Just wish I had a decent portion. Some may say rice is rice. But rice if not done right is not good. There rice was good fluffy and not dry. Nice and light not sticky. Anyways like I said from the beginning I may be spoiled getting to enjoy Richmond Asian BBQ whenever so maybe it may not be fair.

The space is small and open. Our service was great. The menu had something for everyone including our 9 year old daughter. The sangria was very good and a refreshing choice on a summer night according to my wife. I had the cucumber collins and it was very well made.Acton location: Our server Becca was nothing less than exceptional. She was very friendly, helpful with the menu and made us feel very comfortable. My son is a Poutine  connoisseur so we started with that. Approval all around. The Applewood smoked jumbo wings were fabulous and not greasy feeling. Terrific smoked flavor. I had the shrimp and grits and thoroughly enjoyed it. A wonderful mix of 6 large shrimp alongside the grits topped with cherry tomatoes and diced meat.  Very tasty and filling. Great gluten free options abound . Good kid options and healthy sides to choose from. The house made root beer is great. We sat outside on a gorgeous summer night which was a great choice. Two separate couples came with dogs with them who sat table side on the outside patio. Not being a dog person I wasn't overjoyed with others pets next to me while I ate, bu they weren't intrusive at all and I didn't even notice them. More active or nosy dogs would have been a big turn off for me. But if you have dogs, it seems that the establishment welcomes them to sit with you outside while you dine. A plus for pet owners. My kids liked to play the cornhole game outside while we waited for our table, which was about 20 minutes on a Friday at about 6. A great drink from the bar while we waited and before we knew it we were seated. A bonus perk was a regular at the bar who gave us some insight into the history of the property and owners.

However, I do plan on a second go around since I went on a Sunday. My first disappointment was in finding a 'brunch' menu instead of the regular menu found on line. Since looking at the menu online, I already had my mind set on what I was going to get but only found a few regular menu items. \\nI chose a breakfast burrito that was huge and very good. My huge pillow of flour was stuffed with eggs, shredded pork, beans and was covered in queso. The dish came with Mexican Hash and fruit. The hash came out as burned small potato bits. I posted a photo and there is another photo posted by someone else where you can see the comparison.\\nSince it was my first time, I told our server I wanted to try the sampler. The sampler is queso, quac, and black bean. I know I clearly asked for the sampler, as it's called, but what I got was a 'sampling' of each. I asked if I this was the regular size and if I would be paying the full price for that. This was when I discovered I was given a 'sampling' and not the 'sampler'.....whew.\\nMy friend got the steak and eggs. The steak looked good and was about 5oz.  A little on the small size. \\nThe chips and salsa were good. We were served warm chips that were tasty and two types of salsa. One was really spicy and had some roasted corn in it. Since I like spicy this was a nice surprise and tasted fresh. \\nOn Sunday's they have bottomless Mimosas at $10. The house margarita at $6 was good also. You could taste the tequila and the drink was not overpowered wit a 'mix' flavor.  Service was good.

I quickly said yes and ordered a hurache. \\nit was delicious (and not deep fried) \\nthey have a salsa bar which is \\nwonderful. and it was stocked and full.\\non top of the hurache was beans, pico de gallo, lettuce and avocado slices. it was delicious. steep price $8.50 that and the fact that they dont make their sopes fresh are the only reasons for not rating 4 or 5 stars. sincerly $7 is even to pricey. which is a price I'v reluctantly paid at a few other places. it really should be $4 or $5 dollars."},{"name":"Kabsah","address":"9436 S Orange Blossom Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I was visiting Orlando with my family and we came across this place.

Unfortunately when we ordered, I agreed to split my mac and cheese with my wife and she would split her rawvioli with me.The rawvioli was pretty pathetic. I'm not trying to be mean...

Oh, and some pesto.\\nWe both felt like it was a major rip off. And both of us have had raw food and really like raw food, so that's not the issue. It was like a really small appetizer.

Sadly, it was such a bad experience that would never recommend anyone go here or will I EVER come back. Here's why:1. Never have a seating area that's right next to food pick up and waitstaff! EVER! I couldn't eat or focus on the ramen, for taste and quality.  (I'm a food critic and reviewer, so I take my food serious)\\n2. In conjunction with above comment, having being sat literally next to food pick up counter...I over heard staff talking rudely/gossiping about customers several times. Unprofessional! Very unprofessional! Save your gossip for after closing.....I was so thrown back by what the waitstaff were saying, that I'm surprised this place is still up and running. Management, you need to address this a no no or be fired if you hear or read a review about it.....did you think I couldn't HEAR YOU! \\n3. The ramen was on par with (harsh as is sounds, being that I have been to japan and visited several ramen houses) Cup-a-noodles! Over salted, over seasoned, and too many artificial flavors. \\n4. My silverware was dirty and had food particles on them! Gross! For a restaurant that values cleanliness, it sure didn't show. Asking for clean silver by waitstaff, was like asking a pouty child to eat his vegetables. \\n5. Waitstaff: Don't tip them if they seriously didn't provide a good or interactive experience. Cause I surely do not tip if my waiter/staff are rude and give a bad experience. The waiter had asked if I was ready to order and when I said, \\"not quite\\" he said, \\"ok\\" and immediately walked away in a fed up kind of attitude. Didn't even let me finish my sentence. Overall: I will never come here again. It's trendy, overcrowded, over seasoned food, rude waitstaff, and I have had better ramen at other Portland establishments. Just don't waste your money hear if you legit want a great experience for a Japanese Ramen House. This place is like going to a food chain of fast food restaurants. Not impressed whatsoever.

I got the ramen with soft boiled egg because I've had bad luck with ramen-eggs in the PNW. Can't I get a properly done hanjuku egg in Portland?! The answer so far is no, and this is no exception. The tiny bowl was ok, but nothing really incredible.Overall, I'd have to give this place a solid, just ok.

The food is definitely a few steps up from food court dining, but it's mediocre Mediterranean for the price.  The food is way over priced, given the nearest seating for your meal is next to American Deli Express.I ordered the Vegetarian Sampler; baba ghanoush, hummus, puffy pita, Greek salad, falafel, and dolmates.  The cashier also gave me some homemade hot sauce- really good.For $8.99 the size was just too small.  The Greek salad was soaked in oil, but it was fresh.  The dolmates were standard, as were the hummus and baba ghanoush.  The falafel was tasty and crisp and rolled in sesame seeds.  There was no tahini sauce or yogurt dip for the falafel... come on, you know Americans like to dip! I gave the 4th star for 2 reasons- the service and the freshness.  The cashier was such a sweet employee, very attentive and helpful.  Everyone that worked their had all hands on deck to make sure the food was fresh- which is key is cooking falafel.Overall- good food, no complaints on flavor or freshness.  Not the best, and therefore they should adjust the pricing; I can't imagine that renting a space at the very last space in NorthLake Mall Food Court warrants those prices.I like this place, I like the people, and I will be back when I am in the area."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Definitely worth the wait.

They both greeted us right away and was quite pleasant. We first ordered the calamari and kale salad (because we still weren't sure whether we wanted to stay for dinner). But then I saw the review of the country lamb and decided to stay, and good thing we did. The dish was a shareable so we just ordered the one, and good thing too because it was MASSIVE. so flavourful!!! Meat was gal off the bone goodness!! The rice, potatoes and veggies tasted like it was cooked in the lamb fat it was delish! (I don't normally eat too much rice but I swear I finished the rice that night). Oh and the guys from the front, when he came to let us know our table was ready - was super nice to us - so I think he was just having a moment when we first encountered him - we ended up just staying at the bar anyway.

It's your typical Americanized Chinese buffet/take-out place. The very front of the entrance smelled like mothballs, which was a bit of a turnoff.

Although I was quoted a 10 minute wait time, the food came out in about 5. Nice. The lunch combo comes with a ton of food. Here is the rundown:\\nSesame chicken - Not my favorite. There was too much garlic in it. However, the menu they placed in my bag claims they use white meat chicken only. And it seems that claim is legitimate. Which was pretty cool. I hate sesame \\"chicken\\" that is nothing but fatty bits. However, I only ate half my food, so maybe I only ate the good pieces. We'll find out tomorrow...Egg roll - Not bad. It didn't have that weird chemical taste some egg rolls have. Crab rangoon - This was pretty good. The filling was a bit meager, but it actually had taste to it! Egg drop soup - Soooo disappointed. Lacked in salt, so I added a bit of soy sauce from the accompanying packet. No change. I put a few drops of the soy sauce onto my spoon and sampled. It tasted like ass. And I was too lazy to walk to the break room for salt. So I had my soup bland. Oh well. Also, it comes with the wide, flat crunchy noodley things, not the thin circular kind. \\nCome to find out those packets of \\"soy sauce\\" (you know, the kind every Chinese take-out place uses) contain just water, salt, vegetable protein, corn syrup, caramel color, and 1/10 of 1% of sodium benzoate (preservative).

So I've made the rounds. And there are a lot of good sandwiches to be had, but Sam LaGrassa's has the best ones, easily. I'm talking the kinds of sandwiches that get you really unreasonably excited about the meal you just had, to the point that you become free publicity by recommending them to everyone to meet. Friends, roommates, people on the street. Family who live out of state. Everyone.I can't say much about the restaurant itself, as I've only done delivery. I can say that their deliveries are prompt, the food is hot when it gets here (mmmm toasted sandwiches), and the delivery guys are always friendly. The quality of their ingredients really shows; everything always tastes fresh and delicious, and even if the meal I have is big, I never walk away feeling like I just stuffed myself with grease and processed meat and cheese product.My favorite sandwich so far is the Triple Club, but you should be warned: it's huge. Like two days of lunch huge. Maybe three, if you ordered a side. It's ham, turkey, roast beef, and bacon on toasted rye with lettuce, tomato, cheese, and Russian dressing. It ended up being so big that I had to turn each half into two open-faced sandwiches just to fit it in my mouth. Still awesome.A few last highlights: their selection of sandwich breads and rolls is great. The pickles are amaaaaaaaaaazing. And the potato salad...I could order just that for my meal and be happy. It's the perfect combination of flavors and textures; not too sweet, not too tangy, potatoes are not overcooked (don't you just hate it when potato salad turns into weirdly flavored mashed potatoes?) or undercooked (raw potato, ewww).Just eat here.

For appetizers, we chose the vegetable spring rolls and steamed vegetable dumplings.  For entrees, the lunch shrimp with a ginger scallion sauce and the healthy spicy chicken, both with a side of brown rice.   Our appetizers arrived in a fair amount of time, 6 steamed dumplings served with a dark (soy?) sauce.  We didn't care much for the sauce and the only vegetable that was noticeable to me were the edamame.  The two fried spring rolls came with two sauces:  a sweet/sour sauce and a mustard based sauce.  We preferred the sweet over the mustard and the cabbage was the most noticeable vegetable to me in the spring rolls.  Both were good, light.Our entrees came shortly ... there were approximately 10 medium shrimp in our shrimp dish and the ginger in the sauce was definitely noticeable.  The chicken was disappointing as it was described as \\"spicy\\" but we did not detect any spice but did come with ample pea pods and carrot slices.  The brown rice is a bit on the mushy side (great for me but not for my friend).  We preferred the shrimp over the chicken.When the tab arrived, we were charged for the dinner portion of the shrimp and my friend asked the waitress whether we received the lunch or dinner portion and we thoughts she said lunch.  She took our groupon and returned with the tab having only deducted the value of the groupon and did not address the price difference between the dinner and lunch charge for the shrimp.  Rather than heckle over the difference, we just settled our tab and left.     A good meal experience but would probably not go out of our way to return."},{"name":"Clay Oven Indian Cuisine","address":"7696 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"The service was TERRIBLE...

The tempeh reuben has her delicious cashew cheese, home-made 1000 island dressing, tempeh strips, and sauerkraut. It is divine! The cold cut sandwich is an impressive creation: home-made vegan pepperoni, cheddar, and turkey with pepperoncinis. I don't know how she does it.

It came with whirly pasta in lue of elbow which was a nice change, but the cream was weak and runny. There was little cheese taste and the lobster was breaded a notch too much. There are better versions for less at various pubs in the short north. --Offers a wide range of drinks especially cocktails and wine.

The quadilla is my favorite of the two; melted cheese with steak, onions, and peppers wrapped up in a tortilla shell. Also the guac is really good here chunky goodness and a bit of cilantro mixed in.

For food I ordered the: chicken wings and Kung Op Wun Sen to share.\\n1. Chicken wings: Exploding with flavor; however, I felt like it was too much aka too salty to the point that it was overwhelming. I also wish the chicken wings were a little more fried. \\n2. Kung Op Wun Sen: Big prawns and pork belly with glass noodles in a clay pot. The prawns are admittedly large; however, the pork belly was scarce. I actually felt that this dish lacked a little in flavor, but it could have been because I ate it after the chicken wings which were very strong. I did enjoy the spicy lime sauce that came on the side for the prawns and ended up using that to sauce up the noodles a bit.Overall, I enjoyed my time and think the staff is lovely.

The BBQ was tasty and the spicy dishes have some heat to them. I love all the sides you get! The choices are good and it includes rice so feel free to ask for more at no charge to you. We also ordered steamed dumplings for a starter which is a good idea since it takes some time to get the heat going and the BBQ to cook. The cooking is right in the table on a very hot surface done by the staff. They have very late hours also for the night owls so have fun and enjoy. The decor is like early 70's so if you love puke green or the 70's plastic look this decor is for you. They could really use to remodel but I guess that will not happen?

My favorites included the pesto eggs, massive fruit bowl, custom cream cheeses (maple ftw), slow roasted pork, pigs in a blanket, eggs in a basket, and the entire dessert tray less the disgusting bread pudding.Everything that was awesome melted in your mouth more than salivating over the latest release on naughtyamerica. You practically wanted to bitchslap Paula Deen for the terrible chicken fried whatchamacallit and then make out with her for the fluffy and moist eggs, the brown sugar laden cinnamon rolls, and less I forget ooztastic and decadent broccoli and rice mash.I highly recommend turning off the Food Network and giving this place some love on a Sunday morning.

The cr√™pes here are really good and not very expensive.  Plus the cr√™pes are Buckwheat which seems to be different from the norm.I came over here for lunch today as I had read an article about it in one of the papers within the last few weeks and lo and behold cr√™pes have been on my mind since.  I took a table outside on this sunny day (apparently people don't sit outside and there will be more on that later in this review) and took a look at the menu.  I ended up ordering the Goat Fig Pig ($7.50) cr√™pe which had goat cheese, marsala soaked figs and prosciutto and comes topped with cr√®me fra√Æche.  Phenomenal combination of flavors.  I'm not even a fig fan, but marsala soaked?  How could I not love these?  Goat cheese and prosciutto?  Sign me up.Back to my seating situation.  I walked in and asked if I could sit outside.  They said that I could and that I could order and be served outside.  Easy enough.  I took a table outside and was immediately brought a menu, silverware and a glass of water.  That was the last I saw of my server for a good 20 minutes.  They finally came out and told me they had forgotten about me.  I guess people really don't sit outside even though they have 2 tables out front.  I honestly wasn't in any kind of rush.  Had a book and the people watching along Belmont to occupy my time.  They brought me out a pastry on the house with my cr√™pe and that was very nice of them.

And perhaps for that reason, I'm going to go back to Regional Grill and Bayou for another meal, in hopes of improvement. I will update accordingly when that happens, but in the meantime I can only base my review on this experience.I will say that the entire staff (at least everyone we spoke to while we were there) was friendly, gracious and helpful.  That was definitely a highlight of the visit. The restaurant itself is sparsely decorated and somewhat plain (why are some other reviewers talking about the great d√©cor, did we go to the same place?), but I'm not one to put much weight on something like that.Where it fell apart for us was the meal itself. First of all, I'm not in love with the idea that if you want a po'boy sandwich, you only have one size option, and it's 22 inches (!) and costs $18.  Since I was with my wife, we were able to comfortably split one.  That's fine, but what if I came in on my own at some point, or what if we didn't happen to want the same thing? It seems like it's unnecessarily limiting what you can realistically order.Anyway, as luck would have it we both wanted to try the Bourbon Street Po'Boy, an interesting sandwich which according to the menu consists of \\"marinated lobster, crawfish, shrimp, saut√©ed vegetables and Monterrey jack cheese wrapped in a light, crisp, shell, flat grilled\\" on the 22\\" baguette.  Basically, it's a seafood crepe on a baguette with lettuce and tomato on it.  I had hoped for some good seafood in there, but nothing stood out past the SALT, wow! I mean seriously!  To quote Philip J. Fry, \\"That's the saltiest thing I ever tasted, and I once ate a big heaping bowl of salt!\\" We didn't care for the tiny, low grade shrimp in there either, but it was secondary to the insane sodium levels.The sandwich was topped off (literally, which proved to be a logistical challenge, see photo) with the mound of \\"Bayou Strings\\" that we had requested as the side. They were supposed to be fried onion straws, but were cut so insanely, unbelievably thin that they didn't have the slightest hint of onion, they were difficult to eat, got cold instantly, and basically just tasted like a ball of fryer grease.  We both gave up on them quickly.So next time (and yes, there will be a next time) I'll order something different.  I hope the Bourbon Street Po'Boy is just their big weakness, and I was unlucky enough to pick the one problem child of the bunch."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We went at 10pm on a Thursday  and sat at the bar.

I should have just ordered the fried chicken. But the hashbrowns, oh the hashbrowns. I could sing praises about those for days. Those were delicious. Evenly fried and seasoned well. I could not stop eating them even after I was completely stuffed. I barely touched my grits cause I was so full. This is your typical diner food, but it seemed not as greasy.

I added avocado to make it even more awesome, but it would have been good without it too. All the ingredients were super fresh. My friend got the Adventurer bowl which had quinoa, brown rice, kale, beets, broccoli, almonds, and cheese and it was phenomenal. I would have never thought to order that since I firmly believe that beets taste like dirt and are not meant to be eaten, but the flavors really complemented one another. I would order it, despite the beets. However, there are so many things that I want to try here that I don't know when I'll get around to it.I really like that they offer half sizes too for $5-6. The full-size portions are around $9-10, which is a little steep, but not outrageous considering most lunch places in the area and everything was so fresh and good that I think it's definitely worth it.

Neither of us could finish everything on our plates, and I must say that the food was absolutely, wonderfully, amazingly delicious.  The service is worth noting, as well - our waitress was extremely friendly and attentive, happily explaining some of the menu options to us - a pair of very-non-Greek boys who were eager to try something new and exciting.  She also promptly refilled our soda countless times, and we never had to ask for our refills - not even once.The second time we went, my boyfriend got a chicken kabob, which was one of the daily dinner specials.  It consisted of tender chunks of delicious, seasoned chicken, rice pilaf, and a heaping mound of vibrant-looking roasted vegetables.  I ordered the grape leaves as an entree, and I was thrilled with what was delivered to the table - two bulging, fist-sized grape leaves, stuffed with perfectly-seasoned ground beef and rice and drenched in a tangy lemon sauce, with some tasty rice pilaf and asparagus on the side.Both times, we left for under $40 INCLUDING the tip.  Normally, this would be toward the top of my typical restaurant price range - but the huge portions and the quality of the food make the extra cost totally worth it.So why not 5 stars?  In all honesty, the guy at the front desk who seats people always seems just a little grumpy... not mean or anything, just not really friendly.  Also, the last time we went, the service was still really friendly and generally efficient, but they all seemed just a little bit over-stretched.  The tension between all of the servers was palpable, like maybe there were a few sick calls from their co-workers or maybe just more customers than they would normally expect at that time of day.All in all, this is a GREAT choice for someone who's looking for a local restaurant with delicious food, large portions, and a classy-casual atmosphere."},{"name":"Cask'n Flagon","address":"62 Brookline Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Good staple bar to watch games.

Here's my story\\nI read the reviews that were mixed, I had also seen the pictures on this company's Facebook page. It was Black Owned (trying to support my people) I could not wait to visit this place. \\nDrove from Atlanta to Decatur (20 miles). I drove right passed this place. It's located in a small house. The only reason I knew it was the place because I saw all the people and cars trying to get in. So don't look to have easy access to parking. Ok I already knew that there would be a wait...ok not surprised. After standing outside in line until I reached inside It took me 30 mins. There are no bathroom facilities and no where to eat because this place is a tiny house on the side of the  road. The prices were pretty reasonable for seafood. Once my order was taken I waited and waited. I left and took my son to get something to eat at Mc Donald's. Went inside and waited some more. I'm asking the people who were in line with me what was the hold up? They didn't knowÔøΩ?either and was becoming frustrated. I waited 2 whole hrs before they finally called my number. \\nWhen I got my food it was COLD! Pissed but since I waited so long and drove so far I went home microwaved it and enjoyed it.2 months passed I decided to give them another try, thinking that because it's a Thursday and not the weekend, because I was told I would get my food faster.  I said ok maybe it would be hot this time. So stood in a way shorter line for about 10 mins and  I placed my order. And waited 45 mins after my order was placed before I got my food.

The reviews for Island Creek Oyster Bar were good so we decided to go for dinner. However, I was highly disappointed in this restaurant. First, the menu here is very limited. They only had two salads available as well as a small handful of appetizers and entrees to go along with their cold bar. I can understand having a limited menu if the food is very good or you have a strict requirement towards having fresh food, but for me neither of those were true. First, I started off with the shrimp cocktail from the cold bar and it was absolutely disgusting. I got 4 pieces of small, tasteless and slimy shrimp for $14. Not only was the actual shrimp horrible, but the cocktail sauce was even worse. It was watery and tasted like vinegar. I expect a great shrimp cocktail from a seafood restaurant, but I had the absolute worst shrimp cocktail I have ever had at Island Creek Oyster Bar.I was also interested in getting some scallops, but when I asked if they had them the server told me they did not. How is it possible a seafood restaurant does not have scallops? That's like a Steakhouse not having steak.I thought Island Creek Oyster Bar couldn't serve anything worse than that disgusting shrimp cocktail, but they did. I got the hamburger for my entree topped with some tomatoes and it came out as cold as ice. It was disgraceful that this restaurant served me a hamburger that wasn't even lukewarm, but freezing cold. I ended up sending my burger back and it came back warm. My French fries were also very cold and had to be heated up. Once the burger was warm, I was able to enjoy it and it was cooked well, but I wasn't in love with the seasoning. The burger itself was above average, but nothing amazing. Finally, I had the fried dough for dessert, which was pretty much just a couple of balls of funnel cake. However, for $10 I expect much more. The fried dough had some powder sugar on top, but that was it. I think something like whipped cream, chocolate chips or chocolate sauce should also be on top. Finally, some ice cream should also be given for that price. I could go to a fair and get a funnel cake for half the price and it would be just as good if not better. Altogether, I was highly disappointed in Island Creek Oyster Bar. The menu is confusing to read and limited  and the food is horrible and overpriced. I would not return."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Oysters were delicious, wait staff was thoughtful and attentive.

Wings Over's offers super tasty and tender wings, and has a great selection of flavors. It seems that many people on here have had delivery issues. I can speak to one slow experience where it took about an hour for my delivery to arrive, but that was during an NFL playoff game when they were probably busy. My advice: Go and pick-up your order if you can. Every time I have picked up my order, my food has been ready when I arrived.Tip: Go for the boneless wings unless you really love the bone-in wings. Reason being is they don't give you a ton of wings for your money, so you're better off getting boneless to maximize your value. Another Tip: Ask for extra sauce on your wings. Sometimes they will skimp on the sauce so it is best to ask for more.Can't go wrong with the Honey Mustard (favorite flavor) or Honey BBQ flavors. If you prefer a bit of spice, go for the Cruising Altitude (2nd hottest buffalo flavor)."},{"name":"Kevin Rathbun Steak","address":"154 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The wagyu carpaccio was one of the top 5 things I've ever eaten in my life.

Let's begin...Ambiance: Not much.. like a nice Dairy Queen with very cute Thai waitresses.Food:  If you want to know how much places are over priced for very good Thai food than come there.  I got the Cheese egg rolls to start.  These were basically the best crab wontons you ever have had.  Wonderful little eggrolls that were super crispy and filled with cr√®me cheese, scallions, and shrimp.  Light on the shrimp... but they were $3 for 3 so you can't complain.  Main course:  I ventured from traditional and got the Snapper Red Curry.  Fried Snapper.  But not like usual....  It was fried on the meat side and pan seared on the skin side to give you the crispy fish skin.  Best of both worlds.  Juicy meat with crispy skin.  This was accompanied by a variety of veggies and very fresh very flavorful basil.  Red Curry was amazing.  Only knock would be I asked for spicy and got medium at best. Price:  Are you freaking kidding me?  I got a filet of Red Snapper with Curry, Iced Tea, a salad to start, and an appetizer for..... $18?! Uh yeah... I will be back tomorrow or the next day to try the basil chicken.All in all...  place is great food.

Once we ordered our food, the sushi chef got our order wrong and it had to be remade; it didn't take that long though. The sushi chef was talking on the phone the entire time and that is probably why he messed up our order. I found the menu to be a tad overpriced as well.

The delivery service is incredibly efficient if you want to order wings for a gathering before a big game.  I have used the online ordering system several times before. Within a half hour the wings are usually at my place.  Pretty good as far as I am concerned.I cannot really vouch for any of their 20 something flavors other than the medium hot sauce.  I don't like to get funky with my sauce, but the wings were of good size and very meaty.  Size and quantity of meat rule any day over variety of sauces, in my opinion. I once got an order of waffle fries from here that were terrific.  Usually when you order fries from a takeout joint they arrive all soggy due to the steam from the takeout container.  But somehow these guys managed to keep the fries nice and crispy - I definitely appreciated that.One thing I absolutely cannot recommend are their wraps.  They are poorly constructed and simply not worth your time.  If you have a bag of tortillas and some lettuce at home, grab an order of boneless wings and wrap it yourself.

After we sent back the wings for the hair incident mind you.1 star deducted for not even offering a comp for the hair or the bad service, especially with prices that high I expected a little more than an apology and an assurance that they were definitely going to bring out new made wings and not just take out the hair...ummm thanks?To give a little more of an insight I have been in the service industry for over 5 years, I know people are human, things happen but I don't care how friendly I sent the food back or said my meal was fine afterwards I at least expect to get the wings taken off my bill or offered something in exchange, I feel that should be policy. I hate when people blow things out of proportion at a restaurant but those seem to be the only attitudes that yield results. If I would have made a big scene embarrassing the waitress and everyone around and demanded my money back I'm sure it would have happened but that's just not how I feel it should be done.

There's a little coffee shop inside Powell's and while it's not the best it is a pretty good spot to study, start reading the books you've purchased, or chat with a friend.

Seating was available, but quickly filled up around dinner time.SERVICE: was great! They kept coming over to fill out waters. \\nMENU: really extensive! Lots of options...definitely wished they organized it better by poultry and noodles or something. \\nPRICING: a bit on the higher end- I would think family style dishes are cheaper, since you are expected to order more.

This goes really well over rice, so definitely get a bowl or two!\\n-1 Really salty...again. 3) Khao Soi Neua (beef curry noodle soup) $15.75 //\\n+/-1 Comes with a bunch of toppings/add-ons on the side. It didn't really enhance that much, but it was fun to mix-in.\\n+1 I love these types of noodles! Just my bias.\\n-1 A bit more creamy because of the coconut, and not enough curry flavor.

Luckily, payment was being made with a gift certificate, or numerous complaints would have been lodged before we left. I know a number of people who frequented the restaurant years ago and loved it, but it appears to have gone downhill since these 'glory years.' The meal began with mediocre bread sticks and oil dipping sauce. Neither the bread nor the sauce afforded much taste. The appetizer was fried calamari: the batter was bland, though the calamari was tender and not over cooked. Next out were the salads- drenched in dressing and completed with overripe tomatoes. Our entrees (chicken francese and veal saltimbocca) were not only presented poorly, they were badly cooked. The chicken was battered in the same bland batter as the calamari and tasted very floury and undercooked, though the chicken was fully cooked. In addition, the veal was tough (even with the thorough beating we could hear it taking from the kitchen) and salty. Both entrees were accompanied by undercooked veggies (the best part of the entire meal by far) and garlic mashed potatoes that tasted suspiciously like the potato flakes found in a box at the supermarket.

So if this happened to you, you should still go.My first time going I ended up getting the Bacon and Egg sandwich. Let me tell you. This is the the best Bacon and Egg sandwich you will eat. It comes really hot and fresh. All the ingredients taste premium. And they put this mustard type sauce on there that is to die for. I immodestly had to order another one when I finished my first. Now everyone I gotta get two because one isn't enough. I also got to try their cinnamon roll. And I'm the biggest critic when it comes to this. I want warm and gooey inside. This cinnamon roll did not meet my criteria. However it was ok. It had a cream cheese icing I believe. And the Dough or bread had like that homemade yeast flavor that is really nice. And even though they were room temperature they weren't old or stale.The place is very nice on the inside. When you walk in you see the serving counter in the middle of the place and the seating around it. It's kinda hipster'y, and modern. Everything is good order and looks nice. The place is also very well lit with natural lighting which is nice. Overall this place is a very good place. I've only had the egg sandwich and the Cinnamon roll.

It was crispy on the outside and tender inside, perfectly seasoned with just enough kick to make it interesting. Also got the spicy white wine that was on special. Really liked the concept that the server brought the bottle of wine over and allowed you to taste it as if you bought the bottle even when you just ordered a glass, very classy!!!Prices are high, but what I expected. $11-16 a glass for wine, $25-30 for seafood entree, $2.50/oyster Great for a date or special occasion."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"If I lived nearby, had a house with shelves, and had a lot of money to spend on books, I'd come here frequently.

Recently, I tried their \\"rare\\" Bone-In Filet Mignon. Believe it or not, it was not nearly as tasty as my fianc√©'s standard Filet. I actually had to add salt and pepper to season the meat. For some reason, the bone did not contribute much flavor. It also made the filet hard to fully eat, which was disappointing. The sides at Morton's are ala carte and are normally very good. The potatoes are excellent, regardless of your preparation choice, and the other options are good too. I am partial to their Caesar salad as well. Morton's wine list is extensive and, though pricy, it is nearly a must to have a bottle during a meal. The service is top notch. My only complaint is the restaurant is just too dark.

It's served on a warm, amazing roll that would be a treat in and of itself, but then it also has a dijon aioli, lightly fluffy egg and great strips of bacon to make it filling, light, crisp and delicious.

We stayed basic for this first trip with regular beef and chicken. For sides we got fries, which are sliced in rounds, and a half and half order of onion rings and sweet potato fries. The food came out within 10 minutes and the service was friendly. For the record I am a burger guy through and through but the cowboy style chicken slider was my favorite. It was tender, juicy and delicious. The burger were good as well but there was something about that chicken.  The fries were good but may take some getting used to for some since they aren't the shoestring type and can get soggy pretty quick.

This means don't feel like you have to go all the way to Lake Mary for this kind experience.  Today I tried the Lake Mary location.What I can say is that the food taste and quality is consistent between the two restaurants which is always a good thing in a chain.   Normally I avoid chains unless they have something I really like, but this is a local chain, so passes in that respect.  Another non chain feature in Fuji, is that each location is different and not cookie cutters precedented by McDonald's etc.To the point, the Lake Mary location is much nicer and cleaner looking than the Winter Park location which is more rustic.  The food was OK (I had the sushi sampler lunch meal), and I would go back for that and the fact that it fills a void that has not been filled in the area for Sushi (Osaka - dirty, Amura - pricey).  The lunch prices are moderate enough that it can be done frequently.    My one gauge between different Sushi places is the Spicy Tuna, which was actually not spicy at all (hence the missing star).Other than that the staff and management were extremely friendly, to the point that the waitress invited me to her house for her own version of Japanese curry........J/K......she's a friend.

It was a casual dining experience in downtown Boulder when you really didn't want to go all out. There were a couple of hiccups in the beginning, like finding out when we got home that they had forgotten one of our dishes and it was a 15 minute trip back down to retrieve it. Lately though it's moved beyond opening hiccups to full on mayhem. Recently they were closed at night because they didn't have enough staff. When they did open back up, it was with a skeleton crew so had to wait for a very very very long time while one girl tried to handle phones, cashier, make food, serve food, etc. The food being cooked now is a lot different than it was in the beginning. Fried chicken balls seemed a little uncooked. You can tell they don't have professional cooks making the food anymore. Every time I am in now, the employees seem overwhelmed. You get the feeling they may not treat or pay their employees all that well and many have quit so they're having a hard time running the place. Of course, since it's Boulder there is an option to donate to EFAA and feel good about yourself. I say pay your employees more money so they can afford to pay rent and buy food themselves. Maybe then some of them will stick around and do their job and customers will be happy. All together too bad as it seems like they made a significant investment in the decor and menu and then they're trying to make it up by cutting back on labor. Too bad as there needs to be more casual dining options downtown. I remember when Heidi's opened a couple of doors down about five years back. They made the same mistake-had wonky, unreliable hours because of staff issues as well as running out of food. Boulder is such a small town that even when Heidi's tried to get their act together later, it was too late. People had stopped coming in. Once customers have had a bad experience, they are unlikely to return. On the other hand...Yo Ma Ma's never blows it and will do just fine for me from now on.

We opted for the dining room, and our request for a booth was met.   Our server came to our table a minute or two later and was so friendly!    She brought the free chips and salsa, then took our drink orders, and asked if we wanted queso for the chips (we said yes).  I mentioned that we were celebrating hubby's birthday, and she said \\"save room for dessert.\\"  She brought our drinks back, the queso, and my additional request for the Creamy Jalapeno sauce (this is a must, folks) and we placed our orders.  Hubby ordered the Big As Yo Face Burrito, and I ordered the Crispy Tacos (with ground beef).   The food came out in a decent amount of time and presented well.   The tacos were very tasty as were the accompanying rice and beans.   The only issue I had was the only bottled hot sauce is Tabasco, of which I am not a fan; however, the server did bring out some house made green salsas that were very tasty.When we finished our meal, our server brought out a basket of two Sopapillas with a side of honey for hubby's birthday dessert.

It shares the same space as the Garfield Library, which is cool and noteworthy in itself, and it's about the same size, which means the Garfield Library is 'cozy'. I loved walking into the tiny library, then immediately turning left to go to the restaurant. You also walk through the library to go to the rest rooms and it's a pleasant stroll through the stacks. Four of us visited en route to the Jaws on the Water Alamo event a couple weeks ago and as much as we liked watching the movie in tubes, we spent as much time talking about how much we loved Hit the Spot. This is straight up comfort food, with a couple surprises. We sampled the catfish, the chicken fried steak, a BLT and sides, and another dish that for the life of me I can't remember although I do remember the moans of delight while eating it. and everything was so freaking good! The catfish was a huge portion, lightly battered, straight out of the fryer, and light & crispy. I'd mark it as the best I've had in Texas, which is saying a lot. The chicken fried steak was similarly light, crispy, moist and huge, with great white gravy. I won't say it's the best I've ever had in Texas, because I don't want a death cage match with every other chicken fried steak place, but I will say I've never had a better one. I had the BLT. It was on a hoagie bun, which tasted bakery fresh. The bacon was thick & crispy and plentiful, and the tomato actually tasted like a tomato, unlike the kind you buy in a grocery store. The lettuce was good, but honestly, how much can you say about lettuce? Mine came with hand battered onion rings that were gone in an instant. The Catfish came with seasoned fries that I kept poaching from ML, and everything was just plain delicious. For dessert we had strawberry crepes (one of the surprises), and pecan pie. Both were scrumptious. And the total bill was less than $60. No alcohol but even I can forego a beer for food this good.

As expected the oysters were fresh, plump, and briny. My favorite were the Wild Wellfleet, though the namesake IC oyster was a close second. The chowder seemed a bit under whelming. There were plenty of clams and bacon, but the broth was a bit thin and the potatoes were still a little raw. I think it should have cooked for another hour before it was ready to serve. After the apps, the waiter returned to take out main course orders. Strangely, the food was out in 5 minutes. Unfortunately, that meant the food was not cooked to order. The butter roasted lobster had a tough, rubbery texture and bitter flavor. Fortunately, when the server was alerted to the problem, it was quickly taken away and replaced with perfectly cooked tender, sweet lobster. The big hit was the ever popular lobster roe noodles. Big chunks of lobster, savory bites of braised short rib, flavorful pasta.

I really love the Isaan music, neon lights, and open \\"street stall\\" seating feel. I appreciated the effort to try to transport you to Thailand. Of course had to try their famous Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings. It was just okay. We found it overly salty. The serving size is pretty big (5-6 wings) so between the 2 of us, it was hard to finish. Because it was so salty I didn't want to have more than one piece (and I love chicken wings).We had this smoked eggplant salad called Yam Makheua Yao, and that was actually quite tasty. The server said that people either love or hate this dish due to the smokey flavor profile. We found it well-balanced with the tender eggplant, spicy dressing, garlic, lime. My favorite dish and great to eat with sticky rice.We also ordered the Cha Ca \\"La Vong\\" fish dish, which is their 'stab at the famous La Vong Restaurant in Hanoi, Vietnam', where I have dined at. The fish was a bit dry and I think had too much turmeric that made it too intense to eat. I think the overall theme that made the dish not well-received by us is that fact that all the dishes had too much flavor. Too salty, too much spice, too intense.

Inside, it got worse.  One vertical half was thoroughly well-done and the other half was thoroughly medium.  How does that happen?  As a steak snob, the steak was almost inedible.  I would have asked for a new one, but it was a work lunch and didn't want to make a scene about it so I just ate it as it was.  I've had better steak at Applebees!  The broccoli was steamed and unseasoned. No big deal, but nothing good about it either.The mashed potatoes tasted like it came out of a frozen instant mix.

But seriously though, $16 for wings..??Khao soi neua (beef)- muslim style. The flavor of this dish was on the sweet side, mild and not savory. It was a little too sweet for my liking. I should have probably ordered the house version since it claims to be more savory. Kaeng hang leh (pork belly & pork shoulder curry)- flavor-wise, it was quite sweet. I mean it is supposed to be sweet, but i felt it was overly sweet. This dish was very small portion-wise and not what I normally see in Thai curry (thicker, less brown sauce).Papaya pok pok- this was A-ok.

If anything, I felt the food was either too salty and/or the taste lacked the kick/\\"punch\\" that I've experienced with Thai flavors elsewhere. And I definitely prefer dining at more traditional Thai places. With almost a $15+ price point for most dishes, small portions, and nothing to write home about, Pok Pok was not worth the hype. Sadly, I can now see why the location did not survive out in LA.

Currently my favorite place is little Saigon on colonial, this place is a good alternative for when I'm craving pho but don't want to drive 30+ mins to mills50. The broth is delicious but I did not enjoy the meat, it seemed as if it had been frozen then a chunk was grabbed and placed in the soup to thaw and the flavor seemed off. They place the traditional toppings in the soup for you, unless you like all of the toppings I would suggest asking for them on the side. We asked for more basil anyway and they brought the whole plate. Their peanut sauce also does not live up to little saigons but their spring rolls are good.

To be completely fair, I think that I erred first - I ordered the # 12 meza plate (with falafel, kibbe, hummus, dolma and tabbouleh salad) instead of listening to the repressed (as of late) shawarma fiend living in my belly. After awkwardly trying to find an un-awkward space while waiting for my to-go order, I carefully carried the plastic bag containing an (unbeknownst to me) badly-closed styrofoam container to my car. Once I pulled into my carport and lifted the bag from the passenger seat I realized that quite a bit of sauce had leaked out... all over my new car's front seat! When you're in the business of serving food doused with a heavy hand of your housemade garlic sauce, it's probably a good idea to package your to-go orders more tidily!Once I sopped up the nightmare from 24th Street, I finally sat down to enjoy my meal... or, what there was of it. It was pretty disappointing to be greeted with a container overrun with parsley (oh hello, excessive amounts of tabbouleh salad!) and scant offerings of everything else. While the falafel pleased and the standout kibbe raised the bar of my otherwise underperforming meal, there just wasn't enough of a good thing to make me want to return for the supposedly specctacular shawarma.

That's where I'd put Veritas now that it's moved to its new location in downtown Columbus.  And I think it's the best restaurant - from a food standpoint -- Columbus has seen in decades.I've been dining in Columbus since 1980, and there have been some great restaurants here throughout the years, but none that I ever thought would merit more than the \\"A very good restaurant\\" statement that Michelin reserves for one star places (maybe Rich Rosendale's place might have come the closest). Frankly, I'm also not sure there's been more than maybe one two star place in Cleveland, in my experience, during that period. It's nice to finally have a place here in Columbus that moves up a notch.   I place Veritas in the \\"modernist cuisine\\" camp, as defined by Nathan Myhrvold in his work of the same name.  To me, that school includes chefs like Heston Blumenthal, Grant Achatz (Alinea), and Wily Dufresne (WD-50) (I've eaten in both of those places).  My wife and I really like that school of cooking, seeking it out whenever we travel (e.g., Tickets (Barcelona), Central (Lima, Peru), Pujol (Mexico City), Bo Innovation (Hong Kong), Marque (Sydney)). \\nFor the uninitiated, that means (i) smaller portions, (ii) unusual presentations and/or combinations of food, (iii) a general lack of large hunks of protein - i.e, if you really want a 16 oz. steak, go elsewhere; and (iv) meals served in waves of smallish dishes.  It's not for everyone, and it's probably not for every weekend.  But, when done right, as at Veritas, it challenges you to as a diner to eat and think outside the box.  For me, that's very much part of the appeal. My wife and I recently finished our seventh meal at Veritas - and the second in the Columbus location (see my prior review of the Delaware location dated 2/15/15).  The food has been moved up a notch, and the operation and setting is night and day compared to the Delaware location (not to denigrate the Delaware spot; it didn't pretend to be more than a tavern atmosphere).  Between the first meal (tasting menu) and second meal (every single dish on the a la carte menu), some highlights were:-           bacon risotto with 62  1/2 degree egg\\n-           shoulder filet, farro and curry\\n-           mushroom toast\\n-           white and dark chocolate\\n-           bucatini with shaved black trufflesThe servers are knowledgeable, and do a good job of explaining what's been placed in front of you.  The wait staff and management are attentive - they notice when you need something, and attend to it.  The chef - Josh - is present and accessible in the dining room from time to time throughout the evening.The wine list was very attractively priced (take note, Cameron Mitchell), and well selected.  And the cocktail list is very interesting - although I'm not sure I'm a fan of \\"we don't list the type of liquor\\" on the drink menu (I like gin, vodka and pisco.  I don't like whiskey.  I don't want to have to ask what's in a drink).Room for improvement: -           coffee service.  The pour over really didn't work for three persons.  It took too long, and when we finally got the coffee, it was less than hot.-           valet parking.  At least the times we've been there, there's only been one attendant.  And the garage is a fair piece away.  So, expect to wait if there's anybody else parking or having a car retrieved.-           I'd love to see more items on the menu where vegetables had the starring role (I loved the brussels sprouts on the a la carte menu).  In the tasting menu, especially, something lighter, focusing on a vegetable, would have been a nice break from the meat/starch-centric dishes (as great as they were).  Edward Lee does a nice job of that down in Louisville at 610 Magnolia.These are quibbles.  Veritas is off to a terrific start in downtown Columbus.  I have great expectations for it.  We'll be back again and again."},{"name":"Taipei 101","address":"3050 Alafaya Trl, Ste 1008","city":"Oviedo","stars":"4.5","text":"With the recent power outages from Hurricane Matthew, last weekend we found ourselves sitting in Sanford without a lot of options for food, so I went to Yelp to see what places in Orlando we could try.  I had previously bookmarked Taipei 101 because someone had sent me a photo of their braised pork belly meal, so when I ran across it again in my bookmarks list, that image crossed my mind and I just had to finally go there.The shop would be hard to locate from the road if you were just driving past, but since I found it on Yelp I was able to map to it.  The interior was a decent size, with about 6 to 8 tables that sat 2 people each, and they were glass top tables with an assortment of magazines underneath for you to read through while you waited for your food.  The decor all sang praises to Taiwan, with photos of the country and its cities covering every wall.  When we pulled up there were several people walking out with take away containers, and when we entered there was a line at the counter, so the place seems to get a good amount of business.We ordered the simmered pork belly over rice meal, which came with steamed rice with minced pork, noodles, a roasted egg and seasonal vegetables, which ended up being broccoli.  The pork was seasoned subtly, which is a nice change of pace from a lot of Asian restaurants that over do it with the sauces and flavors.  It was braised so well that it was tender enough to fall apart when you touched it with a chop stick.  The roasted egg was phenomenal, and reminded me of the eggs from the fragrant Thai soup called moo palo, one of my favorites.  The broccoli was cooked very well, and the noodles were excellent, as well.  The only thing about the dish that I did not really like was the steamed rice with minced pork, as the pork made the rice feel kinda greasy and I felt like more pork on top of the pork belly was a little overkill.From the soups and snacks menu, we ordered the spring roll and the pan fried pork dumplings.  The spring rolls were crispy on the outside and flavorful on the inside, and the sauce was sweet and spicy.  The dumplings were steamed and then fried, and their dough was just the right consistency, not too thick or thin.  The sauce that the dumplings came with had an odd taste at first, almost like ketchup, but after I warmed up to it I enjoyed it.A friend of ours came in as we were finishing up our food, so we stayed and chatted with him, trying his noodle bowl before we left.  I am unsure which noodle bowl he ordered, but it was very flavorful with just the right amount of spice.I hope to return soon to Taipei 101 and try some of their other menu items, especially the highly recommended Gua Bao.

The service is always amazing. Each server treats you wonderfully. This is a great place to go when celebrating a special event. Service is prompt. However, you are never rushed. I can spend hours in here and it feel like minutes. All of their sides are delicious. I recommend sharing sides with the table and everyone getting their own meat. We had their Japanese Bbq wagyu short rib to start (I get it every time). It comes with 4 fairly small skewers but this is some of the best meat I've tasted! Their lobster fritters are also to die for. I ordered their steak special (I can't remember what it was called) but it's the top of a ribeye with wagyu beef and without any of the fat! Definitely the best steak I've had there, although they are all delicious and wonderfully seasoned. My friend does not eat red meat so she orders fish and really enjoys it. As sides we ordered the Mac and cheese (HIGHLY recommend), scalloped sweet potatoes (would not recommend), charred jalape√±o creamed corn (HIGHLY recommend, however those I was with said it was alright but way over hyped), twice baked potato (HIGHLY recommend), creamy mashed potato (HIGHLY recommend), Parmesan fries (would recommend if you really want fries but there are far better options), and Garlic Spinach (recommend). Be aware, this place does highly season most of their food, which I love, but some people aren't a fan of that. In any case I think this resturant is a MUST try Atlanta steakhouse.

And when we travel, I always make an effort to seek out Thai restaurants. I've read and heard a lot about Pok Pok so on our trip to Portland, we made sure to check it out. We were lucky that the concierge at our hotel has an in, so we didn't have to wait in the 2 hour line. We strolled up at 7 and our table was ready. We started with the famous, or infamous, Ike's Vietnamese fish sauce wings. If there is one thing people say you must order, I've always been told it's the wings. These were only the beginning of a downward spiraling meal. The wings were overly sweet and salty. Given that we don't like things that are too sweet or too salty, we thought maybe it's just not our cup of tea and were eager to try the other dishes.Next came the Papaya Pok Pok, special corn of the night, sticky rice and jasmine rice. The papaya salad was too sweet but at least it had a kick. The sticky rice was DRY!?? How can you butcher rice in an Asian restaurant. It was horrifying. The ladies sitting next to us were so shocked they took videos to send to their friends. The jasmine rice was also dry, but not as shocking as the sticky rice. Rice is a staple in the Asian diet and to screw that up is just unacceptable. However, the one saving grace of the meal was their special corn of the night. We got it without the salty coconut milk (I still don't understand the concept of combining sweet and savory things together). It was perfectly grilled and the corn was naturally sweet.The last dish we ordered was the Kaeng Som Kung. I love kaeng som kung; it's not often you find it on the menu at Thai restaurants in the US, so when I do see it, I always order it. The cha om \\"omelette\\" was not really an omelette. It was more of an overcooked stuffed vegetable triangle. They didn't even take the center of the vegetable out so it was super stringy cha om \\"omelette.\\" Also the shrimp was not good quality and very mealy (mushy-like).I think this restaurant appeals to the Western taste -- too sweet and too salty. I would not recommend this place nor do I understand the hype surrounding it. It was a disappointing meal and I am so grateful I didn't have to wait 2 hours."},{"name":"Great Wok","address":"1181 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"3","text":"Wow.

I come here often, at least twice any time I visit Boston.

The duck is perfectly cooked, and not overly fatty. The broth definitely has spent some time cooking and it's delicious. I also love the wide noodles, as opposed to the thin rice noodles, it gives the dish so much more body. My boyfriend usually gets the Chicken Pho, so they definitely know what they're doing when it comes to their namesake.I've experimented a couple of times here, and I've never been that impressed. Since my usual order of duck is so good I thought other duck dishes would be good, but sadly no. I've had both the Lychee Duck Curry and the Tamarind Duck. The Lychee Duck was better than the Tamarind Duck. The curry at least had some flavor, but the duck was buried by the sweetness of the lychee. The Tamarind Duck was dry despite being drenched in sauce, and the vegetables had absolutely no flavor, not even salt. Both portions of duck were lacking, in my noodle soup I had about twice as much duck than I did in the other orders.I'm going to continue to come to Pho Basil, but for the pho. I don't even want to bother trying the Thai food, because as a Thai person I'd probably cry of disappointment."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"I could spend HOURS in this place!

I can't tell you how the food tasted, because my family and friends could not get past the disrespect to even begin to order food.\\n       I guess the complaints on \\"Yelp\\" are working, because no one was in there, when my party and I arrived. We waited a moment as they prepared the table for us before we sat. We were not greeted by our server. She offered no smile. She took the drink orders and delivered the drinks. I asked her for a straw as she walked away, thinking she didn't hear me. Lo and behold, she did hear me. She returned with my unwrapped straw, in her bare hands, which she then slammed into my drink with such force, that a good amount of my drink spilled out of the glass. She didn't apologize or offer a towel for clean up, she simply walked away. I looked around at my guests to see if they saw this and the looks on their faces were those of confusion. I told my sister that I didn't want to buy food from them and didn't feel welcome. She emphatically said \\"I KNOOOOWWW!!!\\" \\n      I told the waitress we were going to pay for the drinks but we didn't want to order any food. I felt bad. I thought \\"maybe it's because their foreign and don't fully understand our way of business\\". She told the manager and he starts to make statements under his breath. I said \\"excuse me sir\\" as I waved him over to our table. He angrily says \\"I'm not a dog! Don't wave at me!\\". Fair enough. That was a mistaken, well intentioned, misinterpreted gesture. As a manager though, he had the power to turn the entire situation around and win our patronage. Instead, he chose to reference me and my party as \\"You people\\" at least 3x's!! I even gave him the chance to rectify it all by asking him 3x's \\"Do you want to know why we are leaving?\\" to which he would reply furiously \\"NO!! Just leave! You people waste our time\\" I honestly thought the guy was gonna fight me. I got the feeling, he may have been mistreated earlier and had reached his breaking point, but in reading the other \\"Yelps\\" here, I just think he's simply a horrible manager and person. I've informed my co-workers at my hospital to remove their menu from the list of restaurants, and I'm also going to share my thoughts of \\"ALOHA\\" on Facebook as well.

They could just save those extra items in the menu if they just had the add on option in them, as opposed to pretty much the same dish twice.\\nWe did order the rice tempura dish that came with a miso soup, which never arrived, and when we asked about it, the waitress told us we could order one at an additional cost...

I've been to this place three times for lunch and the service is somewhat schizophrenic.The first time, the service was excellent. Perhaps it was because we were one of the only tables there as it was the Friday before Memorial Day? Regardless, the server was fairly attentive even though she didn't bring bread for the table (that had to be specifically requested). I ordered the buffalo chicken salad, a coworker ordered cobb salad, another got the hamburger, and the last one got a stir fry. They were willing to accommodate him with the stir fry and make it with all the different meats instead of just one type which was nice of them. My buffalo chicken salad was really good and the chicken perfectly fried, however it was drowning in blue cheese dressing (and I say this as a chronic overuser of dressings). The burger was a complete waste of time. It resembles a hockey puck in appearance and flavor. Cobb salad and stir fry were good.The second time, I got the buffalo chicken salad again, but ordered dressing on the side. Others got the panini of the day which they liked. However, this time the service was God awful. It was the same server we had the first time at the restaurant, though the restaurant was more crowded than previously. I'm not sure if she just forgot to put in our order, but about 30-40 minutes after ordering, she came to the table to let someone know that they only had one more crab cake for the crab cake BLT and asked which person wanted to switch their order (since we had 2 people who ordered that dish). It took that long to figure it out??? Our \\"quick lunch\\" that day turned into a 2 hour affair and we work less than a 5 minute walk from the restaurant. It wasn't that other people's food was slow because other orders came out in a reasonable length of time from the parties' arrival. I really think she just forgot to put our order in, and the restaurant wasn't even that busy. Another disappointment that day were that many of us ordered lemonade and it came out looking like watered down lemon lime Gatorade (and tasted as such). We all almost uniformly changed our drink order to Diet Coke. When it came to the table and we tasted it, it was Pepsi. Now, perhaps she thought that people wouldn't mind, but there's a big difference in the taste. One of my coworkers changed her order again to iced tea. We could tell the server was irritated, but it was partially her fault as we weren't advised beforehand.I didn't intend to return to the restaurant, but some coworkers took a group of us here about 2-3 days after the last experience I had. I ordered the panini of the day, which was a chicken bacon ranch panini with cheddar. It was very delicious and the fries were really good, too. An interesting moment came when I ordered Diet Pepsi and the server (a different woman than the previous 2 trips) asked me \\"Is Diet Coke OK?\\" Just bizarre.I might come here another day for the food (which I've generally liked), provided that I have a different waitress than I normally have.

Unfortunately, Yelp reviews misled us this time. Our dinner at MF Sushi wasn't horrible but it's also not amazing; considering the price range, I prefer Umi because the food quality/taste, & service there match the price tag in my opinion. I'm sure MF Sushi a \\"cool/hip\\" place to dine at for a lot of people but personally for the price & atmosphere, it's not worth it for me. Our dinner was slightly disappointing for a few reasons:\\n~ there's not really a waiting area;as soon as you walk in, there's the bar and 2 tables so it's super crowded if you have to wait for a table\\n~ host/manager's not exactly welcoming or friendly\\n~ most of the rolls & sushi appetizer were flavorless - all we could taste was the bland rice & not the fish inside the rolls; spicy tuna tartar appetizer was really bland\\n~ their sushi rice was just ok... the taste and texture were just not right. Not sure if it's just inconsistent or their sushi rice's always like that. \\n~ food came out in a strange order and long pauses A few items that I recommend:\\n~ avocado ball \\n~ otoro special nigiri\\n~ beef roll\\n~ green tea souffle cheese cakeBoth MF Sushi locations in Atlanta closed down a few years ago. This new location opened up in Inman Park attached to a condo building. Paid parking deck (no validation).

This strip where the restaurants are located is super cute. There's tons of restaurants, bars, shops etc - good luck finding parking, tho. We decided to give this restaurant a try based on the amazing reviews it has here on Yelp! When we got here, we were surprised at how tiny this place is. There's literally 5 tables, 1 cook, 1 server & 1 dishwasher - that's it. We waited about an hour [outside, in the freezing cold]  to be seated and it was worth every minute! The seafood served here is so fresh, the dishes are well planned and put together with love and pride. You can really tell the cook loves what he does. It is a little on the pricy side but if you're a lover of good food, it's worth it. I had the aglio olio, scallop pasta & calamari. The calamari was the most delicious & perfectly fried calamari I've ever had. The Aglio Olio with squid ink pasta was also delicious! If you're not a lover of garlic, I don't recommend this dish. The ground squid was surprisingly different but good.

Pok Pok serves typical food you'd find on the streets and pubs of Thailand. Stepping into this location literally feels like you're in another country. Go figure.Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings -- If you cruise through the photo section, you will see pages riddled with pictures of these wings. Needless to say, it's something you should definitely get if you're going to Pok Pok. At $15 a pop, I am expecting some extraordinary wings. The bar was set high but Pok Pok did not disappoint. These aren't piddly wings you get from Buffalo Wild Wings, these are actual chicken wings. For $15, you get 6 whole natural chicken wings marinated in fish sauce and sugar, deep fried, tossed in caramelized fish sauce and garlic. The flavoring is so thorough and powerful with so much sweetness oozing through. The meat itself was incredibly juicy and tender. This cannot be missed!Papaya Pok Pok -- BEWARE! Their papaya salad will literally spark flames in your mouth. It is seriously spicy so remember that before you consider ordering it. The salad consists of freshly-sliced papaya, tomatoes, long bean, thai chili, dried shrimp, peanuts, garlic, sugar, lime juice, fish sauce and tamarind. Aside from the homemade papaya salad I've had, this is easily the best version I've had thus far. It had the right amount of spice to sweet ratio. I wish I finished it but the wings had the waistband of my jeggings rolling down so I simply couldn't fit any more food in me. This location is incredibly busy and there is a typical wait list. Make sure you go there in person to put your name down as they don't take it over the phone."},{"name":"Pho Dai Viet Restaurant","address":"4279 Roswell Rd NE, Ste 206","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent pho shrimp soup and basil roll!

Whenever I'm craving Italian, I find my way to Basta because the ingredients are incredibly fresh, staff is friendly, and, as I mentioned, the prices are truly unbeatable for the generous portions and fabulous quality. It's around $6 for a good sized portion of delicious, crunchy, refreshing Caesar salad with freshly grate pecorino, and all of the pasta dishes I've tried have been similarly great (most are around $10-14). I am especially a fan of the chicken and veal parmigiana, but I've tried butternut squash ravioli and a few of the other specials over the years. Their homemade fusili is nice, and definitely tastes fresh. I usually end up getting my pasta with penne or linguine because the fusili is a bit dense for my taste, but I love that they offer homemade pasta! It's counter service, so the ambience is super low-key and casual, which just makes Basta seem even more like a hole in the wall! I've never ordered takeout from Basta, but I've seen MANY people picking up, and from the doggy bags I've taken home and reheated with delicious results, I have no doubt the takeout is also solid."},{"name":"Piazza Italia","address":"1129 NW Johnson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"YES YES YES...I can't tell you how much I love this place -- it's absolutely amazing.

Everyone working here is either family or closely connected from Italy. I like to order the spaghetti with their bolognese sauce, their pappardelle is to die for and their lasagna is amazing. They bring out fresh bread (not cheap Olive Garden breadsticks) with olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette. If you're a huge fan of Italian cooking as I am, you'll appreciate their pasta and sauces. With a wall of wine you wont be left disappointed with selection, a counter of cured meats and cheeses as well as desert. I've had take out as well, still delicious! Some of their servers could be a bit more warm -- but all in all they're great! Make a reservation before hand, especially for dinner. There is always a line, which goes to show that you will not regret coming here. Be prepared for the old timers to pass a few flirtatious hugs, glances and singing at you if you're a woman.

The most undesirable thing is the price.  These are the most overpriced tacos in Austin and certainly not the best of the best.  While I do love it, after having the previous title of ambassador of all that's Tex Mex, I know whats what and Torchys is gouging us.  We picked up about 6 tacos, guac, chips, beans and rice and it was 45 dollars.  We could have gone down the street to Chuys and sat down and had drinks and it still would have been cheaper.  I understand they gotta make money to pay the rent but I have a feeling the goodwill would come back in kind if they lowered the taco prices a bit.

Not like, but LOVE. I came here for a late lunch (around 1) and it took about 5 minutes to get into the parking lot of the restaurant. Whoever designed this road/entrance/parking lot must never have driven before or didn't understand how traffic works. Horrible to get into. There is a 2 way stop just beyond the entrance of CFA which blocks everything up and people cannot get in or out without stopping traffic. Just terrible.Once we were inside, we were greeted by friendly cashiers and asked what we would like to eat. We ordered 2 CFA sandwiches, a large fries, some grilled nuggets, their new kale/superfood salad and a DDP. (Shout out to CFA for having Diet Dr. Pepper and Coke products together! Love it!)It took about 5 min to get our food, which felt like forever as I was super hangry. We got the food and the first thing I did was take of the bun of my sandwich to put on some of the glorious CFA sauce... disappointment was what I saw. The chicken didn't even come close to covering the bread. It was probably half the size as the piece that Husband received. Oh well, I'm hungry, it'll work, I tore off the extra bread, as who just wants to eat bread with no chicken? Even though it was small, it was tasty.I dumped out my fries and asked Husband if he had stolen a lot. He said only one. I was shocked at the paltry amount of fries I received. We specifically ordered a large fries to get more... Husband asked if I wanted to complain, but I hate doing that, so we stuck with our meager amount of fries... tear! The upside: the kale salad was quite delicious. I really enjoyed it. It had a good flavor and a lot of dressing. Not sure how the amount of dressing on it kept it under the amount of calories it says (140 for a small), but ok... I'll take it. Only note about it was that for $3 the small side, whereas the fries are under $2 for a large... not sure I would buy it for the price, but tasty none the less...Overall, I was pretty disappointed with this trip to CFA, which makes me sad.

I'm not much of a book person, but I do like browsing the huge collection of books in the smaller Powell's locations when I happen upon them (like that one at that one mall and shopping center that has a yogurt place at that entrance, that has a huge selection too with similar categories)... but I really don't like being in this big main location. Whenever my book-loving friend from afar visits he drags me into this one and makes me wait for him to browse books for hours. There is something about the atmosphere that I really don't like. I think it's the cafe, and the way things are set up that it's hard to find a place to read where you have a sense of privacy. If you want to read in this one you have to accept that you're out in the open. And the cafe is always really expensive and the coffee not very good, and the receipt implies that you are supposed to tip. I don't tip for someone to press a button to dispense coffee into a cup and then hand it to me. They have novelty type drinks there too and they're all really, really bad iirc. I always try a non-coffee drink too, and it is never good.But pretty much everything else they sell besides books is also way, way overpriced and quick to break. The used book prices are okay but could be lower.But my main issue is something I can't put into words. Just the feeling... something about this place makes me nervous in a way that the other Powell's locations do not. The physical set-up is so anti-privacy ('MUSEUM of books' is a very accurate description) but simultaneously confusing and I always spend at least 20% of the time hopelessly lost."},{"name":"Raso's Grille","address":"209 Mystic Ave","city":"Medford","stars":"4","text":"Went here for the first time on a Monday night.

There were three of us and we all thought the food was good for the price.  Where they lacked was the service;  waiter and bus help seemed too young and no experience.  They asked if we wanted more water and we had not even gotten our dinner.  And the person in our party was not drinking wine & only drinking water was the one with the empty glass of water.  Just felt like they forgot about us and they weren't that busy.  We were done with our dinner they never cleared the bread basket or the bread plates even after we were served our desserts.

It's a spiritual oasis in the city. That is really how i think of it.

This happens to me ... i walk in, and order something, sit down and pick up one of the many inspiring books they have all around, and look at some beautiful people in there, who shine with a glowing energy or inner strength and calm ... and breathe ... becoming human again ... then one of the staff people brings me a plate of quinoa and kale in some delicious sauce mixture, and it nourishes my body and soul. Seriously, this place is very beautiful, with amazing attention to detail, from the counter made by an awesome carpenter artist, to the window garden of beautiful plants and stones. It's how i wish my whole life and the whole city felt. It's a sensibility and an aesthetic, and an approach to life, not just an eatery to fuel up your body so you can go-go-go and push more papers or crush more concrete depending on the color of your collar. I love this place because the people who created it have a vision and a philosophy that is counter to our poisonous modernity machine, and reminds me that i am not just a minion of capitalism, but in fact a luminous being with amazing capabilities and deserving of a life beyond production and consumption as an economic unit. Still, i wish the smoothies were $4 not $7 each  ... and i wish i could have the part that remains in the blender too, after all I paid $7 for that smoothie. Quality costs money, i know. I pay it.

The second floor has two more rooms full of books, and the top floor has one more room. New books, used books, books of all varieties. Go, browse, grab. There is not much room to sit and browse, though - there are just too many books! There is a nice coffee shop, but you can only bring five books with you. The technical bookstore, with computer, engineering, and math books is in a separate building a couple of blocks away because they ran out of space in the main building!

Actually, that's not true. I can say lots...and it's all good.While it's not necessarily in the most ideal location in town (an area I don't travel to very often, mainly because it's not close to where I live), a friend and I had heard fantastic things about this local, family-owned place, so we decided to make the trek and try it out. I mean, it's a restaurant dedicated entirely to meatballs! I already knew I would be in love.Sitting as a bookend in a little strip shopping center, the store, candidly, is not the sexiest from the outside, but once customers walk through the front door they'll find a quaint little dining room with walk-up counter service. No overwhelming personality or atmosphere, but when the food is as good as this place you kinda overlook the lack of other things.Can I just get on to the food, please?! Now the meatballs are made fresh daily, and there's a pretty extensive selection on the menu. I'm a big fan of lamb in almost any form, so I opted for the Mediterranean-grass-fed Lamb meatballs (three in total), which were accompanied with Pita Bread and Tzatziki Sauce. They were so good I literally needed just a few minutes alone with myself and them. I still think about them. And to boot, I also had a side of the White Bean Ragout, which was amazing as well. The meatballs were actually served on top of the ragout.Now, my dining partner and I noticed a table sign promoting a Mac and Cheese Explosion Ball so...duh...of course we had to try that. All I can say is a-may-zing! Mac 'n cheese with meatball baked in? Who wouldn't love that?We had an opportunity to speak with the owner of the restaurant for a few minutes - super nice fella. He's thinking of opening another location of The Meatball Shoppe sort of closer to where I personally live, which definitely got me excited.

My husband always gets the fajita quesadilla and a side of rice w/ cheese dip on top, and it is fabulous. I usually get quesadillas or enchiladas, and they are also great. Bottom line: I definitely recommend this place. The only explanation for other low ratings is that people's expectations were way out of line--it is what it is, and that is a casual Mexican place.

Cocky?  On the evidence of a recent evening at KRS, I think he might be allowed to hang his own picture. I found the ambience a little dark, to be honest.  One of those restaurants where you have to ask for a light in order to see a menu, and that's surely pretty silly.  We were there on a weekday night, and most of the diners seemed to be fat men in suits.  Predictably, it's mostly an expense account destination, but that's OK.  It's expensive.  But the food was lovely.  We shared Alaskan crab; we shared the Steak for two, which really should be called \\"steak for five\\" (we took it home and had about two more meals from it).  The steak was buttery-delicious; the crab was fresh as can be.  We had the creme brulee for dessert, which was pretty good, while the lemon tart was just meh (too bland, needs more zippy lemon).  The dessert wines were beautiful, particularly a rose-coloured Italian one; the regular wine list was a bit pricey for my liking, but that's the norm (cheapest bottle around $40).  Our waitress was brilliant -- attentive, never rushed us, never pushy.  Perfect.  We did spot The Great Man wandering around from table to table, but sadly, he never came to ours.

It is close to our house and in an area with few places to eat, we thought it would become a regular spot for drinks and dinner. Sadly, it was terrible.This bar looks nice inside, if not a little tacky (why does every single table/chair/cushion have to be plastered with the person who made them? Feels like your looking at a NASCAR racer's suit). The menu looks like it was designed by a 12 year old trying out photoshop for the first time. I get you're a Mexican restaurant, but using a little space or break between the Spanish and English is usually good practice. This is what the menu item descriptions looks like:\\nBreaded Chicken-  Pollo empanado y ligeramente frito, servido con ensalada, guacamole, arroz y frijoles refritos. Chicken breaded and lightly fried, served with salad, guacamole, rice, and refried beans.The service was down right deplorable. We got three visits total from our server. Order, food, and check, that's it. The entire time we had empty drinks, no straws, while the entire staff sat at a table and chatted. The manager being among them. Being in the food industry myself, this was shocking. Do your servers not like money? I guess so. The food was mediocre, not fantastic, not awful. The chips and salsa were the best part, they don't give you much salsa, but they give you three different types. The price for what you get is a little steep especially with no refills. All in all you're better off going to a place off westgate and william cannon in the shopping center and getting much better food for less.

The reviews for Ristorante Roma promised much; Chef owner Enrico and his lovely wife (whose name I am sadly remiss in acquiring) delivered on the promise and more.Casual and unpretentious atmosphere, fresh ingredients and homemade pasta cooked to order, and an old world approach to hospitality make this a perfect venue for the single business traveler. Despite a fairly full dining room, I was immediately shown to a deuce and made to feel very comfortable. My service was every bit as attentive (yet never overbearing) as any of the larger parties occupying the rest of the restaurant. The food was fresh, plentiful, perfectly cooked and the flavors were brilliant.I had the Gnocchi ai Quattro Formaggi; the gnocchi were perfectly cooked, and the Parmigiano, Gorgonzola, Mozzarella and Pecorino cream sauce was just perfectly balanced and executed; the flavors complemented each other without any one of the cheeses overpowering the others. And \\"creamy\\" doesn't do the texture justice...just velvety smooth from start to finish.I followed up this Primi course with a Secondi course of Filet mignon in a Cognac reduction with porcini mushrooms. Simple - fresh, tasty ingredients, perfectly executed. Such a treat to have a medium rare filet perfectly cooked.I passed on the coffee and dessert, but felt compelled to accept the complimentary glass of Porto, a very nice touch (I'm not an ascetic, after all!).I had stopped by the previous night after closing, and found Enrico and his wife sharing a drink and a smoke at a cafe table - they apologized for not being able to serve me and urged me to return.

My biggest deterrent has probably been the location, I like staying close to home and walking.  This place is located in outer-SE, not far, but not comfortably walkable.  (this is in outer-SE and is un-walkable from my house...this is probably what acted as a deterrent for so long)I went on a Sunday morning, prepared to wait...and wait I did. (the place is actually very small, despite clever camera-work making it appear larger on TV...EVERYTHING is larger on film...right? RIGHT?! *wink*)  Take a book (friends are an acceptable substitute if you got 'em)The food was WELL worth it.  I got the iconic \\"Sicilian Hash\\" with a scone.Let me say that I'm not big on mixing parmesan cheese with breakfast but...the way they do it here is...phenomenal.  The eggs were some of the best I've ever had.  I don't usually use the term \\"savory\\", but that about sums them up.  I usually douse my food in hot sauces similar to the way a domesticate raccoon does with foodstuffs...but I didn't have to here.  The food was very well seasoned.  Getting back to the eggs, they look so picture-esque (if you ever see a guy at a food joint with a big camera taking dozens of pictures of his meal...it's probably me) that you'd think they were fake...like, made by an artist for a menu or commercial.  The meat?  Well, I'll avoid spoilers and just let you taste it for yourself.The scone, delicious.  Again, I'm not big on sweets and baked goods (I'm not even sue I could describe what a \\"scone\\" is)...but this thing was great.  I'm not sure what all was in it, but it was definitely multi-dimensional.I had a very hard time picking from the menu here, I will definitely be back.  I have a feeling I picked the busiest day, I'm going to drop-in on a weekday soon.

In California, all the best Thai restaurants offer brown rice. Instead they have coconut rice.  What's up with that?!?

I waved down the delivery man from the curb, and shoveled him money in the pouring rain.He handed me a black plastic bag and I turned back towards my apartment to see the door had closed behind me.  I calmly dropped the chicken and searched for my key.  Front pocket, front pocket, back pocket, back pocket.  Nothing.  I pulled out my phone and called my roommate:\\"Hello?\\"\\n\\"Hey, are you coming home anytime soon?\\n\\"Yeah!  Well, sort of.  I'm seeing a movie in Rhode Island first.\\"\\n\\"F*ck\\"After calculating my options, which were limited,  I sat down on the stoop in front of my door, ripped open the plastic bag like Hulk Hogan devouring a t-shirt and calmly went to town on hot chicken wings like a feral animal.  Shortly after I finished, another tenant in the building came home and saw me stretched out in the staircase, mouth and hands covered in orangey goo, a bed of bones piled next to me, french fry crumbs strewn about like rice at the most depressing wedding ever.  He paused as he approached me.  \\"Hey man, are you okay?\\".   I thought about that question objectively and concluded that Wings Over Somerville, while satisfactory in every way, was definitely not worth being locked out of my house for multiple hours.  I tried to convey my complex palette of emotions to him as he stepped over my slumped body, but could only mutter \\"Keys...door...chicken\\" before he passed by.  So there you go.

We both saw this place opened up and decided to give it a try!I have to say, I am a fan, and will definitely be back.For one, our waitress was great!  She was very sweet and attentive.  She let us know about options we had that weren't on the menu (such as being able to choose more than one flavor for the Korean fried wings).  The only con was we had to ask her for the check.  Normally, this wouldn't be a big deal, but we were on lunch break, so once we finally realized we still didn't have the check, we had to wave down our waitress then wait for the check, and then wait for the card to be swiped.  She was also a little confused about paying cash and credit (she's probably new).  But, overall, good service!Two, the menu has pretty much all of my favorite Asian dishes on it!  Vietnamese summer rolls - check! Crab rangoons - check! Drunken noodles - check! Buffalo (okay, that's not really Asian haha) Korean fried chicken wings - check! Sushi - check!  I wish I worked closer so I could get food from here more often. (Then again, I don't really, because then I would just become a fat blob).Three, the prices are fair.Four, the Korean fried chicken wings are SO FRICKIN' GOOD!  They are moist on the inside and super duper crispy on the outside.  The menu does warn you that they take longer to cook than other menu items.  And it's true -- we ordered the wings with our drinks, and didn't get them until after all the other food.  But they were definitely worth the wait!  I tried the spicy and Thai BBQ wings.  I'm going to have to come back for the buffalo.  The reason I didn't get them is because I had gone to Hell Night the night before, and my stomach didn't think it could take the buffalo that day.The only real con I have is that the drunken (or drunkard, as on the menu) noodles were on the bland side.  Usually this is a spicier Thai dish, so I was a bit disappointed that it didn't have that much flavor."},{"name":"Mee Thai Restaurant","address":"1200 Lee Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"5","text":"Incredibly delicious Thai food!

If you're going to order a lot of food, I would suggest maybe waiting for a table, since it was a bit cramped at the bar.There are so many things on the menu that it is a bit overwhelming. However, each dish was followed with a pretty good description. We ordered the famous Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce wings, Khao Man Som Tam (papaya salad),  and Khao Soi Kai (curry noodle soup).Everyone raves about the wings, and upon first bite, they were so delicious! Crispy, sweet and very flavorful wings. However, after the first wing or two, the flavor became overwhelming. The fish sauce was very evident, and you definitely should order a side of rice for it. Also, we ordered spicy, and it wasn't spicy at all! The bartender said it was a medium spicy, and I typically like to eat a mild spicy. However, this didn't even taste mild to me.The papaya salad was pretty tasty. It came with coconut rice, and while I didn't taste any coconut, it was a little on the wet/soggy side. The tart papaya with the sweet shredded pork was good though.My favorite of the night was the Khao Soi! It was creamy, rich, and full of coconut curry soup. The noodles were pretty good too, and the chicken was tender.

There was a long wait, and they only take reservations for parties of 5 or more.  We killed time at Whiskey Soda Lounge.

The game hen was juicy and tender.\\n2) Papaya Pok Pok- We added salted black crab. I didn't expect to see bits of crab shell in the salad though. The crab made the salad really salty. This combined with the spiciness deterred my friends from eating more of it. It didn't deter me though, even though it made my mouth burn. \\n3) Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings- Their signature dish. Half dozen fresh whole natural chicken wings marinated in fish sauce and sugar, deep fried, tossed in caramelized Phu Quoc fish sauce and garlic. The wings were sticky and crispy.

It's all about the late-nite allyoucaneat baby.The place was recently renovated, and while the number of seats is lower (there is one less row of tables), the increased leg room and booths are greatly appreciated.So, what keeps my friends and I coming back?  Fast and consistent service + food quality.  This is no 5-star teppenyaki, but for those who love stuffing their faces, you seriously cannot go wrong.  Oh, and this places is open late (I think 2am iirc) EVERY DAY.My favourite items on the menu?  It must be the wide selection of cones (chopped scallop, negitoro, spicy salmon, spicy tuna) and the BBQ salmon skin.  Their BBQ beef ribs are also cooked just right.  Fresh and juicy.  I also enjoy their beef skewers.  They are sometimes a little dry, but no other ayce sushi place seems to offer this item.The bite-sized nigiri sushi are nothing special, but this is just the way I like them.  There's nothing like stuffing these down, a dozen at a time.  This alone is what keeps me coming back.  Another unique item found nowhere else (other ayce sushi places) is the bean sprouts.  They're served covered in sesame oil, and remind me of the appetizer dishes in Korean restaurants.Another unique feature of this restaurant is that 1 order = 1 piece.  Why do other places make you order in batches of 3?  I'm sure some other table will order the other 2/5 of that BC roll you sliced up for my order.Most times I come here, they're out of Jello, so be sure to order these early.  I can see why this happens though.  Each Jello is actually made in its own cup, as opposed to a pile of cubes mixed in a bucket and served in a bowl.  While it is a nice touch, I must say I personally prefer the latter as there is more Jello per serving, and there is more than 1 flavour per order!The staff are all pretty friendly, but this might be because they do recognize me as a regular.  With that said, I have not seen them treat any of the other tables badly, and so they do deserve a special mention.Definitely one of my all-time-favourite ayce sushi places in Vancouver.

The first one was after a friend told us he'd been dismayed to see his lasagna microwaved and then brought out to him. The second chance came after we tried to get a table and were told \\"No reservations? One hour.\\" before being walked away from. When we finally had dinner there, we sat for at least half an hour before anyone came to take a drink order, and we managed to squeeze a food order in with it in case another half hour should pass. It did. Our food arrived...before our wine. Finally, after asking after the wine, it was brought to us without apology and set next to the food. The food was fine, not great. A little too salty and cheesy for my taste. It didn't help that we were sitting next to the kitchen and got to watch the servers spooning sauce onto pasta out of a giant crusty warmer, or their giant tubs of Costco ricotta and packages of Barilla pasta. If I wanted Barilla pasta, I could make it at home and save myself the trouble of being ignored by waitstaff. The atmosphere is really nice, but not worth the service and the poor food.

I'm not one for pizza joints but was really looking forward to spending time with our friend so we happily accepted her invitation in June 2016.Clean, spacious and similar in styling to a Chili's restaurant it certainly did not have the look and feel of a pizza shop.  As the name implies there was some reference via the d√©cor to the 1960's hippy era.While the menu did have some interesting pizza combinations I was not overly excited.  I felt the prices were high and given that we were not familiar with this restaurant we were uncertain on the sizes.  Following her lead we ordered a \\"Mellowterranean\\" pizza with Greek toppings and a cool dill flavored dipping sauce.  The pizza was an ample size and had a very good crust.  It wasn't bad but wasn't the best I ever had either.  I was the only one who dipped into the dill sauce and it did provide an unexpected but pleasant flavor element and elevated the pizza up a notch but still not worthy of more than a mention.We also ordered pretzels from the appetizer menu - each getting a different flavor.  The flavor I choose was the honey version and I was very disappointed.  It was lacking both sweetness and salt.  Overall our entire table felt the pretzel dough was a little strange - I would describe it as a wheat flour base pretzel and lacked the chewy aspect of what we are used to. All three pretzels were under-salted as well.   I was disappointed and certainly would not recommend or order again.Service was a bit slow too.  We waited a bit before we were approached for drink orders and had to flag our waiter down for our check but he was friendly.Overall experience was a miss for us and we probably would not go back there again on our own but not the worst experience either."},{"name":"New Brothers Restaurant & Deli","address":"31 Maple St","city":"Danvers","stars":"4","text":"Great for lunch.

Suffice it to say that I'm impressed! First of all, delivery was very quick and friendly. Second, the food was delicious. Since the menu features some interesting items, I decided to try a mix of standard American-Chinese and more traditional Taiwanese dishes. In total I've had four dishes:*Spicy Wontons in Ginger Sauce. This turns out to be Suan La Chow Sho (sorry for the lousy transliteration!), and a good rendition at that. The spicy ginger sauce is delicious, and the dumplings were very good indeed, if a bit overcooked (though that could be because of the closed delivery container). The dish was served as is traditional, over a bed of sprouts.*Kung Pao Chicken. This was a very tasty, ginger-laden version of the dish, bearing no resemblance to the sweet/salty/spicy Sichuan version, but still spicy and tasty. Lots of chicken, peppers, celery, and peanuts, so the consistency was as great as the flavors.*Chicken with Black Bean Sauce (ordered spicy). Very tasty, with peppers and onions and lots of that wonderful salted black bean flavor. It didn't beat me about the head with salt as black bean dishes can, but was balanced and delicious.*Spicy Pork with Celery and Dried Bean Curd. This traditional Taiwanese dish was actually exceptional, and worthy of many a good sit-down restaurant. It was a bit salty for my taste, but that is pretty typical with these ingredients: Pork, dried tofu, fermented broad beans, pickled vegetables, celery, scallions, etc... Despite the salt levels brought to the show by salted and pickled ingredients, this is a delicious, complex dish that I recommend highly. There are obviously some serious skills in the kitchen here. The knife work isn't high end, but the flavors are terrific. If you want other regional Chinese fare, go elsewhere, but if you want good Taiwanese dishes and well-exeuted American-Chinese for carry-out or delivery, this is a great choice."},{"name":"Caf√© Luna","address":"612 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Luna is an unbeatable neighborhood gem and undoubtedly my favorite Cambridge spot. Meals are cooked to order, the space drips with charm, and  the menu is creative, seasonal, and lovingly crafted. The owner, Matt, has a lovely eye for detail and affectionately shepherds the hungry hordes who line up for the legendary weekend brunch. He'll occasionally stop to chat if he has a free second.The best part, of course, is the food. I've never had a miss yet: their chai is fantastic (even better dirty!), as are the beautifully presented lattes and fresh mimosas. The brunch menu offers a weekly dilemma: seasonal pumpkin french toast, a western omelette with thick-cut black forest ham, and pepper-dusted steak with perfectly poached eggs are frequent contenders. Their sandwiches are served on artisan bread next to lightly dressed green salads (try the vegetarian Florence grilled panini). The homemade chicken salad is another perennial favorite.I make it a point to steer visiting family and friends over to Luna whenever they're in town; the lines can get a bit long, but the owner is welcoming and uncannily good at fitting people in wherever possible. Warm weather means an open front patio, which is perfect for lazy people watching. There are also regular evening jazz performances--check their website for details.Tip: They'll take brunch reservations to the best of their ability; calling ahead may not guarantee you a table on the hour, but they'll accommodate you better and sooner if they know you're coming.

We started with the Farmer's Market Sangria and Skinny Margarita, both of which were perfectly refreshing! With an abundance of appetizers, it's hard to choose only a couple, but you really cannot pass on the Farmer's Market Crudites - a giant bowl of fresh veggies that taste just as amazing as they look. The Kale Guacamole is a must too! Honestly, the whole menu is a must. Believe me when I say you'll be having dinner here many, many nights after your initial visit. \\nI have always wanted to try their infamous Ancient Grain Bowl - a blend of wild rice, quinoa and other grains such as farro (not gluten free), but Nash was adamant I be able to try this amazing dish and was able to take the farro out of the blend.

It can be hard to nail down a good poke bowl, but TFK's gets a solid 11/10 rating. While you may find it hard to do, you HAVE to save room for their Rhubarb and Strawberry crumble at the end...

Church St. was closed off because of an event at the Amway, and it was raining, so it wasn't the easiest place to get to, but it was still a great time. We got there and were instantly seated, but it took a few minutes for anyone to come to our table to greet us and take a drink order. Eh, ok, there were busy-ish, I guess. Nothing that I thought couldn't be handled. Our server was friendly, but he was a bit lacking on the whole \\"serving\\" thing. Our water was refilled once the entire meal (we were there for about 2.5 hours), and that was towards the end when I asked. He forgot to put in one of our dishes that we ordered pretty early on (it finally came right before dessert!). The server was already really heavy on the sales push of desserts, which was kind of annoying when we were still waiting for a chicken dish to come out!!Service aside, the food was delicious. Everything we ordered was perfection. My absolute favorite were the green beans, hummus, and the pork dish that came with potatoes and green olives (I forget the name!). The potatoes were so tasty!! We ordered quite a bit since the tapas were discounted for Tapas Tuesday. My dad ordered a couple shell fish dishes, which he and my mom really enjoyed, but I couldn't eat them. For dessert, I had a chocolate cake that came with vanilla creme, fresh berries, and raspberry syrup, and my dad had the tres leche.The place is really loud, which was also a downside since we wanted a chance to catch up and talk since it's been a while. They did have a guitar player, which was really neat, but that was only in the bar area, and we couldn't really heat him over the noise. Overall, I'd give the food a 4 and the service a 3. I don't think I'd want to come back any other night of the week, as the dish size is pretty small (tapas!) for the price. For the three of us, it came out to $75 +tip, which was great!

If you order takeout though, they don't give you much in the way of rice or noodles for the galbi tang though which I kinda find odd. Yet they heap you plentiful amounts of kimchi.

It's a convenient area, easy to park, and we were seated quickly.Wasn't majorly impressed by the decor -- the place looks like it used to be something else and they tossed some restaurant furniture in there and called it a restaurant. It's not bad, it just doesn't blow you away decor-wise. HUGE projection tv in the dining room and a tv in the bar area makes it more of a sports bar with booths than an actual \\"restaurant\\".We sat at the table for at least ten minutes. I'm not exaggerating. Seriously... ten. Servers walked by us, busboys walk by us, nada. Finally my date gets up and asks the man at the host stand what's up. He is shocked no one has helped us yet and promises someone will be over soon. After that, I was expecting basically instant service, but no, we waited a few more minutes before our server made his way to us.When he got there, he explained that there was a miscommunication among the waiters and apologized. I can understand that -- we're all human -- but there was nothing done to remedy the fact that we sat so long we almost walked out. There definitely could have been more effort to make sure we were satisfied (even comping our salad would have been plenty!). I don't blame the waiter, but I stand by my statement.We ordered our food: pizza for me and chicken parm for him. My pizza was humongoloid and surprisingly delicious! (Think: Ronny's Place). The sauce was not too acidic (almost a vodka sauce mmmmmm). Loved it. His parm was \\"standard\\". The drinks are overpriced, IMO, especially when the price increases are hand-written over scratched-out original pricing on the menu. If you are going to charge me $10.50 for a drink, at least have it printed on the menu. I shouldn't have to pay $10.50 for a handwritten priced item off the drink menu in a sports bar in Medford. Just sayin'. We're not in the Back Bay...I would come back, but I would dress way down.

My son and I sat down and ordered and before the server left I showed her the coupon and I asked her if she wanted to redeem it now or later   She said that there was a sign by the register saying they don't accept entertainment book coupons. The sign is really small and there's no way somebody walking in here would see that sign. It wasn't on the door, it was behind the register in a direction that somebody walking in would never look. She had a gentleman come out and explain to me that they decided not to accept those coupons anymore but it was active on the app and there is no way that they should not have accepted it.  It makes me wonder how many times people have ordered their food and not mentioned the coupon until after they already ate. The man said they can only accept their own coupon which was buy one get one 50% off. Now I've been in the customer service industry for a long time and have traveled all over going to restaurants and I have never had a restaurant deny an active coupon. So I let my son order and eat his meal and I canceled mine. This type of refusal is just a classic case of greed and I will never eat here again. I advise everybody else to do the same.  It honestly only would've cost them about $2.50 beyond the buy one get one 50% off deal that they offered me. But I would have had a meal and they would have made twice the amount that I actually paid. And don't think that this review is negative only because a difference in the price. It's because it makes me wonder what other cheap shortcuts they're making back in the kitchen. If you agreed to be in a nationwide coupon book for a year you may as well honor that coupon rather than have a reputation of somebody who goes back on their word to the customer.

Seriously good boneless wings. I've never been in the store, but we have gotten delivery on a couple occasions and it's always been terrific. I know ordering online is one of those things that is driving human beings further apart.. but I loves it! haha It's so simple to order from their website and delivery is within 30 minutes (or rather it has been for me). Slash, you can even make an order for a future time/date. I was CRAVING wings one morning and they weren't open yet so I placed an order online and ::ding dong:: they made my order right after they opened and they were right on time for lunch. On top of that, their delivery guys have always been great. So onto the grub. Stick to the wings. My friend ordered a burger and it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great. The patty (which was thick) was slightly overcooked. I've gotten both sweet onion BBQ and honey BBQ boneless wings and YUM. Both were cooked just right and the meat was so tender. The sweet onion was a little tangier than I would have liked, but ya know.. you get over it. They throw the waffle fries into the container fresh out of the fryer (I'm assuming), so I think that's why they can be soggy (hot moistureyness). Go ahead and check off the \\"well done\\" box when ordering to get a crispier fry. Nothing says gluttony like cheese fries and wings. I suggest plain or ranch fries, but they have a ton of options for flavors. Also, they give you more cheese when it's just on the fries, but of course it's going to be a lil soggy. Be sure to ask for an extra container of cheese if you decide to get yo cheese on the side.  I'm not one for hot, so I get the foofy BBQ stuff, but from the looks of these reviews, it looks like they can handle those that are craving the burn of hot sauce! AND they have late night delivery. Man I wish I hated these guys. hehPS - They give you 3 small celery sticks.. so if that's your thang. Stalk up beforehand. Hah..

Since it doesn't really need another five-star review I guess I will use this space to air all the negative things about this place so that the average optimist knows what else to expect.  It's a tough job, but someone's got to do it.There seems to be a shortage of chairs and lounge areas in the city of books.  There's the art gallery benches all the way upstairs and the always-packed Gold Room all the way downstairs.  Borders and B&N are pricey and they suck selection-wise but at least there is some kind of cushioned seating.  Many people sit on the floor, which does no favors to people trying to look at books and wheel around carts without bulldozing the people down there.  Oh yeah, and that Gold Room is basically non-functioning unless you wait around stalking people for seats while holding all your books.  Seriously, this is the largest bookstore I've ever been in and I can't find a place to sit?The staff can be helpful or not.  Unfortunately, most only know what is detailed on the floor guide that you can see yourself by the customer service desks.  Selling books is also awkward here, since you will have to wait around with huge boxes of books in everyone's way.  Sometimes they don't price individually, and they make me feel like a jerk requesting it.  And yes, it is crowded bordering on circuslike sometimes.  The used book selection is really impressive, but it's not going to be Amazon, let's be real.Also, if you are driving and you can park somewhere besides the garage, do it.  The parking garage is poorly mapped out with strategically placed concrete columns that are prime for almost running into while backing out.  And yes, I am a good driver and can pull out of a parking spot with no problems normally.  Also the guy in the booth is a real prize and he makes me want to actually pay for parking rather than use the free-upon-book-purchase garage.

(we only tried the buttermilk variety)  and while the list of things you can purchase to add to your pancakes as you cook them was interesting and somewhat extensive, you get very, very little for the $1 or $1.50 or whatever it was.  i mean, what might have been a half a banana, for $1?  really?and back to the whiskey...  my cocktail ('whiskey for breakfast') was fair enough, but as with the banana phenomenon noted above, a barely decent portion for the bar price.  my friends drink, however, the toddy (i forget the cute name) was completely overwhelmed by the heavy-handed spices added.  some spice is nice but if it seems like you're sucking on a cinnamon stick, not so much...  she had to ask them to water it down.  \\nthat said, we later realized, those were some damn strong drinks.  that or the pancakes were as intoxicating.so, in summary - cute concept, very yummy pancakes, decent design, but chaotic management.  room for improvement, for sure, but not to be written off just yet.  i mean, i've yet to try an afternoon 'slappy hour', right?!

My friends laughed when I said the kale should've been massaged, but when it's not baby kale, it really needs to be softened so it is easier to consume. The spinach and apple salad with added chicken was too expensive for a fairly small portion. On one occasion, the dining room was so busy we had to eat in the market, and the owner (I think) brought out their coconut ice cream for free at the end of our meal.

We were clearly not the only ones unhappy with the choice of seating, as there was a nice couple on a sweet date constantly rolling their eyes and whispering as well.  Keep in mind, I'm not blaming the restaurant for this, AT ALL, but this place is not a bar and shouldn't be attended as one.Another party of Bride to be girls came in, much calmer, much more tolerant, except for the super drunk girl who ended up passing out in her chair at the table while the others nonchalantly ate.

I warned my partner that we'd be spending at least an hour, maybe two, in Powell's -- this was not going to be a quick in and out jaunt.  Powell's is huge, and it's a little overwhelming, especially if you're not there for anything specific and are the kind of person who can just browse bookstores for hours.  However, since I had promised my partner we'd be in there for only a couple of hours, I needed a plan, and I decided to start in the children's section, as there were a few specific children's books I was looking for. The main thing I was hoping to find was the book \\"The Gas We Pass: The Story of Farts\\".  It's a hilarious book, and I owned a copy, but some bitch stole it, and I can't find it anywhere in Vancouver.  However, I figured Powell's might have it, and sure enough they did -- three used copies for $7.95.  What a bargain! I also wanted to buy a couple of Curious George board books for my niece who'll be born in August, and while you can find Curious George books in Vancouver, none of the book stores I went to had the ones I wanted -- they were either not board books, or were crappy new Curious George books, not the original stories.  Once again, Powell's did not disappoint. I also found a children's book about constellations (something I want to learn about), by H.A. Rey, the author of Curious George, so I bought that as well (only $4.95, new). It took a lot of self control not to buy books (and other cool things), but I can get books for free from the library, and in the end, the damage was only $52, which included a $2 tote bag and the game Joking Hazard for $30, a game that my partner and I have been wanting to purchase, but is not sold in Vancouver and must be purchased online.

This was a plus since we can be a rowdier bunch. The atmosphere was cool. It looked Spanish/European with darker lit rooms, warm colors, lots of wine and Spanish-inspired paintings and decor.The menu options were pretty fantastic. I loved that they offered many traditional Spanish \\"tapas\\" or small plates. I especially enjoyed the patatas bravas and tortilla. Note: Contrary to popular belief, the popular Mexican tortilla used to make things like burritos and tacos is not this \\"tortilla.\\" A Spanish tortilla is actually more like a frittata. It's an egg-based dish and can have various meats or veggies mixed in. Many places use olive oil as well. It was yummy!I also appreciated the number of vegetarian options available. It actually surprised me for a Spanish restaurant. :-D In Spain, sometimes it's hard to find more veggie options, given how meat is such a staple food in their diet.The wine selection was also pretty good. I loved how they offered cava. My friends opted to do some kind of shared wine experience \\"Porron,\\" a Spanish wine pitcher you pour directly into your mouth.

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and I wanted some pimiento cheese spread on it. They have this type of sandwich at my favorite BBQ place in Nashville and it is bomb. Someone called me from the restaurant and said they couldn't just give me the cheese on there for free, that they would charge $5 but it was really delicious and they made it in house. I believe he was the bartender, super cool guy, the only reason this review is getting a 2 star. Even though I thought that was priced too high, I figured if it's that good I want it, no big deal. My food arrived and the sandwich was completely plain pulled pork. It was dry, not a lot of flavor, just not good. They gave me these scoop of cheese, ice cold in a side container.. not at all what I asked for. The cheese once heated was the only saving grace for the pulled pork. In addition to this, I ordered a side of Mac and cheese for $4.99. It was really a small portion for the amount they charged and again was quite flavorless although was cheesy. My favorite part of the whole meal was the pickles on the side. They were honestly the best made in house pickles I've had. Definitely would not order from here again."},{"name":"True Food Kitchen","address":"222 West Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Absolutely loved my lunch at true food kitchen!

We felt very uncomfortable, we had already checked out but to make sure there would be no problems I asked the front desk staff during check out if we were allowed in the pool area after check out and she said yes ofcourse. After about 2 hours later we decided to get out of the water and tan. Thats when we were approached by a superior and asked if we were staying on property and asked for room keys, we showed the keys and then we were asked for room number and name. We gave that too and still there was suspicion so he said he will be back after he verified the information and he was not back, he sent someone of the pool staff to say \\"You are all good\\". I was astonished that the man himself did not have to courage to come out and apologize himself for the accusation. We will never be staying here again. I later informed the front desk staff of the situation and they also did not seem to care.

Don't be starving when you get here, because if you come here at \\"getting hungry\\", you'll get to \\"omg im going to eat your arm\\" hungry waiting for a table.

I cannot speak to the sushi, but the Thai dishes are always great.  The service is very attentive and fast.  Part of the reason we go there so often is that we can always get in and out and back to work in an hour and the food is great.  The curries are very good.  They have several vegetarian lunch specials.  Lunch comes with soup included (and the coconut soup is not made with a chicken stock).  Vegetables are fresh.

Their cappuccino bundt cake will surely make my thighs expand like a microwaved marshmallow until they explode out of my jeans.  That stuff is too good.  It is truly mouthgasm material.  Unfortunately, being downtown and conserving gas (see my hypermiing page), I was lured back to this house of delicious calories.  I suggested to the photographer, John, \\"Why don't we go here?\\"  He said he eats anything.  I said I eat everything.  That works out well for the both of us.   We pulled up and parked at a meter spot on 3rd street, and proceeded to the door.  After being in a 102 degree car for three hours, we were dying for water.  Since the place was pretty empty at 3 pm, the staff was quick and efficient.  We got our popcorn, and John orders the chicken fried steak while I order the pecan crusted catfish with mac and cheese.  I haven't had mac and cheese since I was in middle school, and I've got to say that Moonshine's mac and cheese outdoes Kraft's blue box without a doubt.  Instant mac and cheese does bring back nostalgic memories, but nothing like this.  My sister shows up to say, \\"Hi!\\", but I think she really came just to eat my food.  She proceeds to grab my fork and eats off my plate.  After 5 minutes, she's eaten everything except for a piece of carrot.  After she devours my lunch, my sister tells me that some strange man outside was heckling her for money \\"for the meters.\\"  She said she ran into Moonshine to get away from him.  I did go out between the meal to add some money to our meter at 42 minutes, and I saw him.  Skinny, stinky man with a cap.  He approached.  I shot him the look I usually only reserve for unruly kids running around Wal-mart.  He backs off.  Since my sister ate all of my food, I obviously needed to order dessert.  We get the white chocolate bread pudding, and it was gigantic.  I don't usually splurge for dessert, but Houston's KPRC was paying for lunch.  The bread pudding was warm, ooey, gooey, sticky, not too sweet, and really awesome with the ice cream.  I was in heaven.  Good bye, Moonshine.  I weighed myself, and it seems that I gained 2 lbs.

So if you are looking for poached eggs, this isn't the place to go. Second of all, their drip coffee is $3 and not bottomless! What diner doesn't have bottomless coffee these days, like come on. The home fries are overdone, and their sausages are clearly basically jimmy deans, not fresh. They also don't offer any jam with their toast.

Conceptually, I love that Portland, a city I think of as a hub of intellectual curiosity, has a hugely gigantic independent bookstore in the center of the city. The hugely gigantic piece also comes in handy with selection. If they don't have it in their store, they probably have it in their warehouse, and can order if for ya. And the rows and rows and multiple stories of books, along with the periodic author/speaker visits just hits a chord with readers from PDX and beyond. It ain't your mama's Barnes and Noble. My biggest endorsement is Powell's book-buying capacity. I think they give you a really fair price on books, and they almost always accept 95% of what I bring in, including \\"Episode Guide to Season 4 of the X-Files.\\" I marvel at their capacity to pay me for so many titles, even in a recession. What I DON'T like about Powell's: It's not a place to hang out. And, shouldn't it be? The cafe is always cramped and I've developed a theory that they purposely don't have many outlets so that fewer people can take advantage of the free wifi for hours on end. It would also be nice to have some chairs to just plop down in and peruse books before you buy.

It used to be served on a forcacia roll and tossed in a liberal amount of buffalo sauce.  Can't remember the toppings; greens and tomato, along with blue cheese, I think.  This was twelve or fifteen years ago.They renamed the Buffalo Bill sandwich to \\"Buffalo Chicken Sandwich\\", just to suck any remaining fun out of the joint.  I chose to have it on wheat, and the bread was toasted, and tasted fine.  The chicken itself could have bounced, it was so rubbery.  I'm guessing, to save on cost, they moved from fresh chicken to frozen, and the taste suffered because of that.  Also, the blue cheese tasted almost like it was lite Blue Cheese, if that even exists.Anyway, I won't be back.

Usually we sit in the front bar area and it is never a problem, the food is decent and the service is on point.  However, last Friday night I went here and the front bar was full so we took some seats in the dining area in the back.  This is where everything started to go down hill.First, the service was horrible.  Like terrible.  No one even acknowledged us or came by to take our drink order till we had been sitting at the table staring at ourselves for 10 or so minutes.  When she finally came back to take our food order, 15 minutes after that, I told her that we were just going to leave and pay for the two drinks for we were not happy with how slow the service was.  Apologetically she insisted we stay and offered to get me a beer.  For some reason I agreed, I just should have taken a stand at that point and left.  For food we order the buffalo chicken tenders and a margarita pizza.  Both were bad.  The buffalo tenders were fried to the point of burnt-ness, they were all crunchy and dried out.  Def. left in the fryer way too long.  The pizza was burnt as well.  The bottom was black.  It tasted like I was eating cardboard with red sauce on it.  No flavor at all .We had to ask for everything, bread, forks, side plates for the wings, more water.  Nothing was offered to us at all.   And all the while we are asking bus boys who are walking by.  The waitress never came back.  Then, when I guess we were kind of done, this guy comes over and just starts clearing our plates.  He tried to take my half full beer and I had to grab it out of his hands.  Why would you think I want you to take that?  It was almost like the waitress lady said to him something along the lines of get these people out of here, I need that table.  It just seemed really obvious to me.  And then we get our bill, and of course she charges me for the beer she offered if we stuck around.  Good stuff.

I recently had to head back to West Elm to return a slew of stuff that I realized I couldn't justify paying for, and figured hey, let's hit up Burton's around the corner while we're over here.Ambiance, very nice.  Big televisions in the bar for watching the game, very nice.  Our waiter who was very nice, very attentive, and who read us in a snap and found it definitely acceptable to make a slightly inappropriate comment, a plus.Hubby started with the steak and cheese spring rolls, while I ordered the stuffed zucchini.  His came out first (I made sure to have it this way because we were both famished and mine was going to take a while) and they brought over hot bread straight from the oven to tide me over until mine was ready.  He said the spring rolls were really good, and while the bread wasn't a home run, the herb butter that was served along with it made it damn tasty.  My zucchini didn't take as long as they prepared me for.  Rolled and stuffed with herb cheese, then set in a tomato sauce with parm, it had a really nice flavor.  I'm a texture freak, and while I didn't notice or mind it, hubby took one bite and passed on any more because it 'crunched like dirt' in your ears.  As for the entree, we split the chicken over risotto and because I'm a carb addict, I got a side of cous cous.  The chicken was just ok, the risotto was fantastic, and the cous cous was just ok.  This is the second time I've ordered cous cous (I think the first time was at Mooo) and it is not cous cous at all!  More like pasta.  Do I need to bring back real cous cous from Morocco for these people?  I didn't mind thte pasta-like texture, but I definitely would have preferred the real deal.The menu didn't really appeal to me as a whole for two reasons: there was a lot of proscuitto and a lot of mushrooms.  Two things I cannot choke down.  As for the drinks, we were given an argument I've never heard before about why there were no beers on tap.  They said it was because they like everything \\"fresh\\" and therefore refused to put in taps so the beer wouldn't be sitting in the kegs.  I mean, it makes sense, but I thought the explanation was kind of odd.  I wasn't in the mood for wine, and I didn't want bottled beer, so I opted for the pomegranate martini.  I don't even remember drinking the first one, I downed it so frickin fast.  And the two that followed?  So tasty.  I'll go back for those if I'm in the area again, that's for sure.Speaking of going back, let's go back to the service.  This is why I'm giving Burton's 3 stars and not 2.

I really didn't think much of it everytime I passed by it, but I heard good things about it from a friend who would always say \\"you have to try the brunch at Cafe LuUuUUUuuuUna!\\"So I did-- this past Sunday at 11:54am, which, I expected would be a long wait. We must have hit the jackpot because right after, there was a bunch of people that had to wait for a few minutes.Everything on the menu looked delicious. Even the specials. But I wasn't in the mood for french toast, pancakes, or something sweet that morning. I wanted something savory.... like eggs and beans and potatoes (I know... I was lame for ordering something I could have made at home for much cheaper). With my main plate, I also ordered a mochalatte envisioning that I would get a pretty picture like a heart or a leaf in the foam as in the Yelp page for this restaurant. I did not. (Booo) Despite that, I honestly enjoyed my meal, and my fellow bruncher definitely enjoyed his. He got the pancake special which included lemon ricotta cheese with raspberries. It was delicious too, but I couldn't have a lot of it.The good thing about this place is that you have the option of ordering a smaller portion of the pancakes or french toasts that they give you. AND at a cheaper price, too. So it's good you have that option. I think all restaurants should be like that.I would give it 5 stars but the waiters seemed all over the place. Maybe just ours. But I'm guessing he was hungover from the night before. He was one of those waiters that tries to wow you with their memorization skills by taking your order and not writing it down.. and then 5 minutes later come back to you to ask if you ordered a coke or something totally different than what you asked for. I mean really, is it that hard to write it down on a piece of paper? I don't want to tell you again. But that's a different story and this rant should belong in a Yelp equivalent of service people. Oh yeah, when I ordered my latte, I wish he had told me that there were 2 shots of espresso in it. I was totally wired the whole day making Monday morning unbearable...Overall, it's a pretty good brunch place and I'll definitely come back despite the frazzled service."},{"name":"Spinelli's Deli","address":"767 Neil Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"I love the coffee and steak and egg sandwich.

Take a tour of the buffet stations before you commit to dining here.  I forgot to do this because the yelp reviews were so good.  But I think everyone comes from different places and have different expectations.  This place would not get pass two stars on yelp if it was located in Los Angeles or San Francisco.Definitely not recommended for the price you pay.  I came on a Monday so its $26, weekends are more.  My share was about $30 after tips. I expect variety of different kinds of food and decent quality.  Here i dont get quality and i dont get variety.  A big variety of sushi rolls should not be the only focal point of the buffet.  The crab legs and oyster was limited and runs out fairly quick.  I think they refill fairly quick.   The quality of the raw fish is below to standard quality.  I mean some of the fishes should not be served at all.  1/4 of the buffet was sushi and majority sushi rolls. 1/4 seafood salad, no fresh salad bar, unless I missed it some where.  There was a station that highlighted four different sauces (not necessary, save the space for more food instead) on half and the other half was filled with small plates that contain two slices of sashimi (again taking up too much space)  Then the remainder of the buffet selection was about 10 -15 dishes or so of cooked dishes such as bbq ribs, teriyaki chicken, fish and portabelo mushroom, etc.  many of the cooked dishes were pretty dried up.  There  is a grill and noodle station too.The couple of things that I liked from my meal was the miso soup, spinach with sesame, and the bbq spare ribs.  The ribs was full of flavor and very tender.The steamed pork dumpling (siu mai) - i expect it to be packaged food, but it taste bad, it seems like it was spoiled food.Something unique they have is called the sapporo pork.  I don't know what to make of it, it we bleh..Yelpers were recommending the green tea ice cream.  It was the only dessert we tried since we were pretty turned off by our meal so far.  the ice cream was pretty bad.  The texture was not smooth, it feels like eating something like hawaiian poi (taro root) except its green tea flavored,  I can taste strong green tea powder flavor.    We decided to skip dessert altogether.  Sushi and rolls - poor to standard quality.  Rolls are definitely the star of this buffet.  So if you like a big selection of rolls, you will be quite happy here.  I am not sure about paying $30 for it.  Some of the raw fishes should not be served because it was simply not fresh enough to eat.What I would expect from a $30 dinner buffet at a minimum is that they serve lobster, even if they limit half per person (just a standard, I usually don't eat it. :)).  Definitely lots more selection than this place.  They don't even have a fresh salad bar here.  What I would pay and not complain would be about $15 for what they offered here.   We dined for about half an hour and each of us ate about 1 plate of food.Overall.  I think this place needs to lower their prices or step up and raise the bar of the quality and variety for the primium price they want to charge."},{"name":"Corner Bakery Cafe","address":"9761 Great Hills Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"\\"Breakfast under $5, count me in\\"There's not much to the inside of this place...or outside.

My office is downtown, I eat everywhere and often, and there is nowhere that makes a better (Jumbo!) Reuben sandwich than LaGrassa's.  Packed with high quality meat, served on perfectly grilled pumpernickel, 10/10.But this review is about more than that.  It is about the unimaginable commitment to quality and service that I just experienced from LaGrassa's.Here's my story: Today I ordered my Jumbo Reuben online to speed up my lunchtime process.  ( The site is simple to use and the sandwiches sit waiting, like little treasures in paper bags, just inside the TakeOut door, allowing me to put the swerve on what is usually a crowd of equally passionate LaGrassa's sandwich fans.  Anyway ... )I am given the bag with my name on it with no waiting, arrive back at my office, and tragically, the wrong sandwich is in there.  I doublecheck, and yes, my name is definitely on it.  Nothing wrong with the sandwich inside, a tasty chicken something, but not what I was craving.  So, after lunch is over, I pick up my phone to let LaGrassa's know.  I looked at my phone and there was a message waiting.Ronnie LaGrassa, somehow divining that I had been given the wrong sandwich, had already left me a voicemail.  He apologized for the error, and asked me to call him with the floor my office was on so that he could have one of his team bring me my actual sandwich.  I called back and let them know it wasn't necessary, as I had already eaten the mistake, but they insisted.  Ten minutes later, a smiling LaGrassa's delivery person arrived with a beautiful sandwich and a LaGrassa's coffee mug that I'm proudly displaying on my desk.This kind of commitment to quality and customer experience is rare, and I don't expect to see it in a business with the volume of customers, accolades, and success that I see at Sam LaGrassa's. In spite of their growth and popularity, they still care about every customer and every sandwich.If you want a sandwich, and you want to be certain that it will be uncommonly excellent and made with the kind of care you would use to craft one for the most important lunch of your life, get to LaGrassa's.

Alas, my experience was marred by the management not honoring a valid Yelp coupon or taking any responsibility to fix it going forward :  I stopped by because I was offered a coupon for 5 free ounces on my Yelp app, but when I got to the counter with the activated coupon the owners told me the coupon was invalid.  One said it was from the \\"former owners,\\" but then the other said it was for their shop but that it was a \\"mistake.\\"  In my ideal world, they would have still honored it and told me that they would correct the \\"mistake\\" on Yelp, but instead they just told me it was wrong and didn't seem very interested in correcting the error on Yelp.

I asked the bartender for an arnold palmer with vodka and got a lemonade. When I brought it up to him, he made a flippant remark and didn't even apologize. I told him I'd take a glass of tea instead of a new drink, and he made it clear it was a burden for him to do so. He brought me a FULL tumbler of warm tea. I was able to splash some of my lemonade in there and it was gross. Great start to the evening.When we were seated in the main dining area, service was okay, nothing to get excited about. When I dine at a fine restaurant, I expect much more from the service. The food - mediocre. The oysters- eh, Chops is leagues better (a 10 vs. a 3 at Rathbun's).pork appetizer 3/10 - over seasoned.Mac & cheese - 4/10 - its' mac n cheese. nothing special.creamed corn - 7/10 this was good.scalloped sweet potatoes - 3/10 - not much flavor. just a lot of cheese.dry aged steak for 2 - 7/10. $72 to feed two, not badbaked alaska - 3/10 - not much flavor, didn't even light itchocolate trifle- 2/10 - no flavor. the salted caramel ice cream on top had some flavor, so that gets a 6/10.\\nThis is ridiculous. I suggest Kevin send his staff to a place such as Chops, Fogo or Fleming's for a lesson on customer service. Seasons 52 also places an obvious emphasis on treating customers with respect. The food - just work on it. I do not recommend this place to anyone. I have already left a message requesting a return call, but with the level of service I experienced on Saturday, I doubt I'll hear back.****\\nUpdate: I actually did hear back from someone at Rathbun's and he was very apologetic and ensured me customer service aspect would be addressed. I do appreciate his response and willingness to address my concerns. As with many places, the staff may have been overwhelmed and not very customer-focused. This is my guess, not from the manager who called me as he did not make excuses for the experience."},{"name":"Cheeseburger Bobby's","address":"4365 Roswell Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I was in Sandy Springs and thought I would stop by Cheesburger Bobby's for an early dinner.  They are on Scout Mob and Yelp has a check-in offer for a free Classic cheeseburger with the purchase of a drink and fries.  I did the Yelp offer.  This spot of located in the shopping center on the corner of Hammond Drive and Roswell Road.  There is plenty of parking, but it can be packed from all the businesses around. So you go in, order your meal, and they give you a pager to alert you when your meal is ready.  It took about five minutes.  They have an assortment of seasonings on the front counter for your fries or some even put it on their burger, I was told.  So, you tell them what kind of cheese you want on your burger (they don't have provolone), and I opted for pepper jack.  Once your pager goes off and you get your burger, you move to the buffet for all of your toppings.  It includes three types of lettuce, three types of peppers, onions (red and white), pickles, and tomato,  Of course, all the condiments are available.  I really like this set up.  They were out of the little cups for which you put ketchup or mustard in.  I asked if they had more, and a lady who was in regular clothes and who had been standing in the dining area speaking with the employee behind the counter said they were out.  I asked her if she worked there and she said yes.  I didn't like this lady for I really feel like she made a snide remark when I asked the working employee a question prior to that.  I decided to ignore her because I didn't feel like turning up in Sandy Springs.  Why didn't she just go home?  I gave her a filthy look. I know she said something smart when I asked that question.  What I wanted was for her to let the employee who was actually on the clock and behind the counter deal with me.  Anyway, the burger was okay.  The bread was buttered and warm. The beef was not bad. The fries were pretty good and they give you plenty of them.  Next time, I'll get a burger with more beef on it.  The dining area was spacious with plenty of room.  If you sit in a booth, you will be low as it relates to the table you're eating on.  The lady behind the counter came out and brought peppermint to me and another lady who was in there.  A sweet gesture indeed.  Anyway, I'll be back to this place.  It's a cool burger option."},{"name":"Counter Culture","address":"2337 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow.

Since my friend has only an hour for lunch, it was disappointing that the majority of the time was spent waiting for our order.

How did I not find out about this gem of a bar in East Austin before?!Weather Up has one of the coolest vibes and environments for an East Austin bar that I've ever seen. They have plenty of outdoor seating and a full-service bar where you can order anything from a tequila shot to a long island tea. Cocktails range anywhere from $10-$14, so it's not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, but the cool ice (get it) blocks they serve with the drinks almost make it worth the price by itself. They also have a menu of sharable eats, but they're really just appetizers--don't expect to get full off of it. We got the crostini, crostada, and the fingerling fries. All were $10-$11, and SO so so good. The fingerling fries were served with a lemon-rosemary aioli, the crostada contained a yummy brie and pear slices served with a fresh spring mix salad, and the crostini had a great spread to pair with it (can't remember what was in it right now...)I'd highly recommend Weather Up for a small-moderate sized group of friends to hang out and catch up.

However, after and over hour and fifteen minute wait in a crowded waiting area, where I waited with people who were clearly much cooler than I was, we got seated at a table that was still in the waiting area.  Once seated the waitress came by very quickly to take our order and just as promptly was gone.  Our pancake appetizer (The whole reason for waiting) we were even more disappointed.  The griddle that we were to cook the pancakes on was not very warm and all of the pancakes stuck to the griddle...their answer \\"make smaller pancakes, they cook faster.\\"  What if I dont want a quarter sized pancake? Not to mention the pumpkin batter tasted like it was from a box.  Bisquick tastes more homemade.  After waiting another frustrating half hour for our food, we realized why we had to wait so long for a table.  When our food finally did come we were again disappointed by how it tasted.  We then had to wait another 15 minutes from the time we were done with our food until the bill came when I was surprised to learn that my juice cost more that the pancakes.  The only other time we saw the waitress was when she was saying that our food would be only a little longer, we never even got our water glasses refilled.

Our server also didn't bother to describe the premium wine pairings beyond mentioning the varietal (or show us the bottles; a typical practice at restaurants like this).

In order to sharpen my play I snacked on delightful coffee's (multiple) and pastries.  And I saw others who had brought in outside food and drink with no trouble.The $10 entrance fee and $6 worth of coffees means I had a night worth of entertainment for $16, which I challenge anyone to do better.

I'm so happy that I did. One problem - I wanted to try all of the different types of meat balls. I went against my servers suggestion at getting the trio. The reason I went against it was I didn't think I could eat 3. So for my 1st visit I chose Nonna's traditional Italian with creamy polenta. I also ordered the vegetarian because, hey, I was really curious how a meatball could have no meat....hmmm? So I was happily surprised when my order came out and I had.....4 meatballs all together. Like I said, should have gone with the trio as my server suggested (listen to the server Nancy!)\\nMy Nonna's traditional ball was large, firm, moist and full of flavor. The sauce was delicious and not overly tart or sweet.....just right. The creamy polenta complimented to meatball well. The vegetarian had a wonderful flavor. It did crumble when cutting into it, but I wouldn't hold it against a ball with not a lot of protein holding it together. It was topped with a green pesto sauce that rounded out the vegetarian ball. \\nMy meal also came with a side of salad and a piece of focaccia. All of it was totally delizioso!Good stuff:\\n- Local biz in a local neighborhood\\n- Lot's of variety in meatballs and dishes for anyone not wanting a meatball\\n- Good sized plates\\n- Clean and friendlyNot so good:\\n- You can't sample all the different types of meatballs in one sitting"},{"name":"Toichi Ichiban Japanese Cuisine","address":"5 Kendall St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"The fish was not fresh and had a chewy texture.

Every year, my dad gets up at 4am on Thanksgiving Day and begins cooking the turkey. He spices it perfectly, inserts an onion, lemon and fresh sprigs of rosemary into the open cavity. Then, he lets it cook for hours and hours. When it is finally time to sit around the table and enjoy the turkey, it is the moistest, tastiest turkey anyone has had all year. Imagine this kind of tender, juicy turkey on lightly toasted bread, and you have Cafe Luna's Roma Panini.Too often, paninis are not well executed. I often find that the bread is too crunchy and in some cases, nigh impossible to eat from all of the toasting. At Cafe Luna, the bread (which tasted like it was dipped lightly in olive oil and rosemary) was ever so delicately browned, but still retained the soft, fluffy texture of fresh bread. The individual parts of the sandwich were meticulously stacked, so I got every single flavor in every bite. The cheese was perfectly melted. The turkey, as I mentioned, was tender and juicy, but it also had a wonderfully sweet and savory flavor. I got halfway through the panini before I realized that the wonderful flavor I was tasting was the turkey itself. Even though I was very full after finishing the panini, I really didn't want the experience to end.  I went back to work and talked incessantly to my coworkers about how delicious my lunch had been. In short, this was THE BEST PANINI I'VE EVER HAD.  If you're in Cambridge, or even just passing through Central, do yourself a favor and stop by. It's a very short walk down Mass Ave from the T and you can sit inside or outside (which I recommend if the weather is nice). The staff were super friendly, eager to answer questions, and the food was so good that I felt compelled to return to the cafe (after having eaten my lunch outside in the square) to tell them just how wonderful the food was.

It was THAT good. :)"},{"name":"Thunderbird Coffee","address":"2200 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Amazing coffee/cappuccino with great ambiance and outside seating make it a great place to be!"},{"name":"Murphy's Twin Shamrocks","address":"425 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"Solid!

My tacos were much better than tacos from Torchy's visits past - not at all greasy which has been a problem before - but still nothing outstanding.While I'm still not a Torchy's convert, if I'm looking for fast food in the area and not interested in a burger (P. Terry's) or a sandwich (Jersey Mike's), I'll give Torchy's another go. (Congrats Torchy's.  This version of you is probably the only one I'll ever return to.

The bartenders make the place, working in the service industry you appreciate going to places where people recognize that you want to be treated with prompt service in a casual atmosphere. The place has cheap drink specials, a cook who takes his work with serious pride, and overall a great atmosphere to drink downtown without havng to deal with all of the downtown ridiculousness.We come here at least once a week.

The gf and I decided that we would check it out. We went in about 8p on Sat night. To start with, it was packed. Now, if were somewhere in the city, that would be understandable, but out here in the burbs on a Sat night after 8p, I was surprised. The inside was nothing overly special. However, we were seated at a nice booth, and the server was on us quickly for our drink orders. There was a large party of 20 people next too us. While they were really loud and annoying, I was impressed at how well the server managed their table and the flow in which their food came out. We ordered anti-pasta plate. It was quite large and had a nice assortment of meat, cheese, and veggies on it. I ordered the ribs and steak tip combo. Both were quite tasty and while the ribs look odd when they came out, they were hot and juicy. Steak tips were cooked medium rare as requested and the fries that came with it were piping hot. Gf ordered pasta bolonaise. While it came out looking a bit mushy, I took a bite of hers and it tasted perfectly al dente and the sauce was think and tasty.

It got replaced by The Nook, and I never went to it until a few weekends ago.After a Yelp event, I was told this would be an after party spot after I am pretty sure one the elite events we had that week.  So my buddy and I arrived around 11ishPM, and were able to park in the back (VERY small lot, be careful!).  We got a corner table for 6 with the anticipation of more people coming.  We started off with house brew (Keystone Light- haven't seen that on draft anywhere, haha!), and some Tot'Chos (Tater tots topped like nachos, i hear they are \\"world famous\\").The server was pretty friendly, but as he kept talking to my buddy about I don't know, I kept gazing around and was shocked at how different the place looked than the last time I went in.  Duhh, Tom- thats what happens when a place changes names.When I originally ordered my drink, I ordered the redneck totchos as well.  I would like to say I was speaking pretty clearly when I ordered.  My buddy ordered a KL. When the drinks came out, he asked if we wanted any food.  I thought this would be interesting, so I ordered a mac n cheese totchos too, to see if both will be brought out.Much to my dismay, I never got the Redneck totchos (the ones I really wanted to eat)- and got the mac n cheese ones.  The tots were cooked well, but under seasoned.  The toppings were alright.  I still lusted for the redneck ones (topped with brisket, jalapenos, and bbq).Needless to say, we looked like 2 bunch of losers in a huge booth to ourselves, as the rest of the group ended up at other locations.  So we decided to leave.

The food we had was quite good.  Prepared very well and well balanced.  Soto is not a traditional sushi house and doesn't pretend to be, but they are very good at balancing flavors you might expect to not work well together.  For instance, hamachi sashimi with scallion, fried jalape√±o, and garlic chili sauce might have you wondering what the point of having the hamachi on the plate is.  But they pull it off and the flavor of the fish is actually pleasant and texture good.  The not quite as good- nigiri is one piece only, for a small, small bite.  It brings an air or pretentiousness that I'm not sure such a new establishment has earned.  It's not as bad as Uchiko- the clientele at Soto are marginally more diverse and the restaurant frequented by a younger set, but I'm not sure why the choice shouldn't be 2 nigiri or 2 sashimi...?The bad- the space is dreadfully loud.  All stone and glass.  You cannot hear your dinner partner.  The longer the evening went the louder it got, such that we decided it wasn't for us.  Also, they have an utterly pointless sushi bar.  If you sit at the sushi bar, you have a special sushi bar menu.  Except the sushi chef does nothing for you, you are served by an array of servers who approach unannounced and mid-bite from behind you and ask what the next thing is you want.  The sushi bar is sunk down somewhat from the prep table, so there is quite a shadow on it as well, which makes reading the menu somewhat challenging, and forget watching the chefs prepare much unless you stand over 2 meters tall.  But nevermind because the chefs don't interact at all.  Again, Soto is a mix of good food and poor logistics.  Perhaps as they settle in things will improve!"},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"On a trip to Portland and had time to kill.

First time there.  Had been to Rathbuns before.Arrival:  When my colleague and I arrived, we did the standard valet partking.  Valet was running around working his ass off, despite the overbearing Atlanta heat (it was hot, even for Atlanta). Checked with hostess.  And, although this didn't occur to me except subconciously at the time, the hostess seemed out of place.  She was your typical pretty-face, friend-of-the-manager-type hostess that you might expect at a lower scale restaurant.  Usually a steakhouse of this caliber has the career-professional at the front door that makes you think he's independently wealthy but has nothing better to do than be a host at a steakhouse.  Oh, well.Got our drinks and while we were sitting there, Kevin Rathbun walks by.  We tell him we're excited to be there and he was very friendly and welcoming.  (I was a bit star-struck, since I'd just seen him on the DVD that came with my Big Green Egg.  And, oh yeah, he's also a decent chef.)Pretty-Face came over and told us our table was ready.  She seemed very interested in getting us to our table, even though we were relaxing with our drinks.  I suppose it's just as well, since if she'd left us to our own devices, we might have had another.  Then our taste buds would have been shot.Got to our table.  (The lighting was fine, despite what other reviewers have said.)  I found the service to be excellent (and I'm VERY picky about service).  Immediate attention.  Great knowledge of the menu.  Presented the specials.  Laughed at our jokes about how ribeye is the best and only women get filets and there's a reason they're wrapped in bacon (the filet, not the women).  All the time in the world for us.  No one's water glass was ever empty.  Bottle of wine well presented (and delicious).  Glasses kept full.  Barely noticed the server even though he was busy taking care of us.  All the food came out at the right time.Wine was a cabernet from the Niner Wine Estates (Paso Robles).  It was very good.  I'd agree with other reviewers that the wine list is good.  They are selective...not just presenting a huge list of wines.  My parents live in Paso Robles so I try to order wines from there...it's a bit like having my parents there at the table, which is fun for me but might not be that great for you.For appetizers, we had the Korean BBQ Pork, which was good as a small plate.  You don't need more than a couple bites (flavor is strong).  We also had the lobster fritters, as recommended by our waiter.  How could something called a LOBSTER FRITTER be bad?  Answer -- it cannot.  I was a bit sad there were 4 on the plate and I had to let my (female) colleague have the last one.  She owes me.My client and I each had the 20-oz dry aged ribeye.  Yum.  Tasted like...a big ribeye.  Mid rare goes without saying.  Was prepared mid rare.  Creamed spinach was the side.  Delicious.  (As you can see, we were going for the low-cal meal.)Dessert?  Of course!  We put it all in the middle to share.  Seasonal (blueberry) cobbler was amazing.  Those other people at my table kept eating it so I barely got any.  Strawberry baked alaska was really good but also confusing to my tastebuds, for some reason.  They were scratching their little tastebud heads about having to choose between that, the cobbler, and the third dessert that I've somehow forgotten about but was just as good.We had a very good meal, very good service, and a good time."},{"name":"Wingstop","address":"4124 SE 82nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I used to love Wingstop so much and I never thought there would be the day I would feel otherwise.Went recently and didn't enjoy it and thought it was a fluke. Went again this week... came to realize that something changed and I'm just not impressed anymore.Lemon Pepper Bone-In, Garlic Parmesan Boneless, and the fries were always enough to get me to come here. Idk what happened or if something changed in the way they cooked lemon pepper but the flavor is NOT what it used to be. It wasn't seasoned enough our last visit, so we asked for a little more seasoning and got nothing but a pile of dry rub dumped on our wings. It was too salty and there was so much seasoning I literally was coughing/choking on the dry rub every other bite. I loved when the wings used to be a little more oily and the lemon pepper seasoning wasn't just a rub (more soaked into the wing itself). Now the wings are drier + dry seasoning = no thanks.The Garlic Parmesan was also so salty I couldn't get through a couple pieces. Idk if it was the wings that got saltier or the seasoning, but even dipping in ranch was hard for me. I got sick of it fast and was disappointed because I love a good boneless Parmesan.Fries were fries. You ask for crispy, they're soft, when you ask for extra crispy they're a little burnt and dry. Overall still okay but not enough to come back here alone.The only thing I liked was the Original Hot wings. Maybe they oughta go back to basics because it seems like in the midst of changing/keeping it up with other joints, they lost what I loved most about the place.

It's a pretty big space and this is a great place to bring your kids/family, or friends. Basically it's a DIY pancake breakfast/brunch place and you have the option of making pancakes on the griddles that are installed at the tables, or choosing a breakfast/brunch item from their menu. They have seasonal batters (when we went in March/April, the seasonal batter was Blueberry Lavender) to choose from in addition to their staples. You can choose toppings which are separated into three price categories. I appreciate the variety of toppings, both sweet and savory, that you can choose from. The combinations really are up to you. My party had such a fun time that even the friends that did not want to participate in DIY pancakes in the beginning were making their own creations at the end.

The restaurant is a lot smaller than I was expecting, and the layout can be uncomfortable for larger parties.

I got to try their tacos at the Yelp Golden Age party last week, and I thought they were freakin' delicious.  Of course, they also didn't cost me anything.  Several people's reviews complain about the prices, but I just checked their menu, and the average street taco is only $3.99, which seems about right to me.   Maybe I'm just made of money or something.The rotisserie chicken was super flavorful and tender.  That alone is enough for me to go back for more.  I also tried a few of their sauces, and the Sriracha aioli was definitely my favorite.  It was the perfect combination of spicy and creamy.  I ended up putting it on everything, and it made everything even better.  So for now, Mighty Bird gets 4 stars from me.  Maybe it'll go up to 5 once I actually go to their restaurant and try a few more things from their menu.

I got the combo plate with gyro and Soulvaki, Greek salad, rice and pita. The Soulvaki was more peppery than I was used to but still very good. For $18, I already had the extra kabob as a midnight snack and might get two small meals out of the rest or one large lunch, so it was a very good deal.

We have been there twice now. The first time I got the 1/2 chicken BBQ. The chicken had a very smoky flavor, which is not my personal preference. I'm weird about smoked foods. It doesn't usually bother me with BBQ, but this just happened to be too much for me--no fault of the restaurant. The sweet tea is good--not too sweet (and I like their glasses). The mac and cheese is pretty amazing--made with shells and 3 types of cheese. But the Brussels sprouts were what impressed me the most. They are super fresh, roasted to perfection, and the maple syrup is the perfect accompaniment to balance out their natural bitterness. The second time we went, I got the Kobe beef hotdog without the bacon but with chili and cheddar, and it was pretty delicious. Of course I had to get the Brussels sprouts again because (a) they are scrumptious, and (b) getting a vegetable side totally balances out the fact that you're eating a chili dog--that's science. The decor is nice and fits with the neighborhood. I like the wide plank floors a lot. The service was friendly and attentive both times. My only real complaint is that it's incredibly loud in there. The first time we went was on a Falcons game day, so you kinda expect the TVs to be blaring football and for drunk girls to be crawling onto the bar. The second time we went was a Wednesday night. The place wasn't full, and the other customers weren't rowdy, but the music was deafening. I think it might have been some Mumford & Sons nonsense because there was a lot of banjo involved, and it made it pretty difficult to have a conversation with our friend who was visiting from out of town. So my only advice would be to turn down the music on nights when there isn't a huge bar crowd. Otherwise, welcome to the neighborhood. I hope they stay in that spot for a long time to come."},{"name":"Counter Culture","address":"2337 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Pretty good taste on the bruschetta appetizer but waaaaaaaay to small for five bucks!

So, it smelled funny.  My miso soup was cold, but maybe that's traditional and I didn't know about it?  I would have felt stupid if I told the waitress my soup was cold and she told me that's how it's supposed to be, so I just ate it cold.  Tasted pretty good, though.It was a Monday evening and there was only one other table occupied.  So...no problem getting seated.  We got plenty of attention from our waitress, but not to the point of being annoying.  We ordered four rolls to follow the miso.  It didn't take long for them to come out, and they were all very good.  There was a pretty good selection, but could have been better.  I wish I would have tried the sushi, because that's probably the best way to tell if it's a good sushi restaurant.  But based on the rolls, which were awesome, I'll go out on a limb and say it's a good sushi place, at least better than most.  The whole staff was friendly, and the metal chop sticks were a nice touch (dunno why I liked that).  And it wasn't too expensive.I would never have gone to this place if it wasn't for Yelp because it's hidden away in a little shopping plaza.  But I'm glad I found it because now I have another nearby sushi option to go to when it's not a dollar sushi day at Rain.  I still haven't found a place with the selection, quality, and low prices of Fuji in Orlando, but Kiku is one of the good ones here in Atlanta.

That's highway robbery. No ice, no garnish, nothing. A little splash of some cocktail mix, in large glass. Nope. Not happy. Disspointment continued with appetizers. We ordered the endemame dumplings, the brussel sprouts, and a butternut squash pizza.\\n1) The Endemame Dumplings were okay. Very, okay. Semi-bland, a little mushy. The texture was mediocre, a little soft. The flavor of the filling was a little bland, nothing to write home about.\\n2) The Brussel Sprouts were good. They had some good spice, good texture - a little on the overcooked side, and a decent flavor profile.\\n3) The Butternut Squash Pizza - was bland and dry, the vegan almond 'ricotta' was flavorless! The crust was okay, decent crunch and thickness. The butternut squash was okay, again a little bland. The 'ricotta' was basically just cold blended almonds - I have made better vegan ricotta myself. No flavor!At this point we ordered a beer in hopes to 'top off' and balance out the lack of the first cocktail. When the beer arrived at the table the server said 'who had the pint?' he set it down on the table and AGAIN - the drink wasn't FULL?... This time it was about 3/4 of a 16oz cup.

Here is the story:We came from Wisconsin to Portland, and a family member that is a big foodie as us recommended this place, and kept raving about it. Ok, so we get to the restaurant (driving through some sketch area of Portland, not in the heart of downtown, FYI) , and the hostess hardly smiled and was somewhat cold. I asked to put us down for three people, and she said she would call us when a table was ready, and walked away. We waited in the shack like looking part of the restaurant (entrance looked run down too), the dining part wasn't that great either, kind of divy.My family and I proceeded to use the restroom, where we saw a full table cleaned, empty and ready to be seated. So I thought I would ask the hostess about it. I went to see the those hostess, who was flirting with some ugly bearded dude. I just nicely said to her, since she didn't appear to be \\"working\\", \\"Excuse me, but we see that a table is ready inside, may we be seated there?\\". She proceeded to flare her eyes big, and tell me very rudely \\"I told you that I told you when a table is ready, and I will ok?. Out of the shock of her response, I told her that she didn't need to talk to me that way as I asked a simple question, and I was a patron. She then proceed to tell me that the table was not ready, and to go sit somewhere. I then told her that I was a customer and didn't need to be talked to this way, and that we came all they way to try the food, and I would be happy to write a review of this experience on Yelp, as many of my friends are Yelp Elite. She proceeds to walk away, comes back and said in smart a** voice that the table was not ready, and she was right. I told it was, and I saw it with my own eyes. Then she walks away and comes back with the manager, who is even more rude comes up to me and says, \\"What is the problem here?\\", not  hi or hello, just up in my face rude. I explained the situation and rudeness of the hostess, who proceeds to defend the hostess behavior and actions, and then says \\"You want to sit down and eat here or what?\\". Since we were hungry and it was too late in the night to go elsewhere, I said yes. Right away we get seated at the table that I SAW WAS READY!!! How ironic that in a minute the table was ready.Even more interesting, when we got seated, we the waiter came over and said he apologized on behalf of the team, for the \\"confusion in regards to the status of the table\\". I knew right there, that it was not sheer irony, the hostess and the manager was in the wrong, the table was ready and I didn't deserve the treatment I got. Which he (the waiter) agreed the same when I told him what exactly had happened. Which apologized for as well, and laughed about the guy who was the \\"manager\\" that night when I asked him about his position, etc. That was even more reassurance of these two rude morons behavior and actions that night, apparently no one gave them customer 101 classes!!!That leads me to when we looked at the menu. We three people were vegetarians, though Yelp said this place is vegetarian friendly, it is certainly not. The waiter could only recommend the noodle soup to us as vegetarian. We needed more substance than that, after a long day of touring the area. With the rudeness we got from the hostess and manager (who defended her lameness, oh btw, did I mention when I told him that the customer is always right, especially on service, he had the nerve to say without looking me in face \\"Whatever.\\"....really???), lack of food options, we left. Then sadly, proceed to go get some fast food to feed our hungry tummies, yes, Yelpers, that is how bad it was. I don't know about the other people raving about this place, but it seems more for the food. But even seeing what others were eating, I wasn't really sold, and the prices were high for the area. They might have been putting up with the staff's behavior, but from some of the yelp reviews trending, I see the staff can be pretty rude. Bottom line, this place is not in the \\"heart\\" of Portland, and in some developing/recovering part of Portland. If I were you, I would take my time, self respect and foodie tummy elsewhere....unless maybe perhaps, you are Anthony Bourdian, and then they put a good \\"show\\" on for you.

We feel we were discriminated against for our service animal and felt threatened as the waitress chased us out of the restaurants.We walked in and sat down they did say no dog we replied to both waitresses that the dog is a service dog and was wearing her service vest. No biggie! We understand people do take advantage of this. When the waitress came to the table my friend ordered a mimosa, she was the only one drinking at the table. We are 35, 37, and 33 years old. The waitress carded her and then carded all of us. I did not have my id on me just cash because I had no reason for it. She refused service to my friend because I didn't have my ID and says it is the the law.  She said my friend was going to sneak me drinks like we some young kids. Also there is no OLCC law that states this! You do have the right to refuse service to a patron but there was no reason for that at all. She was so rude about it we left. We felt she was purposely being difficult with us because of the service animal. I told her I was going to write a review and she responded while following us out of the restaurant saying,\\" Are you threatening me?!?\\" Really?!?! We felt threaten by her.

When we went, they didn't have our reservation and we had to show them our confirmation. No apology, just told to sit at a small table outside. After sitting for about thirty minutes we got water and about 45 we got to order. After an hour and a half, we received our first dish. I noticed that other tables were receiving food, so went to check on our food. When I went inside, I asked when we could expect our food since we had been waiting an hour and 45 minutes. The co-owner/server disagreed with me and asked \\"what's your point\\" and I said I wanted to know when we could expect dinner or that I wanted to leave. He didn't say anything but waved goodbye to me. I can't think of a time I've been treated more rudely in a service industry and was completely shocked after waiting for so long when they initially forgot our reservation. I've taken work, family, and friends here before, but clearly cannot go anymore because the restaurant has gotten too popular for them to treat customers with common courtesy.

My boyfriend felt guilty for cheating on Otto (which is right across from Oath)... and we've had pizza delivered to our home with the pizza still soft (from Otto).

So late on a Saturday night, our movie had just let out at Drexel and we needed some nosh, and badly. Rubino's has been on my listing for a long while since that social media article of best pizza places in your state thing, where Rubino's somehow managed to grab on to the numero uno spot. I liked Rubino's, because it looked like a place that really had not changed a whole lot over the years. No frills, no excitement... a few pictures slapped here or there, and an old cash register. My biggest excitement was the fact this place housed some old pizza ovens which equals amazing pizza, since they were broken in a full of decades of flavors. Speaking of flavors, the place was smelling a little burnt around the edges. However, when you receive your pie in less than 10 minutes, you tend to understand how these things happen. Rubino's is the definition and epitome of thin-cracker crust. They just blow everyone out of the water. We are like 1 ply layer next to nothingness when comparing crusts. Crunchy and crispy, and easily acceptable for a person to ingest a large pie into themselves. Some things I was not impressed with:The sauce... It was just too robust and WAY too salty, which accounted for major heartburn. I would suggest forgoing saltier toppings like pepperoni and anchovies and sticking with cheese or some plainer toppings. The experience over all was pleasant and quick, but the most important thing that you need to know before coming here is BRING CASH!!!! Absolutely no credit cards. If you happen to be one of those shmucks (like me) you're in luck, there is an ATM across the road. Good, solid, old, pizza, but Ohio's best???Naaaah.

When you have a new restaurant, it is more important to be steady than to change your menus quickly in my opinion when your focus is on consistency and building up regular clientele. After re-trying all the brews, I also found that they were not as good as I thought - guess good food the first time elevated the tasting experience before.  Their lighter brews are better - didn't like the medium and darker brews for sure.  Still, salt and pepper wings and duck confit pizza are still there and good.

Despite the bar being about 25 feet away it took 15 min to get the first round of drinks and about that long or longer for subsequent rounds. I actually had to get up twice to fill my water and others at the table as the water steward was never around. It also took forever for the waiter to take our order and clear empty plates from the table. Bread never arrived until half way through the meal when we finally asked for it. Chop salad showed up with blue cheese despite being ordered without it. The service staff and management seemed completely disorganized and clueless. Some staff running around like crazy, some just standing around doing nothing. I will say the food was very good and everyone in our party thought so as well.

Bookstore chains may come and go like boys (or perhaps just go for bookstores) but judging by store traffic, Powell's is here to stay. Borders and Barnes & Noble ain't got nothing on this locally owned bookstore. Its size speaks for itself - 3 levels and 68,000 sq ft of books and books and books... Like any other bookstore, there are loiterers but this bookstore can sell! During the weekends, there are as many as 6 cashiers at each of the two entrances/exits, collecting money from long-lines of customers. First time visitors most likely will get lost in this bookstore. There are nine color-coded rooms dividing thousands of sections in every subject imaginable. A couple of hours could easily be spent here if you enjoy browsing through books, and of course, longer if you plan to loiter in their coffee shop with some reading materials. They sell new and used books. A used novel is usually only a few bucks cheaper, but hey, that could go towards a mojito from one of the many lounges and restaurants that surround the area!"},{"name":"Vivo Austin","address":"6406 N I 35, Ste 2343","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"For my 100th review I am selecting Vivo's! Great food and great service.Bonus: They participate in Yelp's cash back program and offer 7% cash back.  And drum roll please, they also participate in FiveStars.  FiveStars is an app you download that gives you points for every dollar spent.  You earn rewards fast.  So in a way, you get to double-dip on rewards and salsa!!!I am a huge fan of Vivo's, especially their Happy Hour.  Mon-Fri from 4pm to 7pm you can choose from many items for only $5 each.  $5 HH menu items include: house margaritas that are adorned with a beautiful fresh orchid, top shelf margaritas, macho nachos with shredded chicken or picadillo meat (beef), Queso or TWO yes 2 tacos for $5.  For the 2 for $5 tacos you can choose any two you want, meaning you can mic and match.  Tacos like beef picadillo, pollo asado or fish.  The tortilla chips are made fresh daily and are delivered early each morning.  The red and green salsas are made fresh daily in-house.  Best of all the ladies that do the cooking have been wit Vivo's for years which speaks to the consistent quality of the meals.My go to items are the picadillo tacos (crunchy), pollo asado tacos and the top shelf margaritas.    I have also tried several of their enchilada dishes and liked them as well.I would recommend Vivo's to anyone looking for a good meal or a place for Happy Hour.  If you go, tell Kat, JD, James and Lance that Nickie sent you."},{"name":"Kevin Rathbun Steak","address":"154 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I've been eating here since they opened.  This experience was good, but not as spot-on as usual.  I ordered my filet medium and it came out rare.  I had them cook it a bit more and it was still a bit rarer than medium.  Conversely, another in our group ordered their steak medium rare and it came out almost medium well done.  Perhaps they switched our steaks when serving?  They also forgot to bring one person's soup.  I didn't care for the Cabernet our server recommended and another in our group didn't care for her Malbec.  The food quality was top-notch, as usual.  The server brought out two complimentary desserts for my birthday, and they were both excellent.  The server was very personable and the decor is comfortable and inviting.  So, overall, it was an enjoyable dining experience and we will be back.  But, as a high-end steakhouse, they need to make sure they get the details exactly right."},{"name":"Wings Over Somerville","address":"519 Somerville Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"2.5","text":"Having followed this legacy from its early roots in Amherst, I guess its hard for me to be UNbiased about Wings.

It hasn't ALWAYS been perfect, but who is?  Not this little wing-aholic, for damn sure.   On occasion I've had an order that was \\"meh\\", but that can be said of ANY take out/delivery place.  Its part of the biz.  Overall though, these people are the bee's knees of late night, slightly less than sober chicken.OH!  and get the waffle fries.  ONLY the waffle fries.

Multiple cashiers during the morning rush. Actually, multiple workers in general to get you on and out. Dont let the line fool you because it moves. You order at the counter then move down to pay. Sometimes they even give you your drink order on the way down to pay. Pastries and empanadas are given to you at the order line. When i got down to the register that was 3 feet away, my food order popped out before i even gave my credit card. For 2 breakfast croissant sandwiches (sausage,  egg, and cheese). Also to the chicken empanada for my kiddo. It was $3, small for the price in my opinion. The espresso cubano was strong and good. Also got the cubano con leche.

The menu is pretty insane, and it's kind of confusing at first to figure out what is what, especially since the menu design itself is super busy, with wacky fonts and weird organization. Essentially, the majority of their dishes are rice dishes - the various things listed on the menu description over a bed of seasoned brown rice. You can have this as just a bowl of rice, or you can have it wrapped up in a whole wheat tortilla. They also have salads, wraps, and two noodle dishes; additionally they have beers, fermented tea, smoothies, and juices.The restaurant was pretty crowded, and seating is kind of limited. However, since nothing really needs to be cooked (only assembled) things move really quickly and you get your food almost right away. You order your food first at the counter, and then you can have it brought to your table after receiving a number. Most everything is self serve - there are jars for water, utensils, and sauces. I got the Explorer with cashews in a wrap. I was honestly not expecting to like it since Life Alive isn't my usual kind of food, but it was actually really good - the rice was well flavored and the topping combination complemented each other really well. Overall, had an awesome experience - I'm not someone who usually likes these kinds of vegan, healthful places, but I can definitely see myself coming back."},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"A wonderful, wholesome meal with plenty of options and amazing smoothies!Everyone I'm near, I have to get a list alive smoothie and a swami bowl; too good to pass up.Wonderful atmosphere.

Their dine out menu is very expansive with much more than 3 choices and quite a few add on options. I won't go into too much detail except to say that almost everything was very well enjoyed by the family! All the seafood dishes we got had high quality, well cooked and delicious proteins. The sablefish was buttery and went perfectly with the citrus flavour while the bouillabaisse had huge, plump mussels in a thick and mouthwatering sauce (which my dad cleared from the bowl). The scallops were seared gloriously and the hamachi crudo was melt in your mouth perfection (this was probably the best of the night). The salad nicoise was quite a large portion although was too heavy on the mayo (both on the salad and on the bottom of the bowl). Dungeness crab pirogies were...unimpressive as there wasn't much crab and did not live up to the expectations of a \\"pierogi\\". So why the 4 instead of the 5? The dessert was kind of sad. We got 3 soft serve sundaes and all were already 1/3 melted. I really didn't like the strawberry soft serve and the shortbread crumbles were really just crumbs. The dark chocolate cremeux was also just okay. Overall, they really do specialize in seafood and they do it well here. Delicious appetizers and mains but disappointing dessert."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:R,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(i=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return i.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||i.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||i.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"search-container"},j={class:"card-container"},D=["disabled"],N={key:0},G={key:1};function F(i,e,s,f,n,r){const c=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",E,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>n.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,n.searchQuery]])]),t("div",j,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:n.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[n.isLoading?(a(),o("span",G,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",N,"See more"))],8,D)):w("",!0)])}const H=u(O,[["render",F],["__scopeId","data-v-49e87dea"]]),K=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/22.md","filePath":"glossary/22.md"}'),L={name:"glossary/22.md"},Y=Object.assign(L,{setup(i){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(H)]))}});export{K as __pageData,Y as default};
