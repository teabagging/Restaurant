This was just one of those experiences where everything seemed to click into place in just the right way. \\n\\nThe happy began when our server let us know appetizers were half price. I'm not the bargain-hunter sort but I gotta say, between the way that altered our ordering strategy and the $45 check for two, I just couldn't have asked for more... and less. We wound up sharing three appetizer plates, one entree and a dessert for a tapas-like meal that had a new flavor and a pleasant surprise at every turn.\\n\\nBacon Wrapped Texas Quail: Tiny little drumsticks swathed in pork, with jalape√±o and peach jam and micro greens. Looks and sounds fancy... tastes like comfort food.\\n\\nBlue Crab Gratin: With artichoke hearts. The crab's more of a team player than a rockstar on this one but the team is a winner. The delicate consistency of the gratin makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts.\\n\\nBLT Sliders: Holy shit! These are just OVER THE TOP! Grilled pork belly, fried green tomato, house-made pimento cheese and micro greens make an amazing mouthful. With all of these flavors thrown together part of me wanted to deconstruct the slider and savor each ingredient, but I couldn't be bothered... I just let each bite be the loud, awesome party it was intended to be.\\n\\nChicken Fried Beef Ribs: Our entree. Yes, we approached it with the proper morbid fascination for the over-the-top-ness of it all. I'm still kinda surprised I'd choose to eat chicken-fried ANYTHING, but I parked the cynicism, took a chance, and it was rewarded in spades. The flavors were all familiar and deftly executed. Seemingly against all odds, the dish succeeded, and succeeded big. Wowsers.\\n\\nButtermilk Pie: The filling had a really nice lemon note and the fresh raspberry sauce went way beyond the call of duty. Perfect fresh pastry crust. Yep.\\n\\nCould I imagine a few of these dishes rendered with a little more subtlety and art? Perhaps.

Both of previous experiences at Canoe (June 2005 and first in October 2004) had been fair. The first time the food was too gamy, and the second time everything was mediocre. \\n\\nAfter so many years, a change in chef, and several recommendations, we decided to try again. First, my husband had a large work dinner there. He came home raving about the meal. The food and service were far better than he remembered. Thus, we decided to go again, but this time, we would take my mother. \\n\\nThe service was terrible. While the view and setting is beautiful, it was ruined by the disgusting and continuous assortment of flies at our table, on our food, and in our faces. \\n\\nThe bread man came once, the waitress enjoyed long waits between returning to ask for questions or our order, and wee constantly needed more water. We were shocked at how slow and inattentive the service was. \\n\\nWe started with the Blue Cheese salad and recommended Salmon atop a potato pancake. The salad was not at all what she described or what we had explained we wanted. The salmon was fair. It wasn't bad but nothing that I would race to order again. \\n\\nFor dinner, my husband had the rabbit, I ordered the braised beef, and my mother had the salmon. The salmon was by far the worst of the dishes. She could not even finish it. The braised beef that I ordered was delicious but was served with undercooked cabbage. My entree was definitely the highlight of the meal. My husband enjoyed his rabbit, even though I found the bacon ravioli unnecessary and a poor addition to the dish. \\n\\nFor dessert, the waitress highly recommended the chocolate with hazelnut and carmel. It sounded fantastic but was supremely disappointing. The hazelnut mousse was way too heavy and overpowered the thin chocolate. \\n\\nOverall, it was a very disappointing evening. I left there feeling even less enthusiastic than 5 years ago. Bad service, decent food, great setting (when not interrupted by flies).

Knowing we would be eating mostly fried foods, we knew this was a bad start.\\n\\nWhat we ordered: Adobo brussel sprouts, Wok Squid, and \\"Kimchi Pork fries.\\" The adobo brussel sprouts were overwhelmed by a sweet sauce on the fried brussels - not a trace of vinegar or soy sauce, traditional Filipino adobo flavors. The wok squid was not crispy, very oily, and also flavored with the mystery sweet sauce. The worst dish was the \\"Kimchi Pork Fries\\" - french fries topped with kim chee, a heavy dose of sweet mayonnaise, fried pork chunks, and a HEAVY hand of bean sprouts. None of those flavors went well with each other especially the unseasoned, crunchy bean sprouts that blanketed the dish. Even after removing most of the bean sprouts, the heavy sweet mayonnaise is the next overarching offender and alas could not be separated from the other ingredients.

Thought it seemed very high for a couple cups of romaine lettuce, lemon wedge, dressing and sprinkle of parm, but I went for it anyway. I noticed the pepperoni has changed too. They are about the size of a penny and scantily placed on the slice. When I got back to my office with my food, I discovered that the lettuce was mostly stems and much of it had turned red. I was very disappointed considering it cost $7.00. For the size compared to the price, it should have been a perfectly fresh salad. The dressing had coagulated around the lid of the container it had been in (for an unknown amount of time). There were large sections on the pizza, about 3/4 size of a dollar bill, that did not have any pepperoni. I was really disappointed.

But Cucinova on Sawmill is more convenient for us.  \\n\\nMy husband got the whole wheat rotini pasta with pomodoro sauce and meatballs.  He enjoyed his meal.   \\n\\nI got a pizza with pineapple, peppadew, cherry tomatoes, and bell pepper.  I liked how they squeezed the liquid from the topping saving the pizza from getting soggy.  The crust was crispy and the edges had a nice chew.  It tasted fresh.  I really wished they had the same toppings as the Pizza Cucinova location--I missed having goat cheese.\\n\\nThe setup for handing out the cooked pizzas is a little awkward--they hand out pizzas before the cash registers, so you have to get past people paying for their food to get your pizza.  They did bring my pizza around to me, but it would have made more sense to have the extra counter space after the registers rather than before.\\n\\nOur meal tasted good and the location is convenient, so we will definitely be back."},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Huge place with a with high warehouse ceilings but very cozy and welcoming.

(Darenda) we had 4 young children with us so she said she'd give us a second to get them settled. ok. so she comes back asking if we were ready to order. she was very idk how to describe her. i felt extremely rushed. we told her no we weren't ready yet and and she quickly rushed off. she still didn't ask us what we would like to drink. so we sit....then shes back again with her \\"hurry up\\" attitude. ok can we get the kids something to drink please. ok. she runs off again as my husband is saying what the kids want to eat and is talking to himself basically because he thought she was still there. so we get our drinks y'all know what you want to eat? no...can we get an appetizer the chicken quesadilla and....shes off again before we can say what our children want. ok shes back can we order the kids food please. are y'all ready to order? no but my husband has a few questions about the food. she doesn't know and cant even give a suggestion. she sees me looking at the 55+ menu and rudely says you have to be of age to order from that and the kid menu. ok i was just looking. thanks for telling me what i can look at in the menu. we get our appetizer and have to flag her down for plates and napkins. we never got any napkins. \\"y'all ready yet' no, so she leaves again....loud talking about how she aint got time for this. so i guess we made her mad. how? i dont know. we planned on racking up a good size tab and paying for our time at her table. i am a server so i also leave outrageous tips because i know how hard it can be working at a place like ihop. so instead we cut our night short and decided not to have dinner. i wanted to just leave. we let our children eat as we listened her talk about us. i also listened to how she spoke to other patrons. very abrupt and leaving them without drinks and asking for food orders as soon as they sit down. somebody needs to train this woman in customer service because it was the worst. the guy Fredrick came to our table i guess to make sure we weren't pissed about anything because she was making it known how horrible we were. we were very upset and very displeased. we asked for our bill ad it was 28.72 if i had exact change i would have left that so she got the change from 30.00 but she deserved absolutely nothing. we were waiting on a cab so we decided to go wait outside so we wouldn't take up any more of her time. as we sat waiting for our taxi the couple who sat a few seats away from us rushed out the door. i asked them if they finished their meal. they said no. i asked if it was because of the service. they said yes. they had left their meals at the table untouched due to this woman's behavior. so Fredrick ran after them asking for payment (LOL) i told him it was the server and he blew me off. i guess that was his friend. the couple did what we wanted to do if we didnt have toddlers with us. just get up and leave. thats a terrible thing if you have people who just want to get up and run away from your establishment because of the people who work there. i will make sure none of my family or friends visit this ihop. i know i will NEVER eat here again."},{"name":"The Original Dinerant","address":"300 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"The menu is awesome and it varies.

I'd recommend this to anyone!\\nStrawberry-rhubarb Cobbler- (this was on a locally sourced fixed menu for the night, thanks to the fantastic waitress we had it without the rest of the fixed menu.)

By no means bad, but was blown away by the rabbit.\\nFried Green Tomatoes- there's a lot to be said for the simplicity of the preparation. I was a big fan of the fried egg and meat (thinly sliced pork of some sort?) that topped the fried/breaded green tomato... My only problem is that the tomato was so sparsely seasoned (very subtle) that the flavor was almost entirely lost... I would've voted these \\"Good\\" if they were able to make the tomato \\"POP\\" out of everything paired with it.\\nWarm Ricotta Cheesecake- Again, another problem with subtlety of flavor... While the texture of the cheesecake was spot on I didn't feel like it was warm enough... also, the fact that it was paired with candied pistachios (which were delicious in their own right), only served to dry the cheesecake out in your mouth.

We almost walked by it without realizing that it was there. And we were looking for it! It is almost like one of those trendy no-name places that you have be in the \\"in\\" crowd to know to get it. Except it really is not. The owner is a really nice Chinese gentlemen who told us that the place has been open for 6 years, and that he has never advertised and he gets a steady stream of regulars. In the couple of hours we were there, I saw that steady stream of Mandarin speaking regulars show up for their meals. Note that this is not really a Korean restaurant, but a Chinese restaurant with some Korean influences. But how good is this place? Their dumplings are really good, and so is their hand-pulled noodles. But we ventured further from this well-known fare and tried the Kim Chee with Tofu dish which was really quite excellent: braised Kim chee with fatty pork paired with silken tofu. We also had the bbq chicken which was also done quite well. The deep fried mackarel is a great starter too: golden crispy met with crunchy edges. But the surprise of the evening was how good the spicy fish soup was. There were big chunky fillets with cabbage kim chee and tofu. It was perfect for a cold rainy night like tonight. One other standout item that probably isn't noticed by most people was how well the white rice was done. You can tell how much a Chinese restaurant cares about preparing its food by the way it prepares its rice. The rice here was piping hot, soft and pillowy. My two year old daughter, who is finicky about what she eats, had multiple servings of the rice. Please do note that this is a small place, and I mean really small. But there is a homey feel to it and what is great is that it is an open kitchen. You can see exactly what is going on in the kitchen and that is rare amongst Chinese restaurants.

And for the love of Boston, I am sharing my two experiences in the City's Lansdowne Pub. \\n\\n   The Lansdowne Pub was the right place at the right time. After seeing the Gogo's perform next store in the House of Blues which is across the street from Fenway Park Home of the Boston Red Sox, we were up for a post concert cold one. In the late hours of a weeknight after the House of Blues cleared up and the vicinity of Fenway Park was a ghost town, we walked a few feet along Lansdowne Street inside a historic building that housed Lansdowne Pub. At this time of night the outside patio seats overlooking Fenway Park and the Green Monster were empty. The Lansdowne Pub that is a happening spot to see bands on weekend nights was practically all ours. In the large dimly lit spaces of the pub we seated ourselves at the end of the long bar that would of been at home in Ireland. \\n\\n   \\"Take pride in your beer.\\" That was what another fairly large beer glass read. Lansdowne Pub seems to be taking pride in their beer with a fairly large selection poured in a relatively large glass. They offer 15 choices of bottle, 12 choices of draft, and 21 choices of cans. Additionally they serve wine. Being in Boston, I went for a draft Sam Adams. After a highly energetic day filled with hiking through the North End, walking around Fenway, and rocking to a Gogos concert, the beer served the purpose of making me sleepy. The quiet and dimly lit pub and restaurant with classic rock playing at a white noise level was making me sleepy. If I had another one I'd probably be dreaming that Sam Adams just walked in the pub. At the time of the sleepy late weeknight visit, we caught a glimpse of their food menu. It was decided that we would return in the afternoon  before the Boston Red Sox verse New York Yankees game. \\n\\n  When we returned to the Landsdowne Pub during the afternoon of the baseball game, it the difference between night and day. The patio seats were filled up with people taking in the crowds of Red Sox fans. A pub and restaurant that had been ours a few nights ago now had a bouncer controlling customer traffic into the door. The long bar was filled and we just managed to get a table. \\n\\n   Let me say a few words about their menu. It is a diverse menu with entrees including fish & chips, macaroni and cheese, oysters, and pan seared salmon.  It is a menu serving sandwiches such as the Pub burger, prime rib, and steak & cheese. The menu also features an all day Irish breakfast. \\n\\n  Right off the bat I was decided on the Pub burger. Do you want to know why? It is because from my experience pubs serve some of the best burgers I have ever savored. This Pub burger might not be up there with the best, however, it was good. Visualizing the plate shaped as a circle, 50% of the portion to the right was the French fries. The bottom left was the lower bun, melted cheddar cheese, and two strips of bacon criss crossed. The top part of the plate was the top bun, tomato, onions, and lettuce. Off the plate all this food tasted good when I was eating it. It tasted better with a glass of Samuel Adams. \\n\\n   For the love of Boston and Yelp, I recommend Landsdowne Pub & Restaurant for a cold one or two before and pub food. It is a convenient spot to do just that in the shadow of Fenway Park and the House of Blues."},{"name":"My Name Is Joe Coffee","address":"503 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"This place is AHmazing.

Time to invest in a pest control company RR."},{"name":"Cha Yen Thai Cookery","address":"613 Mt Auburn St","city":"Watertown","stars":"4.5","text":"My friend was visiting from out of town, and had specifically requested we seek out some top-notch Thai food. Cha Yen has got really consistently good reviews, so we decided to give it a try. Ideally, we were hoping for delivery because the weather forecast had chances of rain and we'd have to walk some stretches to get there, but unfortunately the restaurant only delivers within a 2-mile radius. We ended up making the trip out anyway, but don't bet on delivery if you don't live really close to the restaurant.\\n\\nNow for the food. My friend ordered the fried corn cakes - don't expect cornbread fritters or heavy batter. This appetizer really focuses on the naturally sweet flavor of the corn (it would actually be a great alternative to popcorn; it's a snacking sort of food). I got the chicken satay. You know how it's usually overcooked slivers of chicken breast with a healthy helping of peanut sauce? I was pleasantly surprised to get plump pieces of juicy chicken, not at all dry, and highly flavored.\\n\\nFor entrees, my friend got the Pad See You, lightly spicy. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the sauce well-seasoned (I convinced her to let me steal a bite). I would highly recommend this dish.\\n\\nBecause I'm a sucker for Pad Thai, that's what I got (medium spice). The portion was generous,  and not overwhelmingly sweet like some other Pad Thai's I've had. Once again, the chicken was not overcooked despite being thin slivers of meat - another rarity. There was a savory flavor that I wasn't used to and couldn't identify; maybe it was the dark-skinned tofu (it might have been smoked tofu or 5-spice-rubbed tofu). Very good, and I have plenty of leftovers.\\n\\nPricewise, two appetizers, two entrees, and a thai iced-tea ran us $34 before tip. Not bad at all - I recommend this restaurant if you're in the area."},{"name":"Joy Cafe","address":"1100 Peachtree St NE, Ste 110","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"After a late Friday night all you want is to get some good brunch without waiting too long.\\nWhat did I know when I casually yelped for a good brunch place close to home, that we would be seated within minutes of arriving in spite of being a busy Saturday morning!\\n\\nQuaint little brunch place with a homely feel and amazing food.

This brewery is VERY popular!  Our large party of 13 waited an hour for their big circular table.  I understand there is going to be a LOOONG wait for large parties, especially on a Saturday night (and during Holiday Ale Fest) but I just don't like to wait.  So, I really can't fault them for something out of their control.  But drunk, hungry people waiting to be seated... drinking more beer while they wait... is never a good combo.\\n\\nWhile the beer is great, the food is nothing worth writing home about!

After I placed my order, our server came back to the table to let me know that there was bacon in the mac and cheese and was I OK with that. Um, bacon? YES. TOTALLY ON BOARD THAT TRAIN.

The parents continued to scream loudly as their children were out of control. We asked the waitress if anything else could be done or else we were thinking about leaving. The manager quickly came over and apologized, and said she was doing everything she could to round up the children, but from what I saw she did nothing to address the parents of the children and ask them to lower their voices at all. She just quietly stood behind the children and asked them to be quiet. As you can imagine, with ten year old boys this was not effective. When I say how loud they were, imagine being at a football game after the home team has won and double that noise. We were very finally moved to a quieter area where the chairs were on top of the tables next to our booth, as if this section was closed for the night. Many apologies were provided, but no discount or coupons or anything to apologize for the awful dining experience was provided. It is too bad this happened because the food was actually pretty good, especially the Wild boar sausage, potato pancakes, and butternut squash and mushroom soup. The waitress was also very kind and did what she could in her power to alleviate the situation. The manager, although with good intentions, needs to have more control over the clients in her restaurant, setting ground rules for behavior of large parties, have a soundproof party room, or at least close the restaurant off for a set period of time for large parties so as not to affect the dining experience of those not in the large party. Not sure if we will visit again anytime soon because of this experience."},{"name":"Philly Connection","address":"2328 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Not bad at all for a chain..

He really knows his juices. The taste was amazing and it was chilled perfectly! Definitely didn't have a nasty vegetable taste like some other places. The price was a bit steep at $8, but for tasty, organic cold-pressed juice (more nutritious and not the other pulpy kind), it was well worth it.

Here's a hint, Bukowski's: The reason we put up with the Flo-esque waitresses of diners and other American staple eateries is because we are not paying much for the food, and the food is usually good. When you seemingly insist on hiring bitchy and/or aloof waitresses to service mediocre fare at an unfathomably slow pace AND charge way too much, you go from being a legitimate \\"dive\\" to being a place with just really, really bad service. I don't need to have my girlfriend judged by some hipster waitress wearing a trucker shirt ironically and covered in crappy tats because she orders something \\"uncool\\". And guess what, Ms. Hot Topic? If you refuse to come take my order or give me my check in favor of standing around and talking to your co-workers in an almost empty room or texting your buddies, I'm going to have to get up (cause the music is too loud to call you) and tell you I want to order or to pay. Don't look at me like I sodomized your puppy. Your job is to make sure this stuff happens in a timely fashion, and if you're not going to do it without prompting, I'm going to prompt you. And do something I hardly EVER do: Leave a shitty tip.\\n\\nAnd yes, the music is WAY too loud, people. I go to a place to drink and eat with those I like so I can communicate with them. Your music makes that impossible. I don't care what you like, stop shoving it down my throat at unbearable volume. This is ostensibly a  restaurant, not your Myspace page. And those of you asking yourself if you're too old or just don't \\"get\\" the loud music thing? You're not. You're talking to a guy who spent a good deal of his youth playing in loud bands with charming names like \\"The Pisscubes\\". I'm not a prude. But volume has its place, and that place isn't while I'm trying to eat, drink and be merry with my friends.\\n\\nYour beer selection is admirable. It's also really expensive. I'll just go to Redbones where the selection may be slightly smaller, but is always priced reasonably. And they won't roll their eyes at me if I ask a question or, god forbid, order something the bartender doesn't like.\\n\\nI usually hate cliches, but this place is worthy of it: Avoid it like the plague. Because this place is itself a cliche: mediocre food served by Too Cool For School kids who would rather text message and gossip then take your order. Part of me hopes this place eventually goes under just so the owner can learn a valuable lesson about letting his/her wait staff man his/her investment like it's their own clubhouse. There is a line to be drawn. The original Bukowksi's, despite having the too loud music as well, at least seems staffed by friendly and knowledgeable people. Maybe I've just had 3 bad experiences by coincidence, but when one out of every three reviews talks about how criminally rude and neglectful the service is, you'd think someone might look into it, even if you are packing them in on saturday nights."},{"name":"Ruth's Chris Steak House - Buckhead Atlanta","address":"3285 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Buckhead","stars":"3.5","text":"I must say...I was surprised!

Hello NxNW!\\n\\nUnfortunately, that was probably the most excited I was the whole night, other than when we got home. The food experience as a whole was nothing better than lackluster. Honestly, the whole experience could be described as a poor usage of calorie/carb consumption. We ordered the artichoke dip, calamari, stuffed mushrooms, and the NXNW wings. I also had the house beer and my wife had the margarita that was with the happy hour menu. Our food was delivered surprisingly quickly. As a matter of fact, it was less than 10 minutes until we got all of our food... a little suspicious. \\n\\nAs we started on our many plates, we realized that while the food came out quickly, it also became cold just as quickly. We try to order calamari every restaurant we go because we like it so much, and were extremely disappointed to realize that the calamari was gummy and quite bland save the sauce. The artichoke dip was lukewarm and lacking of any complexity of flavors and tasted just like spinach and artichoke (IMO some cheese would have helped). The \\"crostini\\" that accompanied the \\"dip\\" was literally just bread. It wasn't toasted and it was NOT crunchy. Also, the stuffed mushrooms had a sausage that wasn't bad, but the mushrooms had no flavor outside of the meat inside them.\\n\\nThe only positives we could come up with were that the wait to get seated was extremely short, and that our waitress actually did a stellar job of working all of the happy hour tables and still making us feel welcome.

We're big fans of his. When we met him at a book signing in August, we asked what his favorite restaurant in Atlanta was. He said Canoe. So my husband took me there for our first wedding anniversary. \\n\\nOur experience was out of this world. The atmosphere is elegant; a nice combination of woodsy and high class. They make good use of their position next to the Chattahoochee. We were seated by a window, so I could see the river rushing past as we dined.\\n\\nOur server Christine was excellent. She was very passionate about the menu and knowledgeable about everything on it. The house sommelier recommended a light red wine to go with our meal, which is exactly what Christine suggested.\\n\\nWe started off with a Nutty Sidecar (me) and a Chai Tea (him). The nutty sidecar consisted of grand marnier, amaretto, and citrus. I liked it. I was more surprised at how much I liked my husband's drink. I thought chai tea in a martini-style cocktail sounded awful. But the spice of the chai went really well with the whiskey and mint.\\n\\nOur appetizers were the Kurobuta pork belly with sweet potato fries and apricot mustarda and the house smoked salmon with a crispy potato cake and Vermont goat's cheese. They were delicious. Christine said the pork belly felt like eating bacon pudding to her, and it really did. It just melts in your mouth. It was accompanied by the most interesting garnish: caramelized sage leaves! I loved the salmon so much, my husband let me eat most of it. I practically licked the plate. The salmon was melded to the potato pancake with a layer of cheese in between. Texture played an important role in this dish. The smoky, soft salmon sandwiched with the mild cheese and crispy, salty potato was a real hit.\\n\\nFor our entrees, I ordered the halibut special of the day and my husband had the slow roasted beef short ribs with kohlrabi, red cabbage and chocolate vinegar. The accompanying wine was a 2006 Vietti Langhe Nebbiolo Perbacco. You can probably guess that's an Italian wine. It was really good. My husband doesn't usually drink wine, but he enjoyed it. And I'm so happy that Cobb County now allows re-corking. I'm always hesitant to order an entire bottle of wine because I know I can't finish it, and I don't want to waste it. Now I can take it home with me!\\n\\nOur entrees were to die for. We both ordered the perfect things for us. I wouldn't have enjoyed his as much as he did, and vice versa. My halibut was moist and delicious with a slightly crispy exterior. It was served on a bed of roasted red peppers and snow peas with a citrus-avocado dressing. It was bright and energetic and just what I wanted. My husband's short ribs fell off the bone. We both laughed that they gave him a steak knife to use. He never touched it. His meal was rich and filling, just what he likes. The chocolate vinegar was a nice touch. It added a bit of brightness to an otherwise very rich, heavy entree.\\n\\nDessert was the warm ricotta cheesecake with candied pistachios & meyer lemon, and the old-fashioned granny smith apple pie with sharp cheddar crust and rosemary ice cream. We didn't order these. Canoe sent them to us on the house when they found out it was our wedding anniversary. Both were delicious, but I could hardly touch them! I was so stuffed by that point. The rosemary ice cream was really intriguing. Rosemary can quickly become overpowering, but the chef used only a light touch here. The apple pie was good, but the real winner was the cheesecake. I love ricotta cheesecakes because they are so light and fluffy. This one didn't disappoint.\\n\\nOur experience at Canoe was top-notch. Excellent service, excellent food and an excellent view.

The calamari was my favorite of the appetizers, it was lightly breaded and served with a tasty sriracha-based sauce.  For my entree, I was torn between the Pad Thai and the panang curry.  The server recommended the Pad Thai - his recommendation was spot on, as this was the best Pad Thai I have ever had - a perfect amount of flavorful sauce and generous portion of chicken and shrimp.  I sampled the chicken panang that another person in the party ordered, it was delicious!  Another diner ordered the 3 flavored duck which was also outstanding.  \\n\\nAt the end of our meal, the chef (and possibly owner?) came out to ask us how our meal was.

They have a private room for meetings and other private gatherings with a separate bar. \\n\\nI actually know several bands that play here and have been meaning to catch them there during their residencies, but unfortunately I had missed most of them. Maybe I'll be able to catch one more band before their residency is up.  Speaking of which, they have a pretty sweet set up for bands to play and the acoustics of the place is amazingly awesome. You can't miss a sweet beat no matter where you are in the 'downe even in the private room. \\n\\nThe staff members here are extremely friendly, courteous, and do an excellent job! From servers to bartenders to expediters to host(esse)s, they all deserve a pat on the back for a job well done. They pay attention to details, are cheerful, and ensure that you are taken care of. We also found out that part of the servers training, they must learn the nutritional value (i.e. calories, alcohol content) of each beer on their menu as well as having tasted all the beers! Talk about knowledge is power! These guys don't mess around. \\n\\nWhat I love most about the 'downe is the middle countertop-island seating area right in front of the bar. It's crescent shaped and can seat people on either side, and is located right in between the stage and the bar for those there to enjoy a show. \\n\\nOh and let's not forget the food. Ohhh... the food! The menu here while a lil on the pricey side is sooooo worth every penny. The chips (or fries to us Americans) with cheese is oozing with deliciousness. The chicken bites have a mild kick and perfectly cooked accompanied with a delicious blue cheese buffalo sauce. The warm cheese dip which comes with these amazing homemade potato chips are to die for! \\n\\nAnd if you have some time for a real meal, be sure to try out their Double Cut Pork Chop dinner! It is not only grilled to perfection in a cider pork sauce but it was huge and comes with 2 blue cheese potato cakes. Despite it's size, I devoured the entire plate! \\n\\n\\nJust a Note for the Ladies: There are plenty of restrooms ladies! No need to fear long lines on a crowded evening. They are also clean!

However, they seem a bit unorganized and overwhelmed. My server seemed very unsure of himself as if it was his first day on the job (Perhaps it was) he wasn't sure of the types of coffee they serve, and he did not put out any silverware for us. He brought my son the regular size pancakes and immediately knew it was wrong and brought them back to the chef. The Owner (I think it was the owner) brought over the correct pancakes to my son and also gave us the full size order to keep as well. He apologized and we extremely nice and friendly. \\n\\nThese pancakes were so delicious that I overlooked the mistakes that were made. My son LOVED them, and I ended up eating half of the full-size order because they were so good. light and fluffy, with a crispy caramelized chocolate chip speckle. \\n\\nThe eggs Benedict were equally as good. The hollandaise sauce had a unique texture to it and a mild flavor. The ham slices were thick and the eggs cooked perfectly on top of a crunchy english muffin. The home fries were just ok. They were crispy with a unique flavor. I think they may have been frozen and got freezer burn because a few bites tasted kinda funky.\\n\\nThis place has only been open for a few months, so I think they are still working out the kinks. this place is destined for greatness.

Also, they like to turn the music up to deafening levels, so if you go there for dinner you might just end up unable to see or speak to the friends you're with.  Really chaps my hide.

Off we went to Salsa's. From Andrew Square, the walk is pretty much straight down Dorchester St. towards Broadway and helps work up an appetite (not to mention is some good exercise after massive calorie intake!).\\n\\nUpon entering, I looked around and realized we were the only patrons there. Usually this rubs me the wrong way, but I figured it may have simply been an off time (3pm), which our server, Jen, confirmed. Apparently Salsa's experiences a large lunch rush closer to noon and stays relatively quiet until dinner. If you don't like crowds, come for a late lunch.\\n\\nSince it was only us, my boyfriend and I had our choice of seating. We ended up at a high table in the front  area which has large windows that open onto the street - a perfect location for a warm day. \\n\\nChips and salsa reached the table immediately upon seating. The chips left much to be desired, as I had hoped for warm, fresh tortilla chips and received something that tasted like a generic bag from the grocery store dumped into a basket - a little too thick and slightly stale tasting. The salsa was quite good however - not too runny, not too chunky, and with mild heat. We asked for a second helping to add atop our entr√©es and Jen happily obliged.\\n\\nBeing tucked away in the corner with the sun shining on me felt refreshingly intimate and the Classic Margaritas we ordered helped to make it feel like we were somewhere far more exotic than Southie. I highly recommend the Classic Margarita. It is huge! The first margaritas were so delicious we each ordered a second. I tried Mango the second time, which tasted equally delicious to the Classic. In retrospect, I would say one margarita is plenty!\\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the Steak Burrito Grande and I ordered the Vegetarian Burrito Grande, both on flour tortillas. Each was quite good. His steak was lean and I appreciated the veggie mixture in my burrito (they use actual crunchy veggies like broccoli and not just filler items like beans and rice). The greatest part was when Jen brought out Salsa's homemade hot sauce - amazing! I inquired about the ingredients and was told it mainly consists of chipotle peppers + \\"special\\" items. Whatever they are, the flavor is delicious! As a hot sauce fan, I slathered this goodness all over my burrito. Just be careful, the heat creeps up and stays with you a good while, but the burn is pure love. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I returned for lunch a second time today. We arrived earlier than the last time and found the place empty once again (a little disconcerting). This time we sat at one of the lower, main tables as there was someone installing ceiling fans and blocking the front area (kind of a bummer since it was a sunny day and it would have been nice to sit by the windows).\\n\\nJust like the first visit, we were immediately greeted with (mediocre) chips and salsa to munch on while we decided our order. My boyfriend got the Classic Margarita, which was just as delicious as the first time - points for consistency! To eat he ordered the Pork Tinga Chimichanga, which came with a crunchy veggie medley, black beans, and rice. I thought the veggie medley was a nice touch and wished my meal came with the same. He liked the flavor of his Tinga and enjoyed the Chimi's crunchy, cheesy goodness. I ordered the Tacos de Pescado with black beans and rice. I can't say I enjoyed the tacos very much. When I order fish tacos, I normally expect some fried fish, spicy or tangy crema, & crunchy slaw. These fish tacos had none of the above. Although I knew they would be different based on the menu, I thought they would still be tasty. However, inside three soft, flour tortillas was a mushy mixture of overcooked mahi mahi chunks, cooked tomatoes (almost stewed tasting), garlic, & black olives. It pretty much tasted like slightly fishy, tomato goop wrapped in a tortilla. I was mostly disappointed with the lack of fish (especially for $13.95) in the tacos and especially with the fact it was diced into tiny chunks and not whole filets. It was pretty obvious they were trying to either: a. get rid of fish scraps, b. trying to use the minimal amount of fish possible in order to make a higher profit, or c. both. There was also no textural difference which made the tacos even more bland. I was eating the tacos and thinking of my veggie burrito from previous.\\n\\nOverall, Salsa's is a decent place to go for a lazy lunch albeit a bit pricey for what you receive. I'll be back for the margaritas, fun music, and good service (Jen and Katie are super cute, friendly, and both make a great margarita)! If you have a hankering for something more authentic and don't mind a minimal (if even available) seating area, make the hike down Dorchester Avenue and hit up Taqueria Casa Real for a real hole-in-the-wall. The prices are cheaper and the food is tastier."},{"name":"Du Kuh Bee","address":"12590 SW 1st St","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Korean style hand pulled noodles.

Ever since, we have had great experiences there.  Probably have been there at least 10 times. \\n Food is good and wait times are similar to other casual style restaurants.  Usually in and out the door in about 45 min.  We liked going there because it is close for us and has good food. \\n\\nTonight, was a different story. It took nearly 15 min for us to actually get our orders placed and receive drinks after the usual quick, \\"Hi how are you doing? What can I get you to drink\\"  She said she even recognized us from a previous visit.  When delivering our drinks, she gave some excuse, about her swipe card not working and that's why it took so long.  Then another 45 minutes passed.  After watching all 3 of the tables near us receive their food (all of which were seated after us), and 2 of which finish and pay for their food despite the fact that they were seated at least 10 min after us, we got up and left.  We asked our waitress about 5 min prior to leaving how much longer was it going to be, and she apologized saying that they were \\"how should I say, understaffed\\" (her words, not mine).  And she said they would discount our food.  Keep in mind that the three tables around us didn't experience any problem with them being understaffed.  And there seemed to be the usual amount of staff to me. Including a second waitress who I overheard taking the orders of the tables who actually received their food because she was helping Nicolette (our waitress) out.  We had our 2 year old with us and given that it was an hour wait from the time we walked in the door and we still had not received our food, we left.  We let our waitress know that we were doing so and why. I'm pretty sure that our order was never put in, or was put in very late.  Thankfully we only ordered water to drink.  We weren't asking for anything free or any discounts or anything.  All we wanted was an explanation of why we weren't getting our food when everyone around us was and when we were actually going to get our food.  So we went to Five Guys around the corner.  Better burgers and quicker service.   \\n\\nIt will be a VERY long time before we decided to go back to Hop Jack's because of this experience.

The menu was pre selected and you had no choices on all 4 courses.  \\n\\nThe first course was a greek salad shooter which was exactly what it sounded like.  One 3 oz shooter cup arrived with what appeared to be a cucumber juice with pieces of olives and cucumber in it,  once gulp it was gone.  Not much of a starter.  \\n\\nSecond we got some Albuquerque Tuna which I thought was awesome.  My friend didn't care for raw fish so I ate hers.  There was about an ounce of fish.  \\n\\nThird course was a green pepper stuffed with orzo pasta in a tomato sauce. The chicken on top probably weighed 2 oz.  The orzo and green pepper were just warm and bordering cold.  The orzo was also way over  done and the green pepper was cooked way too much. The chicken was hot but very small with the bone in.  \\n\\nForth course was a sliver of chocolate cake about 2 inches wide and 1.5 inches high.  It was topped with a chocolate icing.

On our plate was a wedge of iceberg lettuce with a few slivers of strawberries on top with some nuts. I'm not a fan of wedge salads in general as I feel like it makes the customer do all the work. We pictured more of a leafy green salad instead of iceberg. Once the dressing was added it was edible, but still a disappointment. \\n\\nFor the main course we ordered the belt line burger. This is where they redeemed themselves! Garlic gator tots came on the side and were simply divine. The burger was perfectly juicy and cheesy, topped with caramelized onions. For dessert we split the warm chocolate cake. The salted caramel ice cream that came on the side was DELICIOUS. I could have just eaten that but the scoop was very small.

I am giving a 2 star because when I went for dinner the food was 4 star. The brunch looked amazing so we had some guest from out of town and we wanted to take them to brunch there since we could all walk. Our friends were also going to meet us there. So there were 8 of us total. We got there   around 1230 on a Sunday. Now please Dont get me wrong, we know bunch in Austin you have to wait and we are fine with that to a point. We got there and got to the host and told there there were 8 of us. She said that they have one table that would fit 8 of us and a party of 7 just sat down in the only booth that would seat 8. She said it would be a two hour wait. And I was shocked. I looked around and there were 4 two seated tables and a 4 top that were all lined up with no one seating in them. There were no other people on the wait list. The only ones that were there were a couple of booths, a 4 top and 2 two tops and the big booth. The rest were empty. It was not busy, like I said before there was no one on the wait list and she did not say they were reserved or had reservations. And I know this because I asked the girl if she can just put them together and she told me know. The only way she would ever seat a party of 8 is if we had reservations or the booth was empty. So we started walking out to the butcher side to see how long the booth would be. And yes they just sat down. So I went to one of the waitress and asked. Is there any reason why we can't push  two of the two tops next to the 4top since there is no one here.  I was amazed by her response, She said we can't do that, we can't push tables together, it messes up the kitchen and the flow of the kitchens cooking?  And at that point I had it and was frustrated. And we left.\\nHow is it a restaurant flow of the kitchen would get messed up because they pushed tables together and the were to cook for 8 people. Is that not the point of a restaurant? Dont they cook for people? We were treated poorly and it amazes me that they would treat people like that when it is slow. I would not be making this post if they were busy, I would understand that. But they weren't. Empty tables all over. As a neighbor it is going to take a lot to get me to consider this place again even if the food is good. Not only that but their menu is not cheap and we all were planning on drinking. So they lost out on a huge tab.

Service and dessert, as I will elaborate below, are phenomenal.\\n\\nWe ordered a nice starter of kangaroo, which was actually less gamey than I thought it would be. It was quite tender and paired with a zesty sauce. Later we ordered the veal ribeye and the rabbit. The rabbit I felt was well done but slightly dry... and the portion size wasn't too much (then again these types of restaurants can't expect that much). The taste was good but for the price level, there was much more to be expected. The veal ribeye was quite un-chewable. The taste was fine but the majority of it was pretty hard to work through. We had that swapped for the swordfish, which was way better. It was incredibly tasty, however still didn't make up all the way for the earlier ribeye. Maybe the day I went was an off day! \\n\\nWe finished the night with chocolate grotto. This, despite the difficulty cracking the shell of chocolate, was actually my favorite dish in the entire meal.

The hostess was unapologetic and basically just said \\"we are very busy.\\" I understand that it was packed, but it is unacceptable to make a table wait an hour after their reservation with no warning that it would be THAT delayed. We were all starving, and had to cancel our after-dinner plans because we were running so late with dinner. \\n\\nThen, all the service from there on out was rushed.

Our waitress Kayleigh was very helpful in deciding what we wanted. I had always wanted to try a bison burger so today I give it a shot Kayleigh suggested that I get it medium or medium well done.  After having it I would absolutely agree with her that medium well would have been the way to go.   Mine was a little undercooked at medium. I managed just fine. On the bites that were medium well cooked with that little bit of char was a great bite the bites that had a little bit of red or overly pink to them not so much I would definitely recommend trying it if you've never had a bison burger before. It does tend to be a little gamey tasting although some people say it's not , don't let them fool you it is.   Was it worth $15 probably not but then again it's better than going to your local Pow Wow and getting a bison burger that's been boiling in water for a couple years and still spending ten bucks for it. Now the wife she had the Cod sandwich and seem to enjoy it. Like I've said in past reviews she's kind of strange she likes buffalo sauce on it and she really enjoyed their buffalo sauce and she believes that the buffalo sauce was probably homemade .  One thing I would have suggested for my bison burger would have been maybe a garlic aioli to go with it but anyways, back to her Cod Burger she really enjoyed it it was decent size to get her to eat fish anywhere but the Old Bag of Nails is kind of a chore and she really enjoyed this so that's a plus for them. The bathrooms were very clean they were also unisex so be aware of your surroundings , be polite and clean up after yourself.  One really weird experience was Kayleigh brought my wife a drink when hers was only half-full half empty whatever kind of person you are and she rarely ever goes through a drink I'm usually the one that has four five drinks LOL.  They seem to have a decently stocked bar with roughly 12 to 15 beers on tap.  Growlers were available I'm not sure how much they were.  I'm sure you could call for a price list they also seem to be pretty well stocked on wines I'm sure a few of them were local ones.  \\n   Pricey food is fine as long as it's good and good service follows. Here you had both. To me $32 for hamburger fries and soda and fish sandwich fries and soda is a little pricey.

I rarely remember the names of waiters, but he was so good I couldn't forget him.

Don't be frightened off by the idea of eating rabbit. It doesn't taste too much different than most poultry and it is so delicious. The star were the chard and bacon ravioli. Oh my gosh.

And they trick you with a candle that's not really a candle! It feels like a candle and it smells like vanilla, but the wick is a WIRE and it's mechanically operated with a little switch in the bottom! So there is no way anyone could knock over the candle and set the curtains on fire. Great idea, Ruth Chris! \\n\\nFor drinks, I ordered the Perfect Margarita - made with Patron silver, Grand Marnier, lime juice and simple syrup. It was perfectly delicious and should be for its cost - $14. My girlfriend ordered a limeade that came looking like tropical punch and garnished with a cherry, but surprise, surprise - it tasted like limeade! How the bartender did it, we do not know. I mean, limeade is supposed to be green, right? \\n\\nFor dinner, I had the bone-in ribeye and creamed spinach. My friend ate light with the calamari and part of the creamed spinach. I ordered my steak medium - pink but not bloody. Like another reviewer, my steak continued to cook after it arrived because of the sizzling plate service and so by the time I was halfway through it, it was cooked well and dried out. However, when it first arrived, it was delicious and juicy. The creamed spinach was yummy, but I did need to add salt; however it's better to add salt than have a dish be over-salted. \\n\\nFor dessert, we both ordered the warm apple crumb tart which was so good I wanted to put my face in it. I love baked Granny Smith apples, and they were cooked perfectly with brown sugar and love (as much love as a restaurant can give). The serving size is deep dish and the crust holds up nicely under the ice cream. \\n\\nAlthough I didn't formally complain about my steak (I don't complain about a meal unless it's terrible), my server asked and I explained how the steak had continued to cook until it was dry. During our dessert (and my second Perfect Margarita), the manager, Shaun, came by and mentioned that our server, Andrea, had told him about my steak. I admitted that I'd eaten half of it but chose not to eat the rest and that I would adjust my order understanding the sizzling plate service better. But he said I wouldn't have to do that and if I had mentioned it earlier, they would have gotten me a fresh steak - now that's SERVICE. He also comped my dessert and my second Perfect Margarita. That's even better SERVICE. \\n\\nIf I could give this restaurant 4.5 stars, I would. I would give it 5 if it wasn't in a hotel and had its own parking lot.

I ordered the Waldorf Salad, with grilled shrimp. I was very dissapointed in the way it was served.  A high sided bowl making it very difficult to eat also the dressing had little flavor.

I have frequented many of these establishments within the group, numerous times, holding an Ultimate Dining Card, which touts VIP treatment to its holders. What a crock of crap that is! It certainly did not hold squat at Bistro Niko.\\n\\nTo start off, getting a table without reservations on a Saturday night wasn't a problem, which was a plus. The host got a table ready for us while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. While we waited we got our drinks going but had to ask for bread to snack on. Wasn't a big deal but certainly not VIP treatment. \\n\\nOnto our orders....everyone's dishes looked good, including mine. I ordered one of the specials of the evening, the Maine Cod atop spinach and baby beets. Beautiful presentation....I took a bite of the baby beets first to get my palate going. It was tender crisp, just like I like it, and slightly sweet. I was happy. Then I took my first bite of the fish......step on the brakes! I nearly spit it out because of the bad ammonia smell coming from the first bite. But I didn't want to gross anyone out so I swallowed, ugh. I thought I was dreaming! No way can this be served from such a fine establishment, a Buckhead Life Restaurant group establishment no less! Couldn't believe it so I asked the others in my party to smell my fish. They all agreed....it was bad fish. So back it went. Waitress apologized offhandedly and asked if I wanted something else. The manager never came to apologize nor offer to comp my meal.

It could be the non-hipster version of Carabar - a much-needed venue! Best idea I've had all year! :) Most of the critiques of the former Vic's say it tries to be too many things at once - and I certainly agree. Rock bar, guys. Stick with it. \\n\\nThe new incarnation of Vic's is a sleek, dark, and well-decorated cafe/bar that makes an excellent venue for mind-numbing rock. The patio is great (cept I kept getting rained on last night, argh - the tiki hut was no help, either, it just aided and abetted the rain), and the second room could easily be opened up for larger shows or, like last night, it is good for the band and their guests to chill in. \\n\\nI've been here during the day and wasn't impressed - I agree that service was slow and food was meh. I think if the food improved, Andres, the owner, could stick with the schnitzel and whatnot, and it would make for good bar food. I don't think The Shrunken Head holds up as a cafe on it's own with the daytime food and service  - stick with the nightlife scene, I say. \\n\\nI was quite impressed by the $3 Le Fin du Monde special, and of course had to represent with one of my people's beers (Vive Quebec!). The bartenders were efficient and friendly. The bands ruled. Everything about last night was so, so good... I just really hope to see Andres and Kristy stick with this genre of kick-ass-ness. Oh and sorry, Maya C., I think they should stick with the metal/rock on the speakers as well. \\\\m/"},{"name":"OSAKA Japanese Sushi & Steak House","address":"14 Green St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"I have been there multiple times now both comments are related to the Hibachi area:\\n\\nThe first time I went there, they had hair in 2 of the dishes of my friends that were sitting next to me, The hair didn't match ours at all.

We also had the special blue crab soup, and that was very good.\\n\\nEntrees:\\nRack of Lamb - absolutely amazing and the best dish there.  Flavorful and perfectly cooked\\nSteak - a bit salty with the seasoning, but still tasty.\\nRabbit - we read reviews that the meat fell off the bone, but it was not the case on our entree.  The flavor was ok, nothing spectacular.\\nCod - a nice big piece of fresh fish. not much flavor though if you just eat the fish, it's the sides and compliments that made the taste.\\nDuckling - there must be a big difference between duck and duckling, because it did not taste anything like duck and it was just not good.  The meat was very chewy and not that flavorful, and worst yet, the person who got the entree got super sick the next day with very bad stomach aches.\\n\\nWe noticed that all of the dishes were on the overly-salty side.\\n\\nDesserts:\\nWe had 3 birthday celebrations (for the day we were there, a week later, and a month later), but no free dessert what so ever.\\n\\nPopcorn Ice Cream - super yummy\\nCheesecake - very tasty\\nCreme Brulee - pretty standard\\nOrange and Cranberry Bread Pudding - I think this is the first time I did not finish a bread pudding.  The orange taste was just too strong and I didn't find it too tasty.\\nChocolate Grotto - amazing taste, and not too sweet, but still goes very well with a glass of milk (which they will bring you if you ask)\\n\\nOverall it was a good dining experience, and it was good to visit, even if it's just once."},{"name":"Umi","address":"3050 Peachtree Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Love dining at Umi.

I thought it would be kind of quiet at that hour, but I viewed it as a good omen that we were in for a good meal.  After sitting down, things went nowhere but downhill.  I'll spare the painstaking details, but our meal took nearly 2 hours even though we ordered only 6 items from their \\"tapas\\" style menu.  The service was sooo slooow that each item was brought out in 10-15 min increments, leaving us with 5-10 mins of downtime before our next dish.  Remember, we started at 9pm so it was close to 11pm when all 6 dishes were complete.  I don't mind a small wait here or there, but this was simply ridiculous.  The servers were nice and apologetic, but the foul was a little too egregious for me to forgive and forget.\\n\\nAs for the food, I'd rate it just above average.  Not bad, but certainly not fantastic.  There's good variety on the menu and the sake list is extensive, but all I keep thinking about is our 2 hour dinner and how unacceptable it was.

The food here was great, the service was attentive, and we all enjoyed sitting outside on the patio in the evening.\\n\\nHaving just had lots of beer, none of us opted for alcohol--I got a Thai iced tea with the whipped cream (and I would probably get it next time without the whip; it was just a little too much) and my friends got sodas. \\n\\nBut we weren't really here for the drinks; we were here for the FOOD! \\n\\nFirst off, I ordered curry mashed potatoes to start and my friend got roti canai to start too. They were both fantastic. Just a few minutes after we ordered, the potatoes and roti came out and we tore into them. Both were hot and fresh and the curry was savory but not super spicy. We all agreed we'd order both of these dishes again multiple times. The roti especially were superb: flaky, hot, and excellent dipped in the side of curry sauce. The ratio was a little off--it came with two roti and a fairly full bowl of curry, so for three people there was a little too much curry and not enough roti. But it looks like from others' reviews that you can order extra roti perhaps. We might try that next time.\\n\\nFor the mains, I ordered mee goreng, my husband stir-fried udon, and our friend some kind of noodles with duck (I can't remember the name of his dish but I think it was the curry duck noodles). All were great--again, hot, fresh, came out quickly, and nicely seasoned and garnished, but the standout dish was the udon. They were smoky and seasoned so well, with large chunks of meat and soft noodles. I am definitely getting the udon again when I come back. My mee goreng was pretty good and had lots of peanuts for garnish with lime on the side, as well as nice pieces of shrimp and potato in it, but it was actually even better the next day, oddly.

These are not fried, mind you, but I still feel 6 wings for $11 is overpriced (but the wings were good, and the chili lime was flavorful).\\n\\nThe Rueben, evidently... the meat was roasted the night before. It's quite possibly the best Rueben I've had in a long time. Perfectly toasted, and the flavors balanced - it wasn't busting with sauerkraut, it wasn't drenched in dressing, and the bread wasn't toasted to where it feels like it was cutting my mouth up. Got it with broccoli, since I decided to get wings. It's broccoli, they didn't jazz it up, or anything :)\\n\\nI'm one stop in.

I kept hearing about it, so when my best friend came into town I immediately knew where I was going to take her for dessert. When I walked in, it had a new; fresh; clean; and everything white feel. I had to make sure I didn't spill a drink or make a mess out of my choice of dessert because it was something that would definitely be noticeable. Not that I wanted to be my clumsy Hana self though, but I would definitely advise not to bring your child here. The layout and decorations of the bakery/cafe were very cute- I loved the brick wall right behind the counter. The tables were all wooden and kind of too close to each other, so I wouldn't suggest you go here with a big group. I caught myself looking down at what I was wearing when I entered the bakery/cafe, because it definitely not like the typical hippie; laid back; young feel I find at Brickstore or Victory's (which is also located in Decatur Square). I had to make sure I was dressed properly and nicely because of the clean and white feel the bakery/cafe gave off, I felt like you couldn't enter dressed down or with a casual  t-shirt on. \\nI ordered a berry macaron (pictured below) and an almond macaroon, which I split with my friend. Apparently there is a difference between the two: a macaron is the French version of the delicacy and a macaroon is the American version of the delicacy. They were both so tasty and surprisingly for both items the total was just $4 and some change! I was anticipating a much higher price, so I was pretty happy about that. \\n\\nThe service was great too. The guy who helped us was very friendly and knew how to explain every dessert they had to offer. It's always nice to enter a place where people have a smile on their face. :) \\nAnd a sidenote: You pay after you eat, not immediately after you order. \\nOverall, I give this a 4 star rating because I don't like that I feel like I have to wear something fancy or upscale to buy a cookie or macaroon.

They also brought me my own birthday dessert which was such a thoughtful touch! We also went outside on the deck for a bit and the views of the city were spectacular. I really had so much fun.\\nThe only downfall, and unfortunately it is a big one, is that they need to come up with a better system for the buffet. We got seats right next to the buffet table which we thought was awesome at first because we were one of the first tables called up to it, but boy were we wrong. Once we sat down with our food, a huge line formed for the buffet right next to our table. This means we had peoples' butts in our faces while we were sitting down trying to eat and they were standing in line. Did you get that? Here, let me repeat it. We had peoples' BUTTS in our FACES while we were EATING. Yeah. Seriously unpleasant. And this lasted for 45 MINUTES. Not to mention people in line were being so nosy and would be standing over us looking down at our food and say things like, \\"Oooo, what do they have?\\" We had absolutely no privacy for those 45 minutes and couldn't even hold a conversation. That was one of the most uncomfortable things I ever experienced. Also, my boyfriend was drinking and felt like they weren't putting very much alcohol in their drinks for what they were charging.\\nLuckily, though, the rest of the night made up for those down falls and like I said earlier, I had a great time.

The wings there are seriously the best I've had in Austin - sweet/spicy/hot and crispy.  They almost measure up to my favorite bar wings of all time from back-in-the-day Reno but I digress.  Then, I got the burger with huntsman cheese (mix of bleu and cheddar) and garlic fries.   There was nothing wrong with that meal, except the fact that I would have LOVED a smaller option than a half lb burger.  It worked out though, everything got eaten by someone.  The fries are to die for - if you love garlic, seriously, give them a try.  Now!  Do it! \\n\\nThen the waitress asked if I liked chocolatey, creamy, or fruity, and I protested I was full but my tablemates answered chocolate-y for me.  Next came free desert in the form of chocolate love with berries all over it.  I think it was a brownie with some ganosh on top.  Whatever it was, it took 3 of us to defeat it.  My friend is not a chocolate fan, but loved it and said it went really well with his beer.\\n\\nThe tab wasn't exactly cheap, but it was all worth it.

Here, though, for me this wasn't the case.  Out of all the dim sum entrees I ate, my favorite was the chicken feet.  They were big and the sauce tasted good.  The thing is, I usually don't eat chicken feet.  I ate them this time because I was hungry and there really wasn't anything else I liked.  The beef meatballs were small and didn't have a great texture.  The tripe was okay, but definitely not something that stood out.  I really disliked the steamed roast pork bun - the meat didn't taste good and the bread was hard.  Pork spare ribs were so-so.  The sesame balls with red bean paste were decent.  Turnip cakes were also decent, but not remarkable.\\n\\nDessert was also a disappointment.  I ordered a mango pudding in hopes of satisfying my appetite, but I wasn't pleased.

(We'll get back to that in a minute.)\\n\\nThis place is awesome from open until close every day.  The wide array of unique beer selections alone make this place worth a visit, but the food and the atmosphere of an outdoor German beer festival makes Banger's a must do for me every time I come to Austin.  Although our server of preference is Isaac, all of their servers are friendly and extremely knowledgeable of the menu and can help you pair the right beer to the food you order.  Being more of a traditionalist I've had both the Bratwurst and the Bockwurst during my daytime visits and they exceeded my expectations in presentation and taste.  The menu has many unique choices that are seasonal as well as other options for those who prefer to go meatless or are on a diet.  \\n\\nThe late night menu shifts over into what I like to refer to as \\"drunk food\\" but with a Banger's twist that doesn't disappoint both in creativity and flavor.  If you are not sure of what to get the Fried Mac and Cheese Balls, they are great.\\n\\nNow, back to the Sunday Brunch.  If you are looking for some Sunday Funday fun then Banger's is the place.  The brunch menu is as everything else excellent and you really can't go wrong with any choice you make.  Whatever you choose, be sure to add on a side of Banger's famous 1/2 pound Bacon Steaks to your order (unless you order the kitchen sink, which comes with it), these massive, half-inch strips of bacon are cured in-house and will ruin you forever on the regular thin-sliced bacon you get in the store and at every other restaurant in the world.  They come with a secret house-made dip that enhances the flavor and just knocks it out of the ballpark.  If you aren't getting behind the wheel for a while, Banger's brunch offers a build-your-own Michelada bar for $1.50 more on your beer as well as the pride of brunch the one-liter \\"Manmosa\\"  If you are a Chiver visiting Austin on the weekend, Sunday brunch should be a must before heading out of town as there are regularly Chivers from all over the area there to partake and have a good time.\\n\\nBanger's does a really good job of re-creating an Octoberfest-style atmosphere in a way that fits Austin and is inviting for both the local and the tourist alike.

I arrived to meet some friends on a mid morning after having gone out the night before. \\n\\nFrom the exterior, this place is pretty cool. Being on Rainey it is a hop, skip and a jump from 6th and my hotel. It kind of reminded me of Eastside and other bars in Denton. Just more compressed. \\n\\nThe gimmick here is the \\"Manmosa,\\" which is a huge stein of mimosa that is intended to be consumed by one person and uses a whole bottle of champagne. Someone sitting down a ways from me (it is open bench style seating) said there is a limit of 1 per customer. I don't know if that is true, but I believe it.\\n\\nWhen I arrived there was no hostess up front. I walked back to find my friends. I found them, and there was ample seating. There was a live bluegrass band too. They were really good, but as another reviewer stated, it is VERY LOUD. A little too much.\\n\\nI sat by my friends and the waitress approached. I am a very friendly guy, and have been a server before. Also, I had some grace for the waitress because it was very busy and loud. \\n\\nShe passed me a couple of times, and when she did for a 5th time I said \\"Good morning, might I have a menu when you get the chance? No hurries.\\" Then she flashed RBF and said:\\n\\n\\"I don't know if you were sat here by a hostess or just walked up yourself ir what, but we are on a wait and we don't just seat ourselves here.\\"\\n\\nI began to explain, but she interuppted saying:\\n\\n\\"We are busy on Saturdays and I know you were meeting your friends, but...\\" \\n\\nSo I interuppted and said, \\"I get that, no sweat. I can head up front and wait for a hostess.\\" I spoke in a kind tone.\\n\\nShe said, \\"No, I just realized that if you do that you will wait 2 hours and they will seat you far away so here is a menu and I will do you this favor.

We found a groupon for a massage and thought that sounded wonderful after 12 hours of travel. We arrived for our 11am appointment and were told they would get one of us in a few minutes (they only have one massage therapist on Sundays, so we were booked back to back). My colleague left to grab a bite to eat and I sat down to wait. At about 11:10, the receptionist came to tell me that something had happened and the massage therapist was not going to be  there for about 15-20 more minutes. I explained to her that we were on a schedule but she brushed it off and offered to show me to the lounge in the spa, which was just a nook with 2 arm chairs nestled amongst rows of dark hallways. I waited about 25 minutes and went back to the desk to inquire on any updates. They still did not know when she was going to arrive, and offered to give us gift certificates for a later date. I explained that we were from out of town, as well as quickly running out of time. The woman at the desk went to get who I assumed was the manager, as she was deferential to him from there on. I explained to him that we would likely need to cancel since our schedule did not allow us to rebook. He continued to offer me free saunas, wine etc without seeming to hear that it was no longer going to work for us. I felt like I was negotiating with a used car salesman who wasn't going to take no for an answer. \\n\\nAt this point it was 11:55 and the massage therapist walked in. I don't want to sound as though I regularly judge a book by its cover but, having spent time as a spa and health club manager, I do have a standard for cleanliness and professional appearance for anyone I am going to allow to have their hands all over my body and this therapist was nowhere near this threshold - mismatched and skimpy clothing, way too much make up and perfume and dirty hands. To be frank, she looked like she had come straight from an all night bender. I reminded them that we had less than hour before we needed to leave and told them I needed to speak with my colleague.

If I'd rated it back then they would be getting 5 stars, hands down. \\n\\nAfter such an amazing evening I was eager to bring more friends to try it out. As an event planner I work on a volunteer basis for my local alumni chapter. We decided to walk the beltline and have brunch at the City Winery. After a month of emailing back and forth with the City Winery event planner (where they tried to force us to sign a contract stating we would spend $500 or pay the difference) I was very frustrated. I tried explaining that we didn't need a private room, wouldn't be offering valet, and didn't need access to A/V equipment. All we wanted was brunch. She then passed me on to a manager for the dining room who told me it was their policy to sign a contract for a party of more than 20 because we would be taking up so much of their dining room and serving staff. At this point my co-chair took over and managed to get us a regular booking (she's obviously magical). Listen, I get the policy but if 20 people are showing up at your restaurant to spend money just take their damn money. Don't make it so complicated. \\n\\nWhen we arrived we were greeted very rudely by three employees who asked if we would be dining in shifts. While our original booking was for 24 only 18 people showed up for the event. As a planner and former waitress I understand the frustration of fluctuating numbers but, I can't control who RSVPs  and who actually shows. Once we were seated and ordered one of our waiters mentions to me \\"By the way we can't split checks for a party of this size.\\" Excuse me? I explained that I'd been emailing with representatives of the restaurant and at NO POINT did anyone mention that. Their reason for not splitting checks? It takes too long to process. Nope, not gonna fly buddy. Our other server bravely swooped in to bear the burden of processing time (props to Erica) and prevented my rage from escaping all over the restaurant. \\n\\nOur food arriving didn't make anything better. The burgers three of us ordered were cooked wrong with one being completely inedible. Two other people had to ask for their side to be brought out a couple of times. The one who's burger was served Rare instead of medium rare sent her's back to be cooked longer. When she got her second burger it was more raw than the first. The manager comped her meal but it didn't make up for the terrible experience. (Also the burgers are served with 4 steak fries.....)\\n\\nI will never come back to this restaurant. From start to finish it was terrible. The food is way too pricey ($15 for a burger and $14 for Sangria). While the servers we had were phenomenal it didn't make up for the lack of hospitality shown to us by the rest of the staff. \\n\\nAt one point a member of our party went to the bathroom and there was an employee in there with the door unlocked.

Its getting a full four star endorsement however, strictly on its astonishing 100+ tap beer selection. \\n      A large part of the endorsement is actually on the strength of just once of these beers, which is the freaky-wacky type of experimental brew that many hate, but I often love, at least until I OD on them and can't drink any more.  The polarizing factor of this beer was evident in the bartenders warning before I ordered it, basically letting me know it wasn't for everyone.  It was a brand new offering from a likewise new brewery that was described as a pumpkin-chili rauchbier, or \\"smoked beer\\" which I believe is smoked in a manner similar to BBQ.  It brilliantly and deliciously suggests the flavor of that pumpkin chili you find in legit taquerias in areas where legit taquerias exist.  I wish I could tell you all the name of this beer but I forgot the brewery as well as the beers name, and both are apparently so new/small/regionally available, that a google search of \\"pumpkin chili rauchbier didn't yield any viable results whatsoever.

The last produce vendor left in the late 80's/early 90's. When I worked in the marketplace, I would sometimes buy their fruit cups for lunch.  Today, in the food court here are some local vendors left notably Pizzeria Regina, and Paul Marks Cheese Company, although the turnover here always was and continues to be steady.  In the summer with tourists, it is wall to wall packed with people, and not for the faint of heart. There is limited seating/stand up benches for eating in the rotunda on both levels and the marketplace's management company cut into it by leasing some interior retail space to uniqlo.

Speaking of the wines, none of them were particularly great, the glasses were overpriced, and the pours were not generous. For example, they have Chateau Thivin C√¥te de Brouilly for $16 a glass. That is a perfectly acceptable $20 bottle of French wine, but nothing to write home about and certainly not worth $16 a glass. The food was slightly better than I had anticipated given our experience thus far. (Did I mention our server asked if we were ready to order dessert before we placed our entr√©e orders?) But again, nothing to write home about, especially at $18-$25 a plate. The menu lacked any creativity or innovation. After dinner we went to the \\"speakeasy\\". The service was decent there and the space was cute. Ultimately, however, I would recommend going to Ticonderoga Club for substantially better cocktails and atmosphere, without the hokey password. Coincidentally, we had dinner at Leon's Full Service the night before for the exact same price, but a far superior experience with craft cocktails and amazing wine."},{"name":"Blenders and Bowls - Downtown","address":"206 E 4th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious acai bowls, we just had to wait quite a while on a Sunday morning.

I definitely love a great meal- and the menu looked great. My friend and I came in late last Friday night, and started with a round of cocktails in the bar. The drinks, espresso martinis, were pretty delicious. We were seated at a table about a half hour later and both ready to eat. \\n\\nOur waiter came to the table, we had brought in our own bottle of wine(Chappellet Prichard Hill Cab 07-WS 96-YUM) and our waiter seemed irritated. Our bar tab was transferred and they do charge a corking fee so it wasn't like we were being cheap, we just brought a special bottle. I am not quite sure how to describe this fellow or his attitude, but by the end of our meal we were quite irritated by him. He was cocky, overenthusiastic and rude at the same time. \\n\\nHe recommended we start with the Salmon appetizer, which we agreed sounded great and I ordered the Rabbit for dinner. The salmon appetizer came out, basically Lox over a layer of goat cheese on a potato cake, I was quite fond of the potato cake, it was light and crispy. However, the smoked salmon lox was cut thickly and placed on top of a very thick layer of goat cheese. When you bit into it, it was mushy. I am sure the kitchen just screwed this one up because I can't imagine it always tastes that way. The waiter came by and asked what we thought of the dish. I told him, \\"The flavors are there, but the texture is mushy\\". Apparently this personally offended him, he didn't apologize, he just kind of brushed it off and was short with us the rest of the night. \\n\\nThe rabbit was OKAY, I had extremely high expectations for the dish. The meat tasted decent, my real problem was with the ravioli. The smoke flavor was extremely overpowering. It tasted like an entire bottle of liquid smoke was added to the filling. I couldn't even eat it, but since our waiter was already being rude because our appetizer was mushy I wasn't about to complain again. \\n\\nHere is my problem with the service I received at Canoe. Is it not plausible that a dish could have been prepared wrong? What happened to the customer is always right? And, if I tell you the food is not up to par, it is not a personal attack on you so please don't act that way and be noticeably rude to me the rest of the night.

Each dish was enough for my gf and I to split and after all five plates were finished, we were both pleasantly full. Their drink selection was fairly typical, nothing to rave about but it did the job. I also loved their music selection. I heard mostly old school hip-hop playing over the speakers (not too loud): Tribe Called Quest, Pharcyde, Run-DMC and Lupe Fiasco to name a few.\\n\\nTo top it all off, they gave us a small personalized book because it was our anniversary.

I must concur that the waitresses, although friendly, are seeming hired based on some aesthetic ideal. IE. they are attractive, but their looks are of little importance to me. Granted I prefer to have a waitress who doesn't look 'broken' or resembles the elephant man (sorry Mr. Merrick), but I can't recall ever having a waitress who meets this description. The waitress/server is there to be attentive, provide me with information, and overall make me feel like I'm wanted as a client. Somehow short skirts and tight shirts aren't enough to make me feel that way.

One burger came without the requested lettuce and tomato and we sat for five minutes trying to get our dopey waitress' attention to rectify this.  The other burger came burned black enough to have cooked the first burger (even though ordered medium); it was inedible (and I've never, ever seen my son leave a plate of food uneaten)!\\n\\nSmall enough issues, but when coupled with sloppy, inattentive service and high prices for a chain restaurant (burgers are $10.00 at Uno), the result is inexcusable.  I could see if this was a Red Sox/Yankees weekend at Fenway Park, but this was a Sunday night in mid March.  When I complained about the burger (and I've never complained about restaurant food in my life and I'm in my fifties), they still tried to charge me for it even though we sent it back.  Only when I insisted that this be addressed did they finally take it off of the bill, no apologies offered and no effort to make us feel anything less than ripped off and pissed off.  Cornwall's, across the street, is a much better value and the service and the food is great--too bad they are closed on a Sunday.

What does a guy gotta do to get a traditional breakfast in this town!? When I first moved here I thought breakfast tacos were the greatest culinary creation since gyros, but the novelty is starting to wane like a tree in the Texas heat. (For breakfast tacos, not gyros. Speaking of, can any of you Yelpers tell me where I can get a quality gyro in this town?)\\n\\nAfter turning this website inside out for a tortilla-less breakfast, I FINALLY came across Caf√© Java. Just as I was about to write this establishment off as ANOTHER independent coffee shop, I spotted a review from the great Errol M. containing the three magic words, \\"biscuits and gravy.\\" (His review also mentioned Migas, but I chose to ignore that.)\\n\\nIf I were to tarnish this breakfast spot's spotless review for any reason, it'd be the inconvenient location. Fortunately for me and The Lady, I was renting a Car2Go for the day. No distance is too great when I'm being charged $72 for 24 hours of car usage.\\n\\nI Tokyo drifted my (temporary) Smart Car into (what seemed to be) a giant parking space, just in time to beat the breakfast rush. By the time we received our first cup of coffee the entrance was eclipsed by baggy-eyed parents and rambunctious adolescents. Even without the presence of sugar, my java never tasted sweeter.\\n\\nOur meal began with my new favorite item, the BrappetizerÔøΩ?(Breakfast Appetizer). Our BrappetizerÔøΩ?was the aforementioned biscuits and gravy, which weren't even on the menu. (Errol M. saves the day AGAIN!) Like all B&G's, its flavor greatly surpassed its appearance. What really set Caf√© Java's version apart were the pre-buttered biscuits. You could tell a nice square of shortening was melted into the breading just before the gravy floodgates opened. I can't think of a better way to start the most important meal of the day.\\n\\nFor my main course, I Frankensteined a Greek/Ironman hybrid omelet at no additional charge. To further complicate my order I subbed my hash browns and toast for grits and a fruit cup. The Lady manned up and order the California omelet as is. After waiting just enough time to incite our BrappetizerÔøΩ?digestion, our waitress returned with two giant plates of breakfast food.\\n\\nMy mutant omelet contained a perfect medley of spinach, bacon, mushrooms and goat cheese. The grits were that ideal, \\"spoon-standing\\" consistency. The fruit cup was, well, a fruit cup.The only way to F-up an F-cup is by adding grapefruit. I don't mind grapefruit, but it's kind of like an anti-social toddler. It just doesn't play well with others.\\n\\nThe Lady's California omelet was also delicious, especially once we removed half of the abundant alfalfa sprouts.I would dock them some points for this imperfection, but it was just too easy of a fix. (Note to Chefs: It's better to add too much of a removable accoutrement than leave your diner flagging down their server for more.)\\n\\nAfter FINALLY prying ourselves from our cozy corner booth and dragging our feet to the register, we discovered a unique BressertÔøΩ?scribbled on the chalkboard by the espresso bar, the Candy Corn Latte. If you've read my previous reviews you know I can't say no to an unusual offering. The result was a delicious, caramel-reminiscent latte with whip cream and a single candy corn on top. \\n\\nAll in all, this Tex-Mex-less breakfast was the perfect conclusion to my Car2Go rental."},{"name":"Golden China Express","address":"453 E Wilson Bridge Rd","city":"Worthington","stars":"2.5","text":"I rarely want chinese food, but when I do this was my go to spot.

He right then became extremely rude, voided my order which I never even asked him to do then threw the voided receipt at my face and asked me again what I wanted, so I said the same order and he got even more mad claiming that it was the exact same order he had put in before which he was correct about, however I never asked him to void the order, I only questioned the cost of the meal. He started cursing at my face and embarrassing me. I felt very bad about my self, more so he decided to trash talk me while I was waiting for my meal with somebody else.

I'm generally rather forgiving with Indian food, given that it'll never quite be what you would eat in India (where I've travelled to consistently over the years), but I simply can't recommend this place.  First of all, the service.  We were in a bit of a hurry, but nothing unreasonable - we had over an hour to sit down and eat, and we ordered quickly.  We watched as meal after meal was brought out to tables that ordered 10 minutes or more after we did.  Our order was not complicated - saag paneer and chicken tikka masala.  It took nearly 45 minutes for our dishes to arrive after we ordered them.  There was clearly a miscommunication or mess up on our order, but nothing was communicated to us by the server.\\n\\nWhen the dishes arrived, we were hungry.  The saag was okay, but not okay for what seemed to be a hefty price.  It was spicy, as we had wanted, but the spice was simply heat, and didn't incorporate itself into the flavor at all.  It seemed an afterthought, rather than part of the dish.  On to the bad part.  The masala, which is probably one of the more difficult dishes to perfect, was nowhere close to perfection.  It wasn't even passable.  It looked, and tasted, like they simply watered down ketchup and added a bit of heat to it.  As I said in the beginning, I'm forgiving with Indian food because it can never quite match up (of course) and I simply love the flavors in it.  I couldn't finish these dishes, despite being hungry.

We then...paused. And now, it is only fitting that we resume our global Indian gastronomical odyssey with a review of Dosa-n-Curry (DnC), formerly called Dosa Temple.  Based on its former name, we were sure to read up on Consciousness Studies prior to our visit but, sadly, found this to be irrelevant.\\n\\nDosa Temple sports a reasonably clean, modern interior. In keeping with Temple traditions, however, the restaurant featured uneven floors with an upper seating area approximately 2 feet higher than the lower (which was presumably reserved for the Untouchables). Faux stone paneling accented the faux wood paneling; however, despite an exhaustive search, we were unable to locate the ornate wood screens so common on the Left Coast (clearly the restaurateurs are unaware of Restaurant Depot, the world's sole supplier of such screens). We were pleased to see that the few mirrors were entirely free of oily residue.\\n\\nOn this visit, we were joined by a large group of UVa alumni and friends, allowing us to sample DnC's offers deeply. The menu consists entirely of South Indian vegetarian delicacies and, as its name might suggest, features a particularly large selection of dosas and curries. The colorful and terse menu was punctuated by one nagging error: Dosa's.\\n\\nWe began our meal with the chilli bhajji ($5), a fried dough-covered banana pepper accompanied by 3-day-old iceberg lettuce shreds--clearly not suitable for human consumption. The pepper, while quite spicy, was insufficiently crispy. Shortly thereafter, Walt's paper masala dosa ($12) arrived. This cigar-shaped monstrosity had a ~3.5 foot length and an 8 inch diameter, and displayed exquisite radial uniformity in thickness and cookitude, indicating to us that a true culinary virtuoso was holding forth in the kitchen. Needless to say, all of the men present were overwhelmed and humbled by the massive proportions of this girthy cr√®pe-tube.  The vegetarian eigen dish, aloo ghobi ($12), exhibited near-perfect cookitude and the bise bela bath ($9), while not as good as the dish served up by UP in Berkeley, did come with an exquisitely spicy pickle. The coconut rice ($10) was exceptionally well seasoned, and the peshawary naan ($4) was, to our great surprise and delight, devoid of cherry pie filling. The mango lassi ($3) was very frothy, strangely non-viscous-looking, and yet actually quite viscous...ÔøΩ?\\nNear the conclusion of the meal, the overeager waiter taunted Walt, declaring \\"I knew that you were not going to finish,\\" with a smug grin betraying what we can only assume was a perverse sense of schadenfreude. Notwithstanding, the resumption of Masala Chaat's operations at DnC was a worthwhile affair. Despite an overeager wait staff and a few missteps here and there, DnC is a solid four samosa restaurant that will set you back two rupees, for a samosa-to-rupee ratio of 2.0. DnC may have changed its name from Dosa Temple to appeal to a more diverse clientele, but it certainly retains its divine heritage."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"4034 Townsfair Way, # J-102","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"It's Chipotle, it hasn't changed since I was here the first time, well maybe the menu has a little, it's not just Burritos anymore.

I hit a milestone on my diet so I decided to reward myself for being so good. A friend had told me that Cheyenne Grill had his favorite burger in Atlanta. As luck would have it, I was on assignment close to the restaurant. So, I popped in for an early lunch on Friday. The place is your basic sports bar with plenty of sports porn for the fanatic.\\n\\nI went straight to the extensive burger menu and selected the burger with bacon, lettuce, tomato and sharp cheddar. I opted for their homemade potato chips instead of fries. The place got full very quickly and my waitress (and the kitchen) got overwhelmed. It probably took me 30 minutes to get my burger, but I found plenty of entertainment in watching a handful of barflies drinking way too early in the morning.\\n\\nWhen my burger finally came, it looked scrumptious but my chips were missing--they'd given me fries by mistake. My waitress, who was very sweet, quickly remedied the situation and I tucked into my lunch. The burgers have hand-formed patties that average over a half a pound of certified Angus beef. The meat was cooked to my specifications and had a nice smoky flavor imparted from the grill. Definitely not a fast food burger. My only complaint would be the bun. It fell apart easily and I ended up eating most of my meal with a fork and knife. It was still pretty good. The chips, however, were stellar. Thick, long and very crisp without a drop of oil. The dipping sauce was kind of bland, but the chips didn't need it.\\n\\nVerdict: Not the best restaurant burger in Atlanta, but still a solid choice if you are in the area. The chips are worth the trip alone. There are all-you-can-eat wings on Sundays. For what it is worth, the restaurant did recognize how long I had waited (I didn't say a word or indicate any distress) and tried to comp my meal. I paid anyway. But, it was nice that they did realize that the service was off on this particular day. I would go back and try another burger."},{"name":"Koto Izakaya","address":"8171 Alexandra Road, Suite 101","city":"Richmond","stars":"3","text":"We arrived when they opened so have no idea how the service is when they are full.

I guess the small plate saloon is a nod to the small plate dining culture of Vancouver. Somehow that is difficult to pair with classic barbecue though.\\n\\nFirst off, sticker shock.  Rack of ribs $32 at lunch time. Half rack $22. Pulled pork sandwich at lunchtime $15.  Smoked chicken sandwich at lunchtime $14.  They had a random item called, \\"Prawn PoBoy Tostada\\" for $15. Um, you do know what \\"PoBoy\\" means, right?

Pistachio crusted salmon with wasabi ginger and soy vinaigrette on micro greens? Smoked salmon benedict?  Granola?  GRANOLA?!?!?!?!?!?  Oh, and on the classic BBQ front there was a choice of ribs, pulled pork, or smoked chicken.  No brisket.  :(  \\n\\nI ordered the smoked chicken sandwich.

The sauce was very bland - I guess to make up for the salty fries?  The chicken itself had a very slight hint of smoke, and was somewhat tender. It was topped with some crispy onions which got soggy quickly from the excessive sauce.  The bun soaked up the sauce nicely. Overall the plate did not excite me at all. It had an odd back and forth between overly salty fries and a slightly bland tasting sandwich.

The garlic scallops lunch combo plate is also quite good. The soups aren't outstanding,  but are pretty solid none-the-less.

They don't serve alcohol but you can bring your own, Mario's will even give you two paper cups. Best part of my experience was the \\"Pay it Forward\\" theme going with our waitress. Throughout her shift, patrons had been paying $5 - $10 for the next party at the table or another table. So cool. With our $5 off, the bill ended up being only $16.

Indifferent would be the best term. \\n\\nI ordered the combo platter - half chicken, half lamb; served on a bed of rice and lettuce with a few pieces of flatbread. I took tiny cups of my three favorite sauces with me to-go: spicy hot sauce, creamy garlic sauce, and cool cilantro sauce. \\n\\nThe amount of food is perfect for leftovers or perfect for one big meal if you're hungry (no judgment).

She didn't opt for the onion rings for an extra dollar and got so many ff that she literally had to dig her burger out of the pile of fries.  \\n\\nSo, in short.

Their broth for the pho also tasted pretty good when I had a few sips of my boyfriend's. Very generous portions overall.  So, the above foods plus nice waitress pretty much made this a 5 star place. \\n\\nSome things that could've been better, but this is me being nit-picky:\\n\\nThe traditional summer roll? salad roll? veggie roll? wraps? in the appetizer section was decent. They were large rolls, which is a plus, but the peanut sauce was lacking in character and spiciness and it seemed like the rolls could've been fresher. \\n\\nI got a vermicelli bowl with the lemon grass pork which was as you'd expect, although I pined for my bf's pho.

Noticing the $$$$ price tag (like many others who stumble upon this page), I bookmarked it in my head and hoped one day to try this place. \\n\\nThat day came with my boyfriend decided to take me out! A late Christmas gift of sorts. We're but poor college students, so I was nervous about the rock that was going to hit his bank account, but we made our way here anyways. The restaurant is somewhat small. And with that size and location, it was difficult to find. The parking decks were confusing, and I was so afraid that my reservation was going to blow up into smoke. I can't offer you an idea of where it is, but we walked past the Umi door twice before realizing it was there. \\n\\nFirst thing I noticed was it was classy. Of course, it's Buckhead, ATL, what else should I have expected? Second thing: it was loud. I wanted a quiet classy dinner where I got to marvel and drool at food with hushed tones surrounding me. It was difficult to hear my boyfriend talk over the table, even given the slightly cramped space. However, the cramped spaces were due to all the winter coats strewn across the booth from neighboring customers. \\n\\nWe opted for the cheapest Omakase: The Umi, which is $75 a person. In the 6 course meal it includes: appetizer, soup, sashimi, hot dish, nigiri, and dessert. \\n\\nThey gave us two carpacio's for the appetizer. One tuna and one I couldn't remember. The tuna was sitting in a pool of clear brown sauce, and it was to be eaten with a slice of avocado and some onions. Everything was heavenly and it melted straight into your tongue. The other appetizer was given a paste to dab the fish with. It was interesting with its punch of flavor and citrus-ness, but it wasn't my favorite. \\n\\nThe soup was a simple miso soup. Compared to regular sushi restaurants, there was a lot more seaweed and tofu chunks inside, and it definitely had a deeper flavor than the usual stuff. My boyfriend loved it considering his throat hurt a little. \\n\\nNext up was the sashimi. I was waiting for this. There were a couple of fish available that I can't remember to name now. The only thing you need to know was that it was good. Even the octopus which I've never liked. There was also otoro and uni. If anyone knows me, they would know how much I love sushi, and especially otoro and uni. Too bad my wallet can't sustain my cravings. The entire slab of sashimi was delicious, even the wasabi. Usually, I can't handle wasabi, since it blinded my sense of taste with its pungency, but this wasabi was different. After trying a piece of fish with it, I didn't want to eat another sashimi bite without a little nugget of it. \\n\\nHalfway at the hot dish. There were two filets of fish given to us. One a Chilean Sea Bass and another a sake and miso marinated... something. Can you blame me for blanking out once they set that dish in front of me? There were little pickled vegetables given on the plate plus a strange pink ginger used to cleanse the palette afterwards. Back the main parts of the dish: the fish. It was charred and sweet and flavorful and everything good in the world crusted with burnt goodness. There was a little sauce on the side for each fish complimenting them both wonderfully. I want to say I liked it more than the raw fish? But that's blasphemy cause the entire meal was on par with each other. \\n\\nThe nigiri was perfect as well, and I'm running out of space I'm sure. Some of the fish was repeated from the sashimi, and I'm perfectly fine with that. The only thing I didn't love was the shiso leaf. \\n\\nLastly dessert: a green tea panna cotta and sesame mochi. I wished it was bigger. And I'd be lying if I didn't go look up green tea panna cotta recipes right after we left. \\n\\nThe service is also great here. The little glasses for water they gave us were small, but they were never empty the entire night. We had no problems, but our waitress would stop by every once in a while to let us know our next course was on its way or ask how was everything. Each time she did stop by I'd simply reply wonderful, great, amazing... I was running out of adjectives to describe how happy I was. \\n\\nI loved this place, and I hope to one day come back and try the pricier Omakase. The only downsides were the noise levels and the location and difficulty finding the restaurant. However that's not enough to keep me away and I hope it isn't too long before I find myself back here."},{"name":"Ball Square Cafe","address":"708 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"Having a craving for brunch but no idea where to go?

Ordered online for pickup.  When I arrived they told me they were out of rice and that I could substitute a side for it.  So we got grilled vegetables instead.  I could deal with that no problem at all.  They took quite a long time though to finish our order.  People had come in and ordered and received the food before ours was packed up.  I get it they were busy.  He finally handed me our food and I asked to make sure that they had put the whole wheat flatbread in there like we requested and he said no.  They were out of flatbread and they substituted other bread for it like our choice didn't even matter.  Now I can deal with a substitute and even a swapping of bread.   That wasn't even the half of it. I get the food home and it was cold, overlooked and the grilled vegetables were burnt.   What the heck did we do to deserve this?!?   I've had bad experiences at restaurants before so even this I was ready to chalk up to a poor chef or something.  That's not even what made me feel compelled to write a review like this.  Here's the kicker... My wife looks down in her -cold- soup and sure enough....there's a short black curly hair that seemed to have come from someone's nether region.  You can make the assumption...we did.  With that said, as much as we really hoped we'd be able to find a healthy alternative to the normal fast food, our journey will still continue.

Don't make any mistake there, try it for yourselves. Five stars all the way. With this Vietnamese cafe, you get the best of both fast food, and sit down.

If your looking for a sit down and order your food kind of place, go for a steaming bowel of Pho. Well worth the price, at about $7.50 a bowel on average, you get a large (and I do mean large) bowel of hot brisket, with your choice of egg or rice noodles, a selection of meats and a plate of sprouts and lime, to give the brisket some tang.

As a young professional in Southie, I was amped to hear about this Italian spot opening especially since I've been going to Lincoln (same owners) since it opened and have and continue to have fond memories there. After the three times I've been to Capo, I 100% designate it as a beer and app spot, the house wine isn't bad too but they have solid beers on tap. That artisanal cured meats starter is amazing if you're with friends. I will echo fellow sentiments here that it is LOUDDDD, I had some trouble speaking to my date here during dinner. Bad acoustics. Where Capo has lost me is with some of its entrees. My go to is chicken Parmesan but was shocked when my waitress said it came as is. Like not over pasta like normal restaurants serve their entrees? Not to mention the chicken Parm was so so to begin with (but I've been spoiled with spots in NY and CT so that's tough competition in itself). But be warned yelpers if you want the chicken Parm like any freaking diner wants their chicken Parm (served over pasta), it's going to cost you a MINIMUM of $8 for a \\"half order\\" of plain ole spaghetti and if you want rigatoni or other variations of pasta you're looking at $10-12 additional. So you're now looking at $25-30 for the convenience of a sub Par chicken Parm dinner in Southie. Apps, small plates and beer = you'll love it. Believe me I'll be back this summer for that cured meats app = delicious. Plus it has a huge open rustic space, really pretty. But dinner wise, dial up Uber on your smartphone and take the short trip to the North End. Nothing better and reasonable than a $18 crazy Alfredo at Carmelinas with fresh chicken and sausage and a $32 bottle of decent red.

Neither of us had eaten here before.  I had found a rating on Yelp and we agreed to try it.  We were both VERY PLEASED.\\n\\nIt is a nice neighbor hood restaurant.  Great for family, kids, couples, and friends.\\n\\nI had the House Smoked St. Louis Ribs \\"In our own sauce served with mashed potatoes, country gravy and fresh seasonal vegetables.\\"  First, presentation was beautiful.  The ribs were stacked one upon the other with the mashed potatoes (no garlic or anything fancy) to one side and a third of the plate filled with bright green asparagus spears.  I asked for the gravy to be separate from the potatoes.  Personal preference.\\n\\nThe ribs were in a lightly sweet sauce, meaty and perfectly warm.  The meat remained together yet, was easily pulled from the bone, lightly smoked delicious.  There were about half a dozen large thickly meaty ribs. The mashed potatoes were just a little lumpy.  Thereby, proving their real substance.  Nothing added.  Except the gravy if you want it on top.  The gravy was EXCELLENT.  It was thick and creamy, filled with flavor and sausage pieces.  The asparagus were not too soft and tender and not too crisp.  I found them to be perfect.  In fact, I felt that way about the whole meal.\\n\\nWhile I was stuffed I was unable to resist a ridiculously thick and gooey flourless chocolate cake.  I shared this with my PID and together we couldn't finish it. It was excellent even the next day.\\n\\nMy PID had the \\"Sckavone's Meatloaf\\nSeasoned ground beef and pork, sun dried tomato, fresh herbs, house made marinara, mashed potatoes and vegetables.\\"  The portions were HUGE!  Each of the two slices were approximately an inch thick and 3 or 4 slices long and two inches wide.  She was unable to stop herself from eating the full first slice.  The marinara was lightly applied.  Just the right amount.  Her mashed potatoes were impossible to resist.  She was very happy with her vegetables.  She remarked to me how lovely the combination of saut√©ed squash was.  She did take home the remainder of her Meatloaf and veggies.\\n\\nThe service was excellent.  My water glass was constantly full.  Which, is kind of amazing since, I drink a lot.  And when I say \\"a lot\\" I mean \\"A LOT\\".  I always have (not diabetic issue.

My honey had been wanting to come here for some time, and the reviews were really good.  We had a hard time finding the door to come in, as it was somewhat camouflaged with the rest of the outside of the restaurant.  Once we walked in, we noticed the very mellow ambiance.  The lights above were very nice, and they had some driftwood encased in glass (which my honey thought they had snakes in).  She ventured to the bathrooms and said they were the nicest she's been in.\\n\\nWe were seated at a very comfortable table (long cushioned bench), so always a plus there.  We started off with the miso soup and salad.  The miso soup was one of the best I've had outside of Sushi Mani, and her salad came with a Wasabi vinaigrette that was so insanely delicious!  Two HUGE pluses there!\\n\\nOur next order was the Spicy Tuna Tartare, which neither one of us were really impressed by.  The tuna was fresh, but the taste didn't wow me.  Then again, I haven't had a tuna tartare that was blown me away yet.\\n\\nThe Sake Aioli was the best part of the meal, which came after the Tuna Tartare.  The salmon was very fresh, and the flavor was amazing!  We would have surely ordered more of this if it wasn't for the cost.\\n\\nThe biggest let down was the two rolls we had, the Kamikaze and Hurricane Rolls.  Not that they were bad, it's just that I was expecting much more.  The good news is that they came out as eight rolls, but they were fairly small and lacking more of what I was hoping for, which was a flavor in my mouth.\\n\\nOne thing we did notice is that a lot of people ordered the hot plates, and I realize this might have been where we messed up.  If we do head back to Umi again, it will surely be for the soup, salad and trying out the hot plates.  The service was great, and they kept refilling my Sake for me and cleaning up every time they came by.

Everything from the service to the ambience and food was simply impeccable. \\n\\nFood: The delightfully varied menu of Canoe blends expertly-executed American and Continental fare. Every offering is characterized by innovative flavor combinations and only the freshest of ingredients. During my first visit, I opted to start with the warm artisan cheese salad with bacon, baby spinach, and dried cranberries; the dish was accompanied by a pecan vinaigrette dressing, which nicely complemented the warm baked brie that topped the salad. Based on the recommendation of our waitress, I opted for the roasted rabbit as an entree, which was served atop bacon ravioli, sweet potato hash, and candied garlic sauce; the dish was absolutely superb. For dessert, I ordered the orange cranberry bread pudding with white chocolate chunks; the dish was light and delicious, but I would have preferred if the white chocolate flavor was more pronounced.\\n\\nService: Every staff member our party came into contact with, from the valet to the waitress, was professional, courteous, and efficient. It was particularly refreshing to have a waitress with a personality and the ability to recommend dishes that weren't necessarily the most expensive on the menu; I've personally found that this quality is becoming rapidly extinct in the Atlanta restaurant scene. \\n\\nAtmosphere: Sophisticatedly upscale, yet not pretentious. The clientele is mixed, but mostly comprised of middle-aged to older individuals. There were a few patrons that were underdressed, but for the most part the dress is business casual; ladies would fit in nicely with a cocktail dress and gentleman would be well advised to avoid jeans.\\n\\nCost. Expensive by most standards. Appetizers cost between $8 and $15, entrees cost between $20 and $30, and desserts are all $8. For the most part, full dinner and drinks for a party of two will exceed $100.\\n\\nOther: Canoe is attached to the end of a strip mall, but that doesn't necessarily quell the overall dining experience. The restaurant is directly adjacent to the banks of the Chattahoochee River, which affords a tranquil and natural aesthetic that most reasonable individuals would find pleasant."},{"name":"Brick and Beam","address":"705 Adams St","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"Had high expectations since I've always enjoyed the Banshee.

Crab cake special, again. the waitress had no idea of the price was extremely salty and mushy. Should have had some crust on the sides but that was non-existent. Disappointing for sure. Last but not least the Caesar Salad with Salmon. Waitress had no idea of the cost of a piece of Salmon which we guessed was about 5-6 ounces when it arrived, but the cost was $12.00 which made the Caesar and Salmon $20.00.

The other nice touch is the fresh cut fruit they bring to the table while you're waiting (which in our case was a very, very long time, being a group of about 14).\\n\\nOne less star for the coffee though; I don't know if I've ever had worse in a restaurant. It was so watery and lacking any flavor that resembled coffee.

I've been eating here for some time and dining in on every occasion. Obviously after awhile of being disappointed consistently I had to put it up on their yelp. The food is great, but every single time we dine in the service is horrendous. My husband and I usually dine in together and we've visited at least on  7 different occasions. With that said out of that we've had terrible service 90% of the time. Constantly waiting on refills and not being attending to in a timely fashion is only the beginning. The worst part of it is every bad server we had would get so annoyed at our asking of help with anything. I think my last straw was when i had to ask for the 2nd time for a refill of my drink, and what was aggressively poured into my cup was warm watered down soda. Then when I asked for a fresh cup of soda with ice I was told I could only be brought a cup of ice so I could pour that warm watered down soda into (which I even waited for.) Yea I definitely won't be dining in again. The only reason why I'm not giving this 1 star is because I really enjoy the food- but now my only option is picking up.

Chicken and beans had a kick but not so spicy to scare anyone off. \\n\\nOne thing that I wasn't real excited about was the use of styrofoam cups and plates, plastic straws and plastic forks. That makes economic sense for the restaurant but it didn't really seem to fit with the rest of Chamblee's growing restaurant scene or the nicely decorated restaurant - it's  enough for me to not want to return knowing I am contributing to the landfills with styrofoam and plastic items.

It is located on Cobb Parkway near Best Buys. Recently I came with some friends who also enjoyed their dinner here. We were warmly greeted at the door as we entered the restaurant.\\n\\nWith a great smile, our waitress gave us the menus and brought our hot teapots and drinks promptly. This is a catch-all Asian restaurant where they serve Chinese, Malaysian, Thai and Korean dishes. We started off our dinner with the following dishes:\\n\\n* Malaysian Pancakes (Roti Canai) \\nThis was a mid sized light pancake appetizer served with vegetable curry as a dipping sauce. It had some small cubes of potatoes as well. It would be better if the curry was less watery and has more coconut cream in it. I ordered two of this appetizer to share among the four of us. Our waitress was kind enough to cut the pancakes into nice triangles with her shears as we did not have any knives nearby. \\n\\nThe next few dishes comes with steamed rice. We did the family style and shared all our dishes together.\\n\\n* Orange Chicken \\nThis was a delicious dish of lightly battered chicken blended with a burst of fresh citrus orange glaze sauce on the top. There were some carrots and peas cooked with a few pineapple cubes to combine with the orange slices. It really enriched the sophisticated citrus flavor even more.  Surprisingly, it was not too sweet and the citrus blend was wonderful.\\n\\n* Beef With Eggplant\\nThe eggplant was sauteed with the chef's special sauce together with the beef slices. It was a hearty dish and the beef was tender and not overcooked. The eggplant was cooked just right with the chef's special brown sauce and it was delicious. \\n\\n* Cantonese Pan Fried Noodles\\nWe had an assortment of seafood with our Cantonese Pan Fried Noodles dish. On top of the egg noodles, there were shrimps, squids and scallops combined with shiitake black mushrooms, broccoli, carrots, baby corns, napa and green peas that made this dish a favorite among my friends. At first I could not see the noodles because there were too much sauce all over the dish. However, the sauce had made the noodles softer and easier to chew on. \\n\\n* Malaysian Curry Noodles (Laksa)\\nThis was a delicious bowl of noodle soup with shrimps and tofu for protein. If you want to wake up all your senses, you can ask for extra hot sauce. It was a spicy bowl of soup and we specifically asked for vermicelli as our choice of  noodles. It came out exactly like we wanted. Our waitress also brought out a side dish of hot sauce in case we wanted it spicier. I thanked her for it and passed the hot sauce around. We had extra little bowls to share this noodle soup that was really good.  I did not need a fire hydrant to cool off from the spicy soup either. I tricked my tummy with more noodles than soup since the tummy is sensitive to spicy food.\\n\\n* Stirred Fried Green Beans\\nI had this dish on another occasion and it was stirred fried with no protein or meat added ($13.95). Although the dish was good, I think it was overpriced for just a plain vegetable dish. I discussed it with the waitress and she brought back the same ticket to me.  Lesson learned here is to ask for the price of a certain dish that is not on the menu, no matter how simple the dish is. \\n\\nI have been here several times for lunch and dinner. The lunch are around $6 to $10 and it comes with your choice of soup and chicken wing. Lunch meals are reasonably priced and you will not leave hungry. The dinner menu has a longer selection to pick from. The dinner prices range from $11 to 14 an entree. Some has seasonal pricing on it, so ask before you place your order. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is cozy and it has a casual setting that is a bit outdated. There is a room in the back if you choose to have a private party here. The waitresses are very friendly.  Most Asian restaurants are not very good with the service and I did not expect much from here. There is free parking outside the restaurant but I usually park a little further down. I like to come by here whenever I am in the Cobb area. I know my tummy will do the happy dance after a good dinner here. \\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lees-golden-buddha-smyrna?select=MGQ5rNm5VXqd_82poAE2KQ#k3PBGIg3BOjq0zBuXZQEoQ\\n\\nYelp 72/365"},{"name":"Umi","address":"3050 Peachtree Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We were very exited to try UMI.

The salsa was way to salty and the queso dip  tasted like watery pastureized cheese.  Really?  How hard is it to make for a Tex Mex place to serve a decent salsa and queso dip?  That should be fundamental!! I digress. \\n\\nNow the menu looked to have promise with creative tacos like a pork taco with red cabbage coleslaw, bisket tacos, and fish tacos.   However, the reality was far removed from my expectations.  Pork and brisket were super dry, literally like jerky and again, way salty.  The fish taco tasted funky, I'm not sure what kind of fish it was but obviously it was a bottom feeder because it tasted like like mud. \\n\\n As I was eating, I was getting more and more annoyed because I kept thinking how that I was paying 3$ per taco when I could have had a 10X better taco at a half the price on BuHi...\\n\\nAlso, the waiter automatically added beans and rice to our meal withou asking if we wanted to upgrade to a combo meal.  Great, another few bucks wasted on school cafeteria grade refried beans and rice.  \\n\\nIn sum: overpriced and terrible.

Consistently good food, excellent service, and gorgeous ambiance. One time, I saw a wedding reception taking place in the back --- can't think of a more romantic place to get married in Atlanta than on the river banks at sunset, with amazing food. \\n\\nWe came here on two separate occasions (both for our anniversary). Note: no self parking here, only valet parking.\\n\\nFirst time (Sept 2010):\\n\\nAppetizers - shared Canoe's House Smoked Salmon on Potato Cake, and summer corn soup. Both amazing and delicious... I think I preferred the corn soup, but that's just my taste. Waiter graciously split the appetizers onto 2 plates for us --- how nice!\\n\\nEntrees - got 2 of the favorites: slow roasted Carolina rabbit and grilled Atlantic salmon. The rabbit certainly sounded amazing, but it was bit too gamy and dense for us with meaty rabbit taste, bacon, and a heavy sauce --- we had a lot of trouble finishing the dish. The salmon, though, was what brought us back the second time --- they cooked it medium-rare, and the middle was reminiscent of high-grade sashimi. On top of a bed of spaghetti squash, this salmon dish was light, flavorful, and hit all the right spots.\\n\\nSurprise dessert! - Waiter was nice enough to offer us a complimentary berry sorbet for our anniversary --- even had a little message on it in chocolate drizzle! We couldn't finish it (way too full from all the delicious food), but still an unexpected and happy surprise for us.\\n\\nSecond time we came (Sept 2012):\\n\\nAppetizer - shared heirloom tomatoes appetizer. These fresh tomatoes apparently are transported from Alabama daily, so I had to try them! Wasn't particularly impressed by the taste (I thought fresh tomatoes were supposed to taste amazingly different from average grocery tomatoes), but very light, fresh tasting tomatoes for a good start to dinner.\\n\\nEntrees - Of course, the salmon again, and the grouper. The grouper came on a bed of mashed potatoes and some veggies (i.e. corn, carrots, etc.)  -- really delicious. However, I was disappointed by the salmon. It's not that it wasn't well cooked --- I was just expecting that same lightly-salted sashimi-centered taste, but I think they used smoked salmon instead of fresh salmon? It was overwhelmingly smoky, which is good if that's what you like, but the smokiness weighs down the light salmon taste. I'm not sure if they changed the way they cook the salmon, or if this was a fluke, or if I was just mistaken the first time.\\n\\nAll in all, still a must-visit restaurant for the serious foodie visiting or living in Atlanta.

I opted for the fried ice cream instead, which was good but a little bit overwhelmed by the chocolate and coconut toppings.\\n\\nOur servers were very friendly and did an admirable job waiting on such a large group. They actually recommended the large plates, which ended up being a good choice due to the variety. Be aware the portions are large though. We had plenty of extra to take home with us.

This is a grill pub that is not like many in Austin.  In fact, it is not like any other in Austin.  Far away from the 6th street mess, the 4th and 5th street lounges, and the dirty dive bars along the drag and such, the Flying Saucer is a casually nice and refined grub-pub where it is fun and easy to relax and have a few beers with friends.  You can find people there for after-work happy hour, students taking an easy 2-3 beer night outing, or even family dates to have dinner and a couple of beers.  It is a wide range, but definitely it gets more noisy and revolves into a more complete pub-atmosphere starting around 7 pm...a good thing in my book.\\n\\nFirst, there is a huge selection and a menu dedicated to only the beer!  They pour specialty beers in specialty glasses, and have so many you can share with friends (such as the large 25 oz bottles).  They will always be willing to give you a description of the beer you are about to get, so if you are unsure, just ask.  The menu changes frequently, and every week there is at least a couple of new draughts on the wall.  They pour the beers to the top, and happy hour is a good deal where, until 7pm, you get a big glass for a pint price.  Also, every night, all night, there is a \\"Fire Sale\\" pint that is only 2.75 all night long.  On top of that, there is keep-the-glass Wednesdays at 7 pm, Texas beers 2.75 on Sunday, and All drought pints 2.75 on Mondays.  There is always a special going on.\\n\\nSecondly, the waitresses are extremely informative and nice.  These girls know beer.  The bartenders are also very cool and relaxed, always willing to let you sample a beer that is on tap or have a conversation about beer or whatever.\\n\\nThirdly, it is cozy.  There are plasmas with games and such on, outdoor wooden seating that is fun in nice weather, indoor seating in the form of a normal pub with booths and tables and chairs, a bar with stool, and another section with comfy couches, \\"kings'\\" chairs and lay-z-boys.\\n\\nLastly, they have good food.  There is a full menu, and it is relatively cheap.  A saucer burger with a side of seasoned fries (fries that my friends and I all rave about) comes to about 6 bucks with tax!  There are also German specialties that I suggest, queso that is wonderfully balanced, beer-cheese soup, a section with sandwiches/wraps, and another with cheese/beer pairings.  There isn't anything special about the food, but it is good no doubt and worth the cheap price and convenience.  I mean c'mon...this is a beer joint!  Anything else is just icing.\\n\\nTo sum it up, this place has great beer, great service, a fun and casual atmosphere, and good food.  It makes it easy to have a nice night out with friends and still keep it in check."},{"name":"Shiki","address":"9 Babcock St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"So you've found a hidden gem, tucked away right in the middle of a busy promenade? Though it's already popular you feel like you've discovered it all on your own? Not this time, little buddy.  Let's begin with the soups which taste like chlorine.  Not a mysterious Japanese spice. Chlorine.  The tea is devoid of flavor and the sake does have flavor, but more of the rubbing alcohol variety.  Sniffly waitress? Check. Cold air blowing in winter? Check.  Over-salted side dishes and questionable grilled saba (mackerel) are not reassuring either.  But how could this be? There are so many Japanese clients, you could barely get in during busy periods!  Usually, it's a good sign but this time the exception proves the rule.  The food poisoning afterwards does take away from the umami.  Some things tasted good (sashimi and tempura) but there are authentic and correctly executed Japanese restaurants in Boston, even if there aren't many.  Years ago, there was just Takeshima. It was the only one in Brookline and it was very good. And Mr. Sushi was very pleasant too.  Now the options are stagerring but staid.  The search for authenticity without taste leads one astray"},{"name":"Alegria's Seafood","address":"2584 Bethel Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow what a surprise this place was! I read some yelp reviews and thought we would give it try. We showed up in the early afternoon on a Saturday and the place was empty. Let me just say the only problem I have with this place is the overall cleanliness- it's not enough to dock it a star but seriously the floor needs a good clean. Our shoes were sticking to the bottom which was kind of gross. Anyway moving on- delicious margaritas and a great selection as well! The salsa and chips were pretty standard but the salsa had a kick to it which was perfect.  After looking at pictures on Facebook we were asking if we could just pick a bunch of seafood with a sauce and she brought out an iPad. She essentially showed us how to mess around with the menu. It was awesome. We ordered the redfish, crab legs, shrimp, mussels and scallops in their special nariyat style. Sorry spelling is prolly wrong with that but something like that! It was seriously amazing. The platter is gorgeous not to mention totally delicious. The dish was cooked to perfection. The sauce was amazing and unlike anything I have ever tasted. I would def order the dish and crab again- and maybe try some other kinds of seafood. I cannot wait to go back!"},{"name":"Symphonie Restaurant","address":"1140 Pender Street W, Suite 120","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Very friendly staff in a small coffee shop/sandwich counter space. I liked the options to get some Filipino food, and took the opportunity to try out one of their breakfasts.\\n\\n$9 got me some garlic fried rice topped with 2 fried eggs and some sweet sausage served with a small dish of what tasted like vinegar. It was made quickly and brought to my table after I ordered and paid at the counter. \\n\\nThe food itself was ok. I haven't had a lot of Filipino food, so I wasn't sure about the vinegar. The sausage was very sweet and softer than say, a Chinese sausage. I liked the garlic in the rice.\\n\\nJust something different to try while I was in the area. I'd probably go back and try an empanada or something different."},{"name":"Jack Allen's Kitchen Oak Hill","address":"7720 Hwy 71 W","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Pretty good place.
