I typically don't waste my time writing reviews, however I feel the general public needs to be aware of just what they are getting themselves into. My girlfriend and I waited over 20 min to get seated on a Wednesday afternoon As we waited I counted 4 dirty tables not being bussed plus so we could sit down to eat, I guess the buss staff had better things to do. My initial reaction was to leave but since this is the only BBQ place within miles I guess we stayed merely by default. Another 15 min pass and our waitress had yet to arrive and when she did arrive she was rude, ill mannered and acted as if we were wasting her time. The music consisting of lady gaga and gangster rap was way to loud for my girlfriend and I to enjoy our conversation. I thought a country restaurant would play, I don't know, country music? The bathroom is lit like a dungeon and for some reason the music is even louder, furthermore the trashcan was jammed full of paper towels, the floor was sticky with what I hoped was lemonade. As I entered the stall I almost gagged and ran for the hills, due in large part to the over abundance of small curly hairs and fecal matter in and around the bowl. I did not touch a single surface and I advise you to do the same.  \\n\\n   Our entrees and main courses arrived at the same time, never a good sign. I have no idea were they buy there meat from but it looked to be Walmart whole sale value.  My ribs had a good 2inch of fat on them and were extremely dry, my mac and cheese was ok but it tasted like cheap Costco brand Velveeta cheese that was way to thick. I ordered mac and cheese not cheese and cheese. They clearly try to mask there inefficiency in the kitchen with way too much salt, heavily over seasoning and portion size. A lot of crap is still crap people. My girlfriends pulled pork was equally horrid, way to dry and the bun was incredibly soggy and squishy to the touch, and what is with the lunch trays???? I felt like I was dining in a cafeteria. Upon looking into the kitchen (which is oddly small and ill suited for a restaurant of this size) I realized that that's exactly what this place was. As I watched Tired, overworked kitchen hands haphazardly doll out giant scoops and toss them into rusted cups. I thought to myself this p[lace is a half notch above a soup kitchen. Not to mention this place is way over priced. Upon eating my meal I began to get an instant headache and stomach pains, that 5 Advil could not cure.This was no doubt due in large part to the 10pds of butter and salt they put in everything. I would hate to think that Bostonians are so naive they think this passes as real southern food.  Never in my life have I felt so uncomfortably queasy and nauseous so quickly. On a side note I over herd cursing and arguing amongst the staff in the kitchen. Not very professional considering we were sitting next to a table of toddlers. \\n\\n  Of course I felt the need to voice my displeasure with the overall horrible experience by asking to speak to a manager. 20 minutes pass (good thing I didn't have anything to do in the next 2 plus hours we wasted there) before a manager showed up at our table. This woman was so rude, unresponsive and bitter I can only describe her as a stout, bleached blonde truck stop waitress with prison tattoo's, and that is me being nice.  I thought to myself, this cannot be right. This woman looked like she should be working the local lot at a truck stop somewhere, not owning a fine upstanding establishment such as this. (Dripping with Sarcasm) Not to mention she was incredibly pretentious and kept interrupting me every time I made a valid grievance. Its almost as if she was in complete denial about the overall quality of her restaurant. Whatever happened to southern hospitality?  If this was anyone of authority in this place I was not impressed. Apparently feedback, motivation or delegation are not very high up on her list of daily priorities.  She agreed to take a mere 10% off our bill and then acted like she was doing us a debt of gratitude by this meek gesture.  WOW!!!!!! After enduring the worst restaurant experience my girlfriend and I have ever had a mere 10% off??? They should be paying me to eat this crap.

Upon entry the initial atmosphere seemed pretty cool. There's virtually no parking lot so pretty much everyone has to valet park unless you park away from the venue, but that was cool because valet was only $3. My friends and I were seated at one of the booths across from the bar with another party. I loved the idea of having iPads at every table to place your order, call the waiter, send for valet and even vote on song selections. I ordered a Martini and some type of shrimp & sausage pasta which was pretty tasty. The prices were also very reasonable and each order included a 15% gratuity. \\n\\nAlthough the food & drinks were good there were a few things that bothered me to the point of probably never going back. For starters, the restrooms are extremely awkward. There were only 2 available on the floor level (that I saw) and I was told by an employee that I had to wait because the \\"red\\" lights were on meaning they were occupied. He explained to me how the restrooms worked - you push a button to go in and pull a button to come out...The doors are electronic. I guess they wanted to keep the whole technology atmosphere in tact. Of course with only 2 unisex restrooms it definitely wasn't the cleanest. There was also no mirror, instead they had an actual iPad over the sink with the selfie camera activated and instructions on how to take a bathroom \\"selfie\\" and send it to friends. That was hella bizarre and creepy. They could do without that...it felt more like someone was watching you pee. CREEPY. \\n\\nIt was almost unbearably loud in there and a little bit too dark. They should've at least had a few candles on the table so you could actually see your food. The iPad on the tables had an option to call your waiter which was cool at first....until he completely started ignoring our requests. IDK if the place was just too busy for him or what but it took over 30 minutes just to bring us some water and over an hour to bring our bills which was ridiculous. It was pretty crowded too. The bar was about 3-4 feet in width away from our booth, all the seats were taken so people were literally standing between the bar and the booths dancing and drinking and the waiters had to literally push through the crowd. Which wasn't really an issue because aside from the awful service and creepy restrooms the music and atmosphere was cool. We stayed right until closing which was a valet nightmare because everyone had to wait for their cars. They claim they had 4 guys bringing the cars around but the whole process was super slow. Even though we called for our cars on the iPad we still had to end up giving our tickets directly to one of the valet guys because they seemed clueless & we'd been waiting in the cold for over 20 minutes. \\n\\nThe place just leaves much to be desired. Having only 2 restroom stalls in a place that serves alcohol all night, the inattentive waiters, super slow valet... were 3 strikes for me.

I ordered a two taco platter, lengua and carnitas and it came with rice and beans. I also got one of my newer favorite drinks, Jamaica. I don't know what caused me to try this in the first place, curiosity maybe? But I've enjoyed it ever since that first taste. It's a little on the tart side and it's soooo good.\\n\\nIt was later in the afternoon and the shop only had five other customers there so my food came out rather quickly. A few different hot sauces to taste and I was well on my way. None were really hot, but they had good flavor to them.

Pita Palace is located at the intersection of Briarcliff Road and La Vista Road directly across the street from Whole Foods.  Most pitas will be less than $10, while the larger laffas (think a burrito, but with Mediterranean food on the inside) will be a little over $10.  You can either park in front of the restaurant or on the other end of the plaza, where there are a lot more spaces.  The ambiance isn't dazzling, but the service for take-out is great.\\n\\nHighlights: I ordered the \\"pargiyot\\" laffa, which had grilled dark meat chicken.  Originally I had wanted the shawarma, but it was sold out about an hour before closing time.  From the reaction of a more regular customer, it sounds like this has happened before, so come earlier if you want to try the shawarma.  I really liked how the server was generous with letting you take food from the salad bar.  If you don't take salad in a side container, you can still get it either in your pita or laffa.   For people with medium sized appetites, the laffa with a portion of side salad can be two lunches.  My laffa came with a lot of lightly seasoned, reasonably moist chicken. The meat in my laffa was cooked to order and prepared quickly. You can adjust the spice level as well- I ordered a 5, which is considered \\"hot\\".  I'd say there was a kick, but the laffa wasn't \\"hot\\" to my standards.  \\n\\nCritiques: While I liked the chicken for the most part, I think it could be improved if there was either less char or more seasoning.  It was nice to have a char flavor, but it almost overwhelmed the seasoning of the meat.   Some of the salad bar items were a little too sour to eat on their own.  Sauces (hummus/baba ghanoush) could be a little richer for my taste.\\n\\nOverall: You'll get decent Mediterranean sandwiches at the Pita Palace.

Personally, I found all the food to be really greasy, under seasoned and strictly unpalatable. The drinks we were poured helped a little, but that might be because we cleared a few bottles by midway through the Taste of Scotland, so it wound up being more the Taste of the Bar than anything else.\\n\\nWhat's worse, we weren't told how much the beers cost that we were drinking, so at the end of the night when the tab was split, me paying the portion JUST for me and my partner came to $115. TOTALLY ridiculous.\\n\\nThe layout of this place can be described as dark, uneven, disorganized and cramped. I mention this now because these conditions made it impossible to navigate the sea of crowded tables to try and find a member of staff, and because of the lighting, I couldn't tell which of the waiters was actually mine. The guy who wound up helping me said we had already eaten so we had to pay up, despite the fact that most of the plates went back untouched.\\n\\nI feel really scammed and disappointed with this place.

First, be prepared for an *insane* noise level. We were there on a Sunday night of a long weekend (MLK) and found that after an hour even on the early side (7 pm) we couldn't wait to get out of there.\\n\\nWe'd heard that the biscuits were the best and the sight of these \\"cat's head\\" beauties had us very excited. Sadly, they were quite gummy in the middle layers. \\n\\nThe pulled pork was tender, juicy and tasted of good meat and smoke and a little too much salt. The pulled chicken was as juicy and tasted of very delicious chicken..........and smoke. Same for the singe rib we tried - tender meat and smoke. I was hoping for more flavor.\\n\\nThe potato salad was colorfully dressed with dill which had me worried as I detest that flavor family; I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was with a good creamy flavor from the dressing without any of the often greasiness that comes with cold salads. The baked beans were some of the best I've had - often getting that much flavor into the beans (hey maybe that's where all the flavor went!) without them getting mushy but these were firm and yummy. The mac 'n' cheese had a very strange taste making us think there had to be some sort of cheese substitution; I can't imagine what we had to be worthy of much of the praise we've seen about it. Husband enjoyed the farm salad so much he inhaled it before sharing.\\n\\nI have to warn you that the butterscotch pudding is what I would call \\"dessert porn\\". It's HEAVEN in a cute little mason jar. Key lime pie was your ordinary pie, far too cold in far too thick a crust.\\n\\nThe Dollywood cocktail was refreshing and not at all too sweet, something a lot of places mess up when using lemon as a base. Be warned that the elderflower is as prominent a flavor  in the drink as is the lemon.\\n\\n\\nService is very friendly and helpful - GREAT people!\\n\\nOverall, we enjoyed our experience but don't find it worthy of a revisit unless we are local and hungry."},{"name":"Sweet Cheeks Q","address":"1381 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here on a Saturday around 3 and was seated right away.

I got the prime brisket and a onsie pork rib. The brisket was very good and the best part of the main course. Also got broccoli casserole and farm salad. Not impressed with the farm salad, it was room temp and should be served cold IMO. Would have been a nice contrast on the rest of the plate. My date got the buttermilk chicken and Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese has a very sharp cheese flavor but not overpowering. The chicken was great but very greasy (as it should be).

Diesel's latte met my somewhat high standards for espresso, but also left me wanting a little more.

The service was courteous and nice. The place is tastefully done inside with an enormous seating area downstairs with some seating upstairs and outside. They have a decent amount of variety for brunch with a 1/3 salads, some sandwiches and burgers, and the rest typical breakfast fares. I ended up trying the pecan warm crusted goat cheese salad and my friend had the chicken club. The salad was good, however I wasn't blown away by it. I ended up picking the goat cheese and pecans and leaving half the greens and I usually love salads.

The brisket is very moist, and the sharp fontina cheese complements it well. They also include onions saut√©ed and caramelized with sweet tea, and yes, it's as good as it sounds.

The truffle isn't too strong, and the rosemary gives it an earthy feel.

If you're eating even a few minutes away from a peak dinner hour, your food can literally come in 3-5 minutes.  While that's very convenient, it does, of course, send the message that the food is just sitting there waiting to be ordered.\\n\\nA highlight is the pan-fried Peking Ravioli (basically fried dumplings/potstickers for those unfamiliar).

You'd have a good crowd mix with a bit of a skew towards athletes and more-social members of the student body.  It would often serve as a perfectly-worthwhile spot to chill while you waited for the Final Club parties to build momentum.\\n\\nBut something started to happen late in my senior year (I graduated in June 09).  All of a sudden, the crowd changed--it was no longer drawing the manistream, social, \\"fun\\" Harvard undergrad crowd and started pulling more of a grad school/hipster/artsy mix.  Perhaps it was a consequence of the revamped interior design, but all of a sudden the bar started to skew a bit too \\"trendy\\"--totally counter to what Harvard kids knew about \\"The Kong.\\"  I have only been there a handful of times since graduation, but each time I went, the establishment less and less resembled the fun, somewhat trashy spot I liked hitting every weekend.\\n\\nCertainly, there are benefits to being classy; I have no problem with an audience that pushes a better dress code, a better emphasis on culture discussion and better cocktails.

From the outside it looks basic and somewhat dull. Inside, though - it's got an aesthetic blend somewhere between a typical take out place and a breakfast cafe. This isn't a mistake, seeing as though those are the two meals which they cater to.

I was early and had to wait for the others. the waitress was polite and we chatted for a bit. The ambience is stylish but a bit cramped. Our table was wobbly, the waitress warned us about it but did not offer a different table, which was weird. If you know it, fix it! We ordered potato latkes for starters which were good, but a bit too oily. We had fish and chips, the vegetarian special,  the thai prawn curry and the squash seafood special. Everything was good except the vegetarian special which was some kind of glazed aubergine with a very sweet gravy. The food took 45 minutes plus to arrive on our table, and even though they served bread with butter we were hungry. The waitress did not tell us this would take that long. the latkes came a bit early. I indicated that I was hungry, and she brought me a complimentary salad before the meal. I think it was a nice gesture and thats why I give them a three star rating. The owner did ask us how we enjoyed the food and we were polite. The food is pricey, but portions are big and the music was lovely. Oh, and they have an extensive wine list from which we ordered a nice bottle of merlot. And, the sticky coffee pudding is indeed delicious, stay clear of the cheesecake though, m-e-h!\\n\\nOverall, I would say go on the weekend when they have live music and if you are not in a hurry or starving.

She filled our drinks and once again the cook, owner/waitress walked outside and left us ALONE inside the restaurant while they were smoking again.

I have only been here ever twice and both times have left me with little desire to return.\\n\\nFirst off, the environment itself is fairly unattractive and unappealing. The way the stage and seating areas are set up in a way that makes you long for the days in which you would enjoy your junior high school's productions. At least with that, you can expect your setting to be touched up for your patronage and viewing pleasure. To make matters worse, seating is limited and so unless you reserve a table, you may find yourself having to stand with a good number of people in front of you. Thus, obscuring your view of the stage performers and risking your good time.\\n\\nThe drinks at Dante's are pretty good, though, but the bartenders are just your average joes. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but I like my bartenders to be more vibrant and memorable. Otherwise, I tend to remember the drinks more than anything else (and that's only if I don't get a hangover).\\n\\nThe pizza outlet isn't bad either and serves (no pun intended) to sate late evening munchies. Between the pizza and booze, both add to your experience when watching one of Dante's live shows. The shows themselves can be quite entertaining (I'll never forget Layne Fawke's incredible performance with her mostly one-woman show), but sometimes they can be worth a skip. So regarding entertainment, it is either a hit or miss with Dante's.\\n\\nIf only Dante's would improve upon their visual appeal then they might get a higher rating from me. If you're curious about their Sunday night entertainment and/or know any of the performers there, then I would recommend checking it out. Otherwise, feel free to give it a skip. There usually isn't much to miss here."},{"name":"Canton Cook II","address":"6690 Roswell Rd NE, Ste 410","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4","text":"The food here is tasty and delicious.

We dove in so quickly I forgot to get a picture of the dish as it was served so I included the empty dish instead to show how much we loved it.

The coffee is soooo wonderful (various blends of organic richness), and they offer fresh-squeezed OJ and a juiced orange, carrot, ginger, and lemon concoction.

We ordered a bunch of small dishes, including the pork belly, burratta, and some kind of cheesy pasta that was to die for.

I told him how much I appreciated his demeanor on the phone while I was making my reservation and that I went a long way in setting the stage for a lovely dinner. Within a few minutes he sent over some complimentary champagne to welcome us (first timers).  Very nice touch. We ordered the filet mignon and the sea bass. I had the sea bass that was prepared beautifully with some pumpkin butter and served over Brussels sprouts cooked with bacon. It was delicious. My friend however did not like the way here filet was prepared and before we even had a chance to say something out server and the manager were already at our table offering to make her another plate. They took her plate away and before I knew it they took my half eaten sea bass away. I asked why? And they said they wanted to prepare both meals fresh so that we could eat simultaneously and so that my fish didn't get cold. That is the first time a restaurant has Ever done that!! Absolutely top notch. Our food came out again and it was a perfect 10! It was prepared perfectly. Our server, Wesley, was quite possibly the nicest most genuine server I've ever encountered. He showed a true passion for his work and a genuine love for the restaurant business as a whole. \\nWe ordered dessert and as hard as it is to pick favorites it was the favorite part of our meal. It was a blondie brownie with espresso ice cream and a sauce that was out of this world. I know it sounds basic/boring but I assure you it doesn't taste like that!!!! \\nOn our way out our server followed us to the door and held the door open for us!

Steak was cooked perfectly for us, however both couples on either side got theirs after, and were well overcooked. (We got ours medium rare, the others ordered the same, but it was definitely almost even well done on one of them). The food was very tasty and atmosphere is calm, minus being so close to the other patrons. Our least favorite part was honestly our server. He just seemed almost a little rude, which we didn't appreciate at all. We were irritated at some points, didnt pay much attention to us. I understand it was a very crowded time to go, but service to us is almost more important than food quality.

With Gari, take away the robotic trash cans, the low backed bar stools (which are terribly uncomfortable - we moved to a table), the cute waitresses, and the slick presentation of the rolls, and you are left with very average sushi.

Your mind will draw a blank if you order these. Bigger than Taco Mac wings (how is that even possible) and crispier and juicier than any fried chicken wings I've had.\\n2.

I've never gone wrong with nearly any order. The fried tofu in any dish is so good! My parents had a few complaints:\\n\\n1. Vegetables: too oily (but seriously. Is that a complaint? The oilier the better, in my book).\\n2. Eggplant: too sweet (I mean... It's sweet and sour for a reason!) although I do agree that the flavor of the eggplant was a little too sweet.

Very articulate n customer focussed, always smiling n giving input for food n drinks. Know all the techniques to serve u ur meal. \\nI hav been here couple of times n inspite of the fact that there is a long waiting ( sometimes u even have to book ur table an hour earlier by physically coming there n then they take ur details to let u know when its ready) so basically they try to give best management of their service. \\nBut once u r in. They r at ur service. Whatever i had here was litle expensive then other places but delicious of all. Bellini here is my favourite drink. Salads for healthy people n they r delicious. Pretty decent portions. \\nSummers n crowd of canada place can be enjoyed from there patio . Huge seating on all sides .

I also made the horrible mistake of coming here on a night with a Red Sox game before the start of the game. Don't do that unless you enjoy waiting. The one nice thing was our waitress who was friendly and regularly checked up on us. As for the food, this is your average American steakhouse, so the food is somewhat unexciting. However, our primary reason for going here was to eat the Texas Tonion (their knockoff of Outback's Bloomin' Onion), which we found so-so and absolutely horrible to eat cold, so don't let it sit around the table all night! Then again, that's pretty difficult as the portion sizes are enormous. Take the chocolate stampede for example. Imagine a slice of cake at your typical restaurant. Now, double it. Place two of those double-sized slices of cake with two giant scoops of ice cream and top it with a giant pile of whipped cream. I thought I was going to hurl just by looking at it and ended up sheepishly picking at the ice cream wondering why we ordered this. This restaurant is an epitome of American gastronomical excessiveness, which should be obvious from the Texan theme. Oh, and don't take your vegetarian girlfriend here.

The second time was during lunch and we had to sit at a table outside, which was ok, it was a nice day out so we had no complaints about that. \\n\\nThe first time we went I got the vegan burger. They fail to tell you (it's not noted on the menu either) that it doesn't automatically come with cheese, so I didn't know I needed to ask for cheese. So I had no cheese on my burger. Turned out to not be a big deal, because my burger only looked like a burger until my first bite. The vegan burger had a good flavor to it and was really moist, but it was too moist so that it just turned into mush and I had to eat it with a fork. Disappointing.\\n\\nThe second time there I tried the grilled cheese. I have a dairy allergy so I got their vegan cheese. I can't recall exactly what it tasted like, but it was such a strong/bad flavor that I ended up squeezing the cheese out of my sandwich and just eating the bread. There was a TON of the cheese on the sandwich too, so I guess if you end up liking the flavor of it then you'll love that they give you so much. For me though, it was just a ton of cheese to squeeze out/scrape off. \\n\\nWe did have the truffle fries the first time we ate here.

I just went back there today and the first sandwich I picked up was leaking fluid all over the place, so I grabbed one from the opposite end. I got back to work and guess what--STALE!!

They don't leave a single touch out - from good service to amazing food - everything adds up to an amazing experience.  When we went (on a Thursday night), there was no wait and most of the tables in the small space were taken.  It appears that there were only two people working - the chef and the waitress.  This did not seem to impact things coming out quickly.  Or maybe it was that we were having such a fantastic time we didn't notice if things were taking long.  Regardless, we had two great bottles of wine, two appetizers (roasted beet salad and clams with fennel, tomatoes, and BACON), and our entrees were PHENOMENAL.  Both ladies at the table ordered the herb gnocchi which were pan fried crispy and stuffed with goat cheese.  YUM!!!!  The men ordered more meaty fare: sirlion with seared foie gras and bolognese with veal cheeks.  The sirlion was like BUTTER so delicious and the bolognese was very stew-like with eggy noodles.  Everything was amazingly tasty and perfectly prepared.  Each entree was only $14.  There were other things on the menu that looked really good - a sea bass, a roasted quail, a rabbit dish.  If they're on the menu next time, I'll try something new - I don't think anything there would be \\"risky\\" to order.  Everything is good.  For dessert, we ordered BOTH items they had on the menu (we're gluttons!)  They had strawberries with basil ice cream and a chocolate cake with creme anglaise.  Again, no complaints here - they were both SO GOOD.  We all had a good laugh because the table next to us got their desserts (they also ordered one of each) just before we did and when we had devoured ours like starving hyenas we looked over and the table next to us hadn't even made a dent in theirs.

It's one of the best in America. Only, it's better in Austin because you are not paying New York or San Francisco prices. So...be hungry, my friends! \\n\\nThey have the choice cuts you won't find everywhere in town: Fatty Salmon (Sake Toro) and Yellow Tail Cheek (Hamachi Kama). We show up a bit early and always order the hamachi kama first thing when we sit down. They always run out. \\n\\nTheir preparations are artful, which is a necessary part of any good sushi experience. The flavor combinations are explosive, creative and tasty without sacrificing the simplicity of tradition. On that note, there is a \\"USA rolls\\" menu where you can get your fix of fish with jalapenos or whatever floats your ski-doo. And the quality of the fish is top notch all around. \\n\\nOver the years, the sunomuno has gotten smaller and less flavorful. That's probably the only complaint I've ever made here. There are many fine apps choices, though. One of my favorites, the Gyu Tataki, I call the \\"meat martini\\". They do a monkfish liver which has the tantalizing moniker \\"fois gras of the sea\\". Both are done very well. \\n\\nA good tempura is done for whose who want cooked food. It's hot and light. As simple as tempura seems, I'm amazed at how many places screw it up one way or another. Not Musashino. \\n\\nThe waitstaff is largely a bunch of young, but professional, far east Asian girls. The menu used to boast \\"Tokyo Style\\" and encouraged you to hail down your waitress at any time with the Japanese: \\"Suima Sen!\\". I've never seen anyone do it and could never bring myself to do it as, honestly, the whole Japanese class system is a bit old. But I'm guessing that there must have been a rash of \\"Suima Sen\\"s lately, for that part of the menu is now gone. But the service is there. \\n\\nThere is a good Sake selection here. \\n\\nBeware the tuna selections with no prices. Apparently fine tuna can be like fine wine. I personally don't get it. They have bluefin and another type which is far pricier. Once, we blindly asked for a piece of good fatty tuna. The waitress perked up and brought us back a fine single nigiri. She then started gushing about how envious she was for what we were about to eat. One bite for myself and one bite for my wife and we just finished the first $18 piece of sushi we had ever had. A single piece. \\n\\nOver the last 10 years, I've watched a decadent dinner for two, creep up from just under $80 to close to $100.

Above the rotating spits, you'll find their basic menu offering.\\n\\nI ordered the Mixed Chicken and Beef Donair ($6.50 for the \\"super\\" size) + $2 for a can of pop. It seemed like the lady that was serving me didn't understand English very well and was a bit confused.\\n\\nMy donair was fairly basic with just cucumbers, meat, and sauce. The beef inside the pita was actually quite tender and there was plenty of meat inside this donair. I think I'm going to need to come back for a revisit to try their tabbouleh.\\n\\nTwo months later, I came back for an unexpected visit (well, unexpected for me). I immediately noticed that they've updated their menu on the rear wall and it seems cleaner and easier to read. I took an order of Lebanese Chicken Donair to go ($5.99) which included hummus and tabouleh, lettuce, onions, cucumbers, tzatziki, and hot sauce along with the slightly charred chicken. Needless to say, this was a bit messy to eat. Service was a bit better as there was a different lady that was working the counter and understood what I wanted to order."},{"name":"Dan's Hamburgers - Austin","address":"5602 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"RESTAURANT INSPECTION SCORE: 76 (07/29/2011)\\n\\nDan's is one of those places you can skip for several years, come back, and most things still haven't changed.  You can still see the same people working at the counter as were there many years ago.  Indeed that happened on my last visit on November 9th, 2011, while I was killing time before an appointment at Austin Wheelchair across the street.\\n\\nNow, in order to appreciate Dan's, you have to get your order right.  You have to order exactly:\\n\\n1) A cheeseburger (any cheeseburger will do)\\n2) A milkshake (any flavor will do), and\\n3) Onion rings.\\n\\nNow, mark my words: You have to get all three, or it's just plain wrong.  I made a beeline for the jalapeno cheeseburger, paired with a chocolate milkshake.  But I took a left turn at onion rings and ordered fries instead.  Clearly, I must have taken a leave of my sense of gustation.  Yes, I screwed up, but it still turned out alright.\\n\\nThe cheeseburger was delicious, as was the m-m-m-milkshake.  The fries were just average, though, and I honestly thought Dan's should have done better.  I like mine with ketchup, and I found it annoying that the trick ketchup bottle on my table emitted far more ketchup from around the rim of the lid than from the tip.\\n\\nIf you come during peak times, beware that this particular Dan's location has a rather open seating arrangement.  You will feel somewhat like you're loaded on a crowded schoolbus, with about 100 of your closest friends.  It's definitely different than the Dan's down south on Manchaca, where the tables have a degree of separation.  I don't expect a lot of creature comforts with my fast food, but I would like to be a little bit more at peace while dining.\\n\\nAs noted by my friend Rooster, the bathroom is sketchy, especially  in the cleanliness department.  An even scarier thought is the signage that reminds employees to wash their hands.  It's one of those rare times when you worry that hand washing when leaving the bathroom will NOT be an improvement on personal hygiene.\\n\\nAll-in-all, Dan's is still A-OK, mostly for the deliciousness and flavor.  Between the lack of ambiance and the lack of decent \\"facilities\\", I'd recommend you make it an order to-go."},{"name":"El Arroyo 5th Street","address":"1624 W 5th St","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Overcharged.

Yet this didn't seem to be the case during my early evening visit today with my daughter and best friend. When we entered the Walpole location there were staff (young women) standing at the hostess station but not a single person stopped to greet us. We were simply asked how many were in our party. Then we were taken to a booth in a section of the restaurant that was darker than the rest of the establishment. The only other diners was a large family who were focused on their food. As I went to enter the booth I noticed crumbs and debris were on the bench. I called the waitress over to clean it. She got a paper towel after consulting with a colleague, never made an attempt to clean it and asked if we wanted to change our seats. We agreed, moving to a more populated section that was better lighted. Our waitress was pleasant but, did not bus the table properly. We had eaten multiple baskets of rolls (3 to be exact), which were delicious but not as hot as I remembered. The remnants from our ribs and fries appetizer was also on the table. Another finger licking dish that the three of us shared. As more plates arrived my friend had to tell the waitress to remove the dirty dishes to make room. The pulled pork, country fried chicken and 10 ounce sirloin were plentiful and well seasoned. The highlight of the meal was the cheesecake with strawberries which the three of us shared.

Not fall off the bone tender or otherwise outstanding but I would order them again. The sliced pork was pretty good but the beef was pedestrian at best. It tasted more like roast beef than BBQ beef to me. The Brunswick stew was meaty and filling but the taste was just okay to me.  I prefer a little more vinegary type of stew. The beans were very good too.  Wife's Mac and cheese got sent back, it seemed overcooked and stale to her, but the collards she got as a replacement were delicious.

In fact, we only saw eight of ten options come around before we asked for the check because we were waiting way too long between choices. For the record, I think our server could tell things weren't going smoothly, and she did her best to fix it, but it looked and sounded like the issues were in the kitchen. We paid close to $100 per couple, and we were prepared to spend more, but we just weren't blown away. \\n\\nAnyway, the manager did come around and ask us what we thought, but when you're out with visitors (especially ones that go home the next day), you don't really want to ruin the night by complaining.

The bar area is tiny and a little crowded but since we had no choice we were seated at a table for six (there were two of us). Our hostess insisted on clearing the table of the unused settings even tho we were very crowded with the table next door so we had to pass all empty plates and settings to her per her request. Our server arrived Alex, and greeted us and got us water. He then told us that someone else would be serving us and left. Later on Avery came by to tell us it was his table but he was busy and would come back. We just sat there waiting. Eventually he came back and took our order. We ordered the grilled Romaine a cocktail and two glasses of wine. I asked him to recommend a sweet Riesling non dry. About ten minutes later the food came out and the wine at the same time. The grilled Romaine was very good. The wine I asked my server to recommend was exactly the opposite of what I asked for. Avery had a hard time opening the bottles. First he didn't have a wine opener then he kept breaking the cork. It really appeared that he had not done this before. \\nOur experience was mediocre at best. We left with a bad taste.

Calamari was enjoyable. Sesame crusted tuna was also quite good. The problems started with my main: a medium rare ribeye steak. It looked great with nice grill marks but the steak had an extremely burnt odor. I was extremely hungry so I thought I'd soldier on and try and eat the rest. Couldn't manage more than half before the taste of gas was just too much. We eventually told the server(my brother ordered the same thing) that they were just not edible. He suggested that we can ask for it pan-fried the next time but offered no compensation(either monetary or to remake the dish). He was an attentive server and he may have had no choice in the matter so I don't blame him. Unfortunately my review of any restaurant does tend to solely depend on the food. If you are sensitive to burnt odors and flavors I'd avoid ordering the steak. An offer to change something for the next visit doesn't help because this visit guaranteed it would be my last. $24 out the window.\\n\\nFull disclosure: I have dined in many steak places from the keg to hy's and ruth's chris so I am fairly experienced with eating steak.

For those unfamiliar with Spanish food it's a gentle but faithful enough introduction who can try Jamon Serrano (Southern Spain style Ham), or Spanish tortilla (which is a puffy omelot more potato-y than eggy)  Those more familiar will be drawn back by croquettes, seafood, and various stews.  \\n\\nOf the 5 tapas dishes I had, shared between two people, two of them were great, two were good, and one was alright.  I remember finding the croquettes especially delicious as well as an item with lentils.  The benefit of tapas is obviously since they are small you can order and bunch and sort of pick and choose with your partner.  I'd recommend picking a couple items you think you'd really like and then a couple that seem potentially good but exotic.  \\n\\nThere are straight up one-person plates too if you wish to go that route.  And the ever so important sangria is pretty damn yummy.  \\n\\nThe Spanish eating experience is a very different social and dining experience and this a recreating of that per se.  But that doesn't mean it doesn't succeed on its own merits.  It's better than Dali's in taste and cost, fun, exciting, efficient service, fair pricing and again overall solid food.

I'm not going into detail on their entire menu...It's has a little bit of everything from Steak Tips to Fish to Pasta and I or anyone I've known that has been there have never had a complaint! I can only say if you are looking for great food and drink don't miss out! Parking next door is 25 cents an hour in the garage 24/7.

Now having said that, it's not that hard. The food was mediocre at best. Now starting from the very beginning, when we walked in and asked to be placed on the waiting list they said we don't have a list but assured us we were next because of our small party size. We had to wait outside in the rain and about five minutes into our wait another customer walks up to the front says she has a party of three like I did and gets seated immediately. I had to go up to the hostess and remind her that we have been waiting her response was oh I went outside to ask who was next and you guys were gone. That was a clear lie because we were right outside of the door watching the whole thing go down. Eventually we were seated after they made the other customer that took our table move. We sat down, placed our order and the waitress didn't write anything down so we assumed she would get it right. WRONG! She forgot half of my order and when I asked for the missing items they were never brought over to the table. Our server never came back to check on us not once....At the end of our experience we had to ask for the bill 3 times...This was just an overall bad experience and I won't be returning. They really need to reevaluate how they run their business and implement the small changes that can make a big difference starting with;  keep a wait list so you can manage the line of hungry customers, then also write down every order so they don't forget items from customers order.

There have been more than a few occasions where the food just tasted like the ingredients had been frozen or on their last day of being useable. You could really tell in the produce; particularly the tomatoes which had the consistency of mush and the color of well...mush (whatever color that may be...in my case a light pink).\\n\\nThe only redeeming qualities they still excel in is their service and their tres leches cake which is mind-bendingly good. One of the only things that is still consistently good and, shockingly enough, fresh.\\n\\nI think the culprit of their inconsistency may be a rotating array of head chefs/cooks.

If Junior's really wasn't all that, how come there aren't ANY two or one star reviews? Never mind the fact that the ABYSMAL food that La Fogata serves yields them a rather respectable three star rating. Total BS. If you want authentic, don't order something that originates from the complete opposite side of the country (fish tacos) -- that's like going to Kansas City and ordering kalbi. And for crying out loud, don't order a quesadilla and then complain about authenticity, it screams ignorant gringo/a.\\n\\nAlright, end rant. \\n\\nHere's why I gave Junior's four stars: fucking awesome lengua. And it's improved significantly in the past year. What was once fairly tender lengua is now, very tender, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. A couple drops of red sauce, a line of green (for moisture), with chopped onion and cilantro? And maybe a bite or two of clarifying radishes? It's the most well composed three bites of Mexican tacos between 315 and 71.\\n\\nWhen I'm not eating four lengua tacos, I'm having a burrito or a torta.

They make an amazing cheeseburger, and the fries are to die for.  Sadly, the chicken sandwich we usually ordered that was also always amazing now always seems to come bland, dry, and just... blah.  I also always try every restaurant's Greek selection, and I'm usually a tough person to please given that I grew up with all that food home-cooked or from down in Astoria, NY, and I did find AK's Greek food to be very tasty.  Unfortunately they don't have too much of a selection (I tend to shy away from lamb, but when I went to order one dish that usually also comes in pork, beef and chicken, they only had it in lamb and that wasn't listed on their menu).  \\n\\nThey don't usually have good specials unless you have a huge group order you need to place, so don't expect too much, but if you live on the hill it is definitely worth a try."},{"name":"Lure","address":"1106 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Everything is delicious  at this establishment.

The Roasted Pork Belly was the highlight of our meal for sure! \\n\\nFor my entr√©e, I ordered the Spring Risotto, which was said to have asparagus, sweet peas, prosciutto, mascarpone and parmesan. First off I only got half of an asparagus, so that was a tad disappointing, but the other flavors in the dish were \\"good.\\" However the prosciutto was a little bit tough, and against the more mushy consistency of the risotto and peas, it stood out to me more than it probably would have.

I wish there had been a meat chili option -- more power to vegetarians, but the whole point of chili is the meat, so veggie chili is a little anticlimactic. Still, the seasoning was excellent, and between the cheese and sour cream, I almost didn't miss it. Extra points for the super-spicy fresh jalapenos.\\n\\nEveryone at the table loved their entrees, but my BLT was the best, if I do say so myself: a generous pita wrap spread with creamy, mild cloumage cheese, littered with fresh greens and ripe tomatoes, and crowned with a huge tangle of crispy bacon. Clearly they understand the point of a BLT! In place of mayonnaise I had asked for a side of their jalapeno aioli, which was the perfect complement. I actually couldn't finish it, so we shared bites around the table. Everyone was astounded. Another bonus: they allow you to order salad instead of fries for no additional charge, so I didn't feel too terrible about my food choices!\\n\\nWe were too stuffed for dessert, but my husband's margherita pizza was so huge he took half of it home -- and ate it for breakfast the next morning.

The Veggie Enchiladas were good, but I didn't like the fact that the enchiladas were served atop the rice and beans.  The rice and beans were actually great, but when mixed with the enchiladas, it just turns into some kind of casserole.  Either way, it was okay, but the enchiladas didn't seem to have enough flavor or substance to stand on their own. I also had the Pork Green Chile, which was decent as well, though it did seem a little too watery and not quite spicy enough for a green chile.\\n\\nThe biggest item I'm a fan of at Centro though, was their Sophia Bonita Margarita.  It's a blackberry & vanilla infused tequila with limejuice, agave syrup and a jalapeno slice.  The one awesome bartender (blonde girl) suggested I have it made a little spicier by adding some jalapeno infused tequila, which really made the marg much, much better.  Because of that, I ended up having several and ended up meeting the cute girls sitting next to me drinking the same exact thing.  Ironically, the super cute one was also named Sophia and I suddenly found myself between a pair of really Bonita Sophia's.

It's located along a block of dry cleaners and random stores so it's quite easy to miss.  However, I think that adds to Gari's charm - the quality of its food and its tendency to be overlooked, especially among the many sushi restaurants in Coolidge Corner, makes it a gem and a delight to par take in.  \\n\\nGari has all the standard sushi rolls, a fair selection of sake and makes a surprisingly excellent steak.  Yes, you heard right - even their steak is good.  Not only is the food good (I think better than Fugakyu or Ginza), but they're meticulous in their presentation as well.  Each dish comes lovingly garnished and decorated.  Their attention to food reminds me of the restaurants I used to frequent in Tokyo.  Moreover, since it's so small, the chef is very accommodating and when they're not busy they'll glad whip up anything you desire.\\n\\nThe decor of Gari is probably aptly described as modern with a colorful flair (but not in obscene manner).  The owners made good use of the limited space they have.  It's a very comfortable setting to have dinner in.  Plus, the last few times I had been there, the other guests at the restaurant appeared to be the neighborhood crowd - that contributed to Gari's friendly mood.\\n\\nA couple of things that I don't mind but nevertheless thing you should consider are: 1. If you have a large group definitely call ahead and 2. The waitress seems to have difficulties with English.  It's not that she doesn't understand what you're saying but she repeats everything you say to her just to confirm.

I'd say skip the starbucks on the corner and keep your business in the community."},{"name":"Old Country Pizzeria","address":"672 Washington St","city":"Stoughton","stars":"3.5","text":"You down with OCP? Yeah, you know me.\\n\\nI am a lifelong friend of the lovely family that runs Old Country Pizzeria. Veteran fans may remember the glory days of  the original Pizza Palace in the center of Norwood (under new ownership for a decade now), but alas, that was in a past life, and their fine establishment now finds itself parked just out of my reach in Stoughton - not that that's stopped me. Despite our lengthy history (which may set off conflict-of-interest bells), I am fully comfortable putting my reputation and credibility as a Yelper on the line in endorsing this excellent establishment.\\n\\nI have eaten food prepared by their family hundreds of times in my lifetime, leaving me intimately aware of all the wholesome goodness they have to offer. My biggest gripe is that they don't serve more authentic Greek dishes, as they would certainly make a killing. Their baklava alone has become a legendary staple of a dessert for those that are familiar with its sweet, flaky perfection, and unlike their pastitsio or Easter lamb on a spit, can actually be purchased here. Don't miss it.\\n\\nAnyway, let's get to the grub.\\n\\nAnyone that's experienced the Greek pizza shop scene in the greater Boston area will be no stranger to their atmosphere, pricing, and menu offerings. However, OCP is a cut above the rest when it comes to quality and consistency. Their pizzas have a wonderful golden glow to them, and their crust is unobtrusive, with a high, thin profile, a nice initial crunch, and a soft interior. Oil slicks are nowhere to be found on these slices. Their subs are delicious in every variety, and consistency has not waned over the lifetime I've spent eating them. Their miscellaneous fryer items are also hot, crispy, and delicious, with their mozzarella sticks being a personal guilty favorite.\\n\\n...\\nSee, that's all well and good, but you can forget everything I've said about pizza and subs, because you're going to be ordering a Greek salad. Their choice of feta is unique and mouth-watering, and they aren't shy with it either as they top a consistently fresh bed of lettuce, thinly sliced red onions, pepperoncini and friends. The jewel in the crown is the homemade creamy Greek dressing, which may indeed ruin you for other Greek dressings. Treat yourself to some grilled chicken atop that bad boy while you're at it, as theirs is consistently moist on the inside with a pleasantly mild char on the outside. The next time you source a salad from elsewhere, whose mis-cut lettuce, flavorless feta, and Ken's Greek dressing makes you want to cry, you SHOULD cry, because you missed out on Greek salad nirvana from the OCP corral.\\n\\nI cannot vouch for their delivery, as I live well outside their delivery range, but their interior is simple, clean, and welcoming, with ample parking immediately outside. My mother works in the area and never fails to mention the popularity of OCP with her coworkers for lunchtime delivery.\\n\\nThis may all sound like hyperbole - after all, it's a pizza shop, not the French Laundry - but after suffering a lengthy string of disappointments at the hands of average, apathetic, truly uninspiring pizza joints all across Massachusetts (as I'm sure you all have), I can appreciate a diamond in the rough when I see it. If you're looking for a quick, no-hassle bite to eat for lunch or dinner and pizza shops are on the brain, definitely consider giving OCP a shot. Four stars for quality, consistency, friendliness, and dressing."},{"name":"Maggiano's Little Italy","address":"1601 Cumberland Mall SE, Ste 200","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"For the price, if I were having a special event, I'd look elsewhere first.

I'm not expecting a five-star experience but all the salsas were the wrong color, the lemons were chopped into quarter pieces (who even does that?), and the chicken in my cabana bowl was cold. It was fine, nothing to complain about. Even though I love getting more alcohol when I didn't ask for it, we'll probably be going to the taco cabana on riverside.

Once the group looked at the buffett they immediately all left and the blonde went back to her phone. The food itself is average. My recommendation is ...

(name on receipt).  He was nice enough in the beginning. He did have to come back a couple of times because we couldn't decide on the beer we wanted for the tower order and food as well.  But as time went on, he got just a tad bit more aloof with us.  I can't remember if he checked how we found the meal.  We asked for containers for leftovers and we had to hunt him own to provide us with our check (we figured asking for containers was a clear sign of us being done).  What I do remember is his face when I told him that we have cash and 4 cards.  I understand it's a pain to process this. But c'mon, I'm sure it's not the first time you've had to do it especially in this day and age when hardly anybody carries cash anymore.  He projected an attitude when he took our payment.  And when he came back with receipts to sign and our cards, he just placed it on the table and quickly left.  We just thought that was kind of odd and rude.  As we were leaving, we walked by him and he looked away with a scowl on his face. I was going to say thank you and have a nice day.  Maybe he was having a bad day or he found us annoying, but clearly he shouldn't be making it so obvious since we are paying customers.\\n\\nI will be come back to this establishment, but hopefully I won't be served by him again."},{"name":"Yuu Japanese Tapas","address":"1118 - 3779 Sexsmith Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Was introduced here by a friend and absolutely love the food here!

My GF got the volcano roll for 16.00 and it was worth 8.00 consisting of very small amounts of shrimp, scallops and fake crab, garnished with a bunch of filler crap such as string mushroom and some other slop I couldn't even make out, maybe 8 pieces total. OK now to my order. I was in a great mood and wanted to give the sushi chefs the opportunity to wow me so I told the waitress that I love everything and wanted to have them make me something creative and special with a price point of 25-30 dollars consisting of sushi and sashimi and that I like tempura. Now lets just look at the sushi and sashimi platter for 1 on their menu and it consists of ten pieces of sushi, additional sashimi and a roll for 28.00. I asked them to get creative and I got 4 pieces of sushi a roll that was very good but consisted of 5 pieces and another roll that was fake crab, avocado, and rice rolled in thin cucumber. This place had the opportunity to wow me and they fell so so short. I kept telling my GF that this couldn't be it and that they were going to send out another plate of sashimi but that was it. I asked the waitress if there was anything else coming out and she said no. She clearly knew that I was unimpressed and continued to charge me 29,00 the top of my price point, money for me is not the issue as I will pay top dollar as long as it's worth it.

Don't ask for any dressing for your salad, thank you, they have their own they are sharing that you just enjoy! Don't ask for rolls because they only serve fresh from the oven loafs of warm bread and real butter patties that you are guaranteed so good! How about a red sauce they have that is some of the best you will ever eat. I always ask for an extra bowl of red sauce for the bread at the beginning of the meal and guess that is why I can OD on the bread. But do be sure to allow the family to help you enjoy a unique restaurant experience at a price that does not leave a bad feeling the next day for spending so much money the night before.

Please keep that in mind.\\n\\nI love sushi. I consider myself sushi-knowledgeable (I worked at a sushi place for a while). I love the high end stuff. But unfortunately, I can't always afford the high-end stuff. So when I want decent sushi at low prices, I go to Ru San's Tower Place.\\n\\nHere's the problem. I've tried most of the Ru San's in the city (Ansley Mall, Edgewood Center, Kennesaw), and all of them have been very \\"meh\\" in the quality department - even for Ru San's standards. Tower Place has the BEST sushi of all of the Ru San's I've tried. Decent, for low-end sushi. Definitely edible, and at times even pretty enjoyable. For sushi quality alone, I give Ru San's Tower Place a 4 - it is what it is, but it's not terrible.\\n\\nSo why the 1.5-2 star rating? SERVICE. Oh my god, the service here is HORRIBLE.\\n\\nI went just a couple of days ago, and the server said exactly eight words to us in the 45 minutes we were there (yes, I counted - mostly because in the first 20 minutes, he said zero words to us). None of them were friendly or welcoming.\\n\\nWe waited 20 minutes for our waters, no drink order was ever taken, and a nearby table got one water, to \\"share\\" apparently, between two people because their server (same guy) couldn't be bothered to bring them BOTH their OWN waters. (For the record, this happened on the Wednesday of the ice storm - there were maybe six occupied tables in the whole restaurant.)\\n\\nThis isn't an isolated experience, either. I have had servers get my order hopelessly wrong, argue with me about the menu (FYI - the Bibi roll does NOT have masago; the menu says so!!), treat me like garbage, etc. etc. Only once (time before last - a week or ten days ago perhaps) have I ever had acceptable service - it was slow, but the server was very friendly (it was a server I don't see around much, but she really should be there more! I liked her!).\\n\\nI am an ex-server (with sushi experience, even), and I know how to treat servers. I'm an impeccable customer, so there isn't any reason I should be treated like such garbage. It's a shame really - I keep going because their sushi is the best of the low-end sushi, but with service like this...it's going to be hard to keep justifying the visits...\\n\\nMy advice? Save up and go to Sushi Yu-Ka across the street, or any number of higher-end sushi places in the area. Better service, better sushi, and only very slightly higher prices. This kind of service is just really not worth it (unless you just REALLY need a frequent sushi fix)."},{"name":"Jim & Patty's Coffee","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4.5","text":"Extensive menu with all sorts of coffee and food items!

Being grad students, this was the perfect splurge for us. Basically you order off 2 typed of pre-fixe menus with wine pairings; Barcelona or tuscany. We had two gluten-free diners in our party, who they were able to accommodate with the given menu. \\n\\nI chose the Barcelona menu. The starter or app was a crostini with chorizo, quail egg, and shavings of some greens. It was perfectly seasoned and definitely left me wanting more. The main entree was a braised pork with rice and spinach. The pork and sauce that came with it...absolutely delicious. I literally tried to scrape off every single smear of that sauce. The reason for the 1 star off is due to their rice. 4 out of 6 of us had the Barcelona menu and we all agreed that it wasn't up to par. At first we thought it was undercooked, they definitely had a crunch when you bit. However the best way to describe it was that the rice was maybe a day old and was left our a bit so it dried out. This was likely the case as most of the rice was fine, just a bit crunchy in some bites. Did it warrant a complaint? No, it's still edible and we're not that difficult. The dessert was a churro with delicious chocolate sauce and sea salt. The churro was meh, nothing spectacular. It was definitely saved by the chocolate sauce.\\n\\nOf course the wine pairings were perfectly matched with each meal. In the back they were having tasting parties, and you can even purchase from their extensive selection. A friend of mine actually got to taste a few before she ended up purchasing a really good malbec.\\n\\nOur server was great. She was super friendly and explained each course and wine pairing that came out. Wines obviously came out first (which we much appreciated) and food shortly after.\\n\\nWould we come here again for a fun wine night? Most likely yes. We'd maybe try dining again, but honestly only if there was a deal again. Don't get me wrong, food was delicious (other than the rice issue and mediocrity of the churro). But after our meal we definitely went looking for food elsewhere, so that has to say something."},{"name":"Old Hickory House","address":"2202 Northlake Pkwy","city":"Tucker","stars":"3.5","text":"Best BBQ in the south!

In a sitting you can go from goat cheese fritters to well seasoned crab cakes with salsa to braised short rib to roasted duck.  I have yet to have a dish there that I have not enjoyed.  The bread and humus that is provided with the meal is wonderful\\nIn terms of d√©cor, it has a great atmosphere, seating is certainly close, but by no means is it too close.  The dining areas have low light and there is often very nice Spanish guitar music played either live or through speakers.  The background music helps dim out the other conversations around you without losing the ability to hear others in your party.\\nFor service, I have yet to have a bad experience.  The waiters are always busy, but attentive and more than willing to grab you an extra pitcher of sangria or basket of bread.

You don't grill iceberg. It gets mushy.  Romaine can be grilled. The 1/5 wedge (tiny for $8) had too much oil and they added two greasy dressings on top. Our waiter put our bill in wrong and charged us twice and quite frankly the whole experience was rushed.

The lunch is solid, though not world ending, but the breakfast ranks up there with the best i've had in Austin. \\n\\nLunch fare is typical burger joint, featuring burgers, fries, onion rings, shakes, and so forth. On a thursday afternoon, i had a bacon cheeseburger, and onion rings. I thought the burger was proportioned well, and was the right kind of greasy (as in, the burger had the right amount of fat in the patty, and the flat top was properly greased, but not drenched in oil). The bacon was crisp and flavorful, and the bun was tasty without trying to dominate. All in all, a quality greasy burger, that easily makes my top 10 Austin burgers, though probably doesn't quite crack the top 5. The onion rings were outstanding. obviously hand breaded, the were cooked to a deep golden brown, just the way i like them. The onions themselves were thin, but not stringy, and had a good, fresh, sweet taste to them. With a dash of salt, they were easily the best part of my meal, and are on par with the O-rings from Top Notch, my current favorite in Austin. \\n\\nLunch service (at least when i went, mid afternoon) was order at the counter, and then served to your table. Breakfast service, on the other hand, is full service with a friendly waitstaff. My cousin and i ate there on a recent saturday morning, and i had been by myself the week before. The key to breakfast at Dan's is the biscuits and gravy. an order is two large, hearty, house-made biscuits, drenched in a fantastic homemade sausage gravy. This is more than enough by itself, but it doesn't hurt to add a couple eggs and some hash browns. I take my eggs over easy, and whoever made them has a great deal of practice. As any short order cook knows, cooking yolks to the desired doneness while keeping the whites perfectly, well, white, is very difficult and requires lots of practice. Whoever made my eggs had that practice in spades. The hash browns were shredded potatoes, crispy on the outer edges, soft on the inside, and absolutely delicious. The prices were very reasonable, the service friendly and fast (leave a good size tip, its not their fault the place isn't expensive), and the food outstanding. \\n\\nI've a simple rule about breakfast joints: If the average age of the breakfast clientele appears to be 65 or older, you are probably going to have a good experience. Many people say you should hit up Dan's for lunch, and they are not wrong. But to have the best Dan's experience, go with the retirees for breakfast!"},{"name":"Yuzu","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave, Ste H","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"I'm full.\\n\\nLike Don B. said, its a hole in the wall.

And, to be honest, I kind of like the place.\\n\\nOther reviewers have described the food here as \\"Americanized,\\" \\"[un]memorable,\\" \\"[no]thing special,\\" and \\"meh.\\" I suppose they're not wrong. In the same way that Chipotle's \\"gourmet burritos and tacos\\" are hardly a reflection of some authentic pan-Mexican cuisine, Piada's \\"Italian street food\\" isn't supposed to be anything extraordinary. But that doesn't mean it's not filling, convenient, highly customizable, and fairly tasty.\\n\\nWhile I haven't actually had a piada here, I'm a fan of the pasta bowls, filled with angel hair pasta and a grill item, topped with vegetables and sauce. The crispy chicken fritte isn't too bad -- it's fairly flavorful and tender, and the reviewer who compared it to a McChicken patty either received a total dud or hadn't been to a McDonald's in a while. The Italian sausage is pleasant enough, as well.\\n\\nStill, perhaps my favorite part of the pasta bowl-building process is Piada's spread of vegetable toppings and sauces. There are all sorts of fresh greens, from spinach to arugula to romaine to a simple blend of mixed greens. And there's cucumber and eggplant and artichokes and tomatoes and red onions and beans and cheeses and ... I could go on. The diavolo sauce -- spicy tomatoes, garlic, and chili peppers -- isn't spicy at all, but it's still quite good.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is actually quite elegant, but this is sort of lost on the customer, since this place gets absolutely slammed and chaotic at times. Still, even if you're standing near the front door when you first step in line, the assembly line process isn't too inefficient, so you won't be left waiting forever.

I had to ask the waitress to change the water cup. Then we got our bill with 18% tax included to the bill. When we asked the waitress on the reason of that when we were only a party of two having dinner before peak time; she said it is a new restaurant policy to include 18ÔøΩ?tax to all bills. We asked the service at the entrance hall about this new policy; she was very surprised and indicated that it should have been an accident. At this point we asked for a manger to explain. The manager indicated that the restaurant is having a bad experience with customers not leaving tips so the serving staff can add the tips to the bill if they think that there is a chance the customer might not leave tips. First; this explanation was insulting. Second; I told the manager that we didn't have the best service experience to leave 18% tips. Her reply was; 18% is for normal service.

We'd never go back.\\nThe decor is super creepy and dirty -- all early 1980's and in very poor condition. Our table was practically tilting over -- the server had to swap tables shortly after we sat down -- and I had to swap chairs because I could feel all the springs in my original chair poking me in the butt (felt like I was sitting on gravel). And it's not like they were crowded -- only 1 other table in the whole place was occupied.\\nSo, the food ... Well, the bread was pretty tasty. But then my friend got a cup of coffee with cream -- just simple coffee -- and we almost walked out. Why? The coffee came with 2 little plastic creamers of half-and-half. When he opened the creamers and poured them into his coffee, they didn't pour. They dropped ... because they were solid! Then the \\"cream\\" curdled in his coffee. It was totally sour/rotten.\\nThey had a $10 lunch buffet with food that looked totally unappetizing. Not a single thing on that food bar looked appealing (all looked old and nasty). We were going to walk out after seeing it, but because we had already purchased the Groupon, we felt obligated to stay and eat. So, we ordered off the menu.\\nEspecially considering that the place was empty, food took a really long time to get to us (just the spoiled cream/coffee, which came out first, took about 15 minutes), and the service was really slow (I had to get up and get the server on several occasions). The chorizo in wine appetizer was very, very tasty -- surprisingly so. And that's the ONLY reason I'd almost give 2 stars (vs. 1 star) to Sunset Cafe. I got roast pork for an entree, which was so-so, but the potatoes on the side were spectacular.  The rice was gross-- tasted like boxed rice-a-roni. My friend got a shrimp dish, which was also so-so but also had really good potatoes on the side (different from my potatoes, but equally tasty).\\nThe combination of the disturbing interior, spoiled cream, and mediocre food made us want to steer clear of this place forever. Because the restaurant was so dingy-looking and the cream was spoiled, I have real concerns about the cleanliness and food preparation standards that go on behind the scenes -- the stuff I COULDN'T see."},{"name":"Ru San's","address":"3365 Piedmont Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Wonderful experience!

I'll probably update this review when I finally get to try their brunch. I've only been there two times: first time for dinner couple years ago, and second time was this past weekend for late lunch. The first time I really did not enjoy dinner at all. I just remember it being tasteless. I ordered some kind of roast. When I came here the past weekend, I was able to get seated right away because nobody wanted to sit inside. There was a 30 minute wait to sit outside. Just overall, I think the service from the host and the server was terrible and forced. So I went inside and told her I wanted a table for two, but I wasn't able to get seated right away since my friend wasn't here. She told me I'll get seated as soon as my friend was here. 5 minutes later my friend arrived and I told her she's here, but she blatantly ignored me and greeted another guest and seated them. She didn't even acknowledge us. There was another host too, but he was just as useless, ugh. But we got seated eventually. Service was slow, but it was understandable because it was super busy. \\n\\nThe meal overall was just okay. We ordered the fried calamari appetizer and I ordered the burger. The burger had such a strong grill flavor that I couldn't even taste anything else besides the bacon. The burger was HUGE though, so the price you pay for is totally worth what you are getting. The fries were also pretty good. I wanted to order the lobster salad roll, but it was $30. I could probably get a cheaper lobster roll at Tony's and still have it taste the same. The calamari was also pretty good.\\n\\nHowever, I feel like I could get the same food at a different restaurant with better prices. It just felt so boring to me. Their menu was boring and they really don't have their own flare. If you ask me, I really can't tell you what's the difference between this restaurant and any other restaurant on Newbury Street.

There are no labels for flavors so you have to guess or ask.  The person behind the counter was just looking at me. So I picked a flavor and asked what that was.  He said: black raspberry with dark and white chocolate. It sounded good, asked if I could try and it was in fact good. So I ordered a scoop in the cup.  He got the cash, didn't give me a receipt and started talking to the other customer.  The place is so cluttered that I kept looking for spoons and napkins on the counter and found them after a while (staff should've provided that when he served the ice cream in the cup).  The trash can was so dirty and filthy on the outside that I almost didn't want to throw my trash in there.  If the place was less cluttered, cleaner and the staff was nicer, they would have tons of customers because the ice cream is really good.  I haven't tried the food, and am not sure if I will since it doesn't look like a clean place. I thought $3.75 for a scoop in which they have a lot to improve was overpriced.

I've tried a few punch bowls and too many drink concoctions to count, but this was one of THE BEST drinks I've ever truly ever had....so much so that I hope to mock the recipe on my upcoming beach trip. At $25, we each received about 4-5 drinks each from the gigantic bowl (there were 3 of us). This was probably my very favorite thing at Lure, and I'd go back just for it.\\n\\nComing in a close second to favorite was the baked peekytoe crab dip. In it, there were huge chunks of fresh crab. The dip was tasty, seasoned well, and not overwhelmingly heavy--very delicious! We ordered many other plates to share: calamari, clam chowder, oysters, mussels. Everything tastes as close to fresh seafood as you will get in Atlanta, and all the dishes were well seasoned and flavorful. My only regret is they ran out of the clams. \\n\\nWe enjoyed perfect, attentive service throughout.

You select a meat (chicken, steak, italian meats, sausage) or veggie option, decide whether you want it on a Piada (an Italian-style thin floury flatbread lightly grilled and brushed with butter and seasoning) or in a salad bowl or pasta bowl. I had chicken which was good and well-seasoned. Then you select a sauce, I had basil pesto which was very tasty and my partner had creamy parmesan which was good too. Then you can pick tons of veggies which I really liked and I thought it differentiated the concept from a place like Chipotle where the options are pretty much lettuce and cheese. There's several cheese options, several lettuce options and tons of veggies (black olives, marinated artichokes, mushrooms, squash, red peppers, etc). You even get to add angel hair pasta.

If I had to describe Agora's in one word.  \\n\\nThe place looks like a strip club from the highway with large pillars and lights strung across the front.  Has a Greek deli up front.  A rooftop patio.  A 2 sided bar that looks out on a empty patio which is spacious but has only 2 tables, and the other side looks in on what they consider a \\"sports bar\\" atmosphere with quite a few tables and TVs.  Unfortunately, they should have stuck with one thing or another.\\n\\nI will only touch on the things that really matter.  First, the setup is terrible as you have to walk through the crowded bar area to get to the bathroom, which is fine if you are sitting in that area but for people eating in the deli or on the patio this can be a real pain.  \\n\\nSecond the service is terrible, but it wasn't entirely the staffs fault.  As I said before it is a 2 sided bar and when we were there for happy hour on Friday the place was packed.  They had 2 bartenders running around both sides of the bar serving drinks and there was no organization.  They seemed to always talk to people on the ends and forgot about those people in the middle.  Countless times I watched people get left without drinks, myself included, while they handled a different patron.  They need to add more bartenders (preferably 2 per side to avoid confusion).  Secondly, have waitresses in the bar area.  I saw 2 girls but they seemed to be working the deli area and occasionally coming back to get drinks from the bar.  If you are going to have tables and TVs you should have a waitstaff.  \\n\\nThird, use the downstairs patio area to take some the crowding off of the upstairs patio and inside bar.  This is a spacious area which would be perfect for some tables for those that want to relax and talk in a quieter area.  \\n\\nDue to its location this place has a ton of potential, but it seems like they are blowing it with mediocre service and lack of direction.

Their phone was either busy or no one would pick up.  Only had 4 more days to use our groupon (for 4 meals, 8 sides, 4 desserts and 4 drinks), so we drove on over. We live right ouside of Upper Arlington; we took 71 to Hudson, and Boujhetto's is .3 miles from Hudson (on Cleveland Ave). We parked on the street.\\n\\n There was a group of people waiting to get their carryout, and we were warmly welcomed, assured they would be with us soon, and to have a seat if we wished.  We walked the very small space and admired the soulfully painted wall, and the jewelry and t-shirts that were for sale.  The jewelry is made by women who have been saved from human trafficking; when you patron this restaurant, you will be helping Rahab's Hideaway, an organization that helps victims of human trafficking.  While we waited, we watched a little bit of t.v. and watched two children come out from the kitchen with plates of yummy food.  They sat quietly and ate chicken, cabbage, green beans, etc; they were delightful children.\\n\\nThis is a family owned and run business.  Some days they cook this, some days they cook that.  Some days they might not have dessert.  Go with an open mind, knowing that you will get good soul food even if they might not have the fried chicken (which is what I wanted when I saw their online menu - the menu is an EXAMPLE).  We were buying our belated Christmas meal for us, my parents, and my sister.  Somehow I was sure that buying for 4 would feed 5, and I was correct.  The young woman behind the counter took the top off of all dishes, showing us what the baked chicken, pulled pork, pork ribs, and brisked looked like.  We were also shown all of the sides.  They didn't have any desserts that day, so we asked if we could have 4 extra sides since the groupon promised 4 desserts.  The young lady went in the back to ask and a woman came out and assured us that we certainly could have 4 extra sides.  We chose one portion of pork ribs, one portion of pulled pork, and 2 portion of brisket.  We chose mac & cheese, sweet potatoes, green beans, mashed potatoes, and baked apples.  Choice of beverages with the groupon were unsweetened tea or regular tea, but we could also have canned soda for a .25 upcharge each.  They were out of Kool-Aid pickles, so I will have to go back and try them another day.\\n\\nThe mac & cheese was fantastic. Strong, REAL cheese flavor. Creamy, not dry.  The mashed sweet potatoes were very sweet.  My husband is not a fan of sweet potatoes, but he loved these!  They have just a tad of marshmallow/butter mix on the top.  This was my favorite side.  The green beans were good, the potatoes (skin-on) were okay but the gravy was very good.  The apples were fine.  The brisket was wonderful - very juicy.  We were disappointed with the pulled pork and the ribs.  The ribs I got were about 70% fat and the meat was very tough.  I'd definitely skip that the next time.  We put some BBQ sauce we had in our frig onto the pulled pork and this made up for the fact that it was a bit dry and tough.  There was the perfect amount of food for 5 hungry adults.  \\n\\nI am looking forward to going back for that Kool-Aid pickle, and to try the chicken.

The sauce was amazing, but there were only about 10 smaller size raviolis, and the market price for the ravs was $22. The spaghetti was nothing special. The antipasti plate of italian meats was okay, but there are better ones to be had in the north end (Antico Forno!). \\n\\nLike others, we purchased a Groupon now, before trekking over in the pouring rain. The restaurant had some tables, but we were the only ones waiting. We waited at least 20 minutes to get a booth table, and this had more to do with them taking forever to clear it off and set it up again, as no one actually left during that time. Once we were finally seated we looked at the menus, and then waited a small eternity for the waiter to finally come over. When he did, he literally just stood there. Finally he asked if we were ready to order our dinner. No, would you like to start with wine, no question about drinks. Once we actually got our order in, the drinks, appetizer, and dinner all came out in the acceptable amount of time. However, they never even brought us bread! I finally had to ask for it so we could eat it with our appetizer, and we finally got it about 10 minutes later. Bread was not toasted, and the olive oil tasted like bertolli (nothing special).  I was really unimpressed with the service, the server just seemed like he could care less. How do you not ask what your patrons are drinking after making them wait 15 minutes just to come over and greet them?  Also, while he did pour the wine at the table, he did not offer for us to taste it first. He just poured and planked the glasses down in front os us. \\n\\nOverall, the food was good, but not worth the money, even with the groupon. If the service had been better, that may have made up for the high cost, but I think there are other better options in the North End where you will get a better portion size, and much better service."},{"name":"Diesel Cafe","address":"257 Elm St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"O how I love this place.

We cooked and cooked and ate and ate, the meat being accompanied by plates of leaves (kkaenip or wild sesame, cabbage), thin slices of mu (radishes like daikon only fatter), and the tteok, or rice cake, which came in sheet form.

Its a true bleu cheese dressing, not those imitation kinds. Actual, delicious, chunks of bleu cheese. \\n\\nTHE ONION RINGS - best $10 I have ever spent. Presentation alone, I was sold. The taste, surpasses it. It was cool to see a different type of onion ring.

It was certainly one of the better Japanese restaurants that I have been to in the area. The owner was not there, and even the young sushi chef told me that I should come back again to try the superior preparations of his boss.OK, now to the review:First I must point out that they offered a number of items that are more like what one finds at truly authentic Japanese restaurants. Their specials included Live Jumbo Orange Clam, Mackeral Battera, grilled chicken wings and hamachi kama (broiled yellowtail collar.)I was told that they sometimes serve chawan mushi, but it was unavailable that night. I started with an uninspiring miso soup, less flavorful than it should have been, but not terrible. The live orange clam was a huge portion, almost a meal in itself. The muscle was quite good, but the rest of it tasted as if they had prepared it earlier in the day and left it cut up in the refrigerator. It was quite good overall, but not superb.The sea urchin was perfect - fresh California sea urchn with a delicious lean flavor and proper texture. It was outstanding.The toro was cheap, and I understood why when I tasted it. Although most toro is frozen, it normally doesn't taste frozen due to flash freezing a very low temperatures and/or high fat content. This toro tasted frozen and the texture and flavor was just fair. You get what you pay for. The grilled chicken wings had some of the flavor that was reminiscent of properly grilled wings from restaurants I have visited in NYC, LA and Tokyo, but they were not crisp, as they should have been.Overall I would give this meal a 7 out of 10, which is still better than most other Japanese restaurants I have been to in the area. I am optimistic that with the owner there, some of these dishes would have been outstanding.If you are the type of person that prefers authenticity in an ethnic restaurant and if you know that Japanese food is not California and bagel rolls, give Sushi Tomi a try."},{"name":"Lure","address":"1106 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"First time visiting my husband and I loved it!

However, the excitement that flourished during our appetizers (Brie Croustillant and Plateau de charcuterie) and our bottle of wine (Joseph Drouhin Vero Pinot Noir) died when we got our entrees.\\n\\nThe quick take on the food: My roasted duck leg confit was too salty and my wife's pork tenderloin tasted like bland mystery meat served over Rice-A-Roni. Oh, and our waiter took forever to tell us the specials, since he couldn't remember them. He would struggle for a moment, then open his book and tell us. We still liked him, though, since a French accent can be mighty charming.\\n\\nBut, it wasn't the sub-par entrees and odd service that ruined the night for me; it was the Phil Collins. Now, before all you rabid Phil Collins fans start accusing me of thinking I'm \\"too cool for Phil,\\" let me state that I'm not against Phil Collins. He's a bad ass drummer that has recorded a handful of songs I really like. But, this isn't about the intrinsic worth of Phil Collins. This is about how Phil Collins is the reason I will never go back to Atmosphere.\\n\\nSure, the chances of my wife and I going back were already slim, but there WAS still a chance. The place is cozy and even romantic, so it wasn't completely out of the question. We could have gone back and stuck to appetizers and wine. But, Mr. Phil Collins fucked it all up. Or, should I say, the management at Atmosphere fucked it all up with their choice of music.\\n\\nI was already suspicious of the music selection when, halfway through our entrees, \\"Against All Odds\\" started playing. While it was bad enough to go from Sade to a Muzak version of Sade, hearing \\"Against All Odds\\" let me know everything I needed to know about Atmosphere Bistro. What it told me was that attention to detail is not a high priority. How else can you explain a cozy French bistro, housed in a mid-50s cottage, not ensuring the music added to the ambiance? Is it that hard to have some romantic French music playing instead of a pint-sized Brit belting out a song about divorce?!? I'm surprised they didn't follow it up with Wham's \\"Careless Whisper.\\"\\n\\nOh well. Next week we'll go out again and hopefully have better results.

I'm actually rating it 4.5, not 5 b/c of how crowded it felt.\\n\\nWe went there with friends last night and ordered several dishes to share. They started us off with pappadom, which was South Indian, so don't expect the typical N. Indian kind. It's served with two dipping sauces: the traditional cilantro and tamarind chutneys. But I have to tell you. I normally don't like cilantro chutney, but this one was very good.\\n\\nThe food came out within about 15 minutes. We ordered Chettinad Chicken, Chili Chicken, Alleppey Fish Curry (spelled incorrectly on their menu as \\"Alephy Fish Curry\\"), and Chicken Noodles. We said \\"medium spicy\\" for all of them, since we are Indian and can handle a good amount of heat. Unfortunately, the Chettinad Chicken was way too hot for us, but the Chili Chicken was just at the max level of heat that we could handle.  I can't comment on the Fish Curry b/c I didn't taste it, but my hubby did say it was really good. The Chicken Noodles didn't seem that spicy at all, but was very yummy. Our kids loved it.\\n\\nI have to comment on the flavors here... wow. Even though the Chettinad Chicken was too spicy, it had an amazing smoky flavor that was reminiscent of the traditional, old-fashioned wood-burning cooking in India. I don't know how they did it, but it tasted just like it was made over in India, right off the stove.\\n\\nOut of all the curry dishes, we loved the Chili Chicken the most. We ordered a garlic naan (served as 1/2 a naan), and butter naan, and both were good. We should have ordered one more half, but since there was white basmati rice served with all the curries, we made do.\\n\\nHubby and friend had two 22 oz. Taj Mahal beers, which they said was great - just like in India. I ordered a regular sweetened iced-tea with lemon, and it was better than most restaurants - I'm pretty sure it was fresh brewed, and not watered down like other places. I ordered a \\"Mango-Mango\\" for my daughter; it's basically a thick mango slushy, and it was quite refreshing.\\n\\nDecor: Outside, it doesn't look like much, and parking is tight although there are spaces all around the building in a private lot. Inside, it's beautifully laid out, with authentic decor. The only complaint I have is that the tables and chairs are really packed in there. It would be nice if they had a little more room to space things out a bit. \\n\\nWhen we were there, there was only one table free, and it was reserved for a large party. Other than that, the place was packed. We spent about 2 hours there, and as each minute passed, more and more people came and went. When we left, there was a wait in the foyer. Moreover, you know an Indian restaurant is good when its frequented by Indians (which it was!)\\n\\nAll in all, we truly loved this place even though it's a 40-minute drive for us. We'll definitely be going there again. Head on out for a truly authentic meal, with pretty good service.\\n\\nUPDATE: My hubby went there two weeks later with his co-workers for the lunch buffet, and he said the food was awful. They went around 2 pm, and first of all, the food was cold, secondly, he said it was mostly North Indian dishes. It doesn't matter what time a buffet is served, you should never, ever, ever serve it cold. So that gets a huge thumbs down from us.

They offer lots of vegetarian and vegan options which is always great to see.  The food is fresh and packed with flavor.  The min-lobster roll app was amazing, definitely the best I've ever had.  Expensive?  Sure but oh so worth it.  My wife had the mushroom risotto and although I liked it, she didn't because it was overly laced with the truffle oil.  I didn't mind it but I must admit that it was really mushroomy because of the excess amount of truffle oil.  There's probably a better balance that they could find but I didn't see it as a huge demerit.  The entree I had was the hoisin tuna and that was very good.  Others at the table had everything from the skirt steak that they all raved about to the raviolis.  It should be noted that if you don't like certain ingredients, say peas, ask your waiter what each dish comes with because my wife's dish came with tons of peas on top of it even though the menu description says nothing about peas.  This restaurant is in a great location too, right in front of the aquarium and conveniently located except for the fact that the nearest parking garage screws you.  $36!

And, did he!  Two HUGE (free) dessert trays were brought out to the table with 3 or 4 different desserts to sample.  It was so kind of them.  And the waitress was exceptional, too -- handling a large party with grace and she was an expert at keeping the wine and water glasses full without being obtrusive.\\n\\nRe: the food -- VERY good; best tapas I've had in the area (and I've been to Dali, Taberna de Haro, Tapeo, etc.)  Try the sizzling shrimp with garlic and chili peppers, portobellos in sherry cream sauce, escargot, chicken and ham croquettes, and brie with apple and raisin chutney.  Those were all amazing and we ordered seconds on most everything.\\n\\nThe other amazing part was the price....$27.50 per person and that included 2 or 3 dishes per person and two bottles of wine for a group of 9.  We had a $10 off coupon and didn't use it because the price was so reasonable.\\n\\nYes, it's a pain to get out to the restaurant but totally worth it (and the valet parking is a nice touch at $7 plus tip).

I wanted to have the whole trout but it was out of stock;  it was replaced by a whole baked red snapper on sauteed spinach with a side salad.  Fish served whole, for me, needs to have two things.  The skin needs to have a bit of crackle to it (as if broiled) and the meat should be steamy, moist but cling to bone.  Cardone's did it all correctly.\\nTogether we shared the berries and gelato dessert (gelato was green tea flavored and served with red raspberries) - excellent.  Our wines were a cab/merlot blend and pinot grigio - house and good.\\nThe server had a nice sense of humor and was very good about checking on our progress, not pushy, but always available in such a small restaurant.

Both dishes were delicious - the pork belly had that carmelized crust you hope for, with a delicious topping made up of a hearty beef gravy that clung to our forks while being accentuated with an ample bed of cous-cous.  The scallops were sitting on a chorizo pate that was fork-tender and delicously prepared to a nice, medium consistency.  Simply delightful.\\n\\nThen the owner put the hammer down - he recommended his Pecan Bourbon-glazed Bread Pudding.  We decided on one order with two forks, and found it to be out of this world.  Three large bread pieces were smothered in a bourbon glaze that was a perfect complement to the crustiness surrounding each piece of bread - this dish rivaled anything we've had the pleasure to enjoy at Commander's Palace, Brennan's, or any other restaurant in New Orleans.

So what is up IKEA, the big new flagship store built behind the one you just put a bulldozer to not too long ago. Now when you come with your car, you have to go through a weird paved path that is like a maze before you get to the building... ok.. who designed this? And you have to see the sorry souls of people fighting for their rights.. telling you not to shop here.... something has got to change.. I don't need to be reminded of people down on their luck while I come and shop to my heart's content?\\n\\nAside from the picketing problem once you come here, it's another endless maze of furniture, and anything else they can sell you to make your house IKEA-like. What are you looking for.. they may have? You thinking of re-furnishing your home... maybe a bed room, living room, kitchen, or washroom, you may think of doing it all when you are done with just walking around the top portion. IKEA's mad catalogue of goods has increased over the years... to not just furniture, but also the finer things, like cross-selling appliances for your kitchen, changing out the floors.. they got you covered, need countertops in some funky stone and color (yup), need a toilet to crap in (yup).. need some cheap Swedish toys to entertain your kids (yup).... need light bulbs on the cheap (yup).... what about kitchen ware like pots, pans, knives, forks (yup).... plants (yeah.. greenery too). I'm just waiting till they serve up prescription drugs now!\\n\\nNow.. there's a few problems with this IKEA to this day... so you came here with someone who actually wants to shop.. your hungry... oh... this place has cheap food.. wrong!! There is no food service here, they have the amenities.. but those people you saw outside picketing.. yeah.. they use to work at these areas. No cheap dogs, no $2 breakfast.. nothing... just empty barren areas of what used to be until they get this labour deal settled... which has already taken over a year. Don't expect your cheap hot dogs now!\\n\\nBought something from here... and don't like it.. well you know.. your driving out to Coquitlam to return things cause even the customer service section is not operating... wtf.

Only to say that they would take a to go order but not serve us because they had orders still in and wouldn't be able to serve us in the 30 minutes left before they were to close at the posted 9:30.  After we waited to get seated.  Seriously, does it take 30 minutes to make some Sushi rolls for two people?  There were 8 people in the whole place and everyone had food and was already eating so that was a lie.   They just didn't want to serve anyone or clean up after them and actually close the place at 9:30.  I don't know who their manager is or where they were but that is not how you run a restaurant or a business.  Turning away paying customers out of sheer laziness.

I wouldn't have known that it was an all-kosher restaurant except for the Orthodox mom and her son who came in right ahead of us.  \\n\\nI have to admit, I was a bit taken aback by the prices.  $6.99 for half a grilled chicken pita, $11.99 for a whole one, wow.  Prices seemed to be pretty much the same for the various sandwiches, except for the falafel, which is a bit cheaper.  Had I seen the news articles on the walls about the falafel beforehand, I would have tried it, but I went with the chicken.  Boyfriend got a gyro, and we split a small order of spicy fries.  (Small order, $2.99.  Large order a staggering $6.99.)\\n\\nThe food came out pretty quickly.  The chicken was spiced very well, the pitas were soft and chewy, and the hummus and spicy sauce were both just excellent.  (As a sidenote, the spicy sauce was obviously a spicy sauce, but for those of you complaining of burning tongues, you've clearly never had Peruvian Aji.  Man up.)  I also appreciated the wide variety of veggie salads you can use to customize your sandwich (Jerusalem salad, yum).  Boyfriend was pleased to see that their gyros are hand-made, the traditional way, meat stacked on meat on a spit instead of a large processed lamb hunk.  \\n\\nBecause it's kosher, they don't serve tzatziki with the sandwiches (no milk and meat), but the hummus more than makes up for it, and the boyfriend, a traditionalist, said it was still awesome.  The spicy fries were a pretty big order (you do not need a large), and more seasoned than spicy, but hot and fresh enough that they were obviously cooked to order.\\n\\nAll in all, a great place to stop in as long as you have a few extra bucks lying around.  The only reason it's not a five-star is because their prices are surprisingly high for (even really good) fast food."},{"name":"Centro Mexican Kitchen","address":"950 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"I'm here with my daughter ... drinking MOJITOS!

I was salivating, especially after such great experiences at Milano (their bugolgi burger!), Sobban, and Hankook - I was ready for more. \\n\\nSsam Burger is located in a fairly nondescript retail strip called 'Winding Way Shops' off Defoors Ferry, in between a cleaners and J's Cigars. Honestly, if we hadn't been looking for Ssam's, I doubt I would've noticed it at all at this location. The restaurant has been open for about two weeks now, and it seems as if they're still working out a few hiccups.\\n\\nWe arrived yesterday, for a pretty early lunch - around 11:45 (they open at 11), we were the only customers at this point. The cashier was friendly, he greeted us as we walked and gave us time to look over the menu; when we were ready to order, he had a little bit of trouble working the register, so it took a minute as someone from the back came over to help. In addition to our entrees, I also ordered two bubble teas - with tapioca ($3.50); which another staff member got started on - turns out she told the cashier to give us a discount on it, because it was her first time making it and she was worried about how it would turn out. After we tried it, she even came over to ask if we thought the boba was overcooked - it wasn't; a little chewy (which is how I prefer it) but I've definitely have had worse elsewhere. They have a nice selection of milk teas and clear teas, and a choice of aloe vera or coffee jelly, instead of tapioca for topping choices. \\n\\nAnyway - back to the food! The BF chose the 'seoul burger' and I selected the 'aloha burger' (bacon! pineapple! - how could I say no to that?) with a side of sesame sweet potato fries. I quite enjoyed both burgers, they were flavorful, tender, and quite hearty. They did cook both burgers to medium rare (which again is how I prefer it), so if you prefer well-done, make sure to let them know. The sweet potato fries, were more diced potatoes than fries, but tasty nonetheless - though to echo Jang C's sentiments they seemed a bit undercooked. I preferred the lotus chips, so. good, I could probably eat an entire bag. \\n\\nOverall, I think Ssam is off to a good start, the service is excellent and I would really love to try their other menu options - they all sound delicious."},{"name":"Cambridge Brewing Company","address":"1 Kendall Sq, Bldg 100","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"CBC, tucked away in Kendall Sq. is a local gem.

They have a live dance show on Friday and Saturday so I imagine it would be busy during peak dining hours on those days.\\n\\nI do regret not checking out the hot food bar and salad bar as was too focused on the swords of meat (will need to review the bar on a future visit of this reataurant as heard there was fish at the bar).\\n\\nDuring the time we went, the ratio of sword servers to tables was really good and we did not have to wait long at all between servers.  The service was extremely friendly and quick during the time we were there.\\n\\nThe quality of meat served was not bad.  There were definitely some cuts of meat which were not as tender as others (but I would say this relates more to the cut of meat).   For example, my favorite Brazilian restaurant in Ontario serves garlic marbled in with rib-eye (totally mouth melting goodness).  I could just have them park the sword at the table all night.\\n\\n All of the meats at Rio's were well seasoned, in some selections you could chose the levels of how you enjoy your beef cooked (rare to siding more on medium).  The chicken was really good and the ribs (both beef and pork) were really good as well.  \\n\\nYou definitely want to bring your appetite in order to get your moneys work on this dining experience. There is also 3 free assigned parking spots assigned to the restaurant in the building parkade (otherwise it's only $2).\\n\\nDessert was on a separate menu and were not part of the buffet (should you even leave room for dessert).\\n\\nOverall, I would consider going back.

Hale Pele is so good, I would call it a destination tiki bar for tiki lovers.  The short of it: It's absolutely AMAZING in every way.  For more details, read below:\\n\\nDRINKS: A++\\nHale Pele offers everything you could want.  50 cocktail recipes including classics, modern recipes, and house recipes.  They are mixed with expert accuracy and beautiful presentation ( check out the flaming Krakatoa ).  They also have an assortment of nearly 400 runs to sample.  Of course, they have a club for those who dare to tackle all 50 cocktails and all 400 rums.  Sounds fun.\\n\\nDECOR: A++\\nAs soon as you walk in, you're hit by the immense care and craft put into Hale Pele.  Lagoon-lighting and a fake bridge way adorns the front, amazing Tiki Totems flank the bar and entry, beautiful exotica lighting splashes the walls, while fun and kitch lamps of every design illuminate the space. No stone un-turn\\ned, every inch is designed with the goal of creating a fantasy space to escape into.\\n\\nAMBIANCE / CLIENTELE: A+\\nAs any good Tiki bar does, music in Hale Pele is true to form, exotica and neo-tiki bands.  Audio experience helps tie the visual experience together.  The bar has been open for a little while, and the customers and servers are all great (Justin, you're awesome).  People seem to have a great time there and appreciate the environment.\\n\\nFOOD: tbd\\nDidn't get a chance to have the food yet, I'm sure it's great but, can't judge it personally.\\n\\nBONUS:\\nThis place hits all my bonus spots.  There is a special room in the back called the Chieftan's Hut, seats a fairly large group, great place to have a get-together for a special occasion.  Ordering a volcano bowl sets off a special eruption of steam & fog, along with sound effects and light show.  Besides that, there is also a lightning storm that happens every hour or so.  The two drink-clubs are a great bonus as well.\\n\\nFolks, this is as good as it gets, Hale Pele is a major win for the tiki community.  You will not be disappointed."},{"name":"Peaceful Restaurant","address":"43 E 5th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Had food delivered from there twice. 5 and 6 dishes.

Service was great.\\n\\nPatatas bravas- these were totally heavenly. I thought the portion was a bit too big (aren't tapas supposed to be small) this was a big ol' bowl of potatos but the garlic mayonnaise-y thing drizzled on it was totally delicious.\\n\\nTortilla espa√±ola- This was ok. I guess I was just expecting something a little more exciting but it was a triangle cut piece of potato/onion egg thing- more like a quiche then an omlette. \\n\\nEmpanadillas de queso de cabra (Herbed goat cheese empanadas served on a roasted red pepper relish )- This was so good, the goat cheese was kind of melty and went well with the pepper.\\n\\nBrie a la plancha Grilled imported Brie cheese with a homemade savory apple and raisin chutney and warm baguette - I love this (I didn't realize Brie was used in Spanish cooking) the baguette was a little small (I had left over brie) but the sweet chutney went so well with the rich creamy brie.\\n\\nI had a sip of my friend's Sangria- unfortunately I couldn't order it was I wasn't 21 but it really is insanely amazing.\\n\\nFinally dessert- I was debating between the Crepe Helado and the Tarta de Chocolate . I made a huge mistake. I got the chocolate flourless thing and my friend got the Crepe. Well after one bite of mine and one bite of his I really wanted to see if I could order his and send mine back but I'm kind of a coward. Mine was supposed to have a raspberry glaze but couldn't taste that flavor at all- the dessert was so dense but bitter- kind of like bitter chocolate fudge or something. His on the other hand was \\"Cookie ice cream rolled in a thin crepe and smothered in a\\nchocolate and amaretto sauce with toasted almonds\\" it was the best dessert I've tasted at a restaurant in Boston. The ice cream tasted homemade or something, the crepe was an amazing texture and the cookie bits were out of this world. With the amaretto/almond sauce I wanted to eat all of his off his plate.

Anderson Lane","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I had planned to meet a vegetarian friend for dinner, and was in a calorie deficit for the week, so I said I really wanted a cheeseburger, fries, and a shake, and since he lives in south austin, why not Hopdoddy? Even though I hate the line, and the hipsters, and the oversized portions, it was TIME. My friend suggested we meet at Elevation instead, and curiously across Anderson Lane up north across from the other Hopdoddy location. My curiosity was piqued and I hopped on my motorcycle, headed for Northcross Mall.\\n\\nIf Yelp had the capabilities, I would make a Venn diagram to compare and contrast Hopdoddy and Elevation, but I can't, so here's a list:\\n\\n-Calories are displayed on the menu. I LOVE this, and wondered aloud in line how Hopdoddy's menu would compare.\\n-Elevation Burger and Kid's Burger sizes. Even though I was ravenous, I chose the Kid's, with added cheddar, caramelized onion, and bacon. One thing I didn't realise upon ordering is, you need to ask for EVERYTHING you want, and I foolishly omitted lettuce, tomato, pickle, etc. Next time. \\n- With tasty fries and a vanilla-strawberry-blueberry shake (yes, REAL fruit), the Kid's burger was enough for me; I think the Elevation (double patty) would have been overkill.\\n-That shake again: what I like to now refer to as the \\"700 Calorie Milkshake.\\" It was pretty good. I felt better about it having real fruit in it. I think it's going to give the \\"$5 Milkshake\\" across the street at the Alamo a run for it's money (and antioxidant content).\\n- Dinner for 3 adults was $36, for fries fried in olive oil and organic grass-fed beef.... I think that's what I would have paid alone at Hopdoddy.  Okay, maybe Hopdoddy is bigger portions, but guess what, my modest meal here was about 1400 calories, and I walked out feeling satisfied, but NOT like a fatass, which is how I always feel after leaving H'dy.\\n- The restaurant was not loud or overcrowded, and we were able to mill around after our meal and talk for a while before departing. We did not wait to order or be seated, either. I don't know about you, but life is too short to be waiting around with all the cool kids. Didn't we get over that in high school?\\n-Vegheads: my friend had a veggie burger (one of two options) but my burger was so tasty I didn't try to mooch off his, so I can't tell you how it was.\\n\\nIn summary, this brings Elevation to five stars!"},{"name":"Felipe's Taqueria","address":"83 Mt Auburn St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Cheapest food in Harvard Square, and therefore very popular with the college crowd.

However, my most recent visit prompted me to finally review Haiku and give some love to server Chris in particular.  There is no need to get into the specifics as all of us have dealt with the good, bad and ugly of the service industry.  Simply put, Chris is the kind of server that makes your good evening even better and helps you realize how refreshing a night out can be.  He is simply fantastic at his job.

And sometimes you can gauge the way the joint is doing by the \\"oohs\\" and \\"ahhs\\" of your fellow diners. And there were many of them, to be sure.\\n\\nI highly recommend everything I ordered. The goat cheese and arugula salad was great, and the trout almandine was even better than that. For desert I had the apple tart, which was warm and topped with fresh, delicate cinnamon ice cream. Equally yummy. If you like fish, definitely get the trout as it is a regular menu item.\\n\\nOne of my co-diners had the pork with mushroom ravioli. Mind you, I think of eating ravioli in the same way I do a root canal - and this dish was so good I wanted to steal the plate and scurry away to a private room so I could snarf it myself. This also is a regular menu item so consider that when you go along with the trout. The beet salad my mother got - a fave of some of my pals on Yelp - was also very, very good. Restaurants can absolutely murder a beet dish sometimes, but this was delicate and well executed.\\n\\nStaying true to its name, too, was the atmosphere of this place - quiet, upscale and yet decidedly unpretentious.

And they certainly pack a punch, so when you walk out of there you might think, weighing the bang-for-buck, that maybe they weren't so expensive after all. Food, from a tiny tiny kitchen, is vastly improved, although portions of main courses are more tapas sized. Don't eat here if you're hungry (this is a drinking establishment!). If you are hungry, try the yakisoba with kimchee. Its a decent portion for a mere $6."},{"name":"Coming Home Cafe","address":"753 6th Street","city":"New Westminster","stars":"4","text":"Finally made it up to the Coming Home Cafe a few weeks ago and so glad. Upon our arrival, there was a gaggle of our friends enjoying morning coffee on the patio. It was a great draw to see friendly faces welcoming us to come in and join them.\\nWe chose to sit indoors as the patio was a bit warm with the heat wave and inside was air conditioned! Avery quaint, eclectic room that felt like we had been invited into a kitchen party with a bunch of friendly people.\\nWe had the benny's and breakfast all round. Food was cooked to order, served quickly, portions were decent, and the food tasted great! We were all very happy with our all day breakfasts...\\nThe guys working the room were friendly and engaging.

You could spend hours here without feeling like you have to leave.\\n\\nBut that comes at a price: the bathrooms can get really (I mean really) dirty. If you're sensitive to that but also drink a lot of coffee, that could put you in a dilemma. The other drawback is that the WiFi is not free after the first 45 minutes. Then it gets to ~$3/hour or ~$8/day. If you come here often, it's not as expensive as there is a subscription plan with a discount. Understandable, but not always ideal. \\n\\nI've come here several times while in the area, and would give an average of 3 stars.

The food and drinks have been excellent both times (they are not the best with gluten free knowledge though). The atmosphere is pretty loud, but it's energetic and lively. I'm a big fan of the organic margarita and the tacos pastor. They are also one of the few places in central Florida to offer ground beef tacos. Excellent ground beef, seasoned well and topped with the right amount of toppings. The chips and salsa are tasty--great quality and fresh! This will definitely be our regular spot for Tex-Mex and Mexican!"},{"name":"Olive & June","address":"3411 Glenview Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I love the backspace and appreciate parkside's happy hour, so I remember looking forward to the opening of O&J. I've been here twice, once for their happy hour and once for their Mezzo Monday. Loved their sangria and meatballs at the happy hour at the time, and the prices are definitely more affordable then. The decor and aesthetic atmosphere is great. \\n\\nMy second visit for Mezzo Monday could have been improved. We arrived and sat 10 minutes before their happy hour ended and no waitress approached us or was even near enough to be flagged down to take advantage of the few minutes of HH prices. Only after 6:30 did she suddenly appear, informing us that ends after 6:30. Even an establishment like Uchi has seated me before with 5 minutes left in happy hour and taken my order, and details in timing like that can make a big difference to customers.\\n\\nWhat I did appreciate was a chef's politeness and offer to swing over a nearby table to accommodate our growing party, which grew from 3 to 5. He was extremely polite. I personally think that the friendliness of a waitress makes a big impression on a guest and frankly, I think that would have made my experience a lot better. \\n\\nThe food was great. We tried almost all the piccolo piati and favorites were the scallops--fresh and delicious, sold out by the time we wanted another dish, and the house bresaola. Crostini was good, the individual bites were good, the cocktails were delicious.\\n\\nI would have loved if their dishes were a tad bigger--if you come here on a date, don't come with the intention of skimping if you want to be satisfied. If you come here in a group, order a lot of food to receive better service. Because of the food, I would love to return, but purely the patio service on a discounted night makes me a little hesitant to return. I'm sure a dining experience outside of happy hour would be more promising."},{"name":"Caffe Paradiso","address":"255 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Awesome cafe/bar that makes you feel like you're in Europe. Fantastic espresso, good selection of grappas and other spirits, excellent staff. The best place to watch a soccer game in Boston.\\n\\nWell, I've been kind of overhyping this place.

But they do deserve that star.\\n\\nThe Positive:\\n\\nThe staff at Library Square Public House are fantastic. I have a sneaky suspicion it's the reason I also give this place a very bad review. But if you want top notch friendly staff who treat you like a friend of their's, this is the place.\\n\\nThe Negative:\\n\\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$...I think you get the point. I went on 90's night. The most positively reviewed night. First off, the DJ didn't really focus on popular 90's music. That was strange. But the biggest reason this place is a let-down is $12 cover and $3 coat check. After that, I just don't feel like tipping. Tipping coat check staff in the first place is like giving a tip to someone sitting on the couch and doing nothing. Sure it's tough looking for those jacket's and I'm sure you face some unsavoury folk. BUT your job can be done by anyone who hasn't even a grade 3 education (no offence to children in grade 3). So I won't tip you because you have done nothing but look pretty and carry a snotty attitude. Actually that was one girl there. The other one was extremely friendly. Sooo not all coat check girls are like that.\\n\\nSo after spending a lot of money just to get in (I didn't even mention the pretentious and unnecessary line-up because it was empty inside), I was hoping the night would be amazing. It was not. In fact it was a huge disappointment. My friends were hilarious. But the bar is typical, drinks normal and there was nothing impressive about the atmosphere. The guy/girl ratio was quite off and this was very much a \\"guys\\" bar. A lot of testosterone floating around. \\n\\nAll-in-all I won't be back here. I felt ripped off for a below average bar. You pay for pretension and a lack of entertainment.\\n\\nNote: Normally I write funny. But this place just had nothing funny to write about. There was a foosball table which was awesome!

Interesting Walnut Creek products, fresh baked bread, and home-grown popcorn were among some of the things we enjoyed browsing. We picked up some bread, and they were giving away samples of the freshly popped corn. Delicious! At the deli counter, the lady we spoke with was like talking with an old friend, even though we just met. She answered our questions about products and let us sample anything so we could make good decisions on what to buy. We also purchased their signature sub which I would highly recommend!

They screwed up my friend's $3 bagel, and it came a very long time after the rest of the food.  she ordered a toasted everything, they brought her a plain, and then took another 20 minutes to bring back the bagel she ordered, but only after i asked the waittress about it, and not until she was already 3/4 of the way done with her food.  \\n\\nWe were sitting outside and it was a bit chilly and windy, so i asked for my side of toast (which was $4) to be buttered in the kitchen while the toast was still hot.  Didn't happen.  It came out dry and with no side butter, only jam.  I sent it back, they buttered it cold like they were frosting a cake and didn't warm it up as i had asked.  So no melted butter for me, plus I had to scrape off huge blobs of butter from it.  why is that so hard for a professional sous chef to butter a piece of toast?   Is this how you would butter your own toast at home? With huge blobs of butter floating on cold toast?  And you're charging me more than a whole loaf of bread costs for two slices of toast that you can't even serve right?\\n\\nWe were there for almost an hour and a half between waiting for service, waiting for coffee, waiting for food, waiting for them to fix their mistakes, then waiting for the waitress to bring the check, which took another 15 minutes after we asked for it and then had to remind her while she was doing something else that she still hadn't brought the check.  She was nice enough, but slow as hell and they couldn't get anything right.  \\n\\nThey also served my double espresso in a full sized coffee cup and took their sweet time with that, so that wasn't hot when i got it either.  and I ordered my friend a mocha and that tasted like crap.  Not sure how they screwed that up.  I suspect she didn't even know how to make a latte, and made a mocha americano, which was watery and gross.  \\n\\nThe whole thing was just terrible and had we paid full price it easily would have been a $50 breakfast.  unreal.  for what?  a server that ignores you, food that doesn't come, and when it does it's wrong, then you have to hound the waitress about things because she's under the impression that the kitchen will just make it right and bring it out whenever and she isn't involved.\\n\\nThis is the prototypical place that drive me nuts about Boston.  The waitresses and the foodservice do not live up to the prices these places charge.  If I'm being asked to pay $50 for breakfast for two, it better be FLAWLESS.  As in- PERFECT.  This wasn't even competent.\\n\\nSo unless your only priority is to look cool and eat on Newbury st, I suggest passing over this place.\\n\\nAnd although I didn't order it, I saw this on the menu: A $10 basic mimosa is indefensible.  A $13 jazzed up mimosa is simply unbelievable."},{"name":"Full English","address":"2000 Southern Oaks Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Pretty neat place and something you'd expect from Austin being that this is supposed to be close to food you'd get in Britain. The atmosphere here is where the Austin part comes in with odd art on the walls and set up in a corner store. I didn't expect a place like this to be where it is. I walked in to meet friends who chose one of the couches and a full tea setup complete with teapot and anything you'd need to add into your cuppa. The place is a bit tight with the waiters having to twist and turn, sometimes step over things to get to your table. They do it fast though and don't miss a beat. A lot of the art looks old and it's falling apart with dust sitting on it. They could all use a good dusting. The couches looked old and warn, dirty too. The waiters vary from Australian accents to English and one I noticed sounded like she had a fake accent or in the middle of losing her accent. The flavored coffee needs some help. You'd probably do better getting tea. Ask for a Full English for the experience. It's not bad food. \\n\\nOverall it's a different yet fun experience. It can definitely turn into a group's regular hangout on a Saturday morning to catch up or a single person's regular place on any given day.

Go Eat There!\\n\\nDan's Hamburgers reminds me that there are really two 'tiers' when it comes to burgers.  One is the 'gourmet burger' tier, one that is defined by exotic meats (elk, boar, cougar, California condor) and exotic add-ons (brioche buns, arugula, snake venom, unicorn tears).  The other is the 'damn good backyard burger', which is a simpler thing that seeks to impress with little more than a properly done patty, a plain bun, and more 'common joe' toppings.\\n\\nA place like Hopdoddy's is an example of the former.  Dan's should be the avatar of the latter.  What I term as juicy, other less-enlightened people would call 'greasy as hell'.  Ah, but it's so good.  The service is friendly, the dining area pleasantly divey, and the fries are delish.\\n\\nOne tip: you get to choose from three sizes of burger here - small, medium, and large.  The cashier I spoke with explained that's a 3oz, 4oz, and 6oz patty, respectively.  As a point of reference, a McDee's Quarter Pounder, would thus be a 'medium'.

Instead of choosing a hot or cold side I went with the fried green tomatoes, which are offered as an appetizer. This was my only misstep.\\n\\nThe sandwich was outstanding; while a few different sauces are offered at the table you really don't need them. The meat was moist and full of flavor and the Texas toast offered the perfect counterpoint of buttery crunch. I want one right now.\\n\\nThe tomatoes were disappointing; I probably shouldn't have ordered them in November but I'm a sucker for fried green tomatoes. The tomatoes themselves were clearly out of season and the breading was too heavy and uninspired.

We went in for lunch with the work lunch group last Friday, and found new tables. chairs, and a fresh paint job, apparently the space has been refreshed.  We sat down and it was just our table, they seated and greeted us, and gave us a chance to look over the menu.  The menu is big, but as has become my MO, I ordered a cheese enchilada, beef hard taco, and a pollo empanda.  No beans and rice.  We all stuck with water for the drinks.  A few minutes later and ever table was taken for the Friday lunch rush.  Service was OK, not great, they seemed to have trouble keeping our waters filled up.\\n\\nHomemade chips and salsa are brought out before you eat.  The chips we had were not fantastic, they seemed a bit under cooked.  Not terrible, but not great, so say 3 stars.  The homemade salsa is good, but it thicker and has more of a tomato sauce consistency that isn't my favorite.  The flavor was great though, so maybe I have hang ups on that.\\n\\nOur meals came out, and I would rate all three of the things on my combo as excellent, very good, I would round up to 5 stars.  Taqueria La Fuente brings out the obligatory red and green salsas in a dispenser bottle, both of which are tasty, better than the chip salsa, IMHO.  I cleaned my plate.  Also, the amount of food was perfect for me for lunch, and at $7, is quite the bargain for a sit down place.\\n\\nMost of the food is really good here, 5 stars, the service may be a bit in attentive, I would have to go a few more times to make a final judgement there.  The chips and salsa are good, somewhere between 3 and 4 stars, but this is not a major issue thing.  I have not tried the drinks, so you are on your own there, unlikely I will drink there given I am most likely to go for lunch while at work.

I had forgotten about it in my quest to find great restaurants in midtown. Then I got the word about the special on Tues/Wed. nights. So we planned a Tuesday night date night and headed over with no reservation. The moment we walked in I remember how charming and quaint this little house is. It reminded me of the old Einstein's when it use to be a one house charmer until it became every remodeled modern cookie cutter. But I digress and will write my Einstein's review later. Without a reservation we were promptly seated. Shirley was our waitress and I highly recommend her. She was well versed in the menu and specials. Very attentive and always checked in after we had a few bites to make sure everything was to our liking. And was it ever. Bob chose the Price fix menu and I ordered off the regular dinner menu. I also ordered a bottle of the Louis Latour Chardonnay it runs $30 a bottle and so good. If you want to spend more on wine they also have an $80 Latour. 1st course Bob had the Mesculin salad I (of course) had Escargot. The bread they served was fresh made and recently baked so you know I tore it up and dunked it into the sweet butter garlic sauce left over from the snails. 2nd course Bob had the mussels in a very light based cream sauce another good destination for the bread. I only had one mussel because of my love for them and if I have more than that I break out into hives. My dinner choice was the seared scallops served on fresh made mushroom ravioli in a creamy Parmesan and corn sauce drizzled in truffle oil. With the last piece of bread I sop up as much of this sauce from my cleaned plate. As the plates leave I secretly reach under the table and undo the button on my pants. 3rd course Creme burlee. You know I make this homemade so this will be harshly judged. Beautiful carmel brown glass like crust. It makes the cracking sound as my spoon slides underneath to the creamy silk like substance. I place the spoon in my mouth and success. Just like I make it. I am a happy boy. 5 stars earned.

I had a very large cobb salad, one of the lunch entree salads ($14.99). It was certainly substantial enough for its price and definitely filled with large bits of chicken (what seemed like an entire chicken breast) and big pieces of egg and guacamole. However, the dressing, which was already mixed in with the salad, was lacking. On the menu it was described as a blue cheese dressing but I did not detect any chunks of blue cheese in the salad at all and it did not even really taste like blue cheese. There was really no hint of cheese in it. Also, I always look forward to large pieces of cheese in a cobb salad but on this salad, while there was a very scant amount of shredded american cheese on the top, there was no other cheese evident in the salad at all. So if you love cheese like I do, I would not suggest this cobb salad. Also sampled some of the macaroni and cheese. While this was quite rich and decadent I found that the macaroni was a bit too al dente for my liking and, like the salad, the cheese flavor seemed to be a bit lacking. This is macaroni and CHEESE. It should taste like cheese. The heaviness and creaminess was indeed comforting and I can see how this can be acclaimed as a good comfort food, but, IMO, it should also be cheesy and this was not. \\n\\nI would give Stephanie's another try before completely writing it off, but I do not feel it is a good place for cheese lovers, based on my limited experience with these two dishes."},{"name":"Yek O Yek","address":"3046 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Jumping on the \\"wow the owner is nice here\\" bandwagon.

I had read somewhere that they were the new coffee roasters in town and I was excited that, perhaps, there might be a place closer to my home than Brioso (downtown) to get a really good coffee/coffee drink.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, there were two-three people in front of us in line. We proceeded to what appeared to be the end of the line near the dessert case. Our plan was to walk further down and try le Chocoholique, however, after waiting five or so minutes to order, I was tempted to try the baklava with our coffee. I surveyed the prices on the menu board and decided at four dollars and some change, that I would \\"splurge\\" and get the \\"large\\" cappuccino. My beau chose the macchiato (also large). I chose the cappuccino and to drink our coffee in the shop to see their presentation and to experience the mood of this new place of business.\\n\\nWhen we finally ordered, the female \\"barista\\" showed us the size of the ceramic cups for our drinks (the large) but did not seem to indicate whether we would think that was small or large - just that we might not be aware they were that size. Personally, I considered staying quite a while, and would have taken a larger coffee, but could see that they were offering a \\"traditional\\" size coffee selection and thought I'd try it before forming opinions. I said \\"for here\\" while ordering our food, and asked them to give us a piece of baklava to split while waiting for our drinks.\\n\\nThe baklava was two dollars and maybe an inch and one half square. It was like most of the baklava I've tried before, not great, not bad. It was handed to me on a small plate and I searched for silverware and/or napkins and found five cocktail napkins next to the individual sugar/sweetener packets (in plastic restaurant wholesaler caddies) - no silverware.\\n\\nThe walls were covered in photographs from a local photographer, mostly of young \\"hipster\\" looking 20-somethings with flannel shirts and trendy glasses. A church hymnal was placed on the coffee table with the pages bent to create a fan-effect as it lay open - that was probably my favorite piece of \\"artwork.\\"\\n\\nWe sat down, ate the baklava slowly and I heard my double cappuccino called out from the counter. When I went to retrieve it I was confused at the paper to-go cup sitting next to the barista station. I mentioned to the male barista that my drink was for-here and was very sad that I would not get to survey the \\"foam art\\" as he took the lid off in preparation to pour it in to a ceramic cup. I tried to stop him and asked if he could just place my boyfriend's coffee in a to-go cup as well and he proceded to pour mine into the ceramic cup, then back into the paper cup and put the other drink into a paper cup. \\n\\nI was frustrated by our initial impression of Impero Roasters because I saw little to no information about what makes them special, where their coffee comes from or what they value. When my drink was given to me in a half-full to-go cup, lukewarm, I was offered no apologies, no offering suggestions/solutions to me, and the staff didn't seem phased.\\n\\nI had the impression from the reviews that I had heard that this was going to be a new local business that I could support in its youth, recommend to others and have a sense of pride in my neighborhood. I had expectations of friendly and educational customer service regarding what a cup of coffee at Impero is about; the service, the presentation and the product itself left a lot to be desired.\\n\\nI cannot say that I will not return to Impero in the future, but I will not be paying for it if I do.\\n\\nI would suggest (on the menu) that Impero inform customers where their coffee is roasted, and that they serve \\"traditional\\" size coffee drinks and offer smaller size to-go cups and/or larger \\"double\\" size drinks to fill the cups they have. Whether we are Americans in that we expect everything to be \\"supersized\\" or not, serving food or drink on plate/cup that is too large leaves anyone feeling that the proverbial cup is \\"half empty.\\" A little more thought into green practices and sustainability of the business might include using single sugar/creamer/sweetener containers at the sidebar rather than paper packets as well as choosing the dishware to complement the portion sizes and final presentation of the menu items."},{"name":"Kythira Restaurant","address":"707 Queensbury Ave","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Decided to try to new restaurant the other day and I really enjoyed it!

I got out and walked into I Love Sushi.\\nI felt safe. I was immediately met with kindness by the wait staff.  The interiors' were Japanese eclectic.

I don't think so.  While the green salsa is very good and mostly authentic, the Barbacoa is not.  I hate it when Mexican and other places do this.  Generally, they will take a cut of chuck, roast it in an oven and call it Barbacoa. \\n\\nBBQ as it is called south of the border, or Barbacoa, is a slow roasted whole head usually of beef that is cooked in a dug out earthen pit.  A fire is started in the bottom and when it has become coal, a barrier steel grill or a cast iron pot with seasoned liquid containing the heart, tongue and other tough muscular offal is put on top of them.  Then another grill barrier is placed down and the seasoned head is put on top of that.  It all is covered with Maguey leaves (Agave) inside of the pit.  Afterwards, a piece of steel covers the pit and dirt is piled on to cover it.  Another set of coals are put over that.  It takes the better part of the day to cook the BBQ.  \\n\\nWhen finished, the head is broken down and parts are either chopped together or sold separately.  The eyes are prized and the first to go followed by the brain.  Sometimes the tongue and cheek meat are chopped together for BBQ and sometimes sold separately.  Traditionally in Mexico, Barbacoa is cooked on Saturday and/or Sunday.  Menudo is also a weekend tradition (and HAS feet), but I won't go into that now.  Although the Barbacoa at El Taco Veloz is tasty, it is basically beef chuck oven roasted in lard.  You know cheek meat because it is fatty and the texture is not like the stringy fore quarter meat.  \\n\\nPastor here is another faux pas. Traditionally it is marinated in pineapple and Annato (achiote).  Not here.  While the seasoning did have achiote in it, there was no pina.  And the meat was very, very dry with little to no flavor.  The same was with the chicken tacos.  The Chile Relleno taco was good.  It had the classic egg battered poblano stuffed with a queso Oaxaca and fried in oil, most likely deep fried.  All of the tacos except the Chile were very lightly topped with chopped cilantro and fresh onions.  Usually in Northern Mexico the onions are steamed and key lime is also served.  Like I said, the optional green salsa was OK. It was Gringo hot, but not anything to light you up.  The commercial steamed or microwaved tortillas were pretty tasteless and a bit soggy.  They were not that great, but for a fast food Mexican taco stand, not real bad.  \\n\\nAll in all, El Taco Veloz had friendly with very good English speaking counter service.  The order area is very tiny with a small eat in counter along the back wall.  The menu is a bit hard to read on the two hard angled walls.  There is a covered seating area just outside attached to the building as you come in the side door to order. Parking is limited and you must navigate between the drive thru traffic. The bathrooms like the seating and ordering areas were very clean upon our visit on a Thursday afternoon around 430 pm.  We dined with about 8 others outside and 2 were at the inside counter.  The service was prompt even with a very large to go order and fair drive thru traffic.  One of the two cashiers apologized for our wait which was no more than a normal day at any other fast food place.   \\n\\nWith tax we spent around $20 for tacos: 1 each of Barbacoa, Chile Relleno, Pastor and 3 chicken.  We also had 2 medium sized Horchata (sweet spiced rice drinks--in Mexico simply called \\"water\\") which were very good for a commercial mix. You should try the real deal, as some restaurants do still make.  Even better, go down South and get one from the street vendor carts which have them freshly made and stored in large glass jugs.  \\n\\nBut if you are looking for truly authentic in the area, take the ride to Cumming and go to the Taqueria at Carnicera Hernadez on Veterans Memorial.  It's much more the real deal and guaranteed to blow you away if all you know is what you \\"thought\\" was real.  And by the way, just because a Celebrity Food Guy has his picture taken at a place and posted on their site, doesn't mean much.  As far as I know, my pic isn't on any caf√© site.

I looked around for a manager, didn't see one and we left.\\n\\nWill I go back?  The crab rolls and $6 pitchers call my name, so I am quite sure I will.  However, we'll request that he not be our waiter.  When you have a table of 8, you should be good to them; chances are you're going to walk away with a pretty nice tip for doing nothing more than bringing us pitchers for a couple of hours."},{"name":"Rogue Eastside Pub & Pilot Brewery","address":"928 SE 9th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"A chill place to have a drink, but nothing in particularly special about this place that makes me itch to return. Service on a Friday afternoon with only a few other patrons was way slow. I just wanted to get my drink on! I was also a little disappointed that they don't seem to have more Rogue beers, this is one of their establishments. Nonetheless they have a good selection and if the weather is decent, this is definitely a place I prefer to sit outside at. It almost seems their outdoor area is larger than the actual bar area."},{"name":"Ssam Burger","address":"2072 Defoors Ferry Rd NW, Ste F","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Found this from my scoutmob app.   I got a the black milk bubble tea with tapioca pearls and it was delicious.
