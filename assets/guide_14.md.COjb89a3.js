I was just looking through the reviews and didn't see one from me, this is an injust oversight on my part. I'm sorry Homeslice. \\n\\nI have a weird love for dine-in pizza. It reminds me of being a kid, and my mom and her friends would take all the kids to Mr. Gatti's (this was back when Gatti's wasn't ghetto) and we would play (sit down!) Pac-Man and watch the big screen TV when all of the dads were out of town.\\n\\nHomeslice reminds me of that, but without the TV or Video games, which is just fine by me. Also? In high school, there was this girl named Nikki who I was friends with (well, I always said she was fun to party with but I wouldn't trust her fars I could throw her, so maybe \\"friends\\" is too strong a word) who used to thrust her crotch out while grabbing it and go, \\"Fuck off, Homeslice.\\" So the name makes me giggle all the time thinking about that chick doing that.\\n\\nAs for the pizza, damn that is good pizza. I like foldable, thin crust pizza with minimal toppings. In fact, I prefer just a plain cheese pizza and Homeslice does a mighty fine job indeed. The sauce is super fresh and not too \\"pasty\\" or sweet. The cheese is ooey and gooey and a perfect ratio to the sauce and crust.\\n\\nIn addition to the pizza, I love the Greek salad. The dressing is tangy and a little lip puckering, but make sure you ask for the feta on the side as they have a tendency to over-feta. \\n\\nAt work, we've decided that when the lone male on our team isn't with us, we're going to go to Homeslice for \\"Cougar Lunch\\" because the boys on staff are so damned cute! And so young that a few of us could probably have birthed those boys.\\n\\nGreat pizza, awesome salad, and cute young boys.

The lunch crowd was mostly gone and there were multiple parties left in the restaurant, but basically finishing up.  There were open tables but we (as a party of five) still waited a few minutes.\\n\\nWe all ordered what we thought to be quick , simple meals.  Soups, salads, a club sandwich.  No big entrees, no meats to cook.  Our order was taken at 2pm, one person got his salad at 3pm, and the rest of us got our meals (including other salads) at 3:30pm.  What??!!!  Three of us ordered soups and there was no spoon in the roll of silverware, so we asked for spoons and the waitress brought dirty spoons out to us.  Now I understand that silverware may not be sparkling after the dishwasher - I'm not usually a stickler for looking 'nice' - but one spoon had food crusted on a good portion of the spoon, and another still had sauce on it from someone else's meal.  My sister hates to ever voice a complaint but even she was moved to ask for a new spoon.\\n\\nMy chicken noodle soup was peppery, and the California Club sandwich was pretty sad - much closer to a premade sandwich that you'd find in a gas station than anything I'd ever expect in a restaurant.

I got to sample quite a few varieties and thoroughly enjoyed all of them!  I'm a donut snob so I take this very seriously.  The line was fairly long on a Saturday afternoon but was much more manageable on a weekday morning, but my one-star deduction is simply because of the line.  It's fun to stand there with all of these other random people who are there for donuts just like you are, but if you really want one now, it can be a problem since you may have to wait for a while.  On the bright side, they're open 24/7, and since I continually rant that most of the donut shops in Denver close before dinner, this pleased me greatly.  Be aware that they are cash only, though there is an ATM inside the store.  The place itself is a riot, with all sorts of goofy posters and trinkets all over the tiny store.  But nobody should care that much about the setting; we all know why we're here.  The Portland cream is the \\"official donut\\" of the city and it was probably the best custard-filled donut I've had.  The voodoo donut was creative and also tasty, though I'm not much for raspberry filling.  I skipped the maple bacon bar, though they are very popular.  My favorite was the raised donut with chocolate icing and Oreo bits, drizzled with peanut butter.  There's about a ten-way tie after that, since I liked every one I tried.  Mmm...

The stand out appetizer was the salt cod croquettes. Excellent flavor. The crudo was also great but the portion a bit tiny. Would still order it again though. For the vegetables we had the beets, cauliflower, and some fries.  All were excellent. And for the hard plates we went with the brick chicken, the octopus, and the spare ribs. Though I know the brick chicken is something they are known for the standout dish was the spare ribs. Highly recommend.  Dessert was some chocolate mousse dish and the birthday cake sandwich both an excellent way to close off the meal. \\n\\nI can see why the hype with launderette. I will definitely be going back.

Very big wings, with ample sauces, enough to use to dip wings in while eating. There were actually chunks of Garlic in the butter sauce with the Parmesan wings - which I really liked.  So as far as wings & sauces go, this was pretty good and better than most!  They also had some TVs going showing sporting events which was nice.  The wings came out very quick and were hot!  Also when I was paying I saw back into the kitchen and saw a tub of fresh wings that they were putting down to fry...so it was good to see they were at least defrosting wings or maybe they were even fresh and at least not deep frying frozen wings! \\n  The Not So Good: ordered side salads and the lettuce seemed like it had been frozen.  They cut up a piece of ham and a slice of yellow and white cheese and place on the salad.  For me, I would much more prefer shredded cheese on my salad.  probably wouldn't order again.  Honey BBQ Wing Sauce was a bit \\"ketchupy\\".\\n  The What Ya Can Really Work On: When we walked in I was kinda taken aback by the decor.  It felt and looked like a truck stop or an early 70's diner.  It was clean, but it was just kinda not so contemporary.  As a 1st time and probably only time eater at this place (was over in Kissimmee for a ballgame) I can tell you that when we walked on, 2 of the people I was with wanted to walk right back out when they looked around the place.

He did not seem too happy that we wanted to start with some water (okay buddy it was hot and humid outside can you please not give us an attitude about ordering some waters geez). \\n\\nHe also explained to us that they have a limited menu after 10:00pm, which to the restaurant is considered \\"late night.\\" Ummm okay, that is fine\\n\\nOrdered:\\n\\nThe Notorious P.I.G- smoked pork, bacon, jalapeno, sage sausage topped with mac n' cheese, Dr. Doppelg√§nger Texas BBQ sauce.\\n\\nI asked for the mac n cheese on the side and no jalapenos. \\n\\nOur order took forever to come out, and our waiter came by to let us know (woo hoo) and to also try and get us to order a drink from the bar (yes I understand your Red Headed Stranger cocktail looks great but we have other places to drink tonight). After awhile he gave us asking us.\\n\\nWhile waiting for our food I went to use the restroom, ladies getting to the restroom is a trip and a half as you are having to walk down a hall way, pass the kitchen (be careful) and then there is the restroom (watch out for the door, it swings open to the right). Once inside if you are lucky you can get into a stall that is clean, otherwise, you will be getting to know the other people in line (and hopefully they are not overly drunk). \\n\\nGetting back to the table, our food finally arrives. Good thing, we were both hungry!\\n\\nFor $8.50, I would have expected more than a slim hotdog covered in toppings. In a way, I felt sad for the poor dog. \\n\\nThe good:\\nThe taste was good really liked the pork, bacon and sage combo. It had a spicy smoky taste along with their Doppelganger BBQ sauce. It was lip smacking.\\nMac n Cheese was a-okay nothing to exciting, I put some on my dog, and it was not life changing or anything.

The bread, was out of this world. The ham tasting - even better. There we were, I was primed for a great entree. I got the North Star lamb. This is where the meal started to fall apart. Good lamb, cooked on the rare side of medium rare is always tasty. But that was it. No sauce, no distinguishable flavors. The braised lamb had a great flavor profile but was super dry. Then the real kicker, there was no starch on the plate!!!!!! None. Just three (fairly small) pieces of lamb and shredded carrots (and a few indistinguishable, unremarkable veggies). To be honest at $35 and entree in Boston, I expect more. Your rent is not NYC high - feed me. My fianc√© got the pork shank, which was massive and really pretty. Which made my entree even more depressing. As I chewed away on on of my three tiny bits of meat. That all said, service was great throughout. Atmosphere was cool (very shallow chairs) but I enjoyed it. The problem is when the meals is well into the $200 range in Boston, there are expectations. And three tiny pieces of lamb on a plate with some shredded carrots is not enough. I love food. I spend too much money on food but almost never regret it. But when I feel like it isn't worth it - that is a major problem. And given that there are multiple restaurants in this city that will deliver a near flawless meal for $200, townsman, you have some serious work to do to get people coming back."},{"name":"Santouka Harvard Square","address":"1 Bow St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"My friend likes that place very much.

We went on Monday when you get a 3 topping for $5.55, the cashier didn't give me the deal on one of my pizzas and when I pointed this out to her, she tried to take the difference out of the tip jar, which was wrong and she was probably hoping I'd say that's okay.  I told her I'd pay the difference for a cookie and she tried to overcharge me again!! She tried to convince me she was right and when I walked her through the amount it should be close to and she took her card and changed it to the right amount just like that.  Weird.  Then this is a family establishment and they had Ultimate fighting on, where my two daughters looked up and saw a man's face getting beaten to a bloody mess.

For our meal, I ordered the special, which were lamb chops with polenta cakes and fruit chutney and some sort of red wine reduction.  My partner ordered the pork loin with a potato-chorizo-greens hash.  The chops were very well cooked and tasty.  The rest of the plate was lackluster.  The polenta cakes were too buttery, something that I normally wouldn't complain about but the flavor was just off.  The report on the pork was that it was tasty but pretty salty - perhaps brined but not washed thoroughly enough.  The hash was good, too.\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the strawberry-rhubarb crumble and the lemon tartlett.  Both of these were just ok.

My review is reserved for the brunch menu. I love the laid-back feel of this place. I love the classic rock music pumping in the background. More importantly, I love the CAD8.00 brunch menu.\\n\\nI mean, seriously, you can order Eggs Benedict, Buttermilk Pancake, Chorizo Hash, Omelette, Quiche, French Toast, Wrap, etc. and each item will run you the same - CAD8.00. And for that price I didn't expect much serving, but I was wrong. It was more than enough and the whole restaurant was great to experience either alone or with a group of friends.\\n\\nThe Chorizo Hash I definitely enjoyed which was a mix of potatoes, caramelized onions and pieces of chorizo on a dish. Another winner is the Roasted Tomato Quiche which had cherry tomatoes, goat cheese and balsamic reduction.\\n\\nAnd the service is what you would expect from a Canadian restaurant. Out of your face, but available somewhere around when needed so you can enjoy your meal among friends in peace.\\n\\nThe reason why I'm giving this 5 stars for brunch is because a lot of places serve the same old omellete, french toast, benedict menu. This restaurant offers the same choices, but with the added flare in ingredients. And while others offer theirs starting at CAD10.00, The Whip offers theirs at a flat CAD8.00.\\n\\nSo while I can't comment on the lunch and dinner menu and prices, it's one that I would definitely keep on coming back to when I'm lazy to prepare my own in the morning.\\n\\nTIP: Because the restaurant is sitting at the edge of a neighbourhood you can easily find paid and free street parking.

My husband got the Tofu Saag, the flavor was excellent, but he didn't like how the tofu was in very large chunks. He'd  get it again and ask them to cut it smaller. I got Aloo Gobi. The plus was that it was mostly cauliflower; I hate how it's half potato ($.40 a lb!) at other places. The flavor was good, but really a bit tomato-y to me. I thought it needed more seasoning.

The buns were perfect soft and toasted, though. The best thing here? The fried cheese sticks. They take nice thick mozzarella sticks and bread them by hand and fry them flawlessly. The light crust makes a perfect greasiness for the rather ordinary marinara to contrast with. \\n\\nLiquid-like solid food: The chili was slightly watered down, but it was still plenty meaty, bean filled, and flavorful. They water it down, but they give you a but load of chili--about 2 bowls worth. The baked beans were pretty disappointing; way, way too sweet in my opinion. However, for $1.50, they give you a HUGE 3 cup portion. If you are hungry, this is your side dish, but it probably has about as many calories as a meal.\\n\\nThis eatery/drinkery is a great choice for those close by to grab some good grub, cheap drinks, and yell at the TV.

I had the fried chicken breast, Mac and cheese and turnip greens. All of them were absolutely amazing. The breast was fresh and juicy. The baked mac n cheese was full of flavor and creamy and so were the greens.

We walked in and my friend alerted me he never actually dinned in before he always took take out. We were greeted by a nice lady and we were seated right away. the servers were extremely attentive and were quick to take ours and refill our drinks through out the night, nothing more needs to be said about the employees, A+. I started with a side of egg rolls which came out pretty quick, they were great and a hot green tea. The egg rolls had some really good flavor. Texture was great, the contents weren't over-shredded in a food processor appears they were just cut and placed in the old fashion way (the best way). Also +1 on the green tea, upon inspection they use good bags of tea with real leaves rather then the generic green tea you can buy at walmart, one suggestion would be to find a better pot to place the tea in. Its extremely hard to pour the tea without burning your hands based on that pot design.\\n\\nI ordered the \\"Loaded Pho\\" except without chicken or shrimp, which is just the rare beef, brisket and meatballs along with the normal basil, bean sprouts, lime wedge, cilantro and jalapeno on the sides. All the sides were fresh, the lime wedges and cilantro were forgotten but those were fresh as they arrived as well. The broth had a very rich and beefy flavor with a bit of salt but was still very desirable. After adding everything and mixing the end product was pretty good. My only complaint was the brisket tasted really plain and generic had no flavor or contribution to the dish other then consistency. The rare meat was the best part of the protein and the meatballs tasted over seasoned but they still had good flavor. \\n\\nOverall this establishment was a nice find for a restaurant in a strip mall. The employees were nice the food was good and the price was really affordable between the 4 of us it was only $54 and some change. I would definitely suggest checking this place out if Chinese/Vietnamese cuisine is your forte!"},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Popped into Frank upon the recommendation of a friend while in Austin. \\n\\nHad great hopes as the menu looks so amazing and unique!

This place was in a word, fantastic. \\n\\nMy husband and I were in Orlando in August and wanted seafood. Fresh seafood at a non-chain restaurant, someplace that locals frequent, and a decent lunch. I went to school in Winter Park and have family in Orlando, but had never been to this part of town before. It's not exactly run down, but, Disney it ain't. We walked inside and my warning bells started to go off immediately: no one inside, and it looked like a bomb shelter. I thought for a second they were closed, but a really nice waitress came over to greet us with menus, so I told the voices in my head to shut it, and we settled in for a great afternoon. \\n\\nThey are known for their oysters which is what we wanted, so after perusing the menu we decided on the bucket of oysters for about $18. Yes, that's right, you heard me, a BUCKET of oysters, 3-4 dozen, for the low low price of $18. Man, we were in oyster heaven. You do, though, have to sit at the counter for the bucket deal, because they shuck them right in front of you as you eat them..I know! I loved that part. The counter is a big slab of concrete, I think, and you just toss the shells as you eat. Your server shucks as you go, and they are fast..we couldn't keep up! The oysters are huge, fresh, delicious, and you can have them raw or steamed, so we went with a bucket of lightly steamed and then a bucket of raw. They are served with a sleeve of Saltines, hot sauce, cocktail sauce, horseradish, and lemon. I'm telling you, you can't imagine how great these oysters are. And what goes better with oysters than a nice cold beer? Nothing, so that's what we have. \\n\\nI definitely had my snob radar on when we first got there, but it was very quickly shot to hell because the oysters are divine and the people were so nice. I bought a t-shirt that says \\"I like 'em raw,\\" and fondly remember Lee & Rick's oyster nirvana when I wear it.

Hostess said that we could get a table for two + an infant highchair if we would be done by 1, which was no problem.  She seated us, brought a highchair over, and sanitized it with a spray and wiped it down. When you have a baby, it's the little things that make life easier.\\n\\nWaiter was always prompt, taking our drink orders and being very familiar with the menu.

So on point.\\n\\nFood\\n\\n- Beignets plate to start. Absolutely fantastic. Mascarpone, goat cheese, and berry compote, as well as a rich syrup, complemented the fried puffs of perfection. We were so glad we ordered them\\n- entree #1: shrimp, sausage grits with cheese, diced bell peppers, Thai curry and a fried egg. Initially came off as weirdly plain. The grits were not those super engorged umami-heavy grits; slightly watery.  But then you got these patches of flavor bombs with the Thai curry and the shrimp. The thing to do is cut the shrimp (they were jumbo) and sausage pieces, then mix the whole thing up. That's what we did, and the flavors came together fabulously. Totally original.\\n- entree #2: the special they ran that day was the soft-shell crab grilled cheese with slaw, truffle fries and aioli. This one was in your face with flavor explosions. These guys are incredible with their homemade baked stuff, as the bread had a bit of crispy chewy texture that held up against the mix of melted cheeses and soft-shell crab. It might be the best sandwich I've had in months, anywhere in the country. I wish I could eat another one right now.\\n\\nAlso try the spring rolls (not your ordinary thing!), lobster mac and cheese, and the fried chicken and waffles.

The line was out the door and when you don't get to seat yourself and then order. You order, get your food, and once you get your food you get your table. It doesn't seem like you'll ever get a table because there are so many people and the line is so long so how could someone get a table with all these people waiting in front of you? Well you do, and it's fun. I can see why some people wouldn't like it because you have to wait in a cramped area but this local woman was in front of us and talked us through it and was really kind. The overall wait there was probably equivalent to the time at a typical restaurant. Waiting:10-15 Figuring out order:5-10 Getting your food:25-30.

Thanks to the Yelpers for guiding us to this gem. We were checking out a couple museums downtown and being complete tourists, and decided to stay downtown for dinner when we were done. This place is about a mile walk from the Georgia Aquarium, and totally fine to do when it's still daylight. \\n\\nPoor Calvin's is charming, but tiny, and we showed up at 7:30 on a Saturday and expected to wait a bit. We ordered a drink from the bar and were kinda squeezed into a very small area while we waited for a table, but once we were seated, everything was smooth sailing.\\n\\nWe got a table outside on the patio, and it's a nice area. We went with the appetizer special, which was a tomato basil soup made with coconut milk. It had two giant fried shrimp and tiny pieces of grilled cheese inside. Very thick and creamy and totally delicious. Then we split two entrees. The Seafood Siam Wok Tossed has Tiger shrimp, scallops, calamari, lobster, pineapple, cashews, vegetables, basil cream sauce, plenty of garlic, and comes with jasmine rice. It was truly out of this world. Generous portion of seafood for the price, and it was so flavorful. Something different in every bite. Would come back for this dish alone. We wanted more veggies, so we also ordered the vegetarian yellow curry (apparently it's vegan). My boyfriend really liked that dish. I can only do so much sweet curry (it had a little bit of spicy), but it was packed with tons of veggies and tofu. \\n\\nOur waiter was really nice and very helpful, and everyone else we came in contact with was pleasant. One note... I got a vodka soda and it cost more than the specialty cocktails (so maybe just stick with their cocktail menu). Second note... not sure if this is Poor Calvin's \\"thing,\\" but they played some really terrible early 90's R&B pretty loudly, and it was just weird. I mean, I'm saying this in jest, but the music was hilariously mismatched with everything else in the place. That said, I will gladly endure more horrible music for this food!"},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Hard to find, but well worth the search.

For dinner I had the gnocchi with shredded duck. Delicious!  Lots of flavor in a broth, not a cream sauce. Definitely worth the price!  Plenty of parking across the street."},{"name":"Bison County BBQ Bar & Grille","address":"275 Moody St","city":"Waltham","stars":"3.5","text":"A really good steakhouse with some excellent sweet potato fries. I know it says \\"BBQ\\" on the sign, but there's as much grilled meat as there is barbecue (maybe more) on the menu and it doesn't have that \\"BBQ shack\\" feel that Redbones and Blue Ribbon do.\\n\\nDespite that, we had a really good dinner. The hubby ordered the deep-fried pickles as an appetizer, which were surprisingly good. They came with sauces on the side but really didn't need any. We both got the bison tips -- chewy, but that was not surprising as there was no fat on them, and very flavorful. What I liked best was that the meat tasted like meat, not some over-seasoned, soaked in tenderizer crud that certain chain restaurants serve to customers and tell them that's what meat is supposed to taste like.\\n\\nThe sides -- as I said, the sweet potato fries are the best I've had yet. Cucumber salad was light and a nice complement to the heavier meal. My husband did not like the rice at all, though, so I'd say skip that.\\n\\nService was good. We went on a Friday night and were seated right away, our orders were taken & food was on the table quickly. There was a little lag between finishing our meal and getting the check, but not too bad and we were in and out in about an hour. Despite being surrounded by families with kids and big groups of pals out for dinner.\\n\\nI liked the layout of the bar area as well, big and up front, and the selection is acceptable. I may just park myself there a few evenings this summer.\\n\\nOh, yeah -- almost forgot about the cornbread! It's different, sure -- sweet and cakey, not light and crumbly.

Big time.\\n\\nWe called late for a reservation and were lucky to get a cancellation's table.  The staff is incredibly nice and very professional.  The place was full but it is one of those old-style restaurants that does not pipe in its own noise to seem hip, so conversation was easy. I think our waitperson was excellent and it helped keep the ambiance light and friendly.\\n\\nThe food was OUTSTANDING.  Started with a shared brindad-like dish of salt cod and mashed potatoes. It was light, flavorful and rich.   Spot on.  My wife ordered the lamb shank and enthused about it for days.  The shank was meaty and tender.  The broth was immensely flavorable with the deep lamb flavor brought about by reduction. It was not the thick gravy-like sauce usually found today and better for it.  The tamarind mashed potatoes were great on their own and a perfect complement.   She is still raving. I had the trout.  It was supposed to come with spaghetti squash, which I cannot eat and they substituted Moroccan-spiced organic grilled carrots which were wonderful.   The trout was perfect. It had been seared, skin side down, until the skin was crisp and a great partner to the flesh which was moist and fresh.  \\n\\nWe had ordered one wine.  They were out of it.  The host offered another of a similar style to the one we ordered and gave it to us at the (less expensive)  price of the one of our choice. Nice touch.\\n\\nI know some people have a problem with inconsistency at Alana's but it is worth eating some good but not great meals to come up with one such as we had.

We showed up at about 5:15pm for the 5:30 opening and there were already about a dozen people in line. Right at 5:30pm they began seating people very efficiently, taking a few in at a time. We didn't wait too long before we were seated, very very efficient as I'm sure they are used to dealing with the opening crowd. We started with the house red wine and the fried cauliflower, chickpeas and aioli which is must try if you love lemony cauliflower! The wine is served in a small tumbler just like our former sweet Italian neighbours did! We also tried the arugula, fennel, radicchio and pecorino toscano which was topped with anchovies and a light vinaigrette.

Grass fed beef, wild fish, organic milk, everything housemade, but I think there is are two areas for improvement. \\n\\n1. Focus on the burger. Having all these exotic, interesting burgers are great for choices, but nailing down the burger should be a priority. I had the Oyster Burger which had a couple of misses for me, namely the oysters and the bun. The oysters had a somewhat briney taste, which was very off-putting. There was nothing wrong with the bun itself; however I feel with this type of burger, it ought to be a bit classier than a potato roll. It just didn't seem to go well with the creamy tartar sauce (delicious by the way!) or the fried oysters. With this type of burger, the bun should provide a bit more firm, crunchy texture. This is grass fed beef were talking about, match quality with quality. I would have figured they would at least get sourdough rolls from Clear Flour or When Pigs Fly. But alas, no. The beef patty on the other hand, while very small, was a thing of beauty! Perfectly griddled, packed with all that greasy, juicy, organic-y grass fed fat, and udderly beefy, it's everything a burger patty should be. It's too bad the bun took so much away from it.\\n\\n2. The space is extremely cramped with limited seating. I'd suggest converting this to a to-go restaurant or at least having that as an option.

The first two times were great.  My seating location was nearby the bay doors that they open up at night and the food was, overall, very good.  The third time, on the other hand, was not - hence my interest in posting a review.  I'll try to be as brief as I can be.  (1) The Men's bathroom was not acceptable (for how expensive and \\"upper class\\" this restaurant is purported to be) in the cleanliness department: the floor was sticky to the point that, when I left the bathroom, my shoes continued to stick to the floor.  It was dimly lit with what seemed to be a purple light so I could barely see but I did notice some large stains on the wall and the urinals weren't necessarily \\"recently cleaned\\".  (2) The brisket, which is usually very good, for some reason wasn't that great.  It had an exceptionally fatty taste to it.  This is normally the case but this time it wasn't the same.  (3) My seating location this time was perhaps too close to where they cook the food.  It was really smoky and we left feeling and smelling like we were at a bar where smoking was allowed.  My girlfriend was actually coughing a bit.  After a shower, I could still smell the restaurant's smoke smell on her hair.\\n\\nAll that said, I'd go back.

There was plenty of octopus (althought it was a tad bit tough) and it was really tasty.  My mom had the coconut shrimp which was ok, but the portion size was so small!\\n\\nAs an entree I got the fried chicken. It's pretty standard fried chicken and I feel like, as a fusion restaurant, they could push the crust a little more in the asian direction to make it more interesting and better spiced. I asked for a side of sriracha and it made it 10x better for sure. The chicken also comes with lobster mac n cheese which is well done. Also added a little sriracha to this :).\\n\\nMy mom and boyfriend both got crispy beef, which we had during restaurant week last year. This is a great dish!

Again, I was notified that they did not have adequate seating for a large party (though there was a fair-sized balcony that could have comfortably seated a large group). I directed my concerns to the host and after 20 mins. he barely apologized. \\n\\nIt was BLISTERING HOT inside the restaurant (might I add, the temperature that day was 85 DEGREES). They had a fan placed at the hostess station which was unprofessional and did nothing. I felt horribly bad for my guest.

Only 1 PERSON OUT OF THE 15 enjoyed their meal. AS THE HOSTESS OF THE EVENT, I RECEIVED MY FOOD LAST (NOT ONLY LAST BUT AFTER MY PARTY FINISHED THEIR ENTREES). I ordered the shrimp and grits however it tasted like beef stew. There was an half-ass apology (as if we were the reason both of your line chef called out).

Although it was a little hard to get a decent reservation a few days in advance, yes I should have planned better, we were happily surprised at how nice and relaxing dining at 6pm on a Saturday could be. \\nUpon entry I really liked the courtyard/grassy area. They had live music on the lawn which was very good as well! The front of the restaurant is the raw bar - we proceeded into the main dining area which I was very happily surprised at. From the street it doesn't look too interesting, but once inside it has a modern airplane hanger feel, but not at all cold. It's very open/airy and surprisingly not too loud. \\nWe started with the ocotopus and my husband got several oysters. The octopus was by far the best I've ever had - it was so tender and delicious! For our entrees I got the rock fish and it was amazing! My husband got the swordfish which was even better. The hush-puppies as a side was the perfect addition. We also had several cocktails while we were there which were all good as well! By the end of dinner we were so full, we opted to not get dessert (even though they sounded great) and headed outside to digest and listen to some music. \\nOverall a wonderful dining experience.

The low price seems to make people believe the food is tastier and the service is better... Well, it isn't. (And hey, this is a review coming from an equally poor 22 year old college student not some rich lady with a broom up her ass..) \\n\\nFood: Nothing to write home about.\\nPlease don't think I'm writing a bad review because I don't like hot dogs. No! I love hot dogs! They're unpretentious! They're universal! They're a summer staple! But... if you're on a quest for the perfect hot dog, be warned: Frank doesn't have the best hot dogs in the world. In fact, they're a bit too salty. Yes, Frank's hot dogs a re probably better quality than 7-11's dogs but hey- so are Hebrew National hot dogs. \\nOther than hot-dogs, they have a pretty bare menu. This is definitely not the place to bring a large gathering of friends that have a variety of taste preferences...\\n\\nService: WORST SERVICE EVER. I've eaten here 5-7 times (Not my choice!) and it ALWAYS feels like we are imposing on the staff. They act so put out that they're having to seat me... or wipe down the table... or bring us extra napkins. \\n\\nBreakfast: Don't get me started on how terrible this experience was. After staying up all night working on a Really Important Project, I was hungry and in the mood for a low-key quick breakfast. APPARENTLY their breakfast menu is just for show because, instead of having several options (as shown on their printed menu and on-line) all they had was egg biscuits.  Screw that, I wanted a beignet!  D:  Then, when I meekly and disappointedly asked \\"is that all?\\"  the cashier shot back \\"Yes, what do YOU expect?\\" Well, I expect you to have the food that's printed on your menu for one. :( \\n\\n(Note: this is different than brunch. They actually do have a great brunch and I wish that their brunch menu was their regular menu. They make some good chicken and waffles.) \\n\\nQuick run down:\\n1) I'd like this place more if the wait staff wasn't trying to be \\"too cool to serve.\\" I get that hipsters and irony and mustachios and skinny jeans and blas√© attitude are SO in right now but some of us don't give a shit. We just want efficient service. You don't need to kiss our asses but, when I say \\"hey, my coke is flat. Could I have iced tea instead?\\" don't roll your eyes at me. \\n2) More options = more happiness. I'd like to see the chicken and waffles make it onto the full time menu.\\n3) Fix the damn coke machine! The last few times I've been in, the sodas were flat. And you all know it! How do I know you all know it? When I sent back a coke once and asked for another option, the waitress was all \\"oh yeah, the carbonation has been off.\\" Salt in the wound: I was charged for two sodas even though they were undrinkable and I had to ask for a glass of water that then took 20 mins to arrive... \\n\\nP.S. Just because this place is a hot dog place, don't assume it is good for kids. If your howling 3 year old shows up, you will get angry glares from hung over hipsters.

Long story short my crab cakes were WELLLLL over done, dark and burnt looking, and then after taking a bite I literally spit it back out, without swallowing. There was this nasty seasoning in them and I could not even finish a bite. The salmon cakes and fish cakes did NOT have that seasoning, so my mom was able to choke her meal partly down.

The baked potato must have been cooked last week--dry, tough, and ugly.  My guests were polite about the meal, but I was embarrassed to have brought them to a place that has such poor food.

They have an excellent system of giving you a text when your table is ready so you can walk around Harvard Square as you wait. You can also check on your phone where your place is in line to be called for a table. What gives this place five stars in my book is the gentleman (main host or the manager?) who always greets every single customer with a big smile and a friendly demeanor. What I love is that this initial greeting makes you feel like you are entering someone's home for a meal and not just another customer eating a bowl of soup. Great location, great service, and delicious ramen: hands-down the best place for ramen in town that gives a smile for your tummy and a smile on your face when you walk out the door. Don't forget to bring your customer card (or to be sure to ask for one!): every $10 you spend gets you a stamp and when you spend $50 you get free gyoza and $100 a free bowl of ramen!"},{"name":"River Bar","address":"661 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"3","text":"Love it here!!

Oh boy oh boy oh boy! Haha...we of course ordered some of our old favorites like the Wantanes de Mariscos, Morada, Ostras and Empanadas de Carne.  We also tried some new items like Antichucho de Pulpo which is grilled octopus kabobs with chimichurri and a caper mojado de papa and Atun Fusion which is a sashimi style tuna with tamarind-rocoto uchucuta, served with mango-peanut salsa.  Both of these tapas were fabulous.  The grilled octopus was soft and the seasoned potatoes it comes with w moist and full of flavor.  The potatoes infused some of the octopus flavor which really helped to tie the dish together.  Now if you love sashimi style tuna then you got to try Atun Fusion.  The mango-peanut salsa gave a nice sweetness to the salty flavor of the fish and it's accompanied with some mixed greens.  Such a refreshing dish to have.  Honestly I have tried so many of their tapas and I have yet to find one that I haven't cared for.  It's rare to find a place where you can practically shoot darts in the dark and come out a winner every time on all your selections.  I tapped off the night with the Plato de Crema quemada which is three pots of Creme br√ªl√©e.  Mine was infused with grapefruit, basil, and Peruvian rum!  I loved, LOVED every one of my dessert dishes.  We also ordered a special dessert which was not on the menu but basically this was a fresh fruit tart accompanied with a sorbet which I can't remember what it was, but it was fabulous.  That sorbet tasted so smooth and fresh.  The flavors really fused together very well.  My experience here has always been top notch, but be ready to drop at least $100 if you want a decent selection of their tapas if you're dining for two.  It's totally worth it especially if your trying to impress a date. The dinner will sure to set the tone to a great night."},{"name":"El Burrito Azteca","address":"1942 N Rosa Parks Way","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Best Mexican food in Portland.

It's in my neighborhood, Chinese food in Portland is generally horrible... I really really was hoping this was the one!\\n\\nCame here solo and ordered two dishes: Zhajiangmian & XLB.\\n\\nZhajiangmian (1/5)\\nFirst off - peanuts in the Zhajiangmian?!?!? This isn't Thai food buddy. Where is the pork option? Why am I forced to eat a Vegan option on a traditional dish? The sauce is the \\"Zhajiang\\" and it completely lacked flavor. The noodles were soggy. As a frame of reference to how common and traditional this dish is, think of it as the equivalent to Chinese spaghetti. \\n\\nXLB (2/5)\\nThe xlb dumplings that came after were nowhere near din tai fung level, despite being more expensive. To be fair, I don't expect any Chinese restaurant in Portland to make this dish well... but when you name the place XLB, you have something to live up to. The skin was a bit thick for my taste, but on the upside it held in the soup well and I didn't pop a single one. The soup and the meat were nice and hot but completely lacked any flavor, which made me notice the doughy skin even more. \\n\\nWhat I found strange also was that at most places that serve this dish, they give you the option to mix your own dipping sauce - vinager, soy sauce and ample sliced ginger. Here they do it for you, and it's mainly just soy with a few thin slices of ginger. Very disappointing as I am a big fan of the latter two. \\n\\nIn short: save your 20 dollars and 30 minutes for the gas and take the 3 hr ride up to Seattle if u want the real deal. I wanted to disbelieve all the other terrible reviews on here, I really did. \\n\\nI understand establishments in a mainly white populated town would cater to a western taste palette (as documented by the Netflix film \\"searching for general tso\\") but and all the press coverage seemed to tell a story that screamed \\"we're about authenticity\\". Not living up to the hype is why the let down was so harsh. \\n\\nEarlier today, in light of Chinese New Year (dumplings is a big thing) i thought to myself: \\"either XLB or a 8 dollar bag of 12 frozen dumplings at new seasons...\\" if I could go back in time i would've gone with the bag. \\n\\nIf I wanted watered down Chinese and Drake playing in the background, I'd have been more than happy to visit Panda Express.

Every Monday at about 7 PM, they hold what's called a \\"History Pub\\" lecture in the gym.  One thing that surprised me about the place is that it literally was an old school.  It was an elementary school built in around 1915.  It was decommisioned in the '70s, I believe.  They have tour pamphlets in the facility though.  There's tons of rooms and activities.  Some classrooms are converted into hotel rooms and there's a large courtyard restaurant that's both indoor and outdoor.  You can order food from pretty much anywhere in the building, which is really cool.  There's around 3-4 bars in the building as well as a movie theater.  \\n\\nMcMenamins has a very eclectic theme throughout their franchise, and they conveyed that very creatively throughout this building.  In the gym, there's art on the basketball backboards.  There's art on the doors.  There's art pretty much everywhere.  It's a very unique place to go to.  \\n\\nThe food is actually a little better than most McMenamins.  They have higher quality fish, like halibut instead of cod.  You pay the price, though.  It can be 1.5-2 times the price as a conventional McMenamins restaurant.  The pizza is fantastic.  A friend and I ordered some pizza during the History Pub lecture and it wasn't too greasy, despite the Peperoni.  It was cooked just right too.  The wi-fi is a little weak in this building.  From the gym, I wasn't able to really do anything on my computer.  I had better reception in the courtyard restaurant.  I'm assuming they only have one router that's located by the hotel rooms. \\n\\nIf you're into local history with some interesting art, put this place on a weekend trip or something."},{"name":"Tatsu Japanese Bistro","address":"1441 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Saw this reviewed on the front page of yelp on April 1st and book marked it for future reference.\\n\\nI am disappointed in this place.

It's a 7 minute ride literally to Alfredos to me. When the driver showed up who is too lazy to walk into my building (so he actually calls me to come meet him outside and it's always carrying on a conversation on his Bluetooth EVERYTIME he conducts our transaction)  I gave him 25$, 20$ for bill, 5$ for tip. No Ginger Ale. I called first the shop they said it's past ten we're closed. To which I saidI know but I called 40 minutes ago can you get in touch with driver. That's when they admitted they didn't give him the Ginger Ale. The driver obviously doesn't double check his orders bc a sub and fry doesn't come to 20$ and the 5$ tip, everytime I give  a guy who won't make the 15 minute round trip, who just so happens to live near me and that's why he saved me for one of the last deliveries. How so I know?

Your founders got high and walked around a grocery store and came up with your donut ideas.

Their silly little donut shop now lives at the heart of Portland's tourism industry. A cheap product that can be made in mass and delivered to a cheap consumer. The McDonald's of bakeries.

We made a reservation two months ahead of time, for a tiny party of three, with one (my 82-year-old wonderful treasured mom) in a wheelchair and I SPECIFICALLY wrote them a note about this two months ahead of time. When we got there, we were first ushered into the area of the restaurant that has an area set aside with tables, and is SUPPOSED to be an area for disabled patrons. I think that's required in 2016, no? We were first left to wait near the bar, staring at empty tables, then told that the entire area was reserved for a large party. Excuse me? We had a reservation too!!! And our name was on their list! I cannot comprehend this supposed landmark, almost 200 year old restaurant operating this way. What a DISGRACE to Boston. Continuing on, we were then told to go into the other side of the restaurant to see if we could get a booth table with my wheelchair bound mom to sit at the end. OK. Mind you, and only people who are disabled or who have a loved one in a wheelchair would know about this, BUT IT IS A BIG DEAL TO MANAGE Boston sidewalks as well as coupled with the entrances to this particular restaurant. And we were made to go in and out of different doors. Turns out the other side of the restaurant was crammed with people. We were SENT to a booth. No good. No room! Horrid!!! AND, my mother had ZERO room for her legs at the end of ANY of those booth tables since the bottom of the table was blocking that side. How rude, insensitive, humiliating to all of us to try two different booths, with the entire restaurant staring at us, and not one restaurant employee helping us. Talk about making someone feel like a piece of crap, you certainly accomplished that for us. So, we had to leave. Were forced to leave. No one cared. We just left. Then, out on the sidewalk, whoever left the portable ramp in our way on the sidewalk. I was so furious that I picked it up and chucked it against the building. Awful. After securing my mom's chair on the sidewalk, I went back in to tell them we were leaving. A \\"manager\\" appeared, offered a gift certificate! Are you kidding me?? I left. Then, we had to maneuver the sidewalk looking for someplace else to have dinner. Again, BIG BIG INCONVENIENCE. Apparently, the real manager (older gentleman) must have been inside watching us, because he came out and approached us with menus in fans offering to then set up a table for us. My mom really was humiliated, but graciously kept her cool and just said no, thank you. I noticed that president Obama had visited your place twice. I am sure that such a wonderful, progressive president as he is would be dumbfounded at your LACK of compliance with the ADA and utter reprehensible conduct. Your restaurant is a DUMP in the way it treated us. You should be fined. You seriously should be. Sorry that we were only a tiny group of three people, with a little old lady in a wheelchair, but you bumped us to the curb for your greedy grab at the larger party that ALL OF YOUR TABLES, including all of your ADA compliant seating, was earmarked for.

Though seafood is the specialty here, I have had a few poor experiences which makes me wary of these dishes. The variety is limited otherwise and the prices are high.

Chewy with a slight char to give it some flavor.

Launderette seemingly lacks the dispiriting pretension that many super hot, ultra-new restaurants tend to possess, especially given the lofty reputation conveyed by a couple of James Beard nominations in month three of business.  We got in on a rainy Saturday with only a quick hour wait and were instantly enchanted by the retro-minimalist white and blue tone decor with a sprinkling of local art around the walls.  We loved our giddy, sweet server Hillary, a spot-on reviewer of the menu (impossible to choose).  Soon enough the food started arriving and pure infatuation took over. \\n\\nThe meal started impressively, a fresh round milky burrata shimmering in a shallow bowl, moist with brown butter, paired with a few slivers of black fig, crowned with a sublime wood-grilled slice of foccacia.  The bread itself was astonishingly good, and, like a lot of the individual aspects of the meal, could have provided ample satisfaction on its own.\\n\\nThe vegetable options are varied and spectacular, standing out both for their creativity and freshness. We decided to limit ourselves to two, though miraculously Hillary produced a third with her compliments.  The zucchini, julienned and gently cooked, was sprinkled with feta, pine nuts, cilantro and mint and finished with a dazzling pureed carrot dressing.  The colors alone made the plate come alive, and the masterful preparation brought out every virtue in the garden-fresh zucchini.  \\n\\nThe cauliflower was a mesmerizing mix of crispy florets, sunchoke chips, and tangy mustard vinaigrette, surrounded by a bright red rings of fresno chilies, just spicy enough to grab your attention but not too spicy to overwhelm the dish.  Our broccolini was tasty but lacked the pizzazz of our other choices , and the chunky romesco sauce didn't have the same intriguing complexity of other renditions I've tried.\\n\\nThe savory grand finale was brick chicken, a dish I've grown accustomed to loving even at far more modest and less-celebrated haunts.  This version was unbelievably moist and achieved a tenderness not I don't normally associate with the humble chicken.  Adding to the wow factor were the braised greens hidden underneath the near-boneless half-bird:  I'm not sure what glorious alchemy produced these slightly crisp marvels, likely some combination of the chicken juices, white wine, and deftly applied spices.  Hillary surprised us with a treat off the toast menu to accompany the chicken, a toothsome crab and avocado number with razor-thin disks of fennel and a tangy vinaigrette.\\n\\nAll evening we watched as festively multi-colored \\"birthday cake ice cream sandwiches\\" were delivered to adjoining tables, happily foreshadowing our fate.  The sandwiches, two symmetrical squares per order, feature creamy birthday cake flavored ice cream nested between a top and bottom layer of seemingly raw cookie dough or semi-frozen cake batter (or some undiscovered hybrid?).  Hillary says it's meant to resemble white chocolate cookie dough (to me, it simply resembled paradise), and that the James Beard nominated pastry chef strictly declines to provide further details.   It and many other aspects of the Launderette experience would keep me coming back, if only I lived in Austin."},{"name":"Scales 925","address":"30 Ivan Allen Blvd, Ste 125","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"Service ....C+\\nThere was initial confusion on the smothered pork chop lunch special ($11).

I love me some thin crust, so I decided to check it out. This was a couple of years ago now, and HOLY MOLY the reviews were right. This pizza is the BEST I have EVER had, Austin or elsewhere. I wish it were bigger so the wait wasn't so long on busy days (hint: this means every day, because when are they open and NOT packed? never!). I wish there was more outdoor seating. I wish pizza didn't have so many calories. But whaddayagunnado? This pizza is SO GOOD. The garlic knots are also delicious- simple, done right, good price. I love that you can watch them toss your pizza dough. I love that rice crispy treats are on the menu. I love getting smarties candies with the bill. I love the staff! They're always happy to strike up a conversation, ask you about your tatt, compliment your earrings, crack a joke. I love easy-going wait staff. Usually, the time they tell us is \\"wait time\\" is usually not even half that long, so if they tell you 45 minutes, you'll probably be ordering your pizza in 30. If you're in a rush or starved or just want a slice, there's a walk-through window outside. Parking can be quite a pain the butt, especially if it's a busier time. Back in the day when I first started coming here they just had the 5 or 6 spaces next to the building, and other than that you were on your own. The laundry mat next door was super strict about pizza patrons parking there- and then Home Slice was like, eff that! And bought the laundry mat! (Or was it a dry cleaners? Who knows. Who cares?) So now you have \\"More Home Slice\\" next door, and more parking! And pizza fans worldwide rejoice! :) If you like pizza, heck if you're even just \\"meh\\" about pizza, don't sell yourself short by not checking this place out. Whether you're a NY-style hardcore traditionalist, or just know a good thing when you eat it, you won't be sorry you went there. And you'll definitely be back.

First things first, the Alfond Inn itself, is a gorgeous hotel and has work by some really great contemporary artists. Walking in through the front of the hotel is great because you get to see the art before reaching their bar, which is also pretty great. My wife and I tried the MBA and the cucumber mint gimlet and both were outstanding.\\n\\nWhere the experience fell short was when we actually got into Hamilton's Kitchen. Our server never came over to greet us after we were sat and our hostess didn't give us any of their food/drink menus, just the Magical Dining menu. They might've assumed we were only going to eat from that menu, which is forgivable, but when we finally did get the wine menu, my wife waited about 20 minutes just to get her glass of wine! It took what felt like forever for the server to come and take our order so we just unloaded everything we wanted on the guy so we didn't have to wait any longer than we already had.\\n\\nI started out with the citrus cured salmon salad. It was a small dish but packed some really good flavor. For my main entree, I had the slow-braised short rib and it was actually decent but really really salty. I'm glad the serving wasn't any larger because of the saltiness and I finished it having just enough room for dessert. The dessert however, was not really good. It was their bread pudding, which is kind of hard to mess up. The bread pudding part was pretty small, possibly 3 x 3 inches and it was paired with a pumpkin-vanilla ice cream, which I didn't really care for and a whipped almond creme which was bland. To contrast the two bland flavors, they covered the bottom of the plate in a really sour and tart berry sauce which kind of ruined the rest of the meal for me to be honest.\\n\\nThe dessert and the server just left a really bad taste in my mouth. Even though the Magical Dining menu prices are all set at $33, I personally didn't feel like my dishes were worth it, especially with the bad service. Not sure if I'll be back, I was pretty disappointed with the experience. I'll still go to their bar though :)"},{"name":"Crave Restaurant","address":"3941 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"In my opinion Crave is the hippie version of Cafe Medina (which is more hip in terms of ambience).  Instead of Downtown Vancouver, you get the Main street neighbourhood. We went there by 1pm on a Sunday to get a tasting of their lunch menu, but they were still serving breakfast. Yes, breakfast menu at 1pm. Apparently on weekends they extend the breakfast time. Fair enough.\\n\\nMy breakfast food for my...umm...lunch meal was good. We started with a fruit smoothie which consisted of blended yogurt and their fruit of the day that happened to be mixed berries. I wanted more fruity flavour and sweetness (so I added honey) from the drink, but texture and thickness was spot on. Feels like I'm they're using frozen mixed berries and something I could definitely just make at home using Costco ingredients. For CAD5.00 it's not really worth ordering, but it does add to the breakfast experience.\\n\\nWhat I do recommend is their Breakfast Caesar. Definitely a great mix on the light side. Not too peppery or strong and excellent for, drum roll please, breakfast. This is something I would order another glass of than the smoothie.\\n\\nEgg white frittata for CAD10.00 is a good starting point with it's asparagus, tomatoes and spinach ingredients served with a side of toast and potatoes. Although I enjoyed the frittata very much, I'm disappointed with the toast which was over heated and was bordering on being tough. Same with the potatoes which varied from having a mix of soft to crunchy cooking like they came from a different batch of cooking or they were stacked pile high to make a lot in one go.\\n\\nIt's impossible not to end up ordering Eggs Benedict off the breakfast menu. Make mine traditional, please. Again, main item is flawless. But the side potatoes have the same mixed batch which got me thinking that the person cooking the main dishes is the seasoned cook, while the one in charge of the side station of the kitchen is the apprentice.\\n\\nAmbience-wise, it's pretty much laid back and comfy both with it's dark walls when choosing the interior portion or the patio - which you should be prepared to wait as this is the popular choice.\\n\\nStaff is excellent which I give 5 stars for the service. Typical of a Canadian restaurant, they are there somewhere around when you need them and out of your face so you can dine in peace for the most part of your meal. For example I had to ask for butter for the toast and catsup for the eggs and both times they brought one each per person automatically.\\n\\nSo why only 3 stars? Well, for now I'm waiting to be wowed with the food offering. Like I said, I've experienced breakfast and the taste and presentation is what I've seen from other restaurants.\\n\\nI will drive slower this time and come for lunch or at the point they actually serve it I should say late, late lunch (early dinner, lunner?). When I do then I'm going to re-evaluate it and hopefully justify why this restaurant is aptly named as such. Until then, at least that's something to crave about.\\n\\nTIP: Lots of street parking is available along the restaurant's block and lots more along Main street, but difficult on the weekend. There are nearby neighbourhood areas, but watch out for signs that specifically state it's reserved for the residents only."},{"name":"Launderette","address":"2115 Holly St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We loved this place!

They were such a disappointment.  The Pad Thai didn't taste authentic and the noodles were a bit undercooked. What's worse was the tower of raw mung bean sprouts that sat on top of the dish and interfered with every bite.

Started off having a drink at the bar, the selection was great and tried a wonderful sparkling wine from New Mexico. We were seated quickly once our full party arrived. The waiter who was very knowledgeable and courteous recommend the signature appetizer which was the salmon chips and we ordered the calamari as well. The salmon chips were very disappointing, to me it tasted like salmon salad on a potato chip. While it wasn't bad, it surely wasn't anything I couldn't create at home with canned salmon, mayo and some kettle cooked potato chips. If this is their signature appetizer, then they should probably get a new chef. The calamari was good, but nothing materially different then calamari then you would get at a sports bar.  \\n\\nFor mains I went with the waiter's recommendation and ordered the scallops. Again, it was not bad but there was just nothing special about it. Just pan fried scallops in a tomato basil broth served with grits. Again, there was nothing wrong with it and would be completely fine if I was eating at a place like Fresh to Order or the like, but not served at supposed upscale restaurant. I also tried the brisket which was ok, but again inadequate. One person ordered a burger, while I didn't try the burger, I did try the onions rings. They should be called fried dough with a touch of onion. It was ridiculous how much dough was covering the onion rings and how much grease they absorbed. Also tried a friend's beef dish which was the best of the things I tried, but it was nothing special. \\n\\nThis could have been a great experience as there was great service, atmosphere and a creative menu with the one thing lacking being the food.

After 10-15 minutes our cocktails arrived but the coffee (which I expected would have been there rather promptly) never arrived. The food arrived relatively promptly and provided an opportunity to request the missing coffe I had wanted now that my bloody had been gone for some time now.

But the service issues and weakness in the pizza prevent it from making me a fan."},{"name":"King + Duke","address":"3060 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"King + Duke is an interesting American restaurant in Buckhead with an intimate feel, a hipster vibe, and a decidedly young urban professional clientele. Our party of five men arrived for our 7:15 reservation on a Wednesday and were promptly seated in the bustling establishment. There doesn't appear to be a bad seat in the bi-level restaurant and I wouldn't hesitate to bring a date here. The open kitchen is a throwback to the 1800's and I marvel at what they're capable of putting out when heat control consists mainly of wood amount, coal amount, and changing the altitude of the pots, pans and grills over open flames. Impressive.\\n\\nWe ordered off the shortish menu quickly. I went with the catch of the day -- cobia today -- and two others had the Georgia brook trout. My other two compatriots decided to split the braised monkfish and \\"The Kilo\\" steak, a 49-day aged rib eye on the bone served with two marrow bones that look like they were flown in from the set of \\"The Flintstones\\".\\n\\nFirstly, the bread reviews are deservedly accurate. These are fresh, hot-from-the-oven popovers, a throwback bread that I think most people haven't experienced these days. The unsalted butter they serve alongside is some of the best I've had, and that's coming from a resident of Wisconsin.\\n \\nMy cobia was faultless, though be advised the cauliflower accompaniment is a tiny garnish on the same par as a few sprigs of parsley. If you want to be full, you'll need an appetizer or side. In this case, it's a good thing I ordered the braised greens. This was a small yet hearty plate of baby blue kale and collards that was refreshingly bacon-free and excellent in taste, particularly when supplemented with a squeeze of juice from the half of a lemon served alongside. I also sampled a Brussels sprout from my friends' side plate and found them the best I've ever had. The bite of my friend's trout provided one of the best pieces of trout I've eaten as well -- I can see why it is so popular there.\\n\\nEverything was excellent, though my steak-eating friends were a little disappointed in the steak despite the size, heft, and the fact that it was done to perfection. The issue?Just too fatty for them. They wanted more meat and less fat. While I can't help but agree with them, if you're good with eating a positively medieval-quality steak, rich with well-roasted fat and coupled with heavy marrow and a well-reduced Bordelaise, you're in business. It was a good steak if you want what I described. The coal-charred slab was beautiful and they reported the meat excellent, they just wish there was more of it.\\n\\nWe ordered a scattering of desserts and there were no disappointments. I had the creme brulee, which was accompanied by dark chocolate mousse and a just-right sized scoop of coffee ice cream. If I return, I would order this every time. The coconut cream pie with key lime & cilantro sorbet and homemade toasted marshmallow was a shocker that would really stand out in summer; the sorbet was intensely tart. The red velvet with shortbread and cream cheese 'frosting' and the chocolate cremieux with malt cake were both declared excellent, and all dessert could be shared between two people -- though you probably won't want to!\\n\\nThe wine list is authoritative and the drinks menu thorough and original. I had the Prince of Whales cocktail and it was decidedly good; I recommend it without reservation. Service by our server Molly was excellent. She was attentive, engaging, knowledgeable and incredibly pleasant.\\n\\nKing + Duke is a good place, bordering on great. My visit was in February and I feel the menu a little one-dimensional on winter. I'd like to see what else they can do, as most everything on the menu was meat-centric and heavy. I don't think I'd visit if I was a vegetarian, but they don't lose a star for that. There's just a little something I can't identify that keeps them at a four. Sill, they're very good and I recommend King + Duke if you're in the area.\\n\\nP.S. -- There apeared to be a good quantity of tables that could seat 5+. It seems a good location for a large group dinner."},{"name":"Alana's Food & Wine","address":"2333 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I was able to pick a restaurant for a birthday dinner, so yeah, I decided to splurge and go for a fine dinning establishment.

Boy oh boy, did this place solidify my pick for 5 stars!\\n\\nWe had reservations for 6 pm, and it was not crowded at all, when we arrived and got seated. As our night meandered on, tables were filling at a steady pace, and it was nicely full, as we walked out. Thus, I recommend making reservations, just in case.\\n\\nAnyway, to the food! We had a fantastic waiter - not pushy, not overbearing, informative, but not boring, and a friendly attitude. He gave us plenty of time to look over the menu, before taking our order. For starters, we got the bacon wrapped scallops, the cheese plate, and the salmon cheesecake. The scallops were soooo good - tender, no overly bold fish taste, very free. The bacon was so tender, I was able to cut it with one easy swipe of a butter knife. And the puree was scrumptious, light and fluffy \\"mashed potatoes\\"! The salmon cheesecake was very rich, but very good. The sauce drizzled on top paired very well, and smoothed the taste. I'm not one for many cheese varieties, thus that was gobbled up by the other members of the party.\\n\\nMain entree? Forget the exact, sophisticated names. I had lasagna with sausage, veggies, and  sprinkled parmesan cheese on top. It was SUPER hot when brought out, thus I had to wait several minutes for cooling purposes. First bite? Great! Savory flavor. The tomato flavor was not overly bitter at all. The noodles were al dente. The other plates were a mushroom risotto dish, and sea bass (the grilled asparagus was full of flavor)! They were perfectly cook, excellent flavor profiles, and could taste the individual components quite well.\\n\\nFor dessert I got their creme brule dish. I've always known creme brule for it sweet custard substance and caramelized sugar on top. This was different. The custard part had, what I can best describe as, a coffee flavor. It was sugary.

And to top it off, I'm late getting to this, but still feel the need to share my thoughts from my recent trip to Portland. Given the massive hype around this place, and being a pretty big doughnut fan, I had to swing by while in the area.\\n\\nShowed up around 11 AM-ish, and not to my surprise, there was a big line out the door. Luckily, it managed to move fairly quickly given the length, about 15-20 min or so. Once I made it to the counter, and being overwhelmed by all the options, I went w/the sampler pack, which included such staples as the bacon maple bar, the oreo doughnut (can't remember the name), an m&m and vanilla frosted cake doughnut, among others.\\n\\nSome of these treats are quite filling though! The bacon maple bar is pretty much a full breakfast. Odd as it may seem to a newcomer, the saltiness of the bacon and sweetness of the maple go perfectly together. The M&M doughnut was also deliciously addictive. Lots of things go on top of doughnuts here which you may never think of, but they end up being awesome.\\n\\nGiven the massive array of options at Voodoo though, I simply wasn't able to try everything in one visit, but overall, I will have to say that the strong point of Voodoo is their unique/unconventional topping combinations, and it's overall charm. The doughnuts as a whole, are above average, but not the best I've ever had. \\n\\nMy only real qualms w/the place are that it's cash only (they do have an ATM inside though), and there isn't exactly alot of parking around (not exactly VD's fault). Overall, I'll leave you to decide whether or not Voodoo lives up to it's hype, but it's most definitely worth a visit when you're in the Portland area."},{"name":"Rossi Bar And Kitchen","address":"895 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Big fan of this small and unique place.

However, from the moment we walked in the door, my party of 5 had a fairly pessimistic experience, and we walked away giving the restaurant a C grade overall.  \\n\\nFirst, we called the night before to make a reservation for our group at 7:30 PM (a Tuesday night).  They couldn't find our reservation right away and when they did, they didn't have a table available for us until we'd sat at the bar until after 8PM.  (D)\\n\\nSo we ambled towards the bar and had a few pretty darn good drinks, so our spirits were lifting somewhat.  From the reviews, I figured I'd try the Port Antonio. My friends had the Salty Dog and the Mother of Pearl.  I liked their drinks much better than mine, which really only tasted of rum and nothing else in a glass that was so filled with ice, it made it extraordinarily difficult to taste the liquor until it became quite watered down.   (B)\\n\\nWhen they finally had a table for us, they seemed to forget that they also needed to assign a server.  Really?  I understand the restaurant is pretty new, but you should NEVER have your guests wait nearly 30 minutes for someone to come to your table to give you more than water.  AND we only got someone to come wait on us when we had to ask another server to track someone down.  My friends had brought their 2nd drinks to the table but I decided I'd wait until our server took the table's drink order to get my 2nd.  Boy, did I regret that decision.

The server brought out the peel and eat shrimp instead of the al la plancha because the place is very loud and he clearly couldn't hear very well.  Otherwise we all greatly enjoyed our appetizers, especially the Oysters on Horseback where the smokiness of the pork belly really melded with the fried oysters well.  The one thing they could improve on is to not bring the crackers and the homemade cocktail sauce 20 minutes before you bring out the oysters.  (A)\\n\\nThe noise level.  It's very loud in that space.  It would be accpetable and easier to talk without raised voices if it wasn't for the loud music they had playing.  The level fluctuated a few times throughout the evening, so I don't think I was the only one to ask my server to turn the volume down.  Who turned it up in between is a mystery.\\n\\nEntrees.  Of the 5 of us, none was particularly enamored with their entree.  Skirt steak had so much sauce that it really drowned out the steak, which was very good on its own.  Halibut was just basic, nothing to write home about, with one little hen of the wood mushroom.  Seared tuna with octopus, like others have said, had one TINY LITTLE PIECE OF OCTOPUS.  Why?  Octopus is relatively cheap, especially compared to tuna.  Not so many Americans are keen on octopus, so when someone orders octopus on something, it means that they like it.  Scallops.   3 scallops and you want to charge $28?  They weren't that good to justify the price.  And the swordfish sounded really incredible on paper, but just didn't deliver.  (D)\\n\\nWith tip, our party spent nearly $100 per person and neither of us got dessert.  While I still remain optimistic about the restaurant, for the money and our experience, we have so many other great places to dine in Atlanta.  We all concluded that if we were to go back to The Optimist, it would only be for drinks and appetizers and we'd sit outside on the patio so we could actually talk."},{"name":"Wing Zone","address":"1275 Powers Ferry Rd SE, Ste 130","city":"Marietta","stars":"2.5","text":"I enjoy wings, but not very often.

With the exception of raspberry romeo, they all had a dry, thick cakey texture with stale, cracked glaze/frosting. It has a huge let down and nobody ended up finishing them. The raspberry romeo was somewhat soft and chewy and was the best out of the classical four. We also got Maple Bacon Donut and the Memphis Mafia Donut which are larger and more atypical. The Maple Donut was my favorite donut for the delicious combination of textures (real bacon on a maple syrup glazed donut) and flavors. The Mephis Mafia Donut was more of a fritter than a donut and was also good but being covered in chocolate frosting, peanut butter, peanuts and chocolate chips, it was a little too much for me. Overall, I think you should definitely try Voodoo Donuts but if you buy into the buzz surrounding it, you're setting yourself up for a little disappointment.

The exterior rub was heavily peppered, as that is a Mueller tradition. The ribs were very tasty, not quite as tender as i prefer, but were still very good. The prime rib was outstanding, as it was leaking red juices in my to-go bag. It had a nice pepper/salt rub, and was cooked about perfectly. I couldn't around to trying the chopped beef or pork chop. Maybe next time. The sauce was pretty much like his spicy sauce he had at the old joint, with a good smoke and pepper flavor. \\n\\nThe cheese/squash casserole was as good as ever, and the chipotle coleslaw was very tasty and a nice surprise. The place looked clean still, and he had a rather large crew helping in the trailer, while John was tending the pit and ferrying food back and forth. I would rate it as perhaps the 2nd best BBQ in Austin, and one of the top 3 or 4 in central Texas. Being a trailer, it doesn't have an atmosphere like Smitty's or Vencil Mare's, but the food is awesome just the same. \\n\\nAlso, the price per pound of most bbq joints is rather high now, with brisket at $14/lb and prime rib at $20/lb i think.

Loud pop music at all times, sparse uncomfortable seating. This was my 3rd time eating there and each time I've been unimpressed, as much with the food as the service and the price. Earlier today I ordered a turkey club with avocado instead of tomato and after inspection I noticed there was little more than a few specks of what looked like avocado paste. Avocado costs extra so I brought it to the attention of the cashier politely, saying she could just bring me over a few slices of avocado and that'd be fine. She subtly rolled her eyes and didn't say anything as she headed to the kitchen. I sat back down.

However, I was surprised to find a line outside the door on a Saturday night around 10pm. We waited about 15 minutes, and although the line went by pretty fast, I could feel the pressure at the register. The cashier was pretty snappy and not pleased to answer my questions about donut flavors. When I asked what the blue and pink donut on display was, she said it was called Miami Vice and tasted just like the drink. I told her I didn't know what the drink tasted like, and she gave me a 'wtf' look and described as 'artificial berry'. Not sold. I ended ordering the famous voodoo donut and a blueberry cake donut. They were both good, but not any better than the donuts from local convenience stores in California. I think going to Voodoo was a good experience, but I would not come back solely for the donuts.

Maybe even 5. When my blood starts suffering from a severe bagel deficiency, this is the first thing I want. But lately, this place has gone really downhill.\\n\\nFirst of all, I agree with the other somewhat negative reviews that the help here makes the dining experience much poorer. My GF and I used to comment that every time we went there, the employees were new. At a certain point it gets old being helped by bagel n00bs who mess up your order all the time.\\n\\nThe second problem is this, and it bothers me more than the service, actually. When the economy is doing  this craziness its doing, you have two choices. You can raise the prices of your food, or you can drop the quality. Raising the prices is acceptable. In fact, it makes sense, and most people will probably be OK with it. If some people don't come back, so be it.\\n\\nBut dropping your quality immensely (while also raising your prices, which they did) is just bad business. Look, I know avocado is expensive. I grocery shop just like everyone else. But when I order avocado on my bagel, I want more than two small slivers on each half. And stringy brown avocado: not OK.\\n\\nI've gone back half a dozen times since I told myself I wasn't going anymore. I'm weak-willed that way. Maybe I think its going to be better. Really, I think I just want the day-olds (which are great, by the way).\\n\\nOwners of Kettleman's, please take note: you are squandering the goodwill of this city. We take care of good local restaurants that serve good food, even if it costs a little more.

I label it as street food chicken at its worse my verdict of this place.  Meaning i felt that instead of it being freshly cooked right there in front of me, i could have gone to HEB and could have been more satisfied of my chicken order.

The onion rings looked fairly good but were greasy and overly battered and SALTY. In one of the oysters I found a chard of shell that I thought might have been a shark's tooth.

The 'cook' says 'sure' then deliberately puts each piece into the bag at the SLOWEST possible rate...obviously upset that I asked him to leave the kitchen.

Being a wanderlust of 5 continents, I am no stranger to Paris, Pornic, and Nantes. This quaint Parisian establishment nostalgically brought me right back to my traveling days. \\n\\n\\nUpon the greeting of the bubbly and personable staff at the beautiful counter of mouth-watering delectable goodies, I quickly \\"picked my jaw\\" off the ground and snapped back to reality. What took place over the next half hour was pure bliss! I tried their salted caramel brownie, which instantly melted upon contact with my taste buds. I also indulged in their mini pecan tart and macarons as I sipped on some iced caramel latte, which was hmm, hmm refreshing! Oh, might I add that they have their own pastry chefs? This added brownie point [pun-intended] sets it apart from most cafes who either import baked goods, order from local bakers, or have workers who double as baristas and bakers. \\n\\n\\nMoreover, the wait time in line is almost non-existent, and with attentiveness and alacrity, tables of the exiting customers are quickly cleared and cleaned in anticipation for the next incoming satisfied customer.\\n\\nI'm no food blogger, but my 3-times-a-week visits are a testament to belief in this place.

We arrived early to have a drink at the bar and were told there were reserved seats but we could stand. Shortly after that, a host came over and said that the two reserved seats we were standing behind were actually for us--I think he said something about having reservations at the restaurant gives you reservations at the bar. Overall, my impression of the place was a heightened attention to detail. In the bar area this represented itself IMO in the following ways: I saw two bartenders making an 'elixir' (that's the term they used!) and then using a cocktail straw to actually taste it and get the opinion of the other before serving. The drinks on the cocktail menu were so well thought out with crazy ingredients like eggs and bone marrow. I really loved the thickness of the slab of marble they used for the bar. We were seated at a very dark secluded booth--I'm huge on lighting at restaurants and this definitely passed the muster. Our waiter came and made pleasantries and asked if it was a special occasion at which point we told him it was our anniversary. We had either the best or second best crab cake we've ever had (it's neck and neck with the one at Teresa's Prime)--it had avocado on top and a spicy sriracha mayo type sauce to dip it in. Little to no filler and all crab. We each ordered steaks (one filet and one sirloin) with the hot roquefort butter and the homemade steak sauce that were very good. Mine (filet) came with the cutest piece of polenta in the shape of a cow. We also ordered a side of sauteed mushrooms and polenta, both were great and we would totally get the polenta again. The waiter was very attentive and at one point I told him to tell whoever cooked the filet that it was cooked to perfection and so good I could cry. So yeah, it was good. Then as our table was cleared, someone brought over a plate of truffles with a little edible chocolate sign that said 'Happy Anniversary' on it. I was very impressed with the food and was perhaps even more impressed with the service and thoughtfulness of both cocktail and food menus. This is a great special occasion restaurant!"},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"OVERRATED\\nOVER PRICED \\nthe service was awesome our waiter was very good and he was awesome\\nThe food was not good to me at all.

We went at a good time because apparently there was a huge crowd at noon when they opened and we got there about 2 hrs later. The streets all around were lined with cars and I thought it'd be a pain to park but tried the lot and a few parking spots opened up. \\n\\nNow I'm not going to review the food because that is specific to each cart so see their individual Yelp pages for that. This place in general has an ideal setup. There is a large centralized building filled with wooden benches (brand new nice ones), TVs, a kids area, and it's enclosed. It appears like the walls are made of these big steel and glass doors that can be opened in better weather- today it was nice to have a spot out of the weather to eat. I think they have bathrooms too but didn't check them out yet. \\n\\nThe carts are lined up really close together encircling this building. It's way better than Cartlandia where the carts are sporadic in placement with some hard to find or see. Here you can do a quick loop, order from wherever you want, and take it inside to eat. There was also a nice countertop like board on the outside of the building where you can stand and eat as well. Selection of carts was pretty good, Cajun, hot dogs, Thai, donuts, sushi, wings, burgers are some I remember seeing. \\n\\nOverall I honestly don't know how you could make a better food cart pod place.

Everything else I've had is is great as well, but I feel like they may have a slightly smaller selection than others.

Is it difficult to smile or must you treat me like it is a hassle for me to come to your restaurant to eat?  We sat and waited minimally 25 minutes before we had a server greet us and take a drink order. This is typical of this place, so we  always stop and have a cocktail before arriving at Two Urban Licks knowing it takes forever and a day to get service. Once we orded drinks, wine and beer, and an appetizer, calamari, it took about 20 minutes to get first round of drinks and appetizer. The calamari was disgusting, yet again. I have never had calamari as hard and chewy as this, and we eat calamari as our appetizer everywhere. Do no waste your time, ever. At this point, we were full on bread having waited so long on drinks and appetizer that we decided to split the NY Strip. We ordered it medium rare. More than half of it was fat and served medium to medium well, not medium rare. Our server never asked how our appetizer or meal was or if we needed anything.  Our server never asked why we only ate 4 bites of calamari and why we set it aside. It was left for us to stare at the entire time we were dining. No dishes were ever removed from our table until we signed the check and left the tip. Hospitality has never existed on any of our many visits and did not exist yet again tonight.

Interesting assumption and by the way, there is no minimum if you've moved to the lounge after eating. The food...ehhh decent. I had the crab cake (not great at all and I like crab cakes), salad was decent, tuna main course was alright, and my date said the salmon was good. The drinks were pretty good. This whole experience at a restaurant where dinner was $190 and drinks were $60....I would expect far more from a place like this."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"A Portland staple, and must do if you are visiting.

I love it all-nose to tail. Loving meat does not mean that I don't like vegetables. I crave greens just as much as a juicy steak. When Cliff Bostock wrote about Dynamic Dish, I was intrigued--especially by the promise of a tagine made with organic veggies. I went for lunch yesterday to counteract the effects of the Korean fried chicken I had the day before.\\n\\nDynamic Dish is located on the small strip of Edgewood near Caf 458. I snagged a primo spot in front of the restaurant using my stellar parallel parking skills that I picked up while living in San Francisco. Upon walking into the restaurant, I was amazed how sleek the interior of the restaurant was. I wasn't expecting it. The owner, David Sweeney, has impeccable taste and all the eclectic pieces and furnishings somehow fit perfectly together. The persimmons tucked into a wire cubby near the cash register really tickled me. The man has a great eye.\\n\\nThe menu (located on the chalkboard behind the counter) is small, but it reflects the pristine organic ingredients he has on hand. I ordered the tagine made with pumpkin, squash, tomatoes and other goodies served on bulgur wheat. Moon ordered the arugula sandwich with Emmentaler cheese on buttered whole grain bread. We both got the beet salad. The beverage selection is limited, but I did not mind. Sodas would be out of place here. We decided to share a bottle of sparkling water in some tiny glasses that Sweeney brought to table complete with slices of lemon. As we waited for our food, I took in my surroundings and couldn't help feeling like I was in New York or Europe--not Edgewood.\\n\\nSweeney arrived with our dishes and the colorful food lit up the table. The ingredients of the tagine were very good and the combination just felt like autumn. My only problem with the dish was the lack of salt--I imagine he is trying to keep the sodium content down and I would rather add salt than eat a very salty dish any day.\\n\\nMoon liked his sandwich and I was so tempted to take a bite, but my moderation mantra kept me from doing so. The beet salad was the undisputed star of the meal. The beets were julienne and tossed with dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, a little maple syrup, vinegar, and something else I cannot remember. Just a stellar combination of flavors that exploded in my mouth. I loved it and would go back for that dish alone.\\n\\nBeing the shopaholic that I am, I perused the mix of items for sale. Sweeney has some pretty neat stuff that he has collected from estate sales and other sources. I scored a gorgeous crystal dish on a pedestal for a mere $7.50.\\n\\nVerdict: An adorable spot with some wholesome food that is well worth the trip.

Think of this place as a solid \\"go-to\\" eatery if you have a few friends visiting from back home, or even a first date spot since everything on the menu is solid, well priced and with no pretention whatsoever.  If you're a first timer my recommendation is to go for the Chicken parm and maybe share the basket of truffle parm fries.

Since moving for graduate school, I've always made a point to go by Dynamic Dish when I was in town. It's probably because there are such huge gaps in time between my visits that the changes are so blatant. I stopped in for lunch while on my winter break and was torn between multiple sandwiches. As a compromise, I picked a sandwich and added the side item that would have come with the other sandwich - their russet potatoes. I thought it was a great compromise - until I saw the bill and found they charged nearly 8 bucks for the side of potatoes! And there was nothing to them - they were just cubed, roasted and salted. Had I know it would have been that expensive, I would have just gone ahead and spent the additional 4-5 bucks to get the sandwich and the other side item.  \\n\\nOn my most recent visit over spring break, I found that they now have a corkage fee....I understand corkage fees if the place actually sells alcohol, and they're loosing out on business when they allow you to bring your own bottle in. But if a restaurant doesn't actually sell any alcohol, a corkage fee is just highway robbery! Our friends brought a bottle of two buck chuck from Trader Joe's not knowing that they now had a corkage fee (I did know since I was the one who called and made the dinner reservation and they did tell me at the time), and of course there was no reason to spend 10 dollars to drink a two dollar bottle of wine. That just ludicrous. (I should say that our server did come back and waive the bottle of wine after we explained why we didn't actually want the bottle opened, and that was terribly nice of him.) \\n\\nThe same visit was also a disaster in terms of the service. My boyfriend and I split a large soup and a salad, and our friends split a salad and ordered the main entree. Our soup and salad came out within ten minutes. After waiting a bit for their food to come out, our friends told us we should go ahead and eat so we started slowly sipping on the soup. After a while their food still wasn't out and we actually offered them our salad (which we hadn't actually started eating yet) so they wouldn't have to sit there watching us eat, but they declined. 15 minutes after that point, their salad came out. They ate it and then had to sit and wait for their entree... Another couple sat at our table maybe 30 minutes into our meal and ordered the same entree our friends ordered, and had it served to them shortly. Our tablemates were finishing up their entree before I eventually gave in and asked David on his way back into the kitchen where my friends' dish was. By the time their entree, a fried tofu dish, came out, my boyfriend and I were done with our meal entirely, at which point we had to sit and watch them eat! It was soo terribly awkward.\\n\\nWith regard to the food itself, the soup was as delicious as they always are, but the salad was a major disappointment, which was crushing as it was the first disappointing dish I've had at Dynamic Dish. The serving size was smaller than they have been in the past. My boyfriend and I have been splitting soups and salads there for over a year now, and this was the first time that I would say that the salad wasn't large enough to split between two people. In addition to being smaller, I didn't think the items on the salad - sliced almonds, avocado chunks and scallions went particularly well together. Usually I try to make sure that I scoop all of the different ingredients onto a fork at the same time because the combined flavors of everything together has been so fantastic, but this combination did absolutely nothing for me. It's the first time I've had a salad there that, simply put, did not seem very well thought out. On top of that, the salad was waaay to simple to be justify the 10 dollar price tag. It was probably worth 6...maybe 7. It dawned on me that there's no reason why the prices shouldn't regularly change to reflect what's actually being served. I mean, not all salads and their ingredients merit a consistent cost of 10-12 dollars. If the food fluctuates, the prices should to. Especially when the restaurant is premised upon the food being local and in season - buying food in season actually makes it cheaper - not more expensive. Also, I didn't taste my friends' entree, but they did say that the fried tofu at whole foods (in the hot food bar) is better.  \\n\\nAnd then the bill came and we realized that they now charge for bread and butter. That makes me sad, because I love love love Magnolia bread and I've always filled up on my fair share of it, and, a bite of which in the past has always eased the pain of the incremental price increases at Dynamic Dish. I'm not saying that it's not worth paying for, but it should have been on the menu, and if not, you should inform the customer when they order it that there's a charge. Anyways, my visits of late have made me so angry that I just can't imagine going back anytime soon. It's just not worth it anymore."},{"name":"Scales 925","address":"30 Ivan Allen Blvd, Ste 125","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"Reservations booked through the website - not available on OpenTable or Seat Me.

The house-made bread was fabulous, good French fries, decent mac-n-cheese.  Hush puppies are good but the pieces of scallion (I thought they were jalapenos, actually) make them a little spicy, and as others have noted they're not crunchy.  Sides were changing throughout the evening as they ran out of things -- the table next to mine ended up with sweet potato chips, which sounds fabulous to me.  Sauces are all a little peppery for my taste, but the Memphis Sweet was tasty.\\n\\nService -- not so much.  The counter people were friendly, though obviously stressed out.  They use the same table-marker system that many casual places use (Fellini's, Figo, etc.), but they didn't seem to be able to make it work... people were walking around the dining room trying to figure out who ordered what (which wasn't made easier when the kitchen would, apparently, randomly switch out a side after it was 86'd).  We were extremely put off by the guy running the \\"bar\\" in the dining room -- he would pour a glass of wine or draft beer and then run around the dining room trying to figure out who ordered it, obviously frustrated and complaining to everyone about how they don't have a system yet and he used to work in full service, blah blah blah.  At one point some folks wanted to pull a few tables together and he said (literally) \\"let me move my manager's crap off that table and we can use it.\\"  So... if they fire that dude and get the system together (um, why not use the same table-marker system for the drinks as for the food?), this will be a nice addition to the Decatur scene.

Although it had a strange bite near the end of my chewing. I wonder if it was the garlic? Or do all escargots have that bite? I never experienced that with escargots before. \\n\\nThe salmon was cooked well, but I wasn't sure about combining the salmon with endives and risotto. Maybe I'm not used to having fish cooked this way with those ingredients . I'm too used to having fish cooked Asian style.\\n\\nAfter the appetizer and the entree, I still had hunger pains. Luckily, the dessert made up for that. I got the chocolate cake, and it was filling. For a small slice, it was deceptively heavy. The cake itself tasted decent. The ice cream was also a nice extra.\\n\\nIf it wasn't for Buckhead Restaurant Week, I would've probably left hungry since I rarely order desserts.  That means the portions were on the small side. Then again, I eat for like 3-4 people so it could be just me. I will warn you that if you are a big eater, you will leave hungry unless you get at least 3 courses. Or else, you'll have to fill yourself up with their free bread.\\n\\nI guess this is the only place I felt the dessert was better than the entree. So, I give it 3.5 stars. Anis had nice ambiance and service, but I go to restaurants mainly for the taste and satisfaction of the food, and I felt the portions were small, and the taste was slightly above average.

As we were here for a conference, I guess we count as tourists.  When I was an undergraduate in the area (over 5 years ago) I heard about TotH and never tried it, being a poor undergraduate.\\n\\nWe walked through the Pru mall to the elevators where a security guard wanted to see someone's ID.  Fine.  Then we took the elevator quickly to the 52nd floor.\\n\\nNow, we weren't exactly fancily dressed.  And we had had 2 bottles of wine already, so we may not have been on our best behaviour.  I wasn't entirely sure they would let us in, but they did.  The hostess explained that we could sit at the bar, but if we wanted to sit at a table by the windows we needed to order at least $24 a person.  She clarified that this would be about 2 drinks.\\n\\nWe decided this sounded like a challenge worth taking.  The views were absolutely amazing.  I can't say much about the food - one of us got the creme brulee and said it was very good. Otherwise, we just drank.  I was a little let down by their cocktail list.  I love classic cocktails - negroni, mahattan, etc - and most of their menu was fairly fruity cocktails.  I got a ruby manhattan, which was ok.\\n\\nFor the second round, I wanted to go with a bartender's choice.  Unfortunately our waiter didn't seem very comfortable with that.  I tried to explain the sort of thing I like (he didn't know what a negroni was) with the hope I wouldn't end up with a fruity cocktail.  I ended up with something interesting, tasty, and different - I think the waiter called it a tropical manhattan (or something, I was a few drinks into the night by then).\\n\\nIf I am in Boston again, especially with other visitors, I will try to go back.

Waitress was friendly but scarcely seen. Water was frequently empty; tip--if the wait staff isn't going to come around much then use larger water glasses. Drinks and food took an eternity. \\n\\nThe bad: perhaps the food took so long because it sat a long time as my food (the Seafood Newburg--avoid) was cold when it arrived. Which is especially bad for a cream sauce as it got pasty. And the rice was undercooked, which should never happen.

The Bananas Foster had sauteed bananas in a cinnamon sugar sauce and two scoops of Amy's mexican vanilla ice cream. The ice cream and bananas were a sweet, cinnamon, perfection combination, and it was a big portion! The ice cream cookie sandwich was huge, too. Two delicious, homemade chocolate chip cookies sandwiching a big chunk of Amy's mexican vanilla ice cream was magical.

It was pretty crowded and probably due to the holiday. I had reservations, so no wait. The dining area is completely open so you can see everything. They have an open kitchen on one wall and a large, well-organized bar that's lit up in a dim blue light. Seating is pretty tight. We sat at a two-person table, and had two tables on both sides of us only a foot away. Could definitely hear people next to us talking about our food, but that didn't bother me cause I was talking about the other tables food. At the entrance you'll find the oyster bar where you can select from several different oysters to try. \\n\\nSTARTERS\\n\\n-Yeast Rolls\\nYou get two pieces of rolls for free. They are buttered and have salt on top which is different. Pretty good\\n\\n-Seafood Gumbo\\nI'm not a super huge fan of gumbo. I like it, but it's never blown my socks off. I'm more of a chowder guy. The gumbo here was pretty good though. It had a nice spicy kick to it. It has sausage, oysters, and a little bit of crab meat. It's about a bowl size, maybe a little smaller.  It's served with a bread with a thick spread of garlic butter in between.\\n\\n-Mussels \\nThese were excellent. You get about 16-20 served in a bowl of curry sauce. The sauce is sooo good. Reminded me of the times I used to eat Thai Curry 2-3x a week. All of the mussels were a decent size. I highly recommend getting these. It's also served with MORE BREAD, but this bread was a garlic toast and really good. You can ask for more to soak up that curry sauce once you finish the mussels.\\n\\nENTREES - Nice selection of seafood. They even have a small section for non-seafood eaters which I was tempted to order from. Prices range from $22-33.\\n\\n-Peacan Crusted Flounder \\nThis is what my girlfriend got. I had a few bites, and it was really good. Flounder is a pretty thin fish, but it looks like they fold a couple of pieces on top of each other, so you get a good amount. The pecan crust was pretty good, and my girlfriend really enjoyed.\\n\\n-Duck Fat Poached Swordfish\\nI've only had swordfish a couple of times and each time it was a thick, dry piece of fillet. It came with pork belly and the waiter really recommended it, so I went for it. Best swordfish I've ever had. The fish was super moist, and easily eaten with just a fork. I need to find out where to get duck fat, cause I want to cook everything in it. It's made with a sherry au jus which was really good. There are little bits of pork belly, but I'm not sure how those fit in with the dish, but they were good nonetheless.\\n\\nSIDES - All the sides are pretty large and meant to be shared.\\n-Collard Greens\\nThese were pretty damn good. Maybe some of the best I've ever had at a restaurant. They were smokey, but had a sweet flavor to them.\\n\\n-Hush Puppies\\nAnother awesome side. They have a nice texture on the outside, and warm and soft on the inside. They sprinkle them with sugar and serve with a side of cane syrup butter. The butter was so good, I had to keep my girlfriend from eating it all after we had already finished the hush puppies.\\n\\nDESSERT\\n-S'Mores Ice Cream Sandwiches\\nCouple of chocolate cookies with a graham cracker ice cream. These were good, but nothing too special. One order comes with two sandwiches so easy for sharing.\\n\\nOverall this place was pretty good. Everything tasted great. It's definitely pricey so it's not somewhere I would come to regularly. No idea where parking is, but valet is $2. I would recommend making reservations at least 2 weeks ahead of time."},{"name":"Cosi","address":"1 Harborside Dr","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"It was just a buffalo sandwich but the service and kindness of the lady in front stood out in this otherwise dismal airport.

The last time I went was to a place somewhat like this, but the previous time was at a hot pot place, and the time before that was a place that was exclusively Korean BBQ.

It was obvious I was not Korean =). Anyhow, I was wanting something hot so I appreciated it, and picked another dish (can't remember what it was called, though I would recognize it on the menu).

I ordered the baked porkchop on fried rice with tomato sauce and pork and pickled vegetable congee. Both were good, although the pork slices are very lean, so you don't get the typical fatty, tenderness like you would in a century egg and pork congee. I liked that the congee needed salt as it confirms that there is no MSG.

She said she would check on the food and that was the extent of her concern. The food took an additional 10 minutes to arrive after I spoke to her.

I never ranted on any social media but this time, I can't hold myself, sorry. This is a ramen place. There is a reason why this place is categorized as ramen shop. RAMEN SHOP SUPPOSED TO OFFER YOU ONLY RAMEN NOODLE (and some side dishes). IF A SHOP OFFERS YOU OTHER TYPES OF NOODLE LIKE UDON, SOBA NOODLES, THAT IS NOT A RAMEN PLACE. I was quite annoyed when I saw some ignorant reviews. Please, don't say you are disappointed because they didn't have Udon noodles. THIS IS NOT A PLACE YOU GET UDON NOODLE. THIS PLACE IS PURELY FOR RAMEN. got it? \\nCONFUSED ABOUT VEGAN OPTION? Ok, Ramen is originally not a vegan dish at all. It is great that they have the vegan options and you should be thankful that they have options for you. And of course, ramen is not a simple dish, especially soup. So don't expect they have the clarified menu ready for you. Just ask the waiter and you are good to eat.\\n\\nOnly one thing I'd say about this place is it's pricey. In Tokyo, there are many ramen shops where offer amazing ramen around 5$. In my experience average price for a bowl of ramen in Tokyo is about10$.

The food was overpriced and wasn't even worth it. The place got slammed, and there were so many strangers waiting all over the restaurant for a table. Some of them even sat at our table for 20 minutes waiting to be sat. We didn't mind, but they were so vulgar and inappropriate. Everyone dining was shocked at what they were saying and how loud they were. The people working heard them as well, i'm sure, but didn't bother to ask them politely to lower their voices. This gentleman at another table got smacked in the head with a welcome sign because there were so many people standing in the doorway. Our server was alright, but he took forever to refill my water (walked past me 7 times, even filled everyone's water at the table but just overlooked me when i had my glass up several times). I wouldn't have minded, but the food was so salty. And for $22, don't use crap grouper. The water cups were so small, you'd think they would keep refilling them or at least give us a bigger glass. I'm assuming they intentionally bought small glasses so we would order alcohol, but we ordered drinks, and the jalapeno mango drink tasted like paint (i'm a bartender and i don't know how they can even sell that). The food finally came for 3 out of 5 us, but they proceeded to bring food for a couple behind us who arrived not 10 minutes before before the rest of ours were delivered. We had ordered our food before they even got there. Finally we got our food but the food runner i'm assuming couldn't even handle two small bowls of soup. He was shaking so hard i thought he was going to spill hot scalding soup all over me and my girlfriend. At least use a tray to carry your food if you can't handle carrying the bowls.

Stopped in for lunch around 1 p.m. on a Monday. Al-Amin is the rectangular brick building, the grocery store's entrance is the one on the left and the restaurant's is on the right; however, both sections are connected and you can use either one. \\n\\nWhen we entered, there were only 4 other tables occupied. The cashier/server did not budge from his post, although he did notice us walk in (with such a small space, anyone walking in wouldn't be missed). We took the initiative and approached the counter for menus and seated ourselves. \\n\\nWe decided on the chicken samosas, a lamb gyro, garlic naan, butter rice and chicken vindaloo.

We sent it back to the kitchen and was replaced 4 minutes later by another plate of similarly looking rice. Honestly, I'm not sure if they even gave us the correct plate because it did not look nor taste like butter rice. \\n\\nI did not really like my gyro. It's served with chopped up lamb instead of thinly, sliced patties like other places. There was entirely too much tzatziki sauce which made it very messy to eat. \\n\\nThe chicken vindaloo was pretty flavorful but spicy.

I think it's easy to overlook this place, even if you have lived in Austin for 15+ years. Located on the side of Highway 183 on the outskirts of Austin, hidden in a strip mall, easy to see how this place could be a great secret.  On this day we were joined by a friend Ron, over at steakchopsnhops.com. We walk into a dim lit, somewhat classy restaurant and I am starting to wonder if I am underdressed for the occasion. Once sat at the table that was lined with plastic like my great grandmas furniture, I start to feel better right away. The place reminds me a lot of places back in Detroit, not flashy, not over fancy, some old school jazz playing in the background. I am starting to really dig the chill vibe in the place. \\n\\nWe quickly notice they have a $16 Sicilian Style Pizza which gets me going right away, we decide to stay true and order a medium hand tossed also. I must add the beer and wine selection was kind of a letdown, very basic and somewhat bland. First the Sicilian arrives which defies logic, how the thick pizza cooked faster than the hand tossed, but hey no big deal. First bite I am impressed, the flavor was clean and not over spiced or acidic. The cheese is a different blend, almost like a fontinella cheese because it was a very creamy and not stringy cheese. I would have liked a light dusting of cornmeal on the bottom but that's my personal preference on a Sicilian. After finishing the first slice, the second pizza came out and it looked good also. Basically, same thing, the flavor was nice, clean and not overpowering. I would have liked to see a little more bake on the bottom but I think they are probably cooking both pizzas in the same oven which means lower temps.  \\n\\nIt was not my favorite but it was definitely a good honest pie. I think they are doing a really good job over there. I have since went back and got some Lasagna but was not impressed at all.

This meal came together in all aspects to mark it as one of those signature meals you always remember.  \\n\\nI was in Atlanta for a large conference and our CEO was taking our team of 9 out to dinner. But, as 50,000 conventioneers were in town, pretty tough to find a reservation for 9 late in the day. When our admin called Poor Calvin's, they informed us that they could not accommodate, but then she recanted and asked for our number and said she would call us back if something changed. Shockingly, in 5 minutes she did as a birthday party was ending early and she could seat us in 30 minutes. That really does not usually happen as they certainly would have filled that table up with the next couple of calls. Excellent service by the hostess!\\n\\nWe arrived at Poor Calvin's and place is not to much to look at, looks like a renovated house. There is seating outside on a front patio, couple tables for about 15 or so and were able to sit us a bit after our reservation time. You walk in and tables to the right when you come in and then a bar(packed with eaters)to the left. We sat in back, away from the kitchen with view of the park across the street. \\n\\nOur waitress with Lola and she was just a treat. Had a bit of a sing songy high voice, very mellow and her favorite vocabulary words were \\"sha-na-na\\" and \\"delish\\".  Her tone, attitude , description of menu and service was a delight and she was quite \\"sha-na-na\\" herself!\\n\\nThey take fusion seriously there as almost everything is infused or fused, whether it is apps, entrees, deserts or drinks.  We had a party of 9 so I will just comment on my meal, shared apps and drinks.  It seems all the ladies on my team had the Poor Calvin's Fusion Cocktail. It is vodka with soaked pineapples, blueberries, strawberries that chills for a week before serving. I believe multiple glasses were consumed by each.  I had the Dark and Stormy, made with Ron Anos Bacardi and very tasty homemade ginger beer. Served with crush iced and a very cool glass that was at a 45 degree angle.  Was beyond good, refreshing and tasty as hell!\\n\\nAppetizers we shared were the Lobster Mac n Cheese. Great blend of cheese, tons of lobster and did not kill you with the breading on top. Really nice portion. The Lobster Won-Tons were a revelation with caviar on top, nicely crispy and no one taste overwhelming. The ceviche was really the only disappointment as it was not really ceviche, just more of a mango-citrus salsa with shrimp. Still very good, just not what I expect when I get ceviche. \\n\\nFor my dinner, after going back and forth among 4 different choices for 10 minutes, decided on the \\"Duck Dynasty\\" seared maple duck breast, tiger shrimp, kale mashed potato, seasonal greens.  The duck was done perfectly with it cooked to perfection and the crispy skin and fat just separating from the meat. Was a full breast, super tender, skin very slightly seasoned but allowing the natural fat and taste to be the predominate taste.  The kale-mashed potatoes were interesting and asparagus was crispy and gorgeous.  Everyone was sharing their meals, the Red Grouper, Fried Chicken,Black Tiger Pad Thai and Hawaiian fried rice...but I wanted to be selfish and not share a bite of mine, ha-ha.  I did and enjoyed all the other samplings but this was, next to my first Peking Duck in Beijing, the best prepared duck I have ever had.\\n\\nThe only regret I had was the portions were so nice, and I ate everything I could, that had no room for desert. The deserts looked amazing and that will be a must next time I got.  Each bite of food, each infused drink, chat with Lola and service we received were an absolute delight. Prices were very reasonable for the portions and taste, so no problem there.

The artwork hanging around the walls, is so unique and creative. There is an outdoor seating space with a flower filled patio and a huge fireplace in the center.  There is a movie theater which seats about 300 people on big comfy couches called the theater bar, which appears to be a \\"drink and dine while you watch a movie\\" place.  There is an \\"honors bar\\" that features classical music, serves premium drinks and prohibits minors.  There is a very impressive multi-level bar, which used to be the boiler room and has a menu with pizza, calzones, etc.  There is a room called the Cyprus room which features reggae music, international rums and a full menu that even has some Caribbean dishes on it.

And the little, hot bread rolls super yummy. If you don't want steak, the fish and duck options look wonderful. The food is solid and tasy. It would be worth returning just on the food alone. \\n\\nThere were a few notable service issues. Everyone's dinner arrived, but mine was delayed a good 10 minutes and no one checked in with us and we had to ask someone to find it. It was a pricey filet that was a little on the cold side by the time it reached me. A super cute sauce bottle that accompanied someone's meal had a cracked and chipped glass lid that made us wonder whether there were glass shards in the bottle. The management of the restaurant came over, fixed all these problems appropriately.

Cement floors, no curtains, exposed walls, the decor was very interesting but did not absorb any noise.  We did not realized until we were leaving that there was music in the restaurant.\\n\\nAnd let's not talk about dessert.  Again, dessert is a fine art.  Veggies, do not make dessert.  If I decide to have dessert, often it is because I feel the need to indulge.  I have eaten my veggies and can have dessert.  I am not a huge dessert fan, but when I decide to indulge, it is because something sounds like a real delicacy.  When we declined, our server insisted that these desserts were decadent and worth the tasting.  This was among the most challenging dessert menu I have seen.  in simple terms, Beets were not meant for ice cream. Save your sweet tooth and pass on the desserts."},{"name":"Launderette","address":"2115 Holly St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"It's three stars for the food. But since service was pleasant and gracious I gave an extra star. For example our server explained that they had run out of wine chillers for our bottle of sparkling rose so he kept it inside the restaurant in ice and would constantly go back and forth to the patio to refill our glasses. Since we were sharing everything including appetizers he coursed it out so that one dish came out a time. He also brought out an extra appetizer to the table. And after a long meal, he assured us, even as one of the last tables, that there was no rush and that it was still an early night for him. Thanks for everything Monty.\\n\\nGreat vibe even on a Monday night. It wasn't too crowded that we had to wait for a table. We opted for outdoor seating since it was too noisy to the point we would have a hard time speaking to each other across the table. Even though it has been hot lately, the fans overhead made sitting outside bearable and a bottle of bubbles (Lucien Albrecht) made it quite enjoyable. I know it's a small detail but the size of the table for a two top was spacious and makes sharing much more comfortable. \\n\\n1. Red Snapper Crudo \\n2. Beef Tartare\\n3. Octopus\\n4. Allepo Prawns\\n5. Branzino\\n6. Apple Pie \\n7. Chocolate & Rye\\n8. Birthday Cake Ice Cream Sandwich\\n\\nIt's been about a week or two since I ate there, and I've come to realize that writing a review after time has passed shows me what really stood out, what I still remember. Looking at my list there are only two maybe three things that I can recall without checking the menu and those are: the Beef Tartare, Branzino and the Birthday Cake Ice Cream Sandwich. \\n\\nBeef tartare was very tasty served with a raw egg yolk and what I believe is fried taro root. I thought the whole Branzino was a steal, that's a lot of meat for only $28, other places you'd spend more than that on just the filet. The Birthday Cake Ice Cream Sandwich just brought me back to my childhood, very simple but also evoking a fond memory for me. \\n\\nThe rest of the food was good, it was okay. The reason for that is because if you've ever eaten at Apis Restaurant, octopus will never taste the same again, poached ruby red shrimp is greater than the prawns, and the hibiscus salt cured trout sashimi makes the red snapper crudo look bad. The desserts at Apis are better. They are also complex with several layers of flavor, but it just works better."},{"name":"Blue Dahlia Bistro","address":"1115 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Assortment of country French salads and tartines, well done, and decent service.

Has its own private lot, looks a little run down but hey that's not what you're reading for. This restaurant is actually not too bad. It even has its own full bar in the same vicinity. In this bar there is some video poker and also a pool table that you can utilize. There being a full bar they have plenty of hard liquors you can choose from and all they way down to their $1.50 happy hour beer.\\n\\nLocated on the other side is the actual restaurant. Walking in you probably don't even need the menu because they took pictures of their food and put it up on the wall so you know exactly what you'll be getting. This helps a lot when trying to order especially if you had a few too many drinks from the other side. Jokes aside, this was my first time here and I came in looked at the pictures and ordered the \\"Dinner A Special\\" which came with egg drop soup, fried rice, mushroom chicken, and also sweet and sour chicken, with sides of some fried wontons, spring rolls, and also some fried shrimp. All for 11.95! What a steal since I was bringing dinner for 4 I decided to get two orders of it togo.\\n\\nThe waitress told me to have a seat and the food would come out when its ready; I unfortunately had to use the restroom and made a huge mistake of going to this one... It reeked so bad that the smell could've been used in chemical warfare. It was like the toilet wasn't flushed for a million years. I hurried on out as fast as I opened that door.\\n\\nLuckily for me the food was already made by the time I made it back out to the dining area. It was even neatly packed together in a small cardboard box for me to take to my car. Got home and the food was great, didn't really have any complaints luckily!

There is also a large covered patio in the back.\\n\\nThe place can support large groups, but be warned that the setup isn't good for mingling.  As with many Western places, they tend to seat large groups as a long thin table, meaning you can't talk with anyone other than those beside or across from you.  For this reason, I suggest no more than 6-8 people.\\n\\nThe beer selection is pretty decent.  They have Fishbowl Fridays, which is $10 for a triple cocktail.  There are also $5 wheat beers from Whistler Brewing, which I did not hesitate in partaking.\\n\\nAs for the food, I had some penne pasta.  The portion was actually pretty good, with nice flakes of melted cheese and other goodness.\\n\\nDecent, and reasonably priced for a Western restaurant."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"After hearing all the hype (arguably Voodoo is the most widely known donut shop from Portland) it was time to see what it was all about.\\n\\nFree Parking is available in front of the store on weekends before 1100.\\n\\nService is friendly and very efficient.

I'm glad you're here! \\n\\nNo longer an insurmountable legal standard of review, now you can get breakfast, lunch, dinner, or cocktails on your way to and from the courthouse.\\n\\nWith American bistro fare (some asian offerings, like five spice shrimp and banh mi), sophisticated decor, and gorgeous bar, De Novo carries the downtown revival a little farther south down High Street. It's right by that big liquor store... the block isn't the nicest, but don't let that stop you! This would be a great place to go before or after a show at the Ohio Theater.\\n\\nMy four-star rating is accurate as I am currently quite a fan. But, this is based from one dining experience on the second day of being open to the public. I'll definitely be back (and in the meantime recommending this as a downtown suits-all-needs spot), and I reserve the right to add or subtract a star as De Novo's presence evolves. \\n\\nI popped in here after work when I had an hour to kill and a growling belly. This was a solo dining experience-- I was alone with my book. It was about 5:30 pm, and the restaurant was not very full. The hostess seated me in a booth of my very own, though I wouldn't have minded sitting at the bar.\\n\\nI really love the decor here. I would totally want whoever did this interior to do my house, if such a thing seemed financially plausible. High ornate ceilings, gorgeous lighting that feels a touch on the decadent side, and huge gray branches (branches!) hanging above the bar made for an elegant yet whimsical setting.\\n\\nOn trend with other restaurants of its kid, De Novo has a decent small plates happy hour. All small plates are half price from 3 to 7 on weekdays. I didn't hear about the beer specials, but I noticed they have Left Hand Milk Stout on draft, which is awesome. I was in the mood for wine, though, and select by-the-glass wines were on special. I can't remember now if they were half price or if they were $5 flat, but nevertheless... awesome.\\n\\nOverall the menu selections were a little on the *yawn* side. Sliders, crab cakes, braised short ribs... the kind of small plates you see everywhere. Besides the banh mi, the sandwiches seemed a little unimaginative, too... but I'll give them a pass for several reasons:\\n1. It's new, they may be trying to get some customer feedback before they branch out much more\\n2. Truffle fries come with sandwiches, and their other sides (seemingly interchangeable) look great too, risotto especially.\\n3. The dishes are plated *beautifully* and the flavor combinations are real winners.\\n\\nI ordered the house chop salad and the sliders. As stated above, I was thoroughly impressed with the plating. The sliders arrived, three to a plate, with the tops askew just so. Artistic, not sloppy. There was smoked gouda and carmelized shallots... not too much topping to meat/bun ratio. Some chives sprinkled the perimeter. The patties were a tad overcooked and the bun slightly over toasted, but that smoked gouda will get you quite far. \\n\\nThe chop salad was perfectly dressed, with an elegant drizzle of dressing around the outside edge of the plate. The bites were neither too big nor too small, just as a chop should be.\\n\\nThe service was friendly and attentive for the most part. In hindsight, I wished I'd had some water. I didn't ask for any, but the waiter never offered-- so I guess that's a tie. Overall the staff seems excited about the new venture, and it's always great to feel that energy.\\n\\nIt seemed to take a long time for my food to come out. I was a single diner, the restaurant was not busy, and my entire experience took about an hour. I only ordered two small plates and a glass of wine-- and it was just me. I didn't mind, as I was killing time anyways, but De Novo will have to step up the speed if they hope to cater to the courthouse crowd at lunchtime. \\n\\nI'll be back! \\nCan't wait to try breakfast!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Best donuts in town.

We also got drinks--he got the fresh-squeezed lemonade which was very good and I got a latte that was just the right amount of frothiness and also very good.

The location is great, the atmosphere is light and cheery but the food didn't leave any type of lasting impression. I take that back, it did, too much oil in the shellfish pan roast. I'll get to that. The warm popovers were delicious! We ordered a few starters; the deviled eggs, the pimento hush puppies, and the beef tartare. I cannot speak on the hush puppies because too much pimento cheese as a child has turned me off completely, but the deviled eggs and beef tartare were delicious. \\n\\nThe chicken was a hit with the two that ordered it, and two of us had the shellfish pan roast, and the remaining diner had the octopus and Brussels sprouts. I didn't try the octopus, although I should of, the Brussels were delicious! How can you go wrong with roasted sprouts and bacon? You can't.  \\n\\nThe shellfish pan roast was such a disappointment. The overwhelming amount of oil in my dish was shocking, my friend who also ordered the same meal had a lot but considerably less oil than I. My rice was swimming in oil. I ate everything above the oil line. Unless a business lunch requires I go back, I doubt I'll go back on my dime. I will say this, the popovers reach in and caress your soul. I will give them that."},{"name":"La Fiesta Mexican Restaurant","address":"1419 Virginia Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Service was a little bit off, but the food was great.

I've only been once, so I'll update since I'm sure I'll go again.\\n\\nService: Super friendly. We were tended to by one server, but a number of other folks helped out with coffee/water refills and bringing us our food. I like it when this happens, because it shows that folks aren't only working for themselves and their tips. The folks working there seemed to actually enjoy it. \\n\\nFood: Good! My friend and I got the grilled cheese and the garbanzo (faux chicken salad) sandwich, and split 'em. The grilled cheese was way too decadent, I'll never get it again. It was good. Just too much. If you like grilled cheese, though, get this. I would've preferred more herbs and less cheese and a whole wheat bread (I'm seriously not complaining about the item though, the thing I ordered was exactly what I got, I just wasn't thinking straight when I ordered it and tend to like healthier stuff). The garbanzo sandwich was delicious.\\nI drooled over some of the salads brought out to nearby tables. :) Looks delicious!\\n\\nCoffee: Great coffee, and you get one free refill afaik.\\n\\nAmbiance: Super nice atmosphere. We were seated outside, and we forgot that smoking was allowed out there, so that was a bit of a bummer for my friend (for whatever reason I don't care about smoke smell). The general crowd was a nice mix of (lotsa) hipster, young professionals, older folks, and others--I was really impressed that a vegetarian place appeals to such a lovely variety of people. \\n\\nGets really really crowded on weekends. I tried to go there a second time, and it was a 50 minute wait for a table. So we went somewhere else. I hope they open another location (maybe near my house?? hint hint!). I was in a hurry to go hiking that day, but on most days I'd be happy to wait for a table here.

Thanks!"},{"name":"BurgerFi","address":"1520 Avenue Pl, Ste B-140","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"BurgerFi's frozen custards are absolutely delicious and are what set this burger joint apart from others in the area. I am a sucker for plain old vanilla. Their vanilla concrete is delicious and comes with whipped cream on top. If you've never had frozen custard it is like a thicker creamier version of soft serve ice cream. They also have lots of mix-ins and toppings if you want to get a little crazy.\\n\\nThe burgers and fries here are also very good. The buns that their burgers come on are pretty thin and their burgers are doubles (unless you specify otherwise). This makes for a very juicy, meaty burger rather than a burger where all you taste is bread and toppings. The large fries here are huge - definitely more than enough for two or three people to share. BurgerFi has a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine instead of ordinary fountain drinks. I love the options these machines give...however I always end up going for something very out of the ordinary that tastes like it wasn't created for a reason. Fun to try, but maybe sticking to the tried and true soft drink flavors is the best course of action.\\n\\nI will definitely be back to BurgerFi.

The wait was about 30 minutes, so not as bad as some other reviewers.\\n\\nThe seating here is a little awkward and could be much more space efficient. My party was seated at this oddly large surfaced area-ed rectangular communal table along with 4 other already seated strangers. The divide of the table was weird and forced me to shout if I wanted to talk to my friends sitting across from me. They should replace the table with two skinnier tables--more seating and less awkward conversation--it would be a win-win.\\n\\nI ordered the regular kara miso ramen (at $11.75) which was served with 2 slices of pork belly. It tasted okay, but wasn't very spicy or otherwise flavorful.\\n\\nI also had a few bites of my friend's regular-sized shio tokusen toroniku ramen (at $14.25 or $14.75, can't remember exactly), which I will call a \\"deconstructed ramen.\\" It was ramen noodles served in Santouka's house shio broth with all the toppings served on the side. The toppings were 5 or 6 slices of pork cheek, scallions, wood ear, bamboo shoots, a slice of pink-swirl fish cake and a tiny pickled plum. As an FYI if you come here, if you are trying to decide between the kara miso broth and the shio broth, PICK THE SHIO. The shio broth was much more flavorful and tastier than the kara miso, I was actually quite disappointed with my broth choice of kara miso after having tasted the shio. For me, there was no noticeable difference in flavor between the pork belly and the pork cheek, although the cheekmay have been a smidge more tender.\\n\\nThe serving sizes I thought were okay. I showed up hungry and felt stuffed by the time I finished my regular sized ramen (i didn't even drink all the broth). I probably would opt for the small if I had to decide again to prevent from feeling like a stuffed piggy afterward as the food is quite heavy."},{"name":"Hooters","address":"425 W Riverside","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"The worst and the SLOWEST service EVER. We come in, get seated and we sat for literally 31 minutes before the waitress came over to take our drink orders. During that time multiple girls walked by and never once asked if we have been helped yet. Thought about walking out but figured we'd wait it out for the wings since it's been awhile. Finally our waitress comes over and takes our drink orders, she wasn't too friendly at all and took another 10 minutes to get our drinks to the table. As soon as she does we order an appetizer and our meals since we knew that would probably take at least an hour if we waited. Another 30 minutes goes by and we get our food. The appetizer didn't even come out first which was disappointing but at this point we were expecting this. We eat and finish and she didn't even ask if we wanted more drinks until after we finished our food. We get the check, pay and leave. Absolutely the worst and slowest service ever. We would've had a better experience going to McDonalds. Do not go to this location unless you are trying to kill time in which even if so you'll probably still be late because this location is so slow.

Then they still brought us the incorrect order.  While I was away my fiance ordered another drink for me and the waiter said \\"How am I supposed to remember what he ordered?\\" and left (he could have just checked his notepad).

I also thought it was a little snooty for them to call themselves a \\"bakery boutique.\\" Is that supposed to mean that they're better than a bakery?\\n\\nSo an occasion came when I couldn't go to Boston to get one of my favorite cakes for my good friend's birthday and had to pick a place in the town. I'd heard that Susu made their cakes fresh from scratch every day, so I gave them a call and ordered a buttermilk (white) cake with raspberry cream filling and vanilla buttercream on the outside. Although I was appalled that it cost a whopping $34 for an 8-inch cake, I figured that it had to be good.\\n\\nThat night when we cut the cake and ate it, I was disgusted to find out how dry the crumb was -- the cake was incredibly dense and dry, and I needed a lot of water just to get it down my throat. Not only that, but the vanilla buttercream was really grainy -- that's a BIG no-no when it comes to good buttercream, and I've had a lot of cakes and desserts before that didn't cost this much and were far superior in quality. \\n\\nNot only that, but when the person at the cash register rang up my order and I charged it, there was a line to TIP them for a cake! Why should I be obliged to tip for a cake?! I'm never coming back here again. A waste of (a lot!) of money.
