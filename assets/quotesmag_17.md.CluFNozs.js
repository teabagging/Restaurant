We were hungry and this place had tables. \\n\\nWe ordered some appetizers. Scallion pancakes, wonton soup and mini spring rolls. The mini spring rolls were super weird and contained some kind of baking spice. I didn't really understand it. The scallion pancakes were basic, done well enough and hit the spot.\\n\\nAt the same time we ordered our appetizers we also ordered our entrees. Halfway into eating the appetizers we got our bill. Our waitress just left it on the table without a word. Essentially telling us to pay for our meals before we even received half of them, and ten minutes after requesting a glass of water (a request that was fulfilled after asking twice).\\n\\nI was confused, figured that maybe this is just the way they did things and waited for our entrees.\\n\\nExcept after a few minutes, parties that ordered after us were receiving plates of food while we sat looking awkward at our table with a bill. After trying to get the attention of our waitress who had apparently disappeared to the back, I flagged down a waiter and told him we hadn't received our food. He went to grab our waitress who apologized and told us the food would be out in a few minutes.\\n\\nTen minutes later and I'm looking behind me to the kitchen. No one is cooking. The cooks are scratching their heads and laughing. All parties who ordered after us had received their food.\\n\\nI'm pissed at this point. I don't ask for much. I work in the service industry so I'm typically very forgiving about mistakes, but this experience was full of utter negligence on the part of the restaurant and I wasn't about to wait another ten minutes to find out the food order had never made it to the cooks.\\n\\nAll waiters (and there were about six of them) are off the floor so I go to the register. I tell them to charge me for the food we received and that I wasn't going to wait any longer. They didn't seem to understand what I was saying. No one apologized. Finally someone went ahead and printed me a new bill, but before showing it to me tried to grab for my credit card. Turns out they tried to charge me for two bubble teas when I only ordered one. So they had to print me a new bill. At this point I'm furious and it's taking everything in my normally well tempered self to hold back the vitriol I want to spew at these people.\\n\\nWhile waiting I read a bunch of the Yelp reviews about mandatory gratuity and the servers scamming people out of tips they didn't write in. So I scribbled out the entirety of the \\"tip\\" section on the receipt.

I am also not one to make reviews like this, but I also had to. I was frustrated.\\n\\nTLDR: Food was good/fair and the customer service was... meh. \\n\\nMe, my fianc√©, and a couple of friends decided to try a Korean place we've all never been to. We already have a couple of Korean places that we love, but we wanted to see what this restaurant had to offer. We had dinner around 8PM. They are one of those places that don't seat you until everyone else in the party gets there. That was kind of annoying, but I kind of understood where they were coming from so I let that go. \\n\\nWe each ordered our food and a drink. Everything went smoothy in the beginning, except for the fact they kept asking us if we were ready to order every 3 minutes or so. Then, when the food came out, two of the orders were completely wrong. So we sent them back because they each contained an ingredient that two of the people from the group didn't eat. We got our food back in a timely manner and it was fairly good. We thought, okay, maybe they just made a couple of mistakes. \\n\\nAfter that, other things went wrong like: they never refilled our water, they never checked in on us, they never asked us if we wanted another drink, and they never asked us for a box at the end. Honestly, they weren't even busy. \\n\\nWhen we got our checks, it was all wrong. They double-charged us and they tried fixing it. Then, they gave us the revised checks and they once again, double-charged us. I was so frustrated that I didn't even want to deal with asking for a box or even telling them they charged me an extra $15. We just wanted to get the hell out of there. \\n\\nI still tipped well (and so did everyone else) because like I said, I've worked in the service industry for years and I can't stand it when people don't tip at all for things like this. I understand if you're new or having a bad day, but goddamnit, this was a lot of mistakes for one four table top. Maybe, we'll all try this place again in the future.

It's served with beautifully braised mushrooms and robuchon style potatoes. The coq au vain sauce is purged at the table, so as not to make the fried chicken soggy. The sauce has an amazing amount of depth, and it's silky on the palette. We've also really enjoyed the steak frites and the fried trout. My father in law is incredibly particular about French restaurants after living in France, and he was so impressed by the end of the meal!

But I realize if you're reading this, you don't necessarily frequent this place. It's a very upfront, no-frills Mexican restaurant. It's not a fusion flavored place or fancy like other Mexican places that are perhaps near it.

Two of them fill me up just fine. I would choose the shrimp over the fish though, if you are choosing one. \\n\\nSometimes I get a burrito and again, it's pretty big and I can't eat all of it in one sitting. They have a lot of different options for burrito flavors and styles, and I'm pretty boring when it comes to my burrito tastes, so I'll just encourage you to try what sounds delicious to you.\\n\\nThey have a salsa bar that has some pretty tasty salsas. There's one that's really smoky that I'm not a fan of, but I bet if you are a smoky salsa person, you will love it.\\n\\nI think you can order online or on an app, so that seems to be something that they are promoting. They have really cheap margaritas at happy hour for only $2.50, but they seem pretty sweet to me with not a lot of alcohol, so I wouldn't really spend my money on that. I would definitely buy chips and salsa or guacamole over a $2.50 margarita. \\n\\nAlso, the people who work there are consistently very nice people.

If you are a 20 something and want a great selection of beers and a descent burger and could care less about service, this is your place. I work in the neighborhood and have been to this restaurant a couple of times. Their food quality is spotty and inconsistent and the further you get away from the things they do well at their other restaurant down the street (Publick House), the worse it gets. BECAUSE I work in the area, I wanted to give them another shot to see if they have improved. \\n\\nMy wife and I go in, the restaurant is only about a 1/3 full. It is 7:30 p.m. and we get seated at a 3 top beside the window (and it is cold outside, so you know what that means sitting next to the window). I ask for a booth further away from the window - there are at least 4 open in the section that we are in. The waitress tells me they are saved for larger parties that might show up. I point out the obvious, that it is 7:30 - the rush hour and there are plenty open. Listen, I have my choice of restaurants so I am not debating the point with her. I mention something to the male host on the way out, he could care less if we stay of go. \\n\\nHere is the bottom line, the Publick House has been successful (it seems) catering to 20 somethings with a great beer selection and good pub food, BUT service is not the reason you go to Publick House (just read their reviews). There is not enough business to have two identical restaurants down the street from each other. I think the intent of this restaurant was to go up market, but message to the owner, the bad service, great beer selection shtick goes only so far.

Do not trust them with your card. I've been here twice, food is fine and prices are reasonable, that's why I went back. Second time was mid September and upon checking my credit card statement, I noticed I was overcharged about $100. I called and an employee asked me to bring in the statement and she'd do her best since management was out of town. I brought in the statement and with time and date she found the receipt but it was the copy after they cashed out (not the original that I signed), which showed a bill of $104.70 (which was legit) and a tip of $119.70 (obviously way incorrect!). The employees agreed that $19.70 made more sense (although I have suspicions the entire number was falsified since I usually round out the change, so in this case would've ended it with 30 cents - unfortunately I didn't keep my receipt) and they called management - the result was that it had been too long to reverse the charge so after returning home in a couple days, manager would call the bank and have my card credited $100. They asked for my phone number so the manager could call me to follow up. Well, several days later, after the day they estimated the credit would be posted passed, and no call from manager or credit on my account, I called the restaurant and asked for a manager and was given very vague answers that they're not in, not sure when they'd be back next, don't know if they're out of town...at that point I just called my bank directly and disputed the charge instead of waiting on the restaurant to make it right, and am waiting on that to finalize. It's been over a week since I brought this to the restaurant's attention and still no follow up from them. I've worked in plenty of service/food service positions so I'm reasonable and give benefit of the doubt most of the time, but this situation is unacceptable. If it was an honest mistake I'd expect at least a follow up, and am thinking more and more it wasn't a mistake at all (management at the end of the shift really didn't think a tip of 100%+ was odd?).

These things happen so we made our selections and ordered up. I got a Greek style burger and my wife ordered a personal pizza.\\nStarting with the pizza, if this wasn't a doctored up frozen pizza (it was) it was an expert copy. I don't know what to say other than Yuck and pizza seems like something you should be able to make fresh. It was a chicken artichoke pizza; the toppings were also of the frozen variety.  \\nThe burger looked wonderful but turned out to be totally without flavor. I actually ended up taking the top off and covering it with catsup like a bad fast food burger. The fries were sort of reminiscent of what you get at Mcmenamins. \\nIn short, I hope they rethink their menu and return to the old recipes. I'll try back in a year or so."},{"name":"Jam On Hawthorne","address":"2239 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I love the food here!

We ordered a little bit of everything...pancakes, breakfast tacos, fruit, and toast.  Everything was very good.  It was the first time I had ever had a breakfast taco.

If it were up to the food alone, I would give you more stars. The biggest problem is that you never know what type of service you are going to get.

Higher prices need to come with higher level service. You won't succeed without it. Your happy hour is great, but it seems like you put it out there to make up for the poor reviews in regards to the service? Discounted prices don't make me feel any better about how inattentive your waiters are. On our most recent trip before an ACL Live taping we decided to eat in the bar area. The bartender is great, but the waitress assigned to us was really off. She was also dressed completely inappropriate. I don't care that it was the bar section, I don't need your very full chest in my face, and I also don't need to see your bra through your lace back shirt.

My daughter and I had a good meal here. I went to Jade Garden in spite of the bad reviews here on Yelp and was kind of surprised things went so wrong in the other reviews...Maybe I went on a good day.\\n\\nWe both had the combo specials for $9. Each of us had a tasty order of wonton soup. The wonton were fresh and firm, the broth was nicely flavored and there were bits of pork and scallions floating around. I also ordered beef on sticks as an appetizer. The beef had a nice BBQ reddish color to it with a distinct flavor. Nice thing was they came portioned for 6 instead of the 4 you get most places. My daughter's beef and broccoli was cooked perfectly. The Szechuan beef I ordered was sauced in a textbook style with the sauce cooked into the meat instead of dripping gooey sauce all over my plate.\\n\\nI would definitely come here again. I've visited a lot of Chinese food places over the course of my life and this it's far from the worst I've seen.\\n\\nFYI, my 9 year old inspected the bathrooms and reported they were absolutely clean. I pressed her to note anything out of place and she repeated the same opinion. The interior is a little dated but the China plates are quaint/appropriate. Our server appeared to be from NYC (her accent gave her away) and she handled things perfectly.

I love the cuisine from home, and it is hard to come by here in Orlando. I have been to this location several times, more times than I can remember, so this review is based on multiple visits. \\n\\nThe food: some of the food here is great, some of the food is good, and some of the food is just okay. I have tried several things on the menu here and there are a lot of items that are really awesome and others that could use improvement. I will compile a rough list of only the things I've eaten.\\n\\nThe great: My favorite here is the dirty rice; it is arguably some of the best I've ever eaten. I always get it with my meal. The 12 napkin roast beef po-boy is excellent and made just the way they do back home. The crawfish pie is excellent, as is the crawfish remoulade appetizer. I like the shrimp po-boy, but get it with remoulade sauce in lieu of mayo as they are quite heavy with the mayo; lastly the beignets are AMAZING. Best I have had outside of Cafe du Monde, and  I don't give that kind of compliment lightly.\\n\\nThe good: the crawfish and fried green tomatoes appetizer (or I'm sure po-boy also). It's a decent amount of food and listed as an appetizer, but I have actually had it for my meal; the crawfish etouffe is on the good list. It wasn't exactly seasoned correctly and a little overly tomato-ey, but overall a good dish; the fried pickles are good, not great. That's just to say they are no better/worse than any other restaurant with this offering, and I have had better in at least one place here in town.\\n\\nThe okay: the gumbo - I don't know what it is about the gumbo; it almost tastes like they've added some unknown seasoning in it that you don't find in the standard Louisiana recipes because it is the right consistency, so they are definitely using a roux, but the taste is....off. The jambalaya isn't right either. Once again it's as if they are using some kind of spice or herb that isn't in the recipes back home, maybe to put their signature touch on it. Piece of advice on that is, the recipes back home are perfect, no additional touches necessary. \\n\\nThe ambience there is a little over the top, but so is everything in NOLA, so it fits. I like reading the posters and showing my kids the parade ladders on the ceiling and telling them stories about growing up in New Orleans and all the special, unique things and experiences that can only be had there, and at Tibby's I even have visual aids to do it! \\n\\nThe service when they first opened was a little sketchy, but over the past year they have really worked on that, and it is much better than in the beginning. They try to please, and that is what counts most. \\n\\nOverall, I am a fan of this restaurant. We do eat here often (when we aren't going to our other favorite Cajun restaurant!) and the kids love putting remoulade sauce on everything they eat!"},{"name":"zpizza","address":"5701 W Slaughter Ln, Ste A160","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Absolutely the best Pizza in South Austin!\\nThere are so many yummy pizzas to chose from.\\nThey have great lunch specials, and they are reasonably priced!\\nI'd definitely recommend this pizza joint!"},{"name":"Fresh Kitchen","address":"851 N Alafaya Trl, Ste Q-01","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Our daughter is dairy and gluten free due to an allergy- we LOVE that she has options here!!

I rarely know of any restaurants that do this let alone a food cart, and usually when they claim this, it means they bought it from a distributor who in turns claims to have hand-pulled it. Not here. You literally see the chef rolling out the dough, with the flour, and hand pulling each batch fresh on the spot! In fact, that's her in the photo hand pulling the noodles. I'm super impressed how legit this is. I ordered the La Mien (beef soup noodles). Amazing execution and delivered quickly. Noodles were al dente, cooked to perfection. Each strand of noodle had the unique characteristics of hand-pulled noodles...some wide, some thin. Broth was on-point and well seasoned.

Supposedly, they should have a slight tug off the bone - but this isn't a competition, so they were delicious. As with the rest of the meat, it had a light smoke flavor, a touch light for my taste.\\n\\nThe Pulled Pork - Your basic, good, tasty Pulled Pork.  Once again, a light smoke flavor.  It was 'cued well, and I would gladly have it again.\\n\\nThe Brisket - It looked like we got a mix flat and point, so I was happy to grab the point before anyone else.  It was a well cooked brisket, and a good attempt outside of the Great Brisket State of Texas.  \\n\\nThe Chicken - The chicken was cooked well - still nice and juicy, with a decent skin.  Paired well with the plethora of sauces they offer.\\n\\nThe Sauces - I am from the school of thoughts that believes sauces can be a crime against nature.  If you have a good rub, and can run a pit, you don't need any sauce.  The closest you should ever get to a sauce should be a Carolina mop.  Disclaimer done.  The four sauces they offered were good, and complimented the meat well.  The spicy sauce and the vinegar based were the hits.  For the record, most of the meat did not need sauce to mask the flavor.\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed this joint.  I think this franchise did a great job.  I can only hope they don't over-expand, and crash like Corky's (and, according to some folks, Dreamland).  Definitely impressed by this solid 'cue joint in the middle of Ohio.\\n\\nCity 'Cue will get a generous Four Stars.  They are a solid Three Stars in Texas (and Ten Stars in Southern Mississippi - yick), so they get the Ohio Bonus of another star."},{"name":"Biryani Corner Indian Food Carryout Place","address":"1381 Bethel Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Ok guys.

Amazingly. \\n\\nThe rice, which so very many people have yet to perfect, is perfect here. Not mushy, not too sweet, and with a lovely sheen, it does the rest of the sushi justice. (Rice is the basis of all sushi, after all. Don't mess that noise up.) The sashimi is beautifully cut with many ocean-wise options available (only the brightest, wildest sockeye here, kids), and for the peeps looking for more ridiculous rolls (ie. Caterpillar, Popeye, Monster, et al), they offer a full \\"Craft Roll\\" section on the menu.

Extremely friendly and helpful service. \\n\\nThe food was fantastic here. For the most part, it's bar food, but you can't make better bar food than this. My wife and I had a burger and grilled cheese and we're both very impressed. The burger was phenomenal. First, some of the best bread I've had with a burger, delicious and perfectly toasted. Second, they actually cooked the meat to the right temperature. Usually places way over cook burgers, even if you ask for medium or medium rare. Here, they got it just right, still nice and pink and juicy in the center. The tenderness of the meat and the crunch of the toasted bun together were a fantastic combination. A side of garlic fries finished it off nicely. This wasn't some cheap garlic powder. This was loads of real crushed garlic that wasn't overwhelming with each bite, but at the end, you have a pleasant garlic taste left in your mouth. \\n\\nGood beer list. Ohio breweries are well represented, with some Jackie O's and Actual beers that aren't rare, but aren't the same old beers you find everywhere else. \\n\\nI live well within 270, but I'm still quite impressed with the increasing number of great options out in the burbs. This ranks right up there with101 Beer Kitchen as a can't-miss place for beer and food enthusiasts. Totally worth the drive to Powell for a great meal."},{"name":"Bubor Cha Cha","address":"45 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"We gave this new place a shot and it was an epic fail.\\n\\nOur party of 5 were excited to try out a new joint in Chinatown which was bright and looks nothing like other Asian restaurants in the area.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder but it feels like they couldn't settle for 1 theme so they painted the sky on the ceilings, had tiles on the columns, wooden rooftop things (somewhat like Penang), weird dangling lights which doesn't directly hang over any tables, tacky customized Bubor Cha Cha tables.  I did like the chairs where they painted it to look like it's bamboo.  However, I'm not one to question someone's taste in restaurant decor but more interested in the food.  The tables were also a little too tight in the middle so we just sat near the windows.\\n\\nThe menu design was pretty friendly...first couple pages with pics - friendly for those unfamiliar.  We ordered and was pleasantly surprised the first plate came out so fast.  We scarfed down the Pineapple Rice within minutes as it was a late dinner...taste was not bad but the shrimps were awful.  Definitely from frozen and not properly defrosted.  Mushy to the bite.  The Roti Teleur (sp?) came out next and the curry was not hot.  I asked for a knife from a waitress, she never brought it out.  Next came the Pineapple Beef.  Again, the taste was OK but portion was really small for an Asian restuarant and not worth the $13.  Pad Thai next...WORST Pad Thai ever.  Holy sht...I could have made crap like this at home myself!  The noodles were all soggy and broken up like it was scooped up in a big tray at a buffet.  The shrimp was equally bad...melts in your mouth but in a bad way.  The plate had no kick to it...pretty bland.  Next up, the Seafood Taro Bowl thing.  All Chinese restaurants know how to make this...so this place should have an idea right?  No, the taro was not a bowl...it was a ring around the seafood...portion was pathetic.  You guessed it...the shrimp was again mushy!  Chicken was blah in there.  Baby Corn, which is the saving grace for bad dishes for me, was not enough to pull it out of the dump.  Lastly, the Captain's Noodles was not bad.  Whew!  The chicken and pork had decent flavor with the big flat noodles.  Heavy on the greasy and MSG side but at least it tasted good.\\n\\nSo not only was the food nothing to brag about, the service was horrendous.  Honestly, new places take a while to smooth out the operations but not this place.  The food came out fast but that was it.  All the waiters/waitresses were sitting around the bar, hanging out like they were teens at a mall just chatting and laughing while our empty tea pot and water glasses ignored.  Not once did they look in our direction.  Only as we were wrapping up our dinner did some waiter that literally walked around to all tables asking \\"How was your dinner?\\"  We didn't want to waste our breath telling him it blows.  We flagged the only waiter running around doing something to wrap 1 dish up and get our check.  He gave us our doggie bag and then went to the cashier's area to hang out...totally forgetting us.  The manager guy standing around can see we're turning around looking for any waiters didn't do jack squat either.  We finally flagged another waitress to get out bill, promptly paid and get the heck out of this hell hole.\\n\\nLet's recap, the atmosphere was schizophrenic.  The food was bad.  The service was terrible.  A couple of plates were decent but we're not looking at a good ratio here.  The only reason why the restaurant is still so shiny and bright was because it's new.  Give it a few months and it'll lose it's novelty and luster.  The service is nonexistent while you grow increasingly frustrated since you see the whole wait staff hanging out at the bar.  I'd much rather return to Penang...places like this makes me wonder why I try new restaurants."},{"name":"Com Vietnamese Grill Restaurant","address":"4005 Buford Hwy NE, Ste E","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is great.

The oysters were really great and fresh and they have descriptions next to them so you know what kind of flavors to expect! I also got the hot buttered lobster roll and this was one of the best lobster rolls i've ever had. There was so much meat on it and I was so full from just half of it and the fries were also hot and matched very well with the roll. I am so happy I came here even though it is pretty expensive, I say everyone needs to come to North End and try it at least once!!!"},{"name":"Chago's Caribbean Cuisine","address":"7301 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The pulled pork dish (I don't remember what it is called) was amazing here!

The way the staffs over there treated you like you are owing them something. Rude and unacceptable. I came in a Saturday night. I already knew it would be crowded, so I had been waiting so patiently for 30 mins in the line. After that, I ordered a bowl of Pho. I continued waiting for 1 more hour. Other people came after me they already ate and finished their foods. I asked them, they told me to wait a bit more. Then there were 4 people came to the table next to me. After they sit down and ordered for only 10 mins. 4 bowls of Pho came to them. Then I asked the waiter where is my Pho. I have been waiting for 1 hour. He said: \\"Don't ask me, I am not the one who signed your bill. Go ask the one who signed your bill where is your Pho\\" and then he left. So rude. I was really crying immediately in the Pho place.

I recently took a trip to Boston and so many of my friends were recommending this place to me. I saw the $25 lobster roll on the menu and was like... shmeh. But people kept assuring me it was worth it, so I tried to grab a seat here... 3 times.\\n\\nFirst night was a Thursday. Following some advice on here, we figured we'd show up to put our name down on the list and settle for a late dinner (we're thinking maybe 9:30 or 10) since we were pretty full anyway. Decided to show up around 8:30 to put our name down and they were SOLD OUT for the night. I've never heard of a restaurant \\"selling out\\", but there ya go. It's ok, we have a few more nights so we'll just try again.\\n\\nThe next night, Friday night, we show up a little earlier, this time around 7:15. Surely we'll get a table for late dinner. Nope! The hostess said we could maybe get a table around 10:30 or 11, but no guarantees. Wha?! Jesus, this place is popular!\\n\\nFinally, Saturday night, we do it right. Showed up at 5:30 to put our name down, we're told the wait will be around 1.5 hours and they'd give us a call. Perfect. We head back to our place, take a little nap, and get a call about 2 hours later saying our table is ready. We showed up and were seated promptly, and service was great.\\n\\nNow, onto the FOOD (I feel like half the battle was just getting a seat around here). I must say, it was worth all that hassle because the food was amazing. Oysters were amazingly fresh. Also got the johnnycake which was like... how do I explain this.... heaven in your mouth. No kidding. The cake itself was so fluffy and crispy and buttery, and the creaminess and saltiness of the caviar and trout tartare complemented it perfectly. \\n\\nAnd of course, we had to get the hot lobster roll. SO delicious. Lobster was perfectly cooked, plump and juicy with a little chew to it, on a perfectly buttered bun and crispy fries. It was amazing. I will have dreams about this lobster roll, it was so good. I wanted to order more, but we were pretty full after that. I bet anything here would be amazing though. And the bill wasn't too bad either.\\n\\nI'm only taking off a star because it is so hard to get a seat here. I understand that's just how it is, but if you're from out of town and aren't expecting that (since most restaurants aren't that way), it can be really frustrating (ran into several frustrated and angry out-of-towners hoping to get a seat here). At some point you either have to a) expand or b) change your system, but I guess it'll happen if it makes sense and is what's best for the restaurant. So overall, definitely worth the wait, but the wait issue should eventually be alleviated somehow."},{"name":"Paddlefish Restaurant","address":"1670 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Went for Mother's Day 2018 with my mom!

They also package up day old pastries (2-3 in a package) or a dozen+ day old rolls for $3.  The bread is really dense, like When Pigs Fly, and they have funky flavors too.  And, much cheaper than the same caliber bread that Whole Foods sells. I'm sure they day old breads were still than anything I could get at Stop & Shop or Whole Foods.\\n\\nToday, i treated myself to a \\"Melting Cloud\\" which is a HUGE meringue-cookie with almonds baked it.  It was only $1.25 and is absolutely amazing.  It's what prompted me to write this glowing review.\\n\\nThe lines are long in the morning, but it moved much quicker than I anticipated.

I began with those in closest proximity and was blown away by the Toledo Museum of Art. By the time I made it down to Columbus, (the state's capital, might I remind you,) I was expecting big, big things. I was giddy with the eyes of a child as I ran up the glass-stone mosaic steps that led to the indoor ticket counter. I handed over my admission money and regrettably passed up the chance to pay more to see the Degas exhibit that was going on at the time. Hey, who can blame me? I was already living off Ramen noodles and Saltine crackers. And I think it's bull that they charge to extra to see select parts of the museum. PS, they don't have a discounted student ticket price.\\n\\nI started at the top and worked my way down. I went through gallery after quaint gallery wondering where they were hiding all their good stuff. I snuck a peek around the corner of the Degas exhibit and caught the tiniest glimpse of one of his ballerina statues, but I was quickly caught shooed away. Onto more boring galleries. There was some awful, awful found art, a bunch of dreary oils and acrylics. Pretty much no surreal art. Oh, and the docents kept so close that I felt like a trespasser. \\n\\nDownstairs I found a few small, stuffy galleries with uninspiring art and a hands-on children's area. I doubt any kids were captivated by it. It was mainly push this lever, pull this string, look through this hole, draw your own picture.\\n\\nThere were a few things I really did like. I was happy to see a some Monets including Weeping Willow, also Hopper's Morning Sun and a fantastic Chihuly sculpture. I discovered Kehinde Wiley on this trip; his work is superb. Of course there are a bunch of Bellows at CMA too, Columbus being his home town and all. Truth be told, I'm not a huge Bellows fan.\\n\\nBack near the admission booth, there was this amazing layered photo. It was of a bunch of different skies - Spain, Australia, the US. The clouds were all wispy and colorful. There were, I think, eight suns in the photo. It was so unique. I kick myself all the time for not taking note of the artist's name.\\n\\nI spent most of my time in the hall looking at photos of Ernie, a cat that photographer Tony Mendoza became a bit obsessed with. Those black and white photos were gorgeous. They made that cat seem like a humorous, ponderous character. This was definitely the best part of my trip. I even ordered a used Ernie book once I got home to gift to a friend. There was no way I was going to purchase it in the gallery's gift shop. Everything there was so expensive. The CMA has some excellent books, but I didn't give the knick knacks and whatnots they had a second look.\\n\\nWhile at the museum, I also had an incredulously overpriced lunch. My only options were deli sandwiches or deli sandwiches. Each sandwich was named after an artist. I ate the Van Gogh with a side of baked veggie chips. Throughout the dull meal, I wondered if Van Gogh would have actually chosen this sandwich himself, if he even liked peppercorn turkey and spicy brown mustard.\\n\\nReally, what the hell is going on here? Maybe they just don't have enough funding. Columbus has so much great art everywhere except at its official museum! As a supporter of Columbus' art scene, I am almost insulted by this pitiful collection. I want to kidnap tourists as they mount those mosaic steps and whisk them away to the true art scenes in the city. I want to grab the CMA by the shoulders and shake it until it wakes up, recognizes the lackluster quality of its collection, and begins a true search for great art to keep the few great pieces it already has company."},{"name":"Fratelli","address":"1230 Nw Hoyt St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Phenomenal Menu with a wonderful staff.

On what was supposed to be a low-key Friday night, we sat at the back bar and had a couple drinks each. Our bartender was perfectly pleasant but our experience was ruined by the brutish, unprofessional employees we encountered as we tried to leave. I get that this place gets a little crazy on a weekend night after dinner service but never have I ever been spoken to so rudely by restaurant/bar employees nor did I ever in my several years of experience working in bars and restaurants encounter a manager who allowed customers to be spoken to that way. \\n\\nAfter being asked gruffly to move from a spot we recognized was not a great choice on our part, we moved without comment to an opening a couple feet away so we could zip our coats and check that we had everything. We had only stopped for a second when a bouncer approached, telling us in the nastiest possible tone that we must move immediately from a spot that seemed pretty harmless. Shocked by the aggressive way he was speaking to us, we tried to calmly tell him that we were just zipping our coats and were leaving. However, this power-tripping jerk refused to just let us go and leave it at that. He repeatedly restated his coarse directives in increasingly rude and hostile ways - it was a seriously aggressive verbal assault. Our only responses were repeatedly saying that we were leaving but that didn't deter him from continuing to berate us. We were upset and angered by his patronizing bullshit and  tried to brush him off with a \\"we got it\\". I nearly lost it but held my tongue when he punctuated the whole ordeal with a \\"keep it moving!\\" after we were clearly already en route to the door. \\n\\nWe were horrified and shaken by that encounter, but since it was cold outside we decided to wait just inside the door for our uber that was already on the way. Imagine our surprise when we were approached by a manager who told us that he heard we were being \\"rude to the staff\\" and asked us leave. WE WERE ALREADY LEAVING. Petty is the kindest way to describe that, unprofessional and completely unbecoming of a service industry manager were more like it. We stood there and looked at him for a second hoping he was joking but he was completely serious. My sister calmly explained the situation to him in a diplomatic tone but after her quick summary of how we were treated he AGAIN asked that we wait outside for our cab. We were all BEYOND insulted and will never patronize this establishment ever again.

Our server brought one of the tea pots about 30 minutes after we ordered it and told us \\"it might be a little strong\\".  Really?  It was ruined!  For a place that serves high tea every week, it should be common sense and not even attempt to serve it.  The finger sandwiches had good flavor, but the bread was soggy on a few of them.

The food was amazing, and if I had a kitchen to bring it home to, half of it would have left with me, the portion was so enormous. My husband got Brian's Hash, and was equally pleased.

Not a great place for a vegetarian, however - the only real option is a batter fried eggplant slice or a rather bland version of a spinach salad. Also they need to change their oil more often -- sometimes the fries (white and/or sweet potato) are brown and taste like old oil.  Warning: impossible to have a healthy vegetarian meal here. If you eat meat you can have chicken or shrimp over a salad. The only veggie side dishes are french fried potatoes.

The busy lounge with a great view, Happy Hour and a cool vibe \\n2. The dining room also with a great view but with mediocre food \\n\\nMy wife and I spent a long weekend in Portland and I had reserved a table for our Saturday night dinner on 2011-05-21. We had just survived the Rapture or whatever catastrophe some nutbars had predicted for that day. \\n\\nThe location is the best feature. It is on the top floor of one the tallest buildings in Portland. There are views in all directions and we were treated to a stunning sunset. We arrived early to take in some of the action in the lounge. I must say that this is one of the best lounge experiences that I have had. Did I mention the view? They also have a piano player and piano bar. \\n\\nWhen it was time for dinner the hostess came to take us to our table. They did not make us settle our bar tab and just charged our drinks to our dinner tab. I hate it when places make you pay-up in the bar before you go to your table. We got the window table that I had asked for. It was on the east side of the dining room with views of the Willamette River and the downtown core. The sun started setting and did I mention the view? \\n\\nI had studied the menu before and I knew what I would order. I had the Tenderloin/Salmon combo and my wife had the grilled centre cut pork chop. My food was mediocre at best. The Tenderloin was not TENDER Loin. It was tough and gamy tasting. The KEG would have done a better job. The steak was also tiny and it was way overcooked (medium when I ordered rare). The salmon was OK. The accompanying vegetables were a mushy sloppy mess. Overall it was a disappointment for the price. At least my wife liked her pork chop and she was impressed with the location enough that I may have gotten some action back in the hotel. \\n\\nI would return but only to the lounge for drinks and Happy Hour appetizers. I hope I remembered to mention the view? \\n\\nOH yeah - when we left there was a drunk chick in the elevator with us. She was going to the lobby and then out for a smoke but like I said, she was drunk, and she tried to walk through a glass door in the lobby. She really pounded into that glass but she was OK."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"5920 Roswell Rd, Ste B101","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"2","text":"Stale chips.

As recommended by our waiter, we ordered the swordfish and grouper. While we were eating our appetizers, the waiter informed us that both their signature dishes had run out. I was extremely upset. Rather than informing us that they had ran out of the fish while we were ordering, we ended up finding this out in the middle of the meal.  We ordered something else that took more than half an hour to come. Although the server offered us free desert, I had completely lost my appetite at the time and left unsatisfied.  I have never gone to a steakhouse and not been able to eat steak. I was very dissatisfied that they did not have enough of either dish, especially since both were featured. It was also extremely disappointing that the restaurant did not take the courtesy to inform the guests much earlier that they were not able to serve what was on the menu in advance.

My boyfriend and I decided this would be our first place to go to. Word of advice: go early! When we arrived there was a little line but the moment I turned around as we were walking in the line was around the corner. There is a counter you have to order at before sitting down. There is a bunch of menus outside the door where you can read the different items and then a larger one when you walk in. \\n\\nWe ordered The Reggie (fried chicken, bacon & cheese topped with gravy), The McIsley (fried chicken with pickles, mustard and Bee Local Honey) and hashbrowns. Once we ordered we chose where we wanted to sit. There was the option of sitting inside or out. We chose outside. Do not worry the outside was completely covered with heaters. We were lucky and had sunshine the whole time we were there. Our food arrived quickly and the servers were all very nice. The portions did not look big at first but I'm telling you, that sandwich beat me. We ended up packing everything. The biscuits were so fluffy and buttery it just melts into your mouth. The chicken was juicy but the outside was crispy. The pickles were sweet due to the honey but there was a slight kick due to the mustard. Overall, the dish was excellent and I never thought of a biscuit sandwich being so good. The gravy was out of this world. I can not even put into words the taste of it. It was smooth but full of flavors and I kept reaching over to scrape it off of my boyfriend's plate to put on my biscuit. The hash browns were perfectly brown on the top and soft on the inside. The spices blended well and it was just enough salt that you did not need any supplementary condiments. \\n\\nOverall this place was delicious. Definitely a good idea to come here first to start our vacation. Be aware of the parking. It is all street parking so be opened to looking around the neighborhood and be okay with walking a few steps. Honestly it was nice to look around the street before coming here."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"My friend and I stood outside Neptune Oyster waiting for them to open at 11:30 am on a Friday, and it was sure worth it.

However, I ranked their meat and rice low compared to other places. The rice was good, fresh, and plump. But I didn't really like the meat. Instead of cubes, it was thin strips.

Please note that I came here back in May and therefore, my memories of the ambiance and taste may be a bit fuzzy - that, or because I did get relatively tipsy during the happy hour. That said, this review is solely for their happy hour menu.\\n\\nOne day, three friend and I randomly decided to book fights to Portland during Memorial Day weekend with some girl friends. This was a great decision. On the second night we were in Portlandia, we came to Portland City Grill based on Yelp recommendations and raves about the city view. Again, another fantastic decision. The happy hour bites ranged (I think?) from $4-$10 or something. I remember ordering the fries (which came with a BOMB aioli), mini spicy sushi rolls, this basil chicken dish, salmon cakes, and there must have been more but I forgot. The fries were definitely my favorite and I'm salivating just thinking about the aioli! They were herby, salty, and had a kick of spice from the hot pepper flakes. We had two (maybe 3) orders of this and STILL didn't feel gross afterwards! I am thinking they were either lightly fried or baked.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I don't remember which cocktail I got so that must have just been decent. If you're looking for a good buzz, I would recommend just getting a bottle of the house wine though. A friend and I got glasses of house wine in between and realized it would have been much cheaper to just get it by the bottle.\\n\\nWine and dine aside, the BEST part of this happy hour was the pianist.

There were these cool tempura vegetable things that came along as sides. I took a bite of my burger, and was flabbergasted. This wasn't fish, this was fantastic!

We decided to try it out and it did not disappoint. Excellent service, and quality food. We are not able to tolerate very spicy food, ironic that we like Thai cuisine. They were very accommodating and their food had flavor without burning our palates. The chicken satay was excellent, juicy and tender unlike so many dried out satays we have had. The Pad Thai was excellent. My wife loved her drunken noodles. The Tom Kai soup was really good as well. I definitely recommend this restaurant."},{"name":"Cheese Bar","address":"6031 SE Belmont","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Okay. Print this review. I'll wait.\\n\\nThank you. Now proceed to the nearest Trimet bus stop/MAX station, or get your friend/mom/boss/neighbor to drive you to Cheese Bar, and read this review on the way.\\n\\nWe visited on a Saturday night, and almost all the tables were full, yet it was pretty quiet. We ordered the cheese plate, the salami plate, the tuna sandwich (melt), and the blue cheese/apple salad. My husband was excited about the beer list: extensive tap and bottle menu, all different. They let him taste, and he chose the O-dark CDA and then later the Double Barrel Ale.\\n\\nThe food was tremendous. The cheese plate had the perfect amount, the chutney which came with it was excellent, and our waiter was nice enough to bring us some extra crostini. My husband said the salami plate was excellent -- really, how can you lose with Olympic Provisions?\\n\\nThe tuna sandwich almost made me cry -- an excellent cheddar, melted to perfection with the albacore, and the sweet relish/garlic mayo combo is just, well.... I'm speechless.\\n\\nThe salad was great -- nice-sized chunks of bleu cheese, candied walnuts that weren't slathered in sugar, but had the right amount of crunchy/ sweet, and thinly-sliced apples. The only beef I have with this salad is the use of frisee lettuce -- but that's a personal dislike. I feel  eating frisee is kinda like eating dental floss. Plenty of other greens to make this delicious.\\n\\nThen. There was dessert. My husband spotted it on the chalkboard: bread pudding with cherries, chocolate, and salted caramel drizzled over the top. Holy mother of god.... SO good.\\n\\nI love the relaxed atmosphere, the varied menu, and the tempting array of relishes, meats, cheeses, vinegars, crackers, and chocolate that you can take home, not to mention the meat and cheese deli cases.\\n\\nThank you, Cheese Bar.

The ice cream alone could drive them higher, but I think a strong 3 stars is about all I can award.\\n\\nMy wife and I ordered the standard Margherita and the Meatball/Red Onion pizzas, which were each 12 inches and baked in a wood-fired hearth oven. The crusts were thick and soft, but I found the toppings a bit meager. The sauce was mild and lacking seasoning.\\n\\nI liked the taste of the Meatball pizza, with the red onion popping and the sausage-like meatballs delivering a savory edge. However, the Margherita pizza was bland with only the taste of basil coming through. The sauce and cheese were visual accompaniments only and did not provide much interest for the palate.\\n\\nLovely's atmosphere is cozy but vibrant and it simply screams PORTLAND!! The clientele was a mix of professionals, hipsters, locals, adults with kids and couples on dates. The seating is tight and limited, but the quoted wait times only averaged between 20 and 30 minutes for the people waiting at the door. Kudos to the staff for offering cell phone calls to people who decide to walk around instead of wait on site.\\n\\nTheir beer and wine selection is small, but quality. The ice cream and sorbet are great and many people come in just for treats...especially in the summer months. We found the service to be above average, though we did hear the people next to us complaining about some long waits in between server visits.\\n\\nNote: The place is quite warm due to the pizza oven, so you might want to dress in layers.\\n\\nIf you are in Mississippi neighborhood of NE Portland, I suggest you check out Lovely's Fifty-Fifty. The pizza is good and the ice cream is excellent. Overall, it is a decent place to grab a meal."},{"name":"Gaslight Lynnfield","address":"1100 Market St","city":"Lynnfield","stars":"3.5","text":"Went for lunch on this beautiful Saturday.

I ordered the prime rib burger and when it finally came to the table it looked like a slider!  I asked for it to be cooked medium and it was overdone.  There was some sort of red relish on the top but that was it.  There were shoestring fries thrown on the side next to the burger.  My son even lifted the bun to my burger and said that's it????  Then it came time for the bill.  It was delivered and then I gave them my credit card which was not to be seen again for another 15-20 mins.

After paying I went back inside to use the restroom and lo and behold the soap dispenser didn't work.  Perfect, nice touch for the horrible service.  I asked to speak to the manager and asked her why it took 20 minutes to process my bill and the answer was that there was a problem with the machine.

Given the positive yelp reviews, we opted for the Classic Cafe. When we walked in, a table was quickly cleared for us. Nice! The menus were extremely dirty and worn, which was probably an indication of things to come....\\nWhile their menu was extensive, I opted for some eggs over-easy, rye toast, sausage and hash browns and my guy got the Southern breakfast plate. \\nAfter about 5 minutes, we were brought a plate of toast. You know it is bad when the person serving the toast drops it on your table and says \\"Is this too burnt for you?\\" The top pieces of toast looked ok, and I hate to be the person to send things back so we kept it.  The toast ended up being inedible, with the bottom pieces being completely charred on both sides. \\nAs for the eggs, they were not cooked through properly and while the yolks were runny as I had ordered, so was the majority of the whites of the eggs. Gooey, clear whites on an egg? No thanks. My man's eggs were also not cooked properly and his beans served with the Southern plate were ice cold, same as my hash browns. Breakfast is a relatively easy meal to cook up and when half is undercooked/cold and the other is charred beyond belief, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. The only saving graces were the sausages which were delicious and the cheap price.

So, on an evening out with some out of town friends, we discovered our first choice was full (not making a reservation on a Friday night, even at 9 pm in Burnaby, was a mistake)... so we called Earl's (using my Yelp app) to see if they could seat 6 of us in 10 minutes, and they said \\"No problem. Inside or patio?\\"  Patio, please!\\n\\nOur waitress was very nice and attentive, and despite a couple silly things, was overall good.  And not that inappropriately dressed.  She even brought my friend a free piece of cheese cake for her birthday after I inquired about whether they would do that or not.  She was new and wasn't sure, but said she would check and what dessert would my friend prefer?  Sure enough, a piece of cheesecake was brought out with the two sticky toffee puddings a couple of us had also ordered.  \\n\\nThe food was good and the sticky toffee pudding was fantastic.

I would give it zero stars if I could. \\n\\nI'll start with the good:\\n1.  We were seated much sooner than we were told. Only waited 10-15 minutes when we were told it would be 30-40. \\n2.  We ordered 3 drinks at the bar while we waited, which we ended up getting for free. The bartender never asked for a card or cash, and when we were seated sooner than expected, we tried to flag him down to pay, but he never came over, so we brought the drinks to our table, told the waitress we hadn't paid yet, and asked if she could add them to our tab. She just shrugged, said it was the bartender's mistake, and said \\"happy new year, I guess.\\"\\n3.  The hostess and management were extremely responsive and apologetic after all that had gone wrong (see below) and ultimately comped our meal. \\n\\nNow, the bad:\\nThe bloody mary's tasted like shrimp cocktail. The bartender served them to us, saying \\"they don't look pretty but they'll do the trick.\\" They were served with no garnish, minimal alcohol, and tasted like shrimp cocktail. That aside, Things seemed to be off to a good start, with the free drinks and all, and our waitress promptly came to our table and took our order for another round, which came quickly. When she came back, we ordered our food: a goat cheese appetizer, two breakfast pizzas, and an omelette. Next time we saw her, we ordered another round of drinks: a Magner's and a Guinness. 20 minutes later, no drinks had arrived, so we flagged down our waitress to ask her for them, to which she responded that they were totally out of Guinness. So my friend ordered champagne instead and my other friend was still waiting on his Magner's. 20 more minutes goes by, and still no drinks and we have yet to receive our appetizer. We flagged our waitress down again and asked about the food and drinks, to which she replied they would be out momentarily. Te appetizer came shortly after, but still no drinks. We begin to notice that all the people around us have gotten their food, even though they were seated after us. Finally, after an hour of waiting, I approached the hostess to ask what the problem was, as we had been waiting over an hour for our food and over 20 minutes for our most recent round of drinks, while we watched our neighboring tables get served ahead of us. The hostess apologized and sent a manager over, who handled it nicely and assured us our food was on its way. Shortly after, we received our food. One pizza was done right, one was cold, and my ham and cheese omelette came with a slice of deli meat as the ham. We sent the cold pizza back, and got a new one that was overcooked. \\n\\nOverall, this was by far the worst service I've ever had at any restaurant. The good was decent, but not good enough to excuse the abysmal service. Looking for breakfast in southie? Many other places to go. Even the Dunkin Donuts up the street is better than the Lincoln."},{"name":"Lincoln Tavern and Restaurant","address":"425 W Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Poor service.

My overall impression is that it was good, but maybe because my expectations were so high, it wasn't quite as good as I thought it would be. I actually liked another breakfast biscuit spot I went to in Salt Lake City called Sweet Biscuits and Limeade more.\\n\\nMy friend and I got in line around 11:10 on a Saturday morning. The line was dauntingly long and we debated whether to try coming back earlier the next day, but we decided to stick it out. I'm glad we did, since the line moves fairly quickly. We were already at the door to the restaurant within 30 minutes and placed our order at the counter after 40 minutes. \\n\\nThe way it works here is you order first and then find your own spot. I was super paranoid they would run out of seating, but I noticed people were eating quickly and also leaving quickly, so the seats turn over at a fairly fast rate. There's some seating inside, but they also have a nice covered patio outside with heat lamps with plenty of benches.\\n\\nI love that you can either pick one of their specialty biscuit sandwiches or build your own. In addition to biscuit sandwiches, they also offer other random items such as shrimp and grits, chicken pot pie, and corndogs, if not everyone is your group is feeling the biscuit sandwiches.\\n\\nI went with the Reggie Deluxe ($10.50), which is a biscuit sandwich with fried chicken, bacon, cheese, and an egg topped with your choice of either sausage or shiitake mushroom gravy. I ordered an extra side of mushroom gravy since I read on Yelp that they don't give you enough gravy. We also shared hash ups ($7), i.e. hash browns topped with grilled onions and mushrooms (I asked for no cheese).\\n\\nThe food comes out extremely quickly after you order. We didn't even have to wait 10 minutes. I loved my Reggie Deluxe and thought all the flavors went well together except for the fact that 1) I did indeed run out of sausage gravy about 2/3 of the way through, and 2) the fried chicken was indistinguishable in every bite. It was a little bland and the breading wasn't crispy at all, so overall I had a hard time tasting it in my biscuit sandwich. \\n\\nWhen I ran out of sausage gravy, I switched over to my side of shiitake mushroom gravy, but didn't like it that much as it was way too buttery for my tastes. The sausage gravy is definitely the way to go. The hash ups were nice and crispy, but I was so full from my Reggie Deluxe that I couldn't eat more than a couple bites of it.\\n\\nI can definitely understand the hype around this place, but for me Sweet Biscuits in SLC will always have a special place in my heart for having the best fried chicken + bacon + fried egg + gravy biscuit sandwich.\\n\\nThey also serve beer and cocktails if you're looking to get your drink on!\\n\\nParking in the area was pretty easy. My friend was able to find a spot right across the street, and we passed by plenty of empty spots within 2-3 blocks away."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"We stopped by to get lunch on a Friday around 1:30pm.

On my visit, a 1.5 hr wait turned into 45 minutes, which was just enough time to explore the area and pick up some cannolis for dessert.\\n\\nYou order the oysters off a menu card you fill out, which includes oysters from various parts of the east coast as well as other items such as clams.  All the oysters we ordered were very fresh and delicious, but my favorite part of the meal was the Hot Lobster Roll.  Freakin amazing!  They do it different than the cold mayo based lobster rolls you find at other places.  There's starts off with a toasted buttered roll, filled with huge chunks of fresh sweet lobster, served hot and doused in butter.  So simple, but totally worth the wait.\\n\\nBoston has plenty of good choices for oysters and lobster rolls, but go to Neptune Oyster and you won't regret it!"},{"name":"FoMu","address":"481 Cambridge St","city":"Allston","stars":"4.5","text":"I've read in multiple places that this is one of the best ice cream shops in Boston and the greater Boston area; however, I didn't find it amazing. I feel like it's just the hype. The ice cream is different than the traditional ice cream texture due to the ice cream being made from coconut milk, resulting in a thicker, creamy texture. I got two scoops: one scoop of espresso and one scoop of the bourbon maple walnut. You could really taste the bourbon whiskey in the ice cream, and the espresso definitely had a kick. However, this was definitely on the pricier side. I went on a Sunday afternoon, and there was no one here. The employees were very nice. They said verbatim, \\"Try as many flavors as you want. Don't feel bad about asking!\\" I thought this was very courteous on her part.

Didn't enjoy the clam chowder because it lacked flavor and I'm used to the thicker clam chowder. First time seeing a watery chowder. The chowder had way too much pepper as well.

It is located on Edgewood Ave, pretty close to Krogg Street Market. The parking is kind of awful, only about 3 spots dedicated to the shop itself, but you can usually find free street parking on the side street directly beside it. The baristas in my experience have been very helpful to a budding coffee drinker like myself in helping to pick a coffee that would fit my palate.\\n\\nThe interior is great for studying, lots of room to set up a laptop, lots of electrical sockets, and the music isn't too loud in my experience. The grey industrial vibe was great in my opinion, a great place to go on a cold and rainy day. The attached store is a nice place to peruse when waiting for your coffee, it has a bunch of great Atlanta themed apparel and paraphernalia which is a bit expensive.\\n\\nI had the pourover coffee (I don't remember which blend) and it was very good! The coffee took a bit of time to come out, but that is expected with a pourover coffee. It was a very good dark roast with hints of nuts and chocolate and it was perfect to warm me up on the cold rainy day that I visited. The portion size was large, it came in a normal sized coffee cup with a refill in a 400mL beaker. All of this came on a wooden board, making it great to photograph and send to all of your Snapchat friends. My only complaint was that I felt that it was a bit expensive.\\n\\nOverall, I liked Chrome Yellow and I am glad that I visited once, but I prefer places with a bit of a lower price tag and better parking.

Legend has it that I once ate dinner here at the restaurant but every other time I've been in the bar area.  It's much cheaper to do that.  The first time I was here was on a crowded Friday where everyone was trying to get a table, or trying to take pics of themselves (surely to post online) in front of the windows by others that actually had a table. Annoying, yes, but it's also amusing to see how badly these peeps want pics that they just interrupt and intrude on those that are trying to chill in their spot.  The window view areas aren't the only tables heavily sought after though, as at this HH you'll see youngins that just finished class at PSU battling it out for a spot with geezers that just finished watching a Golden Girls marathon.\\n\\nAs for the menu, they have a good variety of appetizers and drinks to choose from.  I've sampled many appetizers and can't remember them all, but I always get the kung pao calamari for sure.  I've never had anything like it elsewhere, it's not what you think of as calamari, but if you're into anything kung pao go for this.  Others always end up eating it when I get it, despite it not being something they initially cared about when looking at the menu.  Even if I go here for lunch in the middle of the week on a quiet day, I still order the appetizers.  Really, just order any of them.

My friend and I both ordered our top two favorites a few weeks back and both were delightful. She had the sheep cheese gnocchi that was just the right combination of flavors and not too heavy for  a lunch. I had the chickpea crepes.

This is a place that I go to about once a month and usually have decent service and food.  The service has never been spectacular but always decent.  Yesterday it was downright horrible.  \\n\\nIt took between 10 to 12 minutes for anyone to even stop by our table to see what kind of drinks we wanted. I actually had to make eye-contact with a waitress to get her to stop by; otherwise we would've waited longer.  A couple that came in after us had chips,salsa, and drinks before us and they came in about 4 minutes after us.  Two separate waiters came to explain that there was confusion about who was serving the area, so I thought everything would be okay from there on out.  \\n\\nThis is small, but we received a massive bowl of chips (WAY too big for two people and a waste of food) and a paltry amount of salsa.\\n\\nAfter the confusion of the waitstaff, we received our food promptly but noticed that our vegetable fajitas were not sizzling hot.  Every single time that we've ordered them, they came to our table sizzling,crackling hot.  This time they were not.  I even held my hand over them to make sure they weren't cold.  They weren't; they were still warm, but wondering how long they sat in the back before being served to us.  \\n\\nWe got the vegetarian burrito and fajita.  The food was good but after we ran through the three tortillas, I asked another employee - not our waiter - for more, and he told me it would be an extra charge.  An extra charge for one or two tortillas?  I passed on that.  \\n\\nThis entire time our waiter did not stop by our table one single time, aside from taking our initial order.  We had to flag down someone else to ask about the tortillas and that was just about the final straw.  The restaurant was not that busy so I'm not quite sure what was going on.  \\n\\nI will certainly not be going back anytime soon...if ever.  There are plenty of Mexican restaurants around and I'm not paying $25 to $40 to get average tasting food and poor service.  \\n\\nKeep in mind that my most recent experience was based on the interactions of three employees there - one of whom is always there and I assume is the manager.

If you don't get to be seated near the window, it kind of ruins the whole point of going there. Bar area is loud, so don't think it's going to be a romantic date unless for some reason their happy hour isn't busy. Service was ok, nothing over the top. My pink margarita was extremely sour and the cup was overfilled with ice. My boyfriend's beer, which was the beer of the day, was pretty watered down. Food wise:\\n\\nKung pao calamari: WAY too much breading. I've never had calamari that was breaded like that before, which is because the calamari should be easy to taste/distinguish. Sauce was whatever, mediocre kung pao flavor.\\n\\nFried oysters: I'm not a big oyster fan, so it was all for my boyfriend, who said it was good. I enjoyed the coleslaw, which could have had the mustard toned down a bit.\\n\\nCheeseburgers: a delicious, classic cheeseburger. Not too big, not too small. Only comes in medium as far as cooking the patty. The chips that came with it were golden brown, but not super crispy. The ranch seasoning was a little too salty and artificial tasting\\n\\nThis is the kind of thing you ought to do once and bring all of your out of town guests to.

Deep frying rather than searing the tofu would have been good too, but I guess all you vegetarian purists out there...it's best just to put the kitchen where we can't see it. \\n\\nFries, as previously stated, were delicious, thin cut and golden brown.

Some friends who live nearby chose it for our Friday night dinner and drinks outing. I debated writing a review on it since I have nothing particularly bad or good to say about it. So instead I'll share my evening..... \\n\\nWe were a group of 6 people and had a 45 minute wait at around 8:30pm, which is expected for a Fri night. We decided to wait it out at the bar. Some of us knew exactly what beer we wanted, others need to sample some before choosing. Those people waited 10-15 minutes just to place their order at the not-so-crowded bar, and what felt like another 15 minutes to get their \\"samples\\". I will say this: the bar tenders were quite friendly and witty. Beers were all great. Our table was called right after we had ordered our second round. The hostess discouraged us from asking the bartenders to deliver our drinks to the table, which caused a bit of a fuss in our group. But then another bar tender overheard the fuss and said he'd gladly do it. Yay! We had great service at the table, minus a small mixup with our order. We all ordered something different and sampled each other's dishes. The food was good enough, except one dish that blew me away: the steak & frites. The steak (cooked med-rare, of course) was phenomenal, and the fries - excuse me, \\"frites\\" - were just as great covered with large specs of sea salty goodness. Nom nom nom... I digress. Other dishes we ordered were the bolognes rigatoni, the cheese cannelloni, turkey burger with carmelized onion and gruyere, and a short rib burger. The rigatoni was very good, the meat consisted of shredded pork, beef, and a third kind which I'm forgetting at the moment. This dish had strong basil flavor, which is great for me, but lacked salt. The turkey burger was a bit dry, boring, and bland, the short rib burger was tender but flavor was nothing special. The cannelloni were good, nice vodka sauce, but also lacked salt. This whole salt issue could just be me though. Then, almost everyone wanted dessert (which is odd, I know) but this establishment doesn't have dessert. Kind of a bummer, but probably better for our waist-line and pockets. \\n\\nAll in all, nothing special about this place other than their beer. I'd really only come back for the steak and fries, er, frites.

Chipotle has great quality food but are losing in the world of the customer experience. The workers seem either lost or like they are miserable and don't want to be at work. This was probably the longest wait I've ever had at a Chipotle with only 2 people in front of me. It took over 25 minutes to get my food and pay. It seems like everyone's order was incorrect that day. There was a lady that I saw came back in the store twice to get missing items for her take out order. That's how long myself and other customers waited in this line. I could look out the window into the parking lot. There was a gentleman that was already standing at the register during this time that was also dealing with an incorrect order. \\nIn addition to all of this chaos....There was a young lady that was making the second half of the bowls. She spilled some hot salsa sauce all over the counter and on the side of my bowl. She ignored this mishap and began to put a lid on my bowl. At this time her hands had the wet sloppy salsa all over her hands. As she's placing the lid on my bowl the salsa was all over my lid and it was really sloppy and wet. I kindly asked if I could have another lid because of the slop all over my bowl spilling over the side and on the lid. She grabbed a paper towel and wiped the lid smearing salsa all over the lid. This actually made it worse. It would have been easier to just replace the lid like I asked her. She had an attitude before I asked and an even worst attitude after I asked to please replace it. She did not try to hide her anger at all. She almost threw my bowl when I asked the cashier if he could give me a new lid please since she didn't want to do it. He was happy to give me a new one.

So this Friday night, we packed up the 5 year old and headed over there. We are familiar with the area but rarely go back to the cute courtyard where this place is tucked away. After reviewing the New Orleans-inspired menu and  weaving through a large amount of cafe-style outside seating that reminded me of something you would find in the French Quarter, we found the host.  It was pretty empty being that it was before 6pm but he told us that all of the outside and patio area was reserved, then lead us to a back room that felt like...Denny's? TooJays? You get the picture. It was recently painted, but the ceilings were stained, and it was nothing like the quaint seating we were led by. Even so, we sat at a booth and then perused the menu. \\nBased on the previous reviews I was expecting the menu to be expensive. But in general, that doesn't bother us if we get a good eating experience. And knowing we already had $40 to spend, made it that much less bothersome. Based on the recommendations of the waitress, my husband got the Ruben ($12) and I got the crab cake entree with ettouffe($29) something I love but don't see often. For the litte tike we got the pizza off the appetizer menu sans the tomatoes (10$). As far as drinks, I got a nice Rouge Dead guy draft and the husband got a tea and son a lemonade.\\nMy entree started with a pathetic salad nothing, mushy tomatoes, dry onions and the dressing served in a plastic cup. Next came out the kids pizza/flatbread--which was smaller and less tastier than the ones they serve at Crispers. Finally the entrees-- Based on the price and my usual appetite, I was expecting to take home plenty of leftovers. But the waitress sat in front of me three small crabcakes with a bit of ettouffee on the side, some Uncle Ben's-ish rice Pilaf, a few steamed asparagus garnished with diced tomatoes on a very plain white chipped plate. The plate, looked very much like the decor of our room, plain and uninspired. Was it tast?, it wasn't bad, the crabcakes were meaty and the crawfish was not tough, the sauce could have been spicier but it was a nice brownish color and flavored with what is typical it that sort of dish. The rice was unacceptable and not remotely New Orleans-style. Was it a $29 dish though? No way--cut that in 1/2 and maybe I would not have felt so ripped off. My husband says his sandwich was fine, but on par with Jason's deli (who makes a good sandwich but doesn't charge $12 for it).\\nService was fine, but not spectacular--overall it just wasn't worth it. If I want to spend that kind of money on an entree, I'll head down the street to Luma and have Chef Brandon whip me up something amazing, or for much less money I can have something very tasty at 310 Park Ave. the are way to many other offerings on Park Ave to even consider coming back here."},{"name":"Murphy's","address":"997 Virginia Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Brunch here is so good!

It tasted way better than Kraft mac n cheese, this was fancy and very cheesy. We also had a bunch of fresh oysters. We ordered the \\"Two-Somes\\" to share- snow crab legs and shrimp, which came with corn and potatoes. We had the signature bootleg sauce, which was really spicy. You can even upgrade your sauce to get an extra spicy kick- I am so glad we did not do that because the normal sauce was already very hot.  You will be provided with plastic gloves, as well as a clip to turn your napkin into a bib.

When I get seafood, I want/need/expect it to be fresh, and Luke's delivers. I ordered the Taste of Maine in order to sample the best of the best. It wasn't the best, to be honest. The three sandwiches (crab, lobster, shrimp) were pretty mediocre and didn't carry much flavor, and the buns felt like a throwaway. The shrimp was my favorite, but then again, I'm partial to those delicious critters.

It was also HOT; on an already hot day outside, it was not any better inside the restaurant. \\n\\nAs for the food, I will start off with the one positive: oysters were delicious and fresh. The rest of the food experience was very subpar in my opinion. I ordered clam chowder. The chowder was watery, almost to the texture of milk. The potatoes in our chowder was very undercooked to the point that they seemed raw. It was nice that there was a good amount of sizeable clams, but disappointing overall. The hot lobster roll was even more of a disappointment. Not sure what everyone else loves about it. I can make the same thing at home and it would cost much less than $25+. It was literally just steamed lobster meat drenched in butter stuffed in a hot dog bun also drenched in butter. There was no twist or any kind of kick that made it stand out. The fries that come with the lobster roll were overly salty as well. \\n\\nI have to say that this was one of the most disappointing meals I have had in a while and will not go back to Neptune.

My brother especially liked learning about this since his apartment has little available in terms of fresh fruit and vegetables around him so he plans to go back each Friday after classes- great find for him as a new local! Next we went into the Public Market and tried two types of donuts. Vinegars, syrups, nuts, and a lobster roll. It was also great for me because I don't do seafood so Audrey arranged for me to get a local root beer instead- great accommodation. Next we went to the Union Oyster House where the group had AMAZING corn bread and soup. The group got clam chowder and I got French onion. Delicious all around. Next we went and ventured into the North End. We tried Bricco which was a great venture. We tried mozzarella and bread. So delicious! Finally, we ended the tour with a trip to Modern Pastry which was the crown jewel. We got a delicious cannoli all boxed up. But who could leave it?!

Where else can you get Unibroue Blanche de Chambly beer for $3? It's an awesome deal. The wine selection is fine for Happy Hour, but nothing spectacular. The food is a really good deal. I've eaten my way through the crab cakes, the fish and chips, the chicken fingers, and the grilled cheese (ok, numerous grilled cheeses), Yes, everything is heavy-handed, but the grilled cheese is like the movie Showgirls... you know you shouldn't like it, no one in their right mind would like it, it's terrible for you... but it's irresistible. The compote that goes with it is a nice touch, if you're into the sweet and salty combo. Their pizzas are also really nice. Totally over-cheesed, which is not a complaint.\\n\\nThe decor is cute, like a Real Simple Magazine spread, all soft colors and clean lines.\\n\\nThe only thing lacking is service. It's not that the service is BAD. It's not. I've had bad service, and this is not it... it's just that the service is sorta confused.

The trendy ambiance seems to ooze from the top deck bar as if this were a place you want to go to meet with friends ... and collect new Kardashian ones (BTW I actually dislike the \\"Kardashian\\" FAUX brand, but I digress).\\n\\nUnfortunately, it was more of a 3.5 as opposed to the 5 star experience I expected. Granted, this might be emotional baggage from my declining experience at STK; but after having a delicious dinner in NJ the night before, I was up for spending $75/pp and going after the \\"trophies\\" that Paddlefish had to offer (I know ... run on sentence). I had researched the location and saw the mixed reviews, but I'm always up for giving locations a fresh chance. \\n\\nSo what happened?\\nReservations (5)\\nI easily made reservations on Open table and we arrived about 10-15 min early. We were warmly greeted, enjoyed the lavish ambiance, and were promptly seated (early). (5)\\n\\nWaiter (4)\\nIt took a little long (5-10 minutes) to be seen or get bread, which is a lifetime in dining years. However, our waiter was courteous and made me forget how long it actually took. He explained the menu selections, provided some great options, and solidified my expectations to tip him 20% of an expected +$100 meal for 2.\\n\\nApps/Bread (4.5)\\nWe ordered the (recommended) lobster corn dogs and fried green tomatoes. The corn dogs came out hot and delicious - 5 stars. The FGT was \\"warm\\", but flavorful - 4 stars (a little more sauce please).\\n\\nDinner (3)\\nWe ordered a smorgasbord of food ... Osso Bucco Pork with bone in, Shrimp & Grits, AND Alaskan Crab legs ... Yeah just 2 people, so like I said, I was prepared to pump the bill (and take a lot home). Although I saw some great options, we didn't order drinks because my wife and I both had slight headaches. For this reason, we didn't expect to see our waiter until our food was to arrive, or just ask us for \\"more\\" bread.  So we nibbled on the bread ... For an unexpected 35-40 minutes (2 lifetimes in dining years). At first I didn't notice because we were engaged in discussion and the abundant apps kept me from starving. Our waiter did come to visit to say our food was coming, which prompted me to check my watch ... 9:45. This meant we ordered at least 30 minutes ago since we were seated early (~15) and ordered quickly (~20). Once I realized this I remembered how much I was about to spend and it concerned me. When I go to \\"Friday's\\",  I'm not really expecting excellent service, but here? At $50-75/pp? What made it worse is that the food came out LUKE WARM ... And I absolutely despise this. If my entree is ~$30, this means they can hire someone in the kitchen to monitor the food prep and timing. This was the deal breaker.\\n\\nFood Taste (3.5)\\nAlaskan Crab Legs were a better portion then expected, given some negative reviews, so I was happy. Taste was fine, but not mind blowing.\\n\\nOsso Bucco Pork was a generous portion, and reminded me of dinners in Germany. I was hoping to see stream rise from the meat as I gently pulled it from the bone ... nope, didn't happen.\\n\\nS&G\\nI jumped to the Shrimp & Grits, hoping that there was a traffic mix up and my pork was \\"Luke\\" warm,  but hers was \\"Darth Vader\\" hot. No luck. In fact, I'm not sure if anyone knows this but ... grits aren't happy when they cool down. Flavor seemed like it would have been great if hot.\\n\\nSummary (3.5)\\nBecause it wasn't what I expected, I let the waiter know, but without any expectations. I had ordered more food than I could consume, so \\"microwaving\\" leftovers was already on my Google calendar for tomorrow. Luckily the waiter did exceed my expectations and spoke to management. Although they didn't visit my table, I really wish they would have so I could deliver some constructive criticism, the waiter stepped in and seemed to handle it. I was given a choice of a new meal but declined (never a good option considering timing). In the end, one of our meals was comp'd which did significantly change my tune. This prevented me from an escalating rage as my mind would eventually realize what happened while walking to the Lime parking lot.\\n\\nWill I be back? I really don't know. I want to love STK, I want to love Paddle Fish, I want to love the high priced food options at Disney Springs. Unfortunately my opinion, like my entree, is just Luke warm (3.5)."},{"name":"Magnolia Cafe South","address":"1920 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Went in last weekend, the 22nd for dinner.

We went ahead and ordered, hoping they were what we were used to eating.  I took one bite about the same time my husband and son in law did and just looked at each other.  They were AWFUL.  There was so much Garam Masala in them, I couldn't eat mine.  My husband and son in law ate their's because it had taken so LONG to get our order and for it to be served to us.  I wanted to send mine back and for them too, but we had little ones with us and just kept quiet.  Refills were given when asked for them, as far as drinks were concerned.  We asked for the check and I told the waitress that she should really tell the patrons that the boudin balls were really overseasoned with the Garam Masala (and I love Indian food) that I couldn't eat mine.  She said \\"well, I guess you won't be needing a to go box\\",  Oh, the salad had no seasoning whatsoever.  We asked where the garlic bread was and the waitress said she would have to ask the kitchen staff if it is offered.  We told her it was written on the board for the nightly specials.,  She did bring it, three pieces of some sort of bread, hardly a garlic bread.  It was a very disappointing evening to what had been a lovely day in Austin.  If this is an Austin landmark, I will remember to stay away from this particular one, should I want a good meal.

Mopac Expressway","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Heidi hits it out of the park with her lobster rolls and clam chowder.  At 14 bucks a pop they're not cheap, but for a nicely stuffed roll this price point is in line with what is expected in locales not requiring the lobsters to ride on planes and earn frequent fly miles.  If you complain  about the prices, don't eat lobster for lunch for God's sakes.  I tried the Maine version today for the first time and was 5 star pleased.  I actually think the Maine version was a little under-dressed and could've used a bit more celery seed and mayo  compared to my favorites in Maine.  The overall roll was a bit on the bready side for me and unlike the sort of blond sided hot dog buns that are traditional, but the Sweetish Hill bread was delish nonetheless.   That bread is delivered fresh Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (or maybe Saturday).  The service was fast, and the clam chowder was the best I've ever had.  My problem which deducts no stars is that I could eat two of these, but I could anywhere.  I cannot wait and will not wait to try the buttery Connecticut style.  Off the charts for Austin and if you decide on Perla's or Clark's and desire to pay 25-30 bucks for an experience no more and probably less stellar, you're paying for your seat.  Kudos Heidi!

It's nothing spectacular or ground-breaking. Not sure why it needs to be called a special name like schnitzel. You can get breaded chicken from Chik Fil-a or Zaxby's... but it's better at those places b/c the chicken is thick. I'm not sure why \\"pounding\\" the chicken flat and thin is a selling point. I made the mistake of ordering the Italian version of the schnitzel. I haven't seen any of the other reviewers who were overly impressed with this one either, so i probably made the wrong choice. I expected it to taste something like a chicken parm, but i should have paid attention to the fact that it didn't have any mozzarella on it. But i still expected it to have an Italian flavor, which it didn't. Supposedly it had a pesto sauce on it, but i didn't taste anything that tasted pesto-y. So it was kinda plain... i didn't feel like they were channeling Carrabba's at all. Furthermore, the lady behind the counter lied to me. I asked if the bread (a baguette) was toasted, and she said yes. It was not.... or at least not to the point that i could detect any toasted-ness. If i should deign to go back, i would definitely get another flavor of schnitzel in a wrap instead of the baguette. Since the chicken was so thin, eating it in an untoasted baguette was basically like eating chicken-infused crunchy bread inside soft bread with some mildly-flavored sauce on it. Ok, it may have tasted a little meatier than that, but you get my point.\\nAlso it was a little pricy... glad i had the Scoutmob.\\nOn a more positive note, i must say the sweet potato fries were phenomenal! (Altho i thought the serving was rather small... but back to positive...) They were perfectly cooked and perfectly flavorful. I think they might be my favorite sweet potato fries in Atlanta! I would go back solely because of them... I certainly hope they would be as good the second time around... womp womp womp.\\nSo overall, this is a decent place if you are easily impressed by the sound of exotic-sounding food words like schnitzel... and if you don't get the Italian."},{"name":"Margarita Factory - Downtown Vancouver","address":"1004 Washington St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"If your in Vancouver WA,  hit this place up and order there Michilada!

This sloppy sandwich was so tasty and filling but not too much so, for the money. Nice blend of flavors with mushroom gravy rounding it out.

The texture is so satisfying as your teeth sinks further into the already melted thick cheese that your mouth just salivates with satisfaction. And the bacon is so crisp that even though there's a busy line of people still waiting outside, they took the time required to make sure that the bacon is cooked to perfection.

FOTM still rules in the River City for wings.\\n\\nA nicely sized side salad for $3. was a surprise but the bleu cheese dressing was fairly tasteless.

The ribs were excellent with a tasty sauce on them.  Fall of the bone tender.

That being said, I'm not sure this place could have been more aptly named - grab your pitch fork, light that torch of gluttony, and Vive la Revolution!\\n \\nDoughnuts: Revolution offers two different types of doughnuts: yeast and cake. The yeast doughnuts are chewy and comparable in texture to Krispy Kreme's rendition, while the cake doughnuts are more dense and cake-like. Approximately ten different flavors are available at any given time, a majority of which are vegan-friendly. During my visit,  I ordered the bacon & caramel, vanilla bean, cinnamon & sugar, blueberry, roasted almond, coconut, and dark chocolate. Although all the doughnuts were perfectly delightful, the roasted almond was the clear standout. As if it couldn't get any better, the doughnuts are also impressively large - they're nearly double the size of Sublime. \\n\\nService: The only lackluster aspect of my recent visit was the service. The employees were all perfectly friendly, but far from efficient. Given that there was a line of nearly a dozen people, it wasn't quite clear to me why there was only one employee at the counter while two others were folding boxes in the corner. I understand that there's only one register, but they could have at least helped expedite the line by boxing the orders while the other girl accepted payments.   \\n\\nAtmosphere: The owners are still in the process of decorating the space, so there's not much ambience yet. However, the essentials are all there, including a half dozen tables, a small condiment station that includes complimentary water, and  a high-top counter that overlooks W. College Ave.\\n\\nCost: Relatively expensive for doughnuts, but the quality and size of the product is consistent with the cost. Most doughnuts are $2.00 each, while a few varieties (e.g. bacon & caramel) are $2.50. \\n\\nOther: Both cash and credit cards (via Square) are accepted. Revolution is closed Monday's and typically sells out of doughnuts before their established closing time (4PM on weekdays and 3PM on weekends) - if you plan to head over in the afternoon, I'd recommend calling first or checking their Facebook page to avoid any disappointment.

As more and more people arrived it got really cutthroat. People were not waiting in line, rather they were circling the dining room like sharks. Some groups were posted up next to tables of people eating, waiting for them to leave so they could swoop in and take their table. After about 30 minutes we decided to leave, it just wasn't worth the frustration. \\n\\nI can't imagine that this chaos was a great experience for anyone.

They're not trying hard which is the key point, they're just adding a bit of themselves in the menu which made me smile. I had a couple of sandwiches for dine in.

Mopac Expressway","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"They have good food and service but they are really skimpy on their lobster rolls. We order a lobster bisque and there's hardly any soup. When the chef ask us if we like it or not. She couldn't handle some critique. We said the soup is good but the bread bowl to lobster soup ratio was off. There's more bread than lobster. I don't think it's worth $17. For their lobster roll we tried French and Connecticut. French was good but there's hardly any lobster in our $17 roll. Fish and chips were good but their fries were gross. The fries were cold and old. Brussel sprouts and clam chowder were delicious!! Would I recommend this place, no. Would I come back probably not because the amount they give you for the amount you pay is not worth it."},{"name":"Scampo","address":"215 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Well then.  I made it to Scampo on a Sunday afternoon.  The dining area is dead yet a few people are settled on the patio.  The hostess seats us at a table by the window in those cushy comfy seats that Tom E so mentioned and hands us three paper lunch menus.  I'm there for those pistachio, mozz, peach stacks, yet the lunch menu does not offer it!  I'm slightly devastated considering this since everything on the menu is way more than I want to pay and all I wanted was to try this creative concoction.  I'm concerned that the dishes will be served on tiny plates and portions will suck.\\n\\nLuckily since me and my mom are the only patrons at the time and there are about tree waiters, we are immediately catered to.  I ask the waiter if I can order the mozz with peach and pistachio even though it's not on the menu.  He asks the chef and the chef can do.  Yes!  Mom orders the Salmon \\"plancha\\" BLT.  We share.  I'm satisfied by the sweet smoky nuttiness that the pistachios lend to the mozz but I question whether this is the same dish served at dinner (bits of basil, bite sized mozz balls, basil infused evoo, and very thinly sliced peaches).  The salmon BLT is good and served on Ciabatta with a side of homemade potato chips.\\n\\nI shall return, but I wouldn't encourage anyone to flock to Scampo right this minute."},{"name":"Margarita Factory - Downtown Vancouver","address":"1004 Washington St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"The service was the absolute worst.

They also have a neat option where you can get a smaller portion of the dish for the half the price so that you can try a bunch of different things.  \\n\\nWe got a beet salad that paled in comparison to the other dishes.  The duck rillettes, for lack of a better description, were like an open-faced pate sandwich with salad greens and a yummy mustard sauce.  It was nice to start the meal with these two plates.\\n\\nFor our main dishes, I got the Calamint Tagliatelle, which was a delicious mix of pasta with duck confit (one of my most favorite things ever), mushrooms, and scarmorza.\\n\\nHowever, the bf's choice of Vermont lamb was easily the most delicious lamb I have ever had in my life.  It came with saffron glazed carrots and cranberry beans, but to be honest I had to look at my saved copy of the menu to even know that they were there, because the lamb was the star of this dish.  I don't know if meat can be classified as luscious, but this certainly was -  it was like eating delicious ribbons of lamb.

Heck, my beer was even served in a frosted sundae mug resembling a Chalice. What was really remarkable was the attentive service. Zero waiting time- the hostess immediately greeted us and took us to an available booth. Almost-zero service time- the hostess left, and a server arrived on her dust to take our drink order. And to top if off, zero 'and how's everything?' time once the first spoon landed in our mouths. Peculiar, but it beats the opposite. I felt that they really wanted you to enjoy the meal.\\n\\nSo, for lunch fare: Fried Pickles ($5) as an appetizer, a bowl of Chicken Andouille File Gumbo ($8), and a Side n' Half ($6.50) for half  an Eggplant Po Boy and a side of Andouille Cheddar Grits.  Miller Lite was on draft for $4.\\n\\nThe food was standard and typical of the flavors of Louisiana but lacked a certain 'oomph' factor. For example, I didn't see any Okra in the Gumbo- it would've added a hearty flavor. The Eggplant Po Boy reminded me of Eggplant Parmesan in a sandwich- thin sections of crispy breaded eggplant with a marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese. Even Tibby's Hot Sauce was a little on the milder side with more mustard hits than cayenne, and a clandestine twist of horseradish.  Delicious but, in my opinion, toned way down on some promising flavor profiles. I suppose that the middle-road appeals to a broader audience, but Tibby's risks to become just another restaurant rather than stand out of the pack with their Big Easy menu.\\n\\nThere was one notable exception- the Beignets. A single order ($2.25) got us 3 medium-sized ones. They were searing hot, and fabulously crafted into cocoons flaky layers.  My tongue was taken aback to how delicious these were after a rather standard meal. The generous dusting of confectioners sugar atop the beignets didn't make the dish overly sweet either.

No candy for us today I guess, not with this angry store clerk standing between me and the products anyway. \\nAs I walk to the next aisle I can hear the woman on either a walkie-talkie your phone complaining about how she just talked to the guilty party, at that point I got really insulted.  first of all I don't like being accused of being a thief and secondly had the woman stood in that section and observed her surroundings for two seconds before angrily confronting me with ZERO evidence she would've seen a woman in a black jacket eating a bag of candy as she walked away from the scene (presumably feeling quite good about someone else getting yelled at for her horrific lack of courtesy or manners. I bet she thought it funny that she got her FREE candy and my kids get no Chanukah gelt despite me wanting to buy it like a civilized human.)  I'm going to venture a wild guess and say THAT was probably your gal. \\nAt this point I walk back up to the woman and informed her that was really rude to come to somebody guns blazing, yelling, with zero evidence and absolutely no indication the person was even the person deserving of reprimand. I also informed her that this was my second time in the store and I would not be back and left my carriage with about $150 worth of groceries right in that aisle with that nasty employee. \\nAs I was exiting the store I made sure to tell the manager on duty exactly what happened at which point he looked at me blankly and said all well do you know their name no sir I don't your employee work wasn't wearing a name tag or any indication that she actually works for the company she recently dressed in all black. Absolutely nothing was done to remedy the situation and it's really sad because it could've been a good local grocery store for my family. The saddest part is I had to go to three other grocery stores to get all of the things that I was going to buy at this one store. so they lost over $400 worth of grocery businesses today and I will NEVER be back."},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"First time visiting Boston, and Luke's did not disappoint!

Is there a law against insider trading if you just HAPPEN to overhear some market advice coming from the next table?  Because...you don't really have a choice here.\\n\\nI hosted an event here, and for a budget of $1500 for 30ish people, was pleasantly surprised with both the warmth and accommodation of the staff, and the ambiance they took pains to set up (the whole upper floor, white linen table cloths, little tea lights on the tables), if not the food.  We ordered standard pub fare, which was exactly what we got.  Nachos, buffalo tenders, lil' pesto paninis--no complaints, but no real compliments either.\\n\\nHowever, I've come here a few times for lunch, and have been consistently impressed with the quality, if not variety, of the foodstuffs--for $14 a pop, I've had some delicious, fresh salmon nicoise or that great salad with the puck of fried goat cheese.

Not utterly mezmerized, but not disappointed either.\\n\\nThe layout of the restaurant is gorgeous. Very sleek and modern, very urban chic. It's a great restaurant for a romantic outing, because they dim the lights to hit that note. I say, hey, do what you gotta do, as long as I can see my food on my plate, it's all good.\\n\\nWe sat on the upper level (yes, the restaurant has two floors) at a cozy four-seater table. I wasn't too crazy about how close the tables were, and how small the tables were. By the end of the night, we barely had enough room to fit everything on the table.\\n\\nBut the food is excellent. We had two pasta sampler platters to share between the four of us. My favorite ended up being the cannelloni and the meatballs ... mmm, my mouth is starting to water just remembering them. The pasta was cooked to just the right chewy consistency, al dente. The various sauces for the pasta sampler seemed a bit salty however.\\n\\nOh, and there were little black floaty bits in our water. Probably safe to drink, but I prefer to have cleaner water all the same if I'm going out of my way to eat at a restaurant, know what I mean? I hate it when this happens, cause you have two choices: 1) alert the waiter of said floaty bits and risk having him or her do something to your food, or 2) smile and bear it, and just don't drink any water at all. Maybe they do it on purpose so you're forced to buy alcohol to quench your thirst ....\\n\\nAnd finally, the piece de resistance of all restaurant reviews -- the bathrooms. Italian Kitchen has several gender-neutral bathrooms, where you walk in and find a toilet and urinal in each. Now, I'm all for gender neutrality (and it's probably easier for transvestites too), but I'm not too crazy about having a urinal in my face when I need to \\"use the ladies' room\\", if you know what I mean. I'm just sayin'.\\n\\nWould I eat here again? Maybe. Would it be my first pick? Probably not.

The only reason I give it 4 vs. 5 stars is due to the women's restroom.

On to the next flavor. \\nThe malted milk ball was amazing, in both shake form and on a cone. I love chocolate ice cream and this was a very pleasant and delicious flavor that was not overwhelming. I did come back the next day for another helping.\\nThe salted caramel was another story. When you first bite into it, it's impressive, a wonderful concoction that a fellow reviewer noted to be the right combination of salty and sweet. The first bite was good - until you stop eating it. Then it turns into a back-of-the-tongue and eye-wincing hell that will leave a strong salty after taste that forces you to attempt to find a chaser. Since when should you have a chaser for ice cream? We bought a shake and couldn't even get through a fourth of it. It was painful and is a joke compared to the malted milk ball. If you want to consume this flavor, you need to keep eating it without the intention of stopping. We found the salty after-taste to be a huge unbearable let-down for this particular flavor. \\n\\nThis place is worth going back for the malted milk ball and their cones - which are handmade. If I were to rate this place on the salted caramel and stacciatella flavors, I probably would not have come back. The malted milk ball is what made me rate it according to yelp's description of A-OK, but the struggle was real."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Came here while visiting Boston for work due to the high review marks.

The 14oz swordfish filet and the blue crab topped grouper.

The grouper was also incredible  which was juicy and flaky and a nice piece of fish.  The crab on top was done to perfection.  This dish came with garlic mashed potatoes which were also very good.  The asparagus that accompanied this dish was done perfectly - cooked and crunchy - not mushy.\\n\\nWe all dined to our hearts content and really could not think about desert.  But not wanting to leave without at least looking to see what they had for perhaps next time, we succumbed to sharing the best key lime pie I've ever had and a wonderful coconut creme' brulee.

In light of this terrible, terrible news, I thought I'd (finally) write a review as an homage to this place and hopefully encourage you to give it a try before it shutters its doors for good.\\n\\nAll the Taiwanese classics are well done here. You can't go wrong with their three cup chicken, comprised of succulent bone-in pieces stir fried with Thai basil, ginger, rice wine and other aromatics. Looking for something more indulgent? They do dong po pork justice here, with a huge slab of pork belly braised to melt-in-your-mouth perfection. I also really love their take on black pepper beef. The meat is cut into bite-sized strips and tossed in a flavourful black pepper and onion demi glace, perfect over rice.\\n\\nI love that Maji consistently changes up their menu as well. On my most recent visit, I had their grilled black cod and it was superb. You get a thick filet with crispy edges, paired with a sweet sauce and lemon for acidity. The deep fried prawns with salted egg yolk were also very tasty. The prawns retained their springy texture and the salted egg yolk enhanced their umami flavour. \\n\\nTaiwanese fast fry dishes pair best with a cold beer, and Maji has an abundance of options. If you're not a drinker, Chinese drinks reminiscent of one's childhood like iced herbal tea and apple sidra are great too.\\n\\nI'm sad to see Maji go, but I wish the owners the best of luck on all their future endeavors!

We had the seasonal bruschetta - three very large slices of bread with three different toppings (photo uploaded). Each was tasty. Highly recommend this as a meal on it's own or for sharing with friends(s). Their roasted beets were well done with herbs and goat cheese on top.

I've actually joined Yelp, just so I can review this pit.  Let me be clear, however, that the employees were perfectly lovely and deserve none of the blame.  In this instance, it was the owner Steve Jones who was shockingly rude.\\n\\nI went yesterday with my father because we wanted to check out Cheese Bar.  We own a property in Multnomah Village that we are looking to fill with small boutiques.  We thought Cheese Bar might be a good fit.  Arriving at 4:30 pm, we were told that the owner was out but would be back soon.  Not wanting to be rude and simply take up space we ordered some of their salami, (it was mediocre at best), and waited for Steve to return.  Upon his return at about 5 pm I saw one of the employees talk to Steve, and point us out letting him know that we would like to speak to him.  A customer had just walked in, however, so Steve went to serve them.  We did not mind that at all since we did not want to interfere with business.  \\n\\nFor the next 30 or 40 minutes we waited patiently at the bar while Steve continued to serve customers.  In all this time, not once did he even look at us (not once) let alone say something simple like \\"i know you're waiting, i'll be with you as soon as possible.\\"  Now, please remember, we were paying customers.  All this time we were sitting at the bar snacking on the charcuterie.  At 6pm, the last retail customer had left and we thought we would finally be able to chat with him (we only needed 2 minutes of his time).  At this point one of his employees came up to us and said \\"Steve just told me he's really busy and won't have time to speak with you today.\\"  Steve was literally standing 4 feet from us and yet could not be bothered to come over and tell us this himself.  The employee was gracious and seemed embarrassed at his boss's behavior since we had waited patiently for such a long time. I should also add that there were 2 groups of four seated in the entire restaurant and Steve had 3 employees working for him that afternoon and yet not one second could be spared.  If it was just him I would have understood but there were a total of 4 people serving 8 customers.  I would have also been more understanding if Steve had actually approached us himself and apologized by saying he was just simply too busy  but this holier than thou cheese nazi couldn't even be bothered to look at us.   I will never again go to Cheese Barf and will tell everyone about my horrible experience with the owner.  \\n\\nI would also like to add my father's opinion on the food.  He has a unique advantage of knowing a lot about cheese.  He used to be a fromagier in Paris.  He would purchase cheese in the famous open markets of the city and deliver them all over Paris.  His opinion is that the cheese is grossly overpriced and very limited.  Even if the food was glorious, I wouldn't go here again.  There are plenty of other places I can get cheese and be treated better.  Needless to say, we will not be considering them for our property."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Fantastic spot.

It's worth the trip! Their unique northwest-style belgian sour beers are unlike anything else in Portland and are fantastic! Quite a feat given the complexity and time required to develop a sour beer. They didn't spend all there energy focusing on the beer as their food is good too. They are known for their beer-battered french fries which are cut into wedges with a perfectly light crust. Certainly within the top tier of fries in Portland. They offer a number of dipping sauces for the fries, which are good but nothing to rave about. Whatever you do--DO NOT ORDER THEIR STANDARD FRIES. I made that mistake once and they were probably straight from the freezer. The rest of their food is great, although a little heavy handed sometimes with the butter and oil. However, it is certainly better than most pubs in town. One thing of note is their side of vegetables offered on many of their dishes. Most places it is a second though and often some steamed green beans, asparagus or broccoli is slapped down on the plate. But at the Raccoon Lodge, it is a delicious mix of brussel sprouts, green and red peppers, squash and onion that is perfectly stir-fried and seasoned. Yum! And if that was not enough--the service is excellent. The waitstaff is attentive, very knowledgeable about the menu and very accommodating. One example of many, one friend made a mistake and didn't realize that the regular fries came with their meal, not the beer battered fries. After mentioning this to the waiter, the waiter (without thinking twice) offered to bring out the beer-battered version.

The first time - more than a year ago - the food was better than it was last month. I gotta say, I just can't stand this place. I hate everything about it, except for the cornmeal pancakes (which don't seem to be on many of the menus - just the one over the cash register). \\n\\nIt's all just waiting and jostling in line and fighting for a spot with all of the other indolent 20- and 30-somethings intent on shoving the line forward and getting to a table first. So, you wait in line outside to order at the counter - ordering your breakfast from an employee who didn't bother to shower before coming in to work, doesn't have the time to be polite, and gets quite put out if you're not instantly ready. Like I mentioned, the paper menu they hand out while you're standing in line isn't the same as the one inside the restaurant. Then, you get to cram inside with too many elbows and knees and baby car seats plunked in the one walkway through the tables. Packed past capacity both mornings I went there, there're simply not enoyugh tables for the number of people who've already ordered food. You just wait. And wait and wait and wait until someone decides to stop lingering over their 10th cup of coffee and allow some slathering lurker their seat. If you're lucky, some hostile hipsters might deign to make room on their community bench for you to sit down with your plate of food. \\n\\nSo, sometimes you have a seat before your order is ready, sometimes you don't. Your problem. It's not like there are any employees to actually facilitate the process of sitting and eating - why should they? They already have your money. You're expected to bus your own table, too. When I go out for breakfast, I prefer not to have to work so hard. I like a relaxing, mellow morning of good food - not this super stressful competition for a spot to sit. And good luck if there are more than 2 of you in your group - let go of the expectation that you'll all actually sit together. \\n\\nI also prefer better food. Seriously, I can't figure out why people love this place so much. This food will kill you - and it's hardly worth it. It's all thick, white gravy and fried nastiness. I ordered the cornmeal pancakes, which were decent. They're hardly worth all of the waiting and the table commotion. My scrambled eggs were runny and tasted uncooked. \\n\\nAnd it's a terrible place for kids. My friend had her toddler with her, and, as a mom I can safely say, what a nightmare. There's no room - no room for the highchair, no room for a baby car seat (except, you know, the floor where people are pushing and shoving to pick up their food from the counter), and no room for all the waiting the kids have to do. I'd rather drink a gallon of their death gravy than take my school-age kids to this place. \\n\\nAnyway, I won't be back next time I'm in Portland. There are just too many restaurants that are actually tasty, friendly, and fun to hang out in -- like the Tin Shed down the street. Try that instead."},{"name":"Bubor Cha Cha","address":"45 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Although I do love Dim Sum, I've never been at the level where I can tell whether a particular Dim Sum place is better than another.

I mean, its opening night, right?

Occupying the old Payless Shoes space, this expansive restaurant is a welcome addition to this somewhat barren stretch of West Broadway. It brings a touch of class that you don't find at places like Shenanigans, The Junction, or Stats. \\n\\nWalking in, I was blown away by the shear size of this place- it really does seem to go on forever, with high ceilings and a 50 foot bar. The place was dimly lit and the decor was subtle and warm making this place still feel very cozy. \\n\\nThe food here is the real standout though. We started with a couple well balanced drinks- The Quiet Man for the bourbon drinker and the City Point Fizz if you're looking for something more understated-  and some to-die-for meatballs. The meatballs, sitting in a bed of polenta, were falling apart fantastic. (nitpick: serve with spoon to allow us to get to all that polenta!) For entrees, we went with the braised shortrib with mac & cheese (so fall-off-the-bone good!) and the steak frites with truffled parmesan truffle fries which was cooked to perfection! (nitpick: the steak dried out a bit sitting there- add some of its juices on the plate). Both dishes were almost surprisingly good. \\n\\nThe only thing to complain about was the hit or miss service. Understandable for opening night, but there shouldn't be a 10 minute lull between seating and the first visit by the waiter. During the meal, he was great, checking in twice to make sure everything was just right but then disappeared for a bit again when we were looking for the check. Minor issue and hopefully something that will get better with time. \\n\\nAll in all, this is a very welcome addition to the West Broadway scene and something I have been looking for in my neighborhood for a long time.

The guy on the other line said, \\"No problem,\\" and I was excited for the next day.  The next day, we sat down at our reserved table, and the waiter brought us a menu.  I told him we already ordered the fish, but he said that they ran out.  When I told him I called about it yesterday, he said they no longer served it.  Which is it? Also, our waiter had the same voice as the guy who answered the phone the day before.  Shady.\\n\\nWe got the flounder and grilled pork wraps and the chicken curry.  The veggies for the wraps were super fresh, but the meats were pretty disappointing.  The flounder was salty but not very flavorful and the pork was flavored well but the slices were so thin that they were tiny shrivels on the plate.  Plus, getting the rice paper wraps is an additional cost.  Chicken curry was ok but really sweet and only had about 3-4 pieces of small chicken in it.  We were still hungry after we were done and had to go next door to get more food.  \\n\\nOverall a 2 hoping that they weren't telling me anything false.

But I'll round up because it was a good enough experience that I will likely return. \\n\\nI'll admit I was a bit apprehensive about going here, mainly because I was dreading the typical West Campus parking clusterfuck. And indeed, the few spots in the front lot right off of 24th were taken. But if you pass the restaurant heading west and hang a right into the alley, there's a dirt/gravel lot behind the restaurant that offers many more spaces. \\n\\nWe were able to pounce on one of the street-side patio tables right after a party left. Sure, staring out over a busy 24th Street isn't the ideal al fresco experience, but at least across from Cuatros you have the Texas Federation of Women's Clubs Mansion, which is a nice Georgian Revival brick building. I know you're thinking, \\"Who gives a shit about the building across the street?\\" Well, if you're going to be sitting there for 1-2 hours, it sure as hell beats looking at a worn-out strip mall front of laundromats and tat parlors. If you're there to watch a game instead of the view, you're in luck: chances are there will be at least 3 big-screen TVs within your field of vision regardless of where you are seated. \\n\\nKudos to the bus boy, who did not leave us waiting long among our predecessors' debris AND who did not give us the half-assed \\"oh, there's new people sitting here already, so I'm just going to pick up the old plates and leave\\" number. No, he not only cleared and wiped off the table thoroughly, but he also said he would go get a server right away. If quality service filters down to the bus staff, that's a good sign. \\n\\nThe service was generally very attentive and prompt. The only delay we experienced was in my wife getting a beer after her first choice was not available and the second required a tap change. Even though it wasn't really THAT long a wait, they comped the beer anyway, which was nice. My only complaint is that my menu had a noticeable amount of someone else's food stuck to it, which is just gross. Presumably that's why Cuatros laminates the menus - so that someone who works there - and not me - can easily wipe that crap off. \\n\\nThe food selection and quality was generally pretty good for this price point. They offer about 10 or so mixed drinks and a good variety of beers on tap. The food is pub-style - appetizers, burgers, tacos, etc. - but with more flair than you usually see. The grilled fish tacos and grilled shrimp tacos were very tasty and - a rarity in hand-held seafood items - not overcooked. My two complaints: (1) The chips were too flimsy for dipping. A sturdier chip would have prevented the guac and salsa bowls from becoming clogged with chip detritus. (2) The rice and beans that accompanied the tacos were really bland and not worth eating. I'd rather have 50 cents knocked off the price and eliminate these thrown-in sides. \\n\\nA couple of caveats. First, as mentioned, the ubiquitous TVs make Cuatros a big draw for sports fans - particularly, it seems, so-called soccer fans who follow some Premier League team that they randomly threw their allegiance to in an effort to be hip or to feed their inner Anglophile, but who couldn't find Manchester on a map and wouldn't see an American MLS game in their own backyard even if someone gave them free tickets and beer money. All that is to say, if you're just looking for a nice outdoor dining experience, you may need to plan around game day. Second caveat is that, as with any patio, smokers are free to light up and blow their foul exhalations into the faces of you and yours. I haven't found this to be a big problem in Austin, but there seemed to be a bit more of it at Cuatros. Maybe that's because of the high quotient of students, who, you know, are going to live forever and are willing to pay the small price of cultivating a carcinoma in the bronchus if it means they will look cool. \\n\\nThose caveats aside, Cuatros' large patio and better-than-average bar food make it a great destination for outdoor dining when Austin's temperature falls below that of the surface of the sun.

As soon as you step inside you'll notice the very welcoming tropical colors, Caribbean decorations, and how spotlessly clean the restaurant is.\\n\\nWe were promptly greeted by one of the owners (the wife; it is a husband and wife locally family owned restaurant) and seated.  The service was excellent; my water was constantly refilled and even though their menu said they charge for the friend plantains+potato crisps w/ garlic dip, they kept bringing out more and more and did not charge for any of it. And man did these taste freshly made and amazing.\\n\\nThe menu was perfect for first-timers because it isn't too lengthy and contains options for everyone.  Each dish is a Cuban/S. American chef prepared dish.  I tried the house special pulled pork while my friend got the special beer-braised chicken.\\n\\nOnce our food came, I was surprised at how fresh it looked.  The plates did not really have a lot of \\"garnish\\" (could use a little more), but the food was presented exactly as ordered.  Immediately after taking the first bite of the pulled pork I was stunned at the burst of flavors in my mouth.  It was damn near perfect!  My friend thoroughly enjoyed his beer-braised chicken as well.  In fact, my pork was so good that it was gone by the time my friend was about halfway through his meal.\\n\\nFor the two side orders I had the house rice and black beans, both excellent.  As we continued to eat, the chef (also, the husband and owner of the restaurant) came out of the kitchen and asked us how everything tasted.  We explained that it was good and chatted with him for a while.  Eventually he introduced his wife and told us about the history of the restaurant and how it came to be in Austin.  He mentioned that they were thinking about doing a downtown food truck as well with Cuban sandwiches and other specialties... god I hope so!!  Would be amazing to eat this stuff while stumbling around downtown at the end of the night!!\\n\\nAfterward, the waiter brought us some mimosas, on the house, and wow were they great!  Then, as soon as either of our mimosas started getting empty, the waiter would come by with a pitcher and fill them up!  No charge.\\n\\nAnyway, I felt compelled to write this review due to the fact that this is one of the tastiest and most different places I had been to in Austin in a while.  The place deserves more business.  It's fairly new (I think he said it had been open only 4 months) and unattractive from the outside with what seems like very limited parking in a somewhat seedy area.  But, what's in store inside the restaurant is a truly remarkable dining experience.  I also think they have a happy hour which I may go check out at another time.  Hopefully their business will pick up as soon as more people taste how good the food is here!!  5 stars for sure."},{"name":"Mo Better Chicken","address":"3929 Flat Shoals Pkwy, Ste 101","city":"Decatur","stars":"3.5","text":"Hoped for the best, expected \\"average\\", I underestimated this place - it was Terrific!\\n\\nVisiting the neighborhood to attend Power Of Faith Family Worship Center(located directly behind \\"MBC\\"), I think The Lord led me to both these(2) blessings.

It only opened a few months ago, but the staff has already tapped into something special and our taste buds and arteries are smiling for it.  What is it exactly?  Well, a little bit of everything.\\n\\nThis is one of those joints that seems to do everything right.  I have never had gelato this good anywhere before.  The chocolate is my favorite of the regular flavors.  The owner offers seasonal options as well which rotates on a fairly regular basis.  The pumpkin in the Fall was out of this world.  In addition, there are a great number of toppings that you can add to your gelato.\\n\\nThe coffee and espresso is as good as anywhere else in the city and compliment the gelato very nicely.\\n\\nThe wraps are tremendous.  The vegetables are extremely fresh, the eggs cooked to perfection and the use of correct sauces with each wrap make every option a correct one.  It really makes you wonder how Jimmy Johns next door could even stay in business.  Once everyone working in the area learns about Mary's, I bet ole' Jimmy moves to another side of town because right now Mary is kicking his ass.\\n\\nLastly are the pops themselves.  I had no idea what to expect since my experience has only been with store bought pops.  Comparing what Mary's sells to what you can pick up at HEB is like comparing fine dining to fast-food.  The pops are like a work of art with different layers of culinary pleasure to satisfy,  I've had the peanut butter and the strawberry.  I think they both made me moan in public like I was Meg Ryan.\\n\\nThe owner is a great guy who is very cordial and helpful when trying to make your selections.  He always puts on gloves when making your food and throws them away as soon as he's done.  How often do you get to see that?\\n\\nFinally, the story behind Mary's is pretty amazing.  I won't ruin it for you here, so I enourage you to stop by, order a wrap, grab one of the pamphlets that tells the story, kick back, read and then top it off with a pop/gelato and cup of coffee.

She originally majored in Econ at Harvard, but quit and decided to pursue her dreams by opening up a bakery of her own! I've tried several of her recipes from her first cookbook, and it was a treat to finally be able to try her baked goods in Boston. \\n\\nMy favorites:\\n-The famous sticky bun. OMG this was amazing. Even though we asked for to-go, it still came warm in the box. It had that wonderful sticky bun aroma when you opened the box. The first bite - nearly killed me because it was so perfectly doughy and chewy. The sticky sauce went perfectly with the bun, and had a soft crunch with the nuts. Each bite kept you lingering for more...until it was all gone. Man on man. This is NOT something to be passed up on! Sometimes sticky buns can be too dry, but this one was PERFECT and had just the right amount of moist to it!!!\\n\\n-TCHO milk chocolate cookie. There is something about this cookie that is simply addicting. It's a flat, large chocolate chip cookie that has layers upon layers of milk chocolate - chocolate in each bite. It also has a chewy center, and only the edges are crispy. It has the lovely buttery taste to it too. This has got to be one of the best cookies I've ever had. \\n\\nMan, I wish I were here more days in Boston. I wish I could've eaten just a little nibble more.

Don't get me wrong - Neptune Oyster serves up some of the most delicious Pacific oysters on the planet, but if I were going to try to get full on just oysters alone - not a completely unreasonable plan - I would have to spend at least $200-$250 just on oysters for myself. That being said, we spent over $100 on oysters on this visit and that felt like sharing a light appetizer. Just a bad value.\\n\\nPass on the mussels bowl. We ordered 2 bowls of them because I'm a sucker for fresh mussels - and our server said they were \\"great!\\". Wrong! More than half were the small shrunken orange variety, some were average Mediterraneans, and only a middling few came out plump. A disappointment, and one of the main reasons we came here and waited in line for 40 minutes before they opened. A great mussels dish is incredibly hard to find (and you *won't* find it here!)\\n\\nTheir famous Yellowtail / hamachi crudo was very small (but tasty) and expensive for what it was. You will think it's a small portion. You could eat 4 entire orders of this by yourself and your stomach won't even blink. When your brain knows something is expensive, your brain tells your tastebuds it tastes better than it really is. This happens all day, every day at Neptune Oyster :)\\n\\nTheir famous sea urchin (uni) toast is extremely salty. It's mostly crusty bread and butter, and it definitely sounds more delicious than it actually is. Trust me on this.

I loved the outside area we were seated because it was not overly crowded and allowed for a bit of privacy and intimacy. The only thing that my friend has an issue with at this restaurant was the fact that they allows dogs on the outside patio area. I understand places being dog friendly but they also must be considerate to people who are dining there and might have issues with pets around their food or allergies or fear of animals. In addition where the owner and his dog were seated was not in the best place for people to walk through because the dog was rather large in right in the walking area for waiters and customers making it challenging to get by.

When you try Indian food straight from India (I swear, when you are walking around, you would think you are in India in this part of Jackson Heights), everything else becomes so sorry.  Indian food in Beverly??  North Shore??  Come on.  It may be one of the better Indian places around here but you guys never had good Indian food.   \\n\\nI think their chicken is a bit tough, though they do make great sauces for dishes such as Chicken Tikka Masala (it seemed a bit sweet cause they mixed too much yogurt).  \\n\\nI also think that \\"A Passage to India\\" right over in Salem has better nans.  \\n\\nBut reading everyone's review saying that it's the best Indian food ever, I wonder if it was the ONLY Indian food they've ever had.  It's like having pizza near Salem and saying that it was the best pizza they've ever had without trying some authentic NYC pizzas.  \\n\\nGo to Jackson Heights, NY and hopefully, we won't see this kind of rating..."},{"name":"Checkers","address":"6908 Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"I stopped by after hitting up a bar.

What gave this spot 5 stars for me was the service, like I said. Even though it was so busy every table was occupied and I sat at the counter, the employee who took my order and brought me my food took the time to talk to me about my order and what drink to get from the cooler.

But for outstanding food like this I would've waited all day."},{"name":"JJ's Fresh From Scratch","address":"2950 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"The name of this place might be misleading to some. That's right, it's actually not an Alabama southern diner - but a nicely done Mediterranean meets Fresh-Mex Chipotle knock-off (a la...choose & point, throw it all in a bowl). Overall, it's pretty tasty comfort food for me...with room for just a little improvement. (But, lots of room to grow, add new options, feature limited-time only choices, etc.)\\n\\nYour choices include 3 kinds of rice ( I almost always go with the Mexican rice); black beans or lentils (I usually always go lentils); 3 meat varieties including steak, chicken, or pork (I'm pretty confident pork is the best), roasted peppers/onions or eggplant; pico de gallo or tabbouleh (always get the tabbouleh); feta or cheddar jack (I usually don't get cheese); and, either tzatziki or sour cream. You can also add hummus or guacamole, and the spicy habenero sauce or tomato salsa. Pita or tortillas chips are also available, as well as beer/wine. The pork can be a little greasy (especially combined with the lentils) but I like grease - besides, the pork is easily the best protein, as the chicken is a little plain for me, and the steak too well-done (or perhaps a better cut of meat would work here?). You do need to be careful for giant pieces of fat lingering in the pork waiting to trick you. Occasionally, the peppers & onions look a little scary but they taste good....\\n\\nService is quick and very friendly - except on the rare occasion that the crew is all standing in the back. I have been a handful of times now, and for the most part I enjoy it - but each trip back, I might be just a little less satisfied than the previous time. Their service is very personalized though - and they will accommodate you in sampling, as well as putting together whatever kind of bowl you want . A few of the items are a little inconsistent regarding the preparation...the tabbouleh was different a few times; the hummus tasted bland the second time I got it; and the pico de gallo can be pretty watery and lacking in flavor. When I popped in late once, I got the last bag of pita chips...ridiculously stale, so be careful as it gets closer to closing time.\\n\\nOverall - a great, local alternative to Chipotle or any other fill-your-bowl fast-casual spot - but I hope they start making smaller, more frequent batches of some of the products so they are consumed faster. My experiences have ranged from 5 stars to 3 stars - but I am definitely a fan, and will be back often!"},{"name":"Tibby's New Orleans Kitchen","address":"2203 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"OMG if your looking for a new place to eat.

The cook had a totally awesome mustache."},{"name":"The Thurman Cafe","address":"183 Thurman Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"The place: Thurman is just south of German Village/Shiller Park. It's in an old, single story building. There are two main areas in the restaurant: a large waiting area where the bathrooms are located, and the bar/restaurant area. Let's be clear here: Thurman is a DIVE. It's a bar first and a restaurant second. Don't dress up, don't expect cleanliness, and don't come here if you're looking for anything but a big, huge burger ... just my advice. \\n\\nThe food: OH. MY. GOODNESS. I've been to Thurman twice. The first time I had the Thurman Burger, the second time I had the Western Burger. They were each, respectively, one of the best burgers I've ever had. The Thurman Burger itself may well be the best burger I've ever eaten. The combination of the HUGE beef patty (fresh! never frozen!) with the vertibale garden of veggie-toppings (peppers, lettuce, tomato, mushrooms, sauteed onions) and the heaping pile of succulent, sweet ham, make this sandwich one you've gotta try before death. The chips and fries that come with the burgers are good, but nothing to write home about. For me, the only reason to come here are the burgers, and that's PLENTY of reason for me. \\n\\nThe drinks: 5 beers on tap, nothing notable. Full bar, coke products. \\n\\nThe service: Once you make it into the restaurant, the service is decent for a bar. The big problem here is that Thurman is ALWAYS completely packed. 2:00 on a Friday afternoon yielded a 1 hour wait, while 3:00 on a Sunday afternoon yielded a 2 hour wait. I would never plan on going to Thurman around an actual meal-time. Friday or Saturday evenings are a no-no. I tried once, and found I'd have to wait well over 2 hours for a table. I can't really fault Thurman for the wait. They're immensely popular and very tiny. It doesn't look like they have any room for expansion, nor any plans to make room. I don't mind the wait because I expect it, but it keeps me from coming here unless I REALLY want a giant burger or have plans to bring a friend to try one. The mega-long wait is why I knocked off a star.\\n\\nThe crowd: lots of tourists and foodies, as a result of Thurman's national fame via Man v. Food. No complaints, really. \\n\\nOverall: The burgers are PERFECT and HUGE. Taking friends to Thurman is great fun. Watching their faces as their burgers arrive is hilarious, and it's fun to watch them try to finish the beheamouth sandwiches. The ONLY complaint I have about Thurman is the wait. Expect to wait between 1 and 2 hours (and warn your friends) and you'll have an unforgettable time."},{"name":"Com Vietnamese Grill Restaurant","address":"4005 Buford Hwy NE, Ste E","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Ordered flat vermicelli duck with grape wrap.

I'm really not surprised that the owners have put this \\"thriving business\\" (their words, not mine, as seen in the Real Estate section of the Richmond News) up for sale.\\n\\nPerhaps you wouldn't have to if you treated your regular customers better.\\n\\nTheir screamers are as delicious as ever, but the quality of the food has gone down. My family is a huge fan of the crab bombers (basically the cheesy crab-filled relatives of Church's Chickens jalape√±o bombers). But lately, the crab bombers are almost all crispy coating, with very little crab filling in them. They used to stuff them more generously, but now it's gotten to the point where I'm just eating the breadcrumb coating (not yummy, I'll tell you that).\\n\\nTheir sandwiches also have less meat and fillings than they used to. Obviously, times are hard. But I have no incentive to spend my hard earned money on their food if they barely put any toppings or fillings, and all I can taste is the bread!!\\n\\nThen there's the fact that they always cause a ruckus about honouring their stamp cards. One time I forgot my one of my stamp cards at home, and started adding stamps to a new one instead. Later, I hoped that the owners would allow me to combine the stamp cards (just this once) because I was a loyal regular customer (I mean, they know my face; they know I'll be back). But alas, they made a big deal about it, and what's more stated that they couldn't do so in a VERY rude manner.\\n\\nIt's not like they're a big franchisee, and they can't deviate from an instruction manual describing how they have to behave. This is your business, It's in your power to make an exception (and you chose not to). Don't pretend otherwise. I found their attitude extremely frustrating.\\n\\nSuffice to say, I haven't gone back after that, and I don't think I will again.

It consists of two 3/4 pound beef patties, ham, bacon, covered in mozzarella, American cheese, lettuce, tomato, mushrooms, sauteed onions, pickles, jalapeno peppers and mayo. Maybe it's possible to finish if shared between two, however it's definitely a Man vs. Food challenge if attempted solo. My buddy attempted the challenge, but failed gloriously. However, he did enjoy the burger enough to take the leftovers home. \\n\\nI ordered the Western Burger and loved it. It consisted of bacon, cheddar, BBQ sauce, lettuce, tomatoes and onions. The burger patty itself was the star. It was perfectly cooked to order, melt in your mouth juicy with tons of flavor. The thickness of the burger makes it diffcult to eat, but the messy aftermath is completely worth it. \\n\\nThe burgers come with some crispy thick cut french fries.

I walk in, alone, unsure of where to go since there was no one at the host stand by the bar. After 5 minutes of standing around uncomfortably in front of the band, the host showed up and without a word, plunked down 2 menus at a table right next to the band. I had to yell to let him know that I would like a table in the dining room where my friend and I would be able to hear each other. Not impressed with the uninspired brunch menu, my friend and I ordered from the regular lunch and dinner menu. Her roasted poblano soup was incredible, heavy and creamy...the liquid essence of poblanos. We shivered while we waited for the entrees to arrive because the A/C was turned waaaaay up. Her spinach salad arrived. Yummy, but nothing special. And my chile relleno came, relleno de maiz. Overflowing with corn, actually. The presentation was nice. A bed of white rice and very black beans, so the poblano stood out beautifully. The taste did not, however. I could have, and should have, done much better at home. It was nothing more than a roasted pepper with a can of corn stuffed inside. When we asked the waitress for our check, she rudely brushed past us to drop the check at another table before asking what we needed. \\n\\nIf I'd had previously good experiences here I might be more forgiving. However, the last time I ate at Manuels was for dinner. Yes, we were a table of 10. Yes, my aging grandmother was picky and needed everything \\"just right\\".

Lunch and dinner menu items are always amazing as well.  Now I will admit that I'm not too much of a fan of their migas -- it's not that they're bad, it's just that they're nothing special, IMO.

Everything needed salt. The curry sauce was VERY bland - salt is badly needed.  I think you might consider doing a mild and a spicy curry since some people seemed to like the mild but others such as myself would like more spice for sure. The breading on the schnitzel also needs salt and pepper. \\n\\nI had the Indian salad. It was just ok. I think I'd switch to red onions rather than white since you serve them raw.  The salad needed dressing in addition to the curry sauce. I suggest doing an oil and vinegar. I did this at home and it worked well.\\n\\nMy hubby had the Mexican wrap with avocado. He said it was bland and dry. Perhaps some salsa on there in addition to the chipotle mayo - that's how he ate it. At least use more of the sauce so the flavour gets into everything.  And he said it needed more cilantro. \\n\\nThe fries are indeed very good, but fries aren't the reason I come here, it's the schnitzel.  \\n\\nI understand your method with the schnitzel, but there's got to be a way to get more flavour on it. Heavier seasoning and season directly out of the oil might help. I noticed they were sitting for a minute before the seasoning was added.  I think simply adjusting the salt level might give it more punch across the board. \\n\\nI'm giving you 4 stars since you're new and I want everyone to try you out. You have a LOT of potential!

I'm glad we did because the line quickly extended way down the block. Once seated, we quickly ordered two Chocolate Potato Doughnuts (saved for dessert), Biscuits and Sausage Gravy to share and then Korean Fried Chicken for me and Tasty Steak & Cheddar Eggs for her. The biscuits and gravy were soft, warm, and savory which was perfect for the chilly weather. But our main dishes were fantastic! \\n\\nThe Korean Fried Chicken had large pieces of fried chicken smothered in the sweet yet spicy sauce topped with lots of kimchi and runny eggs over rice. Yasss! There has to be a legit Korean chef back there because this was amazingly tasty! Her Steak and Eggs were awesome too! Not only was the steak juicy and tender, the eggs light and fluffy, but the cornmeal pancake was just phenomenal! The texture and flavor is a surprising combination that just works in perfect harmony. You have to taste it to believe it.\\n\\nAll of the food is uniquely tasty and artistically delicious!

There are huge chunks of lobster with celery, scallion and a tiny bit of mayo. The rolls themselves were outstanding, buttery and toasted slightly. I placed an order for half a Maine roll and half order of their lobster Mac and cheese. The m&c has 5 cheeses in it along with chunks of lobster. I believe one of the cheeses is blue cheese which paired well with the lobster. Luckily the M&c wasn't a globby mess of gooey cheese...there was just enough. I also got a Sarsaparilla soda.

Upon our departure, she declared to me that it was the greatest meal of her life, and it may have been the greatest of mine too. \\n\\nThe room is small, secure, familial, and rustic. The atmosphere feels more as if you have been welcomed to an unassuming yet elegant dinner party rather than a pretentious high end restaurant. The congenial presence of the chef and his server add to this ambiance. \\n\\nWe began our meal with two housemade sourdoughs: a purple corn and a buckwheat. Each of these were scrumptious -- the kind of bread you must force yourself to skimp on to preserve room for the gastronomic delights to come. We were shortly thereafter brought some relaxing pre-meal champagne and an outstanding quince mead. The mead was subtle, even humble, without the overpowering sweetness of many meads. Truly incredible. \\n\\nNext up was a opening \\"salad,\\" in quotes as its creative flavors pushed the salad definition. It was a russet apple topped with ricotta \\"snow\\", chestnuts, and lovage. This deliberately small portion began our meal beautifully, skillfully blending flavors. \\n\\nSecond was the highlight of the meal for me, and possibly the greatest dish I've ever tried. It was a mackerel stuffed with a dash of fois gras, all atop a roasted squash and perigord truffle vinaigrette. There were only two bites of mackerel, but they were sublime. Really, I wish that I had more words to accurately describe this dish's exquisite exceptionality, but it was so high quality that I possess almost no reference point for such a description. \\n\\nThird was a sorghum braised carrot. Sorghum, I learned, is a midwestern take on maple syrup. There were two small bites of carrot, topped with bits of quinoa with a black garlic aioli to the side to be dipped in. Once again -- and you may be detecting a theme here -- this was an astounding combination of unique flavors, amalgamating into one delectable dish. The black garlic aioli was the star of the show here, really the proverbial icing on the cake of an already stunning dish. I would never had thought an ingredient such as carrot could so successfully anchor a dish of such flavor. \\n\\nNext up was a wild boar chop with parsley and hedgehog mushrooms. This began with permission from my server to use my hands to bring the bone to my mouth... in such a fancy restaurant. That alone made the dish fun as hell. Amidst so many other delicate, meticulous dishes, the opportunity to bite meat off the bone was a uniquely primal experience (of a dish that I'm sure was still very meticulously made!). In addition, this dish possessed an overall earthy tone that made it perfect to carry to midsection of the tasting.\\n\\nNext up in our meal was a roasted rutabaga with red cabbage and perigord truffle. Like the carrot dish, I looked up at my partner after my first bite and in an almost stupified tone, and said \\"I had no idea rutabaga could... do that.\\" The rutabaga had a gorgeous flavor, absorbing all around it, now accompanied by a wonderfully, slightly tart pinot noir. \\n\\nTo prep us for our dessert was a miniscule palate cleanser. This was a medlar sorbet, that oh-so-perfectly blended sour and sweet flavors. At first, your bite is nearly overwhelmed by the sourness of grape vinegar, but then rescued a second later by the strong but casual sweetness of the sorbet. Excellent, creative, and unique.  \\n\\nWe closed the dish with a dessert wine and a poppy seed tart.

Everyone in the restaurant steps outside during that time and watches the show on the patio, while they play the theme music on the speakers in the restaurant. \\n\\nThe key lime creme brulee is fantastic, along with the wasabi-infused ahi tuna.

I agree with another reviewer that this place doesn't make fresh pasta to order, but probably uses large vats of already-made pasta. The one negative is that when my pasta came out, it was too hot to eat. I had to wait about 7 minutes before I could eat it because it was probably over-nuked in the microwave, adding credence to another reviewer who said he never smelled any food cooking from the kitchen,  In other words, food being nuked in the back.

I gave them four stars for their no-frills, damned good curry.  \\n\\nFor at least five years, Teji's other location, in Round Rock, has been a small Indian grocery with an unassuming, adjoining restaurant.

I hear Teji's in Round Rock has been improving the restaurant side.  \\n\\nSo, I wasn't surprised to see them opening in the former location of the ill-fated \\"Rasta Pasta,\\" near 21st Street and The Drag.  The food here is as good or better than I remember from their Round Rock location.  It's a very narrow space, impeccably clean, with some holdovers from Rasta Pasta's decor.  The ambiance is nil.

Their system of ordering at the table then paying at the counter needs to be reconsidered.  \\n\\nI attempt Indo/Pak recipes almost weekly, but I'm no expert.  I do toast and grind my own spices, so when the menu says \\"fresh Indian spices,\\" I assure you that they're sincere.  I had the chicken saag, which was the perfect texture, with deep and earthy spices and just the right amount of heat.  The rice was plain, white basmati, which was a bit of a disappointment, but I wasn't there for the rice.  \\n\\nMy chai arrived late (did I mention they're still working out the kinks?), but it, too, was correctly spiced, with no raw notes or cheap cinnamon flavor.  Most important, however, was that it was almost completely unsweetened.  You can always put sugar in, but you can't take it out.  This was a thoughtful touch, from people who know what it's supposed to taste like.  \\n\\nThis is not a place for a romantic dinner, unless you're seriously bohemian.  Go early for lunch, because it fills up very quickly.  It's a loud place that will be hard to navigate when it's crowded, but the food will not disappoint.  \\n\\nPrices are normal to below-normal for The Drag.  The crowd is UT students and staff.

Since I actually bought into those \\"Don't Drive Drunk\\" ads that have been blasted at me for 30 years... I don't drink and drive at all. So this meant I had to walk to get dinner.\\n\\nSo my hotel was about 0.3 miles stumbling..... Er, I mean walking distance from my hotel. Seemed like a winner! I walked over and was met pretty quickly and was given a seat in the bar area.... I asked not to be in the actual bar area, and she politely told me I was not in the bar..... Uh, I was sitting at a high top table about two feet from the actual bar. Not a deal breaker.\\n\\nI watched several wait staff saunter by me, one of them eventually came to my table and asked me if I would like a drink!!! Wohoo!!!!! I asked for a spiced rum and coke. She told me they don't have spiced rum............... What?!?!?!?!? How can any bar not have a single spiced rum? She said she would ask the bartender. Sure enough, this tavern didn't have a single spiced rum. It had coconut rum but no plain spiced rum. I just don't know what to say, so I'll drop this topic now.\\n\\nThe waitstaff was friendly, not so much that I felt like 'home' or that they were getting a great tip. Just standard run of the mill, canned, typical Orlando tourist trap 'friendly'. Again, not much more to say...\\n\\nThis is where the review would turn to the fantastic food, easily making up for the shortcomings thus far experienced. They said they made everything including the ketchup (pointing to a bottle of homemade looking red suff). So this should be GREAT and I am sure that I am about to share without the amazing taste flavors I experienced. I said *would* turn to fantastic food, not DID. \\n\\nI was not super hungry so I just got a mac n cheese. They promised three cheeses with bacon... They had me. What was delivered to my table was not what I had led myself to prepare for.... To be honest, this could be that I allowed myself into thinking the food being great, and it was just not what I hyped it up to be. I don't think this is the case. I felt I was lied to, like my ex wife worked there lied to, not the little white lies normally given in tourist traps.... Full on, \\"I slept with your brother-in-law on our wedding night\\" lies. Yes, I meant to type brother-in-law - That is the kinda lie I felt this food gave me vs what was delivered. Full on Arkansas inbred love kinda lies.\\n\\nThe mac and cheese. I could not taste three cheeses, more like a block of that government cheese often served at my ex in-laws house. The shells were slightly under cooked, like I felt my ex brother-in-law's brain must have been slightly under cooked in the womb before he was hatched.... Not totally off - But enough to know that it ain't right.  \\n\\nThe one saving grace was the meat. I can't tell you what it was, but it had some flavor. Not much, but in a taste desert a man will take what he can get. I honestly would have preferred some unnatural yellow colored powdered 'cheese' (which I hear is honestly banned in the UK) kraft product with a liberal dousing of garlic salt.... Seriously, put garlic salt in your next batch.  You are welcome.\\n\\nI ate just enough of the meal to finish my non-what-I-wanted drink. Paid the bill and walked home.\\n\\nSo I:\\n1.

And although I wouldn't call Patrizi's \\"cheap,\\" the price point is super-reasonable for the quality of the food.

We put in our name and had some pre-dinner drinks in the bar area. There were barstools available at the Mozzeralla Bar, but we didn't want to watch people cook. We could have put in our name on the list at the main bar, but it was cramped and lighting was a bit strange, felt like sitting under heat lamps. So we enjoyed our drinks while waiting for a high-top table. Once seated, we selected a bottle of wine from the expansive wine list. I was especially impressed with the number of Italian wines that they offered, and not just the standard Chianti and Borolo selection. Then, tried a pizza as an appetizer. It was made with fresh mozzeralla and tomatos and was outstanding. They had several entrees that looked interesting, and I opted for the sirloin. Overall, the energy, menu, and food quality make Scampo worth visiting. The prices are a bit on the high side, but no more so than other fine restaurants in Boston."},{"name":"Bar Mezzana","address":"360 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Bar Mezzana was fantastic! \\nA perfect in-between of a quiet nice place with an exciting and busy ambiance. \\nWe elected for the tasting menu, which was delicious and well priced.

My boyfriend and I had a nice oyster flight of shells from MA to WA and NB followed by a split hot lobster roll in butter with a side of skin-on fries. My first lobster roll was more of an afterthought but the lobster meat was perfectly tender and seasoned.

The other members of the party ordered the braised lamb shank and seafood stew and both complained there dishes were \\"so-so.\\" Overall, disappointing experience and certainly not worth the price tag. 4 adults and only one person ordered a glass of wine, the bill was nearly $200.

The ambiance of the restaurant is very hip and trendy but not too intimidating. We came here for dinner around 6 and there was about a 40 minute wait. We ordered drinks at the bar while we waited so it wasn't too bad. The bar is SO COOL. The wall is lined with tons of different types of liquor and wines. There's actually a ladder to get to the top ones lol.\\n\\nAll the food is pretty good. We ordered a ton of dishes. It's all served family style and portions are pretty small and pricy. Fancy food so what can you expect right? Haha. We started with the foie gras and the duck duck potatoes. Foie gras was ok. Potatoes doe -- they're the real keepers. Topped with an egg sunny side up. I think they fry the potatoes in duck fat or something. \\n\\nWe also had the salmon, Montreal ribeye, cioppino and jacks meats (the charcuterie dish). They were all pretty good but the salmon was definitely my favorite. Delicious food but definitely pricy and smaller portions. We had a table of four so all of the food cost about $40 each which ain't too bad I think. The servers are also very friendly! Overall a solid place for some high quality food.

That price was hard-to-beat so I bought the following donuts:\\n\\nOrange Pistachio (V)- I've has this donut a few times and I think it is better in the morning as it tastes more fresh. In the afternoon, the donut tasted a bit stale. Would not recommend getting this in the afternoon. \\n\\nVanilla Bean (V)- This donut is amazing and is my favorite from Revolution. This donut was able to maintain freshness throughout the day and was not dry or stale by the afternoon. I also love this donut because it's light and I don't feel guilty after eating the whole thing. \\n\\nLemon Poppyseed (V)- This flavor is good but not as good as the Vanilla bean! \\n\\nPumpkin Spice (V)- I know y'all will think I'm super basic for saying this but this donut is amazing. It's a bit smaller than the other ones but very filling. The flavor is delicious and it is totally worth getting! \\n\\nMaple Bourbon Buttermilk Bar- I would probably skip this one next time. I was not a fan of the cake donut or the the icing. \\n\\nApple Cinnamon Fritter (V)- This donut was stale by the end of the day.
