WAVE is all over social media, and I've been itching to go for months. Every day, I ached over videos of their sushi donuts, loaded sushi fries, fluffy bao buns and so on. But let's face it- Mount Dora is out of the way for most people. However, it came down to picking a day and making the trek, and it was worth it. The restaurant is located on the second floor of a building in downtown Mount Dora, and wasn't too hard to find thanks to some signage that pointed us in the right direction. It's definitely a lot smaller than I expected, but we arrived on a weekday around lunch time and were able to be seated right away. I had previously looked over the menu, but still had a difficult time deciding what to order. Everything sounds amazing. We decided to make a collective order with my friend in order to share and try a few things. I had the pork bao as well as the krab bao, and she had the bulgogi bao. Our other friend ordered the lettuce wraps, and a kid's noodle bowl for our small human friend. Together, we shared the Dynamite Roll, a sushi donut filled with spicy krab, the sushi nachos and the amazing dessert baos (which they were oh so kind to make for us!). The pork bao was the best one I've had yet- the pork belly itself was a thick slice, and was cooked perfectly. The krab was buttery and comes with an extra side of dipping butter (haaallelujah). The sushi nachos are served with wonton chips, which are perfect and a preference in my book over tortilla chips. The donut was beautifully plated and tasted great, and our roll was torched and amazing. And of course, the dessert bao was the perfect sweet ending. As if all of that wasn't enough to guarantee an amazing lunch, the staff was absolutely stellar. Our server was incredibly patient and sweet, and she really interacted with our small human Victor- doing her best to keep him happy, and even giving him a great hug at the end. We were treated excellently by everyone at our visit, and based on that alone, we would be quick to return. Can't wait to plan another Mt. Dora day trip for this wonderful Asian Bistro!"},{"name":"Red 8","address":"1 Broadway","city":"Everett","stars":"3","text":"Food was all prepared fresh and was very flavorful !

Overall, the service is kind and fun, the atmosphere is distinctly a mix of Austin and Texan vibes, and the meat will just straight knock your socks off! Having been to the famous Franklin's bbq as well, Rudy's provides meat that is almost as good for a significantly shorter wait (15 min at most during lunch rush). That's what I call value.FOOD:\\nMy #1 fav meat is the extra moist brisket (really important that it's extra moist; don't skimp on this one, trust me). The brisket is soft and a lil fatty, just like I like it, and pairs awesomely with the sliced white bread and an orange soda. If you're feeling a little hungrier, get yourself a jalapeno sausage (hottie) or a normal sausage (nottie) or some ribs! If you're feeling a lil more health conscious (yeahyeah I get it, it's the new year), I highly recommend the chicken. Tender, juicy, and well-seasoned (ain't none of that dry chicken breast you leave in your oven for too long). To pair it off, I typically buy some potato salad and ask for extra bread (love me some carbs). If it's breakfast taco time (in austin, it's ALWAYS taco time), I also highly recommend the breakfast tacos. When I went to high school in Austin, I'd stop by and pick up two tacos for a breakfast treat (personally I like the chopped and pigs-in-a-blanket). SERVICE:\\nKiller service. The servers seem like a family. One time, there was a staff-in-training that was helping me, and she was awesome already. They make Rudy's feel distinctly Texan with their hospitality and distinctly Austin with their secret code words for meats. ATMOSPHERE:\\nAs I mentioned earlier, the base of the decor is Texan and the murals and the weird bathroom stickers make it distinctly Austin. Great for workplace outings or solo dates. Also, they have a camera in the waiting line for you to observe the sacred art of brisket slicing. My favorite piece of decor is the bags of water that they string above every table for the tables outside (in case of fire)."},{"name":"Torchys Tacos","address":"4301 W William Cannon Dr, Ste G-400","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"One of the best tacos you can get outside of a normal restaurant.

Well... *sniff* I guess that makes sense.\\"It's easy to write off shopping malls - suburban ones, in particular - as being on the verge of extinction. You'd be forgiven for assuming there's little that a dying suburban mall can offer, other than asphalt deserts with weeds emerging from endless cracks and craggy depressions that fall somewhere between pothole and sinkhole, wary ajummas that assume everyone wants to steal from them and yell at you for attempting to bring a drink into their boutiques, men's stores with unfamiliar and unpronounceable names devoid of vowels, and dollar stores where far too much inventory is priced greater than a dollar. Yes, it would be all too easy to paint most suburban malls broadly as being gargantuan fora suited better for Logan's Run larping than shopping for clothing or home goods.Northlake is a particularly depressing site. While Macy's remains for now, its other anchors are (predictably) Sears and JC Penney... and, until recently, Kohl's, which I've never seen anchor a mall. And, let's face it, since the end of Montgomery Ward, Sears and JCP are the last holdouts of most dead malls.But Northlake, like other dying malls, has a somewhat bright spot in its food court, and I don't mean the woman at Tokyo Express, waving the same piece of chicken at passers-by for 5 minutes, alternating between \\"Sample?\\" and \\"Amigo!\\" depending on their ethnicities. As the chains fled and new businesses filled some of their spaces, local entrepreneurs were able to take advantage of the slashed rent costs available in the dying mall. Cairo is one of these newcomers worth mentioning, because their food is remarkably good for a mall food court.Their kofta and gyro are better than¬†one typically finds in a location that doesn't face a tornado-simulation booth. Their warak enab are among the best dolmas I've had anywhere. Get the Vegetarian Sampler to try these along with very good tabbouleh, hummus, baba ganoush (and some not-so-great falafel). Delicious smoothies - mango, guava, or mixed (not sure why mixed costs more, but whatever) - are a great complement to the meal. Baklava is fine, but I'm eager to try their Ma'Amoul cookies, which have been unavailable each time I've visited.\\nAnd, of course... there are the potatoes. Buttery and savory, each bite melts in your mouth and sucks another week or two from your potential life span.\\nOn top of everything else, the guys working here are remarkably friendly and helpful. You'll wait longer than you'd expect for mall food, but that overpriced phone store isn't going anywhere (yet), so be patient.Suburban malls may be heading for extinction, but that's been the prevailing wisdom since the '70s and they're still here. I prefer to hope that many will remake themselves with the help of local entrepreneurs (most likely immigrants), and stick around for a while longer. And if that means more food court offerings like Cairo, then I definitely approve. So, the next time you put on your Sunday's best and go to Sears, or if that gemstone in your hand has started to flash, you could do worse than Cairo on your way to Carrousel.Overall, 8/10 (with food court handicap)."},{"name":"Taste of Peru","address":"9521 S Orange Blossom Trl, Ste 117 A","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food, great price!

I love the window seats here because you can look down onto Robson Street and people watch. Or car watch. There are tables by the window which have large comfy seats, so it's a nice refuge. We were seated right away and greeted by our awesome waitress. She came back within 5 minutes and we ordered our iced teas. We decided on sharing the california fish tacos-crispy chipotle-lime marinated cod, grilled whole wheat tortillas, shredded greens, guacamole and salsa fresca and we subbed the spring mix salad with yam fries. Our drinks came right away, and we were so thirsty that we finished it quickly. The waitress came within mintues, with a new iced tea, for both of us! This is probably one of the rare times that I got a refill without even having to ask for one. I was pleasantly suprised.The tacos were good, but I've had better. The cod was a little bit over battered, and there was a little bit too much cabbage, but the salsa fresca and the guacmole added something extra to this. (Maybe I'm just comparing these to La Taquiera tacos, and nothing will beat La Taqueira tacos!) Attentive throughout the night, our watiress came back with more and more iced teas, without us even asking her.

I've reviewed this place before and I honestly didn't think it could better than it already was. Alas, they've proved me wrong. I can see why this place does so well with the locals of Boston. The staff and especially the owner is SUPER friendly and accommodating. I've only been here twice and I've never felt a warmer welcome at any other establishment. So since I was back in Boston, I knew I had to come back to this place for their delicious biscuits with honey butter! We planned on going in around 12 and brunching it up. However, we thought we'd give them a call to ask for the wait and they said we could also make a reservation for a later time. We had no idea they also took reservations. So we decided to go around 3 PM for a nice, hearty lunch. Once we reached there, we had a bit of a wait as they were trying to accommodate a table for our party. The owner himself came outside multiple times to update us on how much time it would take and how much he appreciates our patience. As we made conversation, we let him know that we were visiting from NJ and made it a point to add Cafe Luna to our itinerary - especially for their biscuits. As soon as I mentioned them, he realized there aren't many left in the kitchen (I thought he was kidding) and he rushed back in to make sure they reserve the rest of the orders for us. Super sweet of him. We sat down and immediately got to scoping out the menu. I already knew exactly what I wanted as I fell in love with their open faced country biscuit during my previous visit. So my order was exactly that. Upon ordering, the server told me that they had no more biscuits and we got the last two orders, so I'd have to get my sandwich on an English muffin. In no time, the owner arrived at the table and said he had one extra order reserved for us and there were no issues! Needless to say, I was ecstatic! My food arrived fairly quickly and I was immediately in heaven. Everything was perfection. The biscuits, the jalape√±o cheddar sauce, and most of all - their seasoned fries. I'd say these were easily the show stopper. So much so that I ordered an extra side of them. Towards the end, the owner let us know that all the biscuits were on the house. We extended our utmost gratitude to him for being so generous throughout our entire visit and making us feel so welcomed. I drew him a lovely \\"we love Luna\\" sign with all of our names on it. The table covers are made of paper and you can doodle on them and ask them to hang them up for you - which he happily did. We said our goodbye and even had the opportunity to meet the chef, his wife - and rave about her delicious food. Definitely a dining experience I won't forget and rest assured that I'll always be back for more. Thanks, Cafe Luna! P.S. As usual, I never finish my food. So I took my leftovers all the way back to NJ the next morning and enjoyed my food at home, too!"},{"name":"Ceviche Tapas Bar & Restaurant","address":"125 W Church St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We went for their Tapas Tuesday special where select small plates and sangria are $4. Considering most of the plates offered on special were normally $6-8, it's a pretty good deal, and the selection is still quite substantial.The atmosphere is busy but still somewhat intimate in the dining area. It wasn't too crowded for 6:30 and it'd be great for larger groups (we were only a party of 4) - plus isn't group dining the point of tapas?So of course, you're going to order a bunch of items, and we went for a few veggies and a few meats. The roasted asparagus was wonderfully fresh, grilled just enough to give it a nice charred flavor without completely cooking it. Artichoke hearts were good, but the accompanying hearts of palm stole that show.The chorizo was pretty bland in the two dishes it was heavily featured in - the stuffed peppers and the 5-chorizo skillet. If you're looking for spice, this isn't the place. We had to get an actual ceviche dish to see if it lived up to the name and the tuna was wonderfully fresh, just enough seasoning that you could taste the lime but still also taste the fish.Chicken/ham croquettes were nothing special, would have paired them with another sauce besides the bechamel, which was a bit too sweet. The sauteed mushrooms had a wonderful garlic flavor, but I didn't catch the brandy or herbs. Fresh baked bread was provided (upon request after seeing it at another table) with an odd dipping sauce that was a cross between olive oil and herbs and a tapanede...flavor of the herbs but chunky like a tapanede minus the salt. Odd, but not bad. The babaganoush was nothing special, good but a bit light on the garlic.The star of the night, the thing I was anticipating the most and didn't even realize we got until we complained, was the chicken livers and mushrooms. I'm a fan of chicken livers, and the dish was listed as sauteed chicken livers, mushrooms and bacon. As our items came out (they come as they're prepped, so it's staggered) we noticed one odd tomato-based dish with mushrooms, onions, and delicious clumps of ground meat.We figured we got an incorrect dish as we were halfway through, but no one bothered to mention it because it was so delicious. The meat was rich and flavorful, seemed like it had been flash-fried because it was crispy on the outside even after sitting in a tomato sauce. At the end, we mentioned to the waiter we had not gotten the liver dish and he pushed an order through - when it was brought to the table my friends suddenly realized the winning dish of the night was indeed, liver. Tim, who was against it from the start, had just finished proclaiming that meat was the best thing he had all night. I call this a complete win, they had apparently mixed the bacon in with the livers to help offset the iron-flavor and it worked perfectly. If you hate liver, but love mushrooms, bacon and tomato, get this and you will like liver.Anyway, enough liver gushing, time to wrap this up. Service is okay, it's fast paced so you pretty much have to flag your waiter down for drink refills or anything. Don't bug them about not getting a dish until you're near the very end of your meal - things are served as they're prepped, so there's no telling if/when you'll get what you ordered. Do keep a mental note of what you order so you're definitely getting all you asked for.Prices are a bit high, but given the quality of the ingredients and location, it's not too horrible. Most plates (not on special) run about $8-12 and some do come in dinner portions, but sharing is just more fun.The full menu is available, too, so you can order some of their awesome desserts. The chocolate cake was rich and moist without being too dense and came with a delicious custard and raspberry swirl sauce. The creme brulee was a bit loose, but tasty although I didn't find it benefitted from the chocolate shell.

Maybe they should average each person's review history as a baseline and calculate the actual review star number value from that?? But I digress...)The delivery process did not disappoint at all.  The website is clean and easy to use, minus a hiccup where I had to re-enter all my choices after signing in.  I appreciated the ability to customize dishes and choose the number and type of utensils that we needed.  I am also in love with this idea of not fussing with tipping.  I could totally picture having this delivered to a park on a day that I don't want to have to pack sandwiches.In the future, I hope they come up with a lunchtime option that is smaller.  One dish is too much for one person.  A lunch portion with rice on the side would be nice.  But still, there was a 45 min wait (incl delivery time) at 12 pm on a weekday.  At 11:15 am close to when they opened, the wait was 10-15 w/ delivery.We tried out 5 dishes from favorite to least:\\nChicken & Eggplant\\nFried green beans\\nPotstickers (free with code TSODELICIOUS for the time being)\\nWalnut Shrimp\\nCrab RangoonsWithout a doubt, I would come back for the Chicken & Eggplant.  Eggplant is hard to get right without turning it into a greasy, slimy mess, and Tso nailed this.  The flavor was great.  Not too heavy, on the sweet side for Chinese (but this is Chinese American, so it fits), and there were enough but not too many onions & bell peppers in the mix to round out the dish.I would also consider the pork potstickers (good seasoning for filling, wrappers maybe a little thick for my taste) and fried green beans (lovely crispy texture, but unevenly and over-salted...I'd have to note it next time to go easy on the salt).I was not impressed with the crab rangoons, though it was a hit with the kids.  I liked the flavoring, but the gooey crab filling was too sweet and squishy for my taste.  Maybe that's the way it's supposed to be?  I'm not really a crab rangoon fan to start with...all the proclamations of \\"It's real blue crab!!\\" pushed me in.\\nThe walnut shrimp was also okay, but I would try something else first next time.  Because it's shrimp, the portion size is a lot smaller than the other dishes, and because it's walnut shrimp, there are no fillers to throw in to make it look bigger.

Here's what we got: (trying to be organized since we were hungry)\\n1. The lonza (ham) with chicarrones and pistachios and cherries. Make sure to get a bit of each to build a perfect bite. Wonderful flavor and texture pairings\\n2. Panchetta peach mint fried walnut and ricotta sauce. The mint is the star here and the peaches not far behind. The walnuts didn't really add anything for me but they're good on their own\\n3. The mussels. Wow that sauce is really good with the little ball pasta. And the bread to soak it all up for the win\\n4. Smelt chips. By far the favorite dish of the night. Kind of like boquerones (fried anchovies) with hot grilled lemon juice squeezed on top and a citrusy lemon aioli to dip in. \\n5. Sweet corn gnocchi. The sauce was good and the gnocchi was much denser than traditional ones but overall a nice plate.\\n6. Chicken fried rabbit. I was really excited for this one from all the press it's gotten but was disappointed. It was pretty flavorless and dry and the accompaniments on the plate weren't helping\\n7. The pork belly. Also disappointed, not as much as number 6, but the skin was nice and crispy. \\n8. The lamb sirloin. This was just weird. The spice they used was kind of offputting and the mashed thing on the side looked like turd. It tasted ok after a while but looks wise not very appetizing\\n9. Smoked chocolate bread pudding. Didn't really like the smoked aspect as much as I thought I would. But other than that it was good. This place just has a really good vibe and love the interior. Even though the last couple dishes weren't so hot, there were definitely things that would bring me back and encourage me to try other items. Like the secret burger! (Try to go before 8 pm.. But after me please! )"},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Stopped by for lunch. It has a rich Texas backyard interior vibe. The servers are polite and cordial. The complimentary popcorn is better than it looks and was possibly my favorite part of the meal. Somewhat reminiscent of Korean instant noodle spicy powder. Had chicken fried steak and jalape√±o hanger steak. The chicken fried steak was more meaty and heavy in gravy than in batter. Therefore not as crunchy. The steak was very tender and pleasant in texture. However the sauce wasn't as complimentary.

No, I'm not hungover from it being the day after St. Patrick's Day, so don't go there.  I'm feeling a bit like I got hit by a Mac truck, but somehow managed to drag my ass to Life Alive in hopes that all their wholesome awesomeness would help me to feel better.  I started off with a 2 ounce shot of wheatgrass...which I try to have as often as I can...it is said an ounce of it is the equivalent of 2 pounds of veggies...but that wasn't enough for me, being close to death, and all.  I then got the Jive Alive...a green juice with celery, random mixed greens, ginger, cucumber and lemon.I got an Explorer Wrap for later (see my previous review for its description)...I don't recommend this as a to-go wrap...by the time I got home it was an absolute mess...the beet juice totally saturated the wheat tortilla.The verdict...somehow, the wheatgrass shot instantly cleared my sinuses...I could breathe through my nose for 10 minutes, which was the best I felt all day.  I'd like to think that Life Alive's mix of organic fruits and veggie has magic, make you better qualities...but sadly, I'm back here on the sick couch.  Feeling like ass.  Close to death.

My chicken katsu curry came, warm, and katsu was covered in katsu sauce... which doesn't go with curry. And my girlfriends ramen came with a 'soft boiled' egg, which was a watery poached egg that looked more like a puddle of white liquid.

I've known about Soto as I had seen great reviews about their first location in Cedar Park/Lakeline. We never went to that one as it was a bit too far of a drive for us. They always have had great reviews and I was happy to learn that I didn't have to drive to Lakeline to try this place.  Anyway, we easily made a reservation on Open Table. When we arrived, it was quiet and we immediately got a table at the counter.  A few of the sushi chefs welcomed us and offered their help. Super attentive.  The service staff was equally impressive and overall Soto has a great atmosphere. We ordered wine from one of their 3 drink menus.  Their wine menu was limited but their sake menu was extensive.  We did not have any of their specialty cocktails but those looked interesting. Wine pours were a little small but that just falls in line with their portion sizes. The menu overall is good and has variety but it was expensive for what you actually got as well as it's limited. The drink menus definitely are bigger than the food menu.  The food that we did get was good, fresh and unique combos but just not worth the money.  I'm ok with paying for sushi but with small portions and smaller wine pours, the value is just not there yet.

Right behind the counter guy taking your order, you can see several guys carving the meats. Such a cool concept to watch the work being done as you make your order. You buy the meat by weight. I sampled the turkey and brisket, and the creamed corn, which, being from the North, I've never had creamed corn. This was really good and I had to get a container of that for sure. Okay, now, the taste of the brisket and turkey. Incredible! Absolutely incredible. I can't wait to try their baby back ribs next time I go. My favorite is the inside picnic tables.

Maybe it was their fast proliferation throughout Portland that made it seem like less than organic growth. Maybe it was the price to size ratio of their burritos. Either way, I never tried it until I went to an event at the EcoTrust building that was catered by Laughing Planet. They had a build your own burrito/bowl bar set up. To put it simply, the food was unremarkable at best. The two worst items were the chicken and beans. Both were completely flavorless. It was pretty much a catering tray of water beans. The chicken was dry and rubbery. You can't have a good burrito/bowl when two of the main ingredients lack flavor and texture. To their credit, the tofu was very good, but I don't handle soy well and I wasn't going to risk it. After that experience I swore off Laughing Planet.That was before this location opened up. Goose Hollow only has so many eating options and my coworkers wanted to give this location a shot. After being so disappointed with their \\"Mexican\\" fare, I did a 180 and ordered the Korean BBQ Bowl and a side of chips and guacamole. The total came out to about $14 without a drink, which is a bit much for grab and go office food. The bowl was pretty good, but for consisting of mostly brown rice, it was overpriced. If you're going to charge $10 for a bowl that is mostly rice, at least you can add real kimchi and not \\"quick pickles.\\" Although flavorful, the bowl was not super filling due to it being mostly rice, so I was glad I also got guacamole. The side of chips was a very large bag of chips, but I was aghast when I dug down and found what could only be called a thimble of guacamole. All I could thing of was the famous line, \\"what is this? Guacamole for ants?\\" Now the guacamole was good, but I finished it all up with just 5, conservatively guaced chips, thus leaving me with a massive bag of chips and no guac.! This was pretty disappointing for $3. With the lack of a lot of options in Goose Hollow, I'll probably end up returning here. The food is not bad, but a little on the pricey side for what it is.

I have held off just because they are a little pricey...This review is only for the service and the Sandwhiches I got - I cannot vouch for everything else lol.Yesterday afternoon I rolled in with my 6 year old who is very high energy and explorative!  We approached the counter and there are lots of options that seems to have lots of flavors too mature for a 6 year olds pallette so I needed to modify the Smoked Turkey sandwich.Originally it is smoked turkey, Gouda, spicy mayo, lettuce and dill pickles.  Oh yeah and bacon!  We don't eat pork anymore so I took the bacon off both Sandwhiches and subbed the Gouda for cheddar.  I kept the rest of the sandwich the way it came for myself and just ordered my son turkey and cheese.  They both came on sweet potato bread which by the way is super delish!While I was ordering my child was all over the place and the person taking my order was super patient, even though I walked away several times while ordering.After I placed the order, my son wanted to walk to the back.  It was pretty empty around 3:30 on Monday so I walked to the back with him.  The manager offered him a cookie as he strolled through the store but I already purchased one so I declined but that was very nice of him.When we sat to eat, all I kept saying was \\"wow! This is so good!\\", \\"Mmmmmm, mmmm, mmmm!\\". \\"WoW!\\" Lol.  It was definitely a flavor explosion and good balance of textures.  The pickles and lettuce added a nice crunch.  The sweet potato bread added a nice balance to the spicy mayo and fresh dill pickle combo.It was pricey though!  2 Sandwhiches and a chocolate chip cookie was $28!!!  It didn't even include chips or anything...

The only bright spot is the ramen bar, where the guy working there is friendly and quick and the food is pretty good.

Moonshine's has a great home feel.  The place is huge, but separated into smaller rooms/areas so you don't feel like you're in a huge restaurant.  There's a couple fire pits and an outside fireplace to enhance the ambiance.   We arrived about 15 minutes after opening, so virtually no wait.  When we left, there was a line to get a table.  Given the overall experience, I would anticipate there's typically a line.Upon being seated, our server greeted us and took drink orders.  A few minutes later, a bowl of popcorn is brought to the table.  We thought this was a nice start to the evening.  The menu is manageable from a number of options, but they all look so good that it was tough to make a selection.  We ordered the Chicken and Waffles and the Backyard Chicken sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries.  The Backyard Chicken sandwich is very good with tons of flavor.  The sweet potato fries were excellent with a little spicy kick to them.  With regard to the Chicken and Waffles...basically STOP THE PRESSES!!!   They were AMAZING!!!The Chicken is three boneless pieces.  The Chicken is moist and flavorful.  The coating is fantastic with a great flavor.  You receive a full Belgian waffle separated into the four pieces.  This isn't a normal Belgian waffle...it's made with cornbread.  This meal is completely OFF THE CHARTS.  In addition to your meal, they bring a basket of cornbread mini muffins.

Two restaurants have occupied the space Smoke Ring now claims on Nelson Street -  both now history.  The folks at Food 101 (the owners) are obviously hoping they can make The (don't forget the The) Smoke Ring into a long term and profitable tenant - and with a little fine tuning (and some paring of the menu) they may be able.The name says Barbecue.  The interior (reclaimed wood, brick) says Barbecue; a menu that offers hamburgers. chicken salad,  and grilled cheese sandwich doesn't. Never mind teeing up smoked Portabella Wrap or Blackened Ahi Tuna - no self-respecting pit master would allow such foolishness. Open for maybe a year now, The Smoke Ring has most of the standards when it comes to 'cue including the latest fad barbecue: pork belly.What they don't have is a signature sauce. They have three on the table which the sever (nice guy, great service, good recommendations) identified as Vinegar, Sweet and Smokey (it was neither) and Alabama White which would hard to describe beyond not being worth the taste.  The Vinegar and the S&S both had a tang about them, but nothing that said unique -   nothing making them memorable (think Williamson Brothers, {Pig-n-Chik, and Fat Matt's).Of the Big Four, the Brown Shoe Gourmet has the baby back ribs outpacing the pack.  Probably the thickest baby backs to be savored in an Atlanta barbecue joint.  Great smoke flavor (hickory, pure hickory, no apple, no oak, just hickory) all the way through with a nice rub. A half rack with a couple sides could fill two at lunch; that big.  The brisket and pulled pork tied for a distant second; the brisket having just enough flavorful fat to keep it moist and interesting, the pulled pork having that same good all-the-way- through smoke flavor, but a little dry.  The chicken finished a full lap behind.  Just not as good as the others.About the sides: their Brunswick Stew was a notch above average and served in good portion as part of the two sides with your choice of meat plates.  The slaw, while mayo based, was a safe shot from being too sweet and had a nice flavor. The baked beans were that and not much more; the three cheese Mac-n-cheese was fair to midlin,' the hand cut fries (another new, and welcome, trend in Atlanta 'Cue) were really good; there's no need to discuss  Brussel sprouts, crispy or not.  Why would a barbecue joint even consider offering such a foo foo food?\\n \\nWas told (by the people at the next table) that  TSR's Mississippi Mud Cake (with toasted marshmallows and Rock Road ice-cream) was \\"to die for\\" - assuming you're so inclined. And the waiter told us they have live music weekends.Good barbecue is hard to come by in the core downtown area... you can travel over to Daddy D'z, to Little Five Points and Fox Brothers and over to Hosea Williams for the delightful Anna's - all city classics, but  Aleck's Barbecue Heaven, once in the shadow of the stadium is long gone and now your option is The (don't forget the The )  Smoke Ring.

The wings were tiny but served with an amazing mango habanero sauce. The waffles were crispy, buttery and served with syrup and extra honey butter. We also ordered a side of grilled buttered biscuits ($2) which really seemed like biscuits from your local grocery store slathered with butter and grilled. Cafe Luna's food was satisfying but I will still say (imo) that it feels like they took pre-made ingredients from Star Market down the street and made great entrees by adding tons of butter.

I thought that must have been a good sign but when we got inside it was empty and only 4 people sitting at the bar. The music was so loud! But we sat down. There is no fish and chips on the menu, no fondue on the menu, just regular pub burgers etc. the reason I'm giving it 3 stars is the service. I asked the bartender about the fish and he got the cook to make it for us even though it's not on the menu. I had the buffalo chicken wrap and it was terrible. So goopy the salad was slimy, the sauce was too hot and I ate the chicken out of it. I'd say service was a 4. The food was a 2 and the atmosphere is a 1.

I thought it opened at 11am on a Saturday, so we ended up getting here around 11:15am, expecting a line.  However, it opened a little after 11:30am, so we did not end up waiting too long (we were the second party in line).  We tried the fried calamari, calamari salad, and aglio olio black pasta.  We debated on the Lobster Diavolo that people raved about but decided to go for the aglio olio instead.  The fried calamari was really good!! Fried so well!  We actually only decided to order this after we saw someone else order this first... food envy.  The calamari salad was also really good - the way they cook the calamari and the dressing they make (tastes like olive oil/ lemon) is simple but works well.  The aglio olio is just as good as everyone says!! Really good here - definitely recommended. Oh yea- and don't forget to bring cash! They don't accept credit cards.

We just got fountain drinks so yeah. When we were ready to pay and our waiter hadn't even come by to check on us until we sat around after eating, it took about 20 minutes to get our check because he \\"forgot\\" but seriously that's your job.

Also, I opted for the original Pok Pok location for my first time, for the real authenticity. My BF and I showed up at approximately 4:30pm on New Years Day. 4:30pm and there was already a wait of 35-45 minutes. OK, whatever, not terrible. I love that they take down your phone number so you can wander around SE Division while you wait. We were summoned by a phone call and returned. We were seated. It is tiny! Which explains the wait, but I love those types of restaurants. We ordered 3 dishes: Ike's wings, a carrot and parsnip salad, and the catfish noodles. Obviously I had to try the infamous wings on my first visit. They were awesome! So delicious, so much flavor and HUGE! I was so happy I ordered them. The carrot salad was so spicy! It was good, but I really couldn't eat much of it because my mouth was on fire. The Catfish noodles were a welcomed relief from the heat. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the ice cream \\"sandwich\\" we ordered for dessert. IDK, it was just strange, not a fan. But hey 3/4 ain't too shabby!

I had never eaten at a Chick Fil-A before 3 months ago.   (Hey, I'm from California.)  I was browsing at Half-priced books and saw the autobiography of Truett Cathy (Founder of the enterprise) in the bargain bin and I picked it up, knowing only that it was a succesful business and his picture seemed quite likable.   I vaguely recalled there was a Christian angle and despite being fairly ferociously anti-organized religion and particularly anti- Southern-Baptist-Conservative-hatemonger-Republican-crook and scallywag machine, I was still interested.   I like a good rags to riches story.  I was open-minded.  This sounds dorky, but, seriously I could not put the freakin' book down.  Truett Cathey is a marvelous human being.    He is all about charity and good works, and happy people and feeding the hungry and helping poor orphans and ohmygawd, I was impressed.   This is a REALLY GOOD man.   (not at all like the christians we hear about, if you know what i mean).   When he talks about god, its with a pure joy and celebration -- y'know -- the whole \\"god is love thing\\".   The whole vengeful nasty racist homophobic god is nowhere in sight.  Anyway, this guy has a tremendous rags to riches story that might just leave you teary at times.  I was inspired.  If you know anything about how franchises typically work, this one will blow you away because the business model is NOTHING like any other franchise.  Actually, its not technically a franchise. Now to the food.  OK, I'm inspired by the book so I have to try a sandwich.   I did.  Its a chicken sandwich.  It didn't dance and sing.   Its was pretty good for fast food and I did like the diet lemonade.  I had a salad later on that was bland but decent.    The people who work at Chick Fil A  are freakishly nice and friendly.   If you read the book, it all makes sense.   Is it going to make me run out and give up my heathen multitheastic ways?  No.  But it does give me hope that there are really truly good people in this world who are inspiring.\\n________________________________________oh...and I found out later....he is a friend of Jimmy Carter's, while one source said that he was a lifelong Dem, I found out quite the contrary:\\nThe founder of this restaurant does contribute seemingly exclusively to Republicans.  I was very very disappointed to see that he had supported McCain in the last presidential election, but he is not known for making big political donations - but he does lend his name to some very bad people.  On the plus side, he is known as a major philanthropist, giving millions of dollars to fight hunger, help kids, provide scholarships and other very very good things.

Down the hill and towards the back of a strip along BuHi. Kinda hard to miss from the main road unless you went looking for it. Plenty of parking spaces. Interior is definitely 90's date, and while the building has a boring vibe, the customers and staff keep it more lively. Even on a weekday night, there were a few large groups already there when we arrived for dinner. The server was very nice, and even taught us a few Korean words during the night. Food itself was great though not quite amazing level. Started with seafood pancake, which was full of greasy goodness. Dip it in some of the brown sauce they give it, and it tastes even better. Good variety of banchan. For a party of 4, we went with 3 BBQ entrees: regular bulgogi, brisket (Chadol Baegi), and pork bulgogi. The first one was OK, and definitely needed dipping sauce or the thicker bean paste to give it flavor. But I really enjoyed the latter 2. Spice on pork bulgogi wasn't even that high, so maybe I'll ask for more heat next time. Flavors were juicy, meaty goodness. I think I do prefer the coal flavor of cooking the meat v. a gas burner. I also like that our server did most of the cooking instead of me trying to guess my way around how to work everything. Oh, and they give you rice or lettuce to go along with the meat. The reason it's not perfect is because the portion sizes are a bit small compared to other BBQ places. So for the price you pay that starts a $23, not the best value. I felt satisfied after everything was gone, but certainly not full.

The Daily Catch is the place to eat in the North End. They have two employees; a cook and front of the house. They have minimal waste, your food comes in a frying pan, how cool is that? Not to mention, when we were seated, there was a shift change. The chef handed over the pan he was currently assembling to the new chef and he picked right up where the other left off. It was seamless. The clams casino and vongole neopolitan with littlenecks made me so happy. Clams are not popular in Nashville. You basically can never find them on the menu so if I go to a restaurant that is serving clams, I will order them. I would order them 100 ways if I could. These clams did not disappoint. The wine was also perfect and the bread spongy and perfect for dipping. Just so you know, the place is small and it's cash only. It probably seats about 18 people.

Get the canned seitan from Hong Kong market. Don't worry you don't have to cook it or even slice it up really. Just slather it in $1 bbq sauce from dollar tree And plop it on the plate. Buy firm tofu, drain any water out of it and cook it till it's super dry breaking up with spatula don't add any oil or anything to give it an eggy fee. Think dry crumbles. You can get a similar. \\nEffect by actually cooking scrambled eggs for 8 minutes to long on high heat. Then dump a lot of mustard powder on. Basically make it taste like mustard. Ok from that one block of tofu, throw about 1/3 on the plate.Toast, you know Texas toast you can buy at stop n shop. Make sure it's mushy. Put some Daiya cheese on the plate somewhere, I guess. Another side? Like home fries. Honestly I'm racking I brain I don't remember.... I don't think I got them, collards. Whatever it was I don't even remember I'm not saying this for effect. I don't. \\nWalk the halls in  Double Tree until you find a discarded room service tray with a microscopic bottle of Tabasco sauce. Use that to try to cover up the garbage taste of the canned seitan and sour \\"eggs\\" it won't be enough.  Coffee? You know.

He was too polite to say since I paid but he wasn't happy. We took him here thought he'd like it. I think he legit thought we were crazy for bringing him. The lady  got the same thing as me (we never do but we're both feeling it feels like something we don't make at home. )  Neither of us wanted to eat the eggs or seitan. I am not an overly picky eater and was seriously trying to Imagine if I only imagined Allston diner being good before. After all we almost never go because we go because there was always an hour wait.  I thought I was more picky. I imagined cool fun staff rightfully moved on to better paying jobs I don't expect most people plan on being servers forever. If they did good, I'm\\nGlad. I heard it wasn't quite that.  Maybe the cool tables after all these years were getting gross and there just wasn't anyone in the mood to make any more. \\nI did get a cool Vincent VanGogh mug and brother got a Ferrari mug so at least some mismatched mugs. Maybe not everything changed... idk. Just not sure.  This does feel like a blow tot the character of Allston and really, if Allston diner was hard to go to before, now it's not Even worth the effort if I could get a seat without waiting. ... Oh your paying though? How bout brunch at Whole Heart? it's a Tuesday? I'll pay for the Lyft to VegGal then. I figured it was just a fluke and the summer kids were out Boston gets slow.

The chicken, cheese and bbq sauce, pico de Gallo and cheese sauce is all poured on top of the mountain of chips. But once you eat that top layer that is oh so yummy, you are left with a pile of naked nachos.  They get a straight up 2 stars on the nachos and it would have been an 1 star if they didn't taste as good as they do. Now to the wings, $12, I eat a lot of wings as it's a personal favorite. These get 3 stars for average wings, they are not traditional buffalo wings. They are a variation that is smoky and medium hot. They taste good and my Wings were a good size but they aren't crispy as advertised on the menu. They aren't bad but they aren't fabulous just good. The fries were very good; seasoned, hot, and crispy. I will come back, we're local so they will get a second chance. I will update my review whenever we decided to give Ford's Garage a do-over.

I had to wait until my third trip to really give this place the rating it deserved, and I still feel like I am shorting it a star. The minus one comes from the small space, sometimes pretentious staff (although our server last trip was awesome!), brutal wait, and fairly high prices.Many of the downsides are quite well offset by the strong up-sides.  The curries here are replete with sour, bitter, and otherwise commonly spicy flavors found in the curries in SE Asia. These flavors are usually muted out in standard Thai food as they can be offensive to the western palate. Instead, most Thai places feature sweet, gravy-like curry - which is good in it's own right, but tends to lack the depth and complexity of a real, badass Thai curry.  Not here. This is true SE Asian Curry (not restricted to Thai flavors, by any means).The chicken wings here are a real treat.  Yum Yum (I mean Pok Pok) is not afraid to use fish sauce LIBERALLY.  The wings are glazed in a sweet fish sauce and cooked to a perfect sticky-crispiness. There is nothing quite as delicious as grilled fish sauce. It's not as fishy as you would think, but it adds a depth that offsets the sweet/spiciness of your usual wings sauce.  Simply downright amazing. One of the best dishes I consumed in all of 2007. The khao soi curry-noodle soup was amazing - a light, coconut-spicy curry broth, which gets closer to what would be expected from your normal Thai shop.  Yum Yum does a great job of not blowing out the lemongrass flavor, instead allowing the sweetness of their hand-pressed coconut milk to gently play off the hot chili and hints of kaffir lime and lemongrass. Mmmmm. (oh, and it's vegan - not sure HOW they make such a good curry paste without shrimp paste, but I guess that's why they're running the successful restaurant, and I am in law school). The beef salad is a delicious combination of spicy, sour, mint, and herbal.  Eaten with sticky rice, it's an intense culinary adventure. I found it to be a tad watered down on my most recent trip, and I hope that's not a trend, because in it's original form, it's a quite flavor-blasted. Not for the feint of taste. Supposedly, pretty much everything marked on the menu as vegetarian is actually vegan (according to our server), which was a VERY welcome surprise to us.  Come early or make a reservation (for 6 or more). Avoid the oppressive wait.  Also, a limited menu is available for take out from the little shack.  The roasted chicken and the curry soup are both on this take out menu. I have found some new lunch take-out crack!Recommendations:  chicken wings!!!!!, beef salad, roasted chicken (can be hit or miss on how dry the chicken is, but the dipping sauce is simply divine), som tum, pork curry, herbal salad, curry-noodle soup, hot toddy, gin+kaffir lime+tonic.Avoid: The old-fashioned (drink), the catfish (good, but not great, for the price), arriving at peak hour (you're gonna WAIT!).Bring: A warm jacket if waiting during the wintertime. Fortunately, they have a few tables with heaters for the wait, so if you can get one of those (and a cocktail) while waiting, you're golden.Yum Yum Yum Yum Yum."},{"name":"Allston Diner","address":"431 Cambridge St","city":"Allston","stars":"3.5","text":"So sad to see my favorite breakfast spot in Allston go downhill.

I arrived around 6:20pm and it was not busy at the moment.  As you can see in my previous reviews, I am regular here.  I been coming here since 2008.  When they offered a Nori Nori discount card and you got to eat there for free on your birthday. \\nI know the previous visit, quality of food and variety has gone down a ton.     I always hit up the snow crab legs when I first get there, what a wonderful surprise for a $31.99 buffet, it was empty. (I remember the days when the crab legs were stacked sky high) and they they never ran out.  I decided to make my way to get some hot food and hopefully the crab legs come out by that time.     I was looking for the oyster rockafella and could not find it. I guess they took that off the menu. You figure with prices increasing, they would keep some of the crowd favorite.     I went to the udon/hibachi section. As always, nobody there to help.  I waited for 5 min and said f-- this crap.  I went back to the crab legs and still nothing.  I told one of the employees if they could bring some more crab legs out please.        I went to my table to set everything down and then I see an Asian lady with 2 plates of crab legs. I was like Yay!  The new ones are out.  I get back there and come find there are a few legs left knee again.  Fml!!   Either the lady got all of them or somebody else got a ton too. It was literally minutes. I gave up on the crab legs other than getting a few tiny legs from the bottom. Definitely not $31.99 worth.     Hibachi no longer offers scallops they used to.  And if you get them to cook, it's a super tiny portion.       The crawfish was horrible. Tasted like ones from the $10 Chinese buffet in Duluth. Not sure what they are thinking!     I finally got some more crab legs like 1 hour into the meal but was semi full at this time.  Desserts are still decent.  I am glad they still have the green tea ice cream. I am sure oneday, they will get rid of it and jack the prices up to $35.99.    Fast forward to the 24 hours later.  Severe diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, and stomach pain. Not sure what made me sick there but my stomach usually can take anything I put in.  I haven't felt like this since I had food poisoning at Disney World back in 2007.   I had to call out to work and stay in bed all day.  I am currently writing this review in bed as I haven't been able to get out of bad from being too sick.     Customer service was okay. Some guy came around to ask us if everything was okay and I didn't feel like getting into it.     I also had to find somebody to make me some crepes. It seems all of their stations are not manned and you need to go beg something to make them for you.      I am not sure what to say but I am doubtful that I will ever be back again. The crab legs were not fresh and hard to pull the meat out.    I don't recommend this place unless you just want to throw your money out the door and never get to eat some crab legs.  I am going to save you some money and go to the market to buy you some crab legs to cook. It will be a lot cheaper too.    Bathrooms has no paper towels either.    I am not sure how this place is still 4 stars.     To the manager/owner:  You guys got to stack the crab legs higher.  You can't just bring a tiny portion when your charging $31.99.  And get people to man the stations.  I understand your method for the crab legs so you can save more and spent less.  Your just going to turn your regular customers away by doing that.   As far as getting sick and losing a day of pay at work.

They tasted more like oversalted Korean barbecue lettuce wraps than maki rolls.The seared moulard duck breast was also overcooked and oversalted. The duck meat was tough.The bill came to $200 plus tip for four people. For that price, you can eat better food at Uchiko happy hour. Perhaps they should serve an exclusive menu of raw fish so they can't overcook or oversalt it. My husband, sister in law, and her boyfriend walked over to Shake Shack afterwards and ate a burger. My mouth tasted like it had been salt gargled. I went home afterwards and ate steak. The next time we can't get into Uchiko, we're going back to Eurasia."},{"name":"Allston Diner","address":"431 Cambridge St","city":"Allston","stars":"3.5","text":"It's such a unique and cozy place to have brunch at!

It's in a great area of Boston right across from my favorite park in the city - the public garden. I went on a warm day and sat outside. The tables and open patio make it feel like you're actually at a cafe in Paris.The waiter was nothing special, nice but very unforgettable. The beat part of the meal was probably the olive oil served with the bread. We started with the tuna tartare and I was hesitant to even try it because it had so much liquid at the bottom. I reluctantly put some on the store bought rice cracker it was served with.Yuck.Absolutely disgusting.The tuna tasted old and was very dark, not chopped well. We just ate bread to get the bad fish taste out of our mouths.I got the Croque Monseuir and my friend got the Eggs Benedict - nothing were awful but nothing special. My croque was mostly ham when it should be mostly cheese. Both bread in both our dishes was tough.The greens served with each were good.I'll probably try this place again because of the patio and ambiance but maybe just for a glass of wine.Disappointing."},{"name":"Sweet-Stack Creamery","address":"25 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This place really has the best ice cream.

Last week I came through the drive-thru and ordered a 12-count meal w/large vanilla iced coffee. I do also have the calendar card and this month's \\"mystery offer\\" is their new BBQ chicken sandwich (or so I was told-twice. But we will get to that) Drove away and started drinking the coffee and it was terrible. I called them right away to inform them that the syrup might be bad so they should check it, spoke with the manager and she wrote me down for a free coffee my next visit.\\nFlash forward to today. Picked my sister up from work and came across the street for lunch. Ordered the mystery offer (in which the employee validate once again that it was the BBQ chicken sandwich), the large iced coffee, and a large fry. Came to the window, gave the lady my calendar card, my receipt from my last purchase to get my coffee, and then my debit card. She told me the total was $7.55 and she swiped my card. She saw my confusion and said \\"The mystery offer is an ice cream cone\\". Really? I told her no it's not and refused to take my bag, the guy validated while I was at the board and last week while I was here. The manager came over and says \\"I'm sorry, but it has changed\\". She didn't even try to sound helpful or \\"sorry\\" in any kind of way. I told her she can go ahead and take that sandwich off and she gave me a receipt for the money back on the card. \\nAs a manger, you would think that you would properly communicate with the rest of your employees that there has been a change in the mystery offer; if you have the order already in, the sandwich already in the bag and being handed over, you should honor it. But instead, you throw the sandwich away and ask me if I want a damn ice cream cone.

When we showed up and not being Chinese and dressed in fancy clothing we were ignored even while many expensively dressed Chinese kept being showed to tables. Out of curiosity, I decided to wait for half an hour to see what happened. I then went to the hostess and asked that we be sat at a table. She grudgingly called a waiter, who seemed to be displeased to not have to deal with non-Han people. I picked up the Chinese language menu handed to us, but could not read any of it and so asked for one in English. The prices for similar items (my partner is Chinese from Henan) were actually much, much more expensive than those in the Chinese menu. The waiters ignored us and it took forever to be attended to and then the food took forever for us to be served. Clearly, we were unwelcome because we were not wealthy Han people.Compared to many of the cheap eateries in Chinatown, the food was really was of rather poor quality, with bland flavours, and very expensive, to boot. There was a dearth of succulence and savouriness, with some dishes having had too much sugar added to them. The sate was rather dry and the deep-fried prawns greasy with the tempura having a flavour as if the deep-dry oil had not been changed for a couple of weeks, at least.Needless to say, we will not be back there every again."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Made a reservation based on the recommendation of a friend and was not disappointed.

The steak came out medium well no pink; I had to wait a while for the waitress to come back to me I had already finished the grits was just waiting for her to come back to ask for them to re-do the steak. The steak came out again with the middle two pieces being medium rare; the rest was well done again. The waitress came by again and saw it said she was sorry saw that it was not cooked right again was clearly frustrated the kitchen didn't get it right again. I simply didn't want to wait again; it definitely had a lot of flavor just not cooked to my liking. The green chile cheddar grits were some of the best I've had; highly recommend ordering them as your side. The waitress did right by me and took half off my meal which to me is going above and beyond.

The food a couple nights ago just didn't match what I'd had here before. My steak was overly salty, and I didn't love the texture. I don't generally leave behind any steak on the plate, but I contemplated stopping 2/3 of the way through my ribeye. My dad has always been wary of tougher parts that he calls \\"gristle,\\" but I've never seen him spit out five pieces at a nice steak restaurant. I felt a little embarrassed that I'd brought him. He may have sensitive teeth now, but something was clearly up. He also told me after the meal he thought his steak was too salty. Our twice-baked potato also wasn't that good. They give the impression that it changes daily (And thus would be prepared daily, right?), but this one tasted like it had been in a fridge for a LONG time before being cooked. Very caky, not very fresh tasting and the bacon could have been from Bacos. They did give me a free piece of cake for my birthday and the waiters were extremely nice and attentive. I've actually written more than one draft of this review because I wanted to be careful not to come down too hard on what I've otherwise found to be an excellent restaurant. I'm sure I'll be back sometime. But considering you can easily pay more than $40 for each piece of  meat, I'm not going to put up with much deviation from perfection.

La Luna has become the go-to spot, the reliable and funky cafe with internet access, friendly staff and a mellow atmosphere for a couple hours (or more) of work.  All the food is priced well, with many sandwich and salad options, and a whole case of gelato.  I had a salad once - spinach with tomato and bacon - but don't really come here to eat.  For me, by far the greatest treat at La Luna is their Chai.  If you like chai, you need to try it here - they grind up all the yummy spices and flavors fresh, and mix with black tea and generously foamy milk, and it's like heaven in a glass.  Even the iced chai is amazing - with soy milk, it's the closest thing to a chai shake you could get.  One of the few things I crave, to be honest.  Coffee's also good, and pastries look nice, too.It's never TOO crowded in the daytime, and if the weather's nice you can sit outside.

Terrible experience from start to finish. The girl at the ticket check in counter looked at our tickets and simply said \\"wait here I have to see if it's ready\\" we waited a few minutes when she came back out and just handed us two menus and walked away. We assumed this meant we could go in so we did. The seats were reasonably comfortable but not better than the AMC Dine in theaters. We ordered an appetizer, two entrees and a kids meal. After a while the two entrees arrived but no appetizer and no kids meal. We waited 10 minutes and then I pressed the red call button. Five minutes passed and a waiter can over and asked what the trouble was, I explained to him that we did not receive the appetizer or the kids meal. He turned off my light and said \\"I'll check on it\\". I waited another ten minutes and still nothing. I went down the the waiter station and asked to speak to a manager and waited another 5 minutes for him to arrive. I explained to him the situation and he asked the girl to bring it up on the screen to which she replied \\"oh, apparently they didn't enter those yet\\". The manager apologized and said he would take care of it so I went back to my seat. ANOTHER 10 minutes went by and he brought us the appetizer and said the kids meal would be \\"2 more minutes\\". I guess by 2 minutes he meant 10 minutes because that's how long it took to receive the kids meal. So basically we ate in the order of two entrees, the appetizer and then the kids meal.

When we decided to have lunch, we checked our map and this was the closest place to us.  It looked new and clean and the menu was basic... hamburgers, chicken, salads, etc... a bit of something for everyone.  Funny thing that was missing from all the menus outside and even right inside the restaurant... no prices.  Not until you got in line and were looking up at the menu behind the counters were there prices. 8 to 9 dollars for a burger... just the burger.  The place was not that busy (around 3pm) and the line inside split in two.  Both sides sell the same food so don't worry that one side has something different than the other.  We ordered a cheese burger, a chicken sandwich, a beer and a water... it came to $30 dollars.  You would think with all those grills in the place, you would get a fresh hot meal but no... the burgers and chicken were all pre cooked and sitting in trays next to the grill.  When we ordered our food, they had pre made plates of tomatoes, lettuce, pickles, etc and slapped on a bun, meat of choice, and a slice of cheese (not nicely melted on the food on the grill) and added fries.  That was it... they just slapped it all together and handed it to us.  Cold.  When my partner ordered his beer, she poured about half a cup and then told us she ran out of that type.  She offered to pour a different type of beer or my partner could come back later when they got it working again for the other half of his cup.  Really?   He opted to just have a different type.  When we found a table to sit at, I started to eat my burger and found the bottom to be soggy from pickle juice and water that was on the bottom of my plate.  Yuck.  That comes from pre assembling things on the plates instead of making it fresh as ordered.  I know they are trying to serve as many people as fast as possible but that was a major turn off.  Anyway, our food tasted just okay but I am will not be going back to eat here again.

Located across from brownstone townhouses and trees, this little section reminded me of Little Italy, although there was just this one Italian restaurant! With a little imagination, and a glass of wine, I was transported to my roots. To start I ordered the Caprese salad. Since it's not tomato season I was concerned, but when my waiter told me they used heirloom cherry tomatoes, I didn't hesitate. Cherry tomatoes are sweeter, and in my opinion, make a better Caprese salad. The Caprese Salad arrived looking like Heaven on a plate! Fresh mozzarella was surrounded by sliced red, yellow and orange cherry tomatoes, swimming in deep golden olive oil with lots of chopped basil, salt and pepper.  Vibrant and gorgeous, it tasted as good as it looked!!! So happy I ordered this to start.  It was so satisfying, it could have been my entire meal.For dinner I intended to order the Linguine Squarciarella, their version of pasta carbonara. At the last minute I vent for the lasagna. It was good, but not great. Theirs is made with noodles layered in a veal and beef ragu, with a bachamel sauce. I like ricotta in between the noodles, along with all the other stuff, to separate the noodles and add a different texture and distinct cheese flavor. Piazza Italia's lasagna was more like noodles layered in meat sauce. Next time, and there will be a next time, I'll get the Squarciarella!  Inside, the restaurant is packed with tables. There is no bar to sit at, and I wish there was since I often go to dinner alone and the bar is the perfect place to sit and meet new people. The ceiling is covered with soccer jerseys. I assumed there would be a tv blasting but there wasn't. Wait staff was friendly, offered suggestions, and was very efficient, always making sure my water glass was refilled, and checking to make sure everything met my satisfaction. Looking forward to my next meal, sitting on the street with a view of the brownstones and trees, watching the people go by, glass of red, a bowl of pasta - for me, that's as good as it gets."},{"name":"Kiku Japanese Steakhouse","address":"3630 Marketplace Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Honestly, not the best sushi I've ever had. I ordered the yellowtail, eel, and salmon. I also had the Camp Creek roll. The Camp Creek roll was pretty tasty overall, but there's a lot of cream cheese in there. It's fried with smoked salmon, eel, crab, and avocado. It's be a lot better with little to no cream cheese. The cream cheese just kind of takes over and you lose a lot of the awesome flavor combinations. About 1/3 of the way into the roll, I had to add wasabi in gobs to give it more than just a creamy texture and sweet flavor. The eel was ok, but it was mainly just sweet from the eel sauce. One of the crazy things, is that the portions of fish to rice on the sushi is actually pretty good, but it was like it didn't have any impact.The hamachi (yellowtail) was the most flavorful piece that I had. It came with a topping of finely sliced green onions. I liked that one plain and with soy sauce.The salmon was creamy and fresh, but again there wasn't really any impact to the sushi. I can't really nail down exactly what it was, but I can tell you that it just wasn't as good as other places that I've been.The fish, itself, was fresh. The artistic design was there. I just sort-of walked away feeling like it wasn't worth it in an overall sense. I'll probably go back and give them a second chance, but only because I'm down there every day of the week.

The fried pork dumplings could have benefited from a quick blotting before being brought out to our table, but instead they were sitting in a pool of oil. The crispy beef was by far the best dish, crispy as advertised, but the broccoli was not fresh. Also ordered the string beans with pork and pickled veg-- which are just used as aromatics for the stir fried beans. They were burnt but the green beans were okay. The two bowls of rice were crunchy on the outside and mushy in the center- how is that possible?

Well, I never have a problem paying a little more for some good food but I can't help but think they need to raise the bar on their service. Let's start with the fact that all of their employees are very friendly but seem inexperienced and spread thin on their tables. The hostess stand has the whole deer in the headlights look going and certainly doesn't add to the welcoming experience. I have been here when it is on the slow side and during peak hours and this stays pretty consistent. Pretty much the only let down but a constant struggle to overcome every time I think I want to dine here. Even tonight our server took 20 minutes to bring water to the table, even though she turned in a drink and ap order. Then she went MIA for another 15 before taking order. Someone else other than your server always brings the food. Just a different approach I suppose.The food however, is pretty top notch in my opinion. I always find something new to try yet want to share the best of the best when dining with people who haven't experienced True Food yet. Prices are on the high side but they do offer sustainable and organic product.

First, coffee. The coffee is good. Real good. I got a vanilla caramel latte. The barista/bartender asked how sweet I wanted it (ummm super) and she made me one of the best lattes of my life. No issues with customer service - I've seen a couple reviews that noted their experience was pretty poor.Later that same day I came back with some friends for drinks. I had a watermelon margarita and martini. Both very good. Strong. The customer service was ok. We sat ourselves - and again after reading previous reviews - I asked if there would be a waiter and we were told there would be. They all work together. The male server/waiter was on point. The female took our empty glasses, but then never asked us if we wanted another drink. The male waiter came back and took care of that. It was weird because she was a waitress - I saw her taking drink orders from other tables. We ordered a cheese plate - don't. It was below average cheese with 4 crackers and a handful of grapes for $13. The decor is very \\"fixer upper\\" style - which I love! There are TVs inside and a nice patio outside.I give you a 4 Nates because there is no bar food (all prepackaged sandwiches) and the evening customer service was a little off.

They were delicious, unique and the presentation of every one was exquisite. We nearly consumed the whole list with a group of six ladies and there was not a bad choice. My only advise is to not waist time or calories on the appetizers or rolls. My #3 roll was good but next time I go I will only order nigiri and a lot of it!

My parents are elderly and slow. They both have severe health problems: dad uses a walker, and at the time, mom, was in a wheelchair. I drove separately and arrived first. The host was hesitant seat me even though the crowd hadn't started yet. About 7 minutes later, I looked outside and saw my dad struggling to get my mom oUt of the car into her wheelchair, just as the manager approached me a second time to hassle me. Both times I had made it clear that my family were on their way and were elderly and slow. She did her best to fake sympathy then walked away. That was our FIRST VISIT! The second wasn't much better. And the third was just me and my dad.

It isn't a very spacious area and we were right next to another party of 2. Our waiter was really attentive and great at explaining the dishes we had questions about. We shared the Ike's Fish sauce wings (they offer spicy or not spicy; we opted for spicy and these wings are huge!), boar collar (which was REALLY spicy; if you hate spicy food do not get this, otherwise it's an interesting dish to try but don't say I didn't warn ya!), the clay pot noodle dish with pork belly & shrimp (which I definitely recommend!), and a side of jasmine rice. For the spicy dishes, we got a side of greens under ice to help cool our tongues down and gobbled down water at the same time. Phew! What an experience! I don't think I have ever encountered spicy dishes with that kind of intensity before. At the end of our meal we were pretty full and took the rest of the fish sauce wings home.Service was really good and fast, since I guess they're used to how long people wait here they are able to get people in and out the door.

Over the years I have had great help and suggestions from people in the tech book department, the kids' bookroom and the sci-fi room (among others).The mix of used and new books turns out to be a big asset, too. I tend to buy mostly new books but at Powell's they are mixed together so I often end up saving money by purchasing a good condition used copy that is indistinguishable from its new neighbour.Maybe those savings are offset by the scale of my book gluttony...but it is hard to feel like buying a dozen books is overkill when you are surrounded by what feel like millions!!

Honesty.Do you like sushi and seafood? Are you an adventurous eater? Are you consistently a 3 or 4 course diner when you eat out? If you can HONESTLY answer \\"yes\\" to those three questions, you will have a tremendous meal at the lowest possible price.I am frankly baffled by any complaints the about the quality of the sushi, or sashimi for that matter, which many sushi \\"experts\\" never seem to mention.Yes, we all miss the fun, relaxing give and take of sitting at a bar as the chef whips up our next order. But in exchange we get an absolutely dazzling variety of clean, elegant sushi executed with a flair, not aimed at the lowest common denominator as you might expect. Hence bouncy cups of salty fish eggs, unagi that disappears quickly (only to be re-supplied magically), a rainbow roll with apple, or basically 15-20 maki rolls that would go out as $13  \\"specialty\\"  rolls in most sushi joints in the area -- and deservedly so. (I will note that Nori seems blessedly resistant to gooping up its maki with fatty, sweet sauces.)And that sashimi? Like mainlining the ocean. Incredibly fresh mackeral, tuna, etc with just the perfect garnishes available for you to dot on. In fact, the revelation for me was the extent to which you could make a meal out of a nothing but sashimi and the cold salads. The scallop cerviche -- giant chunks of scallop with picked cukes and sweet peppers -- might've been the single best thing I had.But you couldn't ignore the oysters on the half shell then could you? And the first wave crowd we dined with (5pm on a Sun is GO time) surely did not. We are talking guys getting 8-10 oysters at a shot. Pretty much the same for snow crab legs, which are served cold and are incredibly popular.The hot dishes were also a couple notches above standard fare, starting with a baked white fish that was easily a $17 entree in many places. The tempura was very light and non-greasy and the breaded shrimp very popular with large kid audience among the early birds.The teriyaki chicken was nicely done, as were the tender beef ribeye skewers and the fried (but not greasy!) rice. But clearly seafood is king here.Desserts? Plenty but why anyone would want or need more than a couple spoonfuls of soothing, tart green tea ice cream admittedly escapes me.Nori Nori is not for everyone. Nor is it a once a week haunt, you'd die. But as a semi-special occasion -- especially after a day of physical activity -- it is very hard to imagine how you could do better. Do not fret about \\"eating up\\" to the $30 price point -- if you pass the honesty test you will easily double that number.

With Arthur Avenue and Little Italy nearby we have become accustomed to not only great food but also the warm, family atmosphere that is prevalent as well! For over 20 years I've been on a quest to find such a place in Florida and today we found it! \\nI've been trying to get to this place for awhile because I had a feeling by talking to the owner online and seeing the pictures of food that this place was special. We were met at the door my owners Jeff and Isabella Morgia like we were long, lost family! They gave us a tour and then sat and chatted with us while we feasted on there scrumptious cuisine! Now, this is not a fancy place, it is in a little strip mall and the tables, chairs and place is decorated nicely with a huge red back wall filled with family pictures and memorabilia from their life together! Right away you feel at home! The huge old Motorola radio on the side with \\"La Famiglia Room\\" above it lends to the warm, charming atmosphere here! The menu is done nicely with beautiful pictures and easy to read layout! Isabella explained all our options and we were good to go after a toast of vino for all! Saluti! We started with their memorable baked mozzarella which was served in a robust sauce with garlic toast! I fell in love with this dish and  wanted to dunk everything in it! It was like the best part of the best pizza you ever had in a bowl!! Next up was the creamy fried polenta balls that were done perfectly! These too, I dunked in the above sauce!  The calamari was the best I ever had, so fresh and good served with a zesty sauce! We loved the salads served as well, the Caprese  salad with chunks of fresh mozzarella and cherry tomatoes and the other was the Stoppe salad with tons of feta cheese, onions and both had a great home made dressing! Now for the main event... the meatballs! Before I get into the meatballs that were served, I need to explain a little bit of Jeff and Isabellas' background. Isabella's family has had six family owned restaurants in Orlando for years and she grew up in the restaurants! Jeff had years of experience in the business end of the Burger King Corporation.  When they met, Isabella had her own successful catering company and with Jeff's meatball concept, they created this Phenomenal concept!!  With Jeff's brilliant business mind and ideas and Isabella's star personality and recipes they have become a smash hit!!  ( Be watching for a second location opening soon!) They served us the \\"Meatball Flight\\" which is a choice of 5 of their 13 meatball varieties. One meatball was better than the next and I can't wait to go back and try the rest! \\nThe rundown was  Nona's traditional Italian, Crab, chicken Marsala, chicken buffalo and my favorite, the sausage and pepper meatball! They were tender yet firm and each were flavor packed and full of love! I can't wait to try on my next trip there the gator, chicken parm, mediterranean lamb, Mac and cheese and veggie meatballs as seen on the \\"Diners, Drive Ins and Dives\\" Show by my pal Guy Fieri ! This was not the end folks! We had their  layered eggplant, full of tender eggplant, cheese and sauce like a lasagna! The creamy polenta was exceptional and my favorite, the white bean ragu, which you could use on your pasta or like I did, eat like a soup it was so hearty and delicious! Even their pasta was a delicacy with fresh basil, crushed pepper, Evo and a touch of anchovy. Dessert time! Even though we were busting at the gills we had to try their desserts! \\nFresh filled cannolis, Kahl√∫a zabaglione creme  cake, and last but not least the decadent milk chocolate cheesecake with hazelnut spread atop! Pure joy! If ever I had a last meal this would be it! If you're a Floridian who never had real Italian food, you need to get here, if you're a New Yorker who just moved here or visiting you need to get here, everybody else you need to come here! Other mentions are there home made Focaccia  bread and pizzas, lettuce meatball wraps, meatball sliders and happy hour Monday-Friday 3-7pm! \\nAlso watch for their dinner shows and contest events on their Instagram, Facebook or website pages!

Sushi, make your own hibachi, udon and soup station, a line of sushi and nigiri, seafood salads and ceviches, hot bar, seafood station consisting of cocktail shrimp, raw oysters with mignonette, and steamed snow crab legs, crepe station, and a dessert bar. I'm going to write about the things you should try because this place is a smorgasbord and you might have a hard time trying every thing. So this is definitely going to be written more as a guide on what to get for sure and what you can safely skip. ALWAYS HIT UP THE CREPE BAR FIRST! I always try to hit it up last when I'm bursting at the seams and its just not conducive to my intestinal health. Hot Bar Pork siumai - I never get this but Kungfu vouches for it being the bestest pork siumai. \\nStuffed shrimp - Make sure the turn over is good though. \\nFried scallops - Consistently good. \\nCoconut shrimp - Consistently good. \\nGrilled squid - No go, its never been good and I feel like its never going to be good. \\nSalmon/Basa etc - both fishes can be on the greasy side so make a mental note of it. \\nFried blue crab - Kind of inconsistent, and its a pain in the butt to eat so I just skip this in general. Salad Bar Seafood Ceviche - its consistently good\\nIzumidai Tartar (?) - anyway, this is probably one of the best items on the cold bar imo, and very consistent unlike the salmon and the beef tartare. \\nCold Soba Salad - Consistently good. \\nMussels with vegetables (the name escapes me but its a mussel on a half shell covered in diced veggies) - Consistently good and it never disappoints. Seafood Bar Oysters with mignonette - Are they disappearing like hot cakes and is the lady putting them out after someone has ravaged them like a Viking on a pillaging mission? This is the only time to get them. \\nShrimp cocktail - Consistently good. \\nSnow crab legs - Sometimes, the legs are full of meat and there are times where its more than half empty. Make sure to get a couple legs and crack them open for inspection before loading your plate up. Sushi Bar & Sashimi Station I think the rolls that they do the best are probably the ones with fruit in them. It's surprisingly good. \\nSashimi is very inconsistent; check for freshness before eating. Hibachi/Soup Station I never thought the hibachi was very good and I mean... I pick the ingredients but its just not that superb and most of the time its a bit too salty. \\nUdon - Ok, there are times where the broth is too sweet but majority of the times its good, so give it a whirl. \\nOther soups - Never liked them. Pass. \\nOther items in the station - Eh... its consistently been mediocre or just not tasty, so skip. Dessert Bar/Crepe station Get the crepe for sure. \\nGreen tea ice cream always over the vanilla. Their vanilla is not creamy enough, ever and you'll wonder if this can even be called soft serve ICE CREAM. \\nThey have various pastries that always seem really meh to me.

The waitress came over to the table and then mentioned that the fries he was eating may have had some cross contamination to dairy from their fryer. We were not happy. My wife's food arrived and they were not sure if it was okay for her to eat it. So it had to be sent back, and re-made. She wasn't happy. Long story short.

Once we were seated it took 10 minutes before we were offered any drinks, followed by another 10 minutes before we had to ask to get menus.  After this the waiter we had decided he did not want our table anymore and had told us he was going home for the night so we had a new server (old server was in the restaurant working during out entire service).  The new waiter lingered and stood over us 80% of the time we were there and when he saw my mother looking through her wallet he came to our table and stood there asking why she looked distraught (insinuating that we did not have money to pay for our service).  Once we told them we wanted to share our meal (we were getting a late night bite it was 10pm when we got there) we were immediately given attitude and an eye roll extremely rude.  I also was unhappy with a salad I had gotten so another guest at our table had eaten it, the waiter commented 4 different times on me not eating the plate and even said this direct quote \\"well at least somebody here likes our salad\\" and walked away from the table.  I was unable to get a refill on my soda for some reason and had to ask 3 different times before I could get one.  The entire service we were treated as if we were not wealthy enough to be in your establishment even though we have money it was extremely rude.

It's the perfect combination of everything and the amount of pastrami in there is just YUM!

We came with a reservation and the place was packed, but the host was kind enough to keep us constantly updated on our table status. The food is a combination of brunch staples and light Mexican-inspired fare, such as smoked duck tacos. Service - the waiter was very nice and accommodating our food preferences. One of my friends asked for substitutions and they made them perfectly. The place also has mock tails for young college students. We ordered biscuits and they came within 5 minutes. The food came out 5 minutes after the biscuits, before we even finished the them. Food - I ordered the honey biscuits, hot apple cider, lemon meringue pancakes (fall special) and grilled steak breakfast tacos with scrambled eggs. Biscuits - slightly salty with a nice crisp on the surface. I tried it with and without the butter, I thought it could use more sweetness but that's a personal preference. Pancakes - came with 3 pancakes, a heap of meringue, lemon sauce and powdered sugar. The pancakes were nice and fluffy, I was able to cut through three layers very easily and it didn't come apart. The meringue was sweet with a bit of sour from the lemon - same with the sauce. There were enough accompaniments for me to eat the pancakes without any syrup. Tacos - more like a breakfast bowl, which isn't a bad thing. Each came with a large portion of steak, eggs, guacamole and vegetables. I couldn't fold them due to the amount of food on the taco. The eggs were cooked well-done, and the fried crisps of a scrambled egg complimented the vegetables well. There was also a slight sour element from the sauce.Cider - this was average, tasted like cider from the store.

I love the ambiance, the bar, the crowds but I'm afraid the kitchen isn't cutting it. Some things they do really well like the ribs, brisket, and Mac and cheese but the salads and most everything else is way too sweet, spicy, and frankly thrown together.

One time they had a massive tuna collar served with watermelon that was absolutely incredible, so come with an open mind. Also get dozens and dozens of the Island Creek oysters.

They said they adjusted the mistake,  but now my account is overdrawn and I am unable to use my money that was never owed to Zed's to enjoy my weekend.  When I came back the next day, I had to sit and wait for the manager to come in for over 1 hour. The young woman who said she was in charge told me the the manager would be in at Noon. That didn't happen. I ask for them to contact the General Manager Mario Berber.  I'm told he is not working today.  So u have an unhappy customer who u took money from and that's no cause to contact the general manager?!?  Are u serious. Not once did the so call person charge come and give me an update or anything. She just avoided me and let me sit out in the front waiting for the other manager to get there.  The staff also didn't have the courtesy to offer me a glass of water while I wait.  There's no way I could've come here eat and drink the food and tell them that I'm pay my bill next week. No way. Austin PD  would have been called and I would have been arrested.  Train your  staff properly and things like this won't happen. This is ridiculous. The other manager finally showed..

For starters, we split an order of the clam chowder, oyster sliders, and the no shell mussels in the white wine cream. Those were all fairly tasty, the best of which was easily the oyster sliders. The fried oysters were not too overbreaded, had nice flavor and accompanying sauce, as well as really good bread. For entrees, we split the monkfish and the lobster roe noodles, the latter of which they actually split into two dishes for us, which was very nice of them. It was a fantastic dish, the lobster was abundant throughout the dish and somehow went quite well with the meat, that was also very tender.

Yet it's beautiful in there, cozy, inspiring and curated with the best new-music playlist in town.This is a bad place to get work done: a poor value, crowded and missing the digital grease (wi-fi!) that makes a writing session go smoothly.Yet everyone knows it: sometimes I drive by and notice a friend or three sitting outside. I'm never alone here and that's beautiful and exhausting and being beautiful is exhausting. Or at least so I've heard. When I first got to town well over a year ago, I didn't have much.

It shares both in common with the moist brisket and lean brisket, so is a happy compromise between the two. Smoke rings were visible and the bark was trimmed thinner.The smoked turkey was trimmed fully lean, and a 'medium spicy' on the heat factor.Beans were more hearty, consisting of chopped brisket almost like chili.Free pickles, onions and self-serve bbq sauce station on side.Bbq sauce was thicker, not the watery vinaigrette variant."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I found this place, not only on yelp, but it came highly recommend from a friend back home.

All of the sushi was very unique and had great flavors. Plus, for the price you paid, you got generous portions. Next time, I would probably pass on the cucumber salad. It was described as slices of cucumber in a ponzu sauce. However, there was no flavor. It tasted like cucumbers in water with red pepper flakes. I typically stray from spicy foods, so I was not a fan of the unexpected addition of the pepper flakes. The only other reason why I gave this restaurant one less star is because they advertise special rolls on their social media. When I asked the waitress about them, she stated they can't be ordered and were off-menu items.

I started with the leek and potato soup with chanterelles and foie gras -- just the sound of all that mixed together sounds decadent! Then on to the golden beet and whipped goat cheese salad, yum. The portion sizes may appear petite but remember, there are FOUR courses. Post salad, I had the duck confit with lentils and cherries. Trust me, it's easy to do duck wrong but this was perfect! I offered a bite to my friend and caught a quick glimmer of \\"oh, why did I order the pork?\\" No sympathy on my part -- one bite was all he got!Finally, the icing on the cake but remember, I'm gf so no cake.

Whether it's vacant or crowded, they're not too attentive with water refills or making sure everything is okay. They appear when needed: drinks, orders, plating, removing plates, bill, collection, done. Prices:\\nFair! Lunch specials are great. Get the combo for $2 extra & you'll still be under $13 including tax & tip! (Given that you don't order seafood or an additional appetizer.) I'm used to seeing pho priced around $5.50 to $7.50 in Little Saigon (California), so the pho here is a few bucks more. Overall, I don't think anything is too outrageous. Food:\\nBeen here twice & I may make another trip to really finalize my decision of 3 stars, but man, disappointment. The first time I came here, I got the Pho Chay. It's not terrible, it's just not good. Flavorless, lacks the aroma of pho, just.. isn't very creative. You guys need to step up your Pho Chay game. Give me more fennel, cinnamon, star anise, ginger, onion, etc in my soup! All I taste is vegetable broth with pho noodles & some random vegetable toppings. The best way for them to improve this pho is to add some properly seasoned seitan, white wood ear (emulates the fat from pho bo), & maybe some bean curd sheets. Don't just toss any vegetable in there, pretend you're a vegetarian & you want to experience the wonders of pho. Do pho justice. Get the flavor profile down. I also had the drunken noodles & asked them to make it the spiciest (they have 4 levels). It was more mild than Sriracha & they ran out of the wide flat rice noodles, which was disappointing. The flavor was okay. I want to say I'm making bad menu decisions, except if it's on the menu, it should be good. The combo lunch with 2 vegetable triangles, gyoza, soup, & salad were delightful though. I enjoyed that more than the main dish. Sigh, I'll be back to try another Vietnamese dish because that's comfort food I miss from home, but I probably won't be happy. The vegetarian egg rolls are a let down too. Not very good, but not terrible. Edible, enjoyable, but not, \\"damn those egg rolls are delicious. I can't believe it's not meat!\\" good. Environment:\\nRestaurant is on the smaller side & can get really crowded at night. There's sort of a bar in the back. It's nicely decorated, nothing too cheesy or outlandish. I don't recommend Pho Basil, but it has potential to improve. I'm disappointed that Yelp's ranking for this place tricked me into thinking it would be really good. I want to like it because it's so close to me, but I can't. tl;dr Vietnamese American, grew up near the 2nd & 3rd most populated Vietnamese cities in the US outside of Vietnam; standards pretty high. Pho Chay not accurate. Much disappoint."},{"name":"Morton's The Steakhouse","address":"213 SW Clay St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Morton's is good. It has good drinks. It has good food. It has friendly and attentive staff. I've visited three times now. The first was for a drink at the bar. I had a lemon drop which was delicious. The bartender was attentive, which was excellent as we were waiting on an event at the Keller. My subsequent visits were for business events. I had the steak the first time. It was good and cooked as I requested. Was it the best steak I've ever had...no...but it was delicious. The second time I had the salmon. Also good. Their appetizers (crab cakes, lamb, bruschetta, scallops) are also pretty tasty. I recently had a delicious cab sav there too. Basically, their food is good and worth trying at least once. Morton's hasn't won a spot as one of my favorite restaurants or as the best steak in Portland, but maybe that's just me.

I was getting annoyed, but then I turned the right corner and saw the huge flag, sign thing they have out front. Solid.I walk in, there was no line, just people sitting at tables with huge sandwiches. I got very excited, ordered my sandwich and side of potato salad. The magic began.I didn't have to wait long before my meal was bagged and ready to go. I couldn't wait to try the potato salad so I opened it while on the T and was quite surprised by how good it was--I'm really picky with potato salad. I wanted to just plop down on the green line and eat my whole meal like the really sad person that I sometimes am. But I restrained myself, put the lid back on the potato salad and didn't touch my sandwich.By the time I got back to work, I couldn't take it anymore. The combination of the huge reuben and the potato salad was incredible. Just what I'd been looking for. I could taste every flavor rather than just a gooey sandwich--which reubens can sometimes turn into.I was very pleased.

I was actually scared to come try royal Rasoi for fear of being disappointed. My wife and I love authentic Indian food, and it's hard to get! Tonight we decided to take the drive from deland and check royal out. The atmosphere was warm, inviting, and clean. Good music not too loud and not too soft. We were seated very quickly and throughout the dinner service the wait staff was attentive, extremely polite, and prompt! That's all well and good, but the food is what matters most to me. I ordered my favorite dish, chicken tikka masala, HOT . My wife got shrimp Biryani, MEDIUM. She also got a mango lassi. We got garlic naan, and a pakora appetizer. The appetizer was out very fast, and did not disappoint. We  immediately looked at each other and smiled, because the food was just that good! I enjoyed it a lot! Also, when your seated they bring you a platter of sauces and a dish of lentil  wraps, hard, like a delicate taco shell. Very very good! The main course too about 20 minutes or so to come out, now this is something I DO NOT mind, because I know it's being prepared fresh. When we did get our entrees , the wait was well worth it! Possibly the best chicken tikka masala I've ever had! ( and I've had my fair share ). My wife's biryani was also absolutely delicious! Although, the menu does state that the shrimp are fresh water, and I think salt water shrimp are just better, but that was a very minor detail and the very taste of the biryani was so spot on! The tikka masala was what dreams are made of! The sauce thick, perfect amount of onions and peppers! It was a 10 on a 10 scale for sure! The prices are very reasonable, for my wife and I with two entrees , an appetizer and mango lassi came out under $50.00. I'm excited to become a regular patron, and will recommend all my friends go to Royal Rasoi! \\nPS, if management sees this, one thing to consider maybe. My absolute favorite Indian appetizer is gobi manchurian, please please consider adding that to the menu ! You guys are awesome!

I've been here before and had a pleasant time. I talked up the restaurant to friends so we planned a late dinner here on a Saturday night to check out the flamenco dancers . Plus we knew that they were offering $1.60 select tapas and select drinks for their 16th anniversary.I had called beforehand and the hostess mentioned that we could just walk in instead of making a reservation. Would've totally been nice if she mentioned there was a wedding party there and that there was a ONE HOUR WAIT. I was ticked off because our friends had driven out of their way, one coming all the way from Kissimmee. They were able to seat us outside at essentially a patio table you would find in a backyard. It was right next to the door. There was no privacy. We were right next to the door and also seated next to smokers which is my absolute pet peeve. Not to mention the noise coming from Church St. Just wasn't an ideal dining situation. The waiter eventually came by and I asked him about the special $1.60 tapas menu. He mumbled \\"patatas\\" and I told him \\"Shouldn't there be more ?\\" He looked a little flustered, brushed us off and walked away to find out . Didn't even bother to ask us what we would like to drink.  Totally unacceptable. That sent my husband and I over the edge.  We never did find out if there were other tapas offered because we ended up getting up and leaving and spending our money at Amura.  I checked out the restaurant's FB page later and apparently they are offering only one discounted tapa PER WEEK during the promotion period. Their marketing is absolutely misleading. Don't state \\"select tapas\\" and a time frame if it will only be one discounted tapa PER WEEK. Beware of this if you are planning to take advantage of this promotion.Overall, it was a disappointing and embarrassing experience because of my friends who were looking forward to dining here.

I was feeling Oceanic (ode ot Lost!) and so I ordered the shrimp and scallops. I am one of those very cheesy gals, so did I enjoy all the little tricks the chef did with the fire and the food?  Damn skippy, every minute of it was a delight for me.  Kiku gives you the same small garden salad and onion soup that most Japanese steakhouses do.  I have a serious thing for the dressing that put on that salad.  It is so very good to my buds that I could have licked the bowl. I really enjoyed the food.  First of all, they give you greater portions than BH.  Then, everything is seasoned better.  I have gone to BH and gotten veggies that cleary had not been dressed with any salt or pepper which made them very bland.  No thanks.  The shrimp and scallops were cooked perfectly and seasoned proper like.  It was a yummy meal.  Oh and I cannot forget to talk about how I enjoyed the rice too.  I love onions and those onions were running all up and through that rice along with some eggs and I was in love.  Win!We were served vanilla ice cream for desert.  I prefer sherbet, but whatever.

He eventually persuaded me to make a weekend visit so that I could experience the best of these restaurants. This included a visit to Franklin BBQ, which my brother assured me was the best BBQ in the world. As we've had some really good BBQ, this was a significant claim.Since he had already been there, he told me that we had to get there early and be prepared to wait. We brought folding chairs, drinks and reading material. We went on a Sunday morning and arrived at 9:12am. Almost two hours before opening time, and we were already 20th in line.Normally I will not wait in line more than 30 minutes for food, but this time I had already been coached to consider waiting in line to be part of the experience. We spent much of that time conversing with other people who were waiting, and it was actually fairly enjoyable.Inside, the building is small and has air conditioning and fans to keep it cool. The line to get the BBQ moved fairly quickly, and the employees were efficient and friendly. Serving is not fancy -- you don't get a plate, just butcher paper on a plastic tray. You don't come here for fancy or pretty, you come here for barbecue. I wanted to try a few different things, so I got some brisket, ribs and a sausage link. I am not exaggerating when I say that all of them were the best I've ever had. Different sauces are available on the table. I tried the sauces and they are good, but this BBQ did not need sauce. It is moist, flavorful and awesome without sauce.Don't be afraid to order large servings -- they provide boxes so that you can take whatever you can't finish. And don't skip dessert. They sell individual-sized pies which you can order to go. I'm told that all of the pies are excellent, and I can confirm that for the one I tried, which was the Bourbon Banana Pudding pie.Mr. Franklin himself came out and talked to the customers as we ate. He was very friendly, not intrusive but he seemed genuinely interested in his customers. It was a pleasure to meet him.If you love BBQ, Franklin is your Ultimate Destination. Understand that you will have to spend time waiting, and if you don't get there before opening time you may not be able to get ribs or sausage. But if you're willing to spend the time in line, you will be rewarded with the best barbecue you will ever have."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Came for dinner with a group of girlfriends.

Slim pickin's, it would seem. Had to go almost seven miles to Kacey's in Tucker. Pretty glad I did. There are joints like this outside the perimeter on places like Satellite Boulevard, but I guess it's a rarity on this side of the rim. Let's not waste time speaking of decor and atmosphere. It's a simple, dirt-cheap buffet that rotates its line-up daily. I came on Monday, so I got mostly chicken. If I come back on Wednesday, the menu says the star will be pork chops and turkey. Prices vary by day, but all things considered it's ridiculously low. I mean, we're in age where you can blow ten bucks at a fast-food join without blinking, so that's the relative light I choose to judge Kacey's in. I came for the friend green tomatoes, which is one of those woefully underrated delicacies of southern cuisine. Turns out there's a mix of FGT's and squash in the same tray (\\"fried vegetables\\" is how the menu categories them). I'm also a fan of tomatoes & okra, so I was happy to be able to spoon that on top of some rice. In general, most of the items feature rice or chicken in some capacity. Again, though, the protein will change by day.I left sated and content, but some elements could stand to be improved. For those not looking to gorge on meat and starches, the healthy options are disappointing. The salad bar just doesn't offer enough. Need some olives, mushrooms, boiled egg, maybe some diced ham or turkey. Desert was not too impressive either. Need some pineapple chunks, maybe strawberries, and I agree with other reviewers' that the banana pudding has an unearthly amount of yellow in it. Seriously, you cannot attribute that degree of yellowness to any fruit-bearing plant of this world. Makes a lemon look devoid of color by comparison.The hostess, Miranda, was a pleasure to speak to and eager to see me satisfied. Hope she's around when I come back."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Atmosphere is excellent, food is very good especially the jalape√±o flank steak.

Really, I'm a huge fan of curries in general, but Thai curries are my favorite. I am definitely a fan of soursop, Yum, and all sorts of amazing bitter, sour and spicy flavors that dominate SE Asian Cuisine. But I have a deep love for pungent, heady, dirty, earthy flavors that resonate from really carefully-crafted curries. When I test out a new Thai place, I generally start with the curries and make my way out from there. If a curry tastes like it came straight from the sweaty hot jungles of the Isthmus of Kra, I'm a happy man. Soi9's beef panang curry has made me a happy man. A good panang beef curry is really hard to find in Portland. Most of the curries here are good but they are safe... sweet and smooth, like gravy. To me, a quality panang curry is not just red curry mixed with peanut sauce. It needs to have a gritty, dirt-like base to it, upon which layers of cumin and heat are intertwined, topped with the sour, ripe, floral kaffir lime essence. When simmered with beef for an extended period, it takes on a richness that can't really be replicated any other way. The slow-cooked beef panang at Soi9 has all of these qualities. It's heady and legitimate. It's not cheap. At $12, it's more than you expect to pay for a curry dish, but when you dive in to this specialty you'll see why. It has some quality tender beef that's been stewing in this thick, cumin-heavy sauce for quite some time. Lots of kaffir lime and heat (not quite as much heat as I'd like in my current state, but on a regular day it's good), with a nice little dollop of coconut cream on top. I've sampled a couple of other dishes from Soi9, but what has been truly stand-out for me so far is the special beef panang, which alone is worth 5-stars. The Soi9 noodles are unique and tasty - a sort-of-phad-thai dish with some crispy mixed meats on top, and there are a ton of other quite interesting items on the dinner menu. I look forward to making my way through it."},{"name":"Lineage Coffee Roasting","address":"3201 Corrine Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This is as good as it gets in Orlando.

This lobster was bursting with meat, it was so close to molting that the new shell was thin and forming under the old one. Perfect with melted butter.The service is fast, friendly and helpful.

Seating for maybe 30 people max. Of course I started off with a iced Vietnamese coffee, then an order of the fish sauce wings all to myself. Afterall, this was what I was here for. When it arrived, I started salivating. Brown, shiny, wings, gleaming right at me as I anticipated the first bite. I picked up the wing, and bite. Wow. It took my tastebuds a few seconds to distinguish everything that was going on. The crispiness of the skin, sweet with a carmalized falvour, with bits of deep fried garlic to add more crunch; juxtaposed with the juicy meat inside, marinated just long enough to give it that salty fish sauce flavour....oh yes...I savoured each and single bite, all the way to the last wing. And to end off that remarkable experience, I ordered a 'coconut ice cream sandwich' for dessert.

We didn't even finish it, which is rare for us! Second complaint: the service was a little...strange.

(Four people) and they treated us very badly. We entered into a very empty resturant with no one there. We tried to ask because we were confused about what was their menu We decided to have a la carte anyways because they were being very mean about waiting for 1/2 hour until we get the late night all you can eat. They gave us a bad look for being curious.We sat down at our seat and we relaxed a bit. At least 20 minutes pasted and they didn't serve us tea or water to our table. We were a little bit disappointed at this point already. As I first stated that the restaurant was empty already, and they couldn't even serve us. That was just not in tip top shape in service. It was atrocious. We chose a la carte since they made us wait for more than 20 minutes and we already decided what we wanted to eat in that time period. We waved down the waitress who was right behind the counter, we had no idea what she was doing...We ordered and then the amount of people started to roll in slowly. The restaurant filled up with late night sushi eaters, and the restaurant got into the groove of serving other people already. We got partial of our orders and we were really confused what happened to our other half of our order. Only 2 people got food and we waited for the other to get their food at least.It was to the point where it took so long my other friend were already finished with the dish. It was totally unacceptable at this point. I told the waitress to cancel my order. We paid for our bill and left. It was really to the point where the service was utterly horrid.I didn't even want to try their food at this point.

Overall, I was not impressed. Pok Pok is slightly above average Thai food at best. The place did not meet my expectations as amazing Thai food but it was still good nonetheless. Since I am only in town for a short amount of time, I did not get to eat a lot here to save room for other places. Ordered the papaya salad and the Sai Ua Samun Phrai. Papaya salad comes either as regular or isaan style which is super salty spicy etc version. I got the normal style because we were told it was already pretty spicy so under the impression that this place was very authentic I thought the isaan style would be too much for lunch. It was not spicy at all and more on the sweet side for my liking. I eat Papaya salad often so I prefer it a certain way. But it was still good. The Sai Ua Samun Phrai was a chiang Mai sausage served with some pork rinds, chile dip and some cabbage. This dish was very good but again I wasn't exactly blown away. It was just one sausage and small ramekin of the dip. The portion sizes are also quite small for the price. Thai food is generally pretty cheap and comes large enough to share. I thought the two dishes we ordered here were not that big and a little on the pricey side. The atmosphere of the place is best part of the restaurant. I enjoyed the outdoor seating and ambiance of the place so I would come back if I lived here but it would not be for an exceptional meal. Don't get me wrong, I think the food was still good but even your most average Thai place is going to have tasty food.

EVERY bite of EVERY dish was fantastic . It was easy to get (simple) substitutions. For example,  to omit meat from a dish. Lots of fun and interesting options.  New flavors and fun twists on traditional favorites .Our server asked us to order all of our dishes at once, and this was rough , mostly because the dishes are so small and it was hard to gauge how much was needed. Also , because rhey serve in courses,  and expect the meat to be a last course , my husband 's final course came after mine. I would have preferred this as tapas style , with opportunities to order throughout the experience. \\nAs much as I loved the food here , it is a bit pricey for me , personally , to make this a regular spot.

After our 1st HORRID experience several years ago (for reasons I won't go into), we spontaneously decided to give this place (and Krog bar) one more visit.  Boy, are we ever so disappointed that we did (for KRS only, not for Krog bar)!  Stopped at Krog bar first while waiting an hour for our KRS reservation to arrive.  Krog bar is a great place with a great atmosphere and pretty decent wine and food selection (and semi-friendly service).  That part of the evening was fine & nice.Things immediately went down-hill once arriving at KRS for dinner - as follows: We were rather anxious about what to expect during our 2nd visit, since our 1st visit was so un-memorable (got our 1st meal completely free after a bad experience)!!  For our 2nd visit last night:  From the moment we sat down, we could tell our server (and subsequent) service, were going to be major let-downs.  And sure enough, they were!For starts, the server was extremely short & fast in his communications with us, almost as if we were a bother and he just wanted (us) to get in & out of there.  His \\"demeanor\\" continued throughout the meal (short & somewhat arrogant).  Then, my husband and I both ordered medium-rare steaks.  My husband's steak came out walking (waaay under-cooked) and both our steaks were less than lukewarm temperature!!  For these steaks being so pricey (his steak, a whopping $55!!) ... these steaks BETTER be the hottest, tastiest things ever!  Likewise, the CUSTOMER SERVICE needs to be top- notch!  Neither of our 2 visits did we get good or FRIENDLY customer service, nor hot or satisfactory food (however, the brussel sprouts & creamed corn sides were excellent and wonderfully tasty)!The manager finally arrived at our table and offered to replace/re-cook not only our steaks, but also replace our side items (so as to have all items hot and available at once).  1st return of re-cooked steak offered only same original steak just \\"warmed up.\\"  This was a big turn off to us and we requested they give us NEW steaks.  Which they did (but after some ridiculous & un-necessary debate by the manager than \\"they always re-warm steaks, they \\"never\\" give you a new steak).  BLAH.  The new steaks were finally piping hot the by the 3rd and final attempt!, but the cut of steaks was lesser quality than first time, and the steaks were also overly salty!  It was at that point that both our server and the manager who replaced our steaks, literally wrote us off and avoided us like the plague for the rest of the meal.  And all we did was ask for our steaks to be a bit more cooked (geesh).  At most GOOD steakhouses (hell, even OUTBACK!), the manager or server (or both) will return to your table and ask you to cut into your steak to ensure it's cooked TO SATISFACTION, and apologize immensely and return to your table SEVERAL TIMES to check on you.  We got NONE of that!  Last:  The GOOD news was that they offered our ENTIRE $130+ meal for FREE!  (but the very prompt way our server made us aware of this was again, extremely short & as if he did not want to look us in the eye or talk to us). They were probably too embarrassed (or mad, for what reason we did not understand), to acknowledge us any longer.We only wanted to get the heck outta there at that point and NEVER, ever return to Kevin Rathbun Steak!  (funny, cause we do enjoy RATHBUN's and Krog Bar, but NOT Kevin Rathbn Steak)!  How can 2 of his restaurants be pretty good with good service and food, but his Steak place ... far far the contrary !!!KRS definitely needs to TRAIN its servers on FRIENDLY and GOOD customer service!  Oh yeah, train the manager while you're at it ... so as NOT to completely AVOID your customers!  Rather, CONFRONT and ENGAGE them and apologize for bad food or service . and make AMENDS to correct the situation and leave the customer with a POSITIVE lasting impression (if only)!  KRS:  Go and ask the FOGO manager and team to train YOUR team ... as THEY have EXCELLENT, top-notch, FAST FRIENDLY CUSTOMER-oriented service!  OH, and for the price and EXPERIENCE (UN-limited, fantastic steak & service!), Fogo wins 20 million times over KRS!  Give us Fogo ANY day over KRS !!!Guaranteed, we will NEVER EVER go back to KRS!

We were seated promptly and offered complimentary sparkling water, a nice touch. Our server then didn't return to get our drink order to over ten minutes...but the table seated beside us who arrived five minutes after us got their drinks promptly before we even got a chance to order. Not a deal breaker but kinda weird. We ordered both our drinks and mains together and promptly after, my kombucha arrived. Very good - less acidic than Synergy. I would actually buy this stuff to drink regularly. Our mains came about 15 minutes later...the plating is very pretty and the local ingredients are clearly a focus. My Potato Cod Cake with Poached Eggs and hollandaise was fabulous. My boyfriend's meal, however, was silly. Silly in that for 14 dollars he got some cubed potatoes, celeriac and greens and the portion size was TINY. He asked for a poached egg on the side and they forgot it...when we told the woman who ran the food that the egg was missing, she shrugged and said \\"alright\\" and walked away. Sure enough our server came over with it a few minutes later and when was very pleasant about it. But for $14 plus $2 for the add-on egg, that meal is ridiculous. Luckily we had also ordered a side of maple bacon which was great - definitely worth trying. \\nOur plates sat for ten minutes without being cleared and then when I asked for the bill, it turned out their terminals were dead so I had to wait while the guy scratched my card for a carbon copy. Obviously as a former server I feel for him that he has to do manual swipes all day, but we had to wait for quite a while. Our server was really pleasant but not very on point.

After reading all the positive reviews on here I was really excited to try Pok Pok. I was very disappointed. The food was simply...terrible. First I had their drink special, some orange concoction in a metal martini glass. Tasted like some kind of liquid cleaner. I had 4 sips and couldn't take any more. Horrible! Their so called famous wings were way way too salty, eatable, but not enjoyable at all! At Pok Pok everything is spicy, and when I say spicy I mean hot as hell--that long intense lingering heat that makes your eyes water and doesn't go away! There's no levels of heat to choose from, its hot or not...and sometimes not is not even an option with their food. If you love eating habaneros for breakfast, you'll love Pok Pok. I don't mind some kick or some heat, but I want to enjoy the flavor of food not burn off my taste buds with overpowering spice. If food is this bad in Thailand, I think i'll take it off my travel list. Also had what I would call a KFC fish. Thats right--it was a whole fish breaded and fried, thats it. No sauce, nothing. WTF?? Finally I had their braised chicken. It was chicken...yay. At least I cold stomach it. Pok Pok...more like Suck Suck. The hype from Yelp got me. Won't be returning."},{"name":"Coquille Fine Seafood","address":"181 Carrall St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Joined some old friends here for a delightful lunch.

The space is small and cozy, with dim, intimate lighting. This past Monday was my first visit but I went with a regular. Other than selecting a beer, I let my companion handle the food order.We started with a fried cheese appetizer (I don't think that's what it was called, but that's what I ate) with accompanying pita bread. It was pretty tasty! For the main, we shared a sampler platter which included chicken, beef, salmon, and shrimp kabobs, plus rice and vegetables. This was a great option as we each got to taste a variety of things and could focus our attention on items we liked more than others. Overall, all the food was excellent.Finally, we ordered a dessert we'd seen pass by earlier. It was called Ekmek (I made certain to take down the name!). It was amazing. Whipped cream and vanilla custard and some kind of crust that was just heaven. Also, the service was great. The server was knowledgeable about the menu. She didn't hover but appeared when needed.

I am from Seattle and Vietnamese food there is very big; very traditional and savory.  I was a bit skeptical at first because the restaurant offers two cuisines; I thought one or the other might be lacking.Apparently the restaurant has been newly renovated.  It is very quaint, cute, and clean.  Seating is inconvenient - the tables are squished, cramped, and tiny but nothing you can't work around if you compromise a bit!(1) \\"mi hai san\\" (seafood egg noodle soup) - although on the more plain side, pleasant.\\n(2) \\"pho bo vien\\" (meatball rice noodle soup) - yummy, no \\"wow\\" factor but good.\\n(3) \\"drunken noodles\\" (wide rice noodles with veggies, spicy basil sauce) - a bit on the dry side but I did appreciate the bamboo shoots they put in the dish :) nom nom nom!  noodles were very wide and not cut... hmm..\\n(4) \\"thai fried rice\\" - was enjoyed, good to take home if you have leftovers.\\n(5) \\"goi cuon\\" (spring rolls, 2 pieces cut in half) - boring; fresh rice paper but was composed of mostly shredded lettuce, few vermicelli noodles, and maybe one or two little pieces of shrimp.  Not the whole *shebang* you would find elsewhere.  Peanut sauce was fairly bland in comparison to most goi cuon dipping sauces.\\n(6) \\"fried calamari\\" (appetizer with dipping sauce that tasted like a nuoc mam [spicy, sweet fish sauce] mixed with thick sweet chili sauce) - really good.  Large portion of nicely fried calamari.  However, the stale pieces of crunched up cha gio wrapper were kind of unnecessary.  Because they were stale.Servers, for the most part, were kind and attentive.  Heavily staffed, probably for the influx of customers come evening time.  One female server almost dumped the hot bowl of \\"mi hai san\\" on one of the guests at our table because it was too heavy for her.  She then struggled to set down our second \\"thai fried rice.\\"  Was a bit haphazard and should have been handled a bit more carefully."},{"name":"Firehouse Tavern","address":"38 S Vernon St","city":"Sunbury","stars":"4","text":"The atmosphere is great.

I didn't realize there was also a location in Portland! I'm so glad there's one here - Kizuki looks like they're expanding PNW. There isn't very many good Asian restaurants on this side of the city, so this is a huge deal! It was between this or Panda Express on UberEats... I recommend the garlic tonkatsu (and don't get low sodium! I've tried it to be healthier, and it was really subpar.). I tried take out for the first time, and the portion sizes were smaller than I remember, but I still love the chewy noodles and the soft boiled egg. Kizuki gets all the basics down really really well, but I do wish they tackled on more toppings and variations. I haven't physically been in this location, but the ones in Seattle have chili oil and soy sauce on the table for any additional seasoning.

Major showstopper pluses: no tip and free delivery! Before I go on, let me temporarily pause my enthusiasm and share their promo code: TSODELICIOUS for free potstickers.  Food: 8 yr old loved the sesame chicken, dumplings/potstickers and sesame balls.  My husband thought the wings were the stars of the show.  12 yr old dug everything.  My brother liked the crab rangoon.  I enjoyed the chicken lo mien noodles - good balance, not greasy.  The meal came with two packages of rice, tangy sauce, soy sauce, and fortune cookies.  Everything was hot.  If you have younger kids, be aware that some of the food is spicy, but can be customized. Logistics: technical execution was stellar.  As a technical project manager I give them a 10/10 on the user interface as well as delivery logistics.  Love that the mobile app and computer app were both very straightforward to use. Realized I missed a dish after sending in my order so just cancelled and reordered very quickly.  A thoughtful estimation of time was relayed when ordering. Then when it came time for the food to arrive a couple of emails came in, one to say the order was on its way and one indicating the order had arrived.  The estimated time was accurate. Fleeting thoughts: I love that after a long hard day at work and fighting traffic the food was waiting for me to come home!  It was piping hot and my family enjoyed our together time rather than watching and waiting for me try to cobble something together to eat.

Often came 2 times a week with my boyfriend, even after we moved out of central square. Always ordered the emperor, adventurer, or green goddess, and defended the place staunchly against all nay-sayers. No more. About a month ago, both the menu and the food itself completely changed (new management?). While my favorites remained listed, they may as well have changed the names. As someone else said, they ruined the emperor with chunky carrots and (more importantly imo) a modified, much sweeter sauce. The adventurer also tastes sweeter. My boyfriend tried one of the new bowls (the rainbow harvest), and we both found it nearly inedible (not undercooked, as others have said--terribly flavored). Did the old owners take the recipes? I would love to see the old life alive recipes come back--from what I can see, other reviewers agree. Back then, it's true, the amount of sauce was always wildly inconsistent, but at least the food tasted good. Maybe Americans prefer this weird, sweet food? I'll be making my own at home.

I've never tasted a native bratwurst, but this wasn't comparable to other satisfying brats I've tried. If you want a beer-simmered bratwurst with apples and pepper, perfectly browned, finalized with soft bread I suggest a different menu item. The atmosphere is pleasant and quiet.

I'm racking my brain right now, trying to figure out what to say about it all but I really have nothing.  There was nothing to rave about and nothing to complain about, except for maybe that the dishes were on the small side (we actually grabbed more food elsewhere after we left).  The only parts of our meal that actually stood out were the drinking vinegars (excellent) and the pitcher of pandan-infused water on the table.

The service was average - we had a friendly server but she did not seem too knowledgeable about the menu. The restaurant says in multiple places on the menu that they request \\"no modifications.\\" For someone who has dietary restrictions, I would recommend definitely looking at the menu ahead of time to make sure there is something for you. Although it says no modifications, our server let us know that hat means more of \\"no substitutions\\" and that you can remove ingredients from dishes without a problem. We started with the Nacho Totchos (no sour cream or cheese) and loved them. Any of their Tots are a great starter for a group.I ordered the Midtown Medley and loved it because it had so many classic breakfast foods piled into one dish.

Standard,but at least the veggies were fresh.They also had pita bread with hummus.Hummus was decent but the pita bread would have benefited from being toasted.It's served in mass portions,so I get it.There was also some type of tasteless shredded turkey (or pork bc I couldn't tell!) on slices of bread.Both were very bland.The best was the chicken salad because it had mayo & raisins in it & was accompanied with some type of thin fried bread sticks (similar to the wide noodles at Chinese rest).You can get seconds,too.\\nBy the time they announce the Pirates (there is one for each colored section of seating) they fired some really random gunshot/cannon sound that is loud,startling &without warning.This happens another time (or twice) during the show inside.The show tries to involve the audience by having you cheer for your pirate &doing random games of skill or speed such as picking one audience member to throw beanie bags up above to the pirate to be thrown into a bin far away & yonder.\\nOrange 8 was my section &it was literally the second best seating area.The 1st is Red because even though we were right behind VIP & in the center of the stage,Red was the direction that they faced.Orange,you see their side/profile or their back side.The other sections are ok.\\nThe food was okay.I honestly expected a lot worse,but I had to turn a blind eye to the way they serve the food.The apps were served on disposable plates &with disposable utensils,but when you sit your plates are on the table.Your server brings a giant bowl for the salad & you pass down the tube of salad dressings.Fine.My issue is that they collect your plates in stacks to serve your entr√©e.Umm,excuse me but what if I get someone else's plate back & they touched or licked it?It's really gross if you think about it.Also,my server kept on sticking his finger into the mouth of the pitchers of water &Coke!I don't want to drink his finger!By the time the salad came back he had on gloves but that is a just a gross observation & it could have just been my server.Btw,the table was kind of sticky!Don't put your hands on anything.\\nSalad,grilled roasted chicken w/ stm carrots &string beans along w/scalloped cheesy potatoes &apple cobbler with vanilla ice-cream.Salad was mostly lettuce& one roma tomato;he literally picks out one tomato which I find quite talented!It comes with shredded carrots & same 2 dressings.Free serving of beer &your choice of Coke or water are included.Just watch out for the finger server!Salad tasted standard.The chicken wasn't as tasteless as I expected.I didn't even have to use the bottle of hot sauce that I carried in my purse!I come prepared!The scalloped potatoes were decent because it was dressed in that cheap cheddar type of cheese.The vegs were tasteless& I think frozen or from a can.Apple cobbler was okay but we didn't get any of the crust.There was also cheap bulk bucket ice-cream!\\nI really don't understand why the princess had a half-naked clothed gypsy friend or or server/accomplice to which she really cared for.

This place is under new management and rightfully so. We would come here once every other week or so and every time we would come here i'd be disgusted. The place was disgusting, the booths were so gross and old you would sink into the floor, counter tops were sticky every single time. The restaurant was gross, but the food was pretty good. The new management has clearly addressed the several issues in the place. Got rid of the gross booths, got rid of the pretentious servers, wiped down the countertops and actually cleaned the front of house every once in awhile. Yes, I will agree the food has taken a step in the wrong direction. The home fries are now traditional and not unique like they were before, that sucks. The vegan ultimate breakfast is still the same and tastes the same except the fact that the BBQ Seitan is different is oddly soggy. Overall the place is still a good breakfast spot, I'm really surprised to see how so many people are being keyboard warriors and just absolutely destroying this place on Yelp yet probably don't say a single word to anyone in the restaurant about their dislikes. 3 stars for this place because the food for vegan is still suitable and the cleanliness of the restaurant has soared.

Kristin, our server, was very attentive and efficient. We had linguine shrimp scampi, fruitta di mare special that came with garlic bread (looks different than typical garlic bread that I was expecting...), and chicken piccata. I really REALLY enjoyed shrimp scampi and chicken piccata-- both dishes had very zesty lemon-y sauce that was super filling yet light at the same time.  Mmm mmm mmm.  It was flavorful without overbearingly lemon-y.  Chicken was very tender and capers added just right amount of saltiness. My mother-in-law liked frutta di mare the best.  We got free dessert with yelp check in so I chose tiramisu to-go which I just ate for breakfast and it was awesome!!!! We were only able to finish one dish so we took the left over home.

FYI, there is valet parking, but you can park in a side lot and walk down if you don't go during the busiest hours. They have some lower-priced beers and various wines by the glass, and they will bring tastes of wines so you can decide what you prefer. We had two appetizers - a platter of calamari and scallops (yummy, not super original) and beef brisket (tender and smoky, unexpected but good). Apps are a good size, plenty of food. Our entrees were the pork tenderloin (my husband liked it, but it comes medium rare, and the mashed potatoes are sweet, literally) and the heart of ribeye - large piece of tender steak with a nice dry rub seasoning crust on the outside.  Once on the inside of the steak, it wasn't seasoned very much.Dessert was a chocolate caramel mousse (best thing we ordered!) and a blueberry crumble (not great).  The breads and butter were delish. Overall, we liked the meal. It would not have been worth full price, but being Inman Park Restaurant Week, our meals plus a champagne and a beer totaled $95, so we added tip and ended at $115. That's the most this meal would have been worth, so we probably won't return for a full price meal.  Overall, quality experience, just a bit overpriced at menu rates.

All of the specially rolls we've tried have blown us away and the service is always friendly. Our server the past few times has been Arielle and she is great! She's friendly, communicates our food status, and she's timely with anything we need :) The only complaint I've seen people say is that the specialty sushi can take a long time but perfection takes time!!

We did not have reservations, which was no problem; the three of us were sat immediately (on a Wednesday night at about 8:00pm). I am also so glad they had Beer Lao - a favorite of mine from living in Vientiane. Three dishes (with a basket of sticky rice each) was filling enough for the three of us.

They are striving for fine dining, but it's not quite at that level. Certainly the service is outstandingly solicitous, but it's clear most of the staff is unfamiliar with the level to which the management aspires. So while many servers asked repeatedly if we needed anything, it was more obtrusive than helpful. Coupled with an offer of dessert before our main courses were served, it was a bit disjointed. Still, their hearts are in the right place, and experience will iron out these problems.The food, too, strives but doesn't always succeed. For starters we had the quiche and the lobster bites. The quiche was a nice, small, thin tartlet that made a good appetizer, as it wasn't too filling. The lobster bites were essentially an escargot preparation, but using generous chunks of lobser instead of snails. The garlic butter was delicious, but the method of preparation of course leaves the lobster very, very well done.We also had a small Caesar salad and onion soup. The Caesar was good, and at $5 was emblematic of the extremely reasonable pricing. Where else in town can you get a Caesar salad for that price? The onion soup was the only thing we had that really wasn't good. It looked like a traditional preparation, but the consistency was more like gravy, and not very appealing in taste, either.Main courses are also very reasonably priced, particularly considering they include two side dishes of your choice. I thought my companion's New York steak was a bit tough, but she enjoyed it. The accompanying Chico's sauce had a nice mustard base. I had the fish special, a corvina, which was delicate and nicely prepared. The home run of the evening was actually the Angel Onions, thin onion straws that were battered and perfectly crisped.Photos of the place don't do it justice, as the interior decor is stunning, although it would be better with lower light levels.And as I've mentioned, the prices are extremely reasonable, particularly given the tourist area that surrounds it."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The food exceeded all my expectations.

Honestly, I would give a 3.5 if I could but I decided to go for a 4 instead.First of all, the location is terrible! Super limited parking and to be honest, I didn't know where to park even after reading previous reviews about this location. It's tricky getting into the parking lot without missing Vivi altogether because you're driving, driving, driving and then BAM, you missed it.The menu is decent, with bubble tea being the obvious specialty and some snacks are offered as well. I was the first customer for the day so I got my order rather quickly. I wasn't sure how I would get my order  (if they brought it out to me or if I had to wait upfront for it) but they will call your number on the receipt to be picked up.The sole purpose of my trip to Vivi was for the (you guessed it) cotton candy boba and the light bulb boba, more so the light bulb boba because that 50 bulbs a day was definitely motivation for me to get here early.The decor is very bright and girly. The Japanese word \\"kawaii\\" is definitely embodied here with the pink chairs, skull characters, and pink swing. Being here kind of makes me want to scream \\"OMG SUPER CUTE!\\" Chinese pop plays overhead, signaling that this place is a chill and casual place. Seating is limited so I can imagine it would get crowded on a busy day/night.The boba tea itself isn't mind blowing or anything amazing. It's just bubble tea...presented cutely. So if you come here, don't be expected to be wow-ed or amazed at the flavor. I ordered the cotton candy tea in original and after I inhaled most of the cotton candy, I melted the rest into the boba tea. I did try the tea before mixing in the cotton candy and the tea is a little bland so if you want a hint of sweetness, mix the cotton candy in it. The peach boba tea was good but I will say that the texture of the jelly really threw me off because I couldn't pinpoint what it was and it wasn't firm like the typical boba jelly (not the tapioca balls).TLDR: If Vivi is out of the way for you (like it is for me), just stick with your usual boba tea spot. If you're really wanting the cute stuff then give Vivi a try."},{"name":"Golden Lotus Chinese Restaurant","address":"8365 S John Young Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I went here a few weeks ago.

The kitchen takes up half the space! The food: We ordered Aglio Olio (the squid ink pasta with olive oil, calamari, and garlic) as well as the Monkfish Marsala. Both dishes were delicious and absolutely a must order. The monkfish Marsala was some of the best fish I've ever ordered. My husband and I couldn't get enough of that dish. I highly recommend it. The portion sizes: My husband and I ordered the entree portions of both aforementioned meals, had the bread to start, and had gotten the salad instead of the pasta that comes with the fish. We were both full but didn't have to worry about taking food home as we finished our meals and nearly licked our plates clean then and there. The service: Great!

Their kitchen is small so once you sit down your food may take a little while to come out. But hey, a little conversation never hurt anyone!

They take their ice seriously here and you can see and taste the difference.\\n2. Food - Known more for their cocktails, their food, brunch or dinner, can be quite delicious. Now I'll be the first to admit that with their menu often changing, the awesome thing you had last week may not be there this week and what's in its place may pale in comparison. Still, I've had some truly delightful meals here.\\n3. People - Whether it's the original crew who spurned the foundation for my Weather Up love in my many early visits through their great service and cocktail making skills or those who filled in since their departure, they know how to hire the right people.\\n4. Original -  To check out the \\"new\\" place in town can be enticing. While some sound promising, I'd rather return here, to one of the first legit cocktail bars in Austin that helped pave the way for all the new ones. Plus, you'd be hard pressed to find better drinks in town than here.\\n5. Their lack of signage - Weather Up is a destination bar. Bright blinking neon lights won't bring you here.\\n6. The vibe - Inside you'll find NYC subway tiled walls, a copper bar, and their trademark ceiling lights. Outside is their super Austin laid back patio providing a seamless multi layered feel overall and the perfect setting to enjoy their devilishly good drinks.\\n7. Cocktails - That's what you came here for right? Their drinks are fantastic. Whether you go with their Mezcal Maid, Revolver, Fancy Free, El Diablo, or another concoction, they are sure to have a drink that will make you happy.

They have an enormous collection that stay impressively organized. Devon will take the games you like and suggest a ton of more games, and will teach you how to play it, too! - SPACE:\\nCozy with fluffy chairs. The space is broken up into 3 sections - our favorite spots are the back for big groups and the middle for cozy date night/game night. - SERVICE AND PARTIES:\\nThey were -so- accommodating for our last minute birthday party group of 10+. While I think the normal protocol is to call them in advance so they can block off the space, we were scrambling to find a suitable birthday party location for the boyfriend after finding out that Do Re Mi closed (RIP) and came early to Knights Move to see if we could grab a few tables for our friends. Devon and the team let me know a birthday party was wrapping up in the back, and we could move in for our own last-minute party. The 28-year-old boyfriend waited patiently for the 8-year-old's birthday party to end, and we were able to set up shop comfortably with our Upper Crust Pizza and beers. Devon stopped by often to make sure we were set up with cups and utensils. Overall, the service, crowd, space, and (of course) games makes Boston's first board game cafe a huge win.

Yesterday, not so much. I pull up and tell the young lady that I have earned a free sandwich and would like to redeem it. I also say that I would like to make it spicy instead. She states that I'm unable to do so. I tell her that I've never had an issue before, so she checks with a \\"manager\\" and says no. I politely say, \\"okay, never mind the free sandwich, well let me get a #1 spicy, with a peach tea lemonade and add pepper jack and American cheese.\\" She repeats the order, I pay and drive to the window. The lady hands me a bag, with no fries and says that I was only rung up for a sandwich and a drink and that the fries would be an additional $1 or so. I ask is that the difference of the combo and she says no. I ask her to please ring me up for the difference since I initially asked for a #1. Finally, I pull off, devouring my fries (I hadn't eaten all day) and get to the sandwich. At this point I'm still a bit frustrated about my experience, them trying to over charge me and not being able to use the coupon I earned, I bite into my sandwich and it's cold. Like super cold. Not freezer cold but less than room temperature cold. The cheeses are no where near melted. It was disgusting to say the least.

The Fisherman in Love had noodles inside the bowl and a strong coconut curry taste. There was more sauce than noodles but it was great for leftovers over rice! The Crispy Garlic Duck was absolutely amazing. It exceeded what I had expected and the bar was very high after reading a few reviews. It was very rich in flavor and the broccoli and cabbage was a perfect addition. The Duck was to die for! We had just came back from a seven mile hike and was starving. The portions were perfect and we still had leftovers! They have more workers on the weekend than they did on the weekday. The last time we came there was only two servers but this time there was four! The entire staff was very friendly and there were more customers as well. We still got seated very quickly and our orders were taken. They were still attentive to our table even though there were others in the restaurant. Cups always filled with ice cold water and coming by just to ask how things were and if we needed anything else. In summation, I would defiantly come back to this cute little restaurant. This is from now on our go-to Thai place in Vancouver. We noticed that the special lunch time value menu is only done on the weekdays.

It did not occur the the wait staff that there are 6 people standing by the door for the past 20 minutes, and 4 others who left because they didn't want to wait anymore.... that maybe they should clear those tables and start sitting people down.Bear in mind this restaurant have no wait spaces, no bar to sit down, nothing.

We arrived around 8:00 and had no trouble getting a table.  It wasn't empty, but not full either.  Had a few drinks (wine and cocktails) and all were on point with what we were eating.  Not an overwhelming selection of wines, but they fit with the atmosphere.We started off with some appetizers.  First, was the Casa Ceviche which we've never tried before.  We were looking for something with a variety of fish and this delivered on flavor.  Never had squid in Ceviche before which was a little different.  We also had the Tabla Mixta which was a nice assortment of meats and cheeses with some bread and nuts to go with it.  I loved the Chorizo.Round 2 brought the Gambas y Guacamole which had a tangy Guacamole with Pico de Gallo and about 3 medium shrimp.  We also had our favorite Piquillos Rellenos which are 3 peppers stuffed with veal and some other stuff with a sherry cream sauce (good on everything, BTW).  We also had the braised Oxtail which was awkward to eat, but absolutely delicious.  We thought the spinach with figs, garlic, and honey would go with it and we were right.  The Espinicas was one of the favorites of the night.Round 3 came the Paella.  We did the one with Pork and Chicken and loved the flavor and all of the crispy bits of rice.  If you get the Paella, plan on a wait as it takes time to prepare.  We ordered after our appetizer round 1.Finally, a little Creme Brulee for a desert to top it all off.  What else can you say, about Creme Brulee?The Service was great with plenty of water refills and the manager stopping over to see how everything was.

Quite disappointing to be honest. We had the guacamole at the table which was fine just needed to be better seasoned the queso which was ok but for the price underwhelming. The combo of a quesadilla, taco and enchiladas for 17 which was bland and greasy. Not horrible but for the price not worth it. The chips were very good. The cocktails were also good but not great for the price of $15 a cocktail which I am fine paying if it is amazing, it was ok but just in my view, not worth it.Just very overpriced and underwhelming.

My husband and I split the mini tacos and the chicken taco had no taste once so ever. Like, not marinated in anyway. The salsa was good. My cousin liked her meal, the Vivo Pollo, because it's the only thing she recognized. My uncle was disappointed in his taco steak salad. Partly because he thought he ordered a fajita plate with salad on the side (he ordered the salad). But the fajita meat was cooked on a skillet not the grill.

The owner renovated the whole place and it adds an welcoming restaurant in the neighborhood. On that day, we ordered the pork belly with rice and the house hand-made noodle with tomato soup base. The pork belly was good but it was a bit under-seasoned to my taste. As for the rice, it was definitely not freshly made and probably reheated in the microwave. The noodle dish was poorly made. The soup base was watery and bland in taste. The noodle was not freshly made as advertised and I can taste the noodle was previously frozen. The toppings ( Lamb & mussels) were also previously frozen and I can't even taste any seasoning at all. Overall, the experience at this place was a disappointment and I don't recommend this place if the dishes I had can be make better at home."},{"name":"Mission Sushi & Wok","address":"1625 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Only ordered via Door Dash but Mission Sushi & Wok has established itself as one of my go to's.

It's always delicious with great toppings.  I like the standard thin crust the best, but the sourdough thick crust is really good on occasion.  My favorite is what I call the bacon-bacon (Canadian plus breakfast bacon, yum!).  The pizzas are also a little pricey, but I think nowdays every pizza of this level or above, you get what you pay for.In addition to pizza is a staggering selection of options like fish & chips, chicken, and my personal favorite, the jo-jo potatoes.

I went back to my table that had a great view to see when they put out new food to enjoy my chili which sadly tasted overcooked. 20 minutes later they put out the potatoes and I nearly sprinted to get a few for me and the rest of the table. Sadly I get my potato and see that the sour cream is missing. When I asked the lady for sour cream, (the same lady who knows I have been waiting 20 minutes for a potato) she looked at me told me that they didn't have any and started laughing in my face.

I can feel  the essence of ramen in the air. It's serious business minus the hype. The wait was pretty long but it was totally worth it.We ordered Takoyaki and pork gyoza for appetizers and traditional tonkatsu in rich broth and garlic tonkatsu. Takoyaki had pretty soft filling but was balanced out with crunchy but tender squid bits. It was such a nice treat cause it's hard to get Takoyaki in Portland. For the price of $5, well worth the trip on its own. Pork dumplings were good but nothing to brag about. You can get them anywhere. Onto the ramen:  the broth was creamy and rich but the good thing was that I didn't see a layer of fat floating on top. It'd be a turn off for me to see that. The traditional broth was salty but it didn't numb my tongue like other places. I would try less sodium next time. The garlic tonkatsu just had a garlicky taste to it. The toppings were generous. The bamboo shoot was tender, sake-soaked whole egg was perfectly cooked with the still soft yolk (unlike plain poached eggs at some nontraditional places). The bean sprouts added a nice crunchy texture but I could omit them because I think bean sprouts could dilute the true flavor of the broth. Black mushroom could totally replace the bean sprout for the crunchy texture. The shar siu pork belly was so tender that it sort of melted in your mouth. It was a wide thinly cut piece. The noodle was a generous portion, but I would have liked it to be a bit more al dente. So that magnificent bowl of ramen is $12. It's well worth it because you don't have to do any add-ons. It's loaded. After the appetizer, I could only finish half a bowl and had the rest to go. If you happen to want extra noodles, it's only $2, but you would have to be super hungry.Service was fast and polite. Decor was very trendy but traditional. Space is very open. It's totally worth the wait. Turnover is fairly fast. Must go!Kukai Izakaya is a Japanese chained ramen restaurant. It has 1 location in Taiwan, several in Washington and now 1 here in Portland.

Yay consistency!This time I ordered the carnitas and chipotle chicken tacos, and my partner got the chicken flautas. Their tacos cost a little bit more than other places, but the portions are a lot bigger also. The slow-cooked meat is still very flavourful, and the veggies/ toppings are still a bit scant for my taste. I'd like more fresh veggies on the tacos to balance out the tender meat. This time the taco shells stayed a lot more intact than last, so that's great!Also, did my Yelp check-in and got a very generous portion of chips, salsa and guac.. we actually couldn't finish it.

Then I get a half-assed \\"Sorry, sir.\\"  Really? This is not the first time the customer service here sucked. I once called and was just flat hung up on. The older woman who takes orders and runs the register is very rude. If she doesn't like her job, get another. I may have only been ordering a single slice, but the treatment was un-believable!

This is NOT the Morton's that originally went in here. I had such great memories of the food, service and ambience. We held countless private parties in their private room and had a wonderful wine locker. Then my parents moved and I went off to college (had my college send off party here). A year or so back, my father got an email about our wine locker saying that we still had wine that we needed to pick up. He asked if they could continue to hold it until one of the family members could pick it up. They said of course, in keeping with the superior service we'd come to expect. So I decided to go here with family to celebrate by 31st birthday in April, looking forward to enjoying a bottle of the Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape that we had in our wine locker. We had over a case of that, bottles from 2003 and before that after aging were conservatively $800-1000 dollars each. We also had a case of Silver Oak and a case of white wine. The white wine was admittedly bad but all the reds would have been beyond exquisite and I couldn't wait. We showed up, were barely greeted, and sat in a table that was not the one we requested in an empty restaurant. They didn't even acknowledge it was my birthday, even though it was on the reservation. I asked the waitress within minutes for a bottle of the Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape. She looked confused, went to get the manager and he came over after a few minutes. What occurred next is beyond my imagination. It was as though I was transported to a Red Lobster and speaking to the manager there. Actually that's an insult to Red Lobster, this manager didn't even belong at a McDonalds. He came by, said he had no clue what we were talking about and that he'd been a manager for years and didn't even recognize the last name as having a locker. When we reminded him of the wine we had, he said, \\"oh that's too bad, that white was already bad though.\\" Clearly he knew exactly which wine we had, and they'd either drank it, sold it, or taken it home for themselves. I asked him if he could look further, and he looked at me as though I had just asked him to change earth's rotation. He wrote me off, said \\"sorry, that's tough luck, I have no clue what you're talking about.\\" He didn't say, sorry, \\"let me see what similar bottles we have\\", he simply shoved the wine list at me and said pick another. They didn't even offer a half glass of wine to taste to see if I might like it. They offered NOTHING. He left and never came back. When Morton's first opened they asked if we'd not only participate in their wine locker program but help promote it. Not only were we one of the first to support the restaurant in this way, but we helped promote it by having our friends get wine lockers as well. Now to be treated in such a way was horrific, not only because we'd been supportive but I can't think of a restaurant treating any customer in such a discourteous way. Now, let's talk about the service and food. We ordered drinks, I think one other table was in there, and it took over 15 minutes to get our drinks. How long does it take to pour 3 drinks, that are not complicated? Then our food. The Shrimp Alexander has gone down in quality although still somewhat ok. I ordered the salmon and crab dish. The salmon was old, overcooked, and had zero flavor. I literally think they went to Costco, let the salmon sit there and then put it on broil for too long. It was inedible. I was offered a free souffle too late in the dinner for them to make it, I asked if I could have the chocolate molten lava cake instead, and our waitress said it was too late and that I couldn't switch desserts. Really? My birthday dinner was already ruined and you can't make it up somewhat with an inexpensive dessert? I already didn't have the bottle of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape that I'd been looking forward to all month, but now I don't get the dessert I'd loved since high school. This was easily the worst experience I've had on a birthday and mostly thanks to poor service. But the best part, I got home and something I'd eaten that night had made my stomach not happy. I spent the rest of the night over the toilet from bad food, I'm guessing the salmon. My dad's steak was overcooked, he struggled to eat any of it and my sister's petite filet was one of the worst quality steaks she'd ever had. My other two friends who were there, who will eat anything, said they'd have preferred the take out over this place.So long story short, if you are looking to pay a lot of money for dinner, to get service that is horrendous, snobby and outright shameful, go here. If not, go anywhere else in Portland, I mean anywhere else and you'll be happier.

But each time I've gone they were closed or closing for one reason or another but today I had the honor of actually getting inside and checking it out. There was much hype about this location is being the best sushi place in Atlanta so we were excited to get a chance to try it out. The staff was very friendly and was the highlight of the experience. They were very attentive and took care of anything I needed. The only negative I would say is when I came in they were trying to tell me how little time I had left until they took up all the food.  The door guy was almost trying to sell me on not coming in for lunch even though I had over an hour to eat - in the end it took me about 15 minutes.The sushi selection was decent and I tried as many pieces as possible for each plate some of them were extremely weird and I am an experienced sushi eater all over the world I have tried nearly everything imaginable. Also just so you are aware the tempura shrimp are the entire shrimp, head to tail and complete shells, deep fried with batter over it so when you bite into it you quickly realize this is a peel and eat style.  Why they would coat it with an abundance of batter and fry it is a mystery to me.  Overall I would rate the sushi as over-hyped as it wasn't as good as I expected for such a talked about place definitely not the best in Atlanta. What I do think the cool was the different Japanese salads entire bar section that was allocated just for different salad types.  I would say this is the more adventurous side of the sushi bar.  I also like the large selection of prepared fish items they had an entire section was also dedicated for fish dishes.

Ordered the Mr. Pink on corn (subtract points for not having whole wheat). This taco is seared Ahi with cabbage, cilantro, queso fresco, and lime - served with their Chipolte sauce. Me: \\"Can I get the Ahi cooked well done?\\"\\nGuy behind the counter: \\"sure.\\"\\nMe: \\"Is the Chipolte sauce spicy?\\"\\nGuy behind the counter: \\"not our hottest, but has some heat.\\"\\nMe: \\"Can I get it on the side?\\"\\nGuy behind the counter: \\"yes.\\"\\nMe: \\"Do you have whole wheat tortillas?\\"\\nGuy behind the counter: \\"no.\\"  :(\\nMe: \\"I'll have the Mr. Pink, tuna cooked well done, on corn, with the sauce on the side, to-go.\\"10 minutes later, bag in hand, I head home. Tuna is seared, no sauce on side or anywhere else, and corn tortilla falls apart on lifting... so I am eating a seared (not well done) Ahi taco casserole with a fork. The plus side... there is a healthy portion of Ahi that if either or both of the tortillas held up, it would definitely make 2 good tacos. The Ahi was overly spicy... while I appreciate a little heat, I do not like it at the sacrifice of good flavor. -------------------------------------\\nVisit 2: Entered Torchy's at breakfast, no line (score in my mind). Ordered the Migas on corn. This one comes with avocado.  Me: \\"Last time I was here, my corn tortillas fell apart.\\"\\nGal behind the counter: \\"We have flour.\\"\\nMe: \\"Do you have whole wheat?\\"\\nGal behind the counter: \\"no.\\"  :(\\nMe: \\"I prefer corn then, but I would like it not to be soggy so I can hold the taco this time.\\"\\nGal behind the counter: \\"I'll tell the cook.\\"\\nMe: \\"I'll have the Migas on corn with the sauce on the side to-go.\\"15 minutes later (I think they went to the farm in San Antonio to get the eggs, then the cow to make the cheese... no one in the store, and 15 minutes to make a taco), bag in hand, I head home. Great portion in tortilla, sauce in bag (whew), and corn tortilla falls apart on lifting... so I am eating a breakfast Migas casserole with a fork. \\n-------------------------------------\\nI may go back one more time and get the tortillas on the side (if they can figure that out), because I want to try the Carnitas. The place is kind of funky groovy inside with lots of flames in the decor, but I do not understand the silk flower collage artwork on the walls. It does not match the urban groovy look they are going for. It looks like someone hit a Garden Ridge silk flower clearance, cut the stems off, and hot glued them to the wall as if they were going to make it a float for the silk flower Rose Parade. They do take the go local card (10% off)... which is a plus. They loose points for not getting orders right and serving tacos in corn tortillas that do not hold up. I mean seriously, how would you feel if they gave you a beer with a hole in the bottom of the bottle?The service is lackluster, as I think they are depending on their cult following of trailer park groupies transplanted to the burbs to keep them in business. They have potential if they can improve service, quality and speed. I wanted to like them more. I may provide an update after the Carnitas visit. If you can't hold it in your hand and eat it, it AIN'T* a taco!!!At this point, I think they should rename themselves Torchy's flour tortilla tacos and corn tortilla casseroles... bring a fork, you'll need it. \\n-------------------------------------\\nWARNING: Driving while consuming a Torchy's taco on corn will result in a stained shirt!

The crab cakes had a good amount of delicious crab meat and prawns were quite jumbo and meaty. Yumm! The thick cut bacon was a little fatty for my taste but tasty. We also shared caesar salads to start. The salad was very fresh and tasty too. Everyone ordered the prime ribeye except for our grandson and me. He had the 12 oz filet mignon and I had the lobster tail. All were done perfectly and delicious. As with our family custom, we always share a little of each other's dishes to get a good idea of the the flavors of the food. The steaks were done to perfection with a nice char and tenderness. Lobster tail was a good size and absolutely the bomb!Prior to the meal, Ashley was so sweet to offer a souffl√© for dessert complimentary for our celebration. It had to be ordered in advance to be ready by the end of the meal. They really went out of their way to make us feel special for the occasion. We also got the \\"Morton's Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake\\". Both were sooo good!! Souffl√© was quite light and airy served with a wonderful sauce. Hot chocolate cake was ooey gooey on the inside and a nice crunch to the outside served with a large dollop of vanilla ice cream. Everyone was in agreement it was a fantastic meal. Will definitely recommend to our friends and be back to sample more of the other interesting items on the menu."},{"name":"Chuy's","address":"8123 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We visited on 5/19/19.

My favorites are Basil Fish Filet, Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with hot green pepper. The dry beef and lamb and cumin are good but the style isn't really my thing. On the downside, it is a little pricey. If it was a little more affordable I would eat here every single day because its right across the street from work. The lunch special only has very limited selection and appears to cater to the Americanized crap. Service is \\"eh,\\" as typical Chinese restaurants go.

The four Island Creeks were very good and proved why they're among the best in the country. I loved the briny flavor and delicate texture. The Beach Points weren't particularly special and didn't taste much different than some places I've been to for dollar oyster nights. The Wild Belons, while rather pricey, have an interesting meaty texture and are large. I ended up liking the Belons a lot and are worth the price, if you're an oyster fan.I didn't know the lobster roe noodles were popular and just ordered it because it sounded good.  My friend followed suit and we both didn't regret it. The noodles were properly cooked and tasted rich with the butter sauce. There's a good amount of lobster and it was nicely grilled (not overcooked at all). The short rib was tender and flavorful. I loved the oyster mushrooms. I'm not a fan of brussel sprouts, but it does go well with the richness of the short rib and lobster. The dish is worth the price, if you wanted to splurge.The service was very nice at the bar.

Glad I did so, as our meals were terrific but, without the Groupon, the price would've been quite high. (Even with the Groupon, it was still pricey. But hey, I don't believe in pinching pennies when it comes to raw fish meals, ya know?). I was impressed with this small restaurant in a strip mall, despite its unassuming exterior. (I don't know why some reviewers noted that it had a large interior. It is TINY! There's a front counter right when you go in, to order your meal, then a narrow hall/galley where there are three or four tall bistro tables against one wall, each sitting two people on tall bar stools. So max occupancy to dine in is 6 or 8 people). But despite the small size, it is very clean and quite cute, with a beachy, Hawaiian-themed vibe: white walls on one side and blue on the other, photos of Hawaiian beaches and scenes, and framed beachy, Hawaiian-related quotes. There are also stringed lights creating a canopy on high over the narrow hall/galley where the tables are, and some metal silver fish heads attached to the wall above the tables. The blue and white palette and the fish and beach art give the place a nautical feel, as do the white and blue tiles by the front counter. Very cute.The staff here are incredibly friendly and helpful! We had a young guy explain to us (patiently!) how to order, and gave us samples of the various pok√© fishes (all were delicious and fresh). I liked how he asked if we had any allergies to any foods and I also liked how you can choose what base you want in your bowl (greens, rice or quinoa - or half and half of any two. Nice!). My kid and I both customized our bowls; she got the two scoop pok√© bowl with tuna, I got the one scoop with salmon. The portions were large and there were tons of toppings to add on. Most of the toppings were standard but a few would have cost a surcharge, so we didn't order those. (Without the Groupon, my small bowl and my kid's regular bowl, with no extra-priced toppings and no drinks, would have cost $23.50. Perhaps that's the norm for pok√©, I'm not sure. Again, it's worth it for me when we're talking about raw fish. It doesn't pay to scrimp!). It's great that they have lids by the sauce/condiment table, so you can package up leftovers (which we both had. Again, portions are big here!). I heard the girl at the front counter helping other customers when we were eating and she was as pleasant and helpful to them as our guy was to us. Really nice staff here!My only reservations (and these are, of course, subjective): I got a few hard, thin seaweed or greens stems/sticks in my bowl and had to spit them out. They were hard and inedible. Also, I wasn't a fan of the imitation crab; it didn't taste real to me. The lids are really hard to fit on the bowls (at least, the small size ones, anyhow. The medium bowl lids fit fine. The smalls, not so much)."},{"name":"Mango Mango Dessert Atlanta","address":"5177-A Buford Hwy NE","city":"Doraville","stars":"4","text":"Some friends and I wanted to sample a few items on the menu (all of them, really), but we decided to each order a different item and share.

After what seemed like forever, we finally got up and decided to order the following at the counter:Durian Dessert Bowl $8\\nTriple Ice Cream Delight: green tea, mango, and vanilla $6\\nStrawberry Mango Juice Sago & Lychee Jelly with Mango Ice Cream $7\\nMango Sundae $6.50The group favorite was the durian dessert bowl. The bowl had real chunks of fresh durian fruit as well as bananas and a durian cream base. It was durian heaven! I am actually not a fan of the fruit, but I love anything durian flavor and this bowl did not disappoint. My second favorite was the triple ice cream delight. Their ice cream flavors were on point. The strawberry mango juice and the mango sundae were just okay. The mango sundae was my least favorite out of the four. The presentation for all four were lovely. Almost as lovely as the cafe's interior.The staff was friendly and very accommodating. They knew we wanted to share our dessert so they brought us extra bowls and spoons.

Five stars seems just about right. I loved the old shuck shack but this space is working so well as Weather Up. They've put all these perty white tables out back. Between that, the xeriscaped patio, the upstairs wrap around porch, it's classy with a C. Instead of a K, which is how I usually roll. We perused the leather bound menu of what looked like 50 cocktails. We both decided on a beverage and patiently awaited the precious drinks. They arrived in small glasses, perfectly mixed and in a timely manner, despite the server warning us that it might take some time. Then of course, we got another one. Instead of ordering off the menu, I gave them a flavor profile and the bartenders figured it out -- using champagne, lillet and lemon with muddled grapes. I didnt know whether to drink it or rub it in my eyes. It was fresh and bubbly -- just perfect for a warm day. Though we didn't experience this, my concern is that it's going to get super busy and it will actually take a long time to get drinks. Also, the majority of the place is patio so hopefully they've got some kind of shade or fan system to deal with the heat of the summer. Don't quote me on this because I just got a little card with our total but it seems like drinks ran about $10 each. Also, they're cash only right now. All in all, a great addition to the east side scene and stumbling distance from friends houses.

The ice cream tasted fresh and flavorful, the doughnuts (which I opted for instead of a cup, cone, waffle cone, or cookie base) were also fresh and served as an amazing \\"sandwich\\" for the ice cream. The young woman who waited on me was extremely helpful. She let me sample the scoops I was considering getting and the deliciousness of the ice cream clinched it.  I'd strongly recommend this place to anyone in the downtown area who is looking for a sweet treat. One note though: even though there is seating in the shop, I did not see any high chairs. It's possible I missed them, but I tend to look for that as the mom of a toddler.

We were there around 10pm on a Thursday night and there were about 4-5 people other than ourselves there. The restaurant is really three connected spaces. ¬†A celebration space with a dance floor, a restaurant and a soon-to-be market featuring organic meats.\\n¬†\\nWe ordered the vegetable samosas which arrived hot and in a timely manner. The stuffing was the classic peas and potatoes seasoned with curry and tasted delicious. The pumpkin soup consisted of a base of bouillon and noodles with pumpkin puree blended in. It was warm, seasonal and tasty.As an entr√©e we tried a variety of grilled meats, the beef boti, which was extremely tender and, although I'm not certain, seemed to be prepared with papaya paste which serves to tenderize the beef protein into a very soft consistency almost like liver. This was hot and grilled to medium well temperature. The Malai chicken boti was sublime! It was tender cutlet of chicken breast, marinated in yogurt, garlic paste and several other traditional spices then grilled to perfection. The Chicken Reshmi is similar in some ways to the Turkish \\"Adana\\" kebab. It consists of ground, marinated chicken mixed with savory herbs and spices then hand-formed into a kebab skewer and grilled. This was mouth-watering and delicious. The meats were served on a bed of spiced basmati rice and a side of fresh vegetable salad.We also wanted to try an Indian classic, the Tandoori chicken. The chicken was marinated perfectly and was coated with Tandoori spices and baked. It was moist, tasty and well-seasoned. Apparently, the chef is a master of the marinade because all the meats we tasted were marinated to perfection, which can be an art in itself and an often undervalued step in the cooking process.In an area with many restaurant choices, this is a welcome addition with delicious food. Definitely worth a try!"},{"name":"Austin Tea Xchange Cafe","address":"13011 Shops Pkwy, Ste 600","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"The food was tasty but the cost of the tea's I thought were pricy.

The restaurant was packed when we arrived, which was always a good a sign. We decided to try the Edamame Dumplings, White Mushroom Pizza, and Flourless Chocolate Cake.The dumplings were perfectly cooked, soft edamame filling on the inside with a slightly chewy outer shell. The sauce that the dumplings rested on was flavorful, and complemented the edamame filling. However, one minor complain is that the filling lacked some seasoning, and tasted slightly bland compared to the sauce. The pizza was good, crispy and thin crust with white sauce and asparagus. The asparagus and mushrooms went very well together, but there was a bit too much salt combined with the cheese that made the flavor overall too salty. Finally, the flourless chocolate cake doesn't get better than True Kitchen's. The cake had a deep chocolate flavor that was not too sweet combined with the vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. Eaten together, each bite was delightful, especially with the added crunch of the cocoa nibs.Overall, our brunch was very yummy, and we can't wait to try the other dishes in the menu!"},{"name":"Counter Culture","address":"2337 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I found this old review.

But if you're looking for pizza delivery just pick it up from the store or go somewhere else. The pizza is good, standard quality for Upper Crust (ie ultra thin crust, good sauce and toppings). But they outsource their delivery services to DoorDash, so the delivery quality (ie speed, how friendly the driver is, etc) ranges WILDLY. I've had some pizzas come 10 minutes before or 90 minutes after the estimated time Upper Crust has on their web pizza tracker (even though I live less than 10 miles away).I understand they can't control what DoorDash does but it would be nice to have a heads up that they aren't going to be delivering using their own employees.

It's been around since the 1960s. Although they have quite a large number of sandwich options their claim to fame is their pastrami so being a fan of pastrami and Katz, I had to check it out. Being in Boston I also had to try their clam chowder. First of all, LaGrassa's already have a few strikes against it right away. They're only open from 11-3:30, their seating is extremely limited, and there is almost always a line. Putting that aside they do take cards, they are very friendly, and they keep the line moving quite fast with their efficiency. All their bread options are incredibly fresh and the meat is all cooked in house and sliced to order (by machine, not hand). They do slice the meat thick and pile it on so the $13 or so goes a long way. The value is definitely there. They only give you half of a pickle and it's a half sour which to me just tastes like a cucumber. The pastrami wasn't quite as hot as I would have liked it and had more sweetness to the seasoning than I would have preferred but overall was excellent. I have no problem saying it's the second best pastrami sandwich I've had after Katz. Though it's a distant second as far as a simple pastrami sandwich goes. LaGrassa's does have a significantly larger menu of unique signature sandwiches though.  What took me off guard was how good the clam chowder was. They had one of the best clam chowders I've ever had. It wasn't too thick or thin and had plenty of tender clams, bacon, and seasoning. For not being a soup or seafood centered shop I was really surpised at the quality of the chowder and wouldn't hesitate waiting in line again just for the chowder."},{"name":"Suzette Creperie","address":"3342 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Don't get me wrong, but our crepes were great!

Stopping in to a spot despite less than stellar reviews on Yelp. We had a hard time finding our original destination out this direction so we just dropped in to this spot for a quick meal. $15 netted us a large plate of nachos, a plate of birria complete with beans, rice and tortillas, and three street tacos. Oh, and a Mineragua. That's definitely cheap. Cheap enough for me to wonder where this food is coming from. But when you're dinning this deep in E. Portland, you just roll with it. Plainly put, the food here definitely left much to be desired. The nachos didn't have enough cheese, and too much in the way of pasty refried beans. The birria was decent but not great. Nothing compared to the version from El Pato Feliz. H. B.'s tacos were just okay. The standout flavor of the meal came from one of the salsas in the self-serve salsa bar - a slightly roast-y, slighly nutty flavored thick red sauce that was labeled as Haba√±ero (it wasn't)  that we simply couldn't get enough of. Likely an arbol salsa. Don't get me wrong, the food here isn't bad, it just isn't good. for the quantity and the price, you don't make out too poorly.

In exactly 20 minutes they came looking for us to sit even though we stepped outside with our drinks and were mid conversation. Relax. The bar tender was enjoyable. Anyway we followed the host to our table and felt very rushed by our waiter to order and keep it moving. Ordered lobster fitters which were so salty and fried that's all you could taste, ordered escargot that was not typical and just had fried onions thrown on top- yuck. Thank god we ordered the bone marrow that was fantastic. Finally for our entrees we ordered porterhouse for two with blue cheese butter. Smallest $108 porterhouse I've ever seen- too charred on outside that came out with no blue cheese butter. Our waiter brought it out on the side after we asked, basically a ramekin of butter sprinkled with 4 blue cheese bits for $3.50. The plate that the steak was on wasn't even hot so it became cold in 5 minutes. I was happy they let my husband choose a desert complimentary for his birthday before rushing us out the door for $250.

Any of their pastrami sandwiches are bomb dot com. They're all perfectly seasoned and full of flavor. I love the coleslaw that comes with it.The sandwiches are pricier than the average, ranging from $11 to $12 but the portions are huge so you can most definitely wrap the other half of your sandwich up for later.

I reminded him that this mysterious \\"rule\\" was not posted and that he needs to think twice before trying to extort patrons. He ruined the otherwise great experience. I would have nibbled at dessert but did not feel comfortable after his assertive comment. Instead, I decided it would be best to leave than to feel his eyes burning into my skull for wasting the sacred KiKu sticky rice.

I have held off on an update, but my last visit warrants the update.   So, I like a Burger King burger.  They have the typical BK menu.   I generally have not had an issue with the food itself.   However, there is often issues with service and cleanliness.  My last visit I stopped in to order a burger in early weekday afternoon.   I ended up walking out.   Probably not the first time I have walked out of here.    Guess I like that flame broiled burger taste. I stopped and walked into the restaurant.   There wasn't anyone in line at the drive-thru, but I have too many bad experiences with drive-thru's.  So, I stopped inside for a carry out order.   Nobody around.   Nobody at the front counter.  Nobody at the driver thru window.   Grill cook was missing.   I remember feeling a little concern about safety because nobody was around.   Another patron and her kids walked in a couple minutes after I did.   Still nobody.   It's not been uncommon when I have stopped in that there isn't anyone staffing the front counter.   Definitely a security issue for the restaurant. After about 5 or so minutes, I did see an individual who I later realized was the grill cook.  He tried to flag others in the back, but they didn't respond to him.  So, he came to the front and stumbled through trying to take my order.   He captured all my order except for taking my payment.   At that point, someone entered the drive-thru as you could hear the bell.   A woman in the back walked over to the drive-thru window.  The young man helping at the front counter promptly walked back to the grill area. The woman at the drive thru started taking the window order.   She also gave the young man grief who was helping. She exhorted him by saying \\"What are you doing?!  That's not your position.\\"  I and the patron behind me told her that we had been standing and waiting for awhile.    She peeked out and looked toward the back, but nobody appeared.   At that point, I told her \\"I'm done.  You've lost a customer.\\"  I looked at the grill cook and said \\"Thank-you for attempting to help.\\" I walked out only to hear the woman at the drive-thru say a disingenuous \\"Merry Christmas\\".   This was just one experience.   I have had other service issues in the past as well, but I dismissed it as the burger was good and this is a fast food restaurant.Cleanliness has often been an issue around the fountain drink machine.  It's often have spills around it.  Out of ice and fountain drinks too.  Can see dropped food, like fries, on the floor behind the counter, too.  It is bad here.

But it's not really fair to judge after one visit, and there are other items on the menu that intrigue me, so I'll likely be back.  Consider this a review of my sandwich more than anything else I guess.AJ's Cafe isn't far from Capitol Square.  It's a block a way. But even though I work right downtown, it's not a place I think of often. For whatever reason, that block matters. Out of sight, out of mind I guess.  But this past week, I was looking for something different than the usual lunch options and so I ventured in.They have a cold case with prepared sandwiches, so if you're looking for a quick grab-n-go, this is probably the quickest option downtown. No waiting even to make your lunch!  The rest of the menu, while not long, is interesting.  The Indian flavors present in several of the options reflect the past experiences of the owner.I ended up with the CTM sandwich--a panini filled with chicken tikka masala, cheddar cheese, and lettuce.  The highlight of the sandwich was definitely the tikka masala sauce in which the chicken was tossed.  (The chicken itself was fine.  It appeared to have been made plain and then tossed in the sauce.)  The flavor was good and reasonably complex.  There was ample cheese and it, like the lettuce, did not detract from the sandwich.  But for me, didn't add much either.As I said before, there are several other sandwiches on the menu that sound interesting, including a tilapia sandwich and a meatball sandwich.  I'll probably be back to check them out. One of the reasons that I'll be back is that they're super friendly there. The staff was welcoming and pleasant.Also a plus, they offer mini bags of Grippos as a potato chip option.

They are so insanely good I will shout it from rooftops. \\nAs our second dish, we got the Muu Kham Waan which was sliced pork marinated in some SPICY as hell Thai Chilies. They serve some mustard greens and ice for those who can't handle the spice! While this dish was certainly spicy, the tangy sauce, the spice, the flavour of the pork was phenomenal. It was suggested to eat with sticky rice and I had no idea how sticky that rice could be, but it acted like a little bun to grab the pork and also cool the tongue.We also got the Cha Ca \\"La Vong\\"  which was cat fish with cold rice vermicelli noodles. Interesting and a bit more bland compared to our other dishes, so it definitely got outshone. I am not sure I'd order this one again, but was nice to end on a not so spicy note.Aside from eating, we also got the Kafae Boraan Yen which was described as \\"sock brewed\\" thai iced coffee with condensed milk. Definitely sweet but good to have on hand for the spice. Not as good as thai iced milk tea in my opinion but glad I tried it. Also got durian ice cream. It was served pretty hard which is kind of strange and not sure what they can do to counter measure that issue, but it was so delicious.

Simplicity.  Less is more when your final product is going to be a roasted meat.  Marinades and rubs with a few well-chosen herbs that persist throughout the cooking process is half the shawarma battle.2. Perfect doneness.  If the flavoring is great but you overcook the meat, it's all for naught.  Most Middle Eastern restaurants in the Greater Boston area make this mistake.  Shawarma Place has both these techniques down for the most part.  Whether I order chicken, beef, or lamb, it is always cooked perfectly.  The meat has a crust but it retains its moisture on the inside, even after spending some time wrapped in foil while sitting in the delivery driver's car.  I would order the beef and lamb shawarma again, both the roll-ups and the plates, but the chicken is the star of the show.  It's a testament to their skill that they can make chicken their most delicious dish.Speaking of which, the flavor profile is impressive.  You can tell that a Middle Eastern restaurant knows their stuff when the flavors are subtle but varied and interesting at the same time.  Simple but fresh food that nevertheless has some giddyap to it is the name of the game and Shawarma Place is in the major leagues as far as I'm concerned.Don't let the unassuming exterior and tiny dining area fool you, by the way.  There's two reasons for this.  First, the proprietor has chosen to let his food do the talking.  When you bite into the meat, you'll realize that he has chosen substance over form.  Second, almost as a rule, the more unassuming a shawarma restaurant is, the more authentic the food is going to be.  My family used to take trips to towns all over the United Arab Emirates.  In rest areas and suburbs, we would come across hole-in-the-wall restaurants that looked a bit like pawn shops from the outside.  But the flavor of their kebabs and shawarma would make you believe in god.  The reason for this is that these guys are incredibly passionate about their cooking skills and not much else, including interior decoration.  They take your order with a quiet confidence that comes with the know-how to back it up.Shawarma Place is the only shawarma joint in the area that has that old-school vibe.

We concurred it tasted like, well, tasty potpourri. But in a good way! I don't know that it would be to everyone's tastes, but I'd say worth a try at any rate.We started by splitting a special, a scallop appetizer. It could have easily been a lighter entree, with five or six well spiced and perfectly cooked scallops over some thin slices of pear and a bed of greens in a gorgonzola dressing. Delicious. Both of us went for the lamb for our entree, and I was surprised when the proprietress/server recommended that we order the chops medium or medium-well, since usually lamb is considered ideal at medium-rare. She was right though, as the chops, while only having the slightest hint of pink, were still tender. They were served over couscous, a bit of a tasty sauce,  a mixture of some greens and shallots, and, tucked away under the couscous, a sweet and flavor-packed puck of an almond tartlet. Exquisite, and to my mind a good portion--not a ton of food, but not skimpy either.The service had been great until that point, when we were left waiting what felt like a really really long time before our plates were cleared, long enough for me to go back to poking around the bones and discover a missed bit of lamb, but just shy of the amount of time it would have taken for me to abandon etiquette, pick up the bones and chew off the remaining shreds. Tempting though. Once she finally came back, she asserted that the spiced chocolate torte was the dessert to split, and oh man. Do not doubt the server here, as she steered us right each time. Rich dark chocolate with hints of cardamom and anise, served with tart raspberry sorbet and whipped cream.For $40 (bring your cash!) per person, including a generous tip, I found it a good deal for such great food, and will absolutely be back."},{"name":"C&S Seafood & Oyster Bar","address":"3240 Cobb Pkwy SE, Ste 118","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Dropped in today for a business lunch.

Jamie had steak and fried rice for main and calamari for appetizer.  FYI he does not like calamari and usually just takes a few bites from my plate, today it became his. The dipping sauce was so delicious that he asked for two and saved one just incase there would be something else for him to dip into it. He said the fried rice was the best he had ever had and even contemplated getting some to go. Before we left he said we will be stopping back by on Saturday before we leave to get some rice for our road trip back to Atlanta.  I almost forgot about the steak, in 8 years I have never seen him order a steak and not ask for steak sauce even the priciest waygu steak he has to have sauce."},{"name":"Shigezo Izakaya","address":"910 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"My wife (Japanese - immigrated to US in 2009) and I (American with lots of travel to/from Japan) both really enjoyed Shigezo...

I had called ahead to the front desk and received excellent instructions on getting to the property using Portland's Tri Met transit system. On arrival, we learned there was a \\"boil notice\\" issued by the City due to e-coli in the water supply. Notices were posted at the hotel cautioning guests not to drink tap water and letting us know that the two bottles of water in our room would be complementary. Once in the room, we realized we could not use the ice machine. A call to the front asking about ice, and within a few minutes someone arrived with a bag of ice purchased at a nearby grocery store. Wow! That's service! Updates on the water situation were given periodically.Our server at the bar, Chris, recommended a few restaurants nearby and let us know the free hotel shuttle would take us anywhere within a 3 mile radius of the hotel. This was a huge help and saved our sore feet at the end of a busy day of using TriMet to get around the city.Pros: immaculately clean rooms, great service, real fan in the bathroom, GREAT blinds which actually kept the room dark. Loved the easily accessible charging options on desk and bedside lamps. (No crawling around on the floor looking for outlets!) Free shuttle service.Cons: no in-room safe, rather noisy if you're unlucky enough to be on the street side. Not a very nice neighborhood. Parking is valet only, glad we didn't have a car.Tip: The free shuttle is a great plus, but on a busy weekend there is up to an hour wait.

If you get the daily specials ($13.95), you can get the ramen of the day, sushi, and a side of rice with a topping (Tuesday is a piece of fried chicken with 2 fried asparagus. Not really worth it IMO). However, Monday's is unagi on rice and that is bomb within itself. The broth, like most ramen places, it is pretty salty--I could feel my blood pressure rising with every slurp of the soup. The noodles were just the way I like it. The meat is sliced very thinly, as thin as my patience gets with some people. The egg is a hard boiled egg, so no runny egg like santouka. The 3 sushi pieces here are pretty small compared to your average sushi joint, however, it is a side and I guess the main dish is, the ramen (jk it's me).

I'm always in the hunt for the perfect cup of coffee and like to patronize independent coffee houses like this one. First of all, the setting for this coffee house is nice. There are large windows across the side of the building that look out on Piedmont Street. While you sip on your coffee, you have a nice view of the street scene, though I don't think there is so much pedestrian traffic right in that area. The coffee houses itself has kind of a chic industrial look and feel. I had just a regular coffee there, but what they have is two different types of pour over coffees that they prepare fresh for you. I forget the exact type of bean I selected, but it was a dark and rich coffee. It's nice to get a freshly prepared pour over cup instead of something that may have been brewed a half hour ago. I also liked the fact that they had chilled water available in a water dispenser for patrons to take freely from. This is a really good choice for a cup of coffee and j would recommend it highly if you're in the area. The only problem is that it is a little difficult to get to, since you need to find the entrance to the parking for the office building it is housed in, which is not so clear if you're not familiar with the area."},{"name":"What's Pho","address":"5840 W Irlo Bronson M Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3","text":"GREAT FOR VEGANS:::This place was amazing.

For those that don't know sweet tomatoes is a buffet restaurant that focuses mainly on salad and soup. When you walk in there are 2 buffet lines ( both are exactly the same). The buffet starts off with about 4 pre made salads that they have as their specialities. My favorite salad that I love is the Asian salad that they have at the front. It is the one of the reasons I love to go to sweet tomatoes ( I am not much of a salad person). The salad has a refreshing dressing and wonton strips to add some crunch. They rotate some of their pre made salads depending the time of the year. The rest of the buffet is basically a build your own massive salad buffet. Everything you can think of including dressings are on the buffet line. One you reach the end of the buffet you pay the cashier and then sit yourself. Make sure to check online for coupons, as we were able to find one for 2 buffets and 2 drinks for 24 dollars. There is also a 15% discount if you check in on yelp but that does not include soda. Cashier told us to use our first coupon because we will be saving 8 dollars with it. The rest of the buffet they have about 10 different types of soups, some different mini pizza/ flat breads, different flavored muffins, a loaded potato bar , and a pasta section ( 3 different choices). To be honest the pasta did not seem very appetizing. Make sure to try the blueberry muffins with some honey butter. I can eat those all day. The focaccia bread is also delicious. I tried the corn chowder which I thought had good flavor. Sweet tomatoes is known from making everything from scratch and you can really taste it with the soup and the muffins. They also have a strawberry lemonade that it a must try. Always a staple when I come here. After filling up on the salad and soup they have a dessert with an ice cream machine and different toppings. Add a chocolate muffin to your ice cream and it taste like a brownie a la mode. Overall I highly recommend sweet tomatoes, especially if you are near the outlets. The plaza it's in is a little difficult to get into, but worth the hassle. A buffet with salad and soup can't go wrong. If you stick to the right food then it could be a healthy experience ( I still recommend the blueberry muffins). Fairly priced ($25 for 2 people) for what you get."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I wanted to like this place.... Really I did. And?

I had ordered two sides with our steaks, the steaks were great. The side of asparagus was less than flavorful and I got one incorrect side, which the waiter then proceeded to tell me that's what I had ordered. I order the twice baked potatoes (au gratin), and received a plain baked potato. Instead of acknowledging that he had misinterpreted what I had said. The lobster bisque also lacked flavor.

Trying to decide between Zaftigs and Allston Diner.  We decided on Allston Diner because last time we went out for a Sunday breakfast we chose Zaftig so off we go!!At first I was kinda of excited to get a spot out front. Then I saw that there were many spots in front.  I should have seen this as foreshadowing of something ominous.  \\nIt was 8:30 and the place had so many open tables so we got seated right away.  \\nFirst we noticed that the menus were new and they had expanded the waffle selection.  Someone came over and we ordered black teas. I asked what selection of muffins they had today. She said they didn't have any. Huh?? How is that possible.  We got there so early - sad.  \\nTeas came over shortly thereafter. I ordered the Graceland - waffle with peanut butter, banana, bacon and maple syrup.  She got French toast and a side of home fries.  \\nAfter the waitress walked away we noticed the the black tea was decaf.  I thought it strange so I called her over.  She said matter of factly that yes black tea is decaf.  Ummm, who orders that??\\nSigh - ok I will deal with this.  \\nThe food kind of took an eternity to get there.  Thankfully I had such a lovely breakfast companion to wait with me for eternity.  \\nI gazed around the place and it seemed like many of the cute decorations were gone and the place looked kind of blah.  \\nI started to think that something dreadful had occurred.  New management?\\nI asked the waitress and she confirmed.  \\nThe food finally came and it was a bit odd.  Her home fries came first and the were cubes not there usual slices. I will say they were actually tasty.  \\nHer French toast came on a black plastic plate.  It was 3 slices of white bread French toast sprinkled with powdered sugar.  I did not try it but I was told that it had very little flavor and it was not hot.  \\nMine was one almost slightly warm soggy waffle with dollops of peanut butter, slices of banana and sprinkles of bacon pieces.  Perhaps there was some syrup drizzled on it but none on the side.  \\nIt tasted exactly like a soggy eggo waffle.  The only thing I can come up with is that they made it in advance, froze it, and nuked it. I don't know how you can make a waffle soggy other than that. \\nI really wanted to have them try again but I was so hungry at this point anything would do. \\nIt was quite unappealing but I ate most of it.  I was pretty surprised at how little food we got for the price.  It was $12 for 1 thin soggy waffle with a bit of stuff on top.  \\nThe bill with tip was $40 for 2 teas, 1 waffle, 3 slices of French toast and a side of home fries.  Service over all was lackluster and sparse.  I am so sad. I hate when my restaurant gets taken away from me. It's just ruined.

We stopped in near closing last night and got our order to-go. The owner is very kind, funny and actually cooks in the kitchen along side his employees. I told him absolutely no egg or dairy; tzatziki or feta (he generously accommodated the substitutions without additional costs). The food was so fresh, from the various homemade salads and dips to falafels and pita... I recommend the Mezza Platter, the Falafel Sandwich with garlic fries or even just an order of Falafel and Hummus (a half order is quite large, I'm interested to know what a whole order looks like!). The Mezza Platter has homemade tabouli, tomato/cucumber salad, a tomato base (almost like salsa), pickled cabbage and fermented cabbage - the flavors are out of this world! The Falafel Sandwiches are stuffed into a pita pocket with all of the mentioned salads, FIVE falafels and extra tahini/hummus (instead of tzatziki/feta). I have no idea how they are capable of packing so much into such a small space but nothing really falls out. The Falafels are handmade and freshly fried, as well as the garlic fries (topped with garlic, lemon juice and paprika - so good!), crisp on the outside while fluffy and moist on the inside.

I'm sure leaving your child unattended is a policy at majority of places and is not safe especially at a busy restaurant.

Truffle fries: fabulous. We got them as an appetizer (HUGE) and some also came with my burger. We had about 3 pounds of french fries left, which we obvi got wrapped to go. It would be sacrilegious to waste truffle fries.\\n2. Bacon: there was bacon on my burger and on my friend's salad. I think it was the best bacon of all time. While eating it, I literally just kept saying, \\"this is the best bacon of all time\\". I was also kinda drunk by that point (see point #3), but seriously, the bacon was amazing.\\n3. Apple cider martini: if you asked me which cocktail I'd marry, I'd say this one. It was ridiculously good. I'm craving another one as I write this. I managed to go through 3 during dinner... and each one had more and more vodka in it. Yum.\\n4. Decor: I really liked it. The room is super small (maybe 10-12 tables). They also had bar stools and a lounge-y area. I felt like if this bar was in a more popular location, it would be packed every night. But since it's in the middle of nowhere (okay, in the Financial District), it was dead by 9:30/10pm on a Thursday. It would be a great place to go on a date or to go with a few friends to sit and talk.Things I didn't like:\\n1. Bathroom: The bathroom is secretly hidden down a hallway and not really connected to the restaurant. I arrived early and decided to go to the bathroom, which turned into a bit of an adventure/scavenger hunt. They have signs leading you down the hallway and to the bathroom, but the door with the last sign had been shut accidentally- and I wandered around opening random doors trying to find the bathroom. Eventually I ran into someone carrying plates and he apologized and pointed me in the right direction... still sketchy though.We had 5 cocktails, a burger, a salad and an appetizer.

Oxymoron alert! Mad Mex is mexican food for college kids. The location helps that conclusion as does the drunky roudy college kids at the bar late-nite. The restaurant has a cool vibe and I like the set-up there. Really, nothing at Mad Mex is actually delicious, but for some reason it's OK. You don't get free chips and salsa, but when they're not there, I don't miss them. The drinks are on the cheap side ($5 big ass margaritas), but they are not good at all. They taste watered down and the sour mix is very strange and not sweet at all, but rather just sour. My boyfirend tried their twist on a mojito and it was probably the worst drink I've ever tasted. Unpalitable. I'd probably stick with bottled beer. That's safe. \\nThey have a huge menu with, surprisingly, a lot of vegetarian options. On Monday's they have all you can eat burritos for $5.99, which my group partook in one time. It was a value for sure. Nothing was amazing, but it sure was filling. \\nBoth times I've been to Mad Mex I've had a good time, I think that's why I like it so well. Not to mention, both times we had the same server, who was excellent. Just a college aged guy who was really on his serving game!

Long lines around the building...wow..really.I've always wanted to try this place as some of my friends was telling me how good it was and they only make a few batches until they sell out.  I've finally had the opportunity on my day off.Only 1 asian works here and it happens to be a waitress.  Everyone else were white young guys.  But we thought, this place is busy so these guys prob figured a special ingredient for success.  WRONG!I will credit them for the richness in the broth, but the taste is not good.  It was worse than packaged Ramen noodles.  The noodles were not fresh tasting as well.  Here's where it starts to get irritating.  They literally only put 1 thin slice of meat of pork.  Compared to a Vietnamese bowl of Pho, you get about 10-15.  If you order the Pho Meat balls, its much bigger.  Just for the base cost of a bowl of Ramen (no toppings), its started out at $9 and that includes a whopping 1 slice of pork.  When you start to add the toppings like a whole egg, it goes up to $1.50. But like I said, the soup was NOT GOOD.  I finished 20% and my wife 30% before we walked out to get lunch else where.The owner imports the COKE.  On my receipts, its says, \\"MEXICAN COKE\\" and they charge $2.75 for 12 oz bottle.  I guess the owners doesn't know that Coke is also made in the USA.  Why the hell is he importing Coke from Mexico and jacking up the prices.  I can get a case of 12 (16oz) Coke from HEB for almost the same price.  I guess they want to be known as the only place in town where you can get bottled Coke.On the plus side, the owners did an ingenuous low cost interior to the place that gives it a cool vibe.  But food did not meet up to expectation.The owners have convinced Americans its ok to spend at least $9 on noodles and broth.Save your money... go get some good Pho.  A $7 bowl of Pho is much larger, has more meat and taste better!This Ramen is a hype and wont be around in 5 years time.Also, I notice lots of young college kids go here.

I like the vegetable combination of cabbage, broccoli, and carrots.  The vegetables are cooked just the way I like them but, needed a little seasoning. The chicken teriyaki was well seasoned, very tender and flavorful.  There was no counting the grains with this rice, it was very mushy.  The rice that didn't get hit with that awesome teriyaki sauce was very bland.  Although, had the rice been cooked perfectly, the amount of sauce added to the dish would have been sufficient.

Some other customers was also wondering why no one was attending the back stall as well.  Finally my bf went back to the food truck to ask for service, that's when I finally received that horchata. Overall, food and the service was alright.

Personally I thought these wings were too salty and didn't have enough of a fish sauce taste. I found it difficult to eat more than 1-2 wings. I also ordered the Kung Op Wun Sen and the Papaya Pok Pok. The Papaya salad was amazing and I really enjoyed it. It had a really good spicy level and the flavors were addicting. The Kung Op Wun Sen is a noodle dish with prawns and pork belly. I thought it tasted great as well but as I ordered it for 4 people, there was 4 small slices if pork belly and 4 prawns. Personally, I think this is quite overpriced for how much they give you. The rice and sticky rice is also $3ÔøΩ? a cup.Lastly I ordered the dessert and I LOVED it. I didn't  know I enjoyed durian desserts until I had their Durian custard with sticky rice. I also had their ice cream and the vietnamese coffee with condensed milk ice cream which was also all really good.Pok Pok is worth to try but due to its price I definitely won't be coming here very often at all."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Small place in the North End that serves up delicious Italians style pastas.

I had never heard of it and had assumed it was a food truck...turns out it's pretty much the opposite of what you'd expect from a food truck (except for the atmosphere).I think Valerie L sums it up best by saying \\"this isn't the best Thai food I ever had, but it definitely is delicious.\\" None of the dishes we had would be considered Thai - maybe Pok Pok is better described as \\"Southeast Asian Fusion.\\" And that's a culinary style I would love to see more of because it is amazing. But what I think is ultimately preventing me from shelling out the 5 stars with abandon is the price and the overly hyped Fish Sauce Chicken Wings. I could faintly taste the difference in chicken quality compared to what I usually get in Chinatowns or Costcos in California (i.e., hormone-pumped goodness), but the sauce and flavor of the chicken wings themselves were really nothing special. Because of the price ($14?!), it's not something I would order again next time I visit.What I did love was literally everything else. We ordered the catfish vermicelli with herbs and the Burmese-inspired pork belly stew (both $15 each). We were in heaven. The vermicelli was quite possibly the best I ever had and helped offset the oils from the catfish. The catfish was cooked to perfection, not a single bite tasted rubbery, and the peanuts worked seamlessly with the herbs to enhance the fish. The pork belly stew was nothing novel for me, but the tenderness of the meat really blew my mind. Every bite was perfect and the curry was rich with flavor and fat. I highly recommend ordering a bowl of rice if you're going to eat this dish. All and all, a great dining experience. Even now, as I write this review MONTHS after this meal, I feel like I can relive the whole thing. The flavors of these dishes are very vivid, and they stay with you long after you've digested!I'm also a huge fan of Pok Pok's drinking vinegars. I ordered the ginger flavor and highly recommend it. We were too stuffed to even try a dessert, but I noticed people opted to get their sugar cravings satisfied at the nearby Salt & Straw.On a random note, I love how Pok Pok deals with its popularity - you can put your name on a waitlist and then you'll be directed to right across the street to the Whiskey Soda Lounge, a bar with one of the most extravagant selections of whiskeys I've ever seen. Once your table is ready, the host or your waiter at Whiskey Soda Lounge will notify you. Genius business move on the part of the owners of Pok Pok, but also great for customers too because it's a fantastic way to kill time. The Whiskey Soda Lounge also has some noms (like the chicken wings, not that I'd recommend them) and even the drinking vinegars that I am now obsessed with. And in case you are wondering, yes you will definitely have to wait, unless you arrive very early for lunch.

Unfortunately, I am allergic to peanuts and ate them as they were but still liked the tang from the satay seasoning. For our mains, we got chicken pad thai and chicken green curry. The pad thai had many chicken chunks, some tofu and was a little bit over sauced in a sweet and tangy sauce. The green curry was ordered milk but still had a nice heat to if with bamboo, eggplant, chicken and peppers. It was very delicious delivering in both coconut and spice and went perfect with the (unfortunately small) portion of rice. Overall, we were really happy with the food we had tonight and although prices are a bit higher, its a good place for Thai dishes!"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The hype is real. Was excited to try this place but was disappointed that this place was just a hype.The famous Ike's wings were way salty and expensive. I have had much better and cheaper back home in California.The pork belly curry was great. However they only gave 4 pieces of pork belly. Curry was very spicy FYI. Combination of the curry and coconut rice was recommended which was what we got but I thought that the rice was too overpowering.The waiters were rude to everyone. I sat outside on the bar so I could see everything going on. After waiting a good 10 minutes for someone to take our order, we finally waved someone over only to have him shut us down and to tell us to talk to our server. And then as time goes on I see him be equally as rude to others who were standing on the sidewalk waiting to be seated - people were confused by the chaos and naturally had questions. The last thing I heard him say was \\"do you have a reservation?\\" \\"no? Wait over there.\\" they were all really busy and I could see all the waiters hustling but as a customer I expected to be treated as a paying customer. They all looked like they hated their job- just an observation.I highly recommend getting a reservation. Line was long and people were given an 1.5 hrs to 2 hours waiting time. I personally won't be coming here again."},{"name":"Eddie George's Grille 27","address":"4575-4667 Sawyer Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"2.5","text":"Poor customer service.

Located between Baker and Royellou off 3rd Ave, Wave is a sushi joint located in a multi-story complex. There isn't a ton of signage for the restaurant aside from a small sign pointing you upstairs. Be aware that the bathrooms are outside the restaurant on multiple floors.We entered the restaurant and were able to grab a table right away (around 6pm). The place filled up about an hour or so after we arrived. The front part of the restaurant is designed to look nice, but the back portion where the seating is located is pretty average, including being able to see fridges and other things I'd expect more at a takeout place rather than a sit-down sushi spot. We sat down and were all handed menus. We looked over the various options as somebody put in an order for some sake. The menu is the standard \\"meals on one side/sushi on the other\\" design. However, some of the options that we saw on Yelp that we wanted to try weren't included. I'm not sure if those items are off-menu or not since the waitress just said we could order them if we wanted when we brought them up. The service in general was fine, although we did run into issues of having to wait a fairly long amount of time for food (tbf they did warn us that the special rolls would take longer) and inbetween dishes for various people.In terms of the food, I ordered the Heart Attack roll and the Surf and Turn roll (the latter took something like 45 minutes to come out). The Heart Attack roll is comprised of bacon, cream cheese and some other basic ingredients. While I'm a big fan of adding cooked items like bacon to sushi, the combination of ingredients didn't really make a very unique taste. Maybe it was because I ordered it without jalapenos, but I thought it was just ok.The saving grace for our meal though was the Surf and Turn roll. I'm not sure what exactly is in it, but I believe it includes shrimp and steak and some fun dark and white sauce on top. This roll was AWESOME. The taste was unique and delicious and something I would definitely order again (albeit via pickup or going to dinner with other people).Overall, WAVE Asian Bistro and Sushi didn't quite live up to its Yelp rating for me. While the Surf and Turf was great, the venue, wait times and other food options were fairly mediocre. I wouldn't have a problem trying this place again, but I wouldn't search it out in particular."},{"name":"Woking Dragon","address":"1198 Landsdowne Drive","city":"Coquitlam","stars":"3.5","text":"Welp this has been our go-to chinese establiahment for years, but the most recent menu changes may have us heading elsewhere more often.Son't get me wrong, it's still good... but it's lacking the special moments that made Woking Dragon extraordinary.Gone is the house special crispy noodle. In its place is very standard chicken chow mein. The same kind of chow mein your typical chinese food place has been making since the 70s.The ginger beef strips, once another favorite of ours, is now extra sweet with a sweet and sour sauce or something. It has a little extra spicy kick, which is nice, but it doesn't have the ginger magic it used to.The chop suey is middle-of-the-road as well. Just a few basic veggies in classic cornstarchy thickened goo.So in conclusion. Want chinese food you remember from your childhood? Come here.

This was the right amount of food for three people. I also ordered a pineapple vinegar drink. So. Good. It's like a shrub mixed with soda water basically. The wings were by far my favorite item. They were amazing and came with pickled veggies on the side. I wasn't the biggest fan of the eggplant. The smoky eggplant and boiled egg was an odd combo for me. The noodles were also super good.

When our waiter did finally come, he was incredibly sassy. The remainder of the time he was great, but the initial wait and attitude of our waiter didn't leave a great impression. We shared the lemon ricotta pancakes, and chipotle chicken eggs Benedict. The Benedict was pretty standard (one of the eggs was more like hard-boiled and not poached), but the pancakes were AMAZING. They were fluffy, the berries were fresh, and the lemon curd was just the right amount of sweet--no syrup needed. And also not to sweet that you would feel sick right after.

The brisket is lean yet tender, and the ribs slightly charred with a wonderfully pink smoked center. Delicious! The sides were mediocre. The baked beans were just weird. They were like canned pinto beans with a bit of sugar and chopped white onion. Weird. The Mac and cheese was with a shell noodle that doesn't work in Mac n cheese. And the cheese is thick and gooey, not creamy. \\nThe burgers are less than a quarter pound of meat and only cooked medium rare. Comes with a pile of crispy fries that needed more seasoning.

I'm still not sure about those reviews, to be honest, and I would tend not to trust them.Free of any expectations that might have been set by these glowing reviews, I came in for lunch.  The restaurant has a unique interior, a yellow and black color scheme that was interesting at first. Once I sat down, though, I felt like I was in a library or something.  It's a large open space two stories tall, with a black painted ceiling, dark tile floor, and black and dark wood furniture. The windows at the front are tinted heavily. It's very cavernous and echoey feeling, and with only a handful of people in the place talking quietly to themselves and no music playing, it was oddly silent and a little discomforting.I ordered the Rotisserie Chicken sandwich with macaroni & cheese as the side.  I had wanted fries but they somehow didn't have any oil, so no fries. The sandwich was good -- some of the chicken was a little dry, but it wasn't too bad, and the aioli helped some with that.  I just wish there was more chicken in there. The bread was delicious.  The macaroni & cheese was pretty good, although it really wasn't anything special.In looking at the photos by other customers, I have to wonder what happened to my sandwich.  I see a photo of a Rotisserie Chicken sandwich that looks to be about TWICE the size of the one I received. A sandwich like that probably would have merited at least one extra star.  The plates look like a good size too, I may have to try one of those on a return visit. Hopefully it will merit a review update."},{"name":"True Food Kitchen","address":"222 West Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I've always been satisfied after leaving True Food Kitchen.

The service is usually pretty good unless it's a busy weekend evening.  I like the atmosphere--I don't eat non-fish meat intentionally but the authentic feel of this restaurant with the animals hanging in the area to be prepared makes me feel as if I were in Hong Kong.  Since this restaurant is so popular among Asian locals, the busy background chatter of the patrons also adds to the fun of your experience.The food is hit and miss, but there are more hits than misses.  During busy weekend evenings, there can be a short wait at the front.  If this place was priced fairer, I'd have given it another star.  Taking out-of-towners here would be okay.

Unfortunately, when we got back, there was a huge line and it was quite messy. Parking itself is also difficult but there is free parking in the garage nearby (also for London Drugs). There's these 2 hidden spots for small cars near the elevator entrance too!The normal process is to walk in, order, pay, be assigned a table, and someone will bring your food to your table. Two problems as they try to move to Canada. One, we have no idea how/when to tip, since Japan already has the tip included. Two, on a busy day like Saturday, people will line up from the cashier to outside the restaurant and be confused.The confusion wasn't helped when apparently you need to go inside and talk to the hostess to write your name down on the list. Don't forget to SKIP the line and do this on a busy day. The list is the actual ordering order, and the lineup created by confused customers does not actually do anything. The hostess will occasionally come out and make sure people are on her list, but if you just arrived, anyone else can skip over you and talk to the hostess directly.From the pictures, you can see we ordered the deluxe combo Slice Angus with Kobe Burger, as well as the classic beef pepper rice with egg. I don't know why, but it's $1.00 to add egg to the Kobe Burger, but $1.50 to add to the beef pepper or the deluxe combo. We also ordered water when ordering food.There are cooking instructions for the different dishes on the piece of paper (in English and Japanese). Read these! You don't have to follow them, but at least you know. Also, use the paper to prevent messy splashes and accidental branding of your forearms. The paper is there to guide and protect.The sliced angus wasn't very tender, but the Kobe Burger was amazing. I would go back for that. One of the senior staff mentioned it's 50% Waygu and 50% Kobe, and basically 99% beef. I find it hard to believe they use such expensive beef for the approx $10 dish, but it tastes good nonetheless. The dish also comes with 2 green beans, 2 carrot slices, bean sprouts anda  bowl of rice. The beef pepper rice with egg is classic and comes with corn and rice in the plate. I only wish it came with egg for $1.I will wait for the hype to die down and then return for the Kobe burger or try some of the other meats.TLDR;\\nWhen busy, skip line and add name to hostess's list\\nOrder your water/drink when you order food\\nRead instructions and don't burn yourself\\nEnjoy!"},{"name":"Mellow Mushroom - Sanford","address":"1831 Rinehart Rd","city":"Sanford","stars":"4","text":"We all have our fave pizza joint, and Mellow Mushroom has always been one of my favorites!

We read all the raves about the chicken wings and were excited to try it. Overall, the chicken itself is very flavorful and cooked well, but it has an overpowering taste of fish sauce. Now, I am vietnamese and eat my fair share of fish sauce and have no problem with it, but it was just too overpowering in the chicken. It definitely needs a bowl of rice or maybe some other dishes to eat it with, but to eat it by itself is not enough. The chicken itself was tender and moist inside. The wings are pretty big and more than enough to go around if you have a small party. The plate itself comes garnished with some pickled vegetables that I thought could be pickled more. It wasn't enough for my taste but they helped cover the overpowering flavor of the fish sauce. I was recommended to their their drinking vinegar by someone we had met and I got that flavored with strawberry thai basil. While the thought of drinking vinegar does not sound pleasant, I was quite surprised on how good the drink was! It was light and refreshing with a nice touch of sweetness to it.

We got there around 12:15pm and the parking lot was nearly full (good sign.) There was about a 10 minute wait and we shared a table with another couple.\\nThree out of the four of us ordered the chicken fried steak. None of us had any leftover. The chicken fried steak would've been good on its own, but was even better with the country gravy. Just the right amount of breading and pretty easy to cut. My friend added hot sauce to hers. I considered following her lead, but decided it didn't need it.\\nI tried to order salad as a side (you know, to counteract the not-so-healthy entree). Our server steered me away from the salad so I ordered cabbage and fried okra as sides. I appreciated the advice. If only all servers would be so honest. My cabbage was well cooked and seasoned. The top layer of fried okra in my bowl was perfect- lightly friend. The bottom layer, was still good, but darker breading and a little soggier. It was evident I had 2 different batches. \\nThe fourth order was the fried catfish. This is the other entree I wanted to try and lucky for me, I did try a bite. YUM! Salty, crispy, fresh catfish deliciousness. I will be back to order this.\\nService was good. Once we were seated, our drink orders came quickly. The food was also out in a reasonable time.

Do not let my photographs fool you. There were always people coming in and out of Deacon's Corner with smiles on their faces and a nice thing to say. (I just like to try and respect people's privacy when I can.) In fact the serving staff were so super friendly and cheerful, you can not help but be in a good mood when you visit.One of the guests told us that before their recent renovations the place truly looked like it had been plucked out of the 60s, but with all the wear and tear, so the changes were great improvements. I loved it. A perfect blend of retro and modern.We both ordered the Carolina Pulled Pork and Pancakes but got the mini (yes, that is the small portion) which Chef J. C. (Juan Carlo) used his creative and artistic foodie talents to make extra special for us! Oh my goodness I could not stop laughing when this adorable plate came to our table!And wow, WOW, it was so good! The eggs were butter-basted, the pulled pork sweet but not too sweet, absolutely delicious, and I think those were the fluffiest pancakes I have ever had. I have not stopped thinking about this delicious brunch since I indulged...Deacon's Corner may not have been around since the 50s (they opened in 2009) but it has to be one of the coolest diners I have ever visited. Its location bridges East Van and Gastown so its setting is a little rough around the edges but the customers and staff make it feel like home.It was the perfect brunch.

When we finally got up to the window the guy who was taking orders obviously was frustrated and having a bad day. Told us our total and pretty much snatched my friends debit card. My ice cream cone was sitting on the counter where the register was just dripping. Most places, even McDonalds make the ice cream cone as soon as the customer pulls up to the window for this exact reason lol. To prevent the melting ice cream cones. It's not rocket science....

We got seated outside, with a couple wrinkled, kind of dirty menus.   We got brought water in VERY small glasses by a server in torn jeans.  The menu has changed since we last checked it out online-and I don't feel it was for the better.

Essentially fries with Mexican cheese, salsa rojo, sour cream -and radish.   Apparently it wasn't available because they couldn't get the peppers to make the salsa-so he had the pineapple pizza-sans jalape√±o.  The pizza was $14.50 and about dinner plate sized.   The center looked a bit thin and the crust was dryer and thick.   My husband said it was ok-nothing remarkable.I had the bratwurst served with stone ground mustard, red pickled cabbage, zucchini pickles on a hogue roll with cheese.  I ordered the add on tater tots.   The tater tots-greasy and had kind of \\"old\\" tasting.  The bread on the sandwich was so dry.  The mustard was only through the center and it tasted stale, reheated and unappealing.  There wasn't that much cabbage-I would have liked to have had at least twice as much.  That was true of all the condiments-there just wasn't enough.  The bratwurst had good flavor though.While we were waiting what seemed a really long time for our food (especially because the restaurant wasn't busy), we people watched.

I was also surprised at how easily the juice went down as well - it tasted like a citrusy apple cider. \\nOverall I was impressed by how well these dishes were made with such simple ingredients."},{"name":"New Brothers Restaurant & Deli","address":"31 Maple St","city":"Danvers","stars":"4","text":"This was my first visit to New Brothers Restaurant and Deli. This was at the suggestion from our cousin who is familiar with the area. We were coming from Stoneham, and this restaurant is in Danvers, Massachusetts. Their parking is situated in the back part of the restaurant and that's where we entered from. The restaurant inside is actually pretty nice even though you order your food in a cafeteria style way. The difference is that there food is quite good. When I ordered I asked for the Hot Pastrami and the man behind the counter asked me if I wanted mine in a \\"Bulkie\\" and I said yes. I at least I knew what he meant this time, being from out of town. Overall it's the experience of being in a different town and just seeing what people they like. Danvers is a nice little town but, like many town around they are all nice.

However, I was taken aback by a recent experience because of the following:I do not drink alcohol - I have a bit of an intolerance to it, and to be frank, it doesn't make me feel good when I consume it (even a small amount).  I can tolerate drinking it a bit, but there's a reason I choose not to.I ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail/mocktail.  When it arrived, I was quite sure that it had alcohol in it, but I wasn't certain (the drink had bitters in it, and I wasn't sure if that was what I was tasting).  I continued attempts at sipping it, despite the fact that I hated it.  Soon, my face became flushed, and I started to have my typical bodily reaction to alcohol, so I called my server over to ask whether my drink was incorrectly made.After speaking with the bartender, she confirmed that the ticket details for my drink had been lost, and the bartender assumed I wanted the drink with alcohol.  This could have been a really terrible and costly assumption - had I been a recovering alcoholic, or someone struggling with alcohol addiction, this could have been a setback or relapse caused by the bartender.  Fortunately it wasn't; however, it did lead to some uncomfortable alcohol related reactions in my body for the rest of dinner.All of this was an honest mistake, and my server did genuinely feel bad about it; hopefully the restaurant will learn from this.However, my surprise, and the reason for this review, was that my replacement drink (the same mocktail without the alcohol) was not \\"on the house\\", given the error that was made.  I can appreciate that I did order the new drink, and though I shouldn't expect something to be complimentary, I would think it would be a good business practice given the mistake made, and the fact that the server knew I was having a bit of a reaction to the alcohol.It was their choice whether to make it complimentary or not, and I respect their decision; it is their business and their business practice.  However, the consequence of their decision is this review and the fact that I have no plans to return anytime soon.  The whole event has left a sour taste in my mouth."},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"I started missing Life Alive when I moved from Boston and wished for a dose of healthy hippie goodness in my backyard. Although I have some issues with the place, I still find it reliably decent for a tasty veggie meal that's good for my body, even if it's not the most filling.I've been to LA several times, but most recently checked it out earlier this month while back in Boston. Its painted wood interior and chalkboards still have a decidedly hippie vibe, with seating both in the well-light street-level space and the more cavernous downstairs.I typically have gotten the grain bowls here. This time around, since I'm back on a grain-free diet, I got the Green Goddess with sprouted legumes, without rice, and with an alternative dressing to the shoyu sauce (am also soy free these days, alas). Thankfully, they are very attentive to dietary restrictions and were totally cool with the tweaks.Three other friends got the same dish but in its original form, and when our food came, mine was clearly a more diminished version of their full bowls -- just the veggies and a scattering of legumes, nothing added to make up for the lack of rice. It was still tasty after I added a few dashes of Bragg's liquid aminos and nutritional yeast (a plus to LA for many alternative condiments), but all the body of the dish had been removed and I was still hungry. Next time I might go for a true salad in hopes of avoiding this flattened experience. The others enjoyed their meals, although they agreed that it's not quite as flavorful or WOW as others think it is.If you come during typical meal times, expect it to be PACKED. Like, waiting in line to order, waiting for your food, waiting to find a seat... The staff doesn't monitor seating for those who eat in, so you may have to be that annoying hover-er, waiting for people to finish. We had a group of 5 and waited 10-15 mins to find a table -- not a long wait normally for a restaurant, but long when it's raining and there isn't really any good place to wait.I still would come back to Life Alive, if only because it reliably has food that works with my food allergies.

After reviewing Yelp and the menu I ordered: carpaccio and the carbonara. Carpaccio meat was excellent in quality and quantity. It did lack in salt. Too many greens were aboard the plating and too few capers. I'd suggest a quick grinder of sea salt and it would have been perfect. Another option is balsamic vinegar. A house salad came with the main. Truly must give props to the staff. It was dressed to perfection. There was no residual pool of dressing nor was any leaf lacking. This raised my hopes for the rest of the meal.The main: carbonara. I like to test restaurants that are new to me by checking something that should be done right 100% of the time.

I wasn't over it underdressed for this kind of frat fest so I was a bit put off by it. Not a minute inside a bachelorette with about six ladies in black surrounding her as she violently, drunkenly thrashed about before puking in the middle of the floor through both her hands and on a dear concerned party-goer. I turned around so fast and bolted for the opposite side of the room to wait for my friends to walk by or show up. I ordered a gin and tonic and was served a well-vodka soda. Look, I know this isn't a classy joint regardless of decor, $5 mandatory parking, and a line longer than opening day of Superman at SixFlags--but I'm a bartender. I ENJOY alcohol. I know you have at least 2 different types of gin besides the cheapest. I will pay for what kind of hangover I want the next day. I tried to get another with tonic but a tall group of burly polo wearing guys who were all very nice looking approached the bar and her attention was diverted. I don't hold it against her, but instead drank the plastic cup of flat vodka-water. Short trip to the bathroom which was tragic, a couple was in a huge fight outside the door and she refused to open the door to the bathroom. Man I wished I hadn't drank anything at all. After about 10 minutes I gave up and met up with my friend walking inside. Unfortunately she stepped in the barrel of bachelorette up chuck and was fuming before I could tell her to watch out. Needless to say the experience was continually worse from the jump. To top it off, a different bartender give me a solid F-you eye roll because I asked to close my tab.

I normally would be hesitant to write a review on a Chinese restaurants as their services are expected to be at the low end. This is my first time writing a review on a Chinese restaurant simply my friends and I we were extremely pleased with our service with one of the staff, Pisal. To be frank, my first experience with the Red 8 was not pleasant. Both my guests and I we felt unwelcomed as we patiently waited to be served. After being seated for good. 10 mins, and saw the waiters walked by (on a weekday, not busy), we took the initiate to flag down a staff to serve us. By then, we were also ready to order. The rest of the evening, again, flagged down the waitress with our needs. Though we were pleased to see our food came out in a timely manner but we were not impressed when our soup never came out. When we finished our meal (after inquiring about it a few times), the soup still got delayed. By then, half of the people at our table of 12, lost patience and left.  After my first experience, I thought I would give it a break and come back when things improved. Our second experience was when our friends decided to stay for dinner.  After our first experience, we felt skeptical about going back. Since the table was ready for us, the \\"no wait\\" was a bonus. So we decided to give Red 8 another chance. Luckily, we did! We were all very pleased with our server, Pisal. He took notice of our table within mins and came promptly to our service. He was patient with the order taking and answered all our questions. His knowledge of the menu and proactive approached, made us all welcomed and valued as a customer. We had a pleasant dinning experience under his care and left him a nice tip for his hospitality and outstanding service. We personally thank him and everyone left highly satisfied and happy.  Today, a friend and I, we decided to stop in for a quick late night meal. Though the after the hour \\"Express Menu\\" is curtailed but it covered a good selection of the typical Chinese late night snacking which include the stirred fried noodles, soup noodles, congee, dimsum ... Etc. Though we were seated quickly, again, no service to our table. There were a few staffs on the floor and with eye contact no one came to our assistance or acknowledge our presence.  Luckily, Pisal walked by. He quickly took notice of our table and prompt to take over.  He wasted no time getting our beverages and orders in. After seeing him on site, we were relieved and excited to know we will be taken care of. I personally shared with him, I only want him to serve us in going forward. He is courteous, respectful, attentive and full of energy. His positive and friendly attitude made us feel at home. Again, my friends and I were fortunate to have Pisal wait on us. I will talk briefly on the food. Most of the people that I know including myself that had dinned at the Red 8, we all agreed the food is good and authentic. Though pricing is on the high end, factoring in the venue, its name, the freshness, high quality seafood and ingredients used ... etc, it is expected to be pricey and upscale. I am pleased with the consistency of the food from the kitchen. The Imperial Peking Duck served with the Steamed Buns/Cr√™pes is many people's favorite or must have. One item that's a little off and not what most people expected is the Stewed Beef & Tomato Soup. Most people and myself ordered this find it surprising and distasteful to see this typical soup came out to be more of a tomato paste, similar to the marinara sauce. It's a well known soup and is normally slowly cooked in low heat utilizing the five spices and fresh tomatoes that are cutted in slices. The five spices is not present in the soup and the tomatoes, pureed to look more like a paste. Not knowing this item would be off, my guests and I we both ordered this just to give it a try. We both were shock when the soup came out looking pureed. We did give it a try. After the first bite, we could not bare to continue. We voiced our opion to the manager.

When you walk in you are greeted by a pair of friendly good luck cat sculptures, also known as Maneki-neko, or beckoning cat. Our server told us the old folk tale of an operator of an impoverished shop that took in a starving, stray cat despite barely having enough to feed himself. In gratitude, the cat took up a station outside the establishment and beckons in new visitors, bringing prosperity as a reward to the charitable proprietor.  Other have noted that the gesture a cat makes when it raises its paw over the ears is very similar to when it washes its face. When a cat washes it's face, it is believed that patrons will soon come.  We ordered the Massaman Curry steak, Red Curry steak, green curry chicken, and steak pad Thai. There was no wait to get seated on a Saturday night and we got our food under 10 minutes after we ordered. The Thai HOT was pretty legit hot. At first taste, Thai HOT sauce doesn't seem very hot but the vegetables and chicken really absorbed the spiciness more than the sauce by itself. It wouldn't be instantly hot when you took a bit but after 50 seconds it hits! Normally the Thai spice rack they bring out has 4 spices but this one was 2 spices short of the regular spices. Storm Sushi did have crushed pepper and red pepper paste which is my fave but they did have a bowl ot Pickled jalape√±os I've never seen at a Thai place before. Storm Thai sushi restaurant also has a huge selection of sushi. Storm Thai Sushis menu has 4 pages of sushi, 1 page of Japanese, and 2 pages of Thai food. Storm Sushi offers 100 piece sushi platter catering for parties or business functions which range from $45 to $120. I was a little disappointed the restaurant didn't offer any booth seating. The decor is pretty classic with dark wood chairs, sushi bar, sushi bar, and Asian decorations. There was no music playing at the restaurant. The restaurant had the Orlando Magic basketball game on all 4 TV's and had the game commentary playing from the tvs. Either the owner is really into the Orlando Magic or the place doubles as a sports bar. Storm Thai Sushi is probably better for sushi than Thai if you are expecting all the traditional side spices but I was in a Thai kinda mood! The pricing at Storm Sushi is a bit higher than average but the portion sizes were very generous! Next time, I'd probably split a dish here. I was only able to eat half my meal but that's good for lunch tomorrow! :)"},{"name":"Brassica","address":"2212 E Main St","city":"Bexley","stars":"4.5","text":"Always such great, great food.

It was close to noon on a Thursday.It wasn't too busy and everyone was friendly. I had to hit the restroom before sitting down. It deserves 3 stars on it's own. Extremely clean and smelled incredibly fresh.The waitress was great. For drinks I had an unsweet iced tea and water. My waitress ensured they were never empty and I had the right sweetener. I was loving it. Could this be the new place to eat?My eyes were bigger than my stomach and I planned on taking some home. I ordered JAY'S WAY omelette, home fries, cinnamon raisin toast - A turkey club with coleslaw on toasted white.  The food arrived pretty quick. It looked good enough and I got some of their hot sauce.Everything seemed dry and lack luster.  It was as if I only kept eating it in hopes the next bite would be better. Perhaps I should have let the waitress know and get something else? But I ordered 2 meals. If the club was blah and the breakfast was blah... what else on the menu would be good? I started drowning it in hot sauce to make the blah go away.The iced tea was really good though. So I started guzzling down that, I drank enough to get full. Yeah! So I left with 1/2 an omelette, some home fries, cinnamon raisin toast, half a turkey club, which isn't a triple-decker, and the coleslaw. I tried eating it later but it was pretty bad. I offered it to my sister, she passed. I figured I'd try the coleslaw. Gross. I ended up eating the rest of the home fries then even later tried forcing down the other half of the turkey club.I really wanted to like this place. If the service and bathroom had been average this would be a 1 star review. The waitress should get a raise. Of course I can not remember her name. My bad.

ALL I COULD HEAR WAS A SCREAMING BABY IN THE THEATER FOR THE ENTIRE MOVIE! OVERPRICED (we left paying $300 for a really lousy time), MANAGEMENT THAT WAS UNWILLING TO HELP IN ANY WAY, ZERO COMPENSATION FOR WAITING OVER AN HOUR FOR COLD FOOD! Literally the ONLY positive thing was that the theater was very clean. But I don't think it will be for long. This theater looked promising-- it was clean & had a cool vibe. But me & my family had a terrible & terribly overpriced experience. The food service was SO SLOW and when the food came it was cold. It did not taste very good either. I did like the \\"MUDSLIDE\\" drink I got. And their house salad was good. But it sat in front of me for 30 minutes while I waited for the server to bring me a fork! They brought my food with no utensils. I went with my family, and half of us got our food and the other half got it an hour later, and we DID what they recommended-- which is to show up 30 minutes before to order. And even then, it took over an hour for us to get COLD FOOD. Also, we were sitting in the middle of the theater towards the back, and we could NOT HEAR the movie over our own chewing! It was the worst sound I've ever experienced in a theater. And we were there for the Lion King, which has a great score! I wanted to feel that music! I asked if there was any way to turn up the volume because I was literally missing dialogue even when I wasn't chewing-- they said no! Overall, we spent $300 (YES! $300 for tickets and food all together) and we left VERY DISAPPOINTED that we had spent that much money on terrible service and terrible food. The one star I gave was for cleanliness.

She was great- attentive and fast. We did have to wait 15 minutes for someone to come to our table but based on our service after, I feel like that may have been due to miscommunication of who was taking the table. We get to our table and have no idea how this restaurant works. Are there even servers? Or do you order just from the iPad type thing. I go to the host stand and the woman immediately solves the whole \\"no waitress\\" issue. I forgot, she also was very helpful and attentive. So one star for the waitress and hostess. 0 stars for the food. We ordered the pretzel bites and they were dry and too hard. My boyfriend described the cheese sauce as microwaved Tostitos queso dip. Very artificial tasting. The burger was ok but the food at patriots place just tastes a lot better. The thing is, being a waitress myself, I am definitely not hard to please. I can definitely sympathize! I can only imagine what happens in this place when more \\"particular\\" customers come in. Maybe in a few months if the reviews improve I'll revisit, but if I'm fixing for Red Robin, I'm going straight to Foxboro.

I would definitely recommend the green tea mille crepe cake if you like green tea, the mango mochi if you enjoy other types of mochi, and the mango juice with glutinous rice balls and ice cream if you enjoy the taste of mangos.

The homemade fusilli was well-worth it-- not too doughy, and so unmistakably fresh and handmade. The sauce-- tangy, tomatoey, and best of all, not sweet. The chicken was crisp on the outside, tender on the inside. My companion's ziti and broccoli with aglio olio was also quite good. The arancini, which were heavily highlighted by many of you in your reviews, were very tasty. The portions were very large, and both of us were able to make two meals from our orders. At 8-10 bucks a pop, you can't really go wrong. Takeout is definitely the way to go here. It was kind of like discovering an awesome B-side track on an old record that you've had for years.

I always make reservations on open table but it isn't usually busy around 5-6 time period. Each dinner menu is made and printed right before dinner, so theres the usual items + a few additional items that are added (seasonally). The fried clams and fried calamari are delicious here. The lobster roe noodles are a must try!!! It is the best meal I have had here. I've also tried the lobster bisque which was good but nothing that stood out to me. The crispy oyster slider was also good but I prefer raw oysters... speaking of, the raw oyster menu is extensive. My favorite oysters are the island creek, dodge cove, and the east dennis. Once of the restaurants that is a must try in Boston when it comes to fancy, cute places. Definitely on the pricier side.

But I'd recommend the Lover, which has beets and carrots and mushrooms. The Green Goddess is a classic but note that it's super garlicy. The wait can get super long, so a tip is to call ahead of time to place an order for pickup. However, I've had some bad experiences when the portion sizes are significantly smaller in the to-go boxes versus the regular sit-down bowls.

The lobster fritters are a favorite of ours.We had the porterhouse for two.  It cut like butter and melted in our mouths.  We couldn't have been happier with it (plus we got a bone for the dog).  We had the pea risotto for our side.  It was okay.  I expect bigger peas and a creamier texture.  It was pretty clumpy and lumpy.I was surprised that after having great service through dinner, everyone seemed to disappear as we finished eating.  It was clear there were enough (possibly more than enough) waitstaff but maybe not enough bus people.  It appeared that the floor manager saw that we were finished but he did not bus our table and went to talk to the hostesses instead.  We decided to forego after dinner drinks and just get our check when we could.  At $150 (we had a bottle of wine) per person (including tip) the front of the house service, especially at the end of dinner, can outshine the back of the house excellence.

You can pay an additional $5 for BYOB / BYOF. $10 / person is fcking steep. Snakes & Latte was only $5, always. At $10 / person with a group of 4, we might as well buy our own games.I don't love the ambiance at Knight Moves either. Snakes & Lattes is bright, friendly, approachable, with a fun family feel to it. Knight Moves is darker with a more library feel, and honestly just feels like a place people would gather to intensely play Dungeons & Dragons or Magic The Gathering. I'm not hating on these games by any means... but there's a difference between the casual feel at Snakes & Lattes with a younger demographic that want to play some games of Catan, Jenga, etc. and the hole-up-in-a-dark-cafe older demographic of Knight Moves that plays games with a cult-like following. The space at Knight Moves is also really cramped, once again adding to that dark library feeling. Snakes & Lattes was a nice, open space.It was also really effing hot in Knight Moves. Like I was getting sleepy because it was so warm. I ordered a root beer float to try and wake me up but the root beer was actually room temperature and the ice cream was not cold enough to offset this.The game selection is decent, but the games are in pretty poor condition. Scrabble was missing the letter J. The cards in 7 Wonders, which is not a well known game and didn't seem like it was played that much based on the number of score sheets used before us, were pretty horribly beat up and stuck together like crazy. Everything seemed okay with Fire & Ice Stratego though I guess...Knight Moves is no Snakes & Lattes, unfortunately.

I can't imagine coming from out of town and trying to find some random building with no name. I am not 100% sure if the 4th street location has a name on the building either. But either way, it's just standard business etiquette to have some sort of identifier for your customers to find you! Luckily, I know the Fox in the Snow vibe and could tell when I reached the building that \\"This has to be it!\\"Similar to the 4th street location, I will say that there is limited seating. Luckily my friends got there 10 minutes before me so they were able to grab us a table. But just know that you may not end up with a table if you go at a particularly busy time. It was packed the entire time we were there (10a-12p on Sunday). There is more seating at this location though, but still not enough to hold all of their weekend brunch patrons.I am always so pleased with the selection of sweet treats and pastries offered by FITS. They are carefully crafted artisan treats that can please all types. This is an excellent place to grab a sweet bite to eat with friends, coffee, study session, you name it! I don't drink coffee so I always get the hot chocolate. My favorite part is the delicious jumbo square marshmallow that they add. It's sooooo good after it's been in the hot cocoa for a while. I love taking that last sip and then biting right into the mallow. YUM!For food this time, I decided to stray away from my normal cinnamon bun (was not feeling the sugar overload) and opted for the biscuit with housemade blackberry jam as well as an apple pastry (I forget the actual name). Both were DELICIOUS! I am so glad I strayed away from my normal go-to. The biscuit was so fresh and fluffy on the inside and crisp and flaky on the outside. The apple pastry was delicious. I loved the fresh cut apples inside and the outer part was very flaky! (at one point I took a bite and pastry flakes went flying everywhere!) I would highly recommend both and can't wait to try some more of these goodies on my next visit!This is a great place to take out-of-towners as well since it seems to be a crowd pleaser for all types!

It was a Spanish wine (Pazo Senorans - Albarino 2005 (Rias Baixas)) with a crisp and refreshing flavor.The only disappointing part of the dinner was the dessert.

Luckily, we were able to get seated quickly because there were only 2 of us but the restaurant is quite small with limited seating and only 1 waiter, so depending on the time and size of your party, you could be waiting 30min-1hr. My friend and I ordered and shared the Aglio Olio black squid ink pasta and Fried Calamari which are both very popular on their menu. The portion sizes are quite big so we got the Appetizer portion but they also have Entree sizes.Overall, I recommend this placeI'm actually not a big fan of seafood and especially don't like squid, but the pasta and calamari were both really good!

If you like brunch buffets and southern foods for a cheap, reasonable price, this is the spot for you! Though the wait can get to over an hour on weekends, you can always put your name down and take a stroll through the neighboring city life to pass the time. My friends and I went to the state capitol and then walked back which only took about 10 minutes. Now onto the restaurant. This place is huge! Besides the seating area in the main restaurant, there is also outside seating as well as an annex that has AC. And you can bet that every seat was taken! It makes sense because the food is great, there is a huge variety of choices and the price for lunch buffet is only around $20. Though it says they close at 2pm, we actually didn't get seated till around 2:30pm and ate until 3:30pm. The food did run out towards the end but we didn't feel rushed or anything. I tried so many different casseroles from sweet potato with marshmallow to green eggs with pesto. Everything was delicious. I loved the yogurt they had which was the poppyseed yogurt and you could make your own parfait with fresh fruits and granola. There was also this amazing pesto pasta salad that was so refreshing and tasty. They also had a mini bagel bar that had 5 or 6 different spreads like salmon, jam etc. And their devil eggs omg to die for. I appreciated that everything was delicately made and minature so you don't over eat. Even the pancakes were tiny but delicious! Sometimes buffets mass produce their food so the taste is sacrificed, but not this place! I went for two rounds and then was too stuffed to get dessert, what a pity. The waiter serving us was also very nice. We asked for ketchup and he brought us 5 little jars of it! He also kept coming back to check on us and we even had a whole conversation about Denver vs Austin living. Definitely enjoyed my hour lunch here at the moonshine.

Of my visits to various Chinese restaurants in our area, I believe that Ming's Bistro still stands firmly as the best for dim sum, if you don't mind the weekend crowds.If you are not in the downtown area, there is one other place in Orlando where I can trust their dim sum to be deemed delightful: Golden Lotus.Situated in awkward Wal-Mart Plaza on the corner of John Young Blvd and Sand Lake Rd, you might visit it if you are headed to or coming from the Florida Mall just a few street lights away. The place is often sparse on the weekdays but can get quite busy on the weekend. They serve dim sum every day till 4 pm.Inside, at first glance it may seem to be another stereotypical \\"Chinese\\" restaurant, but take a look closer and you will find delicious wonders within.\\nOverall, I would recommend Golden Lotus for some good, fairly priced authentic Chinese food and would rate it under Ming Bistro for dim sum .

They used to be cleaned and deveined and much better quality .  Now they are peel and eat - this is a big downgrade imo.Given they do not open for dinner until 6 or 6:30 and they close at 9 on many nights, there is a very limited window to go.   In addition, when I get there at 8 the hostess always informs me they will stop putting out food at 8:30 but they really stop at like 8:15 and start cleaning so if you are going to go, it only makes sense to go between 6:15 and 7:15Again, I am ok with the slight increase in prices but the downgrade in quality and the cleaning up early makes the last few visits a disappointment and less likely to return"},{"name":"Rubino's Pizza","address":"2643 E Main St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"I like two pizza restaurants better than any in Columbus - Masseys and RUBINO's.

Modern yet rustic upon walking in the door with a very friendly and attentive waitstaff.  The menu offered traditional diner legends, but also included a few interesting twists.   It is immediately evident that they make their own corn beef hash, chimichurri sauce, and hot sauces (delicious!), as well as providing several fresh squeezed juices available daily depending on the best ingredients they can locate to be squeezed.  Little is known about their squeezing process.  Lori satiated herself with the Red Eye wrap substituting tomatoes for bacon (statistics documenting the rarity of this request were unavailable as of press time) and a grilled bagel with cream cheese.  The red eye had the spicy chimichurri sauce which had great flavor but limited spiciness.  However, the leather tongues of the authors (at least when compared to most New England residents) may influence individual experiences in this area.  However, given this knowledge, the previously mentioned homemade hot sauce was a highlight as it had great flavor and a decent kick, like that of a pissed off pony that leaves your ribcage fully intact but sore in the morning.  Greg had the Chimichurri omelet, containing a \\"hefty hefty\\" portion of turkey, with side of corn beef hash (In Greg's estimation part of the holy trinity of diner yardsticks, the others being hollandaise sauce and gravy, not to be confused with the First Triumvirate of ancient Rome.

There was a small line that went out the door, but one of the employees handing out menus told us that if we weren't dining in, then we could move to a shorter line for take-out. I ordered the roasted vegetable wrap (which cost a surprising $14 dollars and only came with a pickle) and waited only about 5 minutes for it to be made. The sandwich was a hefty serving and was slightly toasted on the outside, with beautiful grill marks on the outside. The roasted eggplant and cheese really made the sandwich. So many vegetables and good flavor. It was a decent sandwich that I enjoyed, but it was slightly overpriced in my opinion."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Love the oysters here.

The pesto pizza was definitely the winner for me.  The Margherita was merely a cheese pizza (this is clearly indicated on the menu) with a chunky tomato sauce and dried basil sprinkled on top.  The cheese isn't too heavy, which pleases me.  As much as I love chunks of tomato on pizza, I wasn't a fan of it in this case.  The Garden Pesto was great- lots of pesto and chunks of artichoke with light cheese.  I would gladly order an entire pizza like this again or even just plain pesto with light cheese.  I loved that I could place my order quickly and easily through their website.  The menu, pricing and process were clear and easy to understand.  I think it's awesome that they have the option to order split pizzas with different pricing for the different sides rather than most pizza places that won't let you split a pizza when there are different base sauces and charge the full price for whichever half costs the most.  Very progressive! The staff greeted me as soon as I walked through the door and were nice and professional. \\nI think the prices were reasonable.  My 14\\" half/half was around $15.   If I'd split the pizza with someone, it would have been about $8/per person.

I was pretty happy with my linguine, there was a good amount of variety of seafood in the dish, a whole bunch of tomatoes and a well-balanced sauce. My boyfriend had the one piece fish and chips and he wasn't the biggest fan of their breading, but the fish itself wasn't bad. The fries were nothing special. I rated three stars because price-wise, I don't think it was well worth it. The linguine was $20+ and the one piece of fish was $18. Service wasn't the greatest, we felt that our waitress was giving off an annoyed vibe.. but all in all, we got our check and went on with our day.

It was superb.  Cooked perfectly with a wonderful flavor and seasoning and a nice char on the outside.  We shared a side of Brussels sprouts and they were delicious- and more than the two of us could eat.  We purposely saved room for dessert.  My friend opted for creme br√ªl√©e and I splurged on the big calorie dessert - carrot cake!   It was fabulous.  The cream cheese frosting, although there was quite a bit of it, was light and had a hint of orange to it.  The leftover cake made a fabulous breakfast the next day!

Classic cuban dishes Arroz Con Pollo A La Cubana and Ropa Vieja are the way to go. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. The beef in the Ropa Vieja was tender and savory. Both portions were rather large and enough to share or bring home for leftovers. You will definitely get your money's worth here. The lunch menu is cheaper yet offers the same dinner portions.

EVERYTHING looks good. I went in there knowing I had to try the Mango Sticky Rice since I've always wanted to try it, and we also bought the Strawberry Mango Juice Sago & Lychee Jelly w/ Mango Ice Cream (try saying that three times fast) and the Green Tea Mille Crepe. The mille crepe was my least favorite of the three, just because I'm not a big fan of matcha/green tea, but the cream in between each layer of crepe was pretty good. It was the perfect amount of sweetness, and the crepes themselves were super soft -- definitely worth a try. The strawberry mango juice sago was extremely refreshing. I'd definitely get it on a hot day. You have fresh strawberries and mangos, lychee jelly, and the super refreshing mango ice cream. My favorite of the three was the mango sticky rice. Let's just say there's a reason it isn't pictured below. No, it's not bad, I just.. was too excited to eat it so I didn't take a picture, and after a couple of minutes, there was nothing left to take a picture of.

For one, the ambience is great. Very high ceilings provide the impression that the restaurant has plenty of room, which it does :). The bar area  looks very Star Trekkish, which I love. And I've never been disappointed with either the service or the food. For appetizers, I would recommend their calamari as well as their chacuterie board. The calamari is a bit fried for my taste, but the jalapeno peppers give it a nice kick. They also have pretty decent salads. One of my favorites here is the chopped baby spinach salad, which comes with bacon --- yum! If you're in the mood, the beet salad is also really good. Their regular filet is usually excellent. Generally cooked perfectly and in the rare occasion when it wasn't, they immediately took it back. Personally, I'm partial to meats on the bone, and so I would recommend their bone-in strip or their bone-in filet, if they are available. Delicious! I don't generally come to a steakhouse and go for the fish, but my wife has tried the Chilean sea bass and she liked it very much. This is an excellent steakhouse. If you were to put a gun to my head, I'd probably rate it  below the downtown Hyde Park, which is my favorite steakhouse in Columbus, but it is definitely in the top 5 places for steaks in Columbus, which is saying something, because we do steaks pretty damn well!"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The hype... Oh the hype. I'm not someone with a picky taste in food, especially Thai food, but damn this was some mediocre Thai food. Maybe I'm spoiled from eating in Socal (the land of hyped food) , but I've never been so disappointed. First is the wait. We got there there around 5:30. There's basically a line to get a number so you can wait in line. No big deal though. We went around and got a little buzzed while we waited to be texted that our table was ready. Two hours later, we get the text. Guess what... we had to wait even more to get seated........ Oh wells what you can do? We had the Fish Sauce wings at Soda Whiskey Lounge while we waited and it was like someone decided \\"oh fish sauce is such an exotic flavor, let's soak this in fish sauce\\" . It was too salty and fishy and I'm Vietnamese and eat fish sauce everyday! Anyway, back to Pok Pok. I ended up getting the curry noodle soup which was highly recommended. It was pretty bland for my taste. Maybe I'm used more sweet and flavored curry, but everytime I took a sip of the curry, I felt blue-balled of what it could've tasted like. There was this coconut flavor that I wish was more distinguished. The beef wasn't very tender. Honestly the mediocre food wasn't even the worst part. Our waiter may or may not have been high, but he definitely messed up our order multiple times. If he was, at least that would have been an excuse (although not a good one) on why he messed up our orders and check multiple times.

The fact that there is no delivery fee and no tipping is icing on the cake. The downside is that it takes longer to get your food but if that means drivers gets paid fair wages and don't have to use their own cars then I'm ok with this.We order Tso a few times per month and have eaten most of the menu. Ironically, I think the General Tso's chicken and sesame chicken are the weakest menu items. I'm not sure if it's because the delivery takes a long time or because the plastic containers trap in steam but the chicken is never very crispy but rather is soggy. For me, the perfect General Tso's chicken should have a little bit of crisp left which is admittedly difficult since it gets covered in sauce and driven around town.But don't let that stop you from ordering here. The crab rangoons are the absolute best I've ever had and the drunken beef noodles are crazy good. I think they used to come \\"very hot\\" by default or maybe they toned the spiciness down because people couldn't handle the default level. Either way, if you like spicy food, this is the dish to crank up the heat on. Seriously, these noodles are the star of the menu.The combo fried rice is a great old standby (although I personally long for the fried rice of my youth cooked by a restaurant run by a family that moved from NYC, it had great bits of red char siu pork and no one in Austin seems to make it this way) and the eggplant chicken was a delight even though I dislike eggplant.

I asked if everything on their meza appetizer plate was vegan and I was told that yes, everything was. I said \\"oh great so your babaganoush and hummus don't have any dairy?\\" (I wanted to be sure) The guy said he didn't actually know. So he had told me it was vegan without even caring whether or not that was true so I asked him if he could please find out. He went to go ask while I kept looking at the menu and then he came back and said that yes, the hummus and babaganoush have milk and/or yogurt in them. At this point I'm confused because I'm looking at something on the menu called the VEGAN sandwich..and it's a hummus/lettuce/tomato sandwich. So I asked him \\"So this so-called vegan sandwich on your menu isn't actually vegan?\\" And he says \\"No, but we can take the hummus off.\\" At this point I said no thank you and walked out the door because for one I didn't want a tomato on a piece of bread but also because if you don't know what's in your food then I don't trust it."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"We went there for a late dinner.

Normally I avoid BP like the plague as their food is way overpriced, but $5 personal pizzas make things all better.  I've also been here for some drinks and appies at the bar.Parking is available in the really large Columbia Square lot.The venue is split into a smaller restaurant section, and a large bar section.  Food can be had in both areas, but the bar area is obviously not as kid friendly.Our server was friendly, and helped quite a bit with the ordering process.Because of the awesome price, my friend and I went nuts.Rustic Italian - Italian sausage and onions.  Beautiful.Meateor - even more meat.  Ham, pepperoni, beef, sausage.  Normally I use Pizza Hut as the gold standard, but this pizza gives it some serious competition.Boston Royal - similar to a deluxe pizza but with shrimp.  Not bad at all, but not as meaty as the other ones obviously.Bacon double cheeseburger - this one was really messy to eat, as the ground beef kept breaking into a million pieces.  I felt like a kid again.BBQ chicken - tastes exactly like it sounds, but with cheese and a pizza crust.Viva Italian - this one was definitely on the spicy side, because of the banana peppers.  Goat cheese gave it a nice kick.  Not for everyone, but something different.Personally, my favourites were the Rustic Italian, and the Meteor.The pricing part still scares me about this place (who pays $30 for a large pizza!?), but next time they have another promo, I'll definitely be back."},{"name":"Little Caesars Pizza","address":"5374 Sullivant Ave","city":"Galloway","stars":"2","text":"They never have pizza \\"Hot N Ready\\".

They did not have a hostess or anyone to sit us for about 10 minutes and when a waitress did she was very cold towards us and said nothing. We didn't get drinks or chips for another 15 and waited a long time for someone to take our order.

The beans were sooooooo freaking BAD. We all ordered breakfast, huevos rancheros, breakfast tacos, and it was horrible we all took a couple bites and that was it. Even the breakfast tacos were horrible. The salsa was soooo watery and tasteless also. \\n- service was bad. They only had two waitresses working and they were packed. We saw a whole table walk out because it looked like they were there on a lunch break from work and didn't have enough time to wait 45 MINUTES FOR THEIR FOOD. Waitress had a attitude and barely said any words to us THE WHOLE TIME and didn't check on our table once in the time that we were there. Our waitress seemed like she did NOT want to be there. When we asked for things she would say yes and never being the items, which caused us to ask another waitress that was cleaning tables. This place used to be sooo good and so convenient for us to stop by and eat at before a day full of shopping and it has gone down terribly... I recommend NO ONE even stop by and waste your time.

This is a lobster feast that costs $42.50 per person.  I have to announce this price so we all understand what expectations come with what I am about to describe. The restaurant was empty when we arrived with exception of three customers.  This struck us odd since it was attached to the Comfort Inn.  My wife wanted salad and I knew this was an expensive venture since she was not eating lobster but it was not a real issue for me since I wanted an all you can eat lobster feast.  However, calling it this was completely playing into what the thieving owners planned. As soon as I stood and went to the buffet I knew I was being cheated.  There were MAYBE 5 plates that would be considered a dinner.  The first was roast-beef and rice.  The beef was chunks of fat and the rice had not been touched in so long it was hard plastic that stuck in your teeth.  The calamari was over breaded and dry with a odd tasting cocktail sauce.  There were frozen snow crab legs that were stuck to the shells (Old) and one other dish that had been simmering for days that I refused to even try.  The meat was black and a crust over the chafing dish.I attempted to eat these dishes because they refused to stock the lobster.  It took me two complaints and 30 minutes to receive my first lobster, if that's what you want to call it.  The Maine lobster did not even have claws and the tails were two bites (Without exaggeration and it was NOT a Florida Lobster, they were removed and sold to this restaurant as bodies only).  Most of the legs were even missing.  The meat was dry and tough and awful but I had to try to make the best out of the extensive money I was spending.  To my dismay 20 minutes went by and I actually had to stick my head in the kitchen because the waiters would not even bother to report my request for more lobster knowing that it would not be fulfilled.  The chef came into the dinning room and was rude and threatened to throw me out.  I was actually eating in a restaurant, paying 42.50 per plate and being threatened by the chef...if that's what you want to call him.  Finally I left after two hours, my wife was disheveled, we had a miserable experience, ate a total of three tiny lobster tails and a salad with a bill of $145.00.  I had three cocktails and she had some coffee.  I told the Chef that I was not paying the bill but he threatened the police and I did not want to ruin my vacation.The other patrons were complaining about the games they played and the fact that it was a tourist trap because they certainly did not cater to a local crowd or they would be closed down in a week.  DO NOT GO!  This is the clear and present warning.  It is a disaster and the Comfort Inn are idiots for being associated.

I also like their crispy veggie rolls and bubble tea.  But the pho.  Yum.  Also I'm white, so if this isn't authentic, I really have no idea about that.  I just think it tastes really good and it's super cheap, allowing me to feel totally OK about ordering this multiple times per week."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I was really disappointed in this place. I'm not one to criticize a place for their service especially if the food trumps it all, however our experience of this place was marred by the service we got. We arrived early around 5:30pm on a weekday. It happened to be one of the hottest days in Portland's history. We had been warned there might be a line, so we'd called ahead and tried to make a reservation but they said they weren't taking any more that night. So we showed up early, were excited there was no line and then for some reason were seated under the tin roof where the ventilation was extremely poor and the heat was beating down upon us. There were barely any people on the inside. Then we were perusing the menu and it looked exotic and exciting but we weren't sure of portion sizes or what was an appetizer or entree. The server was very condescending, explained some of the dishes to us and I specifically asked if the portions would be good for one. And she said yes and that the goal was to share all the dishes. Due to dietary restrictions my husband is not able to share most things on the menu and he confirmed the size and description of his dish too. \\nOur food arrives and my husband has a medium portion, I have the tiniest portion of boar collar and my friend had a larger pot of food. The flavors were all excellent. But these were definitely not shareable . One of us requested a hot sauce or red pepper flakes of some sort and our server just said no and walked away. I can understand that certain chefs want to keep the integrity of their dishes, but there is a much nicer way to do that. \\nIn the end we ate small, expensive portions of delicious food with condescending service in 100 degree heat."},{"name":"Casa B Tapas and Cocktail & Rum Bar","address":"253 Washington St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"After hearing much about Casa B from friends I was so pleased to experience the joy that is the experience at this Union Square restaurant.  The owners and staff are very friendly and warm.  The decor is unique, modern, but welcoming and very romantic.  But the food is absolutely incredible.  One of the best meals I have had in a very long time.  Meals start with delicious plantain chips with (I think) an asparagus dip.  My friend and I split a variety of small plates, each one just amazing in flavor and taste. For desert I had the bread pudding and my friend tried the hot chocolate with cheddar cheese (the history of which was described by our waitress).  They have a very neat way of checking out on a portable tablet where you can rate each food item and swipe your credit card.  We loved this as it got us talking about each selection and reliving the meal.  We sat upstairs by the bar and were very impressed with the bartender who was friendly and very knowledgeable.  We took a peek downstairs which was packed by 8:30pm - and will hope to sit down there next time. By far one of the most memorable dining experiences I've had in Boston."},{"name":"Taste of Peru","address":"9521 S Orange Blossom Trl, Ste 117 A","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"The service subpar, the food mediocre.

After all, LaGrassa's is only the 5th highest rated restaurant in Boston according to Yelp!  You've probably seen them on national TV too.But, unfortunately, they only have one location that is only open from 11AM to 3:30PM on weekdays, and is closed on weekends.  So if you don't work in the Downtown Crossing area, I suggest you get your company to get them catered.  If you are in the area, get there early, say 11:30AM, so avoid the line and grab a table.I had the PASTRAMI CORNED BEEF COMBO Rumanian pastrami and \\"fresh from the pot\\" corned beef with swiss cheese, russian dressing and cole slaw served on light rye ($13.95).This was one of the best sandwiches I've had in Boston.  In fact, I even liked it better than the noted corned beef sandwich at Moody's in Waltham, which I find a bit too rich.  This is a very balanced sandwich.  But I did find that the corned beef flavor tended to outweigh the milder pastrami, so if you prefer the latter get you should get it alone.  The slaw is very good.  The house-made pickle that accompanied the sandwich was also nice, although very mild, like a very lightly pickled, fresh, crunchy cucumber.But I think it would be a better sandwich if the rye was toasted (not sure if you can ask them to do that).These are big sandwiches, so resist the temptation to order extra slaw or fries.  You can easily eat half for lunch and save the rest for later (OK, I admit I pigged out and ate the whole thing!).Service, well you stand in line to order and then listen for your name.  They will clean up your table if you dine in.  Located across from Marlieve, a block or so from the Downtown Crossing T stop."},{"name":"Kevin Rathbun Steak","address":"154 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Saturday night (7-14) my boyfriend decided to take me to Kevin Rathburns for a steak dinner on my birthday. We like to try places we have not been to before so we were excited to try it out. When we came in we were greeted by a nice host staff and we were sat down in the basement area of the restaurant. Although I was not crazy about being seated downstairs in a tiny booth against the wall I decided to make the most of the experience. The problems I take issue with started when we had just received our drinks (side note: I ordered the Ava's Adieu and absolutely loved the drink.) the man that was walking around to fill water, clean tables and bring bread baskets walked up to our table and asked if we would like some more bread. I was listening to my boyfriend talking and I did not hear what the man said so I replied with \\"Im sorry I did not hear you, what did you say?\\" This clearly made the man mad that my attention was not in the right place and he repeated very sternly and in an elevated voice \\"WOULD. YOU. LIKE. SOME. MORE. BREAD.\\" My jaw dropped at the blatant rudeness this man just responded with. What made things worse was when he walked away he looked me dead in my eyes with and angry face and said \\"Sorry I did not speak clearly enough for you.\\" Then both my boyfriend and I sat there in complete shock with our jaws dropped at what just happened. I asked my boyfriend if I had come off in the wrong way or if I sounded mean by not hearing the man the first time and he said absolutely not! I was very bothered and shaken at this point and did not want to stay for dinner being that we planned to spend a pretty penny for this dinner and I wanted to have a good experience since we are always so busy and do not get a chance to go out a lot together and enjoy each others company. My boyfriend convinced me to stay and let it go and enjoy the night and hopefully the man would not come back being that he was not our server. Our server was a nice man accompanied by a blonde lady that were very nice and attentive. Our server came to get our order and I decided to order the filet, and my boyfriend decided on the strip. I love getting a filet because it is tender yet when I received my steak, it was so tough it took some work to cut through it with my steak knife. In effort not to upset my boyfriend because he was trying to make a perfect night for me, I did not dare say a word about it. The steak was so salty I could barely stand it. I ate through it anyways even though I heard the table behind me complaining about how salty their filet was too. I was too worried to encounter another rude staff member if they were to get mad about me sending my steak back. I had some of my steak left over and my boyfriend wanted to try it and as soon as he did he looked at me with sheer disappointment that I had not said anything to him about the quality of the steak. I felt so terrible and the experience I had at this steakhouse will stick with me forever. I honestly think I could have gone to Outback steakhouse and got a filet with that quality with a staff that (hopefully) would not dare speaking in that manner to a guest paying a decent amount of money for a meal. I would like to point out that the steak was cooked to the correct temperature, and the drink was amazing so I could not just leave one star. When I left and told my friends and family about the experience they were all shocked and told me I should have gotten a manager involved, but the fact of the matter is that it was my birthday celebration with my boyfriend and I did not want to make the experience a negative memory for us especially because he was excited to plan out this evening for me. I realize now that wether I said something or not, this experience turned out to be extremely negative and has stuck on my mind since. As we were leaving, my boyfriend apologized for not taking me to Hal's, one of our regular favorites when we want a perfect steak and exceptional service. We left in utter disappointment."},{"name":"Pho Basil","address":"177 Massachusetts Ave, Ste A","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I was in Boston for a week and was looking for a great vietnamese shop.

I was the only one who had been before so I knew to order the Saturday Night Special lamb shank that is simply exquisite: Large, literally perfectly cooked to falling apart tender, wonderfully sauced on a generous, yummy bed of polenta. I have this at least once a month - even if it's just picked up to go for a solo Sat nite bite. Others enjoyed the wild boar with homemade pappardelle, linguini with seafood and lasagne. Everyone loved their food except the lasagne was not exactly a generous  portion and he mentioned it to our server. They served us 3 kinds of bread: 2 good and one, the best bread we'd ever tried. A tough, dark, fire roasted crust with super interior. They all had tiramisu which they loved and the House wine. Service is not always 5 Star...or ever, really - buts it's always acceptable at least. Prices are reasonable, ambiance is exactly what I love: never stuffy but intimately lit a busy as hell.\\nFollow UpTonight we returned and it was not as great. The Osso Bucco was great. 2 had lasagna and hated it. skimpy portion of poorly re-heated old, refrigerator tasting leftover lasagna. Nothing gooey or saucy, just sauce congealed with flour from pasta that turned into a thick, pasty gravy thing. I was shocked at how horrible it was.

It's not the fresh ambiance in the post industrial location. Nor is it the fresh, seasonal, and beyond delicious menu. It's he heart. Matt, the owner, and his wife who is also the chef put so much effort and love into what is not just a restaurant... but a true modern dining experience. Each aspect of the menu is specially curated to compliment the rest. From the hearty steak tacos with home made tortillas and crema. To the eggs Benedict served over crab cakes that would make any Bostonian proud. And not to mention, the lemon ricotta pancakes, which are so good, that the chef only puts it on the menu ONCE a year. Cafe Luna doesn't claim itself to be anything it's not. It's simple, seasonal, and delicious. And no shortcuts are taken to skimp on quality. Do yourself a favor and come here.

Not sure what is going on because this place used to be somewhat jumping.  Had a nice enough waiter but due to having almost no customers ran into several glitches with the menu.  Why are the awesome salads not also on the dinner menu?  They used to be.  He also missed coming around to our table right before happy hour ended to see if we wanted another round - which we did - and then told me he would give me the happy hour price.  Which when we received our bill he did not!  He also charged my friend full-price for the wine - it was Wine Down Wednesday and wine is discounted.  Simple things the waiter should have been aware of....I like the patio but would like to see more customers, some live music during the week or music piped in perhaps. The food was good but for happy hour they have removed the awesome artichoke dip!  Whaaaattt???  And the awesome prime rib quesadillas!  My favorite - so sad to see those two items go.  I think Little Woodrow's that just opened up the street has taken away much of their business.  I hope they get a clue and amp it up a bit so they do not go under.  Pretty restaurant, close to home, and nice patio."},{"name":"Sichuan Gourmet","address":"91 Middlesex Turnpike","city":"Burlington","stars":"4","text":"Pretty authentic Chinese food in Burlington.

There are so many brunch spots in the greater Boston area, but we picked the right one. Doing our research ahead of time, we called ahead for our Saturday 1:15pm brunch. All members of the party must be there in order to be seated. Once we were all gathered, it still took a few more minutes for the party ahead of us to leave and for our table to be cleared. It's a good thing I thoroughly menu stalked. Holy overwhelming menu, batman! If you can't find something on this menu, I can't help you. I picked the butternut squash and goat cheese omelet. I opted for the side salad, which was nice to be able to enjoy some dark greens. My table also shared the black bean home fries. A nice twist to a brunch basic. The meal was executed perfectly. The drink menu was more than just your simple bloodies and mimosas. I opted for the raspberry kiss that had prosecco. It had a gorgeous presentation. The service was a well-oiled machine. As others mentioned, it's not a huge space so they did a great job of keeping everything moving along.

The Burlington location has all the same dishes I always order, and I am equally as happy with the food. Most of the dishes taste the same with very slight noticeable differences, which is understandable because it's cooked by different chefs. Their menu encompasses a wide range of food as they try to cater to the general American population with Americanized Chinese food. Since Sichuan Gourmet specializes in Sichuan food, I would recommend to stick to their Sichuan specialty dishes. I strongly recommend the steamed bacon with fresh garlic sauce ËíúÊ≥•ÁôΩËÇâ, cold rice noodles with Chengdu spicy sauce ÊàêÈÉΩÂáâÈù¢, scallion pancake Ëë±Ê≤πÔøΩ? kungpao chicken ÂÆ´‰øùÔøΩ? fish fillets with spicy chili sauce ÂèåÊ§íË±ÜËä±ÔøΩ?(this comes with tofu), beef with spicy chili sauce Ê∞¥ÁÖÆÁâõËÇâ, Peking pork ‰∫¨ÈÖ±ËÇâ‰∏ù.

After sitting in the restaurant for a few minutes I realized it is a chain.  Everything was too perfectly laid out.  I was hoping the food would not taste like a chain.  I was not disappointed - it tasted like a chain restaurant.  Mexican Food from NYC is vibrant, it is spicy - yet complex and subtle.  This was 1 note. When you sit down, every table gets nachos. The nachos that were brought to the table were thin and did not taste like corn. I had the hard tacos. The meat was salty but no heat, I tasted no mexican cinnamon nor oregano.  I brought my cousin with me, who has lived in Florida for the past 20 years.  She loved it.  Like I said in the beginning this is a 5 star location in Florida.

It came with Belgian waffle, choice of 2 meats, eggs, jalapeno cheese sauce, and home fries. I got it with corned beef and sausage, eggs poached. They actually got the order wrong and gave me bacon instead of sausage, so they brought the sausage out on the side. The meal was OK. Belgian waffle was a little dry. Poached eggs were oddly shaped. Corned beef hash isn't my fave. Nothing spectacular. They really tried to pack in as many tables as they could. Our table felt super crammed and tight. It was uncomfortable.

I don't know what everyone else is talking about. I did enjoy the Tortellini, though the portion was small for the price. It was ok though, because I mostly filled up on apps anyway. The sauce had a slight spice that really sold me on the dish. The filling was great, too. It's a well balanced, albeit small dish. Definitely order it, but supplement your meal with something else on the menu. The staff was soo friendly. They asked us how we heard of the place (thanks Yelp!), how our days were going, and were overall very attentive. They definitely like working there, it shows. The space as also beautiful.

Some fish filets that tasted like the standard fish from buffets, nothing horrible though. I mostly focused on sushi when I saw the entree area. Deserts weren't great. Ice cream definitely tasted like it came from a powder... and not a good hot green tea matcha powder. Standard retirement home soft serve.Overall, good place to stuff yourself on slightly above average sushi for $30. Staff was great!

The staff are all super pleasant and friendly.  The food speaks for itself too; it's PHENOMENAL!  For entrees, we had the SS Duck and the Shrimp Pad Thai, both incredible.  The duck was cooked to perfection, and the Pad Thai was very flavorful and well done.  Only complaint I had was that, despite ordering the pad thai a 3/5 on the spicy scale, it felt like it was more like a 4/5.  Now I know different thai places have different measurements of spicy, so I'm not sure if their spicy quotient is just really amped up, or if somebody made a mistake?

They only had outdoor seating and you could order at the window so if it's a rainy day, I wouldn't recommend coming here unless it was through the drive thru.  I've been vegetarian for the last 3 years so I had two fries and my friend had the grilled chicken sandwich meal.  We ordered sat down and within 5-10 minutes we had our food.  Exactly what I expect out of a Chick-Fil-A.  The food was standard, waffle fries along with Polynesian sauce and BBQ....hits the spot every time.  My friend seemed to really like it.

Upon arrival, I vaguely remember this space where Pho Dai Viet is used to be another restaurant called Chopstix or something. The feel of Pho Dai Viet is definitely different from that of Pho Dai Loi. Just look at the beautiful lightings. The place feels cleaner and brighter. \\nFOOD 4/5\\nThe menu is simpler than that of Pho Dai Loi (PDL). Not a massive menu but actually a lot of times, less is more. I appreciate this menu more. Even at PDL, I only go there for pho. I ordered a medium size Pho ($12)with steak, flank and beef meat balls. Pricing is definitely higher than Buford highway. But this is no Buford highway. Rent and other cost are higher here. So I can understand that. In addition, i can definitely see the quality of the meat (especially the flank) is better, a lot better.\\nThe broth is flavorful, not as salty as those at PDL. I am not complaining. The only thing that will bump this to a 5/5 is I hope they offer a small size instead of just medium and large. \\nAMBIENCE 4/5\\nThere is no fancy d√©cor but it works. There are two separate areas with one at the back. There is this gigantic display of a bow of Pho on the left when one enters the restaurant. It's cute! I see my fellow yelpers have taken selfie with it. \\nStaffs 5/5\\nStaff here are younger than those at Pho Dai Loi. They are friendlier and can speak English very well. One staff even offered to help me take picture of my Pho. Thank you! The vibe is definitely trendier.

My girlfriend and I enjoyed our meals.  Although the food seemed less satisfying from the last time I went, I won't base my review of the taste, because I just got out of a fever and my taste buds might have adjusted being sick.

The crepe station is the far right wing, as well as the dessert station, and hot meals that is not sushi.  The middle serves condiments and sashimi![Food]\\nThere are 48 different varieties of sushi, ranging from raw to cooked.  There are KBBQ short beef ribs and bulgogi, wontons and gyozas, tempura, snow crabs and fried blue crabs, as well as many more seafood!  Hibachi is served, as well as a crepe dessert station.

The drinking vinegars are really good and very unique. The food? Inconsistent, poorly executed, and slightly better than average. Portion sizes are lacking, especially for price, and the timing was weird. We got some hot dishes before other cold dishes. The rice water that they serve as tap water is interesting, but I can definitely understand people wanting just water.Our boar dish had some pieces that were good, but many others that were overcooked. The sauce was insanely spicy, but I liked it. We also got the pork sateh with peanut sauce. Meh. Pork was inconsistently cooked, lacked seasoning, and wasn't that special at all.

I immediately looked at my Yelp bookmarks for somewhere close. My mouth started watering when I looked at the pictures from this place and the prices were very inexpensive, so I was set! He is really picky, but he loves pork, so I knew we would be good here.We walked in and it was a very authentic Taiwanese place. I was excited, but I could tell my hubby was NOT. There was an elder gentleman sitting at the counter and he did not say much, but a younger girl (she looked 12, but being Asian, she was probably 22) came out and took our orders and served us. She was super friendly. We ordered and I suggested he pick a box lunch. I got the Three Cups Chicken and he got Honey Garlic Chicken. I added an order of Gua Bao and a Winter Melon Milk Tea with Boba. He had the same drink sans boba. The Gua Bao came out and I couldn't wait. We each took one and it melted in my mouth. I asked him if he liked it and he said it was \\"alright\\".Our boxes came out and it was a lot of food. They each came with the entree, noodles, vegetables, an egg, and a soup. My husband hates seafood, so as soon as he saw the krab, he stopped eating the soup. He was not impressed with his dish, but mine was delicious. I found a little hair in my soup, so I did not finish it.The drinks came out later which I thought was odd, but maybe they consider then dessert drinks. I was thinking it would taste more like Honey Dew or Canteloupe, but when I Googled Winter Melon, it looked more like a squash. It had a decent flavor, either way.
