I love the little patio area and the inside is nice, clean and cheerful.  The people behind the register who were working there today were not very friendly (especially the blonde girl who rung us up, she was abrupt and sort of rude but I assume she was stressing because it was crowded and it took us a couple of minutes to determine what we wanted).\\n\\nInterestingly, the \\"chicken fingers\\" on my daughter's plate were just grilled, sliced pieces of chicken with some herbs.  I don't know about  you, but my kid likes regular chicken fingers so this threw us both for a loop.  However, she enjoyed them (though weirdly they were served with ketchup? What??).  AND if you are supposed to be a \\"healthy\\" restaurant, why would you serve Lays Potato Chips with everything?

I'm in the Grant Park area for dog-walking a lot, and each time I'm there for an extended stay I make sure to visit Grant Park Coffeehouse. The coffee is delicious, but the real appeal here are the baked goods -- particularly the scones. Any scone is worth trying, but the blueberry scones are my all-time favorite.\\n\\nThey also have a delicious lunch menu. I'm such a sucker for their grilled cheese on sourdough with a side of chips. They use three different cheeses and grill panini-style until it is melted perfection.\\n\\nComing in on a hot day? Try their gelato!

I've never had an issue finding a parking spot on a side street but I do encourage walking here if you can. Being located directly across from the zoo, it can get crowded. The space where you order is small and narrow, so I recommend leaving strollers and wagons, etc. outside. They also do not allow bicycles inside, but they can be tied up at one of the outside tables, or even in the little foyer between the outdoors and indoors of the coffee shop. \\n\\nThe best part?

Yet I hadn't been in a few years.  We had tickets to Cap City Comedy later that evening and we thought dinner with Mexican Martinis sounded like a fabulous recipe for our (five) couples night out.    \\n\\nI was horribly displeased when this recipe left a bad taste in our mouths.  Moreover, I feel for the parking lot dwellers, who like ourselves, searched endlessly like vultures for a place to park.  At the moment, I can only emit a sigh of regret.  I should have followed the smell of greasy onion rings to the neighboring Chili's.  \\n\\nOnce we got to the hostess stand, I recognized that things were definitely different.  They no longer seat parties larger than eight.  It was disappointing.  Luckily one of the couples was running late, so they were able to accommodate us fairly quickly.  I can't understand, with all that space, you would think that they would be able to seat large parties without violating any sort of codes.  It just doesn't make sense to me- especially when you consider the number of restaurants with substantially smaller spaces that seat large parties.  \\n\\nIn terms of the food, it's pretty good.  Yet I prefer Chuys or Curras.  The flavors are more rich and the plates come out fresh.  But we were here for the Mexican Martinis!  Excitedly,  I pour, sip...sip...What do I taste?  A paltry blend of sweet and sour, lime, and ice.  My tongue desperately searched for the tequila.  There was enough liquor to impose a ghostly apparition upon my tastebuds- only to disappear without a trace.  We all went through a shaker.  My friend goes through two...and...nothing.  \\n\\nI clearly recall the \\"two-shaker\\" only rule.  And in the past, feeling giggly after just one, I could completely understand why this rule would be strictly enforced.  Yet the martinis were nothing in comparison to their older counterparts.  Why enforce this rule when the formulas are clearly different?  We were all disappointed that we weren't even buzzed after one... or two.  Yet they cut off my  friend's intake anyway.  Boo.\\n\\nOur waitress, Kymberly, was the worst part about our  meal, and completely responsible for turning a \\"so-so\\" dining experience into a horrible one.  I can understand social awkwardness.  But a person with a terribly awkward demeanor may not be the best person to put in a food server position, or in the realm of customer service at all.  Our conversations were constantly punctuated by very rude, curt \\"excuse mes!\\"  When we discussed selections amongst ourselves she would cast a visibly annoyed face.  \\n\\nBut the worse part was that she would recite Trudy's imposed policies/rules before they were even relevant.  I asked Kymberly for a beer, and she immediately inquired if I was going to give it to my friend.  It was almost hard to keep a straight face. I was more confused than anything.  Seriously?   I laughed and said that it was for me.  Then her eyes burned straight into mine and she said that if I served the beer to my friend, then she would kick both of us out before then reciting more TABC laws.  Excuse me?  I told her just to get ME a beer...PLEASE.  :-)\\n\\nImmediately, two managers come by our table- one after the other.  The first one interrupted our conversation and announced \\"I understand that someone here ordered a beer?!  I'm here to tell you that you cannot serve it to this guy!\\"  She then sternly points at my friend, who had been cut off after having two shakers.  I snap and tell her- again- that it's for me, and the manager replies by saying \\"Well, your waitress told me that you were going to serve the drink to your friend.\\"  At this point I was completely flabbergasted by this encounter.  It started to turn into harassment when we noticed that the waitress and the managers started grabbing other waitstaff/expediters in the area,blatantly  pointing to my friend, obviously telling them to keep an eye on him.  They proceeded to stroll around like Secret Service agents, eyes locked upon us, whispering into their headsets.  It felt incredibly uncomfortable to have all these eyes staring at my friend, and at our table.  My friend just had to get up and leave.  \\n\\nIt completely killed the mood and the dinner.  I can understand wishing to protect a TABC license and adhere to municipal codes.  Yet there is way to preserve the rules without sacrificing the customer experience  and especially their loyalty.  The level of harassment was unfathomable.  But  If you can, avoid this place at all costs.

Call me a germophobe but who knows how clean peoples hands are then you touch your own food! Another thing I disliked are the unproportionate  table to chairs height. I was so uncomfortable the whole night sitting so high up from the table to the point I'm leaning forward to eat. Our server also wasn't very friendly she never once smiled and it was not very attentive to our needs. I can see why other reviews didn't like their service as well. \\nLooking at the menu I like that they have a lot of pizza variety and options for substitutions for extra charge like I got cauliflower crust with my prosciutto if you're into that. I can see why they give you board games because the service was a bit slow imo.. I also wanted to try an appy and got the mozzarella with roasted pepper because description sounded delicious on the menu and reminded me Italy for some reason lol! \\nFinally! The food arrived and the mozzarella with roasted pepper was not what I was expecting. first bite was also very underwhelming. It was unfortunately very bland tasting. What happened to the delicious Italian seasonings as described?! My cauliflower crust prosciutto pizza was not bad and not very good either.

Let me wrap it up with my final disappointment about this place. It's a birthday so we brought our own cake to cut there, Gave it to our server to keep for later, she didn't say a word about extra charges then to our surprise at the end of our dinner we had to pay extra $1 per person for \\"cutting the cake for us \\"?! They did not cut the cake for us, we did it ourselves . All they did was bring out the cake and extra cutlery. That's all!

Here is why:\\n\\nUpon entering we were greeted by a hostess that seemed extremely rushed. She rushed into he dining room ahead of us so quickly that I thought she was running away. \\n\\nOur waiter seemed as if he had never waited a table before. He was extremely nervous and awkward. He had a lot of nervous laughter. Im pretty sure he dry-heaved at one point. He also was our bartender - which was unfortunate. He suggested the diablo margarita - which he made himself - and it tasted like the cheap margarita mix you get at the store. It tasted so sour and salty that I literally held my breath and powered through. The conversation at the table turned into musing if was inebriated or just a bad waiter.\\n\\nOur order was incorrect. The paleo bowl was supposed to have tofu. It arrived with undercooked Brussel sprouts and lacking tofu.

I usually would have the same waitress but this time it was someone different and she was much older. I was a broke college student so I try to be an easy customer, not require a lot to be satisfied, and forgiving of bad service because I don't have much extra to tip. My total was about $12.15, and I tipped $0.85 to round it up to $13. The person I was with total was the same and they gave the waitress $15 in cash. She came back to me with my receipt and put in front of me on the table and started pointing at it. Her English wasn't clear so I thought she was asking if everything was correct. I was sensing her attitude so turns out she was pointing at the gratuity percentages and was asking if she did something wrong. Then she started elaborating, \\"I fiLLeD YoUR DriNKs, YoU LiKEd YoUr FoOD..\\" I was frozen because I was just in complete shock that this she felt entitled enough to approach me about getting an extra $1.  She never even brought back change to the person I was with that paid in cash, she kept their change as a tip for herself without asking. That's stealing and it's ridiculous you feel that entitled. TIPPING IS A COURTESY, NOT MANDATORY. I find it highly disrespect to confront me about the amount of the tip. Be glad I gave you something and made an effort. If you're unsatified with your pay the burden of that shouldn't be placed on the customer, it should be placed on the restaurant owner. Restaurant owners cut costs by paying waiters far below minimum wage because they expect customers to pay the other half via tipping & that's unacceptable. If restaurant owners can't afford to pay their own employees fairly, then maybe they shouldn't own a business. It's not my responsibility to financially make up for what they refuse to pay their staff."},{"name":"Hog Wild BBQ","address":"9226 SE 82nd Ave","city":"Happy Valley","stars":"3.5","text":"Yikes!

None were overly sweet and the dough tended toward the softer side (which may not be your cup of tea) without being uneven. Even the much thicker apple fritter was cooked through.

It was as incredibly rich as I had remembered, and an excellent start to the meal. \\n\\nThere was a gathering of work associates at the table behind me (I could tell because it was definitely a motley crew, with a bunch of different people you'd NEVER see actually hanging out together in the real world), and one lady revealed they were off to do one of those downtown duck tours as part of a workplace \\"team building\\" excursion. It sounded perfectly awful. But what didn't sound awful was the special the waiter announced to them, and for which most of them opted. \\n\\nBy the time he got to me, I knew I wanted the sandwich du jour, too: Bacon, goat cheese, and tomato on lightly toasted French bread. It hit the spot and was the perfect option to balance out the more decadent appetizer.

The 14\\" pie was $16 and was massive enough that I had leftovers for lunch the next day. The other choice for our table was the Quattro (Mushrooms, artichokes, basil, pepperonata, tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese) and we again got the 14\\" pie for $15.50.\\n\\nI really liked the dough in the pizza and the ricotta for my pizza was an especial highlight. But overall the pesto was really quite oily and I was a bit startled to find the pesto oil running down my fingers on my first bite. It got better when I combined the pesto with the Quattro, as it made for a less oily and more edible mashup.  \\n\\nThe Quattro - was... interesting. I had discovered during my Italian travels that the traditional Quattro pizza, which is also know as the four seasons pizza, has a very strong visual look. This pizza is split into 4 quarters, with each section having a specific ingredient to represent one season of the year. So that's what I was expecting, and instead what we got served on the table was a pizza with all of the toppings in all of the quadrants. It wasn't bad at all, just different from my expectation. \\n\\nFor dessert, this being an Italian joint, we decided to end our meal with the Tiramisu, split 3 ways.

Good food, but expensive and difficult to get reservations.\\n\\nFINALLY Magic Kingdom has something to compare to the World Showcase restaurants at Epcot.  Note that I am not including Cinderella's Royal Table in this statement, as CRT is character dining, while BOG is not.\\n\\nOk, so Disney created this lavishly-themed, 3 room restaurant that is supposed to be the inside of the Beast's castle (from Beauty and the Beast).  All the stuff from the movie: stained glass in the front, rose in the study with shredded tapestries from the Beast, grandiose ballroom. You would think that the outside of the castle would look as awesome as the inside.  Nope.  Instead of duplicating Cinderella's large castle, a 12-15 foot miniature castle structure was added to the top of the restaurant to look like a big castle that is far away.  Bummer.\\n\\nThis restaurant has been a big deal since it opened over two years ago.  Reservations are still tough to get, so reserve as early as possible.\\n\\nThe food is good and close to what you will find in Epcot. My daughter and I shared the meat and cheese tray.  Great selection and very tasty.  My wife enjoyed her French onion soup appetizer.\\n\\nThe steaks are tender and seasoned perfectly. Leftover steak tasted great the following morning with eggs.  I had the salmon and liked it. Vegetables such as baby potatoes and small onions added to the flavor.\\n\\nMy daughter wanted the strawberry cupcake.  The cake tasted like tres leches, but had way too much frosting.  It was still good, but very rich.\\n\\nGreat service.  Our server recommended a nice red wine that complemented the spice on the fish.\\n\\nBOG offers a souvenir plastic goblet with juice that costs $20.  This was a little too rich for our tastes.  BOG was one of the most expensive meals on our trip, so be prepared for the sticker shock.  Our meal came to about $55 a person.\\n\\nBecause of the difficulty in getting reservations, this should be a wake-up call for Disney to step-up the theming on its other restaurants."},{"name":"Beef 'O' Brady's","address":"2160 Howland Blvd, Ste 104","city":"Deltona","stars":"2.5","text":"Food was good and quick.

There's a lot of sugar/mirin in the marinade which made the wings too sweet. The chicken fried rice was extremely dry - it feels like the rice they used was old rice left in the fridge/ under cooked rice. The DIY platter was the best dish as they had lettuce, shiso leafs, various Mears, and pickled vegetables - more than enough for the six rice rolls provided. The trio tasted like every other meat in the DIY dish (same marinade) and the lemongrass flavour was barely detectable.

I dont think it hits any of those makes. because soul food is robust seasoning to taste with emotion. soul food and many flavors that hit all at once with a smooth long-lasting finish. Comfort food should make you want to not just sing or bop around while you eat it but take a nap after you belly is full. True BBQ the smell hits your stomach before you even order and your mouth waters getting our the car because of the smell.  sweet carrot isnt that. However it is ok. the meat was a tad dry and not seasoned like soul food but more toward banquet style with BBQ sauce. portion size are also way to small to be comfort food. i find SC to be more a health take on BBQ without the smokey taste of a true BBQ pit master. Its more of a quick light seasoning and liquid smoke taste. the facility is clean and service is good.

I would suggest to the owner or manager of this place to fix the logistics to that detail as it can be a huge downer for some. So back to my adventure, I finally decided on a Catfish Po'boy and it was music to my tastes buds. It had to have weighed about 10lbs (exaggerated ofcourse), filled with about 4 fillets of grilled catfish (choice of grilled, blackened, or fried), mixed spring mix, tomatoes, pickles, fresh coleslaw, and I requested jalepenos. The bun is a nicely toasted and buttered whole wheat kaiser style, not overly dry like most Po'boy's I had on my recent visit to New Orleans. This thing was not a sandwich, it was a man-which meal!!!! every bite was filled with pickles, slaw, grilled fish and jalepeno. I asked for the special sauce on the side which comes with their version of a tartar sauce which was mayo'ish with some ketchup and fresh pickles and also a horseradish cocktail sauce. Be warned, it was tough to get a single bite without getting messy, You'll need extra napkins for sure. This was my first and definately not my last visit. I recommend this place if you're craving seafood on the go.\\n\\nCost: $9-13 per Po'boy, $5 Gumbo (gonna try that next, saw a guy eating next to me), most shrimp items were $11-13.\\n\\nWait time: less than 5mins.\\n\\nEat on fellow Yelpers and Good luck."},{"name":"Boma - Flavors of Africa - Temporarily Unavailable","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The flavors are definitely diverse and divine at this restaurant in Jambo House.

Last night we had tickets to the Nutcracker, and when 4:00 rolled around, we figured we'd better decide where we wanted to go for dinner.  After searching and more searching, we weren't really getting anywhere.  We wanted something new (to us, at least) and interesting, but our searches kept leading us to dead ends.  We had walked past Teatro countless times, always assuming it was a trap for theatre-goers, but the 160+ positive yelp reviews convinced us to give it a whirl.  Unfortunately, yelp sooooort of led us astray on this one.\\n\\nThat's not to say Teatro was bad or anything, because it wasn't.  It was ok.  Not what I'd consider \\"good,\\" really, and certainly not what I'd consider \\"great,\\" but it was ok.\\n\\nBeer list was very limited, but the mister was happy with the Sam Winter he got.  I had an iced tea, my standby, which was good (though I think it was flavored, and that was never disclosed).  We decided to share a few different small plates - the white bean puree, the cold eggplant, and the eggplant rolatini - in addition to two of the appetizer portions of the main dishes.  When we told the waiter our order (the small plates, plus the appetizer portion of spinach mascarpone ravioli and wild mushroom risotto), he tried to convince us to order the entree portion.  The appetizer portion, he told us, cost $10 for 3 ravioli.  The entree, however, cost $20 for either 5 or 6 ravioli (depending on the day and/or the mood of the person plating the dish? Who knows.)  Really?  Could I really get 5 ravioli for twice the price of 3?  Please?\\n\\nSo yes, as you may have guessed, the service left much to be desired.\\n\\nAs for the food we ordered, it was all ok.  The white bean puree was similar to what we got free with the bread, except the free version had more flavor.  The cold eggplant was ok.  The eggplant rollatini was a little strange, because the eggplant was cut SO thinly that it was like paper.  It tasted fine, but the eggplant was not even close to the main component of the dish.  It was kind of a misnomer to even call it eggplant rollatini.  The risotto was solid (note that it is only vegetarian if you request it be made with mushroom stock instead of chicken).  The ravioli were undercooked, though the flavors were ok.  The sauce they were served with was tastier than the ravioli themselves.\\n\\nThe waiter tried to sell us on dessert, but after our pricey and mediocre dining experience, we were glad to pass.  Instead, since all of our food at Teatro came out so quickly, we were able to hightail it out of there and make it to another establishment for some dessert before the show even began.\\n\\nSo was this the worst dining experience I've ever had?

I've been here a couple of times and have been satisfied with my order, but felt it was a bit expensive for the quality of the food. I've tried their tortilla soup, the ahi tuna appetizer and the shrimp margherita flatbread. The soup was good, a bit spicy which is perfect because I really love spicy. The ahi tuna was alright. I love ahi tuna, but I felt they marinated it for too long and the marinade overpowers the taste of the fish. Their presentation is interesting, since they serve it in little spoons and I'm not sure how you're supposed to eat it. The spoons are too large to just grab the whole thing, but it's almost impossible to scoop the fish out of them. The flatbread was good as well, however the amount of shrimp on it was minimal. There was one tiny shrimp shared per square of flatbread. It may as well have been a margherita flatbread that accidentally had a sprinkling of shrimp. The service is okay.

Whenever my parents drive from a vacation in Maine back to their home in CT, we meet up for brunch/lunch here, as it's easily accessible from the Mass Pike and 95.\\n\\nWe went this weekend and were all blown away by the renovations to both the hotel and the restaurant. They are both GORGEOUS now and way more upscale! The Riverbend took down all the college pennants, which was a cute touch, but it looks so much nicer.\\n\\nAnyway, on to the important stuff.\\n\\nFood-wise, it's decent. It's not the best food I've ever had, but it's consistently good and filling.\\n\\nIn an effort to be healthy this past weekend, my mom and I decided to split 2 wraps. One was the Vegetable Wrap (grilled seasonable vegetables, hummus, whole wheat tortilla, organic spinach salad, mandarin oranges, almonds, raspberry vinaigrette) and one was the Cajun Grilled Chicken Sandwich (avocado, jack cheese, crisp onion strings, ranch dressing, on a toasted ciabatta roll - but we got it as a wrap). We asked for a salad with both instead of fries. My dad ordered the Cuban Panini (thin sliced roast pork, lettuce, tomato, ham, cheese, pickles, lime, cilantro, garlic aioli) and asked for a salad too. The waitress said she'd have to charge us all for the salads - we said fine.\\n\\nShe brought 2 decent-sized salads as appetizers and told my mom that hers comes with a salad. Turns out, the organic spinach salad, oranges, almonds and vinaigrette were a side salad - not actually IN the wrap. We were both confused by that. I did not like the Vegetable Wrap and my mom wasn't enamored of it either (plus, there were mushrooms in it, which ruins it for me!).\\n\\nAnyway, while the waitress did NOT charge us for the salads, she DID bring both my dad's and my sandwiches with fries. Now, they were good fries - nice and crispy, but not overly so, with great flavor - but we had specifically said we didn't want them. She even asked when she brought the food if I had said no fries. At that point, I just wanted to eat, so I said it was fine.\\n\\nThe Cajun Chicken Wrap was really tasty but SUPER spicy. My mom couldn't handle it, so we ended up not splitting the wraps and I ate the entire thing. I don't mind the spice, but it was a bit much. The Cuban panini (which my husband got as well), was a typical Cuban panini - not amazing, but decent.\\n\\nThe service is good - not superb, but the servers are always friendly and pleasant.\\n\\nThe Riverbend doesn't false advertise - it's a hotel restaurant in a great location with a nice view. Will I be back? Yes - the next time my parents do the drive home and we meet for lunch, and we'll have a great time and a good meal.

We went to Chinatown to get some dimsum figuring that they have the best one. Being in a foreign country, we did not have have the luxury of unlimited data on our phone, and we are are typical men who do not ask for directions. So, we parked at the corner of Keefer and Columbia and started walking to a place that my cousin researched the night before. The walk was a little uncomfortable since it was raining and cold. We did not have any umbrella too. Too late to buy one also since it was our last day.\\n\\nWhen we arrived at the first place, it was not a sitdown dimsum restaurant. It was only takeout and looks so shady. So, my brother and cousin called an audible and started looking for another one. They found Pink Pearl. They said it was only walking distance, and Google map showed it was only a 2 min walk with a 1.8 km distance. A 2 min walk ended up a 22 min because they did not comprehend how far is 1.8 km. And, this walk was under the rain, cold, and around the most shades neighborhood we have seen in Vancouver with lots of hobos. On the way, we probably passed 2 detox center. Our journey was cold, wet, hungry, and scary. I was praying that this place better be worth it.\\n\\nOnce we arrived, I was a bit skeptical. The outside does not scream good Chinese food. But, once inside, it fulfilled all of my authentic Chinese restaurant checklist. It has the round banquet table with lazy susan. The table cloths are white. The chairs have maroon upholstery. This place makes a modern interior decorator weep. The interior already made me optimistic. As we sat down, we were swarmed by all the old ladies with their carts. They were very attentive. This was very atypical since usually we have to fight for attention in good dimsum places. In here, we were the center of attention (maybe coming in at 1:30 PM helps with this).\\n\\nSo, we quickly got our food, and oh boy, they were a treat. They probably have the most massive servings that I have ever seen. Their shumai are the biggest that I ever eaten. Everything are just big! And, they are big in flavors too. Also, they have others that I have never encountered before. Better try their mushroom dumplings! I do not know what they put in there, and I do not care.\\n\\nStrange thing though was that they cart ladies were a bit pushy. We figured that they were probably trying to push to us to finish what was in their carts. Until we asked for other types, they did not tell us that we can order other types. So, we ordered more of the seafood types like the squid curry, scallops dumpling, fried shrimp balls. They were probably the best one that I have ever tasted.\\n\\nSo, with their service and the quality of food and serving size, it was well worth the walk. As we left the place, we were so happy. It stopped raining. The sun came out. We were very satisfied. It brightened up the rest of our day.\\n\\nAlthough we still encountered the scary hobos, we did not care. It was a beautiful day in Vancouver."},{"name":"The Consulate","address":"10 10th St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Way cool restaurant with a unique concept. \\n\\nI went in the time they were serving a Turkish menu.

Every time I visit this place, I simply get a cupful of the pineapple flavor (sometimes with a bit of the original tart flavor) without any toppings. I noticed that Peachwave has gotten more expensive over the years after stopping in this time. Another thing that has changed is that you can no longer sample the flavors by yourself. You must ask an employee that you want to sample a flavor and then they will accompany you as you taste it. It is a tad awkward but I can understand that they don't want people to be helping themselves to large amounts of free frozen yogurt.\\n\\nPeople say that the toppings are what makes frozen yogurt divine, but I disagree. The fruit toppings at Peachwave all looked subpar. They were not very fresh-looking and the mangos looked so unripe that I could practically taste the sourness just by looking at them. The rest of the toppings are run-of-the-mill items such as chocolate chips, waffle pieces, and sprinkles.

The restaurant was empty for dinner when we walked-in. After ordering our meals, it took the staff well over 30 minutes to make our meal and the waitress did not provide us with a single update as to why it was taking too long to make our food when the restaurant was empty. Once we got our food, the buns on the sub were completely burnt. We took a bite out of the sub to see if we could eat it (did not want to wait close to 30 minutes for another sub) but realized the sub was disgusting and not edible. We also needed another beer and we had to order a beer from someone else because our waitress was so inattentive. After we placed an order for a replacement sub, we asked if we would be getting a discount on the bill. The waitress responded with \\"we got you a new sub\\" and came up with several excuses for the poor food. She also said \\"well you ate half of the sub already\\" referring to us not being deserving of a discount when we had taken 2 bites out of the sub. We then asked to talk to the manager after we saw the new sub she brought us was also very burnt. We commented on the sub and she responded \\"is this not good enough for you?\\" Clearly the sub was not good enough because it was also very burnt. In summary, took way too long to get our food for an empty restaurant, burnt food, poor service, and an unapologetic waitress and manager.

Flavor wasn't bad though.\\n3) Pork Belly hand pulled noodles: The hand pulled noodles really saved the meal! The noodle consistency was spot on al dente! The flavor was pretty good, could have used maybe a little more salt, but to be fair, we asked for less salt, so that's probably our fault. I would definitely recommend coming back for the hand pulled noodles! \\n\\nService: \\nNeeds some improvement because it's a new restaurant but the staff was very welcoming, friendly and sincere. They apologized profusely about the slow service and seemed to really care about our dining experience. I felt like I was watching those food competition shows on TV, like MasterChef, where untrained people are trying to serve 100 starving guests and everyone just panics and efficiency and coordination is lost. Once our food was ordered, the food did come very fast! I respect the staff for trying their best, I'm sure it wasn't easy working in such a fast pace, stressful environment. Keep up the effort! I'm sure they will improve over time!\\n\\nAmbiance: \\nIt's new so everything is very nice and clean. It's not over the top in fancy decor but not a hole in the wall either. There's a pretty large comfortable dining area. When you walk in, there's a large window that opens up to the area where you can watch someone hand pull the noodles, pretty nifty. \\n\\nPrice: \\nFair prices for the portion, quality and location. The meal came out to be $30 for everything (excluding tip). \\n\\nOverall: \\nI would definitely come back for the hand pulled noodles, but I'm probably going to wait a few months until they work out the kinks on how to be more efficient."},{"name":"Galla's Pizza, Wings & Subs","address":"1155 Mount Vernon Hwy","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"3","text":"This pizza is always delicious and fresh!

It's 13$ or for more selection then 18$. Their better A+B+C menu is $32 but not worth it.\\nThe fun thing about AYCE is that you order something you wouldn't usually try. The smelt, BBQ short ribs, squash tempura, chicken wings, gyoza( I like the red vinegar they doused it in but you may not), masago cone and ... Nope, that's it. The list is of the selection that is slightly below decent. The sashimi is low grade but the salmon is salvageable. However for that price, I think this is a pretty good deal.

There was no line when I went in but on our way out, the line was about 15 people long, which is pretty insane. The waitress was nice and service was quick. I debated between the curry and the chicken donburi and ultimately got the latter. It came with a little thing of kimchi on the side. The kimchi turned out to be the most flavorful thing in my entire dish. The chicken tasted fine and so did the rice and carrots. But there just wasn't enough teriyaki sauce, as you can probably see from the picture. It barely covered a tiny portion of rice so I was stuck using the kimchi as my main source of flavor. I loved the kimchi though. Boyfriend got the steak soba and pork steamed buns. He loved both. I tried the soba noodles and thought they were very tasty. The noodles really soaked up whatever sauce they were cooked in.\\n\\nFelt a little eh about my food but I generally think this is a fine place to get a meal. The juice prices are crazy though.

We were sat down at a table and yet a server never came over to take our order. The hostess said \\"Matt\\" will be right over. Never saw the dude so I ordered at the bar.\\n\\nTheir beer style leans heavily towards German (yet modern) styles. The reason I bookmarked them in the first place is I tried one of their hazy brews while noshing on late night eats at Sizzle Pie. When we sat down, I was surprised to see no traditional IPAs on the menu at all. Just two hazies amongst the slew of German influenced beers. No worries because I'm an equal opportunity beer snob.\\n\\nTheir German beers are really well done. While I'm not sure if they are Reinheitsgebot approved, they were all pretty good... for the style. And that's the rub. They do hazy beers nearly as well as Great Notion (but not quite), yet they focus their energy in those Bavarian brews. To each their own. But I learned at a young age, if you do something well, do it. You don't see me trying to play basketball because I can't jump but I'll destroy you and teabag your death box in Apex Legends.

Right away, I tried to make reservations for our December visit and they were booked. I checked almost every week online and on the phone, even the day of and no luck. The day we went to Magic Kingdom, BF and I walked passed by the restaurant and people were lining up for lunch. An employee outside the place told us that we can walk into the restaurant and check it out a little and take some pictures.  We went inside and another employee recommended us to get in line for their lunch menu by 11 am, because by 11:30am the line would be wrapped around coming from Gaston's Tavern. We took her advise and got in line for lunch (they open at 10:30am).\\n\\nWe finally got to order our food. Since it was lunch time, you order through a touch screen, pay, find your own seats (Library, west wing and the dinning room) and servers will bring your food. You get this rose sensor thing before you order your food, which I guess allows the servers know where you're sitting.\\n\\nWe weren't too hungry, so BF and I shared the Braised Pork, which was yummy. We also got two desserts; the Strawberry cream cheese cupcake and the passion fruit cream puff.  The strawberry cream cheese cupcake was pretty good, I liked the Passion Fruit cream puff, too. BF wasn't really a fan of the cream puff since it had that sour taste to it. \\n\\nWe ended up sitting in the Library room since the West Wing filled up so fast, which was where I wanted to sit.  No big deal, once you finish eating, you can walk around the other rooms and take pictures. There's a picture in the West Wing which has Beast's face and changes every few minutes as the rose petals fall.  This place was amazing, it totally makes you feel like you're walking into the movie, from the pictures on the wall, the details to the rooms, etc. The restaurant is also inexpensive, our order was under $20 that included a drink!

We purposely picked this place to avoid the post-marathon crowds in Boston and for its large tequila list. The birthday girl called ahead to get a table, stating it was her 21st birthday.\\n\\nWe arrive at 8 for our reservation and the table isn't ready yet. Normally this is totally fine, but the restaurant was pretty dead considering it was a Monday night. We get seated after 5 minutes of waiting and go to order our drinks.\\n\\nOur waitress ends up taking licenses for everyone in the group born in '97 or later or have an out of state ID to bring to the manager in the back. This was a little strange, and I've never seen this happen at a restaurant before, but seemed they were trying to be overly cautious.\\n\\nThe manager came out and told the birthday girl that they couldn't serve her. This was because she had a vertical license, even though it wasn't expired. The manager seems like they haven't managed a restaurant before - we thought we were missing a license, to which I had to assertively and directly ask him to go find it. Granted we did receive the license back originally, a manager should be quick to right this type of situation, especially when it pertains to legal documentation.\\n\\nThis place already has had 2 under 21 alcohol violations and they are at risk for losing their liquor license. I'm not sure how having a vertical license makes any difference - I would bet most fake licenses are horizontal and don't show that someone is exactly 21. I would avoid this restaurant, especially for anyone with out of state license or if you're not over 24/25. Why the person taking the reservation didn't alert us to the potential issue is besides me. This restaurant needs to up their communication around this issue to avoid losing forever customers (our entire friend group).\\n\\nWe happily took our business to the yard house, which was a lot more crowded (should've been telling). Had we stayed, temazcal would've made over $300, which they could've used to buy an ID scanner. Without an ID scanner, I can't see them I can't see them lasting much longer, especially under the current manager.

Top 3, if not top 1, dining experience I've had in Boston so far! I had been to Alden + Harlow and loved it so I thought I would give Waypoint a try\\n\\nWait: The two of us had 8 PM reservations on a Saturday night and arrived 10 minutes early. The table before us was just finishing up their meal and we were seated right around 8...a great start to the evening.\\n\\nSetting: The restaurant is large and dimly-lit with high ceilings and interesting light fixtures. You walk in and immediately next to the hostess you will see the oyster bar filled with fresh oysters. Tables are sufficiently spaced so that even since it is a large restaurant, it feels intimate. You will not be elbow to elbow with other diners like at other seafood restaurants in the city like The Daily Catch or Neptune Oyster. \\n\\nFood: I usually reserve 5 stars on Yelp for restaurants that NAIL every single dish and Waypoint is no exception.

I can only imagine what I didn't order which warrants a trip back!\\n\\nNantucket Bay Scallop - Scallops and Pear...an unlike pair (get it?) but wow it was delicious.

Though I don't love bread, I wish I had some bread to soak up all the sauce. I was relegated to having to use my fork continuously to savor every last ounce of sauce.\\n\\nMarket Vegetables - perfectly cooked beets, spaghetti squash, and multi-colored potatoes dressed with a black garlic tehina (think hummus) and pistachios. Who knew vegetables could be so good (I'll take the recipe for this one please).\\n\\nWood Roasted Char Belly - this is one we weren't initially planning on getting but the waiter recommended it and we were so glad they did.

The host staff and coat check people were great. We got a seat upstairs which was a nice seat. The room was surprisingly loud, louder than Abes or Capital or any other steak house. It was very hard to hear my date across the table. Also, the room was so hot I had to step outside twice but I'm often warm so I won't hold that one against them!\\n\\nI ordered the 10 oz Filet, brussel sprouts and the tots. My date ordered the chicken. The bread they give you to start was great, the crisps had crushed red pepper and they were yummy. When the food came my filet was medium well, not the medium rare I ordered. There was a slight pink center but mostly brown all the way through - bummer! My date's chicken was just okay and the risotto it came with wasn't great. The brussel sprouts were cold so the melted cheese on top had hardened. The tots were yummy though, they have a truffle oil on them. \\n\\nNow, when the server dropped off the food that was also the last time we saw him. I probably wouldn't have said anything about the steak but absolutely would have sent back the brussel sprouts because those would have been easy enough to bring out a new order while we eat. \\n\\nOur martini glasses sat empty, we were never offered another round. The bus boy took away our plates when we were done -- still no server.

He said he was going to take care of our dinner and we were just charged for the drinks and he was apologetic. After we paid, we noticed that we were charged for three drinks when we only had two because we were never able to order another round - the server had padded our bill. Again, the managers handled the situation very well but I'm still really disappointed with our meal. I would rather pay one thousand dollars for a meal I enjoy than have a disappointing one comped.

The bread at the beginning was delicious, but the french toast was very average. It was different than any french toast I had before, as it was not very sponge-y, but instead almost seemed to be deep fried?

Being on Main, it was hard to find parking and I found myself circling around a couple of times before I snagged a spot. The restaurant itself had a bit of a strange layout - our tables were on a platform to the left of the entrance, and there were a lot of chairs everywhere which made it a bit difficult to navigate around. \\n\\nAll that being said, I might come back here to try out their lunch or dinner options if I was in the area, but would probably skip out on their brunch since there's other places to try in the area."},{"name":"Chile Verde","address":"4852 Sawmill Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Beware if you plan to apply the 8% rebate via Yelp.

I didn't know anything about it other than it looked new and relatively uncrowded. Upon entrance I was assaulted by a unison cry of \\"Welcome to Firehouse!\\" Soon after, it became evident they do this whenever someone comes through the door.\\n\\nI walked up to peruse the menu. The subs looked really mouthwatering in the pictures, but they were all layered with tons of meat. Finally, I spotted a veggie and a tuna, the only two that fit my dietary restrictions. I must admit that the layout is somewhat poorly conceived, as you place your order to the far right, right next to the soda fountains, condiments, and trash bins. You would think this is where you would pick up your food so you didn't have to walk clear across the place for your drink. \\n\\nSpeaking of the soda fountain, it's fancy. Like Amy notes, you can mix and match all the different flavors it features to make crazy soda monsters. It could use some instructions though, frankly. The screen doesn't look like a touch screen, but apparently is, and after getting my drink, I'm unsure whether it might have already had a selection made previously or not. If not, that cherry lime-aid is pretty freaking strange. It tasted like flat soda syrup, which lead me to believe maybe someone had pushed a soda button prior to me going up to the machine. \\n\\nMy main complaint is that the wait for my food was extremely long, like 5+ minutes long, with only 3 people ahead of me. Then they prepared it for dine-in when I needed it to go. No big deal. \\n\\nWith all these annoyances/beefs, you might be wondering, \\"why the four stars?\\" Well, a few reasons. First and foremost, the sub was really delicious when it finally was ready. Since I got it to go, the bread was kind of soggy by the time I bit into it, but the vegetables were all grilled or sauteed into a warm, tasty mess with the provolone, and it had a really good flavor. I would definitely get it again. Secondly, the concept and some of the design elements are really nice. The shop was (supposedly) started by actual firemen, and you can donate to support firemen in three different ways (round up your order total, buy empty pickle buckets, or...um, straight donation? I don't remember the third. Sorry), all of which are explained by the menu. There are some cool firemen related things hanging on the walls as well, but it's the \\"support a good cause while you eat\\" theme that sells it to me."},{"name":"Pho Huy","address":"2755 Lougheed Highway, Suite 22","city":"Port Coquitlam","stars":"4","text":"Went here cause it was next to my Doctors appointment out of convenience.

Small place with about 7 tables and no space to move once in the door. A few tables out back if weather isn't hellfire and parking about 8 spots which is actually quite large for this street. Had the rachel and the pickled veggies. All in almost $20 for a rather small sandwich and side of a few pickled veggies. The sandwich was well put together but almost too put together fro the traditional pastrami sandwich where I expect to be bowled over by the meat in an almost impossible task to eat in one bite. This fits into your mouth easily leading to the conclusion of definitely not enough pastrami. The Tate was good on its own. Slightly warm but leaner than I expected which I actually don't prefer. Cole slaw on this sandwich very good though and is worth of an order on its own as a side. Pickled veggies a pass; just not enough bang for your buck and not hungry shareable. Sandwiches are solid but they're tiny and pricey and don't really blow you away with anything involved.

It's been open for about 2 years, and I've enjoyed their cold spicy chicken before at a Lunar New Year event.\\n\\nPretty empty here for lunch hour on a Friday during holiday season. Looked through the menu and saw some lunch specials so we ordered the wontons ($7.95), there were 11 mini pork wontons in a very salty rich broth. Needless to say these were lacklustre and very salty.\\n\\nAlso from the lunch menu was the Spicy TanTan Noodles ($7.95). Not the kind I'm used to with peanut sauce and veggies. They have a watery spciy meat sauce with was also very salty. (We ended up bringing most of it home and mixed it with double the noodles for it to be palatable). The noodles were over cooked a little, not quite al dente and presentable for restaurant t quality.\\n\\nThe Stir Fried mutton slices with cumin ($15.95) was a tiny plate for the price. Again, very salty. I understand why the waitress told us to order rice ($1.50), which we eventually did since it was so salty. Tasted much better with rice. Lots  of rice. But super oily and salty.\\n\\nFinally, the only dish I really wanted from here, the cold spicy chicken ($8.95). This was delicious, a tad on the spicy side, but really yummy. The numbing spicy mixed with the herby sauce on the chicken thigh was a wonderful combination. It wasn't de-boned though, so I had a bunch of pieces with bone shards in it, making it difficult to eat.\\n\\nWe couldn't finish the latter three dishes, and having wanted to pack it ourselves, they insisted on doing it for us. I wanted to take the spicy sauce from the chicken home for more chicken goodness, but they only picked out the chicken pieces. Very questionable, since they were already sketchy not allowing us to pack it ourselves. Did they keep the sauce for the next plate? Very sketch. Definitely won't be back, and questioning what I just put in my mouth. Was it second hand food and sauce?"},{"name":"Zyka","address":"1677 Scott Blvd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"Disappointing. The food was average and bland.

I worked at WDW a few years ago and tried a LOT of them, but this blows all of them out of the water when you take into consideration price, convenience, and presentation. Definitely the most bang for your buck. Unfortunately for visitors, that means it's hard to get in! But with perseverance and patience, you can get a reservation either far in advance or even last minute. I have visited the parks three times since the restaurant opened and managed a lunch reservation for every trip. Just keep checking whenever you think about it, but daily as your trip is closer. And once you're in town, check all the time. I've gotten reservations at 1am the day of, just because someone cancelled. BUT you can wait in line if you want. Be prepared to get there early and wait a long time. They will also cut off the line if it gets too long too late. If it's hot, they will bring out water to drink in line, so it's a little better. But it's still a pretty brutal line.\\n\\nBut once you have a reservation, there are a couple options. You can either order your food in advance or order once you arrive. For the former, you will be escorted in to bring up your order and pay at the cashier and given a rose (more info later) to take to your table. For the latter, you may have to wait in another line to order at the self-serve kiosks, and then take your order to the cashier to pay.\\n\\nThe roses actually serve as a tracker device, so the servers know where to bring your food. I would recommend trying to find a table ASAP because it is crowded and you do not want the servers to be chasing you around the restaurant.  The drinks and silverware are self-serve as well at lunch, so wait to get those until you find somewhere to sit. At lunch, all of the dining areas are used, Beast's Library in the West Wing (on the left), the Ballroom (the main, large central dining area), and the smaller Gallery, that is generally Belle's library on the right. For dinner, Belle's library is not open, and it becomes a more personal, darker setting, and usually Beast is present.\\n\\nAs for the food, I have always had the same thing because it is fantastic and why stray? My friends have worked their way through most of the other options, and loved them all, but these are our highest recommendations: the French Onion soup was delicious, Croque Moniseur, Vegetable Quiche, and the Master's Cupcake. I am so happy that both of their soups are vegetarian friendly and they also have TWO vegetarian entrees, including the aforementioned quiche in addition to a quinoa salad. We have tried all of the cupcakes and really, they're all delicious, but you really do have to try to grey stuff, Lumiere's advice is spot on. The servings are large and so filling. For Disney, getting a huge entree, dessert and a drink for around $15-20 is pretty much a steal.\\n\\nThe bathrooms are aplenty and clean and small details in the decor is so greatly appreciated.

I guess the first if it's kind in Us to serve the not so famous \\"Awadhi Biriyani\\" which is an exotic dish but  it's as that most Indians don't know about it . They serve Galouti kebab as well which is probably the most tastiest Kebob on earth and again this is the only restaurant that serves it. You have a full bar and every other famous Indian dish can be ordered from the menu. The owners are friendly and welcoming and are ready to orders off the menu or customize things for you if you can give them that extra minute. The decor is very pleasing too . The food takes you to Awadh/Murshidabad kinda god which is great but very less known in other parts of India . This is a must go eatery in Columbus Oh. Lastly they prove again \\"Indian food is spicy\\" is a myth in the USA , not all dishes are spicy and still very very tasty . I also had the privilege to eat their catering order and I was dumbstruck with the food they served on a catering order , its difficult to maintain that level of consistency with the taste when you are serving 100s but they nailed it.

During the day, my experiences with this Taco Bell have been about as good as any other. The problem is that during the day, there are plenty of food options more appealing than Taco Bell, so my visits are usually at night.\\n\\nThe night crew is generally pretty bad, but it seems to really depend who is working / managing for the night. My last experience was the most hilariously bad, and of course folks tend to leave reviews based on exceptionally good / bad experiences:\\n\\n1. Pulled up to the drive through intercom, repeated my order three or four times, was read back my order incorrectly on a couple of occasions, genuinely thought I was being trolled for a second there.\\n\\n2. Pulled up to the window and clarified my order again for the fourth (or fifth) time, was told to pull around to the parking lot because they were cooking fresh potatoes (yay!). Asked for a few packets of fire sauce.\\n\\n3. Waited three or four minutes, which is par for the course when ordering potato items after ~11pm, and which I honestly prefer because the alternative is getting potatoes which are either inedibly lukewarm or burnt to a crisp.\\n\\n4. Got my food, went home, and did my best to enjoy my usual late night Taco Bell experience: 100% lukewarm spicy potato soft tacos, and bean paste which tasted like it was cooked an hour too long. Opened the bag and discovered I was given ~25 packets of hot sauce, which I promptly threw away because we already have about ~60 packets in our dedicated Excess Taco Bell Sauce Drawer because I'm incorrectly given hot sauce about half the time, which no one at our house eats.\\n\\nMy only problems with this location have occurred at night, and the issues are usually with food quality -- not with service. It's almost as if they turn off their fryers to save energy (resulting in almost inedibly lukewarm food), or food is cooked for much longer than it should be, resulting in a burnt taste / incinerated potatoes, etc.. To be fair, I don't think they've ever gotten my order wrong, and the service is usually pretty decent.\\n\\nIn the end, this is a Taco Bell -- so you can't expect much.

We were seated in a smaller dining area that was very serene... ideal for the occasion. \\n\\nI ALWAYS order Taste of Africa to start, which features a basket of various African breads / crackers as well as 4 different types of spicy dips. On this occasion, we ordered 2 of this starter, which was a hit with our table. I recommend this starter for any first-time diners at Jiko!\\n\\nI ordered the seared scallops with spinach and rice... so delicious! The scallops were perfectly seasoned and seared, and the spinach was wilted with just a bit of applewood bacon. Other folks around our table raved about the lamb dish and the maize-crusted fish. And, of course, the famous Jiko mac n cheese was the belle of the ball. If you love mac n cheese, be sure to inquire about the secret, off-menu mac n cheese. It's worth exploring your options.\\n\\nOverall, the dining experience was simply amazing. The food and atmosphere exceeded expectations... which were already incredibly high.

They did not engage or fully answer when asked.  It was a bit of an adventure to figure things out.  The tables and overall areas were clean.  There is lots of parking.  I do not eat sushi so I won't post about it.  There was also a hibachi area that was confusing to navigate.  There were raw items on either side of the flat top and it was unclear where to line up.

They were both so awesome!  We took home their famous warm bread pudding topped with raisins and covered with a bourbon sauce.  My thanks and praise goes out to the chef!   OMG!!!!  Heaven on earth.  The bread pudding had to be the best bread pudding that I ever had.

Pizza slices were huge for the price. The pizza was actually good New York style pizza. The only reason I gave them 3 out of 5 stars was the girl behind the counter was not very friendly. I asked a few questions and she seemed annoyed. I also asked while my food was being made of I could have drink in advanced. I got a face and then gave me the drink. In a town where restaurants are a dime dozen I won't go back because of that bad service.

Right is right and wrong is wrong. I had tab open at the bar, and I thought that was separate from the server since I was sitting at a table with a friend, so I declined when she had asked if I wanted a drink, especially since I had a drink already from the bar. I continue to order one more drink at the bar, and after I had finished my drink, the server came around and asked if we wanted drinks, I acknowledged and ordered a drink from her, and started a new tab with another card. I thought I was helping her out that way, but in reality I was charged twice. I asked her about it, and she pretty much blamed me for it, said if it was a money issue then just don't tip her, but that she wouldn't have wrote it for fun if I didn't order it. She might've wrote it, but it doesn't mean that I ordered it or neither received it. It's not about a money issue here, but the principal. So, when I went up to close my tab at the bar, the bartender then gave me an attitude when I asked to close my table saying \\"yeah, maybe.\\" Honestly, I don't understand what I done to receive such an attitude. Right is right and wrong is wrong. I've never been the type to try to cheat the system and try to get a freebie, like on everything to my dead granddad, and for them to make it seem like I was trying lie to something free is very frustrating and hurtful. I've brought a lot of business to this place, and been a great tipper, even when I wasn't treated the best. There are at least 3 people that work there that I wished I would've got their names, because they treated me like a regular human being. I've brought this place much business before, by bringing 8-10 coworkers to come in after work, as well as celebrating birthdays with tables of 6-8 before. I've told many friends about this place, and for these handful of individuals, who represent your company to treat me as a second class citizen is very disheartening. Ron Tom, you lost me as a customer and it kind of hurts, because I raved and spread so much word about you guys, but now I have nothing else more to say but that I won't be returning and won't be recommending you to anybody anymore."},{"name":"Pizza Hut","address":"700 Maguire Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"Went there for lunch today with a couple of coworkers- ordered breadsticks only.

Given the ambiance and all the gushing praise, surely this was a winner...Right?\\n\\nHow could I have been so wrong???\\n\\nWe arrived a bit late for our reservation due to horrible traffic and difficulty finding the parking deck. Don't worry, we called ahead to inform the host.\\n\\nThe decor of the restaurant was interesting, and eclectic...it called to mind the home of a well-heeled jetsetter, who brings back various sundries from every voyage.\\n\\nOnce seated, our server came over, and began to tell us about the restaurant's concept in as unenthusiastic a way as possible. My date remarked with a single word when he departed: Draining. For the short time we were there, it never got any better.\\n\\nOur plan was to order a round of dishes, try some of the craft cocktails for which The Consulate is known, and order a second round before indulging in dessert.\\n\\nFor our first course, we selected the Dry Sauteed Thai Okra, the Punjabi Chickpea Salad, and the Korean Pulled Duck Confit. As I'm vegan & GF, we wanted an assortment that allowed me to experience both the resident & visa menus.\\n\\nThe highlight of the Thai Okra was the sauce. Otherwise is was less that stellar. We both started here, and after the first bite, my hopes of a romantic evening of \\"good food, good wine, & good company\\" quickly went downhill. \\n\\nI've dry sauteed okra before. This was virtually raw, with a sweet and slightly spicy sauce poured atop. \\n\\nThe Chickpea Salad was devoid of all the flavors I think of in Punjabi cuisine. There was no ginger, garlic, cumin, or mango powder...there didn't seem to be any salt or other detectable spice at all. The cucumber held on to some of its crunch, so there's that.\\n\\nMy date ate two bites of the duck confit, and refused any more. \\n\\nThe server's few visits to check on us continued to exacerbate things, as my companion found him dry and unwelcoming. Instead of engaging in stimulating conversation about life and philosophy, our attention turned to the disappointing food. \\n\\nRather than try our luck with the craft cocktails, and hope for better in a 2nd round of dishes, we requested the check. No complaints; just exit, stage left. \\n\\nHalf an hour later, we were in Briarcliff enjoying a fantastic dinner at Desta, my trusted go-to. Good food, good wine, good company, indeed.\\n\\nI'm a huge fan of Indian cuisine, and have tasted food from many of the regions. The Consulate offers...something else; it's not a \\"fresh twist\\" on tradition. \\n\\nTheir jaunt in China starts July 1st. I'm not sad to say I'll miss it.

We were seated at the way way back (love that movie) of the restaurant, and asked if we would like a drink.  We were still deciding (wine or cocktail?) so she brought us water.... and never came back one single time.  Literally, we never saw her again. Once we realized we would never get to order a drink, we finally got up to go to the salad bar.  Sadly, the salad bar was the best part of the meal.  Limp lettuce, unfresh veggies, and bottled cheap salad dressing was actually better than the meat.  Once the meat started coming, we let them cut us off a piece of everything, when in Rome, right?  The Brazilian Cowboys were the only good thing about this whole experience.  The meat was beyond greasy and basically unrecognizeable by taste.  I think we probably tried about 15 meats, and I actually only swallowed 4 pieces, which I instantly regretted with each swallow.  There was so much half chewed up and spit out pieces of meat on our plates, it was flat out disgusting to even be near our own plates.  Eventually, we gave up, got up (we never got a check because we never saw our waitress again, remember?), and went to the front to ask to pay and leave.

As someone who has had hotpot worldwide, I have to say that this place meets most of my criteria. I think it's hilarious how they call it \\"Happy Lamb\\" Hot Pot when the lamb that we are eating were probably not happy when they realized they are about to become our main course for the night.\\n\\nService: 4.5/5, very good for the amount of volume that they have to deal with, very rarely do I have to get up and get my own napkins or utensils if all the waitstaff is busy\\n\\nFood: the lamb is delicious, there are 3 different types of lamb for the hotpot and I think they are all great. I suggest you try them all. The lamb dumplings are good too, but often served a bit on the lukewarm side which makes me a little paranoid eating potentially medium cooked lamb. The skewers are well seasoned and very flavourful. I'm going to be honest, the Napa is a little on the stemmy side so I no longer order that veggie. Instead I order the watercress which is both abundantly leafy and fresh. I recommend the half spicy and half original broth for the best of both worlds\\n\\nBathroom: could be more clean but I guess since hundreds of people go through there after eating hotpot I cannot expect to eat off of the floor there :)"},{"name":"MoMo Cafe","address":"649 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4","text":"I just came here for some donuts and they were good could use more taste but they weren't terrible.

There is only one place were you can do all three... here at the Magic Kingdom at this new Be Our Guest Restaurant!  \\n\\nWhen they opened up this fun place, many of my friends who are cast members were able to get in for many of the soft openings and enjoy wonderful experience.  Not being a Disney Cast Member anymore, i was thrown back to the masses and like every other guest, had to make a reservation and wait a few months before getting a table!  I actually checked for a table around my birthday which was about 4 months away and only found one night close to it that had an opening.... at 9 pm at night.  But I took it and decided to just go with the flow!\\n\\nMany times I had been checking out the new fantasy land and had walked by BOG and saw long lines out side.  I figured that these guests had made lunch reservations months in advance.  What I did not know was that for lunch, it was counter service!  Anybody could come for lunch and wait on line!  So one afternoon, some friends of mine invited me to join them for lunch and that's when i found out about the no reservation needed point.  We only waited about 30 min and soon found ourselves inside and enjoying a fun meal.  \\n\\nFor lunch, they give you a 'rose' and by using this rose you order your lunch from the touch screens.  Then you go find any table in any of the rooms.  We choose the west wing which for some kids was too creepy!  Then after about 10 min, they find your rose via sensors in the table and they can match up the order to your location.  Cool!\\nI had the Croque Monsieur Sandwich and a side of green beans instead of french fries.  Both were very good.  For dessert, I had to try the Triple Chocolate cupcake!  Again, great and super sweet.     The room itself is great and spooky.  The special effects are cool.  Keep your eye on the portrait of the prince... \\n\\nSo when I finally made it to dinner for my birthday, it becomes more of a regular sit down meal with servers taking your orders.   We arrived on time but still had to wait about 15 min before we were called in.  Once inside, we were seated in the main ball room.  They only have the main ballroom and west wing rooms open at night.  The extra large side room is only open for lunch to help accommodate the many guests wanting to eat there.  We were sat toward the back and the large bay window were it was snowing outside.   The beast himself is in attendance during dinner.  Every so often, they make an announcement and he comes out, walks around the dining room waving, and then heads back to a room up front to sign autographs and take pics.  \\n\\nOur server was nice but I could tell she was tired.  Again, this is at 9:30 pm and the place was still busy.  She took our order and was gone for longer than I liked.   She finally brought bread and our wine.  The bread was good but the wine glass was covered in finger prints.... yuck.  I cleaned it myself.  Our meals did come out after about 30 min.  We had the French Onion Soup and Potato Leek soup for starters.  then we enjoyed the Saute Shrimp and scallops in puff pastry as well as the Salmon.  We always try to order different things so we can share and try each others food.   All of it was great!   We also had cupcakes for dessert.  This time I had lemon meringue and my partner had chocolate.    All in all it was a good meal and came out to around $100.  And because it was my birthday, I was given a taste of the 'Grey stuff'... it was okay but not sure what flavor it was!  LOL... \\n\\nThe difference between sitting in the two rooms was noticeable.  The west wing was a bit more quite while the ball room was super loud.   Not the best place for anything romantic.  The dress code is Disney... that means anything from ball gowns to tank tops.   I will say some of the guests were dressed up like they were at a prom.   This was probably the best place they had ever eaten at since once they got the bill, i overheard on of their kids say... 'This place is real expensive!\\"...  \\n\\nAtmosphere  9\\n\\nService 8\\n\\nFood 9\\n\\nI could not give 10 for anything since there were many 'little things' that kept me from being able to rate it that high.

My boyfriend had to get up a million times for napkins forks etc and I felt bad. He also had to grab our drinks by himself. The food was really awful and I hated it. Worst meal ever no offense. I also found a booger looking thing in my food which was absolutely horrid. We spent 60$ for our 3 year anniversary what a waste. I would've rather went to Cinderella's castle. Another thing that makes me so angry is the fact that you need a reservation when it's basically a food court and a lot of seating for people. This is deff over hyped and I will never ever go back.

Some staff are very friendly; others seem mildly annoyed that you are trying to pay. The location is very clean despite being small and busy. My biggest complaint is the pricing - $5-6 for so-so soup. Add bread and a drink and you're at $10 easily. The soup is self-serve so the best ingredients get taken when a fresh pot is brought out.

If I have ever shopped at the Nordstrom Rack in the Clackamas Promenade, across the street from the mostly enclosed Clackamas Town Center, then I've probably dropped by Great Harvest Bread to get a free sample of their bread.\\n\\nThen, both guilt and curiosity prompted me to buy a loaf and Great Harvest Bread's \\"entry level\\" loaf of bread, which they bake daily, is the honey wheat bread.  It's not cheap, but the quality and the honest taste is something that is immediately evident.  However, they make various kinds of bread and, the more creative and decadent they sound, the more caloric, sugary, and expensive they are.   Some are only baked on certain days of the week.  \\n\\nThat said, when I've gone in for a sample, I've always opted for a slice of cinnamon burst bread, which is downright delicious and is one of the breads they bake daily.  My gut hunch, however, is that the apricot walnut bread, which they bake only on Wednesdays, is the best of the lot.  I will get around to buying a loaf of that apricot bread.\\n\\nGreat Harvest Bread is located right next to the Nordstrom Rack.  Maybe that was a strategic thing.  With the savings at the Rack, maybe they figured you've got a few extra dollars to plunk down on a few loaves of their fancy and tasty bread.  They are open from 7 to 7 every day, but closed on Sundays, so don't go around on Sunday doing your shopping for the week and also plan to stop by Great Harvest Bread because it will be closed.  Note that they also serve cookies, desserts, feature lunch fare, and have a punch card to help you get ... you guessed it ... a free loaf of bread.  Additionally, the customer service is excellent.\\n\\nMostly, I buy bread at the supermarket or at the Franz bakery outlet and it's fine ...  it's entry level, garden variety bread.  Then, I might get a loaf of bread if at Bob's Red Mill, which isn't too often.   The bread at Great Harvest would be the Cadillac of these breads.  So, to give this bakery a rating, it's 5 stars for the free bread they let you sample, because it's as good as it gets, and 3 stars for the loaf of bread you might buy because it's a little pricey.  That averages to 4 stars, which translates to fan status.  And, with all the samples of their cinnamon burst bread I've had over the years, fan status would be fairly accurate."},{"name":"D/6 Bar & Lounge","address":"39 Smithe Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I loved the ambience here.

When they slam that bucket of ribs on your plate while singing about it being dinnertime, you'll know you've arrived. The ribs are fantastic. Delicious barbecue sauce and such tender meat, you won't forget it's all-you-can-eat. By far the best food I had a Disney World on this trip, but let's be honest that's not saying much. It was probably the only really *good* food I had on Disney property.\\n\\nIt's also all-you-can-drink. My brother-in-law and I managed to drink two pitchers of Yuengling between us during the show. Perhaps that added to the enjoyment? We could have easily gone for a third pitcher. Also, if you ask for it, they'll serve wine to you in one of the beer pint-sized Mason jars. So, yeah, do that.\\n\\nAs for the show, it's Disney, so you know what to expect. It's over-the-top, of course, but, there are fun moments of audience interaction, and I appreciated that some of the jokes were designed for the adults in the room.

This part of the neighborhood looks OK, though. Dining room, while large, definitely looks a bit dated, with cheesy big screen TVs all over the place. Looks like a venue for a Hong Kong high school prom.\\n\\nTHE VERDICT: While the bulk of Vancouver's Chinese restaurants worth visiting have decamped to Richmond, this joint serves classic OG dim sum, and is worth the 'walk on the (semi-) wild side' for some great Chinese chow.\\n\\nRecommend."},{"name":"Barnie's Coffee & Tea Co.","address":"118 S Park Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Great place!

Hubby got the bruschetta chicken which he deemed to be only okay.  My California burger sounded wonderful as it was to be topped with avocado, american cheese, lettuce and tomatoe.  I love avocado so I ordered it with a side of garlic fries.  Two things made my burger disappointing - they were out of avocado and they overly toasted my bun.  See photo for evidence.  : (  However, the garlic fries were outstanding!  I absolutely love garlic and will double any amount called for in a recipe!  It's no wonder that these fries are legendary.  Hubby agreed.  Since it was happy hour, I ordered an Elderflower & cranberry martini which was light, fruity and refreshing.  Turns out I didn't get the happy hour price due to there being an event (aforementioned hockey game), when they charge full price.  It was written in small letters on the menu.

The spanakopita wasn't as warm as it should have been and it clearly wasn't made in house, I'm guessing it came from a freezer pack. The rice and salad that came on the platter were both terrible. The rice was a cheap, soggy, salty version of pilaf that was barely edible. The salad consisted of a couple of sorry looking pieces of iceburg lettuce, some pitiful looking tomatoes and a couple of olives. Even though I was hungry I didn't take more than a few bites of anything on my plate. Sadly, my meal was a lot better looking than the chicken cutlet sandwich that my husband ordered. The chicken cutlet sandwich was clearly not made from a cutlet but was mechanically separated chicken. It looked disgusting and apparently it tasted how it looked. The fries weren't bad. \\n\\nI would have given this place two stars if the service had been good but it wasn't. Our waitress disappeared after our food showed up. We had to flag her down for water refills. Even when she was flagged down she only refilled one of the empty water glasses and walked away. I'm not even joking. We had to flag her down again so we could BOTH get water refills even though there were two empty glasses on the table. \\n\\nI will never eat here again.

It's taken me far too long to set up reservations for this! Finally my family planned an outing and we reserved a table for the first show of the night. First thing's first, you'll park at the Fort Wilderness Campground and then have to take the resort shuttle to Pioneer Hall. The property is really large so to get around, the resort provides complimentary transportation. Because of this ride, you'll want to give yourself plenty of time. We arrived to our show about 30 minutes prior to when the doors open. Restaurant staff will come out and provide everyone their table tickets so that when it's time to go inside you'll be escorted to your personal table.\\n\\nOnce seated, your server will take your drink order. This is unlimited soda, beer and sangria and it's all included in your price! Our server told us she had been working at the show for years. She was a little on the surly side but we were able to warm her up a little and get a smile. My only complaint was that she wasn't very attentive to drink refills. After the drinks, you're given salad and cornbread to start. Everything is served family style and it's typical fashion here to have the server's slam the buckets of food on the table. The atmosphere is western, it's loud but it's all in good fun. My salad was ok, I loved the cornbread and the sangria was refilled throughout the night! When dinner is served, help yourself to fried chicken, ribs, corn, cowboy beans and mashed potatoes. And it just keeps coming! Truly, the fried chicken is phenomenal! The whole meal was well worth the money! A friend recently told me, that you can also special request mac and cheese for no additional cost. Lastly, for dessert is strawberry shortcake. This was the only part of the meal I didn't like and barely ate. The cake was really dry and had hardly any flavor to it.\\n\\nThe show is performed off and on throughout the meal and it is really spaced out well. They don't perform while dinner is served. The show is cute and a little corny. 6 actors dance and sing and conduct a lot of audience participation. The songs are O My Darling Clementine and such. Towards the end, they bring out wash boards and have someone from each table perform with them. They are great improvisers, in the beginning of the show, they go around the hall asking people where they are from and singing a few bars about their home state. The whole experience is 2 hours long and absolutely worth it. We laughed the whole time. It's great for families and large groups.

But if you're not a fan of Eastern European-style sandwiches, or you're not in the mood to eat a sandwich quite that large, you're still in luck.

The top layer of the broth is completely filled with chili pepper. They really don't mess around with the broth. Both were very flavorful and delicious. They also do not skimp on the portions of meat served. One plate of each type of meat is enough to share between two people. When ordering, don't forget to ask for the sesame sauce which they also provide a large portion per person. I enjoy mixing the sesame sauce with a little bit of the spicy broth and dipping the meat into it before eating. When we got the bill, we realized they accidentally gave us a dish we did not order. They happily took that off for us. Only thing I wish they had are plastic bags for your coats and bags so they don't smell like hot pot after the meal.

We had been having drinks at several stops before coming here for a late night happy hour with food. I made the mistake of asking for a well drink. DO NOT do this. They will look at you like you have 3 heads, and belong at the Yamhill Pub. This is a proper cocktail bar, so you will not be allowed to drink swill. I do have to admit that there is bit of pretension here. Just know, and embrace it, and you will be fine.\\n\\nNow, to the Heavy Petting. It is a cocktail made with Monopolowa vodka, grapefruit juice, Aperol, quinine syrup, lemon peel. I usually get this, or whatever they are serving from the punch bowl. Their other cocktails are excellent too. Because I like my bourbon, I will order a B.M.O.C. (bourbon, raw ginger syrup, Angostura, soda water), or Bourbon Renewal on occasion. A word of caution. Any of these fine and tasty cocktails will knock you flat on your ass, sending strange Twitter & Facebook updates in no time. Pace yourself. You have been warned. They are so delish though.\\n\\nThe popcorn. I have been trying to emulate their version at home. It's popcorn, right? Whatever they're doing with it is pure magic. Like curl your toes goodness. I also have a thing for the grilled cheese with aged sharp cheddar, and wild mushrooms. I can't have happy hour without ordering the almonds and olives. Again, simple. I love nuts, but I like them roasted nicely. There is a teeny tiny fine line between too raw, and burnt. Somehow, they always find that sweet spot. The items on happy hour that I have listed above keep me coming back.\\n\\nOn my last visit, my friend Kim & I wanted something sweet to polish off our HH smorgasbord.

LOL. Once we received the box, it was a shitshow. The two of us took savage bites out of the donuts, and swigged it with coffee. Blue Star definitely lives up to the hype. \\n\\nOur favorite was the bourbon blueberry-- so unique. Lemon poppyseed is also a must-try, as the sweet and tangy lemon icing and interesting poppy flavor pair beautifully together.\\n\\nOther favorites include Mexican hot chocolate (decadent thick chocolate with a spicy kick), and creme brulee-- a creamy filled donut with a pipette full of diabetes stuck into it.\\n\\nHands down the best donut place I've had.

We had the special crispy duck on a nest of creamy mashed potatoes surrounded by an amazing sauce.  The steak frites, perfect!  The deserts right down to the chocolate creme Burlee a perfect ending. All this was exceeded by the most attentive service including visits by chef Orfaly making sure everything was Perfect and it was.  I have not had food like that in years.

I will not be returning, and I have not recommended any of my friends and acquaintances to try this place. The first time that my family and I visited this restaurant was an OK experience. We wanted to try a new Brazilian Steakhouse, so we stopped by. The salad bar consisted of items that one could easily find at the local Kroger or Walmart from canned foods, but the cheesy bread was very warm and tasty. The meat was not excellent but pretty good. We returned a second time later on. The second time we returned was our last time. \\n\\nThe manager was extremely rude and demeaning towards me and my family when we went to Red and Green the second time. It was uncomfortable and upsetting to see and hear her gossiping to her coworkers about our family. She was very unprofessional. She asked my family and the family that came in after if they made reservations when CLEARLY, there was plenty of empty space in the restaurant (now I know why), claiming that Saturdays were their busiest days. When both families said \\"no,\\" se proceeded to speak in a demeaning way that gave off an air of arrogance about the restaurant that was not necessary. I've been to Fogo de Chao and Chama Gaucha. I've seen people come without reservations and simply told how long the wait time would be without fuss, demeaning behavior, or arrogance. The salad bars are much fresher and worth the price at those places as well. In addition to the rude manager, the wait staff barely came over to our table even though our cards were flipped to green. When we asked for certain items, we were repeatedly forgotten about despite how few tables were occupied at the time. Our second visit consisted of meat that was not seasoned or cooked well. I eat my red meat medium rare, but at several points throughout the evening, I was served rare lamb meat and rare beef. \\n\\nOverall, I do not recommend this place to anyone because of the rude service, under-seasoned (and not properly cooked) meat, and sub-par salad bar. Not worth your money for an experience that will leave you feeling insulted, dissatisfied, and annoyed.

It was fantastic! I enjoy salmon and I am always bummed when I order it at a restaurant and it is dry or tastes like fish oil. Dave's grilled salmon was cooked perfectly, tender, juicy, so good. I also liked the accompaniments. The broccoli was lightly salted and tender and the grilled pineapple was perfection. It was perfectly ripe and caramelized. Sweet, tangy, juicy, my mouth waters thinking about it. The best part is that I think the whole meal has less than 600 calories and I was completely satisfied. I didn't even feel the need to finish my son's dinner. \\nAs for the restaurant experience, the service is hit or miss. I would say about 25% of the time we have lackluster servers but the rest of the time they are good or great. \\nMy kids like the chicken strips with their ranch (I think it has a bit of dill in it, it is really good), and the naked ribs. I also recommend the ribs naked since you really get to enjoy the smoky flavor and all the sauces are right there on the table so you can sauce them up any way you want. A tip from my husband, if you like the really hot stuff ask for Wilbur's Revenge.

So happy to see the old Pikaichi space reopened!! We checked out Isshindo on a Friday night and since it recently opened, there wasn't a long line yet which was a plus for us! We tried the Takoyaki which was delicious and the Karaka Ramen which is a spicy tonkatsu broth topped with mushroom, egg, beansprouts, and char siu. The char siu was tender and sliced thinly. The broth can be a bit salty but it was flavorful. Noodles were more on the chewy, al dente side. I would give it a go and say it's a solid spot to add to Boston's ramen scene!"},{"name":"Firenze","address":"9 Babcock St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"If I could give this place NEGATIVE stars, I would.  And I don't think I'm a spiteful or petty person, but the attitude I encountered here was nothing short of appalling.  I had hoped to give this place a good review because I'd heard so many great things about it.  Unfortunately, I wouldn't even get the chance to dine here.  My boyfriend and I walked in and the first thing we noticed was that it was pretty busy and it looked really cozy and cute.  In fact, the dining room was so small and intimate that we could see that there were just 15 or so tables.  But we did see 2-3 tables that were open and I was glad we wouldn't have to wait long to be seated.  The waitress walked by us and asked if we could give her just a minute.  No problem.  We waited a minute while she went to clear dishes from a table.  But when she came back to us, I swear to god this is what she said: \\"We have no tables for you now.\\"  She offered NO apology or explanation (e.g. \\"all the tables have been reserved\\" or \\"it'll be about a 20 minute wait\\") and just stared at us.  Too stunned to reply, we simply walked out the door, baffled by what just happened.  I have NEVER in my life been turned away from a restaurant in that manner and you can be sure I won't be going back!  Whether this was a case of racism, ageism, or something else--I don't know, but her attitude was just downright rude.  Oh, and when we first walked in, my boyfriend swore he saw someone give us dirty looks, but I didn't notice this myself so I can't say for sure if this is true, but I really have no idea why they would do so in the first place since it's not like we walked in barefoot and in rags...

I was really enjoying my time at Grant Park Coffeehouse and I thought it would be my new, daily work spot. However, an incident involving the employees and my sister left a bad taste in my mouth. \\n\\nHere's the story: I was spending every day of the week at GPC for almost the entire day. What I would do was show up at about 10am and stay until about 4:30pm while I worked. I would be sure I bought items from their menu in order to justify taking up their space and wifi for so many hours. In fact, I spent a small fortune in the place over the course of 3weeks of daily visits. After 4:30pm I'd leave to go pick up my sister from school and then we'd go back to GPC together and work for about another hour before leaving for good. On the day in question, I picked my sister up and she decided that she was going to treat me to a coffee or perhaps an ice-cream cone which we had enjoyed a few times previously. \\"Awesome!\\" I said and I copped a seat at one of the outside tables while she ran in. She said she really needed to use the bathroom first before she made the order so off she went. \\n\\nWhen she came back out she was visibly shaken and when I asked what happened she started telling me how the employees treated her when she went in. She had asked them where the bathroom was since she'd never used it there before and that's when one of the employees asked, very forcefully, \\"Are you a customer??Bathrooms are for customers only!\\" And she replied, \\"Well, I will be buying something but I just need to use the restroom first, please.\\" She said that when she came out of the bathroom they were all staring at her--I'm talking maybe 4 employees at once--just to make sure she actually made a purchase. She said she felt very uncomfortable. Mind you, they have signs all over the shop stating that bathrooms are for customers only and it is a rule that we have always and will always abide by, BUT you don't have to treat people that way especially people who have been patronizing your business for the past several weeks. She still bought the ice-cream but we were not happy eating it.

I have to say that as far as food goes, the Animal Kingdom takes the win hands down. The service is also top notch also. We were almost 40 minutes late to our reservation because of a delayed shuttle and they were completely understanding of the situation and held our reservation for us when we called in. The restaurant is also quite elegant and it really allowed us to share a romantic meal together which I appreciated since we were on our honeymoon. While we were looking through the menu, we nibbled on some delicious Ethiopian house bread with salted butter. \\n\\nWe decided to order the North African Beetroot Salad (Toasted Sunflower Seeds, Lamb Merguez, Herb-Buttermilk Dressing), Garam Masala Spiced Sea Scallops (Warm Applewood-smoked Bacon and Spinach Salad, Fennel-Carolina Gold Pilau), Botswana-style Seswaa Beef Short Rib (Cassava-Potato Pur√©e, Sambal, Mushrooms, Tamarind Demi-glace) and the Braai Macaroni & Cheese (Provolone, Fontina, Gruy√®re, Asiago) to share. The beet salad was a delight even though the portion size was smaller than I expected. I thought that it had a good texture to it and the dressing complemented the beets very well. I enjoyed it but I might be biased because I love beets in general. \\n\\nI never order scallops because I don't really like them all that much but these scallops were some of the best I've ever had. Perfectly cooked and I absolutely adored the pilau rice it came with. It was even better when I ate it with some of the macaroni and cheese. Delicious. The macaroni and cheese was HUGE. When we ordered it, we thought we were ordering a side but this could easily have been a meal by itself. We thought it was a little dry actually but it had good flavor. The beef short rib is probably the only dish that could have been a little better. But in hindsight that was strictly because my husband loves braised short ribs and orders it often at many restaurants (including some very well known restaurants) and he felt that the short ribs at Jiko could have been more tender. It was still really tasty and we finished it down to the last bite. \\n\\nI recommend dining here if you're ever at the Animal Kingdom. I don't think you necessarily need a reservation but to be safe you should make one. The menu is mainly American with an African influence so it was a fun and tasty way to explore a new cuisine for us. I wouldn't say that it's a cheap meal but it was worth the money for us.

I'm between a 4 and a 5, but going with 5 because it was an experience I really enjoyed and I didn't speak up in the moment about the things that weren't ideal for me. \\n\\nI've honestly been waiting years to try Frasca!  I live in Denver and just had never planned the trek to Boulder to eat there, but finally a friend and I decided to do it. \\n\\nWe were lucky to find street parking on the block with no problem. The hostess, Melissa, was very friendly and remembered speaking to my friend on the phone earlier that day. The owner, Bobby, was also at the door greeting people (and stopped by our table later and was bussing tables). They asked if we were celebrating anything special which we were. We arrived a half hour early for our reservations and they were able to seat us right away. \\n\\nThe restaurant was bright and spacious. I appreciated that the tables weren't super close together like they are in a lot of restaurants. We definitely felt like we had our privacy. \\n\\nAfter we were seated, our waitress poured us a small glass of wine. She said it was the tradition at Frascas (branches above the door) in Italy to do that. It was a lovely way to start the experience. \\n\\nOur waitress went over the menu (which was marked for the special occasion... a nice touch) with us and asked if we had any dietary restrictions, which my friend did, and she said they were happy to accommodate. She came back later and said she double checked on all the ingredients so there would be nothing my friend couldn't eat. \\n\\nI told the waitress what I was looking for in a cocktail and went with her suggestion which I very much enjoyed. \\n\\nThey started with a complimentary plate of amuse bouche bites. They weren't our favorite, but still appreciated. \\n\\nThe waitress recommended the frico caldo appetizer and it was very good. The server who delivered it also said it was one of his favorites. \\n\\nMy friend decided to order a la carte but we found it interesting that the a la carte prices were not on the menu.  \\n\\nI went with the 4 course meal and said that I would order a glass of wine with my entree. Our waitress asked if I'd prefer a half glass with each course and I agreed to that. I went with her recommendations. She seemed very knowledgeable about wine and told me about what she was bringing me (without mentioning prices). \\n\\nFor the first course, I asked if she'd recommend the beets or the scallop. She recommended the scallop so I went with that. I was very surprised when it came out raw.  I don't like raw, but did force myself to give it a try since it was part of the experience. As I expected, I didn't like it. In hindsight, I should have said something and asked for something else. I would imagine a restaurant like this would have no issue with that. I did think that either the menu or waitress should have said that upfront though. Even though I did not like it, it does not reflect in my rating since I didn't speak up at the time. \\n\\nMy second and third courses were very good, although I felt like my entr√©e, the bass, was on the small side. My friend who ordered an a la carte entr√©e felt the same way about hers.  I also enjoyed my dessert.  They brought out beautiful homemade chocolates for my friend's birthday and they had unique flavors. \\n\\nI was surprised when I got the bill and my half glasses of wine were pretty expensive. I thought $16 for such a small glass was a lot. The price is maybe something that should be brought up when suggesting the glass of wine.  I guess that it was my bad for not asking. I had looked at the wine list briefly when we first sat down and saw that a lot of the glasses were around that price point. I just expected a half glass to be less. \\n\\nOn our way out, they had our coats ready for us that we gave them when we walked in. A woman working noticed that we were peeking into the kitchen and she offered to bring us in to check it out. That was very nice and not something you can do most places. \\n\\nThe raw scallops and the price of the wine we're bummers for me, but when I reflect on the whole evening, the experience was still more five stars than four stars for me.

I went twice in a week. First time was an attempt of their happy hour menu but because of Dine Out, they were not offering HH. They did honor one round of happy hour priced margaritas which was nice of them. My co-workers ordered their DOV menu and I ordered fried yuca which brought back flavors from growing up in Miami. Then I went again for their DOV excellent value for $35, as already had a reservation to check it out so preferred not to do it twice in 1 week. This time I ordered the Dark and Stormy margarita as it had a bit of spice to it versus a regular margarita. I would typically be skeptical of trout but since my co-workers all enjoyed it, started out with trout ceviche instead of tuna tartar. I have not come across too many restaurants that have ceviche as an appetizer so nice to see it being offered.  It was infused with cucumber and had a fresh lightness, great start. I think our entire table ordered it and were all pleased. Then I ordered fried chicken tacos, as I write this, really need to stop ordering fried foods as not the healthiest but had 2 slider portions but the fried chicken was very good because of that slaw and mango/papaya salsa. But anything fried, you can't really go wrong. My friend ordered the cauliflower and also enjoyed it. Then, ordered 2 butter browned shrimp on corn arepas, big size shrimp, as the value is certainly there in their DOV menu. Excellent flavors! Then finished off the evening with a pumpkin seed chocolate torte with horchata (ice cream) which was not too sweet and could appreciate it as it was a healthy dessert (that may be an oxymoron?) The consensus was everyone enjoyed all of the selections we ordered which is rare when you eat out. Would recommend it for DOV 100% and would like to go back for their regular menu and hopefully for happy hour for the tacos and margaritas, can't go wrong with that combination."},{"name":"Red Door BBQ","address":"177 S Cypress Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Stopped by today for some ribs.

Six of us went to dinner at Be Our Guest for a friend's birthday (we had pre-ordered a cake to the restaurant and alerted the restaurant in advance that we were celebrating). The dinner was a mandatory pre-fix meal of $60 (not including alcohol). First, they seated us in a side room (not in the main dining hall, the reason we chose that restaurant in the first place) even though the main room was not at capacity. Our reservation was for 9:30 and we didn't receive appetizers until over a full hour after we were seated. When our appetizers did come, it was obvious they had been sitting around for a full hour and forgotten about. Three of us ordered the steak as our entree: the BIRTHDAY girl found a human hair in her steak, and two of the other steaks were cold. We sent them all back - one came back to us 5 minutes later, the other two took over 30 minutes to be returned. The meals (protein, vegetables, everything) were salted to the degree of inedible - we wouldn't have eaten them had we not been starving by the time our food finally came. The cake we pre-ordered was chocolate with chocolate icing covered in dark chocolate - they served us a vanilla cake with vanilla frosting covered in white chocolate. To top it off, the manager \\"misplaced\\" my credit card and we had the entire restaurant staff flipping over tables and searching the floor to find it. The manager didn't admit to having \\"misplaced\\" it ever - she simply put it in a check book when she was at the table alone (four of us, including the waiter, had looked through the book to try to find it) after 25+ minutes of searching, pretending it had been there all along. I would like to note our waiter was wonderful throughout this process, but management (specifically Michelle) was absolutely horrendous - she avoided us until absolutely necessary to interact, was initially uncompromising, and \\"misplaced\\" (ahem) my debit card. We didn't leave the restaurant until almost 1:30 AM and had to cancel the party was planned for the birthday girl because of Be Our Guest's ineptitude.

No way you can't create a delicious pizza every single time for over $30 for a small? Better double check your receipt and ask questions. I didn't get an itemized receipt showing all the charges. Dog and pony show. Not cool. Did I say I missed fireworks oh and Frozen Ride. Staff outstanding and really  ok ruined things for other proper restaurants cause I won't be taking chances at Disneyworld.

But let me say a few more words about Jerry and the folks at Vino Vino.\\nWe went to VV on NYE after a somewhat disappointing meal at Asti. (That review will come next... give me a little time. Have YOU ever tried writing Yelp reviews with a 15 month-old hanging off your leg? No? Well it ain't easy so just cool your jets. I'll get to the Asti review in a bit.\\n\\nI mean, it's taken me an hour and a half just to get this far. The only reason I'm going faster now is because he's taking a nap. That gives me about 45 minutes to work something up and I'm finding it difficult to keep my train of thought now.\\n\\nDo you ever do that; get started on something with all these great ideas of what you want to say or do and then once you start on it, you forget what your point was or what you were trying to accomplish? It seems to happen to me quite often these days. Maybe it's my age.\\n\\nNot that I'm really that old. I'm 37.\\n\\nThat makes me think of that bit in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The part where Arthur is talking to Dennis. Good stuff.)\\n\\nI love wine. My wife loves wine. The last time I was at Vino Vino (see my review for the Yelp Elite event that I photographed. Yeah. That's me, the guy with the camera at the Yelp Elite events. It's the only way I can get into those gigs. Apparently, I'm not very good at writing reviews.), Jerry suggested a lovely bottle of La Vendimia for her to try. When we went in New Year's Eve, after our dinner at Asti, Jerry (most likely not remembering me, and if he did, most likely not remembering that he had suggested that bottle for my wife) suggested that she try La Vendimia. Of course, she loved it. Again. She didn't remember that it was the same bottle that I had purchased for her from the very same establishment.\\nSo anyway, we figured it out after a little bit of time sitting there and after we went to the wall and found the bottle there and realized that it was the same thing. We told Jerry and he remembered. At least he acted like he remembered.\\n\\nI like to think that he remembered. It makes the story nice.\\n\\nSo Jerry remembered me and the bottle of La Vendimia that he had suggested I buy for my wife based on my description of the types and brands of wine that she usually enjoys. And that's the point that I'm really trying to get at here.\\n\\nI love wine, and I know when I'm drinking a good wine and when I'm drinking not good wine. And I don't even have to look at the price tag to know the difference.\\n\\nBut I don't love wine the way that Jerry loves wine. I like to believe that Jerry could tell me the percentages of each ingredient in each bottle that adorns the dimly-lit walls of this intimate venue in Hyde Park. I also like to believe the world would have been just fine without another Rambo movie.\\n\\nI would love to know as much about wine as Jerry does. But I don't even have time to write reviews about wine bars, how am I ever going to learn that much about wine? OK, yeah, I could read some books and shit, and spend a little time learning about the wines I drink.\\nLook, don't be a smart-ass. This is my review.\\n\\nI go to Vino Vino, because I trust people like Jerry to make my wine-drinking experience not suck. That's it. And that's what they do at Vino Vino; give you a not-sucky wine-drinking experience.\\n\\nBack to my story... We asked Jerry to suggest a bottle of wine based on what we had sampled that evening (and previously via his previous suggestion) and Jerry came back to the table with three wines. He described each one in succinct wine-loving-but-not-wine-snobby detail and we picked one to take home with us. We haven't opened that bottle yet, Jerry. But as soon as we do, we'll let you know what we think.\\n\\nAlright, well, the boy is awake again, so I better stop now."},{"name":"World Foods","address":"830 NW Everett St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Discovered this store at the end of their wine tasting event and I made it clear that I'm not a wine person or had any desire to purchase any wine, but the person in charge of the wine section was more than welcoming. It wasn't an awkward moment where you had to pretend to buy the product for them to give you a sample, almost pushing it. I didn't have to pay and I got a very generous glass per wine. I wanted to buy a bottle because they were just so nice. \\n\\nI am in love with their sister store. I had the chicken shawarma sandwich here twice and the first time it tasted just like the sister store. The second time, there was so much pickled veggies in it and I questioned whether or not I ordered it wrong. Without a doubt I was rocking the sauce from the sandwich on my shirt all day and I didn't even mind. \\n\\nTheres a good deli section. I've eaten other things from here in the pre made section but all I can recall is the chicken shawarma sandwich and the spinach pie. The cafe section also has some really tasty looking sweets that I know I've tried, but at the end of the day I'm dreaming about the chicken shawarma sandwich. MMMM can't wait to go get a sandwich now! \\n\\nThe store isn't massive, but it offers so many different things you can't find in your local markets, offering more of an ethnic variety. Everything is super fresh! There's a huge beer section relative to the store. Thinking about it, the store has big selections of the things they do have. You want chips? Here is 30 different varieties other than Lays. You want chocolate? Here is 40 different brands besides Hershey. They offer a more unique shopping experience.\\n\\nI had the pleasure of meeting the owner and his wife. Both were very very friendly and kind.

It had lots of fresh green lettuce (none of that crappy iceburg), cherry tomatoes (yuck), tons of feta, calamatas and loads of dilled cucumbers and onions.  My only complaint here was the gallon of greek dressing they put on meant that when you reached the bottom of your bowl there was a small oily lake with a coupla lettuce islands floatin around.  \\n\\nNow the pizza....I'd say it's not my fave.  It's a little off putting to see all that tomato sauce on top of the pie.  It's not pretty, but after a few beers, I wouldn't kick it outta my bed for sheddin crumbs, ya know what I'm sayin?  Alot of our pizzas weren't labelled but the one I had I believe was all meat and cheese.  Don't let the outside fool you, there's a ton of cheese in the middle along with pepperoni and sausage.

The previous bar/restaurant was fine- much of what you would expect in a three star hotel on the outskirts of town- pricey bar food and easy access to the usual cache of middle-shelf liquors.\\n\\nThen Two Brother opened. I'll be honest, I wasn't waiting on bated breath for this place to open. I didn't count the days down on my calendar until the next conference here hoping and praying that the place would finally be fully renovated and ready to serve. Heck, I forgot it was even happening. After all, it is just the hotel restaurant/bar. As I clambered out of one of the meetings and headed for a much needed bourbon pick-me-up, I was expecting the same 'ol, same 'ol- just with newer flashier fixtures.\\n\\nAs I approached the bar, one of my colleagues handed me a glass of what appeared to be the sweet, dark liquor nectar of the Gods (bourbon, of course.) As I sipped, I was taken aback by the surprising subtle apple pie flavor infused through what was undeniably Woodford Reserve. Now I stay pretty up on the bourbon scene and I was pretty sure that Woodford hadn't release anything new resembling this delightful taste of fall in a glass I was holding. I glance up at the bar to see a 'stached barkeep in a canvas and denim apron tending to an infusion tower like I hadn't seen previously. Before my eyes, I was watching precious Woodford slowly trickle through a glass catchment filled with Granny Smith apples and cinnamon sticks. Now tell me the last time you saw anything close to that at a hotel bar.\\n\\nAs I sipped away at this fall-flavored libation, I glanced further to the glass shelves behind the bar. Yes, the typical Beam and Daniels were there along with familiar gins, rums and vodkas (taking up precious shelf space from the whiskeys). But what to my wondering eyes should appear, but Angel's Envy Rum-finished Rye, Weller's and Knob Creek limited editions. I rubbed my eye's furiously to make sure I wasn't hallucinating or dreaming. Nope. There they were... REAL bourbons and whiskeys-a-plenty on those glass shelves. The ones that bourbon fiends stand in line in the cold for hours in from of the lucky OHLQ stores lucky enough to receive the lottery load of these limited edition gems. Here they were, all neatly assembled on a couple of shelves at the back of this, this, this hotel bar... in Columbus, Ohio! Not New Orleans or San Franscisco. Columbus! Now, bear in mind, those glasses of prized oak-aged corn nectar are going to cost you- it is a hotel bar after all. For some of the premium bottle, the glass price approached 1/3 to 1/2 of the bottle's retail price. But, you didn't have to stand in line for hours in the cold only to be let down that the guy in front of you bought the last bottle. You just need to figure out a creative way to expense the bar tab.\\n\\nAdding to my delight was a large variety of locally distilled gems and craft brews. It was almost too much to chose from. Almost. Nobody said a word as I carried a few glasses back into the meetings with me that evening. Best meetings we have had there is a real long time, or at least so I remember.\\n\\nThe barkeeps, in their rugged aprons were pleasant and knowledgeable. The bar food is somewhat creative, typically overpriced as most things are in hotels, but flavorful. The portions are a bit too small to truly make this your meal destination without dropping a few bills, but as a pre-dinner or late night snack, it suffices well. Overall the place is certainly an upgrade to the previous digs. Looking forward to see what those shelves will hold on my next trip north."},{"name":"Neverland Tea Salon","address":"3066 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"My best friend and I came for the holiday afternoon tea.

We three ladies enjoyed a luxuriously long luncheon on a rainy Friday afternoon.\\n\\nI cannot say enough about the BEAUTIFUL space that Urban Farmer occupies.  I am a fan of The Nines Hotel and this space is just very cool in so many ways.  The intimate \\"cubbies\\"  with 4 overstuffed chairs and cocktail table, perfect for drinks and appetizers - The seperate Bar area is quiet and intimate.  My favorite place to sit is in the \\"couch\\" area - these are tables for 6 that have 2 cowhide and leather covered sofa's facing each other - very cozy and comfortable - a great place to linger over a fine meal.\\n\\nThe server took note of our special occasion, made sure we had flowers on the table and brought out a complimentary dessert (the Banana Cream Pie - to die for!!).  Our lunch was, hands down, one of the best - most unique meals we had ever had.  The menu was creative and interesting - it took us over 30 minutes and one cocktail to decide what to order. My meal began with the Artisanal Cheese Plate (shared), then the iceberg waldorf salad with grilled prawns and walnut croutons - my entree was spice grilled Hawaiian tuna over grilled romaine with the most amazing collection of delicious items (deviled egg, grapefruit sections, pinenuts...).  The meal was SUPERB.  The meal was VERY PRICEY - we did not have wine with lunch either!!  I won't hesitate to experience lunch again.\\n\\nSoooooo, let's discuss last nights dinner - My hubby and I joined 2 other couples that have been to UF before and rave about it.  Our group of 6 frequently enjoys fine meals at some of the best restaurants in the Portland Metro area.  For us, last night was not one of the finer moments.  I can honestly say that I will not return for dinner ever again.  I want to experience happy hour - the space is beautiful at night and the menu is less expensive.\\n\\nNow for the meal - we tried the New York Steak tasting menu with the Waygu option ($90) - this is something you share with another person (24 oz's of meat!) - grass fed, corn fed, dry aged and waygu on the same plate for a side by side comparison.  I recommend anyone who really likes a good steak to try this once - it is a real eye opener and palette pleaser.  The starch options are terrific:  The grits and mac n cheese were easily the favorites.  The roasted beets were terrific, but the other veggie options were heavy with pork fat and salt and just tasted heavy -  The starters and the salad selection are heavy options - reading the descriptions gave me angina.  I enjoy a good fresh salad and a fresh well seasoned veg with my meals - but the only options here are HEAVY, HEAVY and more HEAVY.\\n\\nThe rating I gave the dinner is not entirely due to the menu - we did not have great service.  The first table they tried to seat us at was not the table we reserved and we had to wait another 10 mins while they prepped the correct table.  Once seated, several servers came over to greet us and there seemed to be some confusion as to who was going to take care of us - Finally our orders were taken and our meal began, but as the night wore on the service did not improve - at one point all of our (very expensive) meat and sides were on the table but we did not have any \\"sharing plates\\" - our server commented twice that we needed plates but never brought them - I had to ask a passing server to get some for us.   Our meal was good - not great - just good and we wanted to order the chocolate souffle for dessert but by the time our server came over to ask about dessert - they had run out of it.  Needless to say we did not have dessert or coffee.  Our tab was close to $800 with tip and we did not have wine and one person did not have any alcohol at all (me) - I was the driver.

Casual atmosphere, lots of food choices and friendly staff. As Disney buffets go, this is one of the better ones with choices like Pap and mulligatawny soup (delicious), offering both African and South Indian dishes as well as American options. The chutneys are amazing and I'm partial to the coconut basmati rice (full of sweet flavor and not overcooked). But it's really pricey for an adult (it's over $45) and children are $27. My 8 year old ate chicken tenders and two cupcakes so I KNOW he didn't eat $27 worth of food. The desserts look yummy but are a little too sweet for my taste (the cherry cobbler granola topping is delicious but the pie filling itself is overly sweet).  They offer 5 soup choices but I tried two, the lentil and mulligatawny which were flavorful and not too salty.

Probably better for cocktails with friends than a double date that we were there for. An eclectic menu with some clearly Asian inspired dishes and a good cocktail list. Most things are tapas to-be-shared style with the exception of a few large dishes, but probably should share those too. For reference, between the 4 of us, we had oysters, 4 small plates and 1 large plate.\\n\\nOYSTERS: Fresh and nicely shucked. They make their own sauces which has fun combinations. The selection is not as wide as some more seafood focused restaurants. \\n\\nBLUE CRAB AND PICKLED PUMPKIN SALAD: Actually the salad turned out to be one of my favorite dishes of the night. A nice combination of tastes and textures between the salad, faro, apples, radish.

Haha.\\n\\nPORK AND CRAB SOUP DUMPLINGS: A respectable try on replicating the xiao long bao but of course it doesn't come near real Asian places such as Ding Tai Fung. The improvements could be thinner skin, more soup, and heavier crab flavor.\\n\\nITALIAN SAUSAGE PIZZA: Very thin Neopolitan style crust, topped with Italian sausage, baked potato, fried shallots, taleggio cream, sage. I found this mix a little too heavy for my taste.\\n\\nCREEKSTONE RIBEYE STEAK: I can't remember how many ounces the steak was, but it definitely was not that big for $62. Tasted decent and cooked to order.\\n\\nOverall, to be honest the food is actually decent. Everything is technically executed well. However nothing really stood out as overwhelmingly good.

Thank Goodness, the hostess had  just gotten off of the phone with someone canceling their reservation so we were able to score the absolute reservation for that evening! Even though the late reservation made for a long day at the park the wait was completely worth it. The story of Beauty and The Beast was brought to life before our eyes.  The service was absolutely impeccable and the theatrics of it all pull us even further into the scene. The details were everything from the rose folded napkin to my nieces name being one of the words they placed in the crossword puzzle of her children's menu. After being seated and being entranced by how grand Be Our Guest was my niece in the most child like way stated \\"I the princess, OK!\\" When the waitress arrived she immediately greeted my niece, \\"Hello princess!\\"  The look of joy on her face and feeling she had is something no amount of money could pay for. When I asked the sever what she could recommend her answer was \\"My master (The Beast) prefers the steak.\\" Every so often The Beast walked through the main dining room to go to and from his study and the servers would stop whatever they were doing to announce \\"my master is coming,\\" and then they'd bow & everyone clapped, cheered & took pictures. For dinner we ordered the grilled  steak with seasonal vegetables and pomme frites, the rotisserie cornish hen with roasted fingerling potatoes and seasonal vegetables, the layered ratatouille with quinoa and the pan seared salmon with leek fondue on saffron crushed potatoes. We all ate off of each others plate because we wanted to taste everything. The food was a full belly, clean plates, hands down, two thumb up, five stars delicious & we still couldn't deny ourselves of the sweet gourmet cupcakes & cream puffs for desserts on the cart that our server wheeled over to us! After dessert we were told that the master would be retiring for the evening soon but if we'd like he was still taking guest in his study for a while longer. In meeting The Beast, I actually became a little emotional but my boyfriend broke the moment by saying \\"What's up Beast, give me pound\\" and then he and Beast actually bumped fist.

In a bad way, not a good way. She recited a soliloquy about both the menu and drink menu. She bombarded us with information we didn't ask for nor did we require. A simple 'let me know if you have any questions' would have sufficed. She proceeded to tell us everything and anything about all the dishes-its a pretty decent sized menu, about what was the most popular and whether she agreed or not AND which dishes she liked best. Then she did it for the drink menu as well....I think I've drank before....and I can easily read and understand the descriptions that explain the ingredients in each one. She professed herself to be a FOODIE....OUCH. And then pronounced ceviche wrong SEVERAL times. It was just embarrassing. Then we had to listen to it ALL OVER AGAIN when she seated another table near us 10 minutes later!\\nAn El Jimador cocktail is $10. Enough said. I can buy a whole bottle for $30.

The price did not meet the quality and taste of other restaurants in the city or other cities in Canada for that matter. \\nThe protests I can do without. Gentrification this is not. Leasing a space and opening a small business and CONTRIBUTING to the economy and neighborhood in a positive way is not doing anything wrong. Contact your local MLA and Government to protest zoning laws and housing issues. This is not an issue of an entrepreneur. The owners are simply opportunists following a system and city that has flaws. I support local business 100% and I wish Cuchillo well regardless of our experience. I just hope they dial it in.

It definitely took awhile and we started to question why no one had helped us yet. Eventually a gentleman came over and took our drink orders. Most of us wanted water, the kids wanted soda and my brother-in-law got a beer. Again....after a LONG time (keep in mind, with two post-full marathoners without anything to drink) a girl brought out the beer while the rest of us sat there confused on why that came out first and not the waters. Soon after, the guy who took our drink orders told us that he was sorry, but got \\"caught up in a conversation and forgot about us.\\" He then frantically told us that another server would be taking care of us and he introduced her to us.

After awhile, the kids started getting cranky so we walked around outside while the guys at our table stayed in. Again, we were outside for probably 30 mins! My sister even looked at her phone and based on the time she sent a particular text, we could tell we had waited about 50 mins for our food to finally come out! I could even tell by walking near the kitchen that they seemed super short staffed. Also, there were a bunch of dirty tables near us that didn't get cleaned up until we were leaving. \\n\\nI got the burger and fries and it was good. I have a love/hate relationship with the garlic they put on there. It's a little too much at times, but it does add a special kick!

Folks.....I've been eating at Sabrozon for a few years now. I was eating there so often I took a break for about the last 8 or 9 months. \\n\\nI went back with a friend about 4 months ago for dinner and dang....I thought I was in the twilight zone. The salsas which were my favorite in the past had absolutely no flavor. When I tell you that my enchilada platter came out literally two minutes after I ordered it, I'm not exaggerating. It was apparent that it had been microwaved. WTH. I chalked it up to a bad night and didn't read much more into it. \\n\\nMy son wanted to take me out to lunch today and I suggested that we try again figuring my last experience was a fluke. But I'm a slow learner. We walked in at 12:30 which I figured would be packed as was my past experience. One man sitting alone....uh oh. \\n\\nWe were seated and I didn't recognize either of the two young servers. It was obvious the young girl serving us was new. She brought out the chips with, seriously, one handful of chips in the basket. Both the salsa and the avocado salsa were watered down and were all liquid. WTH. We were starving so we ate it. When she brought more salsa, she spilled it all over my purse. Moments later the food came. My son did like his quesadilla but it's pretty hard to screw up a quesadilla. \\n\\nI had the two item combo which WAS my old standby. Cheese enchilada with mole sauce and a shredded beef hard taco. Two bites into the taco and I realized the meat had no flavor. The freaking meat (machaca) had no seasoning whatsoever. It was as bland as boiled beef. I left it. It was clear, just from looking at the enchilada that it wasn't fresh. It was reheated. I took one bite....the second bite I spit out into a napkin. It took forever to flag one of the two girls over to get the check. \\n\\nI NEVER write reviews and I'm not a food snob. I'll pretty much eat anything. I've never had worse Mexican food. I have no idea what's going on over there but I'll never go back. Maybe they're just focusing on their catering business and the restaurant is something they don't care about. I've told so, so many folks to go here that I feel badly. \\n\\nSo why did I decide to write this....the culmination of this lunch was me grabbing a bag in my car and getting sick when we left. \\n\\nConsider yourselves forewarned."},{"name":"Mellow Mushroom Orlando","address":"11680 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I had an amazing waiter and the best experience!

So say they mark that up by 4x for retail. That would work out to $18.45 a drink (1.5oz pour - these were also not big drinks) - reasonable. 52% less than the $28 they charged me. Plus, just like, I drink a lot (sorry mom) and I never notice the bill. I noticed it here.\\n\\nOk then the whiskey. Ordered Johnny black. Nope. How about you try the the mccallan 12 sir. Ok cool. $56 a bottle. At $27 a glass - what they charged - that's $456 a bottle. Am I at the club? Did you bring it to me with sparklers? I don't see Hardwell on the ones and twos.

On my to one such restaurant (which I never did find, due to the plethora of Peachtree streets, many of which seem to be adjacent to each other) I stumbled upon La Tagliatella and was impressed by the look of the place and the menu options. Though pricy, I was sold by the fact that they make their own pasta--I love fresh, home made pasta and since it is hard to find done well, I put my trust in La Tagliatella.  The gnocchi with bolognase was delicious!  Though our server explained the menu's concept of family-style eating and plate sharing, portions were not so large as to need to share.  And there weren't tapas-type small plates to share, either, so I ordered the pasta dish and my husband ordered soup.  They only have one soup option, which DH said was delicious which was confirmed by the 48 seconds it took for him to inhale the whole bowl (which was plated very nicely: served in a covered crock which added to the elegance that the decor hints at as well).  Our server, Graciela, was as sweet as can be and she seemed to enjoy helping us navigate the overwhelming number of food options, especially since the pages of the pasta section asks you to choose a pasta style and a sauce, so pairings can be difficult to do well if you are not familiar with the kinds of sauces that particular pasta shapes work best with.  My entire education in this area comes from a few  attempts to make fresh pasta on my own, after having taken a class at a local cooking school, so I'm not working with a full deck of knowledge.  Then, as I lament my pasta pairing dilemma to Graciela, she taps on her little electronic pad/box/ordering machine/thingy and it spits back suggested pasta and sauce pairings.  Voila! I order gnocchi with bolognase and DH follows his tasty soup with a pizza.  We could have shared either one of our dishes and been fine.  As it was, we brought back to the hotel two full take-away tins of leftovers of about a third of the pizza, half of the half order of foccacio bread sticks, and a few tablespoons of the most wonderful gnocchi I have had in a long time.  They were creamy, tasty, firm yet fluffy pillows, just like they are supposed to taste.  The sauce was fine--tasty, hearty and matched well with the heavier pasta I chose.  I had a lovely cocktail, a limon something, that was refreshing, light and flavorful with just the right amount of gin in it.  Due to the elctronic pad thingy that allowed Graciela to order our meal while she contiued conversing with us, our food was delivered moments after she left us to attend to another table.  Brilliant!  The server does not have to go to a station to punch in an order, or heaven forbid, have to write a dinner check manually to then to be handed to the kitchen.  Since Graciela had warned us that our pasta dish takes only 3 minutes to cook, and the pizza only about 8 minutes, we should be ready for our meal soon, and, sure enough, she was spot on! Speaking of Graciela, she was a dear.  She was patient and eager to help us have a great dining experience.  It was during her explanation of the corporate philosophy of an Italian living in Spain who could find no good Italian food in Spain so he trained in Italy to cook Italian food in Spain and then he built that business throughout Europe and now is expanding to the US, with their first flagship store in Atlanta.  I must have been told by three different staff members that they have plans to open 30 more La Tagliatellas in the US next year. They offer only a slightly different concept from Maggiano's so I offer them lots of luck.  From the time I spent in Atlanta, this seemed to be a good choice to open their first US experiment because the people are so nice!  I would return, and if one pops up in Chicago, I may well be their first customer."},{"name":"Frasca Food and Wine","address":"1738 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"A highly-anticipated dinner at Frasca didn't pan out exactly as we had hoped, but it's fine.\\n\\nFour of us showed up a little early for our reservation, but they gladly seated us within minutes of our arrival.

Texture, sweet, salty... they all worked perfectly.\\n\\nThe Pumpkin soup was also a big hit. It was creamy and flavorful, and we all finished it in seconds.\\n\\nThe Yukon potato/Soffritto/Chicken Jus was okay; it didn't excite our palates as the first three dishes did, but it wasn't bad either.\\n\\nWe were all pretty disappointed with the Risotto, as the tomato flavor overwhelmed everything in the dish.

It was cooked beautifully, but what can I say... I'm a fat eater.\\n\\nFinally, the Apple and Vanilla dessert was good, but not outstanding. It was a decent way to end the meal, but we were left longing for more in the dessert.\\n\\nAt its price point, the food deserved 3 stars in my opinion; it had some hits, but it had its misses.

With all the events going on in the area I was a little taken back so see this restaurant nearly empty at 7:00 PM, but dismissed this since there are an abundance of options in the immediately area and it was a week night, so it wasn't surprising to see our table was waiting as were most of the restaurant's staff. I'm not sure of the exact size of our party but I'd say there were between twelve and fifteen with most arriving in smaller groups so the servers started casually taking drink orders until the entire group was seated. I ordered my usual martini to start some ordered beer and there were a few bottles of wine scattered across the table for all to enjoy. The host seemed quite surprised when the single page menus arrived and most all the selections were Italian, I was seated next to him and he commented the last time they dined here it was more of a Steak House he grabbed one of the servers assigned to our party and discretely questioned the options, she was quick to point out that the restaurant changed over to a more Italian menu just the day before. He accepted the answer with some disappointment, and addressed our group by saying \\"everyone it looks like we having Italian tonight\\" and as always handled the disappointment with the utmost professional courtesy not to dampen the evening. Having reviewed the selections several times over my sub-par Martini and primed for a nice steak I decided to go with the 12 oz. ribeye medium rare with grilled asparagus and vegetables. I was hoping to hear the server say \\"nice choice\\" or something positive but the blank look on his face seemed to be precursor to the disappointment that was to come. \\n\\nMartini -  I first want to say without going into too much detail I completely understand the art of ordering a great martini but my server apparent knew that no matter how I described this cocktail the bar wasn't going to be able to deliver. After a few minutes my martini arrived in a warm junior size martini glass poured short with two badly bruised olives stuffed with pimento and not the least bit dirty, it wasn't much better than drinking leaded gasoline. \\n\\nAppetizers - I looked but did not par-take and opted for a slice of room temperature bread, instead of the Margherita flat bread pizza, calamari and something else less impressive.\\n\\nRibeye Steak - At first glance I was hoping it was \\"Pittsburgh Rare\\" but from the look of the char and the thickness I knew it was mathematically impossible to cook this steak anyway but well done, the time and temperature equation just doesn't work especially if you add in the pressure of a brick pressing it to the grill surface, the end result is the same no matter how many times you experiment. \\n\\nGrill Asparagus and Vegetables - I was hoping to get some nutrition from this meal, but wasn't surprised to find the asparagus fibrous and tough and completely without flavor, the bland vegetables seem to equal the lack of creativity from the kitchen.\\n\\nBeing a relatively optimistic person I tried to justify and analysis the problem here, maybe the staff was struggling with the menu change or maybe it was a completely new kitchen staff and the training was a work in progress, at the end of the day no matter the excuses one could conjure up it's not worth the risk of a second try for me. I'm forced to give a thumbs down to this one."},{"name":"Continental Seafood Restaurant","address":"11700 Cambie Road, Suite 150","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"First off heard great things from this place so we decided to go for our first time in Canada.

It's hard to know where to start with this, as just about every place does dandan mian differently, sometimes markedly so. So while I usually prefer soupier dandan mian, I can let that slide given the multitude of less soupy variants of this dish. However, I do feel this was missing something. I don't usually need my dandan mian to be especially spicy, but this one was too mild I think, and was missing the slight kick it needed. Perhaps it could also have been heavier on the sesame paste, sesame oil, or the vinegar? For sure, those who prefer less vinegar in their dandan mian would appreciate it more. As it was in the end, this was ok, but not my favourite. The xiao long bao (Â∞èÁ±†ÔøΩ? was better. The pork filling was juicy and tender, with a generous amount of soup present in the dumpling. Its only flaw was that the wrapping was a tad thicker than it needed to be (I still prefer Dinesty's but I'd order this again). Finally, the service was somewhat lacklustre. The staff, while not rude or unfriendly per se, seemed highly unenthused. Furthermore, they have a fair number of servers working the floor for such a small place, yet no one noticed something as simple as our teacups needing a refill for far too long. Overall, given the limited range of dishes I tried, I'd be fine trying Peaceful again, perhaps at a different location and probably ordering something else.

It's thin, flavorful, light and very filling, but not so much that you'll feel bloated and not want to continue walking the park afterwards. \\nThe price point is a little high, (about $20 for an individual pizza) but it's worth every penny.  It is not a quick service restaurant, it is a sit down restaurant.  If you are able to make a reservation I highly recommend it.  However, once sitting down the service is fast and very pleasant.  In my opinion Italy has the best hospitality of all of the world showcases in Epcot.  It is my favorite sit down place in Epcot, I highly recommend the pizza to anyone who is a pizza lover like me.  Delicious!"},{"name":"Zyka","address":"1677 Scott Blvd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"AMBIENCE:\\n\\nSolid Solid food! Watch out Bhojanic, you've got competition. Zyka, The Taste, blew my socks off. That's kinda hard to do considering that 1. I DETEST ordering my food first, and then going to sit down and then having to walk back to my table with a lunch tray like I'm in some overcrowded Public School cafeteria. WTF, am I back in Bushwick? \\n\\nThat aside (which was a lot for me to get over) the food is GREAT. Meals some with a yogurt based Raita type sauce, and a Tamarind sauce. Surely beats having to pay $2 for a tiny dipping tray size of it at Bhojanic. I loved the Chicken 65-- it's like chopped up friend Tandoori Chicken. Yep, that's what it's like for me. \\n\\nI must say, I really really didn't like their Samosas. I don't know what all they have in there, but it's too much going on. Maybe I've never had a Pakistani samosa before but I prefer mine with just aloo and peas, not corn, and all this other stuff. I was like what is all dis??? Did not like the taste at all at all. \\n\\n\\nPRICING:\\n\\nThe nan is good, the chutney is delish, saffron rice, and bindi were excellent. It's really not THAT cheap as everyone says considering you don't get waiter service, and you have to order everything a la carte. If you want a mixture of veggies and protein with a carb, that's THREE things you have to pay for. Granted the rice is like $3, you'd have to pay for two full entrees to get a meat and veggie. That's stupid, not cost effective, and simply too much food. Best if you're going with someone so that you all can share. \\n\\nDESSERT:\\n\\nTry the CHIKOO Kulfi for dessert. in Trinidad we call Chikoo SAPODILLA (in case you were all wondering WTF a Chikoo was, like I did!!!) Mango lassi was very little bit (especially since they add ice to give you less) for the price. It's like a high dollar Chick Fil A of Paki food, but the food is damn good.

I'm writing this review to raise my concern about workplace ethics. Happy Lamb is pretty infamous amongst other restaurants for an unacceptable management team, but I had to find this out the hard way.\\n\\nThis pale, round-faced girl with brown hair (name Krystal) started following me around everywhere. She would occasionally raise her voice and demand things to be done. This was my first day of training, so of course I would make mistakes. Then she would get furious and yell at me. Deem that I'm incompetent so she would end up lecturing me for probably half of the 5-hour shift. This was a new level of micromanagement. Also hindered my opportunity to learn. A lot of the things she was telling me was common sense, which implied to me that she didn't have any. I dreaded for each and every one of my shifts.\\n\\nThere was another hostess (name Kim) who was way worse than Krystal. An extremely disrespectful human being. She would stand right next to the customer's table (completely in my way), then yell at me in front of the customers for not asking to her move. Completely ridiculous. Absolutely humiliating and frustrating. She would follow me around and lecture me, not even doing her job as a hostess. Not marking the table numbers on the paper. Customers would stare at her yelling at me. She would then follow me to the kitchen and proceed to yell at me. This was my first time meeting her! Both Krystal and Kim would be extremely approachable and flirty with other Chinese workers, but they would never act that way to anyone else. There were other Thai waitresses, whom they usually ignored. I was the only Japanese American working there, and they would constantly follow me around and treat me like sh*t.\\n\\nI tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, that they probably do not know how to communicate respectfully because their English isn't so great. When I was leaving the restaurant, I raised this concern to the owner, Eason, who told me that those things never happened. He did not even try to lend an ear; right off the bat, he completely denied that those incidents happened. Check the cameras-- they happened! The management here is ridiculous. The male workers are pretty chill, but it's ridiculous that the mentioned workers are in charge of the restaurant."},{"name":"Cheeseburger Bobby's","address":"5975 Roswell Rd","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4","text":"After several return visits, I have to bump up this review to 5 stars because this Cheeseburger Bobby's location is the bomb. \\n\\nREWARDS\\nThe check-in offer is crazy: free cheeseburger with purchase of fries and a drink (unlimited uses!)?

They do a pretty good job of avoiding the usual greasy-noodle-and-salty-sweet-stir-fry paradigm of Portland Chinese food..  They have a dry sauteed green bean dish that is the closest thing I have found to real Chinese here (yeah, I have been to China, the food is WAY better there).  Their Kung Pao is pretty decent.  They have a super veggie with tofu that's medocore, but still blows the pants off the MSG laden crap that is usually passed off as Chinese here.  With 100+ choices on the menu, I have not even scratch the surface of what they have to offer, but the fact that they can get kung pao and green beans right makes me curious to try for more.  Thank god I am finally finding some decent Chinese food here in Portland. Most of the Chinese I have sampled in this town is pure crap (similar to PF Changs and worse).  \\n\\nI may up my rating to 4 star once I try more (if the Green Beans are any indication of what is to come).\\n\\nOh, and avoid the Saigon Style Rice Noodles.

My first and last time at Potbelly. By the end of the 20 minute (!) ordeal of ordering a sandwich to-go, I was literally looking around to see if maybe this was being filmed for some kind of prank show or something. Alas, it was real.  Another customer who came in at the tail end of my fiasco left with his to-go order after me and actually stopped by my car to knock on my window and ask if I'd \\"had trouble in there\\" as well. He wanted to call to complain. I'd already asked for the manager's number, and received a card from the shop. Unfortunately for us, the number for the \\"General Manager\\" rings right back to the shop and was answered by the employees who just gave us the poor service. If Mr. Porcello had cared enough about the status of his restaurant to have his actual contact phone number on the card, I would have given him the play-by-play. Instead, here's what you fellow diners need to know:\\n\\n* Service was insanely slow in spite of there only being one customer ahead of me in the 20 minutes I was waiting there at the counter.\\n* One employee was rude, unhelpful, and grumpy. He intentionally ignored customers. A second was apologetic but ineffective. A third made a cameo appearance at the end, but did not offer any assistance. \\n* An employee confided that one of the toppings \\"looked good\\" today, but had \\"looked awful\\" yesterday and often.\\n* An employee didn't put an adequate amount of sauce on a sandwich because the bottle was empty. When the customer came back to the counter to ask for more, the employee left in the middle of making another customer's food to get some more from the back. The other employees did nothing.\\n* No sign of gloves, two employees were not wearing hats.\\n* An order of mac & cheese had to be refunded after the warming vat where it is kept (a container inside a larger container that's filled with warm water, apparently) had a fail of some sort allowing the warming water into the mac & cheese and leaving it \\"disgusting\\" according to one employee.\\n* Although this is a move-down-the-counter sort of place a la Freebirds or Subway or Salata, here at Potbelly *you cannot actually see them working on your food*. They have stacked shelving so high that you can only really see their heads at the food prep part where they are adding toppings. Very disconcerting if you are used to the transparent model. (Maybe how they get away with toppings that \\"look awful\\" on some days??)\\n* No employees ever went near the dining area for cleaning or other purpose even though several people left during the time I was waiting.\\n* I came in for a  1/2 sandwich and cup of mac & cheese special they had advertised in the window. Just wanted it how they come, no fancy ordering or anything. After a comedic amount of mistakes and delays that there is not space here to elaborate on but boil down to poor customer service, I left 20 minutes later with a full sandwich (not the one I wanted), no mac & cheese. I felt too squeamish for the sandwich by then anyway.\\n\\nMy free advice: at the other end of the strip center is the always fresh and clean and friendly Salata.

Every time I've driven by, there's a line outside so we knew we'd need reservations or at least go early to get on the waiting list since we had a large group. We called and emailed early in the week to inquire about making a reservation for 8-10 people and was told to come in one hour before we wanted to be seated to put our name on the waiting list... So that's what we did, and despite some frustrating mutual confusion over what was told to us online vs at the door, we were all eventually seated and on with our meal.\\n\\nFood overall was wonderful.  The menu had lots of options from North and South Vietnam, everything was beautifully plated, came with lots of fresh veggies ( maybe a 1: 3 ratio of meat to basil /shiso ... Tons of greens!) and portion size was decent.  One plate would be enough to be a meal for one person, or one plate could be shareable with a decent portion size for 3-4 people to taste if you order a few different items.  Our group decided to order 2 sets of 4 dishes to share since the narrow table made it hard to share or even fit more than a few dishes on it at a time.  Our group ended up ordering the garlic beef over spinach salad, tumeric and dill cod, vegetarian Vietnamese crepe, and pork spring rolls.  I thought the cooking execution was on point, the flavors were really good, textures were varied in a good way, dipping sauces were flavorful and helped add depth and substance to each dish, ingredients were fresh, and overall everything tasted pleasantly authentic.  I was surprised that a vegetarian crepe would taste so good as it was mainly filled with bean sprouts and some tofu - still can't figure out what made the crepe so crispy and taste so good, but I wouldn't mind trying the meat version next time if shared.\\n\\nSeating:  There are a decent amount of tables, but options for large groups are limited due to the small size and set up of the restaurant.  We were all squished into a long booth table which meant everyone had to get out if someone on the inside needed to use the bathroom, etc.  The end seat I had was strangely angled into a small diagonal space, which ended up hurting my back for days afterwards as it made me have to sit twisted in order to eat off my plate.  Smaller parties will not have to worry about this.  \\n\\nPrice point is on the more expensive side.  Expect to pay an average of $18-20 a plate give or take.  Split between 4 people, we were able to try 3 mains and 1 appetizer for about $22 including tip (tip is included in large parties).   Because of this, I think going with a group of 3-4 is ideal to keep cost down and more variety to try"},{"name":"Rossetti Restaurant","address":"47 Sutton St","city":"Lynn","stars":"4.5","text":"Simply put it's one of our favorite restaurants of all time!

We planned to celebrate our new marriage in a restaurant that resides in the part of the city we lived in. We clearly chose the wrong place. You ruined this night for us. \\n\\nMy review from 12/15/2018:\\nWe were treated very poorly here during our dinner last night. I made reservations a few days ago and we arrived early to sit at the bar for a few drinks. The hostess told us that she could seat us right away which we thought was great. She seated us at the worst table in the entire restaurant, at a table for two in between two very large parties. We let it go because we didn't want to complain since we were being seated early. (I just expected a better table after placing reservation days in advance)\\n\\nOur server took a very long time to arrive, which was fine as well. When he came to our table it was very clear to us that he wanted to rush us out and move us along so that he could turn over the table again. He immediately asked us for our drinks and orders. \\n\\nUp to this point, honestly, we would have been OK and let it all go. Once our appetizers arrived, that's when the service we received became atrocious. Our food came out as we were still eating our appetizers. The server (I think he was a runner) took away the plates we were eating from and we felt like we were being told to move along with our food. My husband's clam bake came out scalding hot to the point it was still boiling. My food was cold. My husband couldn't touch his food for at least 20 minutes. In this time, both of the large parties had left and the rush had died down. Because of this, we never saw our waiter as he was no longer trying to rush us out. When he came back, we remarked about how our food had come out incredibly fast, that we weren't done with our appetizers and that my husband's food was untouchable...his response was \\"OK.\\" and he walked away. When he came back again, he noticed that AGAIN we hadn't touched our food. He then told us he would talk to his manager. They offered to take off one appetizer from our bill but never came over to talk to us to see why we were upset. \\n\\nWhile we were waiting for the bill, the woman who was busing tables accidentally SPRAYED my husband in the back with her spray bottle.\\n\\nI am, honestly, floored at the way we were treated.

I was excited to find yet another Ethiopian restaurant in the Boston area I had not previously visited. I certainly enjoyed it. I'd definitely come here again. But this restaurant is among stiff competition when it comes to Ethiopian restaurants I like in the area in general.\\n\\nI loved the atmosphere here, just very friendly and casual. It was fun watching the Ethiopian music videos on the big-screen TV. The menu items are just unique and different enough to make it interesting. If you like chicken, your choices are pretty much limited to Doro Wat, and the egg is closer to hard-boiled than soft-boiled. The lamb and vegetable dishes are pretty typical. The menu options that were the most interesting were those of beef. Here, a number of beef entrees (and maybe some lamb ones too? I forget) are grilled. These bring a different taste and texture to your plate. \\n\\nThey also have fish on the menu, and I believe this may be the only Ethiopian restaurant in the Boston area to have fish as a regular menu item. I've had it as a daily special at other local restaurants. At these, you still had to work with your hands - through the scales and bones - to get the meat - but let me tell you, it was delicious. Actually, we didn't order fish here, and I saw no comments about it in other reviews, but I would hope it would be just as good here as elsewhere, and I hope I'll see reviews on their fish dishes in the future. \\n\\nThey were, unfortunately, a bit casual in the amount of liquid in the menu items as they put them on the injera, which made it soggy and much less usable. But they brought us more injera without being asked, so all was good.\\n\\nWe started our meal with a bottle of honey wine. This seemed a little bit off to me, lacking in the sweetness I was expecting. So for a second round, we ordered bottles of Rift Valley, an Ethiopian Cabernet Sauvignon - these were really good. I believe your only liquor options here are Ethiopian beers and wines. \\n\\nSheger Cafe is definitely worth visiting, especially if you live locally."},{"name":"Spoleto Italian Kitchen","address":"4750 The Grove Dr","city":"Windermere","stars":"3.5","text":"Pick your ingredients and they will cook it up!\\n\\nWhat did I get\\nI got the make your own pasta plate.

There are a couple of sauces to choose from (you are able to taste them if you like!) I got Pesto with mine. To finish it up, they will give you bread (there isn't GF option) and also topped it off with as much parmesan as you will like! Love the concept, have pasta on the quick!\\n\\nEnvironment\\nLove the environment, there are high tops and also regular tables and seating. There is also outdoor seating which is really nice for nice weathers!

The biggest thing here is the experience. Dining in the castle from Beauty and the Beast is pretty darn cool. And there are multiple dining rooms to choose from - each unique and whimsical. But when you get right down to it, it's a fast casual restaurant with a total cafeteria feel.\\n\\nThe line gets to be crazy - and I do mean CRAZY - long. Your best bet is to Fastpass it. The only reason we dined here was because I received an email from Disney asking if I wanted to participate in a pre-order test. The concept was that we were basically given a Fastpass with a window of arrival time. But in addition to that, we ordered our food in advance. But upon arrival, they had our reservation, but couldn't pull up our advance order. (So test fail.)\\n\\nSo after you wait in line here and get to the front, you proceed to one of several check-in touch screens where you order your items and pay. In our case, when we did this, I found that it did, in fact, have our advance order already there. (Again, test fail.) After paying, you are given a little plastic rose (if you don't have a Magic Band) and go find yourself a seat. \\n\\nYou collect napkins, silverware, drinks, etc. yourself and bring them to your table. The little plastic rose (or your Magic Band) tells the server where you are sitting and they bring your food to you on a cart when it's ready.\\n\\nWe had the roast beef sandwich, braised pork, and a cupcake. The portions were pretty sizable. And everything was fine enough, but it wasn't particularly good. Again, this spot is clearly more about the experience than about the food.\\n\\nIn sum, unless you have a little one who lives and breathes Beauty and the Beast, I don't think this spot is worth it (at least without a Fastpass)."},{"name":"Dirty Glove Midwest BBQ","address":"1716 Howard Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Caught em at a pop up!!

Overall, I like the quality and taste of their food. As for their services and atmosphere, I rate it a 3.\\n\\nI went here around 1:30PM and the line wasn't too long. I've been warned about their line-up. However, we got a bar seat after 10' of waiting. First off, the service here was extremely slow. We couldn't flag down anyone to order our food, and because most of the servers weren't Viet (considering it's a Viet restaurant), we couldn't order in Vietnamese (although the names are listed under Vietnamese in the menu and English for the ingredients). One other critique is that the food takes a long time to come out. We waited over 30' for the food to be served.\\n\\nWe ordered the banh beo, tossed noodles and vermicelli bowl. I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of the food, everything is very fresh. The banh beo is thin, with plenty of fillings on top. They also included a diluted fish sauce to eat with the banh beo, and it was fantastic! However, for $18, this dish only comes with 6 pieces ($3 apiece). I don't find it justifies the price, I would not get it again, but they were very good. \\n(8/10) \\n\\nThe second dish was the tossed noodles, which I highly recommend to get. The portion is quite filling, and there were lots of meat inside the bowl. The broth was delicious (which is the most important part) and the glass noodles were seasoned to perfection. For $16, this dish is of good value (slightly more expensive than every where else but it's expected). \\n(9/10)\\n\\nLast but not least, I got a vermicelli bowl, which I was extremely excited about. However, although it was good value for the portion (quite big & reasonably priced at $18), I did not like the spring rolls and the vermicelli. The vermicelli is kind of dry, and it doesn't stick together like most vermicelli bowls. Although i've heard raves review about their spring rolls, I was disappointed by the size, texture and fillings of the rolls! I feel like they had too much batter, not enough fillings, and were kind of chewy. They were also skinnier and longer, which maybe explains the lack of fillings.

I came across a Groupon for the this restaurant and thought that would be a prefect date night for father's day.\\n\\nNow!!!! People I did read some of the reviews on Yelp, not all was good but I still decided to go anyway. BUT!!!!!! what I should have done was a recon of the place. A drive by and look in...if you will before buying the groupon. I think it was a EPIC FAILURE :( . Because I had high expectations for the night and was let down.\\n\\nThe first thing I heard upon entering the restaurant doors was screaming babies. My eyes was bucked.... Like WTH. Now the front lobby of the place was nice  they have a very nice light feature to the right as you walk in. Turning to the left walking directly into the food area wasn't much to be desired. We confirmed the reservations and was promptly seated. I can admit the hospitality and the customer service was fantastic. Our greeter explained all the different types of meats that will be served and how we would be served. She gave me a very large wine menu to choose from, because the groupon I had came with a bottle of wine.\\n\\nNow! Getting to the food. Before turning the meats over to green (meaning ready to be served the meat) we went to the VERY simple, plain, minimal cold salad bar. I mean it looked as though they just opened a can of tuna and chopped it up real fine, put a little mayo in it and slapped it on a dish. Everything on the bar was about a one scoop size. Like they was scrapping to save for the next day. My boyfriend kept telling me it's okay, but I was not happy. Especially for the type of night I had planned. Now! Coming back to the table my boyfriend and I almost slipped up on the greasy floor. Finally sitting down and watching other guest slide to their tables we started receiving the meats. This part of the night was fine, I can say the different types of meats pretty decent. The meat servers was pretty slow though coming from the kitchen with more meat. There was a older Asian man standing around looking to see if everything was going good. But when hen notice the guest looking around with empty plates he quickly went to the kitchen. Shortly after he went in a couple of people came to serve more meats. One guy came to our table an apologized, saying their having a problem in the kitchen. But after that was resolved everything was okay. With the food that is......I still had to hear screaming babies and kids.

Luckily, to me it was mild and yet just spicy enough for the capsaicin to really add to the taste - just what I wanted! And the cheese - I haven't had nice, stringy, soft mozzarella like this in so long I'd forgotten what nice mozzarella on a pizza can be. This is the stuff teenage me couldn't wait to eat when the braces finally came off, a perfect blend of stretchy and chewy and tasty.

Though the drinks are unique, the $2 discount is not very special for midtown, given that the original price for most is $10--12. The tapas are also discounted by $2 which is a great deal and most are pretty good....\\n\\nWhat I take exception to is the way they handled the tipping. Seafood paella for 2 is normally a whopping $48 (way over priced for the portions) but on 1/2 price night, it becomes a reasonable $24, meaning $12 per person. Unfortunately, last night, Fino (for the first time I can recall) calculated the 20% tip for our group BEFORE the discount. Given that 10 people at our table had seafood paella, our waitress, who was good, but not great, clipped us for $25 extra in tips. On my tab, she received a 28% tip. . I wrote to the establishment commenting that no one in town does this sort of thing--after all, we paid for expensive drinks, bought bottles of wine and the tapas on happy hour were not calculated at full price for tipping. While the menu does state a 20% tip will be added for parties, there was no mention of the \\"full price\\" stipulation on the paella. This is the response I received regarding the tipping. Notice the not so subtle snub at the end:\\n\\n\\"In regards to tipping before the discount, Paella night, happy hour or any discount to a meal in any restaurant is a discount provided to a guest at the cost of the restaurant, not at the cost of the service staff. One should always tip on what the service would have cost had there not been a discount. It is irresponsible to do so other wise. Calculating gratuity has always been done this way here at FINO and will not change. I am sorry if this means we will loose you and your group's business, but it is most important to FINO to have guests here that value our staff as much as we do and will tip them appropriately.\\""},{"name":"Neverland Tea Salon","address":"3066 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Yay!

The servers definitely lacked the experience. To have referred friends to book the private room im not sure if I would still recommend them to continue pursuing it. Sadly they didn't have enough bottles prepared nor were the girls behind our private bar was even there serving. Our shot glasses were filled as double shots to have people sipping on their shots. \\n\\nHowever Merlin the manager really had it under control when acknowledging my distress but for the price we've paid and willing to provide more it really made a huge effect on our night. Understanding the coordinator in charge was new and first day must have been overwhelmed and first days are usually the hardest but to be hired for a accommodating guest/customers like this must be well aware and well trained such as a promoter would do. \\n\\nOverall I would love to book another private event only under certain circumstances and for myself as the party hostess to arrive ahead to have everything under control since d6 team really doesn't have it.

Some games will never see table time on that wall because the length of some of the games. I do wish they would curate their games. Only think I do like is that their social short games are plentiful, and it is good for the atmosphere it has.\\n\\nOne thing I realized about this place, it has been turned into more of a family restaurant, than a restaurant itself. If they want to aim for that market, I think they should just go with games that are main stream, and games that won't attract awkward situations. It's not hard to do that really.\\n\\nGoing down on the food now, the pizzas were not that bad. It is very authentic Italian and it is perfectly cooked for my taste, as it gives me memories of Italy (thin crust, high ingredients & flavour). Drink menu is too big, and it's not really needed for a restaurant like this. They could just omit it. One thing I do give props for are the amounts of different oils I can use, and they make their own oils too.\\n\\nThe tables do seem a tad small for some good board games, but they just need to curate it, and it should be a fine and dandy place to go to.\\nI recommend bringing your kids, because might as well just make this into a family restaurant, which is a small market currently in Vancouver :)"},{"name":"Awadh India Restaurant","address":"2584 Bethel Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"The food at Awadh is delicious, and the service is fantastic!

If you haven't been to The Crab Pot, basically it's a seafood restaurant where they cook all your seafood in a giant pot and pour it directly out on the table. Diners are given a wooden board and a mallet so they can hammer away at their crab (and anything else you want to smash up!).\\n\\nSo Crab So Good is located on Hastings St, in Burnaby Heights - a bit hidden as it's actually located upstairs, above a breakfast hole-in-the-wall restaurant. It's a fairly small restaurant, so you will need to make a reservation in advance otherwise risk being turned away or waiting quite a long time unless you come right when they open at 5:00PM for dinner. They are also opened for lunch. Note, they are closed on Tuesdays.\\n\\nAs we were a large group reservation, we had to arrive by 5:30PM on a Saturday. We were presented with a one page menu with the key order being either the So Good So Crab Combo A or the So Good So Crab Combo B. Combo A includes shrimp, clams, mussels, corn, red skin potato and sausage cooked in your choice of seasoning (Hala-Cajun, Lemon Pepper, Garlic Butter, White Wine, Origin of the Sea, The Holy Smoke - a combination of Hala-Cajun, Lemon Pepper and Garlic Butter) and your choice of spice level ranging from No Spice to Extra Spicy. Combo B includes everything Combo A has plus dungeness crab. Both combos require a minimum of a 2 person order. They also have various fried seafood items and burgers, but you're mainly here to experience eating off the table and smashing your seafood to bits with your mallet!\\n\\nMy hubby and I ordered the Combo B to share. As a special, you can also Like their Facebook page and Check In for their special promo - which they will add pasta to your pot of seafood! We had that added for free and made for quite a filling dinner for two. The seafood was cooked to perfection. We chose to have the Holy Smoke seasoning with medium spice - which turned out too spicy for me in the end. I think next time I'm going for mild. Also I found the garlic and spices lingering in my mouth hours after dinner - so probably best not to choose that option if you are on a romantic date.\\n\\nDinner worked out to be around $60 after taxes and tips for 2 people - a great deal if you don't want to cook all that seafood as we paid more than that at The Crab Pot in Seattle. However, I found the service particularly slow. Perhaps it's because it takes awhile to custom prepare each diners' orders - whatever the reason, it took us a good 30-40 minutes to receive our meal. Also, they didn't provide plastic bibs for us - so don't wear white or nice clothes if you come here as it can get messy. It would've been nice if they provided plastic bibs with their company logo similar to The Crab Pot.\\n\\nHopefully they can improve their service time and provide bibs for their diners the next time I come back.

Amazing pizza, delicious bread, a great salad AND some of the best tiramisu I've ever had? WOW. I am still a bit in shock.\\n\\nI had read reviews of Via Napoli- a lot of people rave about it. It's the newest restaurant in the Epcot World Showcase and should have been impossible to get into. I read that the pizza in the take out stand in the Italy pavilion was absolutely NOT the same as what they serve in the restaurant and that it was worth the wait if possible to get a table. As luck would have it, we waited in line for maybe  a total of 10 minutes before a lovely indoor/outdoor (right on the edge of the outdoor section) table for 2 opened up.\\n\\nA very friendly waiter straight from Italy came over to greet us and take our order. We joked with him about the irony of moving to the U.S. from Italy to work in a fake Italy. He explained that it was a great job where he had lots of friends who were also transplanted here from Italy to work there, and that he really loved being close to home in a sense, even though he was so far away. He also told us that he thought very highly of the food they served and that he felt it was quite authentic. \\n\\nAfter a glass of wine and some delicious fresh bread and excellent olive oil, we ordered a salad and a pizza with artichokes, truffle oil and fontina. The salad was quite lovely with marinated mushrooms, green olives, plenty of fresh veggies and a balsamic dressing. The pizza was, dare I say, AMAZING. The crust was chewy, crisp and pretttttttty perfect and the toppings were perfectly proportioned. We polished it off so quickly and sort of regretted getting the tiny sized one even though it really was plenty for a meal along with the salad.  It also, as we came to realize, left enough room to share a wonderful tiramisu for dessert. I also had a fantastic cappuccino, complete with a delightful heart of foam on top.\\n\\nThe meal was not cheap, as really nothing at a Disney park is, or is expected to be. You are paying for the experience of it as much as for the food itself, but this time, I would actually say it really is worth every penny. I doubt I'll be back at Epcot before I have a kid of my own to bring with me, but if YOU ever go, I would STRONGLY encourage you to pay a visit to Via Napoli.

I told her about the previous burger I had had, and she said they had changed owners a few months ago and the menu has changed, so not all burgers have teriyaki sauce on it, which is a plus in my books! \\n\\nThe basic burger is $2.85 (plus tax), but I ordered the cheeseburger for a dollar more. While still cheap, you're essentially paying a dollar for a slice of Kraft cheese, so not totally worth it, but still a-ok. \\n\\nAre the burgers fantastic?  Of course not; what can you expect for $3?  However, they are decent, and for the price you're paying, a great deal.  I'm giving Wakwak four stars; the extra star is for the price.\\n\\nAlso, they accept credit card!\\n\\n[Yelp collections: Poor and hungry?]"},{"name":"Bar Louie Plaza on University","address":"4100 N Alafaya Trl, Ste 167 & 173","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I would describe Bar Louie's UCF location as the perfect place for the above 21-year-old students to go to!

For my entree, I had the Salmon which was well prepared and again, a large portion. It was accompanied by rice and veggies which were good as well. For dessert, I had the baklava, which was traditional and delicious. \\n\\nService was great. Again, this may be because they are prepared for a larger crowd?

Our single order of garlic cheese bread was enough for 4 people, which isn't a bad thing, but be aware that the portion size is large. The bread had the perfect amount of cheese and garlic. The bread was browned enough to make it crunchy without being too hard. You can't go wrong with the dipping marinara sauce - it's so good and you can absolutely tell that it's homemade. The side salad included cheese, tomatoes, mixed greens, and your choice of dressing served with two slices of crostini. I recommend the house made Italian dressing! \\n\\nI think the pizza is better if you eat it at the restaurant. We had a 20 minute drive home and the bread lost a lot of heat during the drive.

NOT the buffet - the redbar lounge which is exactly straight ahead from the front door. You line up. You show them your ID to match the invitation card name. You show them your encore card and the encore card of your guest. You get a necklace (the ones they throw around at mardi gras and pride parades) and you get a paper bracelet. You line up in a second line up.\\n\\nWhen they let you in, you will get to eat. There will be 2 types of salads to choose from, 1 caesar and 1 spring. For the spring salad, you can choose between 2 dressings - 1 ranch and 1 italian. There are breadsticks available. From there, you can move onto the hot items - the first will be plain penne pasta, the second will be plain spaghetti, followed by your choice of Alfredo sauce or Tomato sauce. There is 1 meat dish which is chicken thighs with their skin on. You may help yourself to some tea or pop at a table closeby. There will be cake served in a few minutes too.\\n\\nAt this point, after you eat, you can eitheir wait for the draw which happens an hour and 15 minutes after your seating time (e.g. 7 30 seating will have an 8 45 draw), or you can leave. If your name is drawn, you will not get your prize if you're not present. While you are eating, the hotel also gives you $5 free slot play - only to the birthday person, not the guest. There are 5 prizes per seating and it is a dinnerware set/plates.\\n\\nIn total, if you'd like to be part of the draw, you can prepare to wait about 2 hours in total at the casino. If you don't care about the draw, you could come in late and avoid the initial lineup and just go in for a plate of pasta.\\n\\nFor me, I love cheap thrills but I really kinda hated this experience. It took too much time getting to their casino (if you're taking public transit, their shuttle comes every 30 minutes from the 22nd street skytrain station). It took too long to wait for dinner and too long to wait for the draw. The food was really awful, partially because I came in with the expectation that we'd be participating in their regular buffet (which by the way, isn't that great eitheir). Perhaps if I had known that the food was going to be like Fiesta Friday in a Prison, I would have been much happier. \\"Italian themed buffet\\" is really stretching it. It's more of an all you can eat crap fest. \\n\\nLastly, while this has nothing to do with the casino, the people that were there in our particular seating were not friendly and just not a good crowd to hang out with. I'll spare you the details and anecdotes, but if you like easy going, friendly, sociable people, you won't like the crowd that came at our seating and you have to sit SO close to one another for some tables, like I did. Maybe it was a one off and the crowd differs from month to month, but a lot of people in line, I heard were regulars to the birthday opening."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I did not have high hopes for the food at be our guest but was pleasantly surprised.

However, we were still waiting an hour past our reservation time to be seated. Judging by the irritation of the other guests, we weren't the only ones. At one point, an angry family confronted the wait staff, stating his family had waited nearly two hours past their reservation time to be seated. Besides the long wait, the service was equally as a disappointing. Our waitress was not attentive nor friendly throughout our meal. \\n\\nThat being said, I gave this review 3/5 stars because the only two things that partially saved this experience were the atmosphere and food. Although you're not guaranteed to sit in the grand ballroom, the other rooms are equally entertaining. We sat in the beast's room near the enchanted rose, and the beast would make brief appearances every 20 minutes or so. The food was pretty good as well.

After hearing about this place's hype we took our guests there last week who were visiting Atlanta for the first time. We knew about the no-frills customer service at this place (standing in a queue to order, getting called to pick your order, serving in disposable bowls, plates) so we were mainly concerned about treating our guests to good Pakistani/Indian food. For 4 of us, we ordered Nihari, Biryani, Chicken Karahi, Bagharay Baingan, Raita, Kachumar Salad and Naan. When the food arrived the portions were quite small compared to the price they were charging. We however thought that we might have to order more dishes to ensure our guests eat well. \\nWe liked the food even though Nihari was served without the customary lemon, ginger and onion toppings. For desserts we ordered Rabri and Ras Malai. Their Rabri was the absolute worst I've tasted. It didn't taste like Rabri at all. The Ras Malai was average.  \\nThe next day I and one of our guests (both of us had biryani) got very sick.  I had severe vomits all night with stomach ache. Out guest suffered from an upset stomach. Had to scrap all our vacation plans for the coming days. Absolutely pathetic that the restaurant cannot maintain their cleanliness/food safety standards. Took us a week to get well. Missed work, had to change vacation plans and was embarrassing that our guests had to suffer health issues after we took them to dinner.  The very least expectation one would have is Not to get sick after eating out. Never going back. Luqma is a much better option. Have eaten there several times and never once had any issues.\\n If u want to suffer for the rest of the week after eating out, Zaiqa is the place to go!"},{"name":"East Side Pies","address":"13265 N Highway 183, Ste B","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"We stopped here after iFly and I was really impressed!

Pile on the applesauce to be safe.

My success rate went way up with this change in strategy.\\n\\nDrinks are free and bottomless, thanks to the fountain machine.\\n\\nSadly, I don't think I can really recommend this buffet.

The blueberry cake was my boyfriends preferred donut because he liked the cakey texture and he also liked the key lime donut since he felt it was more lemon-flavored than the lemon poppy donut. \\n\\nI personally didn't like the chocolate ganache as much because I felt that it left an odd aftertaste in my mouth. The ganache is also a very messy donut where instead of a glaze, it's almost like frosting is on your donut so it's quite messy to eat.

While the pizza was pretty good, don't come expecting the wrong thing. \\n\\nLocated seemingly on a odd stretch of Orange Ave between downtown and the sodo area, the building can be easy to pass by. On weekend nights for dining in it can get very busy so try to come earlier around 6. They also do carryout and delivery. \\n\\nNow to the za! They have an extensive pizza list including tomato, olive oil, or alfredo based pizzas. Everything from margarita, to meat lovers, to alfredo chicken pizza. I had the meat lovers and margarita entree personal size pizzas and split them with one other person. Plenty of pizza with a little left over for lunch the next day. Yum! \\n\\nThe only thing we had that I would not recommend is listed on the menu as \\"garlic cheese bread\\" when it is really a sort of cheese pizza appetizer. When I think of garlic cheese bread I see stringy cheesy goodness on top of italian bread.  Not pizza dough in a pizza shape. As our waitress warned, because it is more pizza than bread (all pizza...) it takes just as long to cook as a pizza so you'll be waiting and it is not worth it. I'm not mad--just disappointed. \\n\\nOverall, a good pizza joint if you are in the area. Be prepared to wait a bit for your pizza after you order or longer if you walk in and there is already a wait. Because of the long pizza wait time, it takes longer for tables to clear out and therefore longer to get your own table.

Personally, I would deduct some quality points for the ice cream. Austin has some quality ice cream and gelato locations; so, my ice cream/gelato taste buds are up in its game.

EPIC. \\n\\nWhen I learned that this restaurant existed & that I could eat with the beast, I pretty much swooned. Childhood dreams can come true! We booked our trip quite last minute and when I looked up reservations, I was devastated. You can start booking 180 days in advance and this place was jam packed. I was not defeated though and I looked up reservations about 15 times a day until WHAM! A dinner reservation at 7:35pm for four available? OH MY GAWD YES! \\n\\nWe checked in outside the castle, and no not Cinderella's castle - the beasts. I haven't been to Disneyworld in years and no idea this place was in there. We were escorted over a bridge where two giant wooden doors opened and in we went. The ballroom was stunning as we walked through to be seated in the most perfect, private corner that made us feel like we were the only ones there. The place was bustling throughout but somehow, it was quiet. Just beautiful. We looked up out the windows where there was frozen snow glistening on the balcony and trees, like we were in the movie. The decor and artistry was stunning.\\n\\nWe got blessed with Allen as our waiter. He was legit the best service I have received in my entire life. Knowledge, smart, friendly, professional, well spoken. We wanted to be his best friend by the end of the evening. He helped us chose a few lovely bottles of wine that complemented everything we ordered perfectly. NOTE: Magic Kingdom does not sell any alcohol at all except for dinner at Be Our Guest. Basically, this was exactly what we needed! We ordered our food based on some of his recommendations: French onion soup, cheese & meat board, and the sirloin steak entrees. Our appetizers were delicious, my soup covered in poet gooey melted cheese with perfectly cooked onions. The charcuterie board was so lovely: it have Pugh for two with bread, various cheeses, olives, pickles, nuts, honey, prosciutto, salami, ham, etc. So many choices to make so perfect bites. We were so happy with the starters we asked Allen to wait to our our entrees in so we could relax a little and prepare our stomachs. He actually told us to take as long as we liked. After a nice wine break, we put our entrees in and out came perfectly cooked steaks, pomme frittes & saut√©ed veggies. I ordered my steak rare & found it absolutely mouthwatering good. There was a garlic butter melting over the top that put the taste... well, over the top! Pomme frittes were delish was a garlic aioli. Everything was seasoned to perfection. \\n\\nWe had preordered some mini birthday cakes through Disney as our visit was an early birthday celebration; they were on point! Mine was tiered with a princess Minnie crown, flowers, and personalized. I was a child again in pure joy! BONUS: it tasted delicious! Rich chocolate cake, creamy icing and sugar art. Adorable! A few moments later it was like Allen read my mind & brought us out The Grey Stuff. Anyone who knows Beauty & the Beast knows to try the grey stuff, it's delicious. It came out on a plate covered with Mickey sprinkles and can best be described as a cookies & cream/Oreo type cream that was simple & really was delicious. \\n\\nAfter our meal and even though we had sat there for 4ish hours, Allen took us around to each room where we were allowed to look at the library and rose room but he went a step farther & showed us hidden mickeys throughout the restaurant. It may have been the wine but I was giddy! The rose by the way: breathtaking! We finally got to meet the Beast and take pictures all around before finally leaving. We were legit the last people in the park and managed to catch the castles Goodnight Kiss which pretty much was the overly perfect finale to an already perfect evening.

The waiters at Oddfish are a humorous bunch and their knowledge about the varieties of fish definitely impressed us. We started our meal with the octopus and a side of asparagus, both of which were delectable. The former may have been garnished with an excessive amount of parsley, but that is just a personal preference. The octopus itself was quite tender and the sauce added to the dish without overpowering it. The asparagus paired well with the shredded parmesan and we have nothing but praises for these two dishes. \\n\\nWhat we didn't like:\\nWhen we decided to go to Oddfish, we were not prepared for Odd(tasting)Fish. The Whole Fish (Sea Perch) came balanced and unique in presentation, with contrasting sauces coating each side. However, taking a single bite of the Sea Perch quickly reminded us to not judge a book by its covers - a dish not by its presentation. The only flavour we could taste was an overwhelming bitterness that lasted until our next, desperately needed, sip of water. The fish was clearly not properly cleaned or severely burnt (I pray for the latter). Long story short, we brought it up to our waiter who returned the dish to the kitchen and shortly after came back to tell us the dish was charred and that the chef believes it to be how its supposed to taste. \\n\\nI've had my fair share of culinary experiences around the world and I hold great respect for chefs and their creations; who am I to critique the work of a professional with countless hours under his/her belt? For this reason, I've rarely, if ever, sent dishes back to the kitchen. Yet, I do believe that a charred dish and a burnt one are separated by a not-so-fine line - one which the chefs at Oddfish have not only crossed, but also constructed a $45 dish on. \\n\\nUpdate: After checking other Yelp reviews and seeing comments about the overwhelmingly bitter after-taste of their charred fish, I believe it has less to do with the gentleness of my palette and more to do with the dish itself."},{"name":"Malay Curry House","address":"4500 Kingsway Street, Suite 2137","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3.5","text":"I had the house special laksa (#9) with chicken and thin rice vermicelli.

Afterward, I went to Voodoo and got my money's worth on some delicously sinful bad-for-me food that I could feel guilty over and hit the gym later. Hey, it's a damn donut. It's supposed to be sticky, sugary, make you feel sick, and then want to come back next weekend...   Blue Star didn't deliver the guilty sin or goodness.\\n\\nAnd stop asking me about gender neutral bathrooms, Yelp. It's this kind of shit (read review above) that is making good food places into gluten free, vegan, organic, male tampon wearing eateries. \\n\\nDo not bring your kids here unless they have their own eTrade account and are doing better in the market than you. Kids eat a lot of donuts or spill them on the floor.

As my first impression was really good, but the second experience was such a turnoff. All happened in one week, which makes me feel a little disappointed on how quick the falloff is. \\n\\nWhen I went there on Tuesday for a work lunch with some coworkers, we put our names down for a table. The restaurant seemed to be very busy during lunch hours, and no reservation is allowed. Once we were seated, the waitress came and dropped off some tea and cups. As I was poring the tea, one of the cups burst into half which spilled all the water. I moved very quickly so the water didn't get on my pants. We joked about my tea poring skills afterwards, which I didn't think it was that big of a deal. But we tried for 5 minutes to flag down a waitress, and she only came to drop off more napkins, did not even take away the soaked ones, nor wiped down the table, very unlike the Japanese style. (I think they are not owned by actual Japanese that's why) \\n\\nWhen we got our food, I was impressed how fast they are with the orders, and how fresh the sashimi was. I ordered the spicy salmon sashimi combo, for only $10.95! It came with some cucumber rolls, diced salmon sashimi with spicy sauce, and some spicy salmon rolls. The salad and miso soup were also part of the combo, which I think was the best value. We were chatting and laughing, didn't really pay attention to the service etc, and didn't really care tbh. As long as the food was good right? \\n\\nOn Saturday, I was in the neighborhood again and decided to do take out for our family. I bragged about the food with my husband who likes sushi very much, so I want him to try it. Because I had my baby daughter in the car, so I decided to call in to order first. The waitress on the phone was very impatient, and tried to hang up on my twice before I even finished my order! I had to keep telling her I'm not finished yet, and she didn't seem to care much. 15 mins later I went in to pick up the food with my daughter, it was busy as usual with a few people waiting outside, and nobody seem to know what's going on and no one at the door to seat people. I walked in and waited in line by the cashier and she saw me holding the baby, and still handed me a POS machine to pay and left me stood there. In my head, I was thinking how do you expect me to pay with both of my hand occupied, couldn't you just put it on the counter and let me know when it's ready? Once again, didn't seem to care. The funny thing is, the restaurant doesn't seem to be that busy to the point there's zero service to customers.\\n\\nI walked out with an annoying feeling, thinking if there's anyway they can improve their service. Because even though the food was good, the price was cheap, but they are not good enough for me to go back again having to deal with this type of service. So if any of you wants to eat inside, make sure to go early to avoid the wait. For pickup orders, please call in with a list of things telling them without breathing, so they wouldn't be able to hang up on you! Please don't have any expectations to their service because there is none."},{"name":"Mellow Mushroom Orlando","address":"11680 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I'm not sure if it's just me but I really can't get over good pizza.

Stopped in to try lunch on a Saturday and were totally pleased.\\n\\nI was in the mood for a big burger, so we thought we'd stop in here and see what the place looked like now after transforming into Burchett's. We had gone several times, with decreasing satisfaction, when it was Hide-a-way. Visually, the place looks about the same, although seems cleaned up a bit and a bit brighter. The menu is new, but the same types of foods that Hide-a-way served -- burgers, sandwiches, that type of thing. So I was initially a little concerned it was a change in name only. (Spoiler alert: no.)\\n\\nI ordered the Steve's -- a burger topped with deli-style roast beef, bacon, and swiss, served dip-style with au jus. (Note, the menu says you can add grilled onions, but mine came with the onions already on. So maybe, if you are onion-averse, just mention you don't want them.) Anyway, a burger topped with 2 kinds of meat. SO good! Something a little different in that it was served as a dip and really hit the spot.\\n\\nMy husband, who can always be counted on to order a bacon cheeseburger, was pleased to see the Big John's on the menu -- double meat, double cheese, double bacon. He loved it, said it was a very, very good burger. The burgers all come with fries, chips, or curly fries -- he chose fries, and said they were perfect, hand-cut and fresh. I had chips, which are house-made. (The menu doesn't specify that -- I think it should, it's a selling point.) The potato slices stuck together in the fryer, so some were perfectly crispy but some were underdone and a bit crunchy. Ensuring these are all separated before dunking in the fryer would make them perfect.\\n\\nPrices were reasonable, around the $10 mark for a burger and fries.

The burger arrived with a beautiful presentation.  But, could it be? Was I served a frozen paddy? If not, Bobby managed to find the one chef I'm aware of who can shape beef patty that's perfectly round and perfectly fits the bun. Also, the bun was a bit stale, but this was on a Holiday Monday, so maybe they doubled up on buns last time they were delivered.  (You get a pass on this.) The avocado relish was good, but from the \\"king of heat\\" I was hoping for some more punch. \\n\\nI had fries with my burger. Correction, fry bits. It's like they vacuumed up all the leftovers and served them to me. On top of that, they were barely even warm and a bit soggy. The fries came with a special sauce that had the consistency of water.

At the price range this place offers, you are not going to find much better. Noodles are succulent, the flavor contrasts are dynamite (I ask them to make mine spicy) and the vegetables are fresh and not cooked to mush where they have no texture. It's quite delicious. If you want to throw any type of nutritional caution into the wind, you can up your game and go with the fried Pad Thai which is also scrumptious. \\n\\nTo meet the minimum dollar threshold for delivery I almost always have to order something other than just an entree, so I have had all of the soups they offer on the menu. My go to that I can't get enough of and that I recommend you try is called Shrimp Tom Yum Goong. I have never had anything quite like it before but it really hits the spot. It is similar to your standard \\"hot and sour\\" soup that you see at many places, but it has a much creamier consistency.

The interior is very sleek and comfortable, yet it feels nothing like a sports bar. The servers all congregate at the front  by the hostess stand, which just looks bad and unprofessional. We were seated quite promptly by the open windows on a beautiful day. Our server gave us our menus and then disappeared. I found this odd because I was expecting a run down on the plethora of beer I thought I'd find at a place called Brighton BEER Garden. Turns out no rundown would be necessary as the selection of beer was very disappointing.  No beer specials and no beers I had never experienced. What a bummer. I was so looking forward to going here on a regular basis. After getting over the disappointment with the beer menu, I moved to make my food selection. The menu actually had a pretty decent selection, something for everyone. From this point forward is where everything goes further downhill. I settled on the fajitas mostly because on order had just arrived at the table across from me and they smelled delicious. So I ordered them. They server asked if I wanted steak, chicken, shrimp or to combo. I asked innocently enough what the combo had. She replied in a very snarky manner. \\"It's a combination of chicken, steak and shrimp\\" And left it at that. I said oh well I don't like shrimp. To which she offered no response (I was hoping she'd offer me the combo sans shrimp). So I settled with the steak. Our food came out it in a pretty decent amount of time, but was luke warm which lead me to believe it had stood on the counter for a bit while our server talked it up at the front with her buddies. I mean isn't part of the fun of fajitas the sizzle when they arrive? My fajitas where served with the tortillas in the customary plastic container, the fixins on one plate and the meat and peppers on another plate.  Taking it all in I immediately noticed that there was no surface on which I could prepare my fajita. So I kindly asked for a plate from the young man that delivered my meal. I never know if I can ask the food runner for things, but I was hungry and didn't think it was such a big deal. He shot me a dirty look and returned with an enormous entree plate. I thought, okay maybe I am being difficult maybe most people prepare their fajitas in their hand or on the table or something. So I began to eat. The flavours where actually pretty good.  The meat could have been a bit more tender. The peppers where cooked perfectly though. Just then I notice another set of fajitas being delivered to the table next to me. Will he also ask for a plate? YES!  Yes he did. Except he didn't get a dirty look and a huge plate, he was simply ignored. The meal was okay overall.   Our server dropped our check and took about ten minutes (ten actual minutes) to come pick it up. This place had SO much promise. Not another pizza joint, not another Irish bar.

You order and pay upfront. Water, plates, cups, napkins, and silverware are self-serve. Orders are served on trays which you pick up at the counter.\\n\\nI guesstimate the dining room can seat about 100 people. It almost feels like a cafeteria. It was busy and bustling when we went for Saturday night dinner. They apparently have banquet facilities that can accommodate 50 to 450 people.\\n\\nThe menu has a variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options and they serve halal meat. There are about 40 different items to choose from with all items, remarkably, under $8 each. What a bargain.\\n\\nHere's what we went with (with slightly revised menu descriptions):\\n\\n* Chicken 65 ($6.69) - boneless thigh meat marinated in organic ginger and garlic with mild spices then battered and fried, finished off with cilantro, green chiles, and curry leaves\\n* Chicken Tikka Masala ($6.99) - chicken breast nuggets roasted in clay oven, served in a roasted cashew nut, almond, onion gravy\\n* Hyderbadi Mutton Biryani ($7.49) - aged extra long grain basmati rice cooked over goat meat marinated in homemade yogurt, crispy fried onions, fresh mint, spices, and Spanish saffron\\n* Kadhai Kheema ($7.49) - minced goat meat cooked in Indian wok, tomato, julienned ginger, coarsely ground spices\\n* Saag Paneer ($6.49) - homemade cheese in a creamy fresh spinach sauce\\n* Baghare Baigan ($6.49) - baby eggplant cooked with gravy of sesame seeds, peanuts, tamarind, coconut, and curry leaves, tempered with whole garlic cloves and cumin seeds\\n* Naan ($1.59) - crispy white flour flatbread baked in a tandoor\\n\\nIn general, the food was fresh and delicious.

The bits of mutton were tender and savory. This is an addictive dish.\\n\\nThe kadhai kheema was probably my least favorite dish, but it wasn't bad. The goat meat was a little tough and I wasn't a huge fan of the tomato-ginger sauce. Lots of flavor, but I personally probably wouldn't order this dish again.\\n\\nThe saag paneer was good. This is one of my favorite Indian dishes. It's basically creamed spinach with cubes of white cheese. Goopy, but yummy. I love spinach.\\n\\nThe baghare baigan was A-OK. The eggplant was nice and hot. The sauce was packed with flavor. It was a little bit oily, but overall fine. They garnish this dish with plenty of chopped cilantro.\\n\\nFinally, the naan was excellent.

Like Copenhagen style. \\nI ordered \\nPork Pinchitos with Sea Salt, \\nCrab, Avocado & Espelette Pepper Bruschetta, \\nbeef Pinchitos, \\nSauteed Calamari with Tomato, Lemon & Chile from Tapas menu, and lamb shank from entree menu. \\nThe lamb shank looks good. Even another table asked the waiter what I am eating. \\nAmong all dishes I ordered, I like sauteed Calamari most. Usually you only get fried calamari from other restaurants. But I hated fried food. \\nI like Pork Pinchitos a lot too. It's very tender and tastes much better than beef Pinchitos. Beef Pinchitos is hard, burnt and overdone. \\nI didn't like Crab, Avocado & Espelette Pepper Bruschetta at all. Basically it's a cold avocado on a piece of bread. Not much crab flavors. \\nPeople at outdoor lounge all ordered wine. And my son ran around and I worried if he will knock over some glasses all the time. It's a romantic restaurant, not much for kids. \\n------------------------------ \\nFirst time visit: Very modern design restaurant. Spanish food. \\nMy friends didn't like their food. But I ordered what I like. Some skew grilled meat I ordered is really tasty. (They didn't have website at that time, I couldn't remember the name. It's called Pork Pinchitos with Sea Salt) \\nIt's on the second floor of a small street shopping area. Pay attention to their patio.

As soon as you walk in you see a bunch of stands with fresh pastries of all sorts. Everything had a glaze over it that made it look super delectable. There was sweet stuff, but also savory breads with sausage in them.\\n\\nI didn't try any of the self-serve pastries though, instead, I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. I had the option of choosing croissant or toast, and I chose toast because that's more of what I was envisioning. \\n\\nThe sandwich was exactly what I ordered and nothing more. The eggs were good but nothing special, no herbs or veggies. The bacon was good but not amazing like a thick-cut applewood bacon. The toast was some homemade bread, and the cheese was American cheese which I don't really like. But what made it really satisfying is that it came out piping hot off the grill, and it was less than $5 for a lot of food. The nice employee told me that they had Tabasco and ketchup. I wish the sandwich had something a little more creative like a homemade sauce, but it was very fresh and a great value. \\n\\nThe service was very friendly. I'll definitely be going back for their pastries especially.

It's a nice very clean looking place, had hints of Japanese and Korean decor. I think they need new management or something.

Via Yelp, we decided to try Drelyse.\\n\\nThe restaurant is in a strip mall on Tamarack Circle (I'm finding that Columbus has many excellent restaurants hidden in random strip malls.)  While I'm somewhat familiar with Ethiopian food, West African food is completely new to me, yet strangely comfortable.  \\n\\nBased on other yelp reviews we went with sambusas and vitumbua for appetizers.  The owner also brought us a spring roll.  All three were excellent.  The sambusa is very similar to an indian samosa.  The vitumbua is a sort of heavy rice (?) cake that is pleasantly slightly sweet.\\n\\nThere was an assortment of african beer and, oddly, Guinness bottled in Africa but sent to America.  I went with \\"Nkulenu's Palm Drink\\" which was imported from Kenya.  It is hard to describe, but very refreshing on a hot day.  Give it a try when you go.\\n\\nI had the beef peanut butter soup with fufu.  We also ordered a chipatti out of curiosity, which is similar to North Indian batura.  The soup (when eaten with the chipatti) was reminiscent of malaysian roti canai and was very good.  My wife had the beef spinach stew with rice which was also excellent.  We also tried the plaintains which were tasty.\\n\\nThe atmosphere in the (small) restaurant is very friendly and almost feels like you're visiting someone's home for dinner.  There was a tv in the corner playing an african soap opera, which seemed to be centered around a couple that was pregnant against the wishes of their family and a lady with poorly controlled asthma who never could get to her albuterol inhaler in time... I digress.\\n\\nWe met the owners...The husband runs the show out front (and kindly gave us samples of some of their food before we ordered.)

My husband went to pick the food up and they didn't include the steamed white rice. He asked for it and they said it would be additional...except he'd already paid for it in the original order. He was having trouble conveying the situation to the person at the counter and ended up just paying for the rice a second time because it wasn't worth the hassle for that amount of money. He reflected that in retrospect, it felt a bit sketchy that they charged for it twice. They had to have had a receipt that showed the full order so how could they really argue that it wasn't paid for? Plus, why would the customer lie about ordering a side of rice. From the business owner side, it doesn't seem like an expensive enough item to fight the customer for.\\n\\nOn top of the mediocre customer service, the food wasn't very good. I expected the noodles to be amazing since they are a noodle house and have a reputation for being excellent. Maybe the other location is better but this was borderline inedible. I think we ended up throwing out the leftovers because neither of us could bring ourselves to eat any more of it.

We made reservations @ Gunshow for a Friday night over a month in advance---yes, this place is hot right now.  We arrived at 8:40, a little early for our 9:00 reservation and sat at the bar for only a couple of minutes before being seated across from one another at the long common tables made of distressed wood, joined by C clamps.  There was plenty of room between us and our fellow diners so no feeling of claustrophobia or fear of eavesdropping on our conversation.  In fact, the room is so loud it was difficult to hear much of anything our servers said---they had to bend close and use their \\"outdoor\\" voice in order to tell us about the protocols for ordering we were about to experience.  You are presented with a menu which lists your seating time, each dish, the price and has a  space to mark what you have ordered (or rejected) as we were told that if the chefs offered a dish and we rejected it, that dish would not come round again. \\n\\n First out was an app of pita and spring pea pesto which was delicious and we woofed it down, finishing up about the time our cocktail order finally arrived--mine a bourbon based offering, the Seventh Inning Stretch, sporting a salted ice cube and the better half's Jalisco Sour.  Both cocktails were well executed, strong and delicious.  Next out in ridiculously quick succession were a Vietnamese pancake stuffed with white shrimp (yes, please--best dish of the night) Fritto Misto (which we wanted but could not  eat quickly enough to enjoy it right out of the fryer so we had to pass) and a Scallop Escabeche--literally within 5 minutes.  Our chef for the Frito said that we just had to ask our main server to order the dish for later, which we did.  Before we had finished the Escabeche, out came alligator sausage over a hominy polenta--delicious, but the dishes were beginning to stack up.  A few minutes later out came a beautiful duck-breast but we were saving room for the Fritto-Misto and the Mole Short RIb (or so we thought).  At this point we had been seated just shy of 30 minutes.  Boom--here's the short rib--which we took and ordered a couple of glasses of the reserve Pinot Noir.  The wine came out quickly but --and I understand that restaurants store red wine in the cooler to keep them fresh and a little chill is OK for a red anyway--but this wine had to be 38-39 degrees--it was ice cold.  I tried holding the glass with my hands cupped around it to warm it up some, but the short rib was now getting cold.  Fritto Misto never appeared---and by now we are full.  Here's the deal--the food was outstanding, but the format of getting slammed with food so fast that you can't concentrate on enjoying what is in front of you does not work for me or mine.  I like to savor a good dish---a little break in the action so you can digest and look forward to what is next.  So, be forewarned, if you want a relaxed, paced meal, this place ain't for you----"},{"name":"Domino's Pizza","address":"90 W William St","city":"Delaware","stars":"2","text":"I wish I could give a zero.

Most of the items were pre-wrapped and each item had a description card and price set by it. The prices for the items seemed inconsistent and in general very expensive. This location seems like it wants to compete with The Glass Knife(another location I dislike). The bakery noticeably had a minimal amount of loaves of bread. We picked a few items and were on our way. Once at home we tried the red bean doughnut and one of the rolls. They had no taste whatsoever. We tried the \\"sausage\\" bread which to me tasted like a hot dog on a flatbread.

No fatty gristly mystery chunks either altho I did find a small bone shard so make sure you chew well.  The tortillas are handmade but were a little hard--the cart is pretty popular so I suspect that's due to not having time to heat them beforehand rather than staleness.

On top of a great tasting meal, it was quick and the service was really great as well. All in all, I'm glad I finally tried one of these out and will gladly seek them out in Dallas as well."},{"name":"ReelHouse Boston","address":"6 New St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I kept reading great things about the Reelhouse and it didn't disappoint.  A beautifully designed restaurant with lovely views (despite being a cold, gray, rainy day).  We went for brunch on a Sunday and got a great seat by the window.  The cocktails were fantastic, the trout toast was to die for, and everything in between (there was substantial sharing among all at our table) was perfection.  I can't wait to go back again in warmer weather.  Would most definitely recommend!"},{"name":"Hokkaido Chinese & Japanese Buffet","address":"5737 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"Sorry folks- it may be clean, it may be inexpensive, you might say the options are staggering- so what.  Food not hot, almost everything very poor quality.  If you just need to fill your belly on the cheap and have ZERO qualms about taste/quality- please do!  Steamed quahog clams? Soggy, room temp apps?  Flavorless sushi? Half baked apple pie?  Egg drop soup sooo thick you need a fork?  Abysmal salad bar?"},{"name":"Paris Baguette","address":"581 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"There's great seating and I love the interior design of this place! But the food and drinks are average quality and overpriced."},{"name":"Buk Kyung II","address":"151 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"3.5","text":"I have been eating here for years. Jajangmyun is consistently good. Jampong (seafood noodle) is definitely 5/5 -- it's got lots of seafood, bit salty but that's expected.  I am rating this 4 stars rather than 5 because they really need to up their fried dish game. The price for tangsuyook (sweet and sour pork) is ridiculous and the quality of the sauce is not very high.  You get ridiculous portion for ganpong shrimp (spicy and sweet friend shrimp) but the shrimp quality is really low and they can't get the batter right so it never taste right.  Service here is always good and food comes out fast but fresh."},{"name":"Wondermade","address":"214 E 1st St","city":"Sanford","stars":"4","text":"The ice cream is AMAZING!  /I love trying ice cream places that make their own ice cream. This is one of the best I've ever had and I've tried a lot of ice cream!  \\n\\nThey make it fresh in-house. It is very creamy.  I tried many samples before ordering a small which is two scoops.  I chose cookies and cream and churro.  It is a great price too!  Checkin with yelp to save 20%.\\n\\nThey have creative flavors like cornbread and avocado.  \\n\\nThere is free street parking.  They have indoor and outdoor seating."},{"name":"Pho Huy","address":"2755 Lougheed Highway, Suite 22","city":"Port Coquitlam","stars":"4","text":"I tried this place for the first time tonight. It was ok. I do agree that it is highly overpriced for the portions they give. I ordered chicken & there was barely any meat. I may give it another try some day if I'm desperate enough but it won't be my first choice."},{"name":"Hell Yeah Gluten Free","address":"900 Dekalb Ave NE, Ste 500","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Best gluten free doughnuts I've ever had.

Cheese not melted all the way. I asked for extra-hot (spicy)green chile, but they only have regular. They have a great habanero hot sauce, but that shouldn't count towards green chile heat! Last tidbit, one of my fellow diners found a piece of food in her self serve water cup - yuk! I think Pepper Box needs to pay closer attention to detail. I wanted to mention this to the cashier, but she was rather unapproachable and I was in a hurry to get back to work."},{"name":"Rush Bowls","address":"1110 Hammond Dr, Ste 25","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"I had a great experience! There was no line, the menu was clear, the staff was friendly, and I was excited that they make their peanut butter in house! I was a bit skeptical of putting jelly on my bowl but to my surprise it was more like a berry compote. This place is vegan friendly and they are very generous with their portions and presentation compared to other places. I got here around 2:45 PM so I'm assuming I missed the crowd, I will definitely be back!"},{"name":"Somerville Brewing Co","address":"15 Ward St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"I used to LOVE Slumbrew brewery until I recently had a very disappointing experience. My friends and I were trying to be adventurous and try new beers, so we gave their sour a shot. None of us liked it, which wasn't a big deal, sometimes that happens. However, we spoke to the bartender and asked if we could get a different beer to replace the one we didn't like. We were each given new beers and didn't think anything of it. \\n\\nAt the end of the night, we got our tabs and the sours we thought we had replaced were still on our tabs. When we asked the bartender about it he said the manager wouldn't let him comp the beers because they're too small of an establishment to eat the cost. I completely understand that, and if my friends and I had been approached and that explained, we would have sucked down the gross beer instead of ordering more. However, we weren't approached and instead given this passive-aggressive treatment. \\n\\nThis is not the way to treat customers and I am very disappointed with a brewery I use to respect."},{"name":"Brick & Fire","address":"1621 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I went to Brick & Fire with a large group and they accommodated us very well even though we only had one waiter who seemed like he was in the weeds.

This really is a hole in the wall spot, with about 30 seats obviously scavenged from another restaurant in a rather run-down building isolated from most of the rest of town. They play Mexican pop music very loudly. There was a TV, but it was off. This is no corporate owned chain, that's for sure.\\n\\nThey seem to do most of their business as takeout. Plenty of people came and went from the counter as we sat at our booth, and a lot of them spoke Spanish, a good sign that the food is good. If you dine in, they will serve you tableside and give you proper menus instead of making you order from the posted menu. \\n\\nThe menu is no frills, but pretty large and authentic. We ordered a michelada and a mango agua fresca, both very delicious, but I especially loved the mangoey goodness of the agua fresca. We both had tortas, cubana for me and pierna enchilada for DLW. Both were huge and loaded with goodies. Mine had carnitas, chorizo, fried egg, ham, pork pastor and cheese along with lettuce and tomato. Hers was pork leg, chipotle sauce and cheese. They were quite the bargain at $9 each.\\n\\nYou can get breakfast anytime, as well as chilaquiles. On weekends they have pozole and menudo.
