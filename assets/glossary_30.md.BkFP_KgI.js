Ended up grabbing a coffee and a beef empanada, I mean who wouldn't call that a breakfast of champions? Where to start, coffee burnt and empanada felt like it was sitting on a 7-11 heated spinning rack for a week (In other words very dry), but the flavor was a 2 out of 5. To top it off, almost $10 for everything, but one cannot complain about pricing when it comes to anything purchased in an airport. Would I try it again...probably not, but you never know about what you will get in airports (More likely than not, nothing fantastic).

I had to check out the desserts on our way, as I recall they were terrific on our last visit.  My wife and I ordered the Stoppe Trio, which is three meatballs (your choice of 3) served on top of polenta with a Stoppe Salad.  I had the Chicken Parmesan, the Crab Ball, and the Sausage Peppers and Onions.  My wife had the Traditional, the Chicken Marsala and the Chicken Parm as well.All of the meatballs were very good and very filling.  The polenta is exceptional. And, the sauces compliment the meat, no matter which you choose.   A guest at another table wanted vegetarian; and, they were able to easily accommodate her, with multiple choices!  For dessert, my wife opted for the free Cannoli with Yelp Check-in!  And, I had the Strawberry Cake, which our server said was one of the best!

We attended around lunchtime but there isn't really a lunch menu. Instead, there is a questionable \\"15% discount.\\" more on that later. Pricewise, they are higher than other hibachi places. We opted for the chicken and steak hibachi. I was on the fence about the sushi so we tried to play it safe with the Philly roll. The roll came out around 10 minutes before the cook even began.....ok. The food itself ended up not being very flavorful but was a fairly large portion. The roll itself wasn't all that good either. The staff was friendly which I appreciated.  There is, however, a 15% service charge attached to your bill. Basically they force a tip on your bill regardless if you felt like you got good service or not.

The bowl is pretty simple if you don't decide to add additional toppings, but no complaints here. The pork cha shu that came with my ramen was the ideal amount of fatty and tender, although I wish they gave you a little more meat. I asked for no bean sprouts since I'm not a huge fan of those. We also tried out the chicken karaage per our server's recommendation, and it was so good! Perfectly fried and juicy, plus it comes with a side of spicy mayo.

Finally got a chance to see how they pair up to my usual beloved jaunts.  Stepping into the restaurant, I was immediately impressed by the ambiance; Very romantic and dreamy like atmosphere.  Between the dim lights, garden like d√©cor and all the candles, it definitely sets the mood.  Our server and bartender were also very chill, approachable and familiar with the menu.  We opted to sit by the bar where you can watch your tapas being made which was a very cool view.   For tapas, we tried the following:Hake ceviche special - One of my favorites that night.  I love avocados and this was served with a whole one topped with the freshly made hake ceviche mix.  The sweet potato slices were packed with robust flavor and the crunchy roasted corns accented the dish nicely.  Note: It's not as citrusy as the normal ceviche so if you are looking for that bite, this may not exactly fit the bill.  4.5/5Mollejas de Pollo (chicken gizzards + saut√©ed onions in butter) - Didn't try personally but feedback was it was \\"okay\\" but would probably skip next time.  3/5Gnocchi de Yuca - The gnocchi was an odd shape but texture-wise was consistent with that pillowy melt in your mouth, \\"no need to chew apart\\" dumpling.  The one thing that took me by surprise was how strong the Cabrales cheese was as I've not had much experience with Spanish cheese.  A bit too pungent for me but for people who like strong cheeses, this would be a nice one to order.  3/5 for me, probably a 4/5 for most people. Atun Salteado con Ajonjoli (sesame seared tuna over sweet plantain) - Loved this dish.  Between the crunchy sesame on the tuna and the sweet baked plantain underneath, the combo of these topped with the microgreens were excellent together.  4.5/5Overall, a pretty good experience.  Food was different, even different from others for Spanish tapas.  Seems like they added their own twist to every dish so it's more fusion.  Unique and adventurous.  Some of these adventurous twists were winners like the ceviche and the tuna.  Others that were okay but we might pass next time are the chicken gizzards and the gnocchi."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"You know what?

I might have liked these better if they had the option to serve the sauce on the side. The wings come with a small portion of lettuce, probably meant more for presentation purposes, but I used it as a lettuce wrap.

After a good walk through Granville Island's market and Standley Park, we certainly built up an appetite for AYCE. We were going to check out a Malaysian restaurant in downtown Vancouver but at 7pm, it's cutting really close to \\"questionable\\" hours for tourist to be in the not-so friendly neighborhood.  Instead, we decided to drive back to Richmond and circulate for anything that looks interesting.We passed by the place and decided to check it out.  My fiance and I just wanted a simple ramen initially but after looking at their AYCE menu and their price, we decided to give it a try.  Some of our favorites were grilled black cod, salmon sashimi, hamachi sashimi, tai sashim, etc.  We weren't that crazy with the negiri but the sashimi were definitely really tasty!  The tuna was OK and I didn't like the spicy tuna at all.  Other hot food we enjoyed were short ribs and chicken wings.There were a few (maybe be negative) things that stood out from dining here.1) Not all items are unlimited.  Black cod has a limit to 2 pieces per paying customer and hamachi has a limit to 3 pieces per paying customer.2) Everything is 1 piece.  If you are ordering a gyoza or short ribs, it's really 1 little gyoza and 1 segment of the short ribs.  Pretty weird but so make sure you account for how many pieces you plan to have.3) 2-hr limit.  Even though, it's AYCE, there's a 2-hr limit of how much you can have.  Which also bring up the next negative point...4) Inconsistent service.  Our first order, the food came like super fast.  Second order was slower and even brought the wrong items.  Third order took them like forever to bring out and it was supposed to be our desserts.  I felt that they purposely did that so you won't have the full 2-hr limit dinner experience.  Overall, we were quite impressed with the quality and price.  For $19.99 and get somewhat unlimited sashimi, that's like a steal.  If they have that kind of price and selection in CA, they will be so packed all the time!"},{"name":"Mango Mango Dessert Atlanta","address":"5177-A Buford Hwy NE","city":"Doraville","stars":"4","text":"Pros:\\n* Absolutely delicious \\n* JUST the right amount of sweetness\\n* Different textures are combined and utilized\\n* Gorgeous dish presentation Cons:\\n* I can't think of any.I heard really good reviews on this place from my friends so I decided to try it out.

I had never been here so I was excited for the opportunity to try it at a slightly less expensive price point. The regular menu options were available but we both opted to do the restaurant week. This is a 3 course meal for $40. You pick 1 appetizer, main, and dessert each. Drinks (not included): I forget the name but we got what was equivalent to an Old Fashion. $12 each, beer was $7. Old Fashions are my go to drinks and I thought they did a pretty good job making it. The beer wasn't really worth it in my opinion.Appetizers: Grilled Baby Octopus & KRS Wagyu Short Rib Yakitori.They were both sooo good! The short rib was my favorite. We were told that it was smoked for over 8 hours! No wonder it was so tender. hmmmm yum.Main: 6oz filet mignon & Smoked Pork Tenderloin. I prefer the tenderloin over the filet but that's just because I'm not big on eating beef. We also got an additional side ($9) to supplement our meals, but it wasn't really worth it. The scallop sweet potatoes were nice, but not that nice. Plus, it was kind of salty. Dessert: Creme caramel with fresh berries (it's really just a flan) & Chocolate ganache cake. The cake was slightly bitter but complemented the flan very well. Sweet vs. bitter.Overall, I recommend coming here on a special occasion, during restaurant week to try it out, or just when you feel like splurging. Service was excellent as well.

We found ICOB by luck and we are so glad we did.In town for the Orioles vs Red Sox game, which was run at the same time as the Boston marathon.  A Holiday in Boston and a really special time.  Being the 6 year anniversary of the tragic marathon bombings, there was plenty of emotion in the air.The forecast called for rain all week.  Upon landing at Logan in the morning, the forecasters were spot on.  It was pouring.  So hard, that even the flight had to circle above to let the storm pass before safely landing.  Not the makings of a good day.However, we learned to navigate the T which was quite easy.  The shuttle bus from the airport to the blue line, the blue line to Government Center and then the green line to Kenmore,  All went off without a hitch.  Upon exiting the station at Kenmore we could see the marathon course and tons of security.  The rain had just stopped.  A few short blocks to Fenway and we were at the game.  Despite being covered in Oriole garb (Go O's) everyone was very friendly and accommodating.  The sun was shining the entire game.  The Orioles won.  Upon exiting the stadium we noticed it started to sprinkle.  Then pour.  Ugh.We were watching the runners on the course as we decided to run ourselves to stay dry.  We stumbled upon the ICOB.  There was a short line to get in but glad we waited.We were served by Kayla who was fantastic.  She helped us navigate the menu and made suggestions for us.  The Wellfleet oysters were yummy good as were the Narragansett beverages.  We would later add some fish tacos and some fried scallops and even more oysters.  Everything we ordered was fantastic.I can not say enough good things about this place.  Friendly and professional service, a great selection of food and drink and a clean environment.  The ICOB left us with a great impression of Boston for sure.  The prices were reasonable but if you take into account the atmosphere and value for the buck the prices were a steal.Upon leaving the ICOB we walked right to Kenmore, took the green light to Government Center and then the blue line to the airport and hopped on the flight home.  I could not think of a better way to spend 12 hours in Boston than to catch a baseball game, watch the marathon, eat a great meal, meet some awesome people, then return home for the night.If in Boston, do yourself a favor and visit the Island Creek Oyster Bar.

My choice was the:Chicken Livers: Benton's ham, caramelized onions, brioche, creamed corn, garlic jusIf you've ever cooked chicken livers yourself (all you squeamish ones, skip this paragraph), you'll know that it requires some handling, er, cleanup of sorts.  Well, the cleanup phase was overlooked for this app.  I ate around the sinewy parts and called it a day.  The garlic jus was delicious and the brioche was a soggy piece of bread. My entree choice was:Buttermilk Fried Chicken with garlic collards, bliss potatoes, honey-thyme jusStandard mashed potatoes, sauce wasn't a stand-out, collards were tasty but there was little of it.  The chicken didn't differ from any I've eaten elsewhere.  I actually got one drummette with extra meat and one-half of a breast. The half chicken breast serving was cut after cooking and the drummette covered over the exposed part of the breast.  It's ridiculous to charge that much for the plate that I got.Our dessert was pre-arranged since we were celebrating the upcoming birth of a friend's baby.  We got a tasty cake to share.

Unfortunately, that doesn't necessarily say that much.  The Good:\\n1) the hot food section- lots of variety and creativity in some of these dishes- stuffed prawns, noodle crab cakes, etc. \\n2) the grill section- meat quality was decent, nothing was overflavored at the grill.  \\n3) the cold food section- some cool \\"salads\\" using tuna and beef tataki- good stuff.\\n4) the sushi rolls were for the most part done well- with some combinations that I've never heard of (caramelized onion roll?  now that's getting creative with leftover ingredients!) The Bad: \\n1) the sashimi- oy.  Almost every kind of raw seafood I had prepared at this place had some flavors that shouldn't have been there.  The Uni was...ick.  Texture was just ok...but the flavor had a lingering fishy aftertaste- not good.  The salmon and tuna sashimi was cut like they were diced for stir fry or something.  Horrendous.  I don't expect the best quality fish at buffets, but presentation and preparation of sashimi (even in bulk) can be done better than what I saw.  2) sushi- yes, I know, I mentioned that the rolls were good for the most part- but their unagi sushi (not the nigiri but wrapped in seaweed over rice) tasted as if the unagi was some leftovers from a few days ago- mushy, soft, mashed up in sweet teriyaki sauce.  Ay. Again, this place IMO is good...for a buffet....but not THAT good.

Been reading some of the reviews and most complain about a long wait.  Bff and I got here about 1 p.m and were told it was only 20-30 minutes and if we could find a spot at either bar, go for it.  We walked to the back bar and there was a table, perfect for the two of us.  They had a roaring fire in the fireplace and were playing some real good classic rock n roll and our bartender/waitress back there was fantastic.  It was a bit further to walk to the buffet and weave thru the crowds (what was up with all the toddlers???), but it was worth it.The food has it's ups and downs.  The ups are definitely anything with salted pork!  Loved the jalapeno sausage and the sweet mapley ham.  The corned beef hash was also good as was the broccoli rice casserole and the steak and chicken planks.  The absolute standout (and our waitress said it was new that morning) was the pumpkin pecan cream cheese spread for the bagels.  We instantly tried to google the recipe to make it at home (didn't find it...may try to wing it...how hard can it be?).  The absolute letdown was the grits, which I was probably putting too much hope into as I love me some grits when done right and these were soupy and bland.  They're NOT my mommas grits for sure!  Some of the other dishes were meh also, including the chorizo eggs and the deviled eggs (no seasoning).  Also, bff put some of the poppy seed dressing on his fresh fruit and he was NOT happy with it.  Made the icky screwed up face and THEN offered me some.  I'm adventurous, but it tasted like sour paper.  Not good.  Eat your fruit naked, I always say.But this is why it's good to have a buffet.  You can put aside the not so great stuff and then just keep on stuffing yourself with the good stuff.  At $16 plus splitting an $18 carafe of mimosas, it tweren't cheap and I would probably hesitate to spend that again here.

I'd also like to point out how amazing clean the restrooms are lol very random but I am a stickler when it comes to restrooms at restaurants. If you have a gross restroom chances are I won't be back. That tells me a lot about the establishment and the pride they put into a place. I hate gross places.Anyway, we sat in the bar and ordered almost everything off the happy hour menu lol. The bartenders/servers were super nice and funny! Very chatty with us and great at recommending options. We had a couple drinks, chit chatted, ate great food and just enjoyed the great ambience of the place. The coolest part about the bar was the liquor display and impeccable wine selection they had. It's hard to chose a favorite thing on the menu I will say this; we ordered (amongst other things) both the mini prime cheeseburgers and the Filet mignon trio. Both were VERY good but if it was a tie breaker and I had to chose one it would most definitely be the mini prime cheeseburgers. They were absolutely delicious!!! I'm not huge on drinking anymore (maybe once a month if that) but my go to drink when I'm out is usually a mojito and the one i had here was great!

Throughout the years their dim sum has been consistently very good.  It is comparable to the quality of dim sum places in New York and Toronto.  While they don't have the huge variety that the heavily Chinese-populated cities have, the standards: roast pork bun, shrimp dumpling, siu mai, egg custard and rice noodle rolls (I believe they call them rice paste here) is excellent.  Their beef chow fun and pan-fried noodles are also favorites of mine.  They have a variety of Chinese teas you can order from: Jasmine, Oolong and Chrysanthemum.  Note there is no green tea.If you're not familiar with dim sum, they have a picture menu that you may peruse.  You pick the dishes you want from a list and they bring it out when it's ready.  If it's busy, it can take a while so submit your order slip as soon as you can.  They can only steam so many things at once so you may get certain things piece-meal.  For instance I put in for 2 orders of roast pork bun, but I got one relatively quickly and then 10 minutes later got the other one.  Like a previous reviewer stated, I would not expect top notch service here.  Not to make excuses, but it's the culture.  Things get lost in translation and the servers can come across very blunt.They have dim sum daily, but do note that their dim sum master goes on vacation to China for a month once a year so that would not be the best time to go.  They usually tape a note on the door when he is out of the country so you'll know before heading in.  Depending on what day of the week and time, this place can get really busy.  We always get there by 11:30 to make sure we get a right-sized table for our party.  There are quite a bit of tables for 4, but if you have a larger party they only have 4 larger-sized tables.The owners are typical Chinese restaurant owners.  I've been going to their restaurants even before Golden Lotus so they are friendly to my family (really my parents because I'm not sure they recognize me).  It does help to have someone who speaks Cantonese in your party who can read the menu.  There are a few dishes that are only written in Chinese for some reason like the pan fried steamed buns that we enjoy.  They also make a good steamed soup dumpling (Xiao Long Bao), but that particular dish is not quite comparable to the ones at Nan Xiang Dumpling House in Flushing, New York.  ;-)"},{"name":"Smoke Ring","address":"309 Nelson St SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"This place was pretty much empty when we walked inside.

So I took my food with me to go and when I opened up the box, it had the most interesting odor. The food smelled like a burnt or dirty grill and you could definitely taste it in the food. I tried to mask the flavor/odor with siracha and soy sauce because I was so hungry. I eventually threw away what was left of my meal because it just tasted so bad and I couldn't get over the smell/taste.

This time wasn't the greatest. I went late on a Saturday night with my sister and friend. We decided to sit on the patio. We ordered the smoked wings with buffalo as an appetizer.the wings were actually pretty good, but took some time to come out. While there was a large party there, it honestly wasn't that many people. I also got the local lemonade to drink which was pretty good.During our weighting experience an unwanted guest decided to appear which was off putting. I'm not 100% blaming the restaurant because we're in the city and outside, but yeah seeing a rat was not fun. It was along the brick wall in which I was sitting on I might add. Needless to say we all jumped from the table before it could get to us. A group that was there left while my party and another were offered seats inside. Let's just say that rat was never found. Upon moving inside we were told there had been an issue with the printers, but it got fixed and our food would be coming up shortly. It was maybe 10:30 by the time we got it and that point I wasn't very hungry anymore nor could my body handle the amount of food given. They definitely give generous portions of food. I got the nacho totchos which were really good, but I just couldn't eat most of it because it was late and I somewhat lost my appetite. I didn't take it home because it just would have been soggy. I did enjoy the crispiness of the tots though. They did have to take my dish back to the kitchen because it was suppose to have grilled chicken on it and mine didn't have any on it. My sister got the white bean chicken chili and it was cold, and our friend said her chicken sandwich didn't have much taste so there were definitely some misses on this visit. Our waitresses were nice though. There was a girl training and I think she did really well and was good overall. I was looking forward to going since I haven't been in awhile, but it definitely wasn't what I expected this time. I also noticed their rating was an 83 which had me a bit leary, but since I've been a number of times before I didn't really think anything of it.

Decided to try a new restaurant tonight at C & S Oyster Bar because I wanted oysters. Thought the food and service from bartender was good. In the restaurant at the bar after eating and we smell cigarette smoke inside the establishment. We see one of the Caucasian guest smoking at a booth behind us and simply ask the guest to please put out the cigarette and they all (4) react and say why the fuk you watching or looking at us. One of those guest decide to now give us the middle finger and say you (black males) are not privileged to look at us (god help me) and orders us to turn around (praying). He continues to say turn the fuk around and don't look at us (still praying) and fuk you. I replied God Bless YOU! The other individual that was actually smoking says \\"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AND GET THESE NIGGAS OUT OF HERE\\" they don't belong here. The manager is called over and says he will look at the video immediately for the smoking incident but, after being asked a few times he says he doesn't have access to the video (after you said you would review the video). He goes over to the white male guests and they are irate and loud with him and they all say they (black males) were loud with them (they are the victim now). We only asked if they were smoking  and to please put it out. The video is never reviewed and the manager walks back over after being asked multiple times to review the video with an envelope that has a $100 gift card and says I know they (4 white males) were the ones who started this and I am sorry so please come back. While doing so he places himself in position so that the (4) individuals behind us can't see he is giving us a gift card which I consider as quiet money for the evening. Nope and while it is appreciated and $100 is cool for most but, not me and after having an experience like this for the first time ever. I refuse and will never tolerate this PERIOD! A lady that was sitting on the other side the entire time and comes over and says to try and have a good night.

When asked if I had any ideas where to stop for lunch, all I could think of was Pok Pok because every person I told about my trip to Portland all said the same thing....\\"go to Pok Pok or you'll be sorry.\\"  I wasn't sure if that was a threat, or they meant they just really liked it....but I wasn't taking any chances.  Before we even stopped at our hotel, we were on our way.This isn't your usual Thai fare and I was pleased to see that and excited to try some things I've never had before.  So here is what we stuffed our tired faces with:Ikes Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings:  First of all these aren't tiny little wings, they're big and you get 6 of them.  I shared, but I could have kept them all to myself.  They are worthy of the praise they are given.  They're marinated in sugar and fish sauce, deep fried and tossed in garlic and caramelized fish sauce and served with a refreshing side of pickled daikon and carrots.  They were tender, juicy and bursting with flavor....it was heaven.  Papaya Pok Pok Salad:  Well balanced, refreshing, sweet, spicy, tangy, crunchy papaya, a little bit of chewiness from the dried shrimp.  It was everything a papaya salad should be.....wish I had tried it Isaan style (with extra spicy dried chili) though.  Hoi Thawt:  Crispy broken crepe with mussels, egg, garlic, chives and bean sprouts served with sriracha.  Lots of mussels and good rich flavor but not overwhelmingly so thanks to the bean sprouts.  Cha Ca \\"La Vong\\":  Catfish medallions fried in turmeric oil with scallions and dill served over rice vermicelli.  They don't skimp on the fish, there is plenty of it and it is GOOD.  The dill added a really nice touch and much needed brightness to the dish.  Make sure you pour the sauce over and mix well so it gets on the noodles!  I NEEDED a cocktail and so I turned to their specials board and asked the waitress what she suggested.  She said the Gin Rummy (gin, rum, lemon juice and thai basil ) was really different and though it sounded a bit boring to me, I decided to trust her and I'm glad I did.  I didn't expect it to be as good as it was and it really complimented the food perfectly.  So, bottom line, if anyone tells me they're going to Porland, I too will now threaten \\"go to Pok Pok or you'll be sorry!!!\\" though I will add \\"and please bring home some chicken wings for me.\\""},{"name":"Lighthouse Lobster Feast","address":"7675 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"2.5","text":"Let me start off with, we love seafood.

I ordered the Spaghetti Mare E Monti and my friend ordered the Linguine Alle Vongole. My friends Vongole was pretty flavorless.

They only put in a very thin layer of sushi rice, which was nice and light and made all other ingredients stand out.\\nUni pasta - I'm not a big fan of this dish. The noodles tasted very similar to instant ramen and the sauce was a bit too heavy and rich for me. The uni in it was fully cooked and covered in the sauce. I'd probably like it better if the uni was raw.\\nGreen tea tiramisu - the green tea matcha at the bottom was very refreshing and paired really well with the sweetness of the tiramisu.

Some components of the mains were a bit confusing: all the fish in the bouillabaisse was cooked perfectly; however, the broth consistency was a bit thick and tasted very minerally - it gave the dish more of a chowder mouth feel. The trout again was cooked perfectly, but the beurre blanc tasted rather sweet and did not compliment the delicate texture of the  trout. The desserts were good and comforting. We would be inclined to return to try the menu again. The service was spectacular - both the maitre d' and server were very genuine and knowledgeable.

This restaurant serves mostly Chiang Mai and Issan regional/specialty dishes. This is not your typical Thai restaurant, so if you come here expecting Pad Thai, Pad See Eew, Tom Yum soup, or any other safe Thai dishes, you'll be disappointed or pleasantly surprised. I'm pleasantly surprised this is super popular because most of the items (if not all) are foreign to people who have never been to Thailand, and most dishes are full of fish sauce and vinegar. I was excited to see some of my favorite Thai dishes on the menu: Khao Soi (Chiang Mai), Khanom Jeen (Southern Thailand), and Goong Op Woon Sen (Mainland).Space: This place literally looked like it came straight from Thailand. The decor is on point from the metal shack roof, plastic tacky table cloth, to the colorful Christmas lights.Wait time: 2.5 hours (note: we came on a Saturday at 6:30pm on Labor Day weekend, but we were determined). There is a sister restaurant across the street called Whiskey Soda Lounge to alleviate the high demand of Pok Pok (totally a restaurant name you'd see in Thailand, but it's funny to see people walk by and get confused with the English name of the restaurant and songs by popular Thai rock artist Loso blasting). Most people can wait there and the waitress will coordinate with Pok Pok when they call you. If you only want to eat their super famous chicken wings, they serve them here too without the 2.5 hour wait time. The wait time was still 2 hours by 9pm. Insane!Parking: Easy. There are plenty of street parking around the neighborhoods, but read the signs carefully.Price: It's pretty expensive for Thai food. Expect to pay around $15-$25 for a dish.What we ordered:\\n1. Chicken wings --- we ordered this at the sister restaurant, Whiskey Soda Lounge, while we were waiting.\\n2. Yam Kai Deaw\\n3. Goong Op Woon Sen1. Excellent. Chicken wings in Vietnamese fish sauce. $15 for 6 pieces. There are 2 options: spicy and non-spicy. I loved the spicy version, and my sis loved the non-spicy version. You can order half the order to be spicy and the other half non-spicy. The wings are pretty big for chicken wings. It's crispy, sweet, and tender. Lived up to the hype, and probably the best chicken wings I've ever had.2. Great. It's a salad with pieces of fried egg with fish sauce. I loved it. It's probably my second favorite next to the chicken wings. That being said, it does have the fish sauce and vinegar taste that all the \\"yam\\" dishes have. My sis thought it was too salty. To each their own.3. Okay. This is glass noodles with prawns, pieces of pork (pork belly or bacon), and onions in a clay pot. I didn't love it, and I didn't hate it. I think they didn't put enough mixture water, so the glass noodle didn't have the right texture. They also put too much dark soy sauce.Overall, I enjoyed the food, but it'll probably be a while before I come back again because of the price and wait time, which I imagine is typical for that restaurant because it's so popular."},{"name":"Baraka Cafe","address":"812 Memorial Dr","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Don't bother making reservations. We made reservations for four, only to arrive at the appointed time and find no tables available.  The owner brusquely told us that the restaurant was full and that we would have to wait.  Eventually we left, and went to another restaurant up the street that served us a delicious dinner. 25 minutes after leaving, the cell phone rings.  It is Baraka Cafe on the line wanting to know why we left, and informing us that the wait was only 10 minutes and that a table would soon open up for us.  Really?

LITERALLY THE WORST. I decided to take my significant other somewhere \\"nice\\" on Saturday November 10, 2018. After perusing google for what i had hoped would be an authentic Japanese dining experience i came across Nori Nori.After driving 35 mins into Cobb County we arrived to a crowded restaurant which has signs up stating \\"pardon our dust\\" as they were in the process of painting walls and remodeling floors. The fact that i had to view open ceiling panels and exposed concrete floors was a cake walk compared to the horrendous level of disrespect and disregard we received not only from wait staff but from the manager (Gabriel) and the owner (\\"Mr. lee\\" who wasnt even professional enough to grace an unhappy patron with his presence.) Anyway.... Upon arrival we were asked to wait 5 mins to be seated. That was no issue... The problem is that after the wait the inexperienced teenage girl who was on duty as hostess seated us at another couples table while they were in line at the buffet. She asked us what we would like to drink and gave us the ok to go ahead and start getting our plates. As i return to what i thought was my table i realize the young black woman whose shoes i complemented in passing near the wasabi was planted there with her boyfriend. She looks at me and immediately understands the mistake. \\"They sat you at our table, didnt they?\\", she asked. I replied \\"Yes\\". The young lady informs me she told the server what had happened. She also told me the server was supposed to be finding somewhere else to seat us. I thought to myself well how when they hadnt even found ME...? After getting the scoop on how they had been experiencing poor service since walking in I decided to make my way back to the hostess stand. With a plate of sushi in my hand and the entire restaurant gawking at the large black man who was CLEARLY annoyed i complained that my date and i had been seated at another couples table. The hostess hardly apologized and quickly removed empty cups from another table and wiped it off for us to sit at while it dried..... After eating my first plate i notice another black couple was being seated beside us. After they had gotten up to grab plates from the buffet line ANOTHER black couple was seated in their seats. Mind you, the lady had left her purse hanging on thethe arm of the chair. It took a full 3 mins before wait staff figured it out amongst themselves. At this point im seeing that there is a significant difference in how the staff is caring for BLACK CUSTOMERS. Not once did a waiter come back to the table to check on us or refill our drinks. We actually had to stop someone and ask. Once we had finished eating we decided to complain and asked for a manager. Gabriel (a slender Asian man. Well groomed. Soft spoken) saunters over and patiently listens to the issue. He stops me in the middle to assure me that this is a family establishment and they cater to all customers accordingly regardless off race or gender or anything like that. Its clear that he was able to deduct exactly how it came off because i hadnt even finshed telling him the levels of disregard we had experienced. My significant other asks that something at the very least be removed from the bill. Gabriel (the manager) explains that he doesn't have the authority to alter the bill and he would have to have the owner Mr. Lee come over and talk to us about it. After another 7 mins of waiting and watching every employee from wait staff to sushi chef be alerted and look directly at us as though there is an issue Gabriel saunters back to our table and apologizes for not having the authority to make any changes and tells us politely that MR LEE says no..... I informed Gabriel that i would be leaving this scathing review for Mr Lee and Nori Nori on Google and Yelp and any other site i could find and with every ounce of rich black bitch i could muster counted out the bill from a wad of cash and left..Never EVER AGAIN NORI NORI.\\n."},{"name":"Bistro du Midi","address":"272 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Updating this review!The manager Federico very kindly reached out to me after my previous review and made an effort to have the 5 of us back again for lunch this week.

As a lifetime platinum elite member I've stayed at hundreds of Marriott properties and have gotten used to impeccable customer service. Unfortunately, this was not the case at this location. It started approximately early November when my fiancee and I went to the JW to evaluate the property for our upcoming wedding which we ultimately had at Ritz Carlton's Normans restaurant. At the JW we spoke to a manager to see if he could guarantee an early check in Dec 3rd (the day of our wedding). He said he could not and we agreed to book my fiancee's suite the day before the wedding even though it wasn't required. I would check into my suite Dec 3rd. Several days later I checked online and noticed that both suites had been booked for check in on Dec 2nd.  I called JW and resolved that issue and booked a regular room for my father. The day of my wedding I arrived only to be told that I do not have a suite and I'm booked for a regular room. In addition I had made it well known to Marriott that this was a special day. The receptionist I dealt with was apathetic and cold. It was obvious to me that she could care less and that this was my problem. Come to find out the JW gave my suite to my father. I do not know how it happened since he was never listed as a guest to my room and his name was listed on another standard room. Once I realized what happened I called my father and he had to pack up his belongings and move to the other room. Meanwhile the receptionist never even apologized. As you can imagine I was already stressed for my big day and JW was making it exponentially worse with their incompetence and poor service. When I checked out on Dec 4th, JW denied my request for a checkout at 2pm. I was given a bill for $7595.56 which was appropriate (Normans bill was placed on my account). I received a call from my father the next day stating that somehow JW charged his american express $7595.56, $99.98, and $6876.70 for a total of $14572.24.  None of the charges were appropriate and we have no idea why his card was used to begin with. Once again I was calling the JW. Half the time I called i would get hung up on while on hold. When I finally reached a manager, Emily, (on 12/6) she stated that she would fix the situation immediately. The next evening rolled around and I still had no word back as promised. I called back the next evening and had to complain again that I wanted the bill resolved immediately. Finally on 12/13 the charges were removed from my fathers credit card. Every interaction that I had with JW seemed laden with incompetence. I've never experienced it at Marriott's before and unfortunately it seems like a systemic problem at this particular location.Update- manager called me and made things right. Even though JW dropped the ball. Marriott always takes care of its customers!Update- about 2 weeks have passed since the  last update and low and behold another $1595 charge on my credit card from JW. Unbelievable!! Now I'm back to calling these jokers again. with as many times that I've had to call this place I should save them as one of my favorites. I've never dealt with a Marriott hotel so poorly run."},{"name":"Wings Over Somerville","address":"519 Somerville Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"2.5","text":"It was alright there was a lot of sauce options I've probably tried 7 different kinds and there has only been 1 that I would order again.

We asked them to choose a local popular place to try and they suggested Pok Pok cause of the wings and cause it's close to their place. The restaurant was cute and authentic looking- actually reminds me of one of those sidewalk restaurants in Asia with the stool seats at the bar and the wooden tables! Although I did not see any Thai staff/cooks, I read that the chef had actually lived in Thailand for a bit studying and learning about Thailand's food culture. oooo i seee!Arrived at 7:45 and the hostess said the wait was about 45 minutes for our party of 4. So we put our name down and walked around the area. Location is great to walk around while we waited cause there were so many other shops to look at. We stopped by a boba place a few blocks down and caught up. When our table was ready, they shot us a text letting us know and that they'll keep your table for 10 minutes!Sat at a table near the front so we were semi-outside feeling the warm summer breeze.

Half dozen chicken wings marinated in fish sauce and sugar, deep fried, tossed in caramelized Vietnamese fish sauce and garlic served with Cu Cai (pickled vegetables). This is Pok Pok's SIGNATURE DISH! We got the wings in both spicy and non spicy. I personally REALLY liked the spicy ones more; so much flavor and had that spicy kick at the end where you're breathing though your mouth from the spiciness all while still licking your fingers AND reaching for another wing. Chicken was moist and really captured all the spices and flavors even down to the bone sucking part.... If you can take the heat, GET the spicy ones! (5/5)NEUA NAAM TOK ($15.75)\\nSpicy Isaan flank steak salad w/ fish sauce, lime, and chili powder dressing, shallots, lemongrass, mint, cilantro, and toasted rice powder. We ate this with some sticky rice and it was deliciously SPICYY. One of my favorite \\"appetizers\\" i should say. It's pretty darn small in portion for the price, like a little dish. but the flavors and spices are off the charts good. Not something for those who can't take any spicy at all...my spicy-attemtping bf died after a bite of this (4.5/5)KHAO SOI ($15.75)\\nMild Muslim style beef curry noodle soup made with complex dry spice mixture and topped with coconut cream. Served with house pickled mustard greens, shallots, crispy yellow noodles and roasted chili paste. Needs more flavor! Noodle texture was great but the whole dish was a bit bland to me... Looks better than it tasted (3/5)POK POK SPECIAL ($20)\\nHalf roasted Mary's chicken with small green papaya salad, sticky rice, and dipping sauce. This one was alright.. I really LOVE papaya salad and this was the only dish I initially wanted to try besides the wings but while ordering, we decided heck why not just get the pok pok special cause it comes with chicken. Thank god for this cause the papaya salad was actually kinda bland and flavorless so the chicken definitely substituted for it. Chicken was moist and very meaty. My cousins bf went to town with this half roasted hen. (3/5) Overall, not bad but not WOWing great experience with the food. I liked the spice factor for some of the dishes such as the spicy fish sauce wings and the flank steak salad. But the other dishes such as papaya salad and curry noodle soup needed more seasoning.

Guy had done a show on their wings (Ike's Vietnamese fish sauce wings). It was so good. We had both their regular and and spicy wings. Spicy is not spicy. Maybe not Asian spicy but it was hardly anything to write home about.We also ordered the  Curry noodle soup with chicken, pork belly (Kaeng Hang Leh), beef (Jin Hoom), boar (Much Paa Kham Waan).  I  liked their Curry. It also could have been spicier but I wasn't ready to put a glob of chili in my soup.  The Curry came with lime, shallots, pickles and a chili sauce.  The beef was disappointingly tough but the pork belly was more tender. We asked for rice: sticky and Jasmine. I did not try their sticky rice but our party said it was good.  I wished we ordered their coconut rice.I also wished we tried their \\n catfish. When I went to their bathroom the food review posted on the wall said their signature is the catfish.They have several dining areas both inside and out. Since we were sitting more in their \\"patio\\" area, they had a nice heater and it was enclosed with plastic/tarp.Our server was great. Sasha patiently explained the menu to us and how to eat certain things. I like that they have pitchers of water at each table. It helps so that we're not asking for water.We got there right when they were open so we were seated right away.Menus are simple with \\"drinks\\" stamped on the corresponding side.

I haven't been so disappointed by food in such a long time.I liked the shack/restaurant set up, reminded me of how it was like when I went to Thailand a few months ago. They have an outside heated area and a indoor area, both have limited seating. Street meter parking, I found parking right away but it seems like it would be difficult if it is really busy.There was a line to get seated at 11:30 am on a Saturday, but it was not super crowded, we just had to wait to get seated. Service was friendly. Food came out pretty quickly.Chili Peanuts - Complementary - Best thing I had here and it was FREE!Kaeng Hang Leh - $15.50 - I expected this braised/stewed pork belly and shoulder to be tender and melt in your mouth soft but it was like dry and felt like I was chewing jerky. The curry was good with rice but the meat was a total disaster. Price vs portion, you get 2 small pieces of meat, total rip off. And it is super annoying this type of dish would not come with rice. Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings - $15.50 - I have dreamed about eating these wings and I was so sad after. These wings were basically fried drenched in pure fish sauce. A total salt bomb. My tongue was so dry and salty after the first bite, it totally killed my palate. Even the pickles could not wake my taste buds back up. I could not taste anything but salt all day. The wings were fried well but that sauce was not made well at all and took away all the flavor of the chicken. The chili powder that makes it spicy was not spicy as all. Lastly, you only get 6 wings for this price!!!Jasmine Rice - $2.50 - Are you freaking kidding me with this price!Way overpriced and overrated!

Nothing like a night of Thai food to cleanse the palate before moving on to Creole and Cajun fare.I laugh every time that I read a review and someone complains that there's no Pad Thai at Pok Pok. What? No servings of Thailand's national dish, the one that has become a cliche at every two-bit place that has no concept of authentic Thai cuisine? And that's exactly why owner Andy Ricker doesn't have it on the menu. He wants customers to become familiar with more than one dish from Thailand, where he travels often. I ordered the Khao Man Som Tam, which paired a traditional green papaya salad with sweet, shredded pork and coconut rice. Popular throughout Southeast Asia, the salad was packed with dried shrimp, papaya, chiles, lime juice, tamarind, peanuts and other ingredients. Spicy and sour. Wonderful.The marinated pork came with shallots and cilantro. It was also wonderful. I didn't order them this time, but Ike's wings are one of the single-best dishes I've tasted in my life. Developed by Pok Pok employee Ich \\"Ike\\" Truong, they are an adaptation from his family's recipe. The recipe was included in the Pok Pok cookbook and I've made them several times at home, where they're just as good.Service was friendly and attentive. Luckily, we came early on a late Friday afternoon and got seated before the crowds showed up. I've long admired Ricker, who also supports other local restaurants.

There's a couple of couches and tables, and you can also order drinks in the waiting area.We were seated at a high top, which fit the 5 of us perfectly. We were immediately served waters, and a bottle of water was left on the table. I really like the space. Super high ceilings, dark atmosphere, and a modern feel.I got a taster with the Witbier, Oatmeal Stout, and I can't remember the other 2. My favourite was the Oatmeal Stout, although I've had better ones. Throughout the night, our server came by to check on us, and refilled our waters as well. I really like the level of service. There was live music as well. They have a large projection screen that rolls up when not in use. The place is not infiltrated with bright glaring TV screens.

My husband came here once when he visited Austin for a work conference and loved it, so he made sure I tried the food here too. We went there around 5:30pm on a Saturday and waited for about 20 mins. First impressions: the waiter was super friendly and gave a short spiel on Southern hospitality and how most food here are fried and delicious. Lol. Their complimentary popcorn is to die for. Me and my husband gobbled up the whole thing before our appetizers arrived. I'm not sure what is in the popcorn but that salty goodness was in every single kernel of popcorn! Howw????We got their Southern Grit Cake, Chicken Fried Steak (its not chicken!), Shrimp & Grits and Apple Pie. We were both totally comatose in the end. Coming from LA you don't get much grits and the grits here were absolutely amazing. You can taste the freshness of the shrimp which was something I wasn't expecting at all. So thank you!!! Apple pie was super delicious too, especially with the vanilla ice cream, not sour at all. Unfortunately I didn't think their Hard Lemonade with an added midnight moon peace was anything special (recommendation from the waiter). They didn't have paper straws too which was a little disappointing since you would think that a fancy-super-popular establishment like this, in the middle of youthful Austin, would still serve plastic straws.

Let me start off saying, that every single thing I have ever eaten here, from the salads and hummus, to any meal I've tried, is absolutely fantastic.  And the customer service is great.  One of my recent visits, I brought my sister to introduce her to this food.  She couldn't even enjoy it however, due to being disgusted by some cleanliness issues, including our dirty water and juice glasses, and a dead insect in one of the salt shakers.  I understood why she was unhappy, and I know she will not be returning here herself any time soon.  My last visit, I was the one unhappy with some cleanliness issues.  The table itself was not as clean as I would have liked, and the decorative plant on the cut-out in the wall over our table, was covered in a huge layer of dust.  I tried to ignore it, but I felt uneasy and uncomfortable the whole time. I feel like being honest about my concerns is possibly the only way this restaurant can improve, and I hope they do, because the thought of never returning due to feeling uneasy about eating here, is not a happy thought to me.

The bagel could be toasted a little crispier, but as is it was doughy and delicious. I also got a vanilla iced coffee. They go pretty heavy on the cream and sweetener which I'm a fan of, but you may want to ask them to go lighter on it if you prefer your coffee a little less dessert-y. It's clear that it's a pretty popular place for locals, most of the people there seemed to be regulars.

Like I said many times, too much competition for bakeries and tea shops on Buford Hwy... but as a consumer, I guess no complaints here.My main objective for my first visit was to grab the bulb bottle novelty that only the peach and earl gray milk tea comes in.  I ordered the peach drink so I got my bulb bottle but thought it was a bit too sweet and preferred my matcha bean milk tea over it.  FYI, the peach drink was $5.50 compared to regular milk teas at $4 due to the bottle. What I really liked about the milk teas here was that when you tell them 30% sugar, it really felt like 30% sugar.  I'm sure it's not always consistent as it can vary based on who makes the drinks but loved the matcha beans and how it tasted like I was essentially drinking patbingsu (korean summer dessert). I did add tapioca, but regretted it since red beans alone was good.  So for the reason that I feel like I can actually control the sugar level at 30, 50, 70, and 100%, I will come back.

They had plenty of vegetarian/vegan options so I took a brief five minute walk from the Hilton Back Bay. I was lucky to arrive when I did because five minutes after I was seated, there was a big rush. The place is not a large place so it can get filled quickly. I started with crispy rolls (Cha Gio Chay)and a lychee shake (mouth watering, yet?). That shake was super creamy and filled up the entire glass. It was sinful. I also ordered the red vegetable curry with vegetarian ham. It came with a super big pile of rice that I would be ashamed to finish. I mean, if I'm gonna eat carbs, I'm not gonna pig out on one of the worst kinds. But that's just coming from a girl wanting to stay in bathing suit shape until August. :-D Anyhoo, the crispy rolls were small... and crispy and came with a peanut sauce that was really tasty but overpowered the delicate flavors of the roll. The red curry sauce and veggies was delicious! There was a slight kick of heat on there somewhere, but I quite enjoyed it. When I was done, they closed me out immediately, probably because they needed to turn the table quickly because it was really busy. The service itself was really good, too. My waitress was attentive and kept checking on me. \\nOne more thing... I noticed that there were other noodle houses, or Asian inspired restaurants in the same strip on the street. I also spied with my little eye, that almost half of the customers in the restaurant were Asians. I think that speaks volumes for the authenticity and flavor of their food.

Every employee made eye contact with us, every employee said hello, how are you, how is your day, have a nice day, thank you for staying with us, etc.  From the moment we arrived we felt very very welcome and relaxed.  Special honorable mention to Lauren at the front desk.  She had a back up phone charger I borrowed one night (more important than a toothbrush, I might dare to say!) and she found my wife a courtesy pair of (new) cell phone ear buds she could have to make her morning jog survivable.  Outstanding customer service!2) the rooms were spacious and felt extra roomy, being arranged a bit unconventionally, with the bed facing the window wall instead of the TV wall, the windows opened (a bit) for some cool evening air and not-at-all disturbing sounds of the city below.  Also, the blackout screens on the windows worked so much better than conventional draperies.3) the housekeepers put a hand written note on the bed before we arrived , wishing us a comfortable stay, offering to help out with anything extra we might need.

I recommended we eat at Moonshine since he was on the next block, if the wait time was reasonable. He arrived before me and was quoted 30-45 minutes. He checked in at 7:12pm. Too good to be true! (...it was). With parking I arrived about 30 minutes into his wait. We got a drink and caught up so time wasn't too much of an issue at this moment. We hit the 50 minutes mark so he took it upon himself to go get an update. Upon returning he said the host (girl with glasses and dark hair in a bun) told him \\"it'll be soon\\". Okay, sure. I work in a restaurant doing what she does during SXSW myself so I simply told my friend that everywhere is going to be busy, it would be worth the wait, and I'm sure tables are taking longer to get up than expected or she under-estimated her wait time. (Clearly). An hour and 15 minutes into the wait my friend was getting (hangry) and seeing as we were almost at double the original wait time, he took it upon himself to check one last time, with the same \\"it'll be soon response\\". At 8:47pm we decided to leave. \\nI will definitely come back because I do love eating here. My 3 starts is unrelated to the food but is instead aimed at host training. Hosts can't control what their floor does, but they can control the wait time given to the guest. You know it's SXSW, maybe be a little more realistic and plan ahead with your waitlist. I would have much rather been told the wait was more than likely 2 hours instead of 30-45, wasting time we could've spent going somewhere else.

They open 7am-2pm so you can totally make a brunch trip if breakfast is too early. This place was recommended to me a long time ago. While in Orlando just this current week a friend reminded me to stop at MSBC for breakfast. After looking at the pictures here on Yelp, I was between The Reinhold or The Farmer sandwiches and ended up going with The Farmer. I truly enjoyed every bite of that along with a side of Hashups that I shared with my husband. If you get full quickly I'd recommend sharing the Hashups vs. having it as a side alone. The sandwich alone is quite filling and highly recommended to have from this restaurant. The sauce that's in this sandwich is good for the sweet and salty taste of this deliciousness. If you're like me that likes sauce in food, but not to drench your food in it just ask for 'easy on the sauce'. The sauce is a must though so don't remove it completely. Next time I will ask for easy on the sauce as this sandwich comes with a lot more than I'd prefer.

This kind of dish is always my favorite.  So savory and the pork was cooked perfect.  I wanted to drink the broth.  Mix it with rice and you won't stop eating this!\\n- catfish with vermicelli: 4/5. Fried catfish with noodles. I love the fragrant oil and the herbs with it.  The catfish was ok; bland for me. However, I'll eat that noodles by itself! Best vermicelli for me!\\n- papaya salad: my least favorite.  That was... wrong.  Service was excellent by the way. Definitely, reservations are a must.

It was my wife's friend, a priest of a different religion than we, who suggested we try it and it was my wife's 66th birthday.But you are interested in the food, not how much I enjoyed the atmosphere and the great time we had. First the wine. we love Moscato and this was unlike and better than any we had previously tried. It was a sweet, white, and soft. Absolutely the best Moscato either of us had ever drunk.  We drank a bottle out of beautiful small wine glasses. My wife said she has never had so much wine at one meal before (that really does not say much, she usually on has one small class)One treat was the small portions of the foods we ordered so that we could taste a variety of their foods. The disadvantage is that you end up with an expensive dinner, but it is the Italian way of eating and I enjoy it and am willing to pay for it. I am told, but have not tried to go lunchtime where patrons told me the lunch specials are huge and delicious.We had a Caprese salad that my wife thought it was the best she could remember having. It was served differently and in a larger portion than average.Minestrone soup came next that was unique in flavor, though familiar and suburb. Thick and flavorful - mind-blowing.The pesto was a beautiful shade of green and delicious came next. A simple dish that was a treat for us because of its simplicity and bright green color.Lasagna. OMG, what a smoothe, cleaver dish they made. People around had suggested we try it because it was their favorite. You could not tell which was cheese and which was noodle because both were so smoothe. The meat was also very fine and oh so delicious. I think that it will be on my favorite list when we go back.They brought us a surprise dessert Tiramisu for two. Let's just say, it was incredible as was the presentation. The waiter was attentive despite the absolutely packed and demanding crowd and he just appeared when we needed him and disappeared when we didn't! The tip was commensurate with the service and was sizable - significantly more than 20%.But it was the life and joy of the patrons that make it so memorable. The 30-year-old couple who sat at the next table has been going there for 10 years.

For this trip, I was able to pick up Harry Potter in Italian for my friend who started collecting them. I was surprised when I saw it but it was reasonably priced and so I bought it.

I just couldn't stop eating! The hummus platter had an eggplant dip, wilted greens dip, and pureed fava bean dip.

There aren't a lot of Middle Eastern options in the Vancouver area, so if there aren't many, than the few there are should be pretty great, right?  Wrong!I ordered the falafel lunch plate and the first thing I noticed was the sticker going over the original menu item with handwriting on it.  I peeled back the sticker and turns out rather than print and laminate some new menus they opted for the sticker to show the new price, an increase of $1.  Never a good sign when you do that, really cheapens the look and feel of your restaurant.  I should have known better and left right there.Food came out quickly, and I instantly felt ripped off.  The plate hardly had any food on it.  4-5 fork fulls of various cabbage and parsley salads, a dollop at best of hummus, and five thumb sized little falafels that were obviously from a bulk dry mix.  No green garlicky goodness you come to expect from traditional and well made falafel.  Pita bread was decent, but it was warmed up from a package, not house made.  Sorry to say this, but you can get better quality at a food truck.  Cutting corners ends up cutting your profits!If you can believe it, the lunch was $10!!!!  Add in tax and a tip and I was out $12.  For that price for lunch there should be a decent value, so I don't appreciate it at all.  It was like they took the fixings normally reserved for one sandwich and just spread them out over a plate.   As a customer, I'm pretty offended and I will not be returning to Jerusalem Cafe again.  Compared to any Middle Eastern restaurant in Portland, this is pretty low and I don't like having to say that, because I know how much work goes into running an eating establishment.  It's a ton of hours, very labor intensive, and you don't always make much money.There are some nice points however.  They have a very clean restaurant, and it's very nicely decorated and it has a very welcoming feel and in no sense did I get the feeling they were intentionally trying to rip anyone off.  They just need to seriously have a look at what other restaurants are doing that serve their same type of food and rethink things.  They tried to have a Jerusalem Cafe in Portland but it went out of business in a matter of months.  Now I can see why.

There was nothing wrong with their fried chicken, it's just the flavor of the skin/dough of Noraneko's chicken was right for me.

The satisfaction ranged from 2-5; hence the 3 star rating for food. Note: if I could rate the waiter, I would give him 5 stars!Two people ordered rice dishes, specifically the Beef Don that came with tender beef, onions, red ginger and a soft egg; and the Chicken Katsu Don which had crispy chicken cutlets coated in panko and deep fried, also served with a soft egg and over rice.  Both scoffed down their bowls and enjoyed every bite. They said they would rate the Don a 4. Good, satisfying but nothing that made it next level.Another ordered the Tokyo Ramen, a combo of chicken and pork broth with mushrooms, green onion and pork. He liked it, but felt the broth lacked in flavor.\\n \\nOne friend ordered the Abu Ramen, which has no broth. The ramen (or udon if you choose) was tossed in garlic oil and chili paste along with a soft boiled egg, green onions, bean sprouts and pork.  When you mix it all together, the egg creates a creamy coating and adds amazing flavor to this bowl of various textures and tastes. I requested a bite and it was exquisite! Immediately I had food envy!!!! This was the 5 star dish of the 5 we sampled, hands down.For my dinner, I selected the Kumamoto Ramen, a broth of chicken and pork. It had some depth but was lacking in flavor so I asked for chili oil and wasabi to add heat and complexity. The Pork was in large chunks, not sliced thin, and it was overcooked.  Even though it was in the broth it was extremely dry. I didn't even eat half of the ramen.As an add on, I ordered chicken katsu because I love a chicken cutlet, who doesn't?  It didn't arrive until we had all finished our dinners and it was so overcooked it was literally inedible. While the food ranged in satisfaction, all of us appreciated our waiter who was attentive, efficient and friendly.  He took and brought us our drink orders quickly, explained the menu and answered questions about specific items.  When I told him the chicken Katsura was overcooked, he apologized immediately admitting that he forgot to place the order so they cooked it fast and evidently too much. He promptly and without hesitation let us know the katsu would not be on the bill and he also gave us HH prices for the drinks we had ordered.

It was not busy at all and the host/manager said there wasn't a table available at this time to fit us in.\\nAs he said this I'm looking around and see the restaurant approximately 25% full with a lot of open tables and booths. They were unwilling to accommodate us. It wasn't like we were a table twenty.

Now, whenever someone mentions Salem Ma, I might not immediately think of witches anymore... no, the chicken wings will forever be my memory. As for the ribs, they were a disappointment.

If I do, I would definitely order the pasta over the pizza (or at least request that they cook the pizza longer because it tends to be a bit chewy rather than crispy). A decent restaurant overall with some poor customer policies regarding the sharing of dishes due to a hike in price for no discernible reason (i.e. if I just ordered take out and shared all of my food, they'd never know or even worry about it, so why make a stink about it in the restaurant?)."},{"name":"Tso Chinese Delivery","address":"3909 N Interstate 35, Ste E-5","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Love everything about this place.Love the food!

Pros: The food was only delivered 10 minutes later than originally estimated by uber eats. Given the reviews for this place that seems pretty good. The seasoned waffle fries were also ok.Cons: The wings were absolutely terrible. We ordered half honey mustard half red alert. The appearance of the honey mustard wings was completely unappetizing--the skin was soggy and looked undercooked. They were also sloppily drenched in sauce. The sauce itself was subpar--it really tasted like the honey mustard sauce McDonald's serves for their chicken nuggets. The red alert were better, but still nothing I would ever want again. The sauce just did not taste great (slightly bitter aftertaste) and the wings themselves were dry--definitely not drenched in sauce like the honey mustard. My husband also found feathers in one of his (you can see them in one of the wings if you look closely at my photo). In addition to just being pretty disgusting, the wings only came with one small container of blue cheese (for 15 wings) and they put all of the wings in one container so the sauces got mixed.Bottom line: We decided to try this place because there just aren't a lot of wing spots around. I also thought after a spate of bad reviews they might be trying to improve things and so they might be worth a try. However, this was some of the worst food I have had in awhile. I would have rather just not had wings because after our experience the thought of them makes me a little queasy.

Few noteworthy items: -- This is a \\"got time to kill time browsing\\" bookstore, not a \\"run in and out and be done with it\\" kind of place. It's HUGE and even if you know what you're looking for the trip will take awhile. \\n-- The in-house coffee shop is decent. Not as good as my beloved Dilettante or Peet's but good and not too expensive. I think you need (ear) plugs and forearm tattoos to work there, FYI. \\n-- On this last trip I did have a mildly frustrating interaction with an employee. I was looking for a book I recently read about, but couldn't remember the title. I described it, hoping she would know what I was talking about, but she didn't. She told me a couple different areas she *thought* I might be able to find the book, but I knew she was way off. I then went to one of the self-service computers, used a synonym for the word I'd used to described the book, and presto, I found my book right away. And it was not where she said would be. Maybe I should work there? \\n-- Within walking distance of Voodoo Doughnut.

What's not to love?After awhile the shine began to come off.  First, the server was one of those edgy-types that's angling for higher tips by hawking soup, salad, appetizers, drink refills, and dessert to every individual person at the table...every time she stops by.  When someone asks me two or three times if I want a cup of soup or salad, I start to feel like they're telling me I'm cheap, or not welcome, or both.Second, my wife and I found both of our dishes to be lost opportunities for deliciousness.  My ravioli tasted fresh, and the texture was a delight, but it was salty enough that I could hardly pick up any other flavors besides a haze of tomato in the background.  Her dish had the most incredibly tender chicken, which was virtually invisible when set against the mass of boiled broccoli-flavor.  Until that moment, I'd never felt assaulted by broccoli.All in all, I would've preferred to go to a more traditional Italian restaurant with children underfoot, an inattentive staff, and an enormously long wait for delicious food."},{"name":"Sweet-Stack Creamery","address":"25 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Ice cream was not out of this world but the flavors are fun and different.

High prices and high salt usage were what consisted of my meal at Pok Pok.I ordered the famous Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings, Muu Paa Kham Waan (boar collar), and the Khao Man Som Tam (papaya salad). As before mentioned, I was a little disappointed with my meal. I've had tons of Vietnamese fish sauce wings before, both in restaurant and homemade and can say these are the saltiest wings I've ever had! Don't get me wrong, they were still fairly good, but so so salty. $16 gets you 6 decent sized wings and some veggies on the side. The same thing could be said for the boar collar, which was a pretty overpriced dish. $16 for a small plate of salty boar collar that didn't even include rice! I guess the boar is what makes it expensive? The papaya salad was also probably the most bland papaya salad I've ever had.Honestly I was really excited to try this place!

When you enter, the first thing you will notice is that the seating area is very large like a regular Chinese buffet, which means even on a Friday night normally there's not a line. There's a lot of seafood options besides sushi, especially on a Friday night which includes crab, mussles, crawfish, and oysters. Like most large Chinese buffets there is a noodle station and a grill station, but you will see most people in the line for sushi or crab. There are quite a few sushi choices, some variations of rolls with tuna, salmon, crab with toppings like cream cheese or spicy aioli sauce. They also serve sashimi on small plates, and cut it up in small pieces, assuming you're persistent enough to catch them while they put out the plates you can probably down 10-15 of those plates without filling yourself up. The sushi itself tastes decent, its better quality than cheaper Japanese places but like many Japanese sushi places you will feel stuffed with rice halfway through. Each of the other dishes are kinda hit or miss, the mussels tasted overcooked while the scallop cerviche tasted quite fresh.

This place is pretty cool. We were greeted by a friendly tour guide who offered a hat and a menu. I think I was expecting a little more...like seeing some cooks in the open kitchen. I've been to too many Waffle Houses.  I guess that's what I imagined there, just like you would see at any WH. I forgot that this was a museum tho - duh, Karen.  I love little history lessons and, uh, free food so this worked for me hehe.\\n \\nInside of the restaurant were clean utensils, ketchup bottles, cookware, everything. I loved that. We walked through the commissary where they displayed potatoes and other items on the menu that were made from scratch. Interesting. Those hashbrowns don't taste that fresh to me but I like them.  The walkthrough was a breeze. The best thing about this museum is that you get to make your own waffle at the end. I also imagined that we would be making the waffles in the kitchen but whatever. There were 4 waffle makers along with 2 people to help direct us on how to make the waffles. There were about 6 toppings and fillings some of which looked like they came out of a Captain Crunch Berries box - blueberries, strawberries, pecans, chocolate and peanut butter. I topped mine off with chocolate and peanut butter, drizzled with icing. It was pretty good. I would've never tried it any other day so what the heck. My bf filled his with blueberries and pecans. The pecans were real by the way.  I commented about the blueberries because he usually orders that when we visit WH. I just stick to the basics - a plain waffle with syrup.  Anyway, I commented \\"I thought those were real berries when you ordered that at the restaurant.\\" He chuckled \\"me too.\\" I guess it was still good. I was a little reluctant to try it.  Anyway, we had a great time walking through and reading the literature about the history of WH. I think the most touching one was the framed obituary of the first waitress at WH. She dedicated 47 years to the first WH built on Peachtree Street. She passed away in 2010 and they had her obituary there. I loved that.I am definitely a fan of this place. I was more excited that WH originated in Atlanta in 1955, although I'm not a native here, I love the city.

I'm always in search of a good hole in the wall place to eat because, we'll let's face it...they're the best! It's about 10-15 minutes from our house in Apopka depending on traffic. The ladies working the counter are very sweet and accommodating and I will be back to try other dishes. \\nI have pros and cons for everything we tried because I'm a picky eater when it comes to Thai food. My very close friend is from Thailand and cooks authentic Thai food for me occasionally, but we live about an hour from each other. This makes it difficult when I'm craving \\"good authentic Thai food.\\" Also I compare all Thai dishes to her cooking, because it's just that good! \\nSo let's get to the review shall we. I gave 4 stars because this place is very good, but could use some improvements in their dishes. We ordered take out Saturday night because the craving arose and we were in the mood for Thai. So we ordered the following: Thai Iced Tea, Fresh Rolls, Chicken LO Mein, Tom Kha Soup (1 Thai Hot, 1 Mild), Papaya Salad, Chicken Yellow Curry (Thai Hot) and Chicken Pad Thai. My husband and I love   spicy food, but fore warning  Thai Hot is very hot and if you've never tried it before...you've been warned. You're butt will not like you the next day . Mind you this was all for My husband, 2 year old son and myself...we were VERY  HUNGRY!  When I went to pick up my order the ladies asked me if we were having a big party  with all the food we ordered . I politely said \\"yeah a big party with lots of people!\\" Little did she know it was all for us  ÔøΩ? \\nOk so here's the nitty gritty/pros & cons. Thai Iced Tea - Delicious , but way too sweet! It tasted like they put tons of sugar in it which takes away from the beautiful floral and creamy goodness of this drink. Fresh Rolls - Not a lot of flavor in these and the peanut dipping sauce was very watered down. Will not order these again. Chicken LO Mein - ordered this for my 2 year old son because he loves anything with chicken and noodles. Let me just say this is one of the best chicken LO Mein I've ever had!  It had lots of amazing flavor and good ratio of chicken, vegetables and noodles. Perfect balance and delicious  #favoriteTom Kha Soup  (Thai  Hot) - this one was for the hubby. He said it had good flavor, but was not as spicy  as what we are used too when it comes to Thai Hot. Also the onions were cut (huge chunks)  way too big and there were too many. Tom Kha Soup  Mild - this one was for me. This soup had great flavor and was delicious . Very close flavor to what my friend makes so  authentic taste. However, the chicken was very bland and the onions were cut way too big they overpowered the whole dish. I like onions and all, but when I can't fit them in my mouth because they're too big then that's a problem for me. Papaya Salad - this was for me too . Authentic  the flavor was delicious  perfect acidic balance and just the right amount of heat to make my lips numb and my nose run. Definitely will be ordering this again. #favoriteChicken Yellow Curry  (Thai Hot ) - this was for the hubby. He said this dish was nice  and  spicy. Definitely hit the mark on the Thai Hot  for this one. Good flavor, but the veggies had too much sugar on them. They really need to re-evaluate their sugar amounts at this place. Chicken Pad Thai - this was for me too  did I mention I was  hungry? Ok so I love me some pad Thai and this one was a disappointment for me. I asked for extra sauce with this dish because I love me some peanut Thai sauce. I literally got a watered down dipping cup size on the side for this and they charged me ÔøΩ? Then when I went to taste the dish I took like two bites and was done. There was NO SAUCE on the entire dish! It was just chicken, noodles, sprouts and peanuts ÔøΩ? Not sure how they got that one wrong, but it happened. Luckily, I had all the ingredients on hand to make this sauce the next day for my lunch. Not the point of take out, but what can I say? Overall good food and we will be back to try more!"},{"name":"Royal Punjab","address":"251 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I wont be reodering because \\n1. the food delivery guy refused to deliver where I want him to deliver (probably because prepaid tips) \\nz2. the food has some werid taste, i wont recommend"},{"name":"Mad Mex - Columbus","address":"South Campus Gateway, 1542 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"I used to frequent this place quite often when I lived closer.

I made a reservation by text two days in advance.APPS: We ordered the Mac of Cheese ($10) and the Brussel sprouts ($10). I liked the Mac & cheese, which had several types of cheese, was quite creamy, with big pieces of ziti pasta, but had some breadcrumbs that added a nice crunch. I wasn't a big fan of the brussel sprouts (and I love brussel sprouts). It came with a balsamic sort of glaze on it that I thought was too overpowering in flavor. FOOD: My date and I shared two items. First was the Braised Pork Belly ($16?), which came with grits and french toast. Felt a little odd to order for dinner, but holy smokes I actually really liked it! The french toast was thick but light, and broke apart easily because of the juices from pork belly. The pork belly itself was not a very large portion, but very tender. Wish there are had been more of it. Second was the Hangar Steak ($18), which was good but not knock-your-socks-off. I did enjoy it though! AMBIANCE: Very small but pretty cute. The place is really small (like literally 5 tables and 2 seats at the bar in the entire place, it fits 20 people at most). There was one group that was drinking a LOT of wine and were quite loud. Because of the small size of the place, it was loud and dampened my experience a bit. The place has some nice wooden tables, but not much decor from what I remember. SERVICE: Okay, no major complaints. It's a small place, so there was only one waitress who was doubling as the host, and possibly only one real chef, so I was understanding when food came out slowly. I just wish the waitress/hostess hadn't held the door open for so long talking to people who were waiting, being that I was seated right next to the door and it was chilly night. OVERALL: I think I came in with too high of expectations based on the previous reviews, but I still enjoyed myself. TIPS: Reservations necessary, don't arrive before your reservation time (even if you're just on time you will likely wait, as we did). It's BYOB if you want to drink!

My friend's creme brulee was freezing cold under the burnt shell, the soup tasted like a weird sauce, and well I couldn't have a salad or dessert myself because both have dairy which make me violently ill. I would never have paid for an entire table if I knew that they would refuse to provide the meals they'd promised and give you a blank lifeless stare when you asked for what you'd ordered very politely. The room was freezing cold, the table was set up so one person was pinned into a corner, and no one checked to see how our food was. Then learning the food being served was by students only 3 weeks into their program? Yikes! Doesn't make any sense. Don't charge exorbitant amounts for food cooked by kids just learning their way around a kitchen then not bother to teach them about good service - it was a huge waste of an evening and needless to say we won't be coming back."},{"name":"Knight Moves Cafe","address":"1402 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4.5","text":"A boardgame cafe right around Coolidge Corner making it a perfect place for a fun game night with friends.

All of the shelves are packed filled with different types of games, so we looked around and all picked out a board game that seemed interesting. We encountered a few problems with missing pieces or instructions, so we couldn't play any of the games we originally picked out. Thus, we were on the search for a simple game that had all the pieces and instructions to follow. There is a smaller shelf of games, which seemed to be quicker games compared to the large board games on the other side. We found better luck here and played Sparkle Kitty and Cobra Paw.

The entire roll was so loosely rolled that it just fell apart when the chopsticks tried to pick it up.

However, my friends with older kids (as in middle school) who eat pretty much everything love this place.Pros: Unlike many reviewers I actually liked the crowded atmosphere because it reminded me of something of what real Thailand might be like, and with the pretty lighting it made it more subdued and not too chaotic.The coconut butter corn on the cob was amazing! (unfortunately it was one of the few things I could eat)The service was prompt, but that's the only good thing I can say about it.There were some very creative dishes with exciting flavor combinations (again, unfortunately I couldn't try most of them) and I do wish I would have stayed for dessert because that also looked wonderful and very inventive.Cons:While the waitstaff was definitely \\"hipster\\", the service was otherwise lacking. I asked our waiter for recommendations and his only answer was \\"it depends on what you like\\". On top of that he seemed rushed and irritated. I asked him a question about what kind of fish was in one of the entrees, and he looked at me like I was crazy. He grumpily disappeared to find out and was gone long enough for me to look it up on the internet, learn more than I ever needed to know, and make fun of the Latin name (which sounded like something out of Harry Potter), and finally returned only to give me the wrong answer. Maybe it would have been more \\"hipster\\" of him to spend a little less time putting together his outfit and styling his hair and a little more time learning about the food on the menu.Also, I had stashed our small umbrella stroller in the corner by an unoccupied table. A waitress said something in passing (also sounding irritated) about moving the stroller around the corner but \\"graciously\\" allowed me to leave it there since the table was empty. However, as soon as a couple sat down at the table, the same waitress started yanking the stroller out of the way without even saying anything to me. Thankfully, the couple insisted that it was not bothering them and the waitress reluctantly left it alone though she seemed unconvinced. Kind of says something when the customers are so much nicer and accommodating than the waitstaff.While the price was reasonable, the entrees were rather small, and I have never heard of charging extra for rice -- how obnoxious!The papaya salad had some exciting flavors but was small and too spicy for me, not to mention my little one. That's another thing - I don't believe that you get to specify anything for desired level of spiciness - you take what you get and deal with it.I was really excited about the Thai Iced Tea, one of my favorite ever drinks, but it was just okay, a little bland even. Thankfully, my wonderful company more than made up for a disappointing visit to a much hyped Portland hot spot.Conclusion:If you are young, fairly kid-less, have few dietary restrictions or preferences, want to try some bold creative flavors and want to see and be seen, than this is a good bet. Otherwise, go somewhere where there is amazing food AND great service."},{"name":"Masa","address":"439 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been to Masa before, but only late at night, since they seem to be one of the last bars in the South End to close. This was my first time at Masa for food and I was pretty excited - I saw their ads for $5 pitchers of sangria and half-priced tapas platters and decided it sounded like a great opportunity to check out their dinner menu.Now, I thought restaurant week was a time for local businesses to shine -- entice customers with deals and get them to come back and pay full price later. Our meal was pathetic. We started off with the sangria. It was beyond weak. It was hardly even wine-flavored. Then the tapas came. It looked promising - my friend is vegetarian and I don't eat gluten, and as it turned out, everything split evenly between our needs. The taste was okay - good finger food. Then, about 10 minutes after we finished, we started feeling bloated and slightly ill. I thought I'd go for a meal, but after that tapas, I didn't want to eat any more. My friend, however, decided that she'd like one of the starters listed below the tapas on the menu. When she received her dish, she found out that it had meat in it. Our waiter, though impatient with her lack of knowledge of Spanish, agreed to send it back and substitute something off the prix-fixe menu (since none of the other independently listed starters were vegetarian either). She ordered two empanadas, which were served on two little beds of arugula (or some other small-leaved salad green). They were small, light, with presentation reminiscent of nouvelle cuisine and a whopping $22! This, off a menu that is  $33.09 for three courses! Furthermore, you could find the same empanada - perhaps an ounce smaller - on the tapas menu for $1! Add to this our understanding that this dish was coming out as a replacement for the ~$8 plate that had to be sent back and you get a recipe for dissatisfaction."},{"name":"Shigezo Izakaya","address":"910 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Food was terrible, BLAND and overpriced for \\"happy hour\\" items.

They pride themselves on the borrowing and blending of recipes and sauces from all the farmers and friends they have from the various regions that make up Tex Mex food.They also pride themselves on the blending and borrowing of lots of Hub-Caps from all over the world as well.....(but more on that later)The menu here is not overly complex, (once you get past the fact that a lot of dishes have Elvis in the name)..It's standard Tex Mex fare...Nachos, Combo Platters, Big as Yo Face Burritos, Tacos, Enchiladas, and Fajitas.  All beer comes in bottles only...no draught. The house specialty is of course Margaritas, made with fresh squeezed lime juice and they have a Martini made with Jalape√±o stuffed olives.What you can expect from Chuy's, aside from good food, is a wacky and very tacky Tex-Mex restaurant, that is a mixture of shrines to Elvis and carved wooden dogs, and lots of hubcaps, that can be disorienting at first."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing brunch place. Worth the wait and weight! Ha! On Sunday's they offer a brunch buffet. The items are located near the front entrance and toward the middle of the restaurant. The place itself appears to be a home, like many Austin restaurants once were. Our server was nice and helpful. They had an assortment of items. 5 or so different kinds of eggs. Sausages. Pancakes. Croissant sandwiches. Muffins. Ham. Biscuits and gravy. Parfait. Pretty much your basic items to eat for brunch. Everything was so good... My friends and I were quiet for a while cause everyone was busy devouring the food. Would I come back? Yes!! Definitely...

For dinner I got the chicken fried chicken with the pimento mac&cheese and sister got the Green Chili Mac&Cheese. MAN- the chicken fried chicken was HUGE and came with spicy gravy- absolutely amazing!! We split it and even had some leftover to bring home. The pimento mac&cheese was gooey and flavorful. The Green Chili Mac&Cheese had corn & peppers in it, chicken too and the perfect amount of spice. It was so delicious! I highly recommend both of these dishes!

Got the creamed corn, which is to die for, along with some moist brisket. Now i'm not a huge BBQ girl but I will say that they have the best brisket I've ever had. I don't eat meat a whole lot, but watching the people in front of me get their cuts made my mouth water. I indulged in the brisket, which they allow you to get as little or as much as you'd like- I like that. The breakfast tacos and pigs in a blanket were pretty good, nothing to write home about. They also charge extra for shredded cheese if you're wanting any for your tacos. There is outdoor seating for nice days, and a decent amount of seating inside as well. If you're a BBQ lover, you will love rudy's! They have a TV that shows the employees cutting the meat, which is probably a huge hit with nerdy dads like mine who enjoy that kind of thing.

Not sure what the norm is on cooking process being that this was my first time there. He cooked the rice and served us all, then he put the vegetables on the flat top and poured hella vodka on them and left them on the side while he cooked our meats. I don't remember what order he cooked the protein I just remember that when he cooked the steaks I requested for my steak to be medium but ended up cooking it more on the medium-well side, he realized he had cooked it too much after about another 3 minutes on the flat top. Being that it was the end of the night I didn't waste my time to correct him to make me another one to the temp I requested in the beginning. Then the ending was the chow mein noodles.

All meatballs are finely textured to perfection- not those bulky ones most places serve.  You chose your meatballs and sauce (all different flavors), or you can go with their combo suggestions.

I got the mission pad thai that didn't even taste like pad thai. The noodles were thick, and the portion size was not great. The worst part was the sauce that was too sour, too salty, and too sweet all at the same time. The sauce was way too overpowering and had no peanut taste at all. I was super tempted to just wash my noodles in water because the sauce was just too much. The menu had quite a few noodle, rice, and sushi options, but the price wasn't cheap. For the quality and portion, this place is pretty overpriced. It's not in a nice area, and the restaurant itself is not nice, so it doesn't justify the price.

The ingenuity of the creation allows the consumer to savor various ingredients combined with a juicy and crusty texture that make anyone order for more.Sushi Hotdog: With every bite was a burst of flavor that filled our mouths with a sense of crunch and juice! With the rice as the substitute for bread and salmon as the meat, this was possibly better than any other actual hot dog!

However else one can describe them positively. This restaurant's owners and staff take pride in the food they serve. Pride in food should speak volumes to you true food lovers out there. It certainly isn't the next trendy place in town that charges for every little thing you point at and add. They're not set up like a Chipotle or Subway. No offense if you like following steps 1-9 or what have you to order. Don't get me wrong, as a Yelper, I'll try anything once just to try, but hasn't that become a bit of a chore with the trendy spots? I love reviewing, but just because they're hot and new doesn't mean they'll be good. I have to be selective because like most, I don't get the quality I pay for at some trendy places. Just a pricey bill for consuming mediocrity. Now then. If you like seafood, you have to try their seafood pancake app. Crispy and delicious! Does anyone else use appetizers as a barometer with which to predict a restaurant? I'm sure some of y'all do. Ever try Calamari just to predict how Italian places are like? If they can't do Calamari right, don't expect to get your mind blown. Try their seafood pancake! All of the other go-to Korean dishes here are great such as Galbi, Bulgogi, Bibimbap, and Jap Chae. Those are our usual orders when eating Korean. This time we had Jap Chae, seafood pancake, and Galbi. Always sooo good here!

Start with the lettuce cups.  If you want the most tasty and spicy dish: Szechuan.  My only minor complaint:  dishes are batched.  Therefore, you cannot order dishes without (yellow) onions.

Came around 7-8 pm on a Saturday night in a group of 6 and there were still plenty of tables available that could seat all of us. However, there was an issue with the register at that time so we had to pay cash. Luckily there was an ATM nearby because who carries cash around anymore?! The entrance fee is $5 a person, and you can stay as long as you wish which is fantastic. However, if you are bringing any of your own food or alcohol in, the price goes up to $15 per person in your group. We brought some chips and wine so we all paid the higher price. I think it's great that they allow you to bring in your own booze, but the price increase is sort of steep and if I had to do it over again I'd probably just sneak some wine in an opaque water bottle and forego the snacks. The cafe does offer some pastries/desserts and a few hot/cold drinks (espresso, milkshakes, etc.) if you so like. \\nKnight Moves had more games than we could think of, and over the course of about 3 hours we played What Do You Meme?, Clue, and Scattergories. The cafe didn't get really busy until 10 pm at night. \\nMy group had such a fun time here and will certainly be back. Only thing that bothered us was the heat!!!

It can be reserved for private parties and tours, but otherwise you have to catch it on the right day.  (I'd suggest following them on social media, like Facebook:  they'll post when the next open day is.)  This weekend it was so we made the trek over: a very easy walk from the Avondale MARTA station or go ahead and drive over if you want:  there's a big enough parking lot for free parking.  Oh, and did I mention visiting is FREE too?It's a small space, as it should be.  It's the spot of the original Waffle House established in 1955 and one half of the museum has been remade to look like the original.  When you walk in, very friendly and knowlegable staff is there to welcome you, tell you a bit of the history and let you wander about.  I don't know why, but I was also entirely tickled to be able to go behind the counter and pretend to be a WH cook!  :)   And don't forget to go back into the \\"kitchen\\" where you can see the typical supplies they had in the day and even read the instructions on how to turn 10 lb. sacks of potatoes by hand into those delicious delicious scattered covered smothered hash browns you love today.The second half of the building contains memorabilia from over the years, articles and display cabinets full of history.   Here you'll also find really nice staff to help answer any questions too.  And a bonus:  free Waffle House koozies and coupons for a free waffle your next visit to one of their restaurants  (and psst! there's one right down the road if you're feeling the need after your visit too).  Plus cute little paper hats and menus reflecting original prices from back in the day.  (filet mignon for $2, whaaa?)  It's not something to plan your whole day around: an hour tops should be enough to take in all the WH goodness.  But there's a lot to do in this charming community to do too:  restaurants and coffee houses, consignment and antique stores to wander through, and no less than 3 local breweries to stop by and tour and taste if that sort of thing fits your fancy too.  All within walking distance of here.I'm a big sucker for preservation of a city's history and the folks here did a wonderful job in getting the space back to celebrate this little bit of Atlanta after it went through a series of other establishments over the past few decades.   In a city that has been known to tear down the past way too easily, it's nice to see this sort of celebration instead. Go visit.  It's sweet kitchy fun.  :)"},{"name":"The Western Front","address":"343 Western Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"I went to a friend's show last night and came out alive, though I think the clientele varies from night to night.

The headlining band, complete with mc and dj, did some awesome covers as well as original stuff, blending hip-hop beats with jazz, reggae and a bit of funk. I was surprised to see such a group of talented artists perform in a pretty low-key venue. The place was classic, swing dancers painted on the walls, marquee board outside.

We told the second server that that was unacceptable because we needed to leave. She told us that she would take it off the bill. We were then told by the first waiter that he would not take it off the bill because it had only been 30 minutes. This was not true because I noted the time when we sat down and ordered and the steak entree came out 40 minutes after we ordered. If the restaurant was not able to serve food more quickly, then the waiter should have advised us to order a different entree. He acknowledged that we were on a schedule, but clearly did not really care. Because we were in a rush, we reluctantly paid the bill.

I'm not sure if crack is actually in the Arrabiata, but I suspect it might be due to the cravings I get for it. The place is Italian and as close as you will get to a locals only restaurant in Italy. That means a staff that sometimes have it together (the female waiters usually rock) and a staff that can suck (a couple of the young guys, one of whom brought our food to the wrong table, didn't check on us for 30-45 minutes, and then lied to us). It means your 7:00 reservation may not get you a table until 7:30. It means your 60 minute quoted wait time might be 5 minutes or 90 minutes. Unfortunately, it does also mean inconsistencies in the food. Sometimes I get a large plate of pasta that feeds me for lunch the next day and then some. Sometimes I get a small lunch sized portion. Sometimes the sauce is perfectly spicy, sometimes it's only a hint of spice. My spouse sees the same problems with the Cingale portion size, so it is not just a single dish issue. I do wish that the Caprese was made with traditional buffalo mozzarella or even housemade mozzarella, not the balls of fresh mozz that I can buy at the grocery store (belgioioso). And that the tomatoes for the Caprese were fresh, not mealy and refrigerated.  However, the pastas are ALWAYS perfectly cooked. I've eaten there dozens of times and have had maybe one off night on the food. The house wine is actually pretty good for the cost.  When the portions are normal to generous, the cost of the food is wonderful. The menu has never changed since we started going there at least 5 years ago, I'm not sure if that's great that they know what they do best and stick to it or if it's something that could use a good specials menu to mix it up a bit and have it be a bit less generic. They do have about 10 outdoor sidewalk tables that you cannot reserve, but are a ton of fun on summer evenings. I love sitting out there with my dog enjoying a glass of wine and a great plate of pasta.

It's full of flavor, satisfying, and healthy.\\nFavorite bowl is \\"The Lover\\": shiitake mushrooms, carrots, beets, broccoli, kale, ginger nama shoyu sauce, over brown rice. This place makes phenomenal smoothies. Order a Coconut Alive smoothie ($6.25) and you'll thank me later. This is probably one of the most addicting smoothies I've ever had. Life Alive isn't cheap;and after ordering a wrap and a smoothie you're paying about $15. When you really sit and think about how much you're paying for some veggies in a bowl, it's a bit depressing.

They have a charcoal grill that they put the coals in right before grilling and remove right after grilling. I think you can do the cooking yourself, but our server did it for us and cooked it very well- everyone really liked the consistency.They also provided bib lettuce leaves for wrapping, and a dipping sauce with sliced korean peppers and garlic cloves, as well as another dipping sauce for the grill.Overall all the food was ok and the lackluster service was a real debbie downer, so I guess you don't have to do your best once you've established a loyal clientele."},{"name":"Morton's The Steakhouse","address":"213 SW Clay St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We had a wonderful anniversary dinner last night.

Well, I'm a few years older, the cafe has a new owner (the son of the long-time owner has graduated from student to Chef Cook), and the food? It's only getting better. I don't know of a single place in Portland that's quite like this. It has the quaint charm of a classic cafe but food that could compete with any lunch/brunch spot downtown. It's hidden on a small college campus out on Barnes Road and it's literally the cafeteria for the Oregon College of Arts and Crafts.This food is fantastic. The Sunday brunches consist of short, well-thought-out menus that generally offer an egg dish, a griddle dish (french toast or pancakes), a savory dish (pork loin or similar) and maybe one or two more offerings. Call ahead and they'll throw together vegan-friendly options for you (if that's your thing). The coffee is strong and the mugs are all hand-made by OCAC students and staff. The food flavors are fantastic. I'm consistently wowed at how well they balance and combine flavors here. Lunches are served off the cafeteria line... sort of. Last time I was in I enjoyed one heck of a fatoush salad and a nice chickpea, peanut and cabbage soup. The menu also had a tasty-looking giant taco and something else... I was too distracted by the fatoush salad to pay enough attention. This was actually the first time I had been in for lunch and I can confirm it's as diligently crafted as the brunches. Recent visits have only continued to confirm that I should be making the trek out to this wooded, zen-like space for lunch more often. It's worth it to spend a few minutes browsing the student art/craft store or even just soaking in a short walk through the beautiful wooded campus.

The crust was a thicker crust, but was baked until golden. There was a decent amount of toppings. The ribs were fall of the bone and nicely marinated. The tomato sauce was the same in the pasta as in the baked lasagna. It was a solid tasting meat sauce and definitely tasted homemade. The pasta was not al dente but a little more on the cooked side. House salad was fresh and a good variety of veggies. Overall, the food was decent.Just as we were paying the bill, our server offered ice to go with our water cups.

My pet peeve with the Bob Evans restaurants in my area is that the booths and seating areas are not usually thoroughly cleaned. And the worst part is the food and trash under the tables.

We've heard a lot about this place from many friends and decided to give it a try for lunch today. We shared the Pad Thai W/ shrimp, Drunken Noodles W/ shrimp, Basil Fried Rice W/ chicken, and the Moon Crabs! This was more than enough for us! We had plenty of leftovers and everything tasted delicious. We went during the special lunch times and got an amazing price as seen on the red menus. The moon crab was $1 a piece while the dishes with shrimp were $9 and the dish with chicken was only $7.50. This little restaurant didn't skimp on the shrimp or chicken! The meat was cooked in a way that it remained tender and retained all its flavor. There was no additional salt and pepper or condiments on any of the tables as seen in other restaurants. This is probably because everything is seasoned to perfection and there's no need to add any additional flavoring! Next time we come we'd like to try the Garlic Duck since everyone raves about that particular dish.  In summation, this place is close to home and is defiantly a place we would visit again. The servers here are very attentive and friendly. The restaurant itself is quiet and relaxing while the food tastes fresh and flavorful.

Everyone talks about the wings. We went around 630 one night, far earlier than we usually eat dinner. We knew there's usually a crazy wait and line, so we went far earlier to avoid the rush. Our server JP was incredible. As a person who works in the service industry myself, I loved his directness, menu knowledge, and confidence he had with us. I'm vegan and my partner is not, and he made great suggestions to us both. The wings were incredible. Salty, spicy, tender. My boyfriend would come back for the wings. Everything else was just \\"good.\\" I find that most places with huge hype are this way. My curry soup was good, but not something I'm like omg omg omg this is amazing. I make a very similar soup at home that is just as good and not 17$ haha. The cauliflower was okay. I liked their vegan fish sauce, but the cauliflower was just blah. Barely cooked, which might have been intentional? I ate half of it anyway, but I've had lots of cauliflower in my life that knocked my socks off and this wasn't in my top 5. My boyfriend also got the pork shoulder/belly bowl and it was really rich and salty. He refused to send it back. And he's stubborn, so we took it with us. Probably won't eat it. We enjoyed the water. It was odd at first to drink, but the flavor is toasted, and room temperature water is my favorite! The complimentary peanuts at the beginning were delicious as well. Our cocktails were good, not Incredible. Overall our bill was 105$ and in my opinion, way too expensive for what we ate. Entrees were 13-17$ but are \\"family\\" style. I don't feel that 6 wings for 16$ is filling enough, especially to share, but I can imagine that the time to create them is consuming, so maybe that is a reason for the price. I don't regret coming, but besides the wings, we wouldn't be willing to wait in line."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My colleagues and I were in Boston for a conference and wanted to sample its famed seafood. We originally went to check out Neptune Oyster given its ratings but when we got there we found a line of irritated fellow patrons shivering in the cold on the sidewalk and witnessed the hostess yell at one of them to close the door and then she licked the door! A woman locked out then looked at the rest of us and said, \\"I'm supposed to be eating with my sister and she is already in there sitting at a table.\\" Folks expressed sympathy but seemed to shrug off the possibility of getting the hostess to let her in. This was totally NOT the atmosphere we wanted for a nice relaxing meal after a full day working at a conference! So we promptly walked away and toward the Daily Catch (which also has high ratings--deservedly so!) and found exactly the opposite vibe and atmosphere. Here the folks in line were friendly and fun. The small restaurant has a group seating practice putting folks together at the same table to ensure all seats were being used and this created a friendly casual and warm feel to the meal. While waiting to get in, our group of four made a game out of trying to figure out who was with which party and noted how this was actually challenging as people seemed to all be interacting and enjoying their conversations with their table mates. We watched one patron help spot the waiter as he had to lean far into the table to help take a picture of a laughing table of four. As the table of four left (freeing what would be our table), we overheard them saying \\"it's nice to meet you!\\" In their goodbyes which then caused us to wonder of the photographed group had just met over dinner. This friendliness filled the small restaurant and when accompanied by incredibly tasty seafood at very reasonable prices made for a perfect evening! Our group sampled the calamari meatballs and mussels for appetizers which were delicious (my colleague just mentioned that she is still dreaming of the meatballs today). I had the black pasta with puttanesca sauce and scallops--so glad I got the appetizer portion as even this serving size was ample! One off my colleagues got the linguini and clams and was so impressed by the sauce that she drank the reaming bits up like soup! Another colleague got the shrimp and pasta in a marinara sauce and enjoyed it immensely!It's a cash only place and tiny (so not great for large groups).

So to confirm exactly where the Cauldron was located, I looked on Google maps where I also saw De Dutch.It's a hidden place that is right on the bay boardwalk.  This makes for an incredible view during your meal.  If you can sit outside, all the better, but the seats inside the restaurant certainly provides excellent views of Vancouver Harbor thanks to De Dutch's huge glass windows.My daughter and I ordered pannekoeken.  She got the classic which was just the pannekoeken with a strawberry topping.  I got the hash pannekoken which included hash browns, mushrooms, green peppers, onions, and cheddar mixed with sausage.  The pannekoeken has a firmer texture than pancakes and is a lot thinner.  Beyond that it's largely the same flavor.  While I thought my hash pannekoeken was fine, it wasn't more than that.Our waitress was fantastic - very attentive and friendly.  Overall, I can say that the staff were all great.  However, while I recognize it's a sensitive subject, the host should be made aware he has an body odor issue.  I'm not sure if it's simply because he doesn't use deodorant or what, but the small is quite pungent.  As he walked around the restaurant seating people, I noticed others wincing moments after he walked by.  It's quite off-putting as you're eating and a whiff of pungent smell hits your nose.

The other is the more traditional hot breakfast of eggs, breakfast meats, grits, oatmeal, etc. for $28.  There was an omelet station that would cook your omelet to order. I opted to have the ready made scrambled eggs. They had green onions, cheese and other toppings to add to them! I also added bacon and sausage links to my plate.  The food was pretty good!

A thin rice crust also formed which was a delicious treat for my mom. The soft tofu soup was VERY good and we finished the whole bowl! The soup itself was mild (what we ordered) and not overwhelmed by spice while keeping a tasty, not too salty seafood broth underneath.

The bulgogi might have been the worst I've ever had. If not, it was close. The marinade was cloying, and it completely overpowered the taste of the meat. Maybe that was a blessing, however, because the uncured bacon was past its prime. Not rancid, but certainly not fresh. We also got sundubu jiggae with seafood and dolsot bipimbap. The sundubu did not come with the traditional raw egg to crack into the boiling liquid, and the soup itself was mediocre. The bipimbap was the best dish we had, and even it was so-so.

Let me tell you why: Hookah: 5/5\\nTheir hookah itself is really wonderful. I don't know if it's just the shisha itself or what... but you can definitely identify all sorts of flavors. I'm not a mint girl... but through recommendation, I ALWAYS combine mint with a fruit. It brings out the flavor and the hit is smoother. Customer service: 2/5\\nThis is kind of frustrating. I can't stand the customer service. They greet you, seat you, and get you hooked up... really quick and then they are no where to be found. We are expected to change the coals ourselves. They never check up on us. A lot of the times they have a group of men come in and play cards, and whomever is working is preoccupied with them (usually mingling... I assume they are family/friends), which means as a customer you get neglected. It sucks. Food: 1/5\\nWhen this place first opened, their food was phenomenal. But in the past 3 years their food has taken a turn for the worst. Take my word: DON'T EAT HERE. Every time we try to give it a chance, we have to send it back. I kid you not, their Oreo milkshake (which used to be delicious), is basically just Oreos and ice. Not ice CREAM.... ice. Atmosphere: 4/5\\nThe atmosphere is really chill and they actually have beautiful displays of art on the walls. Their couches are comfy and everything seems well maintained. Very cozy. They have plenty of room to accommodate a lot of people. Whether you wanna go by yourself or with 10 people... they'll get you seated comfortably together. Location: 3/5\\nIt's very convenient for me. However, on the weekends parking can be a hit or miss because it is in Old Hilliard. Overall: 3/5\\nI keep coming back to this place because I only get the bare minimum. If you don't feel like driving in the middle of downtown for some hookah and ONLY want hookah... this place will fit your needs. Their hookah and seating area is great. However if you want to eat food, hookah, and expect great customer service... look elsewhere.

It was pretty crowded so just be prepared to share the bar and be aggressive to snag a seat when it opens up. When you get seated they have popcorn on every table. It was really stale though so it wasn't worth eating. I had the fried green tomatoes and they were fabulous. The crust was perfect and the sauce they had it with was to dye for.\\nMy friend got the garlic Barata and that dish was odd. It was literally 3 entire heads of garlic they had baked.

The service was slow, both times that I've been here the service has always been slow. First time I came with a party of 3, and the server would just be behind the screen that she used, never came over to refill my water or check up on us.

I didn't even consider using their bottled red goo placed on every table until I finished my extra moist brisket and started on their turkey and sausage--at that point, I needed the goo. I didn't do pork or creamed corn this visit, and I can take or leave the counter's showbiz antics (\\"I HAVE A ROOKIE! I HAVE A ROOKIE HERE!\\").

I've had the other items on the menu too like the curry noodles which were delicious but I'd say it's not easy to share if you're among a group. Rice is charged by the bowl and these bowls are huge. Just make sure you know that jasmine rice is NOT the ones in the bamboo straw boxes. Drinking vinegar is also a treat. I seem to always order pomegranate, but they're all good.

A neighbor was raving about the meat selection here (including the marinated, grill-ready meats), so I stopped by to check it out firsthand and pick up some meats to throw on the grill. Upon arrival, I was immediately impressed by the clean, organized nature of the store and by the amazing apothecary section. It smells WONDERFUL. I also thought it was cool to see the bar area, where you can purchase coffee, beer or wine to sip while you shop. There's also a fresh juice bar in the produce area. Another yelper said this was like a mix between a Whole Foods and a Trader Joe's. I'd agree. And the major advantage is that this is in Sodo... which has neither of those stores and has been long overdue for another grocery option.Much like at Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, you may not always find the lowest price. It's always good to price compare with certain items (particularly the items in the middle aisles... the ones that don't spoil quickly... those tend to be a touch pricier here). That said, I found that the meats are VERY reasonably priced and are cheaper than Publix, but with higher quality. The marinated meats are STELLAR... well-priced, high in quality and ready to throw on the grill. The pollo asada is incredible and very affordable at about $4 per pound. And the various kebabs are quite tasty (the garlic chicken is SOOOO GOOD). The bulk bins are great if you're looking for grains, snacks and sweets. The prices seem to be comparable to Whole Foods.The produce is a touch pricey for certain items, but they offer a great selection of organic fruits and vegetables. And the bulk veggie bins are very well priced. For about $4 a pound, you can mix and match the perfect veggie or stir-fry blend (convenient if you're only cooking for 1 or 2... and you're trying to avoid leftovers).In addition to the groceries, there's a hot food bar, a salad bar, a taco bar and a poke bowl bar. So there's no need to shop hungry. I've been very impressed by their salad bar and taco bar selections, both of which feature a phenomenal guacamole. I haven't tried the poke bar yet, but that's next on my list.Only downside is that the checkout lines can get a bit long at times, but I think that's a testament to the high quality of the shopping experience here. It's really a great addition to the Sodo area."},{"name":"Morton's The Steakhouse","address":"213 SW Clay St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Please save some money and go elsewhere.

There was no difference in the taste except for the spiciness of the sausage. And was there crab in there?

The only thing that offered a nice culinary treat were the spicy wings, but one can get spicy wings just as good in numerous joints around town without waiting in line for an hour.And a note to our \\"waiter\\": don't slouch against the post while taking my order.

The physical space is cool.  It opens to a market with a few picnic tables inside (in warmer weather they have outdoor seating also), a coffee counter, and a few other areas to buy prepackaged food or food to to take away.  The market leads to a bar area, which then leads into the dining area.  Overall, it has a rustic feel in general with tons of reclaimed wood.  I've come for drinks with friends a handful of times and have been pretty pleased by the drink selection, although I've been less impressed with the small plates at the bar.  Probably my favorite thing about this place is the granola bars they sell at the coffee counter in the front of the store.  And if you're reading this, Commonwealth, let me know what I have to do for the recipe and consider it done!One of the not-as-great things about this place is that sometimes the service is a little lackadaisical.  I'm not sure if they are just trying to portray a casual atmosphere, but sometimes it seems the staff forgets they are working in a restaurant.  Also, I understand that farm-to-table food sometimes comes at a cost, but the prices of entrees is a little bit steep for the service, setting, and overall product.My mixed review is reflected in the average rating and three stars.

Average price of a dish was probably around 14 or 15$. An order of 6 wings was 14.50$! Bowl of rice was 3.50$, and this small bowl of pork belly curry was another 14/15$. Expensive meal for the size of the dishes. Luckily we were splitting between 4 people, and oregon charges no tax. The wings were good at first bite, nicely glazed, pretty good crispy skin, and tender meat. But super salty! It was hard to eat more than 2 wings cause they were so salty. The pork belly curry was delicious. Didn't come with rice, so you have to order a bowl separately. Sadly, it only comes with 3 or 4 small pieces of pork belly so it wasn't that filling either!

When we tried to ask the waitress about the wait time, she dismissively and rudely told us to wait outside until she comes out and grabs us. Embarrassed to leave after waiting for an hour, I waited until nearly half of the restaurant cleared out before we were seated. However, once we sat, the waitress rushed our orders and even chastised me for ordering insufficient dishes for the group and gave me an \\"I told you so\\" when I asked to taste another smaller plate of the squid ink pasta.Regardless of how the food tasted, I was embarrassed to have brought my parents to such a crowded and tiny establishment where we were rudely treated in every step of the way. The food may have been good in retrospect, albeit a bit expensive for the size portions. The squid-ink pasta with anchovie oil was a bit too salty for our taste, but the garlic-olive oil version was much more palatable and the noodles were chewy and delicious. The $20 calamari dish was delicious as well, although, like the previous statement, wished there were more seafood than french fries...Overall, my experience here was horrific and I wouldn't recommend this place for any parties larger than 4 people, because you will NOT be seated at any reasonable times.

The pandan scented water was heavenly and the little plates of spiced peanuts were the perfect snack while deciding what to order.  We ordered a feast: Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings, Kung Op Wun Sen, Neua Naam Tok, the Pok Pok Special, and two extra orders of sticky rice.  Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings lived up to their hype.  Perfectly fried, deliciously sticky sauce, and spice on the side worked well for everyone at the table.  The King Op Wun Sen was still sizzling when it arrived to the table and we fought for every last bite because it was so great.  The Neua Naam Tok had the tenderest meat and the sauce had just the right balance of tangy and spicy.  The Pok Pok Special was served crispy but the meat was still tender.  The dipping sauce was a dream come true and I would dip all my food in it if i could.  The sticky rice orders were served in plastic bags tucked into woven grass tubes just like you would see in Southeast Asia.

But, the quality of the food and their service has  gone downhill in the last couple of years. Not to mention that they keep changing classic menu items for options that, in my opinion, are not as good. Like adding pickled vegetables to dishes. Why? I am now down to just one dish I love and even that I need to modify so it tastes like it used to. I get that they need to change it up, but, the idea is to improve on things and, in my opinion, they are going in the opposite direction.They also made some less than wise choices, like opening another store in Boston rather than improving Cambridge location first. Their ordering process and efficiency is terrible. If you are going to accept phone orders in the middle of lunch hour with only 2 cashiers working, then have someone in the back office pick up the phone, not the cashiers that should be tending to the people in line.I am constantly getting wrong orders for takeout and delivery.

Knew from the moment I walked in and was helped by supportive staff for a bag check (the existence of which attests to the size of the place) that exploring Powell's would be an exceptional experience.Favorite places in the store are the Pearl Room (art, science, tech, math, and a really interesting rare book room!) and the Purple Room (philosophy and cognitive science. During my first day of exploration, these were the first rooms I explored in depth. I was already able to tell the bookstore would be one of the best, since their math section is massive and contains a good variety of both used and new books. While math book sections are probably not the \\"best\\" indicator for whether a bookstore is good, a large and comprehensive math section usually indicates a staff that is attuned to plenty of specific interests and knows what's up with each section. This became more obvious when I started finding sections dedicated to specific topics like Freud to rug collecting to Pacific Northwest history. There's so many unique collections, great sale book aisles, and helpful staff that it's so easy to find what you may need across the many rooms of the store. It's also impressive that it is a used bookstore, since most of the used books are barely marked and in fairly new condition. I'm not sure what the process is like for selling used books at Powell's, but they must be very careful with the types of used books they take in. Most of the books I bought were used and had no markings inside them. It's easy to spend only about $50 on around five or six used books that are \\"like new\\" quality, and their new selections are also very well-chosen within their subjects. There are also a variety of notecards under books that indicate staff choices and popular sells, even for non-book items like puzzles, moon lights, umbrellas, tote bags, and philosopher mugs (couldn't help but pick one up)!Even with a few hours to spare, it is nearly impossible to even be able to get to know every part of the store. You just have to submit yourself to the unknown knowledge that Powell's holds and enjoy the experience in being one of the world's largest independent bookstores!

Entrees varied in their level of success. My boyfriend's striploin was supposed to be cooked to medium rare but it definitely was more medium to well done. A bit tough to the tooth. The sides were excellent however. The kid had the steak and lobster and this time the steak was medium rare and delicious. We all helped him devour it. The awesome waiter showed him how to remove the meat from his lobster and it must have been delicious as it disappeared within minutes.

There's just sooo much flavor in the broth. Writing this review is making my mouth water, I can't wait to go back. Definitely deserves a 5/5. Definitely one of the best vegan dishes in all of Boston. (The only thing I don't like is that the vegetables are not cooked til they're soft, they still have a crunch to them. But I know I'm really picky about my veggies being cooked til they melt in my mouth, so I'm not using this to discount how delicious this dish is.)PHO DAC BIET \\nAs for their pho dac biet, it's definitely on the sweeter side of pho broths. My boyfriend loves it and gets this every single time and he's been here probably at least 50 times -- not an exaggeration LOL. He'd definitely give it a 5/5. OTHER FOODS \\nAs for their other foods, the curries are really freaking good and their portions are GINORMOUS. I actually can never finish anything I order here but it's great to have to eat for later.

I get that they have a lot of folks on the payroll, which is probably why it's so nice there.  But $18/day for self parking?  Come on man!  The parking lot was full every day I was there, so if they charged $5-$10/day, they'd still make out on it.

I think the reason so many people have given a low rating is that the quality is not always consistent. Most of the time everything tastes great and the wings are crispy, but occasionally they will be soggy or under seasoned/under sauced. They also keep changing which app the delivery goes through which has been frustrating. This is only reason I am giving four stars and not five.

Super chilled, fresh and plenty of oyster liquor.  I've had many a raw bar in my life but there's just something different about the oysters here.  5+/5 - Oyster slider: Ordered only one to share.  I know, how could we have been so remiss?  Hindsight being 20/20, I really wished I ordered 3 and made this my meal.  5/5- Fluke Crudo: This was recommended to me over the sea bass ceviche.  It was very fresh (don't get me wrong) but nothing distinctive that I've not had in a nicer Japanese restaurant.  Great raw pieces of fluke with a light coating of sesame.  3.5/5- Cinnamon French toast: Not prepared traditionally and wasn't accompanied with some sort of syrup.  It was very sweet on it own topped with pistachio nuts.  This was a decent dish but we have had more adventurous and tastier versions.  3/5- Lobster roll:  Generous portion of fresh lobster meat and they were nice enough to let me sub the chips for fries.  Pretty good but I still think the one at Pauli's is better and yes, by that I mean even better than the one at Neptune Oyster.   Yes, you may feel like throwing rocks at me for that comment.  I'm ready for you :P  4/5- Fried whole belly clams:  Decent sized pieces of whole belly clams shared by all on our table.  It was just enough to satisfy everyone's craving for fried clams.  4/5- Rhubarb croissant:  I tried a little of this and loved it but it had an unexpected custard type filling that my daughter (who is used to a more plainer croissant) didn't take to.  5/5  If I could have a do over, I'd have triple up on the raw oysters and the oyster slider, nixed the Fluke Crudo and French toast but kept the lobster roll and clam basket.

In the past month, I have gone to both Bennu locations pretty much every single day way into the AMs. My go-to drink is the Iced Bennu with less ice and whip cream on top. I typically recommend this to friends that likes drinks more on the sweeter side but still needs a caffeine hit if they need to stay awake. And surprisingly, Bennu's pizza is pretty freaking good too, something that I did not expect from a coffee shop. If you want more of a savory flavor, the Gamboa is sooooo good. If you're looking for more of a sweet flavor, then the Torres is the way to go. Pros: \\n- It's 24 hours, with lots of tables. This location is a lot better lit than the one on MLK. \\n- It doesn't break your bank. Most of the drinks and food are a pretty good size. \\n- Nice coffee shop vibes. A really great place to get some work done or to stay awake at night. Cons: \\n- If you come during finals week or any busy times, seating can be really hard to find but people are really nice about sharing! \\n- The wifi can either be really slow or really spotty. So if you really need your laptop to get work done, come with a hotspot as a backup. \\n- The music can be very very loud depending on the barista behind the counter. \\n- Be weary of the sanitation, one time, while they were preparing my pizza they went from windex to pizza but it was just that one time.

The crispy basil duck is my favorite so far as I try new things every time I go back. The fried fish with chili sauce is very good, but the fish was slightly over cooked. I have had sushi and sushimi a few times and the rice is prepared correctly with a balance of vinegar and sugar. If you ask they will prepare you a side of sliced thai chilis in fish sauce for adding extra kick. I eat Thai hot, but still like the freshness of the chilis sprinkled on as well.

ALL DAY, ALL NIGHT. Seriously - it has to be one of the most difficult jobs in the world!Also challenging - making vegan, gluten-free, and raw food taste delectable to the meat-loving, fiending-for-the-processed American palate. Let's talk about a Reuben, for instance. The traditional version of the sandwich is stacked with corned beef (so not vegan), Swiss cheese (definitely not vegan), Thousand Island dressing (don't even think about it - it's not vegan) and sauerkraut (okay, so that's vegan). My point is, Counter Culture has guts, chutzpah, BALLS if you will- to take on a decidedly meaty sandwich and successfully reform it into a vegan-friendly incarnation. The breakdown:\\n// Swap corned beef (it's really kind of nasty, anyway) for marinated tempeh\\n// Eliminate the Swiss and bring aboard the cashew 'cheeze' \\n// Sub traditional Thousand Island for '1,000 dressing' (made with a vegan mayo)\\n// Leave the sauerkraut... duh.The Tempeh Reuben definitely rocked the vegan #foodporn category, and rocked it hard. Also worth a culinary go? The Mac 'n' Cheese, made with rice elbows, steamed broccoli and baked in a creamy cashew sauce (gluten and soy-free!). Can't wait to come back to these kitschy digs for yet another taste of their innovative, fresh menu. Spicy raw Pad Thai, anyone?"},{"name":"Din Ho Chinese BBQ","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 116","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"The one reason I always find myself coming back here is the salted fish and chicken eggplant hotpot.Yes, that is the name of one single dish.They do it so well. I love the flavor and how the dish is so hot (temperature wise) that, as a friend of mine once astutely said, \\"I don't understand why my chopsticks aren't on fire right now.\\" Every couple of weeks the craving kicks in and I'm like gosh gotta drive back to dinho again. And occasionally I get depressed or lost in life and I need a pick me up so my stomach starts nagging me about the eggplant hotpot.So my ideal meal here is just that, and some water spinach, but often that isn't enough for my dining companions, and I'm forced to branch out. After having tried random dishes here and there of a pork, sizzling something, lobster, Chinese broccoli, flat noodle, and other various miscellaneous nature, my conclusion of this place is that I just don't like the way they season things. This is especially true for the meats (not seafoods). It's very sweet, and often tangy - but in an uncalled-for way. Like why would my pork in garlic sauce taste like sweet and sour pork? Do you know what garlic means? And why does my sizzling beef taste like ketchup?(Okay so I may be a little biased in my Chinese food palate; I've never been into sweet main dishes but that's just me.)Otherwise, the lobster dish is actually very good too, and their BBQ is decent. I've always had good experience with the service on top of that. They're very curt (how many ppl okay pls sit here here's your food and check bye) but I like the no-nonsense. Food comes out ridiculously fast, so fast that I wonder how they make it so quickly. Are there microwaves in the back? Hah jokes. Aight I'm digressing so I'll end it here. 5 star hotpot, 4 star service, 3 star everything else.

We came on a busy Saturday evening during the dinner rush, and people were pouring into the dining area of the restaurant while waiting for a table because it was so busy -- staff really should have done a better job policing this because this was essentially what ruined our dining experience. We didn't wait long, but we were seated at the table closest to the front of the restaurant. Have you ever tried to eat with someone's butt two inches away from your table? Yeah, it's not fun. Have you ever tried to get up to go to the bathroom and end up bumping into people standing and waiting behind you? Yeah, it's not pleasant. Especially when they think it's your fault. On top of this, on my way to the restroom, the owner shoved her hand in my face and yelled, \\"STOP!\\" because I was standing behind her while she served a table a plate. I wasn't in her way and was a good distance behind her -- there are better and less rude ways of communicating what she had to say.Beyond eating with zero privacy, the food was pretty good but overpriced. We got the pick 2 bbq plate with char siu and duck, snow pea leaves, and mapo tofu. Duck was mostly bones, but char siu/bbq pork was great -- tasted just like it does from the best places in Houston. Vegetables were terribly overpriced -- eyebrow raising prices compared to Houston Chinese food, but when there aren't very many other options, this is what you deal with. Food came out fast, and waitress was excellent and attentive. Overall, if there were other good Chinese options, I don't think I'd come back here. The dining experience was so incredibly unpleasant and the food is pricey. But because of the limitations in the city and it's offerings of Chinese food, I would probably come back, but order take out instead."},{"name":"Pho Basil","address":"177 Massachusetts Ave, Ste A","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I'm confused as to how this place is still running bc the workers here are rude.

We were excited but not sure how to order dinner, use the kiosk for the movie selection, or how the process worked at Studio Movie Grill.  It was a Thursday night and fortunately the movie theater was mostly empty.  We looked around with the deer in the headlights look but tried to figure out the kiosk and what to do while 3 workers just stared at us.  Finally after 3-5 minutes I thought I'd initiate and ask for help. A worker approached us and I was relieved and thought he was going to welcome us and offer help.  Instead he told my wife she would need to leave the theater and take her purse to the car.  We are in our 40's and on a date night.  We were totally shocked.  The employee said their policy does not allow purses and there is a sign on the door that we should have read.  My wife has a medium sized purse. We both thought this is a ridiculous policy and we decided to just leave.  We looked at the sign and it is a small 8 1/2 x 11 print out of The Joker movie advertisement. It does say no large handbags or costumes allowed in the movie theater.  We were not in the mood to argue.  This place will not get our business.  First because no welcome and no customer service. Second no common sense as a 50 some year old employee makes the judgement call that my wife's medium sized purse is a large handbag? Wow.  There are plenty of other movie options for us. We went to Cin√©polis in Polk County instead.  Marvelous experience, great customer service, great IMAX experience, and comfortable seating. Oh and they allow a purse to be brought into the movie theater. We had a choice between Sunset Studio Movie theater and Cin√©polis Polk County to be our home theater for date nights.  The choice was made for us when our experience at Sunset was laughable.  We are fortunate that Cin√©polis has great customer service and provides us with a wonderful place to watch movies."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"One of the first places I went when I came to Portland and it didn't disappoint.

This place is pretty large, and they've put forth a great effort to make use of the space. If the inside is full, they've got a giant tented patio in the back with heat lamps (which was perfect for this chilly day), along with another bar area I didn't even notice til after our meal. Service was basic, drinks were constantly refilled and our plates were bussed fast.

We were greeted quickly and nicely by two young ladies at the host stand who let us know there was a 30 minute wait for a table and that the bartenders managed their own wait. We put our name down for a table and walked towards one empty seat at the bar. Generally our dining preference is the bar so we were looking to find out how long// put our name in for two seats. A tall, bearded, dark haired bartender saw us standing there and continued to walk by us many times without saying a word or acknowledging us. After five+ minutes of this my boyfriend reached his hand out to get his attention and the bartender finally stopped. Without any type of greeting or offering a menu to browse, he stated he would add us to the list and walked away. At this point we were both unsure of how long the wait was or how many names were in front of us so we just stood there. A manager I believe named Steve came right over and kindly asked to help us. He went behind the bar to make sure our name was on the list since the bartender clearly did not care to let us know. Steve informed us that we were next and when two seats open they will clear them, drop a \\"reserved\\" sign and come let us know. At this point we felt a little better about the overall unorganized experience so we waited near the door. Steve brought us menus to look through while we wait and reassured us it would not be long. \\nLess than 5 minutes later two seats opened at the bar. The tall bearded bartender cleaned the two spots, looked towards us and did not say a word to us. We waited patiently for him to clean & set back up, knowing when it was ready they would drop a reserved sign. One minute later two guests walked in, walked right to the two open seats and sat down. The tall bartender looked our way, immediately greeted the two guests and poured them waters. Now I've worked in the restaurant business far too long to think that this was a mistake or confusion. The bartender made eye contact with us knowing we were waiting and proceeded to greet them right in front of us. I   asked the hostess to find me a manager and she kindly did so. Steve returned quickly and I explained the situation. He apologized many times and said he would go figure out what was happening. At this point we had such a bad taste in our mouth over the whole experience the last thing we wanted to do was be served by the bartender. It's truly unfortunate, we live in kenmore square and dine often in this area. Possibly figuring out a more efficient wait system for the bar or just having someone who is kind enough to stop and greet guests from behind the bar would be ideal. We will not be back...Steve & the hostess staff were very kind making me want to give them 5 stars but the overall experience was awful."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This place confused me.

I guess it was finally time to see if it lived up to the hype. Upon arrival, you can clearly tell this place is popular as the line was out the door, but I think some of this may of been due to a conference nearby. Speaking of which, the conference center is right next door, so be aware of this especially towards the end of a day when many could be pouring out looking for food and or alcohol. Back to the initial arrival, I was told the wait would be long, but then moments later I was offered a spot at one of their smaller outside bars. I can honestly say this restaurant is strung into many micro lounge/eating areas. I was taken back as many areas could act as their own restaurant. Fast forward to the mini outdoor/indoor bar I was led to. Not a lot of room, but you should expect it when visiting Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill. The food menu is very simple, one sheet, hard to really mess this up. I had opted for their pork three ways sandwich (Pulled, smoked, whole), a side of sweet potato fries and a beer. Calorie counters stop reading now. When it came I was in for a doozy, as the serving size is quite large. The sandwich to the point was absolutely divine and one I would not mind eating every single day if it were not for diets!

Which is immediately followed by a glossy eyed search for coffee and food.  Sometimes this search comes to an end in my kitchen, other times, it does not.  Several days ago, I found my eyes open at my friend's apartment in Austin, TX... some may call it \\"The Live Music Capitol of The World,\\"  I call it, \\"The Promised Land.\\"I stumbled out of said apartment, jumped into a car (I hope that the owner didn't mind), and headed for an establishment which I had heard about, The Kolache Factory.  The recommendation that I got for this place was simple.  \\"Kolache Factory, omg, it's delicious.\\"  Fine, I'm sold.I walked in the front door and found a peculiarly fast food meets bakery type setup.  After a half second of pondering, I realized that that is exactly what this is.  Anyhow, I eyeballed the selection and come to realize that my desires were located in the porky goodness of a sausage, egg, and cheese kolache... wait.  What is that just to the left, a bacon, egg, and cheese kolache!?!?  I shall consume both.  The fine gentleman behind the formica counter plucked them from the racks and asked me if I desired for the dough balls of tasty goodness to be heated.  I nodded my head, as I was unable to form a word from my drooling face.  The aforementioned gentleman expeditiously microwaved my taste nuggets, we exchanged currency, and I retreated to my... err... the vehicle, where I can be alone to devour in privacy.When I took my first bite, the clouds parted and the god of tasty food gave me an epic thumbs up, Buddy Christ style (you can tell this is a lie because we all know that there are no clouds in TX).  I found the standard breakfast combination to be elevated to the next level by the sweet dough envelope.I completely forgot to mention that I ordered a coffee too.  Yeah, it was coffee.  I'm not complaining, I'm not raving.  I was satisfied.Okay, so a short back story:\\nMaybe about two years ago, I found my eyes open at a friend's (amazing) house about 45 minutes, or so, outside of Houston.  (Following the trend here?)  I stumble into the kitchen to make some coffee, when my friend walks in the door from having worked all night.  In tow, he has a bakery box of koclaches.  He said that they were a local thing and that they were good.  I learned two things that morning.  The first thing is that kolaches are a local thing and the second was that I didn't like kolaches.Kolache Factory, thank you for restoring my faith."},{"name":"Von Ebert Brewing - Glendoveer","address":"14021 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I've been here a few times and thought it was good.

I feel like vegan food is just better experienced outside with nature, you know what I'm saying?Anyway, my server was very knowledgeable and willing to help me out with the menu. He and the others probably have to do this all the time for people unfamiliar with a lot of the items (jicama? seitan?), so I applaud them.The food I ordered was way better in my opinion. The plate felt a little more like three sides than one entree and two sides.- \\"Rawvioli\\" (jicama slices filled with cashew cheese and topped with pesto) didn't seem like much at first, but each bite was very tasty. The jicama and cashew cheese were pretty tasteless by themselves (and probably why I didn't like the mac and cheese), but with the pesto, it all worked together just right. Pesto was strong and robust, so combined with the textures of crunchy jicama and creamy cashew, it was a winning combination. Plus uniqueness points, too. And a big portion.\\n- Jalapeno cornbread by itself wasn't spectacular, but I found myself eating it all because I liked the texture of the butter. Was better with hot sauce, too. \\n- Pac-man salad was cute, and the dressing was very tasty and makes kale more palatable (although I'm one of those people who actually loves raw kale). Felt like there was too much dressing though - was slathered on pretty thick. But not a problem because it tasted really good.\\n- Lavender lemonade was delightful. I was worried it was basically just going to be lemonade with only the smallest hint of lavender, but it was well-balanced enough to also not be super floral. Well done. I'd like to make some of that at home.Overall, I'd come back for the rawvioli and lavender lemonade, though some of the other sides may be better.In the interest of full disclosure, I came back on invitation from the owner who wanted me to give the place another chance.

We've been coming here for breakfast for years. Always super fun and the food was incredible, one of our favorite Boston restaurants.I hope things change, but sorry to say the new ownership has made some major missteps. Primarily it's the food. In the past, everything was really substantial and tasted homemade. Now, nothing tastes fresh or seasoned anymore. Pancakes, once fluffy and light, are just flat. The homefries used to be delicious sliced potatoes with rosemary but now they're cubes that I suspect came frozen in a bag. The vegan scramble was always my go-to but now it's in-eatable. The eggs my family ordered were watery and pale instead of their usual fluffy golden goodness. Everyone's toast was just slightly warmed with a tiny bit of a butter spread just in the center. They even got a different brand of coffee which doesn't even come close to the bold, locally roasted brand the old owners ordered. Even more strange is how they now have disposable bottles of Tabasco and ketchup--so wasteful. I'll check back on this page periodically to see if things ever change--maybe the owners will try to do their own thing and excel at it but sadly they're unable to replicate what this spot once had. :("},{"name":"Kismet Cafe","address":"411 W 24th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Just tried this place out for lunch and I loved it!

I was in a celebratory mood and told him it was my birthday. He responded with \\" Wow, I have a birthday too and so does he\\" pointing to another server, \\"I guess we are all special\\"! That put a damper on my mood! My husband and I both ordered our favorite dish, Gino's Favorite\\". It was disappointing. It was dry and pasty as if it was a left over! We left the restaurant extremely disappointed and will not be returning.  Ialso advise that it is not a place to go to celebrate an occasion."},{"name":"Nori Nori","address":"6690 Roswell Rd, Ste 2110","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"Food is delicious!

I've also had the tuna ceviche, a couple other variations that I don't remember, a cheese dish ( I think goat cheese), and the stuffed portobello.

The vegetables on the side were a bit drab/ sad looking.The Kaeng Hang Leh was tasty in terms of flavor, but I found it a bit too oily to my liking, and the pork belly wasn't as tender as I had imagined it to be. The sticky rice was good and packed in a little plastic bag in a cute little container.

While there is a generous ratio of braised rib to lobster to noodle, I don't find the accompanied sauce to be pleasant at all!

The menu is based on tradition fused with innovation that brings new life to the 'classic meatball'. Patrons can expect to find a combination of an old world style with a retro feel and fresh originality.When ordering you first choose \\"How would you like them\\" your options are \\"On Top\\", \\"Alone\\" and \\"Smash\\". If you select \\"On Top\\" you then you select a side you would like your meatballs on top of. Choices include Creamy Polenta, Penne Pasta with choice of sauce, Gluten-Free Pasta, Pasta Aglia Olio and a White Bean Ragout. If you want your meatballs by themselves, you would choose \\"Alone\\" and they are served atop a bed of arugula. The \\"Smash\\" option gives you the meatballs smashed on freshly baked focaccia.Next you select the type of meatball you would like. The list of meatballs includes Nonna's traditional Italian meatballs, Vegetarian, Gluten free Jeffy's sausage, Mediterranean grass fed lamb with pita bread and tzatziki sauce, Spicy pork, Chicken Marsala and a Reuben ball topped with a traditional Reuben Sauce. Your next step is to pick a sauce. Sauces available are Roasted Tomato Sauce, Isabella's Signature Pesto, Creamy Provolone , Rich Marsala Mushroom Sauce, Spicy Pork Sauce. You can mix and match all you want, but the sauce selections go hand in hand with your meatball choice.

The rotisserie chicken is tasty, but, you can get similar, if not better, quality at Costco for under $10 (unless they've recently upped their price).  If you're after the whole bird folks, drive a little further and hit Costco, or El Regio (their's is grilled, same price, but, you GET SIDES AND TORTILLAS, and it's definitely better tasting!). \\n     One morning I went in with a friend.

Standard reviewer's outfit: jeans, white collared shirt, and sports coat.  I'd consider myself slightly better looking than the average guy.  I'm from Rhode Island originally, but haven't lived there in about 15 years.  I've lived in Boston, San Diego, Los Angeles, and Houston.  I've been in the Atlanta area now for about a year and a half.  I was living in Midtown until last month when I moved to Buckhead Village.  So it was natural to try and explore the more local bars and try and find my \\"go-to\\" spots.First off, I've seen this place many times, but always went right past it because I never heard anything that great about it.  Everyone always talks about Johnny's Hideaway (see my other reviews) which is about 100 yards away from this place on the same side of the road.  Honestly, I always just walked/drove right past \\"The Ivy,\\" I even declined to come here in the past and waited in-line at Johnny's Hideaway for over an hour because I didn't think  this place was any good.  If you look at the other reviews of \\"The Ivy,\\" you'll see what I mean, it's only a three star place- which wouldn't put it on my radar normally.  All that being said, I couldn't have been more wrong.  What a mistake I had been making.  I take full responsibility for writing this place off, by no means has it ever looked dead from the outside, to the contrary, its always been completely slammed every time I've gone by, but I just always ignored it for some ill-informed reason. So I've gone to a ton of different bars and clubs now around heree, and I have to say, if you're the same demographic as me, mentioned above,  this is probably your best bet.  It would have been obviously 10 times better if you were with a group of your boys, and maybe 100 times better if you were with a mixed co-ed group, but even just going solo and completely straight-edge, I still had a great time.First thing you notice when you walk in, immediately, you say to yourself, \\"wow, bigger than I expected.\\"  Everyone's dancing inside or standing by the bar, its really crowded.  Its a younger demographic with a lot of attractive girls, majority too tall (I'm 5'10'').  Within about 10 minutes of being at this place, I had completed one entire circle of the inside and outside patio/bar area before coming back in.  Immediately when I got back inside near the dance floor area, some pretty hot girl came right up to me, we hit it off, and we were dancing for the next maybe 45 minutes.  That hasn't happened so easily anywhere else in Atlanta.  Its either usually too loud, or the demographic is really cliquey where it's too hard to talk to anyone, and if you can get their attention for a split second, you're metaphorically \\"selling them a vacuum cleaner at their front door.\\" - they're not receptive to it.  This place was the opposite.  I felt like every girl in there was really attractive and you were making eye contact immediately with all of them.  I would definitely go back here on a weekend night to meet girls and get numbers, its perfect for that.As far as the bar, it seemed great as well.  There is an indoor and outdoor bar.  The service- even for sparking water (LOL), was immediate, quick, and friendly.  This place seemed like the place where you'd see a fight or two, but there was none of that at all; again, to the contrary, the guys that you'd think would be douche bags- they were randomly offering me drinks, not cock blocking at all, and really friendly.So 5 stars? really?  Yeah, I give it 5 stars because as a single guy, it really had exactly what you're looking for.  That being said, I did obviously feel a little old for this place, but there were definitely people the same age and older than me there.  I didn't see any token \\"super old dudes,\\" and the guys that seemed my same age were all pretty classy looking.  I don't think I saw any girls my own age, which I'm totally fine with.  So if you want to potentially knock this place for anything, it's really difficult for me to think of anything.  I briefly looked at some reviews and they're talking about food a lot of them...  If you're doing food reviews of this place, I'm sure it sucks, I wouldn't come here to eat ever.  I'm not even sure I would come here to steal the food supplies in the event of a zombie apocalypse- that's not what this place is about.In summary, this place feels like an upscale college party mansion where a single mid-30's guy could potentially find a long-term relationship that he'd be proud to show off to his boys."},{"name":"Panera Bread","address":"400 Cochituate Rd","city":"Framingham","stars":"2","text":"This panera deserves 0 stars....

Groups of two or three waited while groups of 6-10 passed us.There were at least 15 booths or tables available for smaller groups. All were covered with food from the previous party - and stayed that way during our entire meal until the next group was brought in. There was zero reason for the wait.

It all went well until we checked in.  No service oriented people work at this location.  If you want high quality of service go elsewhere, maybe the Ritz next door. \\nI meant to write this review as soon as I checked out, however, I had to cool down.  The hotel was busy, occupancy rate probably close to 100%...they were grossly understaffed and the existing staff was clearly overworked and unhappy to be there. What could go wrong with this scenario?   \\nYour entire front office, including managers need training, and I'm sure even corporate needs training. The negative vibe carried throughout the property and I felt like anything I said would have been blatantly ignored so, I just waited to write this review.  The stay was very expensive and besides our fun within our visitors from out of town, and one pool server, everything else was below motel standard.  \\nCheck in procedures- unfriendly, unprofessional, basically Michelle was clueless she was in the hospitality industry.  \\nRoom- one of our rooms had blood on the shower, yes, sorry to upset you.   The bed had clearly not been made with clean, fresh linens.  Wadded dirty napkins inside.  What the....? Of course we called housekeeping for these infractions.   \\nRestaurants- understaffed to the point that the tables had not been bussed.   Yes, this happened at the JW Marriott during Easter weekend.  They are so casually managed,  I felt I probably would have to clear my own plates.  \\nSecurity- guarding Fort Knox is serious business, now guarding this lazy pool is apparently just as serious.  The hotel security was taking their \\"warden at the penitentiary\\" role very serious.  Security doesn't have to be rude to be effective.  Please and thank you go a long way! \\nNight life- busy, fun, until you want service, then it's 3 attempts, 45 minutes later just to get the right check.  And they kept saying they were charging it to the room.  \\nOur folio would have been a nightmare had we not been vigilant.  They couldn't even keep their guests' checks straight.  I think they were counting on us getting drunk to over-charge us.  Not a trusting environment.   And that's a biggie in my book!  \\nPaid too much money to feel this unhappy.  Sorry but not You earned one star because everything that happened to us could have been avoided.  \\nRyan, our pool attendant.  He was outstanding.

I highly recommend this place to any person that enjoys a good brunch.  The servers are also quite friendly as well.

Once inside there is a waiting area and a window that you walk up to and place your order. Once you place your order you have to wait for it to be cook to order( it was like 20 mins for my food). I ordered the small crab combo $20 and the shrimp plate $12. The shrimp are huge and you get around 12 with 1corn and a lot of potatoes and sausage. The small crab combo came with 1 crab cluster and 6 shrimp, 1 corn, and plenty of potatoes and sausage. This is a TAKE OUT restaurant only. The waiting area was crowded with people waiting for their food but the wait time went by really fast.  They called my name I picked up and I checked my food before I left (always check your food before leaving). They also have a sign posted that states this. I took my food home to eat and was blown away by the taste. The shrimp and the crabs was cooked just right. The butter sauce was right on point for dipping. They give you a fork to eat with BUT I didn't use mine ( that's how good it was) but I did use a lot of napkins (since I use my fingers to eat with)...lol!

I've been to the location on Robson which is now closed, but it was my first time at this location.I came with 2 other friends on Sunday morning around 11:15. We were quoted a 30 minute wait but it turned out to be more like 15, which wasn't too bad. There's indoor seating but also a large outdoor patio with great views of the water. Unfortunately the weather was dreary the day we came with drizzles, so only a handful of the outdoor tables were occupied.This was my first time at this location, but I've been to their other location on Robson (now closed), so I was familiar with the menu. They offer traditional brunch dishes such as omelettes and benedicts as well, but I was here for the pannekoeken. I went with a custom savory pancake with ham, mushroom, and 2 eggs ($15.25).For those that aren't familiar with pannekoeken, they're a large thin pancake roughly 12 inches in diameter. Depending on what toppings you choose, they can put them on top (such as eggs) or mixed into the batter (such as the ham and mushroom).I love how soft and chewy the pannekoeken is. They put a generous amount of toppings inside too so there was something in every bite. The pancake itself is pretty big and I had trouble finishing it, so I took half to go. It heats up well even after being refrigerated, so I was able to enjoy another half of the pancake the next day :) I get random cravings for the pannekoeken here, so I'll definitely be back!"},{"name":"Senova Restaurant","address":"1864 57th Avenue W","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"We dined at this restaurant a week ago.

She brought us back to the front and angrily said we would have to wait.  The front to middle of the restaurant was partially full and the back was wide open so I don't know why the long wait. Finally the disgruntled hostess came back and said I don't know kids are everywhere and proceeded to seat us where mostly adults and teens were sitting and it was quieter.Another 10 minutes and the waitress hadn't appeared.  We left.  Walked right by the hostess who sat us and she looked at us and didn't say a word. There were at least 3 waitresses and the hostess (I use this term lightly as she was neither welcoming nor pleasant )  I don't know why they were so slow.  It certainly wasn't because they were clearing off all the tables because numerous tables still had the plates from the previous customers. The place was not clean,  had torn seats.

It is modern and warm, so a bit different than most Asian restaurants. I was actually excited to try the food here. The menu looked quite attractive. Prices were decent and looking around other patrons' tables, dishes were huge and nicely presented. So we ordered the Soi 9 noodle and Panang Nua (beef curry special). The first few bites were very flavorful. But this is probably the shortcoming of it. In fact the dishes were overly flavored. I barely could taste the natural flavor of the meats and vegetables. The Soi 9 noodle was a stir fried  wide noodle dish with a deep fried, battered combo of seafood and chicken. I didn't like this dish too much. The deep fried meat made the already stir-fried noodles dry and heavy. The Panang Nua is curried beef over a bed of green beans. The beans were cooked just right, still crispy. However the thick and overly spiced sauce made the dish overwhelming.\\n \\nThis was my first experience of northern Thai cuisine. Maybe that's how they do it up there. I was pleasantly surprised with the water subtly flavored with pandan leaf. You can see the pandan leaf soaking in their water pitchers. I thought it was a nice touch.

I'm a sucker for a traditional meatball with red sauce but I tried the chicken Parmesan meatball and sausage meatball as well, traditional was my favorite. So here is how it works. You choose how you want your meatballs, over a pasta or in a sandwich. We chose pasta, i got linguine. It comes with a salad and a piece of yummy bread.

I think the Marquee must have an evil twin or be caught in the Twilight Zone.  First time I ate at the Marquee it was for a friend's birthday.  We had a lovely time, food was great, the place was busy but everything was well timed. The food was hot and we got out in time for our event at the Keller.  Fast forward to last night!  the twilight zone!  On my recommendation four of us went for dinner before the opera.  I made reservations two weeks ahead, knowing it would be busy.  One of our party arrived 1st and was promptly seated..in the bar.  I was a little put off that my reservation made two weeks ago, got me in the bar.  But I got over it..they were busy.  Then we did not see our waiter for 20min..I was getting concerned as the clock was ticking on our dinner hour, he showed up we all promptly ordered dinner.  Due to the lost time we ordered quick cook items..several of us were in the \\"business\\" so we knew we had lost our window for the longer cook times.  \\nAfter 25 min..now 45 mins into our dining experience. I began to look around for our waiter ..our food and maybe more drinks, no one had checked on us. No such luck finding our waiter...but I found the surly owner.  At least she bared a resemblance to the lovely lady I had meet on my previous visit, evil twin...Jekyll and Hyde?  I got the same pat answer as two previous reviewers.  Needless to say our order arrived 15 mins before the start of the show, arriving individually and not cooked to order.  We wolfed down our food and bolted to the Keller.  Madame much as you professed to me and other patrons...you do not know what you are doing, any other establishment, would have comped drinks, brought a basket of bread.  Something !  A kind word,  an explanation and apology.  You have a prime location and opportunity in this place, staff accordingly.  On Opera nights have a pre fixe menu that your kitchen can handle.

After my visit to Barcelona, I was looking forward to enjoying a bit of Spain in Orlando. However, there wasn't much to like as far as the food goes. The Patatas Bravas were good but that was it. I ordered paella vegetales and it was bland and the rice was hard. Authentic paella is red, not white. The bacalao and the side order of rice were also bland. The flan was very loose and tasted more like maizena (corn starch based pudding) than traditional flan. The service was ok, although we didn't get any bread like everyone else. The flamenco entertainment was nice. Much more modern than their Spanish counterparts, but enjoyable to watch nevertheless. The manager adjusted the bill based on my feedback, so that was good.

The cashier and cook were very friendly and seemed pleasantly surprised that I had ever eaten this style of food before.  The chicken was cooked fresh on the grill and there was some that didn't fit on the sandwich which the cook put into a bowl with some fresh hummus for me while I was waiting.  I totally had to restrain myself from licking the bowl!  The chicken schwarma sandwich is reasonably priced around $5 and comes with tons of toppings including hummus and hot sauce (I recommend them both).  I opted for the combo which adds a drink and fresh side and I ordered the tabouleh which I did not enjoy.  It looked delicious but the ratio of parsley to the other ingredients was way to high and I couldn't eat more then two bites.  I look forward to returning and trying some of their other food, including the fresh meat schwarma roasting on a spit.  As far as the restaurant itself, the decorations seem minimal and chintzy, there were a few flies buzzing around which I know could have been a one time thing but still ruin the vibe.

My husband and I decided to come here for a late dinner last Saturday evening, a little before 10:30 pm. Luckily this place closes at 12 am. We were greeted by the hostess and brought over to a table. But my husband had requested a booth instead and the hostess lead us to one nearby. After browsing the menu, we ended up getting:BBQ Brisket Burger, $12.50 prior to tax + Substitute Baked Beans For Fries, $1.95 prior to tax- All burgers come with fries, but my husband figured he would like beans with his barbecue brisket instead (I appreciated that our server did inform us about the additional fee for this request. I never like it when servers do not tell you about additional fees and find out about it on the bill instead). This burger definitely was meaty and juicy. Great barbecue taste throughout. This burger had smoked bacon, red onions, cheese and fried crispy onions on top of the patty, which made for additional flavor and texture. I thought it was kind of cool to see that the burger bun was branded with \\"Ford's Garage\\" on top. I didn't have any of my husband's baked beans but he did like it (I typically would prefer fries or a salad with my burger but my husband isn't much of a potato guy). This was definitely plenty for one person to feel full and satisfied.Grilled Chicken Cobb Salad, $11.99 prior to tax- I requested to omit the cheese and have both bacon and dressing on the side. Having been traveling and eating out for the past few nights on our vacation, I really wanted some vegetables. So I decided upon this. I liked the large pieces of tender and juicy chicken in this salad. I also liked the tomatoes used in this salad, the avocados and the sliced hard boiled egg. This salad was fresh and very colorful and felt satisfied with my meal. Funky Buddha Floridian Hefeweizen, $5 prior to tax- Surprisingly a pretty good German wheat beer that was pretty refreshing. Also nice to try a local beer. \\n----------------------------\\n(Total= $33.80 after tax, prior to tip)Our server, Courtney, was friendly, delightful and attentive. She was great at checking up on us without being intrusive and helpful at answering my questions regarding the menu. We also enjoyed the small talk that we made with her during our dining experience. She also was so kind to bring us a small bowl of ice cream because we had mentioned it was our little girl dog's birthday (dog friendly outdoor seating is available). And yes my little girl did enjoy the ice cream (we only gave her a few bites of it and left the rest). In addition to having a positive dining experience, I really loved seeing all of the decor in this restaurant. There are 2 Model T Ford cars, car parts and so forth to really play up the Ford Garage theme. There really are so many things all around this restaurant that you will notice when you arrive (including the gear hose clamp used as a napkin ring and the actual napkin used is a blue car rag). This car theme also continues into the restroom in which a gasoline nozzle is a facet over a tire sink. Please note that the sink is not motion centered by that there is a small lever to turn it on (I figured this out after trying to get the sink to go on and saw a few other women have trouble in the restroom trying to wash their hands too and told them of my new found glory on how to turn on the sink). Overall, this restaurant whole heartedly earns 5 stars for the food and experience.

The Standard Burger with Pimento cheese (made fresh; I can tell) and hand cut fries and I got the honey glaze for the fries on the side. I'd definitely recommend getting the honey, it's sweet but also has a little kick to it and it's perfect for fries. Or wings ( I hope they put it on wings).

I'm still floored that this place is so positively yelped.  \\nIt was a good move to come at an off hour on a weekday.  There was no wait, though it was definitely busy, and we were sat in the patio area after a few minutes.  \\nWe ordered the wings that everyone goes nuts for. Literally, the way some yelpers talked about these wings, I question what they usually eat if these wings are \\"a little slice of heaven.\\" They are sticky and salty, and for $15, I am still shaking my head, no. The guy that served it dropped it off saying, \\"This is what keeps the lights on in this place.\\" After the first bite, I was- to put it mildly- confused.  Each wing comes with the drumette, wing, and wingtip (which is why everyone keeps saying they are big), but they were just okay.  Believe the critical yelps that tell you they are salty, I can see why they are served with the vegetables-it is not just a garnish, you will probably want them to cut the salt.  \\nAdditionally, we ordered the Neua Naam Tok (Flank Steak Salad), again $16 for a very small dish, that came looking unappetizing, which for me, could totally be overlooked if the taste compensated for its lack of aesthetics.  Unfortunately, it was sour and salty.  The menu recommends pairing it with sticky rice, which I did.  But the rice was gone too soon because to make that dish bearable, one would have to ingest quite a bit of rice to balance the flavoring, and for $3+ for a small bamboo cylinder of rice (picture small paper scroll container), yeah, that didn't do it. *Everyone in my party also commented that the sticky rice was a little harder than what we are used to.\\nI think the only thing that was kinda worth it was the Pok Pok special.  It comes with their rotisserie chicken, two sauces for dipping, papaya salad, and sticky rice, all for about $19.  The chicken was average, but my husband said he really liked the dipping sauce ($19 for dipping sauce LOL), papaya salad was good, and I could really see someone getting full from it, but it would not be something you'd dream about coming back for, it was just decent.  \\nProbably shouldn't have, but we did; we ordered the mango sticky rice.

A good bit of the menu is prepared sous vide, which leaves everything extremely tender. My favorite was the octopus, which was by far the most tender of any I've ever had. If you have the impression that octopus or calamari tends to be chewy or rubbery, Veritas will definitely correct this misperception. Side note, there's a whole other bar upstairs that also serves similar mixology-type cocktails.

As our party showed up at slightly different times, a few of us enjoyed some libations at the bar. My go to at the bar was the Negroni which tasted fairly standard (nothing to write home about). However, my friends got the Erv (spell check) which was delicious. I believe the concept was a blend of two types of cocktails (bourbon and a martini?). In any event, I was tempted to get one, but wanted to be able to fully enjoy the dining experience. KR set us up in the center of the dining room underneath the chandelier which worked out well for our large group. Rick was our waiter and I'll cut to the chase; he was awesome. Rick attended to our dinner in a professional demeanor with proper suggestions when asked. I opted to begin with the thick cut bacon as an appetizer. It was presented on a thin but long plate with the bacon cut into squares. The shape seemed odd, but in the end the bacon tasted delicious. The gentlemen sitting next to me ordered the short rib appetizer and it was quite good. Preparing for the main course, I decided to order a glass of a recommended Cabernet. When it came time to order, I went with the 16 ounce filet, medium rare, with orders each of their peppercorn and black truffle butter sauces. Caesar salad started the main course and it was good, not fantastic. It tasted to have been prepared slightly earlier in the evening (maybe ingredients were too chilly). Perhaps they should offer a table side Caesar. In any event the filet came out shortly, but not too short after the Caesar. It looked amazing and was certainly cooked correctly. The taste was on point and you could tell it was good meat. The wine paired very well with the steak (I enjoy a good red wine with steak). The sauces complimented the steak taste and everything in that moment was divine. After relaxing from our meals and enjoying good conversation, we opted for dessert to which I chose the flour-less option (Gluten free). The dessert was good and not too much after a meal like that. Also- I must mention that the whole table split a bunch of sides. My favorites were the charred cream corn and whipped potatoes. Scallop potatoes came as a close second.TL;DR: Great service, awesome wine selection, some good cocktails on the menu, steak and sides are way above average.

When the table was ready for us, one of the staff pointed us at the general direction of our table but did not actually bring us to the table. This wouldn't have been an issue had there not been a section full of open tables that looked exactly the same. I felt this was unprofessional and unfitting for a place like this. Then again, Coquille seems confused as what it wants to be as the decor/ambiance seems a bit more upscale, yet the classic rock they blast doesn't match the aesthetic at all. For the appetizer, I ordered the dungeness crab pierogies. It was a couple of dollars extra on top of the DOVF menu price but I decided to go for it any way. They were served lukewarm and devoid of seasoning. I also tried their tuna tartare which had a nice balance of flavours but the \\"crispy rice\\" underneath could more accurately be described as chewy sticky rice.For my entree, I went with the slow cooked fillet of trout. They might as well not have cooked it as it was served at room temperature and raw inside. Interestingly, the other entrees we were served were at least warm which tells me the kitchen lacks some serious timing skills. They did remake it after I brought it to our server's attention but this did take another 20 minutes and even so the fish was pretty bland. The rice pudding dessert was on the watery side but okay overall. The soft serve sundaes seemed a bit out of place but were pretty decent. All in all, a pretty mediocre performance from both the kitchen and front of house.

Remember to fairly tip your server.Prices are a bit of a mystery.  Lunch, weekend lunch, dinner, weekend dinner and then you consider holidays and it really gets confusing.

We have eaten here many times since it opened and have enjoyed the Huevos Rancheros, the Taquitos and breakfast tacos. Today we ate there for lunch. First of all, the service was terrible. Chips and salsa were very slow in coming and the waitress literally put only about 1/2 inch of salsa in the bowl. She was slow to do everything. I am giving 2 stars because my food (Taquitos) was good even though the Charro beans were served lukewarm. My husband ordered 2 Barbacoa Tostadas. He said one of them was inedible because the sour cream was spoiled and the Barbacoa didn't taste right. The other one had the same spoiled sour cream on it, but the Barbacoa was edible.

You can find more details about their story on the restaurant's website but I thought that it would be worth sharing since its pretty cool!\\nLocated in Union Sqaure, there are 2 floors. The first floor is cocktail and rum bar, wheras the basement is where the restaurant is located. The flight of stairs that take you down are unique, the wall next to the railing consists of a whole row of white doors. I almost felt as if I was entering Bonobis' casa, or house.\\nThe seating area downstairs is very cozy. There are several tables, as well as a bar. The waitress brought us plantain chips with an asparagus dip- these were so good. I've never had asparagus dip before but it was great! The cocktail menu has a heavy focus on rum- after all, rum comes from Latin American countries as well as Puerto Rico. (The Bicardi factory is in Puerto Rico). You can also do a rum flight if you want to taste different types of rum. I decided to get a glass of red wine made with tempranillo grapes. We started with the raw tuna over plantain with wasabi aioli. I was like raw tuna to be over rice... like sushi... but was pleasantly surprised that it paired well with the sweet plantain. We also ordered empanadas- these came out fresh and crisp, with lots of cheese.\\nWe also tried the Colombian arepas with fish. These were very filling too. The fish was topped with guacamole and pickled radishes. \\nFor desert, we had the orange creme brulee.

We were looking for a relax Sunday brunch spot, and since we hadn't been to Flying Biscuit Cafe in awhile, we decided to go. When we got there it was about a 20 min wait which wasn't too bad. I expected a wait since it was Sunday and a lot of people do brunch on Sundays. When we were seated our waitress was pretty prompt in getting our order. I pretty much already knew what I wanted as I had looked at the menu prior to getting to the restaurant. My sister unfortunately made a quick choice and settled on something.I got the high flyer which came with chicken sausage (I asked for none, but still got them) I got turkey bacon instead (which they did put), I got wheat toast instead of the biscuit, eggs (I had egg whites with cheese),and the oatmeal pancakes with the peach compote. It comes with grits, but I opted out of them. I had an expectation for the pancakes as I've had a friend make oatmeal banana pancakes before that were really good. These pancakes were just ok. They weren't all that, and the peach compote wasn't all that good either. It seemed like they used canned peaches and made a symboled syrup. Although I didn't want the sausage, I decided to try it since I actually never had and it tasted like regular sausage links but just chicken instead. I'm not really a fan of sausage links or patty's, but I ate them lol.\\nAll in all, it was just an average meal for me. Nothing stood out and was great. My sister also didn't enjoy her meal and was very underwhelmed. She did say the grits were really good though.

The noodles were very oily, not sure why. The catfish was decent. No hint of mud taste but the breading was a little on the thick side. I would give this restaurant a B-. Everyone had talked this restaurant up and I was expecting to have my mind and taste buds blown away. I wasn't.

My friend and I were told the wait for 2 people was 1 hour, but we got lucky and found seats in one of the bar areas within 20 minutes.

So, I thought I try again with their regular menu, and I am a fan of the place. First of all, great cocktail. I love the liquor, especially dark liquor collection. The bartenders are awesome. As for appetizer, I had some oysters and lobster. What I experience was fresh seafood, clean and crisp taste, and light texture. I highly recommend trying these items for appetizers when you are here. As for the entree, I tried the restaurant's ribeye, medium. The ribeye came out medium, so it was an amazing sign. The ribeye was a thick cut, almost like a filet thickness, but with powerful flavors. Not from the overseasoning or seasoning, but the pure meat itself. The restaurant did not mask the meat with makeup of seasonings, but rather, it tried to emphasize the quality of the meat with light seasoning. Yes, it was juicy and moist. Yes, it had flavor. Yes, it worth the price. Yes, it an amazing quality of meat. As for the sides, I wasn't too big on the broccolini, however, I really enjoyed the cream of spinach and truffle fries. The restaurant did not overly salt the sides, which I really appreciated. Example, Bone's Steakhouse sides are super salty, which I really can't understand why except to make people drink alcohol more. Anyway, the broccolini was a miss, but the other two sides were great. The cream of spinach was smooth and reminded me of a coconut milk texture. That's how smooth it was. I don't remember the last time I had an amazing ribeye steak, and Kevin Rathbun Steak is in the front in the Atlanta area. Of course there are other great steakhouses, which serve dryaged porterhouse, filet, and etc. However, purely from just ribeye point of view, try this place. If you want dryaged steaks of course other places are available. I don't think Kevin Rathbun serves dryaged, so if you want that, try Chops or Bones. No dessert because I was with dudes. Usually, desserts are in the picture when there is a girl or girls during my dining experience."},{"name":"Kasbah Moroccan Cafe","address":"201 NW Davis St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Girlfriend took me here for my birthday.

I've dined at their Billerica many times and a huge fan of their authentic Sichuan cuisine.My coworkers and I went on a Wednesday at noon and the place was already jammed pack.  There was a wait for a table, I couldn't believe it! The restaurant had only been open for a short period of time but word has already got out.You can order off the full menu or get a rice plate combo from the lunch menu.  The lunch menu was very limited with \\"western\\" Chinese food.  There were only 5 options that were served with rice and a choice of eggroll or crab rangoon:General Tso Chicken $8.95\\nBeef with broccoli $8.95\\nChicken with cashew $7.95\\nKung Pao Chicken $7.95\\nLo Mein with Chicken or veggies $7.95The Sichuan lunch specials was a bit more lengthy with options such as Ma Po tofu, double cooked bacon, beef with hot peppers, smokey chicken, just to name a few.  Those combos were served with either hot and sour soup or egg drop soup.  Prices were reasonable and were between $7.95 and $8.95.Each menu item had a red pepper icon near it to indicate the level of spice. One pepper meant \\"Hot & Spicy\\" whereas two peppers meant \\"very spicy.\\" Good to know!It seemed like most of the other tables dined family style and ordered large entrees off the regular menu. I saw casserole dishes, veggies, Old Sichuan chicken, and large fish entrees come out of the kitchen.Our group opted for the lunch special with the soup.  Sichuan cuisine is very flavorful, spicy and GREASY! There is hot chili oil in almost everything! This is not a place to visit if you are watching your caloric intake but it's also not something you would eat regularly.  We started off with the soups and an order of the Chengdu spicy dumplings. The soup lacked flavor but the dumplings were good.For the lunch option, I chose the double cooked bacon. I wished there bacon was pan fried or a bit more crispy.  The pork in my dish was on the rubbery side unlike the version I've had in Billerica.The Pork with Yu Xiang sauce was overwhelming with all the bamboo, mushrooms and vegetable medley. It was hard to tell what I was eating.My coworker Webby is a huge fan of the pan fried noodles so he went with the chicken pan fried noodles from the regular menu. He said it was very good!Service was very quick! We were seated, order and ate our meal within 30 minutes. Lots of time to spare before needing to get back to the office.

The only hiccup was that they made my Assam Pedes (delicious) with fish instead of chicken, but charged us the chicken price when I told them I didn't mind eating the fish. My Mom got the basil flat noodle, which is a good dish for non-spicy eaters. My Dad got a similar dish with tofu, but very spicy. NOTE: If you order an \\"8\\" on their 1-10 spiciness scale, it will be VERY hot (this coming from someone who loves spicy food).We also ordered a sushi appetizer, which was very good.

The Sicilian Hash is composed of a 12 hour braised beef, served with potatoes and a parmesan scramble. The beef was soft and tender and the scramble was airy and light. You can tell that this dish was made with a whole lotta TLC. We also ordered the Hawthorne, saut√©ed veggies and potatoes. We figured our diet could use something healthier and the veggies were cooked perfectly.Lastly, we ordered the biscuits and gravy.

From the outside, one might easily walk right past this place, but the inside is pretty nice.  We liked the way it was decorated - very tastefully with an Italian flair - and we liked that it was clean, and well kept, but therein lies the fatal flaw.  All of the surfaces, the floors, the walls, and the ceiling were hard.  That means that sounds echo easily, and it gets noisy very fast. When we were there for lunch, it was near their closing time, (they have limited lunch hours, only serving from 11:30 to 2:00), so there weren't many people there.  There was one table of four that was just finishing their meal, and enjoying light conversation.  I do not think they were too loud, but, when one lady started laughing, I seriously could not hear what my wife was saying to the waitress, and both were standing right next to me.  Just that much noise actually hurt my ears, and was enough to make me think I didn't want to be in there in the evening when the place was really busy, and really noisy.  If, however, noise is not a problem for you, the food is really good.  One thing to really like about this place is that they use locally grown products.

I do not know how they get locally grown products this time of year, or that all of the vegetables were entirely locally grown, but that salad tasted \\"Summer\\" fresh to us.  We shared the large, \\"Misto,\\" salad, and could not have been happier.  For our entree, we shared the \\"Funghi e Zucca\\" pizza, and it was delightful.  My wife was surprised I wanted that one because I prefer tomato sauce on my pizza, but this one with a garlic cream sauce instead, was a treat to my taste buds.  Not only was the crust perfect, and the sauce great, but the whole pizza was a symphony of flavors and textures comparable to few I've ever enjoyed.  I would definitely recommend this place and this pizza to friends, and I will dine here again when I am in Louisville, even though I probably will avoid it at night if it's as noisy as I suspect.  After things quieted down, we enjoyed our entire meal, including the wine.  We had a bottle of their least expensive red wine of the north, and found it to be a perfect accompaniment to that dinner, even though most probably wouldn't make the pairing we did.  If it's not to noisy, give it a try.  I think you'll find this place to be every bit as good as \\"Leaf\\" in Boulder, except with a different menu."},{"name":"Friendly's","address":"1469 Providence Hwy","city":"Norwood","stars":"2.5","text":"I personally love Friendly's, and I think it is very convenient and has almost everything.

My only complaints are I wish they had the buffalo chicken sandwich more often, and the prices are pretty high - $15 for most sandwiches. On the plus side, they're easily big enough for two lunches, so it's not quite as bad if you split it up into two days.

Burger or Farmburger or... (fill in blank)We sat at the bar. Despite the absence of students and the mid-afternoon hour, there were a few customers. It seemed promising. The server was exceedingly nice. Where do I begin, exactly?To street park on Auburn, the minimum time is 1 hour. I got over my irritation when I realized it only cost $1, and when I later discovered the hour was insufficient due to the slow service (I'm getting ahead of myself).The menu was nice, the decor kind of cute-urban-chic, and there are signs with drinks named for Spelman and Georgia Tech and other local universities/colleges scattered above the bar.We ordered two diet Cokes. She poured our drinks and came back to apologize, saying she was out of diet so she gave us Coke Zero. I wasn't too irritated, but I would have liked a heads-up before the Coke Zero was poured. That stuff is disgusting. We were served in two styrofoam cups. The other women at the bar were drinking from glasses. I ordered a fish burger and sweet potato fries. My dining companion ordered a cheeseburger, sweet potato fries and a salad. The server came back after that and let us know they were out of sweet potato fries. She was really nice about it. We said regular fries were fine. She also asked if we'd ordered a fish and a veggie burger, and we said, no, a fish and a beef burger. After waiting 25 minutes, the food finally came out. I'm fine with waiting 25 minutes at certain places, but a restaurant with pre-fab food (see below) is not one of them, particularly when it is almost empty. The salad never came. My fish burger was fine. The fish was fried quite well, although it was flavorless. The fries were totally forgettable. The bun was gross. My dining companion says of her burger: \\"It makes Five Guys look like a burger made out of ground filet mignon in comparison.\\" And her bun was cold, as though it had come directly out of the refrigerator. It also came out cheeseless, so she asked for a piece of cheese. The piece of cheese came in a styrofoam bowl. Classic.Then, when we tried to order a piece of pie, because we wanted to make sure we used the $20 on the LivingSocial voucher, plus a little extra, so we could run the credit card and give the server a tip, she informed us the owner had ordered new menus and put them out, but didn't yet have all the menu items available.First of all, who puts out new menus before the kitchen is ready to prepare the new items? And second, why not tell us there were unavailable items when we sat down?At that point, I used my handy Yelp app and read a previous reviewer had discovered, via the manager, that the beef (and probably everything else) was from Sysco. That is disgusting. Really? In a town with burger places that serve locally sourced stuff, or even just higher-quality beef from unknown places, that is kind of ridiculous.We ordered a pina colada. She served us the pina colada, unmixed, in an 8-oz. plastic cup. Another woman at the bar ordered an alcoholic drink and got hers in a pint glass.When we tried to pay with a credit card, the server told us the credit card machine had been down all day. That information would have been helpful before we ordered. Or even before we sat down. That's what signs are for. An example would be: \\"Cash only/unable to accept credit cards. Apologies for the inconvenience.\\" The server was really nice and said we didn't have to pay, but we thought that wouldn't be appropriate, so we are going back to give her the amount we owe the restaurant, plus her tip, in cash. By the way, nothing seems to be actually made onsite. It is all cooked onsite. There's a difference. The fries were totally pre-fab. Come on, even Five Guys serves fresh-cut fries!I know I keep harping on the styrofoam and plastic cups. I don't know what happened. There are a few possibilities that come to mind. Perhaps people who eat with coupons or other \\"deals\\" get the disposable stuff, but we at least got real plates and flatware. Perhaps they were out of clean cups. The solution to that would be to run the dishes through the washer. Perhaps we just weren't the right kind of people. We were the only people in there who weren't African American, and as non-white non-black people of color, I sometimes wonder if other people are just tolerating us. The solution to keep us from wondering if we got served in crappy disposable cups because we aren't black or white is to let us know they're out of dishes. Something! Tell me something!The women's bathroom was dirty, and whoever re-did their floor for them let building materials splatter all over the base of the toilet.

OK! I am there! This place recently opened and is fairly new. I am assuming they are still trying to work out the kinks and see what best fits their style. Taipei 101 is a small little shop in a plaza on Alafaya Tr. serving home-style Taiwanese food. It holds around 8 tables and probably has a capacity of about 35 at the most. We came earlier than the usual lunch crowd and there was no one there before 12. When we left more people showed up so I suggest coming a little earlier if you want it for lunch.Like I was saying - they are still trying to figure out what works best for them, so there was a slight confusion of whether to order at our table or order up front at the counter but we ended up ordering at the counter which was fine bc it makes it more casual. I kind of think they should keep it that way. The menu items are cheap! Like really..that's how much it costs?! Now onto the food - we order LOTS of food! I mean like feed the whole village. We had popcorn chicken (chicken bites/nuggets), fried tofu, fried chicken steak, spicy beef noodle soup, pork belly over rice, AND pork chop combo. *somethings are appetizer size such as tofu/nuggets*To make this review short - the best thing was pork belly over rice. It comes with an egg and sliver of Taiwanese sausage with two slices of braised pork belly. The flavor tastes pretty good - soysauce based with like 5 spice.The rest of the other things I order were okay and little under seasoned. The spicy beef noodle soup wasn't really spicy but she gave us hot sauce on the side. The popcorn chicken is normally like a salt and pepper with spices tossed but it didn't have the usual crunch of Taiwanese popcorn chicken and lacked seasoning.It is family owned and they were super nice.

As for food, we started off with the wagyu short rib and lobster fritters, both we delicious but hands down the wagyu stood out the most. For our main, we both ordered steaks and they were cooked perfectly we paired those with the creamed corn and mash potato. Get the creamed corn you won't regret it.

Cleaner, well stocked and healthier than your average buffet or salad bar joint.  One of my favorite things is how they have monthly themes and the change out their items frequently - not a fan of Greek month? Then come back next month for Strawberry Month!  When you come in, you have a well stocked salad bar with all your normal items in addition to some great pre-made salads.  You then get a seat and can go at your leisure to get pasta, soups, fruit, breads, muffins, potatoes or desert.   The chicken noodle soup is always a hit along with the garlic foccacia.The downsides to this location are the lines - this is the ONLY location on this side of town and the lines often stretch out the door which means you have a good 20-30 minutes to get through the salad bar and to be seated.   Avoid like the plague if it is a holiday weekend or Sunday brunch time.

This is hands down the most visited restaurant my girlfriend and I go to in ATL. Everyone has said it, but what makes this place so great is the half off sushi rolls when you dine in for dinner. All the sushi we've ordered so far off the menu has been great (except the Spider Roll).I highly recommend the Volcano Roll, Lenox Roll, and the Lion King Roll as they are all packed with flavor and are the best of their specialty rolls. For regular sushi rolls, we tend to stick with the spicy salmon, eel, and avacado rolls (all rolls i mentioned are in the picture except the avacado).Service has been really great. One of the servers, Jeff, always takes care of us whenever we come in. He's given us unique sauces to try, made us great drinks, and always makes sure our waters are full.Decor and environment is a little boring, but they have TVs playing sports in the background sometimes so that's always a plus.TLDR: Great sushi at great value, good service.

In terms of cost, you'll walk out spending $9-15 per salad; totally fair pricing considering that you're getting something really good, really fresh and really fast.

We get there around 6:15 p.m. for dinner and sit on the patio. Our waitress comes and takes our drink orders. It takes about 5 minutes for her to bring us our drinks which wasn't a big deal. We then order food. I order a club sandwich and tots and my wife orders a burger with no cheese and she wanted to add bacon with a side order of tots. Pretty simple orders. 35 minutes later we still had not gotten our food. The waitress told us multiple times that our food was next out but that obviously was not the case since it took so long. Finally our food comes out and right away I see that her burger has cheese on it. (She made it very clear she did not want cheese). I tell the waitress and she takes it back. Not 1 minute later another burger is brought out with no cheese. We are confused as to how we waited over 30 minutes for our meals and when something was wrong they immediately bring out a new burger? The new burger did not have cheese but it also did not have the bacon that she asked for. I had to flag the waitress down again and ask for some bacon so she could add it her self to the burger. In the meantime, we still did not have napkins or ketchup. I had to ask for both and we ended up only receiving the napkins, no ketchup. At that point we were fed up with the service and just wanted to get out of there. As we were eating, I asked the waitress to go ahead and bring the check because I feared it may take a significant amount of time because the food took so long. She sarcastically said \\"I can go get it in 30 seconds, is that fast enough for you?\\" She got us the check and just threw it on the table. Those were the last words she spoke to us. No \\"have a nice day\\" or \\"Is there anything else I can get for you?\\" Horrible customer service. We paid and left. I like to think of myself as very understanding when it comes to things like this. If the waitress would have just kindly said that they were short handed or the restaurant was very busy, I would have definitely understood.

Was I at the right place at the wrong time?  Not to sound snooty but the food here was no where near the authentic flavor of true Thai food.  This is equal to being more so one of those nostalgic I tried it once places than being true to the cuisine being served.  I'll skip the opening act and skip right to the point.  Let us begin with the Neua Naam Tok.  The dressing was actually decent a nice combo of fishy citrus heat.  The beef however was dry almost beef jerky like.  Too well done and chewy.  At $14 you would expect it to be at least average, this may go down as one of the worst beef dishes I have ever had.Second Act, Khao Soi with chicken.  Now when you think of a curry based coconut milk soup you are thinking a colorful milky delicious broth.  When you read pickled mustard greens, shallots and crispy yellow noodles I am picturing a decoratively presented with some sliced seasoned chicken on top.  When the dish arrived first thought is what in the hell is this?  No joke it looked like someone cooked chinese wonton egg noodles, put it into a bowl of clearish broth and tossed in some onions and what looked like mustard greens.  At the bottom of the bowl after sifting through the noodles, two whiter than white boiled, YES boiled pieces of chicken (leg and thigh).  The dish, think if you cooked packaged egg noodles and did not put in enough of the powdered broth seasoning.  The chicken tastes as described, boiled.  Final scene, Kaeng Heng Leb.  What is there to say but four brown chunks of pork shoulder reasonably tender but very overly salted.  Did not even finish the dish, had it not been almost $15 probably would not have taken it to go.

I called the next day to see if they had anything else to no avail.  They did indicate that they leave tables open for walk-ins so we opted to chance it.  We arrived around 6:15 on a Friday and were told that the wait would be about and hour and fifteen minutes.  We hung out next to the bar and got drinks in the meantime.

It's nice a dimly lit in the evening and I can only imagine that it's clean and fresh looking during the day and for brunch.  Once we were seated, my biggest turn off was our server.  We were new to the restaurant, but he didn't ask about that and didn't seem to be willing to offer any suggestions.  He seemed interested in getting us fed and getting us out.  We ended up ordering a selection of a dozen oysters (three each of four types) and they were perfect.  Fresh and tasty -- no confusion from the guy who dropped them off about which was which (they clearly have a solid system in place).  They also have a great array of sauces for you to enjoy with your oysters, which was a nice touch.My husband enjoyed his fish dish and our friend seemed to enjoy his fish as well, but it was the whole fish just on his plate -- eyes and all.  He had a lot of bones to contend with, but I think he liked it overall.  I had the seafood casserole and thought it was tasty but that the seafood ended up a little rubbery.  There was a ton of seafood, so that was good, but I just didn't love it.I think if our server had been great I would have left with a better impression.  It just kind of ruined the experience for me given that I went in with such excitement and high expectations.

The server was a female and was super distracted when explaining the specials and menu items. She didn't really want to be there and you can tell. She totally effed up our order and never brought out our steak salad. We asked for a plate 4 times to 4 different servers and no one gave us one. So when my friend grabbed a plate from an empty table, the bus boy police told her she couldn't do that. Still, no one ever never apologized or asked how we were doing.

'Gino's Favorite' is also mine, although everything I've tried has been delicious, including the not-so-Italian Sturgeon special one night. The food is well-portioned (but not overly so), and the wine glasses/pours are very generous.

At first glance, their menu appears to have fewer options than some other pho restaurants I've been to, however it's really the same options in a simpler format.  You pick whether you want medium or large, and then choose up to 3 meats to add to your pho.I also tried the vermicelli noodle bowl, and one person I dined with stated she enjoyed it even more than the pho.  I added the beef, egg rolls and shrimp.  The pork was quite tasty and tender and the egg rolls added a nice crunchy texture.The restaurant is fairly large, and there have always been plenty of tables when I've been.

Kevin Rathbun is my favorite steak house of all time. I still enjoy New York Prime, but if I have a choice I will also go for KRS. Every time I am here I try to forget about my wallet and just order anything that sounds good to me at the moment. I always get the filet and at least 3-5 sides and appetizers. The steaks are from Allen Brothers in Chicago and are truly wonderful cuts. I love the jalapeno creamed corn (not spicy at all really, the perfect amount of heat), the mac & cheese, the ahi tuna, and twice baked potatoes. Make sure you ask about and order one of the specials, my favorite has been some brandied locally grown carrots. The only thing I have not enjoyed was the jumbo lump crab cake.For desert, I also usually order 2 or 3! The black bottom creme brulee is to die for. I literally have dreams about it, and will probably sneak into the bar next week just to have it and a glass of wine. Another favorite is the banana and caramel crepes.Kevin is also a delight. He always stops by our table or the bar to say hi and chat, he is a wonderful, interesting man and a joy to talk to. I always feel like he cares about his customers and his food. The servers are great, the bartenders too. They have always given me good guidance on wine selection and provided that friendly, polite, fast service that is so important - the service that is so good your drink is never less than half full but you didn't notice anyone filling it up. One of the most important things to me is that even though I am young and look even younger, I am never treated like I am not good enough to be there, or ignored in favor of patrons that are older and therefore assumed to tip more. This reason is why I sadly stopped going to Bones and Chops."},{"name":"Flying Biscuit Caf√© - Howell Mill","address":"857 Collier Rd NW, Ste 16","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"You know...

We showed up on a Saturday morning around 11, typically brunch rush, and waited about 20 minutes for our table, not bad! We ordered our food about 10 minutes after sitting and it took almost 30 minutes to get! I ordered the Eggs Benedict and a friend got the steak and eggs breakfast.My eggs benedict was okay - not the best not the worst. The eggs were cooked together so they weren't separated onto the individual muffins which was weird and then the hollandaise was cold. I ordered potatoes with the meal and it seemed like some of the potatoes were undercooked. The steak was great though! The steak was well seasoned and cooked medium rare and a great filling meal. I can definitely say they give large portions for a good price so that's a major plus! Overall - flying biscuit is now like an Ihop to me.

She brought out a different menu which highlights the plates that are peanut free. So great.\\nWe ordered the wings, Khao Soi, a order of rice and Kaeng Hang.\\nWings: I understand why this is a popular dish. The wings were wonderfully cooked, moist and juicy on the inside but crispy on the outside.  I will say the sweetness is wonderful and the first bites taste oh so good. Towards the end if you aren't sharing or are, we were adding rice because it can becoming overpowering. The spice is manageable and I do think it adds a wonderful layer of sweet and spice without going too far.\\nKhao Soi- Unfortunately this was just a okay dish to us. Others in the table are very familiar with this dish because of family so they felt it was lacking flavor. They felt that it was somewhat bland. I do agree, it was a okay dish. It had flavor but it wasn't a wow in comparison to the other dishes.\\nKaeng Hang- This was also a table favorite. It looks like a stew, therefore both the meat and the juices are wonderful. We love to just add the juice to our rice and that in itself has so much flavor. The pork is so soft, completely falls apart and has great flavor.\\nOverall the food was wonderful. We still think of the dishes back at home and wished we had somewhere similar in SF.

Server came 5 minutes later - she seemed really disinterested then and the attitude continued throughout. After taking our order (drinks and food) 20 more minutes passed - we were about to leave when drinks finally arrived. Food came 15 minutes later: Cold fries (we each got about 6 in our basket) and the burgers were..meh - semi-cold. Most disinterested server I've ever seen anywhere. When one of us asked for a fry refill, she said \\"That will be about five minutes\\" and actually proceeded to walk out of the door of the restaurant into the mall area (cig break?) instead of placing the order. Re-entered 10 minutes later. The front desk host staff kept peering around the restaurant entry periodically in a covert way and whispering to each other- not sure what they were looking for - maybe to see if the staff was working? They sure didn't ask customers if they were being served. On visiting the ladies room before leaving, it was filthy. Overflowing paper waste bins, greasy fingerprints all over the bathroom stall doors, a yellow 'Caution' stand on the floor...looked like it hadn't been attended to all day. Do better, Red Robin!

Yet with so many reviews to read - (261 at last count) how would one ever begin to decide WHICH 5-star rating to choose from?Well folks, I've complied a list of my favorite Powell's quotes from the 260 reviews before mine...and if you're kind enough to FUK (cough*funny, useful, cool*cough) the daylights out of my review - it may just pop up to the top for others to read and enjoy.Here we go:-I love books.  This store has books, a lot of books.  I love this store.-Powell's is also known as this geek's version of heaven.-What can be said that hasn't already been said about Powell's?-If I were to become an orphan because of Powell's I would demand that they let me live in The Purple Room, because really it's their fault I have no family!-This is like the Virgin Megastore of books but not shitty. -Powell's presents a damn fine argument for why someone should move to Portland. I ramble about Powell's to anyone who will listen.-Simply the greatest independent bookstore in the US.-Overheard at Powell's last Saturday \\"Dude, no....seriously....they sell meatballs at Ikea.\\" -I really enjoy this place, despite the fact I very rarely read books.-It was a fantastical, amazing fun time perusing all the books and dare I say, almost orgasmic?-I don't even know what the hell to say about this store.-That's right -- Powell's gets you laid.  Go there now.-They should post a DANGER! DANGER! sign at the entrance to warn people that they WILL be buying books.-Kinda ridiculous is right, but yes, if you are a book lover and a graduate of the Derek Zoolander Center For Children Who Can't Read Good And Wanna Learn To Do Other Stuff Good Too, then you will dig this place.-Every single time, Powell's hypnotizes me into buying armfuls of books I will never have time to read.  Damn you, Powell's.-Give yourself ample time to browse (several days may be needed).-Just pretend your credit card is a library card and all will be well.-This is so obvious that it's not even worth stating. -I was at Powell's not long ago after consuming two glasses of wine on an empty stomach.  That was even better than Powell's sober - - highly recommended.-You will love it ... spend hours in it ... grow addicted ... and then read and get all learn'ed inside.-Neil Diamond sings \\"Baby I love you\\" to you Powells.-Awesome labyrinth style book store. You will get lost. Let me repeat, you will get lost. -It's Powell's - bring an oxygen tank, a change of clothes, some trail mix...It's a bookstore - take allergy meds, bring hand sanitizer.-Awesome bookstore, but didn't live up to the hype at all. I would rate it 3 stars for the disappointment but fear being found and beaten on the street.-Simply stepping into Powell's makes my heart pitter-patter and my mind feel like it's just had a giant, erm, lovemaking session.-This book store is probably just too awesome for the average faint of heart book worm.-Truly, the mecca of any bibliophile. There are no more words to express my love and devotion to this place. Bring money.-No bookstore in the world can compare to this Portland treasure.  You'd be a fool not to love Powell's.And in honor of Graham F - the proud holder of the honorable Powell's First to Review:-Visiting this bookstore requires restraint, a very fat wallet, or a bankruptcy attorney.  There are more books here than you can shake a stick at, and the cafe ain't half bad either."},{"name":"Fox In The Snow Cafe","address":"210 Thurman Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Thrilled to have this coffee shop move into German village.

Apparently, she never visited this restaurant. If you were to walk into Taste of Brazil and ask that question, they would stare at you, mystified by your stupidity, and then point you to several dozen skewers of dripping, salty animal flesh rotating over a charcoal fire in the back. Here's a rundown of what I consumed:Beef ribs - They only had them well done. Not bad, but not cooked to my desired doneness. 6/10Top sirloin - Awesome. Got it medium rare, and it was fantastic. Not too salty, tender, and juicy. 8.5/10Chicken wrapped in bacon - Pretty good. A bit dry, but the bite-size morsels required no cutting, so I just shoveled them in. 7/10Chicken thighs - Thought the guy said \\"chicken ties,\\" so I was a little confused at first. This meat was satisfactory, but nothing outstanding. Good, basic piece of chicken. 7.5/10Chicken hearts - The second time I've eaten them. These were better than the ones at Brazilian Grill in Hyannis, but any organ meat is going to be gamey. I guess they were good for the heart of a chicken. Not too chewy, which was a plus. I ate three. 5/10Beef brisket - Half fat, half meat. I didn't mind it because I like some fat with my meat, but it's not for everyone. My friend didn't like it at all. I thought it was the most flavorful and  tender cut of beef. If you don't like fat, just have them cut it off before you pay. 8/10Kielbasa - Good, standard keielbasa. Very juicy, well seasoned. 7/10Grilled pineapple - Not a meat, but awesome. Crusty, carmelized outer surface with succulent pineapple meat underneath. I ate a lot of this. 9/10The sides here were pretty scant, but I enjoyed the bean selections and the beefy rice. The feijoada was too soupy for my liking, which disappointed me because I generally get really excited about this dish.  On the other hand, the fried plantains were decent. The fact that I don't remember any of the other sides shows that they were unremarkable.To drink, I ordered a coconut water. I was prepared for a can of Goya coconut water (which I love); however, when I saw the guy come out of the kitchen with a whole, unhusked coconut with a hole drilled in the top and a straw coming out of it, I was like, \\"What the frick?\\" It was delicious until I saw that it cost me over $8! They cut it open for me when I was done, so it was kind of like a dessert, but not really. I'm glad I had the experience, but would never order it again if I went back due to the price. 2.5 pounds of food at $5.99/lb. plus a whole coconut cost me $23. \\nNot a bad price for absolute gluttony."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Nice local restaurant with an interesting menu, fun appetizers and a good happy hour crowd.

Loved the small little area with the screen doors on the wall.  My fiance loves Southern food, his first job was at Popeye's (not real food, but still), his mom would make him jambalaya when he was younger, he has gone to New Orleans for Mardi Gras.  For me, I'm a picky eater.  We were trying to decide whether to go to Roscoe's or here and Yelp didn't say anything about hushpuppies at Roscoe's, so we decided to go to Screen Door.Drinks - I had the Porch Swing Lemonade - Amazing!!!  Then I had the Hurricane drink and I don't remember it much, because I am a lightweight, but I don't remember it being bad in any way.  Hushpuppies - My fiance told me I had to try them because they were just fried bread.  But I saw some odd things in it so instead of just popping one in my mouth, I decided to cut it in half.  There was some corn in them and for my fiance something green in his.  He got the attention of the waitress because he is allergic to peas and knows that corn and peas are usually together.  The green stuff was actually scallions.  I decided to not eat anymore, but I'm super picky, he ate his.  His dinner - He got the screen door plate with an appetizer instead of another side.  He got catfish, gumbo, and I believe mac and cheese.  He loved the catfish, and the other side.  As for the gumbo, he liked it but it was more dry than he is used to, he is used to more liquid.  My dinner - I got chicken strips, mashed potatoes, and french fries.  I LOVED the chicken strips, only problem was that they had a lot of pepper on them, and I am sensitive to pepper.  But they so yummy and juicy!  Mashed potatoes were good, I decided to use the butter for the cornbread in my mashed potatoes, turns out that is Honey Butter, so that was a little odd in mashed potatoes, but I ate it all!  Desert? - I believe I looked at the menu because I would have been interested in buying desert, but most had nuts in it (Fiance is allergic to nuts) and the rest didn't sound good to me at that point.  Service - It wasn't the best in my opinion.  We had some issues, wanting more tea, asking questions about food, wanting another drink, etc., and the waitress really didn't notice us.  I could see the bar clearly from where I sat.  I finally was able to order another drink and then I got to watch it sit at the bar, just sitting there.  I wanted that drink to help with the burn of the pepper on the chicken, so I was annoyed when it was finally there for so long that someone else, not our waitress, brought it over.  Will we return?

If I based it on what I purchased, The Mango slush, it'd easily be 4 stars.  The problem was when I tried a little of everyone else's drinks, and came away with mixed feelings.So let's get into it...the medium mango slush ($3.75) was REALLY good, not sugary sweet, and tasted like they'd simply took a lot of mango slices, ice and blended it together.  Perfect for me.  That's all I purchased, but I was allowed to try samples of the below.Chocoberry: tasted like melted chocolate ice cream.  Not bad!  I'd order this.Strawberry Lemonjade: kinda gross to me.  Slimy, weird flavors, not great.Red bean matcha: Not a great flavor as well, although I don't like red beans in my drinkablesNO light bulb glasses.

They have a special going on that if you buy $20 of their desserts, you can receive a bottle of mango sago for free. I got so excited when we pulled up. As we entered, it's very clean and has a modern interior with white walls all around with purple curtains and seats on the right side. The decor is simple. The place is spacious. It's enough for one huge group of people. As you come in, if you are dining in, you are greeted and seated with a menu. The menu is big and eye catching. Soooo many options. They serve you some water while you look through. I wanted everything because I LOVE mango. We ordered the mango sago with mango ice cream and rice balls, mango Mille crepe cake, mango mochi and green tea Mille crepe Togo. Mango mochi comes in 3 pieces for $5, Mille crepes are $6.50-$7 and the mango sago is about $6-$6.50. I loved all of them except for the mango Mille crepe cake. I think they tried to make the filling mango flavored but I feel like they could have done it with just the regular whipped cream. Wasn't a fan of that so I wouldn't recommend it. But the sago was nostalgic, reminded me of the desserts I had in NY. The green tea Mille crepe was great when I had it to go. It's a reasonably large piece too so it took me about 3 days to finish it. It's not as good as Lady M, but I'd get this over their mango Mille crepe. We ordered it again on our second visit and I think the crepes were a little over done. Consistency is key so I'll give them some slack since they're new.There's so many drinks too!

The last time I visited, which was several weeks ago, I swear I must have stood there for about a century while the girl taking my order had an entire conversation using my credit card to gesticulate with, while I had to endure the accusatory looks from everyone standing in the line behind me. JUST RUN THE CARD!Having visited both locations (Cambridge and Salem) it would appear that this is common problem. Perhaps I'm too Bostonian to appreciate the casual, laid-back atmosphere, but damn it, when I need kombucha, I need it, like, yesterday. Let's hire some time lords, Life Alive. Also, hiring fewer hippies means you have to pay fewer hippies. Pass the savings onto us!"},{"name":"LOCAL 02045","address":"2 A St","city":"Hull","stars":"3.5","text":"Extremely overflowing lobster rolls!! A must visit!

I have no clue what took me so long to motivate, but The Bud and I finally managed to get here, and we got the last table before the morning rush.  Score!Delicious, dare I say thick, French press coffee circulated around the place regularly.  As I approached the bottom of each cup, it was textured, like campfire coffee (The Bud's description, but honestly, what are the chances that he'll actually write a review).   I write this review somewhat coffee buzzed, some hours later.  They also serve yummy orange juice in little mason jars.  [Suppressing squeal.]  \\nMason jars!  Aw Hell, \\"Yay, mason jars!\\"I had the Sicilian Hash.  The beef was braised so low and so slow it practically dissolved on my tongue.  The cheesy scrambled eggs on top of the hash were incredibly light and fluffy, whipped full of air.  I don't know how they did that so completely and utterly perfectly.The Bud had the Biscuits and Gravy.  The sweet potato biscuits held their own with the rosemary sausage gravy.  Biscuits were tall with great texture and just the right touch of sweet.  The sausage gravy was incredible.  Plus they add thinly sliced pork loin in case the sausage somehow does not deliver enough of a meat punch for you.  Delicious!The atmosphere was positively Southeast, which makes sense given its location.  Nice use of re-purposed and re-homed items here: doors turned on their side to create a barrier half wall between the kitchen and the small dining area, shot glasses in which to serve delicious strawberry jam with the tiniest hint of (I believe) nutmeg, old dishes from the 1970's that I swear my parents owned at one point or another.  This place is full of charm.Service was terrific.  Prompt, friendly, frequent with the coffee refills.  That's really all that I need.  Arleta is now firmly in my breakfast line up since I know that I can get a table early enough in the morning."},{"name":"Caf√© Luna","address":"612 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"If you are planning on coming to Caf√© Luna on the weekend I highly recommend a making a reservation because this is a popular place.

I actually hated the atmosphere. The ONLY thing that seemed right was that the servers all seemed like hippies. Ha. All that being said, our server was great, she made helpful suggestions, and the food was delicious as usual. My friend who is gluten free ordered their gluten free crust and wanted pineapple on the pizza. The server couldn't guarantee the pineapple would be gluten free but my friend chanced it and we joked that they could just use pineapple from the bottom of the container. When the pizza came out, it was brought out by the manager who told her that they had opened a new can of pineapple just for her. It didn't need to happen AND they were busy so it was a super cool gesture. I love the WP location best in FL and the Asheville location overall. This location seems like a bit of a sell out and that makes me sad that the brand is diluting as they expand to more locations. So, that's the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5.

Otherwise... this is a one-star review for the manager in particular.My children took me to One Bistro yesterday for Fathers Day brunch.  Party of six, with a reservation for 11:15.  We stood right next to the hostess's podium, and yet she somehow forgot us until 11:22.  When she \\"noticed\\" six people blocking access, she brought us to a table, but could only find three menus.  Several minutes later, she returned with three more menus.  Of course by that time, we had already shared among ourselves.  Our excellent waitress, Arcely, took orders quickly.  And then... the long wait began!The open kitchen was apparently unprepared to provide things as simple as eggs Benedict, waffles, pancakes, in any kind of efficient way.  We watched four cooks bump into each other for quite a while.  At 12:25 pm, Jemo, who apparently is the manager, came to our table with the most insincere apology I've ever heard.  And when asked how much longer, he became somewhat beligerent.  When pressed, he mumbled \\"five or ten minutes,\\" and walked away.  A table nearby, who it appeared waited even longer, were told by this alleged manager, \\"Well, this isn't Denny's.\\"  No kidding.  Denny's would have had us fed and out the door in less than an hour!  We did get our food just short of the promised ten more minutes.  Good food, but not worth the wait!Overall, an unfortunate experience.  Perhaps if Jemo were more interested in managing, instead of spending all his time leaning over the open wall into the kitchen, apparently contributing nothing, things could have been different.  With the number of options in the area, we won't be heading back to One Bistro any time soon.\\nUpdate (10/20/2019):Just wanted to be sure to let the world know that four months later, Shamoula has done absolutely nothing about making anything better, beyond her hollow words posted here."},{"name":"Ceviche Tapas Bar & Restaurant","address":"125 W Church St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Amazing Place!

From the look of it though, this place would be the perfect after-movie date spot. The place has some light food fare--quesadillas, spinach salad, and white pizza to name a few. The food was actually very good--not exactly WOW but good at the price of 8-10$. I really liked the mixture of tastes and not too filling. These foods complimented the desserts well because while they were good and somewhat chic, they were not overly filling. As for the deserts: Since Finale is known for its desserts (I mean come ON-- they proudly boast them in the window which forever taunts me when I get off the Coolidge Corner T stop) I expected some knock down, drag out desserts. Don't get me wrong, they were very good. I tried some of the individual Dark Chocolate Cake and the Mousse Cake they had and it was very decadent, but the desert itself wasn't as incredible as I hoped. However, I bet those of you who prefer rich, powerful desserts would love it. So, my recommendation would be to go after dinner and share a pair of desserts with someone you'd like to stuff a few pounds on. Talk over wine and really intense chocolate. I'm sure that the experience would have been VERY different if I wasn't in sweats watching Degrassi on my bed which is only half a block away. \\nThese are the kinds of desserts YOU have to dress up for. They are individual black-tie event cakes and deserve to be eaten wearing in some cute number you couldn't possibly fit in after stuffing yourself with chocolate.

And they ain't even that great. Nor are they spicy. For those of you who aren't a fan of fish sauce, this dish will very well need to be skipped. It's also wayyyyy too salty.

I liked this way better than the wings, but thought it tasted a bit bland. And, most of the chicken in the soup was bone.

They offer a taco bar, hot pizza, sandwiches, SUSHI, olive bar and a salad bar which happens to have my new favorite soup in town: Thai curry among other tempting flavors. Not only are they the most fun grocery store in town with live music occasionally, games in the lounge area and yummy sample galore... they also have the freshest produce and affordable, healthy food.

Chances are you can find a used version of the book you're looking for (or the book you've found and now must buy) for the cheaper, used price.  They are generous on buying books as long as you haven't written in them.2. Sale Books: there are so many books featured on sale each time I go in that I can usually find 4 books for less than $20.  The Sale books are also usually books that I'd WANT to read, instead of just books that are overstocked and uninteresting.3. Displays: inventive displays and a system of featuring books helps me find unexpected books.4. Quantity: This location is HUGE and has every mainstream book, and every book on any esoteric topic that may interest you.

Ask the server for regular water and they'll get it for you.However, the water and lacking of regular Asian favorites fits the adventurous theme of this restaurant. The drink menu is huge, but there are many vinegar drinks. That might not sound appealing, but my friend got one of theme and seemed to enjoy it. I got a Vietnamese beer that wasn't all too bad. The main courses was when things started really getting good. I got a noddle soup with coconut milk, beef and some seasoning. It was a unique combination of sweet, savory, sour and spicy. Very different tastes with every bite. My soup, though, couldn't hold a candle to the chicken wings my friend got. These were awesome and maybe the best chicken wings anywhere. Big, full of meat, and coated in a sauce that is slightly tangy, slighty sweet but with a little kick at the end. We enjoyed our food. The place got very busy with a long wait, but we went slightly early and had no problem snagging a table.

I was treated poorly on more than one occasion because I somehow set off the alarm, including once when I had to threaten to call the police if they didn't return my belongings (after being bullied into giving them my bag, which I had literally just received from the bag check). When that happened I told them I would NEVER come back to their store EVER again, and I have kept that promise!I called their customer service number on multiple occasions to complain about this issue. The people who work at the call center are much friendlier than the in-store staff. I was told that the downtown location has a big problem with theft and the staff can be a little overzealous (bit of an understatement) and they did apologize for my poor experiences. Unfortunately this doesn't nearly make up for the amount of embarrassment and humiliation I endured when I had all my personal items pulled out and put on display while being lectured by a condescending clerk (again, this was right after I had taken my bag directly from the bag check to the door, ten feet away!!!) or the multitude of other times where I was stopped by staff while other customers were not stopped at the same time.And honestly, it's just a big bookstore.

I would HIGHLY recommend making a reservation on OpenTable. The girlfriend made a reservation almost 2 weeks in advance, and the only option open on a Friday was 9:30 PM. When we arrived, we were seated within 5 minutes in a packed restaurant with diners at every single table. The tables started to open up around 10 PM. The waiter came by to get our drink orders and provided complimentary bread. The butter that accompanies the bread is sweet and was delicious. However, the bread was ice cold, however I can overlook this as the rest of the meal was delicious. We started off with a dozen oysters, those were some of the best oysters I have had on the East Coast. They were extremely fresh and weren't too salty. For my entree, I opted for the lobster roll (comes with cole slaw and home made chips). Lobster is a must for Boston. The lobster itself was light on the mayo, thank god, truthfully speaking I was a bit hesitant to order this since most places love to mix the lobster in a lot of mayo. The buns were nice and buttered and most importantly they aren't cheap with the lobster. They pack in so much lobster that it's overflowing. Not only is it overflowing, but the lobster is also very fresh. The side of cole slaw was also very light and refreshing. I was very content with my meal here and I can definitely say this was the most memorable place I ate at during my trip in Boston. It also doesn't hurt that the ambiance is very nice. There are plenty of other seafood restaurants in Boston, I can't speak about the others but I definitely give this establishment a big thumbs up."},{"name":"WAVE Asian Bistro & Sushi","address":"301 N Baker St, Ste 106","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"4.5","text":"Hidden away in the upper portion of a building they offer food that is as delicious as it is instagramable.

Large windows along the left of the entrance offer interesting views and the staff are more than helpful when you have questions or need any suggestions. Only complaint would be the bathroom situation, but I don't think there is much to be done about that as I believe it's comunal for the building."},{"name":"Nori Nori","address":"6690 Roswell Rd, Ste 2110","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"Nori Nori is a Japanese sushi and seafood buffet. Their lunch buffet is $18.25/adult M-F, and $21.25/adult Sat-Sun. Dinner is $29.95 M-Th and $33.95 F-Sun. I arrived with a group of 20 for a birthday celebration on a Sunday around 12:30. Our group made a reservation prior to the day and the restaurant saved four tables put together in the back of the restaurant, closest to the dessert table. The staff was friendly and greeted us upon entering then directed us to our section. We only had one server through out the entire meal, but he was fast and efficient. He was also very patient and accommodating with our group and listened to our many requests (brought small plates for the cakes we brought, take pictures, etc).Now for the food. Nori Nori has a huge selection of sushi, Japanese salads, hot dishes, dessert, and even a crepe station. The size of the sushi is small but that seems reasonable for a sushi buffet. They put an emphasis on not wasting food. There was even a sign at our table stating that we would be charged for wasted food. The food looked and tasted fresh for the most part. I tried at least five different sushi rolls, at least five different salads, and a few hot dishes. I enjoyed all of them. I can't think of one that I really liked nor disliked. However, I was disappointed with their crepe station. It's cooked to order and you are given an option of strawberry, blueberry, banana, mango, chocolate syrup and whipped cream. I requested a strawberry and chocolate crepe. I thought this was going to be the highlight of my dining experience. I was so pumped. Instead, I received a (still) frozen strawberry in my crepe. I had to scrape the frozen strawberries out of my crepe and eat it with just the chocolate and whipped cream. What's odd to me is that they serve fresh fruit in their dessert bar. They could and should have taken the fresh strawberries from there and used that for the crepes. Crepes cook quickly, so my strawberries didn't get a chance to thaw. My SO experienced the same problem with his crepes. Fortunately, they had a green tea and vanilla ice cream maker that was able to satisfy my sweet tooth. Most of the party agreed that the vanilla ice cream tasted just like Chick-fil-A's. Great plus.Overall had a good experience. The restaurant was clean, including their bathrooms. They had ample parking. The staff was pleasant and attentive. I thought $21.25/adult was fair for the quality and quantity of the food.

It is every bit as good as, in terms of coffee taste and its refinement. Whereas Parker Street Cafe is a new kid on the block, Blue Bottle is a veteran. Attaining the level of success of Blue Bottle would require millions of readjustments and refinement. We came here after our meal after our annual SeaWheeze run. We felt we need a good cup of coffee before the long drive back to Coquitlam. Found this place by Yelp. I had wanted to verify if the joint is deserving of 4.5 stars.  To see if it is legit or gamed. Whether the goods live up to the billing. This review is based on their hot and iced Americanos. Both are super balanced; flavours are on the mild side; an everyday drinkability.  Price is at market price. Service is pleasant. Had a brief conversation with the owners. Gave some tips from our experience of successful eateries and cafes. Some I left out. Going forward, how successful you want to be; needs to be clearly defined. There should be a strong focus what this place is. Is it a cafe? Dessert place? A restaurant?  Yes, I know giants like Starbucks does it all -but does everything badly.  It is better to have a narrower focus and do everything exceptional at first to garner a good reputation. (Pastries on the counter are not excitingly appealing.). That way, there is less inventory to carry and less waste. Secondly how do you fare against the best coffee shops in the neighbourhood?  What are they doing you are not?  What are they offering you are not? What are your advantages over them?Lastly just keep up the good work...Work hard. Focus.

One downside is they don't take reservations, but there is a $8 self-park lot right next door so at least parking is easy. We had a medium-size group of about 6 people and we were told the wait would be a few minutes. We ended up waiting over 30 minutes for a table so don't go by their wait times if you are hungry (they give you a buzzer).They have plenty of seating and I love the outdoor seating which has heat lamps and fountains for a charming Austin atmosphere. Instead of complimentary chips or bread, they give you popcorn which is really fun. We started with their large pretzel sticks. These are like auntie wetzel's but with gourmet dip. So delicious-we got two orders! My husband ordered the crusted fish which was nice but the baby-back ribs were melt-in your mouth to die for.  I'm usually, not a big fan of heavy meat, but the waiter recommended the ribs and I loved them so much I had to share with my family.  The fried onions on top and the grits are also a nice touch. We eyed the giant piece of chocolate cake one of the tables next door had, and could not resist ordering a piece to share with the family. It was delicious and decadent. Service was also very cordial despite how busy they were and the waiter understood all the food he was serving when we asked questions.

I was so happy I finally got to, after visiting Portland so many times. The four of us ordered 3 orders ( 18 wings, $14 for half a dozen), and a papaya salad, with four servings of rice. The papaya salad was good, had really really good spice factor that creeps up on you. You can do without it though, unless you are really craving it. At $9 for the vegetarian one, the portion was a little small. The wings come with the option of mild or spicy. The spicy ones didn't have as much heat as we would have liked, so you might want to speak up to your waiter about adding more hot peppers or bringing a side of hot sauce of some sort. But besides that, I think these are the best wings I've ever had so far. They are fried to perfection ( except for one wing I got that was not cooked all the way....) and so juicy. They are marinated so well, with the flavors of fish sauce, sugar, garlic, and other aromas seeping into the meat. They are a little bit on the oily side, but with that's okay with me, especially when i can just use sticky rice to soak it up along with the flavors that are infused in it. The pickled daikon and carrots along with cucumber slices are also a nice garnish which you can eat to refresh your palate from the greasiness. Our wait was about 45 minutes to eat in this almost tent-like atmosphere, but it was well worth it. We all left with satisfied and happy tummies."},{"name":"Coquille Fine Seafood","address":"181 Carrall St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Coquille is a restaurant perfect for impressing your date.

The best part though, were the desserts. The banana cream pie and pumpkin spice cheesecake were to die for. The thing that stood out the most was to me was the crust to the banana cream pie - I've never had anything like it before.

I go to dinner to be with people I love and, eventually, to eat well. If that takes 3 hours, I kind of count it as a blessing because that means I get to be around my favorite people more.So yeah, the wait was a little more than 1.5 hours. After we (my out-of-town boyfriend and I) put our name down, we walked around downtown for probably 30 minutes  and then spent the rest of the wait on the lovely patio. Between us we had chicken fried chicken, green chile macaroni, mashed potatoes, one of their specialty martinis (which is really more like a delish grown-up strawberry slush), and some wine. My boyfriend, who I joke has the pallet of a 4 year old, loved his chicken fried chicken; but, in true toddler fashion, he said he didn't like my mac n cheese because there were too many textures goin' on. I, on the other hand, loved it all.My one major complaint: valet is pretty essential which I'm fine with. But it was $8. Cash only. So I had to use their ATM to get cash out. Which had a $4 fee. With a measly $2 tip, which I felt bad about because it was raining, that valet experience was FOURTEEN DOLLARS. What!!??

So when I found a restaurant not too far away, with decent ratings on both Yelp and Open Table, I was intrigued - and made a reservation. Upon walking up to the restaurant, which is nestled in a small shopping center near a tech park, you are greeted by a small parking lot and a beautiful water feature facade. The restaurant is certainly appealing to the eye, and inside there's more of the same. They have a beautiful bar and dining area, as well as several layers of huge decks overlooking a pond. They also have large floor to  ceiling windows with tables next to them, which is where we sat. It was cozy. The chairs were one of the only few drawbacks - they were very deep and somewhat uncomfortable. Our waiter was by shortly, and took our drink order, then came with drinks shortly thereafter and took our order. Unfortunately, they were out of the pistachio crusted halibut which was my first choice, but I opted for the pork chop with mashed sweet potatoes. My husband ordered the prime rib with the bacon mac and cheese. Everything was delightful! My pork chops were really good - juicy and flavorful with a glace that I thought was going to be really sweet - was actually sweet and salty and very good. The mashed sweet potatoes were the lightest, fluffiest ones I've ever had. My husband said that his prime rib and mac and cheese were also very good. Our waiter was very attentive, nice, and had a great sense of humor... this evening was going just right. The only other thing that was slightly annoying is that my husband was served his dinner on a plate that had two \\"feet\\" on the bottom, so every time he went to cut his prime rib, the plate clinked against the table and wobbled. He got  frustrated towards the end. And then... Irish Car Bomb Cake. I actually, (famously among friends) make these amazing little Irish Car Bomb cupcakes so I was very excited to try their cake. And it was good - not as good as my cupcakes but the Bailey's frosting was light and fluffy, and the Guinness cake was amazingly moist with great flavor. How better to top off a romantic evening and a nice place? I can't think of a better way. So, Zed's... I think it is safe to say that my husband and I will be back, and you could very well become a contender for a favorite restaurant of ours. Four stars for now, I'll be coming back, and probably giving you a fifth next time.

I realize it is a store, but I thought there would be a little more too it -- magestic windows, brass fixtures, high ceilings, vibrant paintings, famous quotes lining every wall, and even a couple of literary figures in statue form. Parts of the store felt like a thrift store, and your options to lounge are limited to the cafe. I have visited libraries that were more inviting. I wish there were more touristy options. Overall, it is a store and you just have to remember their intent is to sell. Even if you don't like books, or don't know how to read... just stop by! Who knows, in 10 years time places like this may become obsolete.---------------------SIDE NOTES\\n-- It is open daily from 9-11pm\\n-- Rare Book Room is only open from 11-7pm or by appointment.

So, Korea House was a great find!! It is a \\"full\\" Korean restaurant with a traditional menu such as japchae, bibimbap, galbi, bulgogi, soon dubu, korean bbq etc. They also serve 6 types of banchan along with entrees (it was a little weird that the banchan came out in the middle of the meal and not right at the beginning though).The pan-fried tofu appetizer (dubu buchim) was great! Per my family, the seafood pajeon was excellent and super fluffy. It was also huge! The japchae was pretty good- I feel like every restaurant makes it a little different. It was on the saucy side. But the appetizer portion (veggies only no meat) for $5.99 was really generous! For entrees- I got the dolsot bibimbap with tofu and no egg for a vegan version. Yummy! My family said the chicken bulgogi was really good. However the Kalbi was too tough- not sure if it was just overcooked, or if it so happens to have been a \\"bad\\" cut of meat. Either way, the waitress courteously changed the dish for us. Again, portions of entrees are huge! Entrees come with white rice. Overall, the service was great and food came out fast. I felt SUPER bad that my family sent back the Kalbi..... but they seemed willing to switch it out for us and I really was surprised and impressed they did that. So thank you! The restaurant on a Friday night at 7.30pm wasn't too crowded. I made a reservation but didn't need it. There were a good amount of vegetarian options- yay! Prices were reasonable- got 3 appetizers and 4 entrees for $82 (before tax). Overall, I enjoyed the Korean meal here.

Waters are always refilled, even after you've finished your food and are waiting on your check. They never rush you, and they'll check on you just enough to make sure you're satisfied with what you ordered (which you will be). The pho is PERFECT. I get the chicken pho or round steak, and add veggies. If you ever request to add veggies anywhere, you'd know it's usually 1-2 types of veggies they'll add (and not very much of them-not sure what pricing on vegetables is for pho places, but I've noticed most are kinda stingy with em). Not so with these guys-they added green onion, carrots, broccoli, maybe some celery, and a couple other veggies much to my delight (I like crunch in my soup).

There are MUCH better breakfast spots in town (Pine State Biscuits, Mother's Bistro, etc). And breakfast is important to me. My problems with the breakfast relate to my Southern persuasion:1. It should be said that nobody in the South actually eats fried chicken for breakfast- this is a total NW creation and spin on Southern food. My friend ordered the Sweet Potato Waffle and Fried Chicken. They were both pretty tasty, but 3 MASSIVE fried chicken breasts for breakfast is an insane portion (there were leftovers for days). Anyway, I just don't want anyone thinking this is usual Southern tradition or fare.2. The Cheese grits were AWFUL. I have never in my life not eaten my grits. Hell, I like instant grits, but these grits were atrocious. I was so dismayed that I got up early and waited in line for horrible grits, I think it overshadowed the rest of my meal. The waitress insisted they used Tillamook cheese, but I had just made cheese grit casserole for my derby party not long before, using Tillamook, and it was no where near that color or flavor. Anyway, she didn't offer to remove it from my bill but I insisted.However, since that time I have gone back for dinner and find it much more enjoyable. The dinner options are delicious and original, particularly the local organics menu. And the cocktails are delicious. My one negative for dinner is the service. The bar service can be a little slow (we had a 20 minute wait on a 2nd Mint Julep) and the food always comes out a bit staggered. Plates are brought 1 or 2 at a time so it seems one person is always waiting for 5 minutes while the rest of us eat. Regardless, the service is friendly and well intentioned so I will continue to frequent this place for dinner.

I guess it satisfies my Thai food cravings, but the service/food here is always inconsistent so there's that. The curries are the pretty typical fare. I've tried green and red - most recently I liked the sweeter touch in the red curry with lychee. However, they really skimped on the lychees. $18.95 for 2 lychees? Not cool. Also, their portion sizes seem to get smaller every time I go back. Their noodles are decent too. It's what you'd expect. The pad Thai doesn't have the nasty tinge of ketchup that so many Vancouver places are notorious for.

Now throw in friendly staff who check in periodically to ask how our evening is going and romantic ambience lighting that kicks in around 8--I'm pretty charmed with it all.First: Steamed Mussels -- Now, these are not your average steamed mussels in white wine sauce. They are in a slight-creamy, super-savory-and-delicious pistou sauce (pesto minus the pine nuts). Not at all overwhelming or overpowering, a perfect compliment to the mussels and perfect for mopping up with bread. So happy that we both ordered this for our appetizer.Second:Garganelli Pasta with Duck & Pork Bolognese -- I tried a few mouthfuls and this was super tasty in flavor but the pasta was a little too firm for my personal taste.Pan Seared Coalfish -- With a name like coalfish, I wasn't quite sure what to expect but it was oh so very tender. I wasn't entirely swept off my feet with the flavor--there was nothing wrong with it, it just wasn't that memorable or noteworthy--but the texture was delicate and really lovely.Third:Gianduja Palette -- This super smooth hazelnut-chocolate mousse cake tasted like Nutella-y goodness and had a thin layer of crunch at the base that sealed the deal--yum. I was sad when it ended.Apricot Clafoutis -- Crumbly, fluffy, and warm in all the best ways but unfortunately, I have a major taste aversion to ginger and I could taste ginger in this clafoutis. So, just a heads up if you don't like ginger, you should avoid this one!Overall, for $38, and an absurdly cold and windy walk down Boylston St, I'd say it was worth it for the ambience, staff, mussels, and the Nutella dessert with the fancy name."},{"name":"Blue Chip","address":"6133 University Boulevard","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Known as *the* place to grab coffee in the AMS Student Nest!

We flagged down (what felt like hours later of us staring at disappointment) another bartender who assured us this portion was for 3 (1oz of seafood per person).

However, while I watched about 15 people get served in front of me, I noticed that neither the meat cutters nor the food handlers were wearing any gloves. Rather, they transferred food from place to place with a piece of paper. While doing this, I noticed food handlers touch trash cans, touch their noses, scratch their heads, etc. I did not see anyone wash their hands. I spoke to the manager and asked why no one was wearing gloves. He seemed shocked that this question was being asked and defended the fact that his employees were using this means of handing out food. He also said no one has complained and that they receive high 90's with their food inspections. I will be reaching out to said health inspectors to lodge a complaint."},{"name":"Torchys Tacos","address":"166 Hargraves Dr, Ste J-100","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Bunch of morons don't know how to run a place better go to William cannon or other location"},{"name":"Bollywood Cafe","address":"135 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Lexington","stars":"3.5","text":"Everything was delicious.

It's your typical neighborhood pizza joint that has a variety of specialty pizzas which were approximately $15 for 14 inch pizzas and about $21 for 18 inch pizzas. There is little else on the menu aside from a few calzone options and lasagna.We ordered a 14 inch \\"The State House\\", which included hamburger, sausage, and pepperoni. Since we were the only people there, the guys behind the counter started working on our pizza immediately. It came out piping hot with a slight char on the crust. The crust was thin and chewy and the toppings were plentiful...two pluses for the pizza. But the cheese and sauce were scarce. For what it was, we thought that the pizza was expensive. Despite our being the only customers, service was not attentive and the woman at the cashier offered a lackluster welcome.I can see why this is a 3-star establishment but there are multiple other locations in and around Boston that may provide a better balanced pizza and better customer service."},{"name":"Santa Fe Burrito Grill","address":"415 Washington St","city":"Weymouth","stars":"4","text":"It was just ok.

My quesadilla from the specials menu was fine but a little dry and overpowered by onions.

Most tables are laden with food and bigger parties eat family style, with everything on a lazy susan in the middle. There is a tank of lobsters and crab in the back of the room, which is nice for freshness and to entertain kids. I like Din Ho because of the massive menu that is so different than what most people think of for a typical Chinese joint. They have the classics but also greatly expand upon that. The soups can come family style and it's the best hot and sour I've had. A warm kettle of tea can provide for the whole table. Keep it simple with a salted fish fried rice, sesame chicken or a noodle dish.  Get out there with a two lobster special, fried in a spicy sauce. Personally, I like the flat noodles with chicken. I give them 4 stars because they are so different than most Chinese in Austin an because the food is good. I almost gave them 3 stars because service can be down right bad.

I asked if they were being reserved and the host said no, which left me confused why I still had a wait. When I was seated, I ordered a glass of ros√© and asked for a while to look over the menu. It took about 15 minutes for my drink to arrive and for my waiter to come back to take my order. I ordered the chicken parm which was on special for the evening. When I received my dish, the chicken was so tough that it was inedible. However, my waiter didn't return to check in to see how my meal was, so I was unable to provide that feedback. When he did come back, most of my meal was on my plate and he quickly took it away after asking if i was done. Most waitstaff I've dined with notice if you didn't eat your meal and offer to correct it or take it off the check, but he didn't acknowledge that I had literally only eaten two bites of the chicken.

Just go for lunch, or very early or late to avoid the tourists. It all started a long time ago when it was featured on The Today Show with Katie Couric. It's known for its lobster fra diavolo, but I keep coming back for the squid ink pasta with grilled squid. The restaurant is the \\"calamari cafe\\" as the aging paint on the window tells us. It's one of those delicious dishes you may find copied elsewhere, but never replicated. The broiled fish is perfectly prepared. For the past 10 years I've come here, the quality has not varied, due in large part to its chef who has been there for almost the entire time the restaurant has been open.  Now you might find it odd that there is an Asian chef cooking your Italian food, but he has been with the restaurant 30+ years and has mastered the family's recipes. In fact I wonder if the restaurant would survive if he were to ever leave.The prices may be off putting, especially in this tiny restaurant that hasn't had a makeover for 20 years, serves wine in cheap plastic cups and its dinner courses on old pans, but focus on the flavors dancing on your palate and you won't mind the bill."},{"name":"MF Sushi Atlanta","address":"299 N Highland Ave NE, Ste K","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I have been here once with my wife.

We ordered the fish sauce wings- the wings were crunchy and well seasoned. The fish sauce taste is very concentrated on the wings and was a very interesting take on wings- I recommend trying it if you're a fan of wings!The wings came out to about 15.75 without tip for about 6 wings. The guy that took my order in the take out window was one of the NICEST people I have met, so happy and sweet- which added that extra star to this review.

I picked the Grande Lakes because of the pool and lazy river.  The hotel is beautiful and the pool was wonderful.  I knew about the $35.00 resort fee after booking the hotel.  I was told by the concierge staff the hotel had a shuttle that could pick us up at the airport.  When I called the concierge desk the day before our flight I was told the shuttle service is not very good and I would be better off taking a cab.  The cab ride is $50.00 from the airport to the hotel.  I didn't rent a car because I was told also by the concierge desk that they had buses that ran all day to and from Disney World.  We got to the hotel and the room was really nice.  The room was warm so we turned down the A/C and the room never got cool the entire stay.  I went to get ice and the ice machine was broken. I called the front desk and let them know.  The entire 4 day stay the ice machine was broken. I had to go to a different floor to get ice.  When we got ready to go to Disney World we were downstairs at 9a to catch the shuttle.  We were then told by the valet staff that we had to pre- book the shuttle at the concierge desk.  So we go the the concierge desk only to find out that the shuttle only goes to Disney World at 8a and 10:45a. I told her I called the hotel before I booked the room and was told that there was a shuttle running all day to and from Disney. I told the concierge desk that we needed to take a cab.  She said they have towne cars that can get us to Disney. I said yes we need to get one of the cars.  She told me to go outside and tell the valets.  We go outside and the valet said we are suppose to pay at the concierge desk.  He apologized for all the bad information they were giving us and the towne car driver said we could just pay him.  The hotel towne car to Disney World which was another $50.00.  I was so angry that the concierge desk told me a bunch of lies before I booked my room.. The hotel shuttle will only take  you to Disney World.  They do not drop you off at Epcot, Animal Kingdom, or the other Disney Park.  The next day we took the 10:45a shuttle.  It took us 2 hours to get to Animal Kingdom because the hotel shuttle only drops you off at Magic Kingdom.  I wish I would have known all of this because I would have just stayed at Disney Resort or rented a car sooner.  I finally ended up renting a car because the shuttle service to the airport was a joke and the shuttle to Disney World was horrible.  I ended up paying $150.00 on cabs and then had to rent a car.

San Tung still has the best asian chicken wings hands down, but this one was similar. The glaze and caramelization was simliar in the stickiness and garlicky flavors. However, this was more of a fish sauce salty, which was good. They gave a pretty good amount of chicken, but for 14 bucks, it still felt like we were undershot. The chicken was cooked perfectly: juicy, skin was crisp, and the sauce permeated it, but it did have a slight taste that was off to me, maybe old or reheated... I dont know. Boars Collar - They said it was spicy. it wasn't. It was good though. However, I've had comparable boars collar/pig neck at other thai restaurants for half the price (in SF, though they were off menu items). Boars collar/pork neck tends to be expensive everywhere, for whatever reason. It is a good meat though, and Pok Pok does a good job in execution. Cooked a nice medium, texturewise, it wasn't too stringy or tough, and the flavor was like a slightly more gamey pork. The sauce was a cilantro/pepper/fish sauce based one, similar to what I found at another Thai restaurant. It wasn't spicy at all... I felt that if it was spicy, it would have added a better element/flavor profile to it. Drinking Vinegar - The only \\"expensive\\" item on the menu that was well worth it (priced as a cocktail). Very unique, almost similar to the lucas flavors for mexican candies... The taste of the vinegar is light, and the acidity is mild. The pomegranate flavors were strong, very sweet, with slight tartness. Man, I would drink this over any hand crafted drink, it was so refreshing and delicious. The place was too expensive for Thai food. While the ambience is like a clean and authentic restaurant found in Thailand, seeing tilapia priced at 26 a fish, and wings and a small serving of boar collar for 30 was of putting. I'll admit that I am spoiled by cheap and great SE asian food, so thats probably why I felt it was overall OK."},{"name":"Knight Moves Cafe","address":"1402 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4.5","text":"I came here in a group of 8 people in the hopes of a board game night.

Two very different experiences... Night and day, literally. Event space by day, club by night. The Warren City Club is located right above Dark Horse. It has a separate entrance on the side of the building. Parking available across the street.On my first visit, I came with a group of 4. We found ourselves in the highlands one late Saturday night and wanted to go dancing. I remember it being very dark inside, but the place was lit. The dance floor was packed and the music was bumpin' (do people still say that?). The DJ played top 40s to now. They have a large patio which is nice for taking a break from the dance floor and getting some air. After wearing heels all night, I needed a place to rest my feet. Fortunately, The Warren has seating towards the back in addition to the tables and chairs on the patio. Best part, it was open to the public, not VIP only like most clubs. We didn't stay very long, but we all had a great time.Fast forward to a year later and I was a part of a bridal shower luncheon. It was kinda weird to see the space during the day, but was pleasantly surprised to see it very clean. I can't imagine what clubs look like in the morning after a night of partying. The Warren is a lot more spacious than I thought. I believe we had 30 or more guests at the shower. and everybody was more than comfortable. We had plenty of space for decors, gifts, games, etc. The shower was a plated luncheon. The MOH had picked out the menu ahead of time. The food came out fresh and delicious. The mimosas were flowing. As a guest, I thought the service was great. The staff was very friendly and accomodating.

The menu says it's \\"ground squid sauteed with garlic and olive oil\\" with the black squid ink pasta (that's in house homemade), and that's exactly what it is. SO GOOD. The entree portion is large enough for two, maybe even three people, to split (depends on what you're getting) for $24. If you wanted something smaller, you can get the appetizer portion for $14.95. (Looking at the menu on the website, the prices we got were definitely more expensive...maybe the website has the lunch prices listed). We also got the pan-seared tuna with a side pasta with marinara sauce to share, cooked rare ($25). It was quite good as well, though not as good as the pasta. It was more subtle, while the pasta with the garlic hit you immediately. Their marinara sauce was so good that the side pasta was elevated to a whole new level. The sauce with the tuna was interesting, tomato basil but citrusy as well, with mushrooms that were really good. And the calamari meatballs? Delicious. Only two large meatballs for $6, but they were rich and so good. Drenched in the house marinara sauce, they were the first calamari meatballs I've ever tasted, and would probably be the only ones I'd ever eat, because they're so good. The bread was nothing special, a little lackluster even- too soft and it came with packets of butter, not olive oil. It was also room temperature/cold instead of warm. But hey, there was a lot of it. And I would say save your appetite for the actual food instead and forego the bread entirely. The water comes in little plastic cups; again, nothing fancy.On to the atmosphere. It's definitely a little more \\"hole-in-the-wall\\" type, especially compared to some of the higher-end looking restaurants around it, but this one has a special menu that makes it stand out from all the rest (if the paragraph above didn't make that clear). Be sure to get there early, like right when it opens, or be prepared for a long wait. The space is quite small; only enough to seat about 20 people. We had to split a table with a party of 5, but that was totally fine. They have an open kitchen, which was amazing as we got to watch the chef work his magic, and we got to enjoy the delicious smells as well. It was a rainy and cold Sunday, and the cold little restaurant soon grew warm and cozy with the smell of garlic being saut√©ed.As for the service, it was a little brusque and rushed, as they seemed to be understaffed and there were so many patrons. But overall the server was nice, and took our orders, gave us water/bread, cleared our plates, and took our check really quickly.All in all, if you're looking for a good meal with seafood down in the North End, or just comfort food, head over to The Daily Catch. I'll definitely be back to try other things they have- that Monkfish Marsala looked really good. Considering it was seafood, the prices weren't actually too bad.

The bread is baked in house, and it was delicious, very fluffy and fresh. The first basket is free, every basket after that is an additional 2 dollars. I had the daily special of gnocchi, we also had the clam linguine which seems to be a popular dish. The chicken parmesan looked reaaalllyyyyy good. The gnocchi bolognese was decent, the sauce was delicious but the gnocchi itself wasn't super amazing. My husband enjoyed the clam linguine, and finished his entire plate. The only thing I noticed was that when he finished his plate, there was a bunch of \\"juice\\" left on the plate, that wasn't sauce... Not sure if it was just clam juice, but the other person who got this dish didn't have that problem. It was a little off putting. It's important to note that portion sizes are NOT family style. The food is rich, but it is basically a \\"one person\\" serving. The prices seemed a little excessive for the amount of food we got. Since we had a large group, there was an automatic gratuity, so for each couple the meal was about $60 or more including drinks. Still though, $15-20 a meal for that size isn't the most affordable. I personally think the \\"additional cost\\" for the bread seemed a little bit ridiculous, but maybe that's just because I feel like most places offer free bread. Our servers were kind and attentive, and we had no issues with service whatsoever.

The menu is still developing as they have been open only just a few weeks. Here are some highlights1. Everything is relatively cheap ranging fro $2 - $9, so I can see it as a popular place for lunch in the UCF area. \\n2.

Overall it was good and very homey tasting (like it was cooked at home by your Taiwanese mom or aunt). I also tried the simmering combination which was an appetizer with four different types of meat - though I did enjoy the egg, chitterling, and pig ear, I was not a big fan of the pig's blood rice cake - that's just me though maybe?I sampled some of my friend's salt and pepper chicken, thought it was okay but definitely needed to be more \\"crispy\\" .

We have a small Japanese community, and unlike the West coast, few Ausinites have lived or spent significant time in Japan.What we are left with is a group of Japanese and hyphenated Japanese restaurants that present a version of Japanese food that is adjusted to American tastes, but would be almost unrecognizable in its native Japan. Soto falls into exactly such a category. Having read about the Japanese \\"credentials\\" of the owners, on our recent visit we decided to order serious nigiri-sushi - what one could compare to the original in Japan. We had such high hopes ... finally Austin was getting an authentic sushi place ... if not like the ones we frequented in Tokyo, then at least like some of our favorite places in San Francisco.Boy, were we disappointed! Tiny pieces of rice, carrying even tinier bits of fish, at Tokyo prices. Contrary to what you sometimes hear around here, it is the rice that tells the quality of the sushi chef, and this rice was below par: the grains fell apart easily, reflecting poor technique, and betrayed a strange, overly sweet flavor well beyond the traditional balance of mirin (rice vinegar), sugar and salt that should be its basic ingredients.As for the bits of fish, it's not enough to say that you source it from a market in Japan, or that it's \\"fresh off the boat\\" (which is never the case). There is a reason why it can take 2 years for a fledgling Japanese sushi chef to master just the making of sushi rice, and then another 4-6 years for the rest of the craft. Nor is it only about how to slice the fish so that the fibers between muscle strands don't interfere with the texture and flavor on the customer's tongue (each species needs a different approach). There's also the selecting of the fish, knowing its anatomy (and seasonal physiology), its freezing - and especially its thawing - and a host of other things.Soto takes the approach of so many Japanese-American restaurants that try to hide their limitations of knowledge and skill by dressing up the sushi \\"product\\" with little red and green garnishes, many over-powering what should be a sublime but subtle taste, or creating pretty geometric shapes, or taking a page from Benihana and grilling it over a small flame. One is left wondering - heck, why not drop all pretension and just offer spicy tuna rolls and spider rolls and California rolls, all dripping with mayonnaise, instead?We ordered ≈çtoro - the tastiest flesh of the tuna, from the front of its belly. What arrived was obviously ch≈´toro - a deeper red, without the marbling (at an ≈çtoro price!).As anyone who has spent time on both sides of the Pacific already knows, Japanese-American sushi and Japanese sushi are as different as ... well, as the Italian food in Milano and Milwaukee. What many find hard to accept is Tokyo prices for Texas sushi.I read that the owner spent time working (? learning) in restaurants as different as Morimoto's in Philadelphia and Jae's Cafe in Boston. The fare at Soto seems to reflect an influence from Jae's Cafe. And those of us who are unfortunate enough to know how good sushi can be are left continuing to search for one - just one - quality sushi place in Austin. We'd even be happy to pay Tokyo prices for it! (about Jae's Cafe - those of us who have visited Boston know it as a now closed Korean-Japanese-sushi place that used to \\"place flyers on car windshields which would quickly perma-tattoo their print on the glass\\")."},{"name":"Chuy's","address":"8123 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"My daughter and I were on vacation and to this location yesterday because we wanted Tex Mex, and it was fairly close to Universal Studios.

Nonetheless they also have sushi on the Manu. \\nHere is a quickie:\\nFood: 2 out of 5 stars \\nService: 3.5 out of 5 stars\\nPrice: 3.5 out of 5 starsThe Food: \\nRe-stating what i said; so this place is call Hakata Ramen, which mean their strength is Ramen. Ironically I found that their weakness is Ramen... first what is the most essential thing about ramen? No it's not the noodle (noodle is still important) it is the soup! First off, their soup is like water, not thick at all. And the flavor isn't attractive at all! It doesn't taste like the soup thats been cooked for hours. Second their noodle isn't that chewy, it's a bit on the soft side. Maybe cook a bit less time. Third of all, their egg... how do I put it... mostly ramen egg is half cook half raw from the inside (egg yellow) however their egg is fully cook and have darkly on the side. It is the kind of egg I can cook at home. Finally their ingredient, I ordered a seafood ramen so I got shrimps, squid, scallops...etc. The seafood it-selves doesn't had any flavor. It's like they put in a boil water to cook it and throw in the raman... there are absolute no flavor in the seafood! \\nNow that's being said let's talk about some goods. \\nTheir ingredient isn't that bad. Their food presentation looks good! So if you judge the book by its cover you will think it's delicious. I didn't order their sushi put I personally think their sushi may be better than their Ramen despite the fact they call them self Hakata Ramen. The service:\\nThe service is average Asian style service, nothing to complain, nothing to praise; very straight forward.The price:\\nThe price is ok. Whatsoever, I do find their grill squid on a bit expensive side(around $8.75)\\nI think $5.75 would be reasonable. If the seafood ramen make it right, it is worth $13 something. But because it's not that tasty, I personally think it only worth under $10 for the some above the average ingredient.The Verdict \\nIn the end, I really want to like this place because their overall presentation are great! But they just lack the essentials, which is the ramen's soup! Maybe if they change the name to Hakata Sushi, people wouldn't have high expectation for their ramens. I would come back to This place again because I like it's presentation and vibe. Also to try their sushi and see if other raman taste the same. I am going to assume the soup taste the same but I am not going to judging the book by its cover.Enjoy the food in this winter cold holiday seasons, food adventurers!

We started with the complimentary salad, which was offered with either a mayo-based or peanut-based dressing. We chose the latter at it was crispy and fresh. Then we ordered \\"Fresh Rolls\\" (Garden Rolls) and had no problem substituting tofu for the  shrimp. The rolls and peanut dipping sauce were both delicious. The wrappers were soft and fresh, the tofu was perfectly cooked and the rice had a lovely sweetness. Next came a large bowl of Tom Kha, also with tofu. I tend to judge Thai restaurants on how they prepare this soup, much as Italian restaurants get judged on their marinara sauce. It was wonderful, with complex flavors and many vegetables to enjoy. Don't let the price of the soup scare you... It's enough for 4-5 servings (ask for extra bowls). For main dishes, I went with a simple Tofu Red Curry, my wife had the Massaman Curry with tofu and our son had the tofu Pad Thai. All of the dishes were delicious and the portion sizes were quite generous. There were far more veggies in the curries than other restaurants tend to serve and the medium spicy sauces were spot-on. I found myself drinking spoonfuls of the red curry sauce after I have eaten everything else! My wife enjoyed hers as much as I did, although she did mention that a few more potatoes in the Massaman Curry would have been nice. The service, as others have said was wonderful. In addition to being polite and responsive, the servers we encountered were also very knowledgeable about Thai cuisine. We listened as one server (not ours) spent 5-10 minutes explaining regional differences in food preparation to the customers seated behind us. Very informative. The decor is plain and simple, and might be a turnoff for some, but if you're looking for delicious food prepared with obvious care and served by pleasant and helpful servers, you'll want to give Mee Thai a try.

I'm still in a state of ecstasy after my first dinner at Baraka last night.So, it was Valentine's Day, and my honey and I didn't want to go the route of making fancy reservations, but then also didn't really feel like cooking. Since Baraka only takes reservations for groups of 4 or more, we knew we'd be battling it out for a table with all the other reservation-less couples, and figured we stood a decent chance.We waited all of 15 minutes, and all the while the hostess/ waitress was laughing, smiling, and joking with us and every other customer, passing the time quickly. We were then seated at a cozy table for two, behind a carved screen to give us a small amount of privacy from those still waiting for tables.The menu was exciting-- my boyfriend is vegan and I don't eat meat, and we were both thrilled with the North African menu options. I opted for the traditional vegetarian couscous entree, served in a hand carved wooden bowl and ladle. He chose a vegetarian special, packed with zucchini, eggplant, chickpeas, and thyme and served in a lidded ceramic bowl with basmati rice. Both were to die for, so we shared.We also shared a couple of appetizers-- first, the Bedenjal Mechoui, a dish of smoked eggplant, roasted red peppers, garlic and spices served cold with crunchy herbed flat bread. Then, the Zaatar Coca, a grilled bread topped with carmelized onions and a variety of exciting spices, like thyme, sage, and sesame seeds. We were both practically licking our plates all through dinner (I would have if there hadn't been so many people around).Best of all was the award-winning lemonade. It is made with rose petals and North African spices, and possibly some crack. Don't even think about skipping it!Just as notably outstanding as the food is the service. You're family here, more than the Olive Garden could ever boast. The waitress cracked jokes all through dinner, at one point telling a story of a woman snatching a dress out of her hands at Filene's Basement (we've all been through this). And she hugged me good bye after the meal, insisting that we return soon. I didn't have to lie to promise I would.Not bad for an inexpensive, romantic Valentine's Day dinner without reservations. I'll be back for more food, lemonade, and hugs very soon."},{"name":"Bombay Grill","address":"2165 Savoy Dr","city":"Chamblee","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here for a company lunch.

Tandoori chicken will bring the tears not only due to the yummy factor, but cuz it is most definitely spicy. Chicken biryani was on point.

In my opinion, the quality and portions are not deserving of the menu prices.  Pastini puts out a better product and their prices are more reasonable.  Even Olive Garden is better tasting food for the value.I bought 4 entrees, which totalled about $70The tiny portion of lasagna priced at $15-16 was sadly overcooked (scorched cheese), the taste did not even stand up to a Stouffers frozen.  It was half the size I expected.. 3 layers of noodles., 3.5 inches by 5inches , nothing to write home about between the sheets.. the bechemel was completely lost. A real disappointment.The Bolognese pasta was just OK...i have had better Bolognese off one of the food carts downtown.The linguini with the clam sauce (Amys favorite) was OK...probably the best out of the four.. but its pretty hard to screw up plain noodles in a wine sauce with clams.The \\"Ginos Favorite\\" was also just OK.. again, nothing fancy, not worth $15+I am really disappointed in the portion sizes, they all seemed like a lunch size portion at a $$ price point.. you need to either bring your prices down a bit or increase your portion size.. and the lasagna was awful.. I was really excited to try this place after reading the Yelp reviews and seeing pictures of the food.

We got there around 11:15 and waited a little over two hrs in line. The restaurant sit about 20-25 ppl inside so you're just waiting for people to finish eating. We ordered the agilo squid ink pasta and a 1/2 scallop 1/2 little neck clam linguine with white wine sauce. We added some amount of salt to the squid ink pasta (1-2 teaspoon) because it was a bit bland and doughy. Afterwards, it was a lot more enjoyable. I really liked the chopped up saut√©ed squid it came with. (3.5/5).The scallop/little neck clam linguine was fantastic! The sauce had great flavor, garlicky and a hint of wine and i think olive oil. They also gave a generous portion of fresh scallops and clams. (5/5)Now would I wait 2 hrs for the food again? No, But would I come back? Most definitely! I recommend coming around 10:30am if you can or at an off time like 3pm so you don't have to wait in that long of a line. They definitely have a great selection of seafood, but that line outside is killer.

Even the crab in the California roll had mayo in it (though mercifully only had sesame seeds for a garnish). The tuna nigiri was inoffensive, but the tuna sashimi my husband had was \\"bland and tasted like saltwater.\\" The seaweed salad consisted of what looked like seaweed atop a bed of pasta, which we didn't sample.

Since we really liked \\"The David\\" when we tried it back then, we decided to get one of those, and also went with \\"The Spicy Mother Clucker\\" as our second type. Both of them had fresh ingredients and were super flavorful, but I actually preferred \\"The David\\", because the combination of italian sausage, roasted mushrooms, mozzarella and ricotta cheese along with a basalmic glaze was nice and warm, and just more interesting. Once again though, \\"The Spicy Mother Clucker\\" still tasted pretty good with its roasted chicken, mozzarella, pickled red onion, sriracha, spicy aioli and scallions and well worth getting. The crust on their pizzas are thin and crispy, and unlike Yelpers who have stated that the place skimps on toppings, our two pies had plenty of ingredients. The next time we visit, I'd like to try \\"The \\"Luau\\", which has pulled pork, fresh pineapple, mozzarella, a barbecue drizzle, and scallions. Mark is not that into pineapple on his pizza, so he wants to get the \\"Muffled Trushroom\\" or \\"The Dougie\\" instead. Personally, \\"The Dougie\\", which has roasted potato, smoked bacon, mozzarella, scallions, and a ranch drizzle sounds pretty darn yummy to me! Since we paid nothing for our half pies, thanks to those coupons, we didn't want to seem cheap, so we ended up splurging, and got two fountain sodas for $2 each... Surprisingly, they were not the usual kind of flavors. The brand is called Stubborn, and includes interesting flavors, such as citrus orange hibiscus, pineapple cream, and lemon berry acai. Generally, I don't drink soda because they tend to be overly sweet, but this type was light and refreshing. Definitely take a chance, and stop by Oath for some tasty pizza, unique drinks, and a pleasant atmosphere for dining."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great place to meet up with friends and catch up.

Our favorite was salmon on a fire and tuna belly scrap with 4 different dips. Unfortunately, I had to deduct one star because of the omakase experience. One of the key omakase experience is to interact with chefs and learn about the food. Here, a server drops foods or chef drops foods with minimal interaction. You might be better off ordering 18 different sushi off the menu and pay less. I would just go for food or go somewhere else for omakase.

It has a nice touch of French fusion which really makes the food stand out. Anything here is good and always a unique experience of rich and savory flavors.  I personally love the short rib plate. The sweet and salty marinade is one of the bests I have ever tasted. I would definitely recommend the flat rice vermicelli for first timers. You get a whole vegetable plate with carrots, failing, cucumber, Mint, cilantro, Thai basil, and lettuce. The mint is a really nice refreshing touch the the entree. For the entree you get a play of flat rice noodles and your choice of meat on top. I personally love pork because it's so juicy and hearty here. It's topped off with crispy onions and peanuts for a nice crunch. For the most unique part of this entree though, you get a bowl of hot water and rice papers and you get to me you own rolls, similar to spring rolls but much more rich in flavors!

Since we already had an early dinner, we were just looking for some small bites. The waitress knew the menu very well. She recommended us the Toro Osaka Style Box Roll. And the Lychee Martini as a drink. The Lychee Martini was sweet and delicious, but you could definitely taste the alcohol in it well. If you like drinks to mostly mask the taste of alcohol, then maybe try something else. But I thought it was beautiful with 2 lychees in it and it was so good! The toro box roll was INCREDIBLE. Hands down one of the best toros that I have had. I am still thinking about it. It had great, rich flavor, and the most wonderful buttery texture. My boyfriend isn't much of a fan of raw fish and he even liked it. We also got the Baked Scallops appetizer and I liked it as well. Scallops had a good texture but this dish is heavier as there is a lot of Japanese mayo! Overall, drinks, food, service, interior was all pretty good. I will do an updated review once I try more items here. But if you are a fan of Japanese cuisine, I would say you must try this place out. Only downsides: It's quite a bit pricey, but I think it's a worthy treat.

I have been a regular since I migrated east years ago, and it has become a spot that my friends and I frequent. The portions are unfailingly ample and the service is (almost always) stellar. I've tried about half the things on the menu by this point, and my friends and I can vouch for all of them - the black bean catfish, catfish pad ped, any variety of pho, com ga and com suon, pad thai, pad see you, drunken noodle, bo luc lac, the fruit smoothies, etc. They are all delicious and filling.But, it falls short of five stars for one main reason - the wait times. Now, hear me out. With a restaurant as good as Pho Basil in the neighborhood, people are almost always crowding the door at rush hour, waiting for a table. That line usually extends outside, and when we've walked around, waiting for our names to be called, it's clear that there's nowhere else people would rather be - the neighboring restaurants are never this packed. It's also the reason why they don't take reservations.Lately, my friends and I have noticed more and more customers erring on the older side staying well past their meals are finished while more and more people crowd at the door, and not everyone knows to go inside to put their name down. I think it would be a lot easier if the restaurant put a sign up telling people to do so, or maybe installing a texting system to let people know to come back instead of waiting in the winter cold or summer heat for over an hour. Maybe people would leave quicker if they imposed a 45-minute dining limit, similar to what Spring Shabu Shabu does.All in all, it's a great place to be, especially if you can make it before rush hour hits. Once it does, you're better off ordering delivery/pick-up and eating at home.

The lobster bisque was horrid (broken, gritty texture and burnt aftertaste), but they unquestioningly replaced it with a decent butternut squash soup. The dry aged porterhouse for 2 was perfectly cooked and goes in the top 3 steaks we've had. The scalloped sweet potatoes were the standout of the side dishes we tried. The jalapeno creamed corn would probably be far better in the summer, when corn is in season. I hope they don't use as much cream in it then and let the flavor of the corn come through more. The creamed spinach was acceptable, but nothing I'd order again. We split sticky toffee pudding for dessert, which was fine, but the vanilla ice cream that accompanied it was amazing.Service:\\nOur server was affable and made some good recommendations. However, our drinks were often empty, which shouldn't happen in a restaurant of this caliber. She handled the bisque issue professionally, and then we overheard her gently warning other people against the soup (so why serve it at all?).It was great to see Kevin Rathbun himself there, overseeing the expedition of plates. Though I assume he didn't try the bisque before it was served!Overall, I'd probably give it a 4.5 if that were an option, but it was more of a 5 star experience than a 4 star. The food and atmosphere made it significantly superior to Bones and Chops, though the service could use some of their polish.And I agree with some other reviewers that the $2 parking fee (with TIP NOT INCLUDED clearly marked on the sign) is odd given the neighborhood and location of the parking lot."},{"name":"Morton's The Steakhouse","address":"213 SW Clay St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I went here last weekend with a group of friends for dinner. We were served by Kevin who was very friendly and communicative. I ordered the ribeye (54$) with truffle butter on side (6$ option) my fianc√©e got the filet mignonette 6oz cut with two large shrimp and large  bacon wrapped scallops on the side ($59). We also ordered a few sides to share with our group too ($13 each) such as the truffle thin fries, saut√©ed Brussel sprouts, and mushrooms with spinach. I had a glass of their Cabernet Sauvignon 13$ from their drink menu and my fianc√©e got their mojito $15. \\nWe were brought bread which I've heard amazing things about, it was well seasoned on the outside and crispy. While the inside was very soft. Well done Morton's this is some amazing bread.Next comes the drinks which take about 10 minutes to come, the Cabernet is like any standard fare, just ok and i usually like to drink red wine when I'm eating steak. The mojito I had a chance to try to see how it is and it was not one of the best I've ever had. Not strong, very watered down and maybe like 2 small pieces of muddled mint, disappointing considering we were paying 15$ for it and I'm a mojito fiend. The sides come out next with the main course and everyone promptly got their plates later this was about 10-15 min after we got our drinks, I ordered my ribeye medium and upon cutting it, it was exactly how I ordered. The truffle butter is definitely recommended to enhance the rich fatty cut of ribeye, very good earthy flavors and just tingles all the right sensors on your tongue! The fries were good and I would recommend it especially for sharing, the Brussel sprouts were not good 3/5 in my opinion. And last the mushrooms with spinach were tasty.\\nMy fianc√©e and 2 other friends ordered medium for their cut of filet mignon but sadly it was very done when they cut into it, very brown and very very little pink left it was borderline medium well/well done. I mean folks when you spend over 50$ on a cut of steak at a steakhouse you wanna get it served how you order it. The scallops and shrimp were really goodWe explained to our server when he checked in with us, they were more than happy to take the cut away to make it right and get us a new piece done. Management was also very attentive and stopped by after he heard about this. And wanted to make it right with us. Our dessert was on the house and I really appreciate the customer service.

The Fish Sauce Wings were my favorite; crispy, sweet and spicy.. my mouth is watering just thinking about them! I think this dish is what made them famous, and rightfully so! Our other items were decent, but nothing compared to the wings. The half chicken was pretty bland without the tamarind or sweet and spicy sauce. The Khao Soi was yummy, but it was a pretty small portion so I poured some curry soup over the rice that came with the chicken --- soooo good! I'd come back again, but I'll skip the half chicken.

I was REALLY happy about that.  Note: when I was leaving at 7PM, there was no parking in the direct area, but if you were willing to walk a simple block over the baby bridge there was more parking over there.

So, I went out on a limb and tried the Cucumber Cosmo Martini.  Delish!  I also like the fact that they put all the ingredients in their drinks on the menu so it's not a crap shoot to figure out if it's going to be a squashed cucumber sitting in vodka or what.  Needless to say, it's not.  OH, for you Lone Star Beer drinkers - $2 during happy hour!They also had half-priced appetizers.  We got the Spinach artichoke dip.  It had wonderful mozzarella melted on top.  It was served with MASSIVE pieces of garlic bread for dipping.  I was interested in the calamari, but my friend was not digging it, so I will have to try it on the next visit.  We ordered house salads next - AverageOur waiter then brought us complementary cornbread muffins and butter - very nice.We ordered the famous Macaroni and Cheese.  I was not that impressed.

With what I've listed, one might think there was no way we could be full, but we were.  We didn't even eat everything.

It's a hip environment benefiting from a popular location and the name of KR. You'll feel the vibrant and youthful energy immediately. A good first impression as your walking in, for sure! However, don't make the mistake of thinking that this is a fine dining restaurant. This is a stylish place to show your instagram followers you went to eat. The dress code is very casual, not dressy casual (not exactly sure what that means) like we were told on the phone when making reservations. Tshirts, shorts, and sneakers were everywhere. Even if they're Gucci, they're still sneakers. The service was awful. They were very busy, and maybe they were understaffed, but we were completely appalled by the underwhelming attention that was given to us. Perhaps it was just our server. It took forever for a server to even get to our table for the first cup of water. Then we finally get our drinks, only to be ignored until our meal started to come out. We would've ordered 2 drinks each before we actually started to eat, but we couldn't because our server did not come to our table until our food came out. It was very obvious that we were not top priority for our server. Oh, and the wine glasses were dirty. Very dirty. $14 for a glass of wine presented in a dirty glass, ugh. My husband said his ribeye was perfect, but his lobster was a little undercooked. The spinach side was delicious, but the broccoli was overcooked, mushy. My scallops were cooked nicely, but they were awfully salty. My filet was also perfectly cooked, but also very salty. I have a question about my filet though. I've never had a filet with gristle... it must've been such a special cut of filet that my knife had to be extra sharp.... disappointing. I've never had to wrestle with my filet on the plate before. The presentation of the food is also very underwhelming. The filet and scallops almost slid off our extremely hot plates since they were over a bed of its own juices. It wasn't very pretty. Did I mention there was a good sized fruit fly that wanted to hang out near our food too? Ew. All in all, a very disappointing experience. Have we come to a place in society where we just pay excessive amounts of money for mediocre experiences, just to say we've been there and done that? The restaurant industry is a service industry.

Came here for a work dinner with 2 coworkers. Ordered the following myself: Calamari appetizer ($16), Warm buttered lobster roll ($34).The calamari appetizer was this fairly small pile of fried calamari, but the coating/batter wasn't crispy at all.  The calamari was cooked to a mush.  Comes with no dipping sauce, but rather some sort of aioli on top of it and the accompanying greens.  For $16, this I would say was way sub-par.  In hindsight, we should have sent this back - it was pathetic to be honest.  The lobster roll was a good size with a lot of lobster itself on top of buttered bread, folded in half.  I went with the warmed butter because of the weather, but was rather disappointed in terms of the flavor.  Something was missing. I added some of their small batch hot sauce to it later and that improved it by a lot.  It came with cole slaw and home-made chips that were pretty darn good, but overall, this $34 entree just didn't cut it for me.  I know that in this kind of \\"sandwich\\", the lobster flavor should stand alone and just be highlighted, but the lobster tasted no different than the stuff we get on the west coast, for about $8 cheaper and it honestly left your mouth just feeling dry.

Pok Pok is an \\"okay\\" restaurant with decent service and mediocre to decent food, but it is not worth standing in line for and definitely not worth the prices they charge.

Do I judge them against other restaurants in the area as an equal? Or do I think that would be an apples to oranges comparison, since the meals served here are essentially practice for the Culinary Institute's students?Based on the earnestness of the students, the goal of the program and the price of the meal, I'm feeling generous. Restaurants strive for consistency in service, but here you are going to get more variation than usual. So for every diner having a fantastic meal, there are likely going to be those that fall below the line. The experience is basically on par with visiting a new restaurant during their soft opening when they train their staff and work out the kinks. Only here, that is the norm with a rotating batch of chefs in training.It was clear from the beginning, that this isn't your average dining experience in Portland. There is one lunch seating at 12:00p and reservations are recommended. You are eagerly greeted by a student who shows you to your table and pours you water from a decanter. So they are learning front of house service too.Lunch is a three-course meal for $9 and you have a few options to choose from as your Starter, Entree and Dessert. What a sweet deal! Dinner is served Monday-Friday at 7pm. It is a four-course prix-fixe meal for $18.I selected the Pan Roasted Prosciutto Wrapped Fig, Brick Oven Pizza with caramelized onion, roasted apple, pancetta and sage with gorgonzola cheese and the OCI Chocolate Dream Torte from the Late Summer Lunch Menu. Each dish was good, without every being great. The wrapped fig in particular was a bit of a disappointment. But, they were all trying so hard, I just wish I enjoyed my meal a bit more.It is an open kitchen, so you hear the students receiving instruction and it is all quite interesting. There were no Gordon Ramsay-style histrionics that day. But, there were many apologies in the form of, \\"Sorry for the delay\\" or \\"Your starter will be served after/or at the same time as your Entree\\", etc. My bill was incorrect, but fixed with a smile. Again, this is all practice for the students.So, I think it is a good experience, as long as you approach it with an open mind and have a little bit of time. Since there are multiple courses and the time line is a bit fuzzy, based on how service is going that particular day, it isn't a good choice for a quick meal.I would definitely go back again, but unfortunately lunch is practically impossible since taking that amount of time during the week isn't usually an option. The restaurant is also closed on the weekend. The other thing to note is that the parking situation isn't ideal. Goose Hollow can sometimes seem like the Bermuda Triangle to me and the restaurant is surrounded by 1-hour parking. You need to venture a few blocks away to find a 2-hour zone. Also, if you visit for lunch, it is next door to Lincoln High School, so you'll get to see a flood of teens on the streets heading to Subway and Starbucks.

I hear that the lines get pretty long during lunch time rush hour so maybe the best bet is to go around 2:30 - 4ish and you will be able to be seated right away!"},{"name":"Din Ho Chinese BBQ","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 116","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Amazing food.

So glad I came and gave it a shot. The atmosphere was great, our server Dexter was awesome, and the food, was so good. I must admit I didn't go full vegan I did have the turkey burger for dinner, but many other items on the menu stood out to me as well.....that did lean to the vegetarian/vegan side of things. As appetizers we got the Edamame dumplings, which I enjoyed. And the turkey burger was so delicious (albeit slightly messy). The burger was juicy and not dry like many other turkey burgers tend to be, and it had this amazing jalapeno remoulade on it, with avocado, and I had a side of sweet potato fries, delish!!! We also both got the apple gold rush to drink and it was nice and smooth if you're a bourbon drinker! I will be back, this place won't turn me Vegan, but it will help me....eat more veggies!!!

I requested a container to take the balance of my lunch home. First he went to the order window and acted like I was requesting the balance of my order to go, but he should have known that I had my entire order in front of me. When he came back I restated my request for a to go container. He brought me a lidded container. He did not offer to do the transfer of food to the container. I ended up with soup and even a piece of meat on the countertop. He saw me cleaning it up, but did not offer a wet rag or additional napkins. He brought my check and a pad to pay on, AND THIS IS THE REASON I WILL NOT GO BACK - the choices for tips started at 18%, not 15%! For 18% I want exceptional service, not what was offered by this young man. I also cannot understand a restaurant being so cheap that they do not offer something for a liquid container to go inside. I drove home holding onto this container as I drove, because I did not feel it was secure and would not spill into my car!"},{"name":"Kizuki Ramen & Izakaya","address":"11830 NW Cedar Falls Dr, Ste 128","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Bad, just bad service! Blame this on management. I've seen this go downhill since the start. Overconfidence in the lines they see at the door makes management feel they can push diners to move faster. If I wanted fast food or to go, I would have gone elsewhere. Don't bother here. Crowds will dwindle and are as others realize it is not worth it and as other and much better places open. This place will be begging for customers. You are far better off for your dining experience and for outstanding food by going across the parking lot to either L√Å Sen or Blu Olive. Two fantastic choices with far friendlier and unrushed staff."},{"name":"Austin Tea Xchange Cafe","address":"13011 Shops Pkwy, Ste 600","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"Austin Tea Xchange still ranks 5 stars in my book!

If we do go back, it will be during the week when it is practically empty and sit at the bar. Also, while the food is good, it is overrated and the prices are too high for what they have.

My main gripe is all those people.  Powell's has a reputation and it is a destination.  Lots of tourists flock here, so weekends it is a madhouse.  Heck, its super crowded most days.  There aren't too many places to perch while you leaf through a book you don't intend to buy, and the layout of the store makes it kind of impossible to just lean in the corner.  I'm a fan of real books that you hold and I like to turn pages and I love paper and spines and I dig new book smell, so I am thrilled that Powell's exists and does a thriving business.  I'm also a fan of being in the bookstore and holding a book for a while as I read the jacket and contemplate taking it home.  But the multitudes moving up the stairs and through the place like spawning salmon just make me want to be anywhere else.  I can't get into the book and allow my mind wander with the possible places this book will take me, while I am surrounded on all sides.  Here is something 5 star about Powell's that you might not know; something that if you take advantage of it might sate your desire to support this business.  Take a look at Indiespensible - Powell's subscription book club.  \\"Signed first editions. Inventive, original sets. Exclusive printings.... Every six to eight weeks, another installment to read and admire. Plus, every package is stocked with exciting surprises!\\"  I was a member when I lived in another state, and I'm a member still even though I live less than 5 miles away.  I really look forward to the book they pick out for me, haven't had a miss yet.  And the little gifts are usually food and usually nom-nom-nom delicious and inventive.  I loved the chocolate on a stick that stirred into milk made hot chocolate.  And it was through this club that I was introduced to siracha cheese puffs - incredible.  So yeah, 5 stars for that.  I'm still going to go down there.  I'm going to fight the crowds for signings and I'm going to shark around in there for gifts as needed, but to just hang out and dream and wander and browse?  Nope."},{"name":"Shigezo Izakaya","address":"910 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Not the best Japanese cuisine place *shrugs*My snotty level is turned up a few notches when it comes to Japanese food, so bear with me (sorry not sorry).I had thought I've been to Shigezo before when I patronized the establishment yesterday but after glancing around at the interior I realized I lost my Shigezo V-card just last night!Some things we tried:\\n- Skewers = tried the pork cheek and one of the mushroom ones; it was alright, but nothing special;\\n- Squid Legs = not bad; liked the fact that it was not too chewy and instead somewhat charred (comes with this mayonnaise dip);\\n- Kirin Beer = I don't think you can fuck this one up;\\n- Sashimi = tried 3 types (I want to say salmon, maguro, and hamachi?); didn't really taste fresh unfortunately.Shigezo has ramen but I heard it's not that great.Though it was happy hour when I went (and the happy hour menu seemed extensively), I didn't think it was THAT much cheaper.Servers were nice and interior feels chill (also an outlet nearby so I could charge the keitai), but left the place with an unsatisfied taste in my mouth."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Giving this place 5 stars for the Sunday brunch alone.

Was seated right away by the hostest. Waiter comes over to wait on us. And I kind of got the vibe that us being there was a bother to him, just by his expressions. So, he takes our order. We ordered a Pu Pu Platter, an order of pork fried rice, Peking Ravioli, and beef with broccoli. I really wanted Lobster Sauce instead of beef and broccoli, but they don't serve it. Which what kind of a Chinese restaurant doesn't serve Lobster Sauce??? That's Strike 1. So, whatever, we ordered the beef and broccoli instead. He jots it all down and then proceeds to tell us \\"That's a lot of food.\\" Yeah, no kidding! The point is to have some leftover so my husband can have some for dinner that night. Him saying that to me was a bit unnecessary. So, that was strike 2. So, the food comes. The pork and chicken were dry as hell and everything else on that Pu Pu and the rice were just meh.(Strike 3!) I definitely had better service and better food at other places for half the price they charge here.The only positives were that the Peking Raviolis and the beef with broccoli were pretty good. But, even then, it's not enough to make me want to go back any time soon.Overall, just not a very pleasant experience."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Alright so there were a few places that were hyped up and I was thinking yeah let's go there because most of everyone has been right on point. We had a feeling there wouldn't be a wait. Upon arrival we see a podium, so we stood there, a girl came up and said hello. She proceeded to seat us inside a small room in the back, it was hot, hot hot and stuffy. Ewwww. I did not like it. So once we sat and I could already feel how uncomfortable I was getting. We got out and ask for a table outside instead. There was at least a small breeze, it was better than no air. I guess they haven't turned on the AC yet in that room. So we sat outside instead. We were given waters and peanuts. I was super excited to be here since everyone mentioned how good everything was according to yelp. We ordered their famous Vietnamese Chicken Wings and at $15 for 5 or 6 wings. I was super upset and disappointed. It was the saltiest chicken wings I have ever had. We had to ask for sauce to try to dip it in hot sauce but the saltiness was super bad, even the insides were salty. I'm not sure how long they marinade it but it was really inedible. We end up getting a beer to wash the saltiness down. We didn't want to waste food so it took us 1 hour to eat 5 wings. So you're probably thinking maybe because we had alot of food? Actually not at all.We ordered one another dish and it's called Cha Ca \\"La Vong\\" and that was flavorless. Oddly with the tumeric and other things in it, it was super bland. The fried catfish barely had flavor, the entire dish was grossly oily. I really like the mint idea because it was refreshing, but the hot catfish didn't really go well with it. The oils made me not want to eat the vermicelli as well.   Oh did I tell you this small dish that is barely the size of my face cost us $15.50? Oh and how we got 3 pieces of fish? I was sitting there thinking I'm just so glad I have a beer....So what do you do with Salty wings and bland Fish noodles? You might have guessed it. I slowly shred the chicken wings and add it to the vermicelli, it at least helped with the chicken saltiness. When the meal was over, I was glad it was. The meal was very disappointing. Last day in Portland and this is the last impression. So sad. I can't believe I spend this much money on something so hyped. Yes taste is subjective but if my bestfriend who loves salt couldn't handle it herself then it's bad. So sorry Pok Pok, but our experience was not great at all. Expensive meal for such small portions.
