However, after a convincing promotional video by Dailyhive, I decided to finally bite the bullet and stand in line for the Jam Cafe. I ordered a Charlie Bowl and the Nutella Banana French Toast. Both were large and very filling. The Nutella Toast was out of this world- insane! Although it was sweet, the whipped cream was not overly sweetened and balanced it out. After reading raves of the Charlie bowl, I have to admit I was slightly let down. A mushy bowl of mixed up biscuits and gravy with some extra bits of meat, it was too carby for my taste. Although I undoubtably love carbs, I would suggest having some sort of fresh veg or vinaigrette or something on it to lighten it up. Coffee was abundant and excellent (JJ Bean). \\n\\nAlthough I would probably visit for the food again, the customer service is the real winner.

My friends all love you. However bad things get, always remember that you are loved.\\n\\nI've been here a few times now, and have had consistently great experiences. I don't know what the hell they're doing to that mac and cheese -- it's so creamy, so velvety, so dense and rich and unctuous -- but they should guard their secret closely lest all the other mac and cheese places in town attempt to steal their mojo. Even better, the salad that comes with it is perfectly dressed -- it could be maybe slightly sharper, but I'm picky about my greens and I consistently wolf their salad down. \\n\\nLast night I also splurged and tried the onion bread. Reactions were mixed among our group, almost all of whom tried it -- I personally thought it was fantastic and considered ordering a second portion to take home for breakfast this morning. Others turned their noses up at it. To be fair, it's not exactly what you'd expect -- this is a quick bread rather than a yeast bread, so its texture is soft and rich and cake-like. It's also faintly sweet and slathered in butter. So whether it works for you will be subject to your personal taste, but I thought it was awesome. If I lived closer to Liberty Glass, I expect I'd be stopping in for lunch just to order the onion bread and their fantastic tomato soup. \\n\\nThe cocktails are a mixed bag for me -- their menu of house cocktails is heavily whiskey-based, which pretty much leaves me out of it. But when I do have one there, it's well-made, so I know it's more a question of taste than skill. And I think the brother/sister pair that run the place are awesome. \\n\\nPS: If you've got a big group, as we did last night, ask for the upstairs room.

I can see how you could have a good time there, but I have to say that I just wasn't impressed overall, given a few issues with the service.\\n\\nThings I liked: \\n- The decor - it's cool and feels very upscale, even though the large dining room resembles a beehive more than anything else.\\n- The free Valentine's Day gifts for the girls!  Free things are always nice, and all the ladies received a long-stem rose along with a keepsake mug (past years have included a pretty champagne flute and martini glass)\\n- Strength of the drinks.  They're expensive, but you get your money's worth in the alcohol content - watch out!\\n\\nThings I didn't like:\\n- The wait.  As always for big groups, I called ahead to make the reservation, confirmed it again the day of, and yet we still had to wait an hour for our table to be ready.  Apparently the previous group occupying our table had lingered, but it doesn't seem right to wait an hour for a table that was supposedly reserved.\\n- The service.  Again, I should acknowledge that it was Valentine's Day and the place was PACKED, but our waitress didn't seem to know what she was doing and made it worse by being rude.  Example: we asked about the price of a bottle of champagne, which she couldn't tell us.  Without us actually ordering the bottle, she brought out what turned to be an $85 bottle - then got upset when we asked her not to open it and take it back.  She also mixed up some orders, which was annoying but understandable given the size of our group and (I guess) complexity of our order.\\n- The food was just decent, made even less so given the prices.  My entree (a noodle dish) cost $20 but was indistinguishable from the stuff I can order at 3am from Hoy Hing.  It was heavy on the veggies though, which I always appreciate.\\n\\nMoral of the story is... don't expect too much.

Still, I was excited at the chance to have my first go at Cambodian cuisine.  Most of the Cambodian items were actually noodles & rice dishes so we opted for the Dry Mixed Egg Noodle.  I decided to try it cause I saw this dude at the table next to us slurping it away as if it was the best thing in the world.\\n\\nLots of stuff in this bowl.  Ground pork, sliced pieces of pork, shrimp, cilantro, fried shallots, and sauce were not the focus and the star is definitely the egg noodles.  Great texture and the flavor's great, but as for the rest of the dish, it was a hit & miss.  We all agreed that it was a little bland, even with the dark looking sauce.  Tricked! :P  It also came with boiled sprouts and a slice of lime to add to the noodles.  Should've requested more lime for the noodles.  Also a very simple porkchop soup comes with the dish.\\n\\nHOWEVER, the rest of the dinner was spectacular.  The star was definitely the amazing Butter Beef.  Yes, they call this butter beef, for the sole reason that it is so tender and soft like butter xD  The acidic dressing, fried shallots, and the cilantro work together so well and packs so much flavor that you are forgetting you are actually eating super super rare beef.  We were all scared at first but then we realized, it's actually a carpaccio and the acid in the dressing should've done its job already in killing of the germs.  Definitely gonna be looking for this item here at other places and compare!\\n\\nHot & Sour Soup.  It is as addicting as tom yum soup.  I say that because it's sour but it's much lighter.  There's fish, bean sprouts, tomatoes, and pineapples which sweetens the soup then topped with fried shallots and green onions.  Could not stop drinking it. \\n\\nAnother famous dish from Phnom Penh is their fried chicken wings (thanks to Connie L. for reading the articles on the wall) with lemon and pepper dressing on the side.  The seasoning on the wings are crazy good and fried to an awesome crisp.

I generally don't opt for French food, but I'm slowly being brought back into the light with French bistro fare.  To start, we shared a plate of mussels persillade (parsley sauce), which had a nice bite from the vinegar and garlic, but wasn't overpowering.  Then I had the grilled salmon served with ratatouille.  I asked for the salmon to be grilled rare, and that is exactly what I got.  Makes me really happy when a cook knows how to grill to the proper temperature, especially when for a piece of fish.  It was a nice entree, and I am glad I ordered it.  Others at the table ordered the scallops and a special octopus salad with kale and lentils.  All the food looked amazing.  We also shared sides of sauteed mushrooms and spinach.  Veggies were well-seasoned and not at all overcooked.  We skipped dessert in favor of another bottle of Sancerre, but other tables looked quite happy with their sweet treats.\\n\\nService:\\nOutstanding. Full disclosure: my friend knows the owner of the Petit Robert restaurants, and during our meal the owner sat down with us to eat, so I suppose you could assume the service was extra-special\\" because of that; I don't think it would have made a difference, though. I think the staff is well-trained and knows how to make you feel comfortable.\\n\\nVibe:\\nChill, with a menu to match.

Make sure to wear something appropriate or you will feel out of place, especially if you plan to go on a weekend night (at least I did the first time I went here in flip flops and a t-shirt).

I have to say that the Beef Slider that I ordered was pretty money (literally the beef melted in your mouth)! But there was a catch to this so called meal, the slider was about the size of miniature muffin.  It would take me at least four or five of those things to satisfy my needs, which equates to about $20 bones! Not so happy anymore.  \\n\\nA highlight though was the drink special of the day, 10 year old Jamison for $5.  It was a healthy pour over the rocks.

I've seen a lot of mixed reviews about Marrakesh, and I think whether you like it will depend on what kind of experience you're looking for. It's definitely not your traditional American kind of place: you eat everything with your fingers, sit on super low backless stools, and the service isn't the super friendly smiles you'll get from standard American places. But I liked the change!\\n\\nOur group had the five course meal, which consists of a lentil soup, salad, entr√©e of your choice, a sweet pastry dish, and dessert. I had the Marrakesh Vegetarian Delight for me entr√©e and loved it and everything else. I asked them if there was a vegetarian option, and it turns out the only meat-containing course was the sweet pastry dish (B'stilla Royale), but he brought me out a smaller one made without meat! I think that was my favorite out of all of it. There was also a belly dancer. I'm still not sure how I feel about watching belly dancers (it's kind of awkward to me), but she was definitely talented. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that the service was more average - our server was kind of curt and our waters weren't refilled much.

The chicken was cooked perfectly and when I cut into it, it was perfectly moist. The risotto that came with it was a little too earthy for my taste.

It was one of our group members birthdays and she got cake flavored ice cream and we separately ordered the vanilla creme br√ªl√©e.

I was pleasantly surprised and thoroughly enjoyed my dinner. \\n\\nBy no means is it the best Thai food I've had, but I'd say it's on par with everything else I've eaten in Austin. We started with shrimp spring rolls, and they were not great. They didn't look or taste very fresh; they consisted mostly of wilted ice burg lettuce and it required a lot of peanut sauce to make them flavorful. The Tom-Yum soup was also not my favorite. I'm a lover of all things tangy, and dare I say this was actually TOO tangy! Unbelievable, I know. I think they went a bit overboard with the lemongrass and kaffir lime. \\n\\nThe chicken Pad Thai and the pork Green Curry were the stars of our dining experience. Both dishes passed my \\"meat test\\" with flying colors. If my food has nasty grisly, fatty, sketchy pieces of meat in it, it's pretty much guaranteed I will never eat there again. The Pad Thai was nothing particularly special, but it was tasty and will definitely fulfill any Pad Thai cravings I have in the future. The Green Curry was fantastic -- just spicy enough, flavorful, and refreshingly light even though it's a coconut-based broth. \\n\\nThe restaurant is clean, the decor was decent, and our server was very sweet and attentive.

My major complaint that I addressed you about on Twitter was the fact that our server, Andrew, completely missed our second course which was suppose to be the salads. While eating our main course which consisted of the chicken, tuna, steak, etc., I stopped Andrew and asked if this was our 2nd of 4 courses and he answered verbatim, \\"yes we still have the white chocolate fondue and pumpkin spice.\\" The way Andrew answered the question was as if these were two separate courses and come to find out they were not. \\n\\nOur second server who was also attending to our table was Adrian, and he was a lot more helpful and knowledgeable than Andrew was. When Adrian was fixing our white chocolate and pumpkin spice dessert fondue I asked him if the 4-course Christmas special came with a salad and he assured me that yes indeed it did. When I told him that Andrew never brought us our salads he apologized and said Andrew must of forgot.\\n\\nThis was our first time visiting The Melting Pot and I have literally been wanting to try this restaurant for over a year, ever since my mother had raved to me about how good the food and service was here after she visited for her wedding anniversary last year.

Tables are packed perhaps a little close together, but that was okay.\\n\\nThe food was all very classic.  Amazingly delicious, but nothing about the flavor shocked or surprised.  The chef seems to play with the avant garde more in terms of texture and visual presentation.  And the presentation really is shockingly good.  Gorgeous!  Lovely!

The rolls were fresh and delightful.  The salad would have reminded me of much less ambitious dishes if it wasn't for the spectacular presentation and the amazing freshness and flavor of the greens themselves.  French Champagne deserves the region's reputation (and Salts has full and half bottles).  The duck was spectacular, that experience alone would be worth a visit.  Perfectly cooked, crisp skin, tender meat.  It seemed very appropriate to the season, served with carrot, onion, turnip and baked pear.  (But a negative review notes they were serving the same preparation in July?)  It's the \\"duck for two\\" but I think there's enough there to serve three or even four.  At any rate, the leftovers were also very, very good.\\n\\nA good meal merits dessert, but after the duck we figured sharing would be the prudent course of action.

I got the watermelon gin drink and my husband got their signature Manhattan.\\n\\nThe food came out right away and we started off with a real bang.

It sat on a bed of yummy salad that we couldn't get enough of\\n-Hobe beef: tender, flavorful, juicy, and just all around scrumptious \\n-Mussels on a sweet potato funnel cake: this was a contender for one of the BEST dishes we've ever had and my husband doesn't even like mussels. The mussels were done almost calms casino style and sat on an amazing sweet potato funnel cake. \\n\\nOther dishes that we enjoyed but didn't blow us away:\\n-pork belly and homemade spam luau style: good but the pork belly was a little mushy and the dish was overall just decent\\n-shrimp cake: loved the veggies on this dish, the grape tomatoes were juicy and soaked in a tasty dressing\\n-Scallop dish: good and flavorful\\n-Wild bass: while still OK, probably our least favorite dish of the night\\n\\nDessert:\\n-Signature banana pudding: TO DIE FOR, and a total must get! You won't regret it\\n-\\"Rocky road\\": awesome all around, loved the caramel foam\\n\\nOverall, we LOVED Gunshow and it was really cool that Kevin was there that night to cook a dish (I even snapped a pic with him!).

Individual chefs cook their own plates and then come table to table trying to sell it.  The quality of the food varied greatly, the service can be best described as hipster snooty, the dining room was sparse and noisy, but overall was an interesting experience.\\n\\nThe Food\\nStarted off with some assorted appetizers. One which was some sort of salmon mousse on a crostini and the other a fresh shrimp tossed with salad greens also on a crostini. Nothing wrong with either one of these, certainly not mind-blowing, but good solid food. Maybe a little pricey for the portion size but you need to expect that when dining here.\\n\\nPork Skin Risotto (or something similar to risotto) After reading all the rave reviews about this dish I was excited and subsequently let down. First off they let us know that it wasn't risotto but instead something else (I forgot, my guess is a type of barley). Still decided to get it, which turned out to be a mistake. I really didn't understand this dish and why people like it so much. It was unbalanced with the only qualities being greasiness and salt. I felt like it could have been significantly improved with a splash of lemon.  I almost suggested it, but the attitude/ego level of the servers/chefs here seemed very high and I didn't want to get yelled at.\\n\\nArancini. Good but you can't really mess this dish up.  Deep fried balls of risotto and cheese smothered in more cheese. Pretty small portions, but I shouldn't really complain about fried rice and cheese. \\n\\nJapanese Spiced Scallops. These might have been the best thing I have ever had in my mouth and I'm not exaggerating. Almost made the mistake of passing on this dish. Looked pretty average when they brought it out some scallops sitting on some greens. After we accepted the dish they proceeded to pour a delicious dashi broth on top. The flavors were really explosive: salty, savory and spicy with each bite. Underneath the scallops hidden in the greens were these rice cake type crackers that added a muted crunch that perfectly complimented the texture of the scallop. Seriously this dish was amazing.  If I had to choose one thing to eat for the rest of my life this would probably be it. If you see this on the menu and don't order it you might as well cut off your tongue. \\n\\nMatambe (An Argentine holiday roast). After the ambrosial bliss of the scallops, next came this ho-hum beef (I think flank steak)  dish that was rolled and stuffed with carrots and served with fried potatoes. This dish was very average, nothing technically wrong with it but had no redeeming qualities.\\n\\nLast we had the fried cauliflower dish in some sort of puree drizzled with goat cheese. This dish was awesome as well. The cauliflower was fresh from the deep fryer and was perfectly complimented by the tartness of the goat cheese.\\n\\nFor dessert, I was again blown away. They had a take on thin mints that was perfect. The outer layer tasted like a flourless chocolate cake and was filled with a minty, not too sweet icing. Amazing.\\n\\nThere were a lot of other things on the menu that looked delicious, but did not get to try because my dining companion (edit: she is no longer my dining companion) doesn't like seafood, such as the fried clams and oysters.\\n\\nThe Service\\nI was a bit turned off by the pushiness of the waiters/chefs. I understand that they need to sell their food but every time we turned down a dish they gave us a pretentious and disappointed look.  I shouldn't have to apologize for not wanting to pay $15 for a burger. \\n\\nOverall this was a cool experience, but they definitely need to step up their game with some of their dish offerings and service.  For 2 people without drinks it came to $96 including tax and tip. For those looking for something different I think Gunshow is worth a try, but I don't think I will be rushing to go back anytime soon.

The first time I came here was during lunch on a Saturday and the place was busy. I did not have to wait long for a table (maybe 5 minutes). This place is small, very small which is both nice and kind of a pain. It has a intimate feel, which is nice, but also is so small that moving around can be a pain. \\n\\nThe menu is not large, but has good stuff. They offer a wide array of pizza and pasta options at pretty good prices. Considering the neighborhood it is in and the fact that it is a Todd English place, I thought the prices were great with a pizza not being over $20.\\n\\nOne of the good things you can do is get a split pizza. So if you want to try more than one, you can just have them do a half and half (they will just charge the price of the higher cost pizza in the split).\\n\\nI got a split with the portabella mushroom and pulled chicken. Both were great. I also liked how it was a thin crust (Neapolitan style) which was nice and crunchy. Everything was well cooked, so the pizza was not falling apart. I am normally a little apprehensive about getting pizza with 2 and 3 toppings as it usually falls apart and get messy. But that was not the case at Figs. They give bread, which was great and addicting. \\n\\nThe service was pretty good, not great. The pizza did not seem to take too long to cook, which was nice. Going back to the service for a second, it's not to say that the waitress was poor, just that she seemed to be one of only 2 people serving the tables. Because the place is so small (don't be alarmed or turned off by this fact) it was probably difficult to easily get around to the tables. It did not help that the people waiting for table were clogging the walkways to and from the kitchen. (I have been on warm days and most people hang around outside)\\n\\nThere is a nice little bar that you ca sit at that has a front row seat to the wood brick oven which is nice. They also have a pretty good win menu too.\\n\\nI would recommend this place as it has great food and is in a good location.

I'm not use to having a large vegetarian selection to choose from so it took me a while to decide.

It was a cold dish too which I thought was different.  The meal came with side dishes of corn, cauliflower and scrambled eggs.  Nothing really special. The wheat gluten turned out to be chewy and spongy in texture. Braised in a soya type of sauce with shiitake and wood ear mushrooms. I imagine the wheat gluten to be bland, just soaking up the sauce.

Too much butter.  So-so service.  That sums up my visit to the Urban Farmer; we just returned from our visit there minutes ago.\\n\\nBeing a visitor on the left coast, I was thinking about the crab cake benedict, but was concerned it would be way too heavy for my current stomach state.  A good crab cake is hard to come by; in my experience chefs at mid-level restaurants can be heavy handed on the oil thereby disrupting the flavor of the crab.  Also, I wasn't sure how hollandaise would agree with me at the moment.  So I asked the waitress what her favorite thing on the menu was - coincidentally, it was the crab omelette.  So I decided to give it  a whirl.  \\n\\nMuch to my chagrin, when my plate arrived it was doused in hollandaise sauce, which I was desperately trying to avoid.  My wife was sold on the omelette too and she HATES hollandaise sauce, so she was not terribly pleased when it arrived either. (The ferocity of her dislike is so great that I was certain that there was no mention of it on the menu because it would have been enough for her to steer clear; giving the benefit of the doubt we double-checked on the way out and there was indeed no mention of hollandaise on the omelette).  Also, I'm fairly certain the chef had just watched Julie and Julia, because this omelette was smothered in butter.  Even after scraping off the hollandaise and sweeping it to the side, butter was oozing from the omelette.  Hash browns were so soaked in grease they were barely edible.  Same goes for the english muffin.  Finally, suffice it to say that what little crab was in the omelette was ruined by the bath of artery-clogging amounts of butter.  \\n\\nAs for the service, you would think that when one of your diners leaves more than half her food on the plate, you would ask how he/she enjoyed it.  Our waitress seemed more concerned with her shift ending.  Then again it could have been more of the blase Portland aura.  Not sure.  Nonetheless, this was not a $40 meal.

If I ate a breakfast entree, a lunch entree, and a dinner entree from here, it would come in around 800-900 calories, and cost around $20. Eek. Not a great dollar-to-calorie ratio. I ate a protein bar with my breakfast entree and added rice to my lunch entree, and I still barely felt full. To get to ~1500 calories/day, I'd likely have to spend at least $30-$35 per day, which is definitely not in my budget. \\n\\nAnyway, I'd probably return here if I was in the neighborhood and needed to grab a quick, light bite, but I don't see myself becoming a regular here."},{"name":"P.

I must say the small size is bigger than any other small ive had which is a trend this pace likes to follow. The buffalo chicken pizza was delicious however it was a bit greasy, maybe because of the chicken? not overly spicy, not LOADED with bleu cheese.  The pepperoni pizza is a great way to really judge a pizza place, it's the standard pizza and if you can really make it memorable you're on to something. They do it here for sure, it was a thin hand tossed style but somehow slightly fluffy in the crust, the pepperoni wasn't greasy at all... i don't know what else to say about it but somehow it was the best pepperoni pizza I've ever had and really renewed my appreciation for the grandfather of all pizzas.

I liked the atmosphere, I thought the decor was cool.  The chair I sat in made me feel like Alice in Wonderland, as did the over-sized lamps.  I ran some chick over that was walking behind me because I couldn't see over the back of the chair and I just so happened to be getting up as she was passing.  Whoops - real classy.  Everyone was friendly and made me feel relaxed and welcomed.  Everyone smiled.  The waiter recommended an appetizer, which was very good.  The other girl helping us came over with our wine and chatted us up, which was comforting and made me feel like I was an old friend who had been there more than a few times.  My steak was cooked perfectly (I got the fillet mignon with bone marrow butter - yummm) and left little to no room for dessert.  We skipped out after that and headed down the street so I could get a chocolate martini.  I guess they have a pretty cool wine cellar but I only got to sneak a quick peek when I went downstairs to use the ultra-chic bathroom.

It was a humble Brazilian affair with fried yucca and delicious spongy rolls that were like the roll version of Ethiopian bread.  You knew it was a shoe-string operation as they were frequently out of half the menu.  It was always delicious if you knew what to order and sometimes they had bad live music.  When they moved, another place popped up in the same location with a suspiciously similar name.   It kind of pissed me off so I never ate there, but now Robin informs me it's the same owners!  With the new Sampaio location, the entire ethos changed to a semi-upscale wine bar atmosphere.  The food's at least as good and now they aren't out of everything.  Not much parking, but sometimes you can find small car parking on the side facing Burnet Rd.  Expect to spend a fair amount if you want to sample the imaginative wine list.

I will admit that I am a pizza \\"snob\\" (in the best possible way LOL). Honestly, I have more than one Yelp rant about the beauty of authentic New York style pizza and Rosa's comes close for Atlanta. Since I'm recently returning from a trip home and was in NYC, there are still some things that are missing for me and its glaring. Super sorry to say, believe me...this hurts, but true. \\n\\nFor example, I need the crispy crust that should occur after reheating that single cheese slice. Today's slice was thin, looked crispy, but too soggy for my taste. Please, also give me the fresh mozzarella--it matters. That will make the slice properly greasy, not \\"greasy\\" greasy...hahaha, there's a difference. Plus, the sauce has to be the boss...which apparently happens with the right combination of tomatoes and seasonings (according to my favorite pizza spot in NYC) which happens to have the best sauce I've tasted. I won't name the place here, but refer to my other reviews. \\n\\nAnyway, I was happy-ish after my pizza pit stop and the folks here are super nice. Thank you Rosa's for selling pizza \\"by the slice\\" and for making one of the closest versions of a traditional New York style pie that I've found in ATL. A few tweaks would really set this pizza off, but it may not be worth it in the South since there are just so many alternatives. I realize a lot of my fellow Northerners, and specifically New Yorkers, have left glowing reviews. Don't hate me and No shade, but we've been away from home too long. Go back and happily eat a few slices (from a great pizza shop, because we know that every NYC pizza place is not banging--be honest LOL).

It's just hard for the Mississippi in me to accept a biscuit without a ton of lard, but dipped in the cranberry apple butter it was pretty delicious anyway.\\n\\nIf you're on a quest for the perfect biscuit, may I offer for your consideration the biscuits at the Loveless Cafe...Nashville, Tennessee.  That's where biscuits lovers go to die. (And yes--sometimes prematurely from all the biscuit lard involved).\\n\\nAtmosphere was laid back and casual for a Sunday brunch.

Authentic, no-fuss tacos on homemade tortillas are something we've needed in Orlando for a while. I tried the chicken taco and the Black Rooster carne asada which were both delicious. The guacamole is fresh and has a little bit of a kick to it and the rice is very unique and tasty. The portions aren't too big so you can try a little bit of everything (as you should) and definitely get the flan for dessert even if you're not a flan fan, you'll like this one.

Things have certainly change as there was some sort of club or prom going on that night and the decor was trendy.  The place was somewhat empty, but the food was still as good as I remembered.  \\n\\nThe infamous chicken fingers were just slightly overcooked and the portion was a bit small, but still tasted great.\\n\\nWe also had the salt and pepper calamari which in my opinion was the winner.  The batter is light and airy, and the seasoning was on point.  I garnished my entree with the vegetables from the dish it was so good.\\n\\nI ordered the Shanghai Noodles which was good, but I expected it to be a little more spicey, and a little less sweet.  With the vegetables from the calamari, it made it enjoyable.  \\n\\nI loved that they used natural ingredients when it came to the meat, and it def tasted that way.  \\n\\nThe only downside is the menu is HUGE.  Kind of like the Cheesecake Factory which can make it overwhelming on what to order.  I'm sure Chef Gordon Ramsay would agree!  =)  \\n\\nI tasted a bit of the salt and pepper shrimp that my sister had ordered, but it didn't beat the calamari.  \\n\\nThe drinks are a little on the pricey end $10+, but no biggie.  \\n\\nThe club on the other side though was a bit annoying only cause the kids were sitting on the stairs at the front of the restaurant, and they definitely were under 21 although the people inside look older.  No idea what it was, but given the age range it must have been a private catering event.  \\n\\nThe staff above everything else was cordial.  The waiter we had was awesome.  He was really accommodating from the suggestions to the little things he did to make our meal better.  The dessert menu is lacking in which he offered Finales and ice cream since I think he knew they didn't have much. \\n\\nI also thought the potatoes was amusing that accompanied the dinner dishes.  Not sure why they choose that as the side to go with the dishes, but it was tasty too nonetheless.\\n\\nDish presentation is pretty too.  This is a great place to go for a date.  Atmosphere is cozy and romantic.  Hip and trendy. Casual and relaxing.  Def caters to whatever crowd.  We were there for a birthday.\\n\\nI also want to mention that the reviews below may be more used to the MSG type meals with more taste, less healthy benefits.

This is our second trip for dinner and both times it surprised us.  We'd been before when it was under different management and its much better now. \\nThe papadums and chutneys are well executed and the tamarind chutney has a great balance of that sour/sweet flavor.  The green chutney varies in it's heat so check it out before going crazy.  It's got a lively cilantro and aromatic green-ness. The meat samosas were good but a little dry inside. \\nWe've had the mutton special, chicken tikka masala, and lamb rogan josh as well as a mixed meat grill.  The mutton curry with potatoes has lots of great curry gravy without being overly gamey.  The chicken tikka masala was one of the best we've had in a while:  creamy, tomato sauce with the nice hit of curry that is well balanced.  The mixed grill done on the tandoor has shrimp, chicken, seekh kebab (minced beef) and onion which makes for a nice combination of flavors, a little bit smokey, a little bit caramelized, all around a good thing.  The rogan josh was good without being outstanding.  The meat and gravy were nice but it seemed a little bit like a vindaloo so maybe could use a little less acid for more depth of flavors.  Still, the staff were nice, the space is pretty comfortable once you settle in and the curries were well executed.  \\nWe love sparkling wine with curry so we brought our own both times since they don't have one on the menu. They only charge $7 corkage which is a steal.  We didn't even realize it but the last time were there over a month ago, we left our thermal wine cooler bag there.

The only thing close to yummy was the coffee (which we waited a long time for and then had to ask for refills!) and creme brulee. But the coffee and creme brulee weren't worth the close to $40 we paid per person for brunch. The food was cold. Yeah, I guess I shouldn't be surprised, it is a buffet, but I was hoping that this place was different than Old Country Buffet. I have had the (unfortunate) opportunity to go to Old Country Buffet about 10 years ago for their breakfast and I kid you not, it was better than Greenbriar. I feel really bad saying that but at least the food was hot and edible. 75% of the food at Greenbriar wasn't edible. I'm not kidding. We couldn't cut through the eggs benedict. It must have sat there for awhile or something. I couldn't bite or cut through the english muffin. The prime rib was cold. COLD! The other breakfast basics were just that - basic. Nothing special at all. The french toast was bleh. Bacon overly greasy- which I know is funny to say as bacon is fat but since every other offering was dry as hell, you'd think maybe the bacon wouldn't be dripping with fat. The chicken was so dry you could barely chew it. It wasn't busy and that should have clued me in. I wanted to like this place and wanted to have a nice place for my family to go to for special occasions. We drove quite a distance and we were all very disappointed. There wasn't one thing enjoyable about our brunch. In fact signing the bill was difficult for me. I felt ripped off.

They have been around for years, but neither of us had ever been to one, so we decided to go for a special date night. \\n\\nOur waitress was very soft spoken, but very kind in educating us on what this fondue thing is all about. After going through the menu and explaining everything to us, we decided on the Big Night Out with the Mojo cooking style. \\n\\nBut first, we started with some drinks. I had a Kettle One dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives, and she had the Love Martini. They were very good!\\n\\nThe first course of cheese fondue, included pieces of bread, cauliflower, carrots, broccoli, and granny smith apple chunks. The cheese was melted before us in the pot with beer, bacon, chives, and some secret stuff I think. It was good. The cheese dip was good. The bread was hard and stale, but maybe it's supposed to be like that. The apples in cheese was an odd combination, which was not bad, but not great either.\\n\\nThen came the salad. It was a really good wedge salad with blue cheese, tomatoes,  and a tasty house dressing. It too, was pretty good. We were off to a good start!\\n\\nThen came the main course.. We got the the Fondue Fusion, which was a mix of lobster tail, angus beef, marinated pork, buffalo chicken, and cajun shrimp. It also came with potatoes, broccoli, and mushrooms as the vegetables. We were excited by this because who doesn't like all that?! Here's where the whole thing went south for us... Our waitress kept referring to us cooking our own dinner. What that basically means is, they bring you a boiling pot of flavored bouillon, and you boil the meat yourself. Boiled meat? Really?? The angus steak looked amazing! Red, marbled, and tender... I should have eaten it raw. Stabbing it with the fondue fork and boiling it for the suggested 2 minutes, turned it into a piece of rubber. It worked OK for the lobster and shrimp, but beef, chicken, and pork, should never be boiled. It wasn't good. In fact, it was bad. I guess I expected the entree to be served cooked, with a fondue sauce of some kind to dip it in. There were sauces... plenty of them. But they only served to cover up the tasteless boiled meat that we were \\"cooking\\" at our table. \\n\\nAnd so far, our waitress was with us. Attentive and on the spot. We didn't complain. After all, this was our first time and maybe this was just how it's done.\\n\\nFinally, our 4th course of dessert arrived. We got the Chocolate Wildberry Crunch Fondue. This is described in their menu as their take on PB&J. And it was... and it was good! Served with oreo encrusted marshmallows, brownie bites, pound cake, cheese cake, rice crispie treat morsels, strawberries, and bananas. This was some good stuff for the sweet connoisseur. Unfortunately, I was there for the main course. \\n\\nOnce we finished dessert, we sat there and waited... and waited... and waited. Our waitress was gone. On break? Fired? Quit? Who knows?! But we were really getting impatient. We literally sat for about 30 minutes. Finally, a gentleman came up and asked us if we needed anything.... he was either the bus boy or the manager, we couldn't tell. He brought us our check and we gave him our card. Our waitress suddenly appeared and dropped it on our table, said a quite \\"Thank you\\" and walked away. What?? What did WE do? \\n\\nOverall, it was OK if you are going for drinks and a cheese fondue. It's a great place for a late night dessert. But if you want a main course, I think it's disappointing. And then our service at the end was unacceptable. We will not be going back. Maybe all these years of seeing it and hearing about it, built up the hype. But your money is better spent elsewhere, in my opinion.\\n\\nUPDATE: One of the managers called me today to discuss my experience. He was very nice and apologetic for our experience. I'm not sure if we really had a bad experience or we just aren't really into that style of cooking. But he offered to make it right, and invited us back and said he would comp our dessert.

Here is a fancy place you can enjoy, right in the neighborhood, and finish with a walk around the corner to the Hyde Park Theater. The ultimate evening.\\n\\nThe evening at Vino Vino started with a friendly greet and a nice glance around. The bar was crowded with happy \\"Women who Wine\\" who looked like they were appreciating the company, wine and sophisticated-cum-wine-cellar decor. The brick walls and wall wine storage evoked something from another era on another continent.\\n\\nOn to the food.\\n\\nMussels with fries are known as \\"Moules Frites\\" (though not on this menu) and they are a solid French working class dish. V.V. does an exemplary version. They especially win points in serving up some larger sized mussels. The sauce was tasty. The topping aioli on the Fries evokes the dutch and french way of eating Fries. My only complaint: The quantity was overall shy of what the typical mussels appetizer comes to. But you don't feel too bad if you order it during happy hour.\\n\\nWe shared a salad. Not too memorable. It had a lot of beets. 2 colors worth! But hey, if you wanted to remember a beet salad better you'd have  some kid spill your wine all over it.\\n\\nAmongst the cheese selections there was one happy hour special: a blue fourme d'ambert with accoutrement. We ran out of some of the accoutrement and the waiter brought us another basket!\\n\\nNow  the scales tipped a bit out of favor: The choice was: a few more small plates or an entree, billed as a \\"bigger\\" plate. The warning sign was that they didn't actually commit to the word \\"entree\\". It was priced like an entree and described like an entree, but.....it was as though they were struggling with how far to dip their toe into the \\"Full Restaurant\\" category and they remained chicken shit on the sidelines.\\n\\nSo what did we get? Flounder  with fennel  bludgeoned to death with baked cheese. Oh, but it had MEYER LEMON! (really?) We wanted to see the file on the offending cheese and ensure it got added to some list somewhere, but the waiter had no idea what it was. We told him to check and he never did. So, we have a pretentious and overly trendy A-list of ingredients that seem like they never even made it to the party. And for the price of a fancy entree. I guess that's what you get on a \\"bigger plate\\". Boo!\\n\\nOH, but the wines are good and the tastings are fun. We had a special raw tuna appetizer done very well. And there is the promise of some great Paella on Sundays. So, Vino Vino is yet another place on the growing list of really good happy hours that doesn't quite cut it as a full dinner place. \\n\\nThe take-away lesson? Dinner is over rated anyway. It makes you fat, slow and even more drunk. It's a desk top computer in a world of iPhones. And it's harder to dance or stay awake afterward. So, user, beware! Three stars as a restaurant. Four as a wine bar with some de-emphasized  \\"plates\\". Heck, with some skill maybe YOU could turn this into a 5 star place!"},{"name":"Lenox Road Bar & Grill","address":"3405 Lenox Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"One of the nicer Marriott restaurants.

Our waitress told us that they had only been open for a few days when we ate there. Because of this, many items on the menu were actually not yet available. She even told us that they were having trouble getting pork past security for some reason so they were going to have to change the menu. I work in a new business, so I understand the troubles of having to sort through everything and not being at 100% functional, but she listed off item after item after item that were unavailable. By the time she finished, I'd say only 50-60% of the items on the menu were actually okay to order, even including the drink list. If they were going to have such trouble getting everything together, I think they should've come up with some temp menus until they were fully functional.\\n\\nOther than that, the service was good, tables were clean, and the dishes were tasteful.

We said steak and he suggested this Charley's, and the existing reviews were good so, we decided to try it.\\n\\nI won't say that it was a big mistake, but it certainly is not the high quality steak house experience that I'm used to. Our waitress was quite a bit frazzled and was extremely apologetic, even for things that weren't particularly wrong. I would have to give the service a solid mediocre rating.\\n\\nThe lobster bisque was way too creamy. It was almost pale from so much cream, and ended up with muted flavor. There was a dollop of whipped butter, it seemed, thrown on top. This cold lump of additional creaminess didn't really add to the dish. At least the lobster claw provided was well cooked and had decent flavor.\\n\\nThe side salad was kind of a mess of iceberg, chopped bits of tomato and cheese. Very overdressed for my tastes. I should have upgraded to the wedge. We ordered a side of broccoli which was just fine, but the side of \\"grilled vegetables\\" was really disappointing.\\n\\nI had ordered a T-bone, medium rare, Pittsburgh style. What I really meant to order was Chicago style -- cooked to desired done-ness and then seared on the outside. Pittsburgh is basically seared only on the outside and then extremely rare on the inside. Having been disappointed last night, now that I realize I ordered wrong, I must say that they nailed the Pittsburgh right on the money. The fillets that my associates ordered were well cooked and had good flavor.\\n\\nOverall this was a middle-of-the-road steakhouse experience.

I should know better than to be lured by a salad consisting of roasted BEETS and chevre from a local dairy. Yet there I stood at the Grand Central on Weidler, craving a small snack, and mentally patting myself on the back for not walking into the Panda Express across the street. Sure, a salad of cheese and BEETS for 7.25 is a little steep. But so is the price of a poorly-treated stomach trying to rid itself of orange chicken that's been sitting in a warming plate since breakfast.\\n\\nWell, remind me never to let my bourgeois food cravings get in the way of snacking again. The salad was advertised as having a vinaigrette dressing. And the salad turned out to be a hastily thrown-together fistful of greens (some that looked incredibly stringy) with the chevre and BEETS lumped quietly in the corners of the cardboard carry-out box. It desperately needed the dressing, which was nowhere to be found. For 7.25 (and a dollar tip because I'm a masochist), even the BEETS couldn't justify the price.\\n\\nStill, if I were to rate my own complicity in this snacking fail, I'd still come out as part fail. This isn't the first time a Grand Central employee has stiffed me on the sweet stuff. I've been coming to this location for years, and every time I get a bacon egg bolo to go, there's a chance that the tomato relish will be forgotten and left to decorate some other dumbass' sandwich. The tomato relish is to the bacon egg bolo what the vinaigrette might be to the salad. Since the bacon egg bolo is the main draw for Grand Central, when you leave that component out, it's like listening to an orchestra without a woodwind section. \\n\\nSo shame on me for having the audacity to go big on snacks.

Although, again, i must note, we were the only table in the whole place that afternoon. \\n\\nThe food was great. My friend started with the plate of berries and yogurt. He is not a fan of greek yogurt, and neither am I, so we cant judge on that, but the berries were super fresh and delicious.  He also had some sort of steak that normally comes with eggs, but he swapped for asparagus. The steak was delicious even though it was not cooked as specified--came out looking more medium rare than medium well. But still absolutely delicious. The asparagus was AMAZING. probably the best asparagus i have ever had in my life. \\n\\nI started with the tuna tartar--soo good! There's nothing i love more than a good tuna tartar. The crispy crackers it came with were also delicious and complemented the fish really well. For the main course, I had the lobster frittata--delicious. And full of the aforementioned awesome asparagus. The only bad thing is it was way too freaking big. After munching down on the tuna and 2 moo-mosas, i could only finish maybe a 3rd and took the rest home. Normally i don't have a problem with getting left overs wrapped up, but there's something about re-heating an egg based dish that just isn't as appealing as, let's say, chinese food. I would have been more than happy to pay half the price for half the dish, or being warned about the portion size in advance and pick something smaller instead. \\n\\nAlso, the bathrooms downstairs have really nice sinks. \\n\\nThe only thing that partially annoyed me about this place was the menu organization on their website. I'm the kind of anal retentive individual that likes to memorize the menu options before trying a new restaurant so that I can be prepared and know exactly what I want the minute my tush hits the seat. I was looking at their website both on my PC and on my phone, and it was really unclear as to what menus are served when and at what time. this resulted in me not being able to order the beef carpaccio because that day they happened to be doing the brunch menu instead of lunch. \\n\\nAll in all, a lovely and very pleasant dining experience."},{"name":"P.

The biggest problem: management.\\n\\nLACK OF HYGIENE: At one point I watched the manager/owner take a napkin from a used table to wipe two clean tables across the aisle. He then picked up another napkin from the dirty table and wiped the other tables again. When a server came by to bus I suggested she spray down the tables across from us as I had just watched her boss use a soiled napkin on them. Instead of properly cleaning them she immediately told her boss what I had said, who came by and explained that he had \\"sanitized\\" the tables when he wiped them with the second \\"clean\\" napkin. He used the word \\"sanitized\\" several times but not once did I see him fetch a proper cloth or spray bottle to use on the two surfaces he had wiped with someone's discarded napkin. It seemed he was under the impression that because he did a second wipe the tables were now \\"clean\\" but he didn't factor in that the two people sitting at the dirty table had been eating, talking, coughing and sneezing all over the serviettes he then used on someone else's eating surface. He claimed both napkins were \\"clean\\" but I saw that they were used, which means he smeared someone's bodily fluids/mouth-wipings all over the place then left the table as is. It now almost seems pointless to say that my husband's fork had solid bits of food stuck to it when we first sat down but it did.\\n\\n**If that's not enough, keep reading.**\\n\\nCHAOTIC SERVING SYSTEM: Watching our server and her co-workers navigate the restaurant was insane. They're not assigned sections. When people are seated, the mgr/owner apparently ticks off a chart on who gets the newest table depending on how many people that waitress is currently serving. So our server was waiting on our table in one corner and another in the opposite corner on the other side of the restaurant with a dance floor/bar area in between. To add to the confusion everyone seemed to do everything. The servers also had to seat patrons, make drinks and bus tables. None of the patrons had any idea who to ask for what and seeing how the waitresses had to be all over the restaurant, if we waited to ask our original server for things we'd have been there forever. The ladies beside us had to ask two servers for a drink then the manager came by to see what they wanted and he almost sent a third server to make the drink when one of the first came back with it. Confusing? You bet. \\n\\n**Still with me? Might as well keep going, then.**\\n\\nMANAGEMENT: Pretty sure we stopped by as the manager/owner was in the middle of auditioning for Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares. He was stomping around the restaurant chatting away on his cell phone, occasionally seating people while still on said cell phone (tossing menus onto tables with a slap), and generally getting in the way of his staff. He handed out customer comment cards which we duly filled out but when it came time to discuss how to improve, he essentially said \\"this is how it's done here\\" then passed us off onto our server. Yet while we chatted with her he kept hovering within earshot and eavesdropping. He was also the DJ for the duration of our meal. He would sometimes pause at the laptop during his stomping patrols and chose Youtube videos ranging from Middle Eastern to Celine Dion as very loud ambiance music. You know, to set the mood I guess.\\n\\n**Should probably mention the food.**\\n\\nTHE MENU: was a hodgepodge of Middle Eastern/Mediterranean/standard North American/Southeast Asian/East Asian. So basically all the offerings of mall food court fare starting at $10 a plate and available 24/7. The only thing missing was sushi but give them long enough and that might be thrown in there too.

I have to say the garlicky fried chicken wings stole the show! It was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside and the garlic taste just drips through your mouth as you chew on the chopped garlic with tender chicken meat. The marinated butter beef was a little surprising as it came quite raw of which i was hesitant to eat (the beef is supposed to be cooked by the special marinate). So the beef was very tender as you can imagine but more importantly though, we both demolished the marinate sauce as it tasted so good!  I think however this is a dish that can be easily modified to suite a greater number of people because the marinate is the show stopper here not the beef. So if they can substitute the beef or cooked the beef a little more but add int he amazing marinate sauce, then it be truly amazing!

We called ahead an made reservations because the first time we tried to get it there was a 2 hour wait, and rightfully so. The restaurant isn't too big and they have indoor and outdoor seating. We went on a beautiful night. With most outdoor seating areas, I feel like you get forgotten, but not here. We always had our waiter or someone coming by to check in on, refill our glasses, check the food, etc. the service was above and beyond most place I've been!\\n\\nThe menu is a little bit pricier, but not outrageous. For two of us with no appetizer, drinks, or dessert we spent around $35-$40. It was well worth it. They start you out with a bowl of bread with their signature sauce. Their sauce is seriously out of this world! Words escape me when trying to describe it because it is just that good! I don't know if that's a standard sauce in Switzerland or just theirs, but really it doesn't matter. They hit the nail on the head! I can't pronounce or spell any of the menu items, but I had the thinly sliced pork with another amazing brown sauce (not quite a gravy) with their bacon hash browns, essentially.

It's possible I'm just desensitized to social niceties having grown up a Yankee, but I found all the staff to be perfectly reasonable individuals. As far as I'm concerned, any waiter with the huevos magnificos to tell a female patron that she's \\"greedy\\" after polishing her plate clean is A-OK in my book. Just think of it as dinner and a show without the added cost. \\n\\nFood: The food at Bab's consists of stylized American breakfast and lunch fare. The menu is somewhat limited, but the available offerings are diverse and there's something that should please most casual diners with reasonable expectations. During my visit for Sunday brunch, I opted for the chicken sandwich with a side of fries. I can't say I was absolutely blown away by the quality of the offerings, but for the price and portion, I left satisfied. \\n\\nService: Although the service was quick, the staff appeared somewhat disorganized. In particular, it doesn't appear that the staff are assigned to any particular table or section of the restaurant. At last count, there were four different people who tended to our table during brunch, including a request for our orders by another waitress after they had already been placed. Sweet potato fries were also served with my entree after I clearly articulated to the waitress that I wanted regular fries. \\n\\nAtmosphere: The atmosphere takes some getting used to, particularly if you're accustomed to the meticulous patios and urban chic decor of many of the other brunch spots in the area. Babs is basically in the basement of an old house and the decor would best be described as eclectic - that being said, this is a perfect place for a casual brunch out with friends, not a place to impress a client or potential love interest. \\n\\nCost: Appropriately priced for the food quality and area. Brunch options were approximately $10 each. For the most part, you could easily get out of here for less than $20 a person, including tip - which is an absolute steal in this section of Midtown. \\n\\nOther: Babs can be somewhat difficult to find for first time visitors. It's located on the side of the house that's situated between the Fifth Ivory and Takorea - on Juniper in between 5th and 6th streets. Parking is available in the lot directly outside the restaurant, or free of charge along the surrounding side streets.

As we didn't get a chance to experience the food last visit (just the poor service), I suppose an update might be in order now that we have.  Unfortunately, I can't say I have too much positive to report.  Now the food wasn't terrible by any means, we both enjoyed the majority of our food, but the experience was still a negative one.  \\n   We had visited at a very slow time for most restaurants (deliberately), and here we were, in fact, the only people dining in the restaurant at the time (there may have been a couple outside as well, but not in).  To our great surprise, our server was none other than the proprietor of the restaurant himself, Mr. David L.  David seems to be a very passionate man about his restaurant.   A very positive thing.  Other reviewers have mentioned how truly sure NOPA is that they are serving a superior product, I can confirm that belief (although I can't agree with it).  Unfortunately, he is kind of an arrogant personality (takes one to know one I fear...), and committed one faux pas after another when interacting with us.  The first of many was assuming that we were both wine neophytes just because of our age and budget, instructing us with much unsolicited advice on how to appreciate the wine we chose.  Given that the lady is a certified Sommelier, we were more than a little annoyed, and slightly offended.  I can understand he was likely just trying to be helpful, but his personality is frankly abrasive.  Owner aside , our food, as I mentioned , was acceptable.  Now it was certainly nothing special, but no glaring issues. \\n    You may notice that I upgraded my review from 1 to 2 stars.  This is primarily because of the mans passion for his restaurant, and the fact that the food is decent (although for the price, you can find much better in my humble opinion).  However, I just can't bring myself to go higher than 2 stars, it is just a strange establishment, with strange ownership.  The food is overpriced, I hear nothing but negative reviews (not just from yelp) from other visitors, and I have yet to have a good experience.  In addition, the responses of the owner to reviews on Yelp are deeply disturbing and highly un-professional.  If I could offer advice, stop the negative attacks.  Yelp IS free speech.  The restaurant is the problem, not Yelp.

Despite living VERY close, the last few times we've ordered pizza for deliver it has taken a VERY long time to get our pizza.  Now mind you, when we order online it nearly always says 70-80 minute delivery time.  A few times it has been faster because we're close but the last few times it has taken noticeably longer than their longest delivery time.  1.5-2 hours plus.  It's not a huge deal, we try to be patient, but that usually means our pizza is room temperature or just warm when we get it.  When we call to ask about our pizza nobody really seems to care.  Maybe they're busy, maybe we get a half hearted apology, but it never really feels like they care.  If I had to base my rating on just the pizza it would be 3 stars, it's solid but nothing special.

Future Lawyer and I hoped that we were in for a real culinary treat and were excited to book our Valentine's Dinner at NOPA Grill. The restaurant is off of Park Ave., close enough to all the excitement, but just far enough away to allow for the kitschy name.\\n\\nWe arrived on time for our reservation and were quickly escorted to our outside table. Mind you, we were not asked if we wanted to sit outside and there was a low of 43 that night. All would have been well if I was not in a short cocktail dress and they had rented more than one heater for the 10 or so outdoor tables they had. The hostess offered me a blanket, which I found tacky, as 1. I did not want to have to lint roll myself after a night out and 2. I'm a bit of a germ-a-phobe. I declined the offer, and we were dropped off at a table, without menus. A gentleman asked if we wanted to order drinks but we had no idea what was on the wine list. I believe he sent the hostess back out with menus after we told him that, but we couldn't seem to get a drink order in after that for quite some time.\\n\\nAfter being seated for a few minutes,I had Future Lawyer ask if we could move closer to the heater or inside once something was available as my legs were frozen. Thirty minutes into our visit we were finally moved and finally were able to get a glass of wine and put in our appetizer and meal orders. (We had figured at this point, we might as well order everything while we had the chance.) I was disappointed that they refused to make the \\"1-2 Thai My Shoe\\" flat bread without scallions to accommodate my allergy, and said \\"everything had been prepped as of 5 am that morning\\". We settled on the Boom Boom Shrimp Appetizer ($12.50). For entrees I selected the Crab and Lobster Ravioli ($20.50) and he ordered the Mediterranean Chicken ($19.50). \\n\\nThere was an extreme backup in the kitchen, which meant that it took 35 minutes after we placed our appetizer order for it to arrive, to which we were totally underwhelmed. It tasted like unseasoned breaded shrimp drizzled with a minute amount of ranch and whatever orange sauce they called \\"boom boom sauce\\". It would have been better with a ramekin of sauce to dip in. Entrees arrived 30 minutes after that, to which we couldn't even finish. Mostly because we were so sick of waiting for food by that point, but also the flavors were just mediocre at best. The Mediterranean Chicken tasted as though it had not been marinated or seasoned ahead of time and the mashed potatoes they were served on had zero flavor. No milk, butter, salt, nada. My ravioli arrived in a red sauce, not a cream sherry as described in the menu and it was very overpowering for the flavor. We finished about half of what was on the plate, then asked for the chicken to be boxed up (for my pup) and cashed out without dessert (Too bad we lost our appetite for them, they looked good). \\n\\nIf I spend over two and a half hours at a restaurant, I usually leave full, happy and possibly slightly drunk. I was none of these things. \\n\\nThe staff seemingly had no clue how to handle a busy night like Valentine's Day, and bickered loudly with each other outside, in front of tables. We witnessed no less than three arguments like this between servers and management, which was really embarrassing. They also let their stress carry over into the tables, and there were times we couldn't tell who our server really was. \\n\\nOverall the menu seemed to have a lot of potential, but for a kitchen that had been \\"prepping since 5 am\\", there's no excuse for poor seasoning or flavors. Also, if they were out of the cream sherry sauce, they should have advised me of that when ordering.

They were soggy and lacking in taste or texture.  The spring roll sampler were too small to establish how good it could be.  Crispy chicken livers were kept whole and I believe that was a mistake.  I definitely tasted small bits of the good things about liver but it was undercooked and had a raw quality to it that was not for me.  Truffle Mac and cheese was bland, and the pasta seemed to have been the bottom shelf pick. Fettuccini carbonara was the reason for my visit.  The pasta did not have any taste at all; probably needed seasoning or would have been great if it were actually made fresh and not one that was processed and should never be served at places that call themselves restaurants. Also, the pancetta did not appear to have any origins that had to do with a pig.  I have to say that I didn't finish anything I ordered because they were not good.  Prices were a bit on the high end, and if they're going to call themselves Italian restaurant by using cucina, then the food should reflect that it was cooked and had origins of the kitchen and not of stuff pulled from stop and shop shelves.

Honestly, I was skeptical because of mixed Yelp reviews and the higher than average price (for Portland).  I was anticipating a mediocre tourist trap but discovered otherwise.  \\n\\nBrunch here was a pleasant surprise.  The quality of ingredients and creativity in cooking was welcome.  It was a hearty, satisfying brunch.  Not a great deal complexity here, just good straightforward ingredients and cooking.  Food should be accessible to all, but the most health conscious palates.    \\n\\nMy dining companions and I ordered their Chicken Fried Wagyu Steak Special ($15-ish, can't recall sorry), a mixed green salad with malt vinaigrette and a side of flatiron steak ($17).  We also had an order of 'steel cut oatmeal' ($8), which my companion loved, but I didn't get the chance to try.  Note that 'The Nines' complementary breakfast does NOT serve the same oatmeal, as confirmed by said dining companion who said it was mushy and flat in flavor.\\n\\nChicken Fried Wagyu Steak was great!  An actual thick cut wagyu 8-10 oz steak is used, as opposed to a thin, cheap chop steak you would get traditionally.  So far it's the best chicken fried steak I've tried.  Steak is nice and juicy, cooked close to medium well, but still juicy & more on the lean side.  No gristle or excess fat was found.  No bone either.  Breading is pleasantly thin, subtly seasoned, and without excess oil.  \\n\\nOn top of the chicken fried steak, is a small portion of delicious coleslaw.  On the bottom is a serving of hash brown patty, & moderately thick sausage gravy.  The dish also comes with a side of eggs.  Everything works well in unison.  It's a tad on the heavy side, but should be moderately filling for heavier eaters.\\n\\nMixed Green Salad with a side of flat-iron steak was also a delight.  Not unlike other good Portland restaurants, the quality of greens is exceptional.  The flat-iron steak stands out here with an abundance of flavor, cooked perfectly medium rare as requested.  Portions are fairly generous.  This is one of the better steak salads I've had that rivals Park Kitchen's (also in Portland, OR) wonderful flank steak salad.\\n\\nAs mentioned prior, coffee here is a bit flat.  If you must order it, it would probably work better black than with creamer or sugar.  It was also not quite as hot as I would have preferred.  To be fair, I've never been a fan of Sumptown coffee blends, which Urban Farmer uses.\\n\\nService is very attentive and prompt.  Seating area is modern and comfortable.  The design integrates seamlessly & tastefully into 'The Nines'  hotel lobby.  The high ceiling & abundance of space in the seating area give the environment a refreshing & airy feel.  Acoustics don't intrude on conversation.  \\n\\nThere are many other creative dishes that look promising, including their 'shrimp & grits'.

I heard that it is really hard to get reservations to this restaurant so when I saw that there was a 6:30 opening yesterday on a Tuesday, I booked it right away and made plans to head straight there after work. The restaurant was actually not too busy when we arrived so if anyone is planning to walk-in instead of make reservations, I think early dinners on Tuesdays are probably a safe choice.\\n\\nJust a quick explanation of the restaurant concept: people seem to describe it as \\"dim-sum style service\\". There are more than a handful of chefs that create individual dishes for the night. You can actually see them making their dishes on the side in the kitchen! After they are done making their dishes, they come up to you at your table, show you their dish, and explain what their dish is. They give you a menu ahead of time so that you can have an idea on what dishes will be presented to you. When I'm eating at a new restaurant, I'm always curious what the dishes will look like and what the portions are like but you never really get to know until you order it. However, the big positive about this place is that you know exactly what you are getting before you say yes or no to ordering it. The waitress is also really great in helping out if you are waiting for a dish that hasn't come around or if you want to transition to the dessert menu. I would highly, highly recommend that you try as many dishes as possible.\\n\\nNow for the food/drinks breakdown: My boyfriend and I ordered the toasted old fashion and the rose gold. The toasted old fashion was a cool drink to get because the bartender makes the drink tableside and actually puts the cinnamon stick on fire. The rose gold drink wasn't bad, especially if you like tequila and salt. Like I said, we ordered a lot of food so bare with me! We started off with the chilled vidalia soup. This was one that my boyfriend and I agreed not to order but when I saw it in person, the dish was so darn pretty that there was no way to deny it. Good thing I didn't because the chilled soup was delicious and very different from anything I've eaten before. It has flower petals in it along with seaweed and puffed grains. We then had the oxtail with gnocchi. YUM!! My boyfriend isn't a fan of oxtail normally but he was all about this dish. We were so happy but food just kept getting better and better. Next we had the pork belly and that was my boyfriend's favorite dish of the night. The pork belly had the perfect texture with just enough crisp on the outside and juicy inside. The salad, cornbread cakes, and the beans that came with it complemented the pork belly perfectly.  Next we had the red snapper crudo. I was a bigger fan of it than my boyfriend but I thought it was a perfect dish to have between the heavy meat dishes because it was light and fresh! Just like the pork belly, all the components of the dish just complemented the red snapper so well. Next we had the short rib! The roasted carrots were surprisingly so freaking delicious. As for the short rib, it was nice and tender. Right when you try to cut the short rib, it just shreds because of the tenderness. My boyfriend and I loved the short rib but I personally thought it reminded me a lot of Kalbi-Jjim (korean braised short rib) and I actually prefer Kalbi-JJim. As for the next dish, it was the korean styled trout with kimchi grits and cucumber salad. The chef came to us right away and of course we couldn't say no to a Korean styled dish. Let me tell you... I WAS SO IMPRESSED. It had such a nice kick of spice and I love me some grits. To top it off, my boyfriend's favorite korean side dish is cucumber kimchi/salad so that made the dish perfect for us. I think this dish was my favorite and I ate like 95% of the dish. My boyfriend doesn't like seafood but he was pleasantly surprised with how much he loved the flavors of the fish and the grits. Our least favorite dish of the night were the greek fries. They tasted great but we didn't think it was worth the price or was unique enough compared to the other dishes. We ended the meal with the chocolate donut and banana pudding. I am not a huge fan of banana or of pudding but it was darn delicious and I ate the whole thing up. My boyfriend preferred the donut but he did say it was the best banana pudding he had (he's not a fan of bananas and pudding either). \\n\\nAll in all I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone. This restaurant lives up to the hype!!! My boyfriend said it was one of the best restaurants he's had and would come again if we ever visited Georgia again. Coming from him, that's a pretty big deal since he isn't a big foodie. Just a heads up though, the restaurant isn't quite and you'll share tables with other people so get ready to get close up and personal but it makes the eating experience more fun and interesting!"},{"name":"Falco's Pub","address":"9950 SE Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"For what it is, it's the shit. $2.75 drinks, $5.00 steak.

No spice is no spice, and 3 or 4 stars out of 5 should be enough to sear the skin inside any American born person's mouth.

Let me count the ways:\\n\\n1.  Location and style.  I love Grandview and I love the fact that there's ample parking in the lot behind Avenue.  The restaurant itself was a delight.  I first noticed the French bulldog umbrellas in the stand by the door and, frenchie fan that I am, I was already hooked.  Inside, I was expecting to see Frank Sinatra.  The Avenue gives off a fancy diner vibe with class and elegance.  The NYC-themed made me feel like I was really in the Big Apple.  I expected it to be dark but it wasn't and that was appreciated.  Even the bathrooms were exceptional.  \\n\\n2.  Service.  Our server was so friendly and helpful.  He was on top of his game throughout the entire meal and really made our experience top-notch.\\n\\n3. Drinks.  The cocktail and wine list is brilliant.  My friend and I enjoyed the Sloe Tom Collins (so tasty!) while our dates tried the Manhattan and the Bronx.  Everyone was pleased with their selections.\\n\\n4.  Food.  I started out with the Tavern Salad.  I am  usually not a big salad fan but this salad was incredible.  I had to forego the bleu cheese because of my milk allergy but even without it, the salad was perfect.  The vegetables were fresh and the salad dressing was the perfect addition.  I would have been happy with just a giant plate of that salad but I also opted to try their 8oz sirloin and that was delightful as well.  Mine was cooked to the perfect medium rare and the seasoning was delectable.  My steak was complimented by the mashed potatoes that come in this adorable little dish with a tiny lid.  They were delicious!  Everyone in my group loved the food.  \\n\\nThank you, Avenue Steak Tavern, for making our Sunday evening dinner a success!

When we entered I was surprised to notice the place had a nice country atmosphere decorated with old wooden ship paraphernalia and reminded me of a few places I used to frequent growing up in Eastern Ohio. We arrived around 5:00pm thinking I should have no trouble getting seat only to notice the crowd of predominantly older people(retired) still waiting for a seat. The greeter did suggest we could grab a seat in the bar area instead of a 20 minute wait. The bar area didn't have quite as good of an atmosphere as the main dining area and was a little cramped, which was fine with me since it \\"ixnayed\\" the wait time. The server came to table quickly and gave us the specials and advised of the free buffet food(pizza rolls and meatballs) we could have while we waited. The menu included a wide variety of seafood including fresh clams and mussels along with normal \\"steakhouse\\" cuts of meat. \\nI decided to try the NY strip with a side order of shelled clams. I'm not really sure why I got the clams because they aren't particular a favorite of mine. Having said that they were OK. I was more impressed with the salad. The simple house salad was very fresh and was complimented nicely by the great tasting blue cheese dressing. From past experiences, I feel that if the salad is good then I'm in for a treat with the main entree. This was no exception. The NY strip was cooked to a perfect medium without charring the outside too much, which I am not a fan of.

The first was a business luncheon for three where all of us were too involved in maintaining energy levels to eat a steak, so we each had one of Mooo's ample salads.  But since Mooo obviously is for meat eaters, my wife and I found ourselves in that neighborhood over the weekend and stopped by for steaks.  Mine was a sirloin, ordered medium rare, but a touch more towards medium, and my wife had the 8 oz filet, which she enjoyed.  One catch with Mooo is everything is a la carte, so the steaks come on this large platter-like plate with nothing but an obelisk of seasoned butter for decoration, which oddly enough, is denoted on the plate by a long toothpick with a pendant - sort of like something you'd find on a yacht.  If you order the sides, be sure to plan to share, and by no means would up to four people need more than one order of planko and parmesan onion rings (yum)  or sauteed mushrooms. We began the meal with their cold seafood platter; two local oysters, two far away oysters, two shrimp and half a minuscule lobster tail; good, but not overwhelming. Must be a shortage of food servers in Boston because ours needed to consult on answers to questions like, \\"What's on the seafood platter?\\" and she never got the answer but we ordered anyway figuring there would be cold seafood on it.  (So it was a trick question - no wrong answers).  There was a moment of sticker shock at the end of the dinner, when my wife picked up the check and promptly lost color from her face.

You could just feel the heat in the restroom. They tried to add a fan in there, but that was not helping. As we were eating our meal, I felt so hot. It's way too hot in Texas to not have A/C. They had a live band playing on the patio. I wouldn't have minded that, but it is too hot outside to enjoy it.\\n\\nThe service is hit or miss. We sat at the high top tables near the bar and the bartender was assisting us. She worked that bar, made drinks for the other servers, and waited on our table.

The catfish was pretty good...I think the breading could have been a little more crisp and crunchy, but the catfish had good flavor. Sometimes you get ahold of catfish that has a dirty, fishy taste to it...you know, like it tastes like the lake they fished it out of, but this was not the case. The spicy  breading had a nice flavor as well...it's a bit of a creeper. Starts off not so bad, but then begins to build...I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to spicy stuff though, if you're a fan of spicy then you'll like it!\\n\\nThe jalapeno tarter sauce was delicious! It complimented the regular breading nicely!\\n\\nThere were only 2 things that I wasn't a big fan of:\\n1. The cole slaw-  it is vinegar based. I'm a fan of the mayo based ones. This one wasn't bad, but it's not something that I'm going to crave on a regular basis.\\n2. No doggie bags- I don't really understand why some all you can eat places do this. It's a waste of food! The catfish was in a bowl, on our table, we'd picked thru it and there were probably 5 pieces left. That's tomorrow's lunch that was wasted and thrown away! I'm going to sound like my mother but, there are some poor starving people in *insert impoverished country here*  and here I sit, letting perfectly good food go to waste! \\n\\nSo, a few things to remember: Wednesday and Thursday AYCE Catfish---don't let them bring you out more than you can finish cause it will just get thrown away! The spicy breading isn't really too bad---I'm just a wimp! There are jokes on the receipts, you get the answer after you pay, too cute!!

The maitre d' informed us that we should have booked a table for four and it would be extremely difficult to accommodate us because the restaurant was \\"booked solid\\" until 2. We sheepishly waited while a table was found. Upon entering the dining room, we were surprised to find that the restaurant was only about 2/3 full. It remained that way for the hour we were there. In fact, there were several tables for four that were never occupied during our meal.\\n\\nThe food would probably rate four stars if it weren't for the prices. We thought $10 for a small basket of breads was a lot, although the cornbread was some of the best we've ever had. Dana's mimosa was small and overpriced at $10. She had french toast with mango cream cheese. Good, but a small portion for $14 with no sides. I had an omelet, which was also good but not worth $15. We agreed that J&M Diner in Framingham delivers comparable quality for half the price and includes potatoes, which cost an extra $10 at Maxwell.\\n\\nWe noticed there was no salt and pepper on the table. Upon request the waiter brought the salt in a small dish and offered a few turns of his pepper grinder. The message: Maxwell's food should need no embellishment. Puh-leeze.\\n\\nTotal bill for two entrees, bread, fruit cup and the mimosa: $53 before tip. Next time we'll probably hit J&M."},{"name":"Dragon Gate by Phoenix","address":"3801 N Capital of Texas Hwy, Ste J180","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"We went here for sushi and all left disappointed at spending so much money for food we didn't even enjoy.  We ordered the edamame and Pot Stickers and I really liked the Pot Stickers.  We also ordered some unagi and maguro, which was pretty expensive at $3-3.50/piece, though it was a decent sized piece of fish.  Those tasted ok but the rice was not sticky enough and was falling apart and it took FOREVER to get them.  It also took forever to get the rest of our food, even though we only ordered 2 rolls and some pork fried rice.  \\n\\nThe rolls were gross.  We ordered the 360 Roll and I can't remember the name of the other one, but it was about $15.  One was totally disgusting.  It had some sort of herb that left a really nasty aftertaste and a whole baby carrot in it.  The other roll wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good either.  We didn't like either one of them enough to finish them or take the leftovers home, which says a lot for me considering I hate to waste food I paid for.  We also ordered the Avo Bake and that tasted fine.\\n\\nOverall, I would say the cooked food was good and worth the pricing, the individual sushi was ok but not worth the price, and the rolls were not something I'd ever try again there.

I wish the menu, particularly on the breakfast side, was a little deeper and a little more varied, especially compared to some of the other popular breakfast spots around the city like West Egg, Rise and Dine, Buttermilk Kitchen and the like.  The oatmeal pancakes with peach were not memorable, the peaches tasted canned with syrup.  The biscuit was a bit hard on the outside and not very fluffy, but the apple butter makes up for it.

I just think for that much money you shouldn't be craving a second sandwich when you're done... and a little presentation wouldn't have killed them either. It was a sandwich on a plate with a cherry tomato cut in half and a few wilted greens. Come on, now...\\n\\nThe other thing that irked me was the price of the salad bar. TWELVE DOLLARS. Really? For two kinds of greens and a handful of sides? It was hopelessly average and definitely not worth half of what they charge. I would comfortably pay $5.99 for it a la carte and $3.99 with a sandwich or meal. Twelve dollars? Seriously, get over yourselves.\\n\\n2. The server was pleasant but inattentive. We asked for coffee with our dessert. Dessert was delivered then we waited ten minutes for tepid coffee for which we were charged $3 and not offered a refill.\\n\\n3. For what they charge for a margarita, they need to leave the sour mix under the counter and use fresh (and PROPER) ingredients. Lime juice, tequila, triple-sec... not that difficult. And serving it in a margarita glass instead of the first one the bartender grabs would also raise the appeal and the value.\\n\\nThe only thing this place has going for it is the atmosphere. Its waterfront location makes for a nice view while you contemplate where you're going to grab a bite after dinner."},{"name":"Kesone Thai Lao Bistro","address":"2600 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"THEY DO NOT ACCEPT THE ENTERTAINMENT BOOK COUPON\\n\\nI was really excited to try this place out, but didn't even get in the door...\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I have been surfing the Entertainment Book lately, and Kesone was next on our list.

Whew! \\n\\nI would give this place 3.5 stars if possible. \\n\\nLet's start with the good. Location and parking are convenient for all the local Newton dwellers. This is really filling a void for Newton. They have a very big and comfortably swanky bar setting with a few TVs to enjoy the games. They also have a good sized comfortable dining area. I am really hoping they open up an outdoor patio soon as it looks like this may be in the works! It's currently like a cross over between Blue on Highland and the Biltmore. A comfortable medium which we currently don't really have. \\n \\nThe best part about our meals was the food, which is what it should be! We started with the cheese plate which was really good. It featured a brie, goat cheese and blue cheese that all had really great flavors. The only downfall here was that we had to flag down our server to explain the selections as the plate was merely dumped on us by a food runner.  After the appetizer we had the Chopped Salad with Grilled Chicken which was excellent. It was packed full of vegetables and chick peas. The balsamic dressing was light and really didn't overpower all the different components. We also had the grilled salmon which was AWESOME. I am a little bit of a salmon snob and they really nailed this dish. The fish was cooked perfectly! The brown rice medley was unbelievable when paired with the smokey sauce and asparagus. We ended our meal with the creme brulee which was also extremely well done. The custard was really delicious and the top was perfectly caramelized. \\n\\nTheir bar has a really nice listing of house cocktails, an excellent selection of wines and a nice draft list including Pretty Things for $6!\\n\\n\\n\\nNow for the 2 main problems:\\n\\nService - Please note that we visited Jonathan on a Monday evening and it was not busy at all. We had 5 different people visit our table throughout the evening. Between management, food runners, servers, etc. there was no cohesiveness to the process. We waited to be greeted for far to long and our drinks were often empty. Our menus were never collected after our order was placed. Our empty dishes sat uncollected. The surrounding tables complained to management about their food. Food runners were literally going from table to table with the same dish trying to find out who it belonged to. For the amount of waitstaff and management it was unforgivably discombobulated and slow. \\n\\n\\nBread - The house bread is EXTREMELY hard and not very good. They also served large toasted and buttered portions of this bread with our cheese plate. It was messy and unpleasant to chew. The burgers actually looked delicious but I noticed that many of the plates heading back to the kitchen had large portions of the Brioche rolls still left on them. This point may indeed be a personal preference but I didn't want to order the burgers because of this. I can't stand eating a huge roll on a burger. It takes away so much from the flavor. \\n\\n \\nThe service and bread or easy things that could be ironed out with growing pains. \\nI will definitely be going back to try Jonathan's again and will update this review.

Well, let me share the positive of the place, the bartender (Angel) was super nice, friendly and provided great customer service; the space inside is clean, d√©cor goes really well with the theme of the restaurant.  They have pool tables, dance floor and a full bar.  At first when you walk in, there are no signs of \\"wait to be seated or seat yourself\\"  it can be kind of confusing.

I could not understand what was going on, I know for a fact they knew we were the ones playing the music as they kept staring at us.  So when we are getting ready to start game two, I placed a second round of music (TouchTunes), once again they come to the jukebox and skip our paid music selection.  At this point we called the manager and asked him what was going on, he said that the music we were playing didn't go with the theme of the place and he just skipped the selection.  Please note I am paying for the music, there are no apologies or notice prior to remove the music I have paid for.  The manager tried to dismiss me with the \\"I'll take care of your tab\\" we told him we did not needed for him to pick up our tab.  Money here was not the issue, the issue was that we paid for a service and we did not get to enjoy in addition the way it was handled was very poor.  \\n\\nHe kept saying the music was not for the place (please note: the music I selected was Jimmy Buffet, Paul McCartney, Kanye West and Phil Collins among others).  I told him it was his responsibility to update the music selection for the establishment and it was available to be played and that is why I played it.  He simply said he had no time to do that.\\n\\nWell, let me share this, the restaurant is located in a very DIVERSE area, near the entrance of theme parks and with hotels and shopping centers nearby.

We made a reservation for 7:30, arrived on time and were seated immediately by a very friendly hostess. The ambiance is decent; lots of vintage train memorabilia, dimly lit and very spacious. We waited over ten minutes for the waitress, but apparently they were pretty understaffed (reading the other reviews, it seems like this is quite common) because the hostess had to come take our drink orders. After another eight minutes or so, our waitress came and we ordered appetizers of bacon wrapped scallops and onion rings which came out in a timely fashion and were quite good. The scallops are topped with a maple drizzle that was maybe a bit too sweet, but they were still delicious. After ordering our entrees, it took easily over a half hour for the waitress to bring them to our table. They were not cold, but the wait was definitely obnoxious. I had the pork tenderloin which was good, but nothing incredible. I wish they had an option for regular mashed potatoes, as the garlic mashed didn't impress me. I really liked the salad bar option, but other than that and the scallops, it wasn't anything outstanding. Oh, and my daughter really loved her grilled cheese, if that counts...Honestly, I might have given them four stars if it hadn't been for the incredibly slow service.

The restaurant is located in a trendy LGBTQI area and dog friendly section of midtown. The streets are all super nice/clean with many bars and clubs in the area. When we were seated, I ordered the Salmon scramble with a side of saut√©ed spinach and it was amazing!  I can't exactly remember the sauce/cream that came with it, but the whole thing was AMAZING. The salmon is made already scrambled into the eggs (you can request egg whites) and served with grits and a biscuit. The grits was tasty with a nice creamy consistency.

Shared the Filet Trio and the Lobster Mac And Cheese.\\n\\nQuality\\nThe menu at Provisions & Buzz is pretty eclectic with lots of options across the board. I asked the waiter for his recommendations and he highly suggested the steaks, so we decided to order the Filet Trio. Three petit steaks served in three different ways, King Crab Oscar Style, Blue Cheese Butter, and Chimichurri, it was a tasty dish. The steaks were very tender, cooked properly, and had lots of flavor. I personally found the Chimichurri the best of the three as the Blue Cheese Butter was a bit too rich, and the crab from the Oscar Style was a bit distracting from the steak itself. The Lobster Mac And Cheese was a good choice as a side dish, but it is massive enough to be its own entree. It did not come served like a typically mac and cheese side in a skillet, instead it was in its own bowl presented like a pasta dish. Penne pasta, not overwhelmed by cheese and lots of large lobster chunks made it a solid dish.\\n\\nQuantity\\nWe decided to embrace the assorted styles of steaks rather than go for a larger steak option and I was happy with that decision. The Lobster Mac And Cheese meanwhile is a huge dish with more than enough for multiple people to share, or one person to devour as a full meal.\\n\\nValue\\nI definitely felt that some of the prices on the menu were much too high. While there were plenty of options for affordable dishes, the better sounding options tended to be higher than expected. The steaks in particular seemed closer to high-end steakhouse prices, which did not seem appropriate, even though they were enjoyable. \\n\\nAmbiance\\nProvisions & Buzz is located in the Baldwin Park area of Orlando. Located in a strip of restaurants and stores in a mini-downtown, Provisions & Buzz stands out as a hip bistro and bar. They have several tables outside with building covering, but the majority of seating is inside. The focus is around the centralized bar, but they have plenty of tables surrounding it. The decor inside is simple and modern. The bar has a few televisions, but is set up more as a place to socialize than to watch a game. In the background popular hit music was playing and everyone seemed to be having a good time.\\n\\nCrowd\\nWith so many other places closed, Provisions & Buzz capitalized on a crowd still looking for food and some drinks. The bar area was packed with people hanging out. It seemed like people who knew each other from the community, so it had a local focus. Outside many of the tables were also taken up by local folks who were out with their dogs. It is tough to say if it is always a hot spot on weekend nights or if the circumstances greatly influenced the crowd.\\n\\nService\\nOur server was very friendly and had the food out to us very quickly. The manager seemed very nice and was going around making sure people had all their preparations for the hurricane. It is nice to see people that cared about the patrons as well as the staff who all seemed to live nearby.\\n\\nParking\\nThe downtown area of Baldwin Park has lots of street parking available as well as several public lots. It is at the center of a residential community so even if you have to venture a few blocks out there is still plenty of parking to be found.\\n\\nExtra\\nProvisions & Buzz gets an extra bump from me because they stayed open when many other places were shutting down. Good food and hospitable service make it a very good restaurant. Just look out for specials because the food is a bit expensive. Definitely a good option in this area of Orlando."},{"name":"Sun in My Belly","address":"2161 College Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We used Sun in My Belly to cater our wedding.

Pizza","address":"3980 Broadway","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"I've had worse pizza, but it's come out of the freezer. These guys try, and they certainly have the tools and ingredients on hand, but it's just off enough that I give them 1 instead of 3-4 stars for the food. The crust was just a bit over-baked so it was crunchy rather than crispy and the veggies were sliced so thin that they were dried out. \\n\\nBut that's not my big bitch here: the world is full of half-assed pizza. \\n\\nWe ordered take out because we had a BBQ emergency. The Pyrex pan in which I was roasting my poblanos rellenos exploded in the Weber, sending glass shards throughout the meal. Thank god the lid was down. With the guests hungrily sitting around the only option was more wine and takeout pizza. We debated for about 10 seconds whether to order Protos, the pricey NoBo standard, or try O's in the neighborhood we'd just moved in to. O's it was.\\n\\nMy first reaction when I walked in was to think, \\"this place is a dump\\". Now, anyone who's patronized small local pizza joints know that that could be a good thing or a bad thing, so I didn't walk out. My pizzas weren't quite ready so I sat back and observed. The pizza counter was covered in flour and little bits of stuff: not a good sign. Even busy pizza joints keep their work space clean and this place, on Friday night at 8:00, was definitely not busy. There appeared to be one person on staff and she was quite cheery as she tossed a pizza dough frisbee around with two admiring teenage boys. Across the counter it went, on to the floor in the customer waiting area where it was picked up and spun back by one of her admirers. Oops! He missed and it landed on the nest of condiment bins next to the pizza counter. At least the lids were on the bins.\\n\\nBack and forth went the dough frisbee until my pizzas were ready. She peeled them out of the Blodgett, tossed them on the counter with the flour and bits, sliced them and put them into pizza boxes and handed them to me, proud of her ability to multi-task.\\n\\nI should have refused them but my guests and I were hungry so I said \\"thank you\\" and walked out, never to return.\\n\\nI'm sorry, I would have like to have a decent pizza joint a couple of blocks from my home."},{"name":"Coach's Bar & Grill","address":"10162 SW Park Way","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Hands down, favorite bar.

I ordered the eggplant pizza with pistachio pesto sauce, gluten free, and vegan.  My husband ordered a basic cheese pizza.  We were both VERY impressed with the quality of ingredients and flavors.  We Oooh'd and Aaah'd through every bight.  The GF crust is nothing special, but it serves as a suitable base for the wonderful textures and flavors on top of the pizza.  The pistachio pesto was amazing and soaked slightly into the crust which made it flavor rich.  Note that they advertise the GF option as being a personal size, but we found it to be equally as big as the regular pizza and definitely big enough for two people.  The vegan ice cream was good; I sampled the chai flavor.  However, I decided not to order any because most of the flavors were fruity and I like chocolate and nuts in my ice cream flavors.  We ordered the avocado corn salad which came generously sized and smothered in a creamy vegan dressing.  I would suggest that they replace the strawberries in that salad with cherry tomatoes, as I think it would work better, but other than that it was very good.  One last suggestion I would have for restaurant wait staff is to leave the napkins on the table until guests have left.  They came and cleared plates and napkins when we appeared to be done eating, but though we were done eating, we still would have liked to wipe our hands on our napkins before leaving.  There were no self serve napkin dispensers so we ran to the bathroom to wash up.

Sure the place looks nice but the employer/employees gave such a bad vibe, almost like they hate their job and are only forced to be there. We were seated and we literally asked for ice water 5 times!! We even had to get up from our chair to the bar and ask again. To top it off, it wasn't even busy. Also, this place has no coordination, communication, or an organized system on where food orders go. An employee dropped off a platter that was $50 and with everyone ordering different things, I trusted that they knew what was ours - NOPE. They noticed they screwed up and later told us it wasn't ours. At that moment, when we barely touched it, why didn't they take it away from us? Instead the chick kept eyeing us like she was making sure we finished the platter so she could charge us. Why should we pay for their employees mistake? If they wanted money out of it, the employee that dropped it off should pay! I'm so disgusted with this restaurant. Maybe they should get some better trained employees and staff that actually know how to \\"smile\\" and engage their customers. Honestly don't think this place will last at all. With that said, I give 1 star for good ice water.\\n\\n----------------------------------\\nReply \\n\\nDear Ms. Connie M. Sad to say, but I am not misleading the public as you can see you a majority of the reviews here are about your guys service. Also it's hard for me to believe that the restaurant was full as we were seated at the bar area with approx. 6 parties seated. Maybe it was busy at the back but that shouldn't be an excuse for neglecting your other customers. So you guys separated the tables into two, great. So what? Still couldn't get the orders right after writing the entire list down? And yes, the person to your left said, \\"wow\\" because her and her bf came late not knowing what was ordered. Others at the table kept pointing at what they wanted, so why should I keep track. You guys have the pen and paper. Point is, the restaurant is disorganized and communication between staff and employer is lacking. \\n\\nThe platter wasn't taken away from us NOT BECAUSE you knew we enjoyed it, it wasn't taken away from us cause you knew someone had to pay for it. And I'm going to correct you on this, \\"OFFERED YOU 50% DISCOUNT. THAT IS WHAT I CALL GOOD SERVICE.\\" Yes, you offered the 50% discount after we fought about it. At the time of paying the bill, no discount was given whatsoever. After arguing about your guy's mistake, your first offer was 10%. Then finally with approval with the supervisor, he agreed with 50%. Fighting for what is right, doesn't determine good service at all. I've worked in the food industry for at least 7 years and I know when an order goes wrong and it has been touched, we don't charge at all and make a new order. Sure, as employees we get in a lot of trouble, but we're all human. \\n\\nI'm not blind either if that's what your implying. There were eyes looking over from the bar at our table to see if the platter was empty. Also this table 43, that's not my business to care if they were nice or not. Good for them, they saved $50. \\n\\nTo make it clear, I never said the food was bad; all I'm stating is that the customer service needs more work, as it isn't very inviting, wait times for beverages are longer than it should be, no one clears off tables and lastly no one asks us if we need anything. \\n\\nAgain, EVERYONE...this is the real story.\\n\\n\\nAlso, what does my full name have to do with anything? So you can creep on social media? We're all here to write our thoughts and opinions about our experience at everyone's restaurant, store, etc. That's what Yelp is for right?

The fireplace in the middle of the table seems particularly dangerous, but no one seemed concerned. It added a very fun, young, edgy vibe and I liked it. Greg warned me this was not the type of place to go to the bathroom at.

I just presumed it wouldn't be vegan friendly and I feel like pasta is something I can easily make at home on the cheap. I did my research before we went for dinner, thanks to a comprehensive online allergen menu (thank you, technology!). I ordered oil & vinegar with my bread, minestrone soup, and angel hair pomodoro, minus the romano cheese. The bread is absolutely heaven. I could probably be happy just sitting there eating a loaf with oil & vinegar. When the minestrone soup arrived, I just then thought to ask the waiter what kind of broth it had since I realized that only seafood had been on the allergen menu. The waiter said it was chicken broth. He returned about 5 minutes later and apologized, stating that it was vegetable broth and was vegetarian. By then my soup was lukewarm, but I didn't really care for it anyway. It was strangely sweet and definitely too salty to me. Next time I will get the house salad with balsamic vinaigrette. My pasta dish was excellent. The sauce was a bit heavier on tomato than I expected from the menu description but had a ton of flavor. I skipped the ice cream that was included in the meal.

Very consistent, since I remember every experience to be very similar.  I've had the misfortune to sit on one of the low cushions for an entire meal, not a very pleasant sensation, considering a King's feast takes at least a couple of hours!  This time I was lucky enough to get seated on the low couch.  Also, realize that dishes are shared and you will be eating with your fingers, unless you request a fork.\\n\\nI have to agree with other yelpers that a flatbread instead of regular bread would be better suited for picking up food, and less filling.  The King's Feast is five courses, and eating bread during the soup and salad will fill you up before the main course arrives.  For the first course, Lentil soup is served in bowls that you sip from.  This is very flavorful!  This along with the bread makes a meal in itself.  Next up is a salad that has lettuce, some type of hummus that has eggplant.  Following the salad, an appetizer of phillo dough stuffed with ground chicken, topped with powdered sugar, a vegetarian version was also provided to our vegetarian members of our party.  This was delicious, but very messy to eat.  Hence the lap towel they provide you with.  After this, we were served plate after plate of the main course.  We had two different types of kabobs, one was chicken and the other was beef.  We had the Tagine of Chicken Honey and Prunes -served with light honey sauce, almonds, prunes and sesame seeds, the Tagine of Chicken with Apricots -served with apricots, apricot sauce and sesame seeds.  Both very sweet and savory.  We had the Couscous Marrakesh - Steamed semolina grains topped with lamb, and seven vegetables.  I didn't care for the lamb in this dish.  I think there was also another dish, but can't remember what it was.  For dessert, we had a bowl of chopped fruit in a sweet sauce along with the hot mint tea that is slightly sweet.  \\n\\nNormally, I don't like my meals to be as sweet as this meal seemed to be, but I enjoyed almost everything I was served.  We were part of a large bachelorette party, and so we were downstairs (I didn't even know they had a downstairs!).  We had a belly dancer come and entertain us, and she coaxed the bride to be to go up and dance with her.  I can't really recommend Marrakesh to everyone because of the low seating, lack of utensils, and sweetness of the meal.

I've tried most of the fancy steakhouses in Boston and this was one of the last ones I haven't been to. First impression: tiny space! We were jam packed in the small dinning quarters and I honestly have no idea how anyone can consider this spot an ideal business dinner location. There's absolutely no privacy as you're basically elbow to elbow with the tables next to you. We had a party of 5 so I was the odd man out sitting at the end of the table in every waiter's way. I have no idea why they placed us right smack in the middle of the room? It would have made more sense to place us at a table by the corner given there would be someone sitting at the end of the table. Oh well.\\n\\nAmbiance: Cozy. Like I said, it's a small space, but it's still nice. That night, it was a packed house on super windy and chilly Friday night so they had the heat blasting so along with the close quarters and packed house, I was sweating.\\n\\nWaiter: He was a Spanish gentleman who was very knowledgeable and had great banter with us. The only thing I did not enjoy was getting showered by his spit as he stood over me to talk to the rest of my table. The caveat of sitting at the end of the table, I guess.\\n\\nFood & Drinks : I was expecting to be blown away with this bread that everyone was raving about but it was just normal warmed bread. It was good, but nothing too amazing. We started off with a dozen oysters, which was decent. Everyone but my cousin ordered some sort of steak. My cousin had the beef wellington, which she also said was okay. I had the rib eye paired with the stuff shrimps. It was also decent. That pretty summed up everyone else's meal. Everything was just okay. We ended with the banana foster and creme brulee for dessert. Can you guess how we felt about those (just ok)? Two of our parties got some sort of martini. Same ruling.\\n\\nOverall, this place was unimpressive. It's just a fancy overpriced steakhouse in a high rent location, really. Food wasn't anything special and I would rather go to Jimmy's  Steer house and spend a fraction of the money I spent here. Just sayin'...moooving on."},{"name":"Gunshow","address":"924 Garrett St, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Simple designed restaurant with great service and food.

I definitely enjoyed my experience here though. Opentable reservations available. Closed Mondays. Ordering style is different for an \\"American (New)\\" restaurant. It resembles dim sum, where you get a menu to look at what's available, but the server brings out the food items and you get to look at it before deciding if you want it or not. There's honestly no real drawbacks to this. I don't believe they circulate food that no one wanted the first time around. So you won't get cold food or anything. It's pretty fun idea and you get to see it before you decide to take it. Sharing plates style. Portions are not huge, hence why it can get pricey. Roughly $15-18 per plate. We ended ordering quite a bit as we wanted to try a lot of things. Total w/ tax and tip = $130. Overall comment, all items were made of very good quality ingredients and prepared with a lot of care.

I've only had this dish couple times before, but this was the best I've had! Not too much batter, well flavored. 4) scallop shrimp - it was sitting in a puddle of broth-like liquid with some other veggie items. It was ok in terms of flavor, but the scallop was really fresh and yummy! 5) green eggs and ham - very well prepared, just that the flavors and combo didn't particularly make me go wow. The poached egg was perfect. 6) pork belly - surprisingly this was my least favorite. The pork belly was good, didn't so much care for the sweet Asian-inspired sauce over it. The sides it came with were very salty. 7) Banana pudding - THE HIGHLIGHT of the meal! Omg this was amazing!!! Not too sweet. Not too rich/heavy. The meringue. The bananas. The custard (I think?).

It was a cold night, the restaurant was almost empty and I arrived with a few colleagues.  The hostess refused to give us a table, claiming that she had reservations for every single seat.  She never asked us for our name, and even after we noticed that other people were arriving, putting in their names and getting seated, she refused to take our name.  At one point, she claimed that she'd seated another group instead of us partly because they were going to eat dinner.  Of course, we'd have been eating dinner if we were sitting down.  Was this because we're faculty members from a nearby college and not very fashionably dressed?  Was it because the two people who were interacting with the hostess were women of color?  I have no idea, but when the manager argued with us that the hostess was not actually mistreating us, the deal was off.  Are we not the customers?\\n\\nAfter a couple of hours we were given a table (I think it'd been vacant the entire time).  Then we had some drinks, which were fine, and some food that was fine.

We got sushi to start (can't go to Japanese without getting sushi!), and it was amazingly fresh and tasty, and the Specialty Rolls were great! We tried a few, and loved them all. The sake list is thorough, and I learned a bit about sake during dinner (there was also a special sake flight that night, which was neat, and yummy). Though I don't typically go for wine with sushi, I realized that it would be easy to do there, as they have a pretty damn good list, and it covers a lot of ranges (both price and profile); and I did get a glass to complement my entree (Sokol Blosser Evolution #9). The dinner entrees were great, too -- the chef seems to be a bit into molecular gastronomy....neat stuff. I had the Sea Bass, and was very happy indeed. My boyfriend had the NY Strip, and even though he is one of the pickiest steak eaters I have ever known, he LOVED it. The desert was awesome too, though it was a special that night, so I won't recommend it, 'cause you can't get it now. Our server, though obviously very busy, was very informative, and very helpful.\\n\\nBecause of that wonderful experience, I have eaten there many times since. I have yet to be let down. The sushi is always amazing -- check out weekends especially, when they usually get in specialty fish. The Cold Tastings are some of my favorites. Tuesdays ROCK for 'tinis.

I was so glad to find Parkgrounds! I've been twice with my dog, and I plan to keep coming back. It's a great option for a dog park, because dog park + coffee = awesome. I've come only on Mondays during the day, and there's always been enough parking on the street. \\n\\nOn the dog park side of things: I noticed that there are a few regulars who come to the park with their dogs, but I did not notice any pack mentality between the dogs. Everyone kept a good eye on their dogs and would intervene if needed. Everyone was very understanding and helpful with the other dogs and notified one another of any problems or concerns. One lady noticed a scratch on a dog that wasn't hers and found the dog's owner to tell him. I've seen 3-12 dogs there at a time. \\n\\nThere are benches and tables and chairs out in the dog park, too, which is nice for the owners. There are trash cans and poop bags for everyone to use, and there's a spigot and two large bowls for water for the dogs. I've refilled them myself before, because with all the dogs around, the water can get dirty. \\n\\nThe ground in the dog park is a lot of dirt, and now that it's fall, there are a lot of leaves. Be aware that your dog will likely get dirty, so being a clean up towel or something for your dog to sit on on the way home if you need to. My dog has short hair, and I haven't had a problem, but I've seen vey hairy and fluffy dogs get covered in leaves and some mud. \\n\\nThe coffee shop side of things: There's an outdoor porch separated from the dog park by wooden gates where you can be out in the elements but still away from the dogs. Inside the coffee shop building itself, it's all pretty standard as far as a coffee shop goes. I've had friendly interactions with 3/4 of the staff I've been in touch with. I'm no coffee connoisseur, and I've enjoyed the cafe au lates I've had and the challah French toast. There are tables, a bar, and chairs to sit at. There are books to read. \\n\\nThere is booze to drink. I think the booze and the dog park help Parkgrounds stand out among the other coffee shops around town. Being a dog owner, I come for the dog park, and I'd recommend anyone else to do the same. \\n\\nI noticed one reviewer mention the dog poop at the park being so close to your food. Dog people probably won't mind, honestly; that's how my own apartment is every once in a while. If the animals offend you, stay inside the building. In Korean dog cafes, the dogs and humans and cafe are all in one room ~together~ which I really enjoyed, so I definitely have no qualms with dogs nearby, and I doubt most dog people would, either."},{"name":"Marrakesh Mediterranean Kitchen","address":"675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Ste N 141","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"It's so good!!!

It's like being the judge on a cooking show -- without having to actually tell someone you hate their food.\\n\\nOn a recent visit, my wife and I were blown away by some of the selections, lukewarm on a few others. If they're on the menu when you drop by, don't pass on the amazing Wagyu Beef Brisket Enchiladas -- smoky and delicious, they were the highlight of our meal. The desserts are also outstanding -- we shared a Banana Pudding that set a new standard for the dish. There's also a great list of cocktails and a healthy selection of local craft brews available in bottles.\\n\\nA few tips -- if you pass on a plate when it's offered, you won't see it again. So review the menu carefully when you arrive (and check out what your neighbors are eating), so you can decide on a dish as soon as it comes around. And while the food is upscale, the place is super casual, with long communal tables that put you elbow-to-elbow with strangers.

My sister and I started with a Naruto maki ( appetizer roll). This was the best one but the cucumber weren't neatly wrapped nor consistent. It was really hard to eat and falling apart on the plate. Then, we ordered three rolls (volcano, smoked salmon and cream cheese, and the basic california roll). Thinking you really can't go wrong with these basic rolls, think again. The california roll was basked in sesame seeds in a thick layer. We didn't care for the smoked salmon roll and sent it back after one bite and ordered the Seaworld roll instead (fried lobster, eel, and sauce). This is also a mistake. There were barely any lobster and what's in there was soggy along with the batter.

This was a joint celebration, as he had accepted a new position in Miami & was moving in a few days, & my wife's & my birthday are the 23rd & 24th of January. We were having an early celebration, as I currently live and work in NYC, she in Boston, & I will be in Dallas on business the weekend of our birthdays.  I greatly enjoy steak houses & have eaten numerous times at Morton's, Ruth's Chris and Abe & Louie's in Boston, both personal & for business. I had never been to Grill 23 before & actually recommended it to my friend to have the celebration there, as I heard it had fantastic food.\\n\\nWe arrived at the table at 8:40pm. Our waiter came by twice & at 9:00pm, he finally took our drink order, which is a long time to wait to get a drink. I was actually getting up to go to the bar when he finally came. I explained to him that we wanted to have a separate bill, as we needed to leave earlier than the rest of our party because we had other plans for later that night to celebrate our birthdays with family & other friends.  He asked me if I was sure, as the rest of the table had only ordered a few drinks & 4 appetizers. I'm not sure why he felt the need to ask me & I reiterated that I would like a separate bill because we were going to leave soon & I had no idea how long the other table members were going to be.  He looked annoyed & stormed off, enough so that both my wife & two of my friends openly voiced what was the matter with him.\\n\\nA little after that, at 9:05, we were moved to another table as we had a disabled woman joining our group & the table we were at was ill equipped to handle all of us. At 9:20, a new waiter was assigned to us & she came over to take our drink order. Not only did the original waiter not put in our drink order @ 9, he passed onto this new waitress the wrong drink order! I asked her if the original waiter had also told her that we wanted a separate bill, as we needed to leave by 10:30 at the latest.  She said no, but that when the bill came she could help us \\"figure it out\\". Was this a subtle insult to insinuate that I didn't know how to do math? At this point I am mildly annoyed with my wife on the way. When the drinks came 10 minutes later, THEY WERE STILL THE WRONG DRINKS, from the original wrong order! What is going on here? Now I am really aggravated. It's been nearly an hour & we just received our first, wrong drinks.\\n\\nSeveral people at our table tried & somehow failed to get her attention, as we were all ready to order, even though we were missing two members of our group (the disabled lady & her health aide). But we told our waitress that she had told us to order because she wasn't sure when she was going to arrive as the T-Shuttle was running late.\\n\\nFINALLY, 35 minutes later at 10:05pm, she came by to take our order. We were starving & placed our order. At this point, I had already had to call our next place & explain that we were going to be late for our v.i.p. table, not including the fact that I still had 3 other people to pick up in Brighton & Cambridge.\\n\\nThe food came at 10:30. BOTH of our steaks were cooked wrong. This was the icing on the top. I had ordered the Steak au Poivre medium rare with a side of mushroom pesto & my wife ordered the Dry Aged New York 12oz medium. My steak came out medium & her's came out medium well. When I'm paying $35 & $50 a steak, I expect it to come out right. If not, then the problem to be alleviated.\\n\\nAfter a few minutes I was able to wave over our waitress. I explained to her the situation. \\"Well, I'm not sure what we can do for you\\". Seriously??? \\"We can cook you another one, but it'll be another 20-25 minutes\\". We had absolutely no time for this. I told her that the least she could do was to get me a drink on the house. My wife ended up eating my steak & I barely touched mine. The waitress brought me my drink. During this whole time, not a single manager came over to discuss or help resolve the issue. Is this what the service is supposed to be like at Grill 23? I asked for our bill as my wife finished. She charged me the supposed \\"free\\" drink. When I questioned her about it, she looked at me like I was speaking nonsense & asked me if I was sure. Can you believe that?? It's right there, I ordered 2 & the 3rd was supposed to be on the house. I'm getting charged for 3.Then with an attitude, she took the bill & stormed off. I was fed up. With the final bill, it said 3 drinks with the price adjustment on the bottom for subtracting 1 drink. So she hadn't even subtracted it!\\n\\nThis was a ridiculous night with unbelievably horrendous service. Part of the reason you pay premium prices is not only for the food, but for the service that goes along with it.

The flavor is more intense than regular cheese curds and the fries are crispier than traditionally found in \\"authentic\\" poutine.

I also thought the service was good, but being a first timer I would have liked more suggestions or help with ordering. I would suggest placing menus where the line begins to help. While we where seated I heard the cashier offer a first time customer free hummus to try and he seemed much more helpful with them. We didn't get the same first timer treatment.

Roast chicken sandwich is served on bread that is tough and chewy (had to wrestle with it with a knife to cut through), side salad is a little depressing with its unbalanced, overly-acidic dressing, bitter wilted greens and blah tomatoes. (Are unripe roma tomatoes really the best choice for a salad?) I don't usually flinch at paying $14 for a lunch sandwich, but I don't feel like I'd want to do it again here. The dinner service isn't much better -- the chowder is lovely, but the pastas are tasteless (they're massive though, so if you like eating a giant bowl of boring, then by all means). \\n\\nThe service has not been great either -- apart from the one time when a server chatted with me about the podcast I was listening to, servers have typically been inattentive. Once, it took 10 minutes to get a menu, another time, it took forever to get utensils. They also seem to close the restaurant arbitrarily (or maybe I have bad timing?). I reserved a table for 10 on my birthday two weeks before the fact, and they called the day before to cancel on me because they booked the place for a movie shoot -- I get it, schedules change, but I wish they had called me earlier. It's not exactly fun to reschedule a party of 10 people with one day's notice (big shoutout to Michel and his team at The Abbey a little ways down the street who went out of their way to make things special for us that evening --  I am a customer for life). To be fair, it was nice that on Valentine's Day, Danica's was obscure enough that it had room for a last minute booking.\\n\\nI will say this: The coffee is great.

The first thing about this plate was the toast. The toast was extremely overdone crispy hard. Uneatable.   The crab omelet looked good but tasted like a buttery accident-  the crab meat was shredded and had a extreme buttery taste that over powered any tasted of crab or egg from the omelette.  There was few tomatoes too be seen in the omelette - also the breakfast potatoes were well seasoned but also hard and over fried.

There's a lot neon behind the well-stocked bar, and to the bleary-eyed or double-visioned, it almost looks like a carnival. Whatever it is, it's fun, cheap, and deeply satisfying. A decent burger for less than $10 with two thin, juicy patties in a soft bun is the only meal worth getting (though the veggie burger is not terrible, if you have friends of that ... persuasion.) I am hopelessly addicted to waffle fries and Charlie's don't fail although they might come to the table a bit cold.\\n\\nThe beer list is above-average with your usual seasonal standards and perhaps something fun on tap; this past winter, the list was heavy on porters and stouts.

Never having been to Turkey myself, I can't comment upon the authenticity of his d√∂ner, I can only say that the lamb and beef version is saucy and delicious. The d√∂ner (or gyro or whatever you want to call it) here is unlike any I've had before. The flatbread isn't thick and bready like in Western Europe; on the contrary it's quite thin, totally unleavened and, after a turn in the panini press, somewhat crunchy. Apparently it's known as d√ºr√ºm.  There's some vegetables, mostly iceberg mix and tomatoes, and a lot of sauce. The \\"spicy\\" sauce is, as I've come to expect from western d√∂ner renditions, not really very spicy, more just wet and slightly earthy. The yogurt sauce is the real star of the show, tangy, tart and cool, the sandwich is both bathed in it and proudly topped with a generous dollop as if to say \\"bite it, heart.\\" I can really only recommend the Lamb version, I have to agree with other reviewers that the chicken is distinctly unexciting, and a little salty. \\nFortunately the Iskender plate is also successful. A bunch of crackered up flatbread is spread on a plate, then baked with red sauce and d√∂ner meat. Topped, of course, with the familiar yogurt sauce, it's a satisfying meal for one. Better still is the housemade Baklava. Better than most (maybe all?) in the Portland area it suffers from none of the soggy, collapsed, \\"all of a mass\\" quality that plagues most area Baklava.\\nHonestly, considering the chicken, it's a four star, but considering the graciousness of the proprietor and the amount of negative press it's gotten here on Yelp, I'm giving it five to, as I say, even out the hate."},{"name":"Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse","address":"930 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I'll start by saying  most of the meats were terrific.

We waited 55 minutes for our first course, and then another 35 minutes between course 2 and 3. The main course came to us almost 2 hours after we placed our order.  As far as course 4, the server incorrectly told us that there was only fried icecream left -  another grouponer did got the menu and ordered sticky rice dessert (good sticky rice dessert - which they allegedly have, according to yelp reviewers -  was the main reason we actually got the groupon!!).  Also, the server took my groupon when I ordered and wouldn't give it back, which was weird - in retrospect maybe she did that so we wouldn't leave...? It was unprofessional and not how you run a business.  I think they were so unprepared for the full house (again, why sell this many groupons when you know you have 3 people working there, including the chef, and only 15 tables?? why set yourself - and the rest of us - up for this??) that they did the best they could do.  THEY REALLY NEED TO TAKE A COURSE IN PROPER ETIQUETTE IN RUNNING A RESTAURANT.  If you have people wait 55 minutes for 6 little pieces of fried sampling and then another 55 minutes for their main course to come, you might want to offer your customers a free glass of wine or something to help smooth over the situation.  I was a good customer, I grew up in restaurants (family biz) and I patiently waited, knowing they were doing the best they could, but the kicker for me was when the server came over with a bill, wanting \\"only $10\\" for the rice, which wasn't included in the groupon?, and the second dessert I ordered.

Some swear by Grill 23 as the City's best steakhouse.  I don't know about Boston, but from a Florida sunshine point of view, it compares favorably with the steakhouses we imported from New York to South Florida.  My New York Strip was well charred and served medium-rare to my liking.  The steak was favorful and the upcharged peppercorn sauce a perfect compliment.  I would have preferred my steak to be served on its own plate as the sauce and juices corrupted the garnishes and visa versa.  The sides were terrific.  We shared six sides:  roasted brussel sprouts with pancetta, truffled tater tots, wild mushrooms, grilled asparagus, mashed potatoes and a broiled cauliflour casserole.  All the sides were excellent but when we left it was the truffled tater tots and brussel sprouts which our party was complimenting.  Grill 23 has an above-average wine list with a robust dessert menu.  House-made sorbets, ice creams, creme brul√®e, bread pudding, chocolate cake were some if our good choices.  I definitely recommend.  The service was very good.  The waiters are not the high steak experts you find at New York Prime, The Palm or Abe & Louies but the crew was attentive and quick.

This tiny restaurant on the outskirts of Central Square is a real gem.  It's pricey for sure - entrees are in the $30 range - but it's worth it for a special occasion - like a first wedding anniversary which is why my wife and I went there this weekend.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is intimate - it's a small restaurant with about a dozen tables and waitstaff buzzing around from place to place.  The service was attentive.  We were promptly seated, promptly given bread and water, and our waiter, Andrew, was helpful and informative - and gave us a very solid wine recommendation.  The dress is on the more formal side.  If you're a guy and you're not wearing a collared shirt, you will feel out of place.  Polo okay in the summer.\\n\\nAfter we ordered we were presented with an amuse-bouche - a warm corn soup with a piece of sturgeon in it.  Very tasty.\\n\\nThe meal began with two appetizers - a pear and greens salad (pear and mache) and a rabbit stew.  The pear and greens salad was a great starter - served cold.  It was tasty and not too sweet and came with some great goat's milk cheese.  The rabbit stew was very savory and flavorful - I haven't had rabbit in a long while and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  There was some liver in  there too - not my favorite but still good.  Of the two appetizers, I'd probably recommend the pear salad over the stew.\\n\\nFor the entree, my wife and I split the duck special for two.  It was huge, impressive, and tasted GREAT.  The waiter cuts the duck up for you, so that much of it is boneless (the legs are still in there).  The skin is crunchy and slightly sweet.  The meat itself is rich and tender.  Really impressive.  A wonderful centerpiece dish.\\n\\nOur waiter recommended a particular bottle of wine from the Tandem winery in Sonoma - it was great.  The wine list is kind of pricey here - $50 for your cheapest bottle of red.  The Tandem was $60.  I don't love it when wine prices are so jacked up but at least the tandem was good.  You could save some money by ordering a couple of beers.  I saw a number of folks doing this.\\n\\nFor dessert, we split the lemon soufflee.  It was light and wonderful, and came with a side of some sour lemon ice cream which was okay but missed the mark a little.  Too sour.  Almost tasted a little bad.  (My wife disagrees.  She doesn't think it was too sour.)  But overall, a top notch dessert.  Berries come on the side.  THREE berries, to be exact.\\n\\nWe finished off the night with some cappuccinos which were expertly made by Andrew who told us he had learned to make cappuccinos in Italy.

Its just a classic coffee joint and I would recommend it to anyone that just wants to get a good beverage without having to wait for the guy in front of them to order his tall iced latte in a grande cup with extra ice, 3 pumps hazelnut, 2 pumps classic, an inch of non-fat milk, with a dome lid and a venti straw... yeah, I don't think you will hear that in Papaccino's... but if you did, I'm sure they would do their best to make their variation, with a smile :)   I personally think the coffee is WAY better here than BarfBucks signature burnt to sh*t roast anyway.."},{"name":"Petit Robert Bistro","address":"480 Columbus Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Love this bistro.

If you don't like bread dipped in melted cheese I don't know what you like. Our last waitress said she didn't like cheese, so naturally we couldn't trust anything she said. She gave us the recommendations of people who did eat cheese (her coworkers) and said we should absolutely not get the guinness cheddar. Got one of each anyway, loved both - what could be wrong about beer + cheese? They also had a guinness \\" meal pairing\\" which was just Guinness, Guinness Extra Stout and Guinness again... The manager said he was trying to do cooler things with the beer menu. That would be good.\\n\\nAfter the cheese course everything else is less exciting for me. Chocolate course is always good, although we couldn't get the turtle with the St. Patty's Day special which is my fave. Entree/meat course is always kind of a wash. I'd rather have a steak (I know, you can order off the menu, but that's never an option for the prix fixe meals.) \\n\\nOn this particular occasion our waitress was comically slow, especially for a non-busy Thursday night. She was very nice, but our coq au vin broth boiled for at least 15 minutes before our actual food showed up, and then she poured non-hot coq au vin in the boiling stuff to give us more liquid so we had to continue to wait. Dessert was also a long wait. Getting and paying for the checks took forever. Thought about just walking out multiple times, but we aren't scrubs like that. Sadly most of my friends didn't tip very well that night...

Okay well, I actually was hungry but I was also deathly afraid of what I might do to a pizza that size.\\n\\nSo, we shared mussels instead, and a salad. The mussels were delicious. Plump, juicy in a spicy fra diavlo type of base (not really broth, much thicker). And the watermelon salad was the perfect dish to pair with the spice of the mussels.

Yen Ha offers pretty much standard Vietnamese fare with an overwhelming number of options to chose from.  I've had some hit or miss meals but that's part of the fun of exploring the menu.  The pleasant surprises include spare ribs, clams, fresh crab, an odd banana porridge which is kind of addictive (desert/drink menu) and the sizzling seafood platter. The misses include orange glazed fried shrimp which was disgusting but maybe that's just me. The best option however is the pepper salted squid.  That's right up there with \\"last meal on earth\\" kind of stuff. The place to go for pepper salted squid used to be Thien Hong but I'm thinking Yen Ha kidnapped the cook and has him tied up in back. This dish alone is worth a visit. \\n\\nNow back to the story: the servers.  I've been coming here for a while and the service is either spectacular or \\"grab the little shit by the throat and strangle him\\" bad.  \\n\\nThere's a Vietnamese gentleman around 45 years of age who is the Superman of waiters.  This guy only has one gear. He doesn't walk, he runs from table to table.  He is always smiling and is perhaps the most helpful waiter I've ever encountered.  He doesn't let anything stand in his way of providing excellent service.  He may not speak English very well but he is the fucking man.  If he's serving you the service is 5 stars.\\n\\nThen there's young man about the age of 20 who has elevated \\"not giving a shit\\" to an art form.  He only has one gear as well, and its \\"super mother fucking slow.\\" He'll randomly show up to your table and stand there as though to entice you to order.  If you fall for that trick however he's liable to interrupt you with \\"hold on a second\\" while he walks away.  His service isn't worth 1 star.\\n\\nLast time we were in I watched a very polite mother with her young child place an order to go.  After 30 minutes (in which time we had our food despite arriving at the same time) this woman flagged down Mr. Not Give a Shit and asked if she could pay...you know, just to speed things up.  About 10 minutes later I commented to my gf that \\"she's about lose her shit.\\"  Within a couple of minutes she proved my Nostradamus abilities by starting to demand her money back.  Mr. Not Give a Shit just ignored her and I started to worry about his life (actually I didn't give a shit either). \\n\\nRight about that time my man walks into the restaurant (he was clearly just starting his shift), takes his jacket off and immediately senses there is a customer in distress.  He tried to intervene but the kid had fucked shit up too much already.  My man ran back to the kitchen, brought her food back and gave it to her for free with profuse apologies but even that wasn't enough. Frankly, I don't blame her...she had the patience of Job but this kid is infuriating.  We all have natural proclivities and I'm sure he has a calling in life but the service industry is not it. \\n\\nI'll stick with the old model...oh, and some pepper salted squid."},{"name":"Lambert's Marketplace","address":"140 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"What the hell happened to this place?

We had made a reservation for my birthday and it was not held. There was no apology. Just a \\"do you mind sitting at the bar\\", delivered by a loud and possibly intoxicated greeter (who we haven't seen before) who was awkwardly handsy with my fianc√©e. We sat at the bar for quite a while which was also awkward as we watched the bartender snap angrily at the greeter and otherwise act surly and unfriendly toward us, until he finally mumbled \\"do you want anything?\\" At least we think that's what he said.\\n\\nLong story short it took us around 30 minutes to finally be seated, again with no apology or recognition that we had in fact made a reservation. Even after we were seated we waited and waited another fifteen minutes for the waiter to finally come over to our table. When she finally did, she said \\"ok what do you want?\\" Keep in mind, this was essentially her greeting to us.\\n\\nSo I told her, upset but not inappropriately so, that I was not happy with the service at all, and given that we were customers who had given them pretty regular business in the past, it was especially disappointing.\\n\\nAs soon as I opened my mouth her eyes glazed over and she kept saying over me in a flat mechanical voice, \\"I'm sorry.\\" You know how you can say one thing but mean a completely different thing? Yeah. She was saying I'm sorry but was basically saying I could give a shit.\\n\\nNot sure what happened. We've had this very waitress twice before in fact and she was good. I don't know if there's new management, if the greeter guy was new and messing stuff up or what. Clearly it was a busy night.

Apparently you need reservations for dinner b/c when we arrived our only options were to sit at the bar or sit outside on the patio in the rain. We chose the bar. At first things were fine but we quickly noticed the bartender was overwhelmed with orders from the bar and the tables. So we waited patiently to order an appetizer and even longer to place our order for dinner. We actually had to inquire how much longer it would take for our food to come out, as I'm pretty sure an hour or at a minimum 45 minutes had passed. When our bartender/server Kevin finally asked if we needed anything else and if everything was ok I politely explained that our dining experience had been less than satisfactory due to all the wait times. Instead of saying I'm sorry to hear that (which honestly is all we wanted to hear) we got \\"really? I put the order in at at this time and it came out at this time. It's a Saturday night....\\"  Basically to say what did we expect? After we verified that he was being serious he suggested we speak to the manger if we want but he made it clear that he didn't give a you know what. He even went as far as to ask where else we have dined in Atlanta so he could understand what we were comparing him to. Do you really need a list of where I have dined to validate your sorry excuse for service?  My friend asked \\"Isn't the customer always right?\\" his response \\"Not exactly\\".  Luckily the manager was more than accommodating due to our experience.  Bottome Line: Kevin at the bar makes a mean drink but needs NOT to interact with human beings. Unfortunately the bad customer service really but a bad taste in my mouth. Perhaps I need to try them during a different time of the day and never sit at the bar again."},{"name":"Flying Biscuit Caf√© - Midtown","address":"1001 Piedmont Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"First of all I want to smack somebody momma after eating this delicious food!!!!!

We made a reservation on Open Table and had no problem getting a reservation.  It was reasonably busy.\\n\\nLocation: I have driven up North Ave frequently, but never knew this place existed.  It is set back off the street with a big parking lot. There was complimentary valet, but when we left, the line was backed up, so the valet service just gave me my keys and let me walk in the rain to my car.  Seems like they could have used an additional person.\\n\\nAmbiance: The inside atmosphere was warm despite the lofty industrial decor. There were high ceilings with cool paintings on the wall and a decent amount of soft lighting.  We sat in a  2-person booth - very romantic.\\n\\nService: We were seated promptly.  Our waiter was a bit peculiar, but nice. When we asked if there were any drink specials, he said, \\"I don't have any wine specials, but I have special wines.\\"  He was attentive to us though and seemed to know the items on the menu reasonably well. He made a mistake on our bill (overcharged us for our glass of wine),  but had no issue fixing it.\\n\\nFood: The restaurant week menu was a little sparse, but that is true for most restaurants during these weeks.  There were 2 appetizers to pick from.  One was a warm, cream of corn-type soup with some chorizo...we liked it.  The other was a Bibb salad with strips of manchego cheese and a thin cream dressing.  Also good, but some of the other non-restaurant week appetizer menu items looked even better.  Next time!\\n\\nFor entrees, there were three options. I had the trout which had a nice cornmeal encrusted layer.  The fish was fillet with the skin on the bottom.  It was very nicely prepared - flaky and easily to pull off the underlying skin. Beneath the fillet was a decent sized bed of greens and string beans.  On top, there was some sort of creamy white sauce.  A little salty but good.\\n\\nMy wife had the lamb dish.  It kind of reminded me of something you would find in a Middle Eastern restaurant.  There was about four chunks of lamb with a large portion of cilantro mixed in. I found the cilantro to be a little overpowering, but my wife actually liked it a lot...better than my trout. The third entree option was a summer pea filled ravioli which we didn't try.\\n\\nWe each had a glass of red wine which were good and they brought out a basket of bread and butter after we ordered.\\n\\nFor dessert, there were two options.  We had a carrot cake with some cream cheese frosting on top.  Very moist; not too sweet.  The second dessert was a very rich, dark chocolate cake with some dried cranberries and a cinnamon-flavored ice cream.  Both good.  \\n\\nOverall, we were glad we tried 4th & Swift.  The restaurant week menu is sparse, but much more affordable than the normal entrees, which were $20+ per dish.  Also, seems like it would be a good place to go for a drink during Happy Hour on the way home from work."},{"name":"Jam Cafe on Beatty","address":"556 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"We went on a Saturday morning and waited in line for about 45 minutes.

So bravo to that.  Since it the newest of the \\"official BC game watch\\" location, I decided to visit it for the October 4th game against NC State.\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed about the bar (well, second thing, after the abundant street parking) was the dark wood.  Everything - walls, doors, floors, were a rich dark wood, which is what I prefer my sports bar covered in.  Framed and autographed jersies hung on the walls below the room-encircling parade of HDTVs.\\n\\nI tucked myself into a table near the front corner of the place and was immediately brought ice water by our attentive waitress.  Bonus point for hydration.  There's a very delicate balance of what a waitress needs to do when people are at a bar for a 3 to 4 hours sporting event.  They need to be visible enough to always be reachable, but never pushy.  Our waitress walked the line just right.  Over the entire course of the game, we were looked after, had our drinks refreshed constantly, and made us feel welcomed.\\n\\nThe food itself was Sports Depot-esque, which is a good thing.  A good Boston Sports Bar has great food that sticks to your ribs.  The nachos I ordered were loaded up right.  The mac'n'cheese was a bit on the small side but still filling.  And the peanut butter cake I ordered as quarterback Chris Crane hit Lars Anderson with a 36 yard pass (go Eagles!) was the stuff that dreams are made of.\\n\\nOverall, I'd rank the Beer Garden up there just below the Sports Depot and just above the Joshua Tree in the \\"top choice for Allston-Brighton Sports Bars.\\"  Go there for BC games, or any sporting event you can wear your favorite jersey to."},{"name":"Finnegan's Bar & Grill","address":"6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Good place.

The apple sausage was really good, but the rest of the meal could have been better. Bothersome when it arrives at the table lukewarm. The biscuits & gravy were tasty, but would have been better hot. Biscuits were really thick and very dry in the middle. Day old? Same thing with the cinnamon french toast. Bread was over an inch thick, but had just a smattering of egg on the outside. It would have been much better if they had sliced it a bit thinner & let it get better acquainted with the egg mixture. Dense & dry is just not right for french toast.

Being that a gave my order to another bartender that appeared to be in training which relayed the order to another bartender to input, there was some lag time.  She also told me that the time on my phone may not be the same time as what's on the register.  Maybe they need to change their HH menu to from 430-625pm so they have time to input your order.

Definitely something I had never tried before and absolutely delicious. All the entrees are very imaginative and tasty too.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that it can get really loud in here. The acoustics are just awful. If you go with just one other person you can carry on a conversation, but if you are going with a group it is hard to hear. Mind you this is when there isn't a band playing. When there is a band just forget about it. I put this on my list of places not to take my hard of hearing father for dinner.\\n\\nP.S.

She just shrugged and left the bowls on the table. \\nI stopped the gentleman who seated us and took our order and told him I haven't received my dish yet. He apologized and went in the back. \\nBy this time, my friend had finished his meal and all this time I have been just sipping on my cup of tea and starving. \\nHe came back out and said the chef is making it now. \\nSeriously?!!!\\n5 minutes later and finally my dish arrived.\\nLooks fine, nice portion, but bland in flavour. \\nAs I finished my plate and took a drink from my glass of tea that I have been drinking through out this whole ordeal, I noticed something as I looked thru the see through glass, there was something stuck on the side of the glass, looks like a hard tea leaf, I tried to scrub it off but it wasn't on the outside of the glass. It was in the inside, so I poured the tea out of the glass into the bowl and tried to lightly nudge it off with my chopstick. No such luck, it was not coming off, at that moment I was in total disgust and called the guy over and he came over and asked if I would like more tea. \\nI told him I would not and definitely would not want to drink it out of this glass and showed it to him. He just looked at it briefly and put it away for washing at a later time. \\nI'm in the service industry also and I believe these workers rely on tips but I believe that the appropriate amount should be given in a case by case scenario. \\nThis scenario was zero tip.\\nI was not rude to any servers at any time. \\nI ate, asked for the bill, and left, never showing any attitude towards them.\\nThis place is pricey as well for the food they serve here. \\nNever coming to this place again, ever!\\nOh, and forget to mention that my friends soup of the day was not served to him."},{"name":"Figs by Todd English","address":"42 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Figs has some of the most unique pizzas in all of Boston.

My favorite chocolate dippers were the marshmallows, strawberries, and bananas.  The pound & cheese cake were too light and the rice crispies were wayyy too sweet.\\n\\nFinally, my bf ordered a shared strawberry basil lemonade.

We couldn't wait to have another option because as we all know, C-bus isn't known for that great of pizza choices.  Still isn't.  \\n\\nWe called ahead to eat in because they stress on the website that it takes 20-25 minutes to cook any pizza there.  We knew it would take 25 minutes for us to make the drive on the other side of town so we asked the guy if he could wait 10 minutes before he put it in and said no problem.  When we got there it was empty, there were an abundance of employees by the wall of ovens so we approached the order/pay window.  We were standing there for a good 3 minutes with employees looking at us and walking away when the hubby began showing a bit o' irritation.  When we told the person who approached the window we were the call in, he didn't really say anything and took our money.  We got our drinks and went to sit down and the hubby glanced over and saw a pizza sitting on the counter and he said \\"is that ours?\\" and the guy said yes.  Well thanks for telling us.  The pizza was lukewarm, didn't look remotely like what was featured in Columbus Underground and so far the customer service was in the toilet.\\n\\nWe got a pepperoni and cheese with mushroom on half.  The crust looked about like a slightly thicker than hand crust but not sicilian or deep dish.  The first bite the sauce was thinny applied but garlicky (sp) but that was the only time I tasted it.  I found it odd the hubby hadn't yet commented 4 bites in and then he said \\"doesn't it suck when you take your first bite of a new pizza and know you'll never come back?\\"  That about says it all.  He said the crust was horrible and tasted like it had been in the fridge all night and having other odors mingle with it.  Oh yeah when I got some black iced tea and took a drink it was horrible and almost sludgey so they need to get that balance.  Dumped it and got Coke instead.  Also for the multitudes of employees, 2 tables on either side of us had obviously been recently vacated but were covered in crumbs and grease.  I'd be willing to bet there were 3 when we left for quite a while.  I'm sorry but when you're the new kid in town, you should have clean tables, helpful employees and serve your pizza piping hot.  While it was one of the better mediocre pizzas we've had, it's still mediocre and we won't be back.  The only good thing I can say is for $13.75 we got a medium pizza with 1 1/2 toppings and 2 drinks which is a pretty good deal.

Why not write another review for all the new dishes I tried? It's a new season and all the dishes had been changed out.

It was Halloween night so all the servers and chefs were dressed to the nines in their outrageous costumes. We were so excited to see Kevin Gillespie, but it turned out to be a convincingly dressed up chef. \\n\\nWe turned down the cocktail cart, since the drinks didn't look all that impressive. We instead ordered a bottle of red wine, which got the three of us a little happy toward the end of the meal, especially me, oops! \\n\\nDishes came out to us in this order:\\n\\nThai red curry duck leg ($15) - fragrant and spiced, the duck was tender and not tough like overcooked duck meat can become, as expected. The accompanying basmati rice went well with the curry. Seemed a little sour for a curry... Maybe a little heavy handed with the lime?\\nSoy-glazed GA quail over shiitake-miso grits ($15) - the grits had the appearance of Israeli couscous and the quail looked like pork chops. But as you take a bite, you fall right into heaven. Well cooked quail, not dry, with the slightly asian spin on the grits, made for an interesting combination, that worked!\\nRoasted white shrimp ($16) - refreshing. Shrimp were juicy and plump and succulent. The garnish made the dish, for sure.\\nEthiopian Braised Lamb ($16) - braised lamb was just perfect. The season and flavors were spot on. Injera bread was soggy and sour, as it is supposed to be. I wish they could have taken a quirky spin on this one though, since this is more traditional Ethiopian.\\nCrispy Brussels ($10) - I love Brussels. So there is no way to mess these up for me. Crispy and crunchy, you can still taste both the light richness of the pear butter. My favorite dish of the night.\\nLobster Roll ($21) - ok so at this point I am beyond full. Three people sharing six dishes... May have been pushing it. I loved the tangy flavor of the fresh lobster. I wish I could have appreciated the bread and lettuce along with it. The bun looked super fluffy and reminded me of a H&F bun.\\n\\nWe were sad to see the beef Wellington come out after finishing our final dish. It looked amazing with a crispy pastry on the outside and a moist, pink center. But alas, that was something we had to pass up. We thought we were done. But for some reason our server talked us into dessert. And omg, am I glad he did. I had heard \\"meh\\" things about Kevin's Old Fashioned Banana Pudding, but for some reason, hearing our server describe the dessert, we couldn't say no. We watched the chef in the back torch the top of the pudding beautifully. Tables around us noticed our pudding order as it arrived at our table and flagged down their server to change their dessert orders. And wow was I in heaven. My only mistake was sharing my pudding with my friends and not ordering a second one.\\n\\nAfter dropping all that money I've spent here... I can never hesitate to come back.

I had very high hopes for this place because I had seen it from the road for many years and always thought it looked really cool. I'll begin with the bad and then move onto the better.\\n     Usually you would expect a lot out of a place that has such a pricey menu. An intimate dining experience is one of these expectations. Instead we were seated upstairs against the wall in a sort of half booth thing. The people sitting on each side of us were about two feet away. It felt like we were actually at the same table as them. I'm also not sure on the dress code. My wife and I were dressed to the nines, and while there were some others dressed alike most were very under dressed. But it is Boulder. They brought out a \\"free\\" duck patte' thing that was ok. I don't really want to go into what we ordered because it was all just mediocre. The best part I have to say was the Creme Brulee, but its hard to make a creme brulee that I don't like. To top off the night, just before we got our check a couple sat down with a baby. After a few minutes it started to cry. I don't know about you but when you drop a lot of money on a meal you don't want to hear babies crying. Anyways onto the good!\\n     There are 2 saving graces this place has is location and service. It is located in a beautiful area and that is worth some merit. The waiters were very helpful and fast.

I really do. But when I stop and think about it, I realize that all of my experiences there have been disappointing. \\n\\nLet me start off by saying that I'm a vegetarian, so I'm used to having limited options at restaurants. But Temple Bar does that thing where they put the same ingredients into multiple dishes. For example, the majority of their dishes that incorporate cheese contain blue cheese. The majority of their vegetarian dishes come with mushrooms. Those happen to be two things that I dislike, so it doesn't leave me with many options and I usually wind up with a boring old salad. \\n\\nI'm sure the thought of copious amounts of blue cheese and mushrooms would thrill some people, but in my opinion good restaurants shouldn't resort to the same ingredients; there should be a variety to satisfy different tastes. \\n\\nAlso, once when my friend and I went here for dinner, we ordered sandwiches that were supposed to be served with fries, only to be informed after we had ordered that they were out of fries.

Sometimes on a Friday or Sat night there is a rush of college kids late at night, but the wait is not terrible. \\n\\nService: Cashiers seem like they hate their lives because they lack eagerness to take your order. Server will bring your food to your table along with utensils. Sometimes there are condiments on your table, otherwise you will have to go to the self-serve drink machine to grab hot oil, hot sauce or parmesan cheese. You leave your trash on your table, which the server will pick up.\\n\\nFood: I ordered one slice of the Felini's special, which was huge with lots of toppings and lots of cheese, thus, the crust was a bit moist and tasted a bit undercooked. It took about 5 minutes for my 1 slice to come out.  I definitely recommend eating it with a fork/knife since the crust is pretty thin. I could barely taste the tomato sauce. Pizza hut or domino's pizza taste better.....no where near as good as Jet's pizza.

Most hours of the day you will find a line of cars backing out into the very fast paced and busy Lamar Blvd, just waiting to get into the drive thru line.  Because they cook the food as you order the line takes some time so don't be in a hurry when you come here.  When you go to turn the corner in your vehicle from the \\"pay\\" window to the \\"pick-up\\" window you will have to what seems like a 180 degree turn where, with some vehicle like my truck, isn't easy.  If you decide to NOT go through the drive-thru understand that there is no inside to this location, it is a burger \\"stand\\" so you will have to walk up to a window, listen for your order after you place it and either take it home or eat out on some outdoor table/benches.\\n\\nBut once you have your food I think you will like it.  The burgers are not very big (they resemble In and Out Burgers in size) but very tasty.  The fries are cut in store from potatoes.  The menu is simple and the only thing your burger comes with is lettuce, tomato, ketchup and mayo.  If you want pickles, onions or jalapenos that is an extra $.20.  If you don't eat red meat you can also get chicken or veggie burgers.  For dessert you can get a cookie or shake.  I know the shakes seem popular.

So apparently the best solution for then is to give us a total of $20 vouchers, which don't even stack when used. So they'd expect us to come back? Why would we come back to service like this? We spent $130 on food, and we got two $10 VOUCHERS THAT EXPIRE back. We wanted a refund and they denied. Terrible service, hairy food and rude staff.

I tasted the salmon and it had a wonderful smoky flavor. He said he really enjoyed the salad.\\n\\nMy only slight complaint had to do with the service.

Opportunity finally struck as (1) my wife and I needed a place to eat after seeing the Blue Man Group at the Fox Theater and (2) Halfoffdepot.com had a gift certificate here a few weeks back. The menu looked great, and we came in expecting to have a good (maybe even great) meal. What we got was, quite honestly, the best meal either of us have ever sat down to. Nothing prepared us for how good the food turned out to be.\\n\\nI'll start by saying that we were lucky enough to be seated in (in my opinion) the nicest seat in the house. There's a really cool corner table that allows us to sit next to each other, and we were lucky enough to snag it before the masses came. Service was impeccable. Our server had a minimal presence and the pacing of the meal allowed us to digest some before the next course came.\\n\\nWe started by each ordering a small plate. I had the diver scallops with a white mushroom sauce, and my wife had the clams with buckwheat noodles and shiitake mushrooms. Both dishes had a certain amount of subtlety to the flavors, and the seafood was cooked perfectly. I also appreciated that the amount was not too much -- enough to enjoy the plates, but not so much as to fill us up.\\n\\nI should probably add that before our small plates, they brought out some heavenly bread. There was a traditional dinner roll and a ciabatta-type roll (two of each). I wouldn't usually comment on something like bread, but it was that good!\\n\\nFor our large plates, I ordered the Pheasant Breast served with a pheasant leg ragout, and some sweet potato 'cubes'; my wife ordered the 'Three Little Piggies'. The pheasant breast was gamey (in a very good way), and creaminess of the ragout was a very nice contrast to the breast. Here, in contrast to the small plates, the flavors were bursting. Now where do I begin with the Three Little Piggies??? I can probably only say that it was quite simply the tastiest single dish I've ever eaten in my entire life. It was the perfect marriage of flavors and textures. Everything on the plate worked with every other thing and the plate just made perfect sense.\\n\\nFor dessert, I ordered the 'Snap. Crackle. Pop', which came with some type of Rice Krispies treat and a caramel white chocolate 'snake' ... super, super yum. My wife ordered the Sticky Toffee Pudding which was, much like the Three Little Piggies, the single best dessert I've ever had at a restaurant. It was indescribably good and I could have eaten it all day.\\n\\nAll in all, 4th and Swift gave my wife and I our single greatest dining out experience to date. It was a night, and a meal, to remember. This place has moved to the top of my (very long) list of favorite Atlanta restaurants!"},{"name":"Grill 23 & Bar","address":"161 Berkeley St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Grill 23 was rated best steakhouse in Boston for 2013, so that's where we went to celebrate my brother's birthday. I certainly hope it isn't really the best steak Boston has to offer, because that would be pretty disappointing then.\\n\\nI will admit I'm not a crazy meat lover, but I can appreciate a good steak. My brother ordered the ribeye medium rare and I the ny bone-in medium rare. The quality of the meat itself was great, and they came cooked as ordered. However, the au jus and caramelized onions were grossly over salted, and since the au jus was poured all over the steak already when it came, it made the steak far too salty. You couldn't appreciate the meat flavor really with all that salt there. I had ordered a side of Brussel sprouts and hoped that would help cut the salt, but it ended up being a bit salty too. That and it wasn't roasted as crisp as I would have liked. \\n\\nThe rest of our party got the meatloaf, beer battered hake, and brick pressed chicken. The presentation of the foods was impressive, so I hope their food was as good as it looked, they did not have any complaints during the meal about the food so I think it was good. The staff were excellent at topping off out waters whenever it was more than a quarter empty, which was nice, but otherwise was pretty slow in all other regards. It is the week of dine out Boston though, so they were pretty busy. The decor had an old fashioned luxe feel to it, and the staff were very pleasant to us the entire meal, despite the fact we probably seemed out of place since everyone was quite a bit older than us.\\n\\nI would give this place another try on a less busy week, and see if it was just an off day for our meal.

There are many options for vegetarian diners, a handful for vegans (although I would not recommend a vegan visit here unless you're just stuck in a group - not enough options), and the usual plenty of choices for omnivores.

Server recommended we order a regular-sized entree for our kids to share, which was stating the obvious since there's no kids menu and pasta and sauce generally starts around $15. We ordered penne/quattro formaggio for them, my wife got fresh tagliatelle/siciliana and I got risotto with mushrooms and shrimp. Food came out in a reasonable time (though we were the first customers of the day). \\n\\nLet's work our way up: the risotto tasted more like a vehicle for sauce than rice - a heavy, ashen-colored stock that was overpowering. Wife's pasta dish by comparison had bland accompaniment - couldn't detect any basil or herbs (which is somewhat significant in siciliana, we thought?), just mainly tomatoes and olives, but it was alright. Surprisingly the kids' dish was our unanimous pick - the penne was properly al dente and the cheeses blended together well. But we are honestly just as happy (and considerably cheaper) ordering a slightly less-quality version at Figo for significantly less money.\\n\\nAbout halfway through our entree, the server came over and tried to set the table up immediately for dessert, handing out menus. I got coffee, and the check showed up before the drink (just a slip of paper on its own, not even housed in anything, like the thought was FOR GODSSAKES, GET THIS TO THEM PRONTO IF IT WILL MAKE THEM LEAVE!!). I paid, got my coffee, and was pretty much left on my own after that without checking on refills. Not that I get all huffy about that, but the place was a quarter occupied at most and my kids are used to restaurants and as such we were causing no harm so I did not know exactly how we earned our scarlet letter. In a final touch, the maitre d' didn't even make the customary \\"thanks/goodbye\\" filler as we walked out 5 feet in front of her - never seen that happen before!\\n\\nUltimately, this is a huge global chain that is entering into the US, and they're entering it in that tried-and-true \\"we look hip and are in urban centers so you won't think we're a chain.\\" So it's a couple of rungs up from your typical idea of an Italian chain, but better to be off the ladder altogether.

Unfortunately, these were the only good aspects of my visit. \\n\\nI cannot emphasize enough how important customer service is in the restaurant industry, especially in a bar setting where the only thing that differentiates a place is the service.

But I digress... this place exhibited some of the worst customer service I have ever seen. Our waitress was extremely rude. I came with my family from dinner, so we just wanted to order some drinks and potentially a dessert or appetizer. My mother asked for a dessert menu and our waitress told her in an annoyed tone that they didn't \\"do\\" dessert here. She bit her tongue, and kindly asked if it was possible sample some beer prior to picking something. You would have thought we asked for samples of the whole tap list. \\"Well, we can't give you a ton but yeah we do samples\\". Again she bit her tongue, and we just decided to take a leap of faith and order. It took at least 15-20 minutes to get our drinks. The place was by no means packed. Fed up at this point, we ordered the pretzels and beer cheese to go and high-tailed it out of there. That stuff was downright  inedible. The pretzels tasted like chemicals, and the beer cheese was grainy and virtually flavorless except for the raw flour which was not added properly to the roux. \\n\\nI won't be back, and I hope this review saves others from the same experience I had.

We went last night and the restaurant was decently packed. However, the host made us wait a few minutes for a table when there was clearly plenty of tables open. After you get seated you get a basket of pita bread which is really good. The room is very nondescript. It feels like you are stuck in the 80s in this place or at an extremely cheesy weeding. We started off with the Spinach pie. It was good but it was nothing special. We ordered the family plate #1 that came with Hummus, tabbouleh, kippee leaves, chicken kabob and steak kabob with rice pilaf and grilled vegetables all for $40.00. So for 2 people it is plenty of food and you will get leftovers. The highlights of the meal were the hummus and tabbouleh. Wifey and I really enjoyed this part of the meal. We were getting excited for the rest of the meal but it just did not live up to its expectations. The kippee leaves we did not care for at all. The steak kabob was bad and not cooked enough. The waitress did not ask how we wanted them cooked and they were under medium rare. Go up the street to Conrad's if you are looking for good steak. They have great steak tips. The chicken kabob was good. I would ordered that if I went again. The rice pilaf was good and the grilled vegetables, but they only give you 2 green peppers. The food was just okay. I was not floored. \\n\\nHere is where the night got strange. All of sudden music started blasting and strobe lights went circling and a belly dancer started gyrating. Yes, that is right a belly dancer. It was so awkward. I did not know what to do. Do I stare at her....Do I give dollar bills? I am not use to these kind of places. It was real cheesy.  She was good I guess. My father had a better one at his 40th bday, but I was 4 years old when that happen. I am telling you the music was blasting. The server was horrible too.

But I do take issue with some of the comments about \\"authenticity\\". Just take a look at the menu. Despite the name, it's clear that the goal is not about being authentically Shanghainese. They serve the typical mish-mosh of dishes from different provinces. Ma Po Tofu, for example, is not Shanghainese. So would I expect such a restaurant to serve a killer Yu Xiang Chicken or Ma Po Tofu? No - average at best - a generalist Chinese restaurant is never going to touch a Sichuan or Cantonese restaurant.\\n\\nThat's why it was so surprising to find delectable pea pod stems (more of a Northern Chinese dish), shredded chicken in chili sauce (Sichuan style), double-fried Shanghai noodles (thick like Udon, and definitely Shanghainese) and yes, their well-balanced potstickers (which were not the typical calzone-like monstrosities).\\n\\nThe Good: Very clean, pretty kid friendly. Solid food all around - worst dish was the scallops with black pepper sauce - not terrible, but too heavily breaded and sauced. \\n\\nThe Bad: a bit on the pricey side, but it is Wellesley after all.\\n\\nIn Short: All in all, will go again - a reasonable suburban alternative to Sichuan Gourmet - though definitely not as authentic! ;)"},{"name":"Turf N Surf Po' Boy","address":"407 Lavaca St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Had the 'fried chicken' plate which was excellent...Fried to perfection & super juicy/flavorful. \\nWe ordered at the counter and sat near the bar, and not once did anyone come around to see how we were doing. \\nThere was a dead roach in the ordering counter window near the menu (see pic) and when I notified the young man at the counter he seemed unbothered.

If you took it, they put a one next to it, and then you get charged.And a lot of times I really didn't want to take the food but I did because I felt bad saying no. I think I prefer a restaurant where the food is made to order.

Very clean and neat inside. It looks there will be a small deli area, some local products (saw lots of Bob's Red Mill), espresso and of course the great BBQ. We wanted a sample of everything so we ordered two sides: collards and beans/rice, an order of short ribs and a dozen wings (half spicy, half BBQ). Oh! And a cookie! Oatmeal raisin, which isn't my favorite, but this cookie was big and chewy. Very good. \\n\\nSo the sides were good. The beans/rice was my favorite of the two. The collards were JUST a smidge salty for me, but great flavor. It had chucks of pork and even a bit of okra. The wings were by far my favorite of all that we ordered. Surprisingly, the spicy was too spicy for me. I usually like spicy, but these wings kicked my arse. The BBQ wings were amazing. Even after getting home, the wings were still crispy and had this great sticky, honey BBQ flavor. Most places use a standard sauce on everything, but all the sauces on the meats were different. The beef short ribs were a little tougher than I'd like, but were good nonetheless. Well, I won't say it was tough, but it's got a bite to it. Definitely more due to the cut, rather than the smoking.

I recall wait staff that not only remembered me from a visit about 9 months prior, he knew what I had ordered. I remember classic escargot and frog legs as well as venison.\\n\\nAll that is gone. I had some difficulty choosing my meal but opted for the oxtail soup and the lamb. The former was decent, nothing spectacular. I was glad that the truffles were almost flavorless since I do not like their normal flavor. I really did not like the lamb. Neither the texture nor the flavor was pleasant to me which I found surprising since I love lamb and other gamy meat. I ate almost none of it. To the credit of the establishment, the manager did not charge me for this dish. He converted my prix fixe into an a la carte order. \\n\\nAnd although the wait staff was pleasant and friendly, our server reminded me more of a young kid working at the Olive Garden than at an exclusive French restaurant. \\n\\nAll that said, I do not regret having tried out Monsieur Paul.

Root cellar vegetables. $14.99.\\nWell the fake tasting taters, that's what.  The seafood, while minimal was cooked properly, but the light cream sauce was so light that it had no flavor whatsoever.  Cheese had no flavor.  And those root veggies were boiled and tasteless with a bit of white sauce that was also tasteless.  UGH.

It did take a minute for our server to come out but she was super friendly! The food was decent, not the best I've ever had but still good. Be sure not to ever ask for any type of condiment that you may see at other restaurants, they do not have ranch or steak sauce. They have aioli, vinaigrettes, etc. The hostess made it a point to let us know they don't have \\"that kind of stuff here\\". \\n\\nI ordered the fried chicken biscuit and subbed the collard greens for a side of fruit. The portion was a bit small, I didn't mind because I'm on a 'get healthy' kick right now. The price wasn't bad, $9 for what I ordered. We wanted our checks split and our server mentioned their system goes very slow when doing this. But she was very nice to do it and let us know it would be a minute. She offered to go drinks and all in all, a very great server. \\n\\nOverall the food is good. The service was a 50/50, hostess was rude, server made up for it.

We arrived about 10 minutes before our reservation and of course they told us to go to the bar and get a drink and someone would come and grab us when our table was ready. That's all good in all. However, I noticed there was plenty of empty tables. So, obviously this is a scam they have been running for years. I will say the drinks are strong. I caught a buzz off one drink. Yes, I am not big a drinker. However, when I saw my tab for 2 drinks was $25. I better catch a buzz.\\nI did not like the table they sat me and my wife at. Yes, it was just the 2 of us. We noticed all the tables around us had big parties. So, we felt like were at the kids table at a wedding.\\nOur waiter came over and was very nice. I think this is where this restaurant earns major points. The service was excellent.\\nThe bread they start you with is very good. You get at least 6 rolls. So, be careful you do not fill up on the bread. We started out with fried goat cheese. This dish was AWESOME. I think it was the best thing I ate all night. Then we split a Caesar salad. Nothing special. Disappointed actually because so many people raved about it on yelp.\\nI got the Kobe steak. Why, I am not sure. Supposedly this is the holy grail of steaks. This is my 2 time messing with the Kobe. I am not that impressed. I should of got the sirloin. Wifey got the twin fillets.

Drop about $250.00 and then 1 hour after eating I feel like I need to go the emergency room. I feel like ass people. All that food in my belly was not a good mix. I slept like crap. I wake up with a food hangover. So, this is where I have doubts about this place. Why spend all that money to feel bad. The one thing I  will say I noticed they  like to use salt. I swear I tasted salt crystals on everything. Also, the crowd was 40 +. A lot of these people think they are cool too. I saw a lot of 40 year old women wearing clothes that an 18 year old would wear.

I researched a little more and I was relieved to know it was the same great BBQ restaurant  that I experienced in Montana a few months back.  I  glanced over their online menu and saw they had a daily lunch special from 11:00 AM to 4:00 PM daily.  \\n\\nI took my dad and my sisters for an early Father's day outting on a Saturday.  When we arrived, we were told about at 15 minute wait.  It was actually only 5 minutes we waited so the wait times can be speedy.  We had a friendly server who recommended the draft root beer.  After bringing out the chilled root beer with the ice mug, we gave our orders.  They have a one meat combination plate for $9.99 and 2 meats for $10.99.  The savings are a few dollars so it is worth coming for the early bird time.  \\n\\nI ordered the chicken wings and dry-rub roasted chicken.  Everyone else ordered the spare ribs for their meat choice.  The combination plate comes with cornbread muffin, corn on the cob, and a choice of a side.  The french fries are recommended; nicely seasoned and crisply cooked.  The  baked beans aren't too thick, but the sauce isn't too thin either.  The portions are pretty big and will satisfy the BBQ appetite.  \\n\\nThere are only a couple of things that bring it down 1 star.  First off, the beer menu is left to be desired.  In Montana, they had well over 15 drafts of beer to choose from including a variety of micro beers.  I was hoping that would carry over to the Tualatin location.  Unfortunately it is mostly domestic beers they offer with Widmer Hefeweizen being the exception.  Also, we asked for butter when one of the servers dropped our food off.  He was quick about getting us ranch when requested but when we asked for butter, we had to wait.  After a couple of minutes, our regular server came by and I asked for butter.  It took a few more minutes  but she came back with the butter.  We never saw the guy about the butter for the duration of our meal.  I  think he clocked off or something.\\n\\nDespite those set backs, this is a great BBQ restaurant to check out.  It is a chain, but not a big one.  They do have happy hour in the bar that offer appetizers for cheap and good deals on beer too.

There were a few minor slip ups with service, but the food for lunch was tasty and in ample portions.  The place is known for its bison and beef, but even the vegetarian in our party was impressed with the veggie burger.  I was pleased with my side iceberg wedge with bacon and bleu cheese, and my red bean and rice soup was yummy.  My dad loved his bowl of chili as his only dish, and he raved about the bread he requested to go along with it.  Everybody else seemed satisfied with their burger of choice and side.\\n\\nProblems with service--I called ahead to reserve for my party of 8 at 1 pm.  We arrived on time, but the host stated they weren't ready as they were waiting to see if we would actually show on time.  I asked for lemonade (quite delicious), but didn't get it on the first round of drinks.

We arrived half an hour later and were seated right away.. We ordered the Saganaki to start which was delicious! The owner must have noticed us looking at a more comfortable table in the corner that came available and came over to ask if she could move us to that table.. A very nice gesture! Two Greek salads next.. I enjoyed mine but my fianc√© found his to be too acidy. After the salads came our entr√©es, mine was the Chicken Parmesan which was the best I've had.. Moist, flavourful, delicious! My fianc√© had the special which was breaded pork in a gravy like sauce, vegetables and mashed potatoes which was also delicious!

So, I Yelped a place to stop on the way home that would fulfill our coffee & bacon related needs. Bumblekiss came up with fairly high marks, and twenty minutes later, we were sitting in this completely empty, Crayola-crayon-colored restaurant in the quiet little Fremont neighborhood. Our service, needless to say, was impeccable. If it hadn't been, the number of stars you see above would be radically different! While it was a Thursday around 10:30 am, not exactly the \\"brunch rush\\" time, it still felt a little sad and lonely in the small, empty dining room. Never matter- the food was lovely! I like their \\"make your own\\" egg scramble option, and that pears and green apples are ingredient options- I am a sucker for savory/sweet combos. I put together some sort of bizarre flavor medley, and enjoyed it thoroughly. The BF went with a more traditional meat-egg-cheese-onion option, and it suited his taste just fine. Now, I am not a brunch-crazed Oregonian like the rest of you- I drive past packs of shivering, hungry, hungover people crowding the sidewalks outside of Zell's, Tin Shed, Side Door, etc. on the weekends and shake my head, not understanding the motivation behind waiting an hour for an omelette.

What I don't understand though is that it seems like all kinds of locals come here as well, which is not true for our Times Square area (which we avoid like the plague).\\n\\nNevertheless, we ended up at the Blackstone and we were greeted by a host after we'd walked halfway through the restaurant who was nice enough and told us we could sit at the table near the front if we wanted. We sat, and the waitress came over and cleaned the table off and took our drink orders. So far so good. Margot G. and I both went with the specialty pumpkin ale ($4) and our friend had a Magner's pear cider. Then, another patron on his way out came over and told us he had a $25 off an order of $35 or more coupon from restaurant.com that he was unable to use because he didn't make it to the $35 threshold, so he was giving it to us. Keep in mind, the waitress SAW this entire exchange, and we asked her about it when she came back over. She took the coupon and disappeared. About 10 minutes later she came back and said the redemption code wasn't any good, and her entire demeanor had changed. We're talking night and day difference. It was like we were the scourge of the earth now. She took our food orders and proceeded to simply disappear for the rest of the evening. She only came back to serve us our food, and we had to ask another server for the check. Wow. Talk about a light switch change.\\n\\nOn the somewhat bright side, my chicken tenders with fries ($7.99) and Margot's burger ($8.99) were good. Our friend's chicken parmesan (one of the entrees listed on the specials for $13.99) was \\"terrible\\" though in his words, so perhaps it's safe to just stick with typical pub fare here."},{"name":"Tree House Italian Grill","address":"2201 College Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"I really wish I would of read the reviews and ALSO gone with my first experience from a few years ago.  Let's start with the bread... cold bread.. When the FRESH baked bread came out, I guess their versions of fresh is luke warm.  Moving on,  we decided on an appetizer.  We went with the calamari.  The over cooked, over breaded calamari.  The waitress did ask if we wanted another batch but we were done chewing.  OK, I'll eat that $9.95.  \\n\\nNext dinner...I went with the chicken marsala but didn't want the spaghetti pasta or marinara sauce the pasta came with.  So I requested linguini pasta with the marsala sauce instead.. easy enough.  The pasta sauce on the chicken tasted powdery.  YES like powder!  The chicken breast is a nice size however lacks any flavor and a bit tough.  Maybe flatten it out a bit would help soak up the saltless sauce? Did the cooks forget to flavor the food? Use salt?\\nSon's plate of chicken alfredo was ok, sauce seemed a bit runny but our son said \\"it was ok\\".  My husband also ordered his own plate of something... it's not fair to comment when I already forgot what it was.  \\n\\nSo now comes the bill... we noticed a $3.50 up charge for the pasta substitution on my plate AND a $1.50 up charge for the sauce substitution (or vice versa).  When I questioned the waitress, I asked where does it show this up charge on the menu, she said \\" It doesn't\\", I asked when did you tell me there was an up charge, she said \\" I didn't..... I simply said ok.. she huffed and rolled her eyes and said \\"I'll take it off\\".  I wanted to understand how I could be charged for something that I wasn't aware of.  Hate hidden charges with anything and YES I do read the fine print.  IT wasn't noted under the plates listed where I ordered from and waitress confirmed that.  To receive attitude after asking a question is unacceptable.  \\n\\nI went to their website as soon as we got home after dinner to provide feedback since the hostess told me their site did have a place for comments/feedback and sure enough there wasn't.

There are things I like and things they can improve on.\\n\\nWe were looking for a place with a patio for mid fall outside dining. Their patio is not covered but has umbrellas and is situated between 3 taller buildings so we had no sun and a breeze coming through the buildings. The seeting on the patio is tight and consists of medium-length benches with an open air bar-like seating area in view of the TVs (we sat there). As I said it was tight, so when other patrons wanted to sit in the benches past us we all had to squeeze in or over to get out of their way. Maybe one less bench outside or turn it sideways to create a standing area. Other than that the outside was decent and in full view of the TVs from where we were. Additionally outside TVs, some space heaters and rearranging the tables would make this perfect.\\n\\nMy motivation in coming was Ladies Night. Wednesdays all day they have half price wine bottles with no corkage fee ever! So we got there and started with the wine order...they didn't have my wine which was on the menu...STRIKE ONE. The waitress was accommodating and offered me other samples for options that were complementary to my wine choice. Each time she brought be a tasting glass it had old lipstick on the rim...once is a fluke, twice or more an issue...STRIKE TWO. I settled on a strawberry cider that was delicious. \\n\\nNow for happy hour they have specials on beer ($1.50 off drafts) but no liquor or food specials. That was a bummer but not a deal breaker. I wound up with the fried Tilapia tacos which were tasty and filling. \\n\\nLuckily I never got to a third strike, hence I will be back.

I am a country boy who has found himself placed in a city. It's a pretty awesome city but still...a city. Therefore I often find myself missing my time back on the ranch and spending a Saturday afternoon taking a nap on a pond bank with a catfish line tied to my big toe. Hell, sometimes when driving by a pig farm I'll even roll the window down to catch a whiff of home, but not all the time because the same smell usually makes my city-slicker wife gag. All that to say, I know down-home country fried catfish. So when I first stepped inside the Catfish Parlour I felt like I was somewhere I hadn't been since needing to go help my dad get the bottom-land plowed in time to plant soybeans....home. First thing that happened was an older lady wearing fishing bobbers as earrings came up and asked \\"honey, can I get you a sweet tea?\\" I would have dropped dead right there except apparently I had already died and gone to heaven. The next hour of so was pretty much a fried-food induced blur but I sure wasn't concerned about my health at that point because I had just lived life to the fullest.\\n\\nHere's a little tip. Go at lunch because it's kind of like a little buffet line where you get your plate that looks like it was purchased from an elementary school and fill it up with as many veggies that you want. Then you have to answer the tough questions: How many pieces and if you want spicy or regular. Inside tip: say \\"both\\" to that last question. Then comes the source of my satisfaction and my last 15 pounds....the unlimited hush puppies. The hush puppies are more like fried batter sticks than your cornbread based puppies but they perfectly serve their purpose as a dipping stick for that green magic that is the jalapeno tarter sauce. I've never been a tarter sauce man but their jalapeno tarter sauce is......dang....just dang. They also have an unlimited caesar salad bar with cold glass plates if you feel like you need something green but trust me, the only green you'll want is more of that jalapeno tarter sauce.\\n\\nIf there is one con about this place, it's that most of those riddles printed on the receipt make absolutely no sense. I swear the owners must make up this nonsense just to see the confused look on people's faces when they tell them the answer at the register. Oh you make THINK you know the answer but trust me, you have a better chance at getting it right by opening up a dictionary and blindly pointing to a random word. It doesn't matter anyways. By the time you get the check you'll be well on your way to slipping into a food coma. Oh man....I don't know what I'm doing still writing.

Our waiter, Sagar (or so the receipt said) after refusing to split our check (Even though we asked before we even ordered and had been allowed to split it on previous occasions), my food arrived cold (and I didn't complain) and hardly coming to the table because he was at the bar texting all night, FOLLOWED US OUT ONTO THE STREET after we paid and left and harassed us for several minutes because he felt we didn't tip well enough. He even went as far as to ask us how much more money we wanted to add to the check and to say \\"I don't know if you're aware but it's customary to tip 20% so if you don't know, I'm telling you now\\". We were in total disbelief. We felt the tip we left was plenty after the terrible service we received but after being followed onto the street, I regretted even leaving a tip at all. I ended up walking away while he was still talking because he wouldn't leave me and the rest of my party alone. Part of me still can't believe someone would actually do that. I'm definitely going to think twice before going back to this place again. There are way too many places in Boston/Cambridge to go back somewhere that the waiters follow you on the street when you don't tip them what they feel entitled to. I don't know if you're aware, but it's customary to tip a waiter the amount you feel they deserve based on their service and your's was terrible."},{"name":"Sweet Water Brewing Company Draft House and Grill","address":"Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport, 6000 North Terminal Pkwy, Terminal B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"This is the only place in the entire Atlanta airport that serves good beer.\\n\\nThe positive of course being the really good beer.

I have made a reservation beforehand on Open Table, but nothing was available until 9pm, so I made the reservation anyway and told my mom to eat something small before going to dinner.\\n\\nWe decided to go around 8pm, hoping for an early seating.  I checked in with the host, who seemed very courteous.  I mentioned to him that we have a 9pm reservation but will wait here for anything available before that.  He acknowledged our request and we were patiently waiting in their small waiting area.\\n\\nUpon walking into the restaurant, my mom was weirded out by the decor at the front.  As we were sitting around waiting to be called, she quietly said to me, this place reminds me of a funeral home.  I looked around, and agreed with her.  It is just a very odd vibe, but looking in the restaurant, it seems like it would be a nice, classy place.  We were patiently waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting..... \\n\\n8:55pm, we were called to be seated.  Great, 5 minutes earlier than our reservation time but hey, I was still pretty patient and hopeful to this point.  We were already starving, so when we got to our table, we were pretty much ready to order.  My mom does not drink and I usually don't drink at dinner, so we didn't plan on ordering any drinks, and just wanted water.  10 minutes go by, our water glasses were still empty and our stomach growling.  Another 5 minutes go by, at about 9:10pm our waitress finally showed up to take our drink order.  We told her we wanted water, and she disappeared and came back to fill our glass.  As she was filling our glass, she gave us the daily specials and told us she'll be \\"right back to take our order\\".   When she finally came back, we put in our appetizer and our meals.  This was about 9:15pm.\\n\\nWe got our basket of wontons and toasted bread, along with sweet and sour sauce and hummus for dipping.  This alone is worth the 2 stars I'm giving this place.  I should have just asked for another basket of that and call it a night.  The appetizers arrived shortly after.  We went with the Toasted flatbread with spinach and 3 cheese.  It was actually pretty good!  I was hopeful the rest of the entrees will be the same.  we mawed down the flatbreads and was ready for our entrees.  Then we waited and waited and waited and waited....\\n\\nI looked around the restaurant, it was almost 9:45pm and most patrons are either already eating their entrees, ordering desserts or paying the bill.  Apparently everyone had also waited until the last minute to use their Groupons, so that's why it was so packed in the restaurant.  Our waitress barely came over to check on us, and just as we were saying to have our food wraped up to go, they came.\\n\\nThe Beef Carpaccio salad was super small.  I mean, I asked the waitress about the size, but did not expect it to be a cup of Arugula and 3 pieces of filet mignon tataki.  For a $15 salad, I didn't think it was worth it.  Then my Kobe Pub Burger medium well was cooked with a pink/red center.  I am usually a medium rare girl when it comes to steak, but I like my burgers a little more cooked, so maybe this was my fault that I should have gotten it medium well.  The fries were not that good, onion strings was not crispy (if it was supposed to?).  I share half a burger with my mom and neither of us took more than two bites out of it.  For a $19 burger, I definitely have had better.  The food itself wasn't so bad, but it was the slow and inattentive service that made the experience worse.\\n\\nWe were so tired by the time we finished our meal (by finished I mean we took two bites and picked at it and basically stopped eating).  It was already 10:15pm, our waitress was chatting away with another table.  Pretty much after she took our order she came back once to check on how the food was, then never saw her again, until we were waiting to pay our bill.  For 15 minutes she was chatting away, so I got the attention of another waitress and she finally filled our glasses with ice water and then had our waitress bring us our check.  I laughed when she asked if we wanted coffee or dessert.  Sweetie, I don't want to be there until midnight, so no, just the check is fine.\\n\\n$47 for mediocre food and slow service at 9pm on a Wednesday night... nooooo thanks."},{"name":"Marco's Cafe & Espresso Bar","address":"7910 SW 35th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I knew I was in a great place when an exiting customer stopped for a second and said to me \\"I like your tie-dye shirt.

We tried the guacamole, nachos, tacos dorados, mexican hot dog, and the veggie enchiladas. First thing you'll notice is the place does not smell like food. Aesthetic decor and design are well thought out and executed. \\n\\n- The nachos are supposed to be topped with 6 ingredients including 2 types of cheeses. The chips themselves were nothing special, one small dab of tasty chipotle sauce and the beef was a bit soggy but had good flavor. Less that, these nachos were basically naked. maybe a couple pinches of the cheese(s) and a little bit of salsa. I believe there were 3 jalape√±os total. A $7 dish that should be no more than $4.00\\n\\n-The Enchiladas were inedible. A quickly baked in the oven pile of green sauce slop, drowned in a sea of cheese, gross veggies...Just don't eat it. Buddy had the chicken which was similarly drowned, not good flavor at all.The tortilla used for the enchilada was so thin, it was almost nonexistent. \\n\\n-The Tacos Dorados are soaked in a tomato sauce that has nothing to it. Totally bland. The beef inside was as though it had been re-microwaved after being initially overcooked. Like chewy, dry, over-charred, get stuck deep in your teeth sort of beef. If there was any cheese in there, I certainly did not see or taste anything. The pico cream was tasty. Served with a lime, which helps. \\n\\n-Their hyped hot dog is a very good sized jumbo. The mayo, mustard, guac, and grilled onion toppings were a good combination. It says it is bacon wrapped, most certainly wasn't. Neither of us could find anything resembling bacon. When they say \\"steamed mexican bun\\", they mean a sub roll. Hot dog looked and tasted like it had been rolled around in a frying pan for 30 seconds tops. I know they are already cooked, but it was like eating a giant raw hot dog on a sub roll with good toppings. No.\\n\\n-Guacamole was a good deal for price and portion. Chips were mediocre, but you really get a good amount of guac for $5.

I promised to take him for his birthday and was diligently saving for a splurging dinner.  I made reservations way in advance.  \\nWe arrived to a complete madhouse.  It was SUPER busy there, the hosts were running up and down the stairs.  We had to wait about 20 min to be seated, both bars were too full to be able to wait at the bar.\\nAfter we were seated, it took another 40 minutes for us to place our drink order (2 glasses of wine).  Our waiter seemed very busy and the floor manager ended up taking our drink orders.\\nWhen my wine arrived another 15 min later, it was spoiled.  The waiter took it back and opened a new bottle in front of me, after admitting that the other glass was from a corked bottle and the wine went bad there.  He then finally took our dinner order.  The appetizers came out pretty quickly - Jonah crab claws were fresh and delicious, the Caesar salad was very meh (tasteless and oily).\\nWe waited another hour for our steaks.  Meanwhile, the able to the left of us complained to the manager about their experience and lack of service, table behind us - paid for their drinks and left after an hour of waiting to place their dinner order.  Table to the right of us complained to the manger that their reservations were canceled last minute the day before and they had to wait an hour to be seated for their new reservations.\\nAbout 2 hours and 15 minutes after our arrival, we finally got our steaks.  We both ordered dry aged New York Prime ($67) and asked for them to be cooked medium.  We cut into them after the waiter left and they were well done!  All three side dishes (mashed potatoes, asparagus and mushrooms) were cold. We flagged the waiter down, showed him the overcooked steaks and he took everything back.  The floor manager stopped by, apologized and gave each of us a glass of wine on the house.  Waited another half an hour and our steaks arrived only slightly overcooked and the side dishes were now hot.\\nWe started eating our dinner 3 hours after we arrived!!!!  At this point it was 10:30 pm and I wasn't even hungry anymore, just tired.  \\nI wanted to keep the positive attitude for my husband and he did the same for me.  We didn't complain, paid our $300 bill and went home, where we had to pay extra to the baby sitter, because we weren't planning to be out for 4 hours.\\nThe next day, this experience kept gnawing at us.  And now we are angry and disappointed that we paid a lot of money for a terrible experience."},{"name":"Sapori di Napoli","address":"314 Church St","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"Great service and great pizza!

The restaurant also serves a lot of bison (my high school mascot). If you're looking for a nice traditional American meal, Ted's is the place for you. This location of Ted's, a chain founded by Ted Turner, is located just north of Brookwood near the intersection of Peachtree and Collier. The free rear parking lot, shared with Uncle Julio's next door, has entrances from both Peachtree and Collier. The lot is fairly spacious.\\n\\nInside, the restaurant has a classic American look, almost like a country club, but not quite. The atmosphere is casual, but refined. The lighting is dim and the servers wear clean and professional looking uniforms. There's a bar with TVs and the dining room sports several tables and a small collection of cozy, intimate booths. The takeout counter is located at the bar next to the for-sale craft sodas and souvenirs (e.g. Ted's branded hats, cups, bison plush toys). The dining room tables can easily be combined for large groups.\\n\\nTed's is best known for its bison and certified Angus beef burgers (nearly 20 different varieties served) and popular appetizers such as the Bison Nachos and St. Phillips Island Crab Cakes (made from crabs from Turner's private island in South Carolina). There's also soups, salads, sandwiches, steaks (hand-cut on-site), and entrees like Bison Meatloaf, Bison Pot Roast, Cedar Plank Salmon, and Roast Turkey and Dressing. There's only one menu (no separate lunch and dinner menus) where you can expect to spend about $12-17 for a burger and $15-20 each for most entrees.\\n\\nAt the time of writing this review, I've also visited the Ted's locations in downtown Atlanta (Luckie Street) and at Cumberland Mall. I like the Bison Meatloaf, though I haven't had it at this location on Peachtree. The dishes I've tried here include:\\n\\nApps/Sides:\\n* Bison Nachos - pepper jack, bison chili, fresh toppings\\n* 50/50 Fresh-Cut Fries and Salt & Pepper Onion Rings\\n\\nSalads:\\n* Farmhouse Salad - kale, Romaine, roasted chicken, cucumber, vine-ripened tomato, Gruyere cheese, bacon, roasted corn and pecans, basil, lemon vinaigrette\\n\\nBurgers:\\n* New Mexico Bison Burger - pepper jack, roasted Anaheim pepper, spicy tomato jam, guacamole, Kaiser bun, fresh-cut fries\\n\\nClassics:\\n* Springer Mountain Roasted Chicken - all-natural half chicken, glazed with cranberries, Sam Adams infused, garlic, rosemary, garlic mashed potatoes, broccoli\\n* Pecan-Crusted Trout - fresh-cut fries, kale salad, remoulade\\n* Bison Pot Roast - slow-braised pot roast, garlic, gravy, mashed potatoes, carrots\\n\\nFor the most part, the food at Ted's is A-OK to good. The ingredients are above average quality for an American chain restaurant. Included with every meal is a small bowl of Ted's signature pickles (or cucumbers, however you want to view them). They're half sour, so they're not sharply sour nor tart, with an appetizing crunch. I like them and usually ask for seconds (complimentary).\\n\\nThe Bison Nachos are good. You get a plateful of nachos piled high with hot, savory bison chili, chopped tomato, jalapeno slices, scallions, and a dollop of sour cream. These are great for sharing or even eating alone as an entree.\\n\\nA basket of 50/50 Fresh-Cut Fries and Salt & Pepper Onion RIngs are good for the table. The smooth, thick fries are par for the course. There are potato skins on some of the fries. The onion rings are alright as well. They're big and slightly salty.\\n\\nThe entree salads, such as the Farmhouse Salad, are large and filling. If you want to order healthy, this is one of the obvious choices as the salad has plenty of shredded kale and chopped Romaine. The ingredients are fresh and overall, the salad is satisfactorily tasty.\\n\\nI like to order Bison burgers at Ted's because that's what the business is known for. Bison burger patties are like leaner, slightly drier beef patties. Their consistency is tougher with some similarities to turkey. Ted's Bison burgers are nicely seasoned and in most cases have exceptional flavor. The mildly spicy New Mexico Burger I tried at this location was no exception. The melted slice of pepper jack cheese fused with the bison patty and there was an enjoyable amount of guac on top.\\n\\nThe Springer Mountain Roasted Chicken has soft, succulent skin, tender meat, and comes with a delightful jus-type sauce. The cooked broccoli served with comes in large chunks and the garlic mashed potatoes are downright comforting.\\n\\nThe Pecan Crusted Trout involves a rather wide fillet of trout (generous portion) with delectable skin on one side and pecan crust on the other. The creamy white remoulade resembles tartar sauce and it goes great on the fish. The fish is fresh and delicious. Both the chicken and trout are surprisingly good for a restaurant known for its bison and beef.\\n\\nThe Bison Pot Roast is disappointingly bland.\\n\\nOrders come out from the kitchen in a reasonable amount of time. Service is generally good, though I've been during times when it can get slow."},{"name":"Phnom Penh","address":"244 E Georgia Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"The food is incredible!!

My girlfriend is a vegetarian her drink had meat, I ordered a fontina cheese but was given pepper jack...I asked for bacon and received none. \\nOur server said: let me go check your sheets... 2:15 turned into 2:30 which turned into 3:00 and he never came back... I didn't go inside at some point just to see if he'd ever show up... and he didn't. \\nAs a life long lover of food and someone with a big mouth for local businesses that I love... I just cannot commit myself to a relationship with Provisions & Buzz....because no matter how hard I try to fall in love, \\nthey just always seem to fall short."},{"name":"Golden Temple","address":"1651 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"My boyfriend and I got delivery from here on Father's Day. When the food arrived we were disappointed to see how little food there was. I'm not sure if this was a one time thing because it was Father's day and they gave us a glass with the order, but regardless we paid about $50 for a side of rice, some soup and a Pu Pu Platter that was not nearly enough to feed both of us and I asked on the phone if it is enough for 2 people. \\n\\nI will say the food is delicious and it's probably the quality you are paying for but $50 for food not enough for 2 was a bit outrageous. I won't be ordering here again."},{"name":"Flying Biscuit Caf√© - Midtown","address":"1001 Piedmont Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I always love the consistently good food at Flying Biscuit.

For that price, $4 for 10 dumplings is pretty cheap. I think for an extra dollar they give you a can of soda and/or soup (not sure if they givw both or you get to choose). I got mushroom and pork dumplings steamed and I liked it. Frozen or not, for that price you can't go wrong especially if you want a quick meal that can fill you up for the day. \\n\\nI would come back again if i want some quick dumplings for lunch. Don't expect some kind of over the top, gourmet style dumplings, it seems like a lot were expecting that, hence the negative reviews. \\n\\nOh and the place is cash only and for me, I just had enough to pay for it that day so I didn't have to run to an atm to take out some :p"},{"name":"Charlie's Kitchen","address":"10 Eliot St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"After hearing rave reviews from friends about Charlie's classic double cheeseburger, I expected so much more.

So I'm writing a negative review.  Our waitress was 'eh' at most but what I didn't like about the service is that a couple of ladies at a table behind me were waiting a while before anyone came to their table.  One of the ladies had to motion someone over to let them know their dissatisfaction and instead of this waitress taking at least their drink order, she stood there looking around for the waitress the table belongs to.  Counter-productive? \\n\\nSo to get what else bothered about my experience at Joe's.  I ordered a three shrimp platter and everything was over done.  Instead of shrimp, I was eating fried and grilled rubber.  The best thing I ate that night was some fireball things and the french fries.  Maybe I should have ordered something from the steampots, but my shrimp should have been the easiest items made on the menu.  \\n\\nThe environment, food, and that we paid $50 for our meal SO was not worth it.

A change from your normal hostess as being a man at 6 ft plus in hight. Our waiter was equally wonderdful and kind. I mentioned my gluten allergy and he produced a menu almost as large as their normal menu that was full of gluten free foods. We started with a parmisan and truffle french fry that was so good it didn't need anything to dip. The chef then brought us a plate of home cut chips smothered in bacon and a cheese sauce that was amazing, just because it was our first time in. Our meals came and they were lovely. I had the grilled salmon and my husband a burger. They were cooked perfectly, but just to double check the chef came to check on us one last time. I'm happy to say this is the best dining experience we have had in a while and we will be back. They take great pride in their service and food.

Thank goodness because this California girl just does not like grits. But the reason for going, their namesake, is the biscuit. They are to die for. I've been known to order an extra biscuit, they're that yummy! They're served with their own cranberry apple spread. So good! The place is packed on weekends, but don't let the wait deter you.
