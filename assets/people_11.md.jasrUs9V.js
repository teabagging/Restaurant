Then after i got too grown for sunday school, I use to drive from the tron to fufill my craving. \\nThen i discovered there was one in Milwaukie, which isn't any closer to the tron, but if i find myself there in milwaukie, i could get an amazing burrito or if i was real hungry, a plate of super nachos.\\nSo long ago, the Milwaukie SB (super burrito) was in an old tasty freeze building. From the outside it looked like a meth house. Like horrifying, and if i didn't already know how magical this place was, i probably wouldn't have gone on my own. Now its sparklingly new, and shiny and i live much closer, so im there like once a week.\\nBut lets get down to it shall we?\\nIve seriously probably after 15+ years of going here have tried a lot of their menu. \\nNot all, cause i have my favorites. So I'll make a blanket statement of most Everything on the menu is delicious.\\nHere are my top picks as to what you'll drive across town for.\\n\\nBean and cheese burrito- i know!!! But seriuosly satifying. You say \\"no orian i wont drive across town for something so simple i can make at home\\" \\noh but you will because you cannot find a substitute. Solid choice for under $4 and usually enough for two meals or a very full belly. Im going to be honest im pretty sure this isnt vegetarian. Sorry.\\n\\nHard tacos(dorados) perfection in a shell. In a very small shell, stuff perfect shredded beef almost halfway, deep fry, shove a fistful of cheese in it, top with lettuce & tomatoes. \\nUnder $2 a piece, you'll want 4, but you'll stop at two, these don't keep though so you better eat them right away.\\n\\nSame with-\\n\\nSuper nachos w/beef - you can get any meat or no meat (get the meat) imagine your idea of perfect nachos. Does it look like an enormous pile off fresh made chips, mounds of shreded griddle beef, two grips of cheddar, beans, avacado sauce and sour cream? If it's not, your vision on nachos might be flawed and you should eat these. Also did i tell you this pyramid of food is under $8? Youll want to eat these there, cause they get soggy otherwise.\\n\\nChorizo burrito- meat with onions, little egg, beans, a mound of cheese, two handed burrito. Its greezy, like real greasy and amazing.\\n\\nCarnitas taco- two tortillas, crispy pork, lime, cilantro, onion.  Rich. \\n\\nAny of the burritos, literally all of them are insanely good, same for tacos. Ive heard people gripe that they don't put rice in the burritos, personally i can go either way, but you gotta have good beans, you just have to for me to even count you as a good burrito, and their beans are seriously the best.\\n\\nIts pretty awesome to feed a group for so little monies and such good food, But I'd go there even if the price doubled, and I'd go across town. i have found none the same as my super burrito.

I always allow for a bit of a time buffer, so after 45 minutes rolled by, I decided to check and see where we were on the list. The hostess gave me a noncommittal answer, \\"Oh, we just have to clear out a couple of tables; it shouldn't be much longer.\\" \\n\\nWe waited around a little more. After an hour went by with no news, I went back up and said we'd be moving on. The hostess asked why, and I said, \\"well, we're pretty hungry, and it's been an hour, not a half an hour. And you didn't sound like we'd be getting seated anytime soon.\\" The hostess told me the clientele was hanging around longer than they usually expect, probably to watch the entertainment. I went back to tell my wife, and within two minutes our buzzer went off--we had a table! \\n\\nNow, the food is overpriced, but it's Disney. Everything there is overpriced. But I loved it. I had a Kilkenny Irish Cream Ale to the tune of $7, and the extremely delicious Bangers and Booz. My wife had the Shepherd's Pie.

The complimentary soda bread and Guinness reduction oil dipping sauce is outstanding, as well. \\n\\nOverall, it's great, if you can get in. I'm glad we waited, but we almost didn't. Sure, it's got a bit of that theme park veneer on it, but the place and its food is far, far more sincere than it has any need to be. It could be Lucky Charms-Irish and still pull in good money.

We struggled with wanting to give this place 5 stars but have a few complaints. First, when we entered there was a huge crowd of people at the door and a lack of organization in getting people checked in for their reservations and to a table. I'm unsure if their computers were down or if they always use a pen and paper system.. But if it's the latter, then cmon. Secondly, it was 32 degrees outside and we were seated at a table that was next to a door to the patio that employees kept leaving open. After ordering our drinks a staff member then came over and asked if we would be willing to move to a different table (even closer to the door) so they could accommodate a larger party. I found this continued disorganization to be a bit ridiculous. Finally, we are both hip hop loving millennials but the overall atmosphere of this place (decor, food, etc) just DID NOT match with the blaring hip hop music. It felt very out of place and very confused. We struggled to want to like this but just really felt it wasn't the place for it. The trend of loud hip hop music in nice restaurants is becoming a bit of an overkill. I want to be able to talk to the person I'm with if I'm going to a nice, romantic, pricey restaurant.\\n\\nNow for the GOOD:\\nThe food is EXCELLENT. We ordered the patatas bravas, spiced meatballs, manchego croquettes, duck breast, and roasted baby carrots. I have absolutely zero complaints about the food, it checked all of the boxes. The wine was also excellent. And aside from the initial service at the door and moving tables, the service was excellent. Finally, we were surprised with how affordable we considered the meal to be given the quality of the food. Our bill for 5 tapas (we both left full and happy) and 2 glasses of wine was $66 dollars. I would still rate it $$$ our of 4, but you can definitely make this an affordable nice date night meal."},{"name":"Whole Heart Provisions","address":"487 Cambridge St","city":"Allston","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is soooooo good:) So much better than Life Alive.\\nI had their Tazon bowl with Jasmine rice and if you are craving a fruity, veggie and crunchy dish this one is for you. It does lack a creamy factor compared to the Cassie bowl per say so you might want to add avocados. The creamy factor from the beans was enough for me though.\\nThe ingredients are fresh and compliment each other so well.

It's just a pure, natural, and great way to be. I've checked this out a few times this past year and enjoyed everything I tried:\\n\\n-Off the breakfast list ~ Buckwheat pancakes: these were delightful. At first bite, by themselves, they feel like the beginning of the body nourishing itself. And if you want to enjoy the toppings to taste, go ahead and add some coconut whip (smooth!) and/or maple syrup. There were some other sprinkled toppings but not sure if that was dark cacao nibs (had a similar earthy bitterness). Buckwheat muffins: Pleasantly plump, moist, and subtle flavor; kinda like the way I like things, in general.\\n-Off the share plates list ~ Baked yam fries: mmm! Nice thick cut pieces; not too small or too big; one bite equaled one pleasant chewing session. These were just right to me and the sauce seemed to compliment it pretty well.\\n-Off the main eats list ~ The classic stuff on toast: Good, satisfying, and balanced (some places seem to have too much avocado/goop or not enough). Any oil in the pesto (if any) was minimal and didn't leave wet trails.\\n~Forgotten Notes ~ I'm pretty sure I tried 2-3 other items but don't recall. I do remember similar food notes as others; maybe a bit bland, not much flavor, etc. This is just me but that could natural in some cases as that's what helps you focus on the food itself; not covering up with excess seasonings and/or other crazy ingredients; plus, I think it's more body-friendly, overall.\\n\\nThe staff I've met are all wonderful people. I've had cool conversations at the front bar counter waiting for takeout and pleasant chats with a blond/brunette(?) lady while snacking on the yam fries chilling at one of the cool round tables.\\n\\nThere's plenty more I'd like to try and wish this positive space a long, fun and prosperous future."},{"name":"Arden's Garden","address":"985 Monroe Dr NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Okay, I'm from Cincinnati and very upset that their products are sold only in Atlanta.

I live in Houston, but I'll make sure to come here when I'm in San Antonio or Austin. Here's why-\\n\\n1. It's a Texas tourist hot spot, but unlike Franklin's or Rudy's the flavors live up to the hype.\\n2. Speaking of the flavors, the meat is extremely tender, potatoes are great, bread is served warm, and it's nearly impossible to deny homemade pecan pie or peach cobbler a la mode. I love their BBQ sauce, it's not vinegary like many chain places but it still has a super nice kick to it. \\n3. The BBQ pit, which you actually can smell from quite far away, is on display as you walk to your picnic style table. The boys working back there are sweating from the rich smoke that is bringing your brisket, ribs, and sausage to perfection.\\n4. You're going to wait awhile to get a table, especially if UT is playing, but there is a lot of space outside to sit, watch football, and have a beer or two. Salt lick is BYOB, but they sell alcohol outside the restaurant for those who decide to booze once they get here.\\n5. Staff is busy, but also manages to stay super friendly. You're here to have good food, not 5 star service, so it's best to accept that it may take awhile for your server to get back to you. On that note, they do tend to be quicker than other massive BBQ places. \\n6. Cash only, no split checks. As someone who's waited tables, this is a good business move for a large scale/quick turnover place. For customers, it may not be as efficient, but they DO have ATMs on site. \\n7. Order ribs, try the hot sauce, and treat tousled to some pecan pie a la mode. You won't regret it."},{"name":"Stone Soup Kitchen","address":"584 Woodward Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We went to Ria's right around the corner but they were closed for vacation so we tried this place.

Making the drive out to Driftwood has made our relationship a bit more difficult than I'd hoped it would be. I don't mind hauling my own beer along, cause I know that's just how you roll.

You don't even have to present me with many options, I only have eyes for you and your family style ways. Keep the meat tender and moist and the bread fresh and I will have no shame in shouting my love for you from the rooftops (between mouthfuls of brisket, that is). \\n\\nOne thing I have to ask, why do you put so much pepper in your coleslaw? It's like you went into a room with your slaw, lots of pepper and a big fan to blow the pepper all around the room.

And only a handful, about 20 people or so, can say the same as me.  Last night marked a great day for the future of Antico pizza and I will breifly tell you the story now.\\nMy wife and some friends arrived at Antico about 9:30 at night.  When we arrived we were greated by a cop guarding the front door.  When we started to walk toward the front door the cop told us that the restaurant was closed.  Closed! I heard this before because when they run out of ingredients they stop serving or close because they do not want to substitute anything for the delicouse italian ingredients.  Ok, so its closed, but the cop then ased us however, \\"if you want free pizza just walk around the back door.\\"  What the hell? Just walk around back for free pizza, sure thing Mr. Cop.  \\nSo as we walked around back there were about 20 or some odd people standing around with solo cups filled with champagne, and a wooden table stacked high with sheet trays of pizza.  We were not sure what to think of this so we whent inside to find out what was going on.  Here we found the owner walking around with a bottle of wine and fat cigar in his mouth, there was party conffeetti everywhere and it was loud.  I wasnt sure what to do so i wakled up to the counter and asked \\"how can i pay, or can i just have a pizza\\", the Honduran cook told me to take this, as he handed me a sheet tray of pizza and to walk out side.  Like crows on a decade rabbit, people started flawking to the pizza, I was able to grab a slice, but litterly within 30 seconds it was gone. \\nSo more pizza came and so did the champagne, so finally I asked the cook what was going on.  In broken  english he said they were celebrating being the number 1 pizzaria in atlanta.  But not just that, after about half an hour the owner, his brother, his son, a georgia congressman, and a restaupaneour were standing in front of us 15 or 20 people and started talking about why tonight was so special.  The owner stated that he had a new business partner, but not just any business partner, he was the man who started such restaurants as LongHorn Steakhouse, Hooters, and Outback.  He was there to say that he was glad to come out of retirement to start franchising Antico and to make sure that the WORLD knows how special Antico is.  After a 30 minute speech from both the owner and this business man, the owner was in tears and the few of us fortunate enough to be there were applauding as he shot conffetti across the room and into the crowd.  \\nSo let the rest be history.  The future is very bright for Antico.

Casual and clean, with definite personality.  The service was impeccable and the perfect about of friendly and informative.  I'm sad that I can't remember our server's name because I made the point to ask so I could give her a shout out, but in case management ends up reading this, she was a brunette with a unique sounding name, working on the night of Wednesday, March 26.  She was great!\\n\\nThe menu is eclectic southern food, with great daily specials you'll find out once you get there.  One of the specials the night we went was \\"Buttermilk Fried Brussels Sprouts\\" - they turned out to be fried in not only a buttermilk batter, but also Frank's red hot, and sprinkled with blue cheese.  It was easily one of the single best fried and/or veggie dishes I've had at any restaurant in this country in a couple years.  So memorable I took a picture to add here and I'm talking about it to whoever will listen weeks later.  PUT IT ON THE REGULAR MENU!!!!!\\n\\nThe cajun tasso ham hush puppies were interesting - well done, but not really our favorite flavor profile.  My boyfriend - who hates seafood - thought they were a little fishy, wondering if they were fried in the same oil as fish.  I thought not, but meh.\\n\\nI got the mustard seared catfish entree (another special), which was served with a side salad, baby shrimp relish, and fried sweet potatoes.  It was excellent (though the fish could have been more mustardy), and TONS of food.  Our friend got the burger, which he loved, and my bf got the coca cola glazed cajun meatloaf with garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli.  The broccoli was huge (trees!), the mashed potatoes were butteriffic and perfectly garlicky, and the meatloaf.  Ooooooh man the meatloaf.  This dish is amazing.  It is SPICY.  It is sweet.  It's huge, and it's delicious.  If you're interested, you should get it.  We also got some cornbread, which came in an ample portion with awesomely interesting molasses butter.  \\n\\nI took half of my food home with me, and couldn't wait to eat it all again the next night (which, of course, I did.)\\n\\nI can't wait to go back and try many more things on the menu, especially their fried chicken which looked amazing on the table next to us.  For brunch perhaps atop a waffle?  I can't check right now, but I'm betting they do this (and if not, obv. they should)\\n\\nWe finished by splitting the peanut butter banana pie three ways, and it was the perfect decision, especially since I could have demolished an entire one myself it was that good.  \\n\\nI can't recommend Estelle's highly enough!"},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Pretty standard.

Atlanta does not have good pizza for lunch. Who does not know that? Apparently, everyone who's ever dined at Antico Pizza. This near Georgia Tech Neopolitan pizza place should be on the radar of anyone looking for good pizza.\\n\\nThe restaurant is in a largely automotive/industrial area of Home Park east of Georgia Tech. The area looks fine for lunch, but I wouldn't recommend a date night here at night. \\n\\nThe interior is completely open. You order at a counter adjacent to a large open air dining room which includes the kitchen. We ordered the Margherita and the Pomodorini Pizzas. My colleagues recommended just water as apparently the canned soft drinks are very pricey.\\n\\nSo we sit down at a wooden picnic table next to an open air kitchen with the two pizza ovens.  There is a water fountain -- yes I said water fountain like 4th grade -- where you can fill a plastic cup. Then they lay the pizzas in front of you and have a large brown paper towel roll for you to tear off pieces and eat from -- like no plates. Plus, they give no silverware to cut the pizza with or to eat with. So you'll fold it up like you would up North.\\n\\nAt this point, the pennants of Naples soccer teams and Fox Soccer Plus are not nearly enough to make up for the indifference of the ambiance. And then the pizzas arrive. The tomatoes on the Pomodorini are divine. Sweet and slightly acidic, on top of a cheesy cheese? with a crust that's well cooked. (Which is odd because it arrives like minutes after you order.)\\n\\nThe Margherita pizza is good. Classic rendition, except in lieu of actual tomatoes, there's sauce and cheese. I'd prefer a more refined version that has buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes along with the sauce, but that's a personal preference. The pizza is well worth the trip.\\n\\nI am told by others that this place can get ridiculously crowded during lunch. (I didn't see that.) And like most other places, the service after being served is nothing to write home about.

The seafood was okay and lobster portion was small.\\n\\nAll in all, we may have fell victim to the tourist trap that is Giacomo's.

Cons: the location on school street feels tired and old when seated in the lower section.

Yes, it is fun, vibrant, and always crowded, but the beets (beet salads are so 2011) taste like they come out of a can. And, tapas are so 2008.  Of course, why would you expect any differently from a restaurant located in a city where the public transit system has 2 train lines?  \\n\\nAdmittedly, the bar is fun.  The crowd is actually diverse and interesting, unlike many restaurants in Atlanta.  Plus, it is behind the belt line, always has a lively vibe, and has a perfect patio for a nice weather day.  \\n\\nMy opinion is that people need to raise their standards.   I don't get it when a restaurant gets away with (kinda expensive) mediocre food (might as well eat at Fellini's for a quarter of the price or drive a corolla).  And I don't get the 1990s Gap blousy button down shirts tucked into jeans as a uniform for the staff.  \\n\\nGo to Barcelona to drink, be merry, and maybe eat some cheese.

The drive to Driftwood was quite lovely-rolling hills and greenery.  We pulled up to the Salt Lick, and it was NOT what I expected.  This is no meat shack in the woods-it is a sprawling, palatial meat estate with multiple buildings to hold the stacks and stacks of meat.  Full disclosure: I did not eat meat for two years, and BBQ is not my most fave meal.  I was intrigued by this journey but not particularly enthused at the prospect of meat meat and more meat-I typically find BBQ and brisket to be flavorless.  That was just context for later:)  We pulled into the dirt driveway, and, like I said, this place was so so pretty!  Lots of outdoor seating that would be great on a sunny day (not ideal for that drizzly, sad little Sunday).  We put our names down and headed out to see the rest of the grounds.  The restaurant is HUGE-split into two buildings with rows and rows of picnic tables.  We ventured towards Salt Lick Cellars, and we were just beginning to fall under the spell of its charm (translation: we had been inside for all of 3 minutes) when our buzzer rang, indicating it was chow time.  We scurried back to the main building and were escorted to our seats.  We ordered, and the food was brought QUICKLY. I ordered a two meat plate (turkey and sausage).  The sausage was buttery, flavorful, and tasty tasty.  The turkey was moist and delectable.  The side dishes-potato salad and cole slaw-were fine.  The potato salad started to resemble more \\"mashed potatoes\\" than \\"potato salad\\", and, for that reason, I was not a fan of the cold temperature.  Had there been more of a mayonnaise base and less \\"mashed potato\\" consistency, then the cold temp woudl be fine.  Since it resembled mashed up taters, the cold temperature threw me off.  For dessert, spouse and i split blackberry/peach cobble combo-tasty! Warm with a GIANT scoop of ice cream on top!

Every time I go, it gets better and better.  This place is more than just good eats; it's quickly becoming my favorite stress-busting, spa-like, (not-so)guilty pleasure of choice.  I'm hooked.\\n\\nI first went to SoHo for lunch in the early spring.  Sitting out in the sun-room, drinking a wonderful (half) glass of Le Creme Chardonnay (I'm a total lightweight), I didn't think it could possibly get any better.  But I ordered the eggplant curry.  I was worried because even though I love eggplant curry, the kind I have tried before were very gooey and buttery.  This was nothing like that.  It was so light and fresh and flavorful.  It was almost too good to be true!  The chickpea and scallion pancakes were savory and went well with the curry.  For only $9, it's a winner!   \\n\\nMany weeks later, I still found my mouth watering at the faint thought of that delicious meal.  I had to go back.  The perfect occasion was a furlough Friday.  In the midst of personal, economic recession, I am still able to find complete serenity in that lovely sun-room...and a glass of Urbans Riesling.  Gosh that stuff is good!  This time, I opted for the crab cake salad.  Absolute bliss.  Again, I was slightly worried because it came tossed in a creamy goat's cheese and serrano dressing.  I asked for the dressing on the side, but I found that the dressing, though creamy and flavorful, was not too heavy.  It was the perfect consistency of smooth and delicate.  I would not worry about asking for the dressing on the side in the future; everything they do is just right.  The meal was perfectly satisfying, but I was interested in dessert!  Now, I'm a sucker for hot banana and they had it!  Wonderful sweet bananas, rolled in crunchy macadamia nuts and  fried tempura style with honey on top!  Be still my little heart!!!\\n\\nLast week, my cat died.  I was devastated.  At that point, I knew that the only thing that could help alleviate the blues would be a visit to SoHo. I was right.  A few glasses of delicious wine, some of their bread with awesome herb butter, and the perfect meal of juicy, Dijon chicken with goat cheese Yukon potatoes and the crispiest green beans was enough to bring me out of the misery. Heavenly.  I would have liked to continue drowning my sorrows in a wonderful dessert, but we called it quits before I was able to jump off the diet cliff.  *whew*\\n\\nThough SoHo can be a little pricier than most restaurants I frequent, they make fantastic foods with service to match.

Fresh, well prepared and presented. Service also attentive. Great for groups or family gathering. \\n\\nThis restaurant is not for people like me who have been spoiled living in Asia for decades. But for people who doesn't know what Thai food is, authentic is irrelevant. As long as the restaurant provides well prepared food, everyone will be happy. That is the game rule of the town."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I've been wanting to try this place for months and finally convinced the boyfriend to go for lunch today.\\n\\nYes, it's an expensive pizza. But the ingredients are clearly well above par so I believe it was more than worth the extra few dollars. Plus you can BYOA. And who can complain about a BYOA restaurant with no corkage fee?\\n\\nWe ordered the  Margarita with sausage and proceeded into the kitchen, got a table front row and watched them make it. Please eat in the kitchen, that's half the fun of this place. I promise, it's really, really cool.\\n\\nThe pizza was fantastic. Beyond fantastic. As others have mentioned, the dough is chewy and crispy and light and perfect. I could eat about 10lbs of just dough. Well, probably not, but seriously, so good. The tomato sauce was good, the basil was delicious and so fresh, and the cheese was scrumptious. There is a little self-service station to the right of the dough-tossing station in the kitchen with containers of fresh parmesan cheese, peppers, fresh garlic, salt, and pepper flakes. I didn't try any of the peppers, but Matthew assured me that they were very, very hot. Good for those with colds this time of year.\\n\\nI cannot wait to go back to try more of the pizza! The next one on my list was the one that our neighbors had with little grape tomatoes and lots of cheese (I think it's the Pomodorini). My one complaint is that the front service girls are seemed to be very short. We waited at the counter for quite a bit of time before they acknowledged us, which always irks me, especially when getting a $23 pizza! Other than that, everyone we interacted with was very personable and more than accommodating. \\n\\nA warning: if you don't like Naples-style pizza, you won't like this place. It's not at all Americanized Pappa Johns style stuff. The dough in the center is going to be a little more underdone, the sauce will not be as thick as you're used to (unless your mom is Italian), and the ingredients will probably make a run for it when you pick it up. It's not undercooked or anything like that, that's just how they do it in Naples."},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"12 Farnsworth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious, quick food and lovely service.

One of my favorite aspects of the event was the education on our protein sources. Tony really inspired me to reconsider the options that we're faced with on a day-to-day basis. He told us that \\"if you're eating a chicken breast and it's not delicious, it's not a good chicken.\\" The heritage chicken breast that I ate was definitely the best I've ever had.  \\n\\nReally wish they had more events like this!

Now on to the food...as we all know, Salt Lick is most known for their $25 family-style AYCE. This includes unlimited beef brisket, sausage, pork ribs, potato salad, cole slaw and beans. Sounds too good to be true eh? However, we passed on this amazing deal and opted to order meat by the lb instead since the family style didn't include the beef ribs. We ordered 1/2 lb of every meat and a side of pinto beans between the two of us. I was disappointed with the beef ribs. It came out mostly burnt and not palatable. As for the sausage, it was juicy but a bit on the salty side. I wasn't able to eat it by itself but luckily there was bread to balance it out. On the other hand, the brisket and pork ribs were packed with flavor and cooked perfectly. The brisket was moist as requested and the meat on the pork ribs falls right off the bone. Salt Lick indeed offers good BBQ, however I was expecting a bit more since I came with high expectations.

The menu changes often enough that I don't know if the pork 3-ways or the scallops poached in oil and curry are even offered anymore, but if they are, you really have to try them.\\n\\nI only have one very minor criticism, but it's nothing that would ever stop me from going again, or even take it down to a 4-star review:. If you make a reservation, request to sit on the perimeter of the room, or at least not in the very middle. The rest of the dining room seemed so cute and cozy, but we were smack in the center.

We were initially seated on the left side of the restaurant across from the kitchen. Me and my fiance enjoyed coffee while we waited for our guests. The server was extremely pleasant and professional. When our guests arrived, they requested that we be seated on the other side of the restaurant(away from the kitchen). Our server was very gracious and re-seated us. \\n\\nWhat happened after that was a completely different story. It was like being at a different place all together. We had a female server who made every effort possible to let us know that we weren't welcome. She was cold and abrupt. No pleasantries, not even hello. She just came to our table and coldly asked if we knew what we wanted. Both our guests wanted, Omelette and gosh what an unreasonable request that was. She scowled at them both for a good few seconds, shrugged and rolled her eyes and told them it could be done- but didn't elaborate. After an awkward silence, my guests asked if they could put onions, peppers? ham? she said \\"no\\" \\"no ham\\". \\"erm, can you do onions and peppers\\". \\"hmmm\\".(which was her way of saying yes). We were so mortified! these were our guests who we'd basically dragged to this \\"amazing place'. There was no sugar on our table and when we asked our server we got another one of those priceless scowls. \\n\\nThe food was okay, nothing mind blowing. coffee and donuts were nice. my burger was good. It wasn't 'No 9 Park' good but i enjoyed it.  of course the server never asked if we enjoyed our food or anything. Just brought us the check. She didn't even introduce herself (maybe to avoid being named on yelp:p) \\n\\nI still don't understand what was up with her. Maybe it was the fact that we re-seated? Maybe she's a newbie who thinks being rude and disrespectful is part of the job description at a fancy restaurant. I'd recommend she take a trip to Daniel in upper east Manhattan. They have 3 Michellin stars and are every bit worth all of them. Not only is the food spectacular, but the service is un-freakin-believable.

Exceptional service, on all levels, deserves a fifth star of its own. \\n\\nThe staff at Standard Hall were on the ball! Having planned for such a big group of Yelpers, I made a reservation for their enclosed, heated patio seating so we would have enough space. Ryan Bing, SH's Operations Manager, was outstanding. Together, both him and Christopher (SH Manager) worked to make space for us, were glad to come introduce themselves to the group, and gave a little history about ST and dropped in a teaser about their newest restaurant concept coming to downtown Columbus. Superb customer service, WITH a smile! \\n\\nChelsea serviced ALL 3 of our packed tables. She has a wonderful, enthusiastic personality. She, and the staff in general, checked in all the right times. Very accommodating. Being 22 people in our party, I didn't hear about any major mix-ups or royal screw-ups. Made for a great time. \\n\\nWe were treated to a few appetizers, and let me tell you folks, the soft pretzel and warm, gooey, beer cheese was so so sooo good. The doughy delight is made fresh in-house, none of those frozen concession stand pretzels that harden after 3 minutes. I loved the cheese! And other people loved the mustard dip. Not what you're thinking, which apparently made for a unique tasty twist. The loaded nachos and buffalo chicken dip also hit the spot. \\n\\nBloody Mary Bar: Wow. Just, wow! $6 for a virgin BM. Of course, that still comes with unlimited trips to the beautiful set-up SH has going: three tomato mixtures to pick from, rim-salts to pick from, and toppings, oh so many glorious toppings to enhance the glass. Tip: leave plenty of room in your glass mug, cause your gonna want to try, well, every accoutrement on that bar-top. Personal must-get's: Fresh horseradish, stuffed olives, carrot slices, dill pickle, BACON!, bbq weenies, and a giant onion ring. Drink. Enjoy. Repeat. \\n\\nFood. Two words: Breakfast Pizza.

Bacon, scrambled egg, corn, roasted red peppers, soft chewy crust, durable bottom (didn't have to deal with soggy slices!). A well-made, and we'll-enjoyed, entree!\\n\\nTop it off: Boozy popsicles. Four flavors. Not huge, a perfect size to wet your mouth and leave you feeling refreshed. Personal fav? Pina Colada.  \\n\\nOutstanding Sunday Brunch.

Hats off to the chef! The steak and Guiness pie was simply perfect. My only regret is that I wasn't eating it on a cloudy day in the rain. This pie just screams for a pint and some cool weather. It also screams to be eaten long after you're full too. The curry chicken is the perfect blend of spices that has a hint of heat but mostly is a new twist on comfort food for an American. The chicken with broccoli and cheese was pretty good too but made even better with some curry gravy drizzled over top. They keep some of that on hand for chips apparently. Quite tasty! \\n\\nAs Americans we get snapshots of other country's signature dishes that sometimes don't tell the whole story. I'm not sure how fish and chips became what we think of when we think of England considering the BBC claims that curry is the national dish.

The turkey is WORTH it--delicious.  Between two light eaters, it was almost enough.  We added a plate of brisket burnt ends (excellent) to achieve BBQ stuffedness.  The warm, fresh bread is not made there, but so soft and tasty you'll make a little noise the moment you touch it.  We had two servings, thank you.  Pickles and sauces all excellent.  Desserts (pies/cobblers a la mode)--worth getting fat for. \\n\\nService so good: i tipped double. \\n\\nThe only lackadaisical elements were the three sides they have available: Vinegar cole slaw, Creamy potato salad, and baked beans.

My biggest complaint is that they never seem live up to the hype (or the price tag), and I'm always let down by the food, service and dining experience.  Ruth's Chris, however, has proven to be an exception to this rule, and I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised.\\n\\nWe stumbled in late on a Thursday evening, famished and slightly tipsy.  Front of house service was excellent, and we were quickly seated in a downstairs dining room.  Our server, Kate, quickly identified us as \\"THAT table,\\" and took our drink orders (ensuring that we would remain \\"THAT table\\").  She did a masterful job matching her personality to the personality of the table, and was spot on with service and recommendations throughout the evening.\\n\\nDinner took a little longer to arrive than I would have liked, but I must say, good things come to those who wait.  I ordered the bone-in filet with a blue cheese crust, medium rare, and it was everything I had hoped it would be.  I think the chef had erred on the side of rare, especially closer to the bone, which was fine by me, as the texture and temperature were very pleasant on the palate.  The blue cheese crust was very nicely done, savory and flavorful, but subtle (for blue cheese).  Sometimes a blue cheese crust can be a little syrupy and overwhelming, but this was light and crumbly.  I was a big fan.\\n\\nOrdering wine by the glass at a steakhouse is always a crapshoot, but I requested a pairing by the server and got a big glass of The Prisoner, which accompanied my steak perfectly.  I'm now on the hunt for a case for my wine cellar at home.\\n\\nWe also ordered a hash brown potatoes special, which was a big heavy, albeit delicious - the kind of thing you want order to fill the stomach and warm the soul on a cold, damp day.\\n\\nThe sweet potato casserole is the stuff of legends - more of a desert than a side dish, I hear some people order it with ice cream at the end of their meal.  I got the recipe from the kitchen, and will ignore what the half stick of butter will do to my cholesterol and try to make it for Thanksgiving.\\n\\nAnd while I'm not a creamed spinach guy, the table was a big fan.\\n\\nThe cowboy ribeye was also ordered, and I must say, it was quite possibly the juiciest, most tender ribeye steak I think I've ever eaten.\\n\\nI left Ruth's Chris that night with a full stomach and a pleasant smile, relieved the restaurant had lived up to its reputation.  It's now on the list of my go-to Boston steakhouses, and I'm sure I'll be back again soon."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Super hipstery place.

Before our trip to Vancouver, I spend literally hours researching where to eat.  I wanted something fun, trendy, unique, and definitely not a chain.  Chambar seemed to fit that bill and I was so excited to try this place out.  It fell just a little short of my expectations.  \\n\\nWe were seated promptly at our 7:45 reservation and had drinks within minutes.  After perusing the menu for a bit, my husband opted for the steak and I went with the mussels (congolaise style upon the recommendation of our server).  We also ordered some bread with smoked paprika butter to munch on while we waited.  The bread and butter was yummy, though I wish it was complimentary and not $3.  \\n\\nIt was a good thing we didn't order a real appetizer because our entrees came out before we had time to finish the bread.  I thought my mussels fell short of my expectations and I was left with a serious case of food envy because my husband's steak was awesome.  The frites and aioli that they were served with were probably my favorite part about the dish - which is probably not the goal.  The broth tasted tinny - like canned tomatoes and was more or less one note, unless there was some cilantro in the bite, in which case it was two notes.  The description of the dish has so many good flavors in it, but I couldn't taste anything other than metallic tomato.  I was expecting this dish to have a Thai flair to it but it was nothing of the sort.  I left really wishing that I had ordered the Cassoulet de Poisson, my second choice, or that I liked lamb because the lamb tagine smelled and looked fabulous.  \\n\\nTo be fair, there were a ton of mussels and they were all fresh, so perhaps I would have enjoyed one of the other preparations more.  I just felt like this dish had such potential and didn't make it there. \\n\\nThe other disappointment was how fast I felt like we were rushed through our meal.  My husband loves to try new beers and there were a bunch that he was interested in trying but given how quickly our food came out, he didn't have a chance to order another one before our waiter brought out the dessert menu.  \\n\\nWe shared the scotch cake for dessert and that was fantastic.  It jumped out immediately to both of us as something totally unique and we were very glad we ordered it.

Although the venture to Maria's Bakery was more by mandate rather than choice, the large patronage viewed during our initial passing did help skew our decision to visit this establishment.  Thus, we were off to Maria's Bakery for some Italian baked confectionaries prior to dinner...\\n\\nThe Setting:  There isn't much that needs to be emphasized about the decor at Maria's Bakery...  The overall emphasis on the establishment is the rustic / old school feel.  From first entry, patrons will notice that the modest establishment is lit using bright fluorescent lighting, which helps to amplify the white & blue patterned Formica wall panels.  To the immediate right after entry, patrons can view the various sampling of Gelato available for purchase.  Ultimately, Maria's Bakery's emphasis is on their edible offerings, not that of its decor...\\n\\nChocolate Dipped Ricotta Filled Cannoli ($3.00):  Freshly filled to order, the Chocolate Dipped Cannoli possessed an array of textural and flavor contrasts.  Initial consumption of the Cannoli revealed a brilliant fried / flakey crust, which embodied a subtle bread like taste, without being overpowering.  The introduction of the creamy Ricotta filling provided the much welcoming textural contrast to the application.  The slight use of chocolate dipping at the ends of the Cannoli shell added a welcoming cocoa flavor to the application.  Overall, patrons will find an array of flavors stemming from Maria's Ricotta filled Chocolate Dippped Cannoli.\\n\\nStruffoli ($5.00):  Perhaps this was a bad batch, nevertheless...  The Stuffoli failed to deliver.  At initial consumption, patrons will find the excessive sweet flavors of the honey coating to be the initial observation of this application.  Further consumption of the Struffoli will reveal that the inner confines of the edible to be terribly dry.  The flavor contrast from the exterior of the Struffoli to that of the interior provided an unpleasant distortion of flavors.  Although the initial taste of the Struffoli was welcoming, the burdensome excess of the desiccated and flakey interior was not complemented or reprimanded by the honey exterior coating.\\n\\nOverall, the Cannoli was one of the best I've consumed.

I had happened to leave my card there and had to email the establishment about it because there was no one to answer the phone, it was just a recording. They said to just come in with my ID and I would easily get it back. I go in the following Wednesday, head up to the bar to get it. The bartender was nice and asked to see my ID just to verify the name. Him and the manager have taken 7 minutes now retrieving my card, but I just figured it was because they were busy. The manager comes over and asks to see my ID again, I hand it over politely. He then starts questioning me as to why my card was opened up under a tab. Then, he starts passive aggressively accusing me of underage drinking in his establishment, when in reality all I had bought was 10 boneless wings. I kept asking him to pull up my receipt but he refused to do so and was holding my credit card from me so I couldn't leave and had to listen to what he had to say. Once he saw that I was 19, he started treating me like a child. I understand that underage drinking is a problem, but it is wrong of a manager to not only accuse someone of it, but to FALSELY accuse someone of doing so without even looking at their receipt. I was shaking with anger at the fact he was just blatantly saying I tried to pull one over on the waitress, when in reality she wasn't Making anyone show their ID.

The crust is paper-thin which could be a good or bad thing. It's good because your not scarfing a ton of carbs/sugar, the dough doesn't take over the whole flavor (I'm looking at you Pizza Hut), and you don't feel that guilty inhaling almost a whole pizza. It's bad because if you are sharing your pie with others, one, two, or even three slices might not cut it out. I felt like I could have easily eaten 3/4 of a pie on my own!  am not one of the those girls who think it's cute to pretend I don't eat I know it doesn't look like it but I EAT! Other than the super thin crust, they don't really overload on the cheese. I LOVE THAT!  It's just a perfect blend of flavors. It's delicious, but I still like Fritti's a little better because you can get a personal size for less money and leave feeling satisfied. The crust is thin at Fritti's also. I feel like Antico's large pizzas are just slightly larger than a personal size at Fritti's.\\n\\nService: Lackluster and basic. Don't expect any special treatment. They are not working for tips here. However, the pizza came out super fast. It seems as if as soon as we ordered our pizzas they were popped out of the oven at our table. I found myself wondering if they read our minds before we ordered. We did happen to go during a lull time when there were no lines out of door and parking was easy to find. I guess the lull time would be any time after 8:30 pm on week days except Friday. \\n\\nAtmosphere: Really loud and casual. Feels like a high school cafeteria.  Only decor I noticed were some random ads and a comic strip behind on the cash register showing Americans how Italians eat pizza. You can see the guys making the pizza and I like that. It means they won't try any funny business with your food. \\n\\nDessert: No-frills and delicious. Only place in the city that I know of that you can get such good tiramisu in a cup. They also have chocolate mousse and something that looks like pistachio cream in cups also. They have cannolis and biscotti, but they looked old like they had been sitting out in the display case all day. \\n\\nThe menu is in Italian. If you don't know what anything says, the safest bet is Margherita which is just Italian style cheese pizza at it's finest.  I love the whole basil leaves on it.\\n\\nI would go back but most likely only for pickup. Unless you are with a group , I wouldn't suggest eating at the restaurant.

Interesting scene for lunch, but certainly fit for a seal-the-deal kind of evening adventure.\\n\\nLocation directly across the street from the Broadway station should help this place out.  But first, they've got to do something about the odd facade that still evokes yet another Broadway Irish bar.\\n\\nFor all the ambitions for glamour, food prices were surprisingly reasonable.  Lunch specials ran $8.95, and included an excellent sushi combo with a six-piece tuna maki (large cubes of purposefully cut fish, not a menage of scraps as attempted by lesser establishments), with four assorted pieces of nigiri.  Flavor and texture were nicely done, a little bit more dense than Teriyaki House, it's proletarian next-door neighbor.  Also got the Christmas Roll ($12), with spicy tuna topping a delicately crunchy shrimp tempura roll.\\n\\nApparently there's no consensus on what makes up a Christmas Roll - Thelonius Monkfish in Cambridge offers a much more highbrow version topped instead with salmon roe and seasoned seaweed.

We sat at a large table with several other guests and chatted with everyone until our pie arrived (about 10 minutes). The crust really sells the pizza; it's chewy with a slightly charred outside and excellent flavor. The sweet peppers complimented the salty sausage well. Cheese was on point. \\n\\nI also really liked the condiment bar. Located near the kitchen is a small counter top set up with cheese, pepper, and minced garlic. I used a little of all three on every slice and it was magical.\\n\\nOne of my gripes has to do with drinks, but it's a minor one. The drinks were expensive so we went with water. We could not locate any ice and had to walk back near the bathrooms and pour ourselves tap water into these tiny disposable cups. In other words, I had to make a trip every five seconds to grab room temperature tap water. Not really a huge fan of that. Since everyone sits together at giant tables, carafes or pitchers that could be shared would really help out! Bonus points for being BYOB, though, and I will take advantage of that next time.\\n\\nMy bigger gripe has to do with the fact that, despite it being delicious, the pizza gave me the worst stomach cramps in recent memory and quite a bit of digestive distress.

First and foremost is the quality of the food.  It's also family style, so you get some of everything and then more of whatever you want.  If you're a fan of their ribs, it's just fine to order a bunch more and the same goes for the unbelievable brisket and sausage.  The best side that I've had at a BBQ restaurant was the potato salad.  It's hard to define and even harder to duplicate.  I'd love the recipe...

We started with their shrimp appetizer sauteed in oil and wine with garlic and a big bay leaf.  Sometimes simple is the best way to make great things happen.  \\n\\nNext was their fried wild mushrooms.  An ample portion of hen of the woods, procini, chanterelle and other fresh mushrooms with a nice mildly tangy horseradish sauce. There are not your typical white button fried mushrooms.  \\n\\nMy main course was fresh grouper over rosemary creamed corn with a light frisse salad with truffle infused olive oil.  The fish was cooked perfectly, moist (even though I hate that word), flakey, and a nicely browned surface.  \\n\\nAlso on the table was scallops with a mash and more of those wild mushrooms, a half chicken with the creamed corn but also with sauteed spinach and roasted cauliflower, and a braised short rib that had apparently spent the better part of the day braising.  \\n\\nClean plates all around and shared some home made spiced \\"doughnuts\\" that were nice, warm and pillowy.\\n\\nFor a first night, they certainly impressed.

Maybe the best bartenders in the area. 2) The craft beer prices were way off...Sweetwater 420 was the same price as Allagash. 3) The crowd at the bar was attractive and professional, looks like it could be a hot spot.\\n\\nFor dinner, I had the margherita pizza. I was a little disappointed in the size (very small) and the crust. The toppings were amazing - the crust was just too chewy. It's still a good pie and has lots of potential but with Hearth and Double Zero down the street, I'm not sure if I would go here for pizza again. The rest of the menu looks great.\\n\\nOverall, it's a good new place and I would definitely recommend it if you're looking for tasty handcrafted cocktails in Sandy Springs.

They also have a bunch of German and English/Irish offerings, which should never be overlooked (including Beamish stout, which is like Guinness but better). The beer menu is a true thing of beauty, with many choices on tap plus a wide array of bottles.\\n\\nI went with a really huge group of friends and coworkers, and the waiter was a good sport at serving such a large party.

Lola was very nice and greeted us with the menu and let us know what sides she had. When we ordered, we found out several things she didn't have and was out of at the time.  We did have to change our order a time or two.  It was a little wait from the time we placed our order till the time we were served, but like it has been said, Lola is doing the thang by herself.  And when we got our food, we were satisfied every bit...well almost.  My oldest son is a bit picky and doesn't really appreciate good food.. He ordered the cheeseburger-plain. Lola hooked it up with all the fixins.  But we reminded her and she replaced the bun with no problem and we just scraped the other stuff off. My younger son had the Pork chop breakfast...the pork chop was fried to perfection....a little salty, but it was wonderful..the eggs and potatoes were done well.  My wife had the pork chop dinner with red beans and rice and macaroni.  Again, the pork chop was great. I had the Catfish dinner with red beans and rice and macaroni.  The catfish was fried excellently, none of that dark black stuff in my fish.  We both enjoyed our sides and cornbread.

Upon arriving, you will notice an outside bar with different areas to sit and enjoy the company of your party. You can make the choice to spend your entire evening in this area, or just hang out here while waiting to be seated inside. *disclaimer: I've visited here about 4 times, each time in the evening, and have always had to wait at least 20 minutes to be seated. I suggest you plan for this wait.* Once inside you will find a few different bar areas, tables, booths, high tops as in any other restaurant. The d√©cor is very interesting with elaborate lighting pieces hanging from the ceilings and tribal masks located throughout the entire restaurant. There is a DJ playing all types of music and the later you get there, the more people are up dancing in the front of the restaurant. *disclaimer: the music is really loud in Roccos, so if you're looking for a nice place to have a quite conversation with someone, this is not the place.* There is also an outdoor area for seating which overlooks a lake which is really nice if you have the opportunity to sit there. \\n\\nFood: The food at Roccos isn't that great. Average at best in my experience. I honestly don't have any memory of the different dishes that I've tried other than, \\"this isn't that great, I should have tried something else\\" and each time I go, I try something different and the cycle continues lol...During this last visit I tried the chicken tacos with a side of black beans. I ordered two tacos and they were so lack luster that I declined to eat the second one. They weren't terrible, just not great...they made me think to myself \\"why am I eating this?\\". The black beans were decent. A friend of mine, ordered the nachos which were actually really good and will be my go to item on the menu if I go back. They were covered in cheese and baked. \\n\\nOverall: I give Roccos two stars. Roccos is a restaurant, and while the atmosphere is really fun most people come there to eat and the therefore the food should be good.

This Japanese restaurant, featuring \\"Hibachi\\" (a US term, it's actually teppanyaki - the large metal griddle is called a teppan), traditional Japanese favorites and sushi, is so diverse, good and wonderful that's it's difficult to categorize, other than to describe in general how good everything is. The restaurant has been in Atlanta since 1972 and many other chains can point to Nakato as their birthplace (former employees from Nakato started Kobe and Kampai of Tokyo but there are others)\\n\\nFirst a bit about Japanese cooking - in general there's more of a subtlety to Japanese cuisine to which most Americans aren't aware. The dishes tend to emphasize the flavor and texture of the materials rather than covering everything up with strong sauces and heavy spices. Because of this it's very necessary for all the ingredients and component parts to be extremely fresh. With that philosophy, you can pretty much tell if what you're getting is fresh or not, as the ingredients are either prepared before you or lightly cooked to prevent the destruction of the delicate nuances of flavor in the food. \\n\\nI started going to Nakato roughly 20 years ago - the second time I lived in Atlanta (the first time was in the mid-80s). Some of my friends knew the bartender so we would go for drinks and an appetizer, sitting in their well-stocked bar. Over time we started doing meals there, initially the teppanyaki and sushi, migrating to the traditional dishes and finally going exclusively for the sushi and sitting before Chef Kaki and his staff. We did just that last evening, and were well rewarded with what else but fantastic fish and service.\\n\\nKaki suggested the aji (horse mackerel) and skipjack sashimi - both were fantastic! The skipjack was served on thin sliced onion with Japanese mint and garlic ponzu - the flavors were out of this world. The aji was prepared both sliced and with a slight toss of green onion - the combination of both types of fish created a great balance that complimented one another. These were indeed the stars of this show - we ordered some other nigiri and a couple of rolls just to round things out - all were exceptionally fresh and well prepared.  Add an Asahi Dry and some saki, a house salad and miso and you've got a well-rounded meal.\\n\\nThe service, both by our server and Chef Taki himself, was both excellent, as was the conversation. The Nakato dininig room isn't as loud as most sushi houses you encounter so it wasn't necessary to scream at everyone (something I hate about noisy restaurants). In all the experience was fantastic and something that surprises us whenever we dine there.\\n\\nI'm always hearing a lot about other Japanese restaurants, especially when I hear about the sushi, the chef, etc. I will still go to experience each, as I love food and sushi in particular. However I've never understood why Nakato isn't talked about more - the fish here is some of the best you will ever see - they get drops from Japan that they pick up at the airport. I don't know of many other restaurants in town that do the same. The preparation is top notch, the service exceptional and the location near Piedmont about as centrally located as you can get.

It was confusing where to go but just walk pass the long line of people, go inside and go straight to the cashier. \\n\\nI got the Rancher which was a sampler of all the meat with sides. I wanted to try the pulled pork but the only option of trying that was to get a sandwich which I probably wouldn't be able to finish in addition to the Rancher. The food came out fairly fast and the cashier was really nice when I mentioned they forgot to give me my drink. \\n\\nAll the meats included were really good. It was hard to distinguish what was my favorite even though usually, it's brisket. The brisket here was good but didn't really stand out from any other BBQ place I've tried. Surprisingly though, I may have liked the turkey more. It was different and went perfectly with the BBQ sauce. As for the sausage,  the sausage was delicious. Usually I always order sausage just because and it's usually nothing extraordinary but Salt Lick pretty much has it down here. I don't know what was different but it was really tasty. The pork ribs were cooked well and literally fell off the bone. The sides however were quite disappointing especially since coleslaw and beans were the only options. The beans were ok but the coleslaw was too tangy for my liking. All in all, I am definitely a fan. Don't know when I'll be back but I know for sure I'll be craving Salt Lick sooner than that.

I chose to go there tonight since I had to go pick up my daughter's dog and did not feel like cooking today since I remembered they has a patio area. \\n\\nWhen I arrived I just sat down at a table outside since I was not about to take a dog inside to order. After about 10 minutes one of the servers noticed me and brought me a menu and took my drink order. They have a great selection of beer but I am stuck with my unsweet tea with lime. When she returned I had decided on the Voodoo, Wipeout and Street Taco. I also ordered the Mojo Fries. She asked for my credit card which seemed odd and came back with my order all rung up. I said, \\"How did you know I did not want anything else?\\" and she just laughed and said \\"I'm sorry\\" and walked away. \\n\\nIn about 5 minutes my fries arrived but not my tacos. The Mojo fries were nicely seasoned and the dipping sauce had a good flavor but was a bit watery for fries. If I had been brought some silverware I might have tried pouring the sauce over the fries but I had no such luck. About 10 minutes later my tacos arrived but by then my remaining fries were already cold. \\n\\nI started with the Voodoo taco which has \\"crispy\\" fish, lettuce, pineapple mango and voodoo sauce. To start, the fish was not crispy but flavorful. The waitress recommended the crispy but the shell was soft and not crispy. It was a good tasting taco but rather messy so be prepared to use a lot of napkins. The Wipeout was next and it has Steak and Shrimp, fries, Jack cheese salsa, avocado and Baja sauce. First off the avocado was just one big hunk on top of the taco. With that said I gave up trying how to figure out how to eat it with each bite and just ate it by itself. The meat was mostly shrimp and just one small piece of steak. It had a good flavor but I would have preferred a balance of meat and the avocado in each bite. Last was the Street Taco and I chose the pork version with Guacamole, cilantro, onion, Cotja and Crema served on a toasted corn taco. Unfortunately the taco shell was not toasted. The pork was dripping wet and the shell was soggy. The flavor was again good BUT it was a mess to eat. \\n\\nI had been here 3 other times with my wife and I have to admit that the attention to detail has slipped quite a bit since my last visit here. The servers had NO sense of urgency and unless the people asked for something, they were content to just keep walking. One of the girls actually looked unhappy as she was wiping down the table next to me. I smiled at her just to see her reaction and she just rolled her eyes and turned her head. I said nothing. Since none of the girls even thought my dog would want something to drink I got her water bowl from the trunk of my car since it was right on the other side of the railing, tied asked the girl at the counter for some water for my dog not entering the building. \\n\\nWould I recommend them is the question...  If you are just looking for a place to have finger food and enjoy a beer in a relaxed atmosphere, it is great. The food is not as good as it used to be but it still pretty tasty. The staff however does not seem very concerned about making you feel special because they are just going through the motions from what I saw. This is NOT the same experience I had my last visit here and that was disappointing. I will not be coming back to this location and would not recommend it to people actually expecting customer service.\\n\\nI know I saw a new Jimmy Hula's open up by Gator's Dockside and will give that location a try since it is newer. I suspect that since this location is close to UCF that they are used to getting away with providing bad service to the college kids and not being held accountable. I on the other hand feel that this is a sign that they have a new manager since I was last here that does not hold his staff accountable. That is a shame because it is the closest Jimmy Hula's to me."},{"name":"McCoy's Bar & Grill","address":"9300 Jeff Fuqua Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We are stuck in Orlando after a magical trip to Disney and I'm sick with a cold and our flight is mega delayed.

Chef Ronald created all the recipes himself, and his creativity and love for food shows through his dishes. There's Japanese, Vietnamese, and Chinese influences to just name a few.  Everything was fresh and made to order.  Excellent customer service. If you don't like something, they will be more than glad to give you something else because they truly care about the happiness of their customers.  However, I am glad to say there was not one dish I didn't like.  \\n\\nWe had a sashimi roll w/ no rice, and OMG it was like butter.  There were five different fish in it and just... it was that damn good.  My hubby and I are from Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area, and those cities spoiled us with delicious food.  We love food and being adventurous with it.   \\n\\nWe had taro fries that was served with a spicy and regular ketchup.  They were PERFECTLY crisp, which is hard to do with taro.  I'd prefer those over regular French fries any day.\\n\\nWe ordered their scallion pancake and my god it reminded me of the ones I had back home.  The pancakes were so light, flaky, and crisp.  There were actually LAYERS in the pancake, which means they did it right.  I've had some scallion pancakes elsewhere here in Texas and none of them measured up to this restaurant's version.  It was so damn good we asked for a 2nd order.   No shame!\\n\\nWe also had an avocado kama, and my husband DEVOURED it!  The avocado acted like a butter for the crab but better because it added creaminess that butter just can't give.  Ugh... I want another.\\n\\nWe also had the Szechuan pork belly with a side of rice.   The pork belly with the fresh veggies in a sauce was done right.  Now I judge a chef's skill based on the consistency of their sauce, and it was perfect.  It wasn't gloopy or oily at all.  The sauce was perfectly balanced.  The vegetables were still a little crisp.  And damn... the way they cook their pork belly is just right.  No chewy pieces. The fat from the pork belly was rendered correctly.  Definitely get this!\\n\\nNow... Chef Ronald blessed my husband and I with their pork belly tacos.  I completely regret not ordering this first!  Holy moly... I haven't had a Chinese BBQ sauce that damn good in a long time.  I hadn't paused after my first bite in a long time.  I was blown away by this Chinese BBQ sauce.  It was a nice balance of sweet and salty.  Then he pairs it with pork belly?!  I almost wanted to cry at how good that combination was.  Not to mention that they make their own steam buns!  What?!  It was topped with cilantro and some red onion to balance the richness of the meat and sauce.  You HAVE to order this!  Then get seconds... and thirds if you can!  \\n\\nChef Ronald truly cares about the quality of his food and the experiences of his customers.  You will NOT regret coming here.  My husband and I traveled here from San Antonio, and it was well worth the trip.  This restaurant reminded me a lot of Los Angeles' boldness and creativity and that is Chef Ronald.  Come here if you want excellent food and customer service!  \\n\\nAlso, they have dim sum on the weekends; and if I lived closer I'd totally go.  They do the actual dim sum carts, which makes my heart swoon.  The fact they only do dim sum on weekends is an indication that they make EVERYTHING (yes, even the steam buns) from scratch.  Chef Ronald confirmed that notion, and I will definitely make it a point to come for dim sum one weekend.  \\n\\nDefinitely come here!

Though thai curries have a lot of vegetables in them, chili duck has never skimped on the meat (i usually get chicken) and also give you a pretty sizeable portion of rice.  Granted, I have never actually eaten in the restaurant, but I have ordered take-out at least 5 times in the last year.  The pad thai is ok- nothing super special but pretty average for pad thai.  I really enjoy \\"the duck soup\\", though it is a bit salty.  The broth seems to have a strong soy sauce component, but i almost always get it as my appetizer because it is very good and i've never had it at anywhere else.

Hello there. You look nice tonight. I know EXACTLY what you're doing right now. You've passed Giacomo's and seen the line and you're wondering, what's the big deal? Or you looked it up and thought, maybe I'll go there and as you arrive you see the line and you're thinking to yourself: \\"It's sooooo long, and I'm hungry.\\" You're considering whether or not to wait and you're doing one final sweep through the reviews as you waffle between stay and go. \\n\\nDo yourself a huge favor and stay.

I've had Italians say this is authentic as it gets in the states. In fact, a family from Italy was in line in front of me. They had been in Boston for two weeks and were ready for a taste of home. Where did they go? Here. When I went, I got the calamari which was made with peppers and served with a rich house marina. I also had the butternut squash ravioli which was sweet and savory and delicious in a way I'm sure I can't replicate. There was asparagus in the sauce and O.M.G. it was great. The marscapone cheese sauce struck the balance of being rich but not heavy. My partner had a special, which was a braised short rib ravioli in a savory mushroom sauce. If you like mushrooms, you would really like this dish. We also split a bottle of Italian-made Pino Grigio. They have premium bottles, but most of their wine is $18 a bottle. That's a steal for a place like Giacomo's. Plus they carry my personal favorite house wine, Alamos Malbec. Most of the time, a bottle in the store is $10. So a highly rated restaurant charging $18 is quite reasonable. I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant. It felt intimate and I enjoyed watching the chef cook our amazing food in his copper pans.

Modern decor, high energy vibe, dimmed lights and pop music in the background. \\n\\nThe service was amazing, all the staff was super nice and attentive and relatively fast service. \\n\\nThe food however, I did not find it to be great but rather very mild and subtle in flavor and I don't mean that as if it wasn't spicy but throughout the night all the food was lacking seasoning and kick that Thai cuisine it's very well known for. I've had a lot of Thai food around Orlando and I would honestly rank this place with some of the bottom ones on my list strictly based on the food :-/ if these guys would put out better food they will be a top winner and very hard to beat. \\n\\nI had a Tom Kha soup that I've had at almost every Thai restaurant in Orlando and this was def the worst of them all. It was bland, small, and just lacking flavor overall.\\n\\nNext we had an appetizer that consisted of some fried noodles, shrimp with some tamarind sauce,( my apologies I forgot the name) the shrimp had no flavor and it was a bit tough. it tasted and it was seating on a grill for a long time and it overcooked. \\nThe sauce was good though. \\n\\nMy wife is a big fan of  peanut butter sauce so she order the chicken with the peanut butter sauce but was quickly disappointed when she got some sort of peanut paste instead of sauce. It tasted as if it Came out of a can Instead of fresh-made. \\n\\nWe also order the pineapple fried rice, again not flavor at all on the rice, it was very bland and the meats in there were paled, they had not even a slightest  bit of color nor charred to them. It looked unappetizing. Remember, we eat with our eyes first! and though they have pretty nice presentation of the dishes you can't forget to actually add some pronounced flavors in there. \\n\\nLast I had was the crispy duck with Panang curry and this was the dish that saved the night for me. The duck was actually crispy and the curry was on point but not a lever to wow me but it was enought to make the dish satisfying for me. \\n\\nThe Thai tea sucked here too! and it is real hard to mess that up.\\n\\nI really wanted to like the food in this place when i first walked in since it was such a cool, chill and relaxed vibe but my main focal point is always the food despite how cool a place is, food is the main reason and service coming 2nd I'd frequent a restaurant. This people have the service lock down but food was NOT up to par IMO. I don't think I'll be coming here. Much better Thai food out there."},{"name":"Mast","address":"45 Province St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I've never written a yelp review before, but after my horrible experience last night at mast, I feel compelled to give other diners the heads up. I had been looking forward to dinner at mast all week.. I heard their wood fired pizza was amazing and I couldn't wait to try it. We had a reservation for 8pm, sat right down. The hostess was friendly, and that's pretty much why I gave 1 star. \\n\\nAfter sitting for close to 20 minutes, a waiter had still not come to our table. I was dying of thirst so I had to get up and ask a random waiter if I could please have some water. After that, he realized no one had come to our table and apologized. That was nice, at least he recognized we were forgotten. I thought it would have been smooth sailing from there. \\n\\nNot so much. While our waiter was taking our order, another waiter came over and tried to drop two drinks at our table that we didn't order. That happened two or three times while we were there.. Of course I'd like some extra beverages, but the people that ordered them were probably dying of thirst too. \\n\\nAll the tables around us had bread, but nope, not us. They must have forgotten about us again, so I had to ask. \\n\\nThen my guy's meal came - it was pasta with boar. My pizza didn't come until 10 minutes later. No apology, just dropped it at the table and walked away. We had ordered a bottle of wine- not once did the waiter refill our glasses. And I'm not a snobby diner, I can easily refill my wine glass. But it just added to my annoyance. \\n\\nI was craving the Nutella pizza for dessert. But we couldn't deal with the service any more and decided to just grab the check.  I was a waitress through grad school and understand that Saturday nights can be stressful. I always give the server the benefit because I've been there..

The lack luster menu, flavorless, and poorly prepared food may (?) send Estelle's to an early grave! Unless someone throw's it a life-line, Owner Pay Attention!\\nFirst meal 10 days ago with a friend for dinner; After ordering you are served a comp. plate of pickles (best in a long time, never had pickles like 'em North of the Carolina's) BUT we didn't go there for pickles n' Beer. BTW: They do have a massive beer selection that rivals the establishment across the street! \\nWe shared the oyster app. It was greasy & over-fried (chewy), enough said! My friend had the catfish and said, \\"it's dry and somewhat flavorless\\"! But Greedy me, I HAD to have a bite because I love Southern Fried Catfish. Yes, Shirlock got it right \\"dry n' flavorless\\"! I had the Shrimp Po'Boy, the shrimp were fried \\"ta death\\" think rubber shrimp. The Po'Boy was flavorless and extremely dry. How dry dare you ask? So dry not even the flavorless \\"slaw\\" on it added enough moisture to get it down. I needed H2O with every bite in order to swallow, gulp!. Yes, ketchup was on the table but I just didn't feel like a shrimp n' ketchup Po'Boy, Yuck! Dessert menu was very limited. We unfortunately opted for the \\"moon pie\\". It didn't taste or look much better than a gourmet packaged over the counter woopie- pie. However, it will set you back $7, over-priced & unimaginative! Entrees n' app's are priced reasonably, IF you like them. \\n\\nOn my second visit I went for the much-touted brunch I've read about on Yelp.\\nNot to me, Nope ..... no sir'ee, not to me!\\nThree (3) eggs, home fries, toast and marmalade $10, what, really(??). Ok, I ordered my eggs over easy & that would have been all three of them! Two had very hard well done yokes, the third was over-medium and I think that may have been a mistake, lucky me! It's difficult to imagine when plated it wasn't noticed that the yokes weren't moving. I know when I plate up egg's at home I sure can tell when an egg's cooked hard n' dry instead of with a soft yolk and I bet most other Yelper's know too! The home fries are tasty & well seasoned they went down well with my chalk dry eggs, dry toast and orange marmalade.\\n\\nI was in a funk over the eggs so I thought Ok, I'll be decadent & treat myself to some serious Louisiana style French Toast (aka: Pain Perdu en Francaise). One of my personal favorites because it's known to be such a rich version of French Toast, Mmmm! Left over Perdu is amazing nuked & topped with ice cream, that was the master plan! Dear reader, please try it sometime with real Pain Perdu, if inclined ask me for a great recipe!\\n\\nEstelle honey, darlin', The Creole people in Louisiana would throw live crawfish at Ch'ya for serving what was put in front of me!\\n\\nThey \\"flash\\" dipped the thickly sliced brioche style bread so quickly in batter that when cut into all one saw inside was DRY white bread. That's NOT Pain Perdu. The irony is that's almost what was served to me with my eggs, the same bread and the same marmalade. Please note, their Perdu is also served with griddled banana ...that was the ONLY remotely redeeming quality of the dish. \\n\\nIn case the owner or chef ever check out Yelp...It's boring and somewhat insulting to feature & serve orange marmalade with the Pain Perdu then serve the same marmalade on egg dishes. Switch it up a bit & serve something else with the egg dishes...Just Plain Jam would suffice or serve REAL maple syrup with your Perdu (IF you can get that dish made correctly). BTW, the grilled banana is a nice touch on the Perdu. However, serving it with \\"skin on\\" isn't. I didn't notice the skin was on the banana until after I inserted the banana into my mouth and \\"surprise\\", skin on! Ah, Geez...Who Knew? Peel n' eat banana for brunch, what a special touch.\\n\\nSince I'm on a rant 1. almost all the dishes have pork in them, one should be able to order biscuits without \\"sausage gravy\\" and if you charge the same price provide a viable substitute 2. a side of cheddar grits also has sausage in it, why? 3.You can't get the sweet potato hash without the brisket, Hmm?? The menu is already small, now you've cut out options for patrons to have potentially ordered = lost revenue, think $$. Unless someone revamps the menu, I see people going to other establishments that are more accommodating for a multitude of palates inclusive of those that don't eat pork or meat.\\n\\nLast and by no way least, ditch the faux \\"moon pie\\" dessert, for a Southern Red Velvet Triple Layer Cake & for the love of General Robert E. Lee put Peach Cobbler on the dessert menu too. As always written with kindness.

The price is to be expected for a ramen bowl around the Boston area. I definitely liked my husband's bowl of ramen better(a spicy ramen) vs mine (miso ramen).  The spicy ramen had more flavor overall versus the miso ramen.  We thought it was interesting that the spicy ramen had a different type of noodles than the miso ramen.  I didn't mix up all the miso in my ramen so, it tasted better once I made that realization(although, shouldn't have they mixed up for me?).  I really enjoyed the soft-boiled egg in mine though.  Yolk running around in the bowl is just so delightful for me.  \\nI thought the texture of the broth was too thick for my personal preference, sort of the same consistency as hot and sour soup or as if cornstarch was added to make it thicker.  I prefer a broth is thick due to bone marrows being slowly cooked for hours thickening the broth and imparting a rich flavor.  I think the cornstarch(if I'm guessing correctly), dulled the flavors of the broth.  I guess I wasn't expecting that with this soup.  The noodle texture was soft and chewy, which I liked.  The pork meat was okay, wished they had warmed it up a little bit more before putting it in.

I'm happy I I made the decision to finally check out King Bao. I got the simplest, safest bao--kickin' chikin. I am happy I made that decision, as the bao was hot, fresh, and packed with flavor. The steamed bun was light, chewy, and airy and had a subtle flavor that complimented the intensity of the sriracha aioli and fresh, juicy chicken.\\n\\nThe place itself wasn't the most attractive hole-in-the-wall I've seen. It almost felt like the owners of the place didn't have enough time to think about decor, so he took some pictures of Lake Eola and slapped the King Bao mascot on them just so the walls weren't empty. Maybe it's meant to be that way--since it's right on Mills 50 and there's an unironic love of  \\"minimalist\\" aesthetic.

I got the linguini with scallops and shrimp in the spicy red lobster based sauce, which was sooooo goooood. Although, I should've skipped the shrimp. It was just typical slightly overcooked rubbery shrimp. But the scallops were very tasty and a great complement to the lobster sauce and linguini. Initially, I went there for the lobster ravioli, but our waiter suggested this dish, and I am so glad he did! By the way, our waiter was super friendly.

I honestly think it may just be the best Vietnamese fish sauce wings I've had. And it's not even a Vietnamese restaurant! The wings were so tender, and the skin was crisped just right. There was the perfect amount of sauce on the wings. The fish sauce flavor was not too overwhelming nor underwhelming. The fishy and tangy flavor was mixed just right. The spice was a light kick, so it would be alright for people who do not do spicy very well. They also give you pickled vegetables, which go really well with the wings.\\n\\nThe papaya pok pok was bland. It's made of green papaya salad with tomatoes, long beans, Thai chili, lime juice, tamarind, fish sauce, garlic, palm sugar, dried shrimp and peanuts. We really wanted to try the som tam isaan, which sounded much more flavorful and interesting. However, they were not able to make it at the time. This was very disappointing and I do hope this restaurant can be sure to have the ingredients on hand and to have their listed dishes available in the future. I came to Oregon for a vacation, so I really missed out as I am unsure of the next time I will be back to try this!\\n\\nKhanom jiin sao naam is made of thin rice vermicelli with pineapple, ginger, white tumeric, green mango, dry shrimp, Thai chilis and garlic, topped with a sweet/sour dressing and tumeric coconut cream with house made fish balls. This was really good, but only after we added a lot of lime to it! The dish itself is very sweet and flavorful. We like our food to be more sour, so the lime did the trick! It only took a bit of correction to fit our personal taste buds, so it worked out very well. Note, they got some real spicy chilis here! I was very happy with how spicy their Thai chili was.\\n\\nDa chom's laap meuang is a Chiang Mai-style spicy hand-minced pork \\"salad\\" with aromatics, complex spice mixture, herbs, offal, cracklings and crispy fried garlic, served with phak sot. This would be categorized under mon nhau for the Vietnamese people out there. Mon nhau means a dish that is eaten when drinking alcohol. The pork was a bit too chewy for my taste. The dish itself was a bit too salty. We ended up mixing the bland papaya salad with this. The combination worked out really well!\\n\\nFor drinks, the cha manoa, which is Thai iced tea with lime, was strange to the taste for me. It does kind of grow on you after a while, but I would not order it again. The waiter suggested we try this because it's their special rink made by their restaurant. We ended up ordering a cha yen because we still weren't feeling the the cha manao. The cha yen was very delicious, though! I guess I am just used to regular Thai iced tea.\\n\\nWe ended our meal with khao niaw mamuang for dessert. The mango was fresh and the sticky rice had the right sticky texture.

We had ventured into the North End for the Feast of St. Anthony, and we were rolling 9 deep, 3 of which were hungry and perpetually bored teenage boys.  We decided to avoid the stomach pangs that can result from street fair food on a 97 degree day, and popped into Antico Forno for a late lunch/early dinner.   The air conditioning was thankfully pumping full blast, and the busboy quickly put together a table that could accommodate our party.   Our drinks came out quickly, although strangely, the wine arrived far before the sodas.  As I was drinking wine, I'm not going to complain!\\n\\nWe ordered the antipasto to start, and the plate was overflowing with delicious goodies such as sundried tomatoes, crunchy artichokes, soft balls of mozzarella, and roasted red peppers surrounded by a ring of various cured meats.   The bread basket was overflowing, and the oil that accompanied it had just a hint of flavor from the olives that rested on the bottom of the dish.   Our waiter, although quiet, did point out that the chicken parm was a very large portion when the 15 year old, the 12 year old, and my dad all tried to order it in succession.  He suggested that they order two to share, and it's a good thing he did because it arrived in massive dishes, bubbling hot, and sitting atop a mound of pasta.  Between the three of them, they didn't manage to finish the two portions.  The restaurant is known for cooking its food, both pizza and pasta, in a massive brick oven, so all dishes come out bubbling hot and with that top crunchy crust that's accomplished from being cooked at super high temps.  Two of us ordered the linguine al frutti di mare, which was linguine topped with a ton of mussels, clams, shrimp, and calamari, all tossed in a chunky tomato sauce that had just a hint of a fra diavlo-like kick.  So good.  The other two had rigatoni based dishes, which, while I did not try them, appeared to be good, as neither spoke much during the meal, and both had nearly empty plates at the end.  We also got a side of broccoli rabe in garlic which I thought was one of the best parts of the meal.  As the broccoli was also cooked in the brick oven, it had a smoky, roasted garlic undertone that had me hording the dish.  A girl needs her greens.\\n\\nI found the prices very reasonable for the North End, and the portions were large, as is often expected in Italian dining.

Problem of English language and rush of judgment.\\nWe do not offer non vegetarian platter in dinner menu, you were looking at lunch menu amigo.\\nAlso all the prices are mentioned in front of every item clearly, if you think its overpriced you have a option to walk out. We have happy & repeat customers for last 5 years and they care about the ingredients & they know the cost of it. \\nOur servers work on tips . Some typical type of customers do not offer tips & complaint about price, so we add just 15% to protect our servers as they has a life too\\n\\nReply to the Owner - \\n\\n I am just writing what I experienced. No one writes a bad review here for no reason. For you to insinuate that I don't understand English or I am some 'typical' type of customer is quite rude. Also, please think about the following things:\\n1. We could have been told that non-vegetarian platter is not available for dinner. \\n2. Lunch menu should not have been on the table\\n3. I can only figure out the item is overpriced after having a bite and looking at the quantity. \\n4. It is the customer's prerogative to tip or not. I assume if you were so worried about the life of your servers, you could just pay them more rather than forcing your customers to do so. \\n\\nHope you can find time to work towards improving customer experience rather than calling names. \\nThanks."},{"name":"The Porter Beer Bar","address":"1156 Euclid Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Love the selections of beers and delicious appetizers.

I'd never done Taco Tuesday, but since it was Mexican Independence Day my friend and I thought we'd head over there instead of Agave Azul (my fave for Mexican Dinner).  Right from the start the hostess' were bickering and took a while to look up and realize we were there.  They promptly seated us at the table closest to the parking lot.  Not terrible but its not the best location.  We then ordered a pitcher of margaritas (watered down and not much flavor) but didn't complain due to the price.  Friend ordered tortilla soup and I ordered the chips and salsa.  We each put in an order for unlimited tacos and proceeded to wait...and wait...and wait. After an hour we finally caught a managers eye and explained that it had been almost an hour since we ordered with no updates on our meal.  He explained they were very backed up.  We can understand that, however no one ever came to tell us and no sort of compensation was offered.  He left to check on our order and after 10 minutes with no return we let our waitress know to cancel our meals.  \\n\\nThe manager finally returned to the table with the check and said \\"Sorry ladies, I took care of the tacos\\"  Really!  I would hope so since its now been 70 minutes and we never saw them.  They could have attempted to save the day and offer a complimentary drink or an app or even seemed a little more concerned that we were walking out, but instead they seemed relieved to have one less table to bother them.  \\n\\nI may come back for a drink, but I'll stick to Agave Azul to eat!"},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Soo good!!

Definitely. \\nWe shared the charcuterie and the vin blanc mussels and while both were tasty I would've preferred to spend half as much on a plate of something at a cactus club and had better service. \\n\\nOur server was polite (I think) I barely saw him. He never once asked how anything was. He only took our order and asked if we wanted more bread (working real hard for that upsell) but never once asked how our drinks or food were tasting.

I chose Giacomo's based on the outstanding reviews on Yelp, and I was very happy. The place is tiny and somewhat austere - my wife and I were stuck at a four-person table where we were forced to either make conversation with or eavesdrop on our neighbors. We did the former, as they were jovial and interesting, though being seated next to different diners could have really ruined the entire experience.\\n\\nFood was good and the value was even better. I had fried calamari that were very good (I might even say they are a must), and my lobster, clams, and mussels with linguini Fra Diavolo was excellent - not homemade gourmet fancy inspired pasta and sauce, but just solid, standard Italian-American fare with incredibly fresh seafood all for $20. My wife had something a bit more inventive - homemade Gnocci with a red pepper tomato cream sauce that she says is the best pasta she's had outside of Italy. It was comforting to know they could rise above standard \\"red sauce\\" Italian food. \\n\\nWhy not 5 stars? As I said, we were seated immediately next to another couple, which could have made for a disasterous dinner if they were not friendly people.

The lobster ravioli were flavorful and stuffed with lobster, they looked like they had been made by a child though.  The sauce was OK and wouldn't make the top ten the neighborhood across the harbor.  The sea bass special was cooked well, but was to be served with \\"roasted cherry tomato's\\"   I got three along with an equally anemic serving of bland mashed potatoes.

I also got a salad. \\n\\nMy salad came out quick, and I thought that was strange since we didn't get our apps yet (we ordered 2 appetizers). So I asked my boyfriend to flag down the waiter next time we saw him in order to ask about our apps. This is where things went bad- we COULD have had our apps in time if our waiter was around to inquire about them!! However, we looked and looked and tried to enjoy our drinks and salad while also trying to keep an eye out for the waiter. \\n\\n30 minutes went by before we finally saw our waiter again!! We asked him about our apps and he apologized and said he forgot. Well I was upset because I REALLY wanted to try my appetizer! I was all excited! :( And had he been around earlier we would have had enough time to remind him and have him bring them out.\\n\\nTo ME, a normal standard is that if a restaurant forgets an app, they don't charge you and they bring the app out anyway. The manager did come over and apologize and told us our drinks were on her! KUDOS TO YOU AND GREAT JOB FOR THAT; however, I really did want the appetizers and never got them.\\n\\nWe then noticed that other tables had bread. We didn't get any!

You'll have the whole restaurant to yourself. You get the chance to get to interact with the chefs/staff more personally. There's no way I would dismiss visiting this restaurant my next time in Portland. \\n\\nWe were lucky enough to meet Nino that night who took very good care of us. We kinda just let him do his thing when it came to choosing. Which is the omakase option ($20)- where you let the chef choose your order for you. Probably one of the best restaurant experiences I've had. It's nice to see the chefs have as much freedom as they do when it comes to creativity and making new things at this restaurant. The chef literally said I don't know how you'll like this one (referring to the roll he made) because I've never made it before. He probably hooked it up way fatter than he was supposed to and served us more plates than the usual cause he let us try a lot of different things.\\n\\nI can't really say I can recall everything that was made. The first I got were slices of scallops that were slightly cooked by blow torch. My favorites were the sashimi with shiitake mushroom and some sort of herb which is a staple at the restaurant. And the other was the dessert- simple cubes of soft sweet potato topped with a sliver of lemon jam made by one of the chefs. The fish they served was fresh and the unique flavors they incorporate into their dishes make the experience enjoyable in many ways."},{"name":"House Special","address":"1269 Hamilton Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Tasty good quality Vietnamese.

The service was literally a 2/5 The hostess was extremely nice, she led us to our table with a smile and given us an menu.

The only thing I wish was for the portion sizes to be a little bigger because I usually leave feeling a little bit hungry still.

The folks are friendly, the place is open and cheery.  Even when it's packed to the door, as it is every day at crunch times, people are patient and the staff runs through line down relatively quickly.  At least to place orders; getting your food can take a while.  In fact, even when it's empty, it seems to take forever to get a sandwich.\\n\\nThe sandwiches are tasty and reasonably priced, considering the popularity of the place.  The breads and fillings are both high-quality.  I will definitely be back again for lunch (though not between 12 and 1).\\n\\nBut they are reportedly a bakery first and foremost, so I was most excited to try the cookies.  And I did, and they were...well, disappointing.  I can tell how they'd be delicious to certain kinds of people, but they don't do it for me.  The milk chocolate hazelnut cookies have good texture, but the flavor is more nut than chocolate; yet somehow there is plenty of chocolate, which manages to be nearly liquid at room temperature, and thus insanely messy.  I had hoped the bittersweet chocolate chip cookies would be better, but the chocolate and the cookie itself both suffered from an abundance of bitter, and lack of sweet.  Again, the quantity and consistency of chocolate made a mess.  Even the double chocolate cookie disappointed, being cakey, not very sweet, and hiding nuts (to be fair, the nuts were probably mentioned on the little sign, so it's my bad).  Fortunately, their meringues are huge and delicious, and both the chocolate chunk and almond flavors are amazing.  I have heard good things about their sticky buns, and maybe I'll try them someday, if they ever sell any that aren't covered in nuts."},{"name":"Red Lentil Vegetarian & Vegan Restaurant","address":"600 Mt Auburn St","city":"Watertown","stars":"4","text":"If you're looking for some hearty, healthy vegan and vegetarian food, Red Lentil is a great choice.\\n\\nI recently ordered the vegan Shepard's pie and it was one of the best things I've eaten in a long time.

The ambiance is not too noisy unless you go late, and they turn up the music a bit.\\n\\nWe asked to sit on a high top in the front of the restaurant right next to a window, with the weekend downtown hustle and bustle coming and going.\\n\\nI ordered my usual an Apple Martini. While we looked at the menu, we were served Focaccia bread with a delicious dipping oil.\\n\\nCreatures of habit, I ordered the Chicken Piccata which came with roasted potatoes and veggies (which were zucchini). I was glad to see roasted potatoes, I much prefer them over Ziti. There were 2 good sized pieces of saut√©ed chicken with a lemony sauce, sliced potatoes and grilled sliced zucchini. The only comment I would have is, that from a \\"look with your eyes\\" prospective, everything was the same color.\\n\\nMy husband got the Veal Parmesan with Ziti. He was served two very thick veal cutlets which he said were super tender. The ziti seemed to have a Bolognese sauce. I say seemed because he asked for extra sauce, and the waitress brought a Marinara sauce. At the end of the meal, he asked that when he got it again, if he could ask for the Marinara sauce instead of what came on the Ziti. She replied we only have one sauce. But they were clearly 2 different sauces.....

Try it and you'll love it and believe me, as you get the first bite you know you found what you were always looking for. \\n\\nFor me, the only downside is that you cannot count on the 'quality' of your pizza to be consistent. Some days you are getting the dough like it's supposed to be for a pizza napoletana and a perfect ratio of toppings in perfect shape - heavenly delicious. But as the dough is baked very thin, some days you'll end up with pieces falling apart and the toppings all over the place and not enough tomato sauce.

The pub was packed inside and outside. Make reservations on the MyDisneyExperience app ahead of time if you want to eat inside. \\n\\nWe had no idea that the great Irish singing, dancing and music at Ragland Road would be almost continuous throughout the evening. Table location is key. Although it can be very loud at times, the music and dancing make this restaurant a fantastic experience. For both of our meals here, the service was also impeccable and definitely enhanced our enjoyment of the evening. \\n\\nThe complimentary Irish soda bread with a Guinness dip is delicious. Don't miss this! Food-wise, no one at our table had a bad meal either occasion (7 different meals).  If you're looking for traditional Irish fare, the cider salmon, fish & chips, braised beef, and chicken pot pie were seriously excellent. Dad was confused by the deconstructed Shepard's pie he ordered, but said it tasted delicious. Only the baby back ribs were kind of eh, and should be skipped for one of their tastier meals. \\n\\nRagland Road has a broad selection of Irish and English beers and ciders on the menu, as well as a lot of Florida-brewed craft beers.

A side walk covered in downed branches cover your walk to the front door. \\n\\nBut that's where the downtrodden ghetto feeling ends. Her building is purple and gold in true New Orleans fashion and many signs stating 'open' adorn the front window. \\n\\nWhen you walk in the door, Lola is the only person here. She looks a little worse for the wear but that could partially be due to how overwhelming her home is. I say home because this place is just like being taken back to your Jesus loving aunt's Sunday breakfast before church. Religious gospel plays proudly and there is portraits of Jesus everywhere. Even a kitschy glittered mirror that takes up half a wall with its Last Supper replication. Statements of faith are posted, painted and written all around.\\n \\nMardi Gras beads hang from the ceiling with trinkets and masks. African wood cuts are scattered and mixed between beautiful French busts. \\n\\nEverything is gold, red, and purple. Sponge painted brick and linoleum flooring. There are two main tables with chairs and benches, both like family dining tables, along with two side tables for two. Covered in plastic like she's expecting company for a family meal instead of a restaurant. In the middle of the table I'm sitting at is a lazy Susan with a sculpture of the praying Jesus, along with paper towels, inner peace cards, sauces, a book called Now Are We In Christ Jesus, and salt and pepper. \\n\\nLolas dress is covered in flour because she's also the soul chef. This is truly home cooking in every sense of the word. Lola invites you to sit anywhere and lets you know today's special and asks what you'd like to drink. Cherry kool-aid is an option and she'll mix lemonade, kool-aid, sweet tea, and mango together for a tasty treat. I didn't get to try the mango because she gave it to the homeless shelter. \\nThis food is amazing, shrimp etoufee, red beans and rice, and corn served on plastic wear. Not the cheap throwaway but what you serve to your little sister because you know she might drop it. Lola is as sweet as she can be and really does treat you like dear family she hasn't seen in a while. I was initially creeped out by the church music but now I totally get it. She has invited us all into her home as family, not as a business wanting customers. This is further confirmed to em by the local school sports team photos and student of the month certificates all over one wall. Her family photos are in a cabinet for all to see. \\n\\nI really want to bring my proud aunt here because it really makes me homesick for her kitchen and company. I feel like I should ask if she needs any help cleaning up or in the kitchen. \\n\\nLola's is great for anyone who is far from their family, doesn't have any family, or is just feeling a little lonely. I know I will be back, if only it was a little closer to me. \\n\\nNow after all that glowing review I have to say, the way she asked if I wanted to leave a tip when she ran up my credit card made me feel very awkward.\\n\\nMy meal ran me 9.50 for a drink (refilled once) and a plate of home cooked Cajun goodness. For some reason I thought it would cost a bit less but I'm not sure why.\\n\\nSunday it is closed because she feeds the homeless on the patio that day.\\n\\nNo parking, I had to park at the housing development down the block."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place is as close to modern Italian as you can get.

So that bugged me.\\n\\nThis year, RC is doing a summer spectacular menu, which is a 3 course meal for 2 for $89.  There is a limited selection, so it pays to check out the options prior to dining.  We had a choice of 2 salads and gumbo to start. I had the caesar and it was alright.  It came with very peppery and cheesy croutons.  My friend had the gumbo and he liked it.\\n\\nFor entrees, we had a choice of petit filet, a mixed grille (chicken, 4 oz steak and crab cake), stuffed chicken breast, bbq shrimp and swordfish. I chose the shrimp, which came with a giant serving of mashed potatoes. I think they should swap that out with veggies, but that's just me.  He had the mixed grille. I should have ordered the chicken-it was so succulent! He liked his meal.\\n\\nWe are also allowed to each choose a side dish. I chose the (giant) sauteed mushrooms and he chose the potatos au gratin.  They were dripping in butter and cheese.\\n\\nWe also had a half bottle of pinot grigio.\\n\\nAs for dessert, RC gives a complimentary dessert if there is a birthday, so we got the chef's selection: chocolate sin cake which was a flourless cake with raspberry sauce (and a candle).

Once they're done, one of them will bring them out to you...

I ordered the cod cake benedict (I always have to try the bennys at any new restaurant, they're so easy to mess up but so good when they're done right!) It was perfect. The egg was just the right balance of solid and runny, the hollandaise sauce was not too lemony, but just enough to complement the cod cakes, which were just moist enough. Delicious. My boyfriend got the chorizo omelet, which was gone before I could even grab a bite, so that says a lot! The breakfast potatoes that came on the side were crispy on the outside and soft inside, just like they should be, with some onions thrown in there for good measure. The bacon was thick and fatty, just melt-in-your-mouth amazing.\\n\\nThe service was a little slow, but for a new restaurant starting out, and having to run from the outside patio downstairs to the bar and back, I say they did very well. And when you're sitting outside on a sunny Sunday morning, and the food is amazing, I'd rather eat leisurely anyways.\\n\\nAnd on top of all that, we spent less than we would have at the Independent or Bronwyn for a wonderful brunch meal.

We had the kappo omakase that varied with raw and cooked foods. My favorites would have to be the scallop sushi and the uni combo dish. The scallop just felt like it dissolved into butter over the rice.  I hope everyone can imagine that.  I refer to the other as an uni combo dish because it was a mish-mash of ingredients I couldn't remember with uni as the centerpiece. It was surrounded by what I somewhat remember being told as a foie gras-brioce custard.

We had planned on ordering oysters for an app, but were now torn with her recommendation of the octopus, so we asked her to surprise us. Surprise us, she did! We received one oyster to start and then the octopus app. It was the perfect treatment for our indecisiveness. I then ordered the bluefish and my boyfriend ordered the pork three ways. Delicious on all accounts. Further, our entrees were perfectly complemented by two beers of Monica's choosing - one German smoked beer and the other a Belgian.

My dining companion J and I rolled in near 8 pm. It was very busy, VERY LOUD, but the very courteous hostess assured us the wait would not be long. In a few minutes she came back and offered us a choice between several different seatings. Did I mention I'm a traditionalist?

Then again the couple two seats over having sake shooters and looking a little tipsy reminded me this was another kind of \\"bar\\" mostly. It was so loud back there I could barely hear our chef offer up suggestions of what was good. \\n\\nWe had a number of different nigiri. I'm not into rolls. All the panko and sesame and cream cheese just distract from the real point of the stuff which is fish. I can only describe the quality and freshness of the fish as inconsistent. The smoked white salmon was delicate and amazingly handled, while the aji (horse mackeral) and the mirugai were just fails in terms of texture (soft and mealy) and flavor (none). The rice also left something to be desired. Maybe it was the texture (not sticky enough?), temperature, or the way it was pressed by the chef's hands. Not sure, but definitely not the way I like it. Presentation gets top marks, and all in all we got real full, had a couple of good pieces, more mediocre pieces, but no real satisfaction.

Wish they had more vegetarian options. The decor is eclectic...which I understand for a Mexican restaurant, but something feels amiss.

I had friends attending BC and BU who allowed me to stay in their apartments and was on somewhat intimate terms with a nice young lady (she was a college sophomore, an \\"older woman\\") attending Pine Manor Junior College.\\n\\nIn 1974, she introduced me to a lot of things, including Pino's Pizza. That school year, we ate a lot of Pino's pizza. While Pino's pizza wasn't the best thing she introduced me to, it was certainly the best pizza.  Later, even while attending college in Cambridge, I would occasionally wander over to Cleveland Circle for a Pino's pizza.\\n\\nFast forward to June 2012. I flew into Boston for appointments and to spend the summer in New Hampshire. As that I now have nieces and nephews attending BC & BU and the Boston Globe trumpeting their 50th anniversary in business, I decided a visit to Pino's was in order.\\n\\nIt was a wonderful trip down Memory Lane. The huge sign on the front of the building hasn't changed in the 35 years since the last time I was there. Pino's is now a little bigger, having expanded into the adjacent space. \\n\\nThe NY-style thin crust cheese pizza is still chewy and the crust folds well as a good pizza slice should. The 1/2 plain, 1/2 sausage pie I took back to my hotel room was excellent. My only MINOR complaint being the sausage tasted more Greek than Italian. The service was excellent and the place was filled with college kids. BTW, cold pizza for breakfast is STILL the best!!\\n\\nReservoir Liquors (they of the \\"we don't need no stinkin' I.D.\\" policy) may be gone;  Aegean Fare (R.I.P.) may have been killed by shoddy bookkeeping and the Massachusetts Dept of Revenue; and, Cleveland Circle Cinema may be consigned to the ash heap of history.

I waited a few minutes thinking that everything else would come out too but after 5 minutes, we just decided to eat the 2 empanadas before they got cold. A few minutes later my steak paillard comes.

Another 10 minutes later, my boyfriends entree finally came.

Magic act plus a 5 course meal. Each course was paired with an alcoholic beverage that was chosen so that it would bring out the special flavor of the food that it was paired with. The event was held Wednesday evening, which is an unusual time of the week. Honestly, given the amount of alcohol and food, this would be an ideal Friday or Saturday evening event. Going to work the next day when all you wanted to do was lounge is PJ's and get over a mild handover was not fun. Anyway, I digress, back to the event. First thing was the setting...the private room was set up on the second floor of the restaurant. At first it was hot...as in overheated due to the fact that all the heat was rising from the first floor of course. They figured that part out and lower the heat somewhat, but there were ladies during the dinner that kept fanning themselves with the menus to keep from sweating. \\n\\nSecond observation...not enough seating for the amount of reservations. Seems that word of mouth got around about this event, and people decided to \\"drop in\\" thinking they would have plenty of room. Not true. They did bring in some extra tables and quickly put together seating, tableclothes etc. but still we were getting pretty crowded pretty quickly. Then there is logistics to consider. Food is made downstairs...therefore all the meals and drinks had to be placed on huge serving treys and \\"schlepped\\" upstairs. It was a wonder that one of the servers didn't take a nose dive...yes one glass of lemon water did get spilled on a patron. No harm, no foul...actually refreshing given the heat of the room. : ) \\n\\nOkay, drinks and food were finally arriving, socializing was commencing, all is well. Magician introduces himself and begins doing tricks...rope trick, card tricks, mind reading, shell game. He is a hit! Very personable, quick of hand and is working the crowd. By this time we are all at least three drinks in, so my eye is definitely not focusing as fast as it should on the slight of hand...seriously he could have pulled an elephant out of a hat and I would not have known how it got there. Seems the more we drank, the better the magician was. : ) \\n\\nNow for the food. Very, very well presented, very tasty...there were a few drinks I didn't really care for like the \\"Espresso Milk Stout and Irish Cream\\" combo....way too Stouty for me. But others loved it, so this is totally a personal preference. Course 3, consisted of a \\"Rabbit in a Hat\\", which was a beer braised rabbit in puff pastry. Lovely dish, meat was tender and shredded. Side dish was \\"magical mushroom marshmallow\\"..which I have yet to figure out if it was a marshmallow with mushroom flavoring or a mushroom with marshmallow flavoring! The servers kept the dishes moving and kept the dirty dishes cleared away quickly and efficiently. I think they were definitely there to make this evening a success, so give them a definite thumbs up. \\n\\nThe portions at first seemed small for each course...about 2 oz for the roasted organic beef...heck, I can take down an 11 oz filet Mignon with no issues, so this was a tease for me. However, I must say that although not one dish had a ton of food, once you finished all the courses, you were definitely satisfied. So for the price ($100 per couple) you got great entertainment, wonderful food, plenty of booze and some fun times....just a little advise for 5 Seasons...consider doing this on a Friday or weekend where we get get over the hangover before coming into work.

However, the fries were horrible. They weren't crispy and were actually hard and shrivelled up! They looked like they had been sitting there for a while. The caesar salad that came on the side didn't taste very fresh, and was literally the size of a spoon.  \\nI had also ordered zoo sticks, which are deep fried zucchinis. These were a disappointment as well. Even though they had been deep fried the batter lacked crunchiness and was rather soggy.

At first I was overwhelmed by the menu, which seems to be in equal parts a course on food sustainability. The lighting is wonderful in a low light kind of way as is the space beautifully designed. Before actually communing with the regular sushi menu, I found myself reading the pages and pages of fusion types of sushi, such as something with cream cheese. That made my hair stand up on end a little bit, as I am a very seasoned sushi lover. Once I discovered the regular stuff and ordered off that page everything fell into place. When I say it's the best sushi I've ever eaten, I mean after having eaten several thousand sushi meals around the country, including the big cities. There was not one morsel of gristle in any bite.

Popular Atlanta breakfast and brunch restaurant Highland Bakery opened a location in the old Junior's Grill space at Georgia Tech in March 2013.  Many Techies (myself included) were sad to see Junior's close in April 2011 after decades of service.  Those burgers, chicken finger baskets, and Southern cafeteria-style meat-and-twos were a Tech tradition.  I was happy when I heard Highland Bakery would be opening in its place since I'm a fan of Highland's original Old Fourth Ward location.\\n\\nFor those who remember Junior's, the building looks exactly the same, save for some new signs for Highland Bakery.  The inside of the restaurant was gutted and the space now feels more open.  Decor is minimal.  Various types of seating are available including casual cafe-style tables, high-top communal tables, and large, comfy, lounge-like chairs with coffee tables.  This is a place where Tech students, faculty, and staff can come hang out, study, unwind, grab a cup of coffee, and/or have breakfast or lunch.  Whereas Junior's was more of a restaurant, Highland Bakery feels more like a cafe.\\n\\nThe restaurant has a fast casual setup.  Stand in line, pay upfront, and orders are brought to your table.  Silverware and drinks are self-serve.  Right before the cash registers, along the ordering line, are two big glass display cases containing various fresh-baked goods.  These consist mostly of breads, bagels, muffins, and sweet treats such as cupcakes, brownies, and eclairs.  On our visit, the selection seemed rather sparse.  Coffees are roasted locally.\\n\\nI stopped by Highland Bakery while on a recruiting visit to Tech.  Since we were conducting interviews next door at the Student Success Center, the bakery was in a convenient location for our lunch break.  Breakfast is served all day and includes items like shrimp and grits, Eggs Benedict, pancakes, and French toast.  Lunch items consist of soups, salads, and sandwiches.  Almost everything on the menu is priced under $10 each.\\n\\nI went with a staff recommendation, the Fried Chicken Benedict ($10.99), and was glad I did.  This entree consisted of two eggs, poached with medium-firm yolks, atop boneless fried chicken tenders on top of a buttered and toasted biscuit.  This was topped with a jalapeno-cheddar cheese sauce.  It was filling and delicious.  All flavors combined made for some pretty magnificent bites.  Quality ingredients, nice presentation and execution.  My coworkers commented on how great the dish looked as it was delivered to our table.\\n\\nThe Eggs Benedict dishes come with a side of grits or potatoes.  I went with grits and ended up with a generous portion.  It's more like a full-sized bowl of grits as opposed to a \\"side\\" portion of grits.  The grits were alright.  Nice and hot.\\n\\nMy coworkers had sandwiches and everyone seemed to enjoy what they ordered.  During a busy lunch hour, our plates came out in a reasonable amount of time.  The menu states all foods are made from scratch everyday.\\n\\nHighland Bakery at Georgia Tech is certainly a nice option to have for those working or going to school at Tech and for those who happen to be on campus during the week (the bakery is closed on weekends) for whatever reason.  However, if you want the true Highland Bakery experience, go to the original location in O4W.  It's better in almost all aspects."},{"name":"Bananas A Modern American Diner","address":"924 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"When I order a $9.00 burger I expect something more than what I could get at a fast food drive thru.  Meat was way too done, it was supposed to have bleu cheese and bacon on it, but there was only about a teaspoon of cheese, and 1 small slice of bacon. Also, the slice of tomato still had the core in it and didnt even cover half of the burger, and the piece of lettuce was the same.  the crinkle cut fries came out soggy, full of grease, and they were a color they shouldnt have been, probably due to dirty grease. As far as the french dip, I could have gone to Publix and bought the same haogie bun and got better roast beef from the deli. I was just over done meat on a store bought hoagie roll, no onion, no cheese. Just meat and bread with au jus that tasted like brown water with a boullion cube tossed in.

We were seated in the bar area.  I made sure ahead of time that there would be no difference in terms of service, noise, etc and the only apparent difference was that we would have the option of ordering from both the bar menu and the regular menu, and that there were no white tablecloths in our area.  \\n\\nThe hostess was friendly and we were seated promptly.  Our waiter appeared to be attentive too - at the beginning.   He took our drink orders, but then it took about 15 minutes to bring them to us!   Plus, two big errors: he brought me the tasting amount for the wine I requested then when I said I liked it, he had forgotten to bring me the rest of the wine!  (he had to go back and get it, which took another 5 minutes).  He also SPILLED my friend's beer all over our other friend - in my opinion not enough apology was offered, and my friends cleaned up most of the mess rather than the waiter.\\n\\nWe ordered our dinner.  I got the haroset-stuffed onion - which did not sound like very much food, but when I asked the waiter assured me that it would be.  It took a good almost HOUR for our food to arrive - our waiter did offer a second bread basket and tell us a few times that our food was almost ready, but there was not really enough apology.\\n\\nFinally we got our entrees - the onion was definitely NOT enough!  I'm a very petite person, too, so usually I don't need that much food and this onion was definitely not cutting it!  It was basically a 2.5 inch hollowed out onion with haroset inside (for those who don't know that is basically a mixture of apples, walnuts, and wine).   \\n\\nIn terms of taste, the haroset was pretty good, though a bit mushy for my taste (though this is an individual thing).  The people who ordered chicken and fish were also very happy.  But COME ON - I paid over twenty dollars for a bitsy onion with a few apples and walnuts!  My main complaint was that I ASKED if it would be enough - usually if you have a concern at a nice restaurant, they will give you an honest opinion on whether there will be enough food.  If they are smart, they will even say \\"no\\" because then you are more likely to order an appetizer as well, or to order a more expensive dish.  But I was blatantly told that this would be enough, and it definitely was not!  Thank god for the second bread basket...\\n\\nSince I was still hungry (surprise), we got dessert.  This was actually the highlight of the meal.  The gingerbread was very yummy, and the ginger ice cream it came with was just the right blend of spicy and sweet.  The dessert of the day, which was a peanut-butter ice cream in between two peanut-flavored cookies with some grape \\"jelly\\" flavored foam was also excellent except for the grape foam...the peanut butter ice cream was tasty, the cookies were crispy and good.  However, the grape \\"foam\\" was kinda scary - it was pretty sour tasting and had a strange aftertaste.  \\n\\nOverall, not very impressed.  The food itself was pretty good, but I have been to many restaurants in the same price range (i.e. Sel de la Terre, Icarus, Prezza...) with FAR superior service, much better quantity/quality of food for the money you pay, and a generally nicer experience.  I would only come back if someone was going to pay for me...and even then I would likely ask if we could try elsewhere."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The food was really good but it took longer than expected.

His attentiveness and presentation alone could have pushed this to a 4 star rating. However, when you are paying top dollar for a chef's tasting menu, you come to expect that the plates will described to you as they are presented. Our assigned waiter was not the one always bringing the plates from the kitchen. On a two of the plates, the runners did just that; they dropped the plates at our table and ran away. I had to call after them to ask them specifics about each of the dishes. They certainly lost a couple of notches for that, especially at those prices.\\n\\nThe food.\\n\\nWell, to be honest I was really expecting more. The food was reasonably tasty.

In this case, I made the poor mistake of stopping by after work, just an hour before Maria's closed, and it's only partially their fault that they don't bake smaller batches throughout the day, which is easier to do with a bigger, more popular bakery, a variation on the classic chicken-and-egg problem.\\n\\nI ordered a sfogliatelle. I like the concept more than that of a cannolo - I like soft, moist bready pastries, and the inside of this sfogliatelle was decent at satisfying that desire. It was an interesting sort of sweetness too, with various fruity and nutty notes instead of just sugar. But the disappointment came from the crispy outer layers, which were thicker than I would've liked, and harder, and the inside of which were softened by the moist inside in the same way a pre-filled cannolo gets soft instead of crispy.

Well worth it as it turns out.\\n\\nFirst the sides.\\n\\nColeslaw I am not a coleslaw fan but this was ok to me crisp and not mushy like most coleslaw is I give it a 2.5 out of 5\\n\\nBeans again I am not a bean eater but there was nothing special about these I give them a 2 out of 5\\n\\nPotato Salad This was my favorite out of all the sides that I tried it was different but not bad so I rate it a 3 out of 5.\\n\\nThat being said lets face it you are not here for sides. You are here for the meats.\\n\\nI got the rancher combo plate. 4 meats and the sides listed above.\\n\\nlisted in order of favorites \\n\\nBrisket 5 of 5 this was the best brisket out of all the BBQ places I have tried to date just look at my reviews across Texas of BBQ places.\\n\\nSausage again 5 of 5 one of the top 2 Sausages I have had in the state of Texas or anywhere for that matter. \\n\\nTurkey I give this a 4 of 5 I personally like Rudy's Country Store in Houston's turkey better this was second to it.\\n\\nSpare Ribs. 3 or 5 but only because I am not a spare rib fan at all I despise spare ribs. They did have good flavor but the damn cartilage just puts me in a foul mood. It is not a pleasant feeling in my mouth. Again it had good flavor but just can not stand cartilage. Again this is personal opinion.\\n\\nThe experience was great the service was great and I would make the trip again if I was in the area. Do not worry about all the cars in the parking lot as they have this down to a science hardly any wait at all. Even if there was a wait it was well worth it.\\n\\nBTW I liked there haba√±ero sauce the best. \\n\\nHope this helps any of ya'll that are thinking about BBQ its a must stop."},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Never been to a Cuban restaurant before so I wasn't really sure what to expect.

While we waited, we were able to check out the books and items they had for sale.  They had so much merchandise we almost wished we had to wait the full twenty minutes just so we could look at everything.  Once we were seated we were greeted promptly by a waitress.  One great aspect about this restaurant is that the service is very fast, which was unexpected given how busy it was.  We placed our order, which we both got the truck stop special (eggs, sausage, toast, one pancake and hash browns).  I don't believe it was longer than 5 minutes past placing our order that our food came to the table, we could not believe it! This is where it gets not so great and the reason I rated it 3 stars.  The whole plate was barely warm.  The toast tasted like it had been sitting out, not under a warmer for quite some time, I couldn't even spread butter on it.  The food was good, but I really got the sense that they make these meals in bulk and let them sit out before dishing them onto customers plates.  It didn't taste fresh, which was disappointing.

The brownie was alright (but still nothing you couldn't find elsewhere), but the salted caramel gelato we got with it didn't taste like either salt or caramel.  It was a generically blandish sweet flavor with no distinguising taste at all.  We also got a \\"chocolate\\" cherry gelato.  I said \\"chocolate\\" because there was no chocolate flavor at all, just the same blandish generically sweet flavor.  The only distinguishing flavor in this gelato occurred when I happened to bite into a whole cherry.\\n\\nOn top of that, the portion size of the chocolate cherry I ordered (a small) was hilariously tiny.  Mozart's is charging $3.75 for what just about any self-respecting ice cream shop would give away as a free sample.  When the attendant picked up the cup, about the size of the ramekin you get when you ask for your salad dressing on the side, I thought he was just putting a bit into a cup to let me try.  Nope, this was actually the small that I ordered.  For $3.75 for a free sample cup, it should have been the best chocolate ice cream on the planet.  Instead, it was among the worst and most bland I have ever had.  I would have been better off saving the money and buying a pint of Blue Bell or better yet, just going to Amy's.\\n\\nToss in the extremely limited parking for the 3-4 restaurants all sharing the same lot and it amounted to just a plain old bad experience.\\n\\nWhat we ordered was a horrible value for the money.

The egg noodles are chewy, which I like. The meat is a little too salty for my taste, and I generally like salty food. The broth was actually pretty good, a little oily but they add scallions and chopped onion which makes it taste a bit cleaner.

The person who made the reservation insisted we had reserved one of these reserved, the staff disagreed... and they only kept pointing to the 2 empty keg tables \\"those are already reserved, see???\\" ... as if the fact that we told them *we* had reserved one went in one ear and out the other... \\n\\nWent here for a business dinner... which in it of itself was meh since we could have gone anywhere! \\n\\nAesthetic wise, the place is nice to look at, for a sports bar. There are TVs everywhere.  I don't really buy into the whole \\"upscale sports bar\\" ... a sports bar is a sports bar, and this one is no different than the next.... it has newer tvs, sure.  The look reminds me of Rockit here in Chicago, though the food at Rockit is better..  If you think it doesn't look like a sports bar, maybe you were in a different restaurant than I was.  There was no shortage of TVs, they even bought an expensive Crestron control system to control them all.\\n\\nThe service was sub-par if you ask me...Our group arrived... we had a reservation and we were waiting on 2 or 3 people.   We would have been more than happy to be seated at our table, yet they told us we had to wait...  It's a sports bar, not a 15 course tasting menu.  There's no need for everyone to be started off on the same page, and we were OK with sitting down and getting a few drinks.  And there were plenty of open tables, including the one we would eventually be seated at.   Sure we could have gone to the bar and bought drinks, but on a business dinner many would be reluctant to do this since it's a pain to have so many transactions, one is just easier and sometimes even necessary.  Nobody offered to take our coats or check any of our bags or anything, despite the fact that I saw them doing this for others (there was a coat stand next to the hostess).  \\n\\nOnce seated, the waitress took away our menus despite the fact that that's where the drinks /  wine were listed.  I started out with a cocktail but then switched to wine, I had to ask for a menu since they insisted on collecting them before (despite me asking to keep one for later).  Then after ordering my wine from the menu I put the menu next to a pile of bags that was on the floor (since leaving the piece of paper on the table was obviously out of the question for our waitress).  She actually came while she thought I wasn't looking and took the menu out of that pile.  The menus are printed on newspaper (made to look like a newspaper in fact), nothing too fancy, it's not like they were needing to protect something expensive.  Is it too hard to leave a table of 13 people one single menu? I don't get it, menu nazis.\\n\\nThe place was loud, and being seated at an actual table was counter intuitive to having any sort of group discussion...we couldn't have heard anyone across the table if we wanted to.  A keg table would have been more group-friendly and social.\\n\\nWhen we were done eating the waitress brought our check despite nobody actually telling her we wanted it (trying to turn a table on a business dinner where 13 or 14 people would've had a few extra rounds of drinks?? someone needs to buy this waitress a clue)... she didn't even ask if we wanted dessert!  \\n\\nFoodwise... it was upscale pub food.  Not all that cheap, there were $30+ entrees even.  An order of wings was $11.\\n\\nI asked the waitress for an entree recommendation... she said the beef pot pie ($22) was great... that sounded good so I tried.  It wasn't very good.

During my subsequent visits, there have been a few very minor mishaps and disappointments; however, nothing that will keep me from returning.\\n\\nThis is a great new space that offers a vast variety of salad options (choose from their many namesake creations, e.g., the Edgar Allan Poe, Mad Molly Brown) or create your own, wraps, select paninis (the Mad Cuban and Mona Lisa are legit), fresh juices (\\"Wake Up!\\" is great!), hummus (original, slightly spicy jalape√±o & avocado, and the amaaaazing fresh red beet), house-brewed specialty teas, Maine Root sodas, COOKIES (best Oatmeal Raisin ever and Salty Caramel that should have angel wings because it's so heavenly), and more! \\n\\nA fantastic concept and a lot to choose from. It's nice to have a solid salad option in the area; however, I wish they offered a tad larger variety of paninis (there's only a choice of three at this spot).  There are certain items that are only available in certain areas (e.g., the \\"Bonnie Parker\\" salad is only offered in Texas).  But, according to the website, the Marilyn Monroe panini isn't labeled as exclusive... apparently it is. I went into the Lakeway location a while back with my heart set on a MM to find out the Lakeway location does not sell the item. :( They have all of the ingredients, but won't (can't?) make off-menu paninis. I get it - efficiency and such...meh!\\n\\nOverall: Super friendly and knowledgeable employees, very fresh, tasty, and healthy food made to order on the fly, and at ~$8-10 per entr√©e item the prices can't be beat! A very welcomed addition to Lakeway!\\n\\nSide note: MAD Greens, and co-founders Marley and Dan (Marley + Dan = MAD) attempt their best at local sourcing, employ \\"green\\" efforts, and are involved in many philanthropic endeavors.

The hostess was really sweet! \\n\\nMy friend and I decided to try this place out after seeing the banner in front of the restaurant, claiming to be one of the best Italian restaurants in the world. Not sure how legitimate the reviewer or award was, but it was freezing and we were hungry. \\n\\nThis place is super cute, with a very romantic atmosphere and legit decor, but also the loudest restaurants I've ever been to. I couldn't hear what my friend was saying half the time. Towards the end, we just gave up on talking. \\n\\nThe prices are decent. Comparable to the other Italian restaurants in the area. I ended up spending around $23 for my meal. I shared the Gnocchi and the Linguine con Vongole. \\n\\nTheir Gnocchi was baked in a brick oven. The sauce consisted of plum tomato sauce, topped with mozzarella cheese and basil finished in brick oven. For $16.50 it was pretty good! The portion doesn't look big, but it is so incredibly filling. The baked mozzarella was probably my favorite party of the dish. The gnocchi was pretty good too. I'm usually not a fan of gnocchi, but Antico Forno made it pretty well. It wasn't the best I've had, but it was better than average. \\n\\nThe Linguine con Vongole was deeeeelicious! For $19, you get linguine with saut√©ed clams, fresh cherry tomatoes in a garlic white wine sauce baked in parchment paper and finished in the brick oven. The sauce is heavenlyyy. I was scooping up every last drop. I was also really surprised with how many clams they served. They were really fresh too! I would definitely recommend trying this dish if you're here! \\n\\nWhat a cool place this is to bake so many of their dishes...and with parchment paper! I really enjoyed the linguine, but would probably pass on the gnocchi. Overall verdict: Not Top 10 in the world...probably not Top 10 in the state either. But it's really good!

Modern is good too, but it's nothing compared to Maria's.\\n\\nI've also tried some of the other pastries and cookies - my favorite is the almond macaroon. The texture is just amazing. Crisp edges, soft middle. Here's a tip: In the store, they keep the macaroons in the refrigerator. When you buy them, leave them out at room temperature. That's how you get the amazing texture. \\n\\nReally, you can't go wrong with anything here. And each holiday brings out the traditional treats.

We got here on the early side, maybe right around noon or so, brought our beverages in with us and the girl at check-in told us you could also buy a bottle of wine from next door if we wanted. Walked by that crazy charcoal grill loaded with meats were getting really excited. We were seated in sort of a side room that's all walls and no windows. It was still fine light-wise, but when a family with 6 kids showed up later, this room got LOUD. Like couldn't hear each other across the table. I would guess this is really the only room that's like that, and there's tons of seating inside and out. \\n\\nOur waiter was came over, asked us if we needed cups for our wine and beer and gave us some suggestions on the menu. We wanted everything on the menu, so we started with one thing but he said he could upgrade us to the \\"family style\\" (buffet) if we were still hungry. Super nice kid.\\n\\nWe both went for the Thurman's Choice (brisket, pork ribs, and sausage w/ sides) and split one beef rib. The flavors were pretty spot-on, but nothing was really very tender. The brisket for instance was tasty, but you we had to really saw through it with the plastic knife before you could eat a piece. The ribs seemed to be a lot gristle and not a lot of meat. We liked their sauces and ended up using a lot of them, but wasn't what we were envisioning. I did really like the potato salad and the coleslaw, but again, not why you would come to a place like this. It was the both the week of SXSW and school vacation week, and while it wasn't that busy when we were here (getting much busier as we left) I wonder if they were just trying to cook too much at one time to prep for the crowds and not paying enough attention to the meats?\\n\\nWe went to Terry Blacks in Austin later in the week and it was incredible, so I'm not sure what happened here.

I started to look at the menu and realized that they had no alternatives for children, my son is a very picky eater and there was absolutely nothing on the menu for him (nothing was suggested by the server)\\nanyways we took a little to order our wine but there was no recommendations and the server seem a little annoyed that we were taking our time. frankly the wine list at this place is a bit overwhelming and they should focus more on having the server explain and point to some good wines at different price points.\\n\\nwe didn't order any appetizer and finally order our dinner. I ordered a chicken with polenta and broccoli rave. I couldn't eat the broccoli rave it was extremely bitter .. however I am aware of the bitterness of broccoli rave but this broccoli rave was extremely bitter... once again .. the polenta was pretty good but the chicken was dry.\\nalso my mother order the pistachio salmon and it came over cooked with the asparagus under cooked... she also mention that the beets weren't fresh THEY WERE BEETS FROM A METAL CAN!!! highly disappointed ..\\n\\nwe didn't  order dessert and honestly WE WILL NEVER GO BACK ...\\n\\nour bill was 500 dollars and no one person left happy ! : (!\\n\\nI didn't make a big deal out of it because I didn't want to  ruin the night.. but I'm still upset about it, since I was the one that pick the place"},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Worth the wait.

Now I know the line looks intimidating and very painful, but I'd say that it is well worth the wait.

However, it does give you plenty of time to plan out what you would like to eat, and trust me, you'll need plenty of time because literally everything on the menu looks SUPER yummy.  I couldn't decide even after standing in line for 45minutes and even then I made a split second decision and decided to go with a special written on the board.  The restaurant is very small and crowded, full of the hustle and bustle atmosphere, which makes you slightly hyper while eating.  Everything looks good, but what they feature is a great pasta, with different types of sauces that all sound yummy.\\n\\nWe got the calamari because everyone was raving about it on yelp and boy was it yummy.  I tried some of the lobster ravioli, which was SO full of flavor and lobster.  I also tried the squash ravioli, which to my shock, was BETTER than the lobster ravioli.  I got the homemade fucili with lobster and shrimp with the friacomo sauce.  SO AMAZING, full of flavor, basically a fricken explosion in your mouth with some spice and zest to it.  LOVED IT and could not stop eating it even though I was stuffed because the flavor was so amazing.  \\n\\nThe other downside to this place is that it is cash only, which makes it some what a hassle, but well worth it.

I'll review the food, drinks, & service from each visit.\\n\\nRound 1: I met up with a friend at the bar for brunch, but I had already eaten. I ordered an original mimosa. The price was spot on and the service was quick. The staff at the bar were super friendly! I soon got hungry and ordered \\"oh, just a frito pie....\\" with vegetarian chili. I should have gone with the meaty stuff, but mind you this is the first chili I've had since leaving Texas a few months prior, and nothing really compares. The toppings were just the way I like it - sour cream, cheese, green onions. I miss frito pie...\\n\\nRound 2: I took a friend from South Korea to Surly Girl for brunch, and the atmosphere was definitely an experience for her. I encouraged her to get a mimosa and sadly, she had forgotten her ID. The waiter said he couldn't serve her, so I asked if he would make a virgin drink of some sort for her. Her drink looked (and tasted) just as good as mine. She was very concerned about her check at the end of the meal and told the waiter it wasn't right since she wasn't charged for the drink, and he said he wasn't going to charge her for it. I think it made her day. I had the Oven-Baked French Toast, Surly-style with cranberries, a berry cream cheese drizzle, and pecans. Delicious. Came with potatoes and orange slices, and while the potatoes weren't all that spectacular, it didn't matter because I could hardly finish the french toast on its own! Definitely would order this again!\\n\\nRound 3: Most recently, I went to SG with a large group of friends for my birthday dinner. Bodega down the street had been too crowded, so we hopped on over to SG, a space we knew we'd be welcome. We had 8 people initially this Saturday night, and they set us up in their back room. On this particularly cold night, I ordered a warm surly cider, and it was the perfect thing to warm my bones. The service was prompt and patient with my [somewhat intoxicated] friends who had never been before and seemed to be having trouble with the menu. It all worked out. We left just before the comedy began. \\n\\nDefinitely one of the friendliest places in town, the price is just right, and the atmosphere is one-of-a-kind.

Neither of us had happy memories of this dinner, as we were both in a sickness-induced fog of miserableness. I never had any interest in returning to this restaurant, but when I set out to visit each of the highest rated #-Z restaurants in Boston, I realized Craigie on Main would be mandated to be re-visited. We headed over with minimal expectations...and we were blown away by the experience.\\n\\nLocated between the Central and Kendall/MIT T stops, Craigie on Main is also car-friendly, with some street-parking as well as valet available. An interesting mix of local seasonal New England cuisine with French techniques, Craigie on Main has moved towards the top of my Boston-area favorites.\\n\\nWe arrived (a bit late) for our reservation, and were told that there was a recent cancellation for the chef's counter, and were asked if we would like to sneak on in. We snatched the opportunity to peek into the kitchen, and plopped ourselves front and center.\\n\\nThe whole restaurant is focused on the open kitchen, which is a nice change, but does create a bit of a bustle for those that don't have front-row seats like we did. Fortunately, there are many mirrors placed throughout the dining room so diners are able to see bits and pieces of the cooking.\\n\\nEvery night the menu may change, but there are always prix fix menus along with tasting menus of 6- or 8-courses available. T and I went with the prix fix as we had our eyes on certain items already. After ordering, we were surprised with one amuse bouche each, for T, a mussel, and for me, a beef heart pastrami with spicy mustard.  \\n\\nAs an appetizer, T went with the house-made farro flour spaccatelli with wild boar and forest mushroom rago√ªt. T reported this was very savory, and I stole a piece of the spaccatelli which I can report was very rich & tasty. I went with the grilled Spanish octopus with grilled cipollini onion, green olive & lemon salad, bulgur wheat, and chorizo pur√©e. Soft, delicate, and delicious, this was the perfect light appetizer. We were also amazed by how large our appetizers were.\\n\\nFor entrees, I chose the slow roasted chicken breast (since I love restaurant chicken so much) with chicken sausage, dried apricots, forest mushrooms, spring-dug carrots, and a scotch whisky jus. This is the dish that single-handedly blew me away. This chicken has undoubtedly moved to the top of my Boston-restaurant-chicken list...a hard list to even get near. Moist, tender, and flavorful, the combinations on the plate were unbelievable.  \\n\\nTravis went with the Vermont pork three ways: suckling confit, spice crusted rib, smoked & grilled belly with russett apple pur√©e, turnips, port-soaked pruned, and maitake mushrooms. The confit melted in his mouth while the rib was crispy and moist. The grilled belly reportedly paired well with the mushrooms. We also split a side of duck-fat roasted brussel sprouts, which were fresh, crispy & scrumptous. \\n\\nAs T was stuffed and out of commission for dessert, I took control and ordered for us (....me, really). I have always loved anything malted, and the moment I read those four little letters on the menu (m-a-l-t) it was decided. We got the malted milk parfait, with honey roasted peanuts & a chocolate sorbet. I allowed T to have 2 bites, but then after tasting this dish, I hoarded it for myself. This dessert is easily in my top-2 desserts in Boston. Unbelievably tasty, the contrasting textures harmonized into an amazing flavorful bite. Bits of chocolate brownie, a small almost peanut-buttery-caramel textured bit, with crunchy pieces resembling cocoa crispies and the salty honey roasted peanuts...I was in food-heaven after bite one. \\n\\nWe will most definitely be back to Craigie on Main. I now have the Chef's Whim's tasting menu on my to-visit list. Every Sunday after 9pm, chef Tony Maws will cook up a discounted 4- or 6-course tasting menu on a whim.\\n\\nPictures and more on -- ----"},{"name":"The Porter Beer Bar","address":"1156 Euclid Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Great selection of beers.

This was a nice options because we were hungry and wanted to eat right away.  \\n\\nDecor is a dive bar type decor, definitely more of a bar and a eclectic flair to it, it definitely feels like a bar that does brunch.

The menu description said it best --don't be afraid to pick up the bone with your hands as I was licking every piece of the meat and juices off every inch of the bone and plate left. The white rice and cabbage went perfectly well together to even out how flavorful the oxtail meat was. In addition, I ordered the Pollo Frito ($6) off the HH menu too. The chicken here was also super tender as well, but the flavor was standard. There's definitely something special about how delicate the meats are cooked here.\\n\\nI was also able to sneak a bite from the rest of my party, which consisted of a variety of Empanadas ($4.50). Although I'm not a huge fan of empanadas, these were definitely one of the most soft and not dry ones I've had. Our table also had an order of the Yuca Frita ($6) to share, which I found quite bland. While the food was good (especially the rabo encendido), our service was quite mixed. It started off fine until our server confused us by reinstating that we could not take home anything ordered from the HH menu even if we insisted that we'd pay for the regular menu price in order to take it home. They did try to make it up to us by giving us a complimentary dessert, especially because this upset the birthday girl in our party. In the end, we refused the complimentary dessert, but they still brought out a cake for us to sing happy birthday nonetheless."},{"name":"Strega Italiano - Seaport","address":"One Marina Park Dr","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The food was good but not great, we sat outside on the patio, poor service the waitress was nice but I feel they were very understaffed, I ordered lamb and didn't get a steak knife, I waited 10 mins for one after my meal was already on the table.

It allowed me to keep my car parked at the convention center and enjoy some of Bostons best seafood and service without getting beat up by the commute.\\nI walked from the parking lot directly after the day sessions and was able to get a seat at the bar.  That's when I met bartenders Drew, Heather and Josh.  Drew really hooked me with his friendly enthusiastic down to earth demeanor and detailed description of the plentiful assortment of Raw Oysters that change daily.  I have a certified nose for seafood due in part to my FDA experience which I'm glad is over.  I chose a selection of 6 different types and was very pleased with each one.  I also had the clam chowder and the lobster roll which were savory and several steps above the usual .  This told me I was not eating at a tourist trap.  I was also able to try the Snapper Ceviche and Yam chips based on Heathers recommendation and I was so amazed by the flavors.  \\nThe best part of the experience was feeling like I was welcomed  and appreciated for asking more about the food and drinks served.  Josh introduced me to a serving of a the German Fest beer which was fantastic.  I was also able to try a few others on tap and get an idea of the selections available. Josh served me at the bar during my last visit and waited patiently as a gentleman finished a conversation with me observant that it was an important discussion for him to convey.  Part of experience here is the people you sit next to who so appreciate the food and service that it makes it memorable . So what?!...So I returned again two evenings later and again on my last day.  Each time I had a new selection of oysters and a new dish and another great conversation with a fellow diner .  The Fish collar recommended by Heather was so well prepared and seasoned and something I never had before.  She really showed me the capability of the kitchen and was very personable and enthusiastic about her job.   The collar had a strong flavor that was beautifully contrasted and merged with the white sauce and seasoning.  Sometimes you can eat a well prepared meal and feel like you were just served.  Here instead I felt like I was part of the conversation . I've been to many restaurants that served great food but left me feeling empty.  I don't mind paying a little extra for a place that treats you as well as a table of 4 .Thank you Row 34.  Take note .  I must make special mention of the burger with fried oysters .

First we tried the chicken wings, which were pretty tender and crispy, but the sauce definitely overwhelmed after a few bites. Then we got the Kimchi pancake, which was a bit on the soggy side and definitely not as good as the other Korean pancakes I have had in the past. Finally we got the Dan Dan noodle and the Short Rib rice, which again were too heavily flavored.

We were greeted right away and sat right away by our server, who then walked away before coming back to take our drink orders.  We got a bottle of sake (sho chiku bai nigori, a cold unfiltered bottle my boyfriend and I love) and that came out fast. We ordered appetizers and said we weren't sure about sushi yet. The server attempted to name his favorites, but got stuck after the first ingredient on his 'favorite' roll. Slightly awkward, but he recovered ok. We had to wait another 10 minutes before he came back for our orders, and we each ordered a roll and asked if we could have a side of hibachi veggies with white sauce. At this point we were the only table in the place.\\n\\nAs we waited we were looking around, taking in the atmosphere (sleek, inviting, very nice overall) and the man we only assume is the manager is leaning over the bar on his phone...for awhile. Weird, but there's no one else here so we brush it off. We get our appetizers. The calamari is super good, crisp and hot. The edamame didn't seem freshly steamed, as some beans were hot and some were ice cold. Still tasty though.\\n\\nAt this point we notice our server walking away from the restaurant through the window. We were confused. Cue the sushi chef calling back to the kitchen saying 'order up'. No one comes out. We know its ours. Then the manager walks onto the floor and calls someone on his cell phone. We hear him ask 'where are you' and then say 'yeah your order is up'. ...?!?! What manager wouldn't just bring the food over?\\n\\nThen another server, a very nice pregnant girl, brings our food and greets another table that has just walked in. She only brought the rolls, and told us our server was on a delivery. Ok, deliveries are cool, but why send the one server who had a table at the time, and why wasn't there communication with management? We flagged down the poor girl as she was walking away from taking the other tables order and asked about our hibachi veggies. She said she'd check. They clearly were never rung in. The rolls were awesome though! Hat's off to the sushi chef. I had the Hulk Smash with no avocado, and it's a super pretty roll covered in green tempura spinach crumbs. My boyfriend had the MR. Fancy, which is a souped up spicy tuna and he said it was fantastic.\\n\\nAbout 12 minutes later the manager dropped  off our veggies and kind of asked as he flew by if we were ok. We had to call him back to ask if we could have the white sauce. We had already pretty much finished our rolls at this point. \\n\\nWeird experience with no explanation.

A side order of 6 perfectly seasoned (emphasis on the *perfectly seasoned*) and perfectly fried green tomatoes.  Maybe the best I've ever had outside of homemade! Not exaggerating! \\n\\nChris checked back frequently, always bringing mimosa's, and our table was kept clean and clear by him and another younger lady (manager?).  And when the check was delivered we saw that our mimosa's were comped! Bottomless mimosa's included in the price of our brunch? WIN! \\n\\nAll in all, it was perfect service, great food, and I hope Chris gets props for a job well done! \\n\\nThe only thing we found that sucked? Their Blood Mary.  It was pretty much Vodka and tomato juice - no pepper, salt, celery, olives, shrimp - nothin'.  But honestly, the banana nut bread that came out made up for it, so now we just know not to order a Bloody there - bottomless mimosa's ALL the way! \\n\\nSo to everyone who's reviewed Circa in the past and found them lacking, I urge you to give 'em another chance!

The mimosas for $1 and bloody marys for $3 seemed like a good deal, but I didn't want to drink. I was looking for healthy food options and maybe that is why the food menu was unappealing. There was only one egg dish on the Brunch menu and it was covered in queso and bacon. Don't get me wrong, I love queso and bacon, but I also like the option of just ordering a veggie omlete somtimes. I ended up ordering the grilled fish tacos because this was one of the healthiest things I could find. The fish was pretty bland tasting and I don't think I would order it again. \\n\\nThe menu mostly offered, pizza, burgers, and typical fried bar food.

If you see reviews saying you can't find Stone Ruination anywhere here, then it's not much to go on (as Cafe Intermezzo even surves Stone Ruination).  They also have a decent whiskey selection (though not as deverse as the beer).  The food is also much better then Brickstore too (haven't tried Brickstore's \\"actual\\" restaurant Cakes and Ale, but found Brickstore is just good as a local pub hangout): Porter is definitely a cut above regular bar food...but it's a bit of a shame because it is hard to have a casual dinner there.\\n\\nThe main negative aspect I'd mention is that it's a pretty small space for trying to have dinner with a family or on a date.

The interior reminds me of Key West with the blue tile & disco ball, but there's somewhat of a retro feel as well. I guess that conflicts with the bumpin' contemporary music they blasted throughout the evening. Such a bustling atmosphere for a random weeknight!\\nAnyway, this seems like the place in Inman Park right now for happy hour. The drinks are strong & very reasonably priced. Chips come automatically, which is always a plus in my book. The queso was like most queso - always reminds me of Elmer's glue in consistency - but tasted just dandy & they even asked us if we wanted it with or without jalapenos. The service was on point for us the entire evening & everyone was so accommodating. \\nFor the main course, I ordered the chicken fajitas, which I think was the standout of all our orders, if I do say so myself. Filled with zucchini, onions, peppers, & other veggies, they offer both flour & corn tortillas as well... love that! Not only was it enough to feed all of Somalia, it popped with flavor & literally came out sizzling. One girl ordered the soup, which was also mammoth in size, but that doesn't really appeal to me in a mexican restaurant. The tacos looked slightly over-garnished, but no one complained. One girl ordered the tilapia salad & I just may have to get on that next time... looked scrumptious! Finally, we topped off the evening with Key Lime Pie, which was like none other I've ever tasted. I'm not usually a fan, but this thing was money!!! More like a whipped Key Lime Cheesecake & had the best buttery graham cracker crust to boot.

It's just as good as Zocalo--but with cocktails!\\" I don't know why it didn't occur to me that, realistically, this means Zocalo must have better food, because it has achieved the same rating as Acitron, even without liquor!

We paid more for drinks and one appetizer at A, than we did for entrees and sangria at Z. \\n\\nCurious about the details? \\n\\n1. The menu. The menu is so limited that if you have any strong food issues (dislikes, allergies, -isms), you might have a tough time finding something to order. My partner, who doesn't care for mushrooms, zucchini, goat cheese, or seafood, and also doesn't care for random cream sauces or nuts in his food) literally couldn't find a single thing on the menu he actually thought he'd like. If we'd stayed, I could have managed to come up with something I thought I'd enjoy, by creatively combining elements from multiple entrees on the menu, but there was no single item I wanted to order (in addition to being a 'vegequarian', I can't stand sour cream or cilantro, and also don't much care for shrimp). It sounds like we're just picky, but it's actually uncanny how the entire menu seemed to feature elements of the things we happen to dislike most. The 13 entree selections seem so few when neither of us can find even one that sounds worth the price. I considered the salmon, but I'm not a big fan of salmon or beds of spinach, and so to pay more than $20 for an entree of things I'm not all that fond of seemed crazy when Zocalo is right down the street. If I were at someone's wedding, and were served a plate of salmon on a bed of spinach, I'd eat it and wouldn't mind it. But when I'm at a restaurant and being asked to pay around $20 per entree, I want to order something I actually like. \\n\\n2. The service. I found it interesting that my partner ordered a Chambord margarita and it came with salt on the rim. The waiter didn't ask whether he wanted it that way (although he had asked me how I wanted my jalapeno margarita--which I did enjoy), he just brought it that way. I learned this when I was almost finished with my margarita and noticed my partner wasn't drinking his. I asked the waiter to bring another one without salt, and I finished the one with salt. It wasn't great, but by then my glass had been empty for a bit. We did get charged for both of them, of course. Another issue is that I tried to get an app order in early. Several minutes later, the waiter arrived to take what I assumed would be the order for entrees (although by then we'd decided we were going to have the app and bail), and the first thing he said was \\"Ok, so you want the queso fundido appetizer to start?\\" and it was clear he hadn't even put the app order in that whole time! Then, when I got the fundido without the chorizo, they randomly put portobello mushrooms in it! (Recall earlier when I said my bf hates mushrooms...). The waiter also randomly tried to take things away when I wasn't finished with them, while meanwhile ignoring empty dishes from things that were blatantly finished.\\n\\nThe quality of the food isn't bad, but the selection is so limited and the service so random that I strongly recommend Zocalo (right down Broadway) instead. Predictably, we had a fine meal at Zocalo. And that's what I love about Zocalo--I always have a fine meal there (and their nachos are THE BEST)."},{"name":"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","address":"3825 Lake Austin Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Oh Mozarts, how can you go wrong?

We were first taken to a dirty table (food still left on the table and needed a good wipe down).  I ordered a Persian stew (dried lemon, cilantro, beef, tomatoes, etc) and my girlfriend ordered the veggie delight.  I had the distinct impression that our dinner was just leftovers from the buffet at lunch.  Our 'dinner' came out in literally two minutes....just long enough to heat up in the microwave. I understand that there's no need to waste perfectly good food, but don't call items on your dinner menu unique if there just the same as what's been served hours before.  The menu was pretty boring as well...nothing really jumped out at us.  \\n\\nI could go on about how this place used to be better, but that'd take too long.

Friendly, kind, and attentive.  A bit slow towards the end of the meal, but whatever, we just had to ask for the check.  I've always been impressed at how this place is always bumpin', and the patio during the warmer months is always lively.  Inman Park these days in general is full of action now that the beltline is in swing, so it's no surprise!  It's definitely a fun time and you will enjoy yourself here on the patio.  I was also impressed that they had a GF menu which is my standard question these days.  The GF menu was awesome--it basically called out which items on the regular menu was GF and if you needed to do any special requests to ensure it's really GF (i.e. ordering the hamburguesa without the bun).  By the way I digress to say...\\"lamburguesa\\" is a fun play on words and brilliant!  Yep, it's on the menu!\\n\\nThat's sadly where the good things stopped.  We've definitely had better chips and salsa elsewhere.  Even Moe's and Willie's I would say has tastier chips.  These just tasted so fried and average.  The salsa was a-ok.  Nothing super special and I couldn't tell how fresh it was.  My 2-chicken taco meal was disappointing.  The flavors just weren't there and it was bland.  My husband ordered the tostada de tinga.  Also said the same thing.  And he never leaves food on his plate, and he left about 1/4 of his meal.  I guess there was something about the chipotle chicken that was in both of our dishes that we just felt was plain and average.  So I can only wonder if we ordered the wrong things because some of the other meals looked really good like the specialties.  And some of my fellow reviewers raved about the drinks.

Been a while since I have had the occasion and pleasure to be in the Austin area and have an opportunity to revisit this great establishment.  While in Austin for a KW Commercial retreat - we were treated with a trip to Salt Lick and a full BBQ dinner.  About 175 of us gathered in a banquet room and lined up for all we cared to eat.... cole slaw, potatoes, Brisket, Ribs, Sausage, Chicken, beans, bread, etc. all topped off with Peach Cobbler and Blackberry Cobbler with ice cream.  Wow.  What a feast. \\nThe pork ribs were as good as it gets and as good as I have ever eaten - even those I cook on my own grill.  Ditto on the beef brisket.  Tender and very tasty.  Sausage was OK.  Chicken was OK but I like my own BBQ better.  Most enjoyable and good times had by all who were there.  Well worth the trip (about 45 minutes south of Austin although there is another newer version located in Round Rock - about 15 miles north of Austin).  As one who frequently cooks BBQ - to see the mounds and mounds of meat on the serving line was a beautiful site.    One at our table - a current resident of Austin (I myself was born and raised there) had his own version of a Texas BBQ desert..... sliced sausage and ice cream.  Ya know - I am kind of thinking what Blue Bell ice cream tastes like with BBQ sauce and sliced sausage.... but - I opted for more ribs instead.  Wow - wish I had some NOW.

The atmosphere was abuzz with the chatter of a younger crowd (I hate the quiet super-formal places). \\n\\nFood-wise, I started with a delicious French onion soup. The cheese was velvety soft and the soup wasn't too salty (relatively speaking). Next up was the beef tartare. The meat was very fresh and the raw quail egg only added to the flavor. SO GOOD!  This was probably my favorite dish of the evening. Size-wise, the total volume of meat was equivalent to a small apple so I needed a bit more. I decided to order a filler - the spinach and mushroom ravioli. I have no idea why I'd order pasta in a French restaurant but this turned out to be an excellent choice. The pasta was well cooked an extremely delicious. I finished the food off with a bottle of Kronenbourg Blanc (one of my faves). \\n\\nValue-wise, prices are on the higher side but for the quality, I could justify making a repeat visit.

Am I missing something?  Aside from the chic ambiance and fantastic views, the service was most certainly lacking.\\n\\nMy sister, cousin, and I arrived relatively early for our 9:15 reservation last Saturday night.  But, we were seated pretty quickly as our reservation time approached.  That's as quick as anything went for usfor the entire duration of the meal.\\n\\nWe had gotten a round of beverages at the bar before we were seated, so I can forgive the waiter for not immediately coming over to our table at the beginning of our meal.  We were all catching up with each other as well, so we did appreciate not having our waiter up our butts while we were sipping on our first round of cocktails.  He did come by and ran down the specials for the night and took our order for a bottle of Pinot Grigio (can't beat Santa Margherita on an immensely hot, humid, and oppressive evening!)\\n\\nAbout 10 minutes later, our bottle of wine came and we ordered the buffalo mozzarella, tomato, and prosciutto appetizer special.  At the waiter's recommendation, we got the 4 person serving.  We were getting a little starved at this point, so we did put in our order for dinner as well.  The appetizer came out in about 15-20 minutes... close to the point in time where we were going to start gnawing on our arms for sustinence... \\n\\nThe serving was way too big for the 3 of us, but it was delicious nonetheless.  We only were able to eat about 60% of the plate.  It was kind of a waste to get the larger serving, but ahhh well.  \\n\\nSo, 35-40 minutes goes by... no sign of our entrees... waiter... life...\\n\\nI was getting a little irritated.  I am pretty patient when it comes to slow service, but when we're reaching 10:30-45 and we haven't even had the main course... come on now.  I finally spoke up and let the waiter know that I wasn't terribly upset his service personally, since it was a busy night, but each course took a significant amount of time to come out and it was getting a tad ridiculous.  Obviously, the kitchen was backed up and he couldn't be faulted for it.\\n\\nFinally, our meals come out.  I had the Lobster Ravioli, my sister had the Chicken & Mushroom risotto, and my cuz had Pasta Bolognese.  I've had the Lobster Ravs at the North End location and had been blown away.  It seems as though the quality control from the North End location never made its way to the Waterfront.  The raviolis were average at best and there were 3 measly pieces of lobster randomly placed on top.  The risotto should have been renamed \\"Bowl of Grilled Chicken with a side of ride\\" because I didn't see any ooey gooey risotto goodness in that bowl at all.  It was overtaken by massive hunks of chicken instead.  Very disappointing.  My cousin's meal was just okay.\\n\\nWe were rewarded with 2 desserts of our choice and glasses of Limoncello on the house to make up for the experience.  But, I feel as though we didn't get our bang for our buck and we spent a pretty decent amount of money on a sub-par meal.

(So if you prefer the thick rubbery crusts of Uno's or Domino's, this place is not for you...since you have no taste!)  They are well known for using the best ingredients, cooked to perfection, served with Flair (No...not Rick Flair, the Professional Wrestler, But with a certain elegance mixed with √âlan) \\n\\nWe ordered a \\"Large Hawaiian\\" (no...they did not bring out a fat person from Hawaii) a large Hawaiian is a large cheese pizza with pineapple and ham (for under $20 with two drinks, it's a real steal for a nice dinner for two). At most pizza places you would need to be crazy to order this since the pineapple is straight from a can (leaving your pizza with a dreaded \\"canny\\" taste) and ham that was frozen (eeeeewwww!!!) But at Pino's the pineapple comes from a pineapple (who would have guessed) and the ham from a high end deli, so it gives your pizza that \\"ooo...its soooo good!\\" quality. The cheese is great to but it is the sauce that really sets Pino's apart. With the rising cost of tomatoes, most pizza places use the worst quality of sauce (That is why pizza tested better when you were a kid) But Pinos uses the highest quality of tomato sauce; more akin to what is on your $80 pasta dinner at the finest North end eateries then a pizza place.

Everything is fresh and well made and, although it's classic American fare, it's fairly creative for the price point. I really like the Portobella Sandwich is probably my favorite thing on the lunch menu. \\n\\nSadly, the second reason I'm always hungry when I think about Daedalus is the service, while always pleasant, is always frustratingly slow. I can't tell you how many times I've seen salads that I thought have sounded great, but by t\\\\he time the server is even ready to take our order I am always way to hungry to be satisfied by leafy greens. \\n\\nOverall, I really like this place. It's nice, tasty, fresh, inexpensive, right around the corner from my office, and has a sweet roof deck in the warmer months.

What is his name again?!\\n- Didn't they have a beer special?  Check!  Oh wow, they have a drink special that has to be the best in Atlanta:  a 24 oz. PBR beer, and a shot of Jager for $5.... Although it is tempting, I am not trying to get wasted at this hour.  Plus, I did waaaaaayyy too much Jager in college.\\n(Ordered Fried Green Tomatoes which insured the 4 stars for this spot... They were melt-in-your-mouth good!  And they also have entrees there for $8 every day, or at least every weekday.)\\n- Gosh I wish I could smoke in here... But I am sure other people appreciate it being non- smoking.\\n(go outside, to have a cigarrette) \\n- Geez, this place needs a patio, I am thinking 3.5 stars.\\n\\nUpon re-entry into the place, my Fried Green Tomatoes were there.  Soooo yummy.\\n\\nAnd although there is no patio, no smoking (hell, I need to quit anyhow), and it was a little dead, it still deserves a 4.  I mean, that drink special is just calling at you to pre-drink there.  They also have a good selection of beers, and are located smack dab in Inman Park, which is beautiful.

We never had to wait long for the cook, the hibachi cooking is fun, especially our kids were fascinated (and a little frightened) by the fire on the hot plate. Great variety of food, ambitious menu (although we have never come to trying sushi there). \\nThe quality of meat and seafood/fish is excellent. We've tried steak, scallops, shrimp and ahi tuna, all delicious. Salad and soup is included. It is not cheap but worth it. \\nNegatives: cooking is very standardized, zero individuality chef to chef. They are taught one string of actions, so it is already boring the second time you are there. I would prefer them to use less soy sauce when cooking as it dominates very much. The standard soup is a little strange, tastes like broth. Only one dipping sauce (cocktail) that is uninteresting.

Not having technology section could be a serious turn off to computer geeks like myself, however, I find it nice refreshment not to be surrounded with capitalism related books.\\nI think that this place represents as a nice getaway from modern technology(although there is a section of technology magazines, but not books) and is serving as a nice sanctuary to literature and spirituality. I think this factor owes to the owners/founders - a married hippie couple from Vermont.\\n\\nI know there are bookstores out there where combine cafe and bookstore, but Trident is the first one as far as I remember.

I honestly expected Islands of Adventure to be the much better than Universal, but i can say without a doubt that this park exceeded my expectations.  I actually preferred it to IOA. For starters, The Simpsons ride is hands down the best ride i have ever been on. Remember, Harry Potter is not part of Universal Studios as you see in many reviews. This is a completely seperate theme park. There is a separate Yelp category for Islands of Adventure. The Rip-Ride-Rocket is one of the best roller coasters i have ever experienced as well. The music while heading completely vertical is a new experience in itself. I recently visited Disney world, and most likely because i had no kids, i found Universal as a whole a MUCH better park. Shrek 4D and Revenge of the Mummy were very unique and were a blast. I will say ET and Twister are SEVERELY outdated. I wouldnt be surprised to find both of these rides replaced within the next year. MEN IN BLACK was a great interactive ride, but it has nothing on the Midway Mania (disneys comparable ride).

I'm not kidding with ya! I've been here on first dates because it's great for conversation; I've been here with large groups and the staff is always accommodating (doesn't hurt that Molly, the owner, is a high school friend); and it's always got SOMETHING going on whether it's a beer pairing dinner or introducing a new brew. LOVE it. \\n\\nMoving back to Atlanta after living in New York for a couple of years, I got a taste of rare beers and stellar beer bars. I will say this place beats them all (yes, even the ones on 9th Ave)! It's cozy, yet large. It's friendly, yet the staff still beats their asses to help customers get what they want/need fast. And it has the best and most diverse beer list around. I know Taco Mac and the Brickstore tout their never-ending lists as well, but the Porter does it for me. \\n\\nI've had their dinners before and walked away more than satisfied. Their burger AND organic black bean burger are great (although I've seen unhappy diners push their black bean burger aside)--the seasoned fries on the side are fab. The mac and cheese app could serve as a meal if you get a few beers along side it. Seeing as their chef/cooks know how to prepare good food, I would say they offer more than just glorified barfood. \\n\\nThis weekend I had their amazing brunch for the first time--YUM! I had the scrambler and I was in a trance after the first bite. Their cheese grits are melt-in-your mouth yummy. Just know that they don't serve bloodys or any drinks until 12:30. \\n\\nI can't say enough about how much I adore this joint.

Stopped in to try the food since it was near my place, open until 2am and I've heard good reviews from other friends.  \\n\\nI was disappointed not only at the food but the experience.  It was my first time at Yasu and I ordered the sashimi appetizer, soft shell crab and pan fried spicy octopus with veggies and noodles.  The sashimi was not fresh.  The salmon was chewy and the white tuna was dry.  The soft shell crab had too much batter and was tasteless even with the sauce they provided.  The pan fried spicy octopus was nothing compared to what I had at Privus last week which is why I ordered it at Yasu.  It was overcooked and rubbery. \\n\\nI was pretty much set on calling it a night but was convinced to try the kalbi.  I heard the korean was good so I guess why not even if everything else was horrible.  I must say the Diamond Kalbi was very good.  The marinade was very sweet and strong.  I thought it was yummy but the sauce did become overwhelming after my third piece of meat.  Side dishes they served weren't great either.  I didn't even like the kimchi and I love kimchi!\\n\\nSo after all this, while I'm enjoying my soju, I'm told we have to pay the bill at 11:30pm because they decided they wanted to close early.  It's Friday night and before entering the restaurant, we checked the time at the door which clearly stated 2am closing time.  I asked the waitor why and he said because the chef said so.  I expressed my feelings on this explaining it was my first time and how I wouldn't have come in knowing they were going to close early.  I got a simple oh sorry response from the waitor.  \\n\\nSo I'm done with my dining experience and thought it was all over but nope.. not yet!

It was pretty quiet, we were the only table there dining in for a little while (still, it was pretty noisy in there from the Spanish-language programming blaring from the rear TV).  Place is cute, small but not cramped, and the interior decorating more stylish than you would think on first glance from the strip mall storefront (I will still never understand why people use white upholstery in a restaurant, though).  They do have the classic Peruvian charcoal-grilled chicken and a plethora a classic dishes that you know and love.  The lunch specials are a steal and include an appetizer, entree, and fountain drink.  I can't help  myself just ordered whatever strikes my fancy.  Got the Anticuchos de Corazon and they were delicious, thinly sliced, well-seasoned and marinated, and beefy (also, very large portion for an app).  The Ceviche Mixto was a large portion of a mild white fish (proably tilapia or swai), blanched ocotpus, one steamed mussel, varying sizes of shrimp with the classic Peruvian garnishes (slivered red onion, steamed sweet potato chunks, boiled chulpe).  The leche was tart and had a good warmth from the slivered jalapenos and red chiles that were steeped in it.  The fish and shrimp were a touch under-marinated for me (still quite chewy), but that might be a personal preference.  My dining companions had pasta lunch specials, both looked very good and plentiful.  The apps were very prettily plated.  Definitely on my return list for the chicken.

The place is nestled into the K-mart plaza on Orlando avenue in Winter Park.\\n\\nFirst off, papadams (think nachos from India) are on the table - no questions asked -  with the usual assortment of sauces (think Indian salsa).  Don't eat too many or you won't eat your dinner.  The menu has some unique and rarely found dishes than found in other local Indian restaurants.  I ordered the Chicken Xacuti, chicken in a rich flavorful gravy with just right balance of hot and sweet.  I ordered it hot, but would judge it to be medium spice.  The waiter seemed conscientious about not killing us with the heat although I think I could handle it.  Also on the menu - dosas - which I've only seen in one other Indian restaurant.  These are like large, thin pressed pancakes used to roll  up vegetables and sauces (think Indian fajitas). Very tasty!  Chicken Tikka Masala was pretty standard and also good.  Samosas were plump with filling and crisp on the outside.\\n\\nThe wait staff was patient, attentive and more than willing to help with the menu.  They were quick filling up the water glasses and offered more rice and papadams when we ran out.  Our waiter was nice enough to give us some rice pudding to share.  I was a nice blend of flavors, but very rich and sweet.  This is one that is best to share.\\n\\nThe decor is tactful but not real refined and the ethnic music is just a little too loud.  The restroom needed some attention with water on the floor and the soap dispenser sitting on the sink (instead of hanging on the wall.)  These minor knocks and the half-full plaza shouldn't dissuade you from giving Tamarind a try whether a seasoned Indian connoisseur or new to the cuisine.

There are several places in Orlando that attempt to offer sushi & Pho on their menu, but fail miserably as the shortcuts are clearly evident (e.g., Bento). Either the sushi is of decent quality and the Pho taste like it came from an instant package, or the Pho is decent and every sushi roll is covered in spicy mayo. Not at Sodo! \\n\\nMy favorite Pho experience is that first sip of the broth before adding garnishes. This is also an indicator of time, ingredients, and preparation that goes into creating the broth. Sodo's Pho broth has depth, richness, fragrances, and everything else a Pho lover would desire. To me, what separates a great bowl of pho from a good bowl of pho, is that I can finish a great bowl of pho without adding sriracha or hoisin sauce into the bowl. Sodo makes a great bowl of Pho!\\n\\nOnto the sushi. The sushi rolls are uniquely named after Marvel characters, which is a bit out of place because it doesn't fit the theme of the restaurant at all.

Management who had the ability to correct their attempt to overcharge seemed to delight in sticking to their guns with their new higher price for this reservation. They would rather lose a long-time (20 years) customer trying to squeeze an additional $100 out of them than to fix their error and keep a good customer. It's really unbelievable that they are so short sighted and uncaring about trying to keep a customer. Never again, Omni. We have stayed previously at Omni Southpark several times.

The presentation is in line with the atmosphere--simple, but not in the pretty minimalist bistro manner, more like a home or osteria made meal.  Fantastic and personal food (many are supposedly chef's own favorite dishes growing up).  I was surprised by how good the signature appetizer tasted partly because it seemed amusingly unspectacular, just piece of scallop on some garbanzo puree.  It's easy to mess up scallops; a lot of great places do it.  But it was knock-your-socks-off good.  I wanted to lick the plate clean when nobody was looking.  Delicious home made veal sausage.  Tuscan pasta here is superb.  Did I say rustic yet?  It's extremely substantial to bite into most of the pasta/risotto dishes here.  Try the crab farfalle and prosciutto gemelli.  Try the risotto, but be mindful that it's very filling.  The truffled rendition is earthy and too much without something lighter to go along with it.  Osso bucco charms, but I wasn't too interested in other entrees.  Delicious chocolate mousse and a good wine menu.  If I come here with a group I would get everyone to order appetizer portion of pasta/risotto and get several appetizers on top of that, so everyone gets to eat about 8 different things.  \\n\\nService is good, friendly and accommodating.

The d√©cor and ambiance was authentic and warm.   Our server greeted us promptly and was friendly, but took about 5 minutes to return for our drink orders, and took at least 10 minutes to return with our drinks.   When she returned, we ordered the Potato Cake Wada and Vegetable Puff Samosa for our appetizers.  Of the two, the Potato Cake Wada was the best.  For our entrees, my wife ordered the Malvani Roasted Coconut Curry (hot) with organic chicken and I ordered the chicken Vindaloo(medium hot).  Although the appetizers were served in a timely manner, we had to wait a very long time for our entrees, and our server did not come back to check on us or take up our empty appetizer dishes.  The only other server working that night passed by our table numerous times empty-handed and never once offered to pick up our dishes or help her fellow server. When our entrees finally arrived (brought by kitchen staff), the food was excellent.  The Malvani was a little too spicy for my wife (and she likes spicy), but that was her fault, not the chef's, as our server warned her of the intensity when she placed the order. \\nWhen we were getting ready to pay, our server said if we paid cash, we would receive a 5% discount.  This was also written on the inside of the payment folder.  It appears that New India is lowering  their tax rate, which left a bad taste in our mouths as tax paying  Americans the week of July 4.  So, despite the food being  5 stars, because of the poor service and the questionable accounting practices, I can only give New India 3 stars.  \\nOn a positive note, we will go back for the 5 star food and give them another chance to improve their service, unless, of course they are shut down for tax evasion."},{"name":"Volare Restaurant and Bar","address":"388 Broadway","city":"Revere","stars":"4","text":"After one visit I'm hooked!

Of course we understand the risk that there might not be a table available, as we do any time we choose to go to a restaurant.

Depending on how many Shiners or Lonestars I filled up on before ordering usually dictates how many beef ribs I'll go for and whether or not I'll go with a plate that includes the sides.  Give them a try if you are burnt out on the same old family-style."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Amazing.

My favorite was the Mezzes - a beautifully crafted plate of hummus, eggplant, carrot puree, salad, small heirloom tomatoes and falafel. We ended with their waffles - one with chocolate topping and the other with their white chocolate pistachio rosewater. By this time we were stuffed, but we were so glad to have tried these!

The cole slaw was fresh, very tasty and had a lil' asian flare to it, while the potato was good but different, it was served cold on purpose. I couldn't figure out if it was a potato salad (cold) or homestyle potatoes (looks)  lol. The bread was homemade, served warm  and very, very soft and super good.\\n\\nMeats: The brisket was marbled and very tender, tasty and smoky; the pork ribs were well smoked and maybe a bit over done, but tasty; the turkey was tender but had no smoked flavor, i would not recommend the turkey--after all turkey is turkey; The sausage was well, sausage. nothing special, and also not recommended by me. Almost forgot, the beef rib. The beef rib was very meaty and tender but I didn't like the glaze the Salt Lick used on it, I found it to be too sweet. If they offer BBQ sauce on the tables, I don't think they need to glaze the meat. JMO\\n\\nThe Salt Lick had 2 types of BBQ sauce and they were both very good. One was spicy and the other mild.

As soon as we walked in the door, I knew we were in trouble. There were throngs of people standing around waiting to be seated. The wait ended up being only twenty minutes, but still! A reservation is a reservation. I could tell the hostesses were really frazzled. \\"It must be chaos in the kitchen, too,\\" I commented.\\n\\nOh, how right I was. Some other server tried to bring out our entrees before our soup (mine) and salad (sister's). They didn't put the dressing on the side, as my sister requested (yeah, I know... who does that?). My roasted tomato soup was dripping down the side of the cup and was as watery as can be. You could make a richer tomato soup at home with a can of Campbell's. When I mentioned to our server that they brought out our entrees too early, he responded offhandedly \\"it'll be fine\\" before rushing away. Not once throughout the entire meal did anybody come by and ask how we were enjoying our food.\\n\\nBy now, you may be thinking, \\"Wowza! Even for Restaurant Week, that sounds kind of lousy. Andrea totally must've clicked on the wrong star rating!\\" But actually, four stars is correct. And that's because our entrees were so out-of-this-world good, that everything else ceased to matter. I got the filet and my sister got the NY strip. My filet was tender, perfectly cooked to medium as I requested, and well-seasoned. My sister claimed that she was equally impressed. Sides consisted of garlic mashed potatoes and a very creamy creamed spinach.\\n\\nAfter seeing some absolutely amazing drink photos on Yelp, we couldn't resist trying a couple of cocktails. Both my raspberry cosmo and my sister's blueberry mojito were very strong but delicious.\\n\\nDessert was warm bread pudding with whiskey sauce and an assortment of berries on the side. It was small, but the bread pudding was to die for.\\n\\nTo sum up, we got so-so appetizers, rockin' entrees and sides, and delicious desserts, for $33 bucks each. Drinks were pricy and brought up the tab significantly, but if you skip the alcohol, you've got yourself an amazing RW deal. Service was terribly inattentive.

We had a great view of their impressive pizza oven.  Next time I go there I may actually ask to be seated in that area.  It's set up like a \\"pizza bar\\".   As you would sit at a bar with your bartender at Mast' you can sit at the pizza bar with your pizza chef and dine there.  \\n\\nOur server was Rebecca.  She was very friendly and attentive---but not overly attentive.  She was very knowledgable of the menu.  \\n\\nWe started with the Wellfleet oysters.  My husband and I are big fans of oysters but the friends we were dining with are not---so we just ordered 5 to share.  They were delicious.  \\n\\nWe got the fried calamari appetizer.  Mixed in with the fried calamari were some tasty cherry peppers which were also fried in the batter.  It was great.  \\n\\nThe 3rd and final app we ordered was the \\"piatti di salumi e formaggi italiani\\"--essentially this is italian cold cuts and cheese.  I can't tell you how delicious this was.  The prosciutto di parma was cut a bit on the thicker side (versus being sliced very thin for a sandwich).  The prosciutto along with the salami was drizzled with a thick balsamic glaze.  I could have eaten the prosciutto as a meal.  It was outstanding.  There were long, thick chunks of parmigiano reggiano.  This was served in a bowl made of----cheese!  We ended up breaking the bowl up into pieces and eating it, too.  \\n\\nMain meals:\\nMy meal was the linguine with clams.  I am a huge fan of linguine with clams.  That being said I am also a huge critic of linguine with clams.  This dish was fantastic.  The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.  There were a TON of clams in there.  It was a \\"white sauce\\" with cherry tomatoes.  The cherry tomatoes were gently broken up in the sauce.  I did need to add a bit of crushed red pepper, salt and crushed black pepper--but there was a lot of clam flavor in the sauce.  A simple dish which was beautifully done.  I'd prefer to have to add the seasoning to my food rather than have the chef overdo it and then not be able to do anything about it---so I was very pleased with simply having to add some seasoning to my dish.  \\n\\nMy husband and his friend shared 2 dishes.  They had a pizza and a pasta dish.  The pizza was the \\"Saporita\\"--which literally translates to \\"tasty\\".  OMG was this tasty.  It had broccoli rabe, sausage, olive oil and parmiggiano reggiano.  UNBELIEVABLE.  The crust was amazing.  I will definitely get this as an appetizer to share with the table on our next visit.\\nThe pasta they got was Parpardelle with wild boar.  The boar was so tender and flavorful.  They ate the entire plate of pasta and boar and then asked for bread to dip into the tasty sauce on the plate.  \\n\\nThe last main meal my friend Jackie got was the Casarecce ricotta e pomodoro.  I didn't try this dish but she was loving it.  She needed some grated cheese on this dish and our server was happy to bring over a block of parmiggiano reggiano to freshly grate on the pasta.  \\n\\nFor dessert we all shared a Nutella Pizza.  DELICIOUS.  It was a pizza with nutella spread all over it.  On top of the nutella were crushed walnuts, strawberries and dollops of creme freche'.  \\n\\nThis place was outstanding.

Our new salads came fairly quickly, undressed, with Caesar dressing on the side... figures.\\n\\nWe had to try their signature appetizer of the Bang Bang Shrimp. I do love their sister restaurants Bloomin' Onion (Outback). Another let down. No great flavor, just tasted like friend shrimp in mayo. I had fortunately seen a photo online to know it came garnished in scallions, which I hate. I clearly requested none and the waiter wrote it down. Of course it came covered in scallions (waiter does not bring your food). \\n\\nAt this point I thought I would ask for a refill of my soda as our waiter and two other people bringing food had stared at my empty glass an didn't feel they should ask about a refill or simply bring one.\\n\\nAs for the meal, I got the Ahi Tuna Steak 6 oz. This is obviously the most important part of the meal. It was good and I can't complain about the tuna. I didn't like the potatoes a gratin at all. \\n\\nDessert took a while to come as they were making the fresh whipped cream or so we were told. The whipped cream was completely tasteless.\\n\\nI am not a fancy eater and tend to be fine with most things, so I was surprised at how much I actually dislike it here.

I went the next day to Western to get a helmet. I was greeted by a a staffer the moment I walked in. He was friendly and knowledgeable. He asked me questions and found out that I already own some Blackburn Flea lights. That caused him to steer me to a Bell commuter helmet with integrated rear lights that was made to take a Flea front light.

My party arrived promptly at 7:28 for a 7:30 reservation, were told that they were getting the tables set... and then waited for close to an hour to be seated. We checked in with them two different times (at 8pm and 8:15) and both times the annoyed hostess told us that there was nothing they could do, that parties had their bills on the table but weren't leaving. I understand that getting other patrons out is out of their control, but considering it seems like many, many other reviewers have had a similar experience, management really needs to take a look at their reservation system and restructure it to better reflect what their availability is. \\n\\nOur waitress was very nice and the food came promptly, but I personally thought it was nothing to write home about. The food, in my opinion, was a bit bland and didn't seem to be the homemade quality you would expect for a $20 main in the North End. (However, others at my table enjoyed their meals, so it might just have been my fettucine bolognase that didn't live up to my expectations). \\n\\nAll in all, I would suggest going to one of the many other excellent restaurants in the North End that respect the time of their customers and set realistic expectations for dining reservations.

The seafood towers & servers to take our drink orders were a bit late coming out but it was a matter of around five minutes while people chatted. That was the only bump in a wonderful and impressive evening. The food delivery was prompt and delicious. Every table's plates came out at the same time, piping hot.

Unless you don't like olives.  In which case, you should probably not get this dish.\\n-spinach chickpea casserole:  Spinach, chickpeas, cumin.  This was tasty, but not the best dish we had.

And the general manager (Danny) not to be confused with main sushi chef, Danny, and his brother Bao were gracious and wonderful hosts in our first time experience at Sodo Sushi.\\n\\nI appreciated that Danny has his parents working in the sushi kitchen, and a childhood friend manning the kitchen with great Viet food, and his sisters on the service line. A childhood friend (again, Danny) was a sushi master who created a \\"Chefs originals roll\\" based on our specifications, and he captured the things we liked best in a customized sushi roll with all our favorite ingredients. \\n\\nThe Food\\nOur party was a mix of sushi and non sushi lovers. My husband ordered the Asian New York filet which he wolfed down pretty handily without  offering to share. I snagged a bite which was tasty and creative, although, to my taste a tad fatty. But, I'm not much of a meat eater, so could be my bias, since he ate every bite.\\n\\nAppetizers\\nWe ordered edamame from our well informed server Julie.

You can order the sandwich with varying intensities of spicy-hot.  I was shocked at how huge the battered chicken filet was on my Blazer.  Wow!   \\n\\nBut on first bite, I was disappointed that the filet had zero flavor, none.  Yes, the filet was moist and tender and the batter had an excellent texture, but there wasn't any flavor!   The sandwich was so gigantic that I could only nibble off a few bites before I was filled up.  The sandwich included coleslaw.  It had some flavor, but there was too little slaw in proportion to the chicken.  The chicken filet definitely needs to have its seasonings ratcheted up.  Still, for $7, the Blazer is a real bargain.\\n\\nThe fritters (hush puppies) were hard and burnt.  Spicy hot, the fritters had bits of  pepper on the inside and were served with a thick dipping sauce on the side.  The dipping sauce was spicy hot too.  In fact, it tasted just like the fritters.

Well, the food is great and I've never had any complaints about service yet!\\n\\n-Breakfast Burrito--one of my favorites fill with egg, mushrooms, avocado, onion and cheese served with a side of salsa.  It is so soft, fresh and smooth when you bite in, spiced with just enough salt and pepper as well.\\n\\n-Frittata- imagine an open-faced omelette topped with bacon, tomato, cheese and scallions.  This is a light dish but will totally fill you up.   A great order if you want something simple, but will hit that breakfast craving.\\n\\n-Morning Monte Cristo- made with fried eggs, Canadian bacon, raspberry jam, cheese and sandwiched in Challah French Toast Bread!  The bread is what make the sandwich unique.  It is so soft and has a hint of cinnamon and egg.  **Note: This is somewhat a messy dish because of the jam and almost runny egg!  \\n\\nI've also had a few bites of others..:\\n\\n-Lemon Ricotta French Toast- so good for a sweet tooth!  Very big serving, so don't be surprised!\\n\\n-Potato Chuckwagon- this dish is good for hangovers!  It is very greasy but tasty.\\n\\n-Smoked Salmon Scramble- this was just average for me.  A little bit too salty I feel and not as exciting of a dish as I anticipated.\\n\\nDon't forget also about their extensive drink menu.  Lots of coffee and tea selections and fresh juices! My favorite is the Viennesse Expresso, served in a Jumbo Cup!  2 or 3 shots of espresso with steamed milk, whip cream and chocolate syrup! Quite a grand drink, but so delicious.\\n\\nThe best part is breakfast is all day and they are open until midnight."},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Part of the reason for the 4 stars is the atmosphere.

I got on yelp to see what everyone said about this location before the driver even arrived so apparently they've made this a practice and it has not been addressed. Once the driver arrived, I tipped him and told him straight up I would not be paying for the pizza, and if his manager has an issue with it the manager can call me himself. Mind you, my driver was on his phone when he arrived and after our exchange he started to speak in his native language on the phone (I have no issue with people speaking their native tongue AT ALL btw but I'm sure it was about me at this point). I don't care, say whatever you want but I've already read about the hassle you guys give people and I will tell the manager the same thing I'm telling you!

It is not that good.  It is not even close to great.  There are so many restaurants in the neighborhood that are as good.

CASH ONLY.\\n\\nSeriously, do yourself a favor and try Assagio, Antico Forno, or Trattoria di Monica's, which have a similar price point, and will take a reservation.  I lived here for 10 years, I know what I am talking about.  I would give them one star because of how much I dislike the place, but I think that is unfair and their food is not horrible, nor a rip-off.\\n\\nIf you must try Giacomos, go to the one in Back Bay.  All comments below apply to that location.  Their food is better, and the line is shorter.  You can make a reservation.  They take checks there. There is more parking and a valet at the BB location too.  It is also more spacious, so you are more comfortable and less rushed.  You can get dessert at this restaurant too.\\n\\nOne note, they do take-out here, so that is probably your best option.  I have gotten take out a few times, when I felt like some decent seafood pasta to eat at home.  Like I said, the food is decent.  It wasn't great.

Both meats were just ok, great smokiness to it but other than that, the flavor of the sausage was nothing to write about and brisket wasn't as moist as I've had elsewhere. The bbq is just not my thing.... tasted like a mixture of bbq sauce and honey mustard. I prefer mine more tangy. Based on the wait time and meat, it's a one star review. However, I LOVED the coleslaw and potato salad. I love that they're more on the tangy side than sweet. I would definitely buy a tub of them but that's kinda sad considering the hype of the meats.

Without further ado, here is my review of their burger, in direct comparison to my benchmark burger at Sel de la Terre:\\n\\nMEAT: a win!  Craigie's patty was both thicker AND juicier than Sel de la Terre's - a most commendable feat.  \\n\\nBUN: a loss.  The bun at Craigie is good...but it's still not the same as the crispy brioche I've come to love at SDLT.\\n\\nTOPPINGS: another loss.  SDLT has some sort of heavenly aioli that pairs so well with ground beef you'd think they were made for each other.  Craigie has a more traditional ketchup-y sauce that is good, but no where close to the aioli-crack that SDLT uses.\\n\\nFRIES: Both restaurants serve shoe-string fries, but Craigie's are what I would describe as dental-floss fries.  They are crispy, plentiful, and spiced with cayenne or something.  SDLT has fantastic rosemary fries that are also plentiful and crispy, but have a higher potato to fried ratio.  Win goes to SDLT.\\n\\nSo...I would say overall, Craigie lost the burger contest.

She made a unique and special concoction for us that I thoroughly enjoyed, even though the jalapenos she added to the drink were, in her own words, weak.  She told the bar manger to get some real jalapenos.  \\n\\nBy the end of our meal I felt like we were best friends with the bartender.  She asked us our names, and then the bar manager came over and talked to us for a while, and he introduced himself to us as well.  He let us sample some liquors, too.

I wait 10 more minutes and then I see some weird car driving in reverse at rather high speeds IN THE WRONG WAY (good thing for him that HUPD wasn't in the area). So I'm like this eccentric must be the driver. 20 seconds later, I get a call (now been waiting for 30+ min outside) barking for me to find him. Good thing I was outside so I said I see him. The driver comes out of the car offensively, screaming offensively about the one way (first time driving in Boston sir?) something completely out of my control. Embarrassed as other people were outside, I quickly explain to him AGAIN how to get on the street. I shake my head, said my thanks, and hoped to enjoy some food.\\n\\nThe horror doesn't stop there, I ordered food and soup and there were no plasticware or napkins (I guess they expect us to eat with hands?). Fed up with dealing with them, I didn't call them and luckily my roommates had leftover wares for me to try their mediocre, now cold food. \\n\\nThis whole thing could have been avoided if they had a driver who had basic english comprehension skills to understand directions, if the driver 'phoned home' to check on the address (like many taxi services do when they are unsure of an address), if they gave the driver a better GPS (clearly he really needs one) or hired a better qualified less incompetent and arrogant driver, and if the restaurant used common sense.

I have been there a few times, and while the first couple bites of each slice is tasty, the amount of crust after that is preposterous. A dude there told me this is how it's done in Italy. Well, with all due respect to the gentleman's Italian accent, I've been to Italy. I ate pizza twice in Florence. Neither time was I served a few nibbles of pizza ensconced in a pillow of bread so soft and warm that I wanted to take it home and sleep on it. Is it yummy crust? Certainly, and those ovens put a nice char on it, but it's crust, and I demand to know the Italian tradition prohibiting a few more toppings and cheese (which, by the way, are top shelf at Antico). Let me note that I realize overloading a pizza with toppings can be calamitous, but that's not what I'm talking about here. I'm talking about a quarter to a third of your pizza making it back to the tray because you... couldn't.... take.... more ..... bread. I say all this emphasizing that they are charging a tidy sum for pizza that, on a busy night, I might have to wedge myself into a corner and eat standing. If this were based on taste alone, I would give it a 4, but the price, crust and refusal to accommodate more than a handful of sitting diners just turns me off, I guess."},{"name":"Bangkok Thai Restaurant","address":"1492 Piedmont Ave NE, Ste A","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Ok, it is very difficult for me to give five stars.

Really? I don't get it. Why the rave reviews? Okay, first the good. It is mighty fun to go into a nice looking gourmet Thai join and pass behind a revolving bookshelf/hidden door to your own secret little restaurant behind. The setting is nice, albeit a bit generic. The Schoolhouse Electric lighting, the rough hewn slab of wood for a counter. It's good, pretty stuff, and it works and maybe that's why it's popular, but it is a bit generic.\\n\\nAlso, the staff was lovely, cheerful and attentive from reservations through the last goodbye. The cooks didn't look miserable. Great care was taken to make each dish pretty and just so. \\n\\nNow the bad. The food. It wasn't that it was bad. It just wasn't worth $60 for a prix fixe menu. We had about 10 courses, and left full, but a bowl full of macaroni and cheese can be filling, too. The first few courses seemed dominated by lime juice, fish sauce, and fist fulls of herbs. There was none of that juxtaposing flavors banging around in our mouths in a surprising way. It was more an experience of shoving the giant fennel branch out of the way to get to the single mussel which was one of the courses we were served. It was a relief to get to the main course- lettuce wraps, sausages, and as we went for the seafood add-on, something with seafood. But then dessert, or maybe it was pre-dessert, added insult to injury. It was a smoked mung bean. And it tasted just like a wet match. The flavor just lingered and lingered in a way none of the other flavors had. The stringy coconut ice cream that followed was received more in a 'good lord, please get this wet match flavor out of my mouth' kind of way than a delightful palate cleanser, leave you feeling clean and fresh kind of way. \\n\\nIt felt like I needed to go to Langbaan, as I am a part of the multitude of Portlanders who bemoan the lack of good, plentiful Asian food in general around here, but the experience at Lang Baan wasn't memorable or delicious enough to merit the $150 we ended up owing after having two $60 meals and two beers each with tip.

To be honest, I could not tell you exactly what my 6 courses were, but I can tell you the fish was all mouth watering, the pork was brilliant, and the desserts were gone very, very quickly.\\n\\nThe servers definitely know their stuff. While your main server might not be the one to drop off each course, whoever does will tell you in full detail what you are about to enjoy. The cocktails are great, the wine selection is above average. The decor and open kitchen is an amazing concept.

They've got a nice location and a somewhat charming ambiance so I was really hoping to find another good restaurant/bar alternative for those nights where I just want to relax with a good beer and decent food.\\n\\nThe food was decent enough for bar food.  Nothing spectacular but I'd say it's better than average for bar food.  On food alone I might have given them 3 stars, but they definitely lost a star on their beer selection.  When I first looked at their menu, I nearly got up and left.  Not a single full-bodied beer.  No stouts, porters, or anything approaching amber.  Not even popular choices like the ubiquitous Bass or Sweetwater.  The only dark-ish beer they have is guiness.  Frankly, I think guiness is a boring beer.  It looks great, has a nice head, but after that there really isn't much flavor.  Anyway, aside from guiness on tap, they've got Miller High Life, Stella, and Paulaner.  That's it.  In bottles it's similarly a bunch of weak-flavored beers such as Amstel light.  I'm sure a lot of people would be happy with the selection, but when I saw the \\"pub\\" sign in the door and when I saw the darkly stained wood interior, I was expecting a nice selection of rich satisfying beers.  No such luck."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"I had been hearing about this place for years so I had really high expectations.  After finally visiting this place on a Saturday I can say that it definitely does not have a family friendly atmosphere.  It's a BYOB place so people are walking around everywhere w/ their ice chests and their 6-packs.  There's also a winery on the property so there's a bunch of people drinking wine.  \\n\\nI visited this place around 4:30pm and there was a 1 hour and 20 minute wait to get a table.  The entire place was a zoo full of people.  \\n\\nAside from that, I can't believe they only accept CASH! I hardly ever carry cash so that was really annoying.\\n\\nAs for the food: The pork ribs were AMAZING.  They were the best part of the entire visit by far.  The brisket was dryer than I usually prefer it.  It wasn't very fatty and juicy.  Turkey needed a little more flavor. Sausage was okay, nothing too special about it.\\n\\nAs for the sides: The potato salad was pretty awesome.  It's a cross between mashed potatoes meets potato salad.  The beans were ok, bread was ok, but the coleslaw was my least favorite coleslaw I've ever eaten.  This coleslaw didn't have a mayo or creamy base, it seemed like it was pickled in vinegar and it had a very bitter flavor.  \\n\\nIn the end, I enjoyed the food, however it did not live up to the hype of Texas's best bbq.

All this time, I've been missing out on that ridiculously inviting roofdeck - SHAME ON ME!\\n\\nI met a group of friends here last night for dinner/drinks/catching up/yukking it up and it was a wonderful choice.  It's a short walk from the Harvard Square T, five minutes or so, but it is on the periphery of where the commercial becomes residential.  we were a group of five and we had a reservation for dining inside.  While making the reservation, we were notified that they do not accept reservations for the roofdeck.  I was the first to arrive in my party.  In checking in with the hostess, I asked about putting our name on the list for the roof deck.  She moved our name over to that list, giving us a very reasonable estimate for wait time.  \\n\\nWe ended up waiting for our table at the upstairs bar, which is a bit of a tease....while sitting there you get to see the other patrons enjoying the outside while you are awaiting your spot to open.  Once seated, we were served by a lovely hostess who was attentive and was able to work with some of our dietary restrictions (no steak on the risotto special, etc).  I ordered the crab cake sandwich and fries.  It was a large-sized crab cake and was quite filling.  A little heavy on the breading for my taste, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  It came with a chipotle aioli and avocado, which I found to be perfect accompaniments.  I drank the pinot grigio, which was ok, but I should have stuck with beer all night.  The draft menu was a bit heavy in terms of skewing towards pale ales, so for those looking for darker beers, it seemed a bit disappointing.  I chalk it up to seasonal rotation, but a more varying array of drafts would have been ideal.  \\n\\nIt was truly an escape from the city, getting to catch up with friends on a pleasant evening, watching the sun go down, and catching views of the towers that pepper Harvard's campus."},{"name":"The Old Mohawk","address":"821 Mohawk St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"great location, beer selection, and menu.

Bear in mind, this is the first contact we'd had with them. \\n\\nShe was arranging the tray and didn't acknowledge him, but the fellow standing on the other side of HER quickly said \\"it's not for YOU\\" then looked at her, hoping she'd share in his chuckling. It was another server. \\n\\nI wasn't sure I'd heard correctly so I asked \\"what?\\" He aggressively yelled \\"WHAT?!\\" back at me, attempting to mock me, tried to stare me down, then walked off, presumably to talk more crap about paying customers. He acted as if he were another patron looking for a brawl rather than an employee of the establishment. In the past, others have just humorlessly asked us to move over, taken an order or roll their tired eyes at us. \\n\\nWe're paying good money for THIS?! Not any more.\\n\\nIF you're a trendy jackass who likes cramped spaces, loud, misguided music, high-fat foods, being abused by staff members, and Ball jars everywhere, you'll probably LOVE The Porter!

On the upside: excellent beer menu (draft & bottle list both) & the wine menu was impressive.  But service was less than attentive & it was very loud in there. Also, a small detail but the cornbread while good was served COLD in a little cast iron pan.

It was underwhelming.  Four of the six courses were all veggie based - no grains were served and the only protein was a small portion of tofu dip.  The last two courses were dessert based.  The veggies were flavorful and presented with interesting flavors.  But it was disappointing there were no grains.  I don't know why vegetarian has been reduced to veggies only.  Also the portions were very small.  I Would have preferred fewer courses that were larger and no more than one dessert course.

The spicy tuna cone was tasty with its sweet spicy sauce and crunchy addtions of something that I could not make out,. but it was the highlight of my meal.

I was expecting a larger portion for the price. The brisket was average. Just ok and not great. I have had plenty better examples elsewhere. The ribs were tough, chewy and lacked flavor. Not baby backs but regular pork ribs and only one on the plate. The sausage was forgettable and I would recommend not ordering it at all Members of my part ordered the pulled pork sandwich. Not bad but also not something I would drive out here to have again. Now their homemade bbq sauce was really good. I'll be honest. I really wanted this place to blow me away.
