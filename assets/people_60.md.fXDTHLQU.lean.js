We were abruptly ushered to the back of a line where approx. 30 long-faced people were standing waiting to get in and also hoping they wouldn't be late for the concert. \\nWe noticed several empty tables both in the restaurant and the bar. There were also empty tables in the back room.

We wanted to leave, but the manager assured us a table wouldn't be long. This put a damper on the entire evening and when we were finally seated 60 minutes later at a tiny table by the entrance, we could not enjoy the meal which incidentally was lukewarm and also took 40 minutes to arrive, making us late for the concert. \\n\\nThe enchiladas were terrible (lukewarm, dry and tasteless), so we ordered something that we thought couldn't go wrong - a Chicken Caesar that turned out to be soggy from too much dressing or sitting too long.

Unfortunately I never made it to Hei La Moon to compare, but I'll vouch for China Pearl for a great, authentic dim sum experience.\\n\\nI have always made a point of arriving around 11 am if I go on a Saturday or Sunday; otherwise, the line for a table can be immense. Each time I've arrived, been promptly seated, and had tea on my table in seconds. The carts circulate regularly, carrying a variety of dim sum staples. In case you've never had dim sum before, it involves many little steamer baskets and plates being circulated on carts; each plate or basket contains 2-4 pieces of items like dumplings, sticky rice wrapped in grape leaves, noodle rolls, or other small items. I would say it's the Chinese version of tapas: you order lots of small plates, and share.\\n\\nBeing able to point to the items you want make it relatively easy, even if you're new to dim sum, to get a variety of delicious dumplings and rolls. I'd recommend the pork buns, shrimp dumplings, and the fun rolls (which are covered in peanut sauce). What I loved about China Pearl was the fact that the staff was able to figure out, from my descriptions of previous dim sum experiences, what items I liked and wanted brought to my table; our waiter even brought over a couple items himself instead of making me wait until the cart came around.\\n\\nThe best part is that you can try a variety of dishes without too big a hit to the wallet. I've always come with a friend, and I don't think the total bill ever topped $25 for a veritable smorgasbord of delicious food. I'd recommend it as a great place for kids with adventurous palates; I started going to dim sum places in Chicago when I was young, and have a soft spot for this type of cuisine thanks to those experiences. Plus, it's fun when you're a kid to point to something on a cart and have instant gratification: no waiting for someone to bring you your order.

I had the lox appetizer with all the traditional toppings but the eggs were shredded/grinded. It was really interesting. I asked Robert if I should get a bagel or croissant to go with it and he said not to worry because it comes with a bagel (I'm not sure why they don't say that on the menu then).

All are hand crafted and use very unique and high-end ingredients.

First up for us was the Braised Short Rib and Chinese Celery Potstickers which were seared with the most perfectly crispy bottom. They had a good amount of short rib and the texture of the wonton was absolute perfection.\\n\\nNext was a menu item I get every single time I eat at Blue Dragon - the Shrimp Shumai. There is a sauce on the bottom of this dish that takes this to the next level. I could eat an entire order of these myself in one sitting!\\n\\nOne of the larger portions we had was the Pad Thai with Scallops and Bacon.

Of course, like most places, it has that 'rustic industrial' feel that seems to be really popular right now, but it works for them because they ACTUALLY have an old farm as their brew space out in Lancaster, so it's a nod to their true origin. \\n\\nThey have their flagship beers that are brewed out on said farm, and a few of the more seasonal/special beers as well. I had their sour, which was really good! I don't care that much for saisons, so even though many have spoken about the high quality of their beer, it doesn't do much for me. What really surprised me was the quality of their food for the price point. I knew from glancing at the menu online that their prices were a little higher (this is the place where you come to get a fancy tasting plate of some kind of seasonal artisan foodstuff) but was a little underwhelmed by the items I tried. We had some of the happy hour items; the quinoa salad, the fried green beans, the chorizo biscuits - all of which were fairly priced for the happy hour discount. Two in our party got the spicy chicken sandwich, which had a brioche bun so buttery that it was actually slimey. This had the affect of making the sandwich way too rich, and for the price of $14+ the price was as well.

The menu is excellent, offering chicken, beef, shrimp, and vegetarian, but a lot of very unique items too (heart skewers anyone?).\\n\\nWe started with the Fried Yuca Appetizer which were nicely fried strips in huanca√≠na, a cold white cheese sauce made with garlic and amarillo, accompanied by a sliced boiled egg and lettuce.  The flavor was very good, though the portion a bit small at 5 or 6 steak fry sized pieces.\\n\\nI had the #13, which is chicken in vinegar and pepper sauce and she had #37, deep fried plantain and egg.  Hers was simple but good, though probably a bit more of a breakfast choice and not exactly what we thought it would be.  Mine was exactly what I expected, again simple, a stewed breast of chicken in halves with wing in a sauce that had a strong vinegar and a medium-spicy chile flavor, accompanied by red onions and sliced yuca and carrots.  The chile flavor was very rich and deep and balanced well with the vinegar, pretty much the flavor you would expect from a traditional Incan stew.  This came with a couple scoops of rice and was rich and hearty.\\n\\nWe had a couple cans of Inca Cola with this, and you should try it.

Last night was our first anniversary, so we decided to celebrate with dinner at Vespaio.\\n\\nWe rolled in around 7PM on a Monday night and were seated after a very brief wait. The main dining room is nice, but not stuffy. The tables are wood and not hidden under white linens. It's all very cozy and not a \\"scene\\" like some of our other high end favorites. (Uchi, I am talking about you.)\\n\\nWe started with their carpaccio, which was incredible. Note to self: Vespaio has carpaccio, Enoteca does not. I love this stuff.\\n\\nMy wife had a caesar salad and a big bowl of ciopino and I had jumbo shrimp, wrapped in prosciutto and grilled. Both were excellent.\\n\\nI have only two minor complaints:\\n(1) Not much depth in the wine list. We wanted a sparkling wine and Vespaio only offers two selections in the \\"under $85\\" price range. We liked the prosecco ($32) that we picked, but more choice would have been nice. In comparison, Enoteca has five sparkling wines under $85, including Veuve Cliquot, which is $14 less expensive at Enoteca than at Vespaio.\\n\\n(2) Not much depth on the dessert list. When I go out for a nice meal I expect to end it with a decadent chocolate dessert. Sadly, there was no chocolate on the dessert menu, except as a component of their s'mores, which isn't what I was hoping for. We had the pumpkin zeppole, which was very good, but it didn't satisfy my chocolate jones. After dinner I was tempted to walk over to Enoteca and buy a chocolate mousse as take-out.\\n\\nService was excellent: helpful and friendly without being intrusive. Our waiter happily poured tastes of the two least expensive sparkling wines before we picked a bottle.\\n\\nSome people have complained about the prices. This seems unreasonable to me. Vespaio clearly uses top notch ingredients which are artfully prepared and served in generous portions. If you don't want to pay the price for Vespaio, go next door to Enoteca.\\n\\nBTW... we had carpaccio, a small caesar, two entrees, a bottle of Prosecco, a dessert and a glass of port. The total before tip was $131, which is perfectly reasonable in my book."},{"name":"Kona Grill","address":"11410 Century Oaks Ter","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"We went on a Sunday all day \\"happy hour.\\" The drink and food choices were very limited. We sat at the sushi bar and oddly were still waited on by a server - btw his personality was that of a drone. As we sat we noticed several VERY disconcerting things. Specifically, potential health risks. First, the ENTIRE time we sat there we watched the sushi chef and he did not close the sushi cooler door one time; therefore, I am certain the raw fish was not at the correct and safe temperature. The doors are meant to be open and closed as needed no matter how busy the restaurant is. Second, the other sushi chef was cleaning his sushi cooler with a wax type cleanser RIGHT in front of the the poor people sitting at the sushi case next to us. Unbelievable! Third, we watched several plates of sushi be made and then set on the pass in the very hot kitchen (albeit not directly under the heat lamps) while waiting for the other hot food items to be ready for the same table order. OMG! Then, when we finally received our sushi (about 30 minutes after we ordered, and remember we were sitting AT the sushi bar) it was handed to us on a hot plate. ha ha ha At that point I was so skeptical that I didn't eat any of it. One person in my party did and shocker...he was not feeling very well the next day. We did make a few \\"comments\\" to our server and even said they weren't complaints -just observations. Then of course a manager came over - at this point I absolutely did not want to bothered, I just wanted out of there. The manager only had excuse after excuse for everything (e.g., the plate was hot because they often run out of plates when busy) without offering any ways that she might change things in the future (e.g., buy some more plates!). All the way over - just BAD. I read some of the positive comments and if the flat bread pizza is what people are talking about from a sushi/Hawaiian restaurant that should say something in-of-itself."},{"name":"Umami Mia Pizzeria","address":"1500 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This relatively new pizza slash Texas-take-on-Italian joint on Barton Springs road opened not too long ago.

That's a red flag to me. Because in Austin you don't even need a seal or license from the Health Bureau anyone can essentially smoke and cure their own meat, it's best to get details.\\n\\nThe pizza was so SALTY I almost had a heart attack. Twice I gave two different slices back. What's wrong with the chef here? First off, salt, doh, is not needed on anything. If you choose to add it be my guest but on your own dollar. The manager came out to inquire what was up. I told him and his response was that they added salt to the pepperoni. Uh yeah right but the pizza was salty. There was too much salt in the dough guys! \\n\\nThat's too bad since it looked and smelled delicious with the right quantities of cheese vs sauce and a very unAustin crispy thin dough.

On that particular night in question, I pulled up Yelp to see what sort of easy food options were around our new place and all of the usual suspects showed up, but Perfect Pizza was new to me. I noticed instantly they had awesome reviews and figured this many Yelp fans couldn't be wrong!\\n\\nSo I called in an order for the BBQ chicken pizza and because my wife loves bread sticks, I got those as well. When I picked up my order the staff was super friendly. The owner, Craig brought my order from the kitchen and opened the boxes for me to see the most beautiful pizza I had ever seen! And the bread sticks... unlike any I had ever seen from a pizza place! They're freaking adorable and delicious looking! You can instantly see this place puts a lot of energy into preparing quality food.\\n\\nI took the pizza home and was even more impressed! The flavor, the texture, the smell...everything was even better than I imagined! :-D V  (To the best of my recollection, that's sorta what I looked like eating my first slice of Perfect Pizza) I don't know how it's possible no other pizza place has figured it out yet with the millions of pizza's made, but wow, it's what pizza should taste like.\\n\\nI have been asked what about the pizza makes it so different, at first I'd say, it's gotta be the crust, but then the toppings are all so fresh as well, so maybe it's the quality of the ingredients or just the care put into the way it's prepared; you can tell it came from a kitchen and not an assembly line. I can't really pin point THE thing that makes the pizza so different but immediately I was hooked. Oh and if you're wondering about the bread sticks... trust me, order 12. Some how they taste even better than they look! And now I love bread sticks as much as my wife.\\n\\nPerfect Pizza is now officially an addiction, I've had my fix just 8 times in the last 10 days.

We enjoyed the Meat pizza which had pepperoni, salami, house-made sausage and red onions. It was delicious, not the best pizza in town (Little Deli still holds that title), but certainly worth coming here for lunch or dinner. We also tried the Here Piggy pizza that had braised bacon, crispy fried carrot, house pickled jalapeno and blue cheese. The combination sounded alarming enough to try; I have to say it was also delicious. Both pizzas were okay reheated, but I recommend eating them when they come fresh out of the oven. \\n\\nI had a nice enough experience during the soft opening that I decided to bring a coworker for lunch. I ordered the Italian salad and she had the Umami Cobb, we both really enjoyed our salad. The salads were overpriced (12.95), but they were tasty enough that I over looked the price this time.

Parking is really easy and they have a pretty cool little patio area.   You can't miss the restaurant, it's painted in all the gaudy yellow, pink and blues that unfortunately everyone thinks people from Mexico paint their restaurants.  Where did this awful tradition begin?  Anyway, what makes El Mercado really a stand out muy grande from the Tex-Mex crowd is their prices.  These guys know how to serve up some pretty decent food at a really good price.  Did I mention their drink specials?   $3.99 Mexican Martini and $2.99 Margs on most weekdays!  Their lunch specials are easy on the wallet too.\\n\\nThe menu is pretty varied and contains most of your typical Tex-Mex standbys ranging from queso to fajitas and enchiladas.

The waitress asked if I wanted to send it back for another burger but instead of probably recieving another overcooked burger, I just asked for her to put it in a to go box. By the time my second burger came out, my fiance was already done with his food. It took around 10/15 minutes to get it. We then decide to try the chocolate creme brulee. What a let down.

And the fries were crisply al dente outside and soft and flavorful inside, unlike the very disappointing stubby mushy fries I got at Hopdoddy's.\\n\\nIn lieu of the $6 milkshake I had at Hopdoddy's, (which I did enjoy quite a lot), I ordered two more beers and watched the ballgame on a high-def screen practically in my face.\\n\\nThe bill for burger, fries, three beers, with tax and tip, was still less than I paid at Hopdoddy's for one beer, a burger, fries and a shake. And it was a better burger and better fries.\\n\\nToo soon to give up on Hopdoddy's, which does offer interesting beers and those yummy shakes, and for some folks perhaps it's just what they're looking for in an upscale burger joint.

But of course, it's priced like a hotel. Beware.\\n\\nRooms: \\nI am so furious to come to Yelp and see how absolutely deceptive the photos of this place are. It is genuinely dirty looking on the inside. \\n\\nI had to fix my own toilet, which looked like the tank had not been cleaned in over a year. The bed was so hard, I have a welt on my lower back from a spring. The comforter had that plastic sheen / feel that makes it feel like a motel bed (cheap, and easy to clean.) Not comfortable or heat retaining.\\n\\nMultiple people there for the wedding were without hot water, had broken outlets, and phones. We were all having to trade spaces within a very short amount of time to do basic things like shower.\\n\\nFood: \\nI ordered a cheese burger in the restaurant. It came out after 40 minutes with just a slice of cold cheese on top. It was severely over done. The condiments at the table had clearly not been refilled or checked in quite some time, as about 4 of them were low on contents and we all kept having to trade off.\\n\\nEvery time I went down to the cafe, there was no one manning any station whatsoever. I got my coffee at the Starbucks in the Ralphs across the street instead.\\n\\nService: I had one good interaction all weekend, and I'm furious with myself that he was the only individual who's name I did not catch. He was an older gentleman with an olive green vest and blonde hair. He deserves a metal for trying to accommodate myself and the Bride, day of the wedding.\\n\\nOther than that, my experience was luke-warm, which is not something you want to hear about your wedding hotel.\\n\\nI came down with a fourteen point list of complaints after only 12 hours of checking in, explaining that the Bride's suite alone had so many issues that we were having problems getting her ready to get married in about 5 hours. Olive-vested gentleman was a prince, but the next two associates I talked to were fine, but their attempts at being accommodating were not practical. They seemed like ways of trying to placate without actually having to do any work themselves.\\n\\nMy number one question was \\"How can we make this work?\\" Their answer was for the Bride and her entire entourage to pick up and move to a different suite in the middle of getting hair and makeup done. We would have also had to move all of the Bride and groom's things. There was no way we could have done this, finished hair and makeup, AND gotten everyone to the venue on time. Not to mention, as I said to the people they directed me to INSTEAD of a General Manager, there was no guarantee that everything in that room would work either. \\n\\nAccommodation: \\nThere were multiple members of the wedding party who needed access to elevators due to health reasons. There was only one working one the entire weekend, and it kept breaking as well. There were other events going on that same weekend, so everyone was using it and everyone was furious.\\n\\nThere was also a claim of \\"free wi-fi\\" but it never connected. We had two people standing next to each other trying to send a simple e-mail and it would not send. This felt like a flat out manipulation to make you pay $10 extra dollars for \\"better bandwidth.\\"\\n\\n\\nI could literally still go on, but I think the point has been made.

The place is not very big but it's new and clean. Looking at the menu, they seem to specialized in sizzling plate as well as the hot pot style soup. We opted for the signature soup dish.  You choose what type of soup you want, side dish (sausage or shrimp) and cheese, corn or half half.  We got the large oden soup as there were 7 of us. We also ordered the special popcorn chicken, seafood pancake and bibimbap.\\n\\nAs usual with Korean restos, they give ban Chan. In this case, the ban chan consisted of bean sprouts, Kimchi and potatoes.  The popcorn chicken was first to arrive. It was well coated in gochujang. At first, we all felt that this was very spicy. But as we got to eat it with rice, the spiciness became tolerable. Chicken pieces got a nice crunch to it.  The seafood pancake was thick and came with lots of seafood. It was crispy and we all enjoyed this. The bibimbap was the usual but also good.\\n\\nFinally the star of the meal was the soup. It came in this container where the soup and fish cakes we're in the middle. Then another section was the chili shrimp, cheese and corn. The server will turn on the burner. We were too busy taking food pics that the soup boiled and overflowed to the outer layer where the cheese was.  Oh well it's still good.  Probably will be better if the cheese and shrimp we're not flooded with soup.\\n\\nOverall, a really great meal and will definitely come back again. We will try the sizzling plate next time. Service was friendly and efficient. The only negative thing is the atrocious parking in this area."},{"name":"Lee's Bakery","address":"4005 Buford Hwy NE, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The food is great but the reviews are honest.\\nWent last night, walked in at 725 pm and they close at 800pm.\\nSat down...waitress came over and said that they are closed..stunned ...she then said they ran out of food.\\nFor a restaurant that's been around this long ... unacceptable.\\nHead over to pho dai loi for some better service and comparable pho.

The waitress sold us on the fact that everyone \\"comes for the barbecue but comes back for the steaks...\\" so we both went with the grill...\\n\\nHer pork chop could not be cooked to order - and came medium-well to well done throughout.  Great flavor but disappointing for a $26 chop.\\n\\nMy ribeye, which I ordered medium rare, came medium well.  To their credit, I simply showed it to the waitress and they immediately took it and replaced it 5 minutes later with a perfectly cooked steak.  That said - the brown sugar glaze was far too prominent, and overpowered what would have been a beautifully prepared steak on the 2nd go.\\n\\nThe waffle fries were spectacular - some of the best we've had, and my girlfriend loved the broccoli though she couldn't really detect the advertised jalapenos with it.  We were really excited to try the mac and cheese - and could not disagree more with the other reviews.

You could taste exactly what flavor you were having and the cannoli's are huge! My only complaint is that you can taste how extremely fried the cannoli shell is. Yes, I know they are fried, but it had such a fried taste to it that it kind of took away from the filling. Other then that, I have no complaints.

Overall, we enjoyed it and we may return, although they could use some strengthening on their vegan options.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was airier than I expected - for some reason I was thinking it would be more east-side dive, but it was polished instead. Quite loud, as other reviewers have mentioned. Vegan selection on the menu included two appetizers and 5 vegetable sides.\\n\\nWe started with the cucumber salad. It was spiralized cukes in a very spicy sauce. Definitely tasty. For mains, we had the Kung Pao Cauliflower and the Dry Fried Green Beans. We also requested a side of tofu. Actually, we requested they add tofu to one of our veggie dishes, but they brought it as a side. \\n\\nThe cauliflower was sincerely spicy. I have a pretty high spice tolerance, and this was not beyond what I could enjoy, but it was right up there on the edge. The green beans were deeply flavorful and perfectly cooked. The tofu was lightly breaded with panko and otherwise completely plain. It was good dredged in the other two sauces. \\n\\nService was so-so. Rice did not come with anything, and the waiter didn't mention this, so we had to ask for it later and it came after our food. The cucumber salad made a mess of our plates and we had to ask for fresh plates. We had a long wait for more tea. \\n\\nSpeaking of tea, it comes in a ridiculously small pot with a thimble-sized cup to drink from. They say that the pot can be refilled 4 times. That might add up to two regular sized cups of tea, but with a long wait in between. I prefer a cup I can wrap my hands around. \\n\\nServing sizes on the veggie dishes were small. Next time, I'd order 3 veg dishes and 2 tofu sides. I'd really prefer there to be a vegan main dish rather than just vegetable sides. But what we did have was delicious and overall I would recommend it if you are looking for Chinese-ish food in an upscale environment."},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I'm going to say upfront, I wasn't expecting an expensive dinner with small portions.  I didn't even know that was possible with BBQ.  I didn't select Lamberts, a friend did, and I didn't have a chance to check Yelp for price, menu recommendations, etc... I went in completely blind Goose!!!  If you want quantity/quality combo type BBQ, this is not the place.\\n\\nUpon arrival on a Thursday night, three adults and one 8 year old had to wait about 20 minutes for a seat outside (covered).  Kind of cool since it was raining and the clear bubble around us made it a surreal experience.  \\n\\nOur waiter came over and asked if we wanted to start with a drink.... about half of the beers on tap weren't available, what the heck??  Felt very strange considering the \\"caliber\\" you feel this restaurant is.  Finally settled for a 512 IPA.  \\n\\nThe jalapeno muffins came out next...yummy, but not amazing.  We then ordered our \\"entrees\\" and I solicited advice from the server, but he really couldn't articulate quantities that we should expect on the plate... and for a $17 brisket plate, I wanted to know!  Unfortunately, our friend with the 8 year was misled and one brisket plate wasn't nearly enough for them to share.\\n\\nThe flavor of the brisket was good, but the \\"burnt ends\\" were like fat ends.... very disappointing considering this was a $17 plate of brisket.  The ribs are again good in flavor, but were huge, so be ready for that. \\n\\nThe mac and cheese is RICH!  Almost too much so for my taste, and the one side is plenty to share with two or three folks...just so rich it is almost shocking.  The coleslaw was good, and more of an asian style... definitely no mayo in it. \\n\\nI think it is probable that our level of service was decreased because we were with child.  This sucks...I'm not a parent yet, and maybe I can't have kids because places like Lamberts won't treat you like a human?

The drink was strong and was the perfect choice for sipping slowly. I then went with the Gyoza as my appetizer. They were really good. The pork was seasoned nicely and they came out hot. What else could I ask for? Lastly, I ordered the Tonkotsu, which was perfect on a cold and rainy night. The ramen was oh so good! The broth was excellent. Not too thick, not too thin. The broth was rich and had such a depth of flavor. The pork was AH-MAY-ZING! Fresh and bold flavors that I went home and dreamt about.  It was crispy and so flavorful.  Best pork in a Ramen I have had since my ramen addiction began last year. I had no shame in picking up the bowl and slurping up the bottom of the bowl. I only wish the bowl would have been bigger.

We were on business and all professionals in the food and beverage industry.  There were 3 Executive Chefs and 3 F&B Directors going out for our last meal, which we THOUGHT was going to be good, but the service was deplorable.  Food was old and not cooked well.  \\n\\nIt was a very slow night.  Only 1 deuce was dining when we arrived at 8:30pm on Wednesday, Sept. 15.  I should have taken this as a hint to walk right out, but we did not and decided to give the restaurant a shot.\\n\\nThe servers uniforms and white gloves are things of the past and hideous looking.  For goodness sake, this is 2010, you need to revamp your style.  The restaurant's decor is also something out of the late 70's, early 80's.  A lot or brass and mirror.  \\n\\nThe nicest element of the restaurant was the view.  That was it.  As I said, there was only 1 other table when we arrived, so we were the only table being serviced.  We were a party of 6.  \\n\\nHere we go....  the bread was old and hard.  The bread was served cold.  Okay, so I can live with that, but hard?  C'mon.  The Peroshki's came next....  not bad.  Then the appetizers... my snails were not bad, but everyone else's was not good, except for some cheese that one of our F&B director's had.  The entrees arrived and they serve it with silver domes covering the food.  Impressive, but they switched 2 of the entrees.  The unfortunate part was, the guests did not realized they switched the plates and ate 1/2 of it, before they realized, they had each other's food.  Urgh!  \\n\\nThe lamb entrees were all over done.  The tuna was over cooked.  There was no call back from the servers to ask us, how our dinners were, so we could not even tell them they made an error. Then the souffles were raw in the middle and the creme brulee was old.  Not to mention they sprinkled powder sugar on the top of the brulee,  obviously to hide something.   \\n\\nWe had to ask for coffee and one of our guests asked for chamomile tea.  The server acknowledged him and proceeded to bring the hot water and a large box of tea over.  To his surprise, there was NO chamomile tea in the box.  When he asked for the chamomile tea, they server said, NO, we don't have any.  THEN WHY DID YOU BRING THE BOX OVER?  He would have ordered something else, if you did not have the tea he wanted!\\n\\nTrust me, we are not one's to complain.  We are all in the industry and hate people who complain.  In fact, we dispise people who complain.\\n\\nBut when we asked for the check.  The check had a auto-gratuity of 20% added on.  The server did not even advise us the gratuity was on there.  Not to mention, the service was NO WAY 20% service.  You have got to be kidding me.  \\n\\nWe were STILL NOT going to complain about this, although we were not happy with it.  Let the poor servers make a living, we thought.  \\n\\nThen we asked for the check to be split 6 ways and one of our chefs got a check for double the amount, because the server Stan advised he could not split the gratuity out.

Or rather, the faux secret bar, since apparently Central decided to put up a sign finally (I assume they were losing too much business to people who walked into Valentines thinking it was Central and stayed because the prices and atmosphere were better). Central is a tiny, crowded, fake industrial space that all your coworkers will want to try and your friends from smaller towns will be impressed by. It's so exclusive, they don't even have a working phone number, so hopefully they are open when you want to stop by.\\n\\nI went to Central a couple times with work friends and was underwhelmed by the expensive drink menu (every other cocktail has egg white in it, FYI) that is undercut by a completely mediocre beer selection (a tasteless Pilsner, Magner's cider in a bottle, and a couple others that I don't even remember, they were so boring). They also apparently just got the memo that absinthe is legal, since it's in almost everything. The food menu is virtually all small plates, and I'm not sure why they bother printing it since it seems to change so frequently they often don't have half of what's on it, and there are a number of items not written down. I was also disheartened to find that they serve foie gras, everybody's favorite food that results from blatant animal torture. \\n\\nCentral certainly has an interesting menu. The eggplant bruscetta was actually pretty good, but the waitress said it didn't have butter on it (one in our party is allergic to dairy) and it definitely did. The food is even more exorbitantly priced than the drinks. It's creative in that it's more creative than the other bars on this particular street, but not that exciting if you are a true foodie. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was pretty much what you'd expect: super loud (even on off nights), crowded, really uncomfortable metal stools to sit on (not even a chair back to put your coat on, which is extra fun when the waitress spills beer on the floor right next to you and your jacket sleeve is dangling in it). The music was surprisingly good and pretty unpretentious (Magnetic Fields and a few other albums in that neighborhood were on repeat). The wait staff was pretty friendly but they definitely needed another waitress as ours didn't ask for food orders at first and then took ages to wander back to our table. \\n\\nOverall, Central is just ok and visiting family might think it's cool, but it could be much better with a better menu, better drink variety, some decent beers, and better wait staff. Valentine's next door has much better drinks and really friendly bar staff. If you're the type to be impressed by \\"secret\\" bars and politically incorrect meats, you'll love Central."},{"name":"Kick Butt Coffee","address":"5775 Airport Blvd, Ste 725","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I drink tea lattes and no one in Austin has them.

I've had some wonderful sushi in Vancouver so my hopes were high. \\n\\nThe all you can eat / 21.95 option isn't good if you want sushi and sashimi - your choices are limited to only the most mainstream sashimi options (tuna, salmon, and one other item), the rolls come one piece to an order thus you aren't guaranteed to get fresh rolls, and the nigiri is also limited to the most mainstream choices. This is fine if you are with a group who wants a bit of sushi and to enjoy some barbeque - unfortunately I was with someone who will eat whatever is put in front of him but who also doesn't like to eat too much...sigh.\\n\\nAnyway once I figured out the lay of the sushi land I decided to order A La Carte.\\n\\nI started with the Gomae spinach/sesame salad. It was a very large portion of lightly dressed baby spinach presented in a pretty dish. I was impressed at the size and quality of this salad.\\n\\nThe miso was a light white miso which was also very good and not too salty.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the salmon teryaki dinner which was also an impressively presented and tasty dish. It came on a sizzling platter and the generous serving of fish was atop a pile of gently braised cabbage in a tasty sauce.\\n\\nI was primarily interested in sushi since I've always had especially good - and reasonably priced - sushi experiences in Vancouver and Victoria.\\n\\nHamachi nigiri (Always test the nigiri first!). On the menu they acknowledged the hamachi is imported. Two huge pieces of nigiri, the fish didn't have much of the nutty buttery flavor I love in hamachi, and it wasn't very firm. I can't say it wasn't fresh, but it wasn't the freshest.\\n\\nI decided to proceed with ordering more sushi and had:\\n\\n2 pc Amaebi - not available on the all you can eat menu, this was a disappointment. They don't include the fried heads with the shrimp, and the shrimp itself was not as fresh as Amaebi should be. The texture of the shrimp did not have that sweet pop very recently-live Amaebi should have - the shrimp was still fairly sweet but they were pretty small and mealy or fibrous. \\n\\nBC Roll - a HUGE salmon skin roll with tobiko and cucumber. This was a fun, good roll. I love salmon skin.\\n\\nI'd return to Shabuse Yakiniku again, but never exclusively for sushi. The main thing is, this restaurant specializes in pigouts, not sushi. The chefs there spend most of their time slicing salmon and tuna sashimi and making a few classic nigiri bites and rolls. They are very generous with their portions and the place runs like clockwork.

The food if very Country(I am saying that in a Reba voice lol) .. and everything is either fried, has bacon or both. They do have tex mex Mexican food, but nothing in me said \\"I want to try their Enchiladas\\" .. that's like expecting a awesome cheeseburger at a Taqueria lol \\nI had grilled chicken with baked potato, and salad. My husband had the tangy wing sauce chicken burger (has a different name).. that thing was mammoth.. We cut it in half just to have it fit on the bun. He said the sauce overpowered everything on the sandwhich and all you could taste was the sauce. We ended up throwing away the other half of the chicken as we just (more like my husband couldn't) bring himself to be fatty twice in a row. \\n\\nThe place I heard was really nice when they have live music playing during the summer outside.

While I'm not much of a foodie, I do know what I like and feel like my palate has a degree of refinement, well, maybe.  I know that my description of the bacon/cheddar/scallion covered latkes is a good descriptor for Zaftig's as a whole: deliciously unkosher.  Most recently, I enjoyed a roast beef sandwich that had latkes instead of bread, which I had to try for philosophical, somewhat hedonistic reasons more than ever having had a craving for something like this.  I requested a double serving of horseradish, beyond the single that usually comes with this sandwich, as I needed my sinuses cleared up a bit.  I also got those same latkes I mentioned earlier as a side and a salad that appeared to have had effort put into it's aesthetic appearance rather than just being tossed in a bowl.  I especially appreciate the applesauce that is made in the restaurant that came with the latkes, which I made sure to clean off the plate.  The servers have a tinge of the New York Jewish attitude, mixed with that Boston flavor, while remaining helpful and, as one of their shirt's mentioned, \\"almost kosher\\".  Also a good place to get a tshirt for mothers' day, whether it's that one or \\"red lox\\" or many of the other ones.  Everything from the bagel chips and cream cheese to the art on the wall always puts a smile on my face at this restaurant.  The only problem I find myself dealing with is wanting to order the same thing I got last time but also wanting to experience more and more of the menu.  Zaftig's reminds me of the Yiddish expression, a person can forget everything but eating.  I love this place and can't sing its praises enough.

I love trying food from different cultures, and the chefs at Little Donkey did a fantastic job blending all kinds of flavours. They took the best aspects of cuisines from all over the world and created some of the most unique and delicious fusion dishes that I've ever had. \\n\\nIn my opinion, there are few things better than enjoying an authentic dish at a restaurant that provides me with a cultural experience that is completely different than my own. However, Little Donkey's perfect blend of global flavours made me reconsider everything I love about authentic food. For example, I've been to some really good ramen places in both Boston and Asia, but NOTHING compared to Little Donkey's Matzo Ball Ramen. The broth was teeming with flavour and there were all kinds of new ingredients that added great texture to the dish. My boyfriend and I split the half-sized bowl (which is much larger than it sounds) and enjoyed it so much that we found ourselves in a race to consume the most amount of ramen; sharing the bowl, instead of ordering our own, became our biggest regret of the meal.\\n\\nUnlike most (if not all) restaurants that specialize in tapas and small plates, you don't need to order a million plates to fill yourself up. Most of the plates were priced at $7-$12, so I assumed they would be nibble-sized portions, but it was quite the opposite! Ordering 4 plates to share between 2 people is more than enough - especially if you're ordering one of the sandwiches or the ramen. My boyfriend and I ordered the Shrimp Toast, half-sized Matzo Ball Ramen, Delicata Squash Pakora, Spiced Carrots and Pickle Brine Fried Chicken Sandwich, and we were so full by the end of the meal, that we could barely bike home. But that didn't stop us from ordering two plates of dessert - the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough and the Chocolate Creameux. Which was my favourite dish?

I think the food here is great and the pizza is unlike any you can get anywhere else in Ohio. This is one of my favorites!\\n\\nThe only thing that bothers me about Uno is that there's only one in the city and that it's all the way up by Tuttle. Since it's so far away on the side of town where I rarely go, I hardly ever get the chance to go here. The food is great and they have one of the best desserts I've ever had here. At least the location is easy to find - if you're taking 270 you get off at the Tuttle Mall exit and turn the direction opposite of the mall. You'll see it - it's very close. It's a little confusing getting into the parking lot. At least it was last time we were here because there was construction.\\n\\nLast time we were here the service was so great. Our server was really cheery, chatty and prompt and the manager even came by to make sure we were happy. From the looks of this place, you'd assume it's just like Applebee's or restaurant of that kind. There's nothing really special about the way it looks. It's nice, but it kind of looks like everywhere else. And while some of the food options would lead you to believe that as well, I think this place is a lot better and has more creative options. They have salads, burgers, sandwiches, pastas, and of course, their pizzas. They have flatbread pizzas but their claim to fame is the Chicago style pizza.\\n\\nNow I know Chicago (I was born there) and I know Chicago style pizza. And this comes pretty close. Chicago pizzas are made with a really deep crust - the crust is almost like a bowl because the edges come up like one. And the crust is flaky almost like a croissant. The pizza is cooked with the toppings and cheese, but then the tomato sauce is poured on top of the toppings, which is where the bowl-like crust comes in handy. The tomato sauce is very sweet and contains big chunks of tomatoes. It's like a partially upside-down pizza.\\n\\nUno has a very similar crust, but doesn't really do the sauce on top thing. But their sauce is sweet and chunky. I absolutely love their crust. It's very rich and thick and buttery. Their pizza is so filling because it's so loaded with toppings and that crust isn't like normal pizza crust. You have to have an open mind here. Yes, the crust will be different than what you're used to, but that's because you're used to eating Ohio pizza. Chicago is famous for their pizza for a reason. It's delicious. The personal pizzas are cut into 6 slices. I can only eat 2 or 3 at a time. You can also order a regular sized pizza which will feed several people. But they have some pretty unique topping combinations or you can choose your own. I tend to make my own. But I also like their Spinoccoli: Broccoli, spinach with feta cheese on top. The Chicken & Portobello has, naturally, chicken and mushrooms with garlic and it's quite tasty. I've also have their pepperoni pizza and that's great, too. I also don't think the prices are too bad on the pizza. It's about $10 for one pizza, but I can get two meals out of it. My boyfriend can eat his entire pizza, but then he's stuffed. I like their pizza so much because it's pizza yet it's still something different, so I've actually never tried any other dish here aside from just trying different pizza toppings. I can't help it!\\n\\nAnd Uno's has one of the best desserts ever. It's called the Uno Deep Dish Sundae. They take one of their personal deep dish pizza pans and bake a big chocolate chip cookie in it. The result is a thick cookie that's crisp around the edges and on the top, but it's all warm and gooey in the middle. Then they top it with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream and drizzle it with chocolate sauce. The ice cream starts to melt over the hot cookie and it gets all messy but I don't care. Oh my gosh it is heaven in your mouth. The cookie is exquisite! I can't come here and not order this dessert. And since the cookie is so big and thick, it's perfect to share with someone. I definitely couldn't eat a whole thing myself. And it's only $5, so that's not bad. If cookies aren't your thing, they have a dessert that's exactly the same, but with a brownie instead. And if a cookie is really your thing, they'll make a huge one in their regular sized pizza pan. I've never gotten that greedy, but it's tempting. Even if you aren't impressed with the pizzas, this dessert is worth checking out. I'll be honest, whenever I get a craving to come here, it's all about the cookie. The pizza is a plus, but I really just can't wait for dessert! If I can give you any advice about this place, it's to order this dessert. I think that if you come here and don't try it, you're missing out.\\n\\nI know I'll come back to get my cookie fix. Maybe next time I'll be a little more adventurous and try something other than the pizza. It certainly all looks very good, I just tend to stick to what I like.

I think I would have rather had one of those than a 5th floor, which had more space in the room, but no balcony.  Keep that in mind, I'm guessing mountain facing 4th floor is the way to go...as far as price, you can ninja chop a great price and probably get that hotel if they have rooms to fill.\\n\\nThis hotel is nestled right into a lot of action (maybe not Pearl street action, but...), you really could get to some great eateries, including Zolo, another restaurant I will be reviewing shortly, the movie theatre, a grocery store, and the local bike trails literally ride right up to the outdoor pool area.\\n\\nBefore I forget, some other insights into the hotel- the indoor pool is a  lane pool, not very ideal for kids in the winter, but a great work out year round for adults.  They have a wall of really nice artwork between the lobby and the South wing on the first floor, check it out.  The prices are really reasonable for framed artwork, even if they are mass produced, some of them I never have seen before.\\n\\n\\nI really want to go back and try a 4th floor balcony facing mountains in warmer weather, I'd say that kind of room is worth a higher price than I paid."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Best cannolis anywhere!

That all changed this afternoon when I brunched with a couple of Portland's elite homosexuals in what ended up being a delightful ladies' Sunday brunch. \\n\\nAt least now I understand why people rave about this place. The ambiance is perfect, the service is quite good, and the food is tasty. The staff is really attentive and they totally take care of you (read: the waitress puts in your mimosa refill order before asking you) (that is, they don't force you to be drunk--I contend the wait staff keenly discerns your wants, needs, and desires). The ambiance and service remain unparalleled; in terms of those two aspects, Mother's is the standard by which others should be measured.\\n\\nThat said, I do feel like Portland boasts a plethora of excellent brunch spots. The Daily Cafe, for example, offers excellent food and half the wait Mother's does. Mother's, however, offers a more diverse menu and service that really can't be beat. Next time, I want to sample the lunch and dinner options. I mean--in my experience, it's pretty tough to fuck up a specialty omelet or eggs benedict. Their eggs benedict was pretty good--it's clear (or it seemed) they made their hollandaise sauce from scratch, and my eggs were prepared perfectly. We enjoyed a tasty biscuits and gravy appetizer, which was stellar. My companions consumed the traditional frittata and specialty omelet, respectively, and they both loved their food. I wish I had been a little more daring when ordering--eggs benedict, as I said, is tough to fuck up, and mine was fine. At the end? I couldn't tell if our plates still had food on them because we were full or we were trying to out-lady each other. I do, typically, clear my plate. Telling? I'm not sure yet.\\n\\nThe wonderful thing about Mother's? You know there will be a next time, so try, try again. And the grapefruit mimosa?

I do wish we sat on the left side since it seemed a lot brighter and had better views of the street, however it also had a lot more people so the bar area was quiet and pleasant.

Breakfast cocktails looked fantastic but since we were traveling, we sadly passed. The Belgian waffle with whipped cream and the buttermilk pancakes were seriously some of the best I've ever had.

Chang's. You'll find way better flavors and more authenticity for the same general price range. I first came to Old Thousand as a guest to their Chinese New Year meal (I got a complimentary meal because I am a food blogger) and even my seafood-hating husband gobbled up the five course meal despite it being heavy on the seafood. I'd been meaning to return, so one night my husband and I made our way to East 11th to order from their regular menu, using our own wallet.\\n\\nWe were blown away. I loved every bite of our meal and I've been thinking about it ever since. We each had a drink--I got an Old Fashioned, he got a beer--and got the scallion pancakes as an appetizer. They were deliciously crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and came with a tasty and tangy sauce.\\n\\nWe shared two main courses as well, the Orange Chicken and the Pineapple Beef. Both were incredible! The Orange Chicken is NOT your standard food-court fare, it's delicate and flavorful and pairs perfectly with the jasmine rice. And the beef... oh goodness this is one of my favorite dishes of all time. The beef is crispy but not tough, the sauce is amazing, the pineapple adds a hint of sweetness but there's some spice going on in there too. \\n\\nWe did have an issue with our check... the server accidentally served our bill to the table next to ours, and vice versa, and the other table left and paid our tab. The server assured us that our bill was actually cheaper by a few bucks, but we found it pretty weird.

Gluttonous, delicious, and undoubtedly a new favorite of mine from that day forward. With a side of fruit, it was all I needed for brunch.\\n\\nThey also bring you delicious bagel chips and spread that are a wonderful thing to munch on while waiting for your meal, and the service is prompt, friendly, and attentive.\\n\\nBeware that the wait can be long on a Saturday or Sunday, though; if it's nice outside, it's a beautiful neighborhood, but I would proceed with caution on a day of inclement weather --- the waiting area can get crowded."},{"name":"Shabusen Yakiniku House","address":"755 Burrard Street, Suite 202","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Excellent BBQ!

I guess I was scared of reviews I read about long waits on the weekend. My parents were in town for some Christmas shopping so we decided to give it a try. Lots of people waiting when we arrived but the 30 minute wait was not bad and they text you when the table is ready so it allowed time to get our name on the list and then go find a place to park.\\n\\nExamining the menu while we waited it was clear that we had a dilemma, too many great choices and being able to eat just one. When we got seated in the bar we tried to spy the plates of the other patrons looking for the best. This did not help either as everything looked great. I had thought I was going to have the famous French Toast but one of the specials kept calling to me. Egg Nog pancakes sounded like they could be great. I posed my quandary to the waitress who was very nice and said \\"why don't I just split your order and give you half and half.\\" Problem solved. The solution was so good my parents both took the same deal, eve though I am sure she was doing it just for me :) We topped it off with their famous Bloody  Mary's. \\n\\nAfter a very reasonable wait the food arrived and was awesome.

The portion size for the pad thai is about half of what you would receive at a thai restaurant. We also found a piece of plastic in our pad thai.....that was quite strange. My biggest complaint however is the chicken curry. The chicken curry here is a disgrace to all chicken curries. For $12 you get 3 small spoonfulls of rice, 4 small strips of chicken on top of a salad. The worst excuse of a chicken curry I have ever seen. It should not even be called chicken curry.

I have enough Marriott points to own one at this point so we decide to stay as close to the park and downtown area as we can. This review is not only for the hotel itself but for the Marriott corporation as a whole. When my wife made the reservations, she was assured that our points were going to be used against the room and that it would cost us nothing. When I called he day before to try and upgrade the room, I was then told that our points were not being used and that our room was $385.00 per night. I explained to the very nice (no sarcasm) customer service rep that she was mistaken and that we were supposed to get the room using our Marriott points. The woman informed me that all the Marriott points rooms were already booked for that weekend so we would have to pay out of pocket. I asked for her supervisor and was immediately transferred to an even nicer woman who contacted the actual hotel and made sure that our room was reserved using our points and that we got the upgraded room as well. Talk about going the extra mile for a customer! Rarely have I been treated so kindly and with that much respect (regardless of how many points I have). Because of this, I asked to speak to the supervisor's supervisor. Again, I was immediately put through to her manager (albeit voicemail), where I left a glowing recommendation for both the rep and her supervisor as well as how impressed I was with my overall experience. \\n\\nThe hotel itself is a typical Marriott. Clean room. clean bathroom, newer TV. A bit small by comparison to other Marriott's I have stayed at and for Christ's sake...how about a coffee pot with more than 2 sugars and 2 creamers? Thankfully, this particular Marriott was situated across the street from a Dunkin' Donuts so I could \\"two cahfee regulahs\\" every morning. A huge bright spot was the indoor pool on the 6th floor. Small, but well kept and very clean. It gave my daughter something to do for a few hours Sunday morning. \\n\\nWhile this is nothing against the hotel, there was an anime convention the weekend we stayed and the FREAKS and GEEKS that littered every corner of the hotel were a nuisance and for the most part very rude and inconsiderate of the other guests. They shoved their way onto the elevators and gave you the evil eye when you stared.

Now let me just preface with the fact that I have had more cannolis in my lifetime than I could ever estimate.  My dad is an Italian and he's always bringing home goodies from Italian bakeries.  My first reason for the 3 stars is because I've had better cannolis from an italian bakery in Michigan.  Just your traditional ricotta cannoli.  Also, there was so much filling in this cannoli that it kind of took away from the crunchy pastry shell for me.  Several of my bites were just all filling.

I'm a big foodie and usually leave positive reviews on my instagram account. But I couldn't for this one. \\n\\nI went there for lunch just a few days ago with my loved one on a weekday. I saw many great reviews about their food and service on Yelp and Instagram, and have long been wanting to try their famous cassoulet and brunch menu. And those were what we chose to have. \\n\\nEverything was great until I found a very visible fly wing in my salad after eating more than half of it. When I notified the server about it, the chef came out shortly after apologizing and asking us if we wanted to try their pastry or have our salad replaced. By that time, we were close to finishing our meal and were too full to try anything else. Also, finding a fly in our food totally destroyed our appetite so we didn't think we would want to eat their food any more. I felt disgusted (although I didn't scream or yell out \\"EW!!\\", because I wanted to act in a civil way and not ruin their business), and very uncomfortable thinking about the fact that I could've eaten some parts of the fly. We don't dine out very often and our date was ruined. Since on Instagram, I've seen someone saying that he was able to eat their meal for free after finding a hair in their food, I was expecting the same treatment for us. Then we realized at the end that all we got was a $5 discount on our bill. \\n\\nFirst of all, I was very surprised that they just calculated the cost of a salad and thought deducting the bill by that amount would fix the damage that they've done to our meal and entire day. I could have already eaten the parts of the fly (I first thought some of the black stuff were some pepper but realized I didn't put any on my salad.) Would THEY be willing to eat a salad with a fly in it for $5? If we had accepted to take some of their pastries, they would probably have charged us the full bill. It really shows how they don't consider or handle these issues seriously.

We were just warned that it gets really crowded, especially on the weekends.  \\n\\nMother's is located in the heart of downtown Portland and it was easily accessible from our hotel.

To avoid the weekend \\"breakfast/brunch\\" crowds we went on a weekday around 7 am.\\n\\nThere was no wait and we were seated right away.  The dining room was bright & sunny with big picture windows, ornate golden trimmed mirrors, chandeliers, wooden tables & chairs on a wooden floor with big distressed hutches dividing the spaces.  Elegant, but cozy!  \\n\\nOn the other side of the restaurant was \\"The Velvet Lounge\\".  Red brick wall on one side filled with gold trimmed mirrors of all sizes and the other wall with black and gold wallpaper.  More chandeliers, comfy looking banquettes and dark furniture.  Looked like a perfect spot for happy hours and late night drinks/dinner.  Maybe next time!\\n\\nThe server came up to us right away and asked if we had ever been there before.  When we said no, she went on to tell us a quick history of Mother's Bistro and how everything was made from scratch.  \\n\\nI ordered the Stuffed Frittata (open-faced omelet with bacon, cheddar cheese & potatoes, topped with sour cream).  It was huge portion, came with whole wheat toast and only priced at $9.95.  It was yummy and very filling.  I also had a chance to taste my mom's Belgian Waffle and that was cooked perfectly.  Crisp on the outside and light & moist on the inside. A perfect complement to my breakfast was their delicious coffee from Portland's own Stumptown Coffee Roasters.\\n\\nWe liked it so much that we went back a couple days later.  This time I had Mike's Special Scramble (with prosciutto ham, roasted garlic, fresh tomatoes, basil & provolone cheese).  I took a and bite and fell in love!  For me it was that good.  The scramble was another huge portion that came with breakfast potatoes (yummy) & whole wheat toast and all for $9.95.  AMAZING!  Both the food and the price.  I snuck a taste of my sister's Biscuit Breakfast (homemade buttermilk biscuits topped with country sausage gravy).  While it was delicious, it was a little rich for me (taste wise) so I don't think I could have eaten a whole plate of it myself.

The food and the service are excellent.\\n\\nThe pretzel bread and the ribeye filet with the mushroom risotto is the best. They'll give you extra pretzel bread if you ask for it. Their cheddar soup is also very tasty, but can be a bit too salty at times. They switch up the type of poutine that they offer, but their classic one and the one that has caramelized onions on it are really good. If you get the 16oz. ribeye, it comes with fingerling potatoes and a salad, but you can substitute either with the risotto.\\n\\nThe prices are pretty high, the filet is $54 and the ribeye is $64. If you're using the Disney Dining Plan then it takes two sit downs. If you're not using the dining plan then expect to pay a pretty penny for your whole party. At least with the dining plan you get a lot more bang for your buck.\\n\\nYou're going to be very full when you leave here so i would recommend coming here for lunch and then having the rest of the day to walk it off as you browse the different countries.

As always the food was superb to say the least and the fact that they really went above and beyond to accommodate us, I am fan once again and I would be happy to host my office parties here in the future. \\n\\nTo me, customer service is sometimes even more important that the food its self. I go to restaurants for mostly the experience. They definitely made it up to me. \\n\\nThanks again Katy. \\n\\n\\n____________________________________________________\\nI took my girlfriend to Little Donkey last night for her birthday and right off the bat I have to say that just like almost all of the other negative reviews, POOR SERVICE POOR SERVICE POOR SERVICE!!!\\n\\nThe food at this restaurant was just simply amazing. The prices are slightly higher than expected but that's ok with me if the service was also on par. \\n\\nFor start, our waitress \\"Joelle\\" who by the way failed to introduce herself but thanks to my receipt, I got her name, seemed to have an attitude. For start, neither me nor my girlfriend could understand a word of what she was saying at first because she simply talked too fast and was in a rush. After placing several orders, the burger, the lamb bacon wrap, the beriyani, hummus and roasted beets and lastly the fried chicken sandwich. \\n\\nFor starters, we got our chicken sandwich within 10min of ordering but then sat for another 35 minutes to get the rest of our food. At this point you would think that the hummus would have arrived after finishing our other plates but no, Joelle forgot to place our order and then denied that we had even ordered it (who does that?) and on top of that gave us an attitude the rest of the night. By the time she got the order in, we were already done and didn't even finish the small plate. After we complained to her about it, she decided to simply ignore us most of the night. \\n\\nWhat's even MORE ANNOYING than anything is the fact that every bus boy and waitress just wants to clear your table without looking to see or even ask if you are done with your food. Please fix this issue. It's really annoying. We had to ask 5 different people to leave our plates because we simply eat slower and like to enjoy our food. \\n\\nOverall, I loved the ambiance, the food and everything else but the service. It FAILED big time and for the waitress to give us an attitude on a special night, it just ruined the night for both of us. It sucks because we really wanted to love this place. I sure hope the management will look into it."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"One word is all that's needed... DELICIOUS! Ok...

The prices are just a teensy bit more than you might find at a diner, but it's well worth it given the cheerful atmosphere and stellar service.

They sell a lot of vegetarian dishes (Matar Paneer, Aloo Gobhi, etc) for less than $10, which you definitely can't get anywhere closeby.

It was unbelievably crowded and packed tight in here. So tight that several accidents occurred at other tables with spills. This is probably the only negative I have to say about Crawfish Shack & Oyster Bar.\\n\\nSo how's the food? The four of us ordered and shared a dozen oysters, 6 pounds of crawfish, some fried butterfly shrimp and two soft shell crab po-boys. We still came out WAY cheaper per person than the disaster in the making I just reviewed, Port A Cafe. \\n\\nRaw oysters were large and fresh. Exactly what I was looking for at Port A Cafe the previous day. Very happy with Crawfish Shack & Oyster Bar's oysters. \\n\\nCrawfish can be seasoned mild, medium or spicy. It's a little odd for me seeing onions and mushrooms in the mix with crawfish, but whatever. The wife liked that. I ordered some extra corn and potatoes which were delicious. Sausage slices are hidden in there too. The crawfish were overly buttery, which I have heard complaints about before. This style seems normal in about anyplace in Austin other than Pappadeaux. Ordering the spicy probably cuts into that butteriness more. \\n\\nThere were not any mudbugs that I would describe as tiny soft and impossible to eat like I have been served at other places. Most were medium to medium large in size with a few REALLY large ones and a few smaller fellas.\\n\\nOur friend wasn't overly impressed with the butterfly shrimp. I didn't try a piece. She thought it should be larger. It looked average to me. It's not something I ever order though. So if that's your thing, I leave it up to you to decide.\\n\\nThe soft shell crab po-boys were so hot and fresh! You could tell the crab was deep fried only minutes before and not re-heated.

I started going to Modern (not MIKE's!!!!) the first weekend of my freshman year of college and I have not found another canolli anywhere since that comes even close to this gold standard. The secret to their success is that they don't fill the crisp canolli shells with the sweet, tangy and rich ricotta filling until you order one, which means the shell doesn't get soggy and the creme doesn't get crusty. It's perfection.\\nThe inside of this tiny no-frills bakery smells like heaven.

Wear your comfy clothes, not deal with parking, waiters, tipping and how to have a glass of wine and drive home.  Part of the appeal of going out to eat is the great food you can't get or make at home. Christophe has solved this.  You go into one of their 4 locations  (check the website for some \\"coolers\\" in other locations which will expand so check back often) and pick from a wide selection of hot and cold foods that really do have a chef prepared taste. \\n\\nThis is an affordable personal chef type service for everyday food. It can be delivered to you same day for $12 and for advance future delivery dates it's just $6.  Check out their special meal menus for holidays like Christmas, Valentine's Day and Thanksgiving. \\n\\nWhat I love about the food: I am very careful to eat whole natural food. The ingredients are listed clearly on the label along with nutrition facts. You won't find anything on that list that isn't already likely in your kitchen or has been in your kitchen. You just perhaps can't get it to taste as good as what's in Christophe's cooler  or simply don't have time during the busy workweek to make it.\\n\\nNote on reheating: The paper containers the food comes in is oven safe and I encourage you to do it that way. Sure you can microwave it but not only do you lose nutrition that way but you lose some of the texture you get by oven cooking. \\n\\nThe menu changes every 2 weeks and Christophe is smart enough to know some classic favorites need to always be in the mix. Vegetarian and paleo option are plentiful there. You will find \\"single\\" portions which for me, would feed two, and family size for 4.  Generous sized green salads,  tuna and  chicken salads and soups are available along with hot foods and wraps. The fridges are icy cold keeping the food super fresh til you're ready to heat it or eat it.\\n\\nI got a beer cheese soup to warm me up on a cold night. The beer flavor is clean and prominent balanced out by rich cream and sharp cheese. Bits of onion were floating around to give it a real homey yet refined taste but not gloppy or too thick.\\n\\nThe turkey lasagne is full on comfort food that tasted exactly like what I make when I have time which is NEVER. This version has no ricotta but it does have mozzarella layered in each layer. Wonderfully balanced flavor and filling pasta ratio. It's addictive!  Paleo version available.  Def reheata in the oven but it's great cold too!\\n\\nNow one near and dear to my French Food loving heart, Coq au Vin. Boneless chicken thighs cooked in wine and bacon served with carrots and fingerling potatoes.  If you don't know what you're doing this dish is sometimes tricky to make.  What a joy to find it available to go!  Grab a loaf of fresh bread available in the store and dinner is done. C'est magnifique!  Another one that needs the oven.\\n\\nNone of the food suffered from being overly salty but all of it was balanced and satisfying.

I found the ricotta filling to be sweeter than Mike's and the shell was crunchy and light.  Overall it is a matter of personal preference between Mikes and Modern when it comes to cannoli.

Plus if you happen to come during happy hour, draft Sapporo is $3 and Hot Sake $4 so this was up our alley.\\n\\nGreat service and really nice ambiance. This would be a great place for a date or a small and intimate group dinner. You can come casual or a little dressed up and either way you won't be out of place. The booths give a sense of privacy and there's counter seat by the sushi station so you can be right by the action!\\n\\nAs far as the menu...Every classic has a small spin, for example the Edemame starter comes in BBQ, garlic lime, or Sriracha Buffalo. The Garlic Lime edemame is nice and garlicky but missing some of that lime zest I was expecting.

Been here both for dinner and lunch. The reason I'm not giving it a 5 star is the salad that's served with lunch as well as their spring roll.

There was no sushi roll in the menu. The online wine on happy hour menu was the house wine which is $6. What is a house wine? Is it the cheapest that is $6 in the regular menus too? I order the highball for $8. Didn't seem like a good deal. Just go to Osprey Tavern and you'll see what is a great cocktail in the happy hour menu. The skewer was each $3. They were so tiny that I ended up ordering four of them which came out $12 and it didn't even taste great. What kind of happy hour is that?

FOR IGNORING OUR COMMENTS SECTION when we order on-line. \\n\\nWhen we ask for extra sauce (You know the ones ... the ones that are free sitting on every table in every Indian restaurant.. .the mint sauce, the tamarind sauce, the onion chutney) ... please respect our request and include them! When you ignore comments, we get fearful you are not reading OTHER things such as allergy info. \\n\\nOr... if you do NOT want to include extra sauces, you can consider making the dipping cups a little bigger, or at least topping off the cups in the first place.

First Manhattan was all bourbon (sweet vermouth was undetectable if it contained any and definitely no bitters were added). When I finally managed to wave the bartender down, she came over and said rather aggressively, \\"What's wrong with it?\\" In the most delicate tone I could muster, I asked for more sweet vermouth. She gave me some nonsense excuse about how \\"most people just want a splash of sweet vermouth.\\" You either make a good Manhattan or you don't. This one was not good. She did her best to fix it, but that's one of those things that is tough to repair once the ratio has been botched. Second Manhattan, ordered from a different bartender, was a thousand times better. \\n\\nI had the BBQ chicken satay appetizer and a caesar salad. The chicken was tasty. I would eat it again although it could have used some kind of garnish so that it wasn't just chicken in sauce on a plate. Still, not a bad option. But that caesar salad was an affront to all caesar salads everywhere. Croutons from a box? Kraft salad dressing?! I apologize, I have to say that again: KRAFT SALAD DRESSING?!?! I asked for it on the side and it literally came to me in its little plastic packet. I just can't believe that a place with a pretty solid reputation for having decent airport food couldn't whip up a real caesar dressing instead of that foul tasting, chemical laden crap in a bag.

My personal favorite is either Lee's Special banh mi or Lee's Special EGG banh mi. If you are brave enough to go with the Special Egg sandwich, then you are rewarded with a great big plate of ingredients, including the meats from the regular Special sandwich (head cheese and all!), pickled vegetables, and two sunny side up eggs. The bread comes out separately and you get to have a ball dressing the sandwich and building it to perfection! If you can't commit fully to banh mi, then try the combination with pho. The crunchy bread and steamy soup are a great combination.\\n\\nOk, so the food is fantastic, now let's talk prices... also fantastic! You can pick up yesterdays bread for the change in your pocket or get fresh loaves for just a hair more. The sandwiches are about $3, but you can get them for $2 each if you order 5 or more. This may sound crazy, but once you've had the banh mi you will realize that having one or two extra in the fridge won't hurt anyone!\\n\\nTo recap, get the banh mi (special, pork, or egg.. you really can't go wrong), get some pho to go with it, and get some food to go if you still aren't satisfied!

My husband and I went on a Friday or Saturday night . . . I know, not the best time to just go and try to get a dinner table without even calling ahead, but what can I say?  We live on the edge.  \\n\\nAnyway, the place was so packed that waiting on the inside was clearly out of the question.  Waiting in the . . . what do you call it? foyer? . . . the little place between the outside door and the inside door seemed a little too cozy as well, so we took a walk around the block, in the middle of January, then looked at the bikes in the window of Farina's next door, danced around in front to keep warm, moved into the foyer place, eventually upgraded ourselves to the inside, and were seated (yay!) at the sushi bar.  \\n\\nThe general look of New Ginza brought to mind Not Your Average Joe's.  They have those trendy lights that come in a red, yellow, blue, or green (maybe?) housing, and the waitstaff all wore black pants, white collared shirts, and ties.  My favorite thing about New Ginza was the service.  Our waitress was very friendly, and she helped my husband, who wasn't quite sure, decide on the teriyaki pork.  It was something different (teriyaki chicken is so cliche), and she recommended it as her personal favorite.  \\n\\nThe pork was done just right--cooked all the way through, but not dry, with a little bit of crispiness on the outside, and the sauce had a little bit of an extra gingery kick compared to standard teriyaki.  My nabeyaki udon was piping hot, with an array of ingredients that pleased even me, the girl who can't make 3-minute ramen without adding in at least five different things.  My memory is terrible, so I think it had fishcake, carrot, cabbage, bamboo shoot, egg, ummm . . . nori, and green onion?  Nevermind, don't trust me.  Try it yourself.  My tenpura was good, but not in my top tier of tenpuras.  My spicy tuna maki made my mouth happy, but then again, I don't know that I've ever met a spicy tuna roll I didn't like.  \\n\\nAfter stuffing ourselves, having our leftovers packed up, and leaving a nice tip, we squeezed our way out through thre crowd to a small chorus of good-nights and thank yous.  I was impressed that two out of three of the sushi chefs even said something.  It warmed me almost enough for the walk back to the car, but not quite.\\n\\nTwo last impressions that I just remembered, I was a little bit disappointed that the menu was more disproportionately sushi-heavy than I had hoped, and the price was somewhat expensive, or typical for a Japanese place."},{"name":"The Cheesecake Factory","address":"100 Cambridgeside Pl","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"Love the salads, tho remember the low calorie menu means different dressing only, FYI    The servings fill the plates with flavor and taste good.

Yes, many people will tell you that Mike's sells the best cannolis in Boston.  No, most of those people don't actually live in Boston.  This is a place for the tourists.  Tourists LOVE it.  Don't believe me?  Ask any of the 30 or so waiting in line at any given moment.  \\n\\nDon't get me wrong.  The cannolis are good.  Mike's was actually the first cannoli I ever tasted, as part of a purely selfless cannoli tasting experiment I undertook on behalf of my friends.  With no basis of comparison, I loved it.  However, the cannolis at Modern Pastry (down the street a little) or at Maria's (around the block) are much better.  Mike's pre-fills the cannolis, so they aren't fresh.  You really can taste the difference.  The cannolis are also more expensive at Mike's.  It's true that they're also a little bit bigger, but I find that the smaller cannolis actually have a much more pleasing filling-to-shell ratio.  The filling is very sweet, which is good, but it's not as ricotta-y as I might hope a ricotta cannoli will be.\\n\\nThe other pastries are also very good, and here is where Mike's deserves credit.  The selection is amazing - far better than any of the other pastry shops I've been to.  They have everything, including many different varieties of cannoli.  Now, I'm a purist (ricotta filling in plain shell, maybe some chocolate chips on the end), but if you want a peanut shell or something else fancy, Mike's is the place to get it.\\n\\nBut, overall, it's over-crowded, it's not as good as everyone says it is, it's complete chaos inside (it's not really a line, so much as a screaming cluster of people waving cash - much like I imagine the trading floor on Wall Street used to be), and I believe they still only take cash.

We came for an early dinner during the week and sat outside. \\n\\nSETTING: The place is funky and fun, and fits in perfectly with the vibe of Krog Street Market. No effort was spared on the interior design--down to details like pillows and soft treatments, the decorating is intentional. The bar is double-sided opening up onto the patio, which is kind of clever. The inside has high ceilings and lots of hard surfaces.

There was also another fellow who brought us our drinks and chips who was also attentive as well. Our food was out quickly. \\n\\nFOOD: They start you off with chips and two kinds of salsa. The green one (which was supposed to be the hotter of the two), I was turned off by the salt not the heat. The other one (a reddish / brown salsa) was quite good. The veggie enchiladas that I ordered came on a small plate with a side of rice and black beans. The enchiladas were awesome--I highly recommend getting the egg ($1 extra)--not too greasy, perfect portion, really great.

After they take my money, they tell me the shake machine is down, would I like something else. No, but what choice do I have? None! So I get home and both burgers are wrong. I ordered doubles, they gave me singles. One time this place forgot to put my cheese on the burger so they threw it on top of the bun, it melted to the box. I am serious, this is all true. So I decide to do their online survey. I make it very clear, after I told my story, that I didn't want to be contacted by anyone. Nevertheless, the district manager, who also doesn't seem to know how to follow directions, called me anyway. After he licked my boots until the cowhide began to roll up like toilet paper that got damp and was used to wipe a little too hard, he offered to replace my meal. I told him that wasn't necessary but he insisted. Fine, so In about a week, I drive thru and they tell me, that the drive thru window isn't working. C-mon, what BS. So finally, today I go to get my replacement meal and right off the bat, the shake machine is down, fine, I'll take a couple large Cokes. I advance to the assigned window, where I am told that they are out of Coke............are you freakin kidding me? 20 minutes later when the food was brought out to me, as I was instructed to park it. The place was so slow that cars were pulling out of the drive thru lane and going somewhere else. we took the bags and departed promptly. It didn't even taste like BK burgers. The kitchen help had been strutting around like a peacock in heat picking his fro and running his mouth. The night shift lead told me that if she says anything to him, he calls his mommy and his aunty and they come down and yell at her. She said upper manage won't say anything to him, so she says, screw it. The meal was lousy and if I owned that BK in Pickerington, Ohio, I'd fire the whole crew, including that DM that gave me the replacement meal, James Martin. I wouldn't eat another hamburger from that BK if District Manager, James Martin, delivered it to me riding on a white horse wearing lederhosen and a Burger King paper crown.

It's the sort of place I come when I'm tired and I feel energized when I leave. \\n\\nI love the stuffed french toast, the meatloaf, the chicken piccata, and the chicken matzo ball soup, and the burgers are always cooked to perfection. The Reuben is also amazing. I wasn't a huge fan of the omelette/hash and the Mac and cheese, but everything else has been delicious. Nice big portions. I also love the saut√©ed veggie side. Super fresh and tasty. Amazing potato salad too. And free bagel chips when you come in? Sign me up! \\n\\nI'm only giving four stars because the service can be slow on the weekends (although most of the servers are super speedy and awesome) and my one takeout experience was poor... I asked for extra gravy and got none at all, and the portion size was waaaay smaller than what I got in store.\\n\\nThey also do not allow strollers in the restaurant, which can be inconvenient, but understandable when they are busy.

The sauce was finger-licking good and the little meat that they did have was so freaken tender.\\n\\nThe brisket was wonderfully soft too, and I couldn't get enough of it's smokey black crust. The hotlink is a great option for an add-on, a surprisingly large portion with a complex, gritty interior. The pickled vegetables weren't my favorite, but they were a nice palate cleanser.

So I wait around for 5 or 10 minutes until she comes back to see if \\"the red-headed step child\\" is satisfied and I tell her just bring this cut back and be done with it\\n      c. She argues with me stating that I clearly will get it the right way the third time 'round and I push back at that point cuz I just don't feel like keeping the circus going and going\\n\\n3. Some highlights to note:\\n      a. It was my last day in Austin and I was seriously wanting some good BBQ but no luck apparantly\\n      b. I would have given the waitress a better tip if she had been more professional\\n      c. And rather than argue with me she should have taken the second return as a red flag and gotten a manager with no questions asked\\n      d. Most 4 to 5 star restaurants I have had great experiences but this a first that I attended a restaurant where I never spoke to the manager at a certain critical point\\n      e. I am always very clear to note that if it is an issue directly with the food, I will reassure the waiter/ess that it is not there fault so they don't feel like it is there fault and they can come back to the table guilt-free...I did that in this case to a fault\\n      f. As I started off the criticism is against both chef and waitress\\n\\n'nuff said\\n\\n\\nDisclaimer: Apparently my wife told me that yelp has my reviews as unreliable and explained that is because I don't have a picture up and I do not yelp. I would like to say by no means would I be giving a bad review to Lamberts Downtown Barbecue bad reviews. If my experience were good I would honestly give it an excellent review beyond what it might deserve even. But unfortunately it was a negative so shame on Lambert's for that. I did speak with Jennifer or Jessica and she assured me that things would get resolved. Good news is they make decent drinks so I have liquid in my belly now to cushion the blow.\\n\\nMaybe see you next time Lamberts."},{"name":"Agazajo's Flying Pizza & Italian Restaurant","address":"2406 US Hwy 183 S","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Hands down excellent service.

I got some of the Nutella doughnuts here not terribly too long ago and they were okay. I grew up in the southeast US and it didn't seem like they were terribly different from the ones I used to get at the county fair. You'd get a big bag of perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside doughnuts for $4 or so. So I thought the price for the 4 little doughnuts I got was a bit much. Definitely felt it was a middle of the road experience not great not bad. The huge issue for me was when I gave a 3 star review on Facebook and then I got chastised by an employee or the owner stating that Alton Brown enjoys their doughnuts with a screen cap of the tweet Alton Brown tweeted. It made me feel guilty that I didn't like their doughnuts that much and I wasn't even particularly saying they were bad just not these amazing little heaven pillows that I've been seeing people go gaga over. The staff, while I was there, was super friendly even though they were fairly slammed. The wait wasn't that long, but it was sweltering inside and I was ready to just get out of the place.

The waiter (Kenneth) was very welcoming, kind, and made stellar suggestions for dining, all of which i took, including the Hollywood Sushi for an appetizer.  When it comes to dessert, options, however, we were very limited and I think they should try to expand their offerings.

The red sauce on them was even nastier. I still stand by El Borrego as my go to place for low priced and good enchiladas. I did love the chips and dip they served us. And they give you a BIG container of dip to take home along with chips for FREE. That was pretty shocking but I was glad because that dip is awesome. I also ordered some sort of strawberry cheesecake and I must say that was delicious but overpriced. For $8 bucks they should go all out on the cheesecake. They have this place set up so horribly and what I mean is they have the tables right in front of the fans that are on high power. The chips and everything kept blowing off the table. That makes NO SENSE to have it set up that way. I want to enjoy my food on the table and not on the floor. And by the way there really was no point in having it on because it just blew hot hair. It was so muggy and hot out there. Our waitress Ashley was very nice and attentive. The other waitstaff were also nice. So service, chips and dip, and cheesecake were 5 stars!

Well, it arrived well done on the outer and med well in the very center. This was the driest, blandest steak I think I have ever eaten. It came accompanied with what was supposed to be an asparagus and grape tomato basil. What is was was not even 1 full stalk of asparagus cut into 1/2\\" pieces with 1 tiny grape tomato plopped on top of the steak. They gave you a truffle butter in a small cup that tasted more like melted margarine. This steak was so bad, I had even attempted to dip it in ketchup....ugh! I have never had to season my food or found myself in need of something to help it go down on any previous visit. I was not the only diner who had a bad steak at the table. We were all disappointed. It seems as Disney keeps charging higher prices the food quality has gone down dramatically. The deserts were good but not enough to save an overpriced not even Applebee's quality steak dinner.

Staff your restaurant for the needs of your audience!!! It's sunset time on a Friday and they don't have every server and their mother on staff? Seriously? Either they don't care if they are just not paying attention.

It's not overly authentic, but I like my sushi to be, well, fun. I have no problem experimenting with new sauces or even *gasp* fruit on/in my rolls. So if you're a sushi snob, you might want to stop reading.\\n\\nThe last time I was at the Seito in Baldwin Park, I had a great honor bestowed upon me. It was over the holidays, and my brother and sister (visiting from Houston) and I stopped by for a quick dinner. We were seated in the newly expanded portion of the restaurant, and then were told by our server that we were the first customers to eat the booth we were occupying! So, this entry is long overdue.\\n\\nMy favorite roll is the Torchamaki. The roll is filled with a spicy crawfish salad and topped with a thin slice of white fish, which is then \\"torched\\". If you're close enough to the sushi bar, you will know when this roll is just about done: you can literally smell the fish blackening. This roll is so rich in flavors that personally I can only eat two or three pieces. It's best balanced out with a light roll!\\n\\nA light alternative is the Kani Su roll. It has it's own uniqueness: crab (or should I say, Krab?) wrapped in thinly sliced cucumber with a light sunomono sauce (similar to a light vinaigrette). This roll is almost like a palate cleanser. For those of us who don't enjoy ginger.\\n\\nMy other favorites are the Popeye roll: fresh spinach, shrimp and crab wrapped in rice paper and served with an eel sauce as well as the Sweetheart roll: coconut shrimp, mango, cream cheese, apricot glaze and eel sauce (it literally tastes like the beach!).\\n\\nI've been to other Seito locations in town, but Baldwin is my favorite. The restaurant is comfortable and hip with a big city feel. I've made a pretty important decision in my current \\"Good Luck Chuck\\" status: I will never take a first date to Seito ever again. Or anyone I haven't been dating for more than two months, for that matter. I'm done with gazing into a stranger's eyes and seeing them light up as they taste the Torchamaki for the first time.

My boyfriend and his family were visiting for Thanksgiving holiday, and true to American fashion, we did the \\"Freedom Trail,\\" which led us to the North End. Having never ventured there, I had to go to the famous Modern shop and get one of their cannolis. We opted for the vanilla custard, which was decadent. I am not sure how they make their filling but it was rich and light at the same time and it went down your throat so smoothly, but it wasn't over-poweringly sweet. The outside shell had a good crunch to it, and the lady added some powdered sugar, which honestly, before I tried it thought would be over the top, but that little bit of white fluffiness is the PERFECT addition...like white on rice, I would get it again!

People were waiting outside for their turn to eat. My friend went in and we were told 30min wait, which was fine, and he gave his number for them to text him when it was ready. We walked to the waterfront to wait since it was so busy out there. We got a text not 15 mins later and quickly walked back. We asked to sit outside, so we had to wait a few more minutes (it was really hot inside so we thought it'd be cooler outside with the breeze). The only reason I'm not giving this place five stars is because the small blonde girl running the front end wasn't the most polite. It was obvious she was overwhelmed with how busy it was, I even went back inside after we had sit down to ask her where the bathroom was and she was quite rude and rushed. \\n\\nThey placed us outside and our waiter showed up with water right away and took our drink order. There was another waiter working outside and he was super friendly too, asking us about our phones and having fun little chit chat when he walked by. Our actual waiter was very nice too! We ordered our lunch and waited for a short time, even time to have some small conversation. We ordered appetizers. I had the calamari and my friend the cinnamon roll. The cinnamon roll was huge and pretty good... but that calamari was to die for. Best I've ever had! The dipping sauce gave it a little kick too. Man. I'd go back just for the calamari!! I didn't even care if I got my entree, I just wanted that entire plate in my belly!! \\n\\nFor Entree my friend had an omelet with goat cheese and bacon and he just loved it. I had crab cake sandwich. I tend to not be much of a fan of crab cakes because of too much mayo and such, but this was amazing. The bun was fresh, the cole slaw salad was crunchy and delicious, and the crab cakes melted in your mouth. I was super stuffed from eating all my calamari so I only had half of the sandwich and took the rest home for my husband to have. It was cold and he scarfed it. Said it was delicious, and he doesn't even like calamari but he ate what I had left. \\n\\nI ordered an iced tea without lemon. Easy request but you'd be amazed at how many places don't pay attention to the 'without lemon' part. It's never a big deal if I do get a lemon on the side, but I really appreciate a place that shows it actually listened and remembered something so small.\\n\\nOver all the food was excellent and the waiters were amazing.

I arrived mid-afternoon on a particularly rainy Sunday, and nearly turned around when I got to the door and saw how long the line was, but I figured that was probably a testament to how good the donuts were, so I stayed. That was when I started looking around and realized that there were no donuts on display; they were being prepared as ordered. Now, super fresh hot donuts, that's a great gimmick, and, although I knew it meant a longer wait, I thought it'd be worth it. Then I saw just how small the donuts were, and you have to buy them in sets of 4 (I'd say 4 Pip's donuts is roughly equal to 1.3 \\"normal size\\" donuts, but the cost was closer to what I'd expect to pay for about 3 \\"normal size\\" donuts elsewhere). The donuts were all the same, mini plain cake donuts, but you can choose which of 3 toppings you like. But honey and nutella just sounded so damn messy, and again, I can appreciate that after eating a donut your fingers are bound to be a little sticky, but not usually as bad as \\"I-just-ate-something-completely-coated-in-honey-or-nutella\\" sticky, so I got the cinnamon sugar topping.\\n \\nThe donuts were out in a reasonable amount of time; I spent about 8 minutes in line waiting to order, and had the donuts in my hand in another 8 minutes or so.

But to me, the freshness and warmth was about all they had going for them; certainly edible, plausibly \\"good,\\" but definitely not great. \\n\\nI do have to give them props for offering donut ice cream sundaes, but of all the great donut shops in town, I just can't really recommend Pip's and I won't be going back."},{"name":"China Pearl Restaurant","address":"9 Tyler St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"As a girl who was spoiled by NYC's dim sum I thought I would be a harsh critic, but it was actually a great experience and tasty meal!

So often these days I feel like I need a degree in coffee roasting to feel qualified to order. I don't want to know how many different types of beans you have \\"on tap\\" to make my coffee today.

Hello! You might as well grown the bean while you're waiting because it's going to take FOREVER (not really, but kinda) to get your brew. Not to mention, you feel like you're either a mad scientist or a muppet a la Beeker because they use these very posh glass canisters to brew it (which, BTW, don't keep your coffee hot while their brewing it so it's luke warm after you add milk to it); (2) Americans are obsessed with quick service and really, y'all need to give it a rest already. If waiting a whole 5-10 minutes for a cup of joe is your biggest problem of the day, you're really fucking lucky! I say this as someone who is a stickler for good service. Time from order to food at the table needs to be taken into context (e.g., how busy are they, are they under staffed, did the closer forget to do the prep and now the morning staff are making up for lost time).

From what we could tell, they appeared to be hosting a wedding reception on the top floor, so with the night game, we had no issue with the wait. \\n\\nWe actually received a call about our table being ready after only 40 mins, and were happy to find that they were able to seat us in the restaurant -- important as the other guys in the group were from NorCal and NYC, so none of us really loved the heat outside.\\n\\nSince our plans were still pretty up in the air for the rest of the night, we decided pretty quickly to share a few dishes, deciding on one order of boar ribs, two orders of country ribs, and one order of baby back ribs, along with a side of mac n cheese and a side of brussel sprouts. The server got the hint that we were in strictly for business, so she ensured that our food came out quickly and put everything together family style. Overall, service was very good.\\n\\nThe food:\\n\\nThe mini corn bread was good, not great, with actual pieces of corn in each. These were served with standard butter. I like my cornbread to be a little sweet, so perhaps this swayed my rating.\\n\\nThe boar ribs were hands down my favorite. I've never had boar ribs before and did not expect them to be so small. I didn't actually look at the description on the menu and didn't piece together that they were intended to be a take on chicken wings until I bit into my first one. They were cooked crisp and flavored perfectly. They did not last.\\n\\nThe baby back ribs were good, not great. The bark toward the end of the rack was pretty tough and dry. The rest of the meat was pretty good, not earth shattering.\\n\\nThe country ribs were preferred by half of our party, with the maple glaze providing a hint of sweet that is sometimes lost when one tries to accomplish it with brown sugar. These were probably the second to disappear at the table.\\n\\nThe mac n cheese was very cheesy, and surprisingly, had a bit of a vinegar taste to them. I enjoyed them, though nothing else really stuck out about them.\\n\\nEven though I'm not a fan of brussel sprouts, these were pretty good and mild compared to how I'm used to smelling/tasting them (we usually prepare them fried on a cast iron skillet, dressed in olive oil, and salt and pepper).\\n\\nOverall, Lambert's was good, not great.

The food is good and prepared quickly, so I can swing by for a quick bite in the middle of my day, too.

The calamari was alright. But one of the meals were completely wrong. We got a red sauce pasta instead of the lemon garlic shrimp pasta. It was atrocious. It was gluten free pasta instead of whole wheat which really ruined the night. The rest of the meals (burrito & orange chicken) were mediocre but I didn't really expect much at that point.

Although I work walking distance from Gumbo's and eat lunch out on a very regular basis, I've been maybe once in the last year.

The menu is a bit overwhelming, especially for someone as indecisive as myself, but with the help other yelpers suggestions, I ultimately went with the Empire Eggs, which is 2 poached eggs over HUGE potato pancakes (i'm talking 2in thick - massive) and roasted potatoes and hollandaise sauce. The portion was really big, I thought the potato pancakes would be dainty and light but they were really big and I definitely didn't need more potatoes on the side. I wish I had room to try the banana stuffed french toast because the people next to us had it, and it looked delicious.

I saw the groupon and bought it immediately. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday afternoon. There was a 20 minute wait. We checked out the board game store while we waited. They sat us down after 15 minutes, a nice seat next to the window. We showed them our groupon and they rang in our orders with an extra pouched egg to each pho. The groupon claimed a $27 value, which matched the menu price for 2 orders of pho with two croissants. To our dismay, it actually came with 2 half orders. It was the saddest looking pho bowl in the world; we came prepared to eat a big bowl of delicious pho, so you can imagine the dissatisfaction in our hearts. In reality, we saved no money with the groupon and got two croissants that we did not really want. Shame on them for false advertising. \\n\\nAdditionally, we came at a busy time of the day. You could see the stress on our waiters face; he ran away from us quickly to the next table without ever coming back unless we were actively seeking him. After our pho arrived, it was missing the pouched egg. I sat their, while my soup was getting cold for 5 minutes because I wanted to inform the server that our egg had been forgotten and I did not want to be charged for it. It was a lot of effort to get his attention and when we he finally came we asked him if there were eggs in our soups and that we ordered the add-on. He turned around so fast and ordered them without even turning back around. I was planning on cancelling the order because I was not interested in waiting longer while my soup was losing more heat. After eating, we waited for the bill but eventually went up to pay. I was shocked to discover that we were charged for the two eggs. Maybe the service would have been better if we had come on a slower time of the day?\\n\\nOn the other hand, the pho was simply delicious.

We normally hang out at the Fez on Thursdays and Fridays, so we were expecting a similar scene... unfortunately this place can't even compare to the Fez.\\nMy two complaints are about the DJ's and the bartender.\\nWe arrived around 11pm.  There were 8 people in our group, and then maybe another 10 people in the entire bar.  Dj Non was still spinning and he always plays an eclectic mix and keeps the dancefloor dynamic.  The only reason I gave Red Cap two stars instead of one is because DJ Non is pretty awesome.  \\nThen one of the other DJ's took over and it all went downhill from there.  He started playing songs more on the industrial side, which is cool, but it's nice to mix it up.  I requested a classic song by Visage and the DJ told me that he probably wouldn't play it because he was moving into the industrial stuff.  Now I understand that he's just doing his job, but the dancefloor was literally empty for 4 of his industrial songs.  Seriously?  If the floor is empty for 4 songs, you're doing it wrong.  And if the largest group in the bar requests some songs (especially considering that the bar was practically empty besides us at that point), maybe you should deviate from your DJ agenda and play something that would actually get people moving.  Eventually, he played a couple of good songs that got us all up, but then went right back to his own groove again.  Lame.\\nEven more lame was the bar.  They pour the weakest drinks in town and they are expensive- $6.50 for an ounce pour of Jamesons.  When I asked for a double after realizing how tiny the drinks were, the bartender told me that it was too late for a double.  I can understand if he was worried about over-serving someone, but this was my husband's second drink of the night, so I really just felt like he was giving us attitude.\\nThe crew at Red Cap needs to get over their egos and remember that people are there to have a good time.  We were the only large group in the bar besides a handful of other people, and we were a pretty mellow group (half of the our friends are straight edge).  We were just there to have a couple of cocktails, celebrate a birthday and dance and Red Cap disappointed on all levels.\\nIt's too bad because we need a good Wednesday dance night in PDX."},{"name":"Saithong Thai Fusion","address":"710 SW 2nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The best Thai food.

I do have some thoughts for some of the poor reviews I'm reading, because many of them are laughable. The best way to judge a person's reviews on Yelp is to quickly check out their profile and see just how many negative reviews they leave in comparison to their positives. In the case of Seito, you'll notice that most people who give such lowly reviews are the type of people who only go out of their way to leave negative feedback, the type of people who need everything to go precisely their way from the moment they step foot on the block. To all those people, I'd like to be very clear about something that the patient and kindly restaurant workers you encounter won't say: the world actually doesn't completely revolve around you! (Gasp!!!!)\\n\\nYes, their menu changes. That's actually something an intelligent eater would appreciate, considering how different ingredients are available and peak at different times during the year. Common sense, no?\\n\\nYes, sometimes service isn't lightning fast. But, if you'd look around for a moment, you'd notice that there are actually OTHER PEOPLE around you! And guess what? They want to eat too! Not once will you see a Seito server standing around or playing on their phone. These people WORK and are going as fast as they can. Which you could see, if your head wasn't up your ass. If you wanted FOOD NOW! then I'm sure they'd be happy to serve you at a fast food location somewhere far away from Baldwin Park. Seito has real, talented chefs in the back freshly prepping your meal for you and a professional, knowledgable staff coming to your table. \\n\\nI've eaten at this specific location numerous times and over the span of years. I've never had to wait dreadfully long (if you are a drama queen make a GD reservation if you go on the weekend) and the service is always impeccable. No one is perfect, crap happens, but they are always courteous, helpful and patient whether I am ordering take out or I stay for three hours. \\n\\nIf you go for lunch (which I recommend!) grab their tuna combo. If you're a ramen fanatic, try their Tonkatsu. If you want to drink, try one of their delicious seasonal cocktails from that ever changing menu. Their sushi rolls are also amazing (love me that Ultimate Spicy Tuna) and their Peking Duck Bao buns are surprisingly unique and tasty, hitting a sweet spot while being super savory as well. \\n\\nGo to Seito and appreciate it for what it is, a beautiful, clean restaurant filled with smiling faces and an endless variety of new and satisfying meals to indulge in.

Located on the second floor, it is huge Chinese style restaurant that houses a dog-eat-dog battle over the best dumplings or noodles on most weekends. Very authentic from the food to the wait staff to the decor. 100% real dim sum experience. \\n\\nDim sum is the equivalent of Spanish tapas, small dishes of delicate Chinese food that is shared among a group of people. Definitely bring at least 3 people with you since most dishes have 4 items. It's a free for all once you arrive: if you arrive early before 10 am you can easily get a seat, after that you get put on a wait list. DON'T be shy to push you way to the podium to make sure your name is there. The elderly Chinese men and women aren't, so shouldn't you. \\n\\nAs for the food, you have your staples such as dumplings, buns, and rice noodles but for the more adventurous try the marinated chicken feet, cow tripe/intestines, or pigs blood. Ladies push carts ladened with goodies and shouting out the names in Cantonese but if you don't know Cantonese just stop them and ask them to lift up the lids. \\n\\nTea is automatically served. Waiters are fast and efficient to sweep off empty plates so that you can populate the table again. A no-frill restaurant that is loud and boisterous but that is the charm of dim summing.

It was like chicken broth with chunks of broccoli and chunks of cheese, an odd choice for a classically fine soup. The truffle fries would've been great if the fries were hot. The pork belly skewers would've been delicious if they weren't so dried out. The chocolate almond bread was the most extraordinary part of our meal, unfortunately we had to beg a second time to receive it. It was really good, not overly chocolatey which is good, but it looked like a long turd on a plate! I was the only one brave enough to try a dessert that comes with a warning of taking 40 minutes to make. To make what? A strawberry cheesecake milkshake, one of my favorite flavor profiles. It was absurdly disappointing, mostly Cool Whip and served Luke warm. What the bloody hell? Needless to say we had our disappointing dishes removed from our check after informing management.

The size of the shrimp were just average though. The quality of the food to me was no different than going to Joe's and definitely better than Red Lobster. The only downside I would say about this place is they dont season the food as much as other places, but that wasn't a huge deal to me.

I had very little time and only had enough time to choose one donut shop in town, and the less daunting size of a mini donut intrigued me most (didn't hurt that it was also the closest to PDX on the way). This donut shop was so cute, very Portland-sequel, and there is a side room that appeared to have a good number of seats if you have time to sit down.\\n\\nI went for one dozen, three of four flavors I found most appealing: the Dirty Wu, raw honey and sea salt, blueberry and lavender (or was it blackberry and lavender?), and the candied bacon with maple. Wow. I already prefer mini donuts to regular size, because of the better ratio of soft dough to deep fried goodness, and I think these were the best I've ever had. My favorite was definitely the bacon and maple. The bacon had an excellent softer consistency like bacon jam, which made it easier to eat. For sure the best maple bacon donut I've ever had. I also tried a chai, he Ginger Rodgers with almond milk. I wished it had been a little spicier for my taste, but it had a lovely ginger flavor.\\n\\nIf you're debating which donut shop to visit, definitely put Pip's on the top of your list! Also, many other Yelp reviews I read about competitive spots complained of a stale taste or consistency in other donuts. That will never happen here since they're making the donuts to order!

I pull up to the window to pay and a girl their asked me if I ordered a 50 piece nugget, which I said yes and she said they don't do them anymore. I told her I've ordered them before and they give me 2 20 piece boxes and 1 10 piece box, which she look stunned when I said that, she then repeated to say they don't sell 50 piece nugget orders. I then asked her to sell me the 2 20 piece and 1 10 piece which she still hesitated to sell to me because they dont sell 50 piece. It's not rocket science and it doesn't take a degree in math to calculate that and give the customer their order. This location in particular has, excuse my words but it has sucked since it opened.

Right before we finished the cauliflower snacks we received our garlic knots. Which I will say did not have any overly charred areas but were cooked perfectly. The right amount of crunch with the soft inside. The sauce was good but I couldn't resist dipping my knot in the left over cauliflower sauce. \\n\\nOnce finishing our knots we waited about 8 mins or so before the item I've been waiting for arrived.  THE PIZZA!! At first glance it looked great. The perfectly charred peaches, the right amount of cheese, not to much char on the crust, I mean honestly I was excited. I took a few bites and everything just worked so well, It was the perfect balance. I initially complained about the char on the crust and I would say my only complaint would be that I would have liked more of it. It doesn't have that burnt coal taste or anything that you would expect.

If you aren't into soup, you should definitely still hit up a Vietnamese restaurant; the rice and noodle dishes are excellent, not to mention the banh mi, an excellent sandwich.

The atmosphere is dark and gloomy, they added flower displays and a long paper dragon to the dining area but still its unpleasant.  The dim sum is just terrible.  Portions are small, dry like its been left out for a while, and just not tasty like their Quincy branch.  I think the best chefs were moved to Quincy and the flagship restaurant has been forgotten.  I remember back in the day i would have to wait over an hour to get into the Chinatown China Pearl.  Today, we just walked right in, no waiting and sat down immediately.  That was a bad sign right away.  The waiter did not even ask us what kind of tea we wanted and just gave us whatever.  What a disappointing brunch we had.

Omg, what a travesty!\\n\\nI've been to China Pearl for dinner, lunch, banquets, dim sum.  But normally, I only go here for dim sum and banquets.\\n\\nThe summary:  4.5 stars for the dim sum, 3.5 for dinner, 4 for banquets.  I think my banquet rating may be biased though, since I've gone to so many there, it's like a tradition.  Service is usually good and attentive, food is good, and price is not bad.\\n\\nThe dim sum: one of my favorites foodwise, a sentiment obviously shared by many given the crazy rush every weekend.  Hint, sundays are busier than saturdays, be there before 11:30 or after 1 to avoid the rush.  They stop serving at 2:30 but the selection starts dwindling as well.  Speaking cantonese helps, but the dim sum ladies speak enough english to tell you the general ingredients at least.  You can order pitchers of water, which makes things easier for you and the waitstaff when you have a large table.  If you're a beginner, avoid the cart with the chicken feet. It's full of advanced stuff including tripe.  The food up at the buffet is also good,  with things like spicy salty shrimp, pig's blood (it's good, really), chow foon, etc.  When you do get there, make sure to go up and ask for a number.  If you're there at rush hour, you'll be waiting for a while (especially in a large group).  It's easier to be seated in a small group but I personally like going en masse and devouring dim sum like hungry savages.  Also I advise to tip well - I know there isn't a single waiter/waitress serving you, but there's a number of them, and the service is quick.  And they'll appreciate it.  Also they've switched their take out containers to styrofoam, so if you're an environmentalist, keep that in mind. Bring your own tupperware or something.\\nSome people say the food at hei la moon is way better, but I think they're about the same.  They share the same staff, which I think includes the chefs.  Chau Chow City is the other one people mention, but I think the quality of the ingredients is better at China Pearl.\\n\\nThe dinner:  Not much to say, really.  It's your standard Chinese place, the food is pretty good, the waitstaff attentive... it's solid.\\n\\nThe banquets:  The food is always good, and I don't know what kind of magical pig they use for their appetizers but the char siu is fight-over-the-last-piece good.  Sometimes when they serve a big fish, it comes overcooked, which I understand, since it's really hard to cook a large fish completely yet not overcook it.   But other than that, the food is invariably very good.  And for you people who love mango pudding, there's been times they serve that as part of dessert.  Big giant mango puddings in interesting designs for each table.  Ours was in the shape of a fish.   And the garnishes are often interesting too. Once we had a carrot carved in the shape of a dragon, that looked really cool."},{"name":"Bia Bistro","address":"35 S Main St","city":"Cohasset","stars":"4","text":"If you have never tried Brian's 'tiny veal meatballs' or his 'Guinness braised short ribs' you simply must go.

The Calamari (spicy marinara, lemon aioli, gremolata) $11 and the Spinach and Artichoke Dip (Torterilla La Nina corn tortilla chips, pita) $10 both tasted okay, but were a bit light portionwise.

Extra croutons appeared exactly when we needed them, before we even asked.\\n\\n- Orata crudo (raw sea bream): This blew my mind. Rather than being seasoned with the traditional bright citrus acid, this dish went in a totally different direction, combining roasted broccoli and thrice-fried garlic chips to give a nutty, warm effect that still allowed the fish's flavor and texture to shine. There was an oil on the plate that I think might have contained roasted (mild) chile, adding to the roasty goodness. I am rarely surprised by food, but this surprised me, in the best possible way. I could have eaten four more servings. Maybe I will, next time.\\n\\n- Peeky toe crab toasts: This is one of the $5 snacks. Two bites of perfectly seasoned crab salad on thin toasted baguette slices. The crab was fresh and tender, and the only bad thing about the dish is that it was small.\\n\\n- White anchovies: My memory is embarrassingly failing me on the details, but I remember thinking that these were excellent and fairly generously portioned for a $5 snack.\\n\\nThe rest of the menu looked extremely tempting, but I wasn't really there for dinner, so I'll have to go back to start working my way through it.

My sister decided to bring me here (in her defense, it used to be good) so I gave it a try and didn't want to run out the door the second I got in.\\n\\nWe were rushed to order our food and I chose whatever would be the easiest to cook so I could nibble and leave. Again this one waitress kept barking orders and demands to the cook over our shoulder....again....I still ignored! We saw our ticket slide across the table to the cook with ciggy hands as he proceeded to prepare our meal. One Egg & Cheese Sandwich on an English Muffin with a side home fries. (How could you mess that up, right?) Well lets start by saying that the contraption they call a stove looked like it hadn't been cleaned since the very day they opened the place. The home fries were piled up in the upper left corner of the stove, directly side by side next to a bowl they chuck egg shells into. The egg yokes from the bowl were dripping down on the potatoes with little bits of egg shells in it...How delectable!\\n\\nHe dumped a handful of butter onto the stove and began to crack an egg on top of it. A few seconds on the stove and while he thought no one was looking--decided to slide the egg with his BARE, dirty cigarette fingers across the top of the stove to make room for someone else pancakes (NO GLOVES). My sister caught the same thing, as we made eye contact and decided to Jet out of there as fast as we could. We told the waitress we had to cancel our order, and proceeded to run out the door in disgust. She than yells across the room that we have to cancel our order, the chef complains that he's already started...Aand by this time we're out the door.\\n\\nI just cant believe we were the only ones to witness this. if that type of stuff is going on out in the open at their breakfast bar, in broad daylight, i wouldn't want to see what goes on behind closed doors or in the back kitchen for the matter. This place is an absolute shame!!!

Love the wine, and not priced too bad. \\n\\nWhile I love my steak, my better half (MBH) can take or leave steakhouses in general. So she always lets us diversify the experience with the less steak centric courses.  We enjoyed the beet and goat cheese salad and Poutine with bacon. They were well presented and executed. The steak, I had the ribeye, was just OK, and for the price it should have been more. MBH ordered agnolotti, which weren't up to par.

We were seated in the room across from the entrance and it's probably one of my favorite areas to dine it. It's on the small side, but the wall of antique/vintage mirrors, curtains, exposed brick and other little touches make it a very enjoyable space. I ended up having the Belgian Waffle with local raspberries and whipped cream and it was delicious! The raspberries had so much flavor and I could probably put that whipped cream on cardboard and it would taste good.\\n\\nWe've also had the pleasure of stopping by here for dinner. The Man got the Chicken & Dumplings, which he said was the best he's ever had. I ended up getting the $15,000 Dugeness Crab Cakes (I was impressed with the name, okay?). They were good, nothing amazing to write home to Florida about, but I didn't come down with food poisoning and felt satisfied after the meal, so it definitely wasn't terrible. If I were you, I would probably try them when they're cheaper during lunch instead of spending the extra $6. I'm not sure what's different between the lunch and dinner plates, but I'm just saying. For dessert, we had the chocolate cream pie and oh. My. Goodness. I can eat slices of that for days.

The pork was in a spicy ( not very even at medium) sweet sauce with onions and pretty tender and tasty. It had some tendon or something in attached to some of the pork strips that I found not so appetizing in texture, but I generally liked the pork and the rice and the little salad,the mystery potstickers ( maybe they were chicken?) and the cold battered zucchini. I also liked the three little dishes of banchan. There was kimchi, some kind of delicious potatoes in yummy sauce ( cold) and a  creamyish broccoli salad. I liked them all.

I literally came to Atlanta to drop off my belongings with at my colleague's house in Powder Springs and didn't come back until 3 weeks later.  Not only did I have a long drive in from DC stopping through SC, but I also had to fly out to San Francisco the next morning at 7 AM.  My colleague took me over to the Atlantic Station area to scope out the scene and showed me around.  We were originally thinking about the cheesecake factory, but I was attracted by how the outside of Strip was designed.  It was a glass wall laced with different bottles of alcohol.  I didn't actually wanted to go in, but I did go check out the menu.  I was wondering if it was a steak place with a name like Strip.  Well actually, I thought Strip was a name more fitting for a club.  Strip is a restaurant that serves American Steak and Seafood with Sushi.  I thought that was interesting combination to be doing.  In the back of my mind I remained a skeptic of places that decide to go for variety instead of specializing in one type of cuisine.  \\"A little of everything and a lot of nothing.\\"  Long story short, we went in.  The inside of strip was multi-leveled and very trendy looking and it did look like the bar would be able to attract some sort of happy hour crowd or even late night young professional drinkers.  There were nice flat panel TVs playing the one of the Celtics Vs. Lakers finals game.  I noticed there was a nice outdoor seating areas where you can enjoy the good weather and check out the pedestrians of Atlantic Station.  We opted for indoor seating in the first level where we could enjoy the game.  My co-worker decided that the appetizer should be spinach dip.  Somehow spinach dip or creamed spinach has become one my staple default selections starting from this day.  Since we were having a spinach dip, I also decided that I was going to stick to the more western menu selections.  I didn't think a sushi selection would mix too well with the aftertaste of the spinach dip.  I went for the full rack of the danish baby back ribs as my main course.  Being in the south, I generalized that ribs should be a primary staple in the restaurant if it is on the menu.  In my opinion, these ribs were way too skinny for baby backs.  These pork ribs didn't have enough meat to sink my teeth into and I couldn't feel the tenderness of the meat.  I should not be trying to gnaw the meat off the bone.  Well cooked ribs are defined by how the soft tender meat falls off the bone and melts in your mouth.  These didn't really do that for me.  The highlight of this meal was the apple cobbler, which in my head really means apple pie with a nice thick crust.  My colleague had the foresight or hunger to order dessert after the meal and out came this huge pear cobbler.  The crunchy crust mixed with the warm gooey sweet peer fillings was a great combination of taste and texture.  All in all the meal was OK.

Not a single speck was left. \\n\\nDinner: Halibut Biryani; Basmati rice, saffron, cashews, cardamom, sunflower seeds; very filling and yummy. \\n\\nWok Fried Chow Fun; rice noodles, mushrooms, escargot, Calabrian chili, black beans, green curry. This dish was absolutely delicious wish I would have ordered but sharing was just as great. \\n\\nBurger; Dry aged beef, buffalo pickles, onion soup mayo, foie gras, jalape√±o chips; this was not much of a hit at the table.

I'm glad they had been open for a few weeks before we got to Florida, because reading some of the reviews I was hesitant. The thing to remember is that every new restaurant needs to get into their groove and for me Toothsome definitely has.\\n\\nI think we purposely avoided eating for a chunk of the day because we knew this was going to be a big one. Our table of three walked in not knowing how much longer they were open for and everyone at the host stand immediately started glowing - they were there for the first engagement and they were all happen and excited to have another table. I don't think I've ever been welcomed that well that late in the day. Major props to Eric at the front who remembered seating us and called out while we were leaving. Its rarely for people to all out to you specifically, especially with how many people must have been sat while we were there.\\n\\nWe were seated on the second floor, relatively close to the windows, and the view was incredible. Even if we hadn't been seated there, everything seemed to have been designed with the eyes in mind as every nook has something to look at and for. Professor Doctor Toothsome stopped by our table, along with Jacques, and the interaction was only over shadowed by the one we had with our server, Ron, and runner, Josh. \\n\\nThe food was amazing, but the service... it is rare for me to seek out a manager to tell them about good service. I worked in the industry for a bit, so I have an idea of how I think service should be, and it needs to be outstanding to warrant me to take my time to find a manager because as great as yelp is, there is always a chance that they will never see this. I purposely found a manager on this occasion. Ron was incredibly helpful, knowledgeable about the vast menu, knew his favorites, and checked on us the correct amount of times (not too much and not too little, there is a balance). He knew we were taking pictures and filming everything and he was kindly conscious of that - which I wouldn't expect from people who don't take pictures as incessantly as I do, but he was very mindful. Same with Josh, who I don't know if food runner was actually his title, but he brought everything out and explained it and held it up for us so that we could get a good angle for our pictures. Like holy crumbs - you could come here and order something small and just stay for the service.\\n\\nThe menu is incredibly vast and you would probably be lying if at least one thing didn't stand out to you. Between the three of us we ordered 3 appetizers, two entrees, a soup, three milkshakes, and a sundae. We took a ton back to our hotel room, but it was all well packed for us. Overall - if you don't make a stop here then you are missing out. Doesn't matter how long our next trip is because I will definitely be going out of my way for Toothsome again.\\n\\n(Should be noted that we went in September 2016 and I just noticed this was saved as a draft instead of posted.)"},{"name":"Cupidone Coffee House","address":"3021 NE 72nd Dr, Ste 11","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Amazing service!

The lines (which they can't and wouldn't want to control) are outrageous, but more so is their management of such lines (which they could and should control).  \\n\\nI've been to Mike's too many times and waited in their atrociously long and confusing lines.  Once you get in the shop, you can wait forever, only to realize you are in the wrong line.  Once you finally get to the counter, you'd better know what you want because you will only be able to see what's in front of you.\\n\\nThe pastries are delicious.  I want to call Mike's overrated, but since I'm not into desserts, I'll leave judgement to someone who can tell the difference.  What I do know is management, and those lines make me puke...straight up puke my $4 cannoli right into their little white boxes with twine bows on them."},{"name":"Artessano","address":"1211 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This food truck is tucked away in east Austin. It was a cute area surrounded by other food trucks, music, nice seating, and board games. It was raining while I was there, but luckily there was covered seating. The food was good and the guy working there was sweet. My friend and I ordered the chicken arepa, the Hawaiian empanada, and the spinach and cheese empanada. The chicken arepa was great! It was generously stuffed with beans, cheese, avocado, and your protein of choice. The guy working recommended chicken or beef. I went with chicken and enjoyed it. The Hawaiian empanada was also good. It was filled with bacon, pineapple, and cheese. For some reason the spinach and cheese empanada was extremely greasy, so I do not recommend that. Overall, it was a good experience.

You either love it hate it, there is really no middle ground when it comes to Mikes.\\n\\nI've lived in Boston my entire life and still use Mikes as my yardstick for which I measure all other pastry shops to. Some of come out ahead, many have fallen short.\\n\\nThey offer a MASSIVE selection of baked goods, from cakes, to cookies, to cannolis, to anything else you can imagine. They are absolutely packed on weekends / holidays (lines down the street in some cases), so don't go in expecting a quick trip. Services is a no frills in and out type deal, but in no way rude, hurried, or pushy. Love the cookies and the carrot cake, always pick up something if I'm in the area. Prices aren't too bad, but you're likely to get out of there cheap.

The smells sounds and sights are what truly draws you in. The retail side (which is the right hand side as you walk in either spinning door or regular) has everything you could ever want as far as sweet treats. Chocolate abound, cotton candy, macaroons, chocolate covered strawberries and so much more. There is a whole wall of sweet treats you can mix and match in a bag and pay by the pound. Steam punk everything, chocolates that have been molded into gears, keys and locks. Shirts with intriguing designs and old world hats that everyone can put on and take a super cute selfie with. \\nThe dessert counter which is the left side has a staff of steam punk dressed ladies and gentlemen (everyone I mean EVERY ONE there is dressed as such) that will make you one of many shakes and desserts they have. To be honest the shakes are good (nothing you can't really make at home) but they are more \\"pretty\\" than anything else. Good for photos but not something you need to go out of your way for. \\nThe restaurant is another visual draw in. There are two floor for dining as well as an outdoor patio area. We got to dine upstairs, which I must say was gorgeous. Giant screens of gears, buckets and pulls moving, shooting and carting chocolate. \\nThe details that went into this place, well they spared no expense. \\nThe food was pretty good. They have a rather large menu to choose from with items you don't normally find, with things like duck flat bread to beef bourguignon. \\nI had the wild mushroom and chicken risotto and the husband had the duck flat bread. The portions are great and the flavor was on par. You won't be leaving hungry or unsatisfied.

First taste of my daughters soup was super yum.  First taste of mine was fishy but soon got use to it and it turned out to be tasty.

I didn't really enjoy it. \\n\\nThe most important thing to me in a pho restaurant is the broth.  Broth is everything! \\nAlthough the broth here was super hot and tasty.  The test is after we leave the restaurant.  Within 15 minutes we were both super thirsty :( so sad because it was really really good pho. \\n\\nWe are the left over pho later that evening and I just had about 5 spoons of soup and within 10-15 minutes I was super thirsty...not good :( \\n\\nWhy so much MSG????  \\n\\nWould I come back...I really want too, but I probably won't because of all the MSG."},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"jalapeno sausage is the best ever had.\\nsolid service at the bar.\\ncool vibe.\\nhigh end cocktails with large whiskey/bourbon selection.\\nvery good experience."},{"name":"MJ Donuts Cafe","address":"2300 Deer Creek Commerce Ln, Ste 300","city":"Davenport","stars":"4","text":"The price is right for the amount of food and quality of food you'll be eating here.\\n\\nThey just opened, so they're working on decor...

Definitely worth the drive to Malden for good dim sum. Quality is on par with previous visits. Glad that they are able to keep the freshness of ingredients and taste at such level.\\n\\nWe arrived early, about 9:50AM. Boy, were we glad. At 10:20, the crowd started to come in and there is a wait for a table. If you want dim sum on weekend here, please be sure to arrive before 10. Else, there will be a line.\\n\\nWe stick with the usual, nieces went nuts for the char siew bao. The steamed shrimp dumplings and fish dumpling were fresh and good. The stuffed eggplant was filled to the brim with minced fish paste. So good and fresh.\\n\\nTried their ham Sui gok for the first time. It was wonderful, not too sticky though a little on the sweet side. Both Egg tarts and baked char siew bao were good, according to the family.\\n\\nAs usual, my complaint is the cheong fun. If only they can make it softer - then it will be a game changer. \\n\\nAlso found out that if you want to order stir fried noodles, you'll have to wait till 11AM. Guess the chef doesn't come in till then. \\n\\nServers were always available to refill your tea and get you all the condiments you want. That's a lot to say about this place. Plenty of places in Boston and Quincy lack attentive servers like Ming's. \\n\\nThe restaurant is definitely too small to accommodate more dim sum push carts. There were only 5 carts for a full house restaurant. considering how tight the space is, it's probably best if they offer steamed to order dim sum.\\n\\nDefinitely worth the trod to Malden."},{"name":"Fishook Grille","address":"264 19th St, Ste 2160","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I didn't get hooked by this fishhook. I was expecting so much more from this place being that it was highly talked about and it's in Atlantic Station. \\n\\nIt's very casual and cafeteria like. I was expecting more of an upscale dining place. You stand in line and place your order. You're given a number to take to your table, seat yourself and wait for your food. Again, not what I expected. The guy who took our order was very helpful, and friendly. He took his time to help us pick out some dishes he thought we'd enjoy.  The seating area was a bit confusing. Not really sure what kind of mood/vibe they were going after. I sat inside, so the next time I go I'll try the patio out.\\n\\nThe dish I had was...eh, so, so. I've had better. I ordered the Snapper. It was a little on the tough side and wasn't seasoned to taste. I won't judge their entire menu from the one dish I had, will definitely try something else. I was happy to see that their prices were very reasonable so don't worry, you won't break your pocket.
