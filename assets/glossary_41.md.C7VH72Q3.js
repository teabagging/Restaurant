North Jersey!). My best friend and I would walk home from middle school every day and sometimes we'd stop by and grab a slice of freshly made Brooklyn style pizza with a wonderful thin, chewy crust and melting cheese. Thank you Cindy's for rekindling that part of my childhood!\\n\\nCindy's cheese pizza (no toppings) is simple and delicious. You can taste the acidity of the tomato and the lightness of the crust. While the cheese is probably a mozzarella blend instead of hand-pulled homemade mozzarella, it is the closest to a tristate style pizza I have found since coming to Boston. It's best to eat the entire pizza hot, but it is also delicious for a midnight snack. The slices don't feel heavy going down so take care to share and not eat the entire pie by yourself (like I have wanted to)! \\n\\nAlso good are their hot subs, which are extremely cheap for the amount of food and the QUALITY. They have an amazing steak and cheese sub as one Yelper already reviewed: no peppers or onions here, just simply thin sliced steak cooked with quality cheese, resulting in a wedding of melting cheesy goodness and juicy steak! So good! Also good is their cheeseburger sub (which comes with two patties!) and apparently their ham bomb (I never had it but my fiance really likes it). \\n\\nSince we literally live down the street, it takes some self control not to order from there all the time. One good deterrence is that it would be too lazy of me to try to get them to deliver to my door, a block away from their shop. Oh what a double edged sword! Also, the food is probably not too healthy to eat daily. \\n\\nPS - if you are really cheap and don't want to pay $10 for a quality pizza (and it is definitely worth the money), you can get coupons online.

Places such as Black's, Kreuz, Smitty's, Louie Mueller, ... I could go on.  And then you have Franklin.  Franklin Barbecue is by far my favorite barbecue joint.  Why? You ask.  How can it be better than places that have been doing it right for 50 years.  Simple. The meat is the most tender, smoky, flavorful, perfectly seasoned barbecue I've ever had.  The smoky brisket melts in your mouth, the succulent ribs fall off the bone, the natural casing of the sausage snaps as you take that first bite.  What more can I say ... it's barbecue nirvana. \\n\\nI'm typically not a fan of saucing up barbecue.  It should taste great and be juicy enough not to need it.  BUT ... the espresso sauce they serve here is amazing. It was so good I wanted to just start drinking it straight from the bottle.  It didn't have an overbearing coffee taste as you might expect but rather a rich, smoky, tangy complex flavor that perfectly complements the savory, fatty flavor of the meat. \\n\\nIf you don't know about Franklin barbecue, it started out as one of the hundred's of food trailer littering the streets of Austin before it made its way to the current brick and mortar location on 11th.  Its owned and operated by Aaron Franklin who, through his amazing attention to detail, all natural meat and family tradition of cooking barbecue, has accumulated one of the strongest and loyalist restaurant followings in Austin. One try of this barbecue and you'll know why. \\n\\nYou can't go wrong ordering from this menu, but there are definitely two things you absolutely must try ... the brisket and the pork ribs ... pork ribs and brisket ... and the pull pork sandwich. There are THREE things you absolutely must try the ribs, brisket, pork ... and the sausage links ... FOUR, there are four things you must absolutely try ... oh heck just bring your entire family and order as much food as you can because it sells out fast. \\n\\nOther odds and ends, they serve Dublin Dr. Pepper from the fountain and in a bottle.  The pies and tarts are definitely worth a try if you have room in your belly. \\n\\nBut there is a huge downside to this restaurant.  And that is it is a victim of its own success.  There is usually an hour long line to get in and they usually sell out pretty fast ... like within an hour and a half of opening.  They open at 11 AM and the line starts to form as early as 9 AM.

Merde.\\n\\nIt took me far too long to get over the initial shock over the lack of croque monsieur (I was SERIOUSLY craving one), although the Chimay Red I saw on the menu certainly helped. I ordered a chicken sandwich which was fair, but nothing craveworthy. Still, a solid sandwich and a good portion. Apparently the desserts are what shine here, so I'd of course be happy to return to sample a myriad of those. Service was okay but not exactly hospitable, it took a lot to get his attention. I must admit that the patio is quite lovely, even though it's in a strip mall.

Flavor out the wazoo and super moist. Falls to pieces. Delicious, delicious pieces.\\nLean brisket - top-notch flavor. It rivals Snow's circa 2010 and dominates Snow's circa 2011. However, it should be said that Snow's lean brisket is juicier and so moist that it falls apart as if it were fatty brisket. Franklin's lean brisket is a touch drier in comparison but not so much that I would call it dry.\\nPork ribs - nice black pepper rub reminiscent of Louis Mueller's in Taylor. Not the best thing at Franklin's but very nicely done.\\nPulled pork - the best I've had, although it should be said that I have not had a lot of good pulled pork as it's not really a Texas thing. On that note, one true BBQ aficionado actually told me not to bother with the pulled pork at Franklin's. My take would be to say that if you really know your pulled pork, it might not be that impressive. If you're a pulled pork amateur, it's pretty damn tasty.\\nSnausages - The one thing I would say to skip. The Germans out in Lockhart (Kreuz's, Smitty's, etc) do a better sausage.\\n\\nSides - who knows? Franklin's is a place for real BBQ not a Sunday picnic. If you want to waste valuable stomach space on sides and bread, go to Rudy's. \\n\\nFranklin's, keeps doing what you're doing and please don't try to expand further.

The fry level is just right (not too oily) and the wings are sizable. \\n\\nPorter burger - smaller than you would think, but still filling. Brie works well with the beef, not overly salted or peppered...you can tell it's quality beef. \\n\\nWater - tastes good. I know this is strange feedback, but I've been to enough places that serve bad water to make it worth mentioning. \\n\\nSnores dessert - most Smore's desserts are so intense you can't have more than two spoons.

Before farm-to-table, fusion everything, hyper-local sourcing, and fast-casual chainlets took over the city's dining landscape?

The space, service, and menu are a time capsule, a throwback to when tastes and demands were simpler and simultaneously more elevated, albeit in old-fashioned ways. Jake's could certainly be called old-fashioned - after all, there's nothing cutting-edge or genre-bending about the menu, techniques, or presentation - but there's something comforting about that, like going to your grandparents' favorite restaurant and knowing exactly what you're going to get. \\n\\nI work nearby and this is one of my go-to happy hour spots. I can't comment on dinner as I've never been, and I imagine my experience might be rather different if I splashed out on the full dinner spread and explored the full menu, but the happy hour is solid. The only drink special is the house wine, but it's a generous pour for a wildly reasonable price. The cheeseburger is a screaming deal at $5 for a classic, juicy burger and heaping helping of steak fries. The tempura ahi sushi roll is more of a sushi burrito, sizable and comforting in its warm, lightly battered and fried solidity. \\n\\nThe service is generally friendly and very competent. I love sitting in the bar, with all its dark wood paneling, creaky floorboards, and rickety tables.

The potstickers and fried roll were mediocre, but my two pals adored them, so no points docked. \\n\\nThe burger is a steal at $2.95 and comes with awesome steak fries and plenty of mayo and ketchup on the side to drench them in.

Sometimes there is so much flavor, that the two slices of bread on the bottom are great complements to eat with the meat. \\n\\nMAC & CHEESE SIDE\\nI didn't realize the sandwich came with a side, so I was put on the spot when our waitress Vanessa asked which side I wanted. I asked what she recommended, and she said the mac & cheese with brunswick stew on top was popular, so I followed her suggestion. SO SO SO GOOD. There are fairly large pieces of shell pasta in a really rich melted cheese sauce, topped with super flavorful brunswick stew. \\n\\nI also loved what they did with the space. Apparently earlier in the summer, a large tree fell on the building, so they tore down the walls and put a tent over the space to create outdoor dining. The day we went was PERFECT for eating outdoors. I'm just concerned about what will happen when winter comes. \\n\\nMy only qualm with the location is that parking is hard to find, so try to carpool if you can!"},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Be prepared to wait.

Grounds for Appeal, apparently! Located on the ground floor of the Law Society of BC (LSBC) building, you'll find yourself confused when you first walk in by the smell of curry, which I for one do not typically expect in a coffee shop. But alongside delicious lattes, they offer about 7 types of curry per day. The decor is decidedly 90s, but the space is very large and open and there are an impressive number of tables for casual meetings or working lunches. The biggest surprise for me was that it wasn't just full of lawyers in the building for LSBC business; the place is also patronized by people working in the neighbourhood and even Yaletown moms with their strollers.

We went there with a couple of friends who wanted to go, and even though I am on a strict diet for my upcoming wedding, it's really hard to turn down a cupcake when you've barely eaten all day. I suppose I'll make up for the calories today. Anyway.\\n\\nThe one missing star is because of the following minor issues: \\na) I've only eaten one cupcake there\\nb) you have to spend $3 to use a credit card so you can't buy just one cupcake if you don't have cash\\nc) holy crap $2.75 for a cupcake? Jesus. But you know, I practically had a religious moment when I ate it.\\nd) the selection leaves much to be desired (2 or 3 specialty cupcakes, other than that it's your basic chocolate and vanilla options for cake and frosting)\\n\\nIt wasn't busy when we went in (right before closing). They guy was nice, but I wish he would've told me I couldn't use my card for just one cupcake (I had it in my hand the whole time tapping it on the counter, because I am annoying like that), and there are no signs about the $3 minimum anywhere. The place is super cute and clean and everything is pretty straightforward. And again, the cupcake itself was absolutely out of this world. I couldn't make a cupcake like this at home if I tried for a week straight. The cake was SO heavy and moist. The strawberry flavor was genuine, no fake flavors here. I'd bet my life that they used real strawberries. The frosting gave me a boner. I'm getting another one just thinking about it!!! Real cream cheese and strawberries and god only knows what else. OH EM GEE. And it was HUGE. Not that I couldn't have eaten another (and another). I've heard from the friends that brought us there and other that the chocolate and vanilla flavors aren't that great, so honestly, I might never try them. But that Sweetberry is haunting my dreams.

The sweet potato tots I had on the side were strange. They look great on the outside but when you bite into them.. It's like little pieces of undercooked hash. Nasty. Would have been better if they just pur√©ed the sweet potato blend. I got the order in a to-go box because I didn't want to be rude. A different waiter gave me my check and it was just a copy of what I had and its total- not a regular ticket where you have the option to add gratuity.

I am NOT a coffee snob but seriously it needs to be better. The hot chocolate was so-so, very very sweet. Oh well, we were here for their food so we moved on quickly to two of their most famous dishes, CHICKEN AND WAFFLE and BISCUIT AND GRAVY. I am from Texas so Southern style food tastes like home to me. Overall, they have good food but it wasn't like the best that I've ever had. Started out with biscuit, great flaky kind, soft and fresh. Gravy excellent flavor with country style. It is very thick, which means it's authentic with lots of corn starch, fat, or butter some sort. The fried chicken was great!!! Excellent crispy breading outside, nice heavy flavor, and juicy and tender inside. To my memory, I can take a little bit stronger flavor. The grits was great!

I brought a co-worker to Brunch Haus for lunch today, despite the 43¬∞ temperature, to dine in the courtyard at the South Austin Social lot on Jesse St.  I had the grilled cheese and the stuffed French toast.\\n\\nThe grilled cheese came correct with smoked Havarti and Mozzarella with sliced ham between two slices of golden-grilled sourdough slathered with a very fresh-seeming basil pesto with what I believe was a Dijon mustard, either that or the pesto also included wine and honey because the notes came through in occasional bites to lend a delightful accent to the basil. \\n\\nThere were fresh greens thoughtfully integrated into the layers too. Not too many that would take away the classic, grilled cheesiness of the sandwich, but rather just a few, well-placed leaves that supplemented the tastefully-restrained carmelized onions.  Against these flavors, carmelized onions in excess could have really stolen the thunder from the Havarti and the pesto. But here, the very judicious portioning worked marvelously. I still caught the Havarti flavors dancing throughout the creamy mozzarella distinctly and the pesto's basil accents held a constant tone without being overbearing or distracting. \\n\\nI may be wrong but I strongly suspect that the crispy, golden and brown bread may have been spread with a mayonnaise instead of the more common butter because I feel that I caught the faint zest of the vinegar and lemon that it would have brought to the flavor profile. I whole-heartedly stand behind this practice if it is so. My wife first introduced me to the idea and immediately the good culinary results were obvious. \\n\\nThe plate came with a dollop of Sriracha which admittedly, I didn't use much of, but I can see how it's a fine option to spice up what might otherwise be a bland, white-cheese sandwhich. But here, I found that the strength of the Havarti and the pesto stood tall on their own. And accompanied by the greens, onions and very subtle ham in support, I felt that the sandwich could speak for itself quite soundly.\\n\\nNow, my co-worker also remarked on the French Toast on the menu and I had to ask about it. Hearing what the chef said, and seeing that he was actually in the process of plating and photographing one as we spoke, I ordered one as well. I am completely glad that I did. It was huge, to begin with. A generous portion worthy of the price. The Challah bread is a soft, fluffy, magnificent choice for a French Toast. The cardamom in the heavy cream is subtle and hides demurely amid the mascarpone filling.  The syrup is nice if unremarkable. And the plating included what I at first incredulously took to be a Pico-de-Gallo but was in-fact, a clever chopped strawberry-basil-mint salad that would be wrong to call a compote but is rather a light salad of fresh ingredients.

I did manage to hit the sweet spot though by combining the Pit Boss sauce with the Soulfire signature sauce. Doing this resulted in a sauce that I felt was more balanced in it's sweetness, spiciness, and tanginess.\\n\\nSurprisingly though, their BBQ isn't what stands out. What really shines at Soulfire is their fried chicken. This stuff is some if the best fried chicken I've ever eaten; it's perfectly seasoned, crispy on the outside, and juicy on the inside.

We were seated and then forgotten about for 20 minutes until I finally grabbed a server to come over and serve us. The server did not apologize for the wait, but I acted as though everything was normalWe we ordered the hot and spicy tuna dish, along with a few others which we always order when we come here. When the dish arrived I had a few bites and found that I couldn't eat it because it was too hot. My wife also felt the same way. We have always eaten this dish and it never had never been that hot to the point that it was unpalatable. I called over the server and told her the problem and she just kind of said, \\"oh\\", and walked away. I quickly flagged down another server who said he would go and speak to the cook. He came back shortly and told us the cook said everything was the same as always. Clearly this was not the case. He then went and grabbed a manager, who I told the same story to a third time. The manager then told us he would go and speak to the cook... Again. He left the food behind on the table. He soon returns and told us the same thing the server said before. Nothing has changed with the dish and there is nothing he can do. Again, I was absolutely taken aback. I asked the manager what he would do, and he said nothing. I told him I was not going to eat the dish. He said that was at my discretion but I would still have to pay for the food. I told him that I am unhappy with the food, so I would like to order something else. He told me that wasn't possible and that since I took a bite of food, I would have to pay for it. He told me that is the policy at Oyama. Words cannot explain how flabbergasted I was. The manager told us he could discount on our bill, but that was about it. I have NEVER, repeat NEVER been to a restaurant that treats their customers this way. I own my own business and it is unimaginable to me to tell a customer tough luck, too bad you did not like your purchase. with a policy such as this, and established limit like this should not exist. I will never patronize this restaurant again, nor will anyone I know. Typically, if a restaurant isn't very good, or the food doesn't taste great, I won't leave a review because it might hurt their business. In this case, I feel they do not deserve patronage from any customers until they change this incredibly cheap and pathetic rule which puts petty profits the heads of customer satisfaction."},{"name":"Sapporo Sushi Factory","address":"732 N State St","city":"Westerville","stars":"4","text":"Really good sushi.

I'm sure, like most of the rest of the cable-watching world, they would have rather been other places.\\n\\nA friend of mine and I actually won dinner for two at Sonsie thanks to a Kiss 108 contest. We were joined by a few other friends and, I must say, we had a fantastic time. \\n\\nAs I mentioned, the service was excellent. The manager and waiters were very friendly, accommodating and humorous, and the food was right on. We all shared various appetizers, entrees and desserts. \\n\\nMy favorites: I loved the eggless caesar salad to start. It had a nice, tangy caesar dressing that I mopped clean (I don't like dressing at all usually!). The oysters and flash fried calamari were accompanied by a spicy tomato sauce, the ingredients of which I can't precisely pinpoint, but it made for the perfect garnish. An entree that we affectionately dubbed \\"beefaroni\\" may have been my favorite item of the night. It wasn't at all so simple, but imagine a manicotti with beef and various cheeses baked in. The ultimate comfort food! I would come back just to get a plate of that. Then, of course, I had my baked lobster cheddar entree: A bed of whipped potatoes and sauteed mushrooms topped with a lobster tail and claws, and all baked with cheddar. My mouth is watering again just thinking about it...\\n\\nMy only complaint (really not much of a complaint at all) was that the pineapple napolean dessert I ordered wasn't as expected. I would have liked more pineapple in the pastry itself, rather than just on the side. Also, I found the cheesecake to be a bit on the mild side. Of the three desserts at our table, I'd have to say that the burgundy berry tart was definitely the best -- it was a miniature berry pie with a delicate, moist crust. Yummy!\\n\\nThe only other gripe (again, not much of a gripe) was the very odd artwork. It was made up of these sort of 50s era pieces with everything from giant images of candy hearts to a half naked woman having some fun with herself! I don't think I'd mind the subjects if they just didn't seem so out of place. The whole look didn't fit the restaurant's decor if you ask me...\\n\\nOverall, it was a great time, and would also be a fun place just to hang out at the bar -- which was pretty crowded most of the evening. I'll definitely be back for some of that \\"beefaroni.\\" :)"},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I've only been to Ramen Tatsu-Ya once, but I think about that day quite often.

There seems to be a common belief among patrons at popular restaurants in Austin, and that is to just be chill about having to wait in line - especially when the food is worth it.\\nFor an appetizer, I ordered the spicy edamame, which had just the right amount of kick. For my ramen, I ordered the Mi-So-Hot, which is spicy and has ground pork and veggies (in case you couldn't tell, I have a thing for spicy food).

Although I'm surrounded on all sides by Daredevil Dogs, Jailhouse Rock, and Loops, I hadn't been to the new Dirty Frank's, and every time I go to the original, it's impossible to get a table. Plus, my friend had never been to either.\\n\\nThe place itself isn't in the greatest area, and if you didn't know what you were looking for, you'd probably drive right on by and not give the location a second glance. I actually really love the fact that it's hidden in plain sight.\\n\\nThis space is much more spacious than the original and doesn't have nearly the amount of crowd, so it was super easy getting a table. Really, there was hardly anyone in there. The service was a bit slow, especially with refilling drinks. We ended up having to walk up to the bar in order to get our sodas refilled, so that was kind of annoying.\\n\\nDirty Frank's is really hit or miss for me, and I ended up picking some solid dogs: the Chicago, the Slappy Pappy, and the Dog From Hell. Slappy Pappy's Super Sloppy, or the SPSS (not to be confused with the software), was by far my favorite, and my buddy tried it as well and agreed. The other two dogs were pretty good as well. My friend had the Picnic Table, Razzle Dazzle, The Nicola, which is a Greek style hot dog. The Razzle Dazzle was his favorite, and he thought the other two were just okay. \\n\\nDirty Frank's puts out some good hot dogs, but to me, they're really just a Columbus staple more than anything. I don't think they have the best in town, especially with new places like Daredevil Dogs and Jailhouse Rock opened up, but they still have some great combinations you can't get anywhere else. If I'm in the area, I may head over for a quick bite, but there's just too many other great options near me to make the trip out to the Hilltop."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I love Ramen.

I traditionally avoid gas station food at all costs. It doesn't seem sanitary, fresh, etc. But Wawa has changed the game in that respect. They're dependable and that's what all their customers appreciate, and why we see other gas stations like Race Track fight to stay relevant and try to prove that they are AS GOOD as Wawas, which just isn't the case.\\nI do think that you could try to incorporate things like the froyo bar, like race track has.\\nI also wonder it would be smart to put most of the gas pumps on the back side of the wawa, to make the center of attention be that you guys have this awesome inside store with tasty food and beverages, because some people still feel weird about eating at a gas station."},{"name":"Masa","address":"439 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The food was delicious!

She was extremely knowledgeable of the menu (told us in detail what the dishes had and even down to the detail on how the kale leaves were massaged!). This is why I was disappointed when I went back the second time with my family and the food was less impressive. I ordered the fried chicken and my husband ordered the short rib.

We got there right in the nick of time apparently b/c a few minutes later, the line seemed neverending! I had no idea this place was so popular LOL! Aaanyway, we started off w/some oysters on the half shell. They had about 8 different kinds on the menu so we asked the server for advice. He suggested this 8 oyster combo that has 2 of their top 4 oysters. Great choice! I can't stress enough how fresh and delicious these were. For dinner, we decided to order the top 2 entrees that caught our eye and split them. I tried the macadamia nut crusted, mango infused halibut first. I love crunchy exteriors to certain foods and it gave a perfect texture to this dish. Upon the 1st crunchy bite, the mango infusion awakened my tastebuds. It was not overpowering at all. The fish was so moist! Little pieces of chopped mango were served on top as a garnish and it paired excellent with every bite. It was served w/ creamy garlic mashed potatoes and some steamed greenbeens and carrots. I now understand why that was the \\"chef's special\\" of the day. The other entree I had was the lobster tail... a whole one- as the dish came with two. There was so much meat!!! It was amazing and a must have if you're ever in the mood for fresh lobster. It came with roasted red potatoes, steamed greenbeens and carrots.\\nWe were seated in one of the wooden booths along the wall.

My party of four ordered crawfish, rockfish, crabcakes, halibut, and sturgeon, and none of these dishes were particularly great. Nothing was bad enough to send back, but I clearly felt that this place is more of a trap for tourists or people who are happy with meals that leave them stuffed to the gills and don't care so much about the food itself. The crawfish were perfectly fine as crawfish go (admittedly they aren't my favorite dish in the world--too much work for too little meat). Our main entrees though, each about 30 dollars, looked if they got about as much attention as a standard run of the mill chain seafood restaurant restaurant would give. This was particularly apparent when our dishes were brought out and each had the same dense, garlic mashed potato side, same tiny bit of green beans and shredded carrots, and same decorative bit of parsley. In other words, they couldn't be bothered to come up with side dishes that appropriately accommodate each of the fish dishes (that and I guess they could buy mashed potatoes, green beans, and shredded carrots in bulk). The fish dishes themselves were okay, but certainly not worth recommending.

We didn't eat, but the menu looked appealing and reasonably priced. With McCray's gone, this place looks to be trying hard to truly be a neighborhood bar - and so far, is succeeding. \\nFor an early hour on a Saturday, it had a good crowd - and I couldn't help but notice that 3 separate groups had at least 1 member that was a neighbor (I live next door @ Cornerstone), plus the bartender (who was very friendly).\\nI'm very excited to have this place and I hope they stay true to the neighborhood bar concept, because it is exactly what we need.\\n\\nThe large patio will be amazing once the weather gets nice.\\n\\nI'll go back.....frequently."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Expect for ramen tatsuya to have a bit of a wait.

I picture all of that swimming in a pile of delightful oil. To my credit, I was raised in Chicago, had a stint in NYC and currently reside in Seattle. I have zero experience with the South. So, when I was in Atlanta for a week, I struggled with the thought of eating like a true Southerner without coating my intestines with 5lbs of oil. To my surprise, there are so many trendy-Southern restaurants that gave me an even better culinary experience than I had imagined. South City Kitchen was one of them!\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is located in what seems to be a restored home. As a result, it has a layer of Southern charm that many other similar restaurants in the area lack. While it is intimate feeling, I by no means ever felt cramped within the restaurant. The service was wonderful, so no complaints there. After doing some pre-dinner Yelp perusing, I convinced myself that there was a complimentary bread basket with biscuits, cornbread, butter and jam. I must have been really craving something sweet, because when I asked for some jam upon receiving our bread basket, the waiter told me they did not have any. My saddened state quickly subsided once I devoured the biscuits and cornbread...delicious. A few minutes later, our waiter came back with a little bit of apple butter for me as that was the closest thing he could find to jam. I was so pleased that he went to look for something comparable in the kitchen!\\n\\nBased on the reviews of fellow Yelpers, my table split orders of the Fried Green Tomatoes, Garlic-Sauteed Collards, and Fingerling Potatoes. I enjoyed the Fried Green Tomatoes, but truthfully, the collards and potatoes stood out much more in my mind. Both were well-seasoned and incredibly savory. For dinner, I opted for the Crisped Wild Tennessee Catfish (when in Georgia!). The portion was HUGE (double as much as I could have devoured) and truly a bang-for-your-buck situation. It was battered and fried but done very well. No extra 5lbs of oil in my belly! The slaw and the tartar sauce both were a wonderful complement to the catfish. I ended my meal with the pecan pie, by request of the waiter, and was not disappointed. It was very sweet (note to those of you who do not like too much sugar), but I really loved it. I would suggest splitting the pecan pie with another person as it is quite sweet and a decent portion.\\n\\nOverall, South City Kitchen was a great experience for quality Southern food in a fine dining environment. I would highly suggest it if you want to enjoy a glass of wine with some friends and indulge in a memorable meal."},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Oh my...I don't what happened to this place, but their are roaches everywhere! :(...I used to eat here all the time as it has great options for vegetarians, but in last few months the couple times i've been i've seen roaches both times and the service from staff if LACKING!!

Would come backkk"},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Probably the best ramen you will get in the city of Austin. I went here on a Saturday with my husband (get there early because they are only open for dinner, from 5pm - 10pm, and there will be a line). I was one of the first in line so I can't really attest to how long the wait time is, but from my observation, it didn't seem too bad. Service was fine, on to the food quality.\\n\\nI ordered the tonkotsu ramen and my husband opted for the TANKotsu ramen special. Originally I had wanted the miso ramen (\\"miso hot\\" to be specific) but when I realized that came with ground pork and not the pork belly I opted not to get it. It wasn't too expensive -- if you just order the tonkatsu ramen straight up, it comes with pork belly, wood ear (?) mushrooms, green onions, ramen noodles, and an egg -- and comes to about eight or nine dollars if I remember correctly. However, any extra items you desire will cost you an extra fifty cents, and if you're like me, you want the bamboo shoots, pickled ginger, spicy pepper sauce, etc. and those can add up. (I regret not getting the brussels sprouts!) In the end we spent about $30 for two bowls of ramen, gyoza, and two drinks (a Sapporo for me and a Calpis water for my husband) which is not really that bad and I think worth the quality of the food we received. You can easily eat here cheaply if you just order the ramen and don't go crazy with the extra ingredients.\\n\\nI couldn't really tell if the gyoza was homemade or not (my husband concluded that it was, but it wasn't really anything special in my opinion, but not terrible either, just standard gyoza).\\n\\nOverall I would give my ramen a straight B rating. The pork belly was cooked to perfection. I can't really comment on the egg since I have never been a fan of the boiled egg in ramen.  It didn't affect my opinion of the ramen since I know this is a standard feature of many ramen dishes and my inability to eat anything other than a solid yolk is my own personal idiosyncrasy -- it is actually much harder to boil an egg without boiling the yolk solid so, no complaints there really. I mixed the yolk into the broth but my husband informed me that the \\"proper\\" way to eat the yolk is to mix it with the pork? Either way, I sort of wish I had put the egg aside in hindsight. The mushrooms and pickled ginger were easily my favorite part of the dish, and the garlic really added dimension to the broth. You get the whole cloves and a garlic press at your table, so the garlic is freshly pressed, but the downside to that is if you are weakling like me, it can be a real pain in the ass crushing the garlic through the press. Again, not really a failing of the restaurant. The broth was incredibly savory and delicious and if I hadn't gotten full so fast I definitely would've drank the entire bowl's worth of broth. Definitely a high point of the meal.\\n\\nAnyhow, I say the ramen is a B at best because the actual ramen noodles were lacking. I have had ramen before (at the Koraku in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles) and while I wasn't expecting the ramen I found in Texas to be up to that standard, I was expecting more out of the actual noodles. I was pretty disappointed and after reading the reviews on here I don't think I'm alone in this opinion. They were thin and didn't seem cooked enough... hopefully they can improve on the noodles in the future so I get a heartier bowl of ramen. \\n\\nAlso, a word on the atmosphere of the restaurant. It is pretty on the noisy side as you would expect from a restaurant that has a line out the door. The music is pretty loud but it didn't really bother me, I think the intention is to keep people from lingering too long after finishing their meal so they can get a pretty good turnaround (again, considering the line out the door). But anyway, if that affects your enjoyment of a meal, you might want to consider skipping out on this place. They don't do to-go orders.\\n\\nOverall I enjoyed my meal and I will most likely return in the future. This is my first Yelp review"},{"name":"La Moule","address":"2500 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The cocktails and wine were quite good.  The mussels were cooked properly.

No line on a Saturday night after dinner with friends, all seemed great. We went into the bar after bouncers checked all of our IDs and then grabbed some drinks. After about ten minutes of talking and enjoying the outside seating the bouncer came back and asked to see my ID again. I am used to this since I have an out of state ID, but normally a scan and occasionally (if the bar is skeptical and being cautious) a call into a system to validate the authenticity of the ID, I am in the clear. *This bar does NOT have a scanner* To operate in Boston without a scanner is ridiculous and having a novice management that allowed me into the bar in the first place if they were skeptical is absurd. I was with about fifteen people who were all at this bar because of me and they made me leave because of their own incompetence. Also, if my ID had in fact been fake, this bar would be in huge trouble for allowing in a minor and serving a minor in the first place and it makes me wonder how many people before me who's IDs were actually fake made it in. \\n\\nFor me to go back to this bar the management and the training of the bouncers would have to change drastically. Personally I feel like this place should be under investigation for their incompetence when it comes to serving under age and identifying fake IDs. \\n\\n*this review is coming from a bartender of 2 years who has taken multiple training sessions which have included how to identify a fake ID*"},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing.

We were the first ones there for lunch, but it looks like it can fill up quickly. The food was GREAT. I ordered chirashi, and fresh sashimi is something you cannot fake so I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. My husband ordered 2 rolls and a hand roll special, all of which had unique flavor and touches like sesame soy paper wrap. Each dish came with a clear soup beforehand with some tempura onion.

Milestone has a really nice racket going on; they don't have to be that good because people are willing to pay through the nose for very mediocre food if it's served in a beautiful atmosphere. Well done on the marketing scheme, whomever created this place! I'll break this down start to finish. I say \\"pay through the nose\\", but the prices really aren't exorbitant. The thing that makes them exorbitant is how mediocre the food is. I'll probably use the word \\"mediocre\\" several times. I apologize in advance.\\n\\nStrike one was the less than friendly host staff. I've never understood this mentality of being cold when you're the first impression. Strike two: the bar staff was extremely unfriendly. They seemed pretty busy, but that's no excuse for treating customers paying $9.00 for (weak but tasty) pre-dinner drinks with a bad attitude. I'm not one to typically complain about the strength of cocktails, but I also don't usually need to complain about the strength of a $9.00 cocktail. It was a birthday celebration and I had a designated driver-- a rare occasion for me, so I wanted to take advantage. In my usual experience, three cocktails that have champagne and two kinds of liquor would get me pretty tipsy. I had three of these drinks and felt perfectly fine. I'm not going to say that I drink a nice cocktail just to get drunk, but I wasn't spending $9.00 per drink for my health, ya know?\\n\\nThe four of us split the bacon shrimp appetizer. I think it was between $9.00 and $10.00 for four shrimp. They were a little overcooked, but pretty tasty. Too spicy for my taste, but I've said a dozen times that I'm a spice wimp. The biscuits and mac and cheese appetizers looked like more bang for the buck. I did see another table with some sort of appetizer that actually came out in a Chinese food take out box with chopsticks. I almost laughed out loud at this. It's really as though the people who created this restaurant had no clue how to create an original dining experience.\\n\\nI ordered the salmon special. It had sweet-glazed carrots and onion, a Thai chili butter sauce, some sort of microgreen/sprout and sticky rice. I ordered my salmon rare, which it was not...not even close. The rice was overcooked, but still one of the highlights of my meal. The sweet carrots and onions were also delicious. There didn't seem to be a Thai chili lime butter anywhere to be found, there was definitely no spice or kick to the dish. The salmon lacked depth and flavor, and the texture was less than pleasant. It was pretty dried out, which was really disappointing.\\n\\nTwo of my dinner companions really loved their food (including one person who got the salmon). When I voiced my lackluster feelings, they told me I had high standards....However! My boyfriend was equally disappointed with the steak he ordered, and he is a lot easier to please than am I when it comes to seafood. It was a tiny portion and it was charred to death. It hardly even looked like a steak. I suppose the $22.00 steak is less than this meal would be at most places, but we agreed that we would rather pay the extra $8.00-$10.00 more for a better tasting meal.\\n\\nThe highlight of the meal was definitely the dessert. We did the chocolate cake with ice cream instead of milk and the banana pudding. I'm not a banana pudding fan, so I'll reserve my judgment, but the chocolate cake was pretty damn good. It was a huge piece and easily big enough for 3-4 people. \\n\\nOur server was attentive and helpful, but not at all friendly. Maybe he trained in Germany?  As long as you're offering drinks and refilling my water, I'm more or less pleased, but it's always nice to have a friendly smile, no?\\n\\nWould I come here again? Yes. Would I eat an entree here? No. Absolutely not. I would come here for happy hour--drinks, appetizers and dessert. Unfortunately, people are going to continue to pay for mediocre food and look past how \\"meh\\" the food is because of the location and views, and because of that, they will never fix their menu or food.

My boyfriend enjoyed it very much, I would have rather gone for the fried gree tomatoes , but we had already had that the night before at another restaurant.\\n\\nFor our dinner choices I chose the fried chicken and my boyfriend chose the hanger steak.  Our waitress made a mistake with the order so we had to wait longer for our food but she was very apologetic and the manager comped the second round of drinks on the house which was very nice.\\n\\nThe reason I only gave the restaurant three stars is because I was expecting crazy things to happen in my mouth with the fried chicken.  The waitress said it was the most popular dish and that everyone loved it.  We are in the south after all so I was expecting an explosion of flavor in my mouth.  It was just ok. I mean it was cooked correctly.  The chicken was moist.  There was nothing wrong with it, but I wanted some magic.  Maybe it's just me.\\n\\nMy boyfriend had the hanger steak and I tried some of that and it was really tasty and full of flavor.  I would definitely order that over the fried chicken next time. For dessert we shared the pecan pie with ice cream and that was really nice.  I think if I had ordered something other than the fried chicken this rating would be four stars for me.  Overall though the staff were friendly, they were super apologetic about their mistake, and it was a very cozy place."},{"name":"Wink & Nod","address":"3 Appleton St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My bf and I found Wink and Nod on open table after deciding we wanted to go to the South End for dinner. We loved the atmosphere. It was dark and cosy with a deep set bar area and dimly lit tables. Although a bit dark at first (on a sunny spring day) we quickly got used to it and settled into the comfortable arm chairs at our table. It was described as a speakeasy theme, but due to Pride Week, they were playing 80's music which was fine by me! The menu is a bit limited, but we enjoyed everything we ordered including the duck fat fries, the kale salad and the brussel sprouts. My bf had the duck ramen, which could have used some more flavor. I had the chicken and pork fat dish which was tasty. I enjoyed my cocktail the Ivana. My bf had the Jennifer. His second drink was the bartenders choice and it was even better than the first. We wished we had more opportunity to try out some more of their drinks as it seems that is their specialty. I appreciate the fact that Wink and Nod must have read other Yelp reviews and is trying very hard to fix any issues with slow service.

We both ordered drinks, something with 'Rita in it.  \\n\\nThe pulled pork was dry, and it looked like they simply slathered some BBQ sauce on it.  Hello, just because you put BBQ sauce on a piece of meat does *not* make it BBQ.  From the BBQ I've had in the past, the meat is marinated and slowly cooked so as to lock in the flavor.  Mac 'n cheese was bland.  How do you make mac 'n cheese bland?  I don't know, but this place managed to do it.  The drinks were watered down, and the coleslaw was so-so.  I don't know if they made my friend's food before mine, but when hers arrived with mine, it was cold.  \\n\\nNot sure how this place gets such great reviews, but I wasn't impressed."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I went to Alden & Harlow shortly after it opened and had a great experience. The restaurant can be difficult to find -- it is underground and has some subtle signage pointing to a staircase. It was very dark inside, but I really liked how the restaurant looked and felt. It was simultaneously cozy and modern, with a huge wraparound bar, open kitchen and exposed ceiling.\\n\\nThe menu at Alden & Harlow is based around creative small plates made with local ingredients. They recommend 2-3 plates per person, so our party of five shared 12. We started with some drinks -- beers all around despite a nice cocktail menu. With our drinks we were brought a plate of pickled green beans. I actually loved them and was happy to have gotten the beans versus bread.\\n\\nThe food started rolling out FAST! I was actually shocked at how quickly our first round of plates arrived. In the first round we ordered:\\n\\n- Salt cod & turnip brandade, chick pea, fennel cracker, pickled mustard seeds.\\n- Washington state mushrooms, 60 egg, pine nut crumble.\\n- Pickled Verrill Farm corn pancakes, buttermilk, maple, shishito peppers, topped with popcorn.\\n- Scallop crudo, cauliflower kimchee, chili oil, uni aioli.\\n- Chicken fried local rabbit, celery, apple, blue cheese, chili oil\\n\\nMy favorites in the first round were the scallop crudo and the mushrooms. The mushrooms were a hit all around, and I may have been scooping up the mushroom puree at the bottom of the bowl with a spoon.\\n\\nThe second round came out quickly after we finished our first plates. Honestly, I would have liked a longer break or for the food to have been broken up into more rounds. Here's what we ordered:\\n\\n- House made rye pasta, confit chicken thigh, crispy skin, fig and liver butter.\\n- Island Creek oyster gratin, uni toast, creamed leeks & guanciale.\\n- Crispy Berkshire pork belly, Anson Mills grits, roasted kumquat, bergamot cure.\\n- Seared Hudson Valley foie gras, spiced fruit, sherry vinegar, warm crumpet.\\n\\nMy favorite during this round was the gratin, but the pasta and the foie gras were close seconds!\\n\\nFor our last round of food, we ordered:\\n\\n- Creekstone Farms New York strip, marrow, fennel, blood orange (one 8 oz and one 16 oz).\\n- Grilled lamb sirloin, cocoa rub, grilled carrot mash, ramp puree.\\n\\nI was a big fan of both of these dishes. I especially liked scooping the marrow onto the bread, adding a piece of steak, and topping it with some blood orange.\\n\\nEven though we were all stuffed, we couldn't leave without trying dessert. We ordered the smoked chocolate bread pudding with Jacobsen salt ice cream. This was super delicious and a great way to end the meal. The smokey flavor almost made it taste like there was bacon mixed in!\\n\\nOverall I really enjoyed dinner at Alden & Harlow. I'm so glad I got to experience the restaurant in a group so that we could taste a large portion of the menu. It seems like we ordered a ton of food (and we did), but I think it was an appropriate number of plates for the group."},{"name":"Nelore Churrascaria","address":"115 E Lyman Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"We have been to other brazilian steak houses both in Boston and Las Vegas, which have been spectacular! This one ,,,was just ok. We had a groupon, for which we thought it was dinner for 2, It was NOT, you paid 25 for 50 TOWARDS your meal. No where was the price listed. The menu you got was only a wine list. Speaking of wine, a glass of sangria was 14??? and a pitcher was 30? wayyyy out of proportion price wise,,,hubby and I got the pitcher and didnt even get a buzz...so you know it was basically grape juice with fruit. Then the salad bar was just weird. lettuce, tomatoes and odd things like asparagus, etc...not a normal salad bar. Rice was tasty. Got nice hot rolls that were exceptionally good, but had to ask for butter and waitress never came back with it. Reminded her again that we didnt get our butter, By then the rolls were cold .Pork ribs were inedible. Sirloin was good. Filet Mignon was wrapped in bacon, great concept but was well done instead of at least medium.. Got creme brulee for dessert (to share) again NO price on menu...anyhow, they put the creme brulee on a warm plate,,but put Whipped Cream on warm plate,,,helloooooo,,,if you put cold whipped cream on a warm plate, it melts!!!  .

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I must admit my review may be a bit dated since the last time I went here was over a month ago. \\nAs much as I want to attempt to prove that I am a barbecue know-it-all, it just isn't so but I can only offer my humble opinion of the place. Fox Bros is possibly the best barbecue you'll have in Atlanta. A bold statement with many places such as Daddy DZ and Fat Matt's but I've been to all and Fox Bros still holds the winning spot in my heart. Does that mean not to try the other two places if you're a barbecue fanatic? Not at all, if you have the time and money I'd definitely try those two out but I offer my fat-kid endorsement here.\\nUnfortunately, the bump from five-star food to four star is due to almost ALWAYS impossible parking and long waits. They're located in a strange place, a little off of residential Candler Park it's a bit difficult to find a decent parking spot since their lot only fits about 8 or 9 cars, 10 if you're really stubborn. Similarly, it is almost nearly always packed. If it's a nice day outside and a weekend, forget it. There were several times I went on a gorgeous Sunday and it was at least an hour or so wait. But if you're DYING for that barbecue and are willing to wait (some days I wouldn't blame you) read onward.\\nGet their ribs. I'm a sucker for ribs, and there's nothing shameful about my neanderthal manner where I nearly face plant into the plate as it comes out. Their ribs here are good. If you're looking for something a bit cheaper, I would settle on their pulled pork. They always tend to do an excellent job with their pork. Their sides are plenty and you really can't go wrong with any of their choices. They're all good, and probably cooked in bacon. This is about where the review ends. Should you go? Yeah give it a shot. It's a bit pricey but if you want to try some of the best barbecue that I've had feel free.\\n\\nP.S.A.\\nNow, after visiting several restaurants and speaking with General Managers I've come to have a love-hate relationship with my Yelp and I'm writing it on this review because there's a lot of animosity for people in the restaurant industry. That when we walk in we have the right to a seat immediately, that if we don't get a seat we're not getting good service. Unfortunately, Fox Bros has this problem but in my honest opinion, if you demand a seat right away you are cutting into someone ELSE'S dining experience as well. I've always been courteous about waiting and I hope for the love of all human kind you do the same.

There was 6 of us, and 4 had arrived earlier - so they had a table outside.  I was about 15 minutes later than them and as I arrived they were getting their drinks.  They had waited a long time but it seemed busy so we weren't too upset about it. \\n\\nI ordered a drink which was a beermosa.  It was actually very delicious.  They took a very long time to bring it back so I only ended up havign 1 drink through brunch when I would typically have 3.  I think their service is a big indicator of their sales because they would have made an extra 100.00 at least on our table had they been more prompt on getting drinks for us. \\n\\nMy friend ordered the oatmeal and asked which fruit came with it and they had said strawberries and blueberries.  This was not the case as it came with honey dew melon and canteloup.  She just didn't like those fruit and was going to ask to switch to something else but the waitress took 15 minutes to come back and by that time, we had already all just about finished eating.\\n\\nI had the burger of the day which had a pesto, buffalo mozzarella, basil, red peppers and eggplant.  It was decently tasting but the eggplant was very thick which is just not my personal preference on it.\\n\\nI most likely will not be back as there are so many restaurants in the area and when that is the case, the service should be much better.  We tried to bring it to the attention of the manager but he didnt seem phased by it."},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Just a short walk from the Universal park entrances, Cowfish is a nice spot for a quirky meal, especially for groups with varied palettes. While nothing we had there is mind blowing, it's far superior to trying to wade through the black hole of amusement park stands for an overcooked burger. \\n\\nMy girlfriend and I went on a Friday night and were seated almost immediately (albeit right on the cusp of spring break season). The restaurant's theme is quirky, with an open air kitchen and full sushi bar serving as a backdrop to a colorful mishmash of furniture and tv screens with swimming fish that is supposedly a kids game of some sort. \\n\\nI got the 'spicy' tuna poke dip, which in reality had very little heat and was much smaller than expected compared to the amount of wonton chips we received (odd food ratios are a bit of a theme here). The dip was a bit on the bland side, which was very strange given what traditionally goes into poke; a drizzle of the tableside siracha bottle improved the flavor significantly.\\n\\nFor entr√©es, we ordered a CBCLT burger and a Fusion Bento. The burger came with white cheddar cheese, onion jam, and the specialty Cowfish sauce. The burger was well seasoned and the toppings were all tasty. The only issue is my girlfriend ordered it medium, and it came out much closer to medium well or well done. The accompanying fries were good, but nothing special.\\n\\nThe fusion bento is one of their signature items; a slider, 3-4 pieces of sushi (I got a mix of 3 nigiri with mine), Thai cucumber salad, sweet potato fries, and edamame. The biggest problem with the dish is ratios; there are more fries and edamame individually than there are sushi and burger combined. Part of the problem is the near-inedibility of the edamame; I don't know a whole lot about the dish, but I suspect these were undercooked. In any case, a restaurant that bills itself as burger/sushi fusion needs to have more than 1/4 of one of its fusion options actually be burgers and/or sushi. The burger and sushi were all good (I'm a sucker for good nigiri), and the cucumber salad was decent, but ended up being very one note (sweet) and needed acid (I probably should've had more than 1 tiny slice of red onion in mine). The sweet potato fries were nice and crispy. If the dish had halved the amount of edamame and fries (the presentation seemed as though it wanted to present them as equals from different cuisines) and replaced them with a different variety of slider or a couple more pieces of sushi, it could've been a real standout.\\n\\nCowfish ultimately struggles to live up to the lofty goal of seamlessly fusing burgers and sushi, but it's still a pretty good dinner spot for a party with different tastes. The burger and sushi offerings are both good individually, and while I would never order them they also have some crazy sounding 'sushi' like a steak and lobster roll that could be worth a look. Just avoid the bento."},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Love this place food was great Barton Beers are awesome.

I don't live here and I wasn't bringing it home to my house - don't be cheap on simple niceties.  Or charge extra for take-away.\\n\\nAs for the food, I really don't know where to start.  It was really bad.  I opened the quarter chicken, and it was served between 2 pieces of white bread.  By the time I got back to my hotel room, the chicken was adhering to the bread - nothing beats soggy bread attached to rubbery-skinned, overcooked, bone-dry chicken.  The bbq sauce, which tasted like equal parts ketchup, mustard, vinegar and hot sauce was not doing the trick.  I took one bite and moved on to the ribs.  When I opened the paper with the ribs, I nearly vomited from the sight.  I was not amused by the thick layer of gelatinous silver skin dangling from the ribs.  They tasted and looked like boiled ribs.  Even boiled ribs can be masked by marking them off on the grill and basting with bbq sauce - these were gray flabby, fatty, ribs.  They fell off the bone in a really bad way.  Absolutely gnarly.\\n\\nThe rum beans were beans doused in their bbq sauce, with a very strange taste - bitter almost.  Mac n cheese, was greasy, flavorless and tasted only of pepper.  The only thing I would eat again from here was the brunswick stew - I haven't had too many variations of this stew, but it was tasty - nice consistency, good meaty flavor - not too sour - good balance.\\n\\nI really hate to give one star reviews, but this food was downright inedible."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Came to Portland on vacation (plan on moving to Portland soon) everywhere I looked people recommended this restaurant.

Friendly staff and full dining room, humming audibly (and happily) but not at all unpleasantly loud, make for a welcoming experience. \\n\\nI ordered a Blood And Sand (not on the menu, but they obliged) while my companion ordered a Bitter Truth. My Blood And Sand was good, but not really up to snuff. The Bitter Truth, though, was fabulous, so I guess the lesson is to choose from the small but interesting list of drinks they've created and you'll be happy. \\n\\nWe were also delivered an amuse bouche, a lightly pickled, and wonderfully fresh, little dish of green beans with a sprinkle of white sesame seeds on top. It was a brisk and bright way to start the meal and get ourselves ready to eat. \\n\\nAs for dinner, we picked the Chicken Hearts, Smoked Arctic Char, and Grilled Asparagus, all of which were fabulous. The Chicken Hearts where crispy but tender, grilled 4 to a skewer (2 skewers total) with crispy chicken skin sprinkled on top, sitting in, I think, a garlic aioli, or something similar. Fabulous. \\n\\nThe asparagus is done in the style of Caesar salad. The asparagus itself was grilled and garlicky, sitting on top of a thick slice or grilled garlic sourdough, covered in a mind blowing Caesar dressing made from a 60-degree egg. I can't ever eat a regular Caesar salad again without being disappointed after this. \\n\\nThe Smoked Arctic Char was served chilled, prepared very much like a rillette, atop a sweet and dense brown bread, accompanied by honey roasted carrots and apples. This surprised me by immediately reminding me of the traditional colonial New England flavor profile. The char was light in texture, but substantial  Smokey, but still full of oceany wonderfulness on its own, and the bread was rustic and heavy providing the perfect backbone to just pick up and go. \\n\\nTo finish up, we had the Smoked Chocolate Bread Pudding with Sea Salt Ice Cream. Everything tasted exactly as the name on the menu implied. It's such a wonderfully simple dessert after a fascinating meal, and so wonderfully dense and satisfying. There's not much else to say bout it, as the flavors are exactly what they claim to be, it just happens to work perfectly. \\n\\nAll in all, we had a wonderful meal and a lovely time.

Don't get me wrong, I love my parents; my mother is a blast anytime there's happy hour involved, but I thank the baby Jesus that I didn't have a guy spending the night the night before and that I actually was wearing boxers to bed... But, I digress... \\n\\nAnyway... now I had the task of finding a place to eat where my parents (who wouldn't be considered picky eaters per se, but are definitely set in their ways when it comes to food) and myself (who really would eat anything) would both enjoy what was served. \\n\\nMy first inclination was Kerbey Lane. (I know cliche to the max, but it's definitely a safe bet). However when we got there at 10am on a Saturday, there was already an hour wait. Jesus. Christ. \\n\\nNow I was out of safe options. And my parents love tex-mex, they love tacos, but they like Fonda San Miguel Tex-Mex. Not East Austin Tex-Mex... (I took them once to East Austin to get tacos and my mother said that she felt unsafe.) (ROLLS EYES) Oh, my mother. So the myriad of amazing options on the East Side were out of play.\\n\\nWHERE COULD I GO? \\n\\nThank God I remembered this place. Just a short jaunt from the crazily overcrowded Kerbey Lane stands Tacodeli, situated in a part of town that my mother would categorize as decidedly \\"safe,\\" complete with its neighboring Ferrari dealership and Central Market. \\n\\nWe walked in and the place was packed, but the workers were to my amazement, incredibly efficient. We ordered in no time, found a place to sit, and the food came out shortly thereafter. \\n\\nI could finally breathe. My parents were eating, both liked their tacos, and for the first time in about an hour there was a zen felt between the nuclear family. All was right in the world. \\n\\nAnd those tacos, let's chat about those tacos. I loved my brisket taco and that taco with the fried queso blanco with avocado. I don't remember its name, but it was sure a winner. Plus they had this decidedly non-Hispanic, yet very delicious green creamy hot sauce that the entire family enjoyed. That deserves a star right there.\\n\\nDefinitely going to hit this place up when I'm not accompanied by the rents. Thank you, Tacodeli, for preventing an uncomfortable morning, and pleasing my parents.

I can't underscore how bad it was. Two friends of mine and I stopped by for a bottle of wine and an appetizer or two. When we sat down, the patio was pretty empty (though, it did end up getting a little busier into the evening). The restaurant was out of the bottle we wanted (totally fine), so our server offered us a tasting of another bottle (very nice to offer). So far, so good. We ordered hummus as our first app, thinking it would be quick. 35 minutes into this, our server brings out the bottle. She presented it to us, paused, turned around to serve the table behind us *their* drinks, and THEN deigned to uncork our bottle and pour our glasses. Ok, honestly, this was a little annoying but I'd be willing to give her the benefit of the doubt and chalk this up to her having a bad day. I now have my wine and am satisfied for the moment... Until she asks us if we want anything to eat. To which my friend politely reminded her of the order we placed now over 40 minutes ago. For HUMMUS. I mean, really? How difficult is it to place a 1/2 cup of hummus, 6 carrot sticks and 6 celery sticks on a plate?  (What a sad portion of food.)

The location itself was nice but once the service started we realized that this place was not going to meet our expectations.  \\n\\nThe person serving our water appeared to be a homeless guy who was given a shot at serving in this restaurant.  His shirt was ripped and he did not communicate to us at all.  After five minutes of waiting, we asked him who was our waiter.  He informed us that he was.  Surprising. He then asked us what he wanted. No discussion of the menu or what this has to place offer. I could have gotten better feedback at Ana's.  \\n\\nThe food when it came was overcooked and way too spicy. This is not a question of having a low tolerance for spicy food but rather a sense that they just threw the seasoning onto the food without measure or care.  I must admit, though, the onion rings were great.\\n\\n While we waited we could overhear the customers around us lamenting the poor service. Drinks were missing and any hope of getting a detailed explanation of the menu was dashed. \\n\\nFor instance, when we asked about the dessert, he just asked rather abruptly...what about the dessert?

Thanks!"},{"name":"Buttermilk & Bourbon","address":"160 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"What a fabulous dining experience!  I'm a big fan of tapas, as I really like trying different things, and small plates definitely affords diners that opportunity.  \\n\\nThere was a bit of an issue with their online reservation system, so we called, and they were having the same problem.  The earliest seating they had was 5:45pm on a Sunday, and when we arrived, we were the first one's seated in the French Quarter dinning area.  Certainly not an issue, it's just a little awkward being the only ones in a particular space!  \\n\\nWaitress came over promptly, poured some water, and gave us a few with the menu.  We had looked at the menu ahead of time, so were ready to order fairly quickly.  One of the waiters noticed we were ready to order, so flagged our waitress to stop by.  Never heard the phrase before, but liked/appreciated it... \\"shotgun service\\", meaning, the food will be brought out as it's prepared/ready, as opposed to all at once (particularly good for tapas).  \\n\\nHere comes the food!  With an early dinner seating, food was made fresh & quick!  Started with the Red Apple Wedge Salad; everything was great, perfect amount of accouterments (bacon, super tasty blue cheese, dressing).  The highlight of the meal for me was the honey biscuits with pub cheese and sweet cinnamon butter.   Four biscuits come in a serving, I'd love to see them offer a 2 biscuit plate for a little bit less.  While I LOVED them, they are on the heavier side, and so finishing it meant I couldn't eat as much of the other entrees!  This is a must-order item though, seriously!  The Gouda Mac & Cheese was alright, my wife reminisced about growing up with frito-pie (similar recipe), something I never had.  Personal preference, I just didn't love the cheetos on top, and $13 was a little pricey for a side of mac & cheese.  Our second favorite dish was the Confit Berkshire Pork Belly Cracklings.  This dish isn't for everyone, but I'm the target audience for sure!  Cooked to perfection, crispy in some places, chewy in others, and the sauce was delectable.  We had ordered fried chicken thighs as well, but that entree order was misplaced (to our benefit, as we were soooo full at that point).  We mentioned to our waitress, she apologized for the mix-up, the manager stopped by and said he'd prepare us one to go and comp the entree order.  Perfect response!\\n\\nLocation/Ambiance - A stone's throw from Newbury street, there's no parking in the immediate area, so you'll be walking a few blocks (more of an FYI for travel planning!).  The restaurant is in the basement of a building, so you can't tell it's there unless you're looking for it (which is too bad, far less likely to get foot-traffic).  The ambiance itself is styled after New Orleans, and each space has a distinct feel.  We were seated in the French Quarter, which was a bit minimalist for my style, but my wife liked it.  The walls were white-washed, the tables were reclaimed wood, and there were chandeliers, no real other decoration.  Some of the other spaces had more life to them, if you're just going for drinks.  \\n\\nService - Our waitress was very friendly, as was the other staff that helped during the course of the meal.  There were times we didn't see our waitress for a bit (to refill water, etc.), but not terribly long.  The hostess greeted us when we walked in, and gave us a quick overview of the restaurant layout (different rooms) while being seated, very friendly/welcoming.\\n\\nQuantity - For tapas, the portion sizes were good.  \\n\\nQuality - High praise for the quality of every dish we had!\\n\\nValue - Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised at the bill (a rarity!).  Each of the dishes were reasonably priced.  As mentioned above, I loved the biscuits and will order when I go back, it would be nice if they offered a smaller portion for a little less, to save room for other entrees.  And I think the mac & cheese is a tad expensive, but not unreasonable.  \\n\\nOverall - I just stumbled across the restaurant online, and it was a great find in my opinion.  Terrific value for the quality & quantity, the dishes that weren't a perfect match for us really is about personal preference only.  We'll definitely be going back again to enjoy their great food & service!"},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I just dined at South City Kitchen last week for a business function and I am already making plans to go back this weekend with friends!\\n\\nThe food was great -- the best way to describe it would be down-home-southern-cooking-chic.

I expected a very long wait because throughout the weekend, the wait to many restaurants I visited were at least 30 minutes to over an house which may be typical in Austin. Walking up to Ramen Tatsu-Ya, I already noticed a line outside the restaurant which was slightly intimidating but my party of three waiting patiently. I did notice that the line moved fairly quickly and that there was a staff member actually organizing the number of people who could go inside. I thought this was a great idea because it keeps congestion inside of the restaurant to a minimum and helps overall ambiance. I really do think that ambiance is an important factor when dining. Anyway, we stood in line in front of the doors of the USPS next door and waited about 20 minutes before being allowed in. Once inside, we were given a number and told where to sit, which is fine but I did wish I had a choice to sit. I probably could have asked for a specific table but I didn't want to be complicated. When you approach the counter the first thing you will do is choose a drink and they've got a variety of drinks from Japanese alcohol and non-alcohol liquids to domestic alcohol and your normal American drinks. With your drink in hand, you order your actual food which was simple enough. They have a few ramen options and is customizable to your preference so feel free to add that second ajitama (soft boiled egg) or even Brussel sprouts. The Ol' Skool ramen was my favorite in my opinion because the broth was very flavorful, not too salty but enough where you can even finish it off. The Tonkotsu and Tonkotsu Sho-yu were also good but I felt the Sho-Yu was a tad too salty for me. I will say that the Cashu (marinated braised pork belly) was excellent! The meat was very tender and oh so flavorful. Presentation of the ramen was adequate. I know it sounds snotty but the Japanese pride themselves in presentation of their dishes so I always end up critiquing how a ramen dish is presented to me. The major gripe I had was that the soft boiled egg wasn't really soft boiled because the yolk was fully cooked and hard. I expect my yolk to be running when I have ramen.\\n\\nRamen Tatsu-Ya is a good ramen place and I really wish the Kansas City area had one like it.

Still tasted great.  My in-laws also complained that their burgers were rather tepid as well which took away from their enjoyment.  And the biggest problem was that my husband's burger inexplicably took another 8 minutes to arrive at the table.  We flagged down the server about 60 seconds after it was first missing and she looked completely baffled and went to find out what was wrong.  Finally came back out a minute later and said it would be another 5 minutes or so.  Obviously, she forgot to place the order.  It finally came and was not hot.  How is that even possible???  It should have come right off the grill and over to our table and been piping.\\n\\nAnyway, the chicken nuggets are to die for delicious and the onion rings are the shoestring kind and very salty which I happen to love.

The rice should, above all else, be fresh.  I've been to Oishi twice (wanted to give them a second chance) and both times the rice was not fresh.  It was dry and even a little crunchy in a couple pieces of nigiri.  Overall the rice was inconsistent even from piece to piece but rarely did the quality vary to the good end of the scale.  \\n\\nThe tuna was not very fresh.  Of course you can't actually get \\"fresh\\" tuna in Vancouver, WA and it will all be previously frozen but even accounting for that this was sub-standard for the area.  Also the Tuna had colouring added to it to make it look better.  \\n\\nSome rolls list \\"crab\\" as an ingredient but this is not accurate.  \\"Crab\\" and \\"crab salad\\" are two VERY different things.  Even if you forgive using the 'fake' crab as an ingredient, which is very common today due to costs, this does not mean substituting crab salad is acceptable  Please fix your menu to reflect this.  This made me quite angry as it completely changes the character of the roll. Also it may be an issue for someone with allergies.  This is not ok. \\n\\nBoth times the wait staff has rushed me.  I like to sit and take my time with my sushi and order rolls only after I've had nigiri.  I made this clear to the staff both times and both time I had barely started my nigiri and they were back asking if I wanted anything else.  At the end they brought the check even before I had finished my food which I view as terribly rude.  \\n\\nI honestly think Oishi tries to provide a quality sushi experience but they have a fair bit of distance to go before they do.  Until then, I will not be revisiting them."},{"name":"Wink & Nod","address":"3 Appleton St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I have been to Wink & Nod a few times now and I can now say I am totally unimpressed with this place. It feels like it is trying too hard and the drinks are incredibly overpriced. I have ordered a few different cocktails and they were just okay- I wasn't blown away by any of them except for when I saw the prices on the menu. This is the type of bar where you are definitely going to pay for the environment and the food & drink are secondary. I also find the service here to be pretty sub par, servers and bartenders are inattentive in my experience.

Perfectly done, golden brown and yummy. \\nThe corndog is different than most. Actually most places just flash fry boxed corndogs. This place has it's own secret batter.

The eggplant and egg is another favorite, which has an absolutely killer sauce.  And I really do not understand how they get the brussels sprout sandwich to taste so good without bacon!  It's awesome.  If you don't want bread, you can order most of the sandwiches as a \\"platter,\\" which means all the sandwich fillings laid out in a container + 2 little side salads.

Well, we were not expecting double soft tortillas (we were not asked if we wanted hard or soft) that were virtually impossible to pick up and eat due to how soggy they were.  After scraping the lettuce and tomatoes off my son's tacos (again not asked if we wanted the \\"extras\\") there might have been 2 ounces of beef on the bottom of this soggy mess.  Moreover, no rice or beans accompanied the \\"meal\\" to add some semblance of value.  One or two customers at 12:15 PM on a Wed. in October probably says more about I Taco than my review."},{"name":"Lily's Sandwich","address":"10901 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I ate here for the first time today, having no idea what to expect.

We go camping a lot and catch crawfish in the lake, then cook them up and serve them with butter next to the campfire. This was going to be great! Well, after eight hours of driving and a walk over from Taylor street, we arrived at Jake's Famous Crawfish. Imagine our sadness when we saw that the only crawfish on the menu was a sad, cold appetizer. No crawfish boil like what I saw on the online menu (with corn on the cob and sausage). We even asked our waitress if there were any to be had via specials and she laughed at us. Laughed! She laughed and replied, \\"Well, even if we had it I wouldn't recommend it!\\" We were really sad.

It did satisfy my cocktail craving though. \\n\\nWe shared the queso fundido ($15), Mezcaleria's molten cheese fondue served in a volcanic rock molcajete. Perhaps it was the chorizo (one of the topping options; the other option is salsa verde), but it was really quite salty. It was almost a slap in the face. However, with the tortillas, it was much better and the super stringy cheese balanced out quite well. Despite the saltiness, I quite liked it; it's a fun and interactive dish. \\n\\nDoro ordered an extra asada taco as well, which she commented to taste \\"beefier\\" than that of La Taqueria's. We each had enchiladas as well -- my enchiladas clasicas ($12) was topped with green tomatillo salsa, onion, cream, and Mexican cheese, and I opted for the chicken. This was very flavourful with the salsa, and I enjoyed the chicken filling as well. Unfortunately, we were both quite full and could not really finish our enchiladas because the cheese was so filling. \\n\\nSemi mixed feelings about La Mezcaleria, but I did like the fondue despite the saltiness.

We decided to check out Masa as we're both fans of tapas and Spanish food. We got there early, around 6:30, and the place was empty, but within a half hour, was totally packed. The atmosphere was what I will describe as \\"lively romantic\\". It's a perfect date place or a fun spot to go with a group of friends or larger party. The decor was warm and obviously Spanish-inspired, but very tasteful and upscale. One negative (and I will make this comment for many of the restaurants in Boston) is that for a party of two, they really try to cram you into those tiny \\"2-top\\" tables that are 6 inches from the table next to you. When I see a hostess leading us toward one, I always, always ask for a different table. I don't mind a small table for 2, but I HATE HATE HATE sitting on top of another couple. It just kills the entire evening for me. So of course, we were originally sat at one of these tables, but I asked to be moved to a table for two in a bit less congested section of the restaurant. So anyways, back to the food.  They had an extensive tequila menu as well as some good-looking specialty cocktails. We were served corn bread and sourdough with three dipping options: a red pepper cream cheese, garlic butter and hummus. All yummy. For dinner, we started with their tapas combo which consisted of 10 miniature tapas for just $10. Their tapas menu apparently is considered their bar menu so it's not provided to you in the main dining room unless you ask for it. If you're an avid tapas eater, beware. Their portions are more like one or two bites than a typical serving which most times is a bit larger than that. So the 10 tapas sampling for two people was a perfect appetizer and not too much at all. It consisted of a bite of each: yuka fries (basically glorfied french fries), pulled pork egg roll, chicken taquito, steak tostada (literally steak on a single tortilla chip-very small), fried eggplant, chorizo, Spanish-style meatball, ahi tuna bite and two others I can't immediately remember. Everything was very good. For dinner, my husband had the monkfish which came with sweet potatoes and spinach. He enjoyed it, but it was his first time eating monkfish and he wasn't in love with the texture and found it chewy in spots. I had the steak frites which were served with a small arugula salad. The steak was cooked perfectly and was surprisingly tender for skirt steak. Overall, the food was very good. Our service was pretty good as well. Our waitress was a bit slow at the beginning, taking a while to deliver the bread which we had to ask for, but overall she was sufficient.

Another woman brought out each plate as it was ready, and another man came by periodically to wipe down our table and give us new plates/silverware, mid meal. \\n\\nWe shared 4 plates- we got the rabbit, the lamb, the rye pasta, and the oyster gratin. My favorites were the rabbit and the lamb. My boyfriend really liked the pasta, especially the crispy skin on top. The rabbit reminded me of fried chicken, but classy. I liked the blue cheese and other sauce/garnishes. The lamb was delicious, and I particularly liked the mashed carrots (I think that is what it was) on the side. They were quite salty but I like salt. The pasta was very heavy with a lot of pepper. The gratin was my least favorite, which was disappointing because I love oysters. The pepper was overpowering, the pork was very sweet, and overall it was like a chowder. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't right for me. I wish I had gotten the corn cakes instead!\\n\\nWe looked at the dessert menu, but it wasn't very..dessert-like. There was a dark chocolate one with bread and figs, a parsnip cobbler (which I almost got except it had star anise in it, which I hate), a smoked bread pudding, and one other item that I can't remember. I did have coffee, which was strong and tasty, but lukewarm. \\n\\nOverall my boyfriend summed it up best. He said this is a great restaurant for people who like root vegetables. Everything was very earthy and smoky. I enjoyed my meal and the restaurant, but I might have trouble convincing him to go back."},{"name":"Pirates Dinner Adventure","address":"6400 Carrier Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"We are in Orlando on family vacation with our 6 year old and 1.5 year old sons.

As it turned out, we only had to wait about 30 minutes before we got the text message asking us to check in, so it's a good thing we were nearly back at the restaurant by then!\\n\\nI sampled the pulled pork (which you have to sauce yourself), the Brunswick stew, the Fox-a-roni, the baked beans, the jalapeno cornbread, the pork ribs, and the brisket.  Everything was very good, except for maybe the brisket, which I thought tasted just a little off (my brother-in-law described it as \\"gamey\\").  The pork ribs were so tender that the bones were literally falling apart, making the sweet marrow within that much more accessible.  For the pulled pork, I used the two sauces available at the table, which were spicy and sweet.  \\n\\nWhile at Fox Bros. I also got to try some sweet tea, which is not to be confused for iced tea with some sugar.  It tasted like half the glass was sugar!  WAY too sweet for my delicate palate... ;)\\n\\nOverall the food was excellent, the atmosphere quirky and fun, and the service attentive and friendly.

They also lacked any kind of seasoning I also ordered these naked  also and I was somewhat disappointed. They also were on the smaller side and tough.\\n\\n- Sliced Pork - I could taste a little hint of smoke but there was no smoke ring present and a little bland for my taste.

Dinner was also enjoyable - I wasn't blown away by the Pan Seared Atlantic Haddock, but the corn puree it was sitting atop had me almost licking my plate clean. The Caesar with Cajun chicken looked awesome from the other end of the table, but sadly I didn't get to sample it for myself.\\n\\nThe main reason behind this review is to share with you the AMAZING summer special they have going on every Sunday & Monday - lobster boil! For all of $33, you get a whole steamed lobster, steamed clams & mussels, spicy chorizo, potatoes, cornbread and spectacularly sweet summer corn. Need more? Pair it with a Maine beer flight for just $8 more, served in adorable mini beer mugs on an even more adorable wooden paddle. Let me assure you, the lobster boil was GOOD. The lobster was cooked perfectly with its signature sweetness the shining star. On the slightly smaller side - maybe 1lb? - but with everything else that accompanies it you'll definitely be satisfied. Unfortunately for my party, they were out of clams that night, but I suspect they made up for it with extra mussels because it was certainly a generous serving. The chorizo was super flavorful and bright red - so much so that it stained my fingers a bit, but no bother to me. Nothing special about the potatoes (a bit bland) and the cornbread (a bit dry), so if you're looking for areas to save room those are my recommendations. As long as you don't pass up the corn. It was some of the best corn on the cob I've ever tasted! I wish I asked them what farm it was from. So sweet & buttery. Dreaming of it as I type this. Mmmm.\\n\\nHighly highly recommend the lobster boil, but also the regular menus."},{"name":"Barrel & Boar Creekside","address":"121 Mill St","city":"Gahanna","stars":"4","text":"Great place with great food and customer service!

I had a chance since I know the manager at UFC, to put my skills to the test and throw on some gloves and do some of my kick ass kickboxing moves. However, having been maybe drunk/heavily buzzed at the time this happened, I was more concerned of not falling on my ass and less concerned on my actual technique. \\n\\nI honestly a little excited for this event because I really couldn't wait to see some of the UFC fights on the fight card.

Since this is like the only Indian restaurant  near Sandy Springs (which is incredibly stupid when the Consulate General of India is on Glenridge Drive),  I placed an order online for lunch.\\n\\nI showed up, not really sure like how long I was supposed to wait because nothing about ordering online tells you when it'll be ready. I guess maybe if you change the time, that might be the way? I left it as ASAP. I would say that's my only negative thing to say because it's not obvious.\\n\\nThe two men there were really nice. I always get asked about how I love spicy food, and I said it was extra important today to clear my sinuses. Nobody was really in the restaurant when I got there, which was like 11:30 on a Thursday. I placed my order as soon as it was 11. I thought there'd be people there by then! Oh well.\\n\\nWow lunch is cool though. I ordered chicken vindaloo, spicy, and for $8 you get your food, some vegetable curry to go along, a samosa, rice pudding, naan, and some kind of soup. Since the day before had been a \\"meh. food.\\" day, I downed every bite. It was glorious. It sounds like a lot and it probably is if you haven't been dreaming about this meal for 12 hours.\\n\\nI'm guessing the stuff like dessert and the appetizer (samosa) may change. I wanted a samosa so badly so I'm glad that's what I got.\\n\\nSo of course I started with the soup, it was full of cilantro. But I had lost most of my sense of taste to the point even cilantro was edible. It was a bit lemony, and just a little spicy...all I know is it felt good to drink down.\\n\\nI moved on to the curry, which was so good. I know I said I couldn't taste but spices and I still worked. It was well spiced and flavored, I could have gone a bit spicier. The chicken was nice and tender from being simmered, and I liked having the addition of the vegetable curry. Usually vindaloo's just with potatoes so having a bit of some other stuff was good. \\n\\nThe samosa was pretty spicy too, the ingredients inside were well minced up, so I'm not really sure what was in there entirely.\\n\\nAnd finally, the rice pudding...I was so leaving that for later but that didn't work. I haven't had rice pudding in so long so it was marvelous.\\n\\nI will definitely be back here, that lunch deal is awesome. Next is lamb!

Corn dogs are good though mine was still cold inside. Fries were fresh potatoes but limp, greasy and cold. Milkshakes were not thick or creamy. Kids liked the boiled peanuts. No hamburger but they have a pork burger. My daughter had one and was unimpressed. I had a bite-me too. The question is \\"Why?\\" This place tries too hard not to fit in. I suppose this would have been fine if it were a cheap date but it isn't. A corn dog is 4.50 and a shake is 5. Neither are worth the price for me.

We definitely didn't leave disappointed this time around. \\n\\nFirst off, I love the small \\"hole in the wall\\" feel of this place. The employees were veey welcoming and looked over the menu with us, filling us in on their favorites and best sellers. The guy who does the pizza baking explained to us that they try to use frrsh produce from area Columbus gardens whenever possible, and mentioned that many of their veggies had just been picked that day. We chose two pizzas, the bianca, I think, for myself, and the carbonera for my husband. This was more than enough for the two of us, and even provided us with some leftovers, which we enjoyed after some drinks later that evening. \\n\\nThe bianca was incredibly yummy with olive oil, gorgonzola cheese and fresh spinach. The crust is usually what makes or breaks a pizza for me, and Bono's pizza had just the right amount of chewiness and wood oven- baked deliciousness. The carbonera was covered in bacon and looked pretty yummy; however, I didn't give it a try, as I'm a vegetarian.\\n\\nSome previous reviewers had mentioned having a long wait when dining in, but we didn't have this issue. There were only a couple of other people there, and they only took one to-go order during the time that we visited.\\n\\nThis place was originally BYOB, but unfortunately this has changed. They don't serve any beverages so we purchased some pop from the adjoining carry-out before they closed up shop.\\n\\nThey offer a belgian waffle for dessert, which I didn't try.

Please trust that I am in no way one of those women than EXPECT a man to open a door for me, but I've pulled up to enough 'Valet only' restaurants in Atlanta to learn that the 'done' thing seems to be to wait for the valet to open the door for us girlies. Let me know if this observation isn't correct. \\nb) when he did eventually come to the car (by which time I'd got out of the car and was waiting for my husband to hand over the car to someone..anyone..) he didn't give us a ticket because he said that he'd remember our faces...er...I guess my husband and I would be easy to spot in a crowded Buckhead restaurant parking lot. Even so.....\\n\\nD√©cor: It's tiny inside. I mean really small. But doesn't feel cramped. The mini bar area at the front is a very cool and moody pit-stop before you head into the main dining area. Not too sure what the d√©cor in the main dining room is supposed to be. I guess a nod to Grecian. \\n\\nDrinks: Good but their spirits are typically over-priced for this part of town. I had a glass of Malbec that was v.good and reasonably priced (for BH)\\n\\nService: Now I feel mixed about this. We were sat in reasonable time. We were early for our reservation so sat in the bar for all of 10 mins. Once at our table we waited 5 mins to get water. Then another 5 mins to get a menu. I flagged the restaurant manager down to ask for a menu. He apologized, got one and told us that our server would be with us soon. 5 mins later our server came to the table. Can't fault him in terms of his demeanor and table-side manner, but hubby was PO about the wait so wasn't in the mood for niceties. For the rest of the meal our server was pretty much MIA. The people next to us had ordered, eaten and were onto their dessert by the time we got our appetizers (they had a different server). \\n\\nFood: My husband says that he doesn't care so much about d√©cor, service etc. as long as he can order whiskey and the food is amazing everything else is a bonus. So he ordered the lobster cocktail since so many people had said how amazing this is. Yes, they are generous with their portion of lobster and it does taste good and it's a novel idea to serve it in a martini glass as a cocktail. The mashed potato and pea puree didn't do much for him or me. I had the lemon & ricotta ravioli on the recommendation of our server. Meh! For Entr√©e we had Roasted Rack of Lamb and Pork Shoulder. The lamb was a little too rare for hubby but it was flavorful. My Pork was good and fell apart beautifully. We declined desert but were comp'ed 3 by the manager. I guess as an apology for the lack luster service. Can't recall the deserts, but they were ok. \\n\\nPrice -  Canoe has now become our bench mark for higher-end dinning in Atlanta. We had a fabulous experience all round and the total bill was a surprise as it still let us afford our mortgage payment. So Aria's prices seemed out of whack with what we ate esp. compared to Canoe. \\n\\nOverall: Can't say we'll be going back any time soon.

SO delicious!"},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I've been putting off going to Ramen Tatsu-Ya for a few reasons.\\n\\n1) Always over-crowded. It's an extremely popular place for half-informed hipsters that honestly don't know any better, and unfortunately that demographic is the most likely to spread the word that this place is worth the wait. Hence, longer lines. Coupled with limited seating space and a tacky fucking line cutting right through the restaurant (seriously, it's 2015, lay your restaurant out better if you are doing the fast casual bar ordering), it's basically almost impossible to go in and out in reasonable time.\\n\\n2) Seriously over priced. Every single item should be $2-3 cheaper. Charging $2 for six-eight tiny slices of flash-fried Brussels sprouts? They better dance on my plate. They're good, but not that great. For a $30 lunch for two people I expect NO technical errors, outstanding quality, and a pleasant dining experience. For what you get at Tatsu-Ya, I would be fine paying for lunch at around $9 a head, including drinks and appetizers. It's, simply put, food truck quality food for premium prices and it's not acceptable.\\n\\n3) Zero service after you have placed your order and sat down. If you are expecting wait staff to attend to you in any way and earn the tip you pay up front (which is a sucker's game, by the way, and the main reason I won't go back), you are out of luck. Once they seat you and bring you the food, you are forgotten.\\n\\nThe Food:\\n\\nHonestly, I see a lot of good reviews for the Ramen, and yeah, the broth is really quite great. However, I see a lot of ignorance and hype in these positive reviews. Here's why.\\n\\n1) RAMEN NOODLES SHOULD NEVER BE SERVED TO YOU SOGGY. I cannot get over this, it's simply such a MASSIVE technical error they might as well close up shop. Ramen noodles have bite and texture and character. I got a bowl of lifeless, bloated, and cloud-soft noodles that had clearly been soaking in the bowl of broth well ahead of time to save time getting the bowls out to customers. UNACCEPTABLE. For an $11 bowl of RAMEN the noodles BETTER be perfect! How could you, Tatsuya? Your noodles are TRASH! The broth might as well be sewer water if your noodles are this bad.\\n\\n2) You can't order more noodles once you finish the first round and have a lot of broth left over! This is due to the stupid ordering/paying up front fast-casual style that frankly fucks their entire business up. So you're left with a massive pool of broth and nothing tasty to chew on as you finish it off! Such a mistake.\\n\\n3) The portions are frankly petite and anemic. The only things my bowl of Ramen had in abundance were scallions and white onions. A SINGLE slice of overly-sweet Chashu pork? Meh. Not impressed.\\n\\nLastly, one final parting word for Tatsuya:\\n\\nGET SOME DAMN PURSE HOOKS FOR YOUR BENCH SEATING"},{"name":"Mi Pizza","address":"6001 W Parmer Ln, Ste 440","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is amazing!

However, I think it is worth sharing.\\n\\nI should also say that I am one of the biggest Olive Garden advocates out there (or at least I used to be). From the breadsticks to the atmosphere to the little mints they give you with the check, what's not to love? Well, my friends and I were to find out at this particular Olive Garden.\\n\\nWe arrived around 7:45pm. We were told that there would be a wait of a few minutes for a table, although I noticed some empty, unbussed tables around the area. Upon being shown to our table, we were left with menus. Each of us were excited about the $4 drinks (we're college students/this was a splurge for us). \\n\\nAfter about ten minutes of seeing waitstaff move around to other tables, we were approached by a waitress who only held a cheese grater and a used glass of water. She said that she could take our orders. One by one, each of us did. Finally at the end, she asked if we were wondering why she wasn't writing anything down and told us that she \\"would remember everything\\" because she always does.\\n\\nApparently she didn't remember to come back for us because in the span of the next half an hour, two different waitresses came to our table to welcome us to the Olive Garden and to start us out with drinks. We had to reorder with a new waitress, without menus, only guessing what we had ordered from memory. \\n\\nAn hour and a half rolled by before salad and breadsticks were brought out. We asked for waters, only to wait another twenty minutes for them as they arrived with our drinks. \\n\\nAnother hour went by and by 9:30pm, the waitress came over to assure us that they hadn't forgotten us. She even sent the manager over to us to explain the situation, that our orders had been placed, but no one thought to run it to the table. \\n\\nEach of us has worked in food service and knows that the customer is always right. The manager of this Olive Garden should learn this and commit it to his work. He was surprisingly rude to us, four young women and a young man, patronizing us for the experience. While we could see that he was trying to be personable and cool with us, he was condescending and a serious liability to a business.\\n\\nWhen our food came, which they kept promising was \\"fresh\\", was not fresh. It had definitely been out for a while, probably while we had been sitting and patiently waiting. \\n\\nAs we boxed up our unfinished, underwhelming meals, the checks came. A few of us noticed that our price was higher than should have been. This was because the drinks that we ordered (from memory and had been passed around via word of mouth by the waitstaff) were more expensive than the $4 ones we had intended. Upon showing this to the manager and explaining how we felt about an overall horrible experience of service, he simply said, \\"Oh no,\\" and left the table to see what he could do.

We decided upon the shrimp and crawfish quesadilla and Filet Mignon Jim Bowie Style.  Both were good choices.  The quesadilla did not have that strong 'fishy' taste, so you know the shrimp/crawfish were fresh.  Floyd's secret sauce was quite delectable, and really pulled the dish together.  When immediately served the Monterrey Jack cheese was oozing and just amazing.  The Jim Bowie style Filet Mignon came with a cream sauce, which was good, but almost completely covered over any taste from the fillets.  The meat seemed to be good quality based on the texture though.  We both couldn't finish out dishes, and so there was another meal worth of leftovers.

D√∂ner kebab, just like in Europe, is spit roasted shaved lamb on a cross between a pita and a hamburger bun, dressed with vegetables and yogurt sauce. The bread here is closer to bun than pita. It is made in- house. The spicy yogurt sauce is tangy and delicious. The fries are great.\\nThe second- second best thing about this place is the incredible selection of German beer. This place puts every other German beer place in town to shame. The beer is, however, a little expensive and only comes in bottles.

Besides the beer, the prices are really great for a table- service restaurant. \\nI'm tired of people complaining about the prices of places that are really quite reasonable.

But it didn't actually come to our table once it was sent throught he kitchen window. There was mass confusion as to where our food was supposed to go and who was going to run it and if the order was right and if there was supposed to be a soup with it. It was remarkable to watch. I'm not sure what their ticketing system is or how they number the tables but I think there needs to be some reworking there. And so let me get to the sad part... the food is great! It's exactly what I want for lunch - plain, simple, wholistic, good food. But goodness, they need to rethink whatever system they have going on.\\n\\nI should mention, however, one of the servers from my last time there. He was great!

So we went across the street to Petsmart. Drove back and 5:00pm and come to see there was a long line at the restaurant already! We got in line and waited. The wait wasn't too bad about 20-25 minutes. I was expecting longer since we would have to wait for the first group of people to finish eating. \\n\\nThe concept is that you order at the counter and they assign you a seat, take a number and they bring you your food. The only CON I would have to say it that you share tables with other people. Even a small table of four, you sit with other people. I wish it would be a little bigger so that way you can just sit with the people your with. I felt a little rush eating, not getting to fully enjoy my meal because I didn't want to hog the table while other people were waiting.\\n\\n- Spicy edemame: really good!! I loved how they seasoned the edemame, it was really spicy.\\n- #1 Tonkotsu Original $8.50:Creamy pork noodle soup with pork belly, marinated egg, wood ear mushroom and scallions..... I added the spicy bomb, chashu, and menma. I added all the spicy paste and it still wasn't spicy at all. It was really creamy. \\n- #3 Mi-So-Hot $10\\nSpecial blend miso based tonkotsu noodle soup with ground pork, napa cabbage, bean sprout and marinated egg.... Added Chashu (it doesn't come with it) Really Really GOOD! My bf ordered it and the broth was so much better than the original. I'm definitely going to order this the next time."},{"name":"Wolf & Bear's","address":"3925 N Mississippi Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"An amazing bite for lunch or dinner..

On the second call she confirmed we were OK up to 30 minutes, I said thank you then went to ask if there was parking she could recommend, but she hung up too fast, I waited to call back on this since I decided it best to just figure that out on my own.

The texture of the \\"meatloaf\\" was mushy and moist, like it was something designed for someone who had no teeth! Felt like meatloaf had been run through a food processor to make it have the ability to be sucked through a straw. This lovely mixture was then thrown in between two slices of bread and quickly seared on a flattop to brown up the bread but did nothing for the texture. The butter soaked bread just added to the soggy wet big pile of meat + mash potato + ketchup mush! 0 s!  I honestly was also not a fan of the seasoning mix on my fries or my gfs tater tots either total waste of $10.... this place has a cool atmosphere and is worth checking out but I'd stick with the breakfast menu and certainly if you have teeth I'd say DONT GET THE MEATLOAF milkshake!!!!"},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"The food is good, but the service is HORRIBLE.\\n\\nThree friends and I went to Border and asked for a table for six, because two people were going to meet up with us at the restaurant.

Yelp removed my previous review because it \\"didn't provide enough detail about my experience.\\"  LOL\\n\\nThe last time I went was actually before the lines were as bad as they are now - but I was lucky enough to come on the coldest day of the year, which was a blessing and a curse.  Because it was freezing, the line was shorter.  I also had to wait outside for over an hour in subzero temperatures.  \\n\\nThe food itself, as you can gather, is top notch, definitely 5-star.   Because I had been there so long I got a lot more than a single serving - enough to take home and last a couple of days.  The brisket is outstanding and so is everything else.   I didn't think the pulled pork was quite as great as the other meats but we're splitting hairs.  I also recommend the bourbon banana pie.\\n\\nThe real issue is whether or not you want to wait in line and to their credit, they have made some accommodations so it's become something of an Austin experience.  If you have the time, it's one of those attractions.\\n\\nHere is my previously disallowed review, the main point of which is that if you don't have the time or inclination to wait hours, there are several other barbecue joints in the area that are just as good or very close and in some cases, feature items that Franklin's doesn't have.  I am a fan of beef ribs and my dogs appreciate it when I choose that, so that entails another venue.\\n\\n\\"OK, everyone knows the BBQ is 5 stars but the wait is 1 star unless you find it a bonding experience or something you can tell everyone stories about.\\n\\nPersonally, as a business person, if I had this kind of following I would make an effort to expand so people didn't have to wait up to several hours to eat. But hey, that's me.\\n\\nThe thing is, I'm from Ft. Worth, live in Austin and have spent a lot of time in every city in Texas. I know BBQ very well and the reality is, the only reason to go through this is to say you did it. There are a half a dozen places I go to, just off the top of my head, with OUTSTANDING BBQ and nowhere near the kind of wait you have to deal with here.\\n\\nIf you want to do it for the experience so you have something to brag about to your friends, fine. If you want fantastic barbecue, try the Iron Works or Terry Blacks or head to the hill country and get Cooper's. For a bare-bones dive with no wait and great food, Sam's in East Austin is amazing. Low-key faves are Donn's in Oak Hill and Vic's on Burleson Rd. \\n\\nFranklin's may be like one of those things in NYC you just have to do - but the rest of the time, there are plenty of other fantastic options. This is Austin, after all.\\"\\n\\nThat's not a knock against the quality of Franklin's food at all, although I don't find it to be SO much better than other places I frequent.  Do it once to say you did and decide for yourself."},{"name":"B√°nh M√¨ Tr√®s Bon","address":"1840-4720 McClelland Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"4","text":"Very cute restaurant!

Last night was magical, not only because we began planning our soon to be annual R.Kelly White Party on a Yacht/M's Secret Bat Mitzvah Part I, but more importantly, because it happens only once that I get the chance to celebrate one of my oldest GFs totally crushing med school and matching in IM at UCSF. Because she is in-effing-credible. And brilliant. And a babe. CS, you've been warned ;) \\n\\nAnd there was no better backdrop for these festivities than Alden & Harlow, which I've been trying to get to for a year, but as I'm an ace at being flaky and A&H is in hot demand, our stars didn't cross until yesterday - and thank goodness that Jupiter was rising or whatever was necessary for us to snag some of the coveted seats at the bar - which, from the moment we arrived a bit after 6, continued to get more slammed as the evening marched on.\\n\\nThe cocktail list is extensive and peppered w little treats like The Rounder - rye, campari, spruce/juniper dolin blanc, absinthe, and flamed orange - it's easy to get overwhelmed - I rec chatting w the bartenders, all of whom were quite knowledgeable - or just go hard and get one of everything, or, as I like to think of it, a Long Island Iced Tea in my tum. \\n\\nActually that would be doing a disservice to how well crafted the cocktails are, but whatever. Noteworthy beers too, all of which are local-ish, with the exception of the gluten-free option, which hails from the great state of WI. Because of course somewhere in Cambridge has to have a GF bur. Of course. \\n\\nOnto the nosh - kale salad w pistachio dressing/honey/fennel was richer than expected, though somehow also fresh and tight - was tempted by the raw celery root w caper brown butter/lemon/walnuts/golden raisins, but instead went for the smoked artic char belly on brown bread w/ roasted carrots/apples/sunchokes - a showstopper - reminding us all that Jew food + Irish staples should get together and do the hora on a plate more often - and the burrata w fried walnuts/pickled carrots/mind/raisins/burnt onion oil was cleverly delicious. \\n\\nAs literally everyone has mentioned, should you get there early enough to obtain a \\"secret burger\\" before they run out, it's worth it - though if you miss it, I think you won't regret hitting the chestnut agnolotti, NY strip, or monkfish liver pate. Menu changes regularly, so if these options aren't floating your boat, 1) you lose, and 2) check back in a bit for when they've mixed it up.\\n\\nFor dessert we dabbled in the chocolate bread pudding w sea salt ice cream. It. Was. Smokey. And like not in that \\"awww, smokey the bear is adorbs\\" way, but in that \\"wait, I thought I was eating a dessert, not licking a BBQ pit\\" way - in short, it's an acquired taste - but to our waiter's credit, he warned us. And the ice cream was  nice, so not a total wash.\\n\\nPresentation all around is quite pretty w/o being precious. Attention paid to detail. Decor is that seductive industrial-chic thing that everyone is doing now and call me basic, but I don't hate it. I actually fancy it. It's like eating in what my dining room would look like if I had an underground lair in what used to be a sexy woodshop? Maybe? \\n\\nIf you're doing it right w shared plates/entrees/booze/dessert, it'll easily run you $60-70/per person - though I guess if you're a lighter eater, a shared plate (mostly around $16) + a cocktail ($12) won't set you back too far, but A&H is good enough that I heartily encourage you to spend freely as you will not be disappointed.

For example, the brussels sprouts dish was A. Not Greek in any capacity and B. super over salted. On top of that the aioli to veggie ratio was grossly out of balance leaving soggy sprouts in my dish. The donuts we ordered for dessert were also terrible. So incredibly greasy, soggy, dense, overpowering grapeseed flavor- just generally not enjoyable.\\n\\nOnce again cocktails are overpriced and service is beyond poor. Our server disappeared for long stretches of time and was the opposite of attentive. I also asked for seltzer with a lime and was brought tonic water.

Very good sesame seed bun. Plenty of different choices for burgers and all are a good value at an average of $5. They come wrapped in oh-so-cool PleatPaks making for neat and sanitary eating.

Be open to all the awesome, colorful people in line who will become your fast friends as you salivate to the smells of smoky meats. You don't feel the wait because the Franklin's really makes an effort to accommodate everyone with water stations, restrooms, checking on the line, giving realistic estimates of time, and being gracious at every step.\\n4. You won't go wrong but definitely get brisket and ribs. The meat is so tender, perfectly spiced, dripping with juices that you will definitely wish you got more. If you are in a group I would order by the pound and get one of each side: potato salad, beans and cole slaw.

Remember they are also cash only. A word of ADVICE- the oven only has room for 1 pizza at a time (about 3 mins per, probably) so sometimes it takes a little while to get your food. If you eat there, expect to be there awhile. \\n\\nNow, our other favorite reason to come is the dessert Waffle that Peggy makes. MMMMM you just need to try it. We usually tell her to do it up for us with whatever she wants- and she hooks it up. Another word of ADVICE- call before you go to reserve a waffle, as sometimes they sell out pretty early and it is a very sad thing when that happens! We usually demolish this in less than 5 seconds. \\n\\nSo- if you are looking for the greatest melt-in-your-mouth fresh pizza ever... don't judge, suck it up and go into that convenience store and right into Bono- you will not regret!"},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"As you roll up to the parking lot of Fat Matt's Rib Shack, you can see plumes of smoke rising up into the air.  Once you get out of your car, you can begin to smell the smokey fragrances of the BBQ.  Much like the Sirens' songs, you are lured into the Shack by its smells.  It pulls you in.  Once you smell it, you can't escape it.  You must go in.  \\n\\nAnyways, that's what happened to some friends and I this past weekend in Atlanta.  We got there over a half hour before it opened.  We were in a rush to catch a plane, and if we waited for the 2:00PM opening time, we would have been at risk of missing some flights.  Well, the smart, prudent thing would have been to go next door to the Fried Chicken place, or grab something else to eat, but, we all smelled the food at the Rib Shack.  There was no escape after that.  We stood there at the door waiting for the place to open.  The best part?  We weren't the only ones.  Yes, on a random Sunday at one of probably a hundred rib shacks in Atlanta, there was a line waiting for the place to open.  \\n\\nOnce we were in, my mouth was drooling so much that I pretty much tried to order everything on the menu.  I didn't, but I came close.  I had the chopped pork sandwich, which was good, but not great.  I've had better.  But, that's pretty much the only bad thing I can say about this place.  Once I bit into the ribs...correction, the word \\"bit\\" implies that I needed to use my teeth.  Let me start the sentence over.  Once I held the rib over my mouth and let the meat fall off onto my tongue, I realized that this may have been the best BBQ I have ever had in my life.  The sauce was sweet, tangy, and spicy all at the same time.  It was rich and flavorful but did not overpower the flavor of the meat.  Crap, my stomach is growling right now as I write this.  It was so good, that I started eating other people's ribs after I was done with mine.  The sides were generous and tasty as well, but the thing to get there is definitely the ribs.  The sweet tea was very good (but I am by no means a sweet tea connoissieur) and the ambience was fantastic."},{"name":"Hapa Umi","address":"909 W Cordova St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"We visited Hapa Umi with the $30 for $60 voucher from Living Social.\\n\\nService:  Our server was friendly.

If I could give Franklin 4.5 stars I would, but in generosity I think it deserves 5. So, we arrived at 9:00 in the morning. Line was pretty long, but not bad. The whole anticipation was pretty fun. I mean, you're sitting in a camping chair and drinking beer, waiting to have delicious barbecue. People who complain about the wait misunderstand barbecue. Barbecue is the cuisine of those who have patience. \\n\\nBut here's the thing: There needs to be some sort of line etiquette at Franklin. I didn't particularly care for the people in front of me who were smoking cigarettes and playing dubstep hits from 2011 from their iPhones, who then had a dozen additional people join them in line at 10:30, effectively cutting in front of us. \\n\\nNot really a big deal, but come on y'all, have some common courtesy. \\n\\nWe got there at 9:00.

If we can't find a sushi restaurant around, then our fall back is typically \\"Happy Sumo\\" located in the Orchard Mall in Westminster. However, compared to this location, Happy Sumo is hardly sushi at all. Don't get me wrong, I like the american-ized sushi varieties from Happy Sumo from time to time (I adore their Vegas Roll), however Hana, to me, comes off as much more authentic and as a whole far more appetizing. Now to the meal(s):\\n\\n-HANA OYSTERS-\\nI myself had never tried oysters before. I didn't want to have a bad experience with them at a low quality sushi bar and ruin them for me forever, but tonight was the night. I certainly wouldn't consider myself an oyster connoisseur, so my judging upon this dish is not exactly well researched, however these were delightful. People that joined me at Hana, however, are pretty experienced with oysters, and they commented that these were the best they had ever had at any sushi restaurant... so I can safely say that these are quality, and should not get passed up. They don't come \\"Plain Jane\\" like they do at a lot of other Japanese restaurants... they are served with a type of Tobasco sauce already in the shell, as well as other select spices, however nothing over bearing (Check out a picture of the \\"Hana Oysters\\" on my profile). All in all, very exceptional oysters. \\n\\n-PIZZA ROLL-\\nThis was a very delicious roll. The name threw me off a little bit, however I didn't let that prevent me from ordering it. As it is read on the menu: \\"Lion Eye (which is a seperate roll on the menu that contains tuna, white fish, and avocado) broiled with dynamite sauce.\\" Typically, anything with dynamite sauce is scrumptious, however, this had a unique sense to it, as it was a roll inside of a roll. The flavors and ingredients mingled wonderfully. The one complaint I have is that a few slices of the roll fell apart pretty easily, but that didn't ruin the Pizza Roll for me, and when I return this will be ordered again.\\n\\n-IRON CHEF'S ROLL- \\nAs it is read on the menu: \\"Lobster tail tempura, cucumber, avocado, flying fish roe with spicy sauce.\\" I wouldn't label the \\"Iron Chef's Roll\\" as one of my favorited rolls I've ever had, however it was appetizing. However, when the roll was brought to the table it had an extra ingredient in it, that being lettuce. This, I didn't favor all to well... as I thought the lettuce was very contradicting to the rest of the ingredients mixed in. It was ice burg lettuce too, the type you layer on deli sandwiches. Not the greatest combo in my opinion, however everyone's pallet is different. \\n\\nBesides the lettuce addition, the crunch of the lobster tail complimented the tenderness of the avocado, as well as the natural crunch of the cucumber very nicely. I would order it again.\\n\\n-BANG BANG ROLL-\\nOn the menu it reads as: \\"Tuna, crab meat, avocado, and spicy mayo.\\" Nothing real crazy or unique. I wouldn't order this one again, simply because of its very basic structure. It had fine flavor and it would be great for a person of limited sushi experience... however for me it was a little bit too similar to \\"Tokyo Joe's\\" rolls, in which are very basic and somewhat boring. But like I said, not bad.\\n\\nAs well as the rolls, I ordered several salmon, crab sticks, nigiri, and sea urchin. Salmon is best when it's real luscious and has a nice \\"melt in your mouth\\" texture, and these salmon cuts were all of the above. The nigiri was as well pleasing, however it fell apart very easily upon dipping into soy sauce. The crab sticks were what you would expect... they kind of have a universal style/taste that doesn't vary often. I'm not necessarily a big crab stick fan, so that is my biased opinion, however these weren't bad. \\n\\nSea Urchin was another something I had yet to try. I hear very diverse opinions about it, however my personal taste buds do not favor this meat. It's nothing on the restaurant, as that is simply the natural flavor of the urchin. I'm glad I tried it, however I would not order again. \\n\\nOverall, Hana offers high quality Japanese cuisine, and I would strongly recommend to any sushi go-er. I urge you to order the Oysters, as I found them to be so satisfying that another 2 orders had to be delivered to my table. I also recommend the Pizza Roll, as it was unique and very good. I look forward to returning to Hana, and enjoying more of their menu options, and am incredibly pleased that I found this restaurant."},{"name":"John Barleycorns","address":"14610 SW Sequoia Pkwy","city":"Tigard","stars":"3.5","text":"Washingtonian Review\\n\\nCame here last minute on a Sunday night.

I think every time I've been there, someone has ordered the \\"blackjack, or whatever it is you call it here\\" burger.\\n\\nAnd there's certainly overlap here. The establishments share ownership and play to similar crowds. In my head Christopher's skews slightly more upscale, but they both hit the same price point. Both have excellent beer menus (varied enough to give everyone something to like, short enough to actually get you to order). Both have stellar burgers, although I think I have to give the by-a-nose victory to Christopher's there. Christopher's also wins for still having deli spears, not bread-and-butter slices. Blech.\\n\\nDespite hewing close together, I take Christopher's over the Common any day of the week (although we often argue between the two, and I never complain about going to either.)

There will likely be a wait but it usually isn't long.  I'd recommend against the house margarita as I believe they are pre-mixed and watered down.  As a vegetarian I'm impressed they have a whole separate menu section for us, and they always make sure to ask if you want white rice and black beans vs. the jambalaya, which is cooked in meat broth.  The veggies are so fresh and there are a variety of them - not just onions and peppers!  I usually order either the vegetable jambalaya (awesome and comes with corn bread!) or veggie fajitas, and I always have plenty left over for lunch.  If I'm feeling more decadent I get the black bean and corn empanadas, deep fried and ridiculously cheesy and delicious.

I was woefully under-dressed in 60 degree weather because my body couldn't regulate its own temperature, and the only thing that saved me was a cup of green tea that my wife got for me at the Legends Coffee shack located off the parking lot.\\n\\nAnyway, the point of this review is to say that, despite all the miserable conditions that plagued me on this day in Austin, this was STILL the best BBQ I've ever had. My only regret was that I wasn't able to eat as much I could have if I were at 100%. A couple of notes:\\n\\n- The line isn't that bad if you make it there early on a weekday. You can borrow a lawn chair nowadays (nice touch Franklin) and have a seat and make some friends who are there for the exact same reason you're there for. You always have some common ground to start with.\\n- The brisket is a must have. Get as much of it as you think you can eat, and you won't regret over-ordering a tiny bit. You'll have a delicious snack for later on.\\n- Don't leave without getting a pie. The bourbon banana pie was fantastic, and while it may be  an insane thing to say, I would mention this dessert as the single best thing I had in all of Austin, even ahead of the brisket. (What? Did I just say that?)\\n\\nIt's worth the experience if you have the time to chill out on line for a couple of hours. Bring a book, a cell phone charger, or a cooler filled with beer.

Potatoes are potatoes are potatoes...perhaps oatmeal would have been more exciting.  Watercress is just a fancy way of saying, \\"we're too cheap to give you a side salad, so here, have some overly-bitter green crap that looks frou-frou\\".

At this point our dinner turned into a farce. A few bites in to the calamari I thought I might throw it up, and it became very tough to get down. Don't get it.\\n\\nFor my entree I played it safe and got the bolognese (low risk meal, hard to screw up too badly). Wasn't terrible, but wasn't good. I mostly just ate the plain pasta out of it. \\n\\nBF got the angus special with shrimp and mashed potatoes. His steak was actually cooked medium rare but it just didn't taste it. Very chewy, very hard to swallow. His shrimp tasted frozen as they were also very chewy and hard... weird. Mashed potatoes were cold. He tried to force me to have a bite and I couldn't eat more than a lick. Just awful.\\n\\nFor dessert we got the tiramisu a la mode. The best part was the ice cream.  The tiramisu was terrible! It had a strange aftertaste, a little sour almost.

We were seated promptly at a high top table in the bar area.  The restaurant was very busy, and many people were waiting for tables in the bar area, even though there is much more space than it looks like from outside.\\n\\nSince 2/3 of our party had never been to Alden and Harlow before, our server gave us the lowdown on how much food to order, specials, favorite, etc...  She let us know that the food is served tapas style and comes out when it is ready, and she would suggest 2 plates per person.\\n\\nWe decided on 5 plates for the 3 of us, and had plenty of food!   We couldn't finish everything and all left very full.\\n\\nCharred Broccoli - 4/5 - The broccoli was charred but not burnt, and the butternut squash hummus was a sweet, creamy compliment to the broccoli.  Delicious!  \\n\\nCorn Pancakes - 2.5/5 - This was the only dish that I wasn't overly impressed with.  I found it kind of boring?  It just tasted like corn pancakes with peppers, but there was no wow factor for me.  The presentation (coming out with popcorn on top), was on point.\\n\\nKale and Pork Belly Pappardelle - 5/5 - I generally love pasta, but this really was delicious and different than your traditional pasta dish.  The pasta itself was made with the kale and perfectly cooked.  The walnuts added a nice crunch, and the mint was a nice touch and made the dish a little more light and fresh.  The pork belly did not overpower the dish.\\n\\nFried Chicken Sandwich on a Pork Fat Biscuit - 5/5 - This was the special on Wednesday night, and it was amazing.   Luckily, we split this 3 ways, otherwise I think I would have been sick since it was so rich.  The chicken had a flavorful, crunchy coating and was still moist inside.  The biscuit was perfectly flaky, the chicken was moist with a crunchy, flavorful coating and covered with gruyere cheese and aioli.  Homemade chips (a personal favorite) were covering every open inch on the plate, and piled high.\\n\\nWe also ordered the steak, but I only had a bite because I was already so full from everything else, so I can't say too much about it.\\n\\nThe service was great at the beginning of the night, but slowly got off track and our server didn't come back or check on us for a long time.

And then I waited in line for 4 hours to finally get the opportunity to order the brisket, the pork, the turkey, and even sausage links.\\n\\nSometimes when you build up something in your mind to be so amazing, the experience that comes has no chance to meet the expectations.

The turkey was perfect.  The sausage links were also the best I've ever had.  The sides were very good, too.

Get there around 8am, and be really hungry when you finally get to place your order.  It's worth it."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"There's nothing more that needs to be said about Franklin BBQ, but I'll do so anyway. This the best BBQ restaurant I have ever visited and I thoroughly believe it may well be the best in the world. This is one of those rare instance where my expectations had been set incredibly high and were then EXCEEDED by a wide margin. Yes, you will have to be in line for a long time; yes, it will all seem a bit crazy; yes, you will think about leaving; yes, it will be worth it!!!\\n\\nI arrived at Franklin at about 7:30am on Saturday morning. It was overcast and a bit on cool side when I arrived and I was pleased to see my spot in line would be under the cover of the deck. I grabbed the second to last communal chair and settled in for a wait. I was probably in the first 50 or so guests in line that day and within an hour there were at least another 75 folks behind me. Many of those people stood in a parking lot, in periodic rain for at least 4.5 hours to get some BBQ; I doubt many of them were disappointed. The line and the wait is part of the experience (not the best part), once again yes, it will all seem a bit crazy and yes, it will be worth it. \\n\\nI actually made it to the counter and ordered at about noon. When I first got tot he counter the carver handed over a sample of brisket for all the folks at the front of the line. I knew from the first bite that it was all worth while. The menu is simple: meats by the pound, a few sides, potato bread, sandwiches, desserts (mostly pie). When you get to the counter you place your order and it's hand carved in front of you while you chat with the servers. No one is laggardly but they do take the time to talk with you if you'd like and the process take a few minutes per customer. I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted and was only getting an order for there (not a larger take out order) but it still took 3-4 minutes, and was actually pretty awesome to watch. Here's what I had:\\n\\n1/3 pound lean brisket - Truly excellent! You can taste how simple everything is (salt, pepper, beef, smoke) but it comes together wonderfully well. This is a testament to the innate value of attention to detail. The texture is perfect, holds up under it's own weight, but incredibly tender and with a great chew and mouth feel. The slices I got had a thick, delicious, dark outer bark a beautiful deep red smoke ring, and about a 1/3 inch layer of golden fat along the top edge of each slice. It looked like the Platonic ideal of a slice of brisket. (from the flat). The taste was phenomenal on it's own and even better with one thin slice of white onion. \\n\\n1/3 pound fatty brisket (burnt ends) - I put burnt ends in parenthesis because Franklin doesn't serve them in what might now be considered the conventional sense. These were closer to what Arthur Bryant would have been putting in a basket by the order window out in KC a few decades back. Cut into ~1.5 - 2 inch chunks, this outer portion of the delicious brisket point was a fascinating dichotomy in crunchy bark and luscious fatty beef. Again, these 'burnt ends' were excellent on their own but even better with a thin slice of onion and I actually liked to drag them through just a tiny bit of the vinegar based sauce that was on all of the tables. You won't see 'burnt ends' anywhere on the menu, but they can be requested and I would highly recommend doing so. \\n\\n1/3 pound pulled pork - Hands down, and without hesitation, the BEST pulled pork I have ever eaten! I know it's Texas and the brisket is really the big draw, but PLEASE ORDER SOME OF THE PULLED PORK!!! Barky, smoky, tender, flavorful, juicy, GORGEOUS! This would be a showstopper anywhere else in the world and it's a testament to Franklin that it takes a backseat to the brisket. A dozen people asked me if I would do it all again and wait in line in the future and I can unequivocally say yes even if they were out of brisket and all that was left was this indescribably good pulled pork. I liked the pulled pork best paired with a crunchy, briny pickle slice and maybe a drop of the vinegar sauce, but it was pretty much perfect all on it's own. \\n\\n2 pork spare ribs - Well, I say two, because that's what I ordered and paid for, but I was actually given three. the gent in front of me finished a rack of ribs so mine came from a virgin rack and I was given the end rib for free! Again, these were beautiful BBQ. My one complaint was that the bone pulled out completely free before I even took my first bite. Many people would cheer about 'fall off the bone ribs' but people in the know in BBQ know that generally means they're just overcooked. Somehow these ribs were totally 'fall off the bone' without being the least bit mushy in the mouth. Like everything else they tasted amazing and I'd order them again without hesitation, but I have no idea how the texture was so good when the leading indicator was that they were overcooked.\\n\\nHAHA - Didn't know there's a character limit for Yelp, but: GO TO FRANKLIN BBQ, IT'S AMAZING!"},{"name":"Veli Thai","address":"335 SW 5th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"To be completely honest, I tried Veli Thai because the cart I was at had an insanely long line.

As everyone else said, order the 50/50 and then throw those onion strings on your burger, you won't regret it.\\n\\nWe went on a Friday night our first visit and we couldn't park in the lot, which sucked (apparently on the weekends you have to pay to park in the lot because Tasty Burger does not own it). Fortunately, we found parking just a block away. It was packed once inside of the restaurant, but we found a table within a few minutes. Our second visit we went on a Tuesday night so the parking lot was available. We sat at the bar and that was pretty cool because they have tons of magic 8 balls, rubix cubes, and other games to play. \\n\\nI wish they had a larger beer selection, but the Hoegaarden is good for now.

That said, I went into Hei La Moon with hope. I did. I read some reviews on Yelp and there were good ones on there. I've been dying for good dim sum since moving to Boston but alas... I have not found my place yet. \\n\\nHei La Moon has a good, energetic dim sum atmosphere. That's a good start. Plus, the servers milling around with the carts were able to tell us, in English, what the food was, so that's a plus since I'm (sadly) allergic to shrimp and crab and definitely didn't want to make an early afternoon trip to the ER. \\n\\nThe biggest food plus has to be the BBQ pork buns. I may seem weird for saying this, but I'm slightly obsessed with them. I had actually been craving one for a week or so before deciding to go to dim sum so this was perfect timing. The buns didn't disappoint. Piping hot, super tasty... DEFINITELY have them if you go there.\\n\\nThe rest of the food didn't wow me at all. Hence the 'meh, I've had better' rating. Maybe I just have higher standards. I don't know. I went with my parents, boyfriend and a family friend who lives in Boston. He loved it. The rest of us were underwhelmed. Honestly, it might just be because we've had the best of the best dim sum at home. We had dumplings with all kinds of fillings, vegetables, sesame sticky balls, shrimp balls (not for me but for everyone else), tofu and a few other things. We lost track. But the fabulous tastes you expect with dim sum just weren't there. Slightly too salty or bland or oily...what have you. Nothing really popped (aside from the BBQ pork buns).\\n\\nThat being said, the waiters and waitresses were all very nice, prompt and courteous. But the food just did not deserve a stellar rating. I wish I could rate it higher...but I just can't. I can't help but wonder, is this just good dim sum for Boston? I hesitate to try another dim sum place for fear of the same result...

I like the look of the converted garage, and the street art hanging on the walls definitely fits the vibe. There's a jukebox (computer) and a pool table, plus a bunch of TVs showing football and basketball. It's also a HUGE plus that they have a parking lot, though I wouldn't count on being able to park during the summer. It's just a short walk from Fenway, and those spots are worth about $50 during a game. Regardless, we drove, and we parked. It was awesome. I will, however, agree that the floor is incredibly slippery and I wouldn't want to walk on it when it's wet. Also, I don't trust how airtight those garage doors are. I could see gaps, and I bet they leak in a lot of cold air.\\n\\nBut let's talk about food. My boyfriend and I split the 50/50 fries and onion rings (they're really more like onion crisps). The fries were mediocre, but the onion rings were awesome. It was more like 75% fries to 25% onions rings though, which was a little disappointing. I ordered the onion burger on top of that, which had even more onion crisps along with some gooey cheese. It was a very sizable burger, and pretty tasty. While I prefer my burger medium-rare, I like that TB's standard is to cook to medium rather than rare, like so many fast food burger spots. The burger was pretty greasy, but greasy means juicy, so no major complaints. I did think it was sort of weird that my soda was served in a bottle rather than from a fountain, but I can deal with that.\\n\\nSomething to keep in mind is TB's Starving Student Special.

So big that I wouldn't recommend getting more than one starter to share unless you're REALLY hungry. We all ended up taking about half of our food home (though I'll admit, it all made for wonderful leftovers, especially the biscuits when they were warmed up!). The food was also delicious. The black-pepper syrup with the hushpuppies was killer, and the freshly breaded chicken is something that at least one person needs to order per table. Sticky buns were as soft as Cinnabon, but not as saccharine. The brisket hash was so-so, but as leftovers the smoke flavor calmed down considerably. \\n\\nPrices were good too. Seating was done expediently and in a very smart way. The exterior is very deceptive as to how many tables are actually inside, but they use their real estate in a way that doesn't put you in the laps of the group next to you.

They only make a certain amount of BBQ everyday. Its also nice if you're one of the first 30 people in line because it means you have a place to sit and eat at a table. We were one of the lucky ones while the rest were stalking the edges with their plates looking for a table.  \\n\\nI visited this place while on a road trip. I originally saw it on i think a travel channel special on the best BBQ of Texas. It does not disappoint if you are looking for great tender pieces of flavorful BBQ. \\n\\nI got a plate full of brisket, ribs, slaw, and pinto beans. I like this option because it meant you got to try most of the menu items. When getting the brisket, they ask if you want the fat side or the leaner side. Being the curious foodie, I got both the fat side and the lean side. Trust me when I say, the fat side is so much better. Who cares about the extra calories. Its so much more juicy and has a lot more flavor than the lean side. \\n\\nThe ribs were pretty good too. It was super tender and fell right off the bone, but if I were to ever find myself in Austin, I'd definitely go for an all fat brisket plate. \\n\\nI also tried the pecan pie. it was average. when i asked the cashier which dessert i should get, he was refreshingly honest and said none of the above. He said \\"we're known for our BBQ, not our desserts. they're just regular.\\" I still got one cause I need sweet after every meal. he was correct. it wasnt bad, just average."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I order the original with an extra egg, love it.

While technically, it is fried, the breading was crunchy and not oily at all. The portion was very big, the fish was fresh and cooked perfectly topped with a saucy white remoulade. It came with dirty rice and sausage which was also amazing. The whole time I couldn't stop saying how good everything tasted. Perfectly cooked and flavorful. They start you off with biscuits and corn bread which were also great - soft, moist and fresh with creamy whipped butter. Easily the best biscuits I had in ATL.\\n\\nThe space is really nice - they have a fairly large outside patio and inside is very bright and airy. I liked the semi-exposed kitchen behind the bar. Hosts and waiters were friendly. Service was a bit slow in the beginning - took awhile for our water to be brought out and food came out before our drinks! Turns out our waiter forgot to put in the drinks order so they gave them to us on the house which was a very nice gesture.

First visit was mixed, but I saw potential I liked.  Second visit, new menu, prices up by 30 to 40%.  They are trying to do a quality job here, but it just didn't work.  Too many weird things and ends up one of the most expensive breakfasts in Vancouver.\\n\\nFirst time, I had brunch and I did enjoy it, but left feeling that it wasn't quite right. Let's be clear though, the quality of the food here is very good. I love the homemade ketchup, hot sauce and jam. That's classy and appreciated. Good, strong coffee too. And the room is lovely. We sat at a booth that is nice and spacey and has really cushy benches. Service is very friendly and attentive too.\\n\\nSo I ordered the corned beef hash. I love a hash and with home made corned beef, that just sounded awesome. It was very good, but at the same time, not how I would have preferred it. It came with a good portion of sauerkraut which was under the eggs. I get it, corned beef and sauerkraut are meant to go together, but here it made the eggs taste very vinegary and I didn't like that. Easy option, ask for it on the side, but it's just a bad idea in the first place.\\n\\nThe other thing was that the corned beef was a big pile separate to the rest. For a hash, I expected it to be chopped up and fried with the potatoes and probably some onions too. On the side meant that really, it was a case of putting the hash together on your plate. Missing was the kind of cooked hash experience that I love. It's also served in a bowl, which I didn't prefer.\\n\\nThis sounds like a lot of complaints, but the ingredients and the the cooking were still very good. I wouldn't hesitate to come back here, but would try something else, and so I did...\\n\\nSo second time. Turns out, they changed the menu recently. They no longer have bacon and eggs. No bacon at all, which is a little odd for a place with a pig sign outside, but whatever. Prices are much higher now.  All breakfasts used to be $11, which to be fair, was pretty reasonable. Now they are around $14 or $15.  On top of that, you don't get toast with most options, so buying toast is another $5.  That makes a $14 breakfast $19. Wow! That is one expensive breakfast!\\n\\nWe ordered the the short rib with sous vide eggs. What the heck is \\"sous vide eggs\\"? Well, it's eggs poached in a slightly different way that had them delivered near raw and all slimy. Really horrible. Appreciated that they swapped them for us, but really, these pretentiously named eggs are just a bad idea. \\n\\nThe warm kale breakfast was unusual and very nicely prepared. If you like vege for breakfast, this was a winner, but again, no toast. I had pork belly and eggs (no bacon!)  The pork belly was really tasty though. Eggs were over easy and were overcooked. Almost hard. The idea is that they are flipped over for a second and served.  These were cooked on the other side.  Cooking easy over eggs is pretty basic stuff for a brunch place.\\n\\nAs I said earlier, great room and nice service, but sadly, this is now a miss for me. Way too expensive and feels like the chef is just trying too hard to impress.

We went here today after a wild hunt for a place to buy and fill a propane tank and after grocery shopping.  We went there because I literally thought my head was going to explode if I didn't get some lunch, as it was well past lunch time.  So they have some kinks to work out, as they just opened.  We walked in, and were seated shortly after, and when I asked the hostess if we could have a booth, she looked at me like I was asking for the moon, and said no.  Seriously?  There were four open booths, and last time I checked, you don't need to be VIP for the booth seating at the Olive Garden.  Words of wisdom, if a customer asks for a booth seat, and they are empty, LET THEM SIT THERE.  There's this crazy thing called customer service.\\n\\nSo our food was decent.  I got the soup, salad, and breaksticks, and Jesse got chicken alfredo.  The salad was dressed a little too lightly, and I don't use much dressing.  The breadsticks were right on target.  My soup (the minestrone) was veggie-filled and good.  Jesse's pasta was good.  It took a while for us to get our drinks, and I would have appreciated the breadsticks earlier than she brought them.\\n\\nWe get the check, and we are ready to bolt.  We didn't check it, after it was run, we noticed that we were charged for an extra soda, which we didn't get.......it took another 10 minutes to get corrected, when we were ready to leave.  It's not that I mind a slow pace, but when you have people sitting waiting literally for you to return, have the coutesy to hurry and be apologetic.  That's just me though, and because I am customer service nut when I give it.\\n\\nAnyway, this is a good place if you have no where to go and want to sit and chat and eat lots of soup.

Luckily, it was well worth it.\\n\\nWe got there early because we wanted to try as much as we could and didn't want them to sell out of anything before we got in.  We ordered lean and fatty brisket, pulled pork, ribs and sausage along with small sides of beans, potato salad and cole slaw.  The brisket is, hands down, the best I've had.  I don't know what they do to it to make it so amazing but it was so freaking good.  I liked the lean better than the fatty, which was still moist and delicious.  The other meats were excellent with my second favorite being the pulled pork.  They also do a great Carolina style sauce which you don't need but it added a nice touch.\\n\\nWe finished with a bourbon banana pie which was wonderful.  The crust was so tasty and I managed to polish it off even though I was in the beginning stages of a meat coma.\\n\\nThe staff is very nice and before the place opens, someone will walk around getting an idea of what people are going to order as well as sell cold drinks.  If you get there before it opens, I highly recommend bringing chairs and an umbrella to block the sun.  Unless you are towards the front of the line, you will be without shade in the parking lot.  \\n\\nYou might be wondering why you have to wait so long to order.  Well, the restaurant is not very big so I think there's a method to their madness and they are controlling the line so hopefully you'll have a place to sit when you get your food.

It wasn't a complete close of a meat patty but rather a host of its own flavors and textures. Very good! Fresh Guac and LTO. My estimated nutrition doesn't exactly make these burgers healthy, but the option to swap for a grilled tempeh patty is a nice way to get more protein. I'll try that next time.\\n\\nFries: Imagine less greasy 5 guys fries. If you like those, you'll probably really like these. I was a fan of the couple fries I tried, but I think a  full order would still be a little too soggy/greasy for me.\\n\\nPickles: Great fried pickles. The inside had a nice crunch and the breading was a nice light crispness. However, just like the fries, A little less oily-ness would be nice.\\n\\nVibe: Like other vegan/healthy type places.

We shared a plate of fried okra.\\n\\nAt four and a half Yelp stars, you'd expect things to be damn near perfect with mind blowing food!

Yes, we'd all had better. \\n*   Is it fair to comment on a small cup of gumbo?  Ours was warm, not hot, and rather thin. We'd all had better (2 stars). \\n*   Both orders of shrimp and grits were lukewarm. Was the saut√©ed shrimp expected to sufficiently heat the cool grits?  Neither diner could taste any cheddar in the grits (2 stars for each).  Again, we'd all had better renditions. \\n*   Our side of gravy was disappointing. The biscuits were ok, but improved with the really good jam (2 stars). \\n*   Bananas Foster French Toast?  It was perfectly acceptable and consistent with expectations (3 stars). \\n*   The Chicken and Waffle came impressively stacked with a steak knife impaling the architecturally challenged layers. We all had a taste. While hot and well seasoned, all felt Pine State's chicken was much better... and that was off their food cart. We'll give Screen Door's version a generous 3 stars. \\n\\nAtmosphere = 3 stars. Mid-week brunch was animated, noisier than expected, but fun. Our 4 top was a bit cramped and our neighbors were very close. Bathrooms were acceptable. Neighborhood parking was easy today. \\n\\nService = 3 stars. Surprisingly, we were seated within 5 minutes.

Nothing to write home about. \\n\\nDoc Platter\\nI choose 3 meats because my eyes are way bigger than my stomach. Ribs, brisket (sliced), and wings (sauce on). The chicken was delicious. Perfect crisp skin, sauce cooked in, and the chicken perfectly made. The sliced brisket was super moist and juicy, I love a good brisket. The ribs were still tender, however after having them deep fried I wanted more of those instead of the non-fried ones. Still delicious and good. The sides were collards, and Mac and cheese.  The Mac and cheese was white people Mac. So not impressive and pretty basic. Someone put their foot in them greens!! They had a good amount of heat, mixed with the perfect vinegar ratio. Superb! \\n\\nWhy 4 stars instead of 5, you may ask. Well it's the south, I need the sweet tea to be on point too. The tea was over brewed and didn't taste fresh, and the sugar ratio was off.

I always felt that this was the genius of the Big Tasty because those 2 toppings were spread evenly for a taste in every bite you took. It really set Tasty Burger apart from the competition. So now for some reason, they've gone and replaced this method with regular run-of-the-mill pickle slices and thin slices of red onions.

We were seated indoors, and the service was very quick. The staff members were friendly and quick to recommend items on the menu, as this was our first time dining here. The brisket was highly recommended, so we both ordered a combo plate to taste the brisket and another meat of our choosing + two sides. He ordered the fatty cut of brisket, wings, Frito pie, and mac and cheese, and I ordered the lean cut of brisket, ribs, collard greens, and mac and cheese. We both preferred the fatty cut of brisket over my lean piece, but overall did not think the brisket lived up to all the hype. We felt the brisket needed sauce and was not quite standalone awesome. It is worth a try though if you're a fan of brisket so you can decide for yourself, in which case I highly recommend the fatty cut. Overall, it was a very taste meal, and we did not leave feeling hungry- especially because we split the delicious banana pudding for dessert! Next time, we will definitely reorder the wings- they were arguably some of the best wings we've ever had, and we've had our fair share of delicious wings.

The waitress was asked about specials and to our surprise and what we found out later, she made up the specials on her own and changed us for each component in the special (fish, crab, sauce, etc...). The special was far from affordable when the check came and when questioned the waitress told us she made up the special and changed for each of the components separately, making for a very expensive special. The fish was billed as a Costa Rican Sea Bass but when it came it was not sea bass but much closer to Mahi Mahi. Whatever it was I have eight people who will testify to the fact that what was ordered wasn't even close to sea bass. We had at least 4 orders in our group and each of our guests would attest to the fact that the fish was not as it was sold. Two in our group ordered chicken and one of the orders was sent back because it was so tough it could not be cut with a steak knife. Most of the two chicken meals were left uneaten.

Clearly this is a very popular spot on Newbury Street, but why was it so loud?! Loud music, loud conversations, plus awful acoustics. UGH! I'm usually pretty tolerant, but this was miserable. The front of the restaurant was open even though it was pretty chilly out. I was relieved when we were seated further inside. Unfortunately, it was not any quieter there. It was impossible to hold a conversation with anyone on the other side of the table. My sister was sitting right next to me, and I basically had to yell every time I wanted to talk to her. It was so loud our waitress had trouble taking our order. We had to point to items on the menu. \\n\\nOur entrees: roasted chicken, seared salmon, grilled trout, and a brick oven pizza. Our food was warm, not hot when it arrived at our table. We all agreed that the food wasn't bad, but nothing really stood out. My taste buds were not wowed. Smaller portions would have allowed us to share an appetizer and/or dessert. Also, it would have been nice if we could actually see what we were eating. That's part of the dining experience. I love candle lit restaurants with a warm glow, but the area we were seated in was too dark. There's romantic candle lit restaurant, then there's dark bar/lounge/club. Sonsie seems to have confused the two. \\n\\nMy sister had just graduated, so we decided to pick out a bottle of (overpriced) wine. We're here to celebrate. Let's splurge a little! The small type on the wine list and the horrible lighting made it difficult for my dad to read the wine list. My sister and I picked something out, and the waitress asked for our IDs. Apparently, Dad being at the table wasn't good enough. Permanent residence cards aka green cards are not acceptable forms of ID here. Seriously?

The chicken was so yummy. The breading was amazing. One thing I didn't like was that the breading easily came off the chicken when you sliced it. The praline bacon was okay, I could make it at home.

I waited 15 minutes and walked back in and the guy had still not contacted groupon.  So I told him cancel the whole order, I am going somewhere else.  He said \\"OK, I will cancel.\\"  When I got home, I contacted groupon via online chat to inform them of the situation and they said that he refused the refund and that the food had been delivered to my house.

I called groupon customer service before going in and the service rep called the guy on three way and when he said Hello this is groupon, who am I speaking with this man's response was \\"Donald Trump, Bleep you!\\" and hung up.

It's reasonably priced and you'll get a good smattering of New York style Sicilian flavors in their pastas, pizzas and specialty dishes.The menu is fairly extensive with several appetizer, salad, sub, pasta and pizza/calzone/stromboli selections.\\n\\nI've had many great meals at Bambinelli's - their pizzas are particularly good, both the deep-dish (be prepared to wait!) and the traditional. If you want the deep dish for lunch, it might be worthwhile to call ahead and get them started on one for you - you'll be glad you did! If you live in Northcrest (howdy neighbors!) Bambinelli's is the best local pizza delivery (in my humble opinion).\\n\\nI would call this type of Italian fair \\"Italian-American\\" or New York style with influences mostly from Southern Italy with the spicier red tomato sauces, but with a smattering of Northern garlic-y cream sauces. Be prepared to get very full (large portions) and the smell of parmesian cheese hits you when you enter. I'd rank this on par with Ippolito's and slightly above Provino's, if you're familiar with either local chain. \\n\\nMost of my friends really love the garlic knots that are served here - I believe it's basically pizza dough covered in garlic butter and herbs - do I have to say more?\\n\\nI'm also very fond of their basic sauces so make sure someone at your table orders the spaghetti with sausage or meat balls. The meat balls are also particularly good here.\\n\\nSeveral of the servers have worked here for many years - it seems every time we go back we still saw familiar faces. There's plenty of parking in this little corner of the world as the lot is mostly empty during evening hours.

Hell, even Anna's may be better. The real question remains, how can you mess us a drink? A blended, ice ridden, daiquiri was what I was served. The salad, not bad, until the meat came, which was like a sponge with jerk flavoring that was too spicy for human consumption (unless you burned them all off at the ripe age of 5) Second, the rub put on the chicken makes it impossible for a human to recognize food underneath the blackened mess. How it is served I will not know. I do know that the drink came in handy after a taste test.\\nThe reason for those 2 stars, the staff was nice and it was fun to look at the walls, the drink, even lacking in luster wasn't bad, the best par:, the salsa (try it sometime with a drink, but nothing else).

They'd probably make me eat a live chicken!\\" -- Steel Magnolias (1989)\\n\\nWell, Chef Kevin, you certainly know what the heck you are doing in the restaurant biz. Holy Southern Feast, y'all! This is the place to come for a killer meal. And all I can say is - Family-style all the way! Highly anticipated by me and my Yelpiest of mates, we were thrilled when just a week after opening, they were able to accommodate 10 of us for a birthday dinner (to celebrate Trevor W.).\\n\\nWhen booking the reservation, as per red beard standards, I was asked about food allergies. Three of the ten of us have major allergies (tree nuts, alcohol and gluten). The woman on the phone noted all three for me. Upon confirmation, I made sure all three were still noted, and we discussed them again upon arrival. Our server, Felicia, was good to explain which dishes I needed to avoid (tree nuts) and which were not okay for the alcohol allergy. For gluten, she was served special dishes when we had gluten in our items (I'm sure she will review).\\n\\nWe were given the dining options and the table opted for Family-style. Each diner picks an entr√©e and dessert and the table is served a couple of hors d'oeurves and five or six \\"trimmings\\" or sides. This option was only $42. How can you not choose this?\\n\\nI started with the Georgia Mint Julep - properly served in a silver julep cup with crushed ice. A lovely combo of bourbon, peach brandy and mint...who knew?! So refreshing and delicious. Had I not been driving, I'd have had at least one more. Before I could finish my drink, our first app arrived - toasted deviled ham tea sandwiches with pickled veggies. Amazing!!! Like the best creamy ham with a kick on toasted brioche. The acidity from the pickled green tomatoes and celery cut thru the rich spread perfectly. Next, a kale and peach salad with artisan cheese. I'm not usually a big kale eater, but I thought about stabbing my mates with my fork to get a bigger helping. No words can tell you how great these flavor said melded. Genius.\\n\\nThey was a gap between apps and entr√©es, but to distract us, out came the most delectable, delightful, killer cornbread you've ever eaten in your lifetime. No joke. Some kind of biscuit/cornbread hybrid. I tried to sweet talk Chef Kevin out of the recipe via Instagram but no dice. This is his Great Grandmother's recipe and he is sworn to protect it. Oh well, I'll just move into Revival. So...I ordered a second round ($1 each, y'all...worth it). Once the entr√©es came out, the table was overloaded with side dishes and plates.\\n\\nPeople, listen. I tried the meatloaf (my dish), fried chicken and quail. All winners in my book. That chicken is THE absolute best I have ever had. Moist (juice dripping down your arms), crispy crust, but not heavy. The meatloaf (albeit some commented it was salty), was moist, tender, with a hint of sweetness from the glaze and saltiness from the bacon wrap. I didn't feel it was salty at all. The quail was also tender and rich - I would order it.\\n\\nSides - all fabulous. Tops in my book were the butterbeans (OMG) and the corn (nothing better than silver queen). The cabbage was good, but probably my least favorite and it was still delicious. Mac and cheese was also on point. By the time dessert rolled around, I needed a second stomach. But I pressed on. I opted for the chocolate cake and I was not disappointed. Soft and creamy dark chocolate frosting perfectly complimented the dense yet light and moist chocolate cake. It was so rich I had to bring half of it home. Luckily I had ordered coffee - and wow! Turns out the coffee is a personal Jittery Joes blend from Chef Kevin. Kudos, sir. By far, the winner on the dessert menu was the Lemon Ice Box Pie - and we ordered everything. Light, tart, refreshing, yet somehow just rich enough to feel decadent.\\n\\nOverall, the service was excellent. Felicia was on top of mostly everything. A couple of small things were missed/forgotten, but with a table of 10 and 2nd week being open, it was still great. She was pretty soft-spoken which is tough in a louder restaurant when talking to a long table. Again, she managed well. Keeping allergies managed and still having my best meal of 2015 - that's a 10 in my book. I'll be back again and again.

The BBQ is really amazing. The thing that set it apart for me was the seasoning and flavor of the brisket. I mean most places can make really moist juicy brisket if they know what they are doing, but at Franklin, I think it's the combination of the smoke flavors and seasoning they put on the brisket that makes me say \\"wow\\". Of course it is all perfectly cooked and moist, etc., but that is just the baseline for entering the best brisket in Texas conversation. I also think that the type of meat he uses is higher quality than other places...it doesn't hurt to start out with better ingredients from the get go.\\n\\nDefinitely don't order it to go and eat it later.

We definitely will return, however we will be more selective in our choices due to the service we received last night. Nothing was comped, and no manager ever came to see us to apologize.

It is sometimes hard to get into, but if you manage to get a table be ready for the best guacamole and tequila Disney has to offer.\\n\\nI forced friends of mine to stop during a visit to Epcot. Everyone was tired and worn out from a day in the parks. I explained this place was worth it. With much cajoling and a promise of paying for the first round we walked in. \\n\\nIt wasn't busy for a change. I quickly ordered guacamole, margaritas, and a flight of tequila. Almost immediately my friends understood what I was talking about. This place is about relaxing. I will say the tables are very close together, but in a way that is a good thing. We struck up friendly conversations with the tables around us. (This always happens, but it adds to the charm of the place).\\n\\nThis is not a place to rush into and rush out of. It is just a nice place to sit back and enjoy. The service is fast and friendly. Due to the size of the place and the tight seating it may be difficult for large groups or families with strollers to find comfortable, but small groups, couples, and even individuals will love this place. It is pricey, but remember you are in Epcot.\\n\\nMy friends have all returned home and after a week at Disney they all say this place was one of the best places they went during their whole trip.

The decor overall is quite modern and rustic compared to your average taqueria - a little pricier too - their lunch entrees range from $7 - $11 and their tapas options start at about $9. I'd say the food is well worth the price, great presentation and of course hella tasty!\\n\\nAnother contributing factor to such a great experience was the service; Our waiter, Kevin was great and just such a cool guy in general. After Kevin finished giving us the 411 on La Urbana, the boyfriend jokingly snarked that his family's from Mexico and that he's a tough critic on Mexican restaurants.  When he brought the BF his beer - a Tecate - he had it completely souped up, traditional style! I've never seen a beer look so good, the can was rimmed with salt, hot sauce neatly poured on the lid with a lime peeking out of the spout. Kevin mentioned that he asked the bartender to prepare the beer specially, it's not the way it's usually served but always available upon request.  The entire duration of our meal we didn't have a want or need for anything - Kevin also offered us several suggestions regarding condiments and seasoning that made the food taste all the better, and he even brought out the dinner menu just in case we didn't see anything we liked on the lunch menu.\\n\\nAll together we ordered the ceviche, three different tacos, their enchiladas with mole, and the crepas de pollo (basically enchiladas in a cheese sauce). We were also served a complimentary shot (prior to our entrees) of their \\"Jugo de Carne\\" which is basically a flavored beef broth -  a little odd, but I liked the flavor. I really enjoyed everything we ordered, especially the enchiladas with mole - that mole was dee.licious, smooth and full flavored, borderline chocolatey - and that's definitely a positive. The tacos are a bit too pricey ($3.50 -$4 a la carte), but still tasty - particularly the 'Tinga' - and nicely garnished and seasoned.\\n\\nLa Urbana is without a doubt one of my favorite opeinings thus far in 2014, I hope it's here to stay!"},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Very good place to eat but the wait sticks, but that's the price you pay for a good meal.

And that wait gave us plenty of time to ogle the menu, debating about what to order because everything looked so good. Although this place is highly reviewed and always busy, the atmosphere was pleasant but casual; not stuffy or snooty. My friends and I decided to order several dishes and share everything family style. We had mimosas, the burnside brandy milk punch, the fried chicken & waffle, brioche vanilla bean french toast, the golden yeasted waffle, eggs (we asked for it with onions and bell peppers, and they gladly obliged), a buttermilk biscuit, chicken & apple sausage, praline bacon, and lemon ricotta griddle cakes off the special menu. We initially asked for 2 orders of the chicken & waffles, but settled on 1 after the waiter advised us 1 order was plenty, since all the dishes were pretty large. Even so, every inch of our table was covered when the food arrived, so we set to clearing the dishes for them to take away before the last 2 dishes came. We DEVOURED this meal. We must have looked like a hungry pack of wolves, and I'm surprised we didn't finish every scrap of food, it was so good. The fried chicken was amazing--so tender and crispy with just the right amount of spice. Probably the best fried chicken I've ever had in my life (sorry Ezell's). The sweet potato waffle was good but I'm not sure the sweet potato flavor was very noticeable. The brioche vanilla bean french toast was good but not amazing. Same goes for the golden waffle (well...it's a waffle). The biscuit was flaky and delicious. The chicken & apple sausage was lovely. The lemon ricotta griddle cakes were served with fresh blueberries and they were sooo delicious. I want to find a recipe like it to make at home. And the praline bacon was sinfully good. I could sense my arteries clogging with every bite but it was so frickin' worth it. And I'm usually not a big fan of bacon. But the slices were so thick and tender (I don't like crispy bacon), and the salty/sweet combo was to die for.

It was like a slice of life in Atlanta. The place is a little gritty and had so much heart. We arrived for a late lunch. It was pouring rain but that didn't stop the customers from coming. There was always a stream of customers going in and out. They have outdoor seating and we chose to sit outside for some fresh air. Before our food was delivered to our table a homeless man came up to us and asked us for any leftovers he could have for when we were done. He lingered on the outdoor patio as patrons ate their barbecue in hopes of something to eat. He didn't bother anyone. Before we were even finished with our meal a worker came out and handed the guy a bag of food. The dripping wet homeless man sat down and was able to eat a sandwich, a bag of chips, and drink a soda. That was really nice of Fat Matt's. They didn't even ask him to leave. They just let him eat.\\n\\nOur meal was really good, better than I expected. And we left no leftovers. We got half rack of ribs, 1/4th chicken, cole slaw, collard greens, mac and cheese, and \\"rum\\" baked beans. I don't usually get chicken from barbecue places but since there was no brisket I wanted something as an alternative to just eating ribs. The chicken was so soft and tasted so good with the barbecue sauce! All the sides were delicious and the cole slaw turned out to be a surprising star. It had a hint of sweetness and great crunch.\\n\\nTo top things off on our way out, we were offered a to go drink. So sweet tea it was! What a nice parting gift. But more so I will always remember them giving food to the homeless man."},{"name":"Flat Patties","address":"33 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Thanks to my Yelp friend Melissa M.

Loads of noodles and garnishes which is a plus. The first few bites were good but I thought it was much too salty much too soon. I ate about half the bowl and wasn't too impressed soon after.

I would say that the food is elevated bar food for the most part, with some shining stars. I'm a huge fan of the soft pretzel, the buffalo chicken sandwich and the quinoa chicken wrap (which I just had for the first time). The quinoa chicken wrap is a great option if you want something tasty but still relatively healthy. \\n\\nIf you're looking for a lively, casual place with good food, I'd highly recommend Cypress Street."},{"name":"Mario's Restaurant","address":"347 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Mario's was a pleasant surprise!

It is clean  and well kept in the restaurant area - (including the bathrooms).  We were able to be seated immediately.  The problem was - the buffet food that was supposed to be hot - was only luke-warm.  That is - the fish fingers, shrimp, rice, mashed potatoes - everything that should at least be solidly warm/hot was not and made me wonder if I (or my 4 children) was/were going to get food poisoning.  The grilled meats were also quite good, particularly the steak and sausages, but again, they were only luke warm.  For 6 of us, including water, milk, soda and a beer - it was only $50.

The service was fast and friendly. Our waiter made sure we were happy with everything. I would say it could be a little more aesthetically pleasing here.

This neat hole-in-the-wall style place has taken Austin by storm and by the looks of it, shows no signs of letting up.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I ventured over to this place on a Thursday for our date night, and I was worried that by 7:00, they would be out of ramen and we would both be cranky and hungry. Thankfully, that wasn't the case. We waited for about 20 minutes before our orders were taken, and about 3 minutes after that, we were seated at the end of a long table.\\n\\nNOTE: The seating is kind of strange, so if you don't like being close to other people... Find a table for two (good luck!).\\n\\nEverything I consumed that night blew me away. We started off with the Munchie Katsu Slider, and boy, was that good. For being just a hamburger patty that has Panko crumbs on it, the moist texture and delicate appearance of it made it an incredible thing to try. It's a tad pricey at $4, but worth every single penny.\\n\\nThe ramen I got was the #1: Tonkotsu Original. The first thing they suggest you do after getting your bowl is to taste the broth and let that lather your mouth up for the food to come. I highly recommend that you follow those instructions! Although the broth is very heavy, the flavor is nothing short of extraordinary. The pork belly was a very delicate cut and nearly melted in my mouth. It wasn't close to the oily, fatty mess you'd think it would be. Even more surprisingly, me and my girlfriend's favorite part of the dish was the soft boiled egg. Never before had I had a soft boiled egg that was so full of flavor and so delicate! It complimented the dish well and I ended up wishing that I had gotten an extra egg with my meal.\\n\\nThe food was so delightful that I almost forgot to enjoy what I was eating. As my girlfriend and I finished eating, we noticed that the line had only grown in the hour that we had been there. It seemed that we had beat the dinner rush, but just barely. I recommend that you come early and prepare to wait for at least 20 minutes. Having a granola bar in your pocket or purse won't kill you, but it might help make the wait seem a bit shorter.\\n\\nI will definitely be headed back here for another wonderful bowl of ramen!"},{"name":"Ward 8","address":"90 N Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Fun cocktails and great atmosphere.

I had the Winner Winner Chicken Dinner and the best part of the meal was the radicchio salad.\\nThe chicken was slightly on the dry side.  There was so little flavor even in the skin, I am wondering why there is so much excitement about it, especially for $12!! I tried the saffron sauce (extra $0.50) with it and that too, was far too subtle.  Perhaps it's my palette.  Perhaps it's the soft launch and they are still working out the kinks.  I don't know.  But the meal wasn't worth it.\\nNow, I am very pleased that there are a number of Toro Bravo items also on the menu and a wide variety of wines, beers and cocktails.\\nThe overall Pine St. Market space is awesome!!
