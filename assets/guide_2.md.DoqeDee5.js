When I took my youngest in to use the restroom I saw how beautiful the interior was, and how it's just like a really large, beautiful home.  The server brought out some of the biscuits and cornbread muffins and both were some of the best I've had in recent memory!  We ordered the fried green tomatoes & the smoked pork belly and both were just okay. The tomatoes are stuffed with goat cheese, but the flavor was very mild; I think they could have stepped it up a notch in the seasoning department.  The pork belly was pretty good, as it had a slightly sweet flavor from the honey they use.  For entrees we had the fried chicken, catfish, she crab soup, and chicken fingers for the little one.  Again, everything was pretty good.  The chicken was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, the catfish was decent, but could have stood about another 30 seconds in the fryer, and the she crab soup was made really well, but it's tough to have an entire bowl of it.  \\n\\nI think this is definitely a place to visit in Atlanta for both residents and visitors.

They agreed to seat us early, but clearly stated that a server would NOT be by to get our drink order since 75% of the party wasn't there yet. So we ordered our fabulous margaritas from the downstairs bar, which would have been a nice $14 to add to our server's check avg. \\n\\nThe other funny thing that happened was the food runner left our tray, full of food, at our table and walked off. The food sat there for a good minute when we decided to serve ourselves. Our server was so embarrased. I think their service has good intentions, but they don't communicate well with each other. For example, when our server came by and we told her that we ordered our drinks from the bar because according to the hostess, she couldn't take our order yet, she seemed very annoyed. \\n\\nI will end on a positive note since they have a great atmosphere (I don't recommend bringing children there) and the food is decent.

I would recommend House of Blues for a casual and relatively inexpensive night at Disney Springs.

From burgers (the bacon + gorgonzola burger, yum!), to sandwiches (grilled cheese with tomato soup is fabulous on a rainy day), to pasta (chicken yakisoba is flavorful and filling), they really have it all - just don't expect a single genre.  Preparation is influenced from all over the world and they have an ever changing - full page - specials menu to keep it interesting.  Desert menu (thankfully) isn't all about chocolate, so recommend saving room (especially for the carrot cake!).  Flavors, quality and portions are solid, yet there isn't anything that wows me.\\n\\nHappy hour has some good deals ($2.95 each), but doesn't have enough ambiance to draw me just for this.\\n\\nSERVICE:  Friendly and attentive without being intrusive.  \\n\\nLOCATION:  Has a parking lot, that fills quickly even when the restaurant isn't at capacity (apparently no one carpools in the suburbs) and parking is not allowed on the street in front.  This has made me go elsewhere twice.  Interior is simple, bordering on needing to be updated and clean.

Pallokaville's carnival branding is a creative and interesting theme. We arrived around 5:30 pm on a Saturday--waited approximately 20 minutes for a table. Once seated, we ordered drinks from a wide variety of choices, all reasonably priced. The food menu is limited in its selection: corn dogs, hot dogs, pork burgers (other reviews rave about the pork burger, may be worth a try), deli sandwiches, French fries. \\n\\nFirst, we ordered two pastrami sandwiches: no pastrami. Then, we ordered two corned beef sandwiches: no corned beef. Third, we ordered chicken salad: no chicken salad. *UGH*. I understand this is a relatively new restaurant, however, with the extremely limited menu the food inventory could be better managed--especially since it wasn't technically during peak dinner hours. In the end, we ordered a variety of hot dogs, corn dogs and seasoned fries. While the kids were largely satisfied with a meal equivalent to a Sonic drive-thru, the adults, weren't. The hot dogs are served plain (yes, plain) on a bun--no toppings, no gourmet accoutrements: plain old plain. Sure there's mustard and 'home made' ketchup on the table, but that's it. Overall, Pallookaville was a disappointment mostly because its menu is more suited for a food cart (or a carnival or a circus), not a fully realized restaurant. I am more than willing to give this place some time to develop, however, I  won't return for dinner anytime soon. If I want to eat hot dogs and French fries I can take the family to Skip's just down the street from Pallookaville. \\n\\nBottom line: if you live close or find yourself in the area, Pallookaville may be worth a try; however, if you plan on driving great distances to try this place, you're probably better off staying home or heading to Decatur because there are so many better choices. This is a 'one and done' type of joint. \\n\\nOther:\\n\\nHours: posted on Facebook; however, call ahead (don't expect the phone to be answered right away) because opening times vary greatly. \\n\\nCustomer service: Hit-or-miss; the owner is there and will come to your table if you ask for condiments only to tell you what's on the table is what's available (forget standard ketchup, theres some 'home made tomato concoction which is, um, terrible) . \\n\\nParking: nearly non-existent (surprising, since downtown Avondale Estates is, for the most part, vacant).\\n\\nWait time for table (5:30 pm): 25 minutes.\\n\\nOnce seated, wait staff arrival time: 15 minutes (seemed a bit disorganized; wait staff wasn't covering tables properly)\\n\\nOrder to table time: 35 minutes (a bit long considering we ordered only corn dogs, hot dogs and drinks."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Brunch food was unappetizing and unappealing.

My friend and I met some great people in line who made the time pass quickly and made the experience a great time. As everyone will tell you, get there EARLY! Especially if you plan to go on a weekend. We went on a Tuesday which I will recommend if you can make it on a weekday. We were able to secure a great spot on line at 9:00 am, and waited just shy of 3 hours to be served. \\n\\nThere are chairs that are available to borrow but will go quickly, so bring your own if you can.The CVS down the street sells chairs for $15 a pop (no blankets, towels or any other options) so thats an option if you mind sitting on the floor. \\n\\nOnce inside, you'll feel a collective giddiness as you approach the line and watch everyone else eating at the tables. Be prepared to place your order by the pound and be served on a paper-lined tray. I am not a person who likes fatty meat, but the man who served us gave us brisket samples to thank us for waiting and I got to try some fatty brisket. After tasting it, I changed my order to mixed brisket and was glad that I did. I tried the pork, brisket and ribs which were all some of the best I've had. If i had to rank them, i'd say brisket, pork then ribs. Our line friends were so kind to give us some sausage to try and it was awesome as well. The sides were alright, can't complain but you also don't come to Franklin's for the sides. We tried the texas pecan pie to finish and ended up eating it on the plane back to New York to the flight attendants' obvious envy. I ordered 2 pounds of meat total which was definitely too much but now I have leftovers for days so i wouldn't consider it a loss. \\n\\nWhen asking locals for their barbecue suggestions, the overwhelming response is usually Franklin's.

As soon as our drinks arrived we asked to pay - we were going to order lunch but changed our minds given how long it took for the drinks - but the waitress never came back w/ our bill so we went to the bar and asked to pay but the bartender couldn't take our payment and had to track down the waitress... Usually bartenders can access the entire restaurant's tabs or at least find a manager who can but not in this case and the waiting game continued.  Granted it was a beautiful Sat afternoon, but there were still tables and seats avail both at the bar and on the patio, so the place was not at capacity. And even if it were full, did management not think to staff properly for a weekend where 70 degree weather was expected? Where was the manager on duty anyway? The waitresses could certainly have used his/ her help to run drinks and take patrons' payment. You'd think that running up tabs and turning over tables would be a priority for The Time but the waitresses seemed completely un-phased by the crowd on the patio and from their nonchalance you'd think there were two customers in the entire place. They moved at a snail's pace. In the time it took us to order one round, drink it, and pay our tab we could have had lunch and several rounds elsewhere.

She rolled her eyes at her manager after we ordered. Very poorly trained/bad staff. Not a place I would return. So now for how it tasted, bland.

I'm doing it for a hot guy; or 2.) The restaurant was crowned Best Barbecue in the US by Bon App√©tit magazine, and both friends and family felt it was virtually a requirement for me to go and report back. (Hint: It was #2, although #1 sounds so nice all of a sudden).\\n\\nI swung by my dad's office downtown to pick him up, and he informed me my brother Neal and his fiancee Lisa were already at Franklin, third in line and waiting for us. It was 9:30. None of what I'm doing is making sense so far. \\n\\nFortunately for me, I was able to park right outside the restaurant. We walked up and took a seat on the patio and began the waiting game. Thank God for cooler weather this morning, otherwise I don't know if this would have been feasible. \\n\\nPeople began to arrive in droves and that's when Lisa took action. Around 10:00 AM, she stood up, and much to my surprise asked everyone if we could start moving towards forming a discernible line. Before, essentially, the place became a clusterf**k. It sounded like a reasonable suggestion, and most people cheerfully acquiesced. Except for a large woman who I'll call Tons of Fun, who was one of the last to arrive before the line formed and sat squarely on the patio. She rather vocally said that no one needed to form a line, and we should all just sit down because \\"no one here is in the business of cuttin' in line.\\" She made quite the scene. We'll get back to her. The hour in line was spent listening to a few young men talk non-stop about different barbecue joints, and about 50 or more people arriving in a line that began to snake towards the parking lot. Jesus, people, it's barbecue; they aren't handing out suitcases of cash. \\n\\nAt 10:30, a young woman from inside came out to take brisket estimates. I think she gave up, knowing they'd sell out anyway. \\n\\n11:00 rolled around, and we all geared up. And that's when Tons of Fun and her husband cut in line. Yes, the woman who loudly pontificated that we should just sit back and trust the goodness of people ended up being the perpetrator herself. And you know what? I'm not surprised in the slightest.\\n\\nWe sat indoors and Dad came back with a heaping tray comprised of a pound of moist brisket, a pound of lean brisket, a pound of pork ribs, and (4) sausage links. I never drink Big Red...unless it's in a bottle, which they have along with bottles of Coca-Cola and Dr. Pepper. (Tip: Do what my dad did and buy extra meat to take back to work; I'm sure the office will appreciate it. They usually sell out by 12:30 or 1:00, so if you're there, you are the go-to guy or gal for everyone else.)\\n\\nThe $64,000 question: Was it truly hip, or all hype? Well, let's look at this, shall we? The brisket was melt in your mouth tender, especially since we got the juiciest cut of the meat. Thoughts of The Salt Lick or The County Line fell away as easily as the meat on the pork ribs; the bone was largely ceremonial. It fell off. Just...fell off, sometimes with only a mere touch. The sausage was better than any sausage I've had before, either at a barbecue place or off the grill. Even the coleslaw was terrific, with big hunks of red cabbage in a light flavorful dressing. Their BBQ sauce was sweet and delicious. \\n\\nMy dad announced after his first brisket sandwich that he would speak to the owner about having Neal and Lisa's pre-wedding dinner moved to Franklin in lieu of the Salt Lick. This would be perfect for our out-of-town guests, as well as keeping with their wedding theme of supporting only local businesses. I'm down. \\n\\nBBQ has never topped my list of foods I pine after, although I've certainly had my share growing up in Texas. I claim no expertise, however, and I feel this is appropriate considering the unfathomable tensions, opinions, and competition surrounding the bloodsport that is barbecue. Some of you I love and respect may disagree with me on Franklin, and that is OK by me. I can only say that as a neutral observer not prone to mob mentality or easily swayed by fancy-schmancy food reviews, that this really was some excellent barbecue. And to this point, the best that *I've* had. \\n\\nSo: was it worth the wait? Yes. Is it worth the wait in the future? Yes. Will people cut in line? Yes. Are people intrinsically insane when it comes to food, especially barbecue? Hell yes.\\n\\n5 Stars for Franklin.

This alone should have been enough to keep me away from this pathetic excuse for a restaurant.\\n\\nI had gotten a P'zone there a long time ago, and it was absolutely terrible. And I love Pzones from normal Pizza Huts, but this location is so terrible compared to others that I must say it isn't worth going to at all.  The guy who was preparing it wasn't wearing gloves and smelled like BO really bad. Very comforting. \\n\\nSo god knows why I decided to go back here again... I think it was the commercial that said \\"Any pizza for 10$!\\" that drove me to the point of \\"Eh, I'll give them another chance.\\" \\n\\nSo I call in my order, 1 large Sausage, Pepper, and Onion pizza. I get the typical \\"15 minutes\\" response from a guy whose first language probably isn't English. He didn't even ask me for my name, just my phone number. So I head down to Pizza Hut, getting there 25 minutes after I placed my order, figuring it wouldn't be just 15 minutes. I walk in and wait at the counter for literally 5 minutes before anyone even approaches me. The guy who answered the phone comes to the counter, and I ask for my pizza. He asks me my name, which I tell him, and then he looks around frantically for the pizza, in places that the pizza wouldn't even be (back counters, weird places). Then he asks me what I got, and I repeat \\"sausage, pepper, and onions.\\" He says it will be ready in a minute. 10 minutes pass, and the line inside this tiny pizza hut begins to grow. He makes some guy who came in at least 10 minutes after me some wings and that guy goes in and out nice and easy. Even though I called in my order, it was supposed to be done in 15 minutes, and I had already waited 45, this guy gets served before me. Real cool.\\n\\nHe manages to mess up another guys order while I'm there, who I begin to talk to. This guy tried to call in an order for delivery but the guy on the phone couldn't understand the clear and well spoken english, so he couldn't get the guys address. So the guy who placed the order came to pick it up and the Pizza Hut employee had no record of his order, or his phone #, or his name. So about 5 or 6 people are waiting in there, and you hear literally nothing going on \\"in the back\\" where they are supposed to be making pizza. A phone is ringing unanswered, the space shot cashier/manager/whatever is being absolutely useless. Every single customer has an extremely difficult time interacting with this guy and almost every order is extremely hard to get this guy to take... he keeps asking weird questions or has trouble placing the order. Finally, I get back into the line, ask where my pizza is, which I've seen it sitting in one of those warming racks for like 5 minutes now. The guy says it isnt ready and I said check that one in the warming rack. Viola, it WAS my pizza. \\n\\nBy now it's been nearly an hour, and I open the box when I get into my car to see a crappy, frozen looking pizza. I am not exaggerating when I say that this looks like something that came from a box of Celeste microwave pizza. The sausages looked like miniature dog leavings (s***), the peppers and onions were minced so small that you could barely tell if they were really peppers and onions or food color altered newspaper. And you couldn't tell by the taste, either. The crust sucked; very bland yet covered in a greasy buttery substance that I am sure I'll regret eating later. \\n\\nOverall, I would never return to this place. The pizza was terrible and wasn't even worth the 10$ I paid for it. And the customer service was the absolute worst customer service experience I think I have ever had at any restaurant, ever. Not only did it take them nearly an hour to make me a microwave pizza I could have made in 3 minutes, they said it'd only take 15 minutes and made me wait around for it. I contemplated leaving many times during my wait inside the store, and after eating the pizza, I realize I would have been better off if I had. Make the right choice, eat anywhere, and I mean anywhere, before you eat here. Try the gutter in front of the store, you may find something more appetizing.\\n\\nEdit: OH!

After much debate at our table, I still don't think it's possible for one person to eat that much calzone.  It was bigger and had more toppings stuffed inside than was on the aforementioned pizza.  My boyfriend got a sandwich which he enjoyed, but thank god he got the half size, I can't imagine what we would have done with a larger sandwich.  The half was plenty big.\\n\\nWe got pretzels, but they were very salty and overly buttery.  I wish there were more appetizers -- this place is all about the dough.  For pizza crust, it was good, but good luck finding something there low carb.  And how do you not have cheese sauce for pretzels?  What kind of dimension are you working in, Mellow Mushroom?  I overheard the waiter say they had new management, so you never know what the future holds, but today it held no beer.  They can't serve any until the TABC license gets switched or something like that.\\n\\nI know it's a chain and I guess the novelty of the subculture it alludes to as well as the trippy decor is what lures folks in.

There is complimentary corn bread served with jams and a whipped butter (I think it was cinnamon or brown sugar). It's standard, nothing special. The empanada, on the other hand, was amazing. I'm not a big fan of plantains but it tasted like a warm apple pie with a smooth, rich plantain filling. The crust was crisp and it was just the right amount of sweetness. I definitely recommend getting this! The huevos rancheros were also great. The sunny side up eggs were spot on and I liked that they used a bean puree between the tortillas instead of whole beans so it was easier to eat. The creamy scrambled eggs had cheese and chorizo chunks in it and as promised, it was very creamy. It's a great spin on traditional scrambled eggs. The coffee is a bit weak, but it was complimentary so I can't complain.\\n\\nOne downside is that the restaurant is so busy that they barely cleared our plates between courses. The empty cornbread basket and small plates sat there, along with our empanada plates, until the end of the meal.

Would have been an easy 5 stars if not for a couple of small issues... a couple of the \\"hot\\" buffet items were not very hot. I think possibly the sterno ran out and hadn't got changed, it happens and even cool it tasted great. The other issue was service... our waitress was very nice, just a bit forgetful. We had two sets of tongs dropped to the floor, she did stop and said she would bring some back but we never saw them. We received a refill on our drinks only as we were finishing up, and she just didn't seem overly focused on us. Overall it was a very good experience and if back in the area(on vacation from Ohio) there's a very good chance this will be a regular stop. Oh yeah, one other thing... hopefully the management reads these... when you go to a Brazilian steakhouse you assume you're going to pay a premium for a premium experience but when you're paying that much the least you could get is a free refill.

Once you are seated and place your desired drink orders, you can go to the salad bar, acquire your plate, and pick from a variety of side dishes buffet style before sitting back down. This is where the excitement begins.\\n\\nOnce you have seated yourself with a plate, and have flipped over the paper coin with the \\"Yes Please\\" side up, servers with numerous varieties of meat and different cuts will pass by your table and inform you of what they have to offer and if you would like a slice. Best part, you get to pick how well done you want your cut and the servers are incredibly friendly and helpful!\\n\\nAfter experiencing this \\"meat gauntlet\\" having sampled a diverse selection of meats and numerous cuts, such as; excellently seared Rib Eye, to an amazingly flavorful and tender Flank Stake, you will be left fully satiated.\\n\\nOne thing to keep in mind, Nelore Churrascaria is very fast paced. While it is very easy to still carry out a meaningful dinner conversation and enjoy a relaxed evening, once you adjust to the atmosphere, it is very easy to be overwhelmed by the Brazilian Steak House concept of service, which directly challenges all of our conventional dining experience to date.\\n\\nOverall, I highly recommend Nelore Churrascaria. Every cut of meat I had was perfectly cooked and was bursting with a complimenting flavor profile. You won't need to add any steak sauce to these cuts!"},{"name":"Dark Horse","address":"2922 Baseline Rd","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Went there for lunch today and had the burger madness cheese burger with pasta salad and an extra patty. You can get a burger for $4.89 and cheese adds another .50. The menu advertised 100% beef burgers but I was not so sure about that, the patties tasted almost like meatloaf(added fillers) and had a slight rancid flavor. The pasta salad was good, tasted homemade and was fresh. It seems that they have spent some effort in getting rid of the urine smell when you first walk in like I experienced the last time I was here. This bar has been around a long time and it looks like it. It needs a facelift and re-decorate/deep clean badly. Nothing has changed since I first stepped into this bar 30 years ago except mild changes in the seating arrangement and video game areas. It is what it is, a college dive bar with cheap drink specials for the drinking newbies. Wouldn't take my kids there, kitchen cleanliness was questionable from what you can see through the ordering window. The overhead grease grates looked like they haven't been cleaned in quite awhile(old moldy grease dripping on cooking burgers yuk) It was a dive back in the day and still is today."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Finally made the pilgrimage over to east 11th to try the legendary Aaron Franklin's BBQ.

The rest of the staff was great as well. Now on to the food: amazeballs. The brisket was melt in your mouth good, and the turkey was among the best I've had (BBQ or otherwise).. Espresso bbq sauce was tasty, but almost superfluous when paired with the super moist meats. Sides were good, beans being our favorite. We also sampled 2 pies (banana & lemon, made by Cake & Spoon) which were delicious as well. Bottom line, check out Franklin's.

I was skeptical again when I saw that I would have to order my burger from a window by the kitchen instead of from a waitress, but then I realized because of that I wouldn't *have to* tip a full 20%. Nice. (if you have read my other reviews, you may be beginning to notice a pattern that value factors into my food enjoyment)\\n\\nOnce I got my burger and had the first bite, however, I wanted to tip the chef. Amazing. Perfect size/thickness, perfect texture, perfect consistency and flavor, just the right amount of toppings, tasty bun and mmmmmm all around amazing burger. Way better than I could make at home, which is actually pretty rare (I make great burgers, what can I say). I even liked the fries! And I'm not a fan of fries. \\n\\nSo, for giving me pretty much the best burger experience I've ever had, I have to give the Dark Horse 5 stars.

Apparently a lot of folks think so. I can't quite drink the Koolaid.\\n\\nI'll grant there wasn't a single dry bite in the fatty brisket - even the bark melts in your mouth. Nice, yes, but I found myself wishing that bark had some hint of firmness or texture - which just goes to show there's no pleasing some people, I suppose. The meat on the pork ribs clung to the bone to the perfect degree but I kept longing for a tiny tease of sweetness that would push me into a state of total ecstasy. The pulled pork, though - THAT was easily the best I've ever had. Fingers dipped into various sauce offerings yielded nods, but I have an indifference to barbecue sauce that only a native Texan is likely to possess.\\n\\nIf this were an undiscovered or under-loved place I'd be ranting and raving and five stars wouldn't be nearly enough.

What we ordered: cheese and mushroom fondue, fried chicken, pork chop, beets, fried green tomato casserole, mac and cheese and lemon ice box pie.  The waiter was a professional but pushy.  I thought he was making suggestions but then I figured out he was just up-selling.  Everything was SUPER salty.   The mushroom fondue-  luke warm with rye bread that was toasted just enough to make it feel stale but none of that nice dark brown crunch.  Fondue is supposed to be melted cheese so I'm thinking it should be at least warm but it was tepid. The fried green tomato casserole could have been really good but the tomatoes were hard as rocks.  I was expecting more a fried green tomato texture.  Mac and cheese was super salty and the beets were just beets.  I love beets but these weren't sweet and not flavored at all. The fried chicken was very salty but the texture was perfect and amazingly tender.  My pork chop was tough as hide. I only ate half of it and we didn't touch the beets.  The waiter noticed and asked if we didn't like them.  We said no not really and he said he was bringing us a dessert to make up for the pork chop.  I didn't want dessert. He could have brought me a giant basket of corn bread though and I would have been happier.  Wow.   My dinner mate ended up taking the dessert home. I was expecting more?

The only one that wasn't great was the one I picked. I love a restaurant that knows how to give recommendations.\\n\\nThe staff goes well with the decor. It's an old school bar, filled with dark wood. It feels clean and comfortable, but from another time. I appreciate that they only play Ohio music and the music choices were good.

The beers were at the expensive end of average, around $5 each.\\n\\nI didn't eat any sides, only hot dogs, but I liked what I tasted. The meat itself was a nice hot dog. Obviously, it's a cheap meat to begin with, but i had a bite that was pure meat and it tasted great. Here, toppings are king. My bartender recommended the BLT dog. Wrapped in bacon for a juicy dog, the tomato and lettuce really complement the taste. He also recommended the Hot Bollywood dog. The only topping is a spicy, sweet mango chutney that worked perfectly. \\n\\nI decided to get the Pittsburgh dog, which had french fries and cole slaw. This is the only hot dog that wasn't great. The buns here are thick and tasty, but combining them with french fries made for a bland, starchy undercurrent. The cole slaw was tasty, but it has a cooling effect on food. The end result was a little tasteless. A little bit of hot on this dog might lift it up. It wasn't bad at all, but I would never order it again.\\n\\nI left the Chicago dog for last. I have never had a hot dog in Chicago. I don't know what the authentic Chicago hot dog should be. This hot dog was stellar. The sweet pickle worked perfectly against the sour in the mustard and onion. The celery salt brought out the meat. It tasted wonderful. I highly recommend it.\\n\\nMy total bill for 4 hot dogs and two beers was about $30 after tax and tip. That's a little expensive, but I was still happy after the experience.

The waffles have a nice fluff and the syrup is like a river of the word \\"dope\\" liquefied. I wish I lived in Oregon so that I could regularly visit and try everything on the menu because the flavors are very rich. They season things well and I'm a sucker for some well seasoned potatoes. This restaurant was at first a place so hyped up by my buddies that I went in with an extremely hesitant and extremely immature mindset of \\"There's gotta be something to not like,\\" but the place charmed me over instantly. I think the only downside was that there are two bathrooms but only 1 toilet in each bathroom which means the lines are going to be a bit long, but thats nothing my bladder hasn't experienced before! A+ breakfast joint.\\n\\nEDIT: With a place this popular, the wait time may be extremely graining, but its worth it and the staff are attentive and communicate well.

They run out of food, so you don't wanna wait hours just to be told that they don't have any more food for you. \\n\\nI think around 9am, someone comes out and asks you what you are going to order.

I got the lean cut, but there was still fat on it. The fat was SO good! It just melted in your mouth. I usually don't like to eat fat on anything, but WOW. I'm missing out. I wonder how the regular cut was.  The sausage was A-OK. Sausage is pretty much the same everywhere in my opinion. The slaw was good, too. Not as creamy as other places, so that's a plus! The sauces on the table were good too. There was a standard BBQ and two other sauces. I'm not sure what they were because I'm not well-versed in BBQ terms, but the one that was in the middle in terms of color and viscosity was my favorite! They can give it to you to-go!\\n\\nService was great! I didn't expect much service after we got seated because it's pretty much self-serve. You line up, order, get your food, pay, and seat yourself.

As anyone who reads my reviews knows, I am not a big fan of restaurants at which one cannot arrive hungry because it takes so long to obtain any food, nor am I enamored of arrogant places that are so proud of their food that they make you feel as if they could care less about your business.  Screen Door is exactly both of those things.  Pity, that.\\n\\nThe portions at Screen Door are huge, the quality of the ingredients is generally above average, and many of the dishes are very well prepared.  Favorites like the towering fried chicken and sweet potato waffle have to be seen to be believed, and the cajun scramble is no slouch either.  Even basic stuff like bread and burgers are way above average in quality, but not in price.  If you like enormous piles of Southern-inspired grub at very reasonable prices, Screen Door might be just your kind of place.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Screen Door's mark as a place of superlatives extends to the bad, as well.  It is an hour-long wait to order, no joke...and can be another half hour to get food after you order.  Worse yet, when your food finally does arrive, it may well be cold, as they leave it sitting around until they finish the last plate in your party and the kitchen is a messy, disorganized bustle.  The waitstaff is generally hurried and sometimes downright rude.  The atmosphere is crowded and loud and clashes completely with the Southern theme.\\n\\nI've lived in the South, and you're supposed to sip a lemonade at a leisurely pace, alternating with large succulent bites of pulled pork, while watching a river flow gently past.  You're not supposed to sit in a dingy, unlit room, shouting to communicate with your dining companions over the roar of the crowd, and attacking your food like a rabid hyena because you've waited an hour and a half by the time you actually eat and your waitress is desperately trying to turn your table one more time before they close.\\n\\nMost of the offerings are extremely unhealthful, too.  Organic beet salads are fine and well, but I didn't see anyone eating one - everyone I saw had bacon and andouille and biscuits and gravy and such.  Make sure there's room at your local ER before you eat here; the salt and fat are likely to send you there with a case of severe indigestion or elevated blood pressure, best case.  Maybe I'm just a cynic, but I find it alarming that Screen Door hands out little slips of paper with the daily specials printed on one side and a coupon for 10% off an angioplasty on the other.\\n\\nIn summary, Screen Door has some of the finest comfort food Portland has to offer.  If only eating there were more...comfortable.\\n\\nI suggest you go - but I don't suggest you go often.

So journey with me to Milestone 229, at the corner of Rich Street and Civic Center Drive.  Milestone sits prominently and conspicuously as a focal point of the Scioto Mile, nestled in Bicentennial Park and adjacent to the similarly modern design of the Main Street bridge.  The architecture is impressive, with its glare-resistant wall-to-wall windows offering a light airy interior with ample view of the fountains outside.  But if you want a closer look, do what I did and grab a patio seat.\\n\\nIt's funny, whenever I mention this joint to fellow Cbussers, they often respond similarly: \\"It looks so expensive -did you just get promoted?\\"  If you peruse their lunch menu, their prices are remarkably affordable, especially for downtown fare.  Add to that free valet service during lunch hours, which adds to the convenience factor.  Dinner rates are certainly a step up in price, and valet service jumps to $8 not including tip, so plan accordingly.\\n\\nThe menu is varied -what a lot of people are calling 'modern American' these days.  There's something for everyone, with an array of appetizers, soups, salads, sandwiches, and of course, entrees.  So far I've partaken in the shrimp tacos, the house salad (which is quite generous portion-wise), the roasted turkey melt, the tomato caprese pizza and the grilled salmon.  The verdict: the pizza was very good (the fresh factor was high and the crust was not overdone), but my other food choices were average.  Fairly tasty, but hardly transformative.  Service was reasonably timely for a lunch rush, but this leads to a perplexing observation: of my four visits, three took place at high noon, and each time the occupied tables were surprisingly sparse.  I was more than a little surprised that local lunchers don't pack it in, but on the upside it means that I can highly recommend showing up at 12:00 without a care in the world about waiting for a table.  My guess is that they make up for the shortage with a heavy happy hour following.\\n\\nMy only consistent gripe with Milestone 229 is that in my own experience, their valet service is consistently slow.  They offer a service in which you can text them with your ticket number when you are a few minutes from leaving the restaurant, but it seems that no matter how much notice you give them, there's always a significant wait for your vehicle.  My wait has averaged to around 10-12 minutes.  This past week, I texted the valet but then was unexpectedly waylaid by a very drawn-out story from a colleague, which took an additional 20+ minutes.  By the time I got outside, I was ready to profusely apologize for my delay, but instead it was the valet who rushed to me to state my vehicle was \\"on its way.\\"  This was 20-22 minutes after the text went out.  I was at a loss; I try to give the benefit of the doubt, but given they were not at capacity for lunch, there really was no excuse.  That's a serious wrinkle that needs to be ironed out, especially for those on a tight schedule.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, however, the pros far outweighed the cons, and I would recommend any downtowner give this place a try or two.

It said it had a horse radish mignonette on top, buuuuut it didn't, and it had no ice under the oysters to keep them chilled! Since raw bar items need to be kept chilled, due to the rate bacteria can grow on raw bar items, we were going to have to eat them rather quickly, but since they brought out five oysters and then 10 min later they brought out a second tray of five, still without ice, I guess eating them fast enough wouldn't have been a problem (?). Next we got \\"farm fresh peaches with fresh ricotta ON toast with honey\\"... We got about a half a peach, sliced, with honey gelatin and burnt bread crumbs sprinkled on top.

Their posted hours are 11-4 but he's usually open 11-1230 on a bad day. It's hot outside and the long line you have to stand in is hot, and then the food is hot. \\n\\nBut the bitchin' ends there. While you're waiting in line getting blown by massive fans spewing water vapor, you see and smell the glory that awaits you. When I got close enough to taste the crispy burnt parts falling off the end of a 5 lb. brisket because the butcher sharpened his knife, Franklin himself comes out and tells us he has two briskets left and to not order any more than you want to eat yourself in one sitting. \\n\\nI'm drooling.\\n\\nI get closer. At this point, I see the man in front of me order two brisket sandwhiches and the end of the brisket being sliced. And then, as if to pour salt in the wound, he scrapes up all the droppings with a swift motion and deposits them in the trash! The last scraps of this succulent delight left for rats and alleydogs. \\n\\nBut wait. There's more. Brisket, that is, one more. It is pulled from the warmer, and as the butcher pulls it from the warmer, grasps the greased paper at one end and unrolls it quickly, Kristian and I can only gasp and drop our jaws to the floor as the huge slab of meat slaps the surface of the cutting board. I can only liken it to the moment when a beautiful pair of D+ size mammaries falls out of a front-clasping brazier. Pure and utter dumbfounding delight. \\n\\nOrder summary:\\n\\nBrisket sandwich\\nTexas Tipsy (Chopped Beef, Cole Slaw, Sausage Sandwich)\\nBaked Beans\\nPork Ribs\\n\\nAll were incredibly delicious. The brisket was texas style and was absolutely the most tender cut of meat i've ever eaten. The sandwich had at least half a pound of meat on it and was delightful.\\n\\nThe Tipsy was also very good. One of the first cole slaws i've ever like. The chopped beef is good, but it really doesn't hold a smokin' hickory log to a thick slice of lean brisket. Sausage awesome.\\n\\nThe ribs were very very good but not really my style. They were incredibly tender, to the point where the meat would fall off the bone if you held it at the wrong (right) angle. They were heavily peppered and made (seemingly) in the carolina style. Still freakin' delicious.\\n\\nThe baked beans were the best I've ever had. Clearly made with drippin's and reduced down to a stew, well flavoured and a great complement to the meal. Often times, even at the renowned Salt Lick, the beans are weakly flavoured and a waste of time. Not here, if you have room.\\n\\nLastly, is the sauces, which get their own paragraph. The first is a runny, vinegary suace (sic) in the carolina style and great for the ribs. Tangy and a little sweet, this one is good used sparingly.\\nSecond, The spicy tomatoey sauce reminds me of a slightly better version of Rudy's sauce. Thick, hearty, and spicy, use plenty of this one.\\nLastly, and the opposite of leastly, is the Espresso BBQ sauce. It's nice how all the sauces on the table step up in color darkness, but you're almost afraid to try this one as it looks like it might be a mole or black bean concoction. But then you try it. At first, it's a little bitter, a little sweet, and you're not sure about it. Something's not right. But then the spice sets in, the espresso dulls it's strong first impression, and the sauce is absolutely perfect. Cuts the fat with it's slightly bitter and acidic flavors, while offering depth with dark earthy notes from the espresso beans. Warning: not for the faint of caffeine. \\n\\nAnd lastly lastly, Franklin walks around and makes sure his loyal followers are happy. As you sit in your decadence with three kinds of sauce on your face, you eavesdrop on his conversations with other lucky bastards and hear them all asking why he doesn't open a restaurant. Where he can serve all the time, in A/C. But i know the real story. He wants to keep it for himself and the elect few. The few with diligence, with loyalty. If the operation gets to big, it could get away from him, and I think he wants to make the best BBQ in Texas, and thereby the world. And I think he just might have done it. Here's my advice: Take the trailer on adventures all over the city/state/nation-world. Leave clues on the internets about where you'll be and only serve the diligentest and those luckiest of passerby who may never know what just happened to them.\\n\\nI'm going back tomorrow. \\n\\nBeauregardless"},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Great, sophisticated southern food at it's finest.

Sushi. Burgers. Bar. They are lacking a little bit in the service/food department. My waitress, Robin was nice! For being New Years Day she was energetic & happy to serve us. However, the delay for the food to arrive at the table & the quality of it was poorly executed. I do recommend the Crab Rangoon Dip, which seems to be a favorite & \\"exclusive\\" dish for Cowfish. The wontons are crispy & the dip is full of cream cheese & chunks of krab. Believe it or not, that came in within a 30 min time frame of ordering. Our main meal was about an 1.5 wait after that, and we weren't a large party. It was only 4 of us. The burger is HIGHLY recommended, and seems to be a very popular choice amongst the crowd of people dining in. They're huge quarter pounder Angus beef full of creative & flavorful components. My friend ordered the Big Squeal, which had pulled pork on top. The Burgushi concept is a great idea, and also quite popular. We had the Big Tuna Bacon sandwich & even though the tuna was flavorful, the presentation and everything else on the plate was such. It came out cold and soggy. No bueno. The Pittsboru Sandwich was a lot better in taste. It also came out cold, but more edible than the tuna. Last, but not least we also ordered from their Explosion Sushi menu. Again, a lot of great ideas & concept but poorly executed. Even though they offer a nice selection of variety the taste, quality and sushi was anything but. \\n\\nIt was a bad way for their business to start the New Year. The ambiance is OK, but nothing exciting.  After a while staring at the animated fish tank by the bar can get boring. I understand it was a holiday, they could've been lightly staffed?

We were ID'd with a scanner machine that every ID is put through. When I went to take my driver's license back, the bouncer shook his head and indicated that his machine deemed this a fake ID. I laughed, saying that of course this was real. I'm 24 years old and certainly do not use a fraudulent license. The bouncer said that if the machine said my license was fake, I would not be let in.\\n\\nI told him that was fine, I would just call the police to inform him that this was a genuine driver's license. He rolled his eyes and told me to do it. I was unable to easily find the non emergency Boston police number, so I said I would just take my license and leave. He would not give me my license back. I kindly explained that one does require a form of ID in every day life, to which I got another eye roll.\\n\\nMy friend asked if we could at least speak with a manager. Another bouncer, who was all around a more empathetic individual, got the manager. She ran the license again, and low and behold it was deemed real. Yet another eye roll from the original bouncer. He insisted on running it again, and again it was fake according to the machine. The manager then asked me for more forms of ID. \\n\\nWhat did it take to get my very real Rhode Island driver's license back from Tia's? A credit card, a debit card, a health insurance card, and two photo ID's from the universities I attended. Incredibly ridiculous, I have never had to deal with such absurd practices at any place of business. I was given an insincere apology and lame excuses from the manager, and went inside.\\n\\nOnce inside, we were told that the only way to obtain a drink on the patio was to order from the one cocktail waitress walking around. For ten minutes we attempted to flag her down, but she averted her eyes each time. I do not blame her, as I am sure she was horribly stressed out. Even with a private party, there is no excuse to have one employee serving the entire patio on a beautiful June night.\\n\\nUltimately we left Tia's and instead went to The Landing. On our way out, the bouncer sarcastically called out \\"have a great night, ladies!\\" My night was great because I went to a bar where I was able to get a drink and didn't have to deal with harassment from employees.\\n\\nMaybe if Tia's hired more cocktail waitresses, they could afford an ID machine that works!"},{"name":"Flat Patties","address":"33 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Went here for lunch during the work week and it wasn't too busy but busy enough so I didn't think it was a crappy place to eat.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I first fell in love with Fox Bros a few years ago when Smith's Old Bar had their pulled pork sandwiches and ribs on their menu. This was before Fox Brothers had their own place. Loved it back then; love it now. I decided it was high time to give Fox Brothers near L5P a try. Debated on whether or not to try Big Tex (FB's other place with a TexMex twist) in Decatur first; however, went with my original plan. \\n\\nI arrived on a Saturday around noon. Sat at the bar alongside one of the owners / brothers. Great to see these guys care enough to personally oversee the operational success on a day-to-day basis. Watched the Tech/Georgia game and drank a Sweetwater IPA while chatting with the friendly bartender. Cannot remember her name but she was great about filling me in on all the specials as well as her personal recommendations on the menu. She was also very attractive in a wholesome and vaguely ethnic looking (Mediterranean or Eastern European) girl next door kinda way.\\n\\nFox Brothers does have a lot of barbeque menu items with various TexMex and inventive fusion options; however, being a barbeque purist I decided to go with tried and true simple choices. I went with the pulled pork plate with a side of collards and a side of macaroni and cheese. I was actually a little shocked because I thought I had ordered Brunswick Stew (instead of the mac&cheese); however, when I actually saw the mac&cheese I knew it was divine providence. Fox Bros has perhaps the best macaroni and cheese in town. It tastes as good, if not better, than it looks. The pulled pork was very good too; however, I expected that. The collards were also good, but perhaps not great. I am sure I have had better collards elsewhere; Fb's version is seasoned a little too much on the sweet side.\\n\\nAnother bummer was the lack of sauce options. All I saw was one kind of barbeque sauce, ketchup and texas pete hot sauce; however, I think sparse sauce options are some sort of odd Texas BBQ culture thing. The idea is that the meat quality / smoky flavor should stand on its own merit without the benefit of a sauce. I understand that but am on the fence about whether or not I agree with that line of thinking. I enjoyed my overall experience and will be back to try the brunswick stew, frito pie / chili and perhaps also the barbecue beef brisket."},{"name":"The Whole Bowl Cart","address":"1100 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This place has been around forever!

While of course this experience may have been a single aberration, I do hope you'll keep in mind that this kind of thing may happen at any time, possibly to you, and is why I'm recommending you look elsewhere.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I, always on the lookout for new eats, and driving past this place a few times a week, finally decided to go there on a shared day off last Thursday.  We hadn't had breakfast, were starving, arrived just after they opened at 10AM, and they were obviously working like mad to complete a large catering order.  All these factors play into the following perfect storm of disappointment:\\n\\nI was initially impressed by the vast menu options, and as I looked them over, my girlfriend attempted to order a carnitas burrito.  She was informed that the carnitas was not ready.  Reconsidering, she decided to try beef.  I went up to the counter, a bit nonplussed that there were at least five employees behind the counter running around like chickens with their heads cut off (again, they seemed to be dealing with a huge to-go order), yet we, the customers standing right there in the shop, were hardly spared a glance.\\n\\nLogic dictates that whatever the very busy man rolling 20 burritos a minute barked at me must have been English, something along the lines of \\"Whaddayawant?\\"  But between the lack of eye contact and the accent, I had to simply work on that assumption and volunteer something about lemon chicken.  A grunt followed.  Now I speak a little Spanish, and I'm no bigot, this is just about professionalism.  By this point in this man's life, he MUST be aware that people don't immediately understand what he says, and in the food service industry he probably should alter his presentation to best communicate with the customers: make eye contact, speak slowly, use phrases off the written menu, hell, try a SMILE maybe?  Perhaps he was just supposed to be the burrito-roller (he was quite adept) and not take orders, I dont' know.\\n\\nAnd I don't care.  I ordered the chicken burrito, and added a chicken tamale at the last minute because I was pleasantly surprised to see it on the menu.  Having ordered WAY too many times at Chipotle, I volunteered what kind of salsa, beans, cheese etc I wanted on the burrito, figuring I was saving time and miscommunication.  But by the time he was done with the fifteen burritos in front of him and turned to make one more, he barked something else equivalent to \\"whaddayawantonthat?\\"  So I repeated the instructions - but honestly everything was so rushed and not confirmed that I don't even know whether the burrito he was working on was mine or whether the right stuff ended up on it in the end.\\n\\nEventually the cashier decided that two of the burritos that were being thrown down to the end of the counter were ours, and we paid and sat down.  We filled up our fountain drinks (50 cents a refill?  really?) and bit into the burritos.  And immediately regretted it.  There wasn't anything \\"wrong\\" with them, per se, they were just surprisingly without taste.  I took a second bite just to be sure it wasn't me, and then gave up.  My girlfriend pressed on through hers, but without anything you'd call \\"enjoyment\\".  Cheap gristly beef and a tossed-in slice of government cheese.  We'd ordered chips & guacamole but I went back up for a tiny container of salsa - which I had to pay for and it was little more than watery diced tomatoes.  At least we confirmed that it wasn't just the bitter taste in our mouths from the off-putting service that kept us from enjoying the food.\\n\\nThe one bright point, and the sole reason there are two stars on this review instead of one, was the tamale.  I really enjoyed it - not too wet, not too dry, not too skimpy on the chicken, it was just right.  But it was too little too late, as I sat there drinking my watery \\"home-made\\" fountain lemonade and watching the activity continue behind the counter.  More pollos sin cabezas...\\n\\nAgain, I freely admit that my experience may be totally out of the norm and not representative of the restaurant's usual quality.  But even setting aside the rushed impersonal and possibly inaccurate service, almost all of the resulting food was just bland and not worth all the stress.  I personally feel you've got to work pretty hard to make a burrito with NO taste, maybe that's a skill all its own.  I do hope that everyone else's taste experience is better than mine, for the place seems popular and I'd hate to think that anyone is settling for the kind of stuff I ended up with.\\n\\nTo sum up this visit, I'll resort to the phrase that occured to me at the time:  At the VERY least, when thinking of one's dining experience at a particular restaurant, one should not be able to say with complete conviction, \\"Wow, I really would have been better off in every way if I'd just gotten a Snickers bar!\\""},{"name":"Fox Bros.

And that's coming from someone who's not quite a barbecue novice! I've lived in deep East Texas all my life, And let me tell you, the people there know their brisket. The barbecue pits probably outnumber the people 3 to 1. My father, in fact, is a barbecue master himself. He cooks on a huge, old, 250 gallon barbecue pit that he's had since the 70s. He often cooks up to 10 briskets at a time for events all around the community. And even though his brisket is almost perfect, (sorry dad!) Franklins Is better! Everybody is so perfectly flavorful and tender. I could go into further detail, but that's all you need to know! If you try Franklins, you'll never go back. Just a few tips: get there early, around 9 AM, bring a chair, and make sure your willing to have some pretty cool conversations with barbecue nerds from all around the nation. And, try to go on a Tuesday or  Wednesday. The ribs are also excellent, (I got the last 2 left last time I went there) and the beans are also quite good."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

I had a classy lady with a bacon wrapped dog, my husband got a slappy pappy dog with a classic all beef.  Both were good, but I desired more in the hotdog itself. The pretzel appetizer was good, especially with the cheese sauce. The baklava was sub-par, I would not recommend it.

The meat was right off the bone, but what BBQ place isn't? no? \\n\\nI was planning to give this place 5 stars before even taking a bite based on everyone's reviews, but maybe I just need to be more exposed to the world of BBQ. The food was great and it's great to eat outside on a cool Spring night, but I wasn't exactly blown away. I was more surprised by the price of their sandwich. Maybe next time!\\n\\nOn a side note, my hands have never been so clean after eating BBQ.\\nThis could be a good or bad thing, but the ribs were just too darn easy to eat! :D"},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"A ++++++++++\\n\\nExcellent customer service.

Being from Texas, we're all experts on Tex-Mex cuisine (just like we all have Texas accents and ride horses to work).  An in terms of progressive Tex-Mex cuisine, MASA is definitely top-notch.  The complimentary homemade corn bread goes perfectly with its accompanying spreads.

Sadly, I missed out on the Southwestern Eggroll, which is apparently a very popular dish.  My notes say something about poblano peppers, chorizo, chihuahua cheese, and blue cornmeal.  The Granola con Leche with tropical fruit wasn't very tropical.  It only had watermelon, cantaloupe, melon, and pineapple.  I was hoping for guava and papaya.  Nevertheless itwas still very refreshing with good nuts, granola, and a slightly sweet yogurt.  The breakfast tacos had creamy scrambled eggs and vine ripe tomato salsa.

The good thing about them is that also includes pretty high end toppings like avocado, gruyere cheese, carmelized onions, bleu cheese, mushrooms, etc. So it isn't your average burger and bun kind of spot.

Well, I have to start saying that this location must be cursed. I have seen several business open up and close at that spot. We had gone to B & B once before about a month ago. We had a okay meal. I though overpriced but it was okay. Slow on the service I would say. My husband had a burger and I had a portabella mushroom one.\\n\\nWe decided to go back this Thursday night (7/3/14). What a negative experience that was. I ordered an iced tea and my husband a beer. It took 30 minutes for me to get the iced tea. My husband's beer never came. The waitress asked the manager if that beer was available since it's on the menu. The manager couldn't bother and never got back to her. He was too busy sitting at the bar. He never approached us to see if there was any other beer he wanted. She seemed frustrated and lost also.\\n\\nAt this point she takes our food order. I ordered the fish and chips. My husband orders the tuna burger. (WHAT A BIG MISTAKE THAT WAS). First I got my food about 45 minutes later. He did not get his burger at the same time I got my food so I had to wait until mine was cold. He tuna burger BTW priced at $20.00 was a huge disappointment. He bit into it and after swallowing it said there is something really wrong with this food. Cutting the burger in half revealed a grayish looking mushed up tuna. It looked, smelled and tasted rotten. No exaggeration but I have never seen my husband about to puke at any restaurant. We called the waitress and told her about what had happened. She took the burger back and offered another burger. My husband didn't even want to eat at all. The waitress pushed and pushed and said let me get you another burger and you can take it home. It came out another 20 minutes later. We took it to go. We got the bill and although he was not even interested in that last burger and she was the one who said that would bring it for him with an apology to take home we still got charged. The manager never approched us either.\\n\\nAll this happening while another table was yelling at the manager for their food delay. It was probably one of the worst experiences. What a shame.

My entire family loved fried chicken and even embraced the weird and strange box of goods we'd get from the PX during Thanksgiving. My grandma loved cranberry sauce, I loved stuffing and gravy, my mom loved the corn bread, my dad just stuffed his face with three turkey plates in one sitting with all the trimmings, so on and so forth. None of us, not even my father who is an American citizen, had ever lived in the South until we moved here about twenty years ago. \\n\\nSouthern food to me is like one of those things that just ring true with my soul. I love eating it and I go out of my way to find new great Southern restaurants. So when one of my favorite chefs, Mr. Kevin Gillespie, announced that he would be opening a Southern restaurant in Decatur, I knew I had to go check it out one day. \\n\\nThe occasion was my dear friend H's bday. She and I can pack it away for two women who barely weigh 100 pounds and we're the perfect eating buddies. We told our misters to stay home so we could have a nice night out of just us stuffing our faces. \\n\\nI had made reservations for us at 7pm on a Thursday and we were seated very promptly. We decided to forego any alcohol and just went straight for a cheese plate to begin. The jersey cow cheese plate was great but nothing spectacular except the orange marmalade. Mr. Gillespie - I'd buy your marmalade by the gallon if I could. The marmalade is not too sweet, not too citrus-y, not too tart, and really just treading the sweet and tart territory very well. To add, great cheese as well on this plate! \\n\\nThe corn bread was next. We ordered extra. It was crispy on all sides with a nice but not too crumbly bread in the middle. We decided to spread cheese and marmalade on this from our previous appetizer. It's life changing. Order the cheese and instead of the house made baguette, just get an extra order of corn bread. Seriously. \\n\\nFor mains, we ordered the coca--cola braised short ribs and chicken and dumplings; we ordered the rice and beans, collard greens, and mac and cheese for sides. \\n\\nCoca-cola braised short ribs - yummmmm, it was so tender and just falling apart. It had a great flavor and was braised to perfection but I felt like something was a little amiss. Maybe it's because my mom always made me braised short ribs (and she still does) a la Korean style with soy sauce but I wanted some more salt or something to elevate the flavor. Very well done dish though and we definitely scraped the hell out of the gravy (maybe we just needed more gravy). \\n\\nChicken and dumplings - Oh my... these, these ladies and gents, were some of the best chicken and dumplings I've ever had. I always have high hopes for chicken and dumplings but seem always disappointed but these, my god, will make you cry tears of joy as you eat them. The dumplings are perfect and that's really what makes chicken and dumplings. They were perfectly cooked, not too dough-y, and perfect size for consumption. The chicken gravy was amazing and just really blew our socks off. \\n\\nI loved all the sides but I think the rice and beans were the clear winners. The Carolina gold rice with beans mixed with sausages, how can you say no? \\n\\nThe fantastic dinner was topped off with the most amazing dessert in the form of a lemon ice box pie. Normally, lemon ice box pie can be too curd-y, resulting in too tart of a pie filling (also makes your teeth stick together), or too hard to bite into (from lack of cream), and this pie was just heaven. \\n\\nThe crust was made out of graham crackers and molasses I believe and it wasn't overbearingly sweet or even too soggy. The filling was perfect with creamy, sweet, hint of tart, and fresh lemon filling just dancing in your mouth happily with the graham cracker crust and oh, the whipped cream that felt like you were eating clouds. We had already had a huge meal and we just kept eating like little piggies. She packed half to take home to her mom (she promptly then called her to excitedly tell her about the dessert). \\n\\nI love Mr. Gillespie's food since I fell in love with Gunshow a few years ago.

To make the wait a little more bearable, the staff brings around cokes and beer (if you so choose) every half hour or so.\\n\\nEnough with the lagniappe, lets talk meat. Don't waste your time on lean meat or sides, y'all. You want to experience the full-fat, melt in your mouth, hangover-healing deliciousness that is the brisket. Dripping with meat juice and cholesterol with the right amount of smoke and spice from the rub, its the first thing you smell when the line reaches the front door. If you're lucky like I was, the meat cutter may pass back some fatty ends for your chewing pleasure. The ribs were fall off the bone tender, even more succulent than the brisket if you can believe it. I've never had ribs that good. The turkey, a sad little after thought, is moist and absolutely worth trying. My recommendation: the 2 meat plate with fatty brisket and ribs, baked beans and potato salad (if you MUST - on the bright side, the beans have pieces of brisket mixed in). Then get the Banana Bourbon pie for later. Oh my damn.\\n\\nIn short, everyone needs to experience Franklin at least once, even if it sets an unreasonably high standard for BBQ for the rest of your life. It's so worth it."},{"name":"HOTLIPS Pizza - Pearl","address":"721 NW 9th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Can pizza replace sushi?

We also split a side of the greens which was amazing.  Sorry we cannot review the desserts since we were too full to order any.  A lot of people have written about the cocktails --one brief add--my husband is picky about cocktails and was happy with his gin and tonic.  I tried two wines suggested by our waiter.

Their big patio, with tables and hightops for groups, big tvs, and several fire pits, also adds to this feel.  The inside decor is nothing special, but the giant bar means that there's always a seat and an interesting crowd to watch and interact with.\\n\\nIf you're a beer drinker, this spot will be a little piece of heaven, but they also have a decent wine list and offer half off bottles on Thursday nights from 7-11pm.

The sliders come three to an order, and they are phenomenal.  I don't know how they make their meatballs, but they are very tender and flavorful.

Normal people show up at 5:00am.\\nLuckily it is a regular and touristy spot for people, bring some claws and start drinkin doors open at 10am if you need a restroom or can't wait to buy some merch. Until then you have portapotties and a newly opened coffee trailer to help with the wait not to mention the tantalizing smell of the smoked meats. Bring some speakers...play country because well it's AUSTIN  Pups are welcome on the patio ! By the time you get to the beginning of the line you have met plenty of friends, maybe had a Aaron siting and you are chomping at the bit. \\nAt around 8 they come around and take a approximate order, so they know when or if they are selling out of specific meats and TRY to let you know. \\nThe staff, ohhhhh. I mean Aaron, where do you find these folks ? I want to be best friends with every single one of them, everyone takes their time, they treat it like your first experience even if it isn't, they make sure you are comfortable through your entire visit, they are personable and just what people need when coming to Franklins. \\nMeats so good, so buttery, I can come here literally forever to the point of when I have dentures I can just slip those puppies out and eat with my gums.. I mean teeth aren't needed. I wish I was brought here when I was a few months old and fed bbq, there is no solids when it hits your mouth! \\nWe ordered 1-beef rib (sold Saturdays only), which was fall off the bone peppery good, if I held it up, it would have slid right off...I know.. yum..then we ordered 1lb of brisket, oh hands down best brisket we have EVERRRR had when I took the first bite my 8 hours of waiting DISAPPEARED ! I'm like we are doing this tomorrow!!! I was on the fence about the 1/2 lb of pork ribs but they ending up being the best tasting pork ribs ever and a new staple, they aren't sweet which is great instead they have this peppery spicy flavor, WHOA. Next, the hatch green chile sausage was awesome too not as juicy as everything else but if you like hatch this is right up your alley. \\nWe didn't get the sides...we are newly keto, so as tempting as the raved about pies were, I had to pass... I know I'm the worst, pecan pie is my weakness. This lady makes these JUST for franklins and sells out. I recommend trying it all, I mean ya know what you like, then try more and you should be set, come on..Who doesn't love bbq leftovers? They have sauces that reach everyone, but we ate so fast it's like we were on survivor and got dropped here after filming. Seriously though, last meal on earth hands DOWN. As new austinites we will be back, probably tomorrow.

My husband and I enjoyed the meatball one the most and really like how they have a mini version for us to sample so we know what we like to order for next time! The tapioca dumplings was probably my least favourite out of all my dishes at the restaurant because the skin was a bit too thick and became way too chewy especially when it cools down a bit.

Although the traditional atmosphere and energy of the Century House will most definitely play stronger to an older audience, the quality and value we received from our meals made for a pleasant and filling experience.  For our first course we ordered gin Martinis and Oysters which were fresh and the drinks were poured strong which was a plus.  For an entree I ordered the lobster ravioli special which was served with a tomato cream sauce, and my girlfriend ordered the butternut squash ravioli which was served with an herb butter sauce.  In terms of taste, her ravioli was superior, it was much more fresh and the sauce was more well balanced.  However, my lobster ravioli special was still quite good, the tomato cream sauce was a little on the acidic side but the flavor complimented the lobster inside the ravioli which was cooked well and tasted moist and smooth.  Another dish ordered at our table was the Prime Rib which was ordered at a medium rare temp, and leaned more toward the rare side, but was seasoned well.  The only stumble in the meal was the side salads which only consisted of iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers.  The salads were not chopped which made them hard to eat, and they were mildly boring and didn't really add anything to the meal.  In terms of American food, Century House hits the mark in most areas and apart from having a slower atmosphere provides a decent menu that is executed sufficiently for the price."},{"name":"Mi Pizza","address":"6001 W Parmer Ln, Ste 440","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Wish it was a chain!!

From top to bottom: soft bun, house kettle chips, fried pancetta, triple cream brie, perfectly cooked medium beef, garlic aioli and soft bun again.  Ridiculous!  The chips and pancetta had an awesome snap to them that gave way with no toughness.  The brief moment as you provide pressure to those two ingredients before they crack is just long enough to smash the brie into a wave of cheesy goodness.  The garlic ailoi provided a nice pop of flavor as you bite through the slider.  I probably could have devoured 20 they were so good.  The salad and two sliders were actually a perfect portion.\\n\\nFrom talking to the owner and bartender, we learned that they are known for the perogies.

My sister in law and I ordered strawberry margaritas.

We notified the waitress, and she apologized, took them and came back with \\"new\\" ones that were the same thing.

Upon entering, we were warmly greeted and sat immediately. \\n\\nTo start, my girlfriend and I split the Fried Jalapeno Oysters. These consisted of fried oyster bellies, and fried jalapenos, both soaked in an egg and flour batter. The portion size seemed better suited for one person, so I would suggest splitting a couple of appetizers between two or three people. \\n\\nI had the beef enchiladas with the green chili sauce. They came with two sides, I opted for the re-fried black beans and  rice. The beef was extremely tender and flavorful. It was not ground beef or steak, but rather pot roast beef that has been slow roasted to perfection. The green chili sauce gave it a small kick. I had also ordered the habenero sauce on the side to try out. It was amazing, gave a very nice bite and had a lingering after taste. It was a great addition, so if you like your food a little spicy, give it a shot.\\n\\nMy girlfriend had the Cactus Salad. It consisted of lettuce, a Mexican vinaigrette, tomatoes, cactus tenders and cheese. It was light, zesty, and refreshing. How often do you get to eat cactus in this area? Definitely give it a try, you will be pleasantly surprised. \\n\\nJalapeno's has a nice selection of Mexican beers and drinks to compliment their meals.  I opted for Pacifico while my girlfriend switched it up between their house margaritas and red sangria. I didn't get a chance to try her drinks but I will be sure to give them, a whirl next time.  \\n\\nOur server was knowledgeable, energetic, and most importantly, prompt. We did ask a lot of questions because we had never dined at Jalepeno's before and she was very helpful in guiding us through the menu.

I was really excited to try Afghan food, as I knew nothing about it. The restaurant is in a strange location right next to the highway, and it is hard to actually turn in if you are coming from the opposite side of the street. \\n\\nInside, the place was very warm and inviting, with white linen tablecloths and table settings. Our server was extremely gracious (and chatty, lol). He started us off with simple salads that had an interesting sour kind of dressing, not unlike the ginger dressing that you find on salads at Japanese places, just more sour. We also got a basket of complimentary Afghan bread, which went really well with the chatney(?). \\n\\nEven though I am not the biggest fan of lamb (dislike the gamey taste), I wanted to try something more authentic and went with the lamb kabob. It came with chunks of lamb tenderloin, a small side of eggplant (you can choose between that, lentils or spinach) and two kinds of rice -- white, and brown rice cooked with almonds, carrots and raisins. My friends got the Qabeli Palaw, which was the same brown rice cooked with the almonds, carrots and raisins, with lamb meat. I think typically, my dish just comes with plain brown rice, but since the chef was already making Qabeli Palaw, I got some of it too :)\\n\\nI was pleased to find that the lamb did NOT have the gamey taste; in fact, I quite enjoyed it. I think because the meat was in thick chunks, it was lacking a bit of flavor. However, the eggplant dish helped circumvent that since it had strong flavors. I think in the future I will get the Qabeli Palaw. I wasn't sure how the carrots and raisins in the rice would work, but it was really tasty and the lamb is shredded rather than in chunks, I believe.\\n\\nFinally, we got Czala for dessert. Vanilla ice cream with rosewater, ground pistachios and dessert noodles. It was a huge portion and a great end to the meal.\\n\\nWe had the restaurant to ourselves the entire dinner :\\\\ I know it was a Tuesday night, but I hope it isn't like this all the time!

I can't remember our server name, but he was very nice and very attentive. \\n\\nWe started with some apps that included the Nachos, Hummus, and Corn Puppies. All were very tasty, especially for bar/pub food and got to us pretty quick. \\n\\nI had the Pilgrim's Progress Sandwich because I am a huge Turkey lover and it was amazing. One of my friends had their signature burger called Subprime or something like that, and it was very unique. It was a burger but used a doughnut as the bun. She would not even share with us! lol\\n\\nAll and All this place was great. Great Atmosphere, Great Service, and excellent food. Anytime I am in Midtown again for a show or something, I will most certainly be back. \\n\\nProps to the server we had, he seemed to be working alone and was able to handle several people at once, also extremely huge props to the Chef and Kitchen Staff for providing tasty food in a quick manner, we were not late for the show!\\n\\nI will be back!"},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Okay...I kind of felt like I was in Portlandia for a minute, but the food and atmosphere was spot on and I would go back in a heartbeat. The restaurant doesn't open until 5:30, so you have to wait in line outside until they open. And they only take two reservations per night (that's what we were told by the woman who took us to dinner there...I believe her, but you might check that). Parking is a nightmare...you're looking at neighborhood parking off of Burnside. \\n\\nOnce you make it inside, the place fills up fast. The waitstaff are great and the kitchen is open for you to watch what goes on, which I tend to appreciate. I ordered the pulled pork (which had just been smoked that day) and it came with slices of bread, mashed potatoes and pickled onions/pickles and it was delicious. I thought there would be a lot of food (after seeing some of the fried chicken dinners that were coming out) but it was not too much. Many people in our party got the Screen Door plate, which allows you to pick any three sides and it was very popular. \\n\\nThis soul food restaurant was one of the best I have frequented...you won't be disappointed."},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Excellent service, and great food.

Just move forward, wait for the left turn signal and get in via clairmont rd entrance. \\n\\nThis branch feels slightly smaller than the brookhaven one but the staffs are as friendly. I like pretty much all of their sandwiches, but some of my favorites are,\\n1) vegetarian sandwich with portobello mushroom, pesto sauce and goat cheese. This is probably the best no-compromise vegetarian sandwich I have ever had. For once vegetarian sandwich is not just lettuce and tomatoes.\\n2) Chicken pesto sandwich - well, technically this is just the same vegetarian sandwich with mushroom swapped out for chicken. Did I say I like pesto/goat cheese combo?\\n3) All of their salads with salmon is good. \\n4) I like their creamy soups.

My friend had the lean brisket and he was wild about it as well.  Although, half way thru my feast I tried 3 different sauces that were on the table, there was really no need for any of them. The meat was so tasty and juicy that just a liberal dose of hot sauce (also on the table) was all I needed. A lot of folks were ordering a sandwich called, The Tipsy Texan.  It's huge and at $6.50 a steal.   As I've discovered with other BBQ places, the sides (slaw and beans for me) were just so-so.

Yet a friend of mine was interested in going so we decided to make the trip over there.\\n\\nWe went on a Friday night, and got there around 6:45pm, we go super-duper lucky, because when we got there there was no line out the door which was awesome, but literally seconds after we got in line a mass of people appeared in line behind us. After that we only had to wait in line for about 10 minutes, and didn't have to wait to get a table after we placed our order. I would strongly advise against having a party larger than 3 people, otherwise you will have to wait until enough seating space clears up.\\n\\nAs for the food, we got the spicy edamame and the gyzoa(the serving is a bit small, good for 2 people though) for appetizers, which were both delicious.  For the ramen we both got the original #1. I got a nauruto maki(fish cake) topping and my friend got a spicy bomb added to theirs. The broth is rich and creamy, and most of the flavor comes from the pork belly. Pretty tasty! Some other commenters suggest getting extra noodles, but for me I didn't need any. I will say however, if you like your meat, I would suggest getting a extra piece of the pork belly, because the piece they give you is not very big. It is pretty filling I have to say, I was tempted to get a curry bowl on the side, but I don't think I would have been able to finish everything if I did.\\n\\noverall the meal was very good! worth the trip over here! The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars is that the ramen could have been a liiiittllle hotter temperature-wise. I hate eating soup that is too-hot to eat, getting your tongue burned is no fun, but this could have been a touch hotter, by the time I was nearing the end of my soup it had gotten cold. I'm not sure if we just got ramen that had been left out too long, or the pot it was served from wasn't hot enough, or if they have a set temperature they like to have the broth be at. Also I would have preferred the broth to be a touch saltier? Just a personal preference though, I've read other reviews where people who got some of the other ramen choices on the menu complained that the broth was TOO salty.\\n\\nI would probably come back to try a different ramen and maybe some of their other food items, like the sliders, which looked really good. I'm not sure if I would get lucky again with the timing/not having to wait too long. BUT, when we left it was a little after 7:30pm and the line was barely out the door, so they have a pretty quick system of getting people in and out. Mind you this is not the type of place where you can hang around and talk after your meal is done, it's best to leave right after you are done to free up space for the people hovering around you waiting for you to leave."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I went here for breakfast and while the line was long it was totally worth it!

Excellent sandwich, perfect Carolina sauce, with just enough spice, and wonderful sweet tea.

You can get refills on soft drinks, but not tea?

During my lunch break from my nearby job, I eat at this place at least twice a week.  I come around 11:30 AM when it's not busy, which makes for a relaxing, enjoyable visit.  Donna, the manager/server, is very affable and personable.  Her upbeat demeanor as well as the other servers provide a delightful time for any patron.  Donna enjoys engaging in chats.  Even when she's busy with her duties, she is willing to have a short conversation.  At times, it can take quite a bit of time for the orders to be brought to the table and for the staff to collect your payment and provide the change in return due to the other errands they have or dealing with other customers.  But I feel they do the best they can and apologize to you whenever long waits occur.\\n\\nWhenever I have lunch, I usually eat either the Classic Burger or Texas Burger.  Despite the juice dripping from the patty, both are delicious and first rate alternatives to the more popular, yet cookie cutter burgers at fast food restaurants.  Combine either burger with the chips, fries, or other sides, I think it makes for a satisfying meal.  The chicken salad sandwich is pretty appealing although the size could be a little bigger.  I find the Slider Trio to be interesting.  It's a neat way of eating a diversity of burgers and sandwiches in one entree.  The mini versions of the sandwiches are clever and despite their small sizes, all in all, they fill you up.  When it replaced the Texas Burger as a menu item, I used to order the American Burger.  It wasn't bad, but I didn't feel it was as satisfactory as the Texas Burger and Classic Burger.  I was elated when the Texas Burger was brought back and appreciate the updated version of sliced onions on top of the patty.  The sides of colliard greens, brocolli, and potato salad are top notch.  Although their portion sizes are very small, they add a lot of enjoyment to the meal as equal, if not more as the main course.\\n\\nAs much as I like this place, I think there are suggestions for improvement.  Having more menu items such as hot dogs, bratwursts, and spaghetti would benefit in attracting more customers and would satisfy the regulars even more as they, too, have the tendency to eat something different from their favorite items during certain visits.  It's nice that ketchup is served with the fries, but the patrons could apply it as well as mustard on the burgers if ketchup and mustard bottles were available on the tables.  \\n\\nBut these suggestions still don't deter Holy Smoke Barbecue from being a fine eatery.  The music and the programming on the flat screen monitors also make the visit an enjoyable one."},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"SO judging by all of the amazing reviews and pictures you probably don't need me to tell you how great this place is and how amazing their food is (and if you do - it's SUPER great and SUPER amazing ;])!

I had the 4 meat sampler(can't remember the name) but basically you chose 4 meats: brisket, pulled pork, ribs, chicken, or smoked wings. Shared with the bf: chicken, ribs, wings & brisket . Very good sized portions! Since it was my 1st time here I think we ordered too much... I would say one size down would have been plenty! I believe the 4 meats was priced around $25 so very reasonable. The brisket & ribs were oh so goooood!! I would NOT recommend the chicken though, thought it was pretty bland. But who comes to a BBQ place to have chicken, right? :) Oh wait! but DO try the smoked wings! A little sweet, a little spicy.... Mmmm, delish! I like spicy so I had no problem with my chilli being spicy also... The reason for 4 & not 5 stars is that sides were not as good as the meats. Mac n cheese was ok but the potato salad I really did not care for. I guess I like mine a little sweeter. Also their sauce is  just OK, wish it was, yes you guessed it, sweeter!

First of all, the fried oyster is so delicious I could order a plate of them. The shooter is just their bloody mary mix, but them mixed together is to die for. Order it.\\nFor brunch, my cousin raves about their breakfast sandwich, saying that it is THE best in boston. I have gotten their cobb salad and that was pretty good but i HIGHLY recommend the BLTE.

We got the gyoza, Chashu bowl, Tonkotsu Sho-yu ramen, and Gotcha Matcha dessert. The gyoza were good - pretty much your standard dumplings. The Chashu bowl complemented our ramen nicely since it gave us the extra pork belly and scallions. The ramen was super delicious and flavorful! I fell in love. The broth was super addicting and deliciously fatty. The noodles were on the thin side for my preference, but still the right texture. I wasn't a huge fan of the matcha pudding - the pudding itself had the earthy green tea flavor, but the crunch was a little strange for my taste and it didn't look very appetizing as a whole. To drink, we each ordered the Sugrdog. If you like grapefruit flavor, this is a yummy cocktail for you.\\n\\nI personally liked the vibe.

The presentation was gorgeous and a surprise. Every bite was tasty and the duck was perfectly done, very tender and moist, and the portion was generous. My only question is, could they have somehow put a little more crisp into the skin without changing how the flesh was cooked? \\n\\nFor dessert I had an amazing concoction with apples, rhubarb, and a number of other delicious ingredients. The menu posted on line now isn't current, so I can't share everything that was in it. The presentation was gorgeous and the combination of textures and flavors were excellent. \\n\\nAll in all, the food is outstanding. The service was excellent, too.

When the salad was done and I wanted to order dinner, they informed me that they were no longer serving the dinner menu and gave me an abbreviated bar menu. No one said anything about the kitchen closing soon and there was nothing on the menu about the hours.

The actors try their best to be entertaining, but due to the sound system, you cannot hear the story they are trying to convey.  What little we could hear was a lame story of saving the princess.  With all the impressive entertainment in Orlando, like Cirque, you really don't want to waste your time or money on this act. We sat in the \\"yellow\\" section and we were supposed to scream and cheer each and every time our yellow pirate did anything.  Really, this is the whole story line.  Go if you like to scream and yell for no reason.  \\nThe only cute part was when they safely loaded a few children in a boat with lifejackets and allowed them to be part of the show.  However, at the end, they allowed all small children on stage and several were close to stepping into the moat area as they walked up the steps to the stage.  If it wasn't for one pirate who was watching, it could have been tragic.  \\nChicken dinner was hot when served and the waitress was working hard.  Wine ordered tasted like someone put out a cigar in it.  This is not worth any amount of money.   Needless to say, we left early with the scared children once the cannons went off.

I have been to the one in SE Portland several times and it was pretty good. The problem with that location is that it is surrounded by tons of other good Chinese restaurants, or should i say..the new Chinatown. I will be going to the one in Beaverton much more, since i live near here and because there isn't much good Chinese restaurants over on this side of town. \\n\\nSo I went for dinner, and I can already tell they have lots of kinks to work out. We ask for beer, but they haven't gotten their shipment yet, so we ask for some wine. They only have two selections of wine, and they are still waiting for their stock of wine to come thru. It's still early since they opened last week. I assume they will have this fixed soon. \\n\\nTheir menu is excellent, a wide selection of items, and plus, it has tons of pictures! That helps a lot when you decide what to order. What is so great about Wong's King is that their menu items are unique. A lot of the items you don't see at other Chinese restaurants. This is not your typical American Chinese food, though it does have some of those type of dishes (orange chicken, kung pao, etc). Their menu caters the Chinese audience and those who love to eat authentic Chinese food. It's not heavily expensive, around $15 a plate, but it is well worth it. Their service is superb. There are no other Chinese restaurant that i have been to in my entire life that has the service that Wong's King does. Their waitstaff is very knowledgeable and nice. They came by every 5 minutes or less just to change our plates, fill our water, fill our tea, check if everything was ok, etc. They must wash a lot of dishes because during dinner, they must have change my plate at least 5 times, what other Chinese restaurant does that in Portland? \\n\\nI highly recommend this restaurant for those who love Chinese food and live near Beaverton. I am not surprised at all on why they are rated number 3 last year in the top 100 Chinese restaurant in the US. \\n\\nGreat food, very superb service, nicely decorated.

We've always been on the hunt for good BBQ in the area, so it was really only a matter of time before we ended up coming here. We ended up getting a 1/2 slab of rib and a 1/4 chicken, plus baked beans and brunswick stew.\\n\\nTo start, the ribs were honestly the most fall-off-the-bone tender I've ever had. They were practically falling off the bone when you picked them up. In addition, they were moist (not dried out in the least), and unbelievably flavorful. I think that I make a pretty great rack of ribs, but they pale in comparison to what we had here. I don't know what they do, what spices they use, but whatever it is works.\\n\\nThe chicken was easily as good as the ribs, and might have even been a little better, if that were possible. There was a really nice smokiness, and like the ribs, the chicken was basically falling apart. Like any good chicken, the skin should be the best part and these did not disappoint.\\n\\nIn addition the baked beans were amazing - a bit too sweet, but still among the best I've ever had. The brunswick stew was good, but nothing special. I've definitely had much, much better elsewhere.\\n\\nOverall, definitely worth a trip if you're in the area, or just looking for some good BBQ!"},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Will have to try again because rest of my party loved their food.

I've looked at the menu from the sidewalk and kept going quite a few times thinking I wasn't in the mood. Tonight was the night! I was a little skeptical based on some of the negative YELP reviews. The vegan menu was front and center above the cash register, right where I like it. It's the first thing one's eyes gravitate to when standing there trying to decide what to order. Back in my omnivore days in college, I was a big bibimbap fan.... It's a Korean dish and normally it's a big mess of rice, meat, fried egg, and veggies which you mix in with hot sauce and stir up until all the ingredients are mixed up and coated with egg/hot sauce. Rice Junkies offers a vegan version... I had no idea what to expect from the menu description but I took a leap of faith based on my distant historical love of bibimbap. I was only a little bit hungry and I received this massive stainless steel bowl of warm brown rice, fresh raw veggies and steamed tofu with a side of the house Korean hot sauce to flavor it up. The veggies included were romaine lettuce, bean sprouts, zucchini, cucumber, red cabbage, and grated carrots. Some of the raw veggies seemed to be marinated like the little side dishes you get when you eat at a Korean restaurant. Oh my gosh was this delicious! I wish I had been hungrier... I only made it 1/3 of the way through this massive bowl and had to stop. This was a perfect meal to me.Oh, and the best part? Only $6.75!

Seriously, I am a BBQ enthusiast and I was quite skeptical when I heard a trailer was serving worthy slow cooked meats.  Let's start with the basics:\\n\\nThe place opens at around noon, and the lines pack up fast.  Be there early or you risk standing out in the sun for a long wait.  They serve BBQ until 4 PM or until they run out.  My best bet is that on the weekends, they will run out well before 4 PM, so get there early!  The service is very friendly and they are quick at getting you your food.\\n\\nThey have out door seating with limited shaded tents.  The flies are not really a problem for the most part, but if you give them a chance, they will land on your food/drinks.  It wasn't worth knocking this place down a star just for that.\\n\\nNow let's get on to the meats.  They have a decently priced combo plate that you can order.  It comes with two meats and two sides.  But if you're like me, I always order a la carte.  The brisket was absolutely delicious.  The brisket was indeed juicy, packed full of flavor, and surprisingly had a nice smokiness to it.  My only complaint was that it was a little tough for \\"extra moist\\" brisket.  Otherwise this brisket is top notch, given the circumstances of where it's cooked.  The ribs were delicious.  Slight smokiness, exceptionally tender, flavorful, and slightly peppery.  The sausage was damn near disgusting.  I am not a fan of this style of sausage.  It is not the typical sausage you would find the stores, and it has this rich very soft texture.  The skin didn't snap much when I bit into either.  Others may like this flavor but it did not make my taste buds happy.  Their potato salad is legitimately a tasty mustard based potato salad.  I would recommend a little bit to accompany the BBQ.\\n\\nMy impression:  I left with a smile.

They offered us a steak instead, but what we tried, we didn't like. We said that we would just eat the buffet food and would be done. They insisted that we would be charged very little for the buffet food. We sat down, and the manager came over. He was very persistent that we get some of the meat and finally we agreed. He even asked if wanted more buffet food but we said no. When the meat arrived it was so so.\\n\\nAll this time, we thought that they were going to nominally charge us for our drinks (2 beers) and the buffet foot which was less than 2 pounds for both of us.\\n\\nI left a $5 tip for the server and when I went to pay, I was told that we owed them $28. I was astounded and was not about to pay that amount. I gave the cashier $20 and said that I thought that was more than reasonable considering the buffet food was about $12 and the drinks were another $6. We did'nt want the meat and only obliged because the manager was so persistent.\\n\\nAnd this is when the SHTF, the manager came dashing out as we leaving saying that we owed him $8 more. I said no, he followed us the door demanding the money, I then threw down another $5 so between the tip, the money we had paid plus this money we have now paid more than the bill.

Seriously, even if you aren't vegetarian, I'd suggest trying it, it's so delicious. Two of my favorite orders are the Lara's Pittsburgh Princess (fries and coleslaw as the main toppings), or Puff the Magic Popper (cheesy goodness & fresh jalepenos for a super spicy kick). The soft pretzels or tater tots here are awesome sides to go for as well. Cheap drinks, too.\\n\\nService here is typically fast (although, because of it's popularity, you may end up waiting for a table here on the weekends, especially at night). I've never had a complaint about any of the staff here. \\n\\nThe atmosphere here is nothing too fancy. A bar and lots of sports and music memorabilia. They play local music, which is cool.

Just a few days ago, after walking in and waiting behind a gentleman who took about 10 minutes to order a bus of students from a soccer team walked in. There was now 30 people in line. About ten people in the kitchen and only one person at the registers. A fully packed line and only one register open. The food in itself isn't bad, that's if they even have it.

I returned a few days ago, visiting only for a long weekend. Being that Sonsie was a favorite establishment for me and my former coworker/current friend, in the past, we decided to meet there for brunch while I was in town. \\n\\nI had made us a 12pm reservation. When I got into my Uber pool at 11:15 (in Davis Square, Somerville, approx. 7mi away), it became immediately clear that I wasn't going to be on time. I immediately called Sonsie, and was extremely lucky that Reagan (Reegan? Spelling is unknown) answered the phone. I explained I would probably be about ten minutes late, to which she replied, genuinely, that she appreciated the call, and our reservation would be held.\\n\\nFast forward to ten after 12pm.... I am still in the Uber, still  at least twenty minutes away (due to traffic resulting from an accident). I once again called Sonsie, and again was #blessed to get Reagan on the line. I explained that I was trapped in traffic, and inquired whether or not the res could be changed to 12:45pm. She was completely empathetic, and explained that though my party may have a short wait, she would move the time back and make sure we weren't skipped over, once we arrived.\\n\\nMy friend and I arrive, go to the host stand, and I asked the three employees who greeted us, if any of them were Reagan. One of them smiles, and says, \\"That's me!\\" I let her know that I am *that* Jill, the one who has been calling/updating her on my arrival..... and can I just say that her reaction/smile/welcome was so genuine and so unexpectedly sweet, that I had to check myself to make sure I was still in snowy, cold Boston. Reagan's reaction to my arrival was so just so unexpected--- I mean, I was 45 minutes late. The fact that she understood, and was sympathetic to the fact, that my tardiness was out of my control, was sort of shocking. She immediately sat my party, but even in the few moments we were face-to-face, she had already impressed me.\\n\\nI hadn't seen my dining companion for months. So, as soon as we were seated, we fell into a focused conversation, which lulled only after we realized we hadn't been greeted in over fifteen minutes (read: we hadn't put in/received our booze yet). I hesitated, but figured I'd go let Reagan know, since she had already shown herself to be someone who actually gives a sh--\\nWhen I approached her, and let her know we hadn't seen our server, she exclaimed \\"Jill! No!\\" and zoomed towards the kitchen. I returned to my table, and the server was taking our order, less than a minute later. After our first round of drinks, the server informed us it had been comped. The rest of our meal was very nice, and overall, a nice experience. \\n\\nThat being said, I moonlight as a bartender, and have worked in restaurants for 20 years. Never would I have ever complained about my experience today.... but, it must be noted that I most likely wouldn't have left as satisfied if it had not been for Reagan. I know hostesses are an extremely underrated spoke in the wheel of the restaurant industry, but Reagan deserves to be recognized for going above and beyond.

It was salty & despite the egg over easy hidden inside, it didn't taste very breakfast-y. As a result, I ate the cheesy grits more than the behemoth of a sandwich. The grits were fine, but quickly filling, and afterwards I felt lethargic, needing to lay down. If I could go back in time I'd order something different, probably the fried chicken biscuit sandwich.

A larger group was merrily eating through many shared dishes and bottles of wine.  Our group of four enjoyed the grilled sausage with pepper - done to perfection, the veal dishes, and chicken with artichoke hearts and mushrooms.  The only - very minor - complaint was that our salads (very fresh) were over-dressed.  They were generous with their bread.  The meal was tremendously satisfying - we were too full to consider dessert, but I'll bet they're good.\\n\\nSo the food was easily among the best Italian I've had since moving to Boston from New York (North End ... meh).

For only $2 extra, I highly recommend as it really adds to the experience. They have a pretty flawless system where you line up outside for about 10 minutes and then the doors open. They ask what name the reservation is under and a host shows you to your table. As soon as you sit down you can hit up the buffet. It is all you can eat, but the reason I am rating it 3 stars or actually I would say 3.5 is because the food was just subpar. The scrambles (migas and chorizo), enchiladas and chicken were good, but everything else was just okay. I was not a fan of the brisket or the sausage. The cheese in the sausage wasn't even melted, which makes me think they were not cooked all the way. I am a huge brunch lover and sadly, the brunch here did not meet my expectations. I do however have to say that the band was amazing! They really got into it and really made the whole experience worth while. I loved the lead singer and her brother.

However, we heard mention of the Burgushi and decided we had to try it, since we love fusion and innovative food (and burger and sushi to boot). We ended up going twice in the span of three nights, so definitely a positive experience.\\nThe wait for a table was a tad too long, especially given how both times we ended at a mediocre table: they seem to have very few good spots and they seem to assign them erratically, no matter how long you are willing to wait. The service was good and attentive, even on the busiest of the two nights.\\nDrink wise, they have a good selection of cocktails and while I didn't particularly like the Strawberry and Fig vodka based concoction I chose, I admire their will to push boundaries, although where that really shines is in their food menu.\\nThe burgushi was an interesting combination and one that I'd suggest anyone (not vegetarian ) should try, although the novelty is probably stronger than the actual awesomeness: the rice enveloped beef is interesting but I'm unsure whether, in the long run, I would prefer t to a steak or, specifically, to one of their amazing burgers. They offer a gargantuan selection, with each burger presenting challenging, stimulating and overall delicious combinations. The verbosely named \\"The cow fish has left the building\\" will defy traditional pairing topping a burger already entrenched in peanut butter with fried bananas, delighting my wife's inclination for rich and structured taste, while their Black and Pear (or something like that) mashes the firm taste of a medium rare tasty angus patty with the pungent sweetness of berries and blue cheese.\\nEverything else from the menu was also intriguing, but we only got to sample some satisfying if not memorable sushi and some tiny, a tad overpriced but definitely delicious tuna nachos.\\nAll in all, a great experience that could benefit from some refinement in welcoming and sitting.

So here is the experience in a nutshell.  Be patient you will be waiting a while and you will meet amazing people. Bring chairs so sit on and bring beer and a cooler to pass the time. Ah yes the time well it goes by really quickly. Before you know it they someone will come out for your pre order. So they can tell the people at the end of the line hey we are out of ribs by the time we get here so don't order them. And don't think you can't finish it all you will. Ask the hostess for advice if you are over or under ordering.  We are new to ordering by the pound when it comes to bbq so we had just about enough to get us through. The sides well they are okay nothing crazy it's about the bbq not the sides. So anyway back to the waiting there is a coffee shop that opens around 8 so go pay a visit, and if you don't want to wait in line you can pre order too. I think there is a min weight limit.  But the lines are more fun and if you are lucky Aaron will come out if he he is in and talk to everyone. I think that is the best part.  Then  the frenzy starts just about quarter of and they don't open until the top of the hour.  Remember what you said in the pre order yea that goes out the window once you start seeing the carver freshly carved meats. It's an awesome experience so we over order and oh yea get the pies all of them. Remember you waiting in line since 5 am. Next no one can just hold tables inside without food and things move very quickly and within an hour it's all sold out on a busy morning.

It is a simple complaint, but nonetheless the more I think about it the more annoyed I am.  We came in last night around 6:00pm for dinner.  We sat in the cafe area and ordered 2 burgers with 2 side dishes.  We asked our server to substitute the fries for mixed greens.  We were told that we could not have this option, it is \\"against policy\\".  If we wanted to have the salad we would have to have the $9.00 salad off the menu.  I think that my $18 burger was pricey enough and it certainly did not warrant spending more to have some lettuce leaves on my plate.  \\n\\n I also work in the service industry, where everyday we compete for business and with the economy the way it is I would think that making guests happy (who want to return) is a priority more now than ever.  In addition to making guests feel accommodated, what about people who have diet restrictions and don't want to eat fries?  They have to spend an additional $9 to have something a little healthier on the side?  \\n\\nI wanted to let you know about this because I think it's something that should be noted and hopefully your establishment will focus less on enforcing unreasonable policies and concentrate more on creating happy customers."},{"name":"Bono Pizza","address":"1717 Northwest Blvd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Bravo Bono Pizza!

However Bono Pizza may need to join Dewey's in my short list of exceptions. \\n\\nWhen I walked in I was immediately greeted and handed a menu. I already had in mind what I wanted and was told it would be upwards of a 30 minute wait since there were three pizzas in front of me. I knew ahead of time this might happen from reading reviews and looking at the website before I ventured over. I was invited to hang out and read a paper if I wanted. When another employee showed up for her shift, the woman who originally helped me introduced her by name to each of the people waiting in the store. I was impressed she took the time to do this and was able to remember the names of what I presume were four strangers. Nice touch. \\n\\nThe space is very small and cramped but I found it very charming. \\nThere are small touches of the owners everywhere from the decorations on the wall to the mismatched chairs at the table. One of the other patrons was a culinary student and was invited to check out the oven where they cook the pies. There is also a mirror so you can watch each pizza cook from a cooler distance. \\n\\nBono Pizza is cash only and is attached to a beverage store. The parking is limited but shares a lot with Kroger next door. I would recommend calling ahead to order unless you're cool with waiting. \\n\\nI would like to note that currently there are signs all over the place that state the store is no longer BYOB until they 'figger it out'. I guess someone reported them to the liquor control agency so that perk is shut down until further notice. \\n\\nAs for the pizza...I ordered a Carolina (basically a Margarita with garlic).

I'll tell you my perfect scenario. I have my IPod on while playing Lazy Song by Bruno Mars, hand around my SO with a Starbucks in our hands. We think of where to go for brunch but not stressed about it. You're sick of the lineups at Sophie's, and the gigantic hearty breakfast is not that intriguing anymore. You drive past all the overrated restaurants that used to frequent (Ahem Hell's Kitchen) and you are disappointed because you're almost reaching UBC and haven't found anything. You suddenly see a contemporary storefront that's not too pretentious and you decide to go in.\\n\\n\\nYou go in and it's pretty empty. You later find out that it's a newer restaurant and the community has yet to discover it. There is a mutual agreement between us that this place is cool. The wood from the name of this place really shines. I hope the owner / chef is from BC because the abundance of wood plus green walls is refreshing during the late morning and elegant at night.\\n\\nWe realized we were hungry so let's peep the menu. Well, i deemed that it was a Saturday brunch so booze was appropriate. Caesar is the official brunch drink so the choice is clear. What we didn't realized was that this wasn't a normal Caesar, it was an Oakwood Caesar. It wasn't too spicy, and didn't get a sense of the tequila overpowering the beverage. The salt rim was so tasty that I kept licking it when noboday was looking.\\n\\nSo to even it up a bit so we don't look like alcoholics, we ordered two of the half dozen of selection in the brunch section. May I just go off tangent here and tell you how much I appreciate limited selection menus. I am not a big fan of menus with a hundreds things to choose from because it only means 1.) They are trying to please everyone, which means their best dishes are hidden somewhere. 2.)  How fresh is your inventory when you have to stock half of Costco to please everyone? Out of the six, we have chosen:\\n\\nBraised Short Ribs: For breakfast? YES! Slow braised short ribs that are so ever soft and succulent. It comes with a thin potato pancake for texture, freshly seasoned tomatoes to  ensure the overall dish is not too heavy, and finally, an egg that... well... represents the breakfast in brunch. (The run on sentences is reflecting how good everything is and a reassurance that I still have your attention.)\\n\\n\\n \\nAlbacore Tuna Nicoise Benedict: For those looking for an explanation of what nicoise means: it's a salad with mixed vegetables and tuna and/or anchovies. I love how subtle this combination is. A normal eggs benny is very heavy at times. The tuna, greens and replacement of the corn muffin lightens the load in the belly.\\n\\nWhat a great way to start off the day, full and semi-buzzed.

You can request Tabasco as well, which we did. \\n\\nI'm a fan of the Arnold Palmer, so we ordered a few of those. Love the classic fresh lemonade in the sweetened tea. It's perfect with seafood.\\n\\nI indulged in the Dungeness Crab and Bay Shrimp Louie Salad, it's a large one and worth the price with the amount of crab meat and shrimp. The homemade thousand is put underneath, so that it doesn't interfere with the seafood. The dressing should never distract.\\n\\nMy guy ordered the Parmesan and Horseradish crusted Steelhead. It was really good and a nice little combination. I want to try this myself at home and never would have thought of the combination. \\n\\nOur friend, who accompanied us to lunch ordered the Liver and Onions with Bacon. A traditional family favorite that she wanted to try. I had to try a bit, because I'm always curious. Although it didn't taste bad at all, it was a little too rich for me.\\n\\nLunch was perfect. I ordered what I wanted and it was awesome.

It was completely night and day. I basically felt like I  walked into a whole different restaurant. \\n\\nThe staff showed great guest service. We were also greeted by Chef Ryan who introduced himself and brought us a sample of a couple of his masterpieces. Given this was a rare occasion, I think that this might be a great opportunity for guest interaction. Think about how rewarding it could be for guests who waited 45+ mins to be seated. \\n\\nMoving on.. my guest and I were served by Lilly who knew the menu quite well. She was able to give a rundown of the menu like a script. Below is items we ordered, which 98% of the items were delicious. \\n\\nDrinks:\\nRoy Rogers - basic so it was good\\nChocolate \\"To Die For\\" - contains Godiva liqueur and was amazing. Make sure you have some water too, you may get thirsty.\\n\\nAppetizers:\\nCrispy Calamari \\"T & T\\" - sweet chili sauce was basic, but the way the calamari was prepared made it different from any other restaurant. \\nParmesan Truffle Fries- This was probably the dish that we felt didn't perform as well as the other dishes. The style of fries was great, the problem was proportions of fries vs the ingredients. Maybe less fries to accommodate the proportions. \\n\\nEntrees:\\nThe Thundering Herd Bison Burger - Thumbs up!!! Be careful it has a slight spicy kick to it. \\nThe Boursin Bacon Burger - Also a Thumbs up!! It was even better the next day as I had some leftovers. I almost suggest offering the cheese melted on the side. It can be tricky to eat as the boursin cheese has a slight paste-like texture.\\nMad Mango-Cado Roll - Was okay. We thought and wished that there were more mango in it. Its that sweet and savory factory that one assumes when somethings has the word mango in it. \\n\\nDessert:\\nWe did not get dessert because we were just too full. But will definitely require dessert be apart of our meal selection. \\n\\nAdditional Thoughts: \\nThe venue uses monitors that show a continuous digital aquarium. Although I think this is very clever and shows technical advancement, the medium is almost 2 dimensional. I think if they were to upgrade to more inimated/CGI it would go a long way for families that eat there. Kids might push their adults to take them back just for the aquarium.\\nBathrooms - we sat on the second floor and had to go to the 3rd floor in order to use the bathroom. Safety is extremely important and those stairs need some additional construction additions so that it doesn't become a slip hazzard. From my previous visit, we noticed many customers and workers almost slip and fell. \\nFish Tank -  There is a lovely aquarium on the second floor with an awesome Cowfish. Hopefully the restaurant can redesign the aquarium to be more fish friendly. Animal lovers would be concerned about the overall environment the fishes are in. \\n\\nAgain, I was extremely satisfied with the my experience during my second visit. I would highly suggest eating at The Cowfish if you want to try some unique dining options with common foods. \\n\\nI would suggest putting your name down at least an hour before you want to eat as the wait can be extremely long if you are already in your hungry phase. \\n\\nEnjoy!"},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"On the eve of Friday the 13th, I descended to eat chicken in a basement in Harvard Square.

Ok maybe the service will be better at this table? With a view of a fire extinguisher an open door looking into the kitchen pantry where the stainless steel wire self filled with clear plastic containers, stacks of plates bus tub and other items of storage. My other view was the employee worker gallery and expediter work center. Our waitress Madison came by right away and ask us for a drink order we order an amber beer and a glass of Pinot Gris. We looked around the dining room awhile and opened the menu looking through the whole menu we desired on our dinners. Madison returned with water and asking we need a little more time we said we could order and order the crab and artichoke dip. I order the pear and beet salad and the under the sun pizza my dinner guest order the clam chowder and the works pizza and Madison asked if we wanted the soup and salad with the dip or between the dip and the pizza we said between and she head off to start the order now it's been a good fifteen minutes sense we order our drink and Madison was bring them to the table watch what was going on while waiting I saw Madison heading towards the bar a couple of times I'm thinking the bar most be overwhelmed. With orders that is why it's taking so long. Our waitress sets down the dunks and returns with appetizers plates just in time for the crab dip to arrive. The dip was flavorful but the cheese topping was one big rubbery piece we had to remove it and cut it in to small little pieces and mix it back in. One of my pet peeve is having to fight with your food. The soup and salad showed up half way through the dip the chowder was good and the flavor of the salad was nice, could have been dished up to show off the pear , beets and walnuts better fore we eat with our brain first than our eyes, nose and then our mouths . When finished with the starters the dish were removed. Sipping on drinks and waiting 30 minutes for the pizza Madison cane by to check on us asking about our drinks and saying that it seems to be taken awhile on the pizzas. I had been watch the expediter and the gallery at that time and saw them taking out food bring food to the table next to us that was seated after our starters were finished. As I watch I see a pizza put up in the window and sit there under the heat lamp while three different people moved it around for the next 15 minutes a second pizza came up in to the window and a food runner pick it up with the first pie and start to bring it out of the gallery only to have to set it down to get a napkin in order to carry the hot plate of the pizza that sat there under the lamps . The runner came to our table and ask who had the works and sat it down in front of my dinner guest than sat the other one in front of me witch ended up being the works and the one he called the works was actually the under the sun. We shared a piece of each pizza so that the two of us could taint both it was flavored well but the heat lamp made mine chewy. Madison came by to check on us and I told her what I had seen going on with the timing between the two and she offered tore cool or get something else but by this time it was becoming a long meal. She did how ever talked us into a dessert. I would like to think the kitchen and bar just needs a little more time to get things perfect and that the entryway and host stand gets better at handling the crowd. I would of loved a better table in the place seeing I took the time to make a reservation so you could plan ahead.

Flavor-wise, the grapefruit mostarda really elevates this dish from being just another fried starchy creamy thing.

They have amazing meat patties...so deliciously seasoned and grilled to perfection. Still a tad pinkish in the center, and oh, so juicy and delicious. Fabulous homemade brioche buns...lightly crisp and still squooshy at the same time. Top it all with a slice of Tillamook cheddar (IS there any other cheddar, I ask??) and you have a burger purists' dream come true.\\n\\nHonestly, I can't exactly put my finger on what makes these burgers so delicious...but these taste as if they are made with angel's wings and leprechaun glitter.

It appeared the restaurant was under staffed and a bit busy, but our waitress made no effort to keep us apprised of the situation. If she had explained or apologized for the wait I would have been more understanding. The total of our order required a simple first course: one salad and two appetizers. It took a good forty-five minutes for these items to hit the table and they were not items that required extensive preparation. When the first course did come out it was mediocre at best. But at this point we had been waiting so long we did not care to complain. No one came by the table to see how everything was tasting. We felt completely neglected and irritated.

The juices did not run clear. After a long wait, the waiter brought another  order without asking if I wanted it after having the thigh bleed on my plate. This thigh was better, but had a large red vein in the middle. He told me that the brining had caused the red blood and red vein. I have never heard of anything that before as I brine chicken. Either way, I told him I was done with the chicken. The fried apple pie was very good, but I cannot recommend the hard chocolate tart. You just about have to break the plate to cut off a piece it is so hard.  Finally, they appear seriously understaffed. A single waiter was handling two parties of 6, a party of 4, and a party of 2.

I don't want to be a negative Nancy, but don't waste your time and money here. I've only been once, but I was excited to go, but it left a LOT to be desired. I went here with a friend to use a buywithme voucher. I hope those of you who bought those vouchers have a better food experience than we did... or just use them for margaritas. \\n\\nFirst, the good. This place looks so much better than when it did when it was Our House. It's super cute and clean inside. Also, the hostess and the waitress were very friendly (always a plus...going to restaurants with cranky staff members is just so unpleasant). And the house margarita was actually very tasty. As was the fried ice cream. \\n\\nSecond, the so-so. They gave us chips and salsa, but on the menu chips and salsa are listed as costing $3.50. What sit down Mexican restaurant charges for chips and salsa? I actually didn't look over the bill very closely, but I didn't notice that we were charged for it. I would assume that they'll just continue to give the free chips and salsa because really, who expects to pay for that?? The \\"salsa\\" was more like pico de gallo, but it tasted alright. Although I would suggest adding some jalapenos or serranos to this.  The prices were also ok. Not over the top, but a little more than I would expect to pay for what was being served. \\n\\nThird, the bad. The food. Oh it was bad. Soo bad.  I should mention that my friend who I was with is from Arizona and could be considered a bit of a Mexican food connoisseur. I on the other hand am from New England, so my expectations are far less than hers. For an appetizer we ordered queso fundido. I had never had this but my friend said it is amazing, so I said sure! I'm usually not picky and will eat just about anything. This wasn't something I would ever order again (from here anyway...). It was bland. Basically just cheese and some pulled chicken. Like I said, I've never had it so I have nothing to compare it to. It did taste a little better when I added some of the \\"salsa\\" we were given with our chips. It also said it came with flour tortillas, but my friend was convinced they were not flour tortillas even though she could not pinpoint what they were exactly. \\n\\nBoth of us were floored when we got our entrees. And not in a good way. I ordered a regular chicken chimichanga, and my friend ordered the poblano chimichanga. I don't eat a lot of fried food, but I do love a good chimichanga and that is what I was in the mood for. These were the weirdest looking chimis either of us had ever seen. I had ordered mine with red sauce which tasted akin to a marinara sauce. It was so weird. And the tortilla tasted more like an egg roll. It came with a side of lettuce (what?), beans, and really, really, REALLY dry rice. My friend also had the weird egg roll tasting tortilla, and her poblano sauce (which she said tasted like a cream of chicken sauce) had congealed before it got to the table. I'm assuming that they kept our entrees under a heat lamp while we were having our appetizer, but I would have preferred the food just come out instead of sitting and getting dried and congealed. We each ate a bite or two, and had to ask for sour cream and guacamole to make it edible. It still wasn't great. It was dry, it was bland, it was not at all what we were expecting. When the waitress came over to ask how things were we just said they were interesting. It didn't seem logical to send them back as they would still have weird sauces on them and not be what we were expecting in the first place. \\n\\nAll in all, we had high hopes for this place, but were enormously disappointed. Since I have only been once, I'll give two stars even though I don't know how deserving that is. \\n\\nI hope some of this is just because they are a new restaurant, otherwise I don't see this place lasting, especially in this particular location with so many other options around."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

Screen Door didn't open until 9am and we made it out to Burnside and 24th by 8am so we stopped at the Starbuck's just down the street to grab something hot to drink.  It's a good thing we got their early.  We've heard that the line can be major so thankfully we drove back to park closer to the place and got in line at around 830am which was perfect.  There were maybe 10 people ahead of us.  I peeked at the menu and immediately saw \\"Shane's breakfast corndogs\\" and \\"Fried Chicken Cathead Biscuit Sandwich\\".  NOM!  The door opened promptly at 9am and we were ushered in.  The first thing you notice is the delicious smell of the place and then the full bar...very nice.    \\n\\nAfter looking at the menu and seeing that they also had Fried Chicken and Waffles I was torn.  Cathead Biscuit Sandwich or Fried Chicken and Sweet Potato Waffle.  Needless to say we will be going back to try other things but at that moment I had a desire for something smothered in gravy so I picked the sandwich.  The sandwich comes with your choice of potatoes or grits.  I opted for the potatoes wanting to give my plate a balanced landscape.  Our neighbors to the table at my left said everything on the menu was good and that the Fried Chicken and Waffle was a hefty serving.  Thankfully, I also took that into consideration when deciding on the sandwich.  Our neighbor to my right however went big and ordered the chicken and waffle.  When it arrived Sarah quickly grabbed my attention and urged me to take a picture.  Our neighbor was kind enough to let me photograph four monstrous pieces of boneless fried chicken stacked one atop the other on a gorgeous sweet potato waffle with a steak knife down the middle to keep it from falling over.  WOAH!  My mouth watered.  Shortly after that our food arrived and while not as vertically stunning as my neighbor's plate the Fried Chicken Cathead Biscuit was still impressive.  A whole boneless fried chicken breast rested on top of a massive biscuit, was then smothered with sausage gravy and then topped with the other half of the biscuit.  To the side was a healthy serving of home fried potatoes and a side of ketchup.  Sarah had the biscuits and gravy with eggs and she and I both commented first on the gravy.  It truly made a statement with its chunks of sausage spread throughout the perfectly seasoned gravy.  I typically add a little pepper and sometimes salt when needed but this masterpiece needed neither.  I sliced a piece of fried chicken, dipped it in the gravy to get a little extra coverage and then my taste buds were off to the races.  BLISS!  The crispy batter had the perfect amount of salt and spice and the chicken was succulent, cooked through and not at all dry.  Not wanting to give the potatoes a backseat to this flavor joyride, I popped one into my mouth without ketchup at first to get the full effect of the seasonings.  Wow, very nicely done Screen Door!  Potatoes were cooked through and seasoned well.  The potatoes were cut fairly big but still had the right crunch on the outside while the inside was nice and fluffy.  We were happy and content.  We even had food left on our plates to take home. \\nNow although I noticed the full bar upon walking in, I chose to stick to a cup of Stumptown coffee (my favorite).  Sarah on the other hand bravely ordered a Bloody Mary.  It was garnished with an olive and pickled okra which she happily reported was delicious.  The drink she says was a bit on the spicy side but she enjoyed it nonetheless.  Next time, I will be sure to join her in a drink and have a Mimosa seeing as I am not a fan of Bloody Mary's in general.  Overall the food was great, the service awesome, the drinks tasty and effective and the price very affordable.  The biscuits and gravy with eggs, biscuit sandwich, egg and biscuit for the little man, Bloody Mary, and refillable coffee came to just $32 before tip.  Awesome!  As mentioned before, we will be going back for more.  The regular menu and the specials just beg to be conquered.  \\n\\nOf course as always, don't take my word for it.

The Dion's OMG roll had tempura flakes, coconut shrimp, avocado, mango, and a honey marmalade drizzled on top of the roll and on the plate. The Prime Time roll had lobster and cucumber on the inside, sliced rare filet with truffled mushrooms and spicy mayo on the outside. I would have liked the filet to have been seasoned to really make each piece pop in your mouth. The kids meal was served as a bento box with chicken nuggets, fries, apple slices, and a Rice Krispie treat adorned with Swedish fish.

I had read reviews that to avoid a line, try coming closer to closing time. Yes, you run the risk of most everything being sold out, and I was willing to take the gamble. Soooo, we arrived around 2:15p and there were 4 ppl outside the door.  I was psyched at this. And the weather in Austin was a bit cool today, so heat was not an issue. After a few minutes in line, the manager comes out (I think he's a manager) and tells us waiting that they are very close to being sold out and that likely there would only be chopped beef sandwiches left.. he also said we are about 45 minutes to get to counter. We were OK with this since this was the risk we took. As we made it closer, he comes around again and says.. \\" out of pulled pork and ribs.\\" I was definitely disappointed about the ribs but glad that there was still brisket, turkey, sausage. Of course, the person in front of us snatched the last sausage link. BUT we were still able to get 1.5 lbs brisket (fatty and lean), pound of turkey, and chopped beef sandwich, burbon and banana pie, and pecan pie.

It was a surprise birthday dinner party only to be treated horribly by the hostess from hell!\\nWhen we arrived, my granddaughter who is 16 went in to say we are here. The horrible hostess yelled at her saying \\"We don't seat unless everyone is here and you will lose your reservation!\\" My family was finding parks and let out everyone while they parked, as there is no \\"real parking space\\" only neighborhood. We were a party of 13 but my husband was still finding park and horrible hostess said, \\"Either you take your reservation now or you lose it!\\" So we sat down thinking it should be no issue to add on two chairs. When my hubby found the park and he and my grandson came in, we asked to add a chair, but here comes horrible hostess on a mission to recite, \\"I said you all have to be here, I will see what I can do.\\" The table next to us connected eyes with me and shook their head. Horrible hostess set up a table on the other side of the restaurant which my brother and grandson sat at so I could sit with my husband. There was a great couple behind me who suggested that they were willing to move to the table so we could be together. I thanked them and told our waiter (by the way the waiter, Matthew, was amazing and did his best to be very kind compared to the evil horrible hostess). Matthew told the horrible hostess that the couple were willing to move, and by her actions and look on her face, she was not having it! She came to the couple and told them they don't have to move, as if we asked them. The couple told her they want to move and she was so nice to them and accommodating like they were royalty. Then she immediately turns to me and said, \\"Now look, in the future, if you all are not here they are not going to be seated, you have to all be here!\\" I was stunned at her attitude and bit my tongue because at this point, I was fed up with her attitdue and my family and myself just felt she had issues with people of color. She was mean, rude and made our table a spectacal as each time this person went into her rage it drew attention. Shame of her and her nasty attitude. Thank goodness for our waiter as my children felt she did not destroy our joy....nasty nasty horrible hostess!

The outside was slightly crispy and the inside was tender.\\n\\n- Dok Bokghi- it was a favorite at the table! It consisted of tender rice cakes, assorted vegetables, and fishcakes drenched in a spicy-sweet sauce. The sauce contained a perfect amount of heat and was so savory. The portion is on the smaller side.\\n\\n- Kalbi Tang- we thought a beef stew would be a good way to conclude the meal, and it was! This dish consisted of a rich beef broth, vermicelli noodles, scallions, and short ribs (less of the meat, more of the bone). I was really surprised by the broth because it looked watered down, but taste-wise, it wasn't!

Our waitress Jillian attended to us right away and throughout the entire night. She was awesome. We also enjoyed the small menu there were only four options to choose from for appetizers at about five options for the pizza. I appreciate when restaurants do a few things very well rather than overwhelm you with choices.\\n\\nWe first ordered the crispy potatoes with aioli and the Greek nachos. The potatoes were true to their name very crispy tender and flavorful The aioli complemented them well. The Greek nachos had a lot of toppings and we're also very flavorful. I would order both again they were the perfect size for three people to share as appetizers.\\n\\nWe then order the squash pizza. It came out very quickly with a crispy perfectly chard crust and warm melted cheese covered with fresh zucchini and squash bites. It was the perfect size pizza and there were six slices total which fed the three of us well. \\n\\nAlthough we were stuffed we did glance at the dessert menu and decided to order the basil ice cream with granola and berries. Oh my God. One of the best desserts I've ever had. The ice cream was exactly that, sweet vanilla ice cream that was infused with fresh basil and it tasted exactly like both in the best way. The granola and blueberries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries complemented the dish very well and it did not last very long.

There was no cutting fee for a cake, so we brought one with us and gave it to the hostess to put in the freezer (it was an ice cream cake and we explicitly told her so). They then went to seat us at a table in front of the kitchen and as we sat down, they collected our menus and told us they wanted to seat us at a booth. Apparently they could take \\"their chances with stuffing six slender ladies\\" into a booth... We started off with bloody mary's and a bloody masa (delicious, made with tequila) and then ordered our food. We all ordered either the Southwestern Eggs Ben and the Huevos Rancheros with sides of chorizo and bacon.\\n\\nHere's where things went SUPER south. The hostess then told the server that we wanted the check and it immediately came right as they were clearing the plates. A friend went to the hostess and told her we needed more time and asked to bring the cake out. They then laid out napkins and spoons out on the table again (if it had been a surprise, it would have been ruined) and then after 10  minutes, brought the cake out. No one recognized the cake they brought out - it had melted so much that instead of it being a cute square cake, it looked like a child's volcano experiment. Apparently, someone found it on a table in the hot kitchen when we asked for them to bring out the cake and they put it in a freezer for 10 minutes before they brought it out... \\n\\nSo laughing hysterically at a less than perfect situation, we sang her happy birthday. I asked for a knife to cut the cake and they said they could do it themselves. So back went the cake and 5 pieces came back and when we asked for the last one, we were told it was coming. 10 minutes later, we asked again and the gentleman who cut the cake said when he looked over there were only 5 of us, even though all 6 of us were at the table the entire time and he was present when we all sang. The pieces of cake that came out were drizzled in raspberry sauce and whipped cream, I'm assuming in an attempt to make up for the melted cake. And let me tell you, I HATE RASPBERRY SAUCE. It's literally my one major culinary dislike. I think it should be banned. Forever. \\n\\nBut it gets better (and by better, I mean worse), instead of comping something, they ended up bringing out the one person in our party who didn't \\"get any cake\\" a dessert from their menu. This is a little strange, considering it was someone else's birthday... and she didn't really want it. \\n\\nFinally, when we wanted to pay the guy and the hostess who kept screwing things up brought out 6-tequila shots. At 1:30pm. On a Sunday. I'm sure many parties would have enjoyed this, but it wasn't something that our entire party could enjoy.

Well, this place might provide \\"decent\\" food or food you might love according to your tastes, but that's if you manage to stick around long enough to get your order.

Well the first 2 were alone when we got there.  The waitress was just slow and really bad at her job.  The cook apparently got confused and messed up orders.  I could go on and on about the bad service we got, but in the end I can sum it up with the fact that everything came out at separate times for 4 people.  The first items, waffles, arrived about 30 minutes before the last items, an egg and cheese sandwich and another plate with 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and a cheddar biscuit.  The egg sandwich was done like a grilled cheese which was not what was wanted, and the eggs on my plate were barely warm.  I waited a total of maybe 45 min for those darn eggs!  I would have left way earlier, but since I was meeting my friends and felt it was rude to them to just walk out on them, I stayed.  Nothing was comped.

However, I was quite pleasantly surprised and will likely be back the next time I have a craving for decent BBQ.\\n\\nA deceptively large restaurant with outdoor seating and a party atmosphere come nightfall (esp on weekends), I imagine this place gets noisy when it's full.  It was very quiet when I went, aside from a herd of wild, unsupervised children.  That's not the fault of the restaurant, though.  Decor is typical for a BBQ joint.  Trying to be \\"roadhouse\\".  Adequate, but nothing to write home about really.  I did rather like the couch and coffee table set up in the back by the bar, though.  I bet that would be a nice seat to sit with friends while throwing back a beer or two.  The bathroom was also interesting with its 4 types of soap for you to try.  Bit strange, perhaps, but I always like when restrooms make that extra effort to make things interesting and comfortable.\\n\\nAnyways, the food.  I ordered a BBQ pork sandwich with mac and cheese.  The sandwich itself was very tasty.  The meat was soft and juicy, and the sauce delightfully tangy.  Nothing particularly unusual, but very solid BBQ flavor.  It completely filled and fell over the edges of the soft bun, and was topped with a pickle - cute touch.  Better yet, the sandwich came with a slab of cornbread and sweetened butter which was absolutely amazing - better than Smokey Bones' or Cracker Barrel's.  Soft, chewy, and tender, it was one of the highlights of the meal.  The mac and cheese, however, was a bit of a disappointment, but mostly due to my personal preference.  This was very much your homemade comfort food - noodles topped with cheese instead of enveloped, with the cheese having a slightly curd-light texture instead of smooth or velvety.   I used to get the same style of the stuff at the cafeteria in college, so I know it's just a style.  However, I'm more into the super smooth variety, so for this reason I probably will not order this side in the future.  \\n\\nThe only weird thing is how limited the menu was.  If you look online, Hoggy's appears to offer a ton of things, including not only BBQ but prime rib, fish, and steaks.  I don't recall any such items being on the menu during my visit - perhaps it was just the time of day?  \\n\\nMeanwhile, service was adequate.  The waitress I had was okay - not overly excited about her job but polite and efficient.  However, the food was brought out by a man who put the food on the table without even a word (I think he said \\"pulled pork sandwich?\\" maybe, but no \\"enjoy\\" or even a smile).  Very curt.  I don't know this is a problem, per say, but I did notice.  Sorta goes along with the \\"dive-y\\" feel they are trying to cultivate though, I suppose.  \\n\\nPrices, meanwhile, are a bit higher than I would expect for this type of place - $9 for the sandwich.  It's not astronomical or unheard of, but it does put this place out of the \\"every day\\" price range for me.  \\n\\nAnyways, I think Sticky Lips in Rochester blows it out of the water, but for Delaware, Hoggy's is definitely worth a visit if you're in the mood for decent BBQ or cornbread."},{"name":"Art Bar","address":"40 Edwin H Land Blvd","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I stayed at the Royal Sonesta the week on business and pretty much ate here as it was convenient given the long work days.\\n\\nThe place is comfortable.

Not sure what's up but it certainly is not up to par with what I've had previously from them.  The frosting is really good with the cream cheese flavor, but the cupcake itself didn't taste rich, tasted too bready instead of a rich cake, and it certainly didn't feel fresh (the bready consistency).   Maybe they just needs more oil to grease it up a little and make it fluffier. \\n\\nAnd what's up with not having a display case for all the cupcakes?

Can't wait for my next week craving"},{"name":"YumDiggity","address":"209 Edgewood Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"YumDiggity is a gourmet hot dog stand located inside the Sweet Auburn Curb Market in downtown Atlanta.  Since it's at the Sweet Auburn Curb Market, it's only open during the day and with limited hours to boot (Mon-Sat, 11am-4pm).  If you're ever at the market, I recommend these guys because, unlike some of the other eateries (e.g. Bell Street Burritos, Grindhouse Killer Burgers), you can't find them anywhere else.  This is their only location.\\n\\nThese hot dogs are on a different level because of the ingredients used.  All of the sausages are handmade from all-natural meats (beef, chicken) with no fillers or artificial additives.  Veggies dogs are available.  That said, expect to spend more here than you would for a typical hot dog.  One hot dog runs about $5.00.  Combos (hot dog, side, and drink) range from $6.25 to $8.25.  Most toppings come at an additional price.\\n\\nThe hot dogs are delicious and the ingredients are fresh.  Unfortunately, they've been out of the German bratwurst the times I've visited, but I have had a chance to try their all-beef frank and their spicy Italian sausage.  You can really taste a difference in the freshness and quality of the sausages -- they're just bursting with flavor.  The Italian sausage is packed with I don't know how many spices and it's evident in taste, texture, and by looking at a cross-section of the frank.  The sausages are big and easily stick out both ends of the bun.  Each hot dog comes with a small pickle spear.\\n\\nThe bun is simple and, as long as you don't overdo it on the toppings, holds up well.  Toppings I've tried and recommend include the sauteed onions and peppers, jalapenos, sauerkraut, and chili.  The toppings are piled on high.  I suggest keeping the toppings minimal and simple so you can enjoy the franks.  That's where it's at.\\n\\nThe sides are OK.  I've tried the sweet potato fries ($2.50) and the onion rings ($3.00).  The sweet potato fries are thick and dense.  Most other restaurants' sweet potato fries are a slightly thinner and crispier (and also more greasy).  The onion rings are freshly cut and look light and airy.  The batter is delicate and contains a bit of green garnish (parsley? scallion?).  Not bad, but the side should probably be split as the rings are quite oily.\\n\\nFountain drinks, canned drinks, and sweet tea are available ($1.25) and homemade strawberry lemonade is made on-site ($1.75).  If dining in, bar seating is available at the stand.  The market also has two dining areas with plenty of tables, ideal for group gatherings.\\n\\nParking tickets can be validated for one hour."},{"name":"Bambinelli's","address":"3202 Northlake Pkwy NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I have to come here at least once per week for the past couple of years as I work right around the corner of Northlake Pkway.  I have to say; the food here never fails to impress.  The consistency, the flavors, the customer service, down to the simplicity of the ownership of this restaurant.  Just exquisite.  The owner, Bonnie, is all about customer service.  This place has been family owned since 1980 and there's a reason why it still is today.\\n\\nMy favorites are the PIZZA, PIZZA, PIZZA, eggplant parmigiana, gnochhi quattro formagio, chicken francese and chicken parmigiana.  One more thing.  Those. Breadknots.  SO pillowy, garlic-filled and delicious when dipped in that Minestrone soup.  I don't know what they put in that soup, but it is a fall favorite of mine.  Their salad is also pretty good, but it's all in that dressing as well.  That ranch dressing has been saved for a few days in our refrigerator at work after a Bambinelli's party and that's when everyone brings some salad from home to work for lunch the days that proceed.  For that ranch dressing.  Yes.  We bring salad from home for the leftover dressing.\\n\\nWhat I love about their pizza is that it tastes New York Style, but super authentic.  They make their sauce fresh every morning and there's something in that secret sauce that keeps me going for more.  From my favorite, which is simply cheese pizza, to their veggie (Kalamata olives, onions, green peppers...SO GOOD).\\n\\nI recently got their tiramisu and it was decadent, fluffy and filled with all the flavors it promised.  Brandy, espresso, cream and delicously soft ladyfingers soaked.\\n\\nFor a place I've frequented so many times, to never have a bad experience is extremely rare.

Large, tender chunk of white chicken mixed without gobs of mayo. It's probably the most healthy and tasty you'll get in town. There is also a delightful little tuna salad if that's your bag.\\n\\nSome of the vegetable sides I tried were a thick, sliced eggplant with a garden veggie pico mix, zucchini, bean salad, and more. Make your own salad with spring mix, romaine and/or arugula! Hot bar options included black beans, mashed potatoes, and brazilian rice. The tomato bisque is heavenly! A few cheese options including Gouda and a white cheddar(?) with dill. \\n\\nIf you aren't satisfied with the buffet, you can add a meat side for $5 or more dollars, and they bring you a skewer of fresh grilled meat. \\n\\nIn the evening, they do the traditional Churrasco style dinner, similar to Texas de Brasil.

From my research there were three things I wanted to try and below are my opinions of each one.\\n\\n1.  Fried Green Tomatoes:  Pretty good!  The goat cheese does a good job at cutting the acidity in the tomato and the sauce and balances out the dish.  I did however think the batter was a little thick but other than that, not too shabby.\\n\\n2.  She-Crab Soup: Reminded me a lot of lobster bisque.  The soup itself was generous in real chunks of crab meat and is definitely a treat.  Just a tad bit but otherwise very nice.\\n\\n3.  Buttermilk Fried Chicken:  Very flavorful.  Each component of the dish   by itself (Fried Chicken, Garlic Saut√©ed Collard Greens, and Smashed Potatoes) was very delicious but when you cut the chicken up and mix it in with the potatoes, collard greens and honey thyme jus, wow.  It's like an explosion of flavor.  The chicken was crunchy, juicy and slightly sweet.

You will never have a meal you dont like (in my humble opinion) - cooked well, good ingredients and well seasoned. it's not stunning, but simple honest food. They have weekly specials for burgers, pizzas and pastas. Their specials usually rock alot more than their standard menu - but my favourite dishes by far are the Buffalo Wings and the Chorizo Burger - awesome!\\n\\nThe Drink (5/5)\\n\\nThe beer selection ABSOLUTELY ROCKS. They have ever changing taps - 12 rolling beers from various local micro-breweries as well as a great wine selection and all not massively expensive. A great place to put down 'the base layer' with some good quality drinks. \\n\\nThe Service (4.5/5)\\n\\nThey are mega attentive but not pushy. I prefer to sit at the bar, but hey - that's just me. The staff are friendly, like to talk, and know their stuff. The only downer is that they cant always keep up their super smiles and friendliness when it gets mega busy.\\n\\nChris' Final Thoughts (4/5)\\n\\nGreat for a second or third date and also great for a tried and trusted place to booze and eat at the same time.

The chicken is breaded and cooked perfectly. You bite into it and you get the best taste of slightly spicy and salty and whatever other spices they put into it. The maple syrup adds to the over all dish and makes it salty and sweet. This dish in itself made the whole wait worth it! GET THIS DISH!! GET IT AND YOU WONT REGRET IT! I WANT IT NOW IF I COULD GO BACK TO PORTLAND!! SO GOOoooooooddd!!! It's also huge and you could probably share it with 3 people. \\n\\nPraline bacon waffle: the bacon praline that is laid upon it is very good. Perfectly sweet and crispy, Whatever glaze they put on that thing is pure heaven. It doesn't end there, their waffle has pieces of nuts and bacon on it. This was  bacon lovers dream dish! \\n\\nFried oyster benedict: this was my least favorite of the 3. The fried oyster was delicious but their benedicts were alright. I do have to say that I thought a fried oyster would have been on top of the benedict but it was laid to the side of it. So it was more like eggs benedict with fried oyster on the side. Either way, the dish was still satisfying. \\n\\nIf you go to Portland, you NEED to come here! It's totally worth the crazy lines you'll have to wait for. Another plus, is that it's totally affordable, around 10 - 15$ for all the dishes.\\n\\nTip: There is a nice local coffee shop located near Screen Door.

The tapas were good but 50% of them were seafood.  I think they should offer a wider arrange for those that don't like fishy smells/tastes/female organs.

This is not skinny food.  This is not healthy food.  This is goooood food.\\nI walk up and they instantly recognize me and thank me for coming by to check it out.\\nI ordered a 2-meat plate with potato salad and cole slaw.  I told em I had to have fatty brisket, and he gave me a freaking slab of it.  Bravo my man, moist, with a thick burnt end full of good ole char flavor.  The sausage, which comes from Texas Sausage Company, was nice and meaty, with a heavy pepper flavor.  The only drawback was it had a really thick casing that was a little tough to rip through, thank god for my wonderful carnivorous jaws.  Well, maybe it was a good contrast to the melt in your mouth meat-butter they called brisket.  The sides were simple, which is good.  I hate it when people try to dress up things like cole slaw and potato salad.  \\nLast, but certainly not least, was the sauces.  I've read a little bit of negative feedback about their sauces, and let me assure you, they are wrong.  The sauces are superb.  Espresso Bar-B-Q was as thick and dark as blackstrap molasses, and tastier than the nectar of the gods.  The sweet sauce, contrary to what several people have written, was perfect.  Good enough to bottle and sell.  I tried the pork sauce, but am saving my opinion of it til I have a lil sammich to try it on, and the hot sauce was loaded with cayenne flavor without being unbearable.\\nMy point is, these guys do one thing, and I'll be damned if they don't do it well."},{"name":"Moonshine 152","address":"152 Dorchester Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Moonshine 152 is but a short walk away from the Broadway T station on the Red Line.

I've been to many korean town chicken restaurants and have never been so disappointed than going to this hole in the wall. \\n\\nThe menu for Boom Beer is extremely minimal.  They have a handful of fried boneless chicken platters at the usual 1/2 or full size platters appropriate for sharing,  as well as a select number of spicy soups,  and of course beer.  We ordered a 1/2 order of the cheese chicken (which also comes with ricecakes layered underneath)  and the fish cake oden. \\n\\n=Food=\\nThe cheese chicken was mediocre at best,  and largely overpriced for the amount of chicken on the plate.  On average the chicken pieces were about a third of other korean chicken vendors (daeji,  big chicken town).  The presentation was decent with a homemade flavour /style.  This dish is very spicy,  we requested the dish be made mild,  but it still made us want at least an extra glass of water.  The fish cake oden was also lacklustre.  Being priced at nearly $10 this dish was basically herby, spicy water with a few pieces of underflavored fish cakes lazily thrown in.  In comparison,  simiarly priced odens at Guu and other japanese places contain much more flavor and substance.  2/5 stars. \\n\\n=Service=\\nTruthfully this restaurant is quite small,  with barebones decor and minimal staffing,  so the food quality could be lightly overlooked if the service was decent. We came here on a cold and rainy Thursday night in November and requested hot water (as they did not even have tea on request).  The \\"waitress\\"  stated that they did not have hot water and cold water was all they could suffice.  Absolutely unacceptable.  Furthermore we requested a refill of our tap water in which she simply handed us gave us a container of water which was only 1/3 filled.  During our stay,  there were also another party who left halfway through their dinner to have a smoke steps outside the restaurant doors.  Being an asthmatic and sensitive to smoke,  I found the lack of concern by the waitress extremely unsatisfactory. 1/5 stars. \\n\\nOn the interior Boom Beer looks like a cheaply renovated,  previous Indian restaurant that couldn't spare any extra funds for a modern tv that could at least compliment its beer-bar vibe.  Occasionally such restaurants prove themselves as hidden gems with quality food and/or service,  but unfortunately Boom Beer falls flat on both regards.  Overall if you're looking for a place to smoke and drink,  and experience terrible service -  great,  you've found it,  but otherwise please spare yourself the trouble of visiting this hidden and subpar korean chicken eatery.

My rationale:\\n\\nFirst Act: the wait is real; we arrived at 10:40 or so. Doors open promptly (if not a little before) 11. Our wait, being 5th or so in line, was still 20 minutes past the hour. Listen, I like good customer service as much as the next guy, and they're extremely friendly, but I want my food!\\n\\nSecond Act: the fatty brisket, hailed as the piece de resistance, can be too fatty. When you eat the right piece, it's good. I mean, it's GOOD, like comparable to any other brisket in the great state of Texas (caveat: that I've tried thus far). The problem is, that bite is just too few and far between on the plate; there's an abundance of fat. Skip the regular brisket. My friends raved about the pork ribs; you'll have to take their word for it. Lastly, no chicken. Consider the lobster (in this case, the lobster is the one person in your party that doesn't eat red meat).\\n\\nInterlude: the sauce. As I said, I'm all about the sauce. For BBQ purists, this is likely blasphemy. For me, call it an alternative lifestyle. I like the three sauce offering, although none truly hit the spot. They've got an espresso sauce that sounds better than it actually tastes. The other two (if I recall correctly, one spicier than the other) are solid, if unspectacular. Sorry, no further comments here.\\n\\nThird Act: the sides. Forgettable. I'm partially sure we got cole slaw and potato salad.\\n\\nRequiem: I'm partial to giving Franklin another try, this time with lowered expectations. However, I'm wondering if the scarcity of resources (if you haven't read other Yelp reviews, this place sells out pretty quickly) skews the value theory of this place (contributing to the ridiculously high star ranking).

I went here with five friends on a Saturday evening.  We made reservations, which is very much needed due to their popularity.  They do not offer valet, so you must find street parking or you can park in a big pay lot across the street. We arrived on time and were promptly seated.  Drinks were our first priority and we began with a bottle of chardonnay and pinot noir.  I'm not sure of the brand of each, but they were good.  Next, we ordered appetizers consisting of pimento cheese (excellent), crab cakes (good) and fried green tomatoes (excellent).  For dinner, I had the carolina trout with braised artichokes, swiss chard, burnt orange vinagrette.  It was so tasty and delicious.  Others ordered the hanger steak (excellent, ordering next time), the braised boar (good) and the fried chicken (always excellent).  Everything was so tasty.  The service was great, but the prices are a little on the pricy side.  Also, it is very noisy and can be hard to hear sometimes.  Overall, it was a great experience and I would recommend it for any small, adult parties."},{"name":"Masa","address":"439 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I really wanted to like Masa, but unfortunately it never managed to wow me. I've been here twice for brunch and while the atmosphere and decor was lovely, I didn't think the food was that great. The first time around I got the Sante Fe eggs benedict and my boyfriend got the ultimate breakfast burrito. We also ordered drinks, a mojito for him and a bloody mary for me. These were alright, nothing special. I wanted to like my eggs, but something about the flavor profile just didn't sit right with me. As for my boyfriend's burrito, it looked pretty ordinary, although size-wise it was huge and he was unable to finish it. \\n\\nThe second time we went we both got the same thing (although I can't remember what it was) and the both of us somehow got sick. Not full-blown food poisoning, but definitely nauseous. That really turned me off to Masa, it just wasn't pleasant.\\n\\nThe most positive thing I can say about this place is that the cornbread with spreads is absolutely amazing. The cornbread itself is excellent, the perfect level of sweetness and a great crumby but moist texture. It can totally hold up on it's own, but the spreads take it to a whole other level. The three spreads are apricot habanero jelly, sweet butter, and cranberry chutney. Of the three spreads my favorite is the butter. I would love to have a giant tub of it to take home, I'd put it on everything. It's pretty unfortunate that the complimentary starter is the yummiest thing at Masa."},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The most amazingly non meal I have ever eaten in my entire life!

But the food and service was so lackluster that I would never come back here.  I had the sirloin for $37 - not a small price - and it was unedible.  I ate about 3 bites of it.   First, not great quality for the meat - I know it's not a steakhouse but you can serve a decent cut of meat for $37.  Second, I asked for it medium rare, and it was definitely cooked medium.   The plate comes with mashed potatoes and onion rings, both flavorless, and not helped by the fact that the waiter never came back to ask if I wanted any condiments.  And since the waiter never came back, I couldn't tell him my steak was medium.  \\n\\nOne of my friends had roast chicken and was suitably unimpressed (but he admitted he only ordered it because the waiter said it was fantastic) and my other friend who was from California had the blue fish and said the restaurant wouldn't survive a day in the bay area with food like that.   \\n\\nWe ordered a lot of expensive wine so we were a bit flummoxed by the lack of attention we got from the waiter (although every table, regardless of how much $$ they are spending, should get attention from a waiter if that restaurant cares).  It wasn't even crowded so that can't be the excuse.   When the waiter finally did come back, he should have asked why my plate still had almost all it's food on it or if I wanted to take it home.

We also ordered the beignets which besides the salad was the next best thing I had. Who doesn't love warm fried dough and powder sugar! Yum\\n\\nOverall, it wasn't horrible but it wasn't good.

Note to self: do not go to an outdoor concert in Austin in July.  It's just not worth it; I am not a tropical girl.\\n\\nI liked the casual, back-yard feel of the venue.  It feels very Texas, and I liked that.  The sound is pretty amazing for an outdoor venue, so cheers to that!  I could hear everything crisply without getting my eardrums blown out.  Heck, even my gym can't manage that.\\n\\nI didn't try the food, so I can't speak to that.  They definitely know what they're doing in the drinks business, though.  They have a bunch of little bars around the sides so the lines never build up.  This is smart, and seems to be working well.  I also liked the free giant coolers of water and cups they set up in the back.  \\n\\nThe only downsides are limited places to sit and port-o-potties.  I know this is a concert, but it would be nice to have a few places to sit.  This is especially important in 105 degree heat.  People were sitting in random places; I sat on a big rock for a bit so I wouldn't pass out.  The port-o-potties are plentiful, and despite what another reviewer wrote, they DO have hand sanitizer (appreciated).  However, they are port-o-potties, and port-o-potties in the dark in 105 degree heat are bad news.  I think I've had nightmares about this very situation.\\n\\nI definitely recommend Stubb's as a venue, but probably wouldn't go back in the middle of summer."},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Cowfish was a great addition to CityWalk.

I asked if there was any substitution for the bean cake.  The only option was a potato cake. (Strange that they would be so restrictive .)  I said  i would stick with the bean cake. (Later the waiter said my response was I didn't want either.)  When the waitperson served the crab cakes there was no bean cake or vegetables.  The waitperson acknowledged that the vegetable side was missing and said it would be coming.  It never came.  When the check came I asked the wait person about the vegetables.  The wait person initially said the entree did not include that.  Then after reading the menu the wait person claimed I said I didn' want them.   Bottom line - I only got what was essentially two $8 appetizers.   I would have been happy to just pay that $16,  But the waitperson was argumentative.  Before leaving the waitperson arrived with two small carry out containers  of mac and cheese and squash.  Too little too late.  I usually don't eat leftovers anyway.   The crab cakes were good.

Sometimes, communication was a bit challenging because it's a pretty small operation (emails often take a day or two for responses), but be patient. I'm very happy that I chose her for my big day and it was worth every penny. Though I went with Champagne toast and Devil's food candied orange for my layers, try her rose petal lemon cake! My mom and I thought it would be too intense for the wedding cake, but - as lemon fans - we thought it was amazing!"},{"name":"Teppanyaki Japanese Steak House","address":"27 Waltham St","city":"Lexington","stars":"3","text":"While this is not my normal venue, it was nothing that a few sake bombs wouldn't fix.\\nOrdered both sushi and the teppanyaki.  No complaints about the sushi.  Was fresh and flavorful.  Teppanyaki was of the same quality that you might get at a good quality americanized chinese food place.  Not authentic, but still mighty tasty!\\n\\nThe best part was the waitress.  She had obviously not ever served sake bombs, but was a trooper and learned on the spot!  She banged the hell out of the table to get the shots to drop to the applause of all at the table.  Kudos to her!!\\n\\nThey also do a bang up job with the sushi.  Nice portions, tightly rolled/prepared.  They are currently running an all you can eat maki special for $20.  Run!\\n\\nI would recommend going for lunch teppanyaki, as it seems to be a good value.  As best as i can tell, the only difference is that with the dinner portion, you get lo mein and maybe a few extra shrimp.  But the lunch portion is plenty filling already and is several dollars less."},{"name":"Aria","address":"490 E Paces Ferry Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite places to dine in Atlanta. I don' t know what to say or the perfect word use to describe it. It's simply a gorgeous masterpiece they've created here. The inside of the restaurant reminds you of white dome castle. The tables and decor is simple and clean. Elegance, that is. The food is different than most common American restaurants.\\nThere is also a mini lounge when you first step inside the restaurant, and it is quite intimate and the design is basically in velvet from what I remember. \\nPerfect for an intimate dinner and warmth. it's beautiful, the food is great, and the service is outstanding."},{"name":"Hei La Moon","address":"88 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We had dinner at this place and it was supposed to be a great celebration. But the service was so slow it took 3 hours to complete. We placed the order at 6pm and there was no food until 7pm. And between each course we had to wait 10 minutes. Also there were two wrong dishes. Terrible service.

Both the burgers and the sushi are above average. And where else can you get a cheeseburgerooshi? A roll with ground cheeseburger in the middle, potatoes instead of rice, and soy paper instead of seaweed, deep fried!\\n\\nThe specialty rolls are good for a meal, the traditional rolls not quite enough food. \\n\\nIt can be loud inside. They have a huge amount of seating. \\n\\nI would definitely go back."},{"name":"Papa Razzi Concord","address":"768 Elm St","city":"Concord","stars":"3.5","text":"This is for the one in Concord, MA. The food was awesome and the atmosphere was very enjoyable but I'll tell you organizing this event was a nightmare and they still weren't prepared when we got there. I started requesting space 2 weeks before the event; it started with a table for 10 then more people wanted to come and it grew to needing a section reserved for 30 people. I went to the restaurant twice to make sure things made sense for the space they were reserving but there is no designated event coordinator. I worked with a few different people and each time I called it was like the first time they've ever heard of me. One of them made the gesture that I should send him an email with some appetizers I'd like to have ready when guests started to arrive so I did...more on this later. Two tables in the lounge area were supposed to be ready for us at 7pm and then we were going to take over the bar area and the high-top tables. Got there at 7 and sure enough both tables were full with a family having 4 kids. What a mess the section was. They ensured me the family was wrapping up ...an hour later they were still eating dessert. Meanwhile my guests are starving and I'm like \\"Where are the apps I preordered??\\"  The waiter had no idea what I was talking about so I told them about the email then one of the waiters had to go and search for the email and came back with the list written on a napkin. He then asked me if we wanted \\"Family Style\\" and I had no idea what that meant other than I thought it meant everything would come out at once for everyone to dig in..no, it means they make each order 3 times the size of the usual app and charge you 3 times the price. My guests were starving so they ate all the food but I was NOT prepared for the $200 tab I had to pay at the end of the night. So finally at about 8:30 the tables are cleared and my guests could start sitting to order meals, the waiters were spread so thin with other customers (even though I was told I would be assigned a waiter specifically) they kept forgetting things like silverware and napkins and drinks...at one point I asked one waiter for a couple things and said \\"ok you take care of that and I'll grab the other waiter for a couple other things.\\" to which he replied with a sassy attitude \\"I'm really smart and can handle all of it if you tell me.\\" Well he couldn't and eventually got around to getting everything but it took forever. So like I said, the food was great and the atmosphere was fun but I won't ever hold an event there again."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Brunch here is amazing!

Next time."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"If you are one of those all-too-common newbies to Austin  who gushes over the mediocre offerings at the Salt Lick (easily the most overrated barbecue in the history of western civilization) or Rudy's, then please feel free to disregard this review because I am about to say something controversial but absolutely accurate: \\n\\nThe best barbecue in the greater Austin area is smoked in the parking lot of Owl Tree Coffee Roasters on the I-35 frontage road just north of UT and south of Fiesta and sold out of a little trailer called Franklin Barbecue. \\n\\nHonestly, this brisket is the best brisket I've tasted in a loooong time-- moist, tender, flavorful meat sporting a beautiful smoke ring and that crunchy bark that's the hallmark of a meat master who knows what he's doing. And the ribs...oh my. Same tenderness, same smoke ring, fantastic seasoning. So gosh darn good. I haven't tasted barbecue of this quality since John Mueller closed shop a few years back. \\n\\nI've eaten here three times and everything I've had was top notch. The prices are very reasonable, too--for example, I had a fat chopped beef sandwich for $4.95. The meats by the pound are $11 per, which is very competitive for 'cue of that quality. They also offer sides of spicy pinto beans, chunky potato salad, and that delicious vinegar-based cole slaw that I can't get enough of. Also, the espresso-based sauce is very much worth trying. \\n\\n**Word of advice: this is a cue joint, not a full service restaurant where the chef can just whip something up from ingredients found in the walk-in. Word is gonna get out about this place to the 'cue hounds around town. Don't get upset if they are out of something on a particular day. A pit master can only cook so much overnight on a smoker. Once it's gone, it's gone. Get there early enough and you're probably safe, but if you get there anytime in the late afternoon, you're at the mercy of the lunch time crowd. \\n\\nThey're only open 11-4 Wed through Sunday, so make sure you plan accordingly."},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Any place that you can get two entrees for under $20 is perfectly fine by me.\\n\\nBorder Cafe is more than fine, however. The fresh tortilla chips and homemade salsa that comes with every meal are addictive (I'm pretty sure I saw them sprinkling crack on the chips).\\n\\nI've tried a couple of the things on the menu, but I always come back to the Chicken Burro. Chicken and cheese, stuffed in a tortilla and smothered in...MORE CHEESE. \\n\\nYou really can't go wrong. Unless you get the frozen sangria. Minus one star for that yucky drink.\\n\\nThe wait can be brutal, especially on a Friday or Saturday night (plus it always smells so good in there - but I always leave smelling like I rolled around in a tub of smokey ground beef). Totally worth it."},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"It pains me that I'm knocking Dirty Frank's down a notch.  Unfortunately, the last few times that I've been here, I just haven't been overly impressed.  Compare that to last year, when I just couldn't get enough hot-doggy goodness with creative toppings that just made my afternoon seen so much better.\\n\\nMy biggest complaint of late is that the hot-dog buns have been soggy.  Not just a bit from the toppings, but doughy, gross soggy that hasn't really been appetizing.  The toppings are still good (last try?  The Nicola with tatziki, yum).  I still manage to make my way through the whole hotdog, but it does take a bit longer to tear off the unappetizing bits and I end up with a pile of mushy dough on my plate.  And for some reason, the mac and cheese doesn't seem as cheesy..."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Super portion for your money..bit of a wait..but I'd say its worth the wait..Had your basic macaroni,restarant style..there fish special of the day..it was def.

The food is sitting in a display case when you walk in and it tastes like it. I got a pulled pork sandwich that was fatty & not really \\"pulled\\". I also got mac & cheese which was luke warm and their corn bread which was very dry & cold. My bf got the ribs which were very dry. I agree with the other review, the service was awkward. At least 3 people came & asked us how our food was & I wanted to say 'not good' but didn't. The only good thing about this place is the BBQ sauce. Don't waste your time & money. City Barbecue is way better!"},{"name":"Casa De Las Empanadas","address":"1709 W Oak Ridge Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Yum! Latin American food! This place has a pretty diverse menu. We had a couple empanadas and steak mofongo. The mofongo was on par with what I've had in Puerto Rico. We came near closing, so the empanadas did not taste super fresh, but were still good.

Two of my friends were coming from out of state so I thought this would be the perfect restaurant to take them to to get a good look at the city. Everything seemed to work out perfectly. I made the reservation for 8:45 due to earlier times being booked up but they told me we could come early and they would fit us in. We showed up at 7:30 and originally wanted patio seating but at that time they said they had inside seating immediately so we chose that. In my opinion we got the best table in the house. With the restaurant being surrounded by windows you couldn't go wrong but our seat was right in front of the fountains. With all that being said the food was also impressive. Each of us got 4 different things and everyone was highly satisfied. I had the chicken breast. It was very moist and cooked to perfection. The drink menu was exceptional and we had the patio punch which was great! You can't go wrong with this restaurant.
