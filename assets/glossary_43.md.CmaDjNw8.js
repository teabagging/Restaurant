After much conversation about the sounds of letters, singing, dancing, and acting the fool, I decided that my two year old was better able to carry out the small talk category of our time with our company than I was.  My wife arrived home from her job, hungry, confused at finding visitors, and frazzled.  After explaining to her the odyssey that was my day, she slipped into her most helpful of suits and began to enact a plan to rescue me from the dungeon that had become our home in the hours since she had last seen it.  The subject of Food is always the easiest way to bridge the gap of family etiquette and social situations with strangers; in our case family/strangers were hungry, so we had our fix. \\nAfter short deliberation, my wife and I decided that Pine State Biscuits would be the most well received, providing quality deliciousness that we could present to said out of town relatives with the highest probability of naps needed after our meal.  After the trek across the river and through the woods we found ourselves faced with a closed sign almost grinning at us through the glass window on the front door.  Never deterred, my wife exclaims\\" have them follow us to 'Screen Door'\\" \\nWe arrive sometime after 2pm finding a waiting area spilling into the street, huddled under umbrellas sipping the complementary Stumptown coffee.  We were in for the long haul and had signed our name to the list. Our group divided and sent the ladies and kiddo into the slightly crowded waiting area out of the rain, while we waited out under the easy Oregon \\"sunshine\\" for the waiting area to clear.  The patrons streamed out steadily, much like the rain falling on our heads, gaining us a  fast progression from in the rain, to the waiting area, and then  to our table in mere minutes. \\nWe were instantly greeted by our wait person, filling our water glasses and offering coffee and drinks. The room was bustling with the sounds of a happy well fed diners, and the table was clean and orderly with the scents of your grandmothers kitchen if she were southern or fancied herself southern, walls were lined with jarred foods of all kinds, the table held multiple bottles of hot sauce, jams, jellies, sugar cubes, softened butter pats, and the ever so pass√© salt and pepper shakers.\\nWe pored over the special sheet, and menu, from the construct your own breakfast, southern specialties, NW flavored, to VEG & VEGAN Friendly, the menus were approachable from both the wallet and the diners palate. There was something for everyone, old school biscuits and gravy, scrambles, benedicts, and even a hand dipped Breakfast Corndog w/ black pepper cane syrup $3.25 each AMAZING.\\nThe table ordered, 1-The Classic Big Breakfast 2 Eggs OE, Sausage Links, Potatoes, White Toast. 1 Bananas Foster French Toast.  1-Plain Biscuit 2-Chicken And Waffles. In no time we were faced with huge plates of heavenly smelling food. The Bananas Foster French Toast was rich and decadent heaped with flamb√© of banana in a pitch perfect Suzette sauce. The Two Eggs were cooked to perfection, with special consideration for the over sized, properly spiced breakfast links. The biscuit too was picture perfect for a 'bama biscuit, larger than life and dwarfing its small plate, like a giant in midget wrestling. Then there was the \\"Chicken and Waffles\\" unfortunately we got subbed out for regular waffles instead of the sweet potato ones listed on the menu, but I am not complaining. The Waffle served to us was light and fluffy crispy, crunchy, with a hint of sweetness, skewered w/ a steak knife was three cutlets of perfect in every way fried chicken breast dusted lightly with powdered sugar and served with a monkey dish of cane syrup, our table quieted down to the low steady sounds of chewing and savoring all that we ordered. Under normal circumstances this would be the end of the story, good service, good if not great food, relaxed atmosphere, naps required afterward, and a not so hard on the wallet price tag, but I was maybe prompted to write this from a secondary experience, some four hours after our meal, my wife stood in the arch way of our kitchen as I played piano, fresh from her visit from the icebox, cold fried chicken in hand, she was enjoying it in such a way a proper husband should never speak of it or heaven forbid write about. I was lured away from my piano as if led by Eve herself into the loving arms of Screen Door's fried chicken COLD. The crusty shell of highly seasoned yet not greasy crispy goodness is a lovingly parallel to the moistest and flavorful cutlet of chicken breast, you can't help but eat the thing out of hand as you strut through your house grinning like its Saturday morning, you're a kid, no school, and \\"Thundercats\\" was coming on."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"best bbq in the entire world. try everything, especially the beef ribs if you can. mark my words."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I finally made it in for dinner and I have to say I wasn't even remotely disappointed.

I did love musicians and comedians, so my boyfriend thought going to see Mike on Thursday night at The Pig was something I definitely needed to experience.\\n\\nIt was easy to get to for us, since we lived in the South End at the time and were able to take the (then free :( ) outbound E-line and walk the rest of the way.  Now we're in Mission Hill so it is even easier to get to.  I do know it is harder to get to for those not in that vicinity, but it is something everyone needs to experience once.\\n\\nThe drinks and food were decent and not terribly expensive, especially considering the type of place it is and comparing it to others in the area.  The atmosphere (and Mike on Thursday nights) is truly the reason this place is amazing.  The only issue I had with it is that, due to the popularity, there was a huge crowd that night, and two drunk idiots ended up slamming me forward into our table several times as I just sat there minding my own business talking with our friends. I was hit so hard the second time I almost got sick, and thankfully I have a level-headed boyfriend who didn't try to hit them but just tried to break it up and get an apology out of them for me. I got a half-hearted apology, and they continued their fight. The bouncer didn't step in until their fight moved toward the bar, just as one of our friends was ordering another drink.  He got kicked out with them just for standing there, and the bartender still had his credit card and license.  They refused to let him back in to get them, so we managed to get it back for him and decided to leave.\\n\\nMy advice is to see Mike at least once, and then go on a night it isn't so crowded.

Just skip it and go to the yam (sweet potato) fries and dip them in the sweet mustard and Caribbean hot sauce brought to your table. Try the jerk chicken roti which is always made fresh in house.

The price of the burger is fair, and I've come accustomed to paying a bit extra for toppings, so that's no biggie. The menu claims they will only prepare burgers at Medium, which is a bit of a cop-out, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it was pinker than I'd expected. The \\"Foster Sauce\\" compliments the burger well, but could definitely use a kick. \\n\\nThe decor is dark, but welcoming, posters of old shows in Portland adorn the walls. Great space to eat a burger on a dank, rainy afternoon. \\n\\nThe three stars is due to three things: The Poutine, the Moscow Mule, and the service. First, How the hell do you mess up Poutine? It's Fries, Gravy, and melted cheese curds. Simple. Delicious. Horribly unhealthy in the best possible way. How on earth does one screw up the prep of this, the composition in the gravy or the presentation, especially when a restaurant is dead? I have no clue, but I've never been more disappointed in the $8 I've ever spent on fries. The gravy had no flavor as was watery, the fries were under-seasoned, and the curds were cold and dry. The \\"pork belly\\" that was advertised on the menu was little more than flaky chunks of parred-off bacon. Seriously guys, if you're going to offer 4 different Poutine's on your menu, get it right. \\n\\nThe Moscow Mule was decent but was made in a glass not a copper mug. Sorry, if you ain't got the real thing, don't call it a Moscow Mule.\\n\\nThe guy who waited on me at the bar was nice enough, but when his co-worker came in, I spent the last 15 minutes of my time reading and making my way through my burger having to fight her off as she came by seemingly each minute to see if I was finished. Just because I'm not currently touching my burger, doesn't mean I'm not still eating it. \\n\\nIn the end, decent burger, not worth the hype, but it's solid.

At Tatsu-Ya you'll be done in 15-20 (assuming you can get in the door).  You'll walk in and place your oder at the counter and then seated wherever they can find space for you.

The fried chicken is supposed to be a speciality but I found it very dry and there was no skin (the BEST part of fried chicken) on our boneless thighs.

And the waffles.. oh my goodness. As I said, they're fluffy, but wow so airy and rich with flavor. I love the sweet potato! 10/10 would recommend! Make sure that your whole party is present otherwise you have to wait for them to order and trust me, the second you get seated is the second you're waving for the waiter to take your order. These chicken and waffles are worth it. \\n\\nNot from the area which is a shame because I want to try other things on the menu but the next time I come here I'm just going to order the same thing.

He didn't check id's but I suspect this is done on a weekend night. You then walk downstairs and into a dimly lit room with a lot of lounge type seating, tables, booths, and a bar. My party sat in a corner booth. The vibe of the place definitely felt like a library/study/speakeasy feel.\\n\\nUnfortunately upon sitting, the waitress did not acknowledge my party for around 30 minutes. It wasn't particularly crowded either on a Tuesday evening so maybe it was confusion between shifts- not sure. No drink order, water, or explanation of the menu for a solid 30 minutes. Once we got her attention, we got water and placed a drink order. She said bread would be brought out shortly, but this took another 30 minutes to come and by that time we knew we needed to place a dinner order. We got the pork belly small plate appetizer to split. Once this was ordered, it was almost like the waitress ran away and didn't take our dinner order. Reservation for 8pm but did not order dinner until 9:15-30pm. We asked for more bread before our food came out since we had waited a while and the waitress said it would be an additional charge, we were a bit surprised but this winded up being comped anyway for the inconvenience. \\n\\nSide note- when the drinks were brought out (2 cans of beers, a glass of wine, and pineapple juice), one glass for the beer was dirty :( \\n\\nWe had two orders of the fruits de mer- squid ink noodles with scallops, mussels, clams, shrimp, crispy soft shell crab and Chinese sausage. This was fantastic. Two other colleagues were very happy with the swordfish belly as well as the chicken with bone marrow fried rice.\\n\\nTo finish off for a birthday, we ordered the banana fritter and had the birthday boy blow out a candle.

The chicken tikka masala was creamy and nicely spiced and the goat curry was delicious. \\n\\nWe were pleasantly surprised with the naan bread basket, which they brought out fresh from the tandoor whilst u helped yourself to the buffet. Bread was light, chewy, and moist. You can see the nice sheen of ghee on top of it. \\n\\nThey serve one of the better gulab jamun. The fried batter was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.

Pretty much it is buffet and I was not expecting to be checked on, just aS long as they come around to fill up the naan bread and water.

It was absolutely packed, and my family and I had to wait around 10-15 minutes outside on a MONDAY afternoon. So if your going be prepared to wait, especially on weekends and evening hours. The restaurant itself was a bit small with a bar and indoor and outdoor seating. Part of it was a repurposed garage and it was well decorated and had a high attention to detail! Definitely designed with passion and fun! The restaurant was noisy but it also had a neat atmosphere and a southern theme that was neat and seemed to pair well to the experience in that area. Our waiter wasn't too friendly but vaguely pleasant and answered out questions. (I honestly expected a bit more southern hospitality) The food took about 20-25 minutes to arrive but it was packed so I thought it would be a bit longer. I ordered baby back ribs, pulled pork, southern style green beans, and chili; it was pretty delicious! Not the best BBQ I've had but I was pleasantly surprised and the spicy sauce mixed with the original BBQ was amazing and I throughly enjoyed the food.

I respect you and your life choices.\\" \\nIt's quiet, peaceful. Suddenly, I sense a disturbance in the force and look up to see a couple punks sneaking/cheating their way to the front door. A moment of shock, followed by a collective \\"AW HELL NO\\", and the spell is broken. It's now every group for themselves and I frantically order my team into formation as our neighbors attempt to scramble out their own cars. We end up third in line, out of breath but pleased.\\n\\nThe ramen, unfortunately, did not compare to the pizzazz of our above reenactment of that one dramatic scene from that one movie. I got the #2, and yes, the meat was succulent and just the right amount of fatty. The egg was ridiculously flavorful, the noodles perfectly cooked and chewy. But the broth. Way. Too. Salty. I'm usually a huge soup fan (my favorite part of hot pot is drinking the broth at the end after it's been enriched by all the food stewing in there), but this was just overwhelming. I couldn't even finish the soup for fear of my kidneys dying. Ok that's an exaggeration, but it got to the point where its saltiness ruined my enjoyment of an otherwise delicious bowl of ramen. \\n\\nPrice is also a little steep--$10 for 2 pieces of meat, half an egg, some rubbery bamboo, and a decidedly lacking amount of noodles is overcharging. I got the fish cakes for an extra $.50 and literally had to fish around (haha) the bowl just to find the two little suckers. Not much bang for your buck.\\n\\nService was friendly and surprisingly fast after ordering. It's more of an eat-and-go kind of place, since the restaurant's so busy and seating is limited. While no one rushed us, I could pretty much feel those waiting in line eyeing our empty bowls and praying that we leave so they could have their turn. As it were, I wouldn't come here if you're planning on catching up with friends. \\n\\nI'm sure if I didn't prep myself by poring over Ramen Tatsu-Ya's website, facebook, twitter, and every freaking 5-star Yelp review the days prior to going, my expectations wouldn't have been set as unreasonably high and I could have given this a solid 4. Then again, I also didn't have to wait an hour for my ramen--which probably would have lowered this to a 2-star review--so I guess it all evens out in the end."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Lives up to all the buzz... don't be a weenie, get the pound, don't mess with the sammich.

Fresh fruit and assorted jell-o for dessert are also a fun way to end the meal. \\n\\nI have two critques of this place. The first is their inconsistent customer service. Sometimes you have friendly, attentive servers, and sometimes you get people who look miserable, and want to run from their job. One time, our table's water glasses were neglected our whole meal because there was a party present. I understand that they're busy, but you cant ignore your customers like that.\\n\\nSecond, sometimes you dont get everything you ordered. I've had times where you order a certain number of items, and they only bring you half, or forget to bring you what you ordered all together. But, it's understandable. Maybe play it safe, and keep an eye out for items they forget to bring you, and re-order them or mention it to your server. \\n\\nGive Ninkazu a try for yourself.

No free chips and salsa either, which is poor form. Instead you get a shot of beef broth, which is a nice gesture, but it's not enough to stick in your eye (as my grandpa would say).  It wants to be a nicer restaurant it seems, but at the same time it's supposed to be Mexican street food.

He doesn't hurry you through, chats you up a little and he's loaded with the personality that a chef who forms a bond with his customers. He's a real guy. You're in a relationship here, that goes beyond the food. \\n\\nThat said, the food does not rate in the pantheon of Texas Barbecue Greats. It just doesn't. There is little flavor to anything on the menu but the brisket, the ribs and pulled pork were so woefully over moist that they might well have been oatmeal, and the sides (if you care about sides, I tried the potato salad and the coleslaw) are virtual flavor free zones. \\n\\nHere's what I think is at the root of Austin's mass hysteria over Franklin: Austin is so desperate to have a barbecue joint that can run with the likes of Smitty's and the City Market and Snow's, that there's a lemming like stampede to be early adopters of anything that \\"might\\" make it.\\n\\nFor my money, at least on the day I was there, Franklin may have tried to run with the big dogs, but finished as an also ran. \\n\\nOn a positive note, the sauces are each well crafted, deeply nuanced and satisfyingly flavorful.\\n\\nNow barbecue is an \\"any given Sunday\\" kind of thing. Even the best of pitmasters miss the mark from time to time Unerring consistency is a noble goal, rarely if ever achieved. So, I will try Franklin again, and again after that to see if what I tasted (or didn't taste) was just an off day. \\n\\nIn the meantime, however, my advice: Get the bread, put sauce on it, and enjoy.

The bartender threw the ingredients in a shaker, shook it (sorry James Bond, but that's a no-no), and ended up with something that tasted like pure olive brine. When we ordered drinks at the table, the server warned me that a mezcal drink would be smoky, which is sounds like something you'd say to someone who's never had a cocktail before. Judging by the number of dudes at the bar drinking Pabst, that might be what they're used to having to deal with. \\n\\nAdmittedly these are pretty nitpicky things that not everyone would care about, but if you know a lot about cocktails and make them yourself, it's annoying to go wait in line somewhere and pay $14 a drink at a place where the drinks are clearly an afterthought for a lot of the clientele, and perhaps even some of the bartenders.

When we got seated we were told that there's a chance there might not be any chicken left and that it would be sold out. Luckily, we were able to secure the last few pieces of chicken. Each order came with two of the Fox Bros. classic sides. We got 3 quarter dark chicken plates and one quarter white chicken plate. Each plate came with two Fox Bros. sides so we opted for various delicious options like jalapeno cheese cornbread, mac and cheese, Frito pies, and side salad. Everything was delicious! The Hattie's B's chicken was moist, juicy and perfectly spiced! We had medium level heat, a couple of hot level one, and even one \\"shut the cluck up\\"! Loved every bite! Fox Bros. sides did not disappoint, as always. We are glad to have been part of this one-time pop-up event.

It feels like family.  The same waitpersons and greeters are there every time I go and the menu stays pretty much the same.  It feels like reviewing my own mom's cooking, but of course it is way better!\\n\\nYes, it is noisy with kids but that is part of the charm.  How many restaurants can serve you a killer Cadillac Margarita and provide ambiance that includes several 3 to 7-year-olds watching you drink it, squirming and staring over the backs of their seats?  You just wave and tip your glass to them and remind yourself of how pleased you are that you can enjoy other peoples' kids at a safe distance!  The place is totally casual and proud of it.  No pretense here.  Just good food and service in a pleasant, clean and efficient environment.\\n\\nThe guacamole tastes fresh and I enjoy some with the freshly fried chips that come to the table upon arrival.  The two salsas are good, as well.  The warm pink one is mild, somewhat creamy and sweet and the other one is a medium-hot, cooked rather than fresh salsa.  \\n\\nA modest sized meal would be one item and rice and beans.  They offer a choice of beans:  black, which are whole cooked beans that are very lightly seasoned; and pinto which are refried and well seasoned with smoked ham. \\n\\nAfter a long addiciton to the celebrated Lime Chicken Enchiladas, I switched to the Tamales in Mole Sauce.  To avoid wasting any of that delicious sauce on the tamale wrapper, I ask the chef to remove the wrapper before saucing it.  The mole sauce is generally full of the complex flavors in its ingredients:  chile, nut, raisin, tomato chocolate, etc. but has at times tasted flat and one-dimensional.  Sometimes there has been way too little sauce used.  I have experienced that problem with the Lime Chicken Enchiladas, as well.  So I would recommend checking the plates when the waitperson brings them.  Make sure that there is a nice pool of tasty sauce on the sauced dishes to deliver the moistness and flavor you would expect.  And if it is not there, ask if you could have a bit more.\\n\\nA very pleasant surprise is the small classic flan for dessert.   I usually squeeze a little lime on top for some citrus tartness to compliment the rich caramel-custard flavors.\\n\\nOne nice touch that I should mention is that they contribute a portion of their profits to a local charity each year and they poll their customers as to which charities to support.

My daughter and I are in town and we love, love, love the Sugar Factory in Las Vegas.  We showed up at 11:30 for a Saturday brunch.  Three minutes after we were sat our server came over. We ordered coffee and decaf coffee and water.  Three minutes later (6 minutes) and we have water and are told they don't have decaf.  Ok... Get the regular coffee, no cream no sugar.  I ask the bartender if he has Splenda, No... Not no let me get you some, straight up no.  We order an appetizer of meatballs ($11) and two steak and eggs ($18 each).  30 minutes later we still don't have our appetizer.  I ask the server she says should be soon.  I ask for more coffee and the server brings me a to go cup of coffee to pour into my mug.  This is brunch, they have a breakfast menu on weekends... Coffee goes with breakfast.  The manager brings the meatball and I ask if our meal will take as long as the meatballs.  He says \\"shouldn't\\", wow!  No, let me check, no I'm sorry this took so long... Nothing.  15 minutes later (now 51 minutes total) we get our steak and eggs.  My eggs are room temperature and my steak is warm, my asparagus cool... My daughter is so hungry she doesn't care but I'm NOT spending that kind of money for cold food.  I tell the server I don't want it.  She offers to get something else or a new one.  I decline, I don't want to be there any longer than I need to be.  No manager to apologize, no sense of urgency no sense of anything.  The most upsetting piece to me is the small mom and pop restaurant that gives service like this closes and can't survive but a place like the sugar factory keeps promoting itself as a viable dining option.  If you're in Orlando find another place.  The food, the service and the overall attitude of this restaurant is an embarrassment to the foundation of the service industry that built Orlando.

Went here with a group of four and they were really excited about the burger sushi fusion. I ordered a classic roll and was underwhelmed with the taste and appearance. The sushi didn't look or taste fresh. My friend ordered the peanut butter and fried banana burger, which sounds awesome, but the amount of sauce and two tiny bite sized pieces of banana that came on the burger was laughable. My other two friends ordered the bento box, which was okay, but again the sushi wasn't fresh and nothing about anything we ordered was remarkable. The service was slow at the start which wasn't an issue because we weren't in a hurry, but when we did finally get our drinks, my glass was cracked all the way through the bottom and sides, which I pointed out. Again, not the issue, these things happen, but it was the fact that he didn't take it with him when he left the table and didn't return with a new one for at least ten minutes.

We picked out a pretty green glass one (it was on sale and cheaper than the original one we had talked about) and she arranged the flowers while I picked up a couple other things.\\n\\nWhen I got back to the floral counter, the arrangement was all packed up into a box that held it securely (no tipping over). Ashley had even wrapped the vase in pretty green tissue. And she only charged me the listed price of the vase and the flowers. They were $6.99 (down from $12.99) and $7.99, respectively. She also included a little packet of tulip/lily preservative to add to the water the next time it is changed.\\n\\nShe rang up all my purchases and chatted pleasantly.

My boyfriend ordered the hurricane and was disappointed that it was not a traditional New Orleans style hurricane.\\n\\nThe only thing keeping this restaurant from five stars in my opinion are its lack of more traditional Creole and Cajun inspired dishes.

A mellow butternut squash pur√©e envelops the dough instead of tomato sauce, and the globs of goat cheese and toasted walnuts on top gave it just enough contrasting heartiness. It was partly sweet, partly wholesome, and 100% unique.\\n\\nMy friend and I also each got a cucumber lemonade - the best cocktail of my life. It's hard to describe, but it's subtle and thoroughly refreshing. Definitely recommend! We also shared the chocolate bread pudding - I don't think I need to add much here, I'll just cosign all the other raving reviews :) I have to dock a star, though, for my friend's utterly indefensible spaghetti carbonara. It was a lumpy mess of swollen pasta and spinach...

For the uninitiated, that means I eat vegetables, fruits, grains, legumes, dairy, and fish, but not chicken, beef, or pork, which this restaurant has plenty of. \\n\\nScrolling through the menu whilst standing on line in direct boiling sun on the west side of the strip mall where this eatery resides, I found very little I could eat, and became slightly grumpy in the process. There is pork in most items except salad and a couple of appetizers. Unless if's Sunday evening, when they serve vegetarian ramen. \\n\\nI'm a fairly good sport, so I selected a couple of small items from the appetizer menu and sat with the family as they consumed their authentic ramen bowls, complete with pickled eggs and pork belly medallions. I think if you eat pork and like Japanese food, you might like this restaurant. A lot of people do, so many that there is ALWAYS a long que outside.\\n\\nThe inside is small but pleasant, and seating is mostly at long communal tables. They don't serve food to go, but I did get the impression that we weren't allowed to take our time dining, either. Employees circulate constantly, asking if you're finished with this or that plate or bowl. And then there's the long que of overheated people clearly visible outside through the window.\\n\\nI'd try it again, but I'd make sure it's Sunday evening and not during summer. It's one of Austin's latest fad restaurants, but I don't think I'll become a regular.

Simply the most amazing, most delicious waffle in existence. It was cooked perfectly with a crispy outside and a warm soft inside.

Getting a piece of bacon and waffle into your mouth at the same time was dynamite. The Bacon Waffle was the best thing I ate for sure.\\n\\nPRALINE BACON: 5/5. When bacon is caramelized with brown sugar and roasted pecans, you can't go wrong, and there was nothing wrong with this delicious treat. Sweet and smokey with the crunch of the pecans made for one epic slice of bacon. It's highly addicting so be prepared to want more after finishing off a single plate.\\n\\nFRUIT: 5/5. The fruit bowl was fantastic. It had a nice variety and was decently sized. Came with cantaloupe, watermelon, grapes, blueberries, and raspberries. Easy to share with others at your table. I really appreciate our waiter giving us the fruit bowl because we had to wait a few more minutes for the bacon waffle to come out.\\n\\nMAC N CHEESE: 4/5. With the melted cheese on top, this was some cheesy mac! I loved the cheesy-ness of this side. Below that thick cheese layer, it was hot, creamy, and had a very nostalgic, home-style feeling to it. This would definitely pair well with pulled pork or beef brisket. But at the end of the day, it was just mac n cheese without any sort of unique flavor or subtle twist to make it stand out or be elevated like their twist with the bacon waffle. It tasted great, but it wasn't memorable to me.\\n\\nLOUISIANA RED HOT LINK SAUSAGE BREAKFAST PO-BOY: 3.5/5. This was definitely a hot sausage link so be prepared for that. It wasn't so hot that it couldn't be eaten, but you really have to be a lover of hot and spicy sauces or links to fully enjoy this one. What made this sandwich stand out to me in a not so good way was since the sausage link was so hot, I wasn't able to ever fully taste the egg or cheese in my po-boy. The hot link overwhelmed my mouth with every bite. It tasted good, but I really wanted to have that egg and cheese taste in my mouth and I was never able to get it. After eating a little more than half, I scooped some mac into the sandwich and that was actually really delicious because the creamy mac was able to combat the hot link. I would recommend doing that for a tasty twist, opening the sandwich and putting a lot of mac in it, then squishing it down and eating it :) It came on a BIG french roll which tasted a little mundane/plain. Overall I still enjoyed the breakfast po-boy but I would of liked it more if there was a simple sausage link inside rather than the red hot link.\\n\\nGRITS: 2.5/5. Nothing special with the grits. Sort of like a side of fries when you order a burger somewhere. I ordered the regular version and to me, it had the same consistency and taste as cream of wheat. They weren't bad, they were just a simple, plain side to my po-boy. Nothing fancy or special, just grits.\\n\\nOverall I still give this place 5/5 because of that INCREDIBLE Bacon Waffle. Please do yourself a favor and get it when you eat here. I will definitely be back again to try their lunch or dinner. And of course to have another Bacon Waffle ;)"},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"The hostess forgot to seat us, and did absolutely nothing (including apologize) to compensate for making 7 people wait two hours for a table (I would have left, but the birthday boy really wanted Mexican).

When our server finally got around to coming for our drink orders, she failed to make a coherent wine recommendation and was barely able to stumble through the daily specials.

I was not expecting a lot from the $15 entrees and I was not surprised that the tastes of both were very generic.  The parmesan dish (as expected) made the bruschetta below complete mush.  The sauce on the linguine was spicy and tasty but the seafood was on the rubbery side.  Average all around.\\n\\nI would call it a value but I have had better and much cheaper Italian food all over the country and throughout Europe.

The one time I actually want desert (chance for redemption) I have to ask for a menu.  The tiramisu ($3) came shockingly fast but was maybe the least impressive I have ever had.

I ordered la sopa de tortillas with a tamarind BBQ squid. Along with a mezcal old fashioned.\\nThe mezcal old fashioned was watery, but the taste was very good.

Like seriously, every food-culture-lifestyle-\\"this is AUSTIN\\" blog was jockeying this place like the White House backing up PRISM. And based on the first impression I got, what was there not to like? The restaurant does feature some truly beautiful decor, boasts a strong cocktail menu, and has some of the most convenient parking you'll find for any high-er end restaurant in Austin.\\n\\nBut this facade slowly began to wear away shortly after my date and I arrived for lunch this past Saturday. \\n\\nThe front of house staff seemed friendly and competent enough. The restaurant was largely empty, and they sat my girlfriend and I promptly after our arrival. We were left with lunch menus to peruse while waiting for our server who made his appearance shortly thereafter. And I must say, it is awfully disheartening to have a server who comes across as nervous and not confident in his menu. At any rate, we forged on and eventually put in an order for their beet (salad?) and a couple of their signature cocktails (the Mexican 86 and Tri Berry 75 to be exact), all while getting a taste of their complimentary bread and butter spread, which I found to be appetizing. \\n\\nNow at this point I became a bit confounded. Our server made off with our menus before we even got to put in our orders for our entrees, even before our appetizer made its way to the table. This again, really would not have presented itself as a problem since we acquainted ourselves with the menu reasonably well. The beet plate came out and I must say it was 'whimsical' at best. There are a lot of different things going on with this plate, and I am not totally sure that they fit together. The white chocolate was far and away the best part of the dish. Midway through, we put in our orders for some food we were quite surprised to see on their menu, fish and chips and fried chicken. \\n\\nBut WAIT, our server came back a minute and a half later and said the fish and chips were only available for lunch and we would have to order something else. Now why would anyone give us LUNCH menus, with items we truly wanted, only to tell us we cannot order the aforementioned dish after, well, when we put our orders in? He proceeded to up-sell us on the grilled redfish and we were more than happy to oblige and move past this little debacle.\\n\\nOnce the food came out, there were two distinct culinary experiences at the table. I will say that the fried chicken was quite delicious, likely some of the best you will find around town. But I will say, after a having a few bites, and conferring with my girlfriend, that the redfish was nothing to write home about, and I could have conjured up something a bit better in my own kitchen (and I can barely feed myself).\\n\\nAll in all, this restaurant, Mettle, has a lot to learn, or grow, or mature into something that's truly going to leave it's mark on Austin's thriving food scene. Really, the best recommendation I could leave is get the best waitstaff you can find. This town is full of talent, people who really know how to give the best service and leave patrons pining for more. While I wouldn't go as far to say this is the worst service in town, I would say that the restaurant leaves a lot to be desired, especially when one orders $25-30 plates."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"If you are going for breakfast and don't get there at least 30 minutes before they open you will be waiting!

It saddened me that Boston never had a place that could compare to those shrines of meat and grease in the South, where the smell of gently cooking meat and smoky sauce drew me like a moth to a flame.\\n\\nUntil now. \\n\\nSoulfire has filled that little hole in my heart from years of not having good BBQ, and it did it not in little dabs and bits, but with the gargantuan beating-bat that they call the \\"Pitboss Sampler,\\" which seems to have enough food to feed the average human for nearly a week-a heaping pile of spareribs, babybacks, brisket, fried wings, bbq wings, smoked sausage, pulled pork, and every side on the menu, including the absolutely unreal cornbread, the tangy and authentic collard greens, and the perfectly cooked baked beans. Tina (my friend) and I consumed until we were fit to burst, but we were still nowhere close to even finishing the food. The resulting leftovers fed me for three days. Keep in mind, I am a 220lb guy who regularly took challenges at Eagles. \\n\\nPros:\\n-Extremely friendly and timely service. Our waitress was kind, attentive, and actively suggested the best sauces to go with each meat.\\n-The sauces. The Sweet was a bit too much with the honey, but the Soulfire and the Pitboss were the best sauces I've ever had, and the Fiery sauce had a kick to match its name.\\n-Spareribs. Fuck babybacks, if I ever eat pork ribs again, this would be it. Tender, meaty, and cooked perfectly, they taste sooooo much better than some tiny little rack of babybacks.\\n-Southern Fried Wings. If Soulfire ever went into the fried chicken business on a large scale, KFC and Popeyes can kiss their asses goodbye. Massive, juicy, and flavorful as hell.\\n-The sides. Usually, good BBQ has maybe one or two good sides that go with the meat. At Soulfire, EVERYTHING is good. \\n-The chili. Some places just use ground beef in chili. At Soulfire, you know what they use? They cut off the end pieces of babyback ribs and briskets and use those. It's unreal chili.\\n\\nCons:\\n-No parking. If you're from out of town-good luck. Allston is not known for being kind on areas to be.\\n-Boneless meats are ok, but sometimes too dry and overcooked.\\n-Babybacks are ok at times, too dry other times.\\n-Lunch specials would be nice to have around.\\n\\nOverall, Soulfire feeds your BBQ-hungry soul with a perfect array of food.

Upon being greeted by our server, who was extremely nice, I could immediately tell she was very new by her lack of menu and liquor knowledge. Every question regarding wine and scotch selection received a mere \\"I don't know, I'll have to check\\" which made our drink ordering process about 20 minutes. Our server skipped my moms drink order the first time, which I dismissed as an accident being that we were a larger party of 8. By the second trip, she finally got my mothers drink order. About 15 minutes later we finally received waters and our drinks. We ordered the crab Rangoon dip, which was creamy, hot & delicious enough to somewhat distract my family from the fact that we had been waiting almost an hour for our entrees and had not had our drinks refilled once.

In any case, we had a knowledgeable waiter for our party of 5. He recomended the items I have noticed other yelpers mention. Two had the stuffed salmon one had the crab and artichoke thing my wife had the tortellini with lump crab and I had the pan-seared oysters. I found everything very good, very fresh. I never order salmon as it is one fish that I find too fishy 99% of the time so I was surprised the stuffed salmon was AWESOME! My oysters where super fresh but (I shouldn't complain) almost shockingly so and the Ocean taste made my meal the one I enjoyed the least. The crab with artichoke thing I probably wouldn't order but it was exactly as explained and very good but not exactly my taste. Tortellini was great, lots of very large fresh chuncks of crab. Also, the place was rocking busy and my mojitos where perfect. It always gives me a good impression when a place has a very busy bar and food crowd, and they don't skimp in any area.

It becomes even more complicated when said barbecue is to be had at Franklin's, where the crowds really do line up for hours and running out of their offerings is a very real danger.\\n\\nAs mentioned, I do not eat beef, so brisket and beef sausages are out of the question. I heard that the ribs, turkey, and pulled pork are good, though, so I was willing to wait. While we were in line, we were told that we may not be able to have some ribs. That is alright, there are still the turkey and pulled pork to look forward to. An hour and a half passes, out of turkey and pulled pork. We are almost inside their little shack and no mention of ribs being out. Dare I be hopeful? No, not yet, thought I, wait until you are inside and take a peek of the counter.\\n\\nAfter three hours of waiting, we finally got inside and yes, there were still ribs! I allowed myself to hope a little and decided that pie is what I could potentially console myself with. Two parties ahead of us and I still see ribs. Oh my goodness, oh my goodness! I may just be able to try some Franklin's Barbecue...! Heart palpitating, hands sweaty, I held my breath and was already daydreaming about nibbling on those ribs.\\n\\nUntil....\\n\\nThe last of the ribs were sold to the party right in front of us. Right. In. Front. Of. Us. My daydreams became nightmares. The smoky taste I could practically taste in my mouth turned bitter.

Franklin's Barbecue became a place of heartbreak for me. \\n\\nMy friends enjoyed the brisket, although they sweetly withheld the happy sounds in deference to my heartbreak. It did look amazing with the beautiful smoke rings and made me wish in my heart of hearts that I ate beef. I did get to taste the potato salad, which tasted strongly of mustard and I imagine would go so well with the smoky taste of barbecue. The pecan pie was also delicious. The espresso sauce was fantastic!\\n\\nEven though I didn't get to try their ribs, I appreciated the customer service. Everyone was so pleasant and sweet.

I want to see for myself why they are considered the best by so many reputable critics. Until then, I recommend the pecan pie and the espresso sauce, which I fully realize are odd recommendations for a barbecue joint.

This is really two reviews in one.  \\n\\nI'll start with the five star review, which is solely for the nightlife.  I love coming to Tia's for a few drinks (more accurately, a few too many drinks) on a hot summer night - nothing beats it.  Sure, it's packed, but who cares?  You're drinking outside on the waterfront, and I know very few people who haven't gone across the sidewalk and had an impromptu late-night smooch session with somebody in Christopher Columbus Park to kill time after last call when it's virtually impossible to grab a cab.  Another reason for the added star?  The carousel.  Adults can ride the carousel.    \\n\\nAnd now for the three star, which is generous.  The reason for the 3rd?  Because dining on a heated patio rocks.  Otherwise, I'd give it two.  I ordered the lobster roll and cup of clam chowder meal, and I expected much more - literally and figuratively.  I am very far from the kind of person who wants a portion that could feed Rhode Island, but I don't want to feel ripped off, either.  The clam chowder was phenomenal - one of the best I've had in New England, actually - however, I think they portion it out using the plastic dosage cups that come with a bottle of NyQuil.  The lobster roll was one of the most mediocre lobster rolls I've ever had, and I've had them up and down the New England coast.  Dude, McDonald's sells lobster rolls, and if you can't out-do McDonalds, you desperately need to reassess..  Not only was Tia's lobster roll nondescript, it was SMALL!  It was probably a little longer than my iphone, but not as long as my hand.  Put it this way - if restaurants compared lobster rolls the way men compare genitalia, Tia's would be driving the sportscar.  Not only that, the slightly stale bun wasn't buttered and grilled.  There was a good amount of lobster in it, but it wasn't especially flavorful or tender.  This isn't the Midwest where lobster rolls are hard to come by - when you can go to any one of a hundred places and get a much better lobster roll for half the price, it's insane for Tia's to charge what they do for what they deliver.  I can't speak for anyone else's food - none of it looked bad, but no one was impressed, either.  I was disappointed.  I didn't expect to be disappointed by Tia's, considering how much I love the place as a nighttime destination, but I probably won't eat there again unless someone else is picking up the tab.  However, it is by far the best place to go out in Boston during the summer months, so I'll definitely be seen at Tia's between now and Labor Day."},{"name":"Olive Garden Italian Restaurant","address":"11B Allstate Rd","city":"Dorchester","stars":"2","text":"This place used to be good not anymore.

The interior of this place is pretty slick; very industrial but clean. Service was fine throughout the meal. \\n\\nWe decided to split 3 items: the shrimp & grits ($16, her choice), the fried chicken with biscuits ($15, my choice) and the french toast bread pudding ($8, both wanted it). \\n\\nWhen the GF wanted to get the shrimp and grits, I quickly warned her of how hit or miss this dish has been for us lately. Sometimes it's truly amazing, such as at Walton's and Trace. Sometimes it sucks pretty hard, such as laV and Searsucker. Unfortunately, the shrimp and grits weren't very good here either. For $16, you dont get a whole lot of grits? 4 pieces of shrimp and 4 pieces of sausage along with a soft poached egg accompanied the maybe 4ounces of grits. This dish was desperately lacking in salt. The grits were too watery and came in a pool of oil (see picture).\\n\\nThe fried chicken was so-so. Cooked well. Moist chicken with crunch skin and decent flavor. It was close to being pretty good... but man, did they run out of salt in the kitchen today? Very disappointing. The mini biscuits that come with the fried chicken were useless; painfully dry and dense. \\n\\nThe french toast bread pudding... doesn't that sound like a \\"can't miss\\" dish? Meh. Slightly dry, the bread pudding was in need of ice cream or some kind of moisture component. The star anise-cinnamon syrup was wayyy too overpowering. Which brings me to another recent trend in restaurants that I can't stand; mixing savory with dessert.

They've made some recent changes that have really knocked the Papa Razzi experience down a few notches. I went on a Thursday night at 7:30pm. We had made reservations 2 days prior (husbands birthday dinner), but we still waited 20 minutes for a table to be set. The menu has changed drastically. It is no longer a nice leather bound menu, it is a waxy piece of paper with a much smaller menu... some apps, some pasta, some meat and fish dishes. Not the same menu as the Papa Razzi I used to love. You can no longer order traditional Italian dishes like Chicken Marsala.... I asked for this and it came as a grilled chicken breast with Marsala wine and onions, paired with a shockingly small nest of wheat pasta and 3 broccolini.... not what I asked for. I also was surprised when I asked the waitress for the foccacia bread.. apparently they do not bring it out as they are \\"cutting back\\" according to the waitress. Another designated waiter goes around and gives one slice to each customer, and they do not serve butter...you have to ask for that now too. I asked for the butter to go with my focacia bread and it came out 25 minutes later, along with the oil for the bread. Over all the service was horrible. I am very dissapointed because I used to love Papa Razzi as it was one of the better restaurants in the area. I am just absolutely shocked that they are penny pinching by not serving butter, but having custumers request it.

I don't frequently buy food or drink at the airport because it's rather pricey..  however yesterday I was strapped for time due to a delayed flight and I went to Berkshire Farms to get a yogurt and a small cup of tea... To say that I received absolutely horrible customer service would be an understatement!! The agent that rang up my order did so very quickly with no eye contact and while talking to a colleague of hers... As an employee at the airport we are entitled to a 10% discount, and of course because she wasn't paying attention I did not get my 10% discount... when I very nicely showed her my receipt and said I did not get the discount, she pushed it back at me and told me it's only $.50 and not a big deal... Nope, not a big deal that it's only $.50, but a very big deal that she would be rude about it in that manner!! She went on to say that the manager wasn't around anyways and she wouldn't be able to do the refund and re-charge with the discount because she didn't have the key that the manager held.. so I politely said that I would wait (and it wasn't really about the \\"$.50\\" AT ALL at that point!!!).. then another girl placed a cup of something on the counter but didn't say that it was mine and there was a line of people also waiting for their drinks, so I asked if that was my tea, and she said \\"well it's in front of you!\\"..  VERY RUDE!!! I then sat down nearby to eat my yogurt and wait for the manager and the key... All of which could've been avoided if she was paying attention to begin with! And to boot, I did not get the cinnamon tea I was expecting, so I brought it back and told the girl that it wasn't the cinnamon tea I have gotten in the past, and she very rudely said that she would dump it out and get me another tea from the same box of tea and it would taste exactly the same!!! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! Another employee brought the box over to me and showed me that it was some sort of harvest cinnamon spice tea that was different than the one I've had in the past (all cinnamon) and stated that the tea varieties change often.. That is all fine and good, but it wasn't what I was expecting, if this was the case the girl should have known that they were different varieties of cinnamon tea!!!! And could have pointed it out and asked me if I wanted the other flavor! After I worked my flight I went to speak to the manager who made 1 million excuses for this girl and said she would speak to her, but I'm not sure if that will do any good because according to my colleagues this girl has had this bad attitude towards them as well and they did not have nice things to say about the manager either! I will take my business elsewhere thank you very much!!! I work in customer service, and I appreciate good customer service, and I will take my business to where I receive it!!!\\n(BY THE WAY, it was $.91 and not $.50, so I'll take my $1 discount on my $10 order of yogurt and tea, THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!!!)"},{"name":"Times Irish Pub & Restaurant","address":"112 Broad St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"The food, prices and ambiance are ok, but what really sets this place apart is the large patio.

We were seated after a bit of time even though we had a reservation. After we were seated, we had a very friendly waiter come and take our drink orders.

They were something I had never had. Their fried chicken was so flavorful. It was super crispy on the outside but juicy on the inside. Their green beans and mashed potatoes were also delicious. \\n\\nMy only negative about the restaurant was how long it took to get things. I do understand that we were in a larger party, but with a reservation booked weeks in advance, it was not like we just showed up. It took at least 20 minutes to get our drinks (most of which were just beers). It took about 40 minutes to get our salads and soups (no one ordered appetizers). I do understand also that sometimes it takes time to get the soups and salads all done and out at the same time, but the thing that I was most perplexed by was the fact that they didn't bring us bread until after they brought the salads. Other tables got bread shortly after they sat down.

I will say that I refused to come here for two years because of the ridiculously long lines, but today was different as I drove by on 11th St. I noticed no line and the \\"Sorry, Sold Out\\" sign wasn't on the door. A quick turn into the parking lot and I'm running in the rain to the door. I open it and see a short line. A worker informs me that brisket and sausage is all that's left, and it should take less than 20 minutes. I bowed my head and thanked God for this opportunity. \\n\\nI ordered lean brisket and sausage. I chose the lean because I wanted to see if it was still as tender as it was the first time I ate hear when it was just the teal and white trailer on IH35.  My expectations were low as it is difficult for any restaurant, let alone a BBQ joint, to remain consistent in quality all these years. Wow. I get it now. I understand why people stand in line for hours just to eat here, why Franklins has received accolades across the globe for its BBQ; it is still as phenomenal as it was in their early years.\\n\\nIt's one thing to be able to use the side of a plastic fork to cut a piece of brisket without any problems, but even a better thing to be able to eat brisket and it just melts in ones mouth. No sauce needed to moisten it up; just as perfect as anyone could imagine a piece of brisket should taste. Oh!

No; it's simply like store bought hot sauce & doesn't add to the dish. Anyways, the ramen was cooked perfectly, the soup was creamy & stayed hot throughout my dining but then again it could be because my hotness kept it warm haha, the pork belly was tender, and the egg was closely cooked before boiled so the yolk is still soft. Do as they recommend and just smell the broth as it arrives. Now, I also got the slider, which was okay; the potato salad was the usual and the slider tasted like a chicken fried steak in between buns. Basically the slider felt out of place in this Japanese restaurant, but don't get me wrong, it was not bad at all. The owner, I believe, was really nice and attentive.

He liked the nice combination of flavors- chicken with a nice combination of vegetables, smothered with cheese, topped with cilantro. \\n\\nThe quality of this place is better than any Mexican restaurant we've ever been to---- even in the south (where we're from)--in our humble opinions. \\n\\nI think I mentioned this in my past review, but the service is incredible. Very nice waitresses and hostesses. The owner is super nice. When I asked about the Delicato White Zinfandel, he came out and showed me the bottle.  \\n\\nRight now, the place is too quiet. More people need to come! \\n\\nWe are 100% coming back and I 100000000% recommend the place. And read my previous review too, because it's an important read.

From the outside I always thought I'd find a darkly inviting and cozy little neighborhood spot. It did feel that way when I walked in on a recent cold and snowy day.. But unfortunately the feeling didn't last as I was whisked right past the available tables near the fireplace, only to be seated in a tiny spot near a drafty brick wall on the other side of the room. (The place was crowded, but there were still at least 2 or 3 other good seating options.) You should try to please the customer from the minute they walk through the door, and that starts with where you seat them.\\n\\n\\nService:\\n\\nThe servers were young, and eager to please but missed the mark on many levels. The best example I have of that is when our waitress kept asking us how we were or if we needed anything, but never stayed around for our answers. It was comical. I actually had to shout after her that yes I would in fact like some more coffee.\\n\\nI know this might really be pushing in in the needy-customer department. And tell me if you think this is an outrageous request. But I have always felt that the mark of a great server is when the ask you how your food is after first noticing whether or not your mouth is full.\\n\\nWe asked at least twice for spoons to stir our coffee, and more creamers to put in that coffee. (Side note: Yes, I said creamers. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with that. But again, I just expected more; like actual milk in a pitcher, or half and half. Not a huge deal though). She did finally bring the creamers, but forgot the spoon. I just stirred my coffee with my fork. (Again, not a huge deal, I'm just saying....)\\n\\nThe meal:\\n\\nI don't know, maybe I shouldn't have waited until 2:30 to go there when brunch ends at 3:00. But I don't think that was the problem. They have good menu choices. But the food quality and presentation was comparable to your basic TGIF type places. It's great if you like those kinds of places, but I was expecting more.\\n\\nI ordered huevos rancheros. I thought the portion size was just fine, no complaints there. I also liked how they added plenty of fruit to the plate. Some places will put 1 strawberry on a brunch plate and consider it brunchy. My dish had lots of strawberries, cantaloupe, grapes, and honeydew. That was very nice. Even though the cantaloupe was totally not ripe.  \\n\\nMy home fries were cold. The flour tortillas were stale and hard. Not only were the onions inside the omelet totally undercooked and crunchy, but there were a *million* of them. \\n\\nComing over the 1st time to check on us, the waitress asked me if I wanted some salsa. The dish came with 2 little containers of black beans and sour cream. But the fact that it did not come with salsa, and she asked me if I wanted some almost as an after thought struck me and my fellow diner as odd.\\n\\nBottom line:\\n\\nOur waitress was a real sweetheart, who was not refined or very smooth and did not seem to be working in a place that had any desire to teach her. I do not blame her *at all* and we tipped her 20%. \\n\\nMy sense is that management just does not have extremely high expectations of giving an above average dining experience because they know they can get away with less. They are in a great location, and do not seem to hurt for customers.\\n\\nThe funny part is that I would go there again. One reason is just to give them another chance. It could have been an off day or bad timing. But like I said in the beginning, I kind of doubt it. Secondly, I think this must be a much better place to go at night before or after some other activities, like hearing music or hanging out with friends. I went here as a brunch destination and I had high hopes. I would probably be much happier with a beer and a burger and a bunch of friends.

The burgers also didn't come with lettuce, pickles, or tomato--just a spartan looking bread and beef sandwich.  \\n\\nI ordered cheese fries with my burger, but instead of just charging me a little more for the cheese to be added to the fries, they charged me for an entire order of fries!  \\n\\nThe pizza (which came 15 minutes after all the other food) was the only food that was still warm, was delicious!

The food was excellent, the service was passable, but one thing just rubbed us the wrong way. We wanted to do the family tasting, but there were no Vegetarian Entrees on the menu (and we had one vegetarian dining). We were told the whole table must participate, so therefore could not partake in the Family Meal. So we all made our own meal with Apps, Entrees, Trimmings, etc. My wife was told that they could put a vegetarian plate together for her, which would be a plate of some of the veggie friendly trimming/sides. So we go ahead and order and lo and behold, her Veggie dish was literally just a plate of mushrooms that could have been ordered as a side dish (which we had ordered). So now we have a side of Mushrooms and a Main Course of Mushrooms, which were pretty much the exact same size. The real kicker was when the bill came and we were charged $6 for the side of mushrooms, but $13 for the entree of mushrooms (which was more than the meatloaf, the same price as the fried chicken and more than double the price of the same dish as a side). This left a pretty sour taste in the mouth after what was actually a great meal. Just don't understand why we couldn't do the family tasting and have this Mushroom entree as part of that? In addition, we either wouldn't have order the side of mushroom had we known that the vegetarian entree would have been the same thing.

Prior to walking into the restaurant, I looked to see that they had a sign that indicated they accepted American Express as that was the method of payment that I would use that night.  I ate my meal and was about to pay with my card, when Daniel advised that their machine could not take American Express.  I then told him that we had a problem as that was the method of payment that I had.  He asked for an alternate payment method, and I told him that I didn't have one and that I was traveling on business and this was a corporate expense.  He got his manager who asked me the same thing and again I explained that I would not be providing an additional payment method and that he would need to figure out a way to contact his merchant services for an authorization so that he could enter it manually into his system.  He left and came back with all of my credit card information written down to include the CV number on the back and said that he would hold on to my information until the next day when he could run it.  At that point I was angry because I didn't authorize him to do that and who in this day and age would allow someone to just simply hold on to their credit card information until God knows when?  I began to explain why that was unacceptable while at the same time taking my card information back from the manager.  After more conversation he finally said that the less than $20 dinner would be on the restaurant.  To me this was poor customer service and embarassing as the other customers began to look around and probably wonder if I was trying to stiff them on the bill.  He should've recognized in the first place that it was their fault for not posting something on their door saying their card machine wasn't taking American Express or his server should have said that prior to me ordering my meal, but at no point should they have tried to make their problem my problem.

I know and love Ken's Artisan, and I'm eager to try Apizza Scholls when the opportunity arises, but all I wanted tonight was a good, cheap, simple garden-variety pizza. My roommate had a look online and mentioned Rovente. Neither of us had ever been, and what the hell, it's only few blocks away, let's give it a shot.\\n\\nMy test pizza is pepperoni with onions; I'm also a stickler for crust. If the crust is good -- homemade, yeast-risen, not too thick or bready, tasty on its own -- you know you've got a good pizza. I am damn impressed with Rovente. It's not a froufrou gourmet pizza -- I love those too, and mean no disrespect, but this is just a damn good pizza with no pretension.\\n\\nThe crust is great: chewy, not too dense, able to stand up to a few toppings.  It would be even better with some garlic butter to dip it in. The onions were diced, which I think was a nice touch -- I hate getting huge chunks of onion that never cook completely. The sauce was near-perfect sweet and thick, not too watery, and not too copious, though it might've been a little spicier if one were to nitpick. The pizza was satisfyingly greasy, but not over the top, with a good ratio between cheese, sauce, and toppings. I don't remember exactly how much we paid, but to feed two people plus leftovers the next day, I don't think it was much. And good to know you can stop in and get a couple of slices if you're passing by.\\n\\nThe place looks well-stocked with hipsters manning the ovens, and everyone was cheerful and friendly.

I had brisket half and half and pulled pork, husband had \\"fatty mcfatterson\\" brisket and ribs. I normally hate meat on the bone but this fell off and was delicious. I liked both the fat and the lean brisket, and the pulled pork was great, but in a clear 3rd place behind the brisket and ribs. There were three sauces on each table: I wholly expected to fall in love with the espresso sauce but didn't. None of the meats needed sauce, but if I had to choose one, it would be the thicker, red one.\\n\\nWe live in Houston and Austin was one stop on our holiday weekend getaway. My husband loved this place so much that we came again on Tuesday. This time, we arrived at 9:30, were third in line, and ordered right after Franklin opened.\\n\\nOne thing that really struck me was how nice Aaron Franklin was both times we were in there.

Cooked to a medium rare, they were full of toppings and came with a large pickle spear on the side. We both opted for french fries and they came very under seasoned.

She asked how I wanted it cooked and I advised Medium. Upon receiving it, the burger was cooked well down, and was incredibly dry. The burger also had a very strange off-putting taste. When she came back around and saw I had barely touched my burger she asked if everything was ok. I explained what was wrong and she stated that someone times people don't like the kimchi and it can be different for some people. I explained to her that I was not new to Kimchi and that it tasted nothing like any kimchi I have ever had before. I hate complaining about food, but honestly it was inedible and at the price point of this place, I had to let her know. She took it off our ticket, which I appreciated. \\n\\nmy friend had a burger as well (the hillbilly I believe). Hers was dry and again overcooked despite asking for medium rare. The crab Rangoon dip also had a strange fishy flavor as well. My fianc√© had a spicy tuna roll and a seaweed salad. The sushi roll tasted like grocery store quality unfortunately and seaweed salad was off per him. \\n\\nI really wanted to like this place, considering how hip it looks, but the food quality did it for me sadly. This was surprising as the yelp reviews place it really high, and it's not usually wrong. Maybe it was just an off night. The service was good which is why it gets 2 stars.

Spicy Tuna Sashimi\\n\\nThis is one of my favorite places if I just want to go for decent price alacarte sushi instead of AYCE.  Don't get me wrong this place  isn't comparable to the BEST sushi restaurants in Vancouver.  The quality of the sushi is ok, but waaaay better than anything in Surrey!  So Its probably one of the best korean-owned sushi restaurants. Mainly we come here if I have a craving to my two favorite things to order.\\n The portions are well worth the price.   I always order the spicy tuna sashimi.  To me it's the best spicy tuna sashimi I have ever had.  But I'm still on the prowl for a place just as good or better.  I always get half an order for me and my husband to share and it's still plenty for us.  \\n  Another must have favorite of mine is their AWESOME roll.  It's like a California roll with seared salmon, masago and basically takoyaki toppings- bonito flakes, mayo and a special sauce.  \\n My kids love this place too.  They love the chicken teriyaki that is served on a hot plate over vegetables.  And my older son loves their unagi don.  Sometimes he'll have the unagi nigiri.  And it's the biggest cuts of unagi that I have ever seen especially for the price. \\nActually I like this location more than the coquitlam location.  For some reason I think it tastes better.  But since I live in surrey the coquitlam location is closer and they have takoyaki.\\nThe service isn't the best.  But I don't go their for the service.

There was the \\"Ol' Skool\\" ($9), a Tokyo-style chicken based shoyu ramen, or a vegan option. There was no way I was going the vegan route. And to even drive that decision further down the rabbit hole, I ordered the Chashu bowl (normally $5, it's a $1 off if you combine it with a ramen bowl). To guild the lily a bit, I added the \\"Corn on the Bomb\\" ($1.50) as well. It's a large nugget of seasoned corn and butter which you toss into your hot ramen.\\n\\nThe ramen broth was a tad bit salty to my liking.

I *love* Powell's but this recommendation scored them no points with me. Maybe it's that I live in Seattle so another McCormick & Schmick's restaurant has a \\"chain\\" feel. The food (fish and chips for me; the sole with crab for my date) was fine. Nothing spectacular; nothing awful. My complaint, I guess, aside from the general blandness of the experience, is that the sole was listed at $18.95 on the menu. The server, when we ordered the dish, told us that the chef had pointed out that that was a mistake and that the actual price was $28.95. I think that it would have made sense for them to change the price on the menu--add an errata sheet if nothing else--rather than leave it mispriced there. So a star less for the inability to correct their mistake on the menu and at least a star less just because the best word to describe the food and atmosphere would be \\"workmanlike.\\""},{"name":"The Squealing Pig","address":"134 Smith St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Great beer list.

However, last Saturday, the place seemed to be full, and we thought that the place might have changed for the better so we entered and ordered a meal.  What a mistake!  We had the worst meal we've had in years.  We ordered seafood soup and asked if it could be prepared without eggs.  After a long wait the soup arrived and the waiter assured us that it had no egg, but it was loaded with egg.  That, though, was just the beginning.  We ordered Peking Duck.  We got a dish with the skin of a sparrow sized duck.  The skin was heavy with fat, and the dish had about 4 times as much shrimp cracker as fatty skin.  The buns were bread like in thickness and consistency, and we initially got duck sauce instead of hoisin.  We also ordered Chinese Eggplant in black bean sauce.  The dish was simply black bean sauce with emulsified eggplant.  It was essentially inedible.  To top it all off, one of us got severely ill, and the rest of us mildly ill.

We know amazing BBQ from regular chain restaurant BBQ.\\n\\nWe got lucky because the day we went was kind of gloomy and drizzly out so the line wasn't too bad. We arrived at about 10, and the back of the line was where the coffee cart is. Some of the people toward the front of the line under the covered area said they arrived at 6:30 but would've been in about the same place if they'd arrived at 7.\\n\\nThe people in line really are cool, and the smell is intoxicating. We got to use their folding chairs once they opened and the lucky front-of-liners went inside. I didn't get bored enough to start reading my book, but I did play on my phone a lot.\\n\\nThe employee who works the line to get estimates for how much and which meat people are ordering and to give estimates for when you'll actually get your food is spot on. She told us almost as soon as we got in line that we'd be eating at 1:30, and she was spot on.\\n\\nThe most brisket is melt-in-your-mouth amazing, but I also was surprised by how much I really liked the pulled pork (very meat-y pork flavor, great with their vinegar-y Carolina sauce) and ribs (falling off the bone juicy and tender). My husband loved the sausage (nice bite to the casing and fresh, pepper-y flavor). You can skip the turkey - it's moister than generic oven baked Thanksgiving turkey but not on the same level as the other meat.\\n\\nWe gave our leftover brisket, pulled pork, and turkey to a native Texan friend who reheated it low and slow in her oven at home. Her exact reaction was, \\"F. This brisket is really good.\\"\\n\\nThe coleslaw was more tangy/acidic than creamy, which does through all the meat grease, but isn't my favorite flavor for coleslaw.

It's got a very tangy citrus flavor that I think not everybody would like.\\n\\nI don't know if I'd do the line again, but we agreed it was worth it to do once.

You could say this was a long time coming. This time around we came on a Sunday afternoon and only had to wait in line for 10 minutes or so. The interior reminds me of restaurants in Japan as far as decor and that the restaurant is pretty small. You order at the counter and then they bring your food to your table. This location is in a shopping center so parking wasn't an issue.\\n\\nI had the Tsukemen and I wasn't a big fan. I had no idea it was dipping ramen when I ordered it so this was my first time trying this type of ramen. Instead of having all your ingredients along with your broth in a bowl, dipping ramen separates your broth and ingredients. The broth is super rich so it's served in a much smaller bowl compared to regular ramen. As the name suggests, you dip your ingredients in the ramen and eat it that way. The dipping ramen came with noodles, nori (seaweed), and I also ordered a corn bomb (basically a ball of corn, butter, and honey). The broth was just too flavorful and strong for my taste so I didn't enjoy it even though it's one of their most popular items on Yelp. I also wasn't a big fan of the corn bomb and it was too buttery and greasy. \\n\\nMy friend had the chicken broth option (can't remember the official name) and I liked his ramen. I also asked for no nori but they gave it to me anyway. Jinya is my favorite ramen in Houston (haven't been to the location in Austin) and I would have to rank Ramen Tatsu-Ya below them.

I had been craving a hamburger but they only served pork burgers and we don't eat pork.

Overall none of their portions are very large, so just know that you will want at least one entree and app per person if you are hungry.  Their naan was pretty incredible, crispy and fresh made, and even though we ordered it towards the end of our meal, it was worth the wait.

The menu reads like a truly empassioned list: interesting flavor combinations that both challenge and excite the palate.  However, the entire experience was kind of a bust...terse, stressed-out waitstaff and food that can only be described as \\"look at the menu, check off the items, pile them on the food\\" mediocre. People were standing outside, not in giddy expectation, debating food choices...no. There's absolutely no room in the dining room, and if you must wait, that's where you go.\\n\\nThere's little point to having such interesting dogs if you can't let the flavor of your frank shine through. I always go with the standard (menu-recommended) treatment when ordering from \\"fancy\\" dog joints; I assume this is the tried-and-true approach.  Granted, at Frank's you *can* get the dogs grilled or ripped...either choice would help that Vienna Beef \\"snap\\" far more than their steaming process.  It's a good dog, it needs flavor on the casing. They go through the trouble of casing them well; steaming makes it lifeless and bland. The poppy seed buns are doughy and lifeless, just like in Chicago. A quick press on the flattop would do wonders.\\n\\nThe toppings are incredibly ambitious.  But...they're just toppings. The carrot-mustard-cabbage slaw screams of creativity, but inevitably falls flat, tasting like bored kimchi. This poses the question: why not just kimchi, then? Add a little Chinese mustard...bang. Extra flavor profile. Either way, the dog is small, lost, and scared. Poor doggy.\\n\\nThe slaw dogs fare MUCH better. The chili is flavorful, full of the beefy goodness that the steamed pups lack. The slaw is the \\"little squares of joy\\" kind that makes me very happy. This is a far heartier option.\\n\\nThe Cincy five-way is hot as hell. Chili, spaghetti, sliced, raw jalapeno (with seeds, oh mama), beans, and a blob of sriracha (didn't think we were getting out of this review without reading THAT word, did ya?) makes for something that is kinda fun, but has naught of Skyline's appeal.\\n\\nI don't really know if I need to go back here again. Nah. Probably not. The fact that they'd do a Tofurky dog with all this stuff on it makes it clear to me it's more about pandering to the demographic, and far less about the food."},{"name":"Tokyo Japanese Steak House","address":"250 Granite St","city":"Braintree","stars":"3","text":"The hibachi here is the best.

I came in for my appt which was a very informal discussion about what a wanted in my new kitchen. She seemed to make minimal notes and just agreed with my ideas and said that everything was doable. She said she would have a quote in a week. She emailed me the quote a week later with only numbers and no details about the cabinets and what features were included with this quote. So I emailed her an asked and she said that would be done after a $200 dollar measurement consultation. So I emailed her asking her to set that up. She didn't email me back and I had to email again and she eventually got back to me and scheduled an appt. by this time 1 month had gone by. At the appt she had a drawing that completely ignored a lot of what I had said in our in person meetings. In the drawing she had moved my dishwasher into the middle of my galley kitchen... I guess I am just supposed to jump over it to take my plates from the table to the sink. She didn't have the pantry on the drawing and had a large cabinet placed where it wouldn't work. I reiterated my wishes and she acted a bit annoyed that I was questioning her design. At the end of the appt she said she would have a more detailed bid in a week. I emailed her 3 weeks later after not hearing anything and just asked if she needed any more information and what the eta on the bid was as I have a timeline for my kitchen remodel. What she emailed back was so rude and unprofessional I was so taken back! She said her husband was sick and that she couldn't meet my deadline. Which is still 3 months away so it really should be plenty of time. Anyways, she went on to say that her \\"time and ideas are a gift given to you\\". Which is so rude and unprofessional considering she just wasted 2 months of my time and she never gave me anything except some numbers on a paper. And she completely ignored my ideas and wishes for my kitchen. She needs to get with the times and order some software for kitchen remodels and not be so unprofessional and waste peoples time.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Today was my first experience with Fox Brothers and I wasn't really as impressed as I was hoping to be. We didn't eat any of the  BBQ plates, but we had the Texas Fries (which were admittedly really great) which had brisket on them, the mac and cheese, and the brisket chili. We also had the slowest service in the world. Now, the first part I'll forgive a little because we were waiting for someone, but we still sat there for 20 minutes before she came back to see if we were hungry yet, and then it took forever to get anything else, including drink refills. \\n\\nThe Texas Fries were a greasy fantastic feast, and the price was actually fair for the amount we got-- we shared a half serving of them between two  of us and it was plenty of food. There was also tons of brisket on it, which was nice because they did a pretty good job with the brisket. \\n\\nThe chili, also with brisket, was mildly unimpressive. When I hear chili, I think of a nice thick... well, chili. This was more like a brisket and cheese soup with chopped red onions on top. All it would have taken to make me happy was some kidney beans or something, but it was a little on the weak side. \\n\\nThe mac and cheese was actually what I was most looking forward to, I'd heard from a lot of people that it's phenomenal. I will admit that I've been totally spoiled by Palate's mac, and while there's nothing wrong with Fox Bros mac, it's just a decent casserole style mac-- just nothing special, really. I see now that other people have felt the same way about the sides, so I guess next time I'll just pick up brisket and hit the road. Maybe then I won't feel like I dropped about $5 more than I should have (since according to their prices, they're pretty proud of their food!)."},{"name":"Quesabrosa","address":"3954 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place is dope!

Its thick, creamy. and very flavorful. The meat is very tender and flavorful. They sadly only give you one slice of meat. The noodles have the right thickness when you bite into them. Plan to order extra noodles or a rice bowl on the side as the ramen portion itself is not that much to eat. The negi rice bowl is a game changer.

It could have stood to be on the grill another minute or two but it was crisp and yummy.\\nMy wife had the baja tacos which were also a dissapointment. The tacos were dryed out flavorless chicken, raw white onions and shreded cheese. \\nMy older daughter had the kids cheese quesadilla, she ate it without complaint.\\nMy 2 yr old had chicken fingers which were completely dry and over cooked.\\n\\nI honestly can't see how this place was given 4 stars?

We order two additional entrees and a drink from where we're now seated (which you're encouraged to do, it's not a fast food restaurant).  At this point a line out the door starts forming, and as we were presented our first entree, the server interrupted the meal to inform us that we've violated their rules of soup kitchen conduct.  I was told that they don't allow late additions to a party, and was basically accused of cutting in line.  My only crime was that *I* wasn't present for the initial order at the register.  I would see her point had we moved after the line formed, but it simply wasn't the case.

This was our first time to Screen Door and we knew to expect a line and long wait times inside because they get slammed when they first open.   No problem.  \\n\\nHere's the problem.  When you are sitting at a table 10 feet from the kitchen, you have a good view of the food coming out as well as the tables in the restaurant.  We sat waiting for about 40 minutes for our appetizers (hush puppies) to arrive.  During this time, we saw 6 orders of hush puppies sent out to tables that were seated and ordered after we did.  Realistically, it was probably more than that, but we certainly didn't start tracking this immediately.  Our waiter came by and noticed we had not received the appetizer and said that was strange and he would check on it.  He then reported that he didn't know what had happened but that he had asked them to get them done for us.  More time passes, more hush puppies go out to the other tables.  Finally ours come out.  At this point, we are thinking that we probably won't even be through with the appetizer before our fried chicken comes out.  Ummmm...not a problem.  We finish the hush puppies and sit there for another 50 minutes.  During this time, both our waiter and the hostess come by apologizing for the wait and saying that they are looking into what happened to our order.  This happens repeatedly during this time.  During the entire time, we watch table after table get their food.  Not just get their food, but get fried chicken plates just like we had ordered (8 instances of exactly 2 orders of fried chicken like we had ordered going out to tables that came after us -- in some instances tables that had new people at them from the ones that were seated at the same time as us).  When the food comes out, we had been there 1 hour and 45 minutes and been told no less than 6 times by various people that they didn't know what had happened.  While the chicken was delicious and plentiful, my wife's second piece was not cooked thoroughly and mine was a bit pink as well.  When the hostess came by asking how the food was, we pointed this out and she said she thought it could be cooked more, but said that \\"it depends on what you are comfortable with\\".  She then offered to make my wife a new one \\"on the fly\\".  My wife immediately said \\"good god no\\" as a reflexive reaction when considering how long this might take.  They took the hush puppies and my wife's dinner off the bill (she only ate the fully done piece anyway), which was a nice thing.  \\n\\nEven though the food was delicious, I can't give more than 1 star.  I understand that things happen, but here are the things I simply can't understand.\\n\\n1.  I have been to restaurants and ordered items that take longer to cook, so it's not a big deal if food is going out to others when I have not yet gotten mine.  But, when you have ordered the same thing, in the same quantity as other tables that have come in after you and they are served first, something is broken.  And this wasn't like we ordered two fried chicken dinners and others ordered this plus other things, it was two plates going to another table.  This also wasn't like someone who same in slightly after us and maybe the order just was entered slightly sooner.  In one instance two diners came in as we were eating our appetizer.  They received both their appetizer and two orders of chicken before we got our chicken.  \\n\\n2.  If both the waiter and the hostess recognize that there is a problem yet it isn't addressed, then the process is broken.  It almost would have been better to not have them acknowledge that they knew it was happening since every meal that went out during this wait was just further evidence that they weren't able or willing to really correct the service problem.\\n\\n3.  It's disappointing when food is undercooked (and no, whether chicken is fully cooked is not a \\"comfort\\" thing...it's cooked or it's not), that really wasn't a big deal.  It happens.  However, how anyone could come to the table and offer to have another made \\"on the fly\\" is absurd.  If the concept of cooking something on the fly really existed there, it seems like we shouldn't have had to endure this experience as noted in the points above.  So, either you can cook meals on the fly when things go wrong, in which case the service provided was just crap, or you don't have the ability to do so and offering it is just hysterical.  \\n\\n\\nThis may have all been an isolated incident that would never happen again if I went there again, but why would I risk that?  If I went there again and happened to have the same thing happen, I would feel like the biggest idiot.

First off, don't come here expecting high-quality, upscale Japanese food.  If you want that, visit NYC or LA.  The food is ok quality for the price point.  But quality isn't the issue, it's portion size.  Especially for the Japanese Chirashi.

Seito's interpretation may have more variety, but only one-two pieces of each.\\n\\nWhile I've come to expect consistent quality across various visits, the thing that irked me the most was the lack of attention by the wait staff.

The place was fairly empty when we arrived, except for the bar area.  It's a bit ambiguous when you enter, as there is no greeting/seating stand, but someone came over fairly quickly.  We asked to be seated in one of the back rooms, which are more of a dining area.  We were promptly watered and menued.  \\n\\nMy wife ordered the parsnip soup and the tagliatelle with braised pork (which she asked to be delivered with my main course), which are both starter items.  I ordered the mussels as a starter and the  steelhead/mussel stew as a main course.  The parsnip soup was excellent (from the taste I was allowed).  The mussels were larger than I like, but I suspect I'm in the minority with that; it's a texture thing with me.  But the broth they were in was outstanding, with orange, cilantro and a bit of hot pepper to make it interesting.  Wifey said the pork was very good, but I thought the tomato-based stew was a bit bland, particularly after the appetizer broth lit me up.\\n\\nWe both had pecan pie for desert, which comes with what is billed as lemon \\"sherbert\\", but which is more of an ice cream.  I was expecting sorbet (I really wish people would stop calling it sherbert), but it was tasty nonetheless.  We had coffee with the desert.\\n\\nNow, there are always glitches, and there were two:  first, they were too quick with the main dish.  We hadn't finished our appetizers when the main course showed up at the table, which meant we had to hurry through the first in order to get to the second before it cooled.  This is a coordination problem between the kitchen and the waitstaff, which is otherwise quite good.\\n\\nThe second problem was the coffee.  They brought the two cups, but for some reason my wife's cup was piping hot and mine was lukewarm.  I asked the server to just nuke it for me, but she brought me a fresh cup.  Not a big deal, just a detail that a server should check.\\n\\nThe tab, with two glasses of wine, came to $85.  Adding the tip put it over a hundred, which is a bit pricey, but they do have a pub menu at reduced prices from about three o'clock until five.  \\n\\nSo why three stars?  Most people give five stars, but the write-ups never seem to match the \\"as good as it gets\\" descriptive.  Overall, our experience was a good one, and the place could go to four or even five stars with some work, but we're not yet \\"fans\\" and there is better food elsewhere."},{"name":"Boston Shawarma","address":"315 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Wow.

We tried explaining to him that we had just settled a hefty bill and were planning to continue drinking, he didn't care. His reason was that there were other customers waiting to be seated, yet there was nobody at the door waiting for a seat.

This went on for sometime, and when we asked for another pitcher from the server (who said sure) the owner decided to cancel our order and returned to our table to force us out again.

Among Chef Michael Scelfo's many awards are Best Restaurant in the World (Conde Nast Traveler, 2016), Best Restaurant, General Excellence (Boston Magazine, 2016), Best Restaurant (Boston Magazine, 2015), Beard House Recipe (James Beard Foundation, 2015), and countless awards for their burger alone. \\n\\nChef Scelfo's dishes are modern, yet inspired by home-cooked meals with his family. His menu is complimented by an upscale yet intimate subterranean venue in Harvard Square, with plush booths and industrial lighting.\\n\\nWhile their burger was sold out the night we were there, there were no shortage of interesting and scrumptious plates. \\n\\nOur first dish was the striped bass crudo. Whenever we see crudo on a menu, it's almost a given that we'll order it due to our appreciation for ultra fresh, bright plates. This one in particular came with a unique popcorn crema, basil, lime and Calabrian chili. What a perfect example of  Chef Scelfo's modern and upscale dishes with a home-inspired spin (this time it's the humble popcorn).\\n\\nNext we had the self-described \\"Ubiquitous Kale Salad,\\" which is another plate we will almost always order since it's super healthy and every restaurant has it's own take on it. Alden and Harlow puts a creamy spin on it, with pistachio dressing and honey. It's supposed to also come with fennel but I can't stand the stuff, so we had it held. We loved this plate, and the creamy texture was perfect juxtaposed with the structured kale leaves.  \\n\\nWe also tried the Heirloom Tomato Salad, with anchovy and mustard aioli and basil. It also comes with fried bread which sounds heavenly and I'm sure add more substance to the plate, but since we're gluten free we held that one. The tomatoes were very fresh and I loved the aioli even though I'm not a fan of mustard. It was so good we sopped up every last drop with the tomatoes. \\n\\nIt may not look like much, but our favorite plate of the night was the Grilled Local New Potatoes - a must try at Alden & Harlow. They come with smoked egg aioli (how interesting is that?), horseradish (very mild, not overpowering at all), cipollini and pepper caponata. You can tell that this is inspired by a side of potatoes at home, but again made for a modern and hip restaurant. It's hard to explain just how, but we immediately decided that these were the best potatoes we've ever had, and this sauce never stood a chance at escaping our bellies!\\n\\nFinally, we ordered the grilled bluefish, with celery root, remoulade, and pickled green tomatoes. This one was good in my book, but the potatoes were such a tough act to follow! I know the James Beard Foundation prefers another house recipe, but if I had to take home one it would be to that potato plate!\\n\\nApart from a few hiccups, like missing out on the burger and hearing our waitress tell the specials to the family next to us but not to us, we enjoyed trying the small plates at Alden & Harlow.

I wanted to think it was crazy. And silly. And wrong. But it's not. Its kind of totally amazing.\\n\\nFirst, the location on the corner of one of the buildings on the second floor is awesome. Its perfect for people watching to sit on the deck. The north deck and west deck overlook different parts but both are lovely. The interior is really neatly decorated too. Even the bathrooms are cool - they play a tape of learning how to say cowboy phrases in Japanese. I loved it. The other woman in the bathroom weren't amused and wanted normal music, but I think they were unfun and missing the point. The weird cowboy Japanese was on point.\\n\\nOur waiter was amazing - helpful, attentive, and sweet. When he split a tiny bit of my wine, he brought me a second glass on the house. He was quick to give recommendations and be patient with our 'we will order dishes as we go' deal that evening.\\n\\nWe tried three sushi rolls - a traditional roll, the Mad Mango-cado , and two 'burgerushi' rolls - the Doug's Filet Roll and the High Class Hillbilly.\\n\\nThe Mad Mango-cado was good - but nothing special. Because the other two were so special and different it was a bit overshadowed. I would get it again. But come for the crazy stuff. It's worth it.\\n\\nThe Doug's Filet Roll is amazing. It's delicious filet with a but of a spice that goes perfectly from the masago and spicy mayo. It was tasty. We devoured it.\\n\\nThe high class hillbilly is only related to sushi in that it has rice. Its crazy amazing - like you shaped a pulled pork dish into sushi. The potato is thin and crispy and comes with a 'haystack' of thin crispy potato. The BBQ sauce is light but sweet and a bit smokey. I loved the bacon coleslaw on top and I don't even like coleslaw normally. So amazing. Even someone afraid of sushi could eat this. It's as far from sushi as you can get - but in some book, it's still sushi (not really, but here it is.)\\n\\nThe other amazing thing is their milkshakes. My husband got the rice krispies one and it was intense - it tasted like a rice krispies treat! The marshmallow creme along with the rice krispies throughout was yummy.\\n\\nThis is the best place I have been to in CityWalk and the only one I have ever really, truly enjoyed enough to come back again and again."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Stopped here on a business trip from Sacramento, CA.

First the beer.  No Drop Top, no Fat Tire, no amber period.  Well they USED to have this.  Fine.   Looking through the list of beers, I took the Sam Adams Lager.  'No, not that either'.  WTF! It's on you MENU!   Beyond irritated, i took a BFK.  It was ok. Not great, but ok.  Ordered another and it was horrible!  The manager did come by to see how everything was going, nice guy, explained that this tasted nothing like the first one and he explained that they ran out of one of the ingredients and substituted something else. Again, WTF!!  He did bring another, said he was mistaken on the substitution and comped the second one.   Free drinks will mollify most people and restaurant people know that.\\n\\nThe pork chop was dry and chewy, the green beans were not cooked thoroughly, and the mashed potatoes were the only thing decent.\\n\\nAgain, we're gone.

The inside bar area is narrow and crampt, and must be passed through to get to the outside area.  Just about the only thing that Tia's has going for it is that there is the outside area and it is on the water.  If being on the water is that important to you, I would take any of the seaport bars or even Joes next door over this crap.\\n\\nThis place has no concern for their patrons and is solely after sucking as much money out of you as they can.  Of course they don't really care about repeat business because the vast majority of their business is from stupid tourists.  In fact, they are not even open during the non-summer months.  I guess it does give some amusement in the summer to laugh at the tourists wasting their money away at this crap hole when I pass by.\\n\\nSo for the bar, it can get very crowded, especially at night.  The place tends to be full of the sticky collar wearing crowd.  It can be very difficult to move around or get to the bathroom.  The people that come here are also not the type that would make it easy for you to get by - yes this place does attract the bottom of the tourist barrell.  And for the staff, they are the bottom of the bar staff barrell.  I guess it is fitting.  \\n\\nThere can be a line out front when it gets crowded.  The bouncers love it because they get the chance to yell at people to line up where they tell them, even people that are not trying to go to this crappy bar and are only standing on the park walkway.  I guess their bouncing authority is all they have in life so let them enjoy it.  My favorite are the guys who stand and watch the rope that seperates the bar from the walkway to see if anyone crosses.  It must make their night whenever anyone does and they get to have their tantrum.\\n\\nThe worst thing about this place by far is the obscene tourist trap prices.  I can only speak for the drinks and not the food.  As I'm sure you can figure out friom the other reviews this place has crap food and charges 3 times what is reasonable for it.  The drink prices are absurd.  The choices are pay $13 for the equivilent of a shooter at a good bar poured over ice, or pay $7 for a beer that at the much nicer and better quality expensive bars in the area will cost $5.\\n\\nI believe that quality bars in the boston area should have at least one cheaper beer on draft, considering there cannot be happy hours.  Many bars do, at least the bars I frequent.  Tia's does not at all.  Their CHEAPEST beer, and I mean bud lite, coors lite, etc. is $6.50.  $6.50 for watered down crap!  Crap beer is available in the area for $1-$3 (Sissy K's, Coogans, The Living Room, Purple Shamrock, etc. - not saying I like these places but they have at least one beer cheap)\\n\\nThis money drain is worthless and something better should take it's spot.

The smells of delicious BBQ linger in the air while you're sitting, waiting, and wishing that the line would just move already. We finally ordered our food by 12:45 pm. Yes, it took 4 hours for us to get in the door, but it was well worth the wait. \\n\\nThe brisket was so, so delicious and juicy! Perfection! The sausage was good, but nothing amazing like I imagined. The best part of our meal were the ribs. They were smoked perfectly and the meat fell off the bone. I'm not a big meat person, but Franklin's  really changed my mind about that. I wasn't so impressed with sides only because I still love Rudy's creamed corn & potato salad. \\n\\nThe staff was definitely helpful in recommending portion sizes and different kinds of bbq sauce they offered.

Luckily, I had a $30 for $60 worth of food coupon.\\n\\nI made reservations online, so the wait line was no problem at all.  However, the table we were seated at (4 people) was awkwardly facing the entrance, so it felt like we were the receptionists or something. \\n\\nThis is a tapas place, so you order small plates to share (think Guu; Zakkushi).\\n\\nKaiware = radish sprouts\\n\\n1. Salmon Salsa Battera - torched sockeye salmon, cream cheese, tomato salsa,  mayo - sprinkled with thin nori; torched.  6 pieces nigiri type.\\n     We wanted to try this because it said \\"torched.\\"  We're all big fans of aburi (torched) sashimi like toro, so maybe it couldn't be bad.  I wish they torched it a bit more, as I could barely taste the smokiness, but the salsa, cheese, and mayo sauce combo was surprisingly good.\\n\\n2. Tuna takaki - 7-spiced albacore tuna\\n     Based on other places I've tried tuna takaki, I found the sauce here rather bland.  I was expecting the tang from a ponzu sauce or something, but this was just bland.  And maybe they're just looking out for us and don't want us to get mercury poisoning; very few thin slices for $$.\\n\\n3. Fanny Bay Tempura Oysters\\n     This was pretty good. The pickled veggies contrasted well with the shellfish.\\n\\n4. Kakuni & scallop - soy-braised pork belly & seared scallop.  2 medium sized scallops & 4 squares of pork meat.\\n     When it came to the table, we all stared at it for quite a while (not exaggerating). The pork belly were cut in cubes like the Chinese braised pork meat (http://www.heatandknives.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/braisedporkbelly3.jpg), and tasted quite similarly. \\n\\n5. Shortrib lettuce wrap\\n     This Korean-inspired dish came with the meat swimming in its sauce, on a bed of deep-fried rice noodles, 6 butterhead lettuce leaves, pickled lotus roots, and a sweet chili sauce.  This dish was good; got a little messy because of the meat sauce, but the flavors balanced out quite nicely.  Also, the sweet chili sauce is not overpoweringly spicy, as even my friend who finds pepper too spicy could handle it.\\n\\n6. Ebimayo cone - tempura prawn, avocado, chili mayo\\n     One order of cones is two cones, so we had two orders.  It was a mutual agreement that the cone was a hit.  I loved that the spiciness wasn't just addition of chili sauce but instead incorporated into the mayo.\\n\\n6 dishes resulted in ~$100 not including tip.  With the coupon, we paid ~$60. It's nice to come try the dishes, but don't expect to get full unless you're willing to dish out a lot.  The ambiance is good for dates, and the view is good (right at the waterfront), so the high price is expected.  However, with that money, I can get just as tasty, if not better, food and be satisfied without feeling sorry about my wallet.  Guu is a cheaper alternative, with more choices, if you enjoy the small tapas.\\n\\nBtw, we went to McDonalds afterwards.

Very fresh ingredients and a good amount of crab, on a bed of home-made spicy cole slaw. \\n\\nStarted with their soup of the day - chicken curry with winter vegetables. Hearty with a mild curry flavor.... very good. It had a depth of flavor that spoke to careful attention to using a good (probably home made) stock and fresh vegetables.\\n\\nI am not a fish eater, but tonight I decided to go outside my comfort zone for the entree, and I had the fresh cod Parmesan. Now, let me say that when I order something outside of my comfort zone in a restaurant, I am almost always disappointed and wish I had stuck to tried and true meat-and-potatoes fare.\\n\\nBut, I figured if I was going to eat fish, this is probably the place to do it, so I took the plunge. I resolved that if I hated it, I would not blame them. After all, I know I dislike fish, so it would be my fault for ordering it, not theirs.\\n\\nWell.\\n\\nNot only did I not hate it, but I thoroughly enjoyed it, and ate every last bite. Very unheard of for me. The cod was definitely fresh. No fishy taste at all. And done perfectly - moist & flaky, not mushy or dry. It had a nice crust, and a very good caper sauce - not so much as to smother the fish and make the breading soggy. I would order it again without question. \\n\\nNow let me say that the waitress (didn't catch her name) was very patient and gracious, even though we took a  long time to decide what to order, and they were very, very busy (Saturday night). A lot of waitresses would have been frustrated that a table was taking up so much of her time on a very busy night, but she made us feel perfectly at home taking as long as we needed, and didn't rush or \\"punish\\" us by ignoring us later during the meal.\\n\\nOnce again, Seasons & Regions did not disappoint.

However, when you've been sitting there for an hour and a 1/2...two hours just chatting while the line and seating list for Dirty Franks is literally out-the-door, this is your cue to please take your conversation to a bar, a coffee shop, or back home. Please allow everyone to enjoy the best hot dogs in Columbus, just as you have, instead of having them try to glare you down to get the hell up from your table.

Therefore, you'll likely find many politicos and businesspeople hanging out here between the hours of 5-10 on weekdays! There are also often events held here by lobbyists, politicians and businesspeople that may draw big crowds, and, if you are not a part of the event, could be bothersome. I have been invited to many of those fundraising and schmoozing events and therefore had a great time! It is important to note that I have also been there on my own accord with friends and enjoyed myself just as well.\\n\\nThe bartenders here are friendly & attentive and make their vodka sodas very strong...this is good...and dangerous! They have a nice selection of beer and their bar is accessible and laid out well. The food here is just as pleasing: hamburgers and pizza are above par and I definitely recommend the homemade potato chips with their special secret scrumptious dipping sauce (someone please tell me what that is concocted of...it's so good)! \\n\\nCome here with a couple drinks and snacks with friends while in German Village and you'll be sure to have a great time. This is moreso a laid back bar rather than a stuck up \\"club\\" (and certainly not a dance club of any sort). The interior is exposed brick and there is also a PHOTO BOOTH (like the ones at the mall you took pics in with your friends when you were 13).

Only thing they don't tell you is that the house keeps all the money that exceeds $1000. My tournament was roughly 30 people and with add on's everyone was bought in for around $70 a piece. The total prize pool should have been around $2100 but they still only paid out the $1000 guaranteed. That's Ace of Spades keeping over 50% of the tournament prize pool.

Esp when you will be sweating in places you never imagined.) The line was slow movin and it took us about an hour to get our food.

I mean come on, its bbq, you better go all out!), 1 lb. pork ribs, a pulled pork sandwich, and a side of cole slaw. (Eyes bigger than stomach?! You betcha!!! I'm still eating leftovers!! Leftover bbq never tasted so good.) This bill was $50 (thanks seesterrr!), and was plenty of food for probably 4 people. I tried all three sauces: tangy, sweet, and the infamous expresso. My favorite was the expresso, it just had one good kick to it, whoever thought express and bbq sauce = genius! This is a must try!!

I'd say so.\\n\\nI got different things this time. I got the slider AND BOY was it tasty. they give you a little scoop of potato salad on the side which was also quite good. While you do only get 1 little slider, if you get ramen in addition to that you will be plenty full by the end of your meal. I got a #2 ramen this time. The first time I came here I knocked my rating down a star because I didn't find my ramen hot enough when it was served to me. THIS time around my ramen was served much hotter. The same friend from before was with me and also had their ramen served nice and hot. So all is forgiven.\\n\\nI really wish this place was bigger and had more seating. You'll find that most people are pretty good at understanding that it's \\"courteous\\" to eat your meal quickly and then leave when you are done to free up space for the people who have been waiting in line for over an hour. Yet some people have no social politeness and will take their sweet time eating their meal which is what happened on this occasion. After about an hour of waiting in line, we finally got to where you could see inside the restaurant through the big glass window. There was a table of four people, 3 adults and a kid in a highchair. The mother was trying to get the kid to eat his food, but he was more interested in climbing out of his highchair and looking through the window. The other two adults at the table had already finished their meals and were just sitting there. THEN, the mother took her kid to the bathroom and was gone for about 10 minutes. The waitstaff tried to clear some of the dishes about a dozen times, but the other two adults at the table kept telling them they weren't finished yet. When the mother returned with her kid, she continued to try and get him to eat more food. They FINALLY left about 10 minutes before we were almost about to place our order. \\n\\nThis might sound like a silly thing to complain about, but I think it's fair to say that that table alone added at least 30 minutes or so of waiting time for the people standing in line.

There may not be much to add other than this BBq is worth every second spent waiting in line, seriously.\\n\\nArriving at 740am on a Thursday in April 2017 yielded numbers 15 and 16 in line - one gentleman had arrived at 430am. By 1030, see the picture included, The line was to the end of the parking lot, approximately 75 yards away. Onsite, there is a decent supply of folding beach/camping chairs to use while waiting in line. If unsure as to an arrival time, it is suggested to bring chairs. Bring a cooler with lots of beer as the wait from early morning to 11am open time is a long one.\\n\\nDuring the wait, bathrooms are available for use as is beer for purchase and clothing items. \\n\\nAs open time approaches, the line manager will arrive to take approximate orders to ensure folks waiting in line will have enough food - the folks in front of us ordered 50 pounds of brisket to go. On this note, ordering in advance, online is possible for takeout in the rear pick up area from a trailer.\\n\\nOnce the line starts moving, the pace is manageable. \\n\\nThe 1.5lbs brisket, 4 spareribs, 1/2 lb turkey, and two sausages weighed in total at around 3.5 pounds of meat for $120. Per meat, the range is from $14/lb for sausage to $22/lb for brisket. \\n\\nServed on a tray with as much white bread as desired, the meat is presented in a flawlessly arranged mountain of meat.\\n\\nThe famed Brisket is famed for a reason - an intensely salt and peppered bark exterior yields way to what some claim to be the worlds most unctuous piece of meat. Referred to as \\"cotton candy,\\" the beef is so moist, tender and fluffy that it pulls easily into big size chunks. Luscious, soft as warm butter, this brisket is consummate in rendered fat and smoke, an experience unlike any other.l\\n\\nPork spareribs are dusted with slightly less pepper but a similar amount of salt creating a mahogany colored bark the is crisp yet snappy. With each bite, juices flow freely as the meat pulls smoothly from the bone. The smoke essence is almost sweet and helps to tone down the rich pork flavor. The pork is moist, tender and smooth. As good as the brisket in it's own right.\\n\\nA serving of turkey presents an cream colored meat with with a brown exterior skin. The meat is moist and smoke is evident from outside to inside.\\n\\nSausages are smoky with a slight kick from red pepper. Juices ooze from the crumbly grind encased in a snappy exterior. Smoke is lighter here but absolutely noticeable. Excellent.\\n\\nPotato salad, cole slaw, pinto beans available as sides, but who has room?\\n\\nPickles and onions available on the sides. \\n\\nIndividual serving, mini dessert pies - think pecan and key lime in graham cracker crust - are as good as the meats and absolutely worth ordering even if they must be eAten at a later date. \\n\\nIf traveling for food is in the cards, make this a stop."},{"name":"Tudo Na Brasa","address":"414 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"4","text":"Very casual lunch place.

Because that, I was. \\n\\nThe venison chili with bitter chocolate and smoked cheddar was my adventurous choice, but sadly, I wasn't pleased. Neither of us were able to taste the chocolate, but the nail in the coffin was the saltiness of the entire entree. Were they trying to disguise the unpleasant aftertaste? Because I was hit by both. Now I know that venison can be dry and gamy, and granted, this plate wasn't; however, it was likely due to the fact that it was a chili and soaked in sauce. The small piece of cornbread topping it was good, and a welcomed respite from the rest of the dish.\\n\\nMy friend got the carbonara pizza with guanciale, which I had a bite of and quite enjoyed. Unfortunately he said it was the saltiest pizza he's ever had. Maybe the chef's salt-shaker hand was a little too wobbly today? I'm convinced that may be the case. Though my friend's appetite is hefty, he wasn't able to finish the salt pizza- I mean- carbonara pizza, and had to box the rest of it to take home. \\n\\nTo be honest, the only reason I wanted to go was because I always walk past it, and the patrons always seem to be enjoying themselves.

As someone who has worked many years in the beverage industry, I can authoritatively say that it shouldn't even be allowed on the menu. Our appetizer came, a duck breast served with saut√©ed Brussels sprouts and curry sauce. It was fine but the duck itself was exceptional. It was perfectly tender. I will give it that. But in terms of flavor, the dish as a whole was unexceptional. We decided to order the coconut ice cream and chocolate rice for desert as well as coffee and earl grey tea. We were brought our tea and coffee and informed that there was no milk or cream in the restaurant after the fact. My partner is not in the habit of drinking black americanos and I take my tea with milk. Only the coffee was refunded. The ice cream arrived. It was clearly freezer burned.

But I'm here only to inform you of my now rounded out BBQ knowledge.  So we'd been to pretty much all of the hailed BBQ joints but Franklin.  Mainly because I'm just impatient no matter what the outcome of patience might award me.  So my husband decided to brave the wait on a recent Saturday.  He got in line at 8:15 and we ate around 2:30.  (I showed up at 1:30, see aforementioned patience issue).  Franklin are absolute all stars at keeping their line happy.  The employees making beer runs for you to the BYOB policy to the handing out sandwich snacks are all solid moves.  And letting the people know that are walking up to the line at 4 under some delusion they will get BBQ that they are sold out, is just another solid good sumaritan move.\\n\\nLets get to the Q. It's amazing. Its fantastic and definitely worth my 1 hour wait. ;)  The beef rib was the single best bite of meat I've had in my life.  That's the truth.  And just so you trust me.  I like John Mueller's brisket more than I like Franklin's, even though Franklin's is for sure 5 star.   If I had to wait in line for brisket ever, I'd choose J Mueller but if it was for beef ribs. Franklin all the way.   Franklin also had outstanding sausage and ribs.  Some of the best.  I'm not a fan of that coffee sauce but hey, you can't win them all.\\n\\nI do think it's super strange that they only have one meat cutter.  Common sense would lend itself to say that even having two cutters would have reduced our wait from 6 hours to 3 hours, which seems like a customer sat win, but obviously they aren't struggling, so maybe that's why? Keeping the line keeps the mystere?\\n\\nTip:  When your belly is full and you're headed out, knock on the metal door on the patio that says BBQ on it and you'll get a quick tour of the pits.

The confit was magically dry as a bone and though I like it crispy it appeared that the herbs they used when it was confitted had not been removed very well as they were left on the leg/thigh for me to eat (also dried out might I add.)  The blueberry sauce was lumpy and though I get that it is a more rustic tavern-y place the sauce had practically congealed by the time I got the plate though the plate was ripping hot as well.\\n\\nI politely informed our server of the egregious errors with the dish and simply asked to have it remade or substitute for the scallops over pasta which was what ended up coming back to me.

The wait was not a problem.  My party of three arrived approximately 20 minutes before 5PM on a Tuesday, and we were in the restaurant and waiting to order just after 5.  The entire line that formed still wasn't enough to fill the place up immediately after they opened, although I would imagine Saturdays are worse.  Ordering was easy (small menu), they served us Sapporos while we waited in line. As soon as we walked in we heard a loud battle cry from back in the kitchen (really awesome to hear that enthusiasm).  The ordering and waiting portion was fair and easy.\\n\\nNow, the food.  We ordered the #1 with a spicy bomb, one of the salads, and the sweet and sour brussell sprouts.  The ramen came out fast, it was hot, and the noodles were great. The broth was perfect to me, and I found the salt levels exactly what I wanted and expected for ramen.  The mushrooms were delicious, the pork was melt-in-your mouth good, and the egg was so good it was the best part of the entire dish to me.  I don't know what they did to that egg, but it's insanely good. The spicy bomb really kicked up the broth and the entire dish was velvety, rich, and umami.  The salad was pretty good, but the sweet and sour brussell sprouts were delicious. \\n\\nWe topped it off with another Sapporo and finished with some mango mochi balls.  The meal was entirely top notch, surprisingly cheaper than what I was willing to pay for, and the staff was friendly, funny, and enthusiastic.  I'd honestly go there every day if I could.  It's not really a criticism to say this, but my only regret is that their hours are so restrictive.  But, I'm guessing that's the price one has to pay to get ramen like this.

We forgot to mention that we like our salmon cooked medium rare so unfortunately it came out well cooked and in our opinions, overcooked (flaky).  When salmon is overcooked it is inherently dry and requires a lot of sauce. The sauce was a shrimp sauce and there was not enough of it.

The lady who was in charge of the upgrades was really nice and helpful but she was about the only one who was. The upgraded appetizers in the VIP room consisted of cold ham, microwaved Mexican burritos which they called chicken fajitas, and broccoli cheddar casserole. The only thing I enjoyed was the portabello mushroom ravioli with sauce, which I had a few servings of. When they say that the princess makes a special stop in the VIP room before the show, they really mean that she comes in through a back door and basically says \\"Hey, see you at the show!\\", and leaves after 30 seconds. The private bartender isn't really worth it either because the main room has a bigger and more festive bar area. Lastly, because the VIP is blocked off in the back of the waiting area, you can't really hear what's going on during the pre-show when the characters come out and perform some magic tricks before the main event.\\n\\nI wont lie, the food itself wasn't bad except the chicken was a little on the dryer side. I wouldn't recommend the soup though, disgusting, get the salad.\\n\\nWhat I would recommend to Pirate's Dinner Adventure is to learn how to make their table service work with as little interruption as possible to the patrons!! I don't know how many times I was asked questions throughout the show so that I was lost on what the show was actually about. Before I knew it the pirate I was cheering for was out of the competition and I didn't understand what the characters on stage were doing. Imagine sitting through a 2 hour movie where you don't have the slightest idea of what's going on.\\n\\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this show to an tourists looking for a dinner show. I would definitely say that Medieval Times is a much better show with a nicer venue, better pre-show area and clearer storyline to follow along. I feel like I wasted money coming to this show."},{"name":"Five Guys","address":"8963 SE 82nd Ave","city":"Happy Valley","stars":"3.5","text":"Great burgers only exception would be the bun(could use a better bun,gets to soggy). \\nSimplicity at it's best. \\nNot a fan of the fries the the family loves them. \\nHave went several times weekly since they opened. \\nWill be back."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Double Update (ugh! ugh!)\\n\\nRamen Tatsu-Ya now has a \\"slurpy hour.\\" Not sure why it's called that, the ramen isn't discounted, but $2 house sake from 2-6pm.\\n\\nLet me reiterate:\\n$2.HOUSE.SAKE."},{"name":"The Whole Bowl Cart","address":"1100 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Simple, Delicious, Dependable, Clean, -- In my opinion this is the BEST FOOD CART IN PORTLAND!\\n\\nTruly delicious and healthy lunch you will not regret or soon forget.

We usually go to Chuys but this year we decided to go in town to No Mas. They would not serve us frozen margarita and later in the evening we saw individuals drinking frozen margaritas. We understand that these people made a big fuss to get drinks that were on the menu. My friend did not get her food because they ran out of shrimp after they served everyone else at our table.\\nThey financially compensated us but money cannot make up for messing up my Birthday. I thank God for seeing another year but will not be celebrating another birthday here.\\n\\nI hope you see this response. I did mention in my review that the meal and drinks for our party was paid for. I also realize that May 5th is a busy day for you. I am actually 57, I think older than you. I have been going out Mexican for the last four years since my divorce in 2013. Every year but this I have gone to Chuys in Dunwoody. I love Mexican so I eat it all through the year and my friends wanted to go back to a place I had taken them too in Virginia Highlands. Could not find it and I had been to your restaurant before so we decided on your restaurant. At the point you became involved there was nothing you could do but comp the meal. I was not paying for anything anyway and you could not give me back my time. Your waitress could have apologized and I don't know how you can justify serving everybody at the table and then coming back 15 minutes later saying we ran out of shrimp so no food for you. I saw people with frozen drinks later in the evening. One of your servers said the guests made a big fuss and so they got frozen drinks. You will never satisfy every customer but maybe our experience will cause you to train your servers differently when handling large crowds. Honesty is important in a server. I don't know if you have ever been to Chick fa la but they know how to treat their customers. I am sure your business will not suffer because of my review.

From the wraparound porch to the beautiful trees and overall charm of the interior decor, my then-fiance and I along with our wedding planner were all sold. (And we hadn't even tried the food at that point!) \\n\\nWhat we had no way of knowing was what wonderful partners we would have in JR Zincone, events manager for Red Beard Restaurants, and the entire Revival team. JR made every interaction, whether by phone, by email or in-person, a detailed, calm-inducing planning moment for us. \\n\\nRevival's team was wonderfully accommodating of our requests and open to our ideas. From inclement weather to drop-in guests, every potential problem had a pre-planned solution, and thanks to JR's support, we were able to transform our vision for our wedding into a beautiful, seamlessly-run reality. \\n\\nOur day turned out exactly as we'd envisioned, and our guests raved about the setting, the food, and the experience. We were blessed with gorgeous autumnal weather, so our ceremony took place out front beneath the Magnolia trees. Our wedding party photos were shot before of Revival's picturesque housefront, and we celebrated our reception on Revival's covered porch (with the house's Sewing Room as our rainy-day back-up location). \\n\\nThe reception featured Southern Sunday brunch fare including Bloody Mary's, mimosas and champagne as well as a three-course meal complete with all of the our Southern-fried favorites such as meatloaf, fried chicken and trout almandine. Our guests couldn't get enough, and we even left for our \\"mini-moon\\" with a take-away package of food for later! \\n\\nAll in all, we are pleased and proud to be the first of what I imagine will be many weddings at Revival, and we hope our experience will give you a taste of the sinfully delicious, stunningly executed Southern experience that awaits your palette at 129 Church Street, Decatur, Ga."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I was at a conference in Austin and chose this place on a whim because it was rainy and cold and ramen sounded perfect.

The eggs were poached perfectly, not too runny and not too hard. The ham hock had a nice smokey flavour but the taste of pork was still there and it was tender. The hollandaise sauce had a pleasant dill pickle taste infused, which gave a fresh twist to the rich flavours of the ham hock and buttery hollandaise. The salad that came with the dosh was refreshing and crisp. The potato hashbrowns were browned and seasoned nicely with a soft potato centre. \\n\\nI sampled some of my friend's food as well. The Crispy Pork with Polenta, Scrambled Egg and Corn Salsa would definitely be a favourite of mine. That smoked crispy pork and sweet corn all a top a smooth polenta and perfectly scrambled eggs mixed in with gooey cheddar cheese was a magical combination.

Your safest bet is to stick with the appetizers. The chow foon here is comes out in uneven clumps and doused in their strange corn starch sauce. Broken rice dishes are often substituted with regular grain rice. Pad thai is under seasoned as is the fried rice. Any rice or noodle dish containing seafood is cooked with the precut frozen mixed seafood pieces all Asian restaurants have, and they're not at all shameless of the imitation crab pieces either.

Mostly my fault, as I couldn't find parking, and they wouldn't seat my party until we were all there. Next time, I'll either take the T or be prepared to shell out some $$ for their valet service.\\n\\nWe sit down and everything looks yummy on the menu. I decide to opt for some orange juice, and the stuffed omelet. I also had a bite of someone's eggs benedict, which were yummy as well, and a tad spicy which was an interesting kick. The OJ came right away, but everything else took forever! It took about 20-30 minutes for a friend's tapas to arrive, and another 5 minutes or so before we got our one, and only, water refill. It then took about another 20 minutes for our food to arrive. Now, I know that food being slow isn't usually the waitress' fault - it's the kitchen's for getting backed up or just the restaurant being busy in general (which it was, but not packed). That being said, it IS the waitress' fault for not checking in and letting us know that it was going to take a little longer for our food to come up. If she had, we wouldn't have been wondering what was taking so long, and she would have realized that everyone needed something to drink. That would have been much better than us sitting there feeling like we were stuck in the Sahara with no food or water in sight for miles. Thank goodness none of us were coming to brunch after a long night of drinking - we wouldn't have made it with that little bit of water!\\n\\nLastly, the menu prices and the bill prices were not the same. When I asked the waitress about this (to make sure it wasn't a mistake) she basically blew me off and just said that she knew, and the bill price was correct. (I had looked online before I went to determine what I wanted and how much cash to bring, and I double checked when I got home, even the online prices are \\"incorrect\\" - according to her). I gave the constructive feedback that maybe that should be mentioned at the start of someone's meal, and/or not put a mini menu of wrong prices in with the check. She just about rolled her eyes at me. OK, lady... after you basically ignored us all morning, that attitude as not appreciated... not in the slightest.\\n\\nIf the food here was just \\"Meh, ok\\" I don't think I'd come back, and the star rating would have been a 2.

The brisket was some of the best I've had in the area - plenty of smoke flavor with a bit of seasoning from salt & pepper  - just as it should be.  It was still moist and practically falling apart - I could easily cut it with a fork.  This is some proper Texas brisket.  The turkey was also pretty darned good but a tad dry and a tad salty.

It lacked flavor and was so dry that I had difficulty taking it down even with a beverage. If they had served it with gravy or something maybe that would have helped a tiny bit. We also ordered the roasted Brussels sprouts with cornbread dressing, which were tasty but nothing special. \\n\\nOverall, the food, service and experience were about average.

Reservations are available through OpenTable and were very easy to make over the phone.\\n\\nWe were seated immediately at a table closest to the front of the restaurant, and about as far from the kitchen as possible. Our initial thought was that we would have trouble with the Gauchos visiting us, which turned out to be furthest from the truth. There were only two other tables seated, a two- and a four-top when we arrived.

She provided us with the selection of wines and chose a fantastic Argentinian Cabernet Sauvignon. \\n\\nWhen it came time for the main course of the rotisserie meats, the Gauchos were very frequent with various cuts of meat and followed the green/red marker perfectly. The highlights included garlic beef, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, and Picanha, marketed as the house special.

We wanted to try a wide variety of what they had to offer.  Amazingly enough there was more than could really truly be appreciated all in one sitting, they don't skimp on the spice here and I like that.  This isn't going to be a lesson in Indian cuisine either, I don't know what half of the stuff I ate was.  \\n\\nThe usual three sauces were great; the dark flavorful, the green fresh and light and the chutney fiery.  The vegetarian dishes were very good, I particularly enjoyed the pakora.  The chicken tikka masala, generally my favorite was outdone by the other chicken dishes.  The lamb was tasty too but I didn't enjoy fishing through all the bones to get to it.\\n\\nOther than the yummy nan the star of this meal was the wine.  It was an Indian wine made especially for the food and it showed.  One sip and all the heat and flavor cleansed right out of your mouth.

There was just a 236A exit which I passed up!!!!  Arghhh,  Anyways....the location is pretty much at the intersection of Concordia and Interstate 35 heading North, off of the feeder road.  There is no red light at Concordia so just look for a little street before you hit a red light.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, I can see a long line extending from a little winnebago and maybe a dozen picnic tables.\\n\\nWe parked on the side street next to some cute little houses and walked up to the place.\\n\\nIt was noon and there were people already chowing down on some good looking food.  My hub stood in the line while I grabbed a picnic table.  My little pup made buddies with the rest of the doggies that were there and just hung out under the umbrella.  There is a restroom to the south of the location, so if you need to wash your hands or floss your meat filled teeth, that's where to go!!\\n\\nOKay, on with the food.  We ordered:\\n\\nA pound of brisket\\nA plate of pork ribs - came with mustard potato salad and pinto beans\\nAnd one sausage link\\nAnd 3 slices of Mrs. Bairds white bread\\n\\n\\nThe brisket was phenomenal -it was tender, the meat peeled off so tenderly and the smoke ring was gorgeous--I think the best I have ever had.  I did not need any sauce!\\n\\nThe pork ribs were very well seasoned - you can see all of the black pepper on the ribs and also the nice pink smoke ring along the outside of the meat.\\n\\nThe sausage was not that good --the flavor was good but the texture was just not all that....it was too ground up/fine for me..i like my sausage to have more texture with bits of meat and fat.\\n\\nWhen you order your food, you tell one of the (cute) guys what you want.  They ask if you want the fatty or lean portion and then get on chopping your food.

While I found food and drinks disappointing when I ate at Wink and Nod last year,  I have already eaten dinner twice since the restaurant changed chefs and have reservations to eat here again this week!  I eat out a lot in Boston and it has been a while since I've been this excited about going out to dinner. \\n\\nThe atmosphere at Wink and Nod is great. Earlier in the evening, it is subdued and perfect for a date or catching up with friends. As the night progresses, the action shifts to the bar and things get more lively.  I love the comfortable armchairs at the dinner tables, low lighting and speakeasy feel.  There is a great cocktail menu and the bartender on both visits had no problem making me a great drink based on my request for something \\"light with ginger\\".  While I eat everything, my first visit, I came with a vegetarian friend.  The menu doesn't have a lot of veg options but the chef made her an incredible tasting menu that she loved. For those that do not eat gluten, the kitchen is very accommodating as well.  I had the lobster curry which is extraordinary. It is hard to describe the flavor but it is one of those dishes that you ask for bread so you can soak up every last drop.  Also, on the menu the first time (but not the second) was pasta.  If you ever see pasta on the menu, order it.  It was super fresh and had a light, mushroom sauce.  Roast lamb was so tender I didn't need a knife and came with rice. My veg friend also got rice with her dish and we both referred to it as \\"magic rice\\". While neither of us usually get excited about rice, we both couldn't stop eating it.  Also, amazing was lobster butter with bread.  Seriously, it is like crack and I couldn't stop eating it.   Dessert was perfect: the passion fruit gelles were soft, chewy and a burst of passion fruit flavor while the chocolate cake was dense, rich and came with crunchy peanut brittle. \\n\\nThe second dinner was a date and was just as good as the first dinner   We got the Caesar salad with shrimp, lobster curry, sirloin, pork & clams, and dessert.  I wouldn't normally get excited about a caesar salad but with roasted romaine, perfectly cooked shrimp and the best dressing ever, I would happily eat this every day. The lobster curry was just as good as the first time.  I'm definitely a carnivore and the sirloin was meatastic! Half was left as is while the other half of the sirloin was sliced and served with an anchovy sauce that really complimented the meat.  My date's pork and clams come with a huge slab of pork belly, clams and really good Brussels sprouts which he enjoyed.  I ordered the chocolate cake again and this time it came with curry ice cream. Sounds weird, right? But it was actually delicious and really went well with the chocolate and coconut that came with the cake.  Even my date who said he hates coconut and curry, tried a bite and then proceeded to eat most of it! \\n\\nDefinitely looking forward to eating at Wink and Nod again, soon!"},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Best Barbecue I waited 4 hours made friends in line my favorites the brisket ribs and sausage sides were ok all very good can't wait till next year to go back.

It was a bit of a convolution, which added to the intimacy of the eating experience and could signify years of gradual expansion.  Valet parking was appreciated but not needed--we took Max and only had to walk a few blocks.\\n\\nI had a half dozen oysters.  There was a huge selection.  My prior research was not very helpful--same descriptions for each varietal.  Therefore, I just accepted the kumamoto recommendation made by the waiter.  Nice presentation and good taste.  No grit.\\n\\nMy wife had the house version of the clam chowder.  Lots of bacon to accent the clam.  She was quite pleased and scraped the bowl clean.\\n\\nMy entree was the pecan crusted catfish with mango-jalapeno \\"chutney\\" (seemed more like a sauce).  Oh my! It was good.  My wife claimed that she could taste a bit of the mud under-flavor typically found in catfish, but I could only sense the blend of textures, reverberating spice and excellent  preparation.\\n\\nMy wife had the special swordfish but sent it back due to being overly salty.  She is not a picky eater, typically.  So, I trust her assessment.  I tasted it before it was sent back--yeah, it was salty, but that is a subjective thing.  She got it replaced with a salmon dish.  She was very happy with that (I preferred the swordfish, truth be told. both paled to my catfish).\\n\\nThe plates were identical--fish with 3 asparagus spears with julienned carrot on that and some mashed potato.  My wife thought the potatoes were lump-infused, which meant that they were not from dehydrated.  Not a helpful description(that's why I write the reviews on Yelp).  I thought they were delicious--great way to counter the spice of the catfish (which wasn't overly spiced, by the way).\\n\\nWe got the trio for dessert.  I enjoyed the creme brulee, but happened to have had this dessert 3 days in a row and rate this 3rd on the list.  The chocolate item was da bomb and my wife and I competed to get the bigger half of the bread pudding.

Great start to a great meal.\\n\\nWorth the effort.  Obviously, get the catfish if you are overwhelmed by the expansive menu.

I've been about 5 times and have waited in the pouring, cold rain in January and even waited in the deadly, July, Texas heat. Whether you're a local or a visitor, Franklin's is a must.\\n\\nThe meat: I'll be the first person to admit that I'm generally not a brisket person (shun me, I know), and I'm not the biggest fan of red meat in general. Having said that, I've had my fair share of good barbeque and red meat. The first two times I went to Franklin's, I went for the sausage and ribs, which were admittedly good. The next time, I tried the lean brisket. But I finally came to my senses the last two times and went for the fatty brisket. Get the fatty brisket! Getting lean brisket is pretty much half-assing because you're already at a barbeque shop! The meat is so tender and literally melts in your mouth. The sauces really amps up the flavor profile even more. I love the Dr. Pepper one especially. \\n\\nThe pie: While I'm not the biggest red meat eater, I've probably had more than a lifetime's worth of desserts in 23 years. The banana bourbon pie is honestly out of this world. It is not overly sweet, but just right. I cannot remember a single time that pie has been this good. \\n\\nThe wait: Go early. Don't be stupid and show up at 10:30am and cut it close. You don't want to be the guy whose behind the last person in line who gets the brisket. There's usually someone who will go around and take orders before the doors open to try to gauge how much meat will be available. They're good about keeping your expectations realistic about how much meat will be available by the time you get to the front of the line if you're further back in line. Make sure you grab a friend or two (or a book), or else your wait will likely be long and miserable. Bring some lounge chairs, a stereo, whatever you need to get through the wait. Franklin's has some lounge chairs available, but there's not that many to go around. You can bring your own drinks (they also sell beers) while waiting in line, but remember to bring your ID because they will card you. The employees at Franklin's are super friendly and in the past have brought out samples of meat. \\n\\nIf you really, truly, don't want to sit in line for hours: 1) consider going on a weekday. Otherwise 2) you can come after the lunch rush/right before close and get the meats that are leftover meat, oftentimes ribs or chopped beef.

I rarely ever post on Yelp, but I can't ignore my experience that I had with this restaurant today. I go to school in the Waltham area and use the food delivery app Grubhub on occasion. I was tired of campus food, so I decided to give Cafe Anthony a shot and order delivery through the app. Not worth it. \\n\\nI placed my order at 10:33 am, and got a notification that I should expect my delivery between 11:20 and 11:30. My order did not get delivered to me until 12:20, and if I myself had not contacted the restaurant, I wouldn't have even thought I'd be getting my food. The man who I spoke to on the phone was nice enough, but didn't think to offer me any type of discount, or even apologize for the absurdly long wait. At one point, he couldn't even get the delivery man to pick up his phone. The delivery driver also wound up on the other side of campus, which is an issue that could've been avoided if he had read my two notes I posted in my order telling him to call me as soon as he got on campus (when filling out the order form, you give your phone number so the restaurant could call me if an issue exactly like this arises) so I could tell him how to get to my dorm from the entrance.\\n\\nMy school is only about 5 miles, or 20 minutes, from the restaurant. I can understand a 5-10 minute delay with my order, but an hour late is ridiculous. \\n\\nNow, onto the food. I ordered a steak and cheese sub, a grilled chicken and pesto roll-up, and some french fries. The total amount for all three of these items, including delivery fees and tip (which I'd given to the driver before my whole delivery fiasco), came out to around $32. All of my food was cold when it got here, the fries were soggy, and my steak and cheese sub...didn't have cheese in it. I'm still perplexed. Apparently I'm not the only one who was given a cheese-less steak and cheese- see Amanda R.'s review just below mine.\\n\\nI go to a school with 4,000 kids, and have strong ties to other schools very close by, who love to adventure out into the Boston area food scene. Rest assured, I will tell them of my experience here today and make sure that they don't encounter the same issues I did. I've also worked in the food business for 3 years, and my father has owned a restaurant for as long as I can remember- this is not how customer service should be handled.

I arrived before my dinner guests on a Friday night and was greeted by the only smile I saw on an employees face all night...the host.  He took my name, number in party, and told me it would be a 30 - 45 minute wait when I arrived at 6 PM.  I wasn't surprised by the wait, and once my girls arrived we grabbed drinks and headed outside to wait and chat.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, one of my girls accidentally spilled her $8 glass of house red...all over herself, her purse, and the bench we were sitting on.  I went to the bar and explained what happened.   The unsympathetic bar tender got me a dry towel from the back of the house, and that was that...he did not offer to refill her glass of wine that had barely been sipped.  My girl drove home to change and we were seated for dinner moments before she returned.\\n\\nOnce we were settled at our booth, I asked the unfriendly waitress, Jillian, what the policy was when a customer accidentally spilled their wine.  No, I couldn't let poor service go.  I was told that it depended where it happened and which employee was dealing with it.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME, I THOUGHT?????  Before becoming a teacher, I worked in the biz, and I can tell you, that if a customer of mine spilled a drink I did everything in my power to minimize the embarrassment and without question, would replace the drink.  I can't remember an establishment I have ever been to that would not strive to do the same thing. Shame on you Screen Door!\\n\\nDinner I have to say was very good.  I had the catfish, slaw, and mac, a traditionally southern supper.  The slaw could have been tangier, but it was still very good.  The cornbread was nothing more than edible.  My girls had the pork chop, catfish, beet salad, mash potatoes and gravy, bean salad, and the arugula salad.  You can choose sides and order additional sides as well (obviously by the amount of food on our table).  Hands down the back of the house did a very good job preparing the meal...they have talent.  The portions are much larger than in New Orleans and the entrees are reasonably priced.  They carry Abita beer...which having just relocated back to my hometown from New Orleans is a nice touch.\\n\\nThe service was underwhelming.  Jillian was accurate and efficient, but that was it.  No smile, no chatting up the menu, no sense of grace.  Nothing....flat line.  I thought about checking her for a pulse.  \\n\\nA positive I must mention is that the place attracts a multicultural crowd unlike any other restaurant in Portland.

Being from San Diego we have tons of noodle restaurants and I was so excited to go on a rainy day. That being said, I am sad to say my experience with the service was terrible. We waited in line for about 30 minutes to get in on a Tuesday at 6:30pm, I wasn't surprised nor bothered by this. We get in and the lady at the counter takes our order, she was helpful in that I had never been there before and gave me a few suggestions, I wanted something vegetarian but they didn't have that option available so so she suggested I get meat on the side so my date could eat it. The food runner dropped my food only (not his) and when I asked to make sure the meat was on the side she stared at me and rudely said \\"um, no\\" I said I had ordered it on the side and she didn't offer to take it back so I said I would try to pick it out because I didn't want to make a fuss. Then his food came out, he LOVED all of it (miso hot ramen and first rice/porkbelly bowl) After taking the meat out of my ramen I asked one of the male servers if they had any hot sauce, he said yes, brought it out to me promptly and then came and put a receipt in front of my face and told me I had to go pay for the \\"chili paste\\" he brought me before I left. RUDE-  A: I didn't even like it so I was annoyed they wanted me to go pay for it after I was done eating dinner B: I don't necessarily mind paying extra (I come from the food & beverage industry so I understand food cost) but they should train their staff to handle the situation properly. EX: Yes ma'am we have a house made chili paste that is a $1 extra would you care for some? At the end of dinner I handed him my credit card for the \\"hot sauce\\" I had requested with my meal and he told me to go to the counter and pay for it. WOW!

The cook is hunched over his grill as he quickly moves side to side finishing his orders: eggs, omelets, delightful copy's potatoes. His brother preps the orders: chips veggies, tears up cheese, makes toast, fruit cups, and their several helpers deliver and take orders and fill in wherever needed to make the customers happy.\\n\\nFirst off, the fruit cup: blueberries, kiwi, dragon fruit, fresh figs, cantaloupe, cherries, grapes, pomegranate seeds, grapes, pears, apples, mango, grapefruit, orange, and strawberries.

If this place utterly failed at everything else, they would be a three star restaurant just for the corn dogs. They don't fail at everything though, but I've been three times and the problems seem to come with the service more often than not. \\n\\nFirst lets hit the food. I've had two corn dogs, tater tots, poutine, french fries, a pig mac, a milk shake, tried a few bits of a peanut butter sandwich type thing, and the cowboy nachos. Yes, I've had all that in three trips. Don't judge me. The theme is a bit hard to put your finger on, but essentially its gourmet carnival food with an over the top flair. The poutine is the best in the Atlanta area that I have had bar none. The fries push into special territory. They aren't unique per say, but everything about them is right. Hand cut, deep fried to just done. Throw the graveyard seasoning (its a seasoned salt of some sort) on them and you are good to go. The pig mac is a gourmet take on the big mac. They throw thousand island dressing on there, one patty is a pork patty and the other is a beef patty. Its a very very good burger. The chili on the cowboy nachos is bowl worthy and it has chorizo! \\n\\nThe corn dogs are nothing short of magical. Picture everything you like about a corn dog and then multiply it by 10 in the best way possible. The one that is a combination of every type of dog they have is the best. It is like a mystery bite of deliciousness each type you bit into it. They bring a stone ground mustard that is near perfect to go with the thing. Before this, I had never had a corn dog that I really looked forward to eating. This thing... this thing is trip worthy. This thing is perfect.\\n\\nI'm going to say something I never thought I would say but the peanut butter sandwich thing, while ok, is a bit too over the top. There are three different types of butters on this thing and they seemed to get lost in each other. I love the bacon on it and maybe would add some jelly and cut down on the amount of butter. I'm not sure. I liked it but didn't love it.\\n\\nThen we get to the service. Look, I've heard enough about the milkshakes here to know they have to be good but I only tried one on my last trip. It was flavored milk. Maybe the ice cream didn't have time to solidify. There was apparently a party of 25 that all ordered shakes just before I came in. Perhaps that threw something off. I don't know. The shake was bad. I'm willing to go back to give it another shot.\\n\\n2 out of the 3 times I went there were service issues. The first time was near their first grand opening, but the server got into a bit of a debate about one of our party having sweet tea when he clearly didn't. Our drinks were empty a good bit. I chalked it up to \\"hey they just opened!\\" The second time I went the service was flawless. The 3rd time was my most recent. We got seated pretty quickly and then we sat... and sat... and sat. Then entered our server. His name was Elvis and the place seemed to immediately fix itself. I think six parties were seated and they were all handled by Elvis. Sure, it took a bit but Elvis seemed to untie the knot despite having six parties seated in his section all at the same time. So Elvis seems to be a pretty awesome server. He has a sense of humor too which made the day all the more enjoyable.\\n\\nBottom line: Go here but don't be in a big hurry. Eat an epic corn dog with some poutine. Explore the menu.

Nestled in a little corner behind the swanky Biltmore Hotel and among the towers of Midtown, some of my favorite evenings were spent sat on Cypress Street's amazing patio chatting with a few close friends. It has all the trimmings of a good place to go and just hang out, drink a beer or two (or three), and let whatever crap is on your mind just disappear in a haze of decent bar food and good company. \\n\\nParking is not too bad since there's a parking garage right next door but if you want free parking you might have to circle around Midtown a bit and attempt to decipher the parking laws. \\n\\nThe food is a bit pricey but overall decent quality and the beer selection tends to keep me on my toes. In reality, it's the patio that sells this place for me; a cool crisp autumn evening or a hot summer afternoon the patio seems to adapt for the seasons. During the fall and winter there's usually a fire going and the patrons all don their scarves and hats their conversations covered in a cloud of cigarette smoke and condensed breath in the air. In the summer time mosquito tiki lamps are lit, boys and girls dressed in a minimal amount of clothing legally allowed sucking down a cold crisp IPA. Okay, maybe I'm romanticizing it a bit but half of my love of Cypress comes with the nostalgia factor attributed to my multitude of nights spent with friends having a good time on the patio.\\n\\nThey occasionally do things like a hog roast (which is amazing if you ever get the chance to participate) and it's always a good place to go during St. Patrick's day but all in all it's just a great hang out spot. It's got an incredibly relaxed atmosphere, where there's no particular pressure to be posh, classy, or even polite. It's a chameleon of a restaurant that changes with your particular mood or style which is nice sometimes. The atmosphere is a blank canvas and you make it what you want it to be. It's not rebellious or \\"badass\\" like The Vortex, but it's not quite as foodie and bohemian as The Porter, it's the inbetween. The middle child that (despite us not wanting to admit it) sometimes gets forgotten and overlooked but always does consistently well. It's not AMAZING, it doesn't blow my socks off with their gold flaked Foie Gras pancakes or bone marrow butter ravioli dressed with whale tears but it has a sense of adventure but delivers the usual pub fare without the flair.

No trip here is complete without it. While most other things are very good, the Tomminator is the one thing that I think is AMAZING. I took one friend to Fox Brothers, and upon tasting the Tomminator declared it, \\"genius.\\" It's crispy fried tater tots topped with brunswick stew and cheese. Somehow the tater tots don't get soggy, so you get the amazing blend of textures of crunch tots, melty cheese, and chunky stew. I've been known to eat an entire portion by myself. \\n\\nLOVE the beef rib here. It's unusual to find beef ribs in Georgia, and certainly more unusual to find ribs that are practically Flintstone sized (the 9 inches spans across the plate). I actually overhead someone asking \\"what's that!\\" upon seeing my behemoth rib come out of the kitchen. My only complaint is that it's just so darn expensive. Usually when I order it, it's close to $35. And you can get some mighty fine meals at that price point. \\n\\nThe pork ribs are good, too. They're dry rub (which isn't my personal favorite), and while tender aren't fall-off the bone tender. This is a place that likes chew in their meat. \\n\\nThe pulled pork is solid, and much like the pork in other barbecue places. It has a good smokey flavor (but not too smokey, mind you), and is always tender. \\n\\nSides are more on the \\"meh\\" side. They're perfectly fine, but I wouldn't rave about them. Mac and Cheese tends to be overcooked, and the cheese could be more flavorful and creamy. The Frito Pie sounded amazing, but I never ordered it again. Usually I stick with the brunswick stew so I can pack it up and have it as a snack the following day. \\n\\nThe side salad was unexpectedly nice: the greens were crisp and fresh, much more so than I'd expect from a barbecue joint. \\n\\nI can see why Fox Brothers usually tops ITP lists. It's the best barbecue place I've found inside the perimeter.

Both needed something not salty to be eaten. (would it have killed you to serve it with some Saltines? It's not that hard. Really) We picked at it a bit waiting for our next course but couldn't finish it. I seriously think they should have just gone with the app-main-dessert for the 3 course meal because the olives and pickles aren't really cutting it. Talk about disappointment.\\n\\nAnd man, was the service slow. and I'm not talking about the wait staff. Our server was friendly, attentive and overall great. It was the kitchen staff that we had a beef with. We were sitting at the table closest to the kitchen so we had a full view. You'd think with a dining room full of people, it would be super busy in there, everyone bustling and stovetops full of pans frying and stuff, right? Nope.\\n\\nAfter course 1 (the warm olives and pickles), we sat and waited 25 minutes for our next appetizers to show up. And the whole time we were looking into the kitchen, there was hardly any cooking going on inside. At one point, there was silence. Not a single pan on the stove top. We looked around at all the tables waiting for their food and wondered, 'where the hell did all the chefs/cooks go?' The tix (receipts) were all lined up but no food was being made. Did these people never hear of 'prep'? (FYI I was a prep cook for 2 years. And a line cook for 1. Stuff like this should have been prepared, ready to go)  While we were impatiently waiting, wondering what was going on, we saw the kitchen staff putting items into containers putting labels on things when they should have been sending out plates. \\n\\nWhen Course 2 finally came out after close to half an hour, we both laughed out loud. The Pork Rilettes and Salt Cod were basically warmed up pates, served with bread. REALLY? This took 25 minutes? Flavor wise, pretty good. The cod wasn't too fishy and it was seasoned just right. The pork pate was pretty good too, although visually, it looked very much like a scoop of wet cat food.\\n\\nNow for course 3. The Farrotto (think Risotto but with more texture) and the pork chops came out fairly quickly and tasted fab. My husband didn't like that the pork chops were too lean but I prefer lean meats so we swapped. The Farrotto is better than regular risottos I've had because of the chewiness of the Farro melded well with flavors and it wasn't mushy like a regular risotto. Portions were decent for a French restaurant.\\n\\nI also had the flight of three wines for $12. While the wines were good, three sips for $12 is too expensive in my book. I should have just ordered beer or wine because each flight is served with each course, which meant waiting 25 minutes for the next flight of wine to show up. (seriously, I don't know if it's a ploy to get people ordering more drinks but if it weren't for the prices, I would have had 3-4 glasses of wine by the time we were done with our food\\n)\\nDessert was extra but we skipped because we didn't want to wait too long.\\n\\nLong story short: Appetizers need work. Main dish tasted good, front of house service was good. Prices are kinda high and the kitchen takes FOREVER to get foods out on the table.

My dinner was on December 11, 2015 at 9:45 pm. This disaster started with the rudest hostess ever in any dining experience. We were greeted by her, with at least a \\"Hello\\" and \\"How many?\\" We told her 4 and she got the menus, coloring sheets and kept on walking. My wife and I were like \\"Do we follow her? Guess so\\". So we follow the hostess and see her place the menus on a table and keep on walking and just thought, this must be our table??? Not even a, this is your table or your server will be xyz.\\n\\nSo we sit and wait, and wait until our server Chenequa arrives and gets our order. We did the 2 for $25 and 2 chicken finger orders for the kids. Then we wait and wait again for our drinks. Our salads arrived before the drinks and silverware. When Chenequa noticed, there was no silverware she brought over the drinks and silverware. We ate our salads and then the main courses came out. My wife had the mac and Cheese Chicken and I had the 7oz sirloin (or that's what was claimed).\\n\\nAs soon as I bit into that so call sirloin, I could tell there was no love put into in and it was the worst cut of steak ever! My wife and I are still debating if it was sirloin after all as the taste was just so awful and rubbery. I try another bit and my wife could see it in my face. She asked for a bit which I gave her and I could see the disgust in her face and that was it. Placed my dish to the side and shared the Mac & Cheese with my wife with occasion dips into the kid's plates.   \\n\\nChenequa comes by after a while, sees my plate on the side (which is basically untouched) and takes it. Sees me eating from my wife's plate, I tell her it was horrible and just keeps walking. NOT EVEN a Was something wrong, what was wrong with it, can I get you something else? NOTHING! She didn't even inform a manager as one did not visit the table.  She came by after offering dessert, and I was just NO, way, just bring me the check. Chenequa reply was \\"o, you just pay on the tablet thing\\" which she set up. I paid left a 10% tip which came out to $4.00 (sorry, but I didn't feel bad at all, it's what she worked for), clicked to print my receipt which did not print out on the table, but was just slapped on the side of the table by Chenequa after obviously seeing what I had left.\\n\\nI call the morning after and speak with the manager Matt (if not wrong) and explain all of the above. He apologized for it all, informed he would speak with the staff and offered gift cards to come back as he could not rebate anything off of the check. I simply told him to keep the cards as I would not be using them at all, nor would I sponsor anyone to eat at Applebess ever and that I would be taking my experience higher up. Matt asked me for my phone number and asked if he could call me back after verifying on something which he did. The offer was to come back to the restaurant to get cash for the sirloin portion of the check. \\n\\nApplebees, you can keep it! I only wish I had facebook and twitter, but between your corporate office, google reviews, tripadvisor, yelp and word of mouth, I will make it my personal mission to eliminate any possible stream of revenue for your establishments!

However, you do so many things well and you are so close to my house - you get an AOK in my book. \\n\\nGive me a plate of pork or chicken and I will devour it in short order. Give me a side of that brunswick stew, and some mac and cheese, and I might so steady with you - both are spot on. But then, there is the line. You have to get in there early to miss the crazy line and the wait for food and I just don't want to eat lunch at 11am on a weekday and forget about the weekends. \\n\\nParking is also pretty scarce - again, weekdays before 11:30am and you should be as good as gold. There is plenty of seating inside with some outside tables as well (based on how the line is paced), but you do tend to get chummy with your neighbors - fine by me as that's the way BBQ should be enjoyed, with the neighbors.\\n\\nOverall, it is a good atmosphere and pretty good barbecue.

At the time of payment, I (a female) walked up to the payment station and handed over the bill + my card to our waiter. She returned the bill folder for gratuity and placed it beside my male companion. While the service was pleasant, this waiter's behavior displayed an exaggerated bias to expected gender roles.

This was not really a true sangria. \\n\\nThe plantain empanada was pretty damn good, I would like to have more than one to my order though.\\n\\nThe eggs Benedict , eggs poached perfectly, the hhollandaise sauce was pretty damn flavorful and good.

The menu is extensive and complicated. You can get breakfast anytime, but you can only get eggs on Saturday and Sunday. Shakes start at $10.

We were charged full price. I only saw the sign advertising the happy hour appetizer outside the front door as we were leaving the Eye later. Anyway, the food was OK. Not really worth the money and nothing to write home about. I think they have paid so much out to get celebrity endorsements that they need to charge crazy prices for mediocre food. The place is not really kid friendly, which I found very odd given its location. There is no kids menu, the waiter brought our a drink without a lid for a four year old, but had already brought out water in glasses with lids. I definitely would not bother going back here.
