Based on any given slice or any given whole pie, for that matter, ESP rates four stars in my book. It's the menu and vibe as a whole that nudges me to grant that elusive fifth star.\\n\\nI've always favored traditional, tried-and-true topping combinations on my pies, but here I've embarked on a mission to try all of the specialty pies - they seem to be able to do no wrong in combining ingredients. Cilantro on top of basil pesto? Yep, they harmonize nicely on the Mojo. Six different cheeses on the Moon Tower? Awesome. Jerk Chicken over pesto? Order a Full Nelson and believe it. So far we've ordered pies to go with traditional red sauce, Pesto and White sauces and they've all been fab. That gives me confidence to try their other sauce bases like hummus, black bean, spinach curry and olive oil. Even if they don't wow me there's already more than enough adventure on the menu. And on top of being hometown, they're also homegrown, with all the local ingredient sourcing you could ask for.\\n\\nKids of all ages will enjoy watching them hand-toss dough when they stop by to pick up their order (ESP also delivers - just not far enough north for us). I've had marginally better thin crust but this stuff should be more than close enough to perfection for any tastes outside of the snobbiest New Yorker.

I really do.  But it's like your paraplegic friend trying to cut rug on the dance floor:  it just ain't workin' out.  Let's start off with the bowling balls, shall we?  These things look like fucking spent hand grenades you'd find in a war-scarred battlefield.  I was lucky enough to find the finger holes amid the frankenstein lacerations that covered the balls.  Also, I usually have to steal a ball from another lane in order to bowl with a ball that my fingers will actually fit in.  Luckily, my primitive alpha-male instincts kick right in, so after a brief stare down I'm able to walk away from another lane with my prize.\\nUpon returning to my lane, I'm amazed if we can figure out Data's ship controls in one take in order to start the game.  Why on earth do the bowling controls have, like 4 \\"Enter\\" buttons?  Maybe it's to keep us on our toes.  Maybe it's because user interfaces shouldn't be designed by middle school dropouts.   Anyhow, once the actual bowling starts, I like to play a little game called \\"which one of either our or the adjacent lanes' alley will crap out first.\\"  I play in a Sunday league (ok, so it's more of a Sunday drinkfest) where, last week, the poor team next to us' lane \\"broke down\\" minutes into their game.  Luckily, one of the rock n' roller staff was able to come over and crawl into the 'pit area thing' and fix whatever caused the balls to stop returning.  The problem: it took him about half an hour to do so.  But it's ok, because the team got to enjoy the same blacklights and loud music show that that shitstink Ryan's Family Amusement place below Fenway Park used to put on on the hour, every hour.  I wonder if King's bought the lights when Ryan's went under...\\nAside from the bowling and all kidding aside though, the atmosphere at King's is pretty cool.  The bartenders and staff are pretty attentive.  The arcade games actually work.  The Bud Light doesn't cost an arm and a leg like at Lucky Strike...  They do try.  Just not at the bowling part.

Having enjoyed Sam Fox's WIldflower restaurant in Tucson for years while I lived there in the 90's-2000's made me just trust the quality that came out of his kitchens. I feel like Flower Child, by name and by the health conscious offerings is an homage to what Wildflower used to be in Tucson, but maybe that's just an old fading memory that I try to cling to...\\n\\nIf I tried to list everything I've had here, I would need to just copy and paste the menu, so I'll just pick my top three favorite things - sometimes my go-to items when I can't make up my mind. In no particular order - as they are all great:\\n\\n1. Forbidden Rice Bowl - great by itself, and just as good with beef or chicken.  I prefer beef.\\n2. Avocado Toast - Simple but yummy!\\n3.

I've written about Genoa in the past and how it's one of my favorite restaurants in the city, but I'd imagine that many people would be off put by the price. Fortunately, Accanto and Genoa share both the head chef and a kitchen, so you'll see a lot of similarities between the two (except for the fact that Accanto is 1/10th the price!)\\n\\nTheir menu is ever changing, but they almost always have some sort of hash dish. My favorite thus far (probably the best meal I've had all year, and what is currently on their menu) is the duck hash with Brussels sprouts, squash, harissa cream and poached eggs. The duck is so incredibly flavorful, satiating and buttery that it just practically melts down your throat and goes straight for that fatty spot that you seem to shed from your thighs. It's so so worth it. \\n\\nIn the past, I've had the smoked salmon hash which is also awesome in it's own regard. The smoked salmon was outrageously fresh and had the perfect amount of sweetness and smokyness. It was accompanied by fresh, seasonal summer vegetables to cut through the fattyness and make you feel a little less self-conscious.\\n\\nBe sure to add on one of their biscuits as well! The monster of a biscuit is easily enough for two to split, and while the cherry apple marmalade it is served with is quite good, it's a little bit on the sweet side for me and the biscuit does fine on its own. They even do biscuits and gravy with these damn things, but I don't see how anybody other than Paul Bunyan can order a thing like that.\\n\\n...and, the best part about Accanto? We've been able to have breakfast with 2 entrees, coffee, and a biscuit for under $25.

Overall, they just conceptually missed the mark and the price point is too high for what it is.  Lower the prices and this would be a great casual joint OTP.\\n\\nService:  Parking was easy, and the staff was super friendly!  We were greeted with a smile, and seated immediately (5pm, the place was empty.)  Our server was also great, but the staff is clearly not trained in the details of fine dining.  'We're kind-of a foodie place'.  \\n\\nAmbiance:  Weezer blasting on the loud speaker.  I have nothing against Weezer... for a sports bar.  But definitely not when 3 small pieces of vegetarian ravioli = $14.  Windows dirty.  Everything-trendy decor from 5 years ago.  What's the theme here?  Definitely not farm to table, and very little local fare.  Is it family owned?  Is there a story?  Fine dining?  Oyster bar?  Tapas?  (Our server described it as a tapas bar but there is nothing Spanish about this place!).  Overall it just felt generic.\\n\\nFood:  First course was the ravioli mentioned above.  Ricotta and lemon with local mushrooms and greens, but all I could taste was ricotta and salt.  Not generously stuffed.  Then a roasted corn salad with aioli and lime (about one ear of corn for $8).  Again too salty, and too much aioli, but overall pretty tasty lime and roasty flavor.  The $12 steak tartar was terrible.  Standard ring mold presentation with toast points that were clearly 99 cent special on texas toast from Kroger.  Huge chunks of hard boiled egg, (sad there was no egg yolk!) caperberries with honey, and plain chickpea puree.  Just a weird combination that didn't go together and masked the texture and flavor of the steak tartar!  The grilled Octopus with smoked paprika chickpeas for $14 wasn't quite as bad.  Once we actually mixed up the dressing on the cabbage and preserved lemon salad, it made a little more sense, but overall just bland and the flavors didn't really go together.  The spiced squash saved the meal.  That was delicious.  A smoked cumin yogurt really offset the good amount of heat from the Shitsito pepers, and the squash was seasoned and cooked perfectly.  The most filling of all the courses, and the least expensive.  We asked about the dessert special and the server admitted that it was on special because they were taking it off the regular menu.  We went with the Smores bread pudding with banana ice cream which was pretty good!  We didn't have drinks because we both had to drive a long distance after.  I asked for coffee after the meal and it was never delivered... but hey, that happens sometimes.\\n\\nI'm not one to write a lot of negative reviews, and there was a lot of potential here.  I wouldn't say it was a terrible experience.  I appreciate being fed and waited on, and half the food was tasty and the food that wasn't could be tweaked with minimum effort.  I'm usually willing to give things a second try.  I think they just need to update and focus their concept.  Casual fine dining can work for Buckhead, but stress the \\"fine\\" a lot more for that price point."},{"name":"Caf√© Annie","address":"131 N Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"This was such a sad date night!  Our experience left much to be desired.  First of all, on a Friday night when on vacation, I cruised the yelp deals and found this one for Mediterranean food.  Perfect, because that's what we were craving.  So we walked from Lake Lucerne which was a nice stroll around 6 or 7ish in the evening as we got to take in the pre-madness street party that would happen in a few hours.  We got to the restaurant and were given the choice of sitting in a tiny section of the restaurant, which was a little strange since the restaurant was huge.  There was a large dance floor and stage smack in the middle, and a cafeteria style counter towards the back on the left.  Couples were straggling in and joining a big group in a table next to us that became louder and louder, which was apparently a tango meetup group.  Normally this isn't a huge deal, but they did kind of take over the restaurant.  My husband and I were the only diners there and felt like we were the sole observers watching a tango class unfold right before us on the dance floor.  It was so distracting that we stopped talking to each other and were captivated by the lessons in front of us.  It was humorous in the end, but it would've been nice to be told by staff that we should expect that the restaurant would be transformed into a dance studio, regardless if there were other diners.  The food left a lot to be desired...I had them create a fusion of the falafel and grape leaves plate which came with hummus and tabouleh and they were all pretty bland.  My husband said his kabobs were very ordinary and his rice was heavily salted.  Our waitress was very sweet and kind throughout the evening though, which made the experience ok in the end.  However if we ever come back to downtown Orlando we will stick to the recommendations given to us--to try Ceviche, Hue or Citrus Club."},{"name":"New Taste of India","address":"1901 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place used to be a solid lunch spot for me.

Besides the pizza, I favor the various parms, and the prosciutto/mozzarella/tomato/basil sub.  *drool*  And they do catering.\\n\\nAny place that can afford to only be open from 11-3 has to be amazing."},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"My first visit to Pig Floyd's was the day they opened their doors. I loved the food that day and  happy to say I felt the same way weeks later. \\n\\nThe menu has changed a bit but that is to be expected. I was disappointed that the African chicken sausage and shrimp platter was removed. However I did see some interesting new offerings. At first I was worried because I don't eat pork. However I was quickly reassured that I could substitute chicken on any sandwich. I went with the Mills 50 cheesesteak with chicken and a side of yuca fries. I could go on about how amazing these fries are but you really just need to go try them yourself. The sandwich was packed full of chicken, onions and peppers. Replacing the gooey cheese normally used in a cheesesteak was a pimento cheese spread. Absolutely delicious. \\n\\nThe staff was helpful and was on top of replenishing our waters and clearing the table.

First I had the wildly popular fried fritto misto: I found the calamari a bit tough and the breading a bit overdone-I left a copious amount of the breading on my plate. The waitress, who was very friendly and knowledgable(ditto for the cooks- I sat at the bar and watched stuff bein' cooked, it's where the action is)suggested their French white, which complemented the fritto misto well. Next, on to the Saffron Arancini w/Dungeness crab and ricotta cheese in the center- that was great! The outside of the arancini was cooked to perfection, holding together the creamy center. Also, liked the touch of a little bit of crab and marche for a garnish. The marinara sauce and olive oil rounded out the dish- I had an '07 Punset Dolcetto, which accompanied the dish well. Finishing off my happy hour meal, I had a salumi plate with an carmelized onion-caper relish that was off the hook! Washed it down with a Procecco, and I was done! The Fritto Misto stopped me from giving 5 stars, but my experience here was great: from the friendly staff, the drinks and the food!

Very beautiful and the layout is great.  The driveway and parking lot could use a serious makeover.  Driveway definitely.  Kiss your shocks goodbye.  So a none craft beer enthusiast, I think this place could be a bit intimidating.  The bottle list is 2 pages of 8font typing and the taps they have available are not all Jester King or even from Texas.  That of course is awesome, because it makes the trip more worth the effort. \\n\\nBottles are priced comparable to what you'll pay anywhere else on the market.  There is no discount from buying that the source.  Oh well.  The tap room is great because you can get 4oz tasters for about $2.5-$4, depending on the brew.  You can also see the available chilled bottles they have, which can be opened on the grounds.  \\n\\nThe staff is super nice and welcoming.  That was honestly the thing that stuck out to me most here.  They were willing to talk to you, describe what was going on and answer any questions my group had.  \\n\\nThe environment (literally) is peaceful and there's a lot of cool things to see, like a working chandelier hanging from a tree or metal garden art.  There's plenty of covered seating areas and even more non-covered.  There's also a pizza place on the premises, which we didn't try since we went to Salk Lick first.  People seemed to be eating it a lot and it's wood oven, which is really hard to mess up IMO.\\n\\nJester King is known for sours and dry beers.  Not particularly my type of brew, but they make really good varieties.  We had about 5 different tasters of different farmhouse ales, sours and other uncommon brews.  I like Jester King for breaking the mold and having so much variety available.  Their types of beers just aren't for me.  I enjoyed my experience, but won't be rushing back.\\n\\nI would've like to have gotten a behind the scenes look at their operation, but I'm not sure if they offer that or it just wasn't being offered that day.

In addition \\nthere was a small wedge of orange.

Good tempura batter should be light\\n      crispy and soft, and the batter at this place was heavy,\\n      crispy and hard. In addition, the tempura juice came\\n      with this was too little and it was put in a very small\\n      (2-inch diameter) bowl, which was impossible to dip\\n      the tempura items in it.\\n(iv) Chicken Teriyaki:\\n      Taste-wise its okay. However the chicken pieces \\n      were very thin and it was seriously lacking the \\n      teriyaki sauces. As a result, the chickens were too \\n      dry and there was not enough sauce for the rice\\n      beneath it. The rice was nice mid-grain rice though,\\n      and it is probably California-grown Japanese rice. \\n(v) green salad:\\n      This is the worst of all.

Our server was delightful and very helpful with suggestions for wine and foods. We had heard that the pimento cheese toast and salmon ceviche taco were delish so we started with those small plates and were not disappointed. We had also read great reviews and our server recommended the pappardelle with lamb ragout! It was divine and such a large portion between the two of us that we each took a goodie bag home!! We also enjoyed the brussels sprouts with apple slices immensely. I have hosted private events here and my return as a dinner guest reinforced my opinion that this is a neighborhood restaurant well worth visiting regularly. Ease of parking in the adjacent deck is very convenient and free of charge for Saltyard clientele!

All were good but the Oreo won this one with red velvet at a close 2nd (they could leave the white chocolate shavings off the back though). However I gave 4 stars because the price is outrageous. 5 pieces of cheesecake for almost $50. That's crazy.

So let's start with parking. They're located close to Krog Street Market (but a little off the beaten path of the belt line) which we know parking can be a pain sometimes but street parking is available and a lot is nearby that does valet. The building itself is connected to a few other restaurants, eateries, etc but it's more so a bar set up but plenty of outside seating as well which is ideal for the warmer weather. The service was great from beginning to end. You order as soon as you get in and seat yourself whether it's inside or outside. Their drink prices (although I had the mimosa) was very reasonable and my girls seem to think they were delicious and for their money worth. The food prices are great too being that they off deals with you can combine tacos with dips so it's definitely something for everyone. I even had the pleasure of meeting one of the owners, Dave. He had a great personality and made It his business to check with the customers all while running some drinks at the bar himself. Guacs y Margs definitely has a new customer in me!"},{"name":"Cuon - Vietnamese Street Food","address":"600 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Authentic, tasty Vietnamese food in the heart of downtown Portland!\\n\\nThe portions are huge so you should come with a friend or two so you share and try multiple things or expect to return to try everything.\\n\\nMy sister and I got the vermicelli with grilled pork and crispy pork belly and then the beef pho. Both portions were generous and had a really great flavor.\\n\\nI love that you get to choose two proteins for the vermicelli and that it comes with an egg roll. My sister said the egg roll wasn't anything special but it also wasn't bad.\\n\\nMy only negative comment would be that the noodles in my pho were on the soft, overcooked side. They were a bit mushy and clumped together so I missed that chewy, slightly al dente texture that pho should have. \\n\\nIf I'm ever back in Portland I'd love to try their salad rolls which look amazing!

Now, before you're like \\"yo, Kate, $1.50 for a side of sauce? For real?!\\" you will have to peep the size of the sauce! I was told my one of the hostesses that they make the sauce to order, so they give you a soup sized cup full of sauce. She told me that I could keep it for a while and use it for a meat marinade. Best. Idea! Super tasty and for the amount you get, cheap. I keep it in a mason jar in the fridge. It gets used between the couple months we order. \\n\\nThe noodles aren't anything to write home about, but they definitely satisfy the chow mein cravings. (Get that garlic sauce all up in those noodles too. Trust me.) AND, they have actual hot mustard for the egg rolls and stuff. None of the bland packet crudstard. Oh ya, their egg rolls do have a fried spring wrapper, and a kinda beefy filling. I like them quite a bit but no, not an egg roll wrapper. I dig that because they reheat really well. The crab puffs are decent as well. Definitely what you'd expect out of a crab puff (wonton, cream cheese, a small bit of crab; pinched and fried).\\n\\nIf you want the variety without ordering a million different entree's, this is the place to be.

My friends and I are looking for a place to go celebrate my (utterly unplanned) birthday, and we end up deciding on Kings. Pool tables, arcade games, AND bowling? Can't possibly go wrong with that... right?\\n\\nBy the time we show up the place is already decently crowded, and we're told that getting a lane will take about an hour. We ask about the two empty lanes at the end of the room, and are told that those two are currently waiting to be taken. Ok, no biggie.\\n\\nWe hit up the bar and begin to consume the grossly overpriced beer, but at least they have Harpoon IPA on tap. Good times are being had, but after 65-70 minutes of waiting we all start to get a little impatient. I go back to the bowling desk to ask about our lane only to be told that it's going to be about another 15-20 minutes. I glance over, and notice the same two lanes still nice and empty. \\"Hey, what about one of those two down there?\\", I ask. \\"Nope, those are waiting to be occupied\\", says the girl.\\n\\nFinally after another 15 minutes of waiting, our buzzer goes off. The bitterness begins to sink in when we realize that our lane just so happens to be one of the two near the end. The same two that have been empty since we came in. Oh well, they're just disorganized, we all think. Few laughs later, and we're off to bowling.\\n\\nBarely two squares into our game our lane suddenly and inexplicably shuts down, reset itself, and restarts our game. We decide to roll with it and start over, only to get shut down again shortly after. When I go over to report the issue, the girl tells me that our lane has been malfunctioning all night. I ask why they would give us a clearly broken lane, and she says that we were getting impatient so they had to put us somewhere. Cool.\\n\\nWe get moved a lane over, to the other one that had been empty all night. Lo and behold, this lane is malfunctioning too! What a shocking turn of events!\\n\\nSo off we go, back to the bowling desk. By this point we're all just about done with the place, so when they ask if we want to wait another 15-20 minutes for a new lane we decide to graciously decline and ask for our money back. We are informed at this point that they can't, in fact, refund us our money because of whatever arbitrary \\"policy\\" they decided to make up on the spot. In order to appease our increasing frustration, they offer 6 \\"free game\\" certificates as their final offer -- take it or leave it.\\n\\nFlash forward to last Sunday (03/01/12). We have friends visiting town, and decide that this might be a perfect time to cash in on our 6 bowling games at Kings. Excited about the prospect of drinking and bowling our Sunday night away, we head over. Upon entering we are greeted by the likeliest contender for Biggest Douche in the Universe, whom we'll henceforth refer to as Puka Necklace.\\n\\nPuka Necklace checks my ID, and informs me that he can't let me in because I have a foreign ID. Baffled, I notify him that Puerto Rico is in fact a US territory (even says so on the ID) and that I am both a) 26 years old, and b) a US citizen, not a foreign national. I even show him how my ID is fully scannable, just like any other US ID would be.\\n\\nHe scans my ID once, the little green \\"ok\\" light goes off on his scanner, and he shakes his head. He scans it again, the little green \\"ok\\" light goes off, and he stares blankly down at his scanner. He then looks at me and tells me, again, that he cannot let me in because I have a foreign ID. By this point I begin to get pretty frustrated, mutter something along the lines of \\"this is f**king ridiculous\\", and ask to see a manager.\\n\\nPuka Necklace ponders the proposition for a moment, then blurts out the following in the cockiest, I-am-mister-big-time-doorman manner possible. \\"Tell you what, buddy. If you apologize to me for saying f**k, I'll let you in.\\"\\n\\nI ask him if he's actually serious, to which he nods, I respond with a good laugh and ask for a manager again. At this point Puka Necklace shifts his attention from us long enough to turn away a group of 4 guys waiting to get in based on the fact that one of them was wearing light-colored sneakers. After this blistering exertion of doorman powers, he goes off and comes back with his manager.\\n\\nHis manager, whom we'll refer to as Button Down Shorty (Shorty, for short), tells me that he has to kick me out because I had \\"threatened and gotten aggressive with his doorman\\" (sic). After calmly trying to explain the situation to Shorty only to meet the same response, I decided to commend them on their A+++ customer service and leave the premises never to come back.\\n\\nWe ended up at Lucky Strike that night, where we got to drink and bowl happily without any of the BS."},{"name":"Flower Child","address":"11721 Rock Rose Ave, Ste 120","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"All the food on my plate with fresh.

Located in the basement area that was the old Tannery, the Beat Hotel is an absolutely beautiful space. The decor, artwork, and layout are top notch and will be appreciated for years to come. And the live music will undoubtedly add a really fun and interesting element to the area. Pretty much all the liquor, beers, and wines are American-made. \\n\\nThey opened today and I stopped in for a drink or two. I had a pleasant experience overall; the cocktails were solid and the wines (all on tap!) were interesting. That said, the prices are high. No cocktails under $11.50. No apps under $12. Entrees are well over 20. \\n\\nI don't feel like a drink made with Old Overholt Rye should be $11.50. It's a great \\"cheap\\" rye almost anywhere else, but here it's as pricey as Bulleit is elsewhere.\\n\\nI also sampled some of the wine, and they were quite good. But American wines at $9-14 for a 5oz pour are not worth it to me. They offer 2.5oz pours, too, for about 55% of the 5oz price. Unfortunately, they wont let you taste any of the wines without purchasing them, despite the fact that they are on tap.\\n\\nFinally, I tried the calamari/veggie fritters ($12) on recommendation from the bartender. The batter was pleasant and light, but there was nothing extraordinary about them. That said, I look forward to trying more of the food here.\\n\\nSo here's my breakdown:\\nService: 4 stars -- staff was really great and friendly. Had a small hiccup with my first drink (was served on the rocks when it should have been up), but no big deal.\\nAtmosphere: 5 stars -- this is one of the most beautiful restaurant spots in Harvard, if not the best. And when the music starts, I'm sure it will be next level. \\nFood: 3 stars -- hard for me to really judge on one dish, obviously, but this dish didn't knock my socks off.\\nDrinks: 4 stars -- cocktails were solid, and wine was quite good.\\nValue: 2 stars -- I realize this is Harvard Sq, but I can't see myself coming here regularly when the prices are so high. I'm a firm believer that cocktails with spirits like Overholt should not be more than $10. With multiple options nearby for that, I will lube up elsewhere before coming here for some live music.\\n\\nAverage: 3.5 stars"},{"name":"Shilo Restaurant Portland Airport","address":"11707 NE Airport Way","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Had a great experience, Dee recommended the calamari and fish taco's and both were excellent.

My only issue with this place is that there is an unsafe alley way by the silver water tower looking structure (at the playground area) behind the building. This alley way leads directly to the highway and there is a door/gate mid way down but it is always wide open for a child to walk straight through. If you are not sitting at the ONLY single table that lets you monitor the alleyway, you cannot easily see your child walking back there. This can leave you having to constantly watch your child and not relax as you would aspect to. Playgrounds, for the peace of mind of the parents and for the safety of children, should always have ONLY one entrance/exit so that the parents can easily ensure the safety of their kids.

But honestly, I think they have come a long way.  Each time I have come back, I was more impressed.  I don't update reviews often, but I think this warrants an update.\\n\\nI came back last night with 3 of my friends.  HF Burger was just about crowded, and Hop's wasn't too crowded- I figured let's give it a whirl- and I am glad I did.  I looked over the menu for a few and noticed they had the sandwiches and biscuits.  Having had the biscuits before, I decided to go for a sandwich.  Honestly, I am a bigger fan of boneless chicken over bone-in- what can I say, I am lazy!\\n\\nI got a Tavern sandwich, which is a chicken sandwich with cheddar, bacon, and horseradish sauce.  I ordered it spicy.  I also got a side of mac and a 420 to drink.  Shortly after, they called my name.\\n\\nI also enjoy the choices you have for hot sauce (I didn't realize how serious people were about their hot sauce until I ventured here)- neatly separated in jars by the pickup counter.\\n\\nI went to unwrap my chicken, and it was nice and runny.  Knowing that Linton Hopkins makes this, he uses the same bread as his famous \\"The Burger\\" as he does on the chicken sandwich.  I tell you what, that got me excited.\\n\\nAlso, I am no fan of horseradish, but I decided to trust the flavors on the sandwich.  It gave a nice heat with the spicy chicken, and another dimension of spice with the horseradish.  Along with the bacon and cheese, I think I just found one of my new fav chicken sandwiches in Atlanta.  And to compare it to Chick-fi-a, it is about $1 more for the Hop's version, but the ingredients (especially the bread) have much higher quality.\\n\\nWhen I bit into the mac, I was impressed as well.  I poured a pack of Texas Pete on it and went to town.  It was good.   About 10 minutes later, I got gassy enough to upset people inside PCM (oops).  I call that a score.\\n\\nSo yea, I would like to say this place has come a long way, and I am glad to see after 2+ years, it is still open.  I need to come here more often and see what other goodies they have to offer- ie their pies and such!"},{"name":"Maki Maki","address":"40 Cummings Park","city":"Woburn","stars":"3","text":"Excellent restaurant, this place is my go-to for Asian food!

Around half an hour later, they come and bring us a couple of drinks on the house with our licenses, telling us that they called and ran our ids, and everything was ok. That would have been great and fine, but when our actual drinks that we had originally ordered finally showed up, the bartender spilled some on Mark, and then proceeded to tell him, \\"Oh, everything's okay, just a little spill.\\" No apology or anything, on top of the terrible service from them already. Super condescending when I ask him, as nicely as I could under the circumstances, do you guys have a blacklight or something so you don't run into this problem in the future?

There was a good amount of people gathered outside when we arrived, always a good sign for a place to be busy on a Friday at 11:30am. We ended up waiting about 25 minutes to get seats at the counter. The hostess was very warm and even recommended a lunch spot for a group that couldn't wait to be seated. She was truly a delight. \\n\\nWe were seated at the counter and our server/the bartender was very attentive and overall fantastic. The service was great, but we were totally blown away by the food. We started with Erin's sweet biscuits with a warm blueberry compote. You really must order these! We got a plate of four quarter sized homemade biscuits with delicious blueberries and a vanilla whipped topping. OMG! My husband and I took a bite and looked at each other, we both had that look in our eye, it was on. We fought for each tiny morsel. We also tried the Chocolate Potato Doughnut with cr√®me anglaise, another delicious dish. A small chocolate doughnut with a moist center and a hard crust swimming in cr√®me anglaise, so good. I had the potatoes bravas as well, which were served in a cast iron skillet with two eggs over easy and one of the best aioli's I have ever tasted. The potatoes had a weird red sauce on them, which was a bit spicy and just really interesting, but they also remained crispy. We also had the special of the day, a steak sandwich with a horseradish sauce, fried onions, and red peppers. I saw it coming from the kitchen and thought it was the burger, so I commented on how good it looked. I can't begin to describe the joy I felt when it was placed in front of me. It was heaven on a bun. The steak was so tender and everything worked perfectly together. I kept stealing it from my husband and inhaling it. We had such a phenomenal meal and I literally wanted to try everything on the menu, but alas we were stuffed.\\n\\nMy advice?

Imagine my surprise when there was no juice at all and no flavor.  You couldn't even taste the onions and garlic past the burger and the bun.

I think that anyone or anything that has a distinct and consistent personality can't help being loved by many and bothered by others.  When you get to know the ever present and ever caring owner, Martin, you will understand.  4580 has a friendly neighborhood restaurant feel, but with an innovative, upscale mediterranean-influenced menu.  At any moment during your meal, Martin might invite himself into your world, to check how things are going, or simply to chat, or perhaps to discuss the wines (you can learn a lot from this man).  You have to like this up close and personal atmosphere if you are to like 4580.  I wouldn't have it any other way.  The menu choices are sometimes challenging--all good and all with a unique twist.  The servers are knowledgable and accommodating, ready to recommend, explain and even modify choices without even a blink.  The tables are a little close to each other, so that at busy times things can be a bit noisy, but I feel that this adds to the charm.

Medium loud music sounded like Boney M of 1978 vintage. Friday evening at 6:30pm it was almost empty, but every table was full by 8pm. \\nService: excellent. Two waitresses were friendly and attentive, all questions were answered without making us feel undeserving, bread basket and roasted pepper spread were promptly refilled.\\nFor two adults, a teen and a well eating nine-year old we ordered a soup, five appetizers and two entrees, several teas, coffee and a desert, it came to about $100.  One entree and one appetizer we should have skipped. Upfront I must say that no dish was a miss, each one could be recommended without hesitation. Scores reflect more of a personal preference.\\nComplementary: warm home-made bread with amazing roasted red pepper dip. Dangerously seductive. 9/10\\nPaca Soup: excellent and very meaty lamb soup, softened by yogurt, and with a garlicky kick. Lamb pieces were soft and properly falling apart. It had more broth then solids, which we remedied by dipping bread in it. Excellent choice while the freezing rain was falling outside.  8/10\\nCaban Salad: (pronounced \\"ch-ah-ban\\"). Two of these came with the entrees. Simple but effective diced veggie salad. Tasty but  probably the simplest dish on the menu. 7/10\\nImam bayildi: stuffed and baked baby eggplants.  8/10.\\nMucver: Fried tempura/latke like concoction made from finely chopped zucchini with feta. Unusual, sinful and delicious. 9/10\\nSigara Borek: salty \\"cigars\\" of hard fried dough with salty feta filling. We liked them, but not as much as Mucver. 7/10\\nDolma: familiar grape leaves. Very well made, a safe choice. 8/10\\nPatlican salad: somewhat similar to baba ganoush, mild and delicious mass of mushed grilled eggplant with spices  and yogurt. We loved it. 10/10\\nIstim kebab: wonderful lamb meat falling from shank bone, wrapped in a thin slice of  baked eggplant. Despite being pretty full by the time we got it, we could not resist it. My kids finished this dish by sucking the marrow out of the bone. Inappropriate, but felt completely natural in the comfy kitchen-like environment. 10/10\\nBeyti kebab: ground lamb balls wrapped in thin crepe-like bread with mildly spicy tomato sauce. Very effective, not overly fatty or salty as is often the case. 8/10.\\nDesert: they were out of baklava, but home made pistachio paste wrapped in honeyed dough was amazing. Not overwhelmingly sweet, but nutty, crunchy and delicious.  A portion is two pieces, we split them between everyone.\\nTea: they brew it afresh. It is quite tannic, designed to be sweetened. If you drink your tea without sugar ask to brew it \\"mild\\".\\nTurkish coffee: classic extra strong sweet cardamon spiced concoction. A must if you want that authentic experience.\\nOverall: universally excellent cooking and service, comfy home like environment, mixture of familiar and adventurous mediterranean dishes make it a great family destination.

The burgers all having local names is such a nice touch. At first I was unsure which burger to get because they all looked so good, and then my eyes went to the Jollyville Burger. The description sounded interesting, and I live there so why not try that one?\\n\\nHoly crap it is SO GOOD. I get mine without egg, but otherwise order as-is. The French toast bread works. I don't know how, but it does. And the bacon is perfect, super crispy and not too thinly-sliced. You can tell this isn't the kind of bacon you throw in the microwave. The French toast is so, so good. Like, I would eat an order of their French toast. The burger itself is perfectly seasoned and cooked. It's never dry or bland, nor is it creepily raw or overseasoned. I like my burgers with a little pink to them and that's exactly what they do.\\n\\nTheir fries are amazing, too. I get the regular fries and they're addictive. They're seasoned just right and nice and crispy. I love fries and I rarely meet a fry I don't like, but anyone I've brought here agrees there's something about their fries, these are special.\\n\\nThe prices are amazing, too. Especially for Austin, you'd expect to pay maybe like $15 per burger or something. Nope! The burgers are reasonably priced at just a smidge more than fast food, they're all like $8-9 and include the fries.

We brushed off the slight rudeness and apologized for not noticing the queue and walked over to the back of the line to wait our turn. After a few short minutes we found ourselves walking inside with only a handful of guests before us waiting to order their lunch. The restaurant itself was clean and very vibrant and colorful. What stood out to me the most and found kind of disturbing was a life size picture of Guy Fieri holding a  live chicken. A couple of minutes went by and I was able to place my order and pay for it. We got our drinks from the self-service soda machine and looked for a table. It just started to feel like fall in Florida so we grabbed a table outside to enjoy the beautiful weather. After another five minutes going by, a staff member brought over my order and took my pager and left, never asking if we needed anything else.\\n\\nI started my lunch with \\"The CG Classic\\", a sandwich with two chicken tenders, lettuce, tomato, cheddar, and special sauce (essentially Big Mac sauce). I took a bite of my sandwich and it automatically started dripping right onto my tray. I was quite pleased with the taste, but thought it was frustrating that it was made of two chicken tenders instead of a chicken patty since it was making the sandwich a little difficult to eat and get a good hold on it.\\n\\nWith the sandwich came with a side of fries and a fountain beverage. I saw on the menu that they offered Gold Peak sweet tea and was super excited since it's one of my favorite brands but was super disappointed when I saw on the soda machine that they were serving Fuze sweet tea instead. My friend pointed out that not only is it false advertisement, but a guest can be allergic to an ingredient in Fuze and drink it thinking it was Gold Peak sweet tea, causing an allergic reaction. The side of fries I was served was heavily seasoned to the point where they were too salty to enjoy. After a few bites, I noticed a strand of blonde hair in my side of fries. I work in the restaurant industry, so I wasn't disgusted by it, just inconvenienced. I got up and handed it to the manager on duty, Moe, and he said, \\"That's not cool\\", walked away without saying anything else, and threw them in the trash. He didn't apologize or even try to offer me a new side of fries. The lack of professionalism was the part that shocked me considering this restaurant is on Disney property and they are so big on customer service.\\n\\nAside from the overly seasoned \\"Chicken Guy fries\\", I ordered a side of the \\"Mac Daddy Mac 'n' Cheese\\" since it's one of my favorite foods of all time. Although the side was macaroni and cheese was decently portioned, it was incredibly bland in taste. I'm not sure what their cheese sauce is made of, but it tasted like burnt American cheese that was left in the microwave for thirty seconds too long. I had a couple of bites and tapped out since I was full and honestly didn't like the mac and cheese.\\n\\nIn the end, I can honestly say that I was very underwhelmed with the Chicken Guy and don't think it lived up to the propaganda and excitement. Despite the short wait time and the wide selection of sauces that were actually quite tasty, the subpar, bland food and inattentive service given by young, rude staff members earn this place a rightful 2 out of 5 stars in my book. I don't think I'll find myself revisiting the Chicken Guy. Quite honestly, Chick-Fil-A has a chicken sandwich that can run circles around this joint.\\n\\nGuy Fieri always talks about a place he so pridefully invented called Flavortown, where he takes those iconic food items and moments and gives them a home.

The Caesar salad was better, and could have used some Parmesan cheese in my book. \\n\\nOrdered a Cowboy Ribeye and a Prime Rib, both were okay - not the most flavorful or tender cuts, but solidly in the mediocre camp. We did try the steak sauce and it was possibly the highlight of the meal. Reminded me of Peter Luger steak sauce.

They officially open the new dining room on March 30th and you should be sure to go. \\n\\nMy worry is that Union Square cannot support another restaurant of this size and that the place will usually sit empty, and that would be a terrible thing to happen since their food is so good, so cheap and so convenient.  \\n\\nSo if you're ever unsure what to have for dinner and you live in the area, you should check it out.  You'll be doing your good deed for the day.\\n\\nADDENDUM in response to some of the criticisms about the food:  No, it is not like five star quality when you're discussing great mexican food, but in comparison to punjabi dhabi, or anna's taqueria, or another night at S&S, this place is great. In other words, if you live nearby, it's the perfect option, but if you live in Jamaica Plain, you probably wouldn't want to make the trip - today at least.

Unfortunately, the entire experience was disappointing and off-putting. I truly don't understand what all they hype is about. I felt as if I had just spent over $200 to attend a banquet where I didn't know anyone.\\nI have never been to a restaurant where I have had less choices. When to eat, where to sit, who to sit with, what to eat, at what pace I could eat, how much I wanted to spend. The lack of choices felt supremely arrogant to us - especially considering how much money we spent. I do not feel there is much of a true restaurant experience when all the kitchen is doing is plating everyone's food at the same time (banquet-style). \\nOn a Saturday night, Pomeroy wasn't there - staff mentioned something about her working on the new location. At 11pm on a Saturday night? \\nAnd does the fact that they don't list the cost of the meal anywhere - website or the actual menu in the restaurant - bother anyone else? Who doesn't put the price on the menu? Again, another very arrogant approach. Obviously, you are meant to not care either because you can afford it (we saved for months to be able to go) or because you are so privileged to get a reservation that it doesn't matter. \\nThe lack of choices and the arrogance influencing the whole set-up might have been tolerable had the food shined. Instead, we had good food but not amazing. I felt that we could have had dishes of similar character and quality at a number of restaurants in Portland. They might have been more unique 4 years ago but Portland is lucky to now have so many great restaurants doing very similar food. The salad course (endive, radicchio, curry vinaigrette = ick) was not good at all and no one around us ate this course. \\nThe wine pairing was also a let-down. I take wine pairings very seriously and always look forward to how, when done correctly, the pairing elevates both the food and the wine. The only course that we feel was paired to mutual benefit was the cheese course. \\nWhile we were waiting for our seating - we were allowed in after 9:10pm for our 8:45pm seating - we had a drink at Cocotte and at the end of it all wished we had stayed there for dinner."},{"name":"Papa Murphy's","address":"2534 Maguire Rd","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4","text":"On busy days I like to drop by Papa Murphy's and pick up a pizza for a quick and easy dinner.

The menu is simple, with most dishes incorporating fried chicken tenders, but there is plenty of customization available in the form of different sauces. Most meals come with two sauces, with extra sauce available for 49 cents a cup. We tried the chicken tenders, mac & cheese, and fries. We also tried the garlic parmesan, spicy chipotle ranch, avocado crema, and donkey sauce with our meal! All of the sauces were absolutely delicious, and the chicken was cooked and seasoned to perfection - hands down, some of the best chicken strips I've ever eaten! However, my biggest complaint about Chicken Guy comes from the meager portion of the sauces provided with each meal. While the chicken here is great, even without sauce, it is substantially less interesting without it. In fact, I assume most people will tear through their complimentary sauce fairly quickly if ordering more than 3 tenders. That said, this can be, of course, be remedied by ordering extra sauce. Also, the mac and cheese here is absolutely to die for - creamy and melty with the perfect amount of kick. We highly enjoyed our meal at Chicken Guy, and we will be returning, either to here or to DLX Burger, next time we're in Disney Springs!"},{"name":"Cask & Larder","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Really good restaurant in the Southern style with craft beers brewed on site.

The place itself has really cool vibes. Rustic. The outdoor sitting area is pretty with those twinkle lights above. The inside is standard dinner/cafe with wooden tables. You order upon coming in and take a number to your seat where they will bring the food out to you. They need to have better descriptions of their items. For example their sauces hace no description but the name doesn't imply what it is either. How am I to know?! It was kind of busy and since you order upon entering I felt very rushed in my order. I got the meat combo with brisket and pulled pork. It was ok, nothing mind blowing. They serve the fried Yuca without a sauce or oil. Yuca is VERY dry that is why traditionally you serve it with a garlic Olive oil. Thankfully my husband had ordered the chimichurri and that did the job.

Our waiter was witty and helpful without being overbearing. When my friends, with eyes bigger than their stomachs, told him we were thinking about ordering the whole menu, he playfully obliged. He said \\"everything was great\\" (he lied), but picked out a few of his favorite must-tries. He also managed to snag us the second-to-last Ramen special. Plates are brought Uchi-style, in a specially crafted sequence, with detailed explanations.\\n\\nTwo immediate comparisons came to mind: the amazing new Underbelly in Houston, and the big bold Girl & the Goat in Chicago. Like both places, Swift's Attic's menu is small plate, table sharing friendly. The menu and ambiance falls somewhere in between Underbelly's rustic and earthy versus Girl & The Goat's glitzy and bold.\\n\\nBefore I go into detail about the dishes, I'll lay it right out: almost exactly like Girl & The Goat, Swift's Attic is way, WAY too generous with the salt. It may have been our fault from ordering almost exclusively from the right side of the menu (the \\"heavier\\" side, per our waiter), but when in doubt, chef Mat Clouser is more than willing to go heavy-handed with his NaCl. My dining associate, a fanatic about Uchi, made the astute comment that at Uchi, all the dishes are chi-ly perfectly balanced. Suffice to say, we did not feel this way about Swift's Attic.\\n\\nThe ramen special was my personal favorite, though it's ramen in name only. Flavor-wise, it tasted much more like Taiwanese niu rou mian than Japanese ramen. The heavy oxtail influence and thick broth contributed to much more of a beef than pork flavor. I loved the thick noodles, which, likewise, skew to the former Asian-based soup. The ramen was one of the \\"heaviest\\" dishes of the night, but luckily was brought early.\\n\\nThe twice-cooked duck wings on their own were downright incredible, as was the venison kabab. Yet the sides, while similarly themed, felt disjointed from the dish in taste. Is that an acceptable Chopped phrase? I'm not sure how else to describe it.\\n\\nI was a fan of the oxtail flatbread after I scraped off the blue cheese. In keeping with the oversalted, we all felt that this dish could have used an acidic or refreshing influence rather than another huge wallop of savory.\\n\\nI didn't fancy the the pork cheeks, but both my fellow diners starred this as their favorite. They cited the refreshing jam and biting mustard as very helpful. In retrospect, the oxtail flatbread, pork cheeks, and banh minis are superfluous. Order one, not three.\\n\\nSame with the quail and duck wings, both of which serve the same function.\\n\\nI loved the Swiftine tater tots, perfectly fried bites of crispy, potato-filled goodness. But the ham hocks were over-the-top salty and unnecessary, and the cheese-gravy duo that turns ordinary potatoes into mouth-watering poutine was almost non-existent.\\n\\nBookending our meal were the shishitos and the octopus. I preferred my first shishito experience at Bar Congress, while I think the octopus was good, but with one heavy dish too many, I couldn't properly enjoy it. We were way too stuffed for dessert.\\n\\nDrink menu was stout. Specialty cocktails were $10 and skewed girly, but I liked my cheeky-named Prince Edward's Ass. The beer menu is underrated, but I'm happy I didn't get too many to further bloat the stomach.\\n\\nOverall, I vacillated between 3 and 4 stars, but I'm generally generous, so 4 stars it is."},{"name":"Brighton House of Pizza","address":"218 Market St","city":"Brighton","stars":"3","text":"Ordered through Grubhub.

I'm sure this was not Yaggers' approach when moving into the space formerly known as Migz, so do not judge Yaggers by what was here previously. They are not the same. (And Migz was just a half-assed attempt at being Fatzos if we're playing that game.) \\n\\nNo matter what, Yaggers will always make an effort to right something if it doesn't meet expectation.

I appreciate his response and effort, so I'm increasing the rating to 3 stars. I'll update again if I have a better experience on my return.\\n\\nOriginal review:\\n\\nI grew up in central Florida and started eating regularly (almost weekly) at the Lake Buena Vista location back in high school (circa 1990). Though I moved away a few years later, I've always made a point to eat at Uno whenever I'm at home (which is at least once a year). Since I don't have an Uno anywhere near where I currently live, I look forward to that one special meal as much as I look forward to anything when going home (even Mom's home cooking). For more than 25 years now, it's always been a pleasant experience that made me anticipate my next return ... until my last visit. On 10/23/18, I took a work colleague there while in town for a convention. I ordered the same thing the exact same way I've ordered it since 1990: \\"A Chicago Classic without the powdered cheese on top ... hold the parmesan or Romano or whatever it is.\\" That order has always yielded a perfect pizza. This time, our server, Kelly, brought out a pizza covered in parmesan or Romano or whatever it is. When I reminded her that I ordered it without that, she first claimed I didn't (there's zero chance of that, but even if I had, contradicting the customer like that isn't a great approach). Then she just suggested I try it and let her know if it wasn't okay, to which I emphatically replied that I cannot and will not eat parmesan or Romano. She stood there like she wasn't sure what I wanted, so I let her know they'd need to cook a new one. She came back in no fewer than five minutes with a \\"new\\" pizza. When I expressed how shocking it was they could cook a whole new pizza that fast, she claimed another one had just come out, so they grabbed it before putting on the parmesan or Romano or whatever it is and gave my pizza to another party. I was happy with that solution ... until my first bite. The pizza was full of parmesan or Romano or whatever. After closer inspection, my best guess is that they scraped off as much as they could from my original pizza and recoated it with sauce. But every inch of the pizza under the sauce was covered with the sprinkled parmesan or Romano or whatever it is. I couldn't eat it (and my gag reflex to those types of cheeses almost caused me to make a mess on the table and/or floor). When she came by later and asked how it was, I flatly told her I couldn't eat it ... you know ... due to all the parmesan or Romano or whatever it is. She stared blankly and walked away. No apology. No excuse for trying to get away with that little stunt of hers. No attempt to rectify. So, I basically paid $35 for a soda and a pizza I couldn't eat. Needless to say, that left quite a bad taste in my mouth (both literally and metaphorically). I'm highly disappointed in what was once one of my favorite restaurants."},{"name":"Kolbeh cafe","address":"65 Atlantic Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I was extremely impressed at the quality of the food here.

Will be back often."},{"name":"Chicken Guy!","address":"1506 E Buena Vista Dr, Ste A","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"Let me start by saying I've been so excited to try this place. I mean for a year I've followed them on ig and drooled over every picture posted. I'm finally in town for work and my first stop straight from the airport is Chicken Guy! I even skipped breakfast! \\n\\nIt's located in the Disney Springs area but no worries FREE parking or at least it was at 2pm on a Wednesday. Huge parking garage and it's tucked away on the side of Planet Hollywood. I'm in town alone and still wanted to eat here, even if it's solo! From the Orange parking garage it's less than a 3 minute walk. \\n\\nOnce in the shopping area I quickly determine where it was based on the map at the Directory booth. They have several tables outside, but not all are covered with an umbrella. The ones without weren't being used. There is minimal seating inside. I ended up sitting with a father and child at a table for 4 as it was pretty busy. You get in line and order from the cashier, they give you a buzzer, you get your drink, and take a seat. The food runner will come and slam the tray on the table without any \\"enjoy\\" or \\"here you are.\\" \\n\\nThere are a large choice of sauces and even though I asked for a specific one and the cashier said sure. When the food came it was missing from the tray and when I checked the receipt she never charged for it... annoying! I felt like the staff could have been more welcoming or aware of the Customers instead of each other. Like I mentioned above when she brought the food she just slammed the tray down and walked away. I wasn't the only one that she did that too either. When I was leaving there were 2-3 employees standing right by the door and no one said have great day or thanks for coming or any acknowledgment that I was leaving and that I chose to eat there instead of the other numerous choices. \\n\\nNow the food... unfortunately this was the biggest let down. I got the Big Bite B.L.A.T. It was overrun with lettuce. The avocado spread was all on the first half of the sandwich and I didn't even see or taste any ranch until the last few bites. Instead of laying the 2 chicken tenders side by side they stacked them causing the bun to tear halfway through eating and using a fork I scraped off all the excess lettuce. The fried pickles were like they had been fried and then put in a container and then served so almost like soggy breading from the condensation of being hot and then being put somewhere prior to being served. Honestly the best thing was the French fries. The seasoning was good. They give you 1 packet of ketchup, maybe if I had asked I could have gotten more. Since my Parmesan Garlic sauce didn't make the order I dipped it in the ranch that came with the pickles and it was okay. The ranch is heavily seasoned with dill. Not really my kind of a ranch dressing, but to each their own. I tray is a metal pan with a paper bottom. The inside of my tray had a sauce that wasn't on any of my food smeared on the side, gross. I would hope that they clean the trays between customers, but it doesn't appear that way. \\n\\nI'm glad I finally tried it so I can quit telling my friends about it. I wouldn't recommend to anyone coming into town that it's a must try. Maybe if you're in the area and looking for a reasonably priced meal, but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way. I'm quite shocked because I've been to numerous Triple D joints and most of them have lived up to the hype... maybe Guy should stick to his show."},{"name":"Chicken Guy!","address":"1506 E Buena Vista Dr, Ste A","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"So glad my boyfriend spotted this place in downtown Disney!

Here's what I will say: My boyfriend is Korean and difficult to please when it comes to Korean food. There aren't a ton of Korean BBQ places around that aren't in the city, so we decided to give this place a shot due to a great deal with a groupon.\\n\\nFirst off, I do think that the prices are a bit high considering it's location and what you get, but even though we had a groupon I would go back and pay full price in the future.\\n\\nOur waiter was incredibly nice as was the hostess who sat us. My boyfriend noticed immediately that everyone working there was Chinese, which we found amusing more than anything else. Regardless, we were given the classic Miso soup and ginger dressing salad served to us while we waited for our food. Both were basic/as expected, but fresh and good-tasting. We received 6 banchan which were also pretty standard. I am used to korean restaurants giving small amounts of banchan, but this did seem a little on the small side in terms of serving sizes. We're both huge fans of kimchi, especially along with the BBQ meats, so it would have been nice to have a little extra Kimchi. In terms of flavor, it was standard Kimchi. Not homemade like my omonim's, but not awful-tasting by any means.\\n\\nWe ordered the skirt steak and the spicy pork. It arrived pretty quickly along with our bowls of rice, a platter of various veggies, shrimp (which comes with the order), and a basket of fresh lettuce for wraps. Yes, the other reviewer is right that they put wax paper on the grill to keep it from sticking and I'm assuming for easy cleanup, but honestly neither my boyfriend or myself had a major issue with it. The food still tasted excellent. The beef and pork were both marinated perfectly and the spicy pork was especially good! We stuffed our faces and still had tons of food left over to take home with us.\\n\\nThe staff was incredibly kind and came over regularly to check on us and also made sure we knew how to make lettuce wraps, which was cute. Was it the best Korean BBQ we've ever had in our lives? Not even close. But it was definitely a delicious meal and we both left full and satisfied.

Luckily, it's a fast-moving line. And there's a separate line for to-go orders, so that speeds things up as well.\\n\\nThe Texas Destroyer was my sandwich of choice this time around, with incredibly tender brisket topped with an onion ring, cheese and jalepe√±o slices.  The fried okra was crispy and hot -- right out of the fryer hot. The baked beans are intensely flavored and barbecue-y. This makes for a huge meal, and I couldn't even finish the beans (I took them home, you can't let them go to waste!).  You can get just one side, but it's only about an extra 20 cents to get the second side, so you might as well.  My suggestion, if you're with one other person and you each get a sandwich, one person can get the 2 sides and then split them with the other.\\n\\nEven though it's a counter service restaurant, they still have a bunch of employees walking around, making sure everything is good with your meal and offering to get you anything you might need. It's a nice touch.\\n\\nThere will be poor reviews. Those reviews will often consist of something like the following: \\"Orlando doesn't know what good BBQ is. I've been to [ place with good BBQ ] and I know what good BBQ is, and this isn't it.\\"\\n\\nLook, I've also been guilty of looking back through the rose-tinted glasses of my memory, fondly recalling some spectacular meal that, if I were to consider it objectively, might not hold up quite as well as I remember.  Get the best pizza maker in NYC to fly to Orlando and give him all the exact same ingredients. He'll make a pizza and everyone that has ever been to NYC will claim that the Orlando pizza isn't nearly as good.

I noticed they had a Scoutmob for 50% off (max $10 discount) and we both wanted pizza and to watch the game, so seemed like a good fit!\\n\\nWe got the last space in the parking lot, which I might add, several of the other patrons parked very creatively in this tiny lot.  Even though I got the last space, there could have been two more had the other peeps parked straight.  \\n\\nWe walked in and noticed two things immediately:  (1) the heat and (2) ohemgeeeeee, the childrens.  Lucky for us, almost all the children left while we were placing our order, but it was so crazy in there when we first stepped in the door, we almost turned on our heels and made a beeline for Kaleidiscope.  We stuck it out and decided to sit at the bar and avoid the chaos.  \\n\\nBecause we had the Scoutmob, I took the liberty of ordering a few things:  the mozz knots, greek salad, and medium supreme pizza.  I should note that the menu is just pizza, salads, and pastas.  This is definitely not the place to come if you're trying to go low carb!  When placing our order, we asked about beer on draft and received the lackluster list of bud light, yuengling, and fat tire.  Bottles didn't fare better.  In good news, I found out that you can BYOB here so definitely feel free.  At least the price tag for a draft bud light isn't so bad - $2.75/glass.\\n\\nWe sat at the bar and had a good view of 3 TVs all featuring the game.  Lucky for us too, there was a wide open window.  I noticed later that the thermostat read 84 degrees.  No wonder it was so friggin' hot in there!  Mercy!  (and note, it was 55 degrees outside, so not cold at all).  The window gave us nice relief from the heat.\\n\\nWe both got our draft beers and I got a water, which interestingly came without ice, which is fine by me, but others might find this odd.  Our salad came out after a bit.  I thought we had ordered the half, but we wound up with the full, which was MASSIVE.  I really enjoyed the greek dressing and I'm glad we requested spinach as the salad base.  I think the peeps here really love olives as the salad was covered in them.  It was pretty good.\\n\\nNext up were the mozz knots, which were HEAVENLY.  I'd definitely order these again!  In fact, an order of mozz knots and a salad would be a perfect meal.  The dough of the knots is really tasty, and made all the more better with the melty cheese on top.  It would be fab if they offered the option to get pepperoni or italian sausage crumbled on top - YUM!  The only odd/off-putting thing about the mozz knots is that they were served in a foil pie pan, which was hothothot.  It also made it super tricky to get the extra cheese off the bottom of the pan - I kept thinking my fork would shoot straight through the pan!  Maybe a Le Creuset pan?  Or an oven-safe plate?  Something a little more sturdy for these yummy guys!  \\n\\nThe pizza came last and I must say, the medium is HUGE.  The crust is thin and for me, I really liked the meatball topping that came as part of the supreme pizza.  Was it the best pizza I've ever had?  No, but it wasn't bad.  And with a $17 price tag, I was hoping for something better than \\"its fine\\" pizza.  I also think the same olive lover made my pizza, as our supreme pizza was mostly olives.  As someone who usually orders a supreme sans olives, this was disappointing.  Next time I would get this pizza without olives, fo sho.\\n\\nSlices are offered all day and are definitely the most economical way around the menu.  I asked the three regulars at the bar if the slices tasted fresh and they said yes.  Just FYI, because I thought they might only offer slices at certain times per day...\\n\\nAt the end of the day, I'm thinking I'm not the clientele Slice of Brookhaven is aiming to please.  Between the extreme heat, the \\"kids are fun!\\" message on the chalkboard menu, the mega lack of interesting beer options, and the fairly okay pizza, I get the feeling that Slice of Brookhaven is another great neighborhood option for families who wanted another option than the mexican food at Verde.  If I return, it will be after 8:00pm, with a bottle of wine in hand, ready to tuck into mozz knots and a delicious salad!\\n\\nI should also mention that service was very friendly and made the experience pleasant, even with limited staff.  I also liked the super cute touch of using the neighborhood's street names as the \\"numbers\\" for the table.  I couldn't find a website for Slice of Brookhaven, so I took pictures of the menu and of our food items so you can see how things price out.  The kids menu looks like a pretty good value!

The rolls at Aji are nice and tight, not saturated and coated in excess rice but packed with flavour and goodies (look that those rolls, don't tell me they dont look appetizing). They will use the while perfect avocado for you or pack in the salmon. Honestly, you are worth it so definitely give it a try. The special rolls were perfectly savoury, so I can't wait to go back and order more. You'd think at these prices the fish would be Samurai level but honestly, as a person who's taken food grade leveling classes, it was better.

I finally did and I enjoyed our visit. \\nThis BBQ spot is off of Mills near 50/downtown. It is a stand alone building and I will warn you the parking is limited based on how popular this place is. \\nThe inside seating is not expansive and was pretty full when we arrived around 7pm. There was a line for ordering and there were several items sold out for the day (plantains, street corn, Mongolian brisket). On the wall they post pictures of their menu numbers and they use a roll of brown butcher paper to list daily specials. \\nWe ordered a variety of items since it was our first visit and we wanted to cover our BBQ bases. One of the unique non-traditional BBQ joint things Floyd's does is throw in some Spanish and Asian flair to their menu offerings with things like tacos, black beans and rice and bento boxes. \\nOne of their specials during our visit was pork empanadas. We all agreed this was one of the best things we had. The crust was flaky, the pork was juicy and the sweet and spicy dipping sauce was great. \\nAnother special was a Greek taco with brisket, tzatziki sauce, cotija cheese, greens and pickled onions. It was like a cross between a gyro and bbq taco. It was tasty and I'd order it again. \\nI ordered the two meat combo with black beans and rice. The pulled pork was good, but the brisket was better.

Along with the empanadas they were some of the highlights of what we ordered. They were amazing. \\nWe also sampled a couple other tacos. We ordered the butter chicken taco and the pork al pastor taco. The pork seemed better than the chicken to me.

It was more on the sweet side than the spicy side. It seemed a little more like something from Hickory Farms than bbq sausage.

On top of my burrito unraveling mid way through for the second time here, I was interrupted in the midst of trying to salvage the poorly wrapped slop of burrito in my hand by the manager. He asked me how I have been \\"redeeming\\" points and where. Now I've only been to this location twice now and just because on my second visit I have a free meal doesn't mean this is my legitimate second time ever at a Moe's. He then continued to ask me what other locations I have \\"redeemed\\" at and assuming that meant getting points for buying food I told him, \\"every Moe's I go to,\\" because of course I want points and more Moe's. Anyways, when he left me alone about it finally and realized I'm not a hacker thief I decided to download Yelp solely for the reason to leave this review.

There seemed to be so many options, so we turned to Yelp for guidance.   We stood on the corner in front of this restaurant as we Yelped.  Seeing the mixed ratings from the past, we considered eliminating Filippo Ristorante as an option.  Just then, an Italian man stepped out of the restaurant and personally invited us to come in to dine in a kindly, soft-spoken, very polite manner. My hubby and I looked at each other...should we?   Yelp's reviews were iffy and there were no other diners in the restaurant.  We decided to take the chance and accept our host's invitation, mainly because he seemed so kind and sincere.  We are very glad we did! \\n\\nWe received wonderful personal attention from our host.   He was extremely attentive, answered all of our questions, chatted briefly with my husband (who is of Italian heritage) gave us his menu recommendations, and kept our bread basket and water glasses full.   We felt he gave us excellent service in a quiet, respectful way without being intrusive or overbearing.  \\n\\nWe found our food to be delicious.   We enjoyed fresh bread dipped in olive oil.  Our salad was of mixed greens, fresh, crisp, and dressed with just the right amount of house Italian vinaigrette.   Hubby and I shared both our entree-sized salad and hot entree, and left absolutely stuffed!   The eggplant/veal parmesan dish was well seasoned, with a crispy pan-fried crust, tangy marinara sauce, bits of smoky Italian meat (pancetta?) hidden within the layers, and topped with plenty of melted cheese.   My husband enjoyed adding heaping spoonfuls of fresh peccarino Romano cheese (provided on our table) to his portions of parmesan and pasta.   The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.  Our host offered to bring additional sauce for our pasta if we desired, but we felt that it had the perfect amount.  He surprised us with 3 complementary crispy and lightly sweet pizzelle cookies to complete our lovely meal.   \\n\\nMy husband I agree that the decor of this restaurant may be a little bit \\"dated\\" with framed photos and awards/newspaper clippings from like the 70's and such adorning many of the walls, also a little bit \\"kitschy\\" with Italian themed banners and memorabilia, which may not necessarily appeal to some of the younger millennial crowd.   Hubby and I took it for what it was, though, documentation of the restaurant's successful history.  Although this part of the decor might have been dated, everything was clean, displayed attractively, and seemed to be well maintained.  The tables were set with clean white tablecloths and sparkling glassware, creating a mood of semi-fine dining atmosphere.   The glass wall near our table was open, allowing us enjoy the street view and beautiful Boston weather.  We felt that the lunch prices were very reasonable and the portions more than generous.   Based on this experience, we would definitely return!"},{"name":"Guac y Margys","address":"661 Auburn Ave NE, Ste 120","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Delicious tacos, freshly squeezed lime juice margaritas.

O'Connors was connected to the Westin itself, it was the most convenient since I didn't really feel like stepping outside (the weather was hot and humid). For take out, you order at the bar, pay, and wait. After paying, I didn't have to wait too long - 15 minutes while they cooked and prepared the take out. I do have to say that you really have to flag down the bar host because sometimes they know you are there but they totally ignore you (which some other reviews are not lying about). I sat a good 5 minutes waiting while she was there talking to her other bar host friend just chatting away.\\n\\nI decided on the FRIED CHICKEN ENTREE (W/ CORN ON THE COB AND BAKED BEANS). Let me just say that I was definitely not expecting the amount of food that came out in the take-out. It was a humongous bag (they packed everything separately - corn, baked beans, utensils, dipping sauce). The FRIED CHICKEN was fried perfectly where the skin was kept crunchy (even after being packaged). There were like four enormous pieces of fried chicken (drumstick, extended wing, thigh, and breast), but I was only able to eat the drumstick and the extended wing (as well as the crunchy skin of the thigh and breast because it was just so darn crunchy and juicy!). The CORN ON THE COB was a full head of corn, not half, that was grilled so had a slight grill flavor to it. I was able to eat all of that as well (the butter sauce was packaged separately and still cold - I wished it was heated up at least so I would be able to spread it on my corn). Finally, I was only able to finish half the baked beans which were sweet and had a small kick to it because of the spices. \\n\\nI really wish I had someone to share the entree with because that was a whole lot of food I was not able to finish, but at least, was able to enjoy greatly while relaxing in my hotel room and watching some television.

These tasted great!\\n\\nThe issue came with the pad thai I ordered. I asked for it really spicy (thai hot) and I was told it already was extremely spicy. What I got was something with all the ingredients in Pad Thai but not the tamarind sauce. And the food was not even mild. Quite bland. I asked about the missing spices and tamarind sauce and was given a side bowl with a soy/vinegar sauce with spices mixed in. The spices were what was missing but the vinegar in that mix just ruined the meal for me and I felt sick to my stomach for the rest of the day from that vinegar. It asked if that was their take on tamarind sauce. The waiter had no idea what that was and when she asked the kitchen, was told they don't carry that. The \\"sauce\\" was what was normally put on their Pad Thai (less of it tho no doubt). I might go back and try some other things but that Pad Thai was a big bust for me. Go down 17/92 to \\"Thai Place\\" for some awesome dishes. This place has some menu work to do.\\n\\nI'm now reading the rest of the reviews. Apparently they don't even use sticky rice but long grain rice instead. This is nasty and impossible to eat with chop sticks.

It was okay at best. Drinks were mixed well but were on the smaller side and served with heaping scoops of ice, but they only cost 9 each so you get what you pay for. The drink menu and the food menu were extremely limiting and very pricy. Small plates (appetizers averaged about $15, entrees averaged $25, and all side orders were $8. I had the jumbo hot wings and a side of potato wedges. They serve the whole wing, with the tip which I usually love but eating out in public it's awkward ripping the wing in half and pulling apart the tip, not to mention messy. The wings were decent. Also the potato wedges weren't anything special but regular fries.  \\n\\nOthers at my table had the Chicken and Waffles; the waffle is a cheddar and chive concoction but apparently it's impossible to ask for the waffle without the cheese. The friend who ordered this also had to make several additional requests for syrup and the whopping teaspoon they give you with your large portion obviously isn't enough.  The same also applied for the ketchup sent with my fries mentioned earlier. Matter of fact all the condiments were portioned out previously, and not kept on each table, possibly to save money but seemingly greedy to us, the customer.\\n\\nIt's also impossible to order just the fried chicken, of which this restaurant praises itself. There's no side order or main order of just the fried chicken which sucked. My friend who came for the chicken has to order the South West chicken and replaced the Mexican corn with some other random side (the biscuits, which she says were served cold, making it difficult to spread the compliment butter and jam). The overall report of the famous fried chicken was that it was just okay and nothing special. Welp. There goes $23.\\n\\nAlso for our party of four there was a built in gratuity if %18, which I definitely wouldn't have paid with our waitress' attitude and lack of attention. They also made it a challenge to split the bill amongst a party of four, they made a special exception for us because we were originally a party of five. \\n\\nBesides the far from southern food, they attempted to keep up the charade with mason jars as cups, tin cans for the cocktails, and tea plates for the appetizers. Not to mention all the wait staff in flannel shirts and cowboy boots or fried chicken and ribs served in a tin bucket. Also the constant flow of solely country music was extremely exhausting.

The hostess / waitress (she looked like she was incharge) greeted us with a smile and asked us if we could wait for couple minutes while she got our table ready for us\\n\\nThe place is kinda small with about 10 tables. When we came in there was a party of 5 people who were huddled rather uncomfortably around 2 tables, and another party was just leaving.

I got a banana lasagna -- layers of plantains baked with cheese and my friend got their signature shrimp muqueca -- shrimp in a very savory seafood broth with onions, tomatoes and lots and lots of cilantro. We also ordered mango nana - mango, banana and papaya juice,  for our drinks. \\n\\nWe could hear the blender as she prepared our drinks.. They were yummy!! Next our food came out in 15 minutes, and both the dishes were served with rice. The muqueca was also served with a bland gravy thing. My dish, the banana lasagna, was very filling. The cheese was saltier than I am used to. I liked that. and the plantains were firm yet squishy and cooked to perfection. I sneaked a bite out of the muqueca it was simply out of the world. I loved how all the flavors came together and melted in my mouth. I think I am going to order this the next time that I am there.. Oh yeah there will definitely be a next time.. \\n\\nOne of the other wonderful things about this establishment was that there was a constant flow of locals that were coming in chatting with the wait staff and picking up their dinner to go.

I thought that since we enjoyed it so much 2 weeks ago it would be a great place for a party of 8. We were seated quickly and brought delicious chips & salsa. The salsa is very fresh and has a great smokey flavor. Our party of 8 included 2 children ages 1 & 3. I asked to have my margarita made as is except for no sour mix. They refused to make it as requested! I am the one buying it so why not make it as I ask!? This was on problem exactly 2 weeks ago but it was an issue this time. The drink prices also seem to have changed in a 2 week period although the menu was the exact same menu we saw 2 weeks ago.....\\n\\nMy daughter ordered an PLAIN cheese quesadilla with no side, nothing but cheese. I was charged $12 for it. I also paid $3 for her soda but we could not get a refill to save our lives. I wouldn't mind paying for a soda if she could actually get her refill. They also charged us $3 EACH for drinks for babies and we of course could not get a refill on that either. Now, the kids meals are all $7.99 EACH and DO NOT include a drink!? They ordered kids chicken fries and would not eat them. They were not good at all. I ordered chipotle chicken enchilada's. They were delicious. My husband ordered a chicken smothered burrito that was also delicious. The other entrees were good as well. The rice was not edible, it was all chunked together. The beans were supposed to be the homemade beans but we did not get them. I asked the server about it and he said oh that's what he gave us....I knew the difference so I knew he was lying. He screwed up but did not want to correct his mistake. He also did not want to acknowledge it was my granddaughters birthday. Seriously, a Mexican place that does not recognize a kids birthday? It would not be a big deal but since the rest of the meal had been rather flawed, this was the final straw. He did not even offer us dessert! The food also came out fast. We were there at 8:30 on Friday and were out of there about 9:45. We did want to order dessert but our server seemed to want to rush us out of there instead of paying attention to his table. \\n\\nJust 2 weeks ago we enjoyed this place so much. It was just my husband and I though. I totally made the mistake of bringing a large party here. We contemplated so many other places in the area but I kept thinking how great it was last time.

Because we were ordering appetizers and not a meal, we were told we had to sit in the bar--which was fine.  However, the waiter did not bother to come to our table since there two larger parties he was taking care of, and he was unable to extricate his nose from their behinds to wait on anyone else.  \\n\\nOh wait, he did come to our table twice--once after the manager came to our table (after my friend sought her out), and once to bring the check.

We requested to at least have napkins, but he walked away with no response (yes, he heard us and no, we did not get napkins from him).  \\n\\nAnyway, sorry for the $0.00 tip buddy, but really, what did you expect?

DFB recommended the beef over chicken and the potatoes over the Quinoa & Vegetable option. I believe Kale may also be an option.\\nSo at the heeding of DFB, we ordered the Slow Roasted Sliced Grilled Beef Bowl with the Red & Sweet Potato Hash as the base and the Charred Onion Chimichurri sauce (12.99). This was hands down, amazing. Such an awesome addition to the Quick Service options at AK! The meat is served on the rarer side, which is perfect for me, and it was tender with the amount of flavor one might expect. The Charred Onion Chimichurri sauce tasted exactly like the delicious one served nearby at Tiffins. Yum yum yum! I do wish the kid's portion came with the potato hash as a base option - because I'd like a smaller portion, it's so large!\\nWe also ordered the Cheeseburger Steam Pods ( Buns),(10.99). These were served with Crunchy Vegetable Slaw and Vegetable Chips. It seemed the variation of Vegetable chips were purple potatoes, sweet potatoes, and maybe just plain potatoes? Couldn't quite place the flavor of the white ones. Supposedly, if you decline the side of chips it'll knock the price down. But being our first time, we wanted to try them. Now, the Bao Buns were not that great. A little too thick and a bit undercooked; ours was lukewarm with some of the bun being on the colder side.

My Reuben sandwich was very average, but nothing to complain about either. The baked beans would have been good, except that the molasses flavor was very overwhelming and ruined it for me. My boyfriend's hamburger was couched between what looked to be a regular white bread mass-produced supermarket bun.

It's an easy going, eclectic 'foodie' town, with almost no pretension, and we always find good new things to try here. So on this visit we expected no less when we decided to eat at The Picnic House which was right across the street from our hotel.\\n\\nThe interior is decorated to evoke a feeling of eating outside in a park..interesting wall treatments, a big, heavy gnarled wood 'picnic table' in the middle of the restaurant, lightposts serving as lamps, etc.. So between the interior and the yelp reviews, we were hoping to have a really nice time. Of course I'm sure the guy that went pheasant hunting with Dick Cheney thought the same thing at first as well. \\n\\nWe were starving after a long drive, so were glad that there appeared to be plenty of seating available when we walked in at 6:30 on a Friday night. Unfortuantely, there was no one at the front to greet us, so we didn't know if we were supposed to wait for someone, seat ourseleves, or what.\\n\\nAfter a few minutes, a young man (Joseph) came running up from the back of the restaurant, sat us by the window and told us 'Rosemary' would be by to help us. \\n\\nWe sat for several minutes...looking around...watching a few homeless folks wandering by (typical for downtown), noticing that the table wobbled, etc.. After about 10 minutes Rosemary came by and asked us if we wanted anything to drink. By then we had plenty of time review the menu, so we ordered our food at the same time (since we were hungry and at this point we were already concerned about the service). \\n\\nAfter another 10 minutes, a different server came by with our water and my drink. I had ordered a Manhattan over ice (yes, I'm old). It came in a large tumbler, about one third full, with two, sad, lonely ice cubes floating around in it. Having not been previously aware of Portland's ice shortage, I was a little taken aback, but decided to move on. After enough swirling, I got the drink down to room temperature and it actually tasted ok, I just had to get over the appearance.\\n\\nSat another 15 minutes...more swirling...no food (no bread or anything else to keep you busy while you wait).\\n\\nAnother 15 minutes of swirling and we were getting pretty impatient and about to leave and go to McDonalds. \\n\\nFinally after about 35 minutes (and a lot more swirling amd contemplating chewing on the napkins) our food was delivered to us (by another different server). My wife had the lemon chicken with mashed potatos, I had the pork loin brochettes with asparagus and bread pudding. \\n\\nHer chicken and potatoes were fairly bland..nothing special. My pork was overdone, somewhat tough and flavorless, and the bread pudding was dry and burned (yes..burned bread pudding) and had al the appeal of an old Christmas fruitcake. At least the asparagus was properly done. \\n\\nAs we were starving, I ended up eating much of the pork and all the asparagus (although I left the bread brick pudding to fend for itself). My wife picked at the chicken and had a little of the mashed potatos, but decided maybe she wasn't that hungry after all.\\n\\nWe finshed eating all we were going to eat after about 15 minutes and sat....and sat...(and swirled)...and sat.. No one came by to see how we were doing..no one checked on us...nothing. \\n\\nContinued sitting...looked around to see where the servers might be spending their time, but didn't really see anyone at any other tables, so maybe it wasn't because we smelled bad as no one else was getting service either. Sat some more...finally after almost 30 minutes AFTER we had finished, my wife got up and went to the back to try and find a server.\\n\\nShe found Joseph, who apologized and said someone would be right there. After about another 5 minutes, yet another different server (and I use the term loosely in this case) came by to pick up our plates and ask in a very obnoxious condescending tone 'did you want to see a dessert menu'? I might have wanted to 45 minutes earlier, but I didnt' want to bother her as she was obviously to busy to wait on people in her restaurant and frankly I didn't think we could afford to book another night at the hotel while we waited for dessert. So we decided not to request anything more from the Paris Hilton wannabee waitress other then to get the plates out of our faces. \\n\\nFinally Joseph showed up a few minutes later with the check. They bring the check in a book..a cute touch, but they should have brought the menu in it instead, as it would have given me something to read while I spent the last 5 years of my life sitting in the their restaurant. \\n\\nNet is...decor is clever and ecclectic, food is mediocre (which equates to 'poor' when you're in Portland) and service (other then Joseph who at least seemed to be trying) was abysmal.

Frittata was good, I like the combination of the olives, feta and cauliflower. Potatoes Brava, best potatoes I have had in a while. English breakfast, mmm bacon. Moroccan Chicken Hash, incredible bursting flavors like curry but not sure if I was a fan of the cream that came with it. Finally the steak and eggs...winner, winner! The meat was cooked med rare and seared perfectly on the outside. It was nice and tender. Add the jalapeno butter to the cornmeal pancake and eat it all together, winning! This dish took longer than the rest since the cornmeal pancake cooks in the skillet but it definitely was worth the wait and stole the show.\\n\\nOverall the layout is different than what we're use to but it worked. It did get loud at times but I was surprised on how well the service was.

In two cases, what the chef prepared could be considered major felonies, with multiple infractions.  I am not an overly fussy person, but this stuff would have sent a culinary school student back to repeat the semester, it was that bad.\\n\\nI ordered the lamb with potato-garlic \\"mash\\" (I forget what they called it) and expected an upscale-restaurant level of cooking, but what I got was just a shambles.  The dish arrived with a \\"salad\\" of some greens placed squarely on top, which had then been liberally sprinkled with feta cheese.  I was a bit puzzled with this presentation, but quickly discovered a probable reason for it.  The lamb underneath was *totally* overdone, gray throughout without a hint of pink anywhere, let alone the level of rareness one expects in fine dining.  I surmise that the offending chef wanted to cover up his felony so that his boss did not get a glimpse of it as it went out the kitchen door.  To make things worse, that feta cheese was all over the plate and did not mix at all with the taste of lamb or potatoes, only with the salad.  So, I had to spend a couple minutes just rounding up the errant ingredients into two compatible piles.\\n\\nThen I looked over at two of my dining companions who had ordered the beef medallions and saw quite a similar situation.  The meat was again totally overdone, without a hint of the rareness that had been ordered.  It had in fact been so over-roasted that all the juice had been cooked out, leaving the meat more like shoe leather.  This was a criminal act to a fine cut of steak.  To compound the effect, the frozen peas in the vegetable side had not even been totally thawed out prior to serving, with cold centers instead of warmth.\\n\\nIf my wife and I had been alone and paying for this experience, I would have demanded that the manager come to the table and personally witness what was coming out of his kitchen.  But we were in a larger group, and we were not paying.  So, a \\"scene\\" was not appropriate.\\n\\nBut I swore to write it up for you Yelpers."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Good morning and rise and shine to Tasty n Sons!

I placed an online order in the amount of $55. The app said my order would be ready in 11 minutes. I showed up 20 minutes later. The lady at the cash register said my order wasn't ready yet. No big deal, so I thought. I stood there for another 10 minutes and watched folks hand their receipts to the manager. She said their printer was down. At that same time, I said, I ordered an online order about 30 minutes ago. No smile on her face, just OK what's the name under? Once again, I stood there for another 10 minutes and watched everybody in front of me and behind me get their food. I spoke up again. All she could say is we are working on it. No apology, no effort to figure out why my order wasn't being made. About 10 minutes later, I spoke up again. Same distant behavior from the so-called manager on duty. I placed my order at 12:55 PM online. I watched at least 40 people getting their food, while I just waited not really a happy camper. Finally, at 2:10 PM she comes out with my order very rude, not even really giving a crap that I had been waiting and waiting and waiting while everybody else was being served. (Folks who ordered food behind me and sat there and ate, were already gone by this point). She comes over to me, and says, \\" here it is, is everything there?\\"  No offer to comp my meal, no offer for a coupon, no apology, Just extremely short with me. I asked her to explain why it took this long when everybody behind me that ordered in this restaurant was being served and I was looked over, even though I had said at least three times I haven't been helped yet. She was very unprofessional. As a manager, she should have not been so rude. When I mentioned the first time after 30 minutes I'm not getting my food, it should've been made a priority.  I did not ask for compensation, but personally, I feel after waiting for an hour and 10 minutes for my online order that something should've been done differently. This woman was not management material. If they were having printer issues, I understand that.  However, when you have customers, and it wasn't me, being  basically ignored, the restaurant has a major problem.

I get it now. \\n\\nSo I finally made the loooooooong journey from deep SE PDX to the 'burbs to get a look at the local franchise of the east coast burger chain Five Guys Burger and Fries.  \\n\\nFor months now I have been reading reviews here that seem to fall into 2 categories: The \\"It's like In-n-Out and that's good\\" category, and the \\"It's not In-n-Out and therefore it sucks\\" category.  Sorry, but I can't join either camp.\\n\\nLet me start by saying:  IF IT'S NOT IN-N-OUT IT'S NOT IN-N-OUT. That's a tautology folks, but it sometimes those are so obvious that they need to be pointed out again. This is not In-n-Out because it is something different... it's 5 Guys Burgers and Fries.  \\n\\nYes, the decor has that red/white checkered pattern, the burgers and fries are made fresh by a horde of harried workers rushing around in plain sight of the ordering counter, the menu is simple on paper but can be much more complex when actually ordered, and the burger's, well, they're good.  So I guess I can see where people are getting into comparisons. But that's really where it ends.\\n\\nHere, the burgers are more expensive ($10.27 for a burger, small fries, and a medium soda).  There are more options on the menu (but as far as I know, no secret off-menu options).  The burgers automatically double.  They are greasier, the bun is smashed (see photo), and there's way more toppings: grilled mushrooms, relish, bbq sauce, green peppers, A-1 sauce, hot sauce, and jalapenos. They also sell hot dogs.  Those are all things that are decidedly not In-n-Out. Plus, you can get cajun fries. Oh, and this franchise is not from California. \\n\\nSo really, what you get down to, is that you are comparing a burger place in Portland with a burger place that's not in Portland, and it makes you, me, and baby Jesus cry.  Why? Because we can't get In-n-Out here. That's why. So great, it's not as good. Is it better than driving 6 hours south to Redding for In-n-Out (the closest In-n-Out to Oregon, yes, I have checked with the corporate office). Yes. I think I can say that. Even though I HATE driving to Beaverton, it beats driving to Redding for lunch. If I happen to BE in California, then yes, I prefer In-n-Out. If they open an In-n-Out next door to Five Guys Burgers and Fries, well, then, there may be an all out burger battle royale.\\n\\nThat said, I did enjoy my burger today. It was delicious as far as fast food burgers go. The meat and bacon were good. The bun was annoyingly smashed and fell apart almost immediately, making it hard/messy to eat. And UNLIKE In-n-Out or Burgerville, they don't give you those little burger wrapper things (that look like cupcake wrappers) to help keep all the goop from getting all over your hands/the table/your shirt.  I am not stoked about paying over $5 for it, but that was the option. I took it.  \\n\\nThe real highlight? The FRIES. Both the cajun fries and the Five Guys Fries are bomb. Fresh cut, fresh cooked, nice and thick, and salted to hell. You get way more than you order. A small is supposed to be this small cup, but when I got my bag, it looked like they had dumped about 3 of those small cups in there. \\n\\nThe place was jam packed but the delivery was still quick. The service was friendly and on-point. They definitely run a tight ship. \\n\\nSo I can see how this place would remind you of an In-n-Out. Especially with the red/white checkers. In fact, the second I walked in, I thought \\"Oh, I see what these guys are trying to do.\\"  But really, I think it's the east coast's answer to In-n-Out. Similar in some respects, but different.  Shall I compare the two? Say one is better than the other? No, I won't. You can do that. Doing so just makes me wish there were an In-n-Out here, and there isn't, and that makes me cry, and...  damn it! See, I even did it! ARGH! \\n\\nSo kids, I've learned something today:\\n\\nIf you go through life comparing everything to the best version of that thing, you are bound to be disappointed.  And really, if you can't get the best where you are, then what sense does that make? So go try Five Guys Burgers and Fries.  Don't go in expecting In-n-Out. Be surprised by what you can get fast food style (for restaurant prices) in Oregon, and know that you just can't get In-n-Out here. It makes that burger taste oh so much better. \\n\\nPS: Five Guys kicks B-Ville's ass as far as taste and value goes, especially since a burger, Yukon Golds, and a drink costs over $10 at BVille now."},{"name":"Southern Kin Cookhouse","address":"500 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Huge letdown!

I said I'd ordered an entree on menu (chix fried steak) and he then says it's no longer being served. I was perplexed and asked then why is in the menu. The waitress had said they ran out of the chix fried steak, the mgr says it's a discontinued item. Ugh!!! I just want to say we were both disappointed big time. Needless to say we won't go back. I recommend they hire wait staff that show some interest in their customers, cooks that can actually cook a steak, and make sure everyone communicates amongst each other (kitchen, servers, mgmt).

Crispy on the outside,  creamy in the middle.  Good lord they were good!!!  This place is an absolute gem.  My wife and I plan to revisit on our way home from the Sunshine Coast for dinner!!

I ordered my pizza at 8 pm, and did not get it til 9:40! and I live 1 mile from the restaurant.  The tracker system is crap, it said the driver was on the way at 8:19, and delivered at 8:45.  I called the restaurant after the first 30 min and one guy was at least nice and asked for my address, and said the delivery driver had other stops before mine.  I called after an hour and the assistant manager just said \\"all my drivers on the road, should be there soon\\".  So an hour and a half goes by, and i call the restaurant again, at this point I just want my money back.  The assistant manager says she doesnt know how to work the computer!!! so to get my money back I have to wait til the next day.  So youre a manager and dont know how to work your own system?  So I'm out of food AND money for the night then?  She didn't even offer to call the driver to see where he's at.  I live a mile away, I could've came and picked up my own food by then and be back at my house. At this point I was about to go to the store, and just ask for a cash refund.

So I asked theme where they go, and they said they have a rest room upstairs in another building or something. I made it clear I needed to go, and the waitress did not care. So I ran two blocks each way and could not find a rest room, came back, told the waitress and she was still unwilling to accommodate.\\n\\nThe soup was delicious. Amazing. But then our entrees, duck and a fish dish, were terrible. My GF asked to please take the entree after trying one bite and tasting it and feeling like it was undercooked and she would get sick from it. Not only was the waitress not empathizing for her, but she kept trying to push the dish back to her. I have never seen anything like it. So finally my GF said to her \\"can you please just take this back, it doesn't taste right.\\" She went to the back, we heard yelling, and then the waitress came to my GF asked her \\"what's wrong with it, do you just not like it?\\" I couldn't believe how rude this lady was. I was in awe. \\n\\nThe owner (it seems)/ maybe manager came out and was as nice as can be. She was caring and took time to talk to us, asked how things were, but we didn't want to be confrontational. So we just kept our mouths shut.

Overall, I'm thrilled that I can find a chicken parm sandwich within walking distance of my house (or anywhere else in Portland, for that matter).  The chicken was wonderful, the sauce plentiful, and the grated cheese served with it a real treat.  The bread, however, seemed a bit generic.  Obviously a cart can't be baking their own, but I would suggest something like a trial run with a baguette from An Xuyen, for example.  Since An Xuyen is able to sell their own sandwiches so inexpensively, I'd have to think a substantial bread upgrade would be affordable for Little Boston.  Other quibbles about a generally pleasant lunch was that the Italian Sub my wife had seemed to be lacking oil and vinegar.  The seasonings that were present were wonderful, but a bit of zingy moisture would have been welcome.   And the cannoli were very tasty - my only suggestion about these homemade treats would be to fill them as they are ordered, to retain crispness in the shells.  I'll definitely be back, I'd love to see this cart succeed, and with a couple of minor changes, I think it could be a real standout.

The cart is open a few odd and mysterious hours, and seems to sell only roasted corn cobs and smoothies.  It has to be one of the strangest combinations ever, and combined with the odd hours, it became sort of this weird but interesting enigma. \\n\\nThen it disappeared.\\n\\nThen a friend of mine saw it in some fenced-in lot out near Hillsboro. \\n\\nThen it disappeared.\\n\\nNow it's 2008, and lo and behold, it's baaaaaaack.  This time reincarated as a Korean BBQ cart still called Corn USA but selling, in addition to corn, lots of Korean BBQ bentos and some soup. To imagine the life that this cart has experienced. Where did it come from? Where has it been? Who in the hell thought they could make a living selling just corn and smoothies?  Who in their right mind thinks, \\"gee, I'm hungry, a corn cob and smoothie sure would hit the spot right now\\"?  The questions abound.\\n\\nSo with some trpidation but zero hesitation, I approached and chatted up the nice Korean lady running the joint, asking her what her specials are and all that.  She says her bulgogi and kalbi are both good. Well, we'll see about that. I have some pretty damn high standards since my good friend's mom is Korean and she cooks better than any K-town restaurant I have been to.\\n\\nSo she offers to do a half-bulgogi (spicy pork) and half kalbi (sweet/spicy short ribs). A nice combo - I can test out the majority of their repertoire in one sitting.  $7 seems kind of steep at first, but then it starts coming. First is a little mini cup of miso soup. A nice touch while I am standing in the freezing cold waiting for my meal.\\n\\nThen comes the main course. A container FULL of rice, short ribs, pork, some salad, a little mini egg cake, some chap chae, and a little rammekin of kimchi!! WOW! This is a dinner sized portion! My prior judgments on value instantly evaporate as I chow down.\\n\\nThe verdict? Some of the better Korean BBQ I have eaten in ALL of Portland. Good quality meat, great marinade (the pork wasn't super spicy but was still good), and good sized quantity. The kimchi was tasty, the chap chae was on par, and the little salad and egg cake were tasty touches.  It was a great bento.  My associate and I sat in oft-interrupted conversation as we kept zoning off into the daze of delicious food.\\n\\nThe sign at the top of the cart says #1 bento.

The back note of the goat cheese is very subtle. I suspect it helps tamp down some of the sweetness. The marionberry syrup / compote that threads through the blend brings a welcome and vibrant purple color counterpoint to the ecru-colored base. It also affords a much needed splash of tartness. The kicker, literally and figuratively, is the habanero. There was no sense of a bitter note that one might expect from a traditional hot pepper. If anything, the famously citrusy habanero  probably blended seamlessly behind the marionberry. In any case, the capsaicin punch is not insignificant. I LOVED it. They do warn patrons and you can also have a free taste to see if your tastebuds are burly enough for such a bite. \\n\\nTo my mind...this is exactly why I come to an ice cream shop.

It was purely due to my own gullibility and a few mean friends.\\n\\nI had agreed to meet a few of my buddies at Tom's the other night, and as usual, I was the first one there. Quick backstory - my friends and I have a running competition on who has the biggest you-know-what, and they had told me that Tom's had a nightly \\"game\\" where who ever has the biggest you-know-what, gets to drink for free for the night. Based on previous rounds of our own \\"game\\", I knew that my friend Darius was packing a hog, so I decided to try my luck before the rest of my group arrived, and take advantage of my Italian genes.  I coyly asked the bartenders about this competition and I was met with a stunned look of confusion, hastely followed by laughter. At first I didn't know why they were laughing, and so with laughter being infectious and all... I started laughing too. Once the bartenders and I collected ourselves they asked what I wanted. I asked them about how the judging works, like, if someone measured all the guys attempting the competition and had something similar to a score board. That's when the tone took a turn, and the male bartender told me to drop it, and that I was making his female co-worker uncomfortable. Being my naive self, I at first thought that my friends mixed up the bar where this free drinks thing was going down. I explained myself to the bartender and insisted that I meant absolutely no offense. Once I filled him in on what my friends told me, he said that my buds were clearly pulling a prank on me. Then it started to make sense. \\n\\nI apologized and went red in the face, but the bartender was understanding and felt bad for me. I ordered a tequila and Coke and when I went to pay for it I realized I didn't have any cash on me. The worst feeling ever. And he had already made my drink. I told him that I left my card at home but since I only live a few blocks away I said I'd run back and grab it and tip him a hefty sum because of everything that happened. \\n\\nOn my walk home though, I received an Instagram notification on my phone because I was tagged in a post. It was Darius, and he had posted a photo of himself and my other friends at Por Que No, enjoying tacos, margaritas, and smiling.

I'd have given up fries as a side dish for that and I never thought I'd hear myself say it. Seriously this is a must try! \\n\\nThe guys working on Sunday June 9th hustled! The minute someone left they zoomed over and cleaned off the table. With as busy as it was only once did someone have to wait for a table but its because they walked over there and wanted a table that a couple was just getting up from. He took care of it quickly. Really impressed at the staff at this place. \\n\\nIf this was located where I lived I'd go often for sure. Great food options, great atmosphere and the crew well trained and fast working.

My girlfriend and I did Uber eats and we would get this place every once in awhile. Any other place we were pinged to get food from was ordinary. Seeing the name \\"China Hut\\" come up was a whole new adventure. Our first time receiving the food order from here, we weren't sure about the entrance. You go through a normal glass door, but then there's a a big metal door that has you question if behind this door is a drug den or a \\"restaurant\\". Sketchy is not enough to describe it. Once inside, we were relieved as we could tell it wasn't trouble. But then realized what we had actually walked into. This place was nightmare not even Gordon Ramsay could fix. Nor would he try. Dirty tables, with boxes and trash as if someone was moving out. Old family members making paper mache at one table, dust, sticky tables, loud and angry employees. It was a mess. Looking at health reviews and gathering other info about this place it's flabbergasting. Black mold on the ice cubes in the bar area. Cooked meat and raw meat next to each other. Black grease on the side of the oven. Just awful. After cringing our wait in the booth for the order, my girlfriend goes to use the bathroom. She found a syringe in her stall along with a messy bathroom. And on top of that, the lady asked her when she came out if  they \\"accidentally locked her in\\" and we want to know, who got locked in here? Going back to this place after this first experience was a joke. So much so that when we would have a friend of ours join us in our Uber Adventures, we got excited when China Hut came up, so that we could show them the experience of such a horrible restaurant. \\n\\nTL;DR  Filthy, awful place.

With that understood, here you go-\\n\\nIm really sort of conflicted about how to rate this place.  The food is a solid 3.5 consistently.  But the service swings wildly from a  1 to a 5.  A few years ago we came here a few times and opted to stay away because the service was so poor.  Over the last few years I've been back a few times and the service *at the bar* was attentive and well handled.   Tables, however a a different story.  The table service is always hit or miss.  Tonight was no different, and it was a solid miss by a guy listed on our receipt as \\"Danny\\".\\n\\nWe came with a group of 8-9 and arrived about 10:30.  We had a guy named Danny as a server, and despite being the the only table with people in the  place, we still got the most worthless table experience imaginable.  We stayed until about 1:30 but you have to understand that of the 3 beers I ordered, I had to go to the bar and get two of them myself.   Also, keep in mind that over the  3 hour period we stayed, out waiter never came to check on us except for after one of us went to the bar and ordered our own drinks.  Additionally, we ordered a simple chicken nachos with our original drink order that didn't come for a full 90 mins after we ordered them, and not surprisingly, they-arrived just 15 mins after we went to accost our \\"waiter\\" and ask where our last order of drinks and our food were after waiting over an hour.  It was clear that he simply didn't submit the order.  \\n\\nAll of this was a bad enough experience,, but imagine how absurd it was when a friend of \\"Danny\\" tried to start a physical altercation after we left Danny a 10% tip.  Bear in mind that I genuinely felt like I overpaid offering him the courtesy of 10% at all. - he deserved a zero.  We were a group of professionals in our 40s, coming from a school function, and dressed in formal attire - yet the staff felt it was appropriate for one of Danny's friends to try and start a physical altercation when we settled one of our checks with a 10% gratuity - which honestly was about 10% too much.  \\n\\nIn summary, as much as I try to like this place, the establishment never rises above the level of the picnic tables you eat on.  There's better places to go for less money where you'll get good service.  I'd advise anyone who is not friends with the wait staff to avoid this place.

We started off with the Flight of Wontons, which gave us a chance to try all 3 of their flavors. It came with 2 firecracker wontons (with spicy siracha mayo), 2 spinach dip wontons, & 2 crab wontons(with a sticky sweet sauce). This was a great treat because there were 2 of each flavor and 2 of us, so we could both have our own wonton of each flavor. Neither one of us personally cared for the spinach dip or crab wontons, but we are definitely fans of the firecracker wontons. They were crispy, not too creamy, which was the problem with the spinach flavor, & had a nice little kick until you used the siracha mayo, then there was a nice bold kick. \\n\\nAs an entree, I went with the Pad Thai, choosing chicken as my protein. I had them hold the peanuts, but should have asked them to hold the peanut sauce as well because it was a little too much for me. If you're not sure if that's your thing, I'd suggest getting it on the side and adding as you please. It also automatically came with tofu which I decided to try (still not a fan), but you can ask for it to be left out. Overall, it was tasty and a large serving. \\n\\nMy sister got the Mongolian Steak with white rice. It was a good sized portion and she had some left over. She said it was a little salty for her tastes but the rice helped mellow it out. Some of the rice was mushy but if you mix it all together, the sauce helps. \\n\\nThe place does still have a newness to it. It's very clean and open with plenty of seating. You order your food at the counter, they bring it to you, and our order came pretty fast and was freshly hot. We would go again and try something different, specifically their Banh Mi sandwich, maybe even give their dessert wontons a try. I like to try a place a couple times before I write it off.

So when the hubby suggested pizza tonight (after just having had 'za Friday night at Hopworks), I was more than happy to check it out.\\nWe had considered ordering it for take out but their website menu is pretty bad (can someone with any technical savvy please donate some time to them?), we figured it must be badly out of date and surely they'd have some pizza creations and more toppings than the website was showing.\\nIt was a nice night out so we opted to sit outside and instead of seating us at one of the four picnic benches out front we were ushered into a great, private patio out back.  However upon looking at the menu, it was exactly what was on the website (except for the strange formatting directions they can't seem to figure out how to remove).  There were no pre-created pizzas and the number of toppings was shockingly limited.  No green olives, no banana peppers, no pineapple, no sauces (ie BBQ).  Clearly we were going to be getting a simple pizza tonight.\\nWe chose an andoullie sausage (one saving grace was that they advertised the meats were from Otto's Sausages), mushroom and onion.  And since the only size options were small or large, we went with a large.\\nAs we were waiting our friendly waitress brought us water, although one of the glasses had to be returned due to the floaties in it, and plates, of which 3 or 4 had to be returned due to stuck on food.  She was apologetic about this but really, it shows a clear lack of quality control.\\nWhen the pizza came out it was HUGE.  The crust was nicely charred but of the foldable/NY style crust, which is not a favorite of mine.  The sauce was obviously very fresh with a nice acidic tomato tang, as were the freshly cut mushrooms and onions.  But something was missing.  I couldn't put my finger on it and tried to rectify it with black pepper.  It helped, but still something was missing.\\nOverall, our waitress was very friendly but the dirty dishes + lack of toppings + lack of pre-created options + lack of flavor means I won't be going back.  The pizza at Hopworks was 100% better."},{"name":"Leon International Foods","address":"4000 Pleasantdale Rd, Ste A","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Incredible family owned bakery with the best baklava and fresh pita in town!

This northern Brazilian restaurant offers hearty seafood stews, whole fried fish and bean and pork stews.   The house salad includes apples and hearts of palm with thin cut sweet onions and green olives.  The house made balsamic is light and refreshing.  The seafood Muqueca cooked in a clay pot with delicate tomato, cilantro and citrus flavors is a must try on a a first visit.  The Mariscada and the Cod Capixaba are also excellent.  The fried yucca makes a great appetizer in addition to the salad.  The fried whole fish is excellent but a challenge to eat especially for young kids since it's complete with bones.  The Fejuada Completa (touted as the Brazillian national dish) is a hearty bean stew with pork and sausage, delicious but a little intense for some.  The collard greens, yucca powder and oranges that accompany the Fejuada are also great.  With all this great food, it might be tempting to eat too much and not save room for desert.

I don't post negative reviews because I'm some unintelligent halfwit who is mad for silly reasons, but man- this place needs a lot of work. \\n\\nOur experience started off so well, we were sat immediately, greeted by our server immediately, drink orders (and kid orders) taken immediately, I was all set to change my star rating and I even thought to myself, maybe management is reading these reviews and resolving issues and was impressed. \\n\\nWe waited an appropriate amount of time for the kid's food and discovered that the burgers they were given were (1) suuuuper rare and (2) medium rare. Kid with burger #2 was fine with the taste and texture (but for the last few bites) but kid with burger #1 couldn't eat it.  This is 100% an ongoing problem, very undercooked red meat. I don't know why they'd serve rare burgers in a kid's meal and honestly it didn't dawn on me to specify \\"don't bring us a rare burger\\" I've never had to do that anywhere else. But ok, no problem we can roll with the punches. \\n\\nWe asked to have it substituted for chicken nuggets, which the server happily did, however it never came out for the entirety of our meal. Our server, bless him, was so busy it seemed like they were under staffed or something, bc he was always attending to other customers. We waited a long time for refills, some of which never came.\\n\\nWhen we were able to flag him down to ask if we could just have it to go bc everyone else was finished with their meal, he was dismayed that nobody brought out the substitute meal and told the manager. The managers solution when he brought the to go box:\\"I'll take it off the bill\\" which would maybe matter more if it wasn't Kids eat free day but maybe he forgot. A free dessert would have been a better token of an apology. Other than a free free item. :-/ \\n\\nOur adult meals were fabulous, we had a fish dish and a shrimp dish.

So, you do get a few more bones with the half or whole rack.  The sides are extra when ordering a rack.  A full rack will run you $23,99.   Shortly after we entered the store, we were followed by a whole host of other diners.  I ordered the full rack and learned it was the last of the ribs.  I felt badly for the folks who followed after us where many were also looking for ribs.   I know I would not be happy to find a barbeque restaurant that ran out of its main staple.\\n\\nI loved their ribs!  They had a robust smokey flavor.  These ribs were the meatiest ribs I've ever had with hardly any fat on them.   They offer three sauces, sweet, spicy and hot that are located at the drink, utensils and condiment station.   I went with the spicy and it had quite a kick for me.   Next time, I will likely try their sweet version as I do tend to be a bit of whimp when comes to hot spices.\\n\\nRestaurant seating is limited to a row of tables for two along one wall of the restaurant and a handful of tables that seat four.   This is likely because the interior is longer than it is wide.    So, if you have a big family or group, you will likely be broken up.   \\n\\nI'm definitely coming back!   There are several other items on their menu that intrigue me that I want to try out ... beef brisket ... loaded baked potatoes."},{"name":"Eat Me Speak Me","address":"340 Church St","city":"Decatur","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm so sad that Eat Me Speak Me is closed.

The menu is brief but just the perfect amount without being filling. We chose to order a few dishes to share among the 3 of us, all of which were spectacular. \\n\\nRaw Beef Lettuce Wraps - beef tartare isn't for the faint of heart, for sure. But this wrap was worth a try! \\nFried Gold Rice - not the most insta-worthy but definitely flavor worthy! And the crispiness was on point. \\nGoat + Dumplings - a beautiful dish, although my pictures don't do it justice. The dumplings were delicate. The goat was tender, the broth was robust and flavorful.  \\nChillllll'd Wild Catfish Belly - pretty spicy but delicious fish dish - flavor profile was spot on. \\nOFF THE MENU: Cold Goat Pho - favorite dish of the night, if that's even possible with so many tasty ones to choose from. Not really a pho, really, but the broth was just as flavorful as a pho. The goat was tender and not at ALL what I expected, cooked as rare as it was, but I loved the flavor profile here, too. The noodles and vegetables were extraneous next to the delicious goat and broth but overall, 5 stars!\\n\\nI'm sad to see Eat Me Speak Me go but excited to see how Little Bear construction is coming along in Summerhill!"},{"name":"Guac y Margys","address":"661 Auburn Ave NE, Ste 120","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Let me preface by saying I went for FRIENDS trivia, so not a normal night, and all I had was beer and guac...\\n\\nI went to Guac y Margys a few weeks ago for FRIENDS trivia night with a friend. The place opens at 5 and since trivia starts at 7 we decided to get there at 6 to make sure we got a spot. When we showed up most of the bar seats were full and all that was left were a couple picnic tables. We sat at the end of one and the server immediately came up and took our order. I ordered a beer (since Tequila is NOT my friend) and my friend ordered a marg. We also ordered the guac for two which was MASSIVE. The guac was actually really good and such a large amount that we didn't order anything else. Which ended up being a good decision since after the first time we ordered our server never came back. To be fair, the place packed up pretty quickly after we showed up and since we were at the end of a picnic table it was hard for him to get to us. Also, since trivia was going on it was difficult to walk around. The trivia was really fun, except that you have to take your answer up after every question, which can be a little difficult since the restaurant is small.

We were the first ones there actually. The host sat us in a front window. We were greeted by a very charming waiter named Shaun. Shortly after water and bread arrived. \\n\\nThe bread was crusty and very airy. We used the infused olive oil and a little pepper to dip said bread in. It was very tasty. \\n\\nShaun was very attentive and offered some well placed suggestions. \\n\\nWe started off with salads... My wife ordered the Caesar and I ordered a special Parma Prosciutto and Pears dish. \\n\\nThe pears were delicious and well mated with the Prosciutto. I used a tiny bit of the infused olive oil as a drizzle over the dish and I found that the flavors popped better. A lovely salad. My wife really enjoyed her Caesar salad. It was spot on. The parmigiano reggiano was extremely tasty. The croutons were crunchy and home made. \\n\\nNext up the wife ordered Mussels... I tried one, although I am not a big fan of seafood at all. It was tasty, It was in a light spicy tomato sauce. Not too much, just enough to impart some added flavor to the fresh Mussels. Pretty tasty... My wife loved them.\\n\\nDinner....\\n\\nThe wife ordered Tagliatelle Verdi Alla Bolognese. She loved the Bolognese sauce. It was rich and very well done. Her only complaint, and this is just her opinion was that the spinach Tagliatelle fought a bit with the Bolognese. She thought it might have been better to have been suited with a simpler pasta, and have the pasta slightly more salty. That way the Bolognese would prevail and not fight too much with the pasta.\\n\\nI ordered the Tortelli Di Mele... I was told this was a dish they have had on their menu for 20 years and that it was their signature. It was outstanding. The sausage was nice with a slight fennel taste to it. It was not spicy. But it pared well with the sweet cream sauce. This is a dish I will most definitely have again. The browned butter, apples, sage and parmigiano just melded so well together. I was sad when I depleted my supply. That's not to say the portion wasn't big enough... I am just a sauce guy... For normal people, It was perfectly sized. \\n\\nAfter dinner we had a few moments to chat away with Shaun.

Of particular note, the pasta didn't taste like it had been sitting in a bin all day, and our pizzas were hot and perfectly cooked through, with the just-right ratio of crust, sauce and toppings.  (I couldn't finish mine, but it tasted nearly as good the next day, straight out of the fridge.)\\n\\nThe one employee onsite (who was simultaneously acting, in \\"Wizard of Oz\\" fashion, as the greeter, order taker, chef, cashier, busboy, and dining area cleaner), was friendly and engaging, and took the time to explain the ordering process and make recommendations to us in an unhurried, no-pressure fashion, even as he was doing about ten other things at once.

Hubby and I live in LA and while we have heard great things...how good could it be compared to the Thai Town places back home? On our last day, we needed to pick up something fast for dinner before we hit the airport, and we opted for this place. To go, we purchased the beef cheeks curry, roti's, a fried chicken wing, and the oxtail soup. \\n\\nThe only fault I have is that the person who packed it gave us nothing other than the food - no utensils, no napkins. Usually, I would dock off a star for this however the food was THAT GOOD that it was something I didn't even notice. I literally cried when I ate this. \\n\\n|| Beef Cheek Curry + Roti: 5+ stars. I have an Indian background and I grew up on curry & roti. This was my bread and butter and for me to say \\"wow, I have literally never tasted anything even remotely similar to this\\" is wild to me. The curry is so rich and fragrant and creamy with just the perfect amount of spice. The beef literally was falling off the bone. I could eat bowls and bowls of this for the rest of my life. As far as the roti, it was so buttery and moist and crisp in all the right places. I would love to eat these plain...they remind me almost of the roti I ate while in Morocco. They are on the small side but they are very rich and flavorful. Again, one of the best meals I have ever ate. \\n\\n || Fried chicken wing: +5 stars. We only ordered one piece of this since we wanted to try it. Again, we have fried chicken Thai places in LA....but nothing tastes like this. Whatever seasoning they used to bread the chicken is truly something I have never tasted before...a mix of sweet but spicy but salty and tangy...can't describe other than its hella GOOD. \\n\\n|| Oxtail Soup: 4.5 stars. The taste of this soup was again amazing, flavorful and took me right back home to the Caribbean. My only complain would be to make it less fatty, since there are pools of fat swimming at the top from the oxtail. This could have been from the take out container but again the flavors were there and I loved how West Indian this tasted. \\n\\nAgain, after eating absolutely amazing food in Portland, this has got to be my favorite meal...and we golfed this down while waiting in lines at PDX. If you think its just ordinary Thai...it is so far away from it that I wish they would say its something else.

They bring your food out in a clay pot where the broth is still cooking the ingredients. It makes for a pretty cool presentation. The food has a pretty powerful cilantro flavor, but it doesn't overpower the meat. The shrimp and the fish were quite good. I felt like the meal deserved a bit more rice because I still had lots of broth at the end and would have loved to use more of it as a sauce for my rice.

One person who has no customer service experience took away a customer who's been ordering pizza from them for over 20 years. This is absolutely unacceptable for someone to treat another person this way. The only thing that I was looking for was exactly what was being offered to me online. Even if it was slightly different I would have been fine with another promotion but the so-called manager was so unhelpful but she didn't even want to try.

Instead of apologizing for the inconvenience he has decided to spend 30 minutes of his life trying to get back at people who are expressing their own opinions. \\nGood luck with your business, because people will see how \\"amazing\\" of a person you are with that kind of response. \\n\\nP.S.

I loved that we were able to try multiple types of sandwiches(pastrami, Ruben, Turkey avocado). \\n\\nThe entr√©e we sampled was the Chicken Capri which had white wine sauce with mushrooms, capers and artichokes.

Not sure why people are lining up out the door at 11:30 am at this place, but at least the line was moving fast. I had a couple of pieces of chicken and it was pretty darn tasty, I must say. The fries (I got them without the spicy seasoning) were basic crinkle cuts, too salty, and the coleslaw was kinda yucky, drab with way too much cumin. But they must be doing something right, judging from the steady flow of customers  and the positive buzz in the place. Maybe folks are coming in for the sandos. Lots of varieties of chicken sandwiches to choose from. I'll try that next time. The staff is upbeat and energetic and all seem to be glad to be working there, so that's cool. A loud, fun place for fried chicken lovers to get a quick fix. Better than Juke? I'd say different, a little less inventive, but on a similar level of quality. I think this place will get better with time if they don't get arrogant because of the line ups. Remember the Mexican place Chronic Tacos? All day line ups and staff thought they were rock stars.

Recall this is a drink they have advertised...but the barista says they are out of the syrup they use in it. I asked what syrup they used and the barista said the simple syrup. First of all, who the heck runs out of simple syrup, it's literally sugar water ...  He's implying that they can't make this drink because they are out of sugar water; they could just literally add any kind of sugar instead. I asked, \\"Since you are out of the simple syrup, can I just have vanilla syrup instead so you can make the drink? Because where I come from usually that is how it's made.\\" He replied, \\"Sure no problem.\\" Since the sign only indicates one price, I ask him what size it is, and he said I can have small or large. I said large. Then he hands me my receipt and I automatically tip a dollar and sign the check... and then I noticed that I've been charged $8.75 for a $4.99 drink. When I ask him why, he said \\"Well you asked for a large and then upgraded the syrup.\\" I said, \\"But it was just more water! You didn't even give me a second tea bag!

This 7 grain oatmeal has great texture and flavor that rival that of traditional oatmeal, plus they add vanilla protien powder for better nutrional benefit. It's only $2.45 and is tasty and satisfying. It has me coming back often, especially on Mondays.

The other options were tamarind and meat sauce. I still have mild regret not trying their tamarind sauce! \\nFor our meats we chose meatball and lemongrass pork (recommended by cashier). Both were good, but I had a preference for the texture and flavor of the lemongrass, which seemed to stand out more than the meatball. The spring rolls were very filling, but we'd also ordered a lemongrass chicken banh mi ($10), so our dinner experience wasn't over yet!\\n\\nThe ratio of meat to veggies in the banh mi was perfect! We were mildly overstuffed by the time we finished eating everything, but we felt good about it! \\n\\nOther pros: easy seating, restroom for customers, self-serve complimentary water or hot tea or infused water (cucumber).

No one asked how the food was, so I had to go to the counter and ask them to re-make the fries and burger. After another 5-10 min, burger was still tasteless, and they re-fried the stale fries.

I understand that it's difficult, though possible, to split it amongst that many people, but that's why we asked at the beginning. \\n\\nMy two suggestions for this establishment: \\n\\n1. If you have a large party, you can simply name groups on your POS system that are broken up into the larger parties OR use the old pen and paper before ringing folks in, draw a simple chart with the table lay out and number of seats and (since you already have to write down everyones order) write the order by the seat number so you know who it belongs to.\\n\\n2. When responding to reviews (that were originally written to let management know about a less than satisfactory experience, say, constructive criticism) to be courteous and ask further questions about anything you may be questioning. I understand as a business emotions can run high when someone has a comment about the way you do things but it is usually easily rectified so long it's approached with grace.

Our first visit was (perhaps naively) without a reservation and while there is always that option of \\"sitting in the bar area\\", it seemed that \\"sitting at the bar area\\" is what half of Winter Park was doing when we arrived.  We also had the option of waiting about 2 1/2 hours (the time of their final reservation), so we decided to go elsewhere.\\n\\nOur second was with reservation and we were seated immediately.  Although even calling several hours in advance, the only reservations remaining were at the oyster bar (full service, you just need to swivel to see your waiter when he's there).  Fine with us since it was just a party of two.\\n\\nThe waiter knew everything on the constantly changing menu, and was able to describe the dishes well. We took our time and started off with a couple of beers (brewed in-house) and an appetizer.\\n\\nBeers:  I ordered the Five Points IPA, which was as hoppy as an IPA should be, but still smooth and clean tasting. Highly recommended.  My wife opted for the Holiday Cookie, which had a gingerbread flavor that was unmistakable, but happily not so overpowering as to make the beer less enjoyable.  As a matter of fact, my wife put it on her short list of favorite beers.\\n\\nAppetizer:  Prior to the arrival of the appetizer, we were given some cheese bread sticks to munch on while we waited, brought in from a local Casselberry bakery. Don't need to dwell on them necessarily, but they were gone FAST.  Our selected appetizer was Roasted Bone Marrow, something that neither of us had previously tried but were both curious about.  The appetizer was three bone sections with marrow inside, three lightly toasted ciabatta slices with melted garlic butter on them for spreading the bone marrow, and a pile of zucchini pickles.  Once again, the plate disappeared quickly.  As a side note, the waiter was kind enough to ask if we wanted him to hold off on putting in our entree orders until the appetizer was about done.\\n\\nEntree:  As much as I had already enjoyed everything put in front of me, the entree was where they really got me hooked. I ordered the duck breast, which was perfectly cooked with a crisp, powerfully flavored skin laying on top of a bed of soft and sweet caramelized onions and a pile of grits.  It was then topped with an assortment of crunchy bits, pieces of kumquat and I don't even know what else.  On the side was a bit of olive oil on the plate.  This quickly became one of those scenarios where it's so perfect and harmonious and incredibly delicious that you want to tear into it like a hungry dog but you know you can't because flavors like this need to be savored.  So then you decide to take small bites, secretly hoping that if you take small enough pieces it will last forever.  But of course it never does.  I understand that it might be frowned upon to actually be sitting at the oyster bar in this beautiful establishment licking your plate clean, but I did the absolute best I could to clean that plate without ever actually touching tongue to ceramic.\\n\\nDessert:  Strawberry & Cream Parfait. Light but packed with flavor, I know I'll want to try a different dessert next time but I don't know how I'll be able to pass this up.\\n\\nSo, everything was amazing.  The service, the drinks, the food, everything except the parking, because half of the already tiny parking lot is roped off for valet, and the first time I saw a valet (not here) drive away with my emergency brake engaged was the last time.

Delicious and very reasonably priced at only $6!\\n\\nI'm also a fan of the Golden Burger, an Asian twist on the classic American burger with a flavorful pork patty and crispy fried wonton (I recommend adding cheese as well).  And the fried chicken sandwich here is probably the best I've ever had - crispy and well-seasoned breading with a tender, juicy interior. The spicy sauce and slaw make the perfect combination. \\n\\nThere are several tasty veggie dishes available too, including the cheese puffs, which are perfect for me since I love crab rangoon but can't eat shellfish. \\n\\nThis food truck is definitely worth the trip!

I had to try the Salmon toast and see how it compared to the Nova Lox that I've had at Bruegger's and Einstein Bros. \\n     The radish slices were an interesting addition that gave the toast a nice crunch and nice color presentation. I really liked the dill leaf garnishing which just brings all the flavors of the salmon, pickled red onion, and cream cheese together. Light spread of cream cheese on toasted whole grain (ezekiel) bread gave the overall experience a nice satisfying finish without the overstuffed feeling that I've had when the base carb was a bagel. With that in mind, I would say that the double, which is two slices, would be better if you wanted to make it more of a post-workout snack. But for a light mid-afternoon snack, it was perfect.\\n    The $15 for a double is definitely more of a splurge for the amount of salmon that you get.

Sampling is definitely the way to go and the servers are happy to find what taste buds satisfy.\\n\\nThe pretzel bites and cheese dip is highly recommended.  It's not too salty and the cheese dip is pretty addicting.  It also pairs well with whatever beer you are having.  There is some liquor options but if you want a mixed drink, options are a little more limited.  \\n\\nThere is some seating outside, but no big patio is present.  The pizza's look appetizing and I saw many tables have them.  Again, Double Mountain is not my favorite, but it's a good option in the neighborhood."},{"name":"Salt & Straw","address":"2035 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The staff were very accommodating in giving samples of the ice cream.

That excitement faded very quickly upon receiving my food. (Not to mention how long it takes to place your order.) I ordered a 3 piece tender with fries and a side of macaroni and cheese. I started with the macaroni and cheese. I couldn't taste any cheese with the first bite, so I tried a second. Still no cheese. It just tasted like raw noodles and breadcrumbs. (I didn't eat anymore and actually asked for a refund before leaving.) Then I tried the chicken tenders and fries. The chicken tenders were very dry and something you might expect to get at a very low budget theme park. (Think microwaving a frozen store bought chicken tender.) The fries were just ok. The seasoning was heavy, but it wasn't anything to write home about. I did enjoy the Famous sauce I drenched my chicken tenders in to choke them down with."},{"name":"Tuscana Resort Orlando by Aston","address":"1395 Tuscana Ln","city":"Davenport","stars":"2.5","text":"I just spent 4 days here for the cheer competition.  This place needs some serious TLC.  The pool bar/restaurant is closed for \\"renovations\\" but in reality its just closed.  I had to ask for extra toilet paper.  There was litter all over the grounds; someone put a bag of garbage at the front of our bldg. and evidently animals got in it overnight and scattered it everywhere; it stayed there for 2 days.  The hot tub was filled with leaves and had cloudy water.  Several of the chairs by the pool had torn fabric and not usable.  Pool looked OK; lots of people in it.  There was some type of pipes in front of our building.  Water started spewing from the pipes; fortunately it didn't smell like sewage; we told the front desk as did some others who walked by.  On day 4 when we left, it was still spewing.  I saw several maintenance personnel sitting on golf carts looking at their phones (maybe on lunch break, hopefully).  We didn't have a bedspread, but a blanket between two sheets and only 3 towels for 2 adults.  The furniture is old and dated; the unit is very dark inside.  This resort needs a new owner/manager.

BEWARE CONSUMERS.  \\n\\nAfter reviewing their website I drove to Alessio Bakery from Vancouver to purchase a quantity of Italian rolls for a graduation party.  When I arrived I was told by a rude woman (who gets down right insulting later) that they are wholesale only and only sell 'retail' what's on their day old rack.  I told her that their website indicated otherwise and had a full menu of \\"deli breads, sandwich rolls, dinner rolls, specialty breads, & sweet goods/pastry\\" that were listed.  She told that was for their wholesale customers.  I even mentioned their homepage starts with the greeting \\"Welcome to Alessio, your \\"friendly neighborhood bakery\\".  I must have been at a different bakery because this woman (she certainly didn't act like a lady) didn't make me feel \\"welcome\\" and was anything but \\"friendly\\".  In fact, she told me that their website was over 5 years old and was outdated and I \\"should have known to call first\\".  There was no offer from her whatsoever to help me out even after I explained that I had driven from Vancouver and all I wanted was 4 dozen rolls.  I even asked if there was someplace close by that she could recommend and was told no. So I returned to my car, and pulled up their website to confirm what I had read.  Being unfamiliar with the area I checked the web and found no other listings for an Italian bakery in the area.  I returned to the store to see if anyone else there could help me.  I was speaking to a young man about the rolls I needed when this woman came out of the back room and demanded of me in a rather surly impatient voice \\"What do you want?  I told you we're wholesale only?\\". I told her I had checked their website again and reiterated that it describes itself as a neighborhood Italian bakery with a wide selection of rolls and breads.  The response I got from her was to either make a purchase or leave.  I told her I'd like to purchase 4 dozen rolls to which she promptly told to leave, which I did.  I went to the sidewalk in front of their building to take a picture (which I got) when this woman opened the door and yelled at me to get off her property or she'd call the police.  I told her that I was on a public sidewalk and not interfering with her or her business.  I then took her picture to which she immediately retreated and closed the business door.\\n\\nI normally don't write reviews, and in fact this is the first review I've written with Yelp.  This was one of the WORST displays of customer (dis) service I have been party to in years and can't help to think that the family ancestors that started this business would hang their head in shame for what occurred today.

We arrived at the restaurant last night (5/19/2018) around 8pm. As we approached the door an employee, I'm guessing he was management, was arguing with the hostess in a raised aggressive voice. After about a minute or two of heated words, the hostess finally acknowledged us. We were seated right away. As we followed the hostess to the table, we noticed the floor was extremely slippery with a grease film. We had to carefully walk to avoid slipping and falling. \\nOur server was wonderful at first and helpful. We were seated next to another table with a party of at least 20. There was a live singer in the corner of the restaurant, she was pleasant, lively and fun. Between the singer and the guests, the volume in the restaurant was the loudest volume I have ever experienced in a sit down restaurant. The server was unable to hear our orders and it took a lot of effort to communicate with our server over the noise. Of course our table conversation was impossible and we were unable to hear each other.\\nThe large party next to us constantly bumped our chairs and table. The individuals were constantly waking around their table and bumping us, because of the crowded table spacing. This tables party also broke several glasses, vases, and table condiment glassware. Which caused even more chaos. We noticed a couple of ladies were unable to walk around the table in their high heels, due to the slippery floor. So they both decided to remove their shoes and walk around barefoot. \\nOur food was served in an average amount of time. We watched as the hostess wiped down and was prepping the table next to us. We quickly noticed a cockroach run across that table and the hostess just wiped it up with her rag. We all stopped eating and tried to communicate about what we just observed. Shortly after, another cockroach ran under another table next to us. That was our limit. We tried to get our servers attention, but we were unable to. Then another cockroach ran under my daughters chair. She was panicked and scared. I then stood up, to gain attention of the waiter. I informed him of the cockroach and he literally shrugged his shoulders at me and walked away. \\nWe were completely grossed where we couldn't eat. We were ignored for 15 minutes until I requested our check. I did get to-go-boxes for all the food. I wanted to keep the food for proof in case we ended up with food poisoning. As we waited for the check we took a closer look at the condition of the restaurant. The mid and lower walls are covered in dried dripping white stains. The edge and corners were thick with dirt, food, and bugs. We saw a total of 6 cockroaches last night. There was literally whole pieces of bread laying on the floor, there was also other pieces of food littered throughout the restaurants floor.\\nThis was our experience in its entirety.

My only constructive-criticism is that those ribs need to be smoked longer!

They always give off the vibe that taking your order is an inconvenience, which is funny because they're never really busy. You'd think they would want more customers but maybe not! They also have a habit of messing up orders no matter what, even if you're the only customer. Baffling. They did it again in my latest visit yesterday. No apology for the mistake just a tone as if I'd done something wrong. \\n\\n\\nThe store itself is also in need of repair. The ceiling tiles are dirty with big stains. They do a nice job decorating for different holidays, but that doesn't cover up the flaws. There is often a distinct smell that I can never place.

No hyperbole.\\n- Their collard greens are not what I grew up with, but I don't care because they're so amazing. A little spicy, a little sweet, just.

While they've been open for some time, this was our first visit and we were pleased overall. Of course I'm a fan of any place that focuses on locally sourced foods. It's how I shop for my own meals so I appreciate any restaurant that also keeps it close to home.\\n\\nThere is no shortage of reviews on here already so I will just note the few things that stood out for us. We liked the look of the space, especially the oversized banquettes along the side wall. The hand crafted beer, I tried summer saison, was very good though it did seem like a short pour. The rock shrimp were very tasty but it would have been nice had they at least come with some bread to dip into the wonderful garlic butter sauce. The sandwiches come with fries which Marty generously shared. I liked their BBQ seasoning very much. The pickles (also shared) were also really good. This is a restaurant that does not put salt and pepper on their tables which was not an issue because everything we ate was well seasoned and flavorful.   \\n\\nNow I'm going to vent. We are perfectly capable of driving into a parking lot and pulling our car into one of the available parking spaces. We do not need, nor do we want to hand our vehicle over to some kid to \\"complimentarily\\" do it for us. The spot is right there. We can see it. We have licenses. We can pull into it ourselves. We don't want to have to tip someone to do what we are able to do right there for ourselves. Is your parking lot or garage down the street? Am I going to have to circle like a shopper at the mall at Xmas time until something opens up and miss my reservation time or be unable to get in and out in one hour for lunch? Then yes, by all means I appreciate the \\"option\\" of having a valet do that for me. But it is only a convenience when it is just that ... an option. Blocking off your parking spaces with cones thus forcing the issue turns a customer service into a customer disservice. \\n\\nThankfully we found a spot back behind the restaurant that wasn't blocked off.

Perfectly cooked, huge portion, spicy with amazing banana peppers. The mozzarella melts in your mouth. The sauce could be a little less watery, but I just shake it off. The bruschetta - what Italian orders bruschetta at a restaurant? This is good however - I think some Irish people I was with ordered it. \\n\\nENTREES: Please do yourself a favor and get the gnocci. Warm pillows of goodness. You will not regret it. The only downside is that they're filling and how will you have room to swipe what's on your neighbor's plate?

Despite the disappointment, all the food we ordered were delicious! I love how innovative the dishes are. I'm a huge sucker for variety and tapas! Even though my bf and I were sick of Voodoo donuts from the previous morning, we loved the chocolate potato donut they served here. It's different! It reminds me a little more of a churro with an amazing sweet dipping sauce. I also loved the sweet biscuits... so fluffy and perfect consistency. As for our main lunch dish, we shared the chicken sandwich with pineapple... mmm... flavorful and the pineapple adds a nice sweetness to it. We also got the Moroccon chicken hash... Oh my Lord, it was a party in my mouth.\\n\\nWe also ordered some sort of breakfast dish that came with bacon and eggs... that wasn't special.

I almost was afraid to come due to the bad-to-mediocre reviews, but the rooftop/ open balcony scene they have was very enticing and since we are new to the place and has been on this 'new restaurant binge,' we gave this place a shot and we enjoyed it! \\n\\nI do see how on the decor alone, that this place is automatically sending a message for you to \\"expect high end.\\" We enjoyed the place but didn't really buy into the 'high end' gig. We first opted to go upstairs - it was a bit busy especially with the live guitarist singing, so we ended up waiting quite a bit. We sat down on a dirty table, and we ended up cleaning it ourselves. When the waitress arrived, she took the plates we stacked for her and didn't even bother to wipe our table. Meh, no biggie. Chips and this caramelized onion and something something salsa dip was quite interesting to me. I couldn't stop eating it. We ordered a bloody Mary for $5 since that was their special for the night ... after about 10-15 minutes sitting, we decided to go downstairs - why? IT WAS SO DAMN LOUD. For it to be an outside balcony and just have ONE guy on an acoustic guitar singing, that place was annoyingly, senselessly, relentlessly loud. The guitar guy had that thing so loud, that people couldn't hear themselves and each other, so they speak louder, then the people on the other table speaks even louder because they couldn't hear themselves above the overly loud music and the loud table, and then thus the vicious cycle appears, and we couldn't stand it any longer.\\n\\nWhen we go downstairs, we finally have some peace and a piece of good food! Hubby and we ordered the Burrito Cinco for $11. We told the waiter we are going to split it and he was caring enough to have it sliced in the kitchen and given to us in separate plates. Little details folks. lol. Then we also had a chicken quesadilla that cam with a guacamole and lettuce salad. It was good, but nothing too significant for us. The Burrito Cinco was delicious! I like how they have this twist of different flavor to it, but at the end, i was able to determine their 'secret' ingredient ... and i thought, \\"brilliant twist!\\" \\n\\nIn the end, the customer service was slow, but the food was good, ambiance good, and prices fair.

Rosedale Burger is the best.\\n\\nFYI.

What about at 9:15?\\n\\"It's really easy to not hang up the phone correctly.  I'll fix it. \\"\\n\\nThat could certainly be the case.\\n\\nHowever, I have worked in restaurant operations at a large chain.  100% of the time, Phone off hook complaints from customers were caused by employees who took the phone off the receiver so that they would not have to take calls or orders, especially near end of shift.  Employee still gets paid the same amount, but they have less work to do.\\n\\nI realize that restaurant profits in general are thin and very sensitive to Theseoperations issues.I know that these lost orders could mean the difference between breaking even or losing money in a given day.  So I thought you might want to know.   \\n\\nSuggestion-ask all your night staff what problems they have had with hanging up the phone correctly.   Tell them your policy. Then, periodically audit.    For small chain you could even enlist your favorite business minded teenager to periodically call and keep a log of phone off hook records for all your stores at various times during the day, but especially near closing time,  for a two week period at different times during the quarter."},{"name":"Ittyo Restaurant","address":"1815 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"A+ all the udon and soba are amazing!

My only complaint, and this is strictly a preference, the bacon was thick and not particularly crispy. I prefer a crispy bacon on my sandwich. The tomato slices were fresh and large and there was just the right amount of mayonnaise on my triple decker sandwich. (I actually took out one slice of bread, I don't like that much bread.  The bread was toasted nicely. Most importantly, because I was on my lunch hour, the food came out quickly. My service was very good.

The mediocre food quality simply doesn't warrant the price.  Its alright, but I was floored when GQ recently gave it such rave reviews.  I think it reeks of nepotism.  Sure, the prices seem reasonable until you read the clause about having to order at least two of something.  What a scam.  This is fine for large groups but not for one to two people.   I really liked the pork belly and the sochu selection but after trying about eight dishes, we were pretty disappointed.

Everyone deserves their privacy.  \\n\\nAs far as relationships go, she might have been the biggest disappointment.  I was young, 18. I met her at a reading. We lived in the same dorm. She was older, 21, tall, slender and wild. She hung out with John Waters. She enjoyed picnics in cemeteries.  She liked gay clubs and vintage Chanel, introduced me to Syd Barrett and Opal.  She claimed she could play Mozart backwards in her head.  She slit her wrists when she was 17.  \\n\\nThis, at the time, was my perfect girl.  I fell head over heels.  We seemed perfect for each other.  I fit her bill.  I could play Mozart, fancied myself a composer, played in a Ska band, DJ'd dance parties into the wee, wee hours.  I even wrote poetry.  What cemetery hanging girl doesn't love poetry?\\n\\nOf course, after a few turbulent months of crazy young love, she ended up leaving me for another women.  Such is the story of my life's and love's disappointment.\\n\\nSuch is how I felt about another Pomeroy and her restaurant Beast.  I thought we'd be perfect for each other.  She loved offal, had a restaurant that subverted the white-tablecloth genre of casual fine dining.  She was into bold flavors and Dylan.  Even her advertising spoke to me.  What guanciale lover wouldn't want to see a pig's head in a print ad.\\n\\nIt took me a long time to eat here.  Perhaps I was simply too shy to go and walk over to her and ask for her sweetbreads.  When I finally did last week, it seemed everything I thought about her was wrong.  \\n\\nBeast's food was low on the bold flavor notes I gravitate towards.  The first course, a smoky tomato soup, struck one note, tomato.  The second, a meat plate, was overly sweet on the palate, especially the foie gras, which resembled poop on a cookie, but tasted like chocolate.  The third course was the best, but as the song says, I guess their best wasn't good enough. The beef tenderloin in croute was perfectly cooked, tender and rich.  The demi-glace however was a bit overpowering, and the accompanying gratin only made it heavier.  Even shaved truffles couldn't save the dish, their intensity squelched by the sauce.  Smartly the fourth course followed with a lighter note, a giant prawn on a salad of celery hearts.  Conceptually right, execution not so much, the prawn chewy and flavorless, the celery overpowering.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, the food wasn't the low point, that was reserved for the communal seating arrangement.  My girlfriend and I were seated our back to the kitchen, two-by-two, directly across from a young couple.  Now, I suppose this move was to encourage communitas, light conversation, to create a convivial we're all in this together, perfect, secret dinner party atmosphere.  It felt more like a blind date.  Our dining companions seemed to dislike our world-weary ennui.  They rode bikes and stayed in hostels.  We don't ride bikes.  Hostels scare me.  The whole experience was just terribly, terribly uncomfortable--physically.  My neck ended up crinked after two hours trying to shun engagement.\\n\\nBeast just might have been my biggest restaurant disappointment ever. Another Pomeroy, another disappointment. I'm beginning to think the Pomeroy's have a feud with my kinsmen.

The waitress I had was new and she didn't really seem to know what was going on. I have went there in the past and I would order a iced mocha cappuccino, but when she gave it to me it was in a smaller cup than usual and there was no mocha in it. If only I knew there would be a downward spiral from here.\\n\\nSo next, I ordered the usual triple double, which on the menu says it comes with home fried and toast on the side. The meal comes with bacon, 2 eggs, and a side of pancakes. I asked to sub the home fries for fruit because honestly I've had them there before and I thought they tasted like soap. I also ordered strawberries on top of the pancakes. The waitress never asked what kind of toast we wanted. Kind of strange when it says on the menu that it comes with it. All the other waitress that I have had in the past have asked about what kind of toast I would like. \\n\\nWhen the food got there, I was shocked. There was not two pancakes, just one and it wasn't even fluffy. It look disgusting and to top it all off, the strawberries were inside the pancake. I asked for them on top. Then we had a confrontation with the owner, who was mean and kind of aggressive. The waitress then made a comment that she was sorry that we were unhappy and didn't offer to help. I wish I had this girls name because she was awful. Instead of offering to help us when we were upset, she just walked away. The owner did nothing either, no apology. Just trying to make us like stupid. Then when we were unhappy, they didn't even offer to comp us for anything. I've had mess ups in the past at other restaurants and they would always do their best to make sure we left happy and willing to come back. There was none of that here. \\n\\nLong story short, I used to recommend this diner to everyone but not anymore. The quality of food and service has gone down extremely. I'm not going back. A place that I would have given 5 stars before honestly deserves none, but I have to give 1 star. The whole meal was $35 and the quality of food that was given to us does not come close to this price.

We ordered from their catering menu - lasagna for 25 and chicken parm also for 25. When the order arrived in 2 large aluminum trays, the portions were very ample (plenty to eat for our large party) and quality in taste (many came for seconds!). Victor's provided extra sauce for each order and the food kept its flavor throughout the service. \\nBut there are several places to order good catered meals so I will now write why Victor's on Lincoln Street stands out....\\nMy wife order the food to be ready for 8:00pm. Heated and ready to go. You can imagine that when she arrived and found out through some miscommunication that the food was not ready how disappointed she was (and nervous about our guests)...the owner (?) agreed to have it delivered as soon as it was done and sure enough they did as agreed 30 minutes later....but with a large tray of ravioli as an apology (that our guests loved!). Our guests asked where we ordered from and I am sure some will head over to this small restaurant for a meal in the future.\\nWe all have so many choices of where to bring our business, especially food choices...and when I see a business that understands the value of a customer, showing it in practice and not just by signs on their wall, I feel compelled to return and support - which I certainly will and encourage everyone to give this restaurant a try, if good Italian food and 5 star caring means anything to you."},{"name":"Ty Ginger Asian Bistro","address":"5689 Woerner Temple Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"4","text":"First time visit.

She goes to the back and brings out a large bowl and proceeds to dump them on top of the nasty onions.  At this point, another worker offers me a drink for my wait.  Hello..I already have a cup in my hand.  Another 5 min goes by and I still don't have my food and the guy that picked his up is complaining his order is wrong.  Once again I am told they are making mine.  It was a kids plate and a fajita taco plate.  It really shouldn't take this long to fix.  I ask for my money back.  They have to get a manager.  But wait, the manager is too busy chatting with some other customers that are already eating.  I have to go get her myself and tell her I want my money back.

Beginning with some pork dumplings and ribs cooked in a black bean sauce.  Then proceeded to get some more shrimp stuffed dumplings and friend bean curd rolls and shrimp stuffed eggplant!!  Everything offered on the carts were superb and I can't wait to go back and try some other items, it's easy to get caught up as they are small plates but they are all filling.  Prices for the dim sum are a la carte, and the servers mark your bill as you request items off the cart.  We also ordered separately some Chinese broccoli wok seared with garlic and that was great. There were 3 carts walking around, one with random items that are either fried, grilled or wok cooked, then a cart with steamed dumplings, the last are the steamed buns either stuffed with BBQ pork or a sweet custard.

We were starving so we took the bar table, it was fine but we ordered 3 fajitas and were 5 people so it was jammed. The beef fajita is amazing. I suggest people to eat it without any of the sides maybe just with the tortilla but even without that. The meat is superb. I didn't like the sides (the tomatoes, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, beans and rice). The blackened salmon fish taco was also delicious. Their chips are always great.

In the affirmative it seems to bespeak someone in-the-know. As an epithet it's used by people who don't like (or don't look good in) skinny jeans and polyblend tees, or who sniff a little holier-than-thou cool in the air. In either case, like so many other bandied-about monikers, it has become too easy a word to describe a person, a place. It means nothing, as either praise or put-down. And I've been one of the worst offenders. Until now. Herein, a review of an Austin hot spot, Swift's Attic, which will be conducted without the word....well, you know the one. Like many others lately, I've come to this newish spot seeking sustenance. As far as service I've had nothing but good. Friendly hosts, helpful waitresses. As far as food, I've liked everything I've tried: Kennebec frites, market pickles, the duck wings, the quail. Favorites are: the venison kebob, the black mussels, and the charred edamame, the latter which I could have ordered over and over and over I loved them that much,. Though apparently they're not for everyone; the table of women beside me ordered the edamame also and there were a few nose-wrinkles. But like my mother said when she saw the clothes I bought at the mall with my birthday money when I turned thirteen: There's no accounting for taste. I had a delicious beer there one time too. Can't remember what it was but the waitress had recommended it. Has eaten at Swifts, breathing the same rarified air as all the---well you know the ones---made me one of them? Am I cooler? There's no evidence. Nor do I feel cooler for not being one of those skinny jeans types. I just like Swift's. I think the food is good and it's a nice room and it's a good addition to downtown. And one day I ran into a woman at the farmers market who told me she was the manager's mom. And I liked her too. If Swift's is good enough for her, it's good enough for me."},{"name":"Miyako Sushi","address":"2341 E Hastings Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Who delivers sushi without soy sauce? \\nAlready off to a bad start.\\n\\nThe avocado was completely brown.

We showed up around 6pm on a Saturday without a reservation and were informed that it was their busiest night ever according to the books. Unfortunately that meant we didn't have a full sized table, but that didn't stop us from enjoying ourselves.\\n\\nSwitfts' is located upstairs above the Elephant Room jazz club. Once you walk up you are greeted by a very uniquely decorated restaurant. It's got a vintage vibe. There are paintings of Swifts (birds) that are slightly frightening because they're dressed like human's in them. They have an amazing round bench table that has a bird cage hanging above it. The bar is sort of shoved in an odd spot in my opinion, but I think that was to maximize the seating capacity because it's a very long and thin restaurant.\\n\\nSpeaking of the bar, the dranks were excellent. I had them mix me up a tasty Sazerac and I also had one of their house speciality drinks - everyone seemed satisfied with their drinks. Their bartenders came up with quite a few excellent unique drinks.\\n\\nWe started the meal off with the Blistered shishitos, which are friggen incredible little peppers. They're not very spicy, but very good when dipped in Swift's homemade sauce. Then we had the charred edamame with pop rocks. Yes, the same pop rocks you had as a kid growing up. Sounds gross, right? But it was one of the most memorable parts of the meal because it was so strangely delicious. For a final appetizer we tried a dinner special, which essentially was a bunch of deep fried veggies and meats. Good stuff, but some people were weirded out by the fried fennel.\\n\\nFor an entree I ordered up the Springdale Farm veggie dish. It was made with \\"Forbidden Rice,\\" which is quite tasty. The online menu doesn't seem to have it, but I believe that is because they rotate dishes frequently. Don't worry vegetarians, half their menu is made for you.\\n\\nFor dessert we decided to go with Popcorn and a Movie. It's a bit difficult to describe. Ice cream and popcorn were involved; it's delicious, order it.\\n\\nPortions are small, so be prepared to order several things. Definitely call ahead and place a reservation if possible.

She wanted to go back in forth with me because you all did not have a lid to fit the cup. She was very unprofessional, she closed the window several times to discuss this with other employees who couldn't make a decision while the patrons were still standing in this long line.

It was disappointing because I really wanted to sit out on their patio and enjoy the nice weather, but someone should always be at the front of the house. It was just deserted and there was no telling when a waiter was going to show up.

Portions a bit small but the meal was full and had a lot going.  For $17 don't think it is a great buy, but the chicken skin had a nice flavor and the salad was unique with some fresh olives to add a little saltiness.

The front desk folks are great but perhaps they need to chip in with other teams because that's just about the only part of the hotel that works with efficiency.  I travel a lot for work and this is easily one of the worst stays I've had in 10 years.  The breakfast crew is hard working but they work hard, not smart.  I just saw so many mistakes that could be easily fixed by hiring 1 person with restaurant experience to make things run more smoothly.  The coffee was empty twice in one morning.  Coffee.  At a hotel. At breakfast.  The one thing you should always have in abundance is coffee.  How can you mess that up?  We removed our do not disturb sign for one day at 8:45 and were gone until about 3pm and still our room was not cleaned.  The housekeeping team was across the hall when we left our room for the day!  Again, how can you mess that up?  The room always felt damp, despite the AC running all day and night.  There was no book in the room for general information- where the ice machine is, menu for food, you know BASIC information that all hotels have.  There were no plates in the room and no towels for the kitchen area.   There is no coffee in the afternoons, which again most hotels have these days.  I wouldn't care about this except that we paid a lot to stay here and it is honestly the least they can do for their guests.  The pantry was half empty of drinks and food, not sure how that is even possible.  It was just all around subpar and I think they get away with this bad service because they are close to the Aquarium.  But honestly, there are a ton of hotels close by and I hope they get all the business and leave this one to maybe one day learn from their mistakes. The staff is so nice and I really think they are working as hard as they can.  This isn't a staff issue, this is a leadership issue. They just need to fire the management and start over with better leadership."},{"name":"China Hut","address":"16721 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"2","text":"I blame myself really.

The rice was completely old/stale, nearly broke a tooth. The sweet and sour chicken was grease with a bland water sauce pooled at the bottom, the potstickers......are you sitting down? Were filled with un-identifiable flavors or filling. I swear it was pink inside, weirdest thing I have ever seen, I spit out the only one I attempted to eat. The bbq pork was tender but completely unremarkable.
