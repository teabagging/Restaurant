I would rate it 3 out of 5 as the fish was just okay. The garlic chips which were crispy helped create a crunch to the dish. But overall not something I was blown away by. Had the fish been different or fresh, it might have been a 5 out of 5. The fish is suppose to be the star here. \\n\\nThe uni was a 3 out of 5. The real problem is the rice. So bland. It's suppose to compliment the uni. Also, the seaweed was very chewy. And when you almost gag on the seaweed because it's so hard to break it up, that's when you know your have low quality seaweed. \\n\\nI ordered the duck soup. 4 out of 5. I love a good ramen soup. This was good, not the best. The duck was tender. The broth was semi sweet, with a hint of something that i can't put my finger on. Maybe they added soy sauce to the broth, not sure but it was something minor that I didn't like. \\n\\nThe nigiri dinner was a 1 out of 5 star. First, they did not put wasabi under the fish like the traditional Japanese sushi. Second, the fish was not fresh. Almost like it's been sitting out way too long. The rice was a no go. So bland and boring. Honestly, the nigiri was such a disappointment. \\n\\nThe fried rice was good, probably a 4 out of 5. It was good, thank God. Because the nigiri was just a let down. \\n\\nThe bao was a 5 out of 5. That was probably the one dish I was happy with. Not a traditional Japanese steamed bun. Instead it was fried. Stuffed with some beautiful ingredients. \\n\\nOverall service was okay. We waited forever for food, and our check. But the waitress was so cool and sweet.

I got my favorite drink (ever!!!) which is the grapefruit honey green tea, though I opted for minimal honey since I don't enjoy the taste of it, and my friends and I split an order of the brick toast. Additionally, my friend got the mint blueberry lemonade, which was refreshing and just the right balance of tart and sweet.\\nThis place is a solid 4 stars, but there are several things I have to point out. For the price, the drinks are really small. At my favorite spot back in Houston, I can get a perfectly made fresh grapefruit green tea w aloe in a cup over twice the size of Tea Haus' for only $3. However, the the flavor of the drink was great, so I have no gripes about that. It had been over 7 months since I had brick/honey toast back in Korea, so I was ecstatic to see it on the menu. When the order came out though, I was surprised to see how SMALL it was. The employee who took our order said 1 would be enough for the 3 of us, but honestly, if you're even remotely into desserts, 1 order would be more practical between two people (or just one, if you're like me). The brick toast was topped w 9 strawberries (one on top of each cut section), a small handful of blueberries, a generous drizzle of condensed milk, and powdered sugar, and the combination of the warm bread and toppings made me extremely nostalgic for Korea. For the size of the toast, the price is quite steep. As a lover of desserts (esp asian desserts), I'd be willing to pay for it again since I don't know where else in Austin I can get the honey toast, but I can't help but to feel a bit robbed. For similar prices, I could get better + more toppings on a bigger piece of toast in Korea, though I would have to travel almost 7000 miles for it.

No one filled our water for some time, and she tossed 5 menus at us and ran off. About 30 seconds later, she was back, no water in hand but ready to take our orders. None of us were ready, however, so she rolled her eyes and left. Came back another minute later and asked us once again if we were ready to order, once again we weren't. She stood there angrily tapping her foot waiting, until my friend told her that we'd likely still need 10 minutes or so. She came back 5 minutes later when we still hadn't fully decided and insisted that we order then, as the restaurant was crowded and we'd have to hurry it up. Excuse me - what kind of outlandish service is this? We picked a few random items off the menu to split - none of us were that hungry - but apparently there's this rule that the number of dishes (appetizer / main) have to equal or exceed the number of people in your party. What a waste of food and money.\\n\\nWe ended up ordering a round of cocktails and beers, and then a cheese plate, caprese salad, fettuccine alfredo, chicken cacciatore, and the little Al's favorite (chicken, broccoli, vodka sauce, and gnocchi). All the food was tasty and the portions were indeed gigantic. However, before we'd even eaten 1/4 of the food, our bill came. How ridiculous! Clearly, our patronage was such an inconvenience, as our waitress had been trying to rush us out of the place since our arrival 45 minutes prior. This is the exact opposite of the warm and welcoming family-style Italian restaurant we'd been hoping for. Somehow we managed to linger around for another hour, ordering a few more drinks and probably driving our waitress insane, and then got our food boxed up and headed out. Don't plan on coming back ever again.\\n\\nOh, also, the blueberry martini is absolutely VILE. Tastes like cough medicine with a side of rubbing alcohol. You're better off with a Corona or something."},{"name":"Pizza Caboose","address":"11670 SW Pacific Hwy","city":"Tigard","stars":"4","text":"Pizza caboose, I miss thee!!

Two of them came from here. In that same time, I've had the pleasure of eating maybe eighteen times that many truly awesome pizzas. Almost all of which came from here. \\n\\nIf you've never worked in the restaurant world, you're likely unaware of how little of the food you eat out is actually prepared in the restaurant where you order it. Places at the Yaghi's price point almost always use highly processed ingredients made in some industrial factory far away and delivered in a can or bag. Yaghi's does not do that. This is almost literally mind-blowingly remarkable. Aside from the cheese, everything you eat at Yaghi's was made at Yaghi's, fresh and from scratch. And it's possible, now that I think about it, that maybe they even make their own cheese there too. Why not. They are magic and deserve big respect for what they do. When you eat at Yaghi's, you are eating real food that someone worked hard to make tasty, fresh, and delicious just for you. \\n\\nMy son and I stop here on the way home from taekwondo about once a week. I get a large specialty pizza--maybe the margherita with those sweet roasted cherry tomatoes, or the Mediterranean (with a polite request not to go too nuts on the black olives), or the Gyro with red sauce, double meat, and extra tsatsiki, or the lasagna with fresh ricotta and homemade meatballs. Most restaurants that advertise homemade meatballs are heartbreaking liars. Yaghi's doesn't make any claims at all--they just make great meatballs. Along with my large specialty pizza we get the \\"family special,\\" a medium cheese for $3, to which we add pepperoni and green olives and which I have never been permitted to try, as it belongs to my son who's not afraid to use his martial arts skills at the table. That's a plentiful dinner for under $30, enough pizza to get us two through a couple days at least. Pretty sweet. \\n\\nIf great pizza is not enough--or, more likely in my case, you've had too much great pizza in the last couple days for it to sound so great today--Yaghi's offers relief in gyro form. A fresh, moist, hot pita piled with good meat and fresh veggies and a special-recipe spicy housemade tsatsiki I could eat with a spoon. If they had spoons. Verts Kebap cannot touch this gyro. You are quite frankly a fool to go to Verts Kebap more than once with an actual gyro this good so nearby.\\n\\nAt lunch, you can get a couple slices or a gyro with drink for some ridiculous sum, like $5 and change. You can sit and read the Chronicle and get your head together for your trip to HEB. Or you can go home, chill, and when it's time to eat again just head back to Yaghi's."},{"name":"Olia Poke & Tea","address":"2720 S Moody Ave, Ste 100","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Please eat here!

They were not apologetic and claimed they had a lot of the out orders that day and the sushi would arrive in 15 minutes. Half an hour later I called again and she said let me call the drive I will\\nCall you back. She did not call back so I called again. She said he was making a delivery near by. By then people at my meeting were frustrated and hungry and it was emberassing. At the one hour mark I tried to call again and they had blocked my work number. So I called from my cell phone and told them I was not paying for the order. She said she would call the driver and hung up. I called again and she blocked my cell phone number. Once the driver arrived I told him to call her off his phone since she had blocked me on the other lines which is RIDICULOUS. I told her I was not paying and she said she can only give 20% off and hung up the phone. The driver tried to charge me with only 10% off and I had to show him the math to make it 20% off as he did not believe me. At this point I was so irritated and hungry -  and the driver was just standing there looking at me - I just paid the 20% off and took the food. When I looked at the receipt I saw that they had already included $10 for a drivers tip and $4 for a delivery charge and they still prompt you for a tip when you go to pay. THATS HORRIBLE. On top of it being an hour late and half the people having to leave my meeting hungry to go to their next meeting, the fish was not fresh (so fishyyyyy) and the rolls were sloppy. I work at a company of 150 who order from them multiple times a week and after this story that I shared to everyone - no one is ever ordering from this business again.

The busboy looked like he was in high school and the server who took away our plates (probably another busboy) looked like he was in his early 20s.  I'm not complaining though because the service was outstanding but it's just something that I noticed.\\n\\nAnyways, the reason why I was so impressed was because Willow had excellent memory and was extremely thoughtful.  At the beginning of the meal, we opt-ed for the cheese toast but brought up the fact that the birthday girl did not eat cheese so she gave us garlic toast on the side! Afterwards, I noticed that a lot of people were celebrating their birthdays here and all of them received a slice of their classic cheesecake with a birthday candle at the end of the meal. (I believe that it used to be their chocolate bourbon cake and then last year, you could choose whatever you wanted but perhaps it depends on the waiter)  \\n\\nWhen our meal was over, Willow was kind enough to give us a complimentary birthday Creme Brulee with a candle because she remembered that the birthday girl did not eat cheese!  We were all extremely impressed by her thoughtfulness and willingness to accommodate to the guest's needs.\\n\\nWe also ended up ordering many items that were \\"prepared tableside\\" and Willow managed to do everything with perfection.  The Ceasar salad was excellent but the Spinach salad had just a bit too much dressing, but was still delicious.  Our Chateau Briand  was cooked to perfection and it was interesting watching her cut the meat in front of us and plate it perfectly.  \\n\\nThe mixed grill was delicious as usual and of course, I ordered the stuffed(double baked?) potato and asked for extra bacon!  I believe everybody else enjoyed their steaks (many filet mignons) and sides (mostly veggies like asparagus) so the meal was definitely a success!  \\n\\nFor dessert, we shared a few orders of their famous tableside Banana Foster, which is a flamb√© made dessert.  It consists of butter, sugar, cinnamon, bananas and rum cooked on a skillet and then poured over a large scoop of vanilla ice cream.  The time and effort put into this dessert was phenomenal and Willow had the patience to stand there whipping the sauce over the fire in order to reduce the sauce. \\n\\nHy's Encore is definitely one of the best steakhouses that I've ever eaten at and trust me, I love my steak!

Well, from Tea Haus, you can expect a lot. \\n\\n5-star just for the bomb customer service and of course, the amazing Sea Salt Creme Coffee.\\n\\nThis place is a little bit of a drive from campus, around 15-20 minutes depending on traffic, but for Tea Haus, any day I would! I've tried a range of menu items from this place, including their Sea Salt Creme Coffee, Milk Tea, and their Brick Toast, and I love it all. Their menu is pretty limited, but imo it's a good mixture of food (fried chicken), dessert, and drinks. I've heard that their milk tea isn't quite consistent from multiple of my friends, BUT I'm sure they would be happy to re-make your drinks for you if you don't like it. The Sea Salt Creme Coffee is always, always on point, however. It's the best-tasting coffee on earth & I'm not even exaggerating. \\n\\nThe customer service is also one of their consistencies. They're always updating me on the status of the orders and bring out my order when they can. One time, my friend and I were waiting for our order and they offered us to try their new cookie, which I thought was really sweet.\\n\\nIt's also a super cute study spot. It never really gets crowded to the point where you have to fight for tables (kudos), and there's free wifi.

My husbands rice dish had hair in the rice and the server left with our plate without even a simple apology.

After eating half of my salad, I notice there is plastic in the salad and pointed it out to the owner/manager (?) of the store. She said to my husband, \\"looks like you are having a bad day and I am having a bad day\\". Obviously we were not asking for anything more than a proper apology, but didnt even get that. Service is definately horrible and seems like this happens to them often? I mean who is going to continue eating their food after someones hair was fallen or even cooked with the rice and after that plastic in the salad we left most of the food.

We knew that restaurants sharing this location usually fizzle out and we were eager to see what it had to offer since Black Point had been there for two(?) years. Our experience was atrocious. :-/ \\n\\nOur reservation was for 7:45pm, we were early. The host informed us she had nothing available for a while except a patio table. We had a reservation...we should definitely have had a table inside by 8pm because of that but we didn't mind sitting outside so we told her the patio would be fine.\\n\\nWe sat down at 7:37pm. We were greeted close to 7:50pm. No apology or explanation for the 10 minute greet time. I could tell our server was in the weeds from the get go.\\n\\nWe ordered all our courses off their Restaurant Week menu...Which we had to specifically ask our server to bring to us during restaurant week?? The hosts should have set it down with our regular menus. \\n\\nWe had ordered all of our food just before or around 8pm. \\n\\nOur first, cold course was served to us at 8:31pm: a salad that had to be sent back and deviled eggs. Neither was anything to write home about but we quickly ate it as we were ravenous at that point. We also had to ask our server for bread - we'd been sitting at our table for over an hour without food and had to ask her for bread service. Our server didn't even get a chance to stop by and ask us how our first course was. Our plates were never cleared until our second course came out either.\\n\\n9:13pm our second course comes out: cold, raw-centered filet (supposed to be med-rare) and dried up, room temperature salmon. I was never asked for a temperature preparation for the salmon... \\nThen we also had to ask our server for our additional side we had ordered which came out cold as well. We waited how long for our main course from our first course - and it came out cold! Unacceptable. \\n\\nRiddle me this: How does a 'med-rare' filet take 45-ish minutes from the first course, come out completely cold? How long had it been sitting in the window? \\n\\nWe were over Black Point now. We arrived hungry at 7:37pm and it's 9:15pm now and we have yet to eat something aside from bread, one and a half eggs and a small salad. I'm five months pregnant so I really was chomping at the bit for some food and growing weary of the lack of communication and ticket times. Time for us to go and get food elsewhere more efficiently instead of waiting an additional 30-45 minutes to get food from this high end \\"$$$\\" establishment. \\n\\nSo my husband stopped our server and asked her to explain to us what exactly was going on finally. Her response was that the restaurant was slammed and she was in the weeds. She apologized for her service and we appreciated that but too little too late. It would have been nice to have some banter or communication from our server from the get go, we would have gone elsewhere had we known. We asked to see the manager. \\n\\nThe manager came out and apologized, stating our meal was taken care of but we insisted on paying for the single drink we had ordered because there wasn't an issue with that. They offered to pack up our food but we told them we didn't want it. We just wanted to get up and go eat somewhere else before 10pm because we were so hungry! We heard excuses but there really wasn't any accountability or sincerity.\\n\\nWe also were asked to return to Black Point but where is the incentive? You guys gave us excuses, terrible service and wasted our time. You're supposed to be fine dining, right? I'm not spending any more time or money on your establishment. You will have to pay my husband and I to return here. At the very least provide a gift card to cover an entire meal so we're not risking anything. \\n\\nWe finally signed the check for the beverage about 9:30pm and left.\\n\\n*We were not the only table that suffered. Every single table around us was complaining to one another. A table adjacent to us asked us if we had ordered because we were without food for so long. All of us had different servers. So it was not only a server error but clearly Black Point was crashing internally and multiple tables had to pay the price and had no idea what was going on. \\n\\nWe appreciate them comping a meal we did not eat or take home. I'm happy they did that. \\n\\nBad nights happen. It's how you handle them that makes all the difference and we weren't impressed with how the situation was dealt with because it seemed to be, \\"out of sight, out of mind\\" or that nothing would have been done had we not inquired about the situation. We had to ask what the heck was going on after countless mess ups and nearly two hours of sitting at the table. \\n\\nMy husband and I will stick with CMR (Cameron Mitchell Restaurants). They provide fine dining service and \\"yes is the answer\\". If they make a mistake, or a 30+ minute ticket time, they comp your meal and offer you a gift card as well as an explanation, imploring you to return on their dime - not your own."},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Visiting Austin for the first time, we wanted to experience great barbecue without having to wait in line for multiple hours.

Prepare to be yelled at by 3-4 people when you walk in and if allowed, they will seat you at the worst table available.

We went to one place for some food and drinks and moved on to this place. \\n\\nWORST DECISION!!! First, the A/C was broken. We were 6 total and were told the wait would be about 20 minutes so we went to the bar for frozen margaritas. The mango margaritas were served right away and were delicious, especially in the heat inferno. After about 30 minutes, I walked to the front to check how much longer until we were to be seated. There were so many tables and booths that were empty, clean, and available yet no one bothered to seat us. OK so that was a bit annoying, but not the end of the world. \\n\\nWe get seated at a booth and the waiter, Orlando, comes over to take our orders. The group is not all there because they are paying their tabs at the bar. This visibly annoys him and he walks off. \\n\\nOnce all of us are seated, he comes back and we are looking at the menu and only some of us know what we want. We mostly want drinks and appetizers and a few of us want dinner. He proceeds to ask those who are looking at the alcohol portion of the menu if they are on a diet. Then goes one by one directly asking what they'd like. When they tell him they are either still deciding or want something small, he starts getting nastier with the comments. I had personally just ordered the empanadas when he got to me and I added a mango margarita while I decided and he said, \\"really, that's it?\\" \\n\\nAt this point we were done. It was a combination of the heat, the unnecessarily long wait to be seated, and then this rude man's commentary. \\n\\nDear Orlando, you missed out big. Ask the waiter at the Renaissance Hotel's restaurant. We ran a $400+ tab and everyone tipped at 20ÔøΩ?or more.

The line is crazy as we all know, but when it comes to great food I'll wait until my knees give out. I stood in line for approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes and majority of that wait was spent outside in the Texas heat . My family and I decided to make our own sampler platter consisting of brisket, sausage, ribs, potato salad, and smoked mac. Once I saw the barbecue nothing else really mattered. I'll break my platter experience down for you:\\n\\nMEATS: The brisket was extremely tender and had a great seasoned char on it. It easily broke apart as I paired it with the fluffy potato bread. The sausage was a bit spicer than I expected especially since we opted for the regular version. I wasn't a huge fan of the texture but the sausage as a whole was pretty decent. The star of the show for me would have to be the pork ribs. These are by far the best ribs I've ever had and I am obsessed with ribs. The seasoning was the right amount of salty and sweet that complimented the pork flavor so well. The bone slipped right out of the and with it a perfect little stream of flavorful grease juice.\\n\\nSIDES: I'll admit I'm not the biggest fan of potato salad so I'm not the best judge of whether it's the best or not. I only tried it based off of how delicious the description made it sound. Unfortunately, I wasn't really feeling it, but  potato salad lovers may enjoy it. The smoked Mac on the other hand was right up my alley and exceeded my expectations. Usually I stray away from mac & cheese with queso like flavoring but this recipe proved me wrong. I ended up ordering an extra mac to go! \\n\\nSo the question when it comes to \\"hyped up restaurants\\" is often, should I really wait an hour+in line for food? \\n\\nWhen it comes to this place, you most absolutely should!"},{"name":"Gen Sou En","address":"299 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"This place needs to change its business model.. service is TERRIBLE. the line is always long and it takes forever for your food and drinks to come out.

Not only was the food cheap, I always left super stuffed.\\n\\nSadly, I guess due to inflation and increases in food ingredient costs, the price of the food has gone up. Previous burritos that were $4.99 are now $6.49. By far the most dramatic price increases are in their breakfast plates. These increased from $2.99 to $5.99, and they now charge for extra salsa!

Instead we were met with blank stares. No greeting, no one saying we will be right with you, just stares. I finally explained that we were first timers and they let us know we could sit anywhere. \\n\\n- Once seated no one came over to give menus or take drink orders. My friend had to get up to get menus for us. \\n\\n- After several minutes a young man came over and took or drink orders he also explained that our waitress would be right over. I figured she would be since we were the only table there and she was just standing behind the counter. Unfortunately that wasn't the case. Several minutes later she made her way over to drop off our drinks and take our orders. I'd noticed that she has been texting on her phone the whole time we were waiting.\\n\\n- After our order had been placed my friend decided she wanted a milkshake. She ordered it at the counter. While gone she observed that there was some leftover milkshake in the blender and specifically asked our waitress to please make a fresh milkshake. I watched from the table and the young lady DID NOT make a fresh milkshake. She used what was already in the blender. I didn't tell my friend because she would have caused a scene. Instead when the milkshake came to the table I asked her if it was cold and she observed that it wasn't. We called the waitress back to the table to remake the milkshake. This time it seems she must have remade it because my friend said it was cold and actually tasted like ice cream that time.\\n\\n- I asked for a refill of tea.

It took so long for her to bring it back I thought she had forgotten about it.\\n\\n- We ordered two OT Specials with grilled onion, fried pickles, a half basket of fries and onion rings and corn nuggets (half regular/half jalape√±o cheddar).

The onion rings were bland and flavorless. It was like no seasoning or salt of any kind was used. We never tried the corn nuggets. The cook only made the jalape√±o cheddar ones and not the plain ones. No one explained this before cooking them so we could decide if we still wanted them.

There were 3 other people ahead of him in line.\\n After waiting 15 minutes he informed the staff that he would be back in 15 minutes. The staff member told him that was fine but to take his receipt. He returned to the store after 30 minutes.  The same staff member told him that he was \\"late,\\" so they didn't have his order ready. He said we would wait. The staff member completed a transaction with someone else in the store and then started to prepare his meal. After about 5 minutes the staff member informed him that his meal was ready. He checked his meal, it was missing the cookie that came with the $5 fill up box and the staff had replaced the chicken (Drumstick and Thigh) that is supposed to be in the box with the breast that he added on to the meal. He informed the staff and was given the cookie.\\n The staff member never spoke to him after he informed them about the missing food. After giving the cookie to him the staff member went back to helping other customers. He waited until the other transactions were complete and then asked for the other chicken that was missing from the meal.

His friend reviewed the receipt and informed him that it did in fact show the purchase of the other two chicken pieces.  His friend joined him in returning to the store. His friend talked to the staff member about the receipt. The staff member then called her manager. The manager checked the receipt and agreed that he was shorted two pieces of chicken and wanted to give him the missing chicken. He asked why the manager had to get involved in order to complete an order that should have been easy for any staff member to complete.  \\nWe have all had a similar experience. Ordering something in the drive through line and checking it only to find that something is missing. Here's the difference instead of just fixing the issue this staff member argued with Zhengying He.

When we told him what he did his response was \\" I didn't do that, that was there before I towed the vehicle!!\\"  We spent a hr fighting for information and I stayed in front of his truck until we got his info!! We waited for them to contact ICBC but to no avail they didn't for 3 weeks, and when they did they denied the damages, thank god we had 4 witnesses come forward to give me their numbers :) if you have any problems with them make sure you take pictures, and get witnesses!

Carmelina's is a popular resto on Hanover and was cited in the Boston rags to serve up some of the best carbonara in Boston.  Because the servings are huge, we decided to split 2 plates, the second being the clams. \\n\\nThe \\"Exploding\\" Little Neck clams were delicious, tasty, with a hint of chili.  This was definitely a home run and a get next time.  The spaghetti carbonara was a bit of a miss: the pasta was overcooked a bit (more toward soft than to the tooth), the sauce was warming and on point,  the Sulmona pancetta was smokey and crisp to the palate, rounded out with light cream and generous sprinkling of fine pepper, that brought the dish together.    I see why the carbonara at Carmelina's  has been written up a lot, it's got most of the appropriate ingredients, distinctive and good.   To me and my sister, not a true carbonara, a standard in Rome.  It was missing the unctuousness of cream and eggs in the sauce, the orange yolk of a free-range egg of a well made pasta that turns a carbonara and pasta into slightly yellow, saffrony color; a final shaving of parmiggiano was not offered unless you asked.  While we are in America,  I have no room to be overly critical, I was perhaps expecting too much here, so to the proprietor at Carmelina's,   \\"La prego di accettare le mie scuse\\"\\n\\nThe service was impeccable, our server was on point, did not skip a beat, was very friendly and hospitable.\\n\\nVisits:  1\\n\\nTip:  They have a great queueing system, if you don't want to wait , just leave your celly and walk across to Mike's Pastry or down a couple to Modern Pastry."},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Fantastic!

I did not even want a to-go container (I live right down the street and they serve the wings in a paper basket). I was actually told I would not be let out of the door if I tried to take the TWO wings with me. In fact, the sever would not give me my check until I handed them over first (she even made sure that I could see her throw them in the trash). That was the craziest experience I have ever had at any bar in Orlando, and I still cannot understand the logic behind their reaction to the situation.\\n\\nI want them to know that I will never go back and neither will anyone I know or come in contact with.

If you want a REUBEN....go to the BLUE RIBBON GRILL on Lavista (absolutely excellent).  My daughter's hot dog was not desirable.  The hot dog was of very cheap quality (i.e., red dye number 2) and not what you would expect paying $5.00 a plate.\\n\\nAccording to other reviews, we probably should have stuck with the burgers.

I am so disappointed to have to write this review but BUYERS BEWARE! I have used this company a few times and the work was always acceptable and inline with the value but I honestly will never use this company again. \\n\\nThree weeks ago I called on National Carpet Care to seal the grout in my newly built home prior to moving in. I had some hesitations when the tech was using a metal piece with no rubber gaurd and taping and dragging it across the tile to suck up the water, but I didn't act on my anxiety because I figured they do this for a living and know what they are doing. I also felt it was odd that they didn't just seal the grout but left sealant mopped over the tile itself. I had only sealer grout once in my life but every brand of sealant I looked at and still have says to remove the sealant from the tile itself. Again what do I know I figured and I kept my mouth shut.  The job was complete and we let it rest overnight for almost 24 hours before moving in the next day. \\n\\nAfter moving in the sealant left on top of the tile was crackling and every place anything was moved across the tile was track marks in the sealant left in the tile. I called and much to my pleasure they agreed to come out and correct the issues. \\n\\nToday the job was completed and I had to wait a while for the floors to dry before I could fully inspect the floors. The tech had been gone about an hour and when I entered the house to fully inspect the job my husband found that the tech had chipped a tile. I immediately called the company and reported the concern only to be told, \\"no sir that wasn't from us\\". I replied, it was because my house is only 3 weeks old and there were no nicks in my tile and no one else had been here to do any work today. I was told again that it was not their doing, as if I was making it up and lying about it. I offered to send a picture and was told \\"you can send a picture but we didn't cause the nick or my tech would have reported it and he's never cause damage to any job ever\\". I reminded the person that I have no reason to lie, my home is 3 weeks old and still under a full warranty. If I had chipped the tile I could just have the builder come and replace it, I clearly have no reason to fabricate a story to get the issue fixed but I wanted them to take responsibility. \\n\\nI was then accused of having furniture moved in today, I corrected him and clarified that while the tech may have told him I had furniture moved in today, the furniture was only placed in the garage, it was not brought into the house because the floor tech was still working. So there was no way the furniture crew did this since they never passed the threshold from the garage to the house. It was almost as if this rebuttal was planned out by the tech who reported I had furniture delivered and the person now rejecting responsibility for the chipped tile. \\n\\nEither way I have spare tiles (benefit of a newly built home) and it will be an easy fix for me but never again will I trust National Carpet Care with my business. I am not as upset about the chip as the lack of professionalism and not taking accountability for the issue. However I guess I shouldn't be surprised as I look over past negative reviews there is a clear pattern that the company only puts effort into blaming everything on the customer, taking zero accountability for any performance issues. This in itself create a poor business practice that I will not fall for again. Attached is a picture of the chip in case anyone was wondering the floor sealant left on top of the tiles has left a horrible bubble looking haze a cross my entire house!

On one visit the plates we were given were soaked with water... they probably exchanged more than one set of hands before it got to us so more than one person said \\"fuck it\\" and thought that was acceptable to give to a customer.\\n\\nThe decor looks great and the place is very clean so I had really high expectations for the food since everything looked so nice and the restaurant is in a busy location in Dublin, the food was a massive disappointment to say the least.\\n\\nThe manager covered our entire meal the first time after all our food was bleh which was great, he didn't seem like he was really listening to our feedback and was kind of defensive.

Came back a second time and the same problems were there, charred food, tough steak, weird or bland flavors.\\n\\nOn the first visit, the crab wonton wasn't hot and the filling was lumpy. Supposedly they're hand-rolled wonton but I don't believe it, they tasted like they were dumped out of a freezer bag and weren't cooked all the way. If they really are fresh and cooked to order then something has gone TERRIBLY wrong. Sent it back and received chicken lettuce wraps that were just gross, dry chicken and some kind of gross wasabi-like sauce.\\n\\nMy wok cooked filet mignion was charred and besides a yummy and tasty sauce that comes with it was totally bland. I showed our server and before I said what was wrong they just said \\"oh yeah that's burnt\\". The Long Life noodles were bland as hell, and probably overcooked. It was really too bad because the lobster that is topped with it tastes great but the mushy and tasteless noodles are just gross. \\n\\nSecond visit, Dynamite shrimp appetizer tasted really good, but it was barely warm like it was sitting at a window forever! Ordered another filet mignion wok cooked dish and it was burnt again. The desserts this place serves look great but are really lame.

We were leaving Fred Meyers and noticed the name on the building. We weren't sure of what to expect (and didn't do any research prior) but after a visit to Uwajimaya and seeing that same name on a package, we decided to stop in. Since we aren't fluent in Japanese, the only part of the name that stood out to us was \\"pan\\". \\"Some sort of bread shop?\\" was all we could figure out. Upon entering, we were amazed that they had the types of snacks you'd see in an anime (please don't judge :P), heh.\\n\\nAll silliness aside, the variety of snacks you can purchase here are amazing! Everything we've tried has been yummy! Whether you're in the mood for something sweet or savory, they have it and it seems fresh. My husband's favorites are the katsu sando and the cinnamon apple ringo doughnut! I've always been a fan of red bean paste (being Chinese) so naturally I love anything with azuki beans such as their an pan or croissant. The matcha green tea melon pan has also become a staple for me. I really want to try the matcha cornet but I have only seen the choco version on the shelf so far. For savory, I like their edamame sea salt butter roll or the bacon cheese bread.\\n\\nGranted, this is the very first Japanese bakery I've encountered anywhere (growing up in smaller towns w/very little diversity) so this is a new experience for me. The closes thing I have for reference is occasionally visiting Chinese bakeries in Toronto or Chicago which offer completely different pastries.

Tea Haus nails it: best boba milk tea in Austin. There, I said it. I've also had the basil fried chicken, brick toast, blueberry mint lemonade, jasmine milk tea boba, and ginger lemonade. All stellar. The menu is small for a reason - it allows Tea Haus to pay attention to detail and not just churn out a bunch of different kinds of mediocre food.

That is the one word that keeps coming to mind when I am reflecting on our evening at L'atelier. I didn't have much of an expectation going into the meal, so I was prepared for anything. Except for what I encountered... \\n\\nThe decor. The ambiance. The service. The weirdness! The entire place is covered in stark white walls with bizarre mirrors and pastel colored contrasts. Normally I am not one to be too judgmental about the decor and ambiance of a place if the food is good enough, but this place was just straight up bizarre. I am not big a fan of dolls. In fact, I find dolls extremely creepy - and L'atelier is covered in them. They have all of these little in-wall display boxes with glass windows, and in each of them are these creepy ceramic ballerina-esque dolls. ALL OVER.\\n\\nThe weirdness of the ambiance and decor quickly transcended into the service. The waiter came up and immediately dove into what we wanted to drink for the evening. No hello, no introduction, no nothing. He was getting to the point, I suppose. A bit cold for a me, but I figured maybe he was just in a rush to tend to other tables. I was wrong - this is how he was the entire meal. I can deal with a snooty waiter, but this in combination with the already freakish, cold feel of the place just sent things spiraling downhill for me. \\n\\nSo now onto the food - it was good, don't get me wrong. We started off splitting the caesar salad, crispy sweetbreads, and steak tartare. All were good. Nothing spectacular, nothing horrible. The thing that stood out most to us were the \\"spinach chips\\" - little fried pieces of spinach on the sweetbreads dish. They were delicious and kind of an anomaly to us. For entrees, we had the rack of lamb, rib eye, and barramundi. All were good and cooked very well. Each was served with the same side - bland fingerling potatoes, several sprigs of broccolini, and one hard carrot. It was - again, theme of the night - weird. One, single standalone carrot in and of itself to me is just weird, and the fact that they are serving broccolini when it isn't in season and there aren't any local farmers right now who have that, means that they are outsourcing and ordering this random vegetable from somewhere else. It just seemed bizarre. And the potatoes did not taste good. It seemed very, very traditional and as inside the box as you can get. \\n\\nOverall, there was nothing in the meal that stood out to me. It was not *bad* per say, but it was not great either. The mediocrity in combination with the all around weirdness of the place made it very difficult for me to give it a good review and reminisce fondly about the evening. If the food had been outstanding, I could have easily gotten past the fact that the ambiance was weird and the service sucked. But, the food was just alright, nothing to write home about. So now I write to yelp about how I won't be back to L'atelier.

The menu looks delightful, until you spot your sweet, hurried server dashing to the back of the bar after dropping off your glass of wine, throwing on a pair of plastic gloves and tossing ingredients around, a la Subway sandwich style. The only difference is that you're not ordering a $5 footlong - you're ordering artisanal ingredients. And it freaks me out that everything is out in the open like that.

There seems to be a quick in/out (turn table) mentality looking at the patrons, especially when the first interaction is rushed to order immediately asking, \\"Do you know what you like?\\". Giving some firm assertion that I was still looking over the menu after waiting for 1 hour for the confirmation text (had a drink and app somewhere else) was offsetting in that now in the position to order, I HAD to make a decision in the 5-10 minutes of being seated without any particular guidance from the waitstaff, being the FOH manager didn't seem to understand it was not a food truck but a payment ~$50+experience/guest/hour. The menu was rather limited with what I would call an hour wait (1 out of 100 down the street) and for the cost (menu specifically says you cannot alter unless there is an allergy) is rather dissapointing. Sitting at the bar the wait staff was completely in sync with assisting with additional requests and wine glass orders, but anything to the kitchen - the two lackadaisy line chefs didn't seem to mind orders backed up when they were discussing with the BOH manager, a new lady hire down the street at another restaurant or lead cook checking his phone for texts. The rather young Italian (speaking) sous chef was set on delivering all of the burners to produce dishes to his productivity, EXCEPT when a piece of tuna was deliberately cut in half and placed near the back of the cold food hood (squid is left out in the open in half quart containers not protected), half cooked (to eat or serve, don't know). Same tongs were being used with seafood and nonseafood, no exchange was being met. Standards must be kept, so being not a sushi place, but at that time I felt it enough to ask for a box, upon which a card scanner was next to me and after 2 - $12 glasses of wine and meal, I was asked to checkout at like a 7-11 with tip in front of the cashier \\"because it was new.\\" If the North End trends this way, I'd rather spend for an experience where I'm not rushed out the door, to where I can relax and enjoy a bite that is either steak, pasta or even a burger, doesn't matter - considering the money I leave at the table."},{"name":"MyFitFoods","address":"4835 SW Meadows Dr, Ste 137","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"5","text":"The best place in Lake OSWEGO to get meals everyone in my family likes: from gluten free for my husband with celiac to my pescatarian daughter to my carnivore son.

However, tonight while we were there, it was just music - of the classic romantic genre, e.g. Rosemary Clooney, Dean Martin and Nat King Cole. \\n\\nOK, on to the menu.  The grilled dates are to die for!  Wrapped in an absolutely perfect and crispy prosciutto, the dates were accompanied by Mascarpone cheese.  We were also provided complimentary bread with butter.  Curiously - there were three dates in the appetizer...and three slices of bread - just a bit awkward when it is dinner for two.\\n\\nJP ordered the bow tie pasta ($19).  Resting in a very low-key garlic sauce, the pasta came with bits of pork, which were good.  But for the dish portion, the price was much too high.  I went with the cod special ($24).  The cod was fresh, cooked just right, served in an interesting tomato sauce and accompanied by finger potatoes.   A good dish overall.\\n\\nDessert was suggested to us by our dapperly-dressed waiter, but we passed.  The only area where there could be improvement would be beverage rounds.

The steaks were all amazing as well. My bone-in rib steak was amazingly tender (and actually the baked potato was amazing!!!). The porterhouse came with a filet and a New York strip cut, cooked to medium rare perfection.

That way, those of us who appreciate the flavor cook's work can patronize the restaurant when s/he is working. This would also be advantageous for people whose idea of a taste explosion is rice-flavored rice with rice sauce and a side of rice, or something like that.

My boyfriend asked for extra spicy mayo and after adding a huge spoon of it to my sandwich, it was much better.

Mine was about 1.6 lbs I guess and it came to be 37 dollars.

Turkey was surprisingly moist for being...well, turkey. It had a hint of smokiness, but again, needed some condiments to make it worth eating. The sausage link wasn't bad either, but it wasn't something to rave about. Pork ribs were nice and tender, but could have been a tad bit more moist. All in all, everything was decent to good, nothing bad.\\n\\nThe brisket...well we got the fully fatty+lean version. The fatty portion was outrageously perfect in texture, though a tad bit too salty. The lean portion had its muscle fibers still firmly attached to each other, so it required a noticeable amount of chewing to be consumed. Not too bad of a thing, but to each his own really. Personally, I thought it could've been a bit more moist.\\n\\nThe free beer apparently applies to Saturday mornings too btw.

Make sure you add the sauces. \\n\\nThen the breakfast drinks came and things got weird. I ordered a mimosa, and it was suspiciously opaque upon arrival. As any frequent bruncher knows - a mimosa should be mostly champagne with some OJ mixed in. I took a sip, and sure enough it tasted like... orange juice. Photo for reference. \\n\\nI politely pointed this out to the server, who took my glass and said she'd see what she could do, maybe they could top it off with some champagne for me. \\n\\nWhen she came back... she had the same glass with her, and said \\"The bar says the ratio is 2/3 champagne with 1/3 orange juice. If you wanted us to top you off we'd have to charge you for it.\\" And then she walked off. \\n\\nI was honestly pretty stunned by this response. My friends were as well and thought I had been reasonable. I worked in restaurants for many years and never would have said something like this to a customer. Even if the bar disagreed... it literally would've been no skin off their back to top off the drink. Instead, the result was a very uncomfortable interaction between the server and our entire table, that left a bad taste in all of our mouths. Not to mention paying $7 for a glass of orange juice. \\n\\nShe came back after that and asked if \\"everything tasted alright\\" and I almost asked... \\"would it matter if it didn't?!\\"\\n\\nOverall I do actually like this restaurant very much and will go back.

The result was a mushy noodle concoction similar to what one might expect from a convenience store microwaveable hot and spicy bowl, with medium rare, unseasoned beef that's taste gave away that it had clearly been frozen and lazily reheated. The beef dripped irony juice likely from its thaw, and was still pink in its center. \\nThere was an excessive amount of basil in both dishes ordered, the second of which I'm emitting for time-sake. \\n\\nIn conclusion, this restaurant has a lot of potential, the Asian fusion menu has plenty of dishes which if prepared with more care would make for a fantastic eat.

This was unfortunate because two of us had food that was completely cold and inedible.  While the food part isn't her fault at all, she was chatting with other staff and on her phone the entire time we ate and attempts to get her attention failed so we gave up.  We let her know when she came to clear plates that food was ill prepared and while she apologized and offered to bring more, we were done with the meal and I was disappointed she didn't escalate.

The chicken wings were also delicious, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. My one criticism of the wings is that they come with a side of sauce rather than being cooked directly in it, which I think would make them even tastier.

They do have the option to preorder online so you can try to mitigate the line. But you can order and get beers in line, so can't really complain too much! \\n\\nSince it was my first time, we had to try a little bit of everything from the sliced brisket, chopped brisket, and the pork ribs. Unfortunately the beef ribs were sold out by the time we arrived to the front of the line. The brisket was so tender as it melted in my mouth with bursting smoky flavor - you can appreciate the deep smoke ring before biting in! The ribs were to die for as the meat literally just slides off the bone as you try to bite into it. I would ask for some slices of bread as well to combine the pickles, onions, brisket, and bbq sauce to make a mini sandwich that makes for a delicious explosion of flavor! \\n\\nThis joint has definitely made a name for itself, distinguished from other regular barbecue places.

Not certain why Oviedo exists but we can have that discussion another day. Let me spell out a simple equation and see if this makes sense to the owners. NO ROAST PORK FRIED RICE = NO CUSTOMERS.  I went for lunch on Saturday and was surprised we were the only people sitting in a large comfortable dining room. Then I started realizing why.  The lunch specials were very reasonably priced between six and seven dollars and included an egg roll, wonton soup and EGG FRIED RICE.  What the hell is EGG FRIED RICE?  The entire country good Chinese food is 100% served with roast pork friend rice, that is until I got to Central Florida.  Nobody wants anything but roast pork fried rice. If you are too cheap to serve it raise your price a dollar and serve roast pork fried rice.  Do Pizzeria's expect to be open if they start serving pizza with no cheese?  I told them I would pay for the pork and they refused to give it to me.  The wanton soup came and guess what not a single piece of pork.  Is this place run by Muslims? The General Tso's chicken was actually white meat chicken which is the only reason for the 3 stars other than the decent eggroll, however, it was dried out; really dried out. I ordered it spicy but couldn't taste any spice at all.  In another cost cutting measure they had copious amounts of bell peppers and onions.  These are not Chinese vegetables, they are cheap filler. Try some baby corn, mushrooms, water chestnuts and more broccoli.  Wondering why your place is empty?

There are information kiosks to help you find your way around or to find a certain game.  \\n\\nThere's a big bar/restaurant in the middle with live performances (pretty good acts.  Check the website to see which 90s groups will be playing free concerts there in February.)  \\n\\nI've been to Vegas five times, and I would say Hollywood compares favorably with a mid-tier casino there.  There is your standard casino game fare (blackjack, roulette, different types of poker, etc.), and many slots (although I would not recommend playing the slots...bad odds of winning.)  My main gripe with the casino is that the minimum for bets in still too high ($15 at the lowest).  This is not the Bellagio we are talking about.  This is a casino that should cater to middle class midwestern folks, not the rich.  I would have to risk $45 to bet on craps with 2X odds, and that's way too much for most people on one bet.   Or doubling down in blackjack would cost $30, and that just too big of a risk when most people's gambling budgets will probably be $100-200 for an evening.\\n\\nLike Vegas, parking is free and ample, and the player's club offers nice perks.  The musical acts that the casino is getting early on are very promising.  \\n\\nIt looks like there are some nice places to eat including a fancy steakhouse and a big buffet.  \\n\\nLastly, it's really cool that free water bottle and soft drinks are offered to casino patrons.

Points for honesty.  \\n\\nThe create-a-sampler is a favorite appetizer; you can choose two or three items to sample.  Try the toasted meat ravioli for one of your choices; these have been at Olive Garden as long as I can remember.  Crunchy ravioli bites with a tasty and seasoned meat filling.  The zucchini and mozzarella are also excellent choices.\\n\\nNext came the salad and breadsticks (unlimited portions of both are included; you can choose one of several soups instead of salad as well).  The salad was crisp and fresh without too much of their very salty dressing.  The breadsticks can be hit or miss; this time they were hot and soft and fresh.  Highly addictive!\\n\\nFor entrees we went for the classic spaghetti and meat sauce with meatballs too.  Classic, simple spaghetti which (this time) was cooked a bit past al dente and served with a rich and robust meat sauce.  The meatballs were good; hearty and with a good Italian seasoning taste.  For a lighter meal choice try the Lemon Chicken Giardino.  It's still a lot of food but lower in calories and salt.  Large chicken breasts in a lemon herb sauce atop bow tie pasta with vegetables.  It's still quite hearty but labeled as 600 calories or less.  It was very tasty, and it definitely did not taste like a low-calorie dish.\\n\\nLastly, dessert.  We opted to try their new cannelloni trio with classic, chocolate, and strawberry fillings.  The shells were quite dry and flavorless.  The classic filling was the best; the strawberry had a heavy artificial strawberry taste, and the chocolate tasted like a chocolate Jell-O pudding.  A bust.  Opt for the lemon cream cake or tiramisu, though, and you won't be disappointed.  The \\"dolicini\\" mini desserts are also excellent (try the amaretto one in particular).\\n\\nOverall, Olive Garden will give you a solid meal with plenty of food that typically tastes just fine.  Just don't expect that authentic, home-cooked, Italian meal."},{"name":"Tea Haus","address":"10815 Ranch Road 2222, Ste 207","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My conundrum: I love boba teas but the issue I always have is it's too sweet!

Unfortunately they were out of Bailey's (which one of us ordered), so we settled for beers and waters with lemon. The waters arrived lukewarm, with no ice, and no lemons (they were out of them as well.) This is a bar correct? How do you not have lemons...at a rooftop bar...on a Saturday night? \\n\\nAnyway, the decor was nice and the space has potential to be great but it's just not quite there yet. The service was slow, sloppy, and poor. Tables sat uncleared, servers' attire had room for improvement and the place just felt average.

I've never had a bad experience, but two suggestions: the meat could be strained a lot better with a different utensil before put on top of the rice..every time I go the juices make the rice so soggy because there's SO much juice from the chicken or pork in the pan. Please hear me out when I suggest that. Just drain it better before serving it. Also, could you try and add some spam musubi??

You can park in the back, right behind the restaurant.\\n\\nWin is one fancy looking place. I guess they're trying to be an \\"elevated\\" Indonesian place.\\n\\nI'm not familiar with Indonesian cuisine. I haven't had many Indonesian foods. They seem to be similar to other South Eastern Asian foods. So they have similar stuff like Rendang and curries. So my review will be based on my experience with other SE Asian flavors and dishes. \\n\\nI do like their Rijstaafel concept. It's a bunch of small dishes that is brought out at the same time. You get to try a lot of variety of what they have to offer. The menu changes every few months. And they have a vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. \\n\\nWell, we decided to try both options. Before the food came out, they gave us some complimentary shrimp crackers with 3 sauces: pickled vegetable (ok, that's not a sauce), sambal, and I forgot what the 3rd sauce was. I think it was Oyster sauce. But I liked the shrimp crackers and the sauces. \\n\\nAs I mentioned before, they bring out all the dishes for the Rijstaafel at once. They are all presented beautifully and comes with a dish of rice, some coconut shavings, and others. \\n\\nOverall, the food was fine. It wasn't mind-blowing or anything. For instance, the chicken Satay was too salty. \\n\\nTheir sambal kentang was basically cheap version of Pan-fried Southwestern hash you get at American breakfast places. I mean, it has the word Sambal in it. I didn't see or taste any. Maybe I missed it? Or I was supposed to add my own? Or am I mistaking this  for another dish?\\n\\nI liked the Ayam Kremes, which is their fried chicken. I think it could've had a bit more seasoning, but the skin was nice and crispy. The meat could've been juicier, but it was a decent fried chicken. \\n\\nI also liked the Perkedel. It was a potato croquette. I loved the soft texture. They're basically fried mashed potatoes. It tasted good. \\n\\nEverything else tasted like standard South-East Asian fare. They didn't stand out flavor wise. I mean, I had better Beef Randangs, curries, etc. elsewhere. \\n\\nI think this place is more of a 3.5 place. I like the concept of Rijsttafel, the service was good, and everything else (plating, decor, etc) was well done. But the flavor didn't match the decor, plating, and everything else.

Very happy with our menu selections at Pancake Social. My husband got the pecan praline pancakes and bacon and I got the chicken sandwich, all were delicious. The portions are so large I couldn't finish the sandwich but my husband was more than happy to help me out because it was so good! \\n\\nWhat Pancake Social really needs is an efficiency expert to come in and help them optimize their space and ordering procedures. I could tell from the signs they are experimenting with different formats (table ordering, counter ordering, etc.) to try to make this work. We waited about 45 minutes to place our order and then waited more for our food to arrive. I can't tell if the long wait to order is designed to keep some of the pressure off the kitchen, but it's not clear to me why ordering takes as long as it does. This restaurant could benefit from either kiosks or mobile order capability. They have the person who takes orders at the counter also making/serving drinks for you to bring to your table, which just adds to the time it takes to order and lengthens the wait for others. For example, rather than make drinks while you do the sign/tip portion of your transaction, the person makes the drinks while you stand there and wait and then she stands there and waits for you while you close out the transaction. Again, this may be intentional to take stress off the kitchen but no less annoying when you're the one waiting.\\n\\nAfter you've ordered, they give you a number to put on your table so your food can be brought to you and you can choose a seat wherever you like. I think this causes the food runners to waste time finding where you sat because you could be anywhere inside or in front of the restaurant. A bit like a scavenger hunt but they're bringing you food.\\n\\nOur server Corey was kind and attentive and did let us know that once we'd ordered, he could get additional items for us without us having to stand in line again. We ended up not needing to take him up on that since my husband finished off my chicken sandwich.

You're not likely to find offal or other off-beat cuts of meat on the menu. \\n\\nBut while many of the dishes that are sold by a hole-in-the-wall take out joints also can be found on the menu, the actual dishes themselves are worlds apart. The quality of the version on offer from Hunan House serve as a reminder of what those take-out joints are trying to copy. \\n\\nGiven the history of Hunan House, that's not surprising. You see, the restaurant has HISTORY. It's something of a Columbus institution. Long before some of the dishes were take out cliches, they were novel. And Hunan House served them with a focus on quality and style. \\n\\nThe atmosphere and service still show that Hunan House is focused on demonstrating the best version of these dishes. The dining room is well appointed and dimly lit. Water glasses and white table cloths adorn the tables. And the service is attentive, as befitting the decor. \\n\\nThe food is also excellent. The mala lamb in particular is one of my favorites. Also fantastic is the sizzling rice soup, which is apportioned into bowls table side.

Again, we say okay we will just have a menu. She brings menus for us to share and then takes two drink orders. \\n\\nMy main problem was how I felt as if I was treated, the group I went with had similar thoughts. The waitress presented herself as cold, unwelcoming to the younger crowd, hated trivia for whatever reason, and seemed like she was \\"over us\\" before we even spoke to her. We were nothing but polite to her, but we all left feeling worse, as if it was somehow our fault that we \\"appeared\\" young and wanted to play trivia.\\n\\nThe bartender was apologetic about the trivia, this review is not about her. She presented herself as friendly and took our IDs for legal purposes. The waitress we had was condescending and plain mean.

I like to go half sweet on the drinks, as the honey boba provides a really nice sweet touch you don't often get from other boba places.\\n\\nThe Misugaru Latte - a barley-based coffee drink - is a recent addition to the featured items menu. It's tasty and has an addicting, grainy texture. I definitely expect it to become a fixture on the permanent menu.\\n\\nLike for the drinks, the food menu is short but has good options. I really like the Basil Fried Chicken in particular - although a little salty (you can ask for less salt), it is tasty and won't make you hate yourself like KFC or Popeye's would. I don't consider the Brick Toast a great value (it's just toast, condensed milk, and strawberries), but it's a good thing to try at least once!\\n\\nIn short: Tea Haus is holding the boba fort down for the entire city of Austin, and I'm excited to visit here for my next study trip/hangout/Wal-Mart run/boba craving!"},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this place.

First, the service was extremely poor. We waited at least 45 mins for a spot at the bar (no tables because all were reserved). While waiting, we watched several individuals get turned away. But, two females walked in begging for a table. They were seated right away...this was 40 mins into our estimated 25 minute wait. I was beyond livid, but given the time of night, and 2+ hour wait at every other establishment, our options were limited. Given the reviews, we decided to wait a few more minutes so we could try the food.\\n5 mins later we were seated. Things could only get better, right? Unfortunately no. Our waitress was inattentive. She took our order after we were already sitting for at minimum of ten minutes. She brought us out our food but never asked if we wanted any pepper or cheese. When she came to ask us how the food was (after she noticed I wasn't eating it), I asked for lemon. She rolled her eyes at me when she walked away. Super inappropriate, but at least she got me what I asked for. She came back when our (entree) plates were empty and then with the check right away which was much appreciated. \\nNow to the food. It was among the worst Italian I have ever had.  The pan roasted  chicken was not marinated, overly salted, and very bland. The artichokes were horrible. No taste - I do not even know how the cooks managed to do that. I had to ask for lemons which I used to flavor both the chicken and artichokes. The salad was the only decent part of the entree. The broccoli rabe and chicken side was inedible (flavorless). I was raised to not waste food, so I didn't have it in me to send anything back or to throw away what was placed in front of me. I ate the entree which I drowned in lemon juice and wrapped the side up to give out to the first homeless person I found.\\nI'm not sure if the pasta dishes are better, but avoid anything with chicken if you can. \\nI will never come back."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I am a fan of their duck fries.

I've been there twice, on a Friday, during prime dinner hours (6:00-8:00), and neither time did I have to wait for a table (hadn't made a res).  There are probably only 10-12 tables in the place, plus some bar seats.  But it feels cozy, not cramped, and the decor is inviting (the sole bathroom is well-maintained too).  There are four tables positioned next to the open window, and I would try to grab one of those if the weather is cooperating.\\n\\nI've probably had about ten items from the extensive menu, and nothing was bad.

The carbonara pasta and prosciutto-wrapped figs stand out, but the Sicilian tuna meatballs and garlic shrimp were also quite tasty.  My mom used to make spaghetti carbonara when I was a kid, and I just love the richness and consistency of that preparation.  But it's not often on the menu at Italian restaurants, and if I make an off-the-menu request, it's hit-or-miss.  Damiano hits the mark with this dish.  The figs we had were a special that night, and I was told were served when in season.  So, if you're going in the next month or two, definitely order them.  I did like the tuna meatballs, which were not particularly dense, and may have been a bit dry all by themselves.  But they were served in a sea of sweet and sour tomato sauce that created a great contrast.  The garlic shrimp was potent, and the shrimp were anything but small.  Plus, they were served atop a generous helping of sauteed spinach.  We had a great, and affordable bottle of Pinot Grigio..which reminds me - our waiter John was accomodating to our request to stagger the delivery of our six dishes, and he knew the wine list well.\\n\\nI will offer a heads up that many dishes here are swimming in a pool of oil, butter, garlic, etc.  So, expect to put your diet on hold, and embrace the night!"},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We pre-ordered for a Sunday pick up.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who finds this remarkable, inspiring, and just plain cool. And even though they have every right to spend their anniversary at a romantic dinner with just the two of them, Mom and Dad are the type of people who wanted to share their special moment with the people they love the most: namely, their children. Plus, they knew I wanted to try Salty Sow. And as usual, any major event will always be required--on some level--to somehow be about me. \\n \\nFirst off: the indoor space is fantastically cozy. Clean and modern d√©cor is paired nicely with low, dim lighting, while still fostering a buzzing atmosphere of patrons. A married couple sat together along the wall; a family with small children sat near us; and a baby shower eventually descended upon the private room behind us. All of this combined to create that magical feeling of being in a restaurant that is lively while still remaining intimate. \\n\\nOur server Kristen offered us a warm welcome along with the dinner, cocktail, and specials menus. After some craft beer selections, we ordered appetizers both off the regular and daily specials menu.\\n\\nAppetizers:\\nWhite Truffle Deviled Eggs w/ Salty Sow Bacon-Chives: Anyone can make deviled eggs, but it's that hint of truffle oil and tease of bacon that made these a cut above the rest. I could eat a dozen of them. \\n\\nTriple Fried Duck Fat Fries: Oft-mentioned and receiving mixed reviews, I fall squarely on the side of those who would laud them. They were delicious, with or without a dip in the 110 minute egg or cold b√©arnaise that accompanied them. They are definitely in a league of their own when it comes to a pommes frites appetizer. \\n\\nWarm Goat Cheese Fritters: Pretty straight forward here. If you like that unique tang of warm goat cheese, give them a whirl. But if you have to choose, I'd go with the next item:\\n\\nFresh & Smoked Salmon Rillette w/ Caviar & Cr√®me fra√Æche: The breakout appetizer of the night. It was simultaneously refreshing and filling, and any fan of smoked salmon will not want to skip this. And what an ample portion; we had to ask for more toast to spread it on since there was so much to go around. Even split among five of us, we still had to decide who would finish it off (I did).\\n\\nAfter a whirlwind of eye-popping, palette-pleasing appetizers, I was confident Salty Sow could only go up from there. How right I was. \\n\\nI selected the Petite Bone-In Filets w/ mushroom & bone marrow red wine sauce, which were excellent at medium rare and just as tender as can be. While fulfilling my natural inclination towards steak, my only criticism is that it was small in portion, even for a filet. It was perfect after the plethora of appetizers, but if you are looking for a heartier portion, I'd go with the: \\n\\nChicken Fried Texas Quail, which also came with succulent pork cheek and a hefty side of sweet potatoes. My dad raved about it. And that was no diminutive quail he had there. It had some meat on it, and juicy meat at that. This was a special, so hopefully they'll have it again.   \\n\\nMy sister in law enjoyed her Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with white beans, escarole & pecorino. She remarked that she would definitely order it again. However, the absolute star of the entrees was without a doubt:\\n\\nThe Niman Ranch Pork Blade Steak with Moroccan honey sauce and arugula. Not only did it offer an amazing cut of meat, it was mouth-wateringly tender, and just the right amount of sweet honey glaze. I traded as much of my filet as possible to get another bite of the pork blade. This was a dish whose praises were sung long after the meal was complete. For me, this was Salty Sow's high point. A \\"must order\\" entree, by far.\\n\\nWe opted to split the dessert special, the Shredded Filo Napoleon w/ berries & vanilla bean sauce. It was more of a \\"deconstructed\\" Napoleon, but the crisp shredded dough, sweet cream, and plump berries made for a perfect light ending to a sumptuous meal.      \\n\\nWhat can I say, except Salty Sow wowed and amazed. And I can't think of an occasion where this was more appropriate, because Mom and Dad can say they had an amazing dinner for such an awesome milestone. And of course, I am lucky enough that they are my family, and we can share these moments together. \\n\\nCongrats, kids! \\n\\nAnd 5 Stars for Salty Sow."},{"name":"Hooligan's Sports Bar and Grill","address":"8220 NE Vancouver Plaza Dr","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Went to see UFC Connor/Floyd fight here.

I bought the GROUPON deal and felt excited to bring my husband and our 11 y.o. grandson to the Lebanese restaurant. So, we made a reservation and arrived in time.  Our table waiter Francis that was so sweet and polite at the beginning. Then he started to give preferences to the customers at the other table, and served them way before us having long conversations with them and ignoring us.  There were just two parties in the restaurant  at that time: three of us at the table and a couple of women two tables over.  The women came about 10 minutes after we placed our order. Their meals were served before ours. Our wine arrived in about half an hour after being ordered, which would be fine if that was the only delay...

So I called to just let them know that we had tried it and I was not sure if it came up in two separate orders Vs the group order. I wanted to avoid the employees from having to make two trips to the clinic. Our clinic is located pretty close and we all typically order from this specific Jimmy Johns at least once a week. My coworker received a call back from Jimmy Johns staying they did not see my order but saw hers. Although I did receive a email confirmation and it showed that the $ was taken from my card on my bank app. Mind you I had been working my butt off all day with patients with no lunch break and it was 3. I was starving and my coworker is preggers and she was starving as well. We ended up on the phone with a nice guy waiting for his manger to assist us. We waited for about 15 min patiently, only to get Riley Simpson the manager of the store on the phone. Not only was he not helpful and rude. He also told me he was going to have to charge me for yet another sandwich even tho I had an email confirmation and $ out of my account. My payday was Friday. This was on Tuesday and I had about 17$ to my name. I was willing to spend 13$ to eat. So let's do the math, I had 4$ in my account left.  At this point I was so hangry and upset that I freaked out. The manager was not apologetic or helpful, instead he told me that there was no above him that I could talk to cause he was the manager. Then he hung up on me. So I called corporate and complained. I did speak to a nice gentleman and I did cry over a sandwich. I felt terrible about the whole situation and just wanted to eat.  The nice gentleman from corporate did refund me my money and did see my order in the computer said someone would be calling to chat with me. I still have not heard anything. Our clinic which is 2 departments has made an oath not to eat at Jimmy Johns anymore due to the awful experience. The whole clinic was pretty mortified of my experience and now plans on eating at Jersey Mike's. I really feel like the manager would benefit from some costumer service training.

Apparently she's here a lot so you can feel confident in her constant involvement.

I come every Saturday morning for the donuts, and pretty often end up here for lunch & dessert on Thursday afternoons.  \\n\\nEverything I've ever had has been delicious, except the salted caramel cookie bar. It tasted overly sweet to me, and not at all salty or like caramel. The donuts are incredible. The chili with the molasses cornbread is perfection. I loved the grilled cheese. Thin mint brownie, chocolate cupcake with sparkly pink frosting, and salted double chocolate chunk cookies are some of my other favorites.\\n\\nI have had excellent service every single time I've gone, so I have no idea what other reviewers are talking about. Everyone has been super friendly. One time I thought my son, who I meal share with & I'm also still breastfeeding, might have a hazelnut allergy. They went above & beyond, checking the ingredients & double checking with the chef for us. We had a hazelnut free meal that day. \\n\\nI really love this place! And I'm excited that I've started seeing their pastries at other little local coffee shops & juice bars we frequent, because that's the only downside. I don't particularly like their lattes. So convenient to be able to grab a muffin when I'm out!

Wear dark or patterned clothes, or casual clothing. Why? My girl friend wore a sexy dress to dine with us last night and she dropped a saucy skewer onto her light colored dress. Then my guy friend bit into a corn cob and sprayed her in the face with corn juice. Yikes. Funny but unfortunate. I wore a casual patterned piece because I knew I was going to drop sauce or spices onto my clothes, and yes I did. The restaurant is really hot, the air is stuffy and not well-ventilated, so keep that in mind when you go. Wear very little so you can sweat it out, or if you can't stand heat, go during colder weather. Also, it's common sense that when a restaurant is a BBQ venue, it's going to smell like BBQ smoke and the smell may get into your clothes and hair, duh. Not sure why the reviewer below cried about needing a shower after, he's obviously not frequenting enough BBQ venues, lol. A lot of Asian overseas girls were wearing upscale dresses there. They are whack because the food is loaded with messy delicious sauces and spices. I saw a bunch of materialistic girls desperately cleaning their splattered dresses with napkins, lol.\\n\\nEnvironment: Casual, bright lighting, wooden tables and benches, great for groups, loud tvs, noisy chatter, crowded. Great for fun family gatherings or groups of 4 - 6 friends. Not a romantic date place. A very Chinese place, did not see any other race in here except for all Chinese. The staff speak Taiwanese, Mandarin, and broken English.\\n\\nFood: The food is great, deep flavors, lots of mild to hot spices, and I have no idea if there's msg, just ask tge manager if you are concerned. We had corn, chicken knee skewers (yum), lamb skewers (the best skewer), beef skewers (was ok), lamb kidney skewers (grossly good), female capeline fish (pregnant smelts that were too salty), enoki mushroom (our table's favorite), and squid tentacles (my favorite). The food may seem more on the adventerous side to Westerners, because our table's group included a Caucasian friend and he called the food \\"hardcore\\" and wasn't able to stomach the knees, tentacles, or kidneys, lol.\\n\\nCustomer service: Meh, what do you expect from Chinese Richmond venues? Low to non-existant. The staff could learn to speak English, because... we're in Canada, folks. Although there was an older Chinese man with glasses who spoke English and he was nice in my opinion, probably the manager. So if you have questions, ask him, he stopped for our questions in English and he was polite."},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Carmelina's is a very authentic Italian restaurant.

This was DURING DINNER SERVICE.!!! There were banquet tables with food warmers and waiters walking around serving more food. There were so many people in this area that we didnt know where we were supposed to stand while we waited for our table. Another minus was the fact that the meeting took over the front half of the restaurant! I even asked another couple who came in after us what their thoughts were about the \\"mess\\" while we waited and they felt the same--very confused as to why the restaurant was hosting that meeting AT 7pm.\\nWe finally were seated 40 minutes later (there was ONLY one couple in front of us by the way) and only cause someone had called to cancel their reservation. The delay most likely due to the limited restaurant seating cause of this meeting. We were so happy to be sitting and was chatting with the waitress and she was SO surprised to hear that there was a wait ! She had no idea why.\\nWe ordered apps and margaritas. The apps were good BUT the margaritas, which were terribly bland were   $  1  6  each!!! Then we got the chicken bucket and wouldve liked to have the ribs which is also an option for the chicken bucket but alas they were out of ribs. The chicken was horribly bland, i mean NO TASTE AT ALL, seriously. So if you plan on going against my recommendations, then ask for salt because you WILL need it!! Salt for every bite.\\nWhen we were emptying the chicken from the bucket to take home you will NEVER believe what I saw...there was padding at the bottom of the bucket !!!'\\n                                                  T H E Y   P A D   T H E   B U C K E T!!!! \\n.....and I'm talking about a full 2-3\\" of paper padding!! I was shocked ! Imagine a visual where you see a heaping bucket of fried chicken BUT its not filled with chicken--instead padded.\\nSo, as this night's dinner was thankfully over, but horribly upset due the SAD dinner experience and it being my birthday.  As I waited for the bill I was reflecting on the Phantom Gourmet show I saw which blew my mind--a manager that opened doors for diners and also walked around asking how everyone's dining experience was etc etc.  BOY! If I had seen him, Id have a mouthful\\nSo, 1 appetizer, 1 bucket of chicken and 2 drinks= $130 with tip.

I have never written a review about anything but felt so compelled by our experience that I signed on first thing this morning.  By far, this the most horrific dining experiences of my life!!!  I had been dying for Brazilian BBQ after a couple of recent wonderful experiences in NYC and DC.  I have Brazilian friends who warned me that I wouldn't find the same here, ESPECIALLY at the Midwest Grill, but I went anyway.... I didn't find the meat as dry as others did, just terrifically mediocre and cheap in quality, but the service and the place itself was simply atrocious.  The place was dirty (the meat tongs don't appear to be washed between uses, but simply put right back into the sticky, food-encrusted baskets), and the salad bar was disgusting.  I wondered how long some of that stuff has been sitting there and plan to call the Health Dept. on Tuesday.  I witnessed the ridiculous response by the manager when a couple of tables near us complained about the quality, as well as how seldom the meat came by.  Indeed we were situated exactly between the two tables that asked to see the manager and could clearly overhear the conversations going on at each.  The manager was beyond rude and obnoxious, and simply would not hear what was being said to him - politely, I might add.

Came in for late lunch so not much of a crowd and my order was taken quickly. The bowl I ordered was delicious and I did take the heavy pour on the dressing so the calorie count was on the higher end for my bowl but it was worth it! The only two things I can think of as grievances are my wife didn't get asked if she wanted a bowl to dine in so she got a disposable albeit biodegradable bowl. She's very pro climate so she was disappointed in that so remember to remind them if it's a dine in or to go order. The other item is really on me which is I paid the same price for this salad bowl as I would for a Chipotle bowl and being a guy, the meat, cheese, and all the heavy ingredients mentally haunted me as my wife paid the bill haha.

Ok here it is. This place just opened a few weeks ago but when we pulled in the parking lot it was full. Now that's a good sign! We walked in to what used to be the old Dairy Queen on E Livingston Ave. in Reynoldsburg. Actually it's been several different restaurants since the DQ left but this is the only one I've ever tried. \\nIt was very clean and uncluttered and we were welcomed by Gee, the owner, and seated immediately and he took our drink orders. Our server, Michelle brought our drinks, answered our questions about the menu, then took our orders and left. There was a large party of 10 who had ordered right before us so we were prepared to wait awhile. They brought out the order to the large party less than 10 minutes later and then brought ours a few minutes after that. My 2 eggs were cooked over easy and although I had ordered them over medium to make sure the whites were done, they were fine. My bacon was nice and crispy, but not burnt just as I ordered, and it came with 1 pancake & 1 piece of French toast. So all in all my meal was excellent! My husband's meal however was not. He ordered the Goetta omelette which came with toast and hash browns, which he ordered well down on both sides.  The eggs in the omelette were overdone, and the hash browns were very much under done. Gee came over to check that every thing was ok and my husband asked for the hash browns to be crisped up on both sides. A new batch came out, these were hot, but no crisper that the previous ones. The Goetta was an odd mixture of sausage and oats, exactly what he had explained it to be. I tasted it and it was ok. Not bad, but just an odd combination.  I just don't usually think of putting those two items together, but it wasn't bad, it just wasn't good.  And then the toast. It was burnt. Why would you serve burnt toast to someone who had just told you it was their first visit? Actually, why would you serve burnt toast to anyone? \\nI know they have only been open a few weeks and they need to work out some of the kinks out. It will be awhile before we try them for breakfast again but I think we will give their lunch or dinner a try. We asked what their best dishes were and what was homemade. We look forward to trying their meatballs, meatloaf, soups or cabbage rolls, all of which we were promised would be excellent. \\nOh, and the good and the bad? The good is definitely the prices. Everything was very reasonably priced. And the bad? It was very cold in there. Take a sweater!

When we tried to take advantage of this, the waitress clarified that we would not actually receive a separate three course meal - instead, the lobster roll would include two additional courses, making it, technically, a three course meal.

Well before it was mainstream & the Midwest was a unique spot in the Boston food scene.  They have kept their quality up over the years.  The buffet is varied & the rice is a favorite of mine.  The white rice looks plain but its aromatic & very flavorful.  The grilled meats are very good & the servers have a good attitude.  They make the experience fun & a little exotic.  I enjoy the variety of lamb, pork, beef, sausages, grilled pineapple & the chicken hearts.  The only complaint I would have is that the garlic bread is way too garlicky & I really like garlic, plus the last time I was there around 6pm in the evening they were out of chicken hearts.  They know that a lot of people come for them & should keep that in mind.  The addition to the love music & great drinks adds to the whole experience.

But I didn't really care for that and the main issue we had was that she handled the billing part very unprofessionally. My friend asked if we could have my order on one card and my friend's on another. Her meal was $24 and mine was $20. She said it was perfectly fine, but gave us this look and made it seem like it was such a burden. (Could've said they can't here and we would've put it on one card) Then she splits it where my card got charged $24 and my friend's got charged $23. She could have easily told us she can only split it in half or that since it's already charged, she can't fix it anymore and apologize for her mistake. She did not. She went to this other guy, threw her hands in the air and pointed to us while rolling her eyes, and told him to explain to us that because of tax, that's why our cards were charged that way. Anyone who has a brain knows that tax doesn't work that way. I gave up talking to incompetent walls. My distaste is in how she handled things. Ruined my experience and never coming back.

Efficient service. Just beware, there is a 1 hour and 15 minute time limit. I'd give the place 4.5 stars if I wanted a place to eat in less than that time, or 1 star if looking for a more comfortable, casual environment because *surprise!* your time is up!\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFOOD: Quite delicious. I've been twice, favorite dishes (most) include: baby eggplant, exploding little neck clams, Mimmo's baked meatballs (quite possibly the best I've ever had), fried calamari (spicy!), fusilli pesto (pistachio-based pesto -- delectable). \\nSERVICE: Efficient. Glasses are always filled, serve you quickly.\\nNARRATIVE: So, as I said, I've been twice. The first time was such a great experience (about one month ago with my family) that when my best friend came to town to visit, I had to bring him back. I feel a little bad writing a negative review that isn't balanced by the positive experience I had last time, but the experience was so extraordinary that I feel compelled to share it. \\n\\nSo anyway, best friend comes to town all the way from San Francisco, and we go to Carmelina's, 6:30 on 12/2 (we made a reservation). We order a bottle of wine because we haven't seen each other in 3 years, and there is so much to catch up on. Meatball appetizer -- delicious. He got the Tonno con Pesto Siciliano e Fusilli (I got this last time, it was amazing) -- I got the Crazy Alfredo. Everything was tasty, a repeat of my previous experience. We're having a ball, I'm hearing about the girl he might marry someday, I'm telling him about my new life in Boston, and then... a tall gentleman (not our waiter) comes to our table and says (as politely as one can, I might add), 'We typically plan for guests taking 1 hour and 15 minutes to eat, and' [gesturing to the front door] 'we have guests who have been waiting quite some time.' \\n\\nWow. Message received. I turn to my friend (who's maybe 2/3 of the way through his dinner), and together we absorb the reality of two semi-full wine glasses, and a quarter of a bottle of wine left, and are left to ponder what next? He's originally from Europe, and makes the point that in Italy, one can sit at a restaurant drinking only espresso for hours in peace. I remember this is the first time I've ever bought a bottle of wine at a restaurant, and it's quite a splurge for me. And every moment after the \\"intervention\\", we both feel a mixture of guilt for staying, and anger for them shortchanging our experience. Maybe 15 or 20 minutes later, the Italian lady who greets people comes by to 'assure [us] that it's not just you, it's restaurant policy', and wanted to make sure 'we weren't upset'. We were upset -- we told her so. We explained the wine, the incomplete dinner, the poisoning of our experience, and she offered us no olive branch; no apology, no discount on the wine, no gift card coupled with a happy invitation to return. And as she left, we are wondering what \\"it's not just you\\" meant -- did she think we were a gay couple?\\n\\nYou know, we were sitting at a table for 4, and there were only two of us, so I'm sure the staff were frustrated we took so long. I could also *almost* understand if we maybe didn't order wine, or appetizers, but the reality is we spent ~$46 each on dinner, which is just not something I am able to do more than once or twice a year. We left Carmelina's with the sour taste of having gulped down the last of our wine -- oh, and the rest of the experience."},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Yum yum yum!

Keep on looking folks, this is not the restaurant you are looking for.\\nLet me premise with, I have been ordering from here for 8 years. I lucked out and found a decent place that delivers, but after today, my search begins again. \\n\\nAfter a relaxed Saturday, we decided to order Chineese and watch some soccer. I ordered online on the Yelp site, which was easy and super quick. I got the confirmation that our $43 order was received. After about 40 min there was a knock on the door. First thing I noticed after opening the bags was the 20oz bottled soda was a 12oz can. Not a show stopper, but not what I paid $2.35 for. We start opening the food containers and the beef with vegetables is beef with broccoli. Again not a show stopper, but not what I ordered. So I call the restaurant and told the lady that I got the wrong dish and would like the correct one delivered back to me. I'm told they read it wrong, made the incorrect dish and the driver will come with the order and retrieve the mistake. No apologies, but no problem. About 30 min later and the same driver is back with a hot order. He is quick to pass the new bag over, grab the old and rush off. I sit down, excited to finally eat, but to my surprise it is still not beef with vegetables. Now I'm upset. I call back to Oriental Express and tell them this is not right, still. The lady says, let me call the driver and see if he gave you the wrong order. I get a call back and am told the chef didn't make any other beef dishes that went out with that driver. I am still looking at the wrong order. She asks me to take a picture and text it to her, as if she doesn't believe that I would mistake beef WITHOUT vegetables for beef WITH vegetables. I comply and send it over after we hang up. It takes about 5 min before I get a response which is \\"Ok driver on the way back. Give him 2 other dinner back plz. Sorry.\\" Glad to get some kind of apology, but really, the same mistake twice? I respond that the driver already has the first wrong order and that I will give him the second wrong order after I verify the third one is actually correct. Another 5 min and I get a \\"Thanks\\". Now from here, I'm expecting a really quick return. It's only an 11 min drive from my place to theirs in rush hour traffic and he's supposedly on his way. (Yes, I really checked it.) Half an hour later there is finally a knock on the door. The driver, a different from the original, is immediately apologizing. I check the order while still in his hands and, thank goodness, it is finally right! I hand him the other order and thank him. Down side, the bag he hands me is dripping sauce all over my hands and floor. Really not the strongest finish.\\nNow in all the years I've been ordering from here, we've had the occasional snafu. I'm a forgiving  person. In most cases, I have let it roll off my back, but this was just a careless mistake that should have been fixed right the first time. If nothing else a verbal apology would have gone a long way, not a text. A refund or partial refund would have been greatly appreciated. I'm not going back. I don't recommend them. The food is average. Wonton soup is probably my favorite, but there is better out there. So, keep looking.

I ordered a lunch special (beef with string beans and pork fried rice, with egg drop soup on the side) over the phone with ease, and it was ready when I got there. The restaurant had provided napkins and a plastic fork and spoon, but the woman at the counter was very nice and gave me chopsticks when I asked for them. Another thing to note is that the takeout containers are just foam, so they are liable to leak, but the restaurant packs everything neatly upright and ties the bag in a way that keeps everything together, so I didn't have any issues with leakage despite carrying a lot of other stuff.\\n\\nWhen I opened up my food to eat, I was shocked by the amount that there was for just $6.40. There was probably 3 or 4 servings of rice, and maybe 2 servings of meat packed in there. I was also pleasantly surprised by the egg drop soup, which was the normal pale yellow-white color and tasted like home-made egg drop soup, rather than the thick, bright yellow kind restaurants sometimes serve. I enjoyed eating the pork fried rice with the egg drop soup, along with the beef and string beans. There wasn't a ton of pork in the fried rice, so it was a good accompanying dish, but the pieces of meat were each good and not fatty. The string beans and beef were also very tasty, and by the time I was full and ready to go catch my bus, it hardly looked like I had eaten at all! However, I had finished all of the soup and definitely ate a good amount of rice, beef, and string beans, but there was still somehow a ton of food left. I ended up sharing the leftovers with my parents as part of our dinner (supplemented by some other food), and there was more than enough rice to go around, which should give a sense of just how much food there was. I'll definitely come back here for a tasty lunch and leftovers I can look forward to across a couple meals. I also want to try dining in to try their other dishes!

We did report that and were told that the tortillas were a bit dry that day. They were falling apart when we were trying to eat our queso.

But our meal went downhill from there. \\n\\nThe banchan choices were thin (shredded laver --?? really??) - and even the kimchi lacked the spice and depth of flavor we are used to.  \\n\\nThe seafood stew special showcased tough squid in a watery gochujang-based sauce that was almost inedible.  \\n\\nAnd the kalbi was disappointing - the short rib meat was poorly cut in thick squares that grilled up tough.

The fries were the star on the plate. The fries  were salted well and tasted great. I thought i would try the amber ale but i didn't like it. i thought it might have been me  so i had a second beer. Sometimes you have to try new things (amber ale) to see if you like them so no worries in trying the amber ale. The waitress was polite, pleasant, professional and a very quick server. The price was very reasonable for what i had.\\n\\nAs for Yaggers on kits  being a sportsbar i would have to disagree. It appears to be a very cosy pub with friendly staff and tasty food. If you have read my previous reviews, i tend to be very picky about sports bars. there are a number of differences between pubs and very good sports bars. First a pub would only show Canucks games or any games that you would see on cbc or sportsnet on saturday night. A very good sports bar would show just about every hockey game for a saturday night. A pub would show only Seattle Seahawks games on Sunday while a very good sports bar would run Nfl Sunday ticket. a very good sports bar would run soccer, baseball and any nba basketball game. in a pub you would be lucky to get a nba game that was national tv . Yaggers on kits seems like a great place to go after a hard week of work to have a beer or two but it's not quite a sports bar ( i know i''m picky about that) \\n\\nThe bartender put on music about ten minutes after i arrived and then ran audio of the Canucks game ( which is the proper way to create ambience for saturday night hockey) The bartender and waitress did as good a job as they could but i was surprised it was so quiet. I wish i could have given them 3.5 stars as opposed to 3 because the staff did their best and food was generally very good. Yaggers on kits a very good pub and not at the sportsbar level."},{"name":"Jade Garden Kitchen","address":"1195 Marine Drive","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Finally got a chance to try this new Chinese restaurant which seems to change ownership and name quite frequently.

On a whim one night, and wanting cheap, close sushi, we gave this a try.  It is exactly what you would expect - totally laid back and generically decorated interior, with mediocre sushi to match.  The sushi was extremely loosely rolled, and in quite large pieces, so it really just fell apart when you went to eat it (or dipped it in soy sauce).  The miso soup was decent, but served with funny little plastic spoons (how very non-authentic, lol).  They do have Sapporo on tap though, so bonus points for that.  It reminded us both of a place that, if still in college, would totally have been a splurge night.  Too funny, and my how things change (these days Bamboo Sushi suits me quite nicely).  I think the whole meal, with soup and four rolls, probably cost $35.  They advertise \\"1/2 off rolls all day,\\" and special Happy Hour things, but we went around 7pm, so no dice there.\\n\\nIn all honesty I won't go again, but overall if you are looking for cheap sushi in a clean environment, this is your place.

The location is great.  I grew up less than 1 mile from this brewery and am glad to see someone making a good use of the open space in this area.  This place is dog friendly.  If you are a d-bag with an asshole dog, leave it at home.  Friendly dogs welcome.  No need to parade your un-neutered fighting dog around to look cool.  Leave that at home.\\n\\nLet's get straight to the reason I gave this place 2 stars:  I live in Colorado.  In Colorado, you can take a growler into any brewery or brew pub and get it filled.  In Texas, it used to be that beer-to-go was not an option for legal reasons.  My understanding is that Jester King was instrumental in getting the laws in Texas changed in favor of beer-to-go.  As a direct result of these changes, if you are a brewpub, you can sell beer directly to consumers for consumption off-site.  Jester King states on their website that they went to the effort to change their liquor license from a brewery to a brewpub so that they could sell beer-to-go.  Great, you'd think they would fill your growler then, right?  NOPE.  They won't fill a growler, and they claim it's a quality control issue.  They fear people will fill a growler, let it sit in their fridge for a month, then drink it, and think the bad beer is because of the brewery, not because the growler sat in their fridge for a month.  That may be a concern, but you can fix that with education of your customers, not just cutting them off.  Instead, Jester King is happy to sell you bottles that have been filled by them, who knows how long ago.  They are completely missing the point that a growler is the consumer's version of quality control.  I bring a growler to fill because I want the freshest beer that you have on tap.  I'm not going to buy your bottled beer because I have no clue when it was bottled.  I am giving Jester King 2 stars because they went to the trouble to make growlers legal in Texas, and they won't fill one.

When you hear \\"Summer Shack,\\" it conjures up images of fish shacks in coastal Maine, complete with unassuming interior with picnic tables and fresh tasty seafood for pretty cheap. This place is very formal: dark cherry paneling,  vaulted ceilings, dark cherry tables. The strange thing is they put down butcher paper before you eat, reminiscent of real fish shacks. While appropriate on weathered picnic tables, strange on dark formal cherry tables! I digress, however. I wanted a healthy lunch but most of the entrees were fried and expensive. I asked the waitress re: the Waldorf salad and she said that it was large in size and would definitely fill me up. My Dad ordered Haddock sticks and fries. Service was quite slow for pretty uncomplicated dishes and an empty dining room (we went at an off time in between meals- maybe 3:00 pm ish). My Waldorf salad was one small ice cream scoop of salad on the piece of lettuce! I was starved and could not imagine the waitress getting filled up on the Waldorf salad. My Dad said his entree was incredibly greasy and he could not eat it. We decided to try to keep an open mind and get dessert. I got pecan pie and I believe he got the same. It was not warmed up and tasted store bought! I guess with these prices, l would have expected something more.

The days when I could waltz in between classes with six people in line ahead of me and waltz right back out two light cycles later to cross Guadalupe to get back to campus.  Those days are gone.  Based on my observation, it's because of new staff.\\n\\nI realize they have to spend a lot of time with these people every day, but they really don't have to be involved in full-blown conversations with them every time I'm there, holding me up.  Last week I was there and one employee walked up and down the food line distracting each employee separately with conversation.  By the time I get to the register I have to tell the person what I ordered because the person supposedly keeping track of that is too busy chatting; today it was about how there are two people with the same name working there now.\\n\\nI don't mean to complain, I really don't.

Bacon cheeseburger for $6.50? Tasty Burger is a dollar less. Sirloin? Sure. Fine. I'll pay it, I'm hungry.\\n\\nWhile waiting for my burger, I could hear some younger customers raving about their meals, \\"Holy shit, you were right, this is a good fucking burger\\". Positive sign. I got my food and decided to eat in my car...because nothing is more attractive than a man eating a burger in the car alone on some random side-street. \\n\\nThe 'Holy Shit Kid' was right...Burger was GOOD. Huge, seasoned well, cooked perfectly, great bun, and juicy as all hell.  I've paid 13-16 dollars for burgers that didn't stack up to this one at some of my favorite pretentious-jerk-restaurants. While Tasty Burger is cheaper and far more convenient for me at 2am,  Lee's offers a far superior burger and better service. I'm into it. A+. Five stars. Two thumbs up.

Maybe a little too high. Based on everything I have read and heard, I could not wait to get to Muqueca! \\n\\nI knew that it would be crowded, so my husband made a reservation.  It was pointless. We got there about 10 minutes before the reservation time but weren't seated for close to 40 minutes after that. So really, there was no point in making a reservation, which made me wonder why they even accept reservations? They'd be better off with a no reservation policy.\\n\\nNow, for the food. We got an order of half shrimp & half cod Brazilian patties to start with. They were decent. Not to die for, but a good starter. The cod ones weren't really hot enough. When the Muqueca (we got the combo, shrimp, mussels and fish)  arrived, it was visually appealing, sizzling and colorful. Aaaah, finally! This is what we came here for. Okay, it was good. The seafood was tender, but a little mild.  As another reviewer mentioned, I too thought the broth was a bit too mild. I think it could have been more spicy or more flavorful in general. It was good, but not 5 star out of this world, in my opinion. Enjoyable, but there was just something missing about it. We also had a side order of plantains that were incredible - maybe even the best plantains I've ever had? \\n\\nService was polite and efficient.

To be honest I am comparing it to various incredible brisket plates I had in Austin recently, but location shouldn't matter. I don't like having to add sauce to meat to make it tender or flavorful, it should be great on its own and the sauces just as a side item. The rice & beans were okay -- nothing special, but wasn't there for rice & beans, the yuca on the other hand was BAD. I love fried yuca and know what to expect in regards to texture and flavor. I am not sure, but I think they may have passed the yuca through a processor because the consistency was more like mashed potatoes and obviously a processed food item because the shapes were too uniform.

UNACCEPTABLE. Seriously, it is *not* okay that it took me over two years to try the awesome food here.\\n\\nI asked my server, Aksana, to order for me since I had never tried Turkish food before. We settled on a couple of different small plates and a dessert:\\n\\n1. Bebek karni yarek (baby eggplant stuffed with ground lamb and saut√©ed onion): Aksana told me that Turkish cuisine is known for amazing eggplant dishes, and I can see why. This was easily the best eggplant I've ever had in my life -- it was the perfect vessel for the lamb and onions, tender and pleasantly oily. It came with a dollop of thick, tart yogurt that provided a nice contrast. Om. Nom. Nom.\\n\\n2. Mercimek kofte (steamed red lentils with tomatoes, parsley, and scallions): I can already sense your skepticism. STOP. Just hear me out. These lentils... in all my life I have never had such extraordinary lentils. They formed a paste that was thick with flavor -- tangy and hearty and green, all at once. Again, the yogurt that it came with was like a magic ingredient. It was exactly the right thing to have along with the lentils. \\n\\n3. Sutlac (rice pudding): I am a sucker for a good rice pudding. The Filipino version is one of my all-time favorite foods. So many creamy-dreamy-delicious carbohydrates! I was clearly predisposed to liking this dessert. When I broke the skin of my sutlac and tasted my first cold, vanilla-y scoop, I was smitten. It was bomb, my friends. Deeply bomb. You should order it.\\n\\nThe free bread was just as delicious as the small plates. It was soft and a little spongy, served with a tangy red pepper sauce for dipping. I'm sure I would have merked the entire basket if given the opportunity, but eggplant and lentils came out crazy-fast. Quick service seemed to be par for the course -- I saw a guy walk in, order, and leave with takeout in like 7 minutes flat. \\n\\nDon't be like me, living a sad eggplant-and-lamb-less life.

I had my choice of the rest of the room that occupied the corner of a block, and I selected one of the low lying seats with a back rest - some of the six tables along the windows had seats consisting of cushioned blocks.\\n\\nI had time to kill and a deal voucher to use, so I selected a bunch of things to try:\\n\\n'Deviled' Eggs...  Smoked Paprika, Goat Milk Ricotta, Chipotle Tabasco     $2 / piece\\n\\nBeef Tenderloin... Kalbi Marinade, 3 Skewers, Corn Salad    $8\\n\\nDuck Confit... Soy Marinade, Raspberry Preserves, Spinach, Crostini    $9\\n\\nBoneless Rib Wraps... Lettuce, Sweet Honey Soy, Spare Ribs    $7\\n\\nThey came pretty quickly - probably because I was the only party without food at the time, but still I appreciated it.\\n\\nThe rib wraps arrived first, looking very much like cha siu stuffed into moo shi skins.  But with the dipping sauce served alongside it, I have to admit that it was quite yummy.\\n\\nI was a tad surprised that the deviled egg was but a single half - I figured for $2 I would get a whole egg.  But the menu does say \\"per piece\\" and it was pretty tasty.  So if you feel like an egg, go for it.\\n\\nThe duck confit was easy to cut and I had some fun making canapes by spreading the raspberry jam on the crostini and topping it with spinach and duck - both meat and skin.  A touch on the salty side, but still good, and fun!\\n\\nI love kalbi and bulgogi, so I was surprised when the beef tenderloin seemed to taste somewhat like liver and was just too salty.  It also lacked the sweet element that I tend to associate with the classic Korean marinade.  But here is also where I began appreciating the service I received as the almost sole diner.  My server kindly offered to take it back and to bring me back the menu to make an alternative selection.\\n\\nThus, I ended up with the following additions which turn out are not listed on the menu currently posted on their website:\\n\\nBLT Arancini $6\\n\\nButternut Squash Soup with Apple $2 / teacup\\n\\nA teacup doesn't sound like much of a portion, but with the cute little spoon, I made that soup last.  What looked like pickled onions to me tasted like sweet corn kernels.  Imagine my surprise when I was informed by the chef that they were red delicious apples diced, sprinkled with a sugar, and cooked a bit!  Basically the soup was really good with the apples, and was the obvious winner of the evening.  Definitely 5 stars!\\n\\nThe arancini were just crispy enough on the outside and about the size of a ping pong ball.  The presentation was cute, and I enjoyed them.\\n\\nI sincerely hope that items get added as regulars on the menu.\\n\\nWhen I left shortly after 6pm, there were perhaps two (not the same two mentioned at the beginning of my review) individual patrons at the bar, while the nearby Fat Cat was hopping.

Both were great but thought there was much more cheese than meat products.  Had butter lettuce salad which was good (bacon excellent) but somewhat hard to eat in the dish it is in.  Son had the salmon which had great flavor but was over cooked (which was fine for him, but for a salmon junkie would have been sad).  Husband had chicken which he said was over cooked.  Hard to eat the veggies/potatoes under the dishes.  My grilled cheese and tomato soup were amazing!  I loved it!  We had grilled pound cake and s'mores pudding for dessert.  They were both excellent.  So all in all if it were just me rating the restaurant, I would give it a strong 4 but because of the rest if my family's feedback we are in the 3 star area."},{"name":"Royal Roast Beef & Seafood","address":"752 Bennington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Royal has some super tasty roast beef sandwiches!

It took the hostess probably 5 minutes just to greet us and then shortly after that sat us at a table on the front porch directly next to the one man band (unable to hold a conversation because the music was loud that close)We started our order with 2 glasses of wine and the calamari appetizer. It took about 15 minutes to get our drinks and 30 minutes to get our appetizer that came out lukewarm. I asked the server to check on our appetizer after about 20 minutes after ordering. We then asked to be moved to another table back from the band and the hostess quickly moved us. I ordered the chicken parmigiana and my wife ordered another appetizer for her entree. After waiting 1 hour and ten minutes after ordering we finally received our salads. At this point we noticed other couples that had been seated 30 minutes after us that had already been served their entrees!! I asked our server what the issue was and she went to \\"check\\" and disappeared for another 15 minutes. Water glasses were empty for nearly half the time and I finally tracked the bus boy down to get a refill. After 1 hour and 30 minutes I had had enough and asked our server for the check.

I have to say that the restaurant lived up to all expectations. \\n\\nWe started with the fried yucca. The yucca was not overly oily and fried to perfection. I found their special house sauce just average. We had had the mango samba fruit juice which was delicious. The juice wasn't overly sweet or thick and really complements the meal. For entrees, we tried the seafood rice casserole and the fish and shrimp Muqueca. All I have to say is that you have to go and try them as they were both great. Very flavorful yet filling (and not in the nasty way). I only wish I had more room to try some other stuff on the menu. Also, I loved their creamy hot sauce. Flavorful, spicy, and goes great with everything.\\n\\nI also thought that the service was actually very good. Maybe because we went on Thursday and it wasn't overly crowded. All of our food arrived fairly promptly, and our waitress was attentive.\\n\\nFinal note, they are at a location a block away from where their old place use to be at."},{"name":"Central Bistro","address":"34 Summer St, Fl 2","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"If you're looking to host a mid-sized, elegant but fun event in the middle of Boston, look no further people. This is your one-stop shop. How do I even begin to sing my praises of glory?\\n\\nI had my wedding at Petit Robert Central and because of them, I might be the first bride ever in the history of time to not weep ugly tears of stress because of her venue. Everything was completely and totally p-e-r-f-e-c-t-i-o-n.\\n\\nFOOD: Unless you've got a party of spoiled jerks raised on kobe beef and kale shakes, the food is SPECTACULAR. Clearly I'm biased but I think it's some of the best wedding food I've ever had. I had been to the restaurant a few times and did the tasting... everything was de-lish but as with any restaurant I had concerns the quality might suffer when trying to feed 40 people at the same time. Let me tell you, dearest Yelp reader, it did NOT. Everything was just as great as if you were to order it for an intimate dinner for two. And you know the obligatory 'well we have to serve chicken because it's a wedding and everyone eats chicken' concept? Well, these guys serve a gorgeous HALF chicken and it is sooooo good. I never order chicken in restaurants because it's the one thing I can cook at home and I actually ate it the night of my wedding. If I felt like I wouldn't have burst out of my dress, I would have asked for the other half.\\n\\nSERVICE: I just... I mean.. I can't. I can't find the words to express how FABULOUS the team is here. Leading up to the event, we worked with Danielle, their director of events. This woman is a GEM and just the type of person you want to work with for an event. Danielle is completely professional but caring and personal.... but you can tell from the moment you meet her that she runs a tight ship. And that she does. We had a cocktail hour and a seated dinner for 40 people and then a reception for about 75 and the whole evening went off without a hitch. Everything was on-time, no one waited for food or drinks, and the entire wait staff was friendly and fun. Not a single complaint and only praises from our guests. CAN I GET A HALLELUJAH? Also at one point in the evening I lost my lipstick (it was Chanel so basically more expensive than my apartment) and like 5 people there dropped everything to help me find it. THAT is service ladies and gentlemen. \\n\\nSPACE: What lead us to PRC in the beginning was the space itself. We were having a black & white wedding and in the city of Boston where everything is Colonial, a great, fresh space is hard to come by. They have a classic but warm black and white scheme which automatically ups the class level and feel. They have fabulous private rooms (we used two of them) so you can really have a space that feels full but not cramped no matter your party size. Stalk me and I'll send you pictures.\\n\\nEVENT MGMT: I've already sung the praises for Danielle but I want to be sure to mention the fact that she and her team worked with all of our vendors (florist, DJ, cake, AV for our projectors) that day so I literally didn't even think about anything the day of the wedding except making sure my fake lashes didn't fall off as I wept tears of joy. The other gem of the day was Kai. She helped enormously, especially with setting up all of our decorations. Legit, I just like, filled a suitcase with some glitter and instructions and she made both of our spaces look so incredible and never had to call or ask about anything. Between Danielle and Kai and whoever else behind the scenes, it was like, \\"TA-DA PINTEREST HAS NOTHING ON THIS, FOOLS!\\"  \\n\\nVALUE: I should mention that we did NOT break the bank for our wedding. Yes it was a smaller wedding compared to most, but we had a really hard time finding the right venue because of our group size and budget within Downtown Boston. Most places just don't have the private rooms so then you have to buy out a restaurant which, on a Saturday night? Noooo way.  Most places who have the space in the area charge you like 10k just to turn on the lights even for 40 people (cough*F you State Room*cough.) Plus, PRC has tons of package options for apps, meals and drinks so you can customize things according to your budget. \\n\\nOk, I think Yelp might start to cut me off so I should stop, but seriously I can't recommend Petit Robert Central highly enough. Especially if you're planning a wedding in Downtown Boston look no further. This is the spot. Prepare to have the wedding of your dreams. xoxoxooxo"},{"name":"Tiny Bistro","address":"1039 Marietta St NW, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Great sandwiches and healthy side options."},{"name":"Las Palmas Cuban Restaurant","address":"351 N Donnelly St","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"3.5","text":"We went here for a small going away party for a colleague - we all arrived across a span of about 20 minutes and Sami (Samantha) greeted each of as we arrived.\\n\\nShe is one of the best servers I have encountered in quite a while - she didn't just take orders.

I doused it with Cajun Chef sauce to give it a kick, and away I went! \\n\\nThe only real issues here were two. \\n#1- The crawfish were chewy. Too chewy. That kind of chewy where you wonder if they screwed it up cooking it too long or if they're just using sub-par tails.\\n\\n#2- $10.49?? For a po-boy with no sides? Crazy Cajun's is $8.99.

Not a large menu, but a variety of dishes please whatever your mood or preference.  Fish taco appetizer was three large tacos - nicely breaded fish and a tasty pico (the 2 of us were pretty full after splitting these!)  The veggie kabobs are grilled well, and come with a delicious dipping sauce and lemony orzo salad.

I believe they are most famous for their daily and weekly specials, although hard to decide, EVERYTHING is fabulous. Joe, the owner/chef knows exactly what he's doing back there. If there are ever fish tacos on the menu - GET THEM! Although, I love tacos no matter what... His have got to be my favorite. Don't forget to try their Poutine either... You will thank me later, and I assure you will go back for it, or even dream about it in your sleep. \\n\\nI would say their most popular specials would be the $1 oysters on Monday nights (Huge seller!), a burger and beer for $10 on Tuesdays, the two entrees and bottle of wine for $50 on Wednesday nights (How do you beat that?). They will sometimes have live music on Fridays and Saturdays, which has always brought in a relatively fun crowd. I can also guarantee that you won't go anywhere else on the North Shore for a better Bloody Mary once you've had theirs. The vodka pour is top notch, and the fabulous array of options at the Bloody Mary bar are astonishing! \\n\\nGive this place a try if you haven't already... And I hope you love the place as much as I do!!"},{"name":"Winsor Dim Sum Caf√©","address":"10 Tyler St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Meh. If you've never had dim sum, this place is fine.

Of course, I had no problem shopping for ingredient chinese/taiwanese/japanese/korean rarities... like pickled spicy and sweet relish stem.  Uwajimaya has most of the basics but its what Portland can offer (aside from Fubon).  Its too bad Uwajimaya is located in Beaverton and not accessible with bikes or the MAX.  You have to drive there!  Think about the gas prices... Anyways, they've  got the basic rarities like black sesame oil, caned spicy bamboo, sticky white rice, rice vinegar wine, sashimi goods, and of course, delicious Japanese and Taiwanese snacks!  They also have a bakery section with items like bread filled with red bean,  coconut cream custard, and taro.  I'm a bit sketchy with their limited selections that is only made in China.  I had previous experiences of made in China items that got me food poison or sick.  I only buy items from made in Taiwan or Japan or Korea or Thailand.  They also have a great section for vegans and vegetarians!  In the frozen section there are plenty of vegan mock meats from chicken drumsticks to fish steak.  In the produce section there are also plenty of great Asian vegetables and fruits like winter melon (makes a good roast for ice tea), snow pea leaves, and Taiwanese chives (makes a great filling for dumpling).\\n\\nPS: Apparently there's a bookstore in the back I've never been before.

Second, I was treated to a very nice dinner for which I'd have considered the money I'd pay well-spent. \\n\\n\\"Owner's choice\\" to start me off (I asked him to surprise me and use his discretion) was the cheese and crab fritter app. Very good, and something I can honestly say I would order again; three cute and tasty little fritters and a perfect size for sharing. At $11, maybe a skosh pricey for an app (I personally wouldn't eat this as an \\"entree,\\" like you can some appetizers that are on the more expensive side anywhere) but tasty and for sharing a good pick. \\n\\nFor my entree, I went with the same thing I got last time - the skirt steak and fries - since I figured that'd be the best way to compare my experiences fairly. This is where I was both impressed and a bit aware that special attention was probably paid to my meal - not that that's a bad thing, but to confirm the integrity of my upgrade and the yumminess of the steak dish, I will have to go back at least once more! My steak was a nice med-rare, it was thick and flavorful (honestly, it did not resemble the one we got last time in any way at all) and the fries were plentiful and tasty. Definitely like a different meal than I had the first time. \\n\\nI had the same server, Tab, and she was great (pre- and post-identifying myself and being comped) and that was impressive given the huge hum of activity (mostly drink-based given it was a Friday night about 9:30 on) surrounding the bar where I was sitting, the one in the smaller area en route to the bathroom. She also made me my first-ever and super tasty Moscow Mule - with Bluecoat gin, the best IMO, it was quite the yummy cocktail! \\n\\nI have to be honest: I didn't know what to expect on a return visit to BBB but it was a pleasure. I hope that future visits will be as nice and that, as I said in my original review, there's finally a spot that can make a good go of it in this hallowed corner of Buckhead. \\n\\nA sincere thank-you to AD, Tab and Chef Ian for a nice visit."},{"name":"iPho Noodle House","address":"3005 West Lake Mary Blvd, Ste 108","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"4","text":"The servers here are very attentive.

Given the paucity of good breakfast places in the area, there should be a line out the door every Saturday and Sunday.  Everything I've had has been great.  They make excellent pancakes and even something simple like eggs and breakfast potatoes is done to perfection.  \\nWe just went for the prix fixe dinner and were amazed at how good our three courses were, especially given the $25 price.  Joseph, the chef, put together a number of great options including veal osso buco and filet of sole, which were both delicious.

They cooked it a perfect medium rare, actually a little on the rare side (which I love), and the fries were excellent.  The calamari was not very good, and I would try a different app next time.  I was unfamiliar with the Carlsburg beer, and that was a hit as well.  My girl swears by the ahi tuna salad.\\n\\nThe tables are interesting, with lights underneath the middle of marble tables.

I'm sure there are some things on their menu that are relatively terrible, ie the filet that you yelpers are b*tching about.  I don't know why so many people place orders that simply do not make sense.  If you want a good filet, there's a capital grille within 200 feet.  Walk your ass over there.  Don't judge a restaurant on something they do not specialize in.  \\"Hey guys, there's a trendy new place in Buckhead with 10 sandwiches offered and 1 cut of beef for $25 right next to pasta and salmon...let's get it!\\" ...(= stupid)\\n\\nBottom Line:  Although I had a bad attitude when I entered into the restaurant and almost wanted it to fail (to spite my girl), this place shocked me.  Get the lamb burger with goat cheese and a beer, and you won't regret it.  I bet the 12oz regular burger would be good as well, along with quite a few of their small plates.

The bad is that they don't tell you the wait time, just how many people are ahead of you in line. We were told 15 parties were ahead of us, we quantified that to about an hour and a half to be safe. Once you sit down you realize why you've waited. It's a small place, maybe only 15 tables total, but very accommodating. Our waiter (it actually kills me that we forgot his name) was hilarious.

Since their portions are typically big enough to feed a family of 4 I opted to just order a appetizer.  I ordered the bang bang salmon wraps which looked delicious from the  description , I assumed bang bang meant spicy but apparently I was wrong, the Salmon was fishy and the flavors did not go well together.

Occasionally we'd have women join us which made it more fun for us and frightening for them I'm sure (we're rather large men after all eating heavily... it had to be a sight).  We'd hit different places at times, but we had 3 semi-regular spots in our Thursday night rotation: Kowloon, Hilltop, and Border Cafe.  We'd enjoy good meals, and bust each others chops.

Outside, however, there is another seating area, and it is awesome. There are walls on the sides facing the road, and you feel like you are in a special dining area. The hanging string of lights above our head lit up around sunset, giving it even more of a great atmosphere. I liked just being there and sitting. It was nice.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I order two things, and plan to share, of course. She gets The Big Floyd (Oakwood smoked brisket, pulled pork, Fred Stokes sausage, house-made sweet BBQ sauce, citrus peanut slaw and french fries served on a toasted Hawaiian roll). On the side, she got the Grilled Mexican Street Corn (w/chili-lime butter & cotija cheese). \\nThis sandwich is awesome. All of the meats are cooked very well, and the bite of the sausage is always a welcome addition to a sandwich. The slaw was really unique. The peanut-ness of it added a nuttiness, duh, to the slaw that helped brighten up the sandwich just like it needed. So good. So good. The corn was good, too. Not as strong of a flavor as I would have liked, but it was still good. \\n\\nI went for the Crisp Pork Belly Banh-Mi (Smoked then grilled pork belly, lucky dragon sauce, pickled vegetables, Fresno peppers and cilantro on a toasted baguette), with a side of Fried Yuca (w/fancy sauce). This sandwich was dynamite in the flavor department. The pork was meaty, the veggies added that tang and acid, the peppers added the heat, the sauce added the sweet, and the cilantro added the cilantro, so beware, if you're the type that doesn't like cilantro too much. \\nThe only place that this sandwich was lacking was the texture department. The meat was absolutely not crisp, and the vegetables did not help to add any crunch either. If any element of crunch was present in this sandwich, it would have been a perfect dish. \\nThe yuca, however, was the best yuca I've had. Crispy on the outside, cooked all the way through, and pieces that were cut small enough to not be overwhelmed with the amount of yuca in your mouth. The fancy sauce was creamy and a little spicy/fancy. Great side item. \\n\\nOverall, the atmosphere of this place was pretty Mills 50.

The food was plated cleanly and very impressive, with a awesome presentation of all that you ordered. I had the 2 meat combo, that came with two tortillas,  the black beans and rice, french fries, and a sample of both hot and sweet homemade sauces. The flavors were phenomenal, the meat cooked prefect, and fried were crispy and seasoned prefect. My wife ordered the 1/2 chicken with black beans and rice, and the smoked corn on the cob. The chicken continually flowed with juices every time she cut into it. This place is awesome, and I will be back for certain"},{"name":"Toast","address":"5222 SE 52nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The food was fine, nothing special by Portland standards. The service ranged from disinterested to slightly snotty. The best/worst/most ironic part is that,TOAST, does not come with your breakfast and if you do pay the upcharge for it, it is a weird crumbly hunk of breadmaker style bread. It appeared to have been lightly broiled and arrived slightly burnt, cold, and with no butter.

It's a mistake that I waited so long to come. I found this menu intriguing and innovative. But I'm getting a little ahead of myself. There is easy parking in the back and the space is really cool. It's somewhat small, but in a good way. This reminds me of the kind of space One might find in Center City Philadelphia or the East Village. From the outside it looks more like an office park, but inside you have that old city charm and patina.\\n\\nWe had several items, much of which was suggested to us by our waiter, they did a great job of guiding us through the menu and making sure we hit some of the favorites. For the salad you definitely want to try the pad Thai salad, and whether you like kale or not, The kale salad is unique. We also had the street corn, which was very good and comes with a nice dusting of cheese on top. \\n\\nI would strongly recommend the mushroom toast, which has a brandy cream sauce that is exceptional. The duck confi is probably the best in Atlanta. All duck can be tender, but most places in Atlanta did not render the skin to a golden crisp. We tried the quail, which normally I like but found The breading too heavy and the spices too strong such that the quail was drowned out.\\n\\nI'm not usually a dessert fan but both  the creme br√ªl√©e and the strawberry cake were surprisingly good. \\n\\nService was really good at the beginning, although stuff tends to come quickly out of the kitchen, and we felt rushed.  Then our waiter got a large party of eight and a party of six.  That meant that we didn't see him for about twenty minutes.  I was frustrated by that, but having waited tables myself I understand stuff like that happens.\\n\\nCorkage was $20, not bad, but I hope they don't raise it.

There is a donut of the day to try out so you don't get bored.  Unfortunately, I'm on a sugar-free cleanse, so I wasn't able to test them out, but I will be back to try them another time.  \\n\\nSecondly, the interior has a somewhat New York City feel to it (think the coffee shop from Friend's just modernized), with exposed brick, crisp white walls, and industrial-type furniture.  The chairs could be a bit comfier; good for a chat with a friend but perhaps not a place to relax with a book.  \\n\\nAll in all, this goes on my list of top coffee shops in the city.

The seafood muqueca was great, especially the fish. We also got the mariscada, which was like a seafood casserole (included coconut milk I think, so it was almost curry like) which I thought was really tasty.\\n\\nI think we all liked it for the most part, although the food took a really really long time and we were starving.\\n\\nAnd, I had one major problem through the dinner which I should have realized beforehand -- I don't like cilantro.

This is even smaller than that, though hard to believe. The menu is written in chalk on the wall and you order at the counter just to the left of the menu. We walked in and waited among a few others. We ordered quite the smattering. Here what we had --\\n\\nK-Fries -- Crinkle-cut fries with a mix of spices typically seen in Korean cuisine. They were slightly spicy and served with a spicy ketchup. Absolutely delicious. \\n\\nPork Belly Bun -- Fantastic flavor. The kimchi inside of the bun was absolutely fantastic. The pork was a little off-putting as it was pretty fatty and not seared. Though, the flavor outweighed the texture. \\n\\nVeggie Fried Rice -- Pretty standard. Good stuff and a great item for sharing. \\n\\nBibim Burrito -- This was my wife's entree. It had all of the lovely flavors of bibimbap and was rolled up in a tortilla. They press the burritos in a panini press so they are pretty easy to manage. The flavors were great and the tofu made it a really hearty entree. Again, lots of kimchi!\\n\\nSpicy Chicken Burrito -- It was ok. The best part of this burrito was the rice and kimchi, but the flavor of the chicken was pretty flat and almost non-existent. It's also kind of funny, but the burritos actually have a small amount of cheese on them, too. They are also served with a small cup of sour cream and salsa. I guess that's where the fusion comes in! Pretty funny and not altogether a bad mix of flavors.\\n\\nThe guy that runs the shop is super nice. He came out with our food and even brought us an extra cup of kimchi after I asked about it. They make it in-house and grow everything from their garden up in Suwanee. So rad. \\n\\nThis place rules and I truly hope that it makes it/stands the test of time.

Lousy service.\\n\\n3 of us had brunch here last Friday.  Even though we arrived at 11:30 a.m., we still had about a 20 minute wait for a table.  We each had a different entree:  North African Sausage with over easy egg & couscous; Polenta & sausage ragu; and Shakshuka.  We also ordered Erin's sweet biscuits with blueberries to start with.  \\n\\nThe wait person brought our coffee and took our order.  She told us that the meals were served \\"family style\\" and may come out of the kitchen at different times.  True to her word, two of the dishes came first, the 3rd didn't come until the first two had been finished.  Note that these are not family style dishes, but rather single orders not meant to be shared.  I mean, how do you share a single egg?  The sweet biscuits didn't arrive until the last dish was brought, but they were kind enough to comp it as it had been meant as a starter.  Had it not been comped, I was prepared to send it back.\\n\\nHere's what I liked about our dining experience: 1. The food was creative, well prepared, and, as their name implies, very tasty.  2.  They screwed up on getting our starter dish to us, so they comped it.  That was the right thing to do.  3.  The staff was very friendly, even if we didn't see them very often.\\n\\nHere's what I didn't like: 1. The restaurant is located in a large, warehouse type building with concrete floors and walls.  This makes for a very noise place.  2.  They don't take reservations except for large parties.  What's wrong with making the dining experience a little easier for your customers instead of inconveniencing them with long waits?  3.  \\"Family style\\"  means dishes are large and meant to be shared with the table.  It does not mean that dishes are brought to the table when they are prepared, as Tasty n Sons does.  That is just using the term as an excuse to make preparing dishes easier for the kitchen staff.  Yes, it does take a little more work to be sure that a table's dishes are all ready to be served at the same time but the way it's done here all but guarantees that, as in our case, either someone's meals are eaten cold or are finished before another's meal is served.  Tacky, tacky, tacky.  4.  Would it have been all that difficult to serve a second cup of coffee?  The wait person came by occasionally to tell us that our dishes would be right out, but never offered a coffee refill.

I hardly ever get brisket...that will change!\\nThe food was so good and I didn't even mention the craft beer selection. To make this visit even better, I found out the owner was also the original owner of the Treehouse Food Truck (home of the famous Luther Burger)...PLUS, he's a native Puerto Rican...it makes all the sense now. I love that influence shows in the amazing flavor. \\nI know this was a long review, but this place really made my day. Not the same ol', same ol'. Not the typical chain BBQ...no offense to the infamous place of a few rivers, but this place got me good!

So, I sliced it up myself and hoped the majority of positive Yelp reviews would be right about my \\"Thailandia\\" pizza. Wrong.

They have a great team of very talented baristas and chefs. The location has lots of foot traffic so it's pretty easy to discover this gem. They're really trying to elevate the coffee scene in Canada. The food menu is pretty serious too. Everything is made in house. The creative mind behind the food menu is Jacob Deacon-Evans who use to work at Wildebeast, West and Bishop's. One of the heroes behind the bar is Cole Trepanier who is also one of the co-owners. He won 1st in the 2014 Canadian Western Barista Championships and placed 6th at the nationals. He was trained by Kyle Straw who won the Canadian National Barista Championship int 2009 and represented Canada at the World Barista Championships in 2010.\\n\\nWHAT WE TRIED:\\n- Coffee Smoked Duck, red eye hoisin waffle | $16\\n- Smashed avocado, ricotta, cilantro & maple syrup toast | $7\\n- Five Elephant Biftu Gudina Ethopia manual pourover | $4.5\\n- Macchiato | $3.5\\n- Cappucino | $3.75\\n- Smores shortbread | $2.95\\n- Classic Chocolate & Sea Salt Cookie | $3.50\\n- Roasted oat, coronation, grape, raison cookie | $3.50\\n\\nCoffee smoked duck, red eye hoisin waffles is our favourite dish that we have tried. The duck is cooked in three ways, coffee smoked duck breast, pulled duck and crispy rendered duck fat. It served with cucumbers and red eye hoisin on a brussel style waffle. Red eye is a type of drink which is coffee with a shot of espresso. I suspect the hoisin sauce has coffee elements in it but it's not overpowering.  The waffle is crisp on the outside yet airy, fluffy and light on the inside.\\n\\nSmashed avocado, ricotta, cilantro, & maple syrup toast. Added poached egg. Our favourite avocado toast in the city is at Nelson the Seagull and we always compare it back to them. For value, you're getting a better deal here with more types of ingredients but sometimes less is more. Personally I prefer something more simple and traditional with good ole butter, olive oil, salt, pepper and avocado on a tasty slice of bread.\\n\\nWe got a smores shortbread, Five Elephants Machiatto, and Slate Cappuccino. For their espresso drinks, they default to Pilot Anthem. The non-Canadian roasters are a $0.50 premium charge per drink. I went with Five Elephants and Slate because these are two roasters I haven't seen available in Vancouver. Five Elephants is from Berlin, and Slate is from Seattle. They have a really talented team behind the coffee bar but you be the judge! I think it's kind of nice they didn't advertise they have a barista champion behind the bar. The smores shortbread is blow torched per order! Make sure you stand by the cashier if you want to watch or take a photo! \\n\\nService:\\nReceiving your order is a bit confusing for first time customers. Depending on what you order there are different ways to get it.\\n\\nIf you ordered a baked good, make sure you get it from the cashier. Those aren't delivered to your table. I see a lot of customers pay and walk away to grab a table without waiting for the cashier to get the pastry from the display case. \\n\\nIf you ordered off the kitchen menu, they'll give you a card. The kitchen staff locate you via those cards.\\n\\nIf you ordered a coffee it gets picked up at the coffee bar. I have seen drinks come up at the coffee bar  and the barista would look around to figure out who ordered the drink. \\n\\nOVERALL IMPRESSION OF NEMESIS COFFEE:\\nNemesis Coffee has secured itself as one of my favourite spots for coffee. The food menu is quite unique and props to the chef for using coffee as an ingredient in some of the dishes!  It's exciting to see coffee explored in new ways. The presentation on these dishes look beautiful! Just a heads up the prices may turn off some customers.\\n\\nThe one thing I would recommend is being more active on social media with reporting what coffee beans are in stock. In the first 3 weeks, almost every time I came, there was a different bag of coffee to sell. If I hadn't gotten tipped off from someone in the coffee industry that there was a shipment of Onyx arriving, I would have no idea about it! An example would be Revolver's instagram account. Every week they do a post of everything that comes in. I see this in the mornings and make a decision if I want to walk to Gastown for lunch to pick up some beans! If we had a way to know when special stuff comes in that would be great!\\n\\nThe Good:\\n- Really fantastic coffee at a great location\\n- Bright space making it a great place to work.\\n- Unique selection of coffee beans not available at other local coffee shops\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n- First time guest may be confused how to get order\\n- Can be difficult to get a table at lunch, lots of campers!"},{"name":"Rino's Place","address":"258 Saratoga St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Great food.

They mentioned we might want to find a drink somewhere, but don't go away as we could be seated anytime. I wonder what happens when it is raining? We were on time, but the restaurant was not managing the seating times. Also,I feel they will have a better result if they hire someone to help them with the wine pairings. The wine pairings were inconsistent and served at the wrong temperature, so we ended up ordering additional wine to try and have a decent wine with dinner. The duck dish that we had was exceptional, but other than that there was nothing remarkable. The great outstanding issue here is customer service, or lack thereof.

When my family suggested that we try giving 4580 a \\"grocery list\\" of foods I could eat, I really thought I would just get a plain meal, meeting all my food requirements.  However, when 4580 gets a challenge, they rise like no other!  The meal they created from those simple ingredients was beyond delicacy!  I could not believe the flavors they put together, the beet, cucumber, and apricot salad to start was crisp, clean, and delicious, and then, the main course of lamb over risotto with pear and sweet potato; it was amazing, creamy, and perfectly textured, it was a meal that I would order over and over again even without my food restrictions. 4580 went out of their way and above and beyond to make my dining experience one that I will never forget.

Being Chinese a classic dish my dad used to make for me is fried egg over rice. This has a gooey sunnyside up egg and a hard boiled egg and the most flavorful, zesty, fall-off-the-bone, pork thrown in over a bed of rice. For me it was heaven!

The vegetable fried rice and the maki maki roll was really good to me.\\n\\nI also ordered a full order of vegetable tempura with our order and that never came out.

We usually alternate between the 2 Namaste restaurants in Portland (NE Sandy is the original).  We didn't have kids and had to have an Indian food fix so off we went to the closest Namaste to our home, NE Weidler St.  We over looked the inital lack luster greeting by the host/bus boy who looked depressed and angry the entire time we were there.  The food supply was weak, appeared to be old (as some had a thick dry crust on the pans) and the temp was warm on some dishes and the selection was meh.  Never the less, this has always been one of our favorite spots and we were without kids so we pressed on.  The difference in food taste, texture and consistency from past visits struck us immediately.  The food lacked over all flavor.  The condiment bar was a mess and appeared to be sitting for way too long.  We ate minimally and looked forward to ending our disappointment but first...... I always like to finish my meal with a mango ice cream treat..... except the ice cream machine was broken.  Maybe this explains the new higher price on dinner???  \\nSince we did not recognize any of the employees, upon paying we asked if the restaurant had been sold....yup.  Sold as a franchise to new owners.  We expressed the reasons we were dissatisfied and the cashier said he would mention it to the cook.  \\nWithin about 20 minutes my dining partner/gf experienced stomach cramps, profuse sweats and visits to the bathroom that should not be experienced by anyone.  Namaste, the gift that kept on giving.  I wish they had a negative star review.... we instead will call the city inspector Monday.   Please do not confuse this location with the NE Sandy location at this time (July 2017).

It's all a little over-thought and ultimately unremarkable.  The decor is suprisingly-bland, though generally comfortable.  Of course, the hallmarks of \\"southern\\" food (whatever that is really) tend be less about clever concept than about context.  It's almost never food that wows you with depth of flavor or interesting texture - it's food that you enjoy for it's simplicity and the people and place you're amoung.

A couple of the items on the menu that I can actually say I like: cajun wings, oysters on the half-shell.\\n\\nThe positives don't make up for the negatives, though.  The drinks are watery, even the ones that aren't on happy hour, and that makes them way expensive for their quality.  $6 is way too much for a tiny, watery cup of a mostly-ice house margarita, and the $8 ultimate is not gonna get you much better.  The crawfish should be avoided.  The spices on them taste OK, and I'll forgive them not being gigantic, but they just didn't taste as fresh as they should have.

Tons of family pictures and news articles from their town in Italy. Then menu ranged from $5 appetizers to a $200 call a day in advanced dish. All the typical Italian dishes are there, along with some Filippo specialties. A very large menu indeed. One thing that stood out was the rental property of the owners in Italy that one could inquire about for a vacation rental.

The butchers are knowledgable and will guide you with preparation advice if you need it, and will also offer the restaurant's way of cooking your selection.  Your meat will come wrapped in clean brown paper, tied up with a sprig of fresh rosemary to boot!"},{"name":"Thai City Restaurant","address":"1311 Florida Mall Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We went on a Sunday for lunch.

So we opted for downstairs just off of the bar (separated by a windowed wall) the outside patio was too chilly.  There was live music in the bar downstairs as well, and the only real criticism that I have for the restaurant is LIVE MUSIC IN A RESTAURANT SHOULD NOT DROWN OUT THE CONVERSATION OF YOUR PATRONS.  I mean,  I should be able to enjoy my dinner and the company and conversation of friends, not have to scream above the music.  This is a restaurant and not a club.  This is not the case during lunch hours.\\n\\nDinner was great,  and the food  at Cinco is not typically served spicy,  you kinda add that yourself depending on your tastes.  They have spicy sauces for the bold and brave, and less spicy for the not too adventurous.\\n\\nChips and salsa are a staple, but the way its served does not work well for people surrounding a table.  The wire basket is tall and the salsa is served in a small dish that you have to maneuver to get too.  But, the salsa and chips are endless and I like that a lot.\\n\\nLast night I had the shrimp tacos.  Not expecting the shrimp to be fried (its not listed as friend shrimp on the menu), but they were tasty along with the rice and beans, though the rice was a bit on the cakey/dry side.  I usually get the chicken enchiladas which are great, but opted for something a bit lighter last evening.\\n\\nWe have taken several friends to Cinco, and they have really enjoyed it. OH...and don't forget to try the Sangria-Margaritas because they are fantastic and strong as hell.\\n\\nOverall, a great restaurant and one of my favorites."},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I had been hearing good things about Highland Kitchen and my first experience there couldn't have been better.

There's a big ol \\"barn\\" nextdoor that has a pizza place in it, and it looks huge and awesome and cool - though weirdly they close at 5 on Sundays which was a bit surprising to me. Sunday pizza dinner on the brew-farm sounds amazing! I'd come back just for that!\\n\\nThere's a ton of area to walk around and enjoy the fresh air, plenty of tables to sit back and relax and enjoy libations with friends and/or family - and plenty of strangers who need pictures taken of them while they enjoy their time the same as you! \\n\\nThe day we were up there they also had a small flea market/craft fair kind of thing going on and we ambled through with beers in hand to take a look at the wares on offer, and ended up bringing home a nice picture frame to set on the mantle in the home we happened to close on on the day we left for Austin for vacation!\\n\\nIt was such an awesome experience, and I cannot recommend this place enough. If you're a sour fan, if you're a brewery fan, or if you just want to experience something really fun and wonderful, visit Jester King. Only maybe not during the middle of the summer because I imagine it gets mighty, mighty hot outside... But hey, there's always shade under the roof by the pizza place!

The spice rub on the chicken was incredible. The chicken was sauteed with the usual peppers and onions but they also added tomatoes and that was a huge plus for me. I absolutely love cooked tomatoes with any Latin dish. I'm not usually a fan of refried beans and rice but these had SO much flavor. The only thing that you may want to note, especially if you're ordering this as take out, they don't give you many tortillas so ask for extras :) \\n\\nWe also ordered the shredded beef burrito which was DELISH.

This is a 10-15 minute walk from my apartment and one of me & my friends favorite destinations on a Friday or Saturday night.\\n\\nFirst, the food is delicious.  My first time there, for whatever reason, I had the goats head soup (or something like that, reminded me of the Rolling Stones album).  As it's one of the pricier items, I basically got it because it was my birthday and I wasn't paying for it and someone told me it was rather spicy.  It was pretty spicy, but I'm not so sure I'm into goat meat anymore.\\n\\nI've had a decent amount of the items on their menu, but what I really enjoy most is simply the cheeseburger.  I know that's not too adventurous, and the menu here certainly offers a lot more, but sometimes you just need the simple things in life...and you need it done right.\\n\\nOver the last 5 years, I've developed this ridiculously overwhelming cheeseburger fetish.  I need to have one a week.  I'm either finding one to eat out, or perfecting my own cooking methods (currently I'm making skinny patties, cooking them on a cast iron skillet and using a cast iron grill press).  I know when I find a good burger, and I'm here to spread the gospel that Highland Kitchen has THE BEST BURGER IN CAMBERVILLE!  It's true.  It is so good.  The actual burger is a quality meat patty of love, cooked to your liking.  The bun is perfect.  Get it with cheddar cheese and you're in business.  I've been trying burgers everywhere this side of the river (I don't venture over to Boston to eat very often) and the Highland Burger stands high and above the rest.  You should go and sit at the bar, order the burger, have a beer while you wait (I suggest a PBR tall boy) and then another once you get your burger.\\n\\nSpeaking of the bar, it's a great place to hang if you can score a seat or at least a good standing spot.  There's not a ton of room, so a good spot is key.  But if you get a spot, belly up and spend a few hours at least.  The bar has several IPAs on tap, plenty of bottled and canned beers (such as the aforementioned tall boy pounders) and all the booze you'd probably desire (such as a nice makers on the rocks).  It seems it's always the same two bartenders working, who are both quick and attentive.\\n\\nThe jukebox is now legendary.  It's chock full of Americana.  Where else can you listen to the Stones Sticky Fingers, Gram Parsons, the Tarbox Ramblers, Booker T & The MGs, Bowie & Muddy Waters in the same place?  If you're a fan of classic rock, soul, country & blues...then you've found a home.  There's not a better collection I've ever come across.

There are some wonderful tasting bites up for mouth party. All the skewers are incredible, the specials are great, and better Hum Bao than most Chinese restaurants in Oregon. \\n\\nPrice really prevents Ping from crossing over into the 5 star marks that Pok Pok scores on a regular basis. PokPok is expensive for what you get, but generally you leave full. Not so at Ping, we chowed down, ordering a broad range of the menu items and both the days' specials. We were still hungry afterwards and wanted more to drink. Ping, and Andy Ricker (PokPok, Whiskey Soda Lounge, Foster Burger, Genius/Hard Worker) has set a new standard for alcoholic beverages in this town, and that bar is $8 or $9 a shot. It's just too much, two people-two drinks and some tapas food for over 60 bucks? At least when you drop in Toro Bravo you leave full and satisfied. \\n\\nThere are some ways to cheat the menu besides forgoing the tonics. Man, I don't know who brought it to them, but their Whiskey Sours are the best I've ever had at all 3 restaurants. To dodge the price fix on the small plates they do have some good size noodle and ramen dishes for around $10. These bowls are huge, and you can feast on them and be content with a variety of meats like the Duck with Duck Egg raman that's something to live for! \\n\\nIt's all good, but it does come off with a slightly overrated vibe. I guess if people are buying there's no reason to change the price. It's just a little more encouraging to head over to PokPok on Division and pay the same for more substance. It's hallmark right now is that it's better than most places in Chinatown. Ricker is getting it done with some incredible flavor, but do you want to pay for it?"},{"name":"Cafe Fresh Bagel","address":"1155 Washington St","city":"Norwood","stars":"3.5","text":"Terrible!

So if you have a little flexibility in your schedule, you should be able to get in and out of Rinos within an hour like I did. \\n\\nNow the good stuff. This place is FIVE STARS. It was one of the best dining experiences of my life. We got the salata caprese to start and it was a fantastic warmup for things to come. The mozz cheese was just so fresh and delicious. There were many things on the menu that looked amazing, but we learned about the place because of the lobster ravioli, so that is what we both ordered. I usually have such high expectations of a famous dish, that I am somewhat let down. Not this. It was better than I could have imagined. Everything worked so well together from the pasta, the light filling, to the sauce, and lots of lobster. They don't skimp on the lobster. And the portion is very ample. Then came dessert. I had the toasted almond cake.  It's the BEST dessert I have ever had at any point in my life. I don't know if they make it or buy it somewhere else. Doesn't matter....they serve it and I ate it there and it blew me away. \\n\\nIn closing, Rino's Place in Boston is simply the best Italian meal from start to finish that I have ever had. It was also one of the very top dining experiences I have ever had. I can't think of a single thing that we didn't like. We felt very welcomed by all of the staff and very much appreciated for our business. I have longed to have that meal many times since then.

Our meal ended with a smorgasbord of the desserts...we basically got one of each...my favorite was the Caramel doughnut holes...I literally MOLed (mmmm out loud). The caramel sauce or whatever was in the little bowl that came with it was ssssoooo good! I wanted to eat it with a spoon! The ice cream trio was super yummy as well.

One complaint is that the jasmine tea side had more ice, and was way colder than the yakult side. Probably a limitation of the split cup.

We only ordered two desserts because it was included in our voucher.\\n\\nService/Ambiance: Service was super friendly when I made reservations and when we got to the restaurant, they had a mix-up, saying we couldn't use our voucher on Sundays even though only Friday and Saturdays were listed on the voucher. When we showed the information on our phone, they had a problem because they needed us to write everything down like our name, voucher #s, etc. I have to remove one star from this review for their unorganized and slightly rude service.\\n\\nWould I come back?

We thought we would try this place out since they are new and close by. We walked in at 7:30pm (Saturday night) and ordered 4 slices of pizza from the slices that they had already made. The total that we where given was the equivalent of a fresh eight slice pizza so we decided to wait the extra 15 minutes for double the pizza and a fresh pie, we also added in some garlic knots. As soon as the cook heard that we where ordering fresh pizza he decided to flip the breaker and turn the oven on. We probably should have walked out right then because what pizza place doesn't have a hot oven ready to go? But we still wanted to try it out so we paid and came back 15 min later to pick up our food. The pizza had potential but it was extremely under cooked and the dough was raw and gooey in the center which was no doubt a product of the under heated oven. If they are trying to impress new comers who have lots of better options around they will have to be ready for business at all times. Also the attached picture below shows their contradicting hours of operation. It says they are open till 10pm tues-Sun but then it lists different closing times for those same days, very confusing.
