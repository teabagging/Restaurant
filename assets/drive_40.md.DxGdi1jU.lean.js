Self-labelled as an \\"Asian-ish\\" restaurant, looking to \\"do the simple things every day\\", the restaurant and its menu feels creative and inspired, without coming across as pretentious.\\n\\nWe came on a Wednesday night, around prime time and I would highly recommend reservations. After we were seated, the line-up at the door started to get fairly lengthy and frigid Boston evening temperatures can make that a difficult ordeal.\\n\\nWe ordered 6 dishes between 3 people: the pork buns, the tea-smoked pork ribs, the brussel sprouts, the hake, the duck skewers, and the wild boar dan dan noodles. Broadly speaking, this ended up being enough food for all 3 of us to be full and the dishes were relatively tasty (however some were too salty or too overpowering at times). On a more specific level, the pork buns were tasty: the meat was moist and the bao was soft and springy. It was also served with iceberg lettuce which, while unconventional, worked nicely with the dish. The tea-smoked ribs were decent, with a nice smokey flavour which may be overpowering to some. The texture of the ribs was a bit dry and chewy which made it different from what you typically expect from an Asian style pork ribs dish and the tea flavour wasn't that strong. The sweet and sour brussel sprouts were definitely a highlight, with a tangy spice and a char that added a nice crunch to the dish. The hake was also impressive as it was flavorful and paired well with the slaw with which it was served. The duck skewers were overall, pretty disappointing. The duck was dry and stringy and the flavor just wasn't interesting in comparison to the other offerings on the menu. The wild boar dan dan noodles was an interesting spin on dan dan noodles and was very much like a spicy dan dan dish with ground pork. It was quite spicy, so spice-sensitive people beware!\\n\\nOverall, M+C is a nice place to come with friends as it has a relaxed and modern vibe and the venue is still conducive to conversation. The dishes were well-priced for the most part but the servings aren't very large and some of dishes seem to be hit or miss.

It definitely looks small from the outside, but pretty spacious on the inside! To order a meal, you can start at the far upper left corner from when you enter the building to start ordering with the grains, beans and protein as they plate it all up for you before walking down the line to hot sides like potatoes, fried yucca fries and tamales. Next step, you'll get a chance to add some cold sides. Walking through, you may want to buy all the delicious and beautiful food items. \\n\\nThe roasted pork served on white rice. The white rice is seasoned and topped with the slices of roasted pork carved in front of you. The rice is soft, while the pork is tender and flavorful. My favorite part is the skin and this would be order again the next time I come! However, I do want to try other dishes too. Thing is, they don't have a physical menu printed yet.\\n\\nThe tamales come steaming hot and you have to be careful when opening it. It's the perfect temperature for each bite once you get to the actual tamale. The croquettes are made with protein on the inside and is very crispy on the outside. This is a wonderful Cuban version of mozzarella sticks, but with protein and more flavors.\\n\\nFor some sides, I ordered fried pork chunks and fried yucca fries. Both can be enjoyed on their own or with one of the dipping sauces offered. I'd definitely order both again and recommend that you try them too. I tend to order these sides everywhere I go to see how well it is done. Same goes for chicharr√≥nes! Fried pork belly or fried pork rinds are a way to a girl's heart. Her arteries may be clogged, but this sure is a great way to her heart. So crispy, yet so tender. It's very enjoyable with or without lime juice.\\n\\nThe avocado salad is unique, to die for and I HIGHLY recommend it! It is so fresh and has notes of lime and cilantro, which makes it so great and refreshing delivered by the smooth avocado and juicy tomato bites.\\n\\nAside from plated dishes, there are also sandwiches like this steak sandwich. Perfectly marinated steak with fresh vegetables between perfectly baked Cuban bread. Also, they have a whole case to show off all their Cuban bread.\\n\\nOn the other side of the Cuban bread case, there are sweet cakes and flan in another fridge. I'm not fond of sweets so these are never my go-to. Yet, my favorites are pastelitos - guava and cheese, guava, and coconut. They have the right consistency of crispiness and the right amount of filling that provides sweetness at CUBA 1800's. On top, they also have a thin sugar glaze. \\n\\nAlong with the pastelitos, you can't go wrong with a cafe con leche made with Bustelo coffee. What's even better is if you get a cortadito with some milk froth and sugar. It's an espresso drink made with Bustelo espresso. It's served in a little espresso cup and all you need to fuel you for the day. I definitely got my cortadito with milk and sugar. Definitely still strong and you can still taste the espresso - just how I like it. It's not too sweet even when they add sugar either.\\n\\nNot to mention, they also serve wine, beer and other drinks. Not to mention, their fresh juices are also refreshing on a hot Florida day. Their watermelon juice is like taking a bite out of a fresh watermelon slice."},{"name":"Palm Tree Grille & Bar","address":"351 N Donnelly St","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"2.5","text":"Do not go to this restaurant on a Sunday evening.

One of my Fasten drivers recommended this place--a local, he said that places like Franklin's BBQ were over hyped and that there were so many other places just as good--so my friends and I agreed to try this place.\\n\\nWe arrived on a Sunday night around 7pm--I immediately saw a long line outside--a good indication that the food was most likely going to be good (Tip: the parking lot isn't too big, so if you can, carpool or catch a taxi here).  We waited in line about 45 mins--not too bad.  By that time, they had already ran out of the beef ribs, so we were not able to try that.  So the way it works, is similar to cafeteria style--you grab your own tray, choose the sides dishes you want (small tray or a larger container size), then proceed to the cashier--where they have the meats there and you can pick which ones you want (someone cuts it for you).  We got the brisket, regular sausage, jalapeno sausage, and pork ribs.  For the sides, we got mac-n-cheese, green beans, Mexican rice, corn bread and the potato salad. (Tip: If you want more carbs, they give you free slices to white bread--but you have to get them yourself at the condiments area).\\n\\nEverything was amazing!!!  The meats were moist and very flavorful.  I loved all the side items too.  By the end of the meal, I was in food coma heaven.

She checked with the manager who loudly shouted \\"if it was an allergy, she would know!\\" and discounted the fact that I can't have dairy. I was trying to double check because there was uncertainty, and there was no need for the manager to react like that. There also aren't very many options for those with dairy allergies or vegan.

Don't they have any respect for themselves and their customers? I would be ashamed and embarrassed if my restaurant served something this burnt. We ordered TWO burgers and BOTH were burnt. The manager was apologetic and gave us a refund but I would much rather have edible food than my money back. Don't eat here if you have standards. Even a child could cook a better burger than this.

Next, our server was not very knowledgable about wine. We managed to go with a basic Merlot. When our wine was poured, we then noticed the glass was dirty.

Our waiter stacked the dirty plates on top of the plates with my food to be packaged up...very off-putting. Not only was the food service bad, but the waiter was very condescending to me. He didn't look at me when I was speaking and when he did talk to me, he looked at my fianc√© and not me.

The burger itself was o.k., if you like a slider sized burger that is devoid of the actual joy and passion of a slider.  Not the mention the price of this slider.  Call me crazy, but Five Guys has a better burger at a better price.  \\n\\nThe fries on the other hand...were the best I've had in a long time.  Crispy on the outside, moist mush on the inside, perfectly seasoned and with a nice grease factor.  The fries are probably the best I've had in the ATL.  \\n\\nThe Krispy Kreme milkshake was good, it was extra sweet and I don't mind that...but if you aren't into sweet tastes you probably shouldn't order this...or in general...shouldn't be ordering a milkshake to begin with!\\n\\nThe service was excellent though, I'll give them that.

The server asked for more bread for Brie and they sent out pita bread (not the companion to brie). I let the manager know about the issues and he had no comments about the pita, but said the thought behind offering only three tiny slices of bread with a large chunk of cheese was because they offer bread with the meal?

I definitely wasn't so bummed about Noon after trying this place!\\n\\nI've gotten the falafel over rice each time I've been, but most recently I've learned to get it WITHOUT white sauce, as the WHITE SAUCE IS NOT VEGAN (even though that meal has a (v) by it _, which I've always understood to mean vegan, also, it contains eggs if you're wondering). My husband has had the combo, which I think was chicken and shawarma (maybe he got to pick the combo???), just chicken, and the lamb, and he's loved them all...even if I wish he'd have just gotten the falafel. He likes to get a pita on the side, and they're definitely good pita! My favorite add on is extra pickle. I donno what kind of pickle they use in their salad, but it is SO good. It's now and extra $.50 for it, but I'm happy to pay it. On our last visit, this Friday, we got and shared an order of fries, which was enormous. It could've served 4 people easily. They were perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. Definitely something I'll think about getting again from time to time. \\n\\nThe staff here is really great--super friendly and welcoming. We've also recently made friends with a homeless gentleman who hangs out in the parking lot of this shopping center, and I know, along with other restaurants in this center, the owners of Halal Bros feed him regularly, for free. They're taking care of their community how and where they can, which is truly awesome. \\n\\nI really love that they have Maine Root sodas; the Mexican Cola and Diet Mexican Cola are delightful, along with so many others. I always have my stainless steel tumbler with me when we visit, and I'll tell them I'm having a soda or water but can I use my own cup instead of a plastic one, and they allow it, charging me accordingly if I choose soda. They ~don't~ have real silverware here, just plastic, and they ~don't~ have a recycling bin, which sucks, because they use ~mostly~ metal containers to serve their food in (super easy and GREAT to recycle), and the rest (the lid), is plastic, which could also be recycled. I would hope to see recycling bins in the near future to remedy this, since they DO use a lot of plastic silverware and cups in their business, plus the aforementioned wonderful-to-recycle foil trays (the lids of which they could switch to cardboard/paper maybe?). \\n\\nBut yeah, they're great, really, on all levels, and the fact that they take care of our friend makes them even cooler! The food is delicious, the prices are great, the portions are generous (seriously, I get 2 meals from my falafel rice plate), and the staff's wonderful.

Had to ask for refill of coffee & tea she did come around once to give a refill without having to ask but when there just 1 other tables in there I am expecting some pretty stellar service. \\n\\nSecond of all you need to update your menu to read what the food actually is, she said the B&G was a sausage gravy and that it was really good and that you all make your biscuits from scratch. I make homemade biscuits and these were more like cake and there was no actual sausage in the gravy at all it should be called Biscuits & Sausage Flavored Gravy. The slab of bacon we got was super undercooked on part of it because the fat was still clear; if you are going to offer up thick slabs of bacon like that you need to cook it better. \\n\\nI wanted to like this place so much but I just can't... breakfast is one of the easiest meals to make if you know how to cook bacon and eggs to order.

I also went in once for a quick slice and they threw a slice in the oven that even they hesitated to give me cause it looked like it had been sitting there since 11am.  The dough was tough, sauce was crusty and hard and the cheese was barely there. \\n\\nAll of the people who work there look like they are the young 20-something family members who don't want to be there, and don't really give a shit about presentation or good food.\\n\\nThey need a complete re-haul of the kitchen and a better cook who knows how to run a restaurant...oh, and I think considering the quality of the service and food, their prices are a little steep."},{"name":"Barley Swine","address":"6555 Burnet Rd, Ste 400","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing food, atmosphere, and staff!

Maybe too much crunch with the cabbage and tempura batter. Or the lack of flavor comparable to the fried Brussel Sprouts. I don't know. Honestly, the tacos here are a hit or miss anyway. I still like their tuna poke but since I'm on a vegan diet, that's not really part of the lifestyle so yeah. The drinks are still good tho. I usually get the seasonal caipirinha but opted for a Mojito Tinto! The bartender told me they add their mulled wine mix to the drink which is something totally different than I've ever had.

So many things to say. I was there yesterday with my wife, mother in law , who is a disabled vet and my eleven year old son. \\n\\nThe restaurant was blaring music, a couple with a newborn left because the music was so loud. My mother in law and myself, both disabled were told we had to wait on lone to order and there were \\"no exceptions\\". So we had to wait on line while our table remained greasy , unwiped and empty.\\n\\nMy mother in law was in pain and leaned on the railing and was nudged by one of the employees. Who told us we are in the way. My wife who has crohns also was on the line. When orders were placed we were told that fries would be first and burgers to follow. We made our way to the able, still greasy. The fries were late and the burgers came. My wfe and mother in laws well done burgers were rare and medium rare. The fries came 5 minutes after burgers. Also, the burger was said to be an angus burger. But beside my vet mother in laws burger being rare, it was dripping with grease! I did not understantd why a angus burger was greasy? Also my mother in law lives in ontana and was ion austin visiting my wife and her grandson for only 4 hours. This is where we came and what a disappointment\\n\\nI asked the server for another burger for my mother in law. They said they would bring it to the table. They never did! I had to go to kitchen area to ask for burger. By that time we just took it to go. There was no time left to eat burger.  Waitstaff was anything but professional.\\n\\nBTW, when we arrived a employee was beeping at me in the parking lor because i was taking to long to park at disabled parking. Also, another employee parked upfront in spaces for customers. \\n\\nOther people also complained and a waiter said that there was a problem with the cook in the kitchen! here is how a angus beef should be cooked.\\n\\nHow to Cook Angus Beef\\nSince Angus beef is a specific breed of cattle and not a specific type of beef, you cook it the same way you would cook any other meat. If you purchase ground Angus beef, you need to cook it until there is no longer any pink showing; if you are making a roast or grilling a steak, you should cook it until it reaches your preferred doneness. Because Angus beef is generally more expensive than other beef, make sure you don't overcook the cut.\\n\\nThis restaurant ruined a part of my sons grandmother and my wifes moms visit and ignored me telling them she is a disabled vet who cannot stand long.

However, we don't have anything like this in LA or OC in Cali and it does give you a Christmas vibe and a happy feeling with the hot chocolate and apple ciders:) good enough for a tourist to enjoy for few hours. \\n\\nLove the forest meat (I think that's what it calls) it's the bratwurst, had the grilled regular bratwurst in bun. Just so great in the cold weather. The apple cider wine was interesting and new to me, taste like a rice wine - ish with cinnamon cider tasted in it, served hot. The non alcoholic version is pretty lame tho.. not enough spice... very bland. Hot orange favored chocolate with marshmallows is also very good. \\n\\nFood options are very limited and HIGH calories. Like Belgium waffles, toasted nuts, popcorn, ginger bread, fruit dipped chocolate. Typical carnivals food I guess. Other then food there are some ornaments stores etc. And singing carols and some preformance. Went on a Sunday afternoon, not much going on but not overly crowded. So it's alright.

That group of people are the staff members of Southland.  Every single person who verbally attack us was a Southland employee.

Don't get me wrong - I'm a big believer in providing options for those who have allergies, intolerances, or other dietary restrictions.  But in my view, the majority of pies in a pie shop should be full flavor, full fat, full sugar, not gluten free, etc.  It's pie!\\n\\nThe pies I've tried so far:\\n-Blueberry cobbler - it was a decent cobbler.  Not as good as homemade, but still good for a commercial blueberry.\\n-Peanut butter (gluten free) - had a funky taste.  Not sure what it was, but there must have been a substitute ingredient in there making it taste like that.\\n-Chocolate Almond (gluten free/paleo) - it was ok, but was basically like chocolate fudge, not pie.\\n-Banana - solid, good banana pie.  Crust was a bit too chewy though.  But would get again.\\n\\nI also feel that it's very expensive.  $6.75 for a slice of pie!?  I can make several entire pies at home for that price. For a place that also emphasizes wise financial choices, this seemed at odds with their premise.\\n\\nI hold out hope for this new establishment and wish them well.

I thought the dish was a little bland and the tomato sauce a bit thin and expected more flavor.  But the portion was hearty.  My entr√©e was Adana Kebap, hand chopped lamb with red peppers and onion on a skewer served with rice pilaf.  The meat was fork tender and delicious.  I was expecting more than one piece of pepper and one piece of onion, but between my appetizer and entr√©e I was stuffed and I couldn't finish my dessert, which was baklava.  It had a nice flavor, not overly saturated with honey like some baklava.  My dining companion raved about the filet and the entire meal. \\n\\nA belly dancer provided fun entertainment. \\n\\nThe restaurant filled up quickly and it appeared the staff was a bit stretched.

We told her this shouldn't be right, so she gave us our money back to count it, but when we counted we only had $100 something dollars.  She herself pocketed $120 with her.  How could someone \\"accidentally\\" pocket that much extra money?!?! its ridiculous.  We told her and she only gave us $100 dollars back.  Now, if you were to do the math correctly, each of the 11 people chipped in $20 for about 8 people and 3 chipped in somewhere close to $30.  This should total up to at least $230.  When we counted up our money, after she kept the extra $20 that she pocketed, we gave her an extra $20.  So i guess in the beginning we gave her exactly $250 in the beginning.

You would think having a food establishment--more specifically a pizza place in the Davis Square area where there's plenty of places to get pizza the guy would be less of an enormous jerk.  \\n\\nI had gotten two coupons on my Shaws receipts for $2 off any large pizza.  I had used it once two weeks ago and when I handed it to the delivery driver, he said he did not need to take the coupon, just see it.  Fast forward to tonight when I try to use the coupon again and the owner tells me over the phone 'I see here in your account you have used this coupon before...I'm not going to redeem the coupon for you again.' I informed him that nowhere on the coupon it says 'redeemable once' and he replied saying \\"It doesn't matter what it says, the coupon is used to only get new customers and you have ordered here before, therefore you are not new...my job is to make money, not sell you $8 pizzas whenever you want them.'\\n\\nNow, usually I would not gripe over a coupon, but the attitude and overall remarkable unfriendliness is what spurred me to write this.  I get it, you're a businessman and want your establishment to thrive, but try coming off as a friendly owner on the phone instead of a penny pinching douche.  Just my two cents.

My non-alcoholic go-to (who are we kidding I eat them both at the same time) is the Valrhona Chocolate Crunch.

The \\"guacamole\\" tasted and looked like pureed avocado with mayonnaise mixed in it to stretch the ingredients I assume, it didn't have onions or tomatoes in it, just iceberg lettuce.  Ew.

I plan on coming back to see if it was an off day. \\n\\nIf this review was based solely on their dessert doughnuts, this would be a full five stars, they are just as EXCELLENT here as they are at the food truck location.\\n\\nI went to check this place out with a few family members about two weeks ago, I have been enjoying the doughnuts from their food truck for quite some time and figured \\"Man oh man, this place has to be the BOMB if everything else holds up to that quality.\\"\\n\\nSo, we walk in the door, stand there for a couple minutes... there's no sign indicating as to how one goes about getting a seat. After a couple minutes of not being acknowledged, we decided to seat ourselves. 5 minutes later we're brought menus and drink orders are taken. Service from here on out is your average dining experience\\n\\nWe ordered 5 items to share between everyone, following is the general consensus and breakdown of each.\\n\\n        \\n         1. Dirty South - Chicken fried steak, served atop a potato pancake with cream gravy, also comes with a spicy cranberry jam. All of this is atop a large doughnut.\\n\\n        The gravy, the jam, and the doughnut were all good. The chicken fried steak, was one of the toughest cuts of meat I have ever had to chew through. It was basically beef chewing gum. The breading was passable, left a little bit of spice to be desired. The \\"Potato pancake\\" should have been called \\"Flavorless potato mush\\" It was basically there to provide cheap filler to the meal. I could compare it to a scoop of high school mashed potatoes smashed between everything else. There was no depth, no texture contrast. Nothing. Blandest of the bland. I was hoping for a golden brown layer of \\"crispy on the outside, moist and fluffy on the inside\\" potato pancake. maybe with some green onions and caramelized garlic thrown in, some kind of flavor.\\n\\n       I think the whole idea of the \\"Dirty South\\" menu item could be wonderful if executed better. If I didn't have to drag all of my meal components around the plate attempting to cut boot leather meat. This dish is designed to have all the components eaten together, don't make it difficult to do so.\\n\\n\\n\\n       2. The Big Cheez - Mozzarella which has been wrapped in doughnut pastry dough and deep fried.\\n\\n           This was the best non dessert item that our group got. These things were spot on, great flavor, great texture. Golden brown and very visually appealing, Cheese that would dangle in long strings as you cut and pulled the next delicious bite to your mouth. We had the garlic butter as the dipping sauce and it was phenomenal, salty buttery goodness with plenty o' Garlic!!! 10/10 would eat again.\\n\\n \\n\\n       3. The Dizzy Porker - Chicken fried pork ribs, with BBQ sauce on the side.\\n\\n           Well, it's exactly what it says it is, no more, no less. No real hint of seasoning as far as the meat goes, it relies solely on the batter and BBQ sauce to impart flavor to it. The ribs were pretty tough as well, they should try parboiling the meat first to tender it up a little bit. Somewhere in there please work some damn seasoning in.\\n\\n           Again, good idea, terrible execution.\\n\\n\\n       4. Count Gourdough Cristo - \\"Oven roasted turkey\\", Ham, Swiss cheese, Roasted red pepper, basil, red onion. Wrapped in doughnut dough and deep fried. Served with avocado lime sauce.\\n\\n\\n          Oh snap, a new and creative take on a tried and true old classic. All of those ingredients sound delicious, AND wrapped in doughnut dough? NOT SO FAST. This was the dish that I wanted to love the most, I'm a big fan of Monte Cristos far and wide, and as I was the most excited for this dish, it also let me down the most.\\n\\n          First of all, powdered sugar is a must, especially here where the deliciousness of your sweet sweet doughnuts is your claim to fame. Don't hold back on the sugar now of all times. \\n           \\n          Second, \\"Oven Roasted Turkey\\" Really, who's oven? Was it an oven that was out back in the dumpster? This is hands down, bar none. the GAMIEST, f-grade 99 cent lunch meat turkey I have ever tasted. You know how there are certain Chinese food restaurants that you don't order chicken dishes from, because they all have the \\"Mystery chicken\\" flavor/texture? This is the turkey equivalent. The ham was alright, nothing to write home about. If you're gonna start slinging adjectives in front of your meat, you should at least make sure it isn't the WORST component of your dish. \\n\\n          Both meats were luke-warm at best, cheese was not melted. I attribute this mostly to the fact that the sandwich was very \\"Ball shaped\\" Flatten that bad boy out a little and the heat will have less thickness to travel through and more surface area will be exposed. No basil to speak of.\\n\\n This sandwich could be awesome if executed properly (seeing a pattern yet?)\\n\\n\\n          5. Their Sin-A-Bomb doughnut was indeed, the BOMB!!!

The food came out pretty quickly which was nice because we were starving.  The first course of the peking duck was good.  It was the skin on top of shrimp crackers and you use wonton wrappers to wrap it.  The skin was crispy and had nice subtle flavor and the cracker was crispy.  The 2nd course was a little unexpected for me as it was the duck meat very finely chopped and somehow stir fry with onions and veggies.  This was eaten with lettuce wraps.  This had a stronger flavor but I can barely taste the duck meat or was able to tell if there was meat in it.  The dumplings was ok, not the best.  Some buns had the juice in it, some didn't and they use dumpling flours, not bun flours, even though it's called a bun. We also got a nice complimentary sweet bun after meal, which was nice. \\nService was ok,  I think it would have been better if we can understand our waiter, she tried to explain that we can have the peking duck in different ways but we didn't know what she was saying so we stick with the normal.  Even when we paid, they tried explaining why they prefer using a debit card over a credit card but we didn't really understood either. \\nOverall, it was ok.

Arriving at 9:30AM there was already groups of people waiting outside. We walked into the restaurant to look for a sign in or a host but didn't see 1 right away. As a few minutes passes by the host had showed up, another couple putting their name on the list and the host mentioned that coffee is complimentary. It was our turn to add our names down and so we did. The wait for 2 was 25-30 minutes. Just like everyone else we grabbed a cup of coffee and waited outside.\\n\\nWe got a table after 45 minutes of waiting and brought our coffee cup with us. When we sat down a young fellow asked if we wanted a refill on coffee and we said sure, why not. Moments later, our waitress came by and took our orders.\\n\\nAfter looking at the menu, my husband decided on the Iron Miner's Breakfast and I decided on the Waffle Waffler. The Waffle Waffler is basically a choice of any 2 Waffle choices on 1 plate. Customers can also choose the \\" Waffle of the Month\\" as part of the combo. For this month, the Waffle of the Month is fruity pebbles (based on the sugary cereal). I chose the fruit pebbles and fried chicken. This is a great way to try 2 waffles instead of 1 full order. \\n\\nThe food arrived at the same time. The waffles looks great and I couldn't wait to try one. The fried chicken was hot, crispy and it sat on a scoop of sweet potato mousse and drizzled with rum Carmel. Despite the savory fried chicken, this could pass for a dessert waffle. The fruity pebbles was very fruity. \\nIt had fresh strawberries sauce on the waffle, fruity pebble mousse, whip cream and sprinkled with fruity pebbles. Both flavors were good but the waffles itself in my opinion weren't cooked long enough. I was hoping for a little crisp too it. The waffles were on the softer side. \\n\\nI sampled the Iron Miner's Breakfast and it was good. There was a lot on the plate from potatoes, eggs, sausage, chorizo and bread. The gravy on the potatoes was a bit heavy for us.\\n\\nThe bill showed up after we were done. We were both charged for the black coffee even though the host indicated it was \\"complimentary\\". I can't say I'm surprised but just a little shocked. The coffee isn't complimentary. It's a tactic to get people drinking coffee but the host should inform customers it's not complimentary. Drink all you want but just know it's $3.00 when you are done. \\n\\nThe service was a excellent. Our server was friendly, kind and answered our questions. \\nThe hallway to the restroom there is a huge dry erase board where kids can draw. Pick a color and draw away.

With a modern industrial vibe from the outside I wasn't quite sure if it was a restaurant or not. We live nearby and have seen many businesses come and go and re brand from that shopping center. My friends had heard of it first and  suggested we go as a brunch date. I looked it up online and thought, \\"neat. Chicken and Waffles and Coffee\\" all my favorite things. I ended up cheating on them and taking my partner the following weekend, as I knew he would enjoy the food and its rare to find chicken and waffles in the area. \\n\\nWe walked in and were a little confused. First, the decor is amazing. Reminds me of the coffee shop from Pretty Little Liars. You know what I mean. Just modern and chic and a little pretentious in the best way. But to the left of us when we walked in were electronic signs displaying the food menu that had \\"Hot Chix\\" (perhaps it was Wild chix, I can't remember) at the top and the logo brought Golden Chick to mind. Now, I love golden chick, so that's not a problem for me....but I was wondering why the decor didn't match their menu. Then you get up to the front and they have a small area to the left where you can order from a tablet or you could order from the bar. This was confusing as it wasn't really apparent what we should do. I ended up asking and the barista said we could do either. We ended up ordering and paying from the tablet and then selecting our seats. It takes a little while because the food is obviously made fresh. \\n\\nThe waffle was meh. Like I could honestly enjoy eggos for cheaper at home. But the chicken is legit. Has amazing spice to it and is cooked perfectly and pairs so nicely with the syrup. I was totally shocked; it was the exact opposite of what I expected. All in all we agreed that we would go back. And I did, the next weekend with my girlfriends. We had an amazing time and it was perfect for a girl date. \\n\\nBut I was telling them about how me and my partner wondered if they were going to rebrand. \\n\\nA few months later I am driving by and I see that they now have major \\"Wild Chix\\" branding all over their exterior and the shopping center. It looks like a fast food restaurant. But I come here to reviews and see that they still have the same decor and vibe on the inside. Are they trying to make it more apparent that the coffee shop and food are two different entities partnering together? If so, they should probably indicate on their website and social media that they have re branded and you should look for the Wild Chix sign, as it is not direct at all. \\n\\nI would go again, but I think they need to do a better job of explaining to customers what their establishment is and I think that the waffles and dish variety need to better reflect the prices they are charging."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I can't say I'm a fan of this place.\\n\\nI got the brisket and the pork ribs one early afternoon and felt that there just wasn't any flavor to the meats that they serve here.

The food itself was fine but it didn't blow our socks off like the reviews led us to believe.  \\n\\nThe Sriracha Fish Tacos did not have very much fish in it and felt pretty generic/gimmicky.  It felt plain and not well thought out.  Some extra toppings/sauces would have helped out tremendously here.\\n\\nThe side of garlic noodles was very plentiful as a side but I wish they didn't use lo mein noodles for this.  There was a good garlic flavor but I am used to garlic noodles being the thin yellow type, not the heavy, doughy brown variety.  \\n\\nThe coconut battered butterfly shrimp was the same as the fish tacos, pretty typical and nothing to rave about.\\n\\nI'd say to come in with the understanding that you will be experiencing Asian Fusion, and not at all anything close to an authentic Asian cuisine."},{"name":"Killer Burger","address":"2130 NE Allie Way, Ste 610","city":"Hillsboro","stars":"3.5","text":"Firstly, I have to say that I'm so in love with the fact that this place is so cutely placed in the streets of Tanasbourne. Secondly, yuuuuuuum. I'd never been to any Killer Burger before, but heard from so many people that it was delicious so I just had to go since it's so close to home now. The kid taking our order was awesome (I don't recall his name though, I'm sorry!) and helped me and my friend decide what we wanted since we had no idea what we were getting ourselves into. Then Shelbi came up to help and she was A ROCKSTAR! I was being a brat and couldn't decide which beer I wanted and they both helped me try and figure out which one would satisfy my taste buds, but to no prevail unfortunately. My burger was amazing, and I thought it was pretty cool that the fries were bottomless -- even though the burger is huge, so I don't know how you could possibly need or want more fries! The burger reminded me kind of like a five guys burger, but less greasy, which I LOVED! I thought the set up of the place was nice, but also trippy at the same time, because I'm so used to it being a clothing store.

It's a longer, narrower space with a row of tables on each side.  They've got a mix of tables for Korean BBQ as well as standard tables.We were seated all the way in the back.  Clientele seemed to be mainly Korean, which I took as a good omen.  I did notice that our table had one of the buzzer's that you'll see in some Korean restaurants, though I didn't notice one on the table next to ours, which seemed odd.  Maybe only the BBQ tables, and our table that was all the way in the back?\\n\\nI ordered the combo kalbi and soon du bu, while the GF had just a soon du bu.  Solid tofu stew, and the kalbi was good too.  Banchan  was pretty standard - some kimchi, mung bean jelly, seaweed salad, fish cake, shredded radish, etc.  \\n\\nThe GF ordered hers medium, and I ordered mine spicy.  Looks like there was a mistake as the two definitely came out switched.  Not a big deal for us, but I could see this being a deal breaker for some people.   They do provide raw eggs to put into the boiling bowls, which is something I always appreciate.\\n\\nThe stews came with stone pots of rice, but we weren't given any hot water or tea to put in there.  I probably wouldn't have noticed this as this isn't generally something I like doing (though my parents love that crispy rice/porridge like concoction), but the table next to us was given a carafe of hot water when their food was brought out.  Not sure if they asked for it specifically, if we seemed too Westernized (I'm a long haired Korean American, and my GF is white),  or something else?\\n\\nService was definitely a bit disjointed - in addition to the mixed orders and no hot water, there were some longish delays, we weren't checked on, and our kalbi came out when we were basically both finished with our stews.  Not unusual for many immigrant restaurants where the emphasis isn't on service, and not something that really detracted from our experience.\\n\\nWhile I'm not Korean enough to be yelling out for service (and this place seems too big and Westernized for that not to seem a bit weird), we did end up using the buzzer on the table after we had waited a bit for our check.  The ajumma who came over to help us was a little confused too, thinking it was the table next to ours (with the Korean couple) who had used the buzzer.  Yay for stereotyping?  \\n\\nIn any case, food was good, though the service was a bit disjointed."},{"name":"Even Keel Coffee Co","address":"38 NW Davis St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Great quality Cortado.

I have to say that I love how this place looks inside and out.  It's right on the edge of the Asia section and fits into the whole area perfectly.  The inside has nice wood panelling everywhere, with a wooden staircase in the middle that our hostess said came from India.  There are all kinds of artifacts, trinkets, and furniture to look at.  We sat on the second floor by a window that gave us a good view of the crowds walking around. \\n\\nFor an appetizer we got the pan fried potstickers, which were actually my favorite part of the meal.  We ordered family style so that we could share.  The chicken lo mein was good, with a generous amount of noodles and chicken.  I didn't feel the same way about the honey chicken.  For a nineteen dollar dish I felt that there was far too little chicken.  The only part of the meal that was a total dud for me was the dessert.  I had found a list of the five best desserts at Disney and the fried wontons with cream cheese from Yak and Yeti was one of them.  The person who made that list is crazy.  I wouldn't put it in the top twenty desserts I've had at Disney.  It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't get it again.  Overall it was an enjoyable meal.

Their servers have always greeted us warmly and they have a very good lunch special. I do suggest if you don't like a spicy dish then try butter chicken. Their basmati rice, naan, chopped salad and chick peas are to die for. The butter chicken itself is so rich in flavour and sweet in taste. \\n\\nWe always order Samosas for starters. It's not a traditional triangle shape as they made it round and big. Stuffed with a lot of flavours inside so this dish might make you half full. \\n\\nI recommend trying the chicken tikka masala with garlic naan. This was my first time trying this dish and I cannot fathom how delicious this dish was. I personally would ask for extra garlic naan because the sauce on this dish is amazing. \\n\\nOne small flaw I would say is that the price range for the dishes are a little high. I do understand that maybe due to it being a new restaurant they would want to see where their value in the market place would be.\\n\\n\\nOverall I would give it a 8.5 / 10. Their service, menu and food dishes are great. Prices for the food are pricey and sometimes the naan could have more garlic on it.\\n\\nWill be going to this restaurant again today after a long hiatus. I can't wait !"},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"As a devotee of high-end nouveau donuts, I was excited to try Blue Star on my trip to Portland. And I was not disappointed! My gold standard is Doughnut Vault in Chicago, and while I think my hometown's prime donut purveyor is overall slightly higher in quality, Blue Star has a wider variety of flavors while maintaining a level of quality far beyond ordinary donuts.\\n\\nI ordered four and ate them all over the course of a day. Oops. Two onsite for breakfast (I came on a Friday morning around 10:30 -- there was no line) and two back at my airbnb that night for dessert. Here's the rundown, in order of consumption that also happens to be pretty much in order of preference:\\n\\nBUTTERMILK OLD-FASHIONED: I will judge any donut shop by this baseline, the classic plain old-fashioned. Blue Star's take is distinctive and satisfying. The typical old-fashioned is compressed to be flatter than other donuts, but this one is thick as hell, with a fluffy texture and rich flavor. You can definitely taste the buttermilk. It's almost halfway between a donut and a biscuit. The sweet glaze is the perfect finishing touch. Bravo.\\n\\nCREME BRULEE: One of the fancier (and more expensive) offerings here, I heard it often sells out early so of course I had to try it when I saw it was still available upon my visit. The best part about this donut was the surprisingly crispy outer shell (apparently they are \\"torch-fired by hand\\" to create that crispiness, which sounds labor-intensive so I guess that's why this one is pricier). When you get past that delicious coating you have a nice brioche interior filled with tasty custard. I'm not refined enough to know the difference between creme brulee and ordinary custard filling, but either way this hit the spot. This one also comes with an insane vial of citrus liqueur that you're supposed to squeeze inside the donut like a syringe. I think that's gilding the lily a bit, the donut doesn't need it, but it's certainly a unique touch.\\n\\nORANGE OLIVE OIL: The friendly worker behind the counter said this was one of her favorites, so I took her recommendation. The orange flavor here is very subtle. It's a powdered sugar cake donut with a pleasant, low-key citrus infusion. I have to admit I didn't really detect the olive oil or spices that are apparently in the powdered sugar, but the overall donut was quite nice so I guess they did their job without me noticing.\\n\\nCHOCOLATE BUTTERMILK: Probably my least favorite of the quartet, but then it was my fourth donut of the day so maybe I was just burned out. The chocolate flavor is, again, pretty subtle. Adding chocolate to the buttermilk old fashioned doesn't necessarily improve it, it's just sort of an alternate version, so I would say get one or the other but not both. But if I had tried this one first, I could well be declaring it my favorite because it's still a very high-quality donut. I just wish I had ordered something less similar to the first one I tried.\\n\\nI wish I lived in Portland so I could come here all the time and try all the different varieties!\\n\\nP.S. The reviews complaining about the prices are from people who obviously don't really care about donuts. And if anyone tells you they prefer Voodoo or can't decide between Blue Star and Voodoo, that person is an idiot, I went to Voodoo and the donuts there are cheap crap."},{"name":"Veracruz All Natural","address":"2505 Webberville Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Prepare for a line any time on the weekend, and limited to no parking but what great Austin food has either?

I was intrigued by the idea of a shrimp burger as I've never had one before so I just had to try it and honestly it was fantastic. The fried lemon that comes with it adds such a nice zest and you have to get it with an egg because that just tops it all off, recommended to me by the server which was a nice touch! Granted, it may be a little messy to eat but well worth it for the taste and experience. Fries do have to be ordered separately but those are also very well worth it as it just finishes off your whole meal to get that classic burger and fries experience. Servers are also extremely nice and courteous I was seated fairly quickly with little to no wait from the time I arrived and was head first in my burger within about 15 minutes from the time I arrived.

TV with Asian game shows playing (I like!) and Spotify 90s Rock playing, too. Service was very friendly!\\n\\nWe got the chrysanthemum tea & the kimchi fries to start.

They bring you 2 long lists and a pen where you mark your choices and specify whether you want a large or small plate.  The first list is their regular menu, the second are specials from whatever region they are focusing on at the time.  Last night when I visited it was Burgundy, and I was tickled pink to find a complimentary Burgundy wine list to choose from.\\n\\nMost impressively, they were more than accommodating to our friends who have a darling 1 year old.  She is, I should add, a particularly well behaved child, but all kids come with a little extra work and the staff at Navarre went above and beyond to make her and all of us feel comfortable.\\n\\nThe problem, which is just a tragedy, was the food!  We, being two food obsessed couples immediately dropped our inclination to cherry pick the best sounding dishes from the menu and opted instead for the \\"Chef's Choice\\" menu.  At $28 per person we expected this to be a delightful mix of some of their tastiest concoctions, offering the requisite surprise of not knowing what is coming next.  Chef's choice is supposed to be an adventure and we were raring to go!\\n\\nSomeone must have forgotten to tell the chef the kind of person who delights in the \\"Chef's Choice\\" because last night he apparently used our order as an opportunity to rid his kitchen of all things bland and stale.  Dish after dish was a disappointment with a few exceptions:\\n\\n1. Cabbage Souffle -  It tasted more like lasagna than cabbage, it was a real surprise and an indulgently rich treat.  (Umm, the cabbage is the highlight of the meal, if that says anything...) \\n\\n2.  Crab Cakes - They were gone in an instant.  Big chunks of crab meat held together by some magic, certainly not dry breading.  With an interesting tangy sauce and crisp edges, it is worth a trip just to enjoy these little pieces of perfection.\\n\\n3.  Halibut - Cooked just enough, but not too much, clearly prepared with love.  However, the large dallop of sauce on the side fell flat.   It had so much tarragon I couldn't even identify the other ingredients that made it some sort of green and white coulis.  Very strange overuse of a spice that doesn't lend anything special to the delicate flavors of perfectly cooked, flaky, creamy halibut.   I'm so thankful they didn't cover the halibut in it.\\n\\nOverall I did not feel satisfied when the bill came around with a total of almost $200 for our group of 4.  When you love the food, you don't mind paying twice that.  When the food leaves you wanting, this seems like an unfair price to pay for disappointment.  Navarre has some incredible potential, but it will sadly not be realized by sending food lovers dry chicken, hard day-old lentils, butter leaf lettuce with olive oil (butter leaf??  why not even arugula or spinach or something with a little flavor if you're seriously just sending us lettuce leaves?), thin strips of  WAY over cooked vegetables (I think they were veggies) covered in a thousand unflavorful spices and long thin strips of red, rare bison without any pizzaz (which I did not try after seeing my husband taste, look away, and go back for more lettuce leaves).\\n\\nI was disgruntled the whole drive home, based on the reviews had been SO excited about this place, and I'm afraid we were dealt a bad hand.  Luckily the company was incredible and our friend's daughter provided ample entertainment with her gusto for taking long swigs of juice from her tippy cup and giving a loud satisfied Ahhhhhhhhhh and a big toothless grin afterward.  At least she was satisfied. :)"},{"name":"Babica Hen Cafe","address":"15964 Boones Ferry Rd","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4","text":"Babica Hen, I am not sure what to think of you.

Both tables beside me looked at me in total judgement that a pretty thin framed person like me managed to inhale everything in front of her like Kirby. \\nI ordered the Fricassee - a tomato based stew with large portions of tender beef, potatoes, and sunny side eggs on top. Highly recommend if you like tomato-y meals. \\nI got a couple of their waffles as well, because you can't come here and not order the waffles. I honestly should've just ordered one, but #yolo. I also got greedy with the sauces and ordered two - raspberry caramel sauce and the milk chocolate lavender sauce. The caramel was my favorite :) \\nLastly, I did order the white mocha pistachio latte. Also very good! But it's very light and you could barely taste the espresso. It reminded me of Saturday breakfasts with the family when I would demand my mom give me some coffee and would poor a couple teaspoons in my milk, just enough for me to taste it :P \\nOverall, you can't make a stop to Van City without coming to Cafe Medina - service is great, ambiance is great and the food is worth waiting for!"},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"4360 13th St","city":"Saint Cloud","stars":"4","text":"LOVE this Chick-Fil-A!

And the crispy potatoes with shishito pepper relish is phenomenal (I would buy so many jars of that relish). The boa have been hot or miss, but I can forgive that based on how many great dishes there are. \\n\\nOn top of the food, the staff is always friendly and happy to see you.

Its fun southern exterior looked always caught my eye. I finally took the time to stop by last weekend to see if the restaurant's food and dining experience was as fun as it looked.\\n\\nLocated at the intersection of Morse and Pennsylvania, we pulled into Coop's gravel parking lot and were able to find a spot. My wife sat outside at one of their picnic tables while I went inside to see how this place worked. The Coop has a deli-style setup (although the inside seating area kind of looks like a cafeteria) where you get in line, look at a menu on a board behind a counter, walk along and see some food set out for presentation, and then put in your order at the end. They had some cinnamon roll samples out that I got to try. The rolls were pretty good, but really really sweet (aka southern). \\n\\nI got up to the counter and put in my order for a fried chicken, bacon, and maple bourbon syrup waffle, as well as a Coop Benedict for my wife. The lady handed me a stick with a number, I got my drink (plus for having Cheerwine), and I headed outside. \\n\\nAfter a little while, the waiter brought our food out. It felt like a long time though because the place outside was a bit of a mess. Some people had left treys outside and these weird berries had fallen all over the place. I get that it's outside, but a little effort to keep the cute picnic tables cute would have been nice.\\n\\nIn terms of our food, everything was ok. It was nice having bacon with both of our meals, but the bacon wasn't very crispy as you would expect from a southern dish. My biscuit was acceptable, but it wasn't as good as other chicken biscuits I've eaten at places like Osprey Tavern or even Chick-Fil-A. It also didn't help that the wrapped silverware that we obtained from the inside was all dirty (gotta check before you wrap). I really wanted to like this place because of the cute exterior, but everything just struck me as underwhelming. \\n\\nOverall, The Coop is a cute location that provides an average experience. If you are really in the mood for some southern food in Winter Park, then you could do worse than going here. However, the long list of better options around the area made The Coop a one-time stop for me (at least for breakfast)."},{"name":"Barley Swine","address":"6555 Burnet Rd, Ste 400","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Everything was awesome.

Why? Because the food, service and overall experience were just that good. \\n\\nOur party decided to split everything family-style (which they recommend and which IS traditional). We got the garlicky spicy coal-black wings, wok-roasted mussels, tea-smoked pork spare ribs and mama chang's pork and chive. No vegetables because veggies are for suckers who care about stupid things like good health.\\n\\nMan oh man was everything tasty. The chicken wings look burnt to a crisp but aren't and come served with a housemade sriracha sauce that DOESN'T hold back on the spice. The pork ribs were so freakin' good we licked the plate clean (okay, not literally) and ordered a second. One bite and the meat just falls off the bone. Our waiter told us they smoke these babies for 3 days to get them that tender.\\n\\nStellar service was exemplified by the numerous staff members who kindly came out to help us clean up after the accidental spillage of a cocktail. Speaking of cocktails, the St. Shar Pei and Kyoto Kiss are both quite tasty, though I like the St. Shar Pei better. For all you non-drinkers out there, go nuts over their housemade--that's right, housemade--sodas with incredibly unique flavors like lychee-vanilla and cherry-ginger. Two of our party got those and they were superb, esp. the lychee-vanilla.\\n\\nAnd who could resist dessert? After a long menu perusal of 3 minutes, we decided to get the \\"Ancient Chinese Secret\\" chocolate mousse with homemade 5-spice meringues. I think I died and went to non-toothache-inducing heaven.

But first - strategic advice - TRY EVERYTHING , ask the staff re: how much of each - but don't limit yourself to one thing.  The staff couldn't be friendlier or more helpful.  Here's the deal - beef rib blackened on the outside and melting off the bone (my favorite thing there); pork ribs was moist perfectly prepared and delicious; brisket beautifully seasoned -  to die for... Sausage had the right amount of kick and was juicy.  Sauces - original, spicy and sweet were all great, but totally not necessary.  The mark of great Austin Bbq is that you don't need to put anything on it.  It's perfect just the way it is.  We tried a few sides - all very good - Mac and Cheese, string beans, pinto beans and Cole slaw.  But the star of this show is the meat. Ribs And Brisket at the top.

Plus there is a very large bar area that is first come first serve seating which is a joke and unnecessary. People stand in the middle of the room fighting for tables so they don't have to wait the 40-60 absurd minutes to get a regular table in the dining room? Once you get seated you are tortured with the same tired menu I looked at years ago at this place. It never changes with average boring selections with no taste. I agree this place is just slightly above the Chili's across the street but it still is a horrible chain. The Chicken Club I ordered was like something I could get at Friendly's with a crazy high price ($27 bucks for two chicken clubs and two cokes??)

As diners we are fortunate to have so many choices depending on our appetite and budget: old school diners, upscale cafes, food carts and trendy bistros. Many of these places have long lines on the weekend and you have to decide, \\"Is it worth it?\\" There are very few places that are special and unique enough to make the line-waiting cut in my book and Bijou falls below the line.\\n\\nOur first family visit didn't involve much waiting so we were lucky in that regard since I regularly see long lines on the weekend. Part of this may be the excellent downtown location close to several large hotels. I suspect many visitors are directed to Bijou by the front desk staff of various hotels. I would advise visitors to our fair city that they can do better.\\n\\nBijou seemed to be THE breakfast hot spot a couple of years ago when I first joined Yelp [1]. But the times have changed and their competition continues to grow and raise their game. The prices here seem high for what you get. And in a town obsessed with coffee, it strikes me as odd that they serve Kobos. I know they are one of our oldest local roasters, but the choice seems dated.\\n\\nI've ordered a variety of breakfast and lunch items during my visits. The tuna melt on foccacia was very good. My Buckwheat noodle salad tasted (ahem) healthy. The sausage is served as one large patty and the fruit platter was one of the lovelier I've seen lately with a colorful and flavorful mix of pears, apples, pineapple and dates. The interior is spacious with two large counters that remind me of a stripped down version of an old fashioned soda counter. One bonus, especially during the rainy months, is the enclosed waiting area.\\n\\nOn my latest visit I ordered the brioche french toast (bread is from the Pearl Bakery) and it was quite nice. Not the best french toast in the city (my current fave is Cafe Du Berry), but very good.\\n\\nIn another city, I would be more of a fan.

The Breakfast Club is a small brunch joint in Lower Allston that mimics a classic diner from the 80s. There are no reservations and the wait tends to get long on weekend late mornings, with a line out the door. They can accommodate medium sized groups of 6 and have booths as well as regular table seating and bar seats. If you come around 10am on the weekend your wait will likely be short. When my group was walking out around 11am, the line was at least 20 people long and out the door. \\n\\nFitting with the theme, the restaurant is decorated to look like a diner, with grungy furniture and fixtures. It is a stand-alone metal building with 2 dining areas adding up to no more than 750 sq ft. The walls are decorated with prints from the 80s and movie posters from the same time period. There are old video game and board game boxes for display over the booth area. The place is not dirty by any means, however it seems dirty because of the decor. \\n\\nThe service is very mediocre. The 2 times I've come here, we've been greeted with servers that were either slow or sassy. Additionally, they initially served us 1 bottle of water for our group of 6 people, not even enough to fill up everyone's glass halfway! Our server also was a bit sassy when taking orders and we did not appreciate this. It seemed like would rather be elsewhere. \\n\\nOnto the food--the menu is standard American breakfast food. Heavy on the egg options, a decent amount of sweet options, and some sandwich options. The first time I came, I got the turkey panini with sweet potato fries. The turkey is fresh cut, with streaks of the natural fat still present. Unfortunately I did not enjoy this and therefore had to pick the fat pieces out of my sandwich. Others may prefer this type of turkey, but not me. The second time I came I got the BLT. I asked to sub the mayo for chipotle mayo, because there was chipotle mayo written under a few other sandwiches, including the one I got last time. However, the waitress told me that it might not be available, and if not did I want regular mayo. She was right! There was no chipotle mayo somehow and I ended up with a regular mayo BLT. Suspicious  The fries were mediocre and bland. The food I've had here is overall mediocre. The only saving grace is the delicious milkshakes and smoothies! They come in very large glasses and taste very fresh! I've gotten the peach and mango and both were very very tasty. You can combine flavors too- my friend has combined the coffee and chocolate milkshakes and it's so good! There's an extra $1 fee for half and half shakes. \\n\\nI would only come here for the shakes and smoothies. The food is just okay and the ambiance is lacking.

I had the same phone issue later in the week, even called once and no one ever answered, so I hope they get that problem fixed. When we arrived for dinner that Saturday night, there was a sign on the door that said they were out of brisket and turkey. I was pretty upset, but I spoke with the manager and he remembered that I had called earlier in the week, so somehow they rustled up a little brisket, lots of chopped beef, a few ribs, and plenty of sausage for all 16 of us. After a short wait they had our tables ready. The sides are awesome. You pay $2 per side, and you can load as much of it as you want on your plate. I recommend the mac and cheese.

Yes, we love to eat, and after dinner we just have to eat dessert. More food to stuff ourselves with!\\n\\nAs we walked in into the dining room area, I fell in love with the European interior and touch that they put into this place. The nice server lady gave us our dessert menus. Yes the desserts have separate menus with mostly slices of yummy looking cakes. \\n\\nI ordered the Black Forest cake. When I was growing up in Indonesia, my family almost always ordered Black Forest Cakes for birthdays and special occasions. Since I've lived in Portland, I didn't have any of it until I stumbled here. \\n\\nAll I can say is that the Black Forest cake was pretty da bomb. I love sweets, but I can't eat too much of sweet stuff. I inhaled as many of bites of this cake as possible and still couldn't finish few bites of it left. The slice of this cake was pretty good size for $4.50. I think the Chamomile tea that I had with it was a good beverage pairing. \\n\\nWe will come back here again for dinner next time. All dishes on their dinner menu sounds wonderful and they smell really really good. I'm happy to know where to get dessert around my southwest area. I have to walk about 1 mile there, I think it's good to balance out all the calories :D."},{"name":"bartaco","address":"969 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Food is amazing and fresh !

Everything is cafeteria style, so you start out ordering drinks, then sides and desserts, and finally, meat.\\n\\nThere is a glorious amount of sides and I only wish I had enough money and space in my stomach to try them all. They have creamed corn, collards, baked beans, green beans, coleslaw, potato salad, Mac and cheese, spicy rice, and cornbread. For dessert, they have banana pudding, pecan pie, and peach cobbler. Really, if this wasn't a bbq place, you could come here just for the sides and feel full.\\n\\nMy favorite sides were the green beans being that when you're eating something as heavy as bbq, you really want a fresh and light side to help justify you eating this meal. I am slightly regretful I didn't get the creamed corn however because it looked really good. \\n\\nAfter you decide on your sides and desserts, you go to a station to order meats by the pound. The ever so famous beef rib is a must here--and usually comes at a minimum of 2 lbs, averaging out to be around $26-30 for one rib. It sounds pricey but it's absolutely worth it. \\nThe rib is the most tender and flavorful piece of beef you will have at a bbq place. It literally falls off the bone when you breathe on it. I also love the rub on the outside and thought it was brilliantly juicy and flavorful. \\nThe brisket does not fall flat as well. For a pound, you get about two thick slices. A good fat to meat ratio, making it super tender but not in your face fatty. I love the rub and the smoke for this one as well. \\nIf you want any red onions, pickles, or white bread for your bbq, you can find them at the counter near where you pay. \\n\\nIf you're looking for great bbq in Austin without waking up at 4am, look no further. This place is worth every penny."},{"name":"Himalayan Kitchen","address":"40 Bow St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"I ordered steamed pork Momo (popular dish here) and the Choiyla (very traditional item - a good spicy).

The cheese fries, oh the cheese fries! Probably my favorite item on the entire menu. I love the consistency of the cheese. Creamy, but not too heavy. Not too salty either, just the right amount. The salted caramel shake was exactly what my sweet tooth needed at the time. Delicious!\\n\\nThe staff is wonderful! They bust their butts in and out of the kitchen.

I wish I had gone with a classic cheeseburger because I felt it had too many elements that overwhelmed the flavor of the beef. (It came with brie, truffle aoli, caramelized onions and steak sauce which in retrospect was all too much) I was underwhelmed. The beef was OK and the fries were also just OK. (too thin and short)\\n\\nThe milkshakes were outstanding. They gave us a free sample while online of their almond joy (yummy with bits of real coconut flakes) and my husband got the nutella & chocolate pretzel which was also really really good.\\n\\nI love love burgers so my standards are pretty high.

You got to be lucky to score a free limited parking space.  You see the pit while standing in line with all the hungry souls.  45 min to one hour wait in line, but strangely it wasn't long since there's time to read yelp reviews and plan out our tactic of attack. You can go get drinks at the window (credit card only) while you wait. There's picnic tables outside so you admire, actually envy them for their tray of food. The line snakes inside and finally the side dishes are in front, like cafeteria style. 2.50 for small side 5 oz,  5.99 for pint size. Restrain yourself from over ordering. We didn't. We got small size of creamy mac and cheese, the mexican rice with red peppers/onions cooked with it, green beans, and cole slaw with a kick. All delicious. Loved them all. The ladies behind the counter were wonderful. We grabbed a hot off the oven plastic wrapped cornbread on the counter. Dessert choices was hard to pick. Settled on banana pudding, 3.00, , the least sweet over the pecan pie and peach cobbler, ice cream 1.50.  The final station was in front of the carver with your mouth drooling and can't \\"wait to bite into the brisket and ribs\\". You order by the slice, pound or per rib. They ran out of sausages and turkey. We over did it. Got 7 ribs and one pound of brisket, ask for \\"mix- with fat\\" over the lean (too dry). Pay your feast and find a seat. They discouraged hoding seats before ordering.  There's gallons of sweet tea, pickles, onions, white kilpatrick bread, to go boxes, lime, water, plastic silver ware, and paper plates for you to grab. Rolls of paper towels are on your huge thick wood dinning tables.  I used at least 4 sheets! dive into your feast. Inside, I'm containing my ooing and awwwing. So yummy. This was the meal of the day (literally).  Everyone in the dining were happy.  You won't find a depressed person in there. By the time we left there were more people in line at 8:00 pm. We got there 6 pm. This was Saturday night. The weather was excellent, not chilly at all. There are signs that they will give free tours of the pit but how can you break up the time to do that?

I think I prefer the downstairs area as it seems cozier and better appointed than its upstairs counter part. \\nWe were seated upstairs and the noise level increased with each minute, to the point it was hard to conduct a conversation without straining the vocal cords.\\n\\nOur waitress Marilyn greeted us right away and was very helpful throughout the evening, making sure we had everything we needed.\\n\\nIt you aren't very familiar with Ethiopian food, the menu may seem a bit daunting but don't you fear - you can find translations for common ingredients and spices in the margins of the menu. \\n\\nThey have a full bar as well as some traditional choices such as Ethiopian beer and honey wine. The wine is slightly sweet and acidic at the same time.. Would not be my first drink of choice.\\n\\nWe started out with the Kifto slice app, requesting it being prepared rare with no butter and minimal amount of oil. Well.. this didn't exactly go as planned. \\nThe meat was cooked med-rare (which isn't bad exactly) but it was served between deep fried tortilla discs and literally dripping with oil. After blotting some of the oil and getting it out of the soggy tortilla, I finally took a bite and it was actually quite nice. The texture wasn't as soft as the traditional steak tartare, with a bit of pleasant chewiness. If only they didn't soak it in oil.. The description also had a mentioning of cottage cheese and jalapenos but there were none in our app. I think next time I'll try it as the Kifto entree.\\n\\nFor our meal we decided to split the Meat lovers entree with a side of rice, injera, miser (split pea stew), and gomen (collard greens) - perfect for rookies who don't really know their Ethiopian dishes yet LOL. We went with lamb, filet mignon, and fish (tilapia to be exact) as our meat choices - hold the onions.\\n\\nI was in for a surprise. Lamb was my first choice and it was cooked quite well - tender and flavorful, just as I was hoping for. The surprise came next as I did not expect to like the fish. I don't really like my fish cooked and prefer the raw sashimi instead but this one was actually quite tasty and not overcooked, with a touch of sweetness and a hint of caramel to it. \\nBiggest disappointment was the filet, which was overcooked, dry, and almost crunchy in its overdoneness. We actually ended up replacing it with chicken, which was a much better move as it was juicy and cooked well.\\n\\nThe sides were good, again a surprise as I don't really like \\"stew\\" anything but the split pea was pretty good. I even liked the injera this time around as opposed to my very first try of this unique \\"bread\\". The sourness and sponginess of it complemented the dishes quite nicely.\\n\\nThey also have a dessert menu which mainly consists of cakes so we passed on that. \\n\\nOverall: great service, unique experience as you get to eat with your hands and be messy (probably not the best first date idea LOL), full bar, patio, plenty of parking. \\nDefinitely a must try when feeling adventurous."},{"name":"Schmidt's Sausage Haus","address":"240 E Kossuth St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Food was great our server Jasamine was excellent.

There really isn't much competition on campus for that sort of restaurant besides the Gallery and Sage. Its affordable, and if you make reservations, you can get pretty good service at busy hours. During this trip, I went with a group of 14, and we were served in a fair amount of time. \\n\\nI ordered the Thai Tofu Bowl ($16), which came with some shredded carrot, bean sprout, cabbage, cucumber, mango, peanuts, and fried tofu topped on rice. The portion size was filling but I wish I received a bit more fried tofu, since it probably was the most tasty part of the menu. Out of the many times I have been to this spot, this order was probably the best tasting I have received. There was a good amount of sauce, a nice variety of vegetables, and the dish was filling. Some complaints about the dish could include the carrots seeming a bit dry, and the cucumbers cut into a bit too large of slices. \\n\\nI don't enjoy most of the sandwiches or fries that they serve at this restaurant, but this special bowl impressed me. Compared to the average sit-down burger joint, this place doesn't really stand out, but it's the best we got on campus.

I was even considering taking one to go. However, like I said, they change their cheesecakes all of the time, so #1 cheesecake status is not guaranteed. They've also had a Nanaimo cheesecake that was unreal. Their unbaked cheesecakes are usually not as good, though.\\n\\nHowever, except for the last time I was at the Point (I've been here ~ 6 times) their food has always been just okay. Not that flavourful. And also quite expensive. They get you because there are only a couple of restaurants at UBC so there is sort of no choice. BUT, they recently changed their menu and I really really liked the burger I got (The Suarez) so it's possible they did an overhaul and all of their food has gotten better... but it may be unlikely.After I move off campus it's likely I'll never come back... except for the cheesecake.

They ended up forgetting three of our tacos so clearly they were also getting confused in the kitchen about which ones they had brought out. When we reminded our waitress, she was able to promptly bring out the tacos we were missing, and when she brought us our checks, she said her manager took my order off because a few were late. That was very nice, but also didn't make sense since only one of my tacos was late and two other peoples' were. \\n\\nIn terms of the food, the roasted duck taco was AMAZING. I wish I ordered all of that kind versus one of that kind and a few others. However, the portion sizes are tiny. The prices are $2.50 for a normal taco and $3.50 for a special taco, which doesn't sound that bad, but it adds up. Our table got three guacamoles (we had about 12 people in all) but it was a pretty pitiful \\"large\\" guacamole for $9. I also got 3 tacos but left still feeling hungry. \\n\\nI feel like this restaurant has so much going for it with a great atmosphere and tasty food. I think an overhaul of their ordering system could really help them. It seems super weird for a restaurant to have people order individually on a slip of paper and then choose to bring their food out all mixed up. The high prices for small portions and chaos of ordering makes me not want to go back despite enjoying my food and the atmosphere there."},{"name":"Wilfs Restaurant & Bar","address":"800 NW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I came here for a networking event; sort of an odd setting (in Union Station) for a restaurant but it has a sort of speakeasy feel to it.

After being seated I noticed the tables, chairs, floors and walls were beat up and in poor condition.  Our wooden booth seats were sticky and just seemed over-used.  They could really use remodeling and a make-over.  At this point I was really worried that if the outside, inside and furniture was sub-par then the food might be just as disappointing.\\n\\nHowever I must say, the food selection and quality was good.  Not to say it was fantastic, but it was definitely better than some of the other buffet-style places I've been to.  While nothing was great, nothing was terrible either.  It's not common to be able to eat Chinese, Japanese and Korean in once place and for one price.  The Fried Rice and Noodles from the Chinese section was surprisingly good.  The Sushi was a bit disappointing as the outside rice of the rolls were getting hard, which means it's wasn't fresh (dangerous for Sushi).   As for the Korean section, it was just ok but specifically disappointed in the Short ribs, Bulgogi and Kimchi as these are my favorite selections when we eat Korean BBQ.  \\nThe desert selection was decent but not having ANYTHING chocolate ruined it for me.  I settled for some Jello and Ice Cream. \\n\\nOverall, while not impressed with the experience, I also wasn't angry.  I didn't expect anything great from a buffet, so that kind of saved the meal.  Considering not even saving money from the Groupon made this a better experience, paying over $30 in total for 3 of us doesn't seem like much of a \\"deal\\" (We didn't even order drinks!).

My first thought was not to go to Farm Burger - after the flood that is the crowd 7 days earlier, I was not in the mood to get packed again. I have heard about this Flip thing through Yelp, so after a couple of hours at the coffee shop, I drove over.\\n\\nParking was not an issue, although apparently it was an issue enough that there are other park arrangements nearby. Getting out the hard, I found the place crowded. Bad sign (for me, at least). Fortunately, there were spots on the bar, so I was about to get a seat immediately.\\n\\nGazing through the menu, I studied each one carefully, until I got the A5. . .\\n\\n\\"Flip, 6.50, Philly, 7.5, A5, 39-what\\"\\n\\nYes, there is a 39 dollar burger on the menu. Wow.\\n\\nThe impulsive part of me really wanted to get that, but common sense (as well as recent experience of paying an exorbitant  amount of money to the gubment) got the better. So I ordered the bacon & cheese (because who doesn't love bacon) as well as vodka battered onion rings (because while I don't drink, I don't mind getting close to the edge every now and then).\\n\\nThe food came quickly (at least by the standards of Farm Burger). I was happy until it was set down on my plate. For a moment there, I thought I had one of those sliders, but no, it is an actual burger, with an equally smaller portion of onion rings. In fact, it was the smallest burger I ever recall eating at any place. It seems to be even smaller than your 99 cents burger at a certain burger chain by a crazed clown.\\n\\nNow, lets get this out of the way: the burger is good. I got good service, I like the look of the place. I can't argue with that.\\n\\nBut the burger, at the price I paid is. Too. Frickin. Small. \\n\\nI felt cheated.\\n\\nIt is entirely possible that is the whole point, though. The place is likely either for people to clump together to engage in loud, riotous conversation (They have too - the music is not exactly set to half-eleven), while occasionally nibbled on an over-sized slider or foodie fans of Richard Blais (who, incidentally, I have heard of, but never made the connection until today) - Solitary people-phobic programmers seeking comfort of a large American classic need not apply.\\n\\nPerhaps if I ever decided to be social in the future, this could be a good place to stop by.

Two of us split the beef rib and after removing all the fat, we both were only able to make two tacos each. If we're paying $60 for the plate, it would be great to get more than 4 tacos (aka $15 per taco!?). My dad was very excited about the pork chop, which left him really disappointed when half of it was fat and the rest was covered in a thick sauce. A good pork chop shouldn't be drenched in sauce.

The place is in an unimpressive strip mall, but once inside it has that 5 star restaurant feel and thoroughly impressed us.\\n\\nFor starters, we brought a bottle of martinelli's apple cider ( - brain tumor patients can't have alcohol) and they didn't skip a beat before bringing out champagne glasses and pouring them for us to toast to our special day. They still were running their summer menu and what we ordered is below:\\n\\nSIDE NOTE* my entire family is Italian, from Italy, and we were all happy with the authentic food, and every single plate was completely eaten down to the curmbs. \\n\\nAPPETIZERS\\n- calamari fritti: was perfectly lightly fried and the sauce is to die for!\\n \\n- Insalata di Pompelmo: I love a salad with strawberries in it, and this did not disappoint. The perfect amount of feta, the perfect amount of grapefruit olive oil, and a blend of deliciousness made me all happy inside.\\n\\n-I think its required to note the complimentary bread basket (1 complimentary, $5 refill) was absolutely perfect warm goodness. It is not your typical store bought or table bread, its really hard to describe. Had spices and things baked into it.\\n\\nDINNER\\n- Penne ai Gamberi e Caffe (pictured!): This seafood penne pasta has that white wine sauce goodness people dream of. The coffee grounds on top was a delightful touch.\\n\\n- Ravioli ai Funghi e Bietola (pictured!): OMG this was mine and I wanted to lick my plate. They come out straight up pink, which kind of threw me off. But the first bite had a heap of the light yellow sauce (orange brandy sauce) on it, and I seriously was going to die in heaven. I will pay a kidney for that ravioli sauce...!! please send help.\\n\\n- Linguine al Nero di Seppia (pictured!): Didn't hear any accolades on this one. But it was the first meal completely consumed... it was silent most likely because my husband was busy stuffing his face until gone haha.\\n\\n- Linguine Luci Johnson (pictured!): So apparently LBJ's daughter use to come to andiamos, and ask for this to be specially made. So much so that they finally put it on the menu! It's the one item on the menu that doesn't change, and according to my mother in law it did NOT disappoint. \\n\\nDESSERTS\\n*we were so thrilled that they brought us out a complimentary half tiramisu for the anniversary celebration!* \\n\\n- Tiramisu: rivals my mother in laws homemade sicilian style tiramisu and the 1.5 serving was devoured.\\n\\n- Millefoglie: ok so my family is a death-by-chocolate type of family, but this was clearly the winner of the night. It means a million layers (of pastry) and was topped with a deep purple blueberry custard. It was a phenomenal blend of sweet and tangy that pretty much blew us away. \\n\\n- Triple Chocolate Mousse: A classic, and good. I would however recommend the first two desserts we tried before every recommending the mousse to someone.\\n\\nWINE\\nWe ordered a bottle to share with those who could drink alcohol, and I had happened to be looking at a win that was served by the glass and by the bottle. The waiter was nice enough to bring me out a taste of an open bottle before decisions were made, and we ended up with a northern italian medium red blend. \\n\\n\\nSeriously Andiamo, thank you for an amazing dinner on one of our most special nights.

However, the egg rolls are an appetizer that I did not get to appetize bc they came out with the meal. My tea had like TWO pieces of ice in it, so I asked Shawnte for more ice. She took my glass and never brought it back. When I finally flagged her down and asked, she looked at me and the table almost bewildered and said, \\"I didn't bring your tea back?\\" Ma'am...I'm not hiding a glass of sweet tea under the table. WTHeck?!? So, she brings it back with FOUR pieces of ice. I look and told her I needed more ice. She asked if it was too sweet, to which I replied \\"no, it's too hot.\\" I finally got my cold glass of sweet tea. \\n\\nThen, there was an issue with the register and she said there was only one working, but it took entirely too long to close out even with one register so I'm leaning towards it being a user error. I know we waited at least 25 minutes to get our tickets closed. \\n\\nWith all that said, the red rice was decent, probably better if hot. The wings were cool...nothing to rave about. The egg rolls were also decent. I tasted my friends pork chop and that was the best thing going! So flavorful and tender. I also tasted the crab fried rice--just seemed like seasoned rice with minimal crab but it had good flavor. \\n\\nI don't think I'll make the drive back out from my house, but maybe if I'm leaving the airport I'll stop in. The table next to us really enjoyed their food, and I definitely attribute my experience to the server, which is certainly unfortunate."},{"name":"Desta Ethiopian Kitchen","address":"3086 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Was on point.

Something I had never experienced. But I ate as much as I could stomach and just hung out drinking with the fam was having a good time until out of nowhere an unexpected bug crawled on me from under the chair. Right there on my shirt crawling toward my face was a roach about 1.5-2 inches in length. We jumped up from the table and paid the bill standing and refusing to sit down. ($300 tab). After paying we decided to go to the manager to tell him what occurred. A gentleman approached us and after explaining to him the situation about the roach his response was \\"I have never heard of a complaint like this before\\" he then apologized almost as if we had been lying about the incident. Mind you we had already paid we weren't asking for anything in return and he made us feel as if we were just making the whole thing up.

It didn't take long to get, and all in all, the shake was fine.  It would've been much better had it been a lot colder and thick, but it was slightly lukewarm and more liquid-y.  It's a shame since the pretzel pieces were salty and good, especially with the Nutella flavor.  It has potential, but the texture and temperature just threw me off.

FLIP burger is a place that in many ways became known as a departure from tradition at its time, being one of the first inventive burger joints in the southeast that could warrant pricing a burger costing over $10 back in the day. It was in many ways revolutionary. Receptions ranged from shock to amazement to acceptance. As the concept expanded and many challengers elaborated upon it, the originality of idea that FLIP burger introduced to the local market can not be understated.\\n\\nToday, it is somewhat of a confusing place to be. There is My Chemical Romance and Hoobastank blasting on the stereo. There are flat screen TVs in picture frames. There is a prevailing sense that time has stopped. The burgers of course, are as delicious as always. Oaxaca is flavorful. Fish burger is excellent. People are kind and helpful, in particular the gentlemen at the bar.\\n\\nNot only does it feel a bit confusing, but the restaurant itself is in a confusing situation. Having to close down other struggling locations, the original is all that is left. The new owners who bought the concept rights planned a rapid expansion about a year ago, yet it has not happened. What will happen to FLIP burger? Will it become a national sensation of high end burgers along the likes of Shake Shack as the new owners intended, will it remain in a single location of warped time as it is today or will it fade into the history of local burgers along with the music that is still played here?"},{"name":"Burnside Brewing","address":"701 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This place was not our intended dinner location the night of Elton John this past Saturday but I'm so glad we stopped in.\\n\\n3/4 of us enjoyed the amazingly large and tasty burger but I decided to go with their veggie melt. \\n\\nThis was made with a plant based protein that truly looked like pulled pork.

We arrived on time, but waited an additional half an hour for a table to clear up. They also told us as we were waiting that they were out of crabs, but Annie was quick to respond that we had reserved one so there shouldn't be any issues. When we finally got seated, they told out the largest they had was an 11lb-er. Disappointed but hungry, we went with the only option we had, but ordered a few extra dishes for cushioning: pea shoots with garlic, 7-spice deep fried tofu, spare ribs, and roast chicken with shrimp crackers. \\n\\nThe first round of crab was fantastic. The legs came out steamed with mounds of garlic on top, and Jennifer even commented that the crab was merely an accent for the garlic. It was that good. After the crab was all done, they took the remaining wine and garlic sauce and mixed it into an e-fu noodle dish which was like a encore at half the size (barely half a bowl per person). The second crab dish was a bit harder to eat, and not as tasty as places that deep fry it with chilies. After that, the rest of our dishes arrived, and they were all tasty.

They're relatively simple dishes, but were still delicious, were served in generous portions, and did not dehydrate me with excessive saltiness or clog my arteries with excessive oiliness. Service was also quick, and the establishment had surprisingly good ventilation, given that little Chinese joints like this usually make you smell like the kitchen after spending as little as 10 minutes in the restaurant.\\n\\nAs I made my way to the cashier to pay, I contemplated whether or not I would rate this place four or five stars. Upon presenting my credit card to pay for my $24.11 meal, I was told that they only accept cash or debit card as payment. No surprise there; most little joints like this haven't yet figured out that offering customers the option to pay by credit card would increase sales much more than enough to cover the fees associated with credit card machines. Whatever, I had cash anyway - exactly $25. They'd have to settle for an $0.89 tip.\\n\\nI handed the owner the $20 and $5 bills, thanked him, and turned to leave when he asked if everything was OK. I said that it was. He asked, \\"No tip?\\" I asked, \\"You are ASKING me for a tip?!\\" He replied by mumbling something along the lines of \\"Oh, never mind, you don't give...mumble... mumble...mumble\\".\\n\\nI fished about my pockets and managed to find a toonie, which I placed on the money tray and then said, \\"A customer chooses if he wants to tip, and how much he wants to tip. You don't ASK for a tip.\\" The owner replied by saying he understood. I said, \\"By the way, it was delicious\\", to which the owner sarcastically replied with thanks.\\n\\nI'm not going to make this review about tipping culture or the proper mannerisms around tipping. One thing, however, is for sure: a service provider should not be questioning a customer's choice around tipping, especially when he chooses to limit the customer's payment methods.\\n\\nIf we get back to what this is really about - food, service, and value - then this place definitely deserves for four stars. Antiquated business practices around payment methods and questionable mannerisms take it down a notch. What a shame."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The best bbq I have had hands down!!

We're about 35 mins away from home. We ask how long it takes for delivery and she tells us 45 mins. We say great, we won't be home for about 35.

We get home and he vents about how the girl was just messing with him cause he was on the way home and wanted him to get stuck. That he already called and reamed her out.

One plain well done and one with mushrooms and peppers. What did we find? One pepperoni well done and one mushroom. Where in the heck did they get pepperoni?!?! Oh and to make it worse we look at the pre printed order labels they put on the boxes and those said something different then that! So not only did she enter our order wrong but the person putting the pizzas in the boxes got that wrong too!\\n\\nSo we call up and they say sorry, we can't fix ur order but we will give u credit for one pie. Seriously?!?! It's not 945 at night. Most places are closed and it wasn't our mistake. Finally spoke to a manager who apologized and sent someone out with a new pizza. \\n\\nHalf hour later they arrive with a cheese pizza. They hand it over and almost an entire quarter of the box looks wet. I take the box and something drips on my shirt. That's when I notice it's grease. What?! So I rush the box to the sick cause it's dripping that badly and hear the driver drive off. I open the box to  find what looks like someone poured a quart of vegetable oil in the box!!!! It's not coming from the pizza. It's like they dropped the corner of the box in a fryer vat and decided to deliver it anyway. \\n\\nSo here we are, for $30, with one wrong pizza with burnt edges that we decided to just eat anyway, another covered in meat (which we don't eat), and a replacement pie smothered and dripping in a mystery liquid?!

This location has ample free parking, and spacious indoor and outdoor seating options.  The meat is cooked onsite in the Pit house.  You can ask for a Pit Tour to view the \\"TB-BBQ-ies\\".  If you come in the evening, be prepared to see a list on the door of what they still have in stock.  They do run out of meat options here.  First you will wait in line.  There are clear instructions written on the board above of how to get your food.  First, grab a tray and plate and choose some sides if you want.  The green beans were actually my favorite.  The potato salad, and coleslaw were OK, but nothing spectacular (a bit too creamy for my taste).  They also have some dessert options for sides as well.  Next, select a drink.  They have a couple of beer options, cider, or bottles of wine.  Last but not least comes the meat.  Sitting on a board ready to be carved.  I asked the friendly carver what they do best and he said, \\"brisket and pork ribs\\".  So I tried a little bit of each.  Then you pay for your food and you grab your pickles and condiments in the corner.  The brisket was tasty and moist.  In the land of amazing brisket it definitely was good, but wasn't phenomenal.  The pork ribs though were another story.  They were tangy, moist, full of flavor, and the meat slid off the bone. Some of the better pork ribs I have had in Austin.  I completely forgot about BBQ sauce.  I saw the bottles as I was leaving.  In my mind good BBQ doesn't need sauce, so not using it, usually is a good thing for me."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"best place in Austin for a luxury burger!!

Now, when I order a latte, I order it because I want to taste the quality of the espresso first, and then the milk. The one good thing about the latte was that it wasn't overly sweet so I'll give it one point for that. \\nOther than the mildly disappointing drink, the environment was very comfy and quiet.

I don't like Citrus drinks so this was the only thing on the menu that didn't have anything citrus in it.

I ordered the Filet with lobster tail, cream of spinach, and cheese cake for dessert. The cream of spinach seems to be watered down with no thickness and taste was bland.  The cheese cake is average.  I ordered the Filet's temperature as medium.  Unfortunately, one third was well done (end), middle was medium well, and the other end medium.  The filet is relatively small so I was surprise that there was three different temperature.  I showed the steak to the manager and waitress, both agreed of my assessment and got me another filet.  The second attempt, half was medium rare, and the other was medium.  I showed the waitress, and she offered to get me a new one.  I said no because my guest had already finish their main dish.  How can the cook mess up a tiny little steak?  The lobster was over cook (rubbery).  I didn't tell the waitress because she is trying very hard to give good service during this steak fiasco.

I have never heard of a waitress removing items from an order without asking the person who ordered it. Also the portions on each plate were extremely small.

The ambiance of the restaurant was not quite what I was expecting.  Ii is located basically in an HEB shopping center and has a fairly westernized feel like a Phonatic.  It happened to still be happy hour when we came so we tried the tuna and rocky shrimp appetizer.  The Rocky shrimp tasted very similar to a honey walnut shrimp that you might find at a chinese restaurant.  The tuna was more like a sushi item and was delicious.  I would order the tuna again.  The shrimp was good, but I probably wouldn't order it again only because I could feel the fat calories adding up with the fried shrimp and creamy sauce it is smothered in.\\nNow on to the real reason we came, the noodles.  We ordered a red braised beef noodle soup with spaghetti noodles and a stir fry noodle with beef and fettuccine noodles.  For me out of the 2, the highlight was definitely the soup.  The broth had a unique flavor of I'm guessing anise with allspice as it had a cinnamon and black licorice taste.  I've never tasted a broth quite like it and I found myself really enjoying it.  The beef in the soup was a bit on the fatty side, but otherwise, no complaints.  The stir fry noodles reminded me of a beef chow fun.  There was a generous amount of beef and egg which I was very pleased with.  The noodles were as advertised in both dishes for that matter.  I tried some black vinegar and lots of chili oil on the stir fry noodles to give it a little more flavor.  In the future I would probably go with the soups over the dry noodle dishes, but that is personal preference.  I'll definitely be back and if you want a change from Pho I would definitely check this place out.  The prices are comparable to Pho and the flavor is definitely much different, so it is a great change of pace."},{"name":"Ikenohana","address":"14308 SW Allen Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Tucked away in a tiny strip mall is this lovely place.

I called a few days in advance to make a reservation, as this place is always packed when I've gone by in the evenings...that was a good call! The fellow I spoke with answered in French, then switched to English, and was very pleasant and friendly. I asked for an 8pm seat, and if a window table was possible, and he said that there was nothing. Not surprising as that's prime dining time. There was one table for 2 left in the middle aisle for 8,  I expressed that I didn't want that one, because of its location. Normally I wouldn't care, but this was a birthday and I wanted it to be nice, without being in the middle of servers rushing past us every 5 minutes with orders. He then said that there was a  banquette table which was very close to the window, but at 8:30pm. Sold! We did have plans for an event later on in the evening, and we kind of needed to be there before 10 as my fella was helping with it, but it was going to be fine if he was a bit late. For a better table, it was worth it. I was a happy camper.\\n\\nHere's the hitch:\\nWe show up at 8:30, and what do I see while we're waiting for the hostess to come seat us? One table for 2 left, precisely where I didn't want to be! The table that should have been ours was full, and clearly they weren't going anywhere any time soon. I thought perhaps there was another table for 2 else where that I couldn't see, but nope, couldn't see one. We were waiting for more than a few minutes so it gave me a chance to really get annoyed. The hostess came and I gave her our name, and yep, she turns around to seat us at the very table I specifically said I hadn't wanted. I told her that I had specifically requested an 8:30 time BECAUSE I specifically didn't want this table. She said that unfortunately, there were no notes that had been made regarding this, and  they were fully booked, and the only other option was for us to sit at the bar. Um. NO. Not an option. I was extremely annoyed now. What's the point of making a reservation, asking for a specific type of table, (or close to it), it no one's going to actually do it?! I told her when it was that I called and described the fellow I had spoken with, She said she knew exactly who I was speaking of, and while she apologized, she seemed annoyed at the situation, but not all that sincere in her apology. Perhaps because this has happened before, or it was a bad night. Don't know, but it didn't help the situation.\\n\\nWe chose to stay as we didn't have a whole lot of other options. We were dressed to the nines, and ready for a great evening. I didn't want to ruin the night by being a  pissy pants so, I figured, let's move on, and hope the food was decent. Within minutes of us sitting down, a server came by holding 2 glasses of  sparkling ros√©, which was exactly what I was going to order! Turns out it was the fellow who messed up my reservation; he apologized profusely, and said the wine was on the house for his error. Well, that made a world of difference! \\n\\nFrom that point things went very well.  My boyfriend ordered escargot for  an appetizer, and the lamb for a main and the nut crusted chocolate silk cake for desert .  I ordered beef tenderloin and had a 3rd glass of sparkling wine for desert, but did try the cake and it was lovely. We both agreed that everything we had was excellent, and personally, I can't recall having a tenderloin that has been done better than the one I had here. That includes any steakhouse restaurants I've been to. Truly superb. \\n\\nAll in all, an experience that could have gone from bad to worse went from unimpressive to excellent, and this place redeemed themselves by giving us an apology AND complimentary drinks to back it up, as well as the fantastic  food and service through out the evening. I don't know whether we got extra attention, because clearly, I was initially not happy, but I somehow don't think so. Guess we'll see the next time we go. I could have gone into more detail about the food, and next time we go, I will, but I feel that telling about a situation like this that occurred, and how a business fixed it, is also important.\\n\\nThanks Les Faux, we'll be back for sure!"},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Love the options they have for vegan donuts.

I didn't think she would like this, and I was positive as soon as I pulled up out front.

I went this past Wednesday around 3 and there was plenty of parking in the front. Upon entrance it smelled of dirty carpet which almost made me turn around but once you reach the main door it wasn't as bad. I was going to dine in but it just didn't seem to clean to me (I know I know, why didn't I just leave). Again I left the foodie in me win so I went to the to-order station and ordered! There was a STACK of signed receipt papers left unattended. Being in banking I was furious because all I could think about was more fraud claims I'll have to deal with because of carelessness like this! COME ON PEOPLE!!! I gathered them and turn them upside down and placed them behind the counter for them! That's apparently when I got some attention from the staff. I was advised that the firecracker roll was a fan favorite and had a bit of a kick so I ordered that and the salmon and octopus nigiri.

The 1 and a half pound lobster ($44) came with an undressed corn on the cob ear, which paired perfectly with the butter sauce that was leftover from the lobster.  The meat was sweet, and cooked perfectly and if you are as determined as I am you will find there is plenty of meat to be found.  I even shared and was still full.

Those knowing about tuna, soft fatty pieces are healthy and full Omega 3's.  This must have been the worst cut of Tuna they could find.  The sesame crust does much to take away from the flavor from the tuna, and the wasabi aioli, and sweet chili slaw are independently good, but does not match the tuna.\\n\\nPork Pot Stickers were overly fried, and oil not drained.  The pork meat is overcooked and shriveled.  No decent Asian eatery would serve pot stickers like this.  The Lime-Soy dipping sauce was nice.  The steamed version is better, but also overcooked, and so not worth the price, even considering it's on Disney property.\\n\\nLettuce Cups for Two is a refreshing start to a meal, but can get messy to eat, where in is the fun.  The tamarind sauce is quite profound and takes away from the freshness of the lettuce.  If they lightly sauced the chicken rather than slathering it, it would compliment the dish just fine.\\n\\nDim Sum Basket for Two is a, \\"blah,\\" dish.  The Shrimp Sui Mai is mediocre.  The Cha Su Bao is too sweet and skips on much of the pork filler.  The Pork Sie Mai is not much to talk about.  Going to a Dim Sum joint where other Asians attend would blow this dish out of the sky.\\n\\nFrom the Soup/Salad menu, I've had the: Wonton Soup, House Salad, Mandarin Chicken Salad, and the Ahi Tuna Salad.\\n\\nThe Wonton Soup is salter than most other versions of it, but does replenish the salts one would lose from walking and sweating in the parks.  The Wonton wraps in the soup can be under done if you have it right when the restaurant opens for the day, but is fine the rest of the day.\\n\\nThe House Salad is nice, but the sesame seeds and sesame dressing are very strong in flavor so go easy on it.\\n\\nThe Mandarin Chicken Salad is very strong in the orange rind taste.  It is also very salty and sweet at the same time.  It's not to my liking.\\n\\nThe Ahi Tuna Salad is blacked and has a charred flavor.  It is very much in opposition to the taste of freshness.  It tastes similar to the experience of the Kali River Rapids where the forest is on fire.  The wonton chips is an American creation, and not authentic to traditional Asian fare, and is for the tourist rather than for the Asian palate.\\n\\nOn the Grilled menu, I've tasted the:  Baby Back Ribs, Shaoxing Steak and Shrimp, Maple Tamarind Chicken, and Kobe Beef Burger.\\n\\nThe Baby Back Ribs are sweet and tangy.  It is very saucy.  The rib meat itself was dry and stringy which happens when cooked too fast at a high temperature.  You will not taste the meat since the sauce is caked so thickly, which may be a blessing in disguise.\\n\\nShaoxing Steak and Shrimp was good.  The steak was fresh and served on a searing iron grille plate.  It is an experience for all your senses as is still sizzles on your plate.  The shrimp was cooked well and tasty as the tempura was also freshly made.  The Jasmine rice is light and fluffy.  The stir fried veggies was full of oil, and I would rather have this side steamed to match this dish.\\n\\nEating the Maple Tamarind Chicken, the breast meat is tender, but a tad bit on the dry side to the taste.  The Tamarind sauce is the same horrendous sauce that ruins, yet identifies this restaurant.  The Coconut Ginger Rice needs more coconut flavor, which can be remedied if they toast the coconut flakes first before adding it to the rice... which they probably do not.  The Baby Bok Choy was nearly raw on my plate but still covered in oil. \\n\\nThe Kobe Beef Burger was juicy, and left in it's natural form and spritzed lightly with the sauce sauce.  It's good for the beef enthusiast that wants to taste the burger for it's own tastes... just ask that the mayo and other side be put on the side of the plate first.\\n\\nFrom the Specialties menu, I've had: Seared Miso Salmon, and Duck with Anandapur Glaze.\\n\\nThe Seared Miso Salmon was so light with the miso, I could not tell if they used sweet white or salty red miso.  It was a thick cut of fish, and a seared miso would adhere better on a thin piece of fish.  The sides are very oily.\\n\\nThe Duck with Anandapur Glaze taste similar to Duck O'range french style.  There is a hint of wasabi bite if you wait for the aftertaste.  It's an individual portion, so it's a small duck, not something typical for a family sharing.  It tastes fine, but I'd rather have the duck at Les Chefs de France, in Epcot.\\n\\nFor Desserts, I've had:  Fried Wontons, and New York Cheese Cake.\\n\\nThe Fried Wontons come out piping hot, and is best consumed when hot.  The filling is very creamy and delicious.  Take small bites, or you may cut up your gums on the very crunchy fried wonton wraps.  Wish they provided more on the honey vanilla drizzle sauce.\\n\\nThe New York Cheese cake is just what it is."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Medina Cafe is cute and the staff was super amazing but the food left a lot to be desired.

We go to France every other year so this restaurant is nothing like good (there are bad ones, but not often) French bistros in terms of food quality.  The steak and squid were on par with bistros in France; however the duck confit, which should be one of their staple dishes, was terrible.  The meat was hard where it had to be sawed off the bone, the skin was white and not brown and crisp as it should be, the meat was flavourless (if in Paris, try Le Petit Fer a Cheval for the best duck confit!).  My friend said her halibut was good.  The plating for all our portions looked generous due to the amount of salad they put on the side (which was great for those of us on Keto diets!)

She said that she appreciated the feedback because someone had said the same thing the day before about that dish and that she would tell the chef it was not an isolated incident.  I ordered one mini waffle because I was still hungry.  When I got the bill, the waitress said the waffle was on her.  I was a little surprised but paid and left.  As I was walking back to my place, the more I thought about it, the more it bothered me.

If I was in prison and on death row, I would eat fried chicken for my last meal.  Die-hard fan here.  I was excited to try this new place because Austin is lacking a bit in its authentic fried chicken selection.  \\n\\nGus's is located down town, which is a bit frustrating because parking is always a pain.

The prices are reasonable.\\n\\nNow for the food.  None of the sides are remarkable, all just average.  And yes I get it, this place is known for its fried chicken, so on to the main event.  Unlike reviewers stated before, the chicken was not cooked to order.  It takes more than 8 minutes to fry the chicken, and that's the time it took for it to come out.  It wasn't cold but wasn't piping-hot fresh out of the fryer, either.  I thought it could be a bit juicier to be honest.  The breading is modest, and some might prefer that.  I also didn't really like the flavor of the spices in the breading.  Some prefer spicier types of fried chicken, however, I am a purist.  Overall it was okay, not great.

The only word from the sign lit up was \\"Ethiopian.\\" There's a ton of parking to the side and behind the building, though not as much directly in front. \\n\\nWe arrived at 6:45 on a Friday evening and the waiting area was already full. We were told there would be a 35 minute wait for a party of 2, but it only took 20 minutes to be seated. \\n\\nWe sat at a table in the upstairs section of the restaurant. It was very full and the tables were close together. The atmosphere was lively and fun, despite being dimly lit, almost sultry in appearance. The provided hand sanitizer and sinks for guests who choose to eat with their hands (which I would highly recommend as it adds to the experience). \\n\\nI ordered lamb tips with miser (spicy red lentils) and injera. The really great thing about the Desta menu is that it offers a definition for the items that are maybe a little confusing or ones the customer has never encountered before. My friend ordered the fish tips with injera and a side salad. I have to pay a huge compliment to the salad. It was not what you would expect from a side salad, but came with great greens, tomatoes, jalape√±os, etc. They also brought us another basket of injera upon request. \\n\\nThe food was great. As someone who eats a lot of Indian and Bengali food I had expected for it to be hot based on the color and the amount of spices that went into it. The flavor was really smooth and pleasant. It could have been made spicier upon request. My lamb tips had a lot of vegetables and whole herbs, which gave it a more \\"homemade\\" feeling.

Perfect opportunity!  I invited my roommate and daughter to join me and made reservations for last Friday, anticipating a meal that would be out of this world.

Someone asked to take our order and directed us to the end of the counter to wait when I said we had reservations for SFF.  We were seated shortly thereafter on \\"the porch.\\" \\n\\nWe received a warm welcome from Abby, who took our drink order.  I was under the mistaken impression that this would be a buffet style event.  Turns out the entire meal is brought to the table by your server.  Abby returned with our drinks and the starter: hush puppies with Cajun dipping sauce and cornbread muffins and biscuits, all of which were piping hot and delicious.  Next up was the main, consisting of 3 chicken fingers, 2 shepherd's pies, a plate of thinly sliced bacon wrapped meatloaf, carrots, broccoli, mashed potatoes, brown gravy and macaroni and cheese.  It was at this point that the meal took a sharp turn South.  \\n\\nAll of the food was room temperature, except the chicken fingers which were just a tad above lukewarm, overcooked and hard to chew.  I did like the seasoning in the breading and imagine they taste great when served up fresh. \\n\\nThe shepherd's pie contained no meat...just more mashed potatoes and gravy.  \\n\\nThe \\"meatloaf\\" also appeared to be devoid of meat, unless you count the limp bacon it was served with.  I wonder how they slice it so thin?  VERY unappealing to the eye and bland.  \\n\\nEverything else tasted okay...the equivalent of school lunch food, not special in any way.  We didn't order seconds of anything except the cornbread biscuits.  My appetite had vanished because the food wasn't hot. \\n\\nAbby returned to clear the table, brought out desert and offered us coffee, which I accepted.  Banana Pudding and Carrot Cake were split between the 3 of us.  Again, they tasted okay, but nothing special.  My coffee was served stone cold.  I wasn't aware that we could take our uneaten food to go until I saw the table behind us being given large take out boxes for everything.  We we only offered 2 small boxes for the desert.  We decided not to take anything home...pretty disgusted by now. \\n\\nMy daughter and I come from a long line of scratch cooks and take great pride in the food we serve to our family and friends.  The message we got from the kitchen that night was, \\"We don't care.\\"  My daughter wondered out loud, \\"How does John Rivers sleep at night?\\"   I'm left feeling embarrassed for bringing her here.

I suggested we try here.  (Cue Cher's \\"If I Could Turn Back Time\\")\\n\\nIm not an unreasonable person. A popular restaurant on a Friday night; I expected a wait. No problem. I was pleasantly surprised when a friendly male server (who turned out to be the ONLY saving grace about our entire experience) informed us that our wait would be short.  Maybe we should've clarified what \\"short\\" meant to him.  In the meantime he brings us this RIDICULOUSLY, unnecessarily complicated menu/ordering system, a brief explanation of it that was shouted over the loud din of the diners and then left us to wonder if there was going to be an informational video to follow that would further clarify.\\n\\nForty five minutes later he comes by to apologize and say it looks like the table he thought was going to free up for us was ordering dessert. As my party smiled and said okay and goodbye and made our way outside, we realized there was a place to sit and eat outside. We should have just kept going!!! He said he would be happy to serve us out there and offered us some bread and water. Returning with menus he then says oh..the table was paying their bill and getting ready to leave after all. (Merry go round, much?) and said go ahead and order outside and he'd make sure we were seated inside when the table cleared and the food would be right after us. \\n\\nWe were finally seated. Happy in the knowledge that our order had gone in over 10 minutes earlier, we were sure we'd be eating at any moment and we were starving.  Another TWENTY minutes passed and our good mood we had collectively managed to sustain was  quickly turning sour, and FINALLY food arrives.  Now I realize this is a tapas joint. Which is why we ordered mostly large plates.  But apparently just like the waiter had his ideas of what a \\"short\\" wait was, the chef also has his ideas of what a \\"large\\" plate is. $20 for the large lamb plate equated to 3 small slabs of meat on 5 inch bones. $8 for a small serving of vinegar mustard chicken equated to 1 tiny piece of chicken thigh.  Our potato pancakes were charred and so hard in places that I thought my fork would break before the potato did!  As for service...what an unfunny joke! I had a question to ask my server, couldnt find her, so I attempted to catch the attention of another and watched as she looked at me in my EYES and continued walking away.  \\"Yes, that just happened\\" is the response my friend gave me at the look of incredulity on my face.   We couldnt wait to get out of there and end what turned out to be a horrible dining experience.\\n\\nWhen I saw the bill at $80 with nothing to drink but water and not one stomach sated, I felt on the verge of a blood vessel bursting and  stroking out right there across the table. Total robbery. When you are sitting at a table with an $80 bill and thinking about what you're going to order at Wendy's drive through, you know you had a dining FAIL.\\n\\nIf you like throwing your money away, being ignored and having the tiniest portions known to man to boot, then Navarre is for you.

As a fan of savory food myself, I've ordered the #1 (Sausage & Maple) and the Ham & Gouda with added maple butter. \\n\\nThe waffles here are soft, fresh, and nicely soak up any added maple butter in the taco. I highly recommend spending an extra dollar fifty to elevate your dutch taco to the next level with some maple butter! It's the perfect combination of savory-sweet that I like, given that the sweetness of the maple butter doesn't overpower the savory elements in the dutch taco.\\n\\nThough both the #1 and the Ham & Gouda are absolutely delicious, I think my favorite out of the two would have to be the Ham & Gouda. The combination of black forest ham, gouda cheese, and (added) maple butter inside a waffle is simply genius. The #1 is also excellent, though I think that the sausage used at Bagel & Box (which I believe is Flavour Spot's sister cart of some sort?) tastes better than here. Nonetheless, the #1 is super bomb! It's my boyfriend's favorite.\\n\\nFinally, although some reviewers feel that it's pricey here, I think Flavour Spot's prices are super reasonable for the quality and amount of food you get. Although the dutch tacos may not look the biggest, they're really filling and super satisfying. As a Portland transplant, I'm shocked (and blessed!) that so many food carts pump out super noms, high quality food for a decent price-- Flavour Spot is no exception :)"},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place claims it's Donuts for adults..

The next donut i tried was a seasonal flavor.. I think and it had the berry, lemon and some crumbles. I actually really enjoyed the flavor but I couldn't keep eating it because I felt like I was ingesting loads of grease. You could squeeze the donut and get some grease out. I'm thinking the oil temp got a little too low and it allowed the donut to soak up some grease.

Wait times the times I have been there average out to about 20-25 minutes. The most I have ever had to wait is 45 minutes. The line typically keeps moving and you can order a drink in line while you wait. The sides at Terry Black's are amazing. Must try sides include the Mac and cheese, peach cobbler and the creamed corn. They are all delicious. You used to be able to serve your own sides, but recently this changed and now there are people serving sides for you. I don't really like this since I'm used to the old style but I guess I can understand why they're doing it from a health point of view. The barbecue itself is always on point and really tasty. My favorite cut is the brisket followed by the ribs and their sausages.

I am almost tempted not to call this a burger place as it is so different from any other place and their fare is so different from everything else that is called a burger. I have been there several times now and am always delighted with the food. My absolute favorites are the Po-boyger (shrimp burger with bay mayo, tabasco and a slice of tempura fried lemon), the Ossobuco (veal burger), the venison burger, the Philly and the Southern. I also love the sides, especially the tempura fried okra, and the dips namely the sriracha ranch and the flip sauce. My favorite shakes are the Krispy Kreme shake (doughnuts blended into a milkshake - yumminess!), the Orange Creamsicle shake, the Georgia Peaches and Cream shake, and... the winner... ** drum roll ** the PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN CAKE SHAKE!  The pistachio and white truffle shake, the key lime pie shake and the pumpkin pie shake are very refreshing too (mostly seasonal, so they keep coming off and on the menu, depending on what time of year it is). And I wish they'd bring the Knuckle Sandwich (tempura fried lobster with green goddess sauce) back on the menu. \\n\\nSo you can tell from the above that this is not anything like a regular burger joint. And their menu is so extensive (and ever-changing) that all the recommendations above are only a fraction of what they have to offer. I'd recommend multiple visits to try all of the very special burgers, sides and shakes that you will not find anywhere else.  \\n\\nThe burgers are small enough that you don't feel grossly full.  In fact, you can easily eat a couple if you're really hungry.

I was very disappointed that the main dish was not good. Next came the pork intestine. It is overpriced and also a disappointment. It was served on a hot plate, so if you dont eat it quick enough, the bottom gets burnt and hard.  It just had this crunchy texture that pork intestines shouldn't have.

Some reviews made it sound like the dessert (cream puff) was part of the buffet. But it's only half off! (Which they did say \\"special rate\\" in the menu, so it's not anyone's fault but mine).\\n\\nNice little restaurant that is themed, even the waitresses wore German clothing. It made it even more rustic feeling with the brick road of the town, which was really cool. Service was quick and great.\\n\\nNow for the food: \\n\\nThe buffet was $16.99/person (another review said it was cheaper...), which comes with all the sausages. The bahama mama, bahama mama mild, bratwurst, garlic, and a sausage stew. I only liked the bahama mama and then bratwurst. The rest were alright. The meatload was moist, but I thought it was lacking in flavor. The mushroom gravy was very good though.\\n\\nThe other sides I thought were so-so. Red cabbage with apple was still a bit sour for my liking, and it burned going down my throat. That means I didn't like the sauerkraut either. The potatoes were potatoes, so those were expected. The green beans were too soft, I probably didn't get a fresh batch otherwise I love green beans. The mac and cheese was pretty good actually. The make your own salad was great since I piled bacon on it, haha.\\n\\nCream puff: got the vanilla cream puff. This thing was a beast! I thought it was only average too, not the best cream puff I've had. The pastry wasn't flaky, it was chewy and maybe a little bit stale in texture. The cream wasn't amazing either. Tasted very plain vanilla, and it also had this weird metallic flavor...\\n\\ntl;dr the reviews for this place definitely overboasted the place (at least for the buffet). It is really cool coming here to experience it, but I thought the buffet food was less than impressive for the price I paid.

Ehh...I'd go back and try something different at some point, but it's more of those once in a blue moon type meals, that I wouldn't exactly be clamoring to have again and again.  \\n\\nThe burger itself was juicy, the tomatoes ripe, and the donut buns were decent, but I acutally wanted a bit of glazed sweetness from the donut bun.  Even without the meat and filling, you can't really taste any sweetness.  What is the purpose of a donut for a bun if it's purely savory like regular bread.  Oh well.  They were also a bit greasy, which is not really a surprise, but the noticeable grease coating it leaves in your mouth just adds to the shame you already feel for being a double donut bacon burger eating glutton while your coworkers are picking at lean cuisines and farting out quinoa clouds.\\n\\nThe mound of freshly fried homemade chips were a nice touch, but after wolfing down the burger, I didn't really want more fried starch, believe it or not.  Was it wrong that I would much more have preferred a burger like this with some sort of vegetable as a side to balance it out?  Probably so, but the chips were still overkill, a bit bland, and unnecessary, I thought.\\n\\nOverall, it's worth a try to say you've had a donut burger, but the dessert side of gourdough's is definitely the way to go."},{"name":"Desta Ethiopian Kitchen","address":"3086 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"If you dont like this food you just need to cut your whole tongue out and hide in a closet. \\n\\nI'm writing this while eating my left overs from last night (because the portions are just that much!) and the food is still as good as when it first came out.\\n\\nAs a vegetarian I LOVE all the good protein options.

For me, that's one of the draws that has me now mapping out all the Gus's across the country to plan my attack. Note that the spice is concentrated on the skin. Everyone knows the skin is the best part of fried chicken and this only serves to amp up that certainty. (There's another world famous fried chicken place with spices injected into the chicken. I like that option too. Mmm, imagine if the two chains combined forces...)\\n\\nI also got the greens and fried okra. The okra was also perfectly fried and not slimy.

Tacos are difficult to do poorly but the staff at the eat street cafe are ready to rise to the challenge. The server started out by making no attempt to add the classic taco ingredients in proper proportion as she filled the paper thin taco shell to the brim with \\"taco meat\\"  I had to ask her to start over and just put a thin layer of \\"taco meat\\" in the bottom so there would be room for the other stuff.  Preparing food nicely is nowhere to be found, \\"slapping it on a paper plate\\" as quickly and as disinterestedly as possible is their true \\"art form\\" at eat street.  The reasonably fresh looking government cheese, chopped tomatoes and lettuce and salsa managed to get in the shell as she filled them but was mostly spilled into the paper bowl as she gracefully \\"plated\\" the two tacos by spilling a large portion of ingredients out of their shells so the tacos could repose on a bed of their former ingredients.  I bit into the first taco and the shell burst into pieces along with my dream of having a decent meal.  If a bean counter and the lowest bidder from the taco supply company was watching me eat on a hidden camera, they would be high fiveing each other with glee as the taco shell disintegrated on the first bite. Now to the \\"Taco Meat\\" whatever it is is so over spiced or dosed with whatever, it is like eating drain cleaner and instantly causes GERD to flare.  Yes, folks, on a scale of 1 to 10.  Eat street tacos are not only a solid 1, but could be the 1 against all other eating experiences documented here on yelp. tacos = 1, server = 1 paying way more than what two decent tacos from taco bell would cost - multiplies the pain.\\nBTW eat street's burritos... equally bad..."},{"name":"Alqueria Farmhouse Kitchen","address":"247 King Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Just wonderful.

The place is good, but fell a bit short of expectations.  Still a solid burger place, but a few small things kept it from being great.  The long line is a bit deceiving since Hopdoddy controls the amount of people they let in with their ordering and seating setup\\n\\nFood:\\nMushroom burger\\nfries w/ dipping sauce\\n\\nAs other reviewers have said, Hopdoddy goes the extra mile and bakes their own buns and grinds the meat themselves for their patties.  The mushroom burger is topped with a pesto and goat cheese mixture, sauteed mushrooms, basic veg, aioli, and cheese.  This is some quality meat and the texture was nice.  It wasn't overly pressed so it turned into a puck.  The problem was I ordered my burger medium rare, and it came out medium well.  Just barely pink in the center.  The flavor was really good though.\\n\\nThe bun holds up well to the weight of the burger and all the toppings, and it doesn't disintegrate from the the juices.  The mushrooms were pretty forgettable really.  Just wasn't that much of them and the flavor wasn't strong enough compared to the pesto and goat cheese.  The mixture was very nice though and if the mushrooms had been more flavorful, it would've made it great.\\n\\nThe fries were good, but nothing special that you wouldn't get at any other good burger place.  Hopdoddy does have 3 housemade sauces for you to dip them in (chipotle ketchup, BBQ sauce, and honey mustard sauce).  My favorite was the mustard sauce because it wasn't overly sweet like most places and it had a nice mustard kick. \\n\\nService:\\nThe service is great at Hopdoddy and is attentive without being annoying.  The line out the door is deceiving because they only let certain number of people in so that it doesn't overcrowd the dining room.  You let them know at the door how many are in your party and a table is reserved for you. Remember your table number!  It's how they link your order to you.  \\n\\nInterior:\\nThe place looks great.  It has a modern feel with all the fixtures and tables being quality material.  Very hipstery, as other reviewers have mentioned, but that's not always a bad thing.  The space looks a bit upscale and warm"},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We were recommended this place by our Lyft driver when we came in on our first day.

We're used to the strip mall type, but this place was huge! Plenty of seating, well lit, and very clean. The staff was attentive and friendly, and we constantly saw them bustling about cleaning and refilling drinks. \\n\\nNow the thing that really impressed me here was the variety of foods served. There's a whole sushi bar at the front which my partner quite enjoyed, many different types of soup, pickled vegetables, and quite a few Korean options as well. I'd never been to a buffet that had kimchi, bulgogi, and veggie pancakes! \\n\\nHere's what we liked the most:\\nKorean Vegetable Pancakes - these were the favorite of the night. The edges were crispy, the insides were chewy, and chock full of zucchini. Absolutely scrummy!\\nPan-fried Dumplings - the filling was flavorful and the skins were cooked just right, not too tough. The sauce was empty when I went up there, but a bite of kimchi with it was just as good!\\nChow Mein Fun - this looks pretty simple, but I love noodles so I gave it a shot. The rice noodles were so springy and chewy, and the shrimp were nice and plump. It has a mild flavor but isn't bland at all. A nice contrast to some of the saucier options available. \\nSeafood Dynamite - My partner had two of these. It's seafood, veggies, and some kind of red sauce that's been torched in a little foil cup. This was juicy and very flavorful. A surprisingly tasty morsel.\\nKimchi & Pickled Radish - great palette cleansers. Crunchy and fresh. A great compliment to greasy buffet food. \\n\\nTasty, but not amazing:\\nVegetable Eggrolls - I enjoyed one of these. The texture was great, but the filling was a little bland. Definitely needed a dipping sauce.\\nPork Short Ribs - I loved the marinade on these, very flavorful, but the meat itself was a bit dry.\\nKorean Beef Cake - Wonderfully seasoned! A bulgogi-type marinade, but a little thicker. The texture was unexpected. It was like the meat had been ground up and then smooshed back together into these little squares. Not bad at all, but a little odd. \\nSesame Chicken & Orange Shrimp - Americanized Chinese food classics. Just what you expect they'd be like. But when you think Chinese buffet, these are what you think of. \\nChinese 'donuts' - these were a huge nostalgia bomb for me. I remember eating a lot of these as a kid whenever my mother and I would go to China Buffet up on Burnet road. Tasted exactly as I remembered. \\n\\nPass:\\nCrab Legs - my partner was very excited about seeing crab legs offered, but opening them was a challenge, and once opened, there was very little meat inside. There are much better places to eat crab, so definitely skip these. \\nSesame Balls - I love these at Kula and Tapioca House, and I probably should've known better than to eat them here, but I like them so much that I had to try. After one bite I was done. The outside was at room temperature and a bit tough, and the amount of red bean paste inside was about the size of my thumbnail. \\n\\nThe price is about $14 per person before tipping, and considering the options you have, I don't think it's a bad price at all. We left Buffet Palace very satisfied. If you're in Austin and want buffet food, definitely come here.

I called in an order, which they said would be ready in 10 minutes. So I walk in after 15 minutes and tell them I was picking up my order. The guy at the register puts the to-go order shelf with one bag on it. I picked it up and realized it had the sandwich I ordered, but 2 cookies instead of the salad. So I told him there was a mixup, then the girl next to him gave me an attitude, saying clearly thats not what was ordered because here whats in the bag. Then she realizes that the name was not my name when she asked me, and instead of them apologizing for wrongly telling me that order was mine, they said they were working on my order and to go down and wait with the rest of the customers and it was ready after 30 minutes, not the 10 minutes they promised.

The soups looked like trash so I didn't dare and the sushi was terrifying looking with how it was hosed with wasabi. The dumplings had a horrible aftertaste that is still with me as I write this.  The desserts were the worst part almost. From banana pudding that looked and tasted like it was already chewed up to cakes that were so dry you had to eat them with their ice cream.

They have a window where you can order your drinks first while you're still in line, which was great because it was hot outside!  Highly recommend making a game plan on what you are going to order while you're waiting so you don't miss out on anything.  Once you get inside, you start with ordering your sides.  I recommend the corn, potato salad and peach cobbler.  Once you pick up your sides, you wait to be called up to the counter where you can order all the meat you want.  Whatever you do, don't miss out on the beef ribs.  They are huge!  We wanted to try a little bit of everything, so we shared one between the two of us.

Actually wasn't a meal, cause I waited 25 minutes for nothing but a Guinness, which I waited 10 minutes for. As I was waiting, talking with my daughter I looked down and saw a mouse pop out from around the corner, eye me up and down, and then run across the floor and then up my leg! Then Stuart Little ran back to wherever he came from and I sat there in disbelief as the table across from me laughed and I was like \\" yep, time to go \\" I told the server who brought the manager who made me feel like it was maybe my fault? I offered to pay, tipped the server 10 and left. I later called to say how I felt and the manager told me \\" I comped you a Guinness right? And it didn't feel like he cared about what happened, how all my memories of life in that place were perhaps worthless, a nothing, a hard earned buck stolen out of my pocket with a laugh and a wave of the finger. I went back that night and gave the bar 10 and told em \\" for the Guinness I was comped \\" and walked out. I was angry, disappointed and never felt so disrespected from a restaurant. Felt like a bad breakup. So, in closing, maybe you should look for somewhere else to eat.

They are very popular so at peak meal times, expect a line and a wait. Gus's fried chicken is known for their spice, and for great reason! The spice is what gave it extra zing and a more robust flavor. Personally I did not find it overwhelming at all, but I do have high spice tolerance. It's what makes Gus's so unique in terms of flavor. However the actual quality of the chicken itself was not amazing. The meat could have been juicier inside and the outside skin could be more crisp. \\n\\nThe sides are also just standard southern side dishes. It does the job and goes well with the fried chicken.

My friend and I snacked on thin slices of chewy baguette with dabs of (unsalted?) butter while we waited for our drinks. I enjoyed the most ambrosial cocktail that I've ever tasted - the aptly named \\"Irresistible\\". While I'm not much of a drinker, I would have had another in a heartbeat except that I was driving, so plenty of fresh water instead. To start I had the \\"salade de ch√®vre chaud\\" which was lovely -¬†the greens were crisp and fresh, the  crostini were absolutely delicious. I'm not a huge fan of walnuts and I found the pickled beet cubes a bit too sweet for my palette (that's just me) but the dressing was divine. The salad was not overdressed which was a relief - so many restaurants drown their salads which overwhelms the other flavours and ruins the experience, but not here! If LFB offered this salad at a entr√©e-size, it would make a lovely lunch or light supper. For my entr√©e, I had the \\"moules avec pommes frites\\" special which differed from the regular mussels by the addition of tomatoes and leeks in the flavourful, rich broth. The mussels were small but plentiful and perfectly cooked - the broth was delectable, if a bit chunky. The fries were tasty and a bit savoury and came with an aioli that was nice if a bit bland (a touch more garlic would have been perfect). By the end of the meal, I was 'marinating' my fries in the mussel broth, it was so luscious! My friend started with a generous mushroom \\"vol au vent\\"-style appetizer special with puff pastry and a rich, savoury gravy (he wiped the plate clean with the leftover baguette so it was a hit!). My friend's main was the pork chop special which came with asparagus and a white bean m√©lange that looked tasty. My friend enjoyed his meal as well and reported that the pork chop was moist and flavourful. The restaurant was quite loud but with conversation rather than intrusive music (another relief!) and the room became quite warm as the evening progressed. Our server was charming and attentive, our empty dishes were whisked away promptly, our water glasses were always full.

I've traveled around the world to some pretty meat-intensive countries; in South Africa they have their braai, and in Brazil they have their churrascaria... \\n\\nBut here in the U.S. we have BBQ, which can vary a bit depending upon what part of the country you're in (or in who's backyard the Weber or smoker is sitting). You can tell right away if the meat (beef, pork, chicken, sausage, or whatever) has been treated with a little TLC; if it's been cared for and cooked for at least as long as it takes to watch a Yankees-Red Sox battle and throw back a six-pack, then it will be quite literally fall-off-the-bone or who-needs-a-knife-I'll-just-pull-it-apart-with-my-pinky-fingers tender. And of then, of course, you have the sauce, which really regionalizes the BBQ (first time I had a white BBQ sauce was in Charleston - I had my doubts, but wow...). But let's leave the sauce out of it for the moment and focus on the experience - oh, and the side dishes... Did I mention the mac & cheese requirement?\\n\\nBut I digress. This is a review of Terry Black's BBQ, so let's talk about that. I visited the one in Austin, TX, which apparently is not the original (that's supposedly in Lockhart, TX, and has BBQ chicken on its chalk board, which Austin doesn't). It starts with an outdoor smokehouse which, admittedly, I expected to see a whole lot more smoke coming out of; the Hard 8 in Frisco has enough smoke coming out its stacks and wafting across the Sam Rayburn Tollway that you have to turn your fog lights on, but here it just looks like somebody vaping - probably has something to do with the loony lefty politics of Austin and the EPA or some such thing. Anyway, the line stretches around the building for a bit, but it moves along well enough, and you can always strike up a conversation with the stranger in line with you (yes, they are that friendly here in TX, even in Austin). The line conveniently passes by an open window where you can get a cold brew or Blue Frostie while you wait the next 10 minutes or so in line. Hey, they got an extra $6 out of me and the wife - that's good business, and it creates a happy customer who's already been waiting in line. Smart.\\n\\nThe line zig-zags a bit once inside, sending you past the t-shirts and gift counter, as well as a collection of wines that are actually quite good (hey, they had Black Stallion Cab for $60, and trust me that it's a great wine - but I was driving the next three hours up to Dallas so, alas, I abstained). You also go past brewskies and sodas sitting on ice, but don't grab one of those until the line zags past them again and you're ready to pay or they might lose a bit of their chill - you've still got another 6 or 7 minutes in line yet.\\n\\nThe first food you hit are the sides, which you can buy in single-serve portions, pints, or quarts. I was amazed at how many gluttons were getting pint and quart sized sides - don't people understand exactly how much food they're about to ingest? Anyway, the sides we had (we shared three single-serve sized sides, more than enough for us) were mac & cheese, slaw, and cream corn, and each of them was, in a word, fabulous. Grab a cornbread while you pass by the sides (one piece will serve two people easily), and a desert if you like (we tried the banana pudding, which was just okay, not great - the Nilla wafers in the middle layer were soggy).\\n\\nThen we come to the folks carving up the meats. brisket, ribs (beef or pork), sausage, and turkey. We got a couple of burnt tips free of charge - yummmm. The wife ordered a brisket sandwich with red onions and no pickles, I had the brisket and jalapeno cheese sausage. The sandwich was sliced brisket stacked high, and the rest of the meat was weighed and you were charged appropriately by the cashier sitting right there. Insert your card, scribble something vaguely resembling your signature on the touch screen, grab your tray, and find a place to sit - which might take a minute or two, since I'd imagine the place is perpetually full. At your table are three sauces you can use - spicy, original, or sweet. You pick, they're all good.\\n\\nWhere BBQ is concerned, etiquette isn't really a thing. You should grab a plastic fork from one of the stations around the restaurant where you can grab such things, because eating cream corn, slaw, and mac & cheese with your hands doesn't really work. The meat, however - well, just channel your inner caveman and use what the good Lord gave you for utensils. The brisket was top-notch, the sausage was tasty and not overly spicy despite there being jalapenos in it (hell, they put jalapenos in damn near everything here, it being TX and all, so maybe I'm just used to the jalapeno heat by now... I'm waiting for the day when Kroger starts carrying milk with jalapenos... You think I'm kidding?). I'm apparently at my character limit here so..."},{"name":"Delmonico's Italian Steakhouse","address":"167 E Mitchell Hammock Rd","city":"Oviedo","stars":"4","text":"This restaurant is located in Oviedo, FL which is approximately 20 minutes from Downtown Orlando.  I have been to this restaurant a handful of times at their other location on I-Drive.  This location recently opened up and is much more convenient so we ate at this location.  I have always had positive experiences and we had some family in town so it was a special occasion.  We started off ordering the Calamari and the East Utica Greens as appetizers.  Both were cooked to perfection, and the Greens were even more special because it was authentic to what is made where my family is from and tasted just like how my mom cooks it.  For my meal, I ordered the Veal Parmigiana which was large pieces of veal cooked with Italian Breadcrumbs, topped in their homemade sauce over light angel hair pasta (as pictured).  This dish is one of my favorites and has been consistent every time I ordered it.  My grandfather ordered the Pork Chops, which he said were also delicious and my mom and dad ordered the Chicken Marsala and Chicken Sinatra respectfully.  All of the ingredients were fresh which made it taste excellent.  For the food/beverage quality, I would rate a 10/10.  For the food/beverage quantity, I would also rate a 10/10.  Each item we ordered had a large portion size, which led to a few boxes to take to go.  The value for the dollar was a 9/10.  While the average menu price was pretty expensive, there were many affordable items on the menu if you are not looking to spend a lot of money.  Although my meal was priced at $25.99, I believe it was worth every penny.  The service was a 9/10; our server was very knowledgable about the menu and was attentive to us throughout the entire dinner.  She also took it to the next level and recommended several dishes, refilled our drinks without us asking, and overall her personality was outgoing and energetic.  Overall, the decor was very unique and formal.  The atmosphere was elegant, for example, the tables were pre-set with silverware, plates, wine glasses, and menus.  Aside from the main dining room, they had certain little separate dining rooms with an exquisite chandelier and the wall had little silhouettes of famous Italian actors/actresses.  I would rate the decor a 10/10 for those reasons.  This is one factor that I always enjoy observing because it is interesting to see all the decorations, and it feels like an upscale restaurant where you would want to dress nicer than usual.  One thing I really liked in addition to the decor was how friendly the staff (hostesses, servers, and managers) were to us and all of the guests.  The uniforms, though some deemed tacky, I thought were classy and unique to most restaurants.  The hostesses wore all black with black fedoras and fishnet leggings.  One thing I disliked was how close we sat next to another party.  We could hear almost everything they were saying.  One recommendation could be to place large parties in the separate rooms.

Quite moist and delicious.\\n\\nWe went our second time a week after coming here our first time. My friend ordered fatty and lean brisket with a beef rib. I just opted for the fatty and lean brisket this time. I will say that last week's brisket was better, though when we went this time, my friend's was better... why you ask? The brisket cut I got was from a piece that had long been exposed to air and was near the end of the chunk of brisket. That means that as the guy was cutting this slab of meat a few hours ago (we came at like 4 pm, so this piece was probably taken out an hour or so back during the end of lunch hours), most of the juices were gone. Hell, even the fatty brisket was a bit dry. I was somewhat disappointed but I mean at least there was sauce right? My friend on the other hand got some fresh cuts of brisket and his was much better, to the quality it was the week before when we went. Not a fan of this inconsistency but I'm willing to give them a third try sometime anyway.\\n\\nI recommend getting the jalapeno cornbread.

The pecan pie filling in the pecan pie was good, but I wasn't a fan of the cornstarchy crust of the pie. \\n\\nBrisket is $18/lb and beef rib is $18/lb.\\n\\nMy total was about $40 for a pecan pie, jalapeno cornmuffin, 1 lb of lean and 1 lb of fatty brisket.

The menu here is long enough that you could stare at it for hours on end and not feel confident in your order. Most of the dishes have enormous portions, with one notable exceptions, and the desserts are over the top. \\n\\nMy group started with the honey sriracha Brussels sprouts and the nachos. Knowing a few pizookies were coming later, I passed on the nachos. The Brussels sprout were cooked to a nice consistency where there was slight crunch. The flavor was good, but it was much closer to buttery than honey sriracha. \\n\\nFor my entree I had the shrimp quinoa bowl, which was the only dish to come out where i wished the portion was a bit bigger. It ridiculously small, but it was smaller than you'd get at a fast casual bowl place for about 1.5x the price. Unfortunately it also paled in comparison to most fast casual bowl places in terms of flavor. Any bite I had that wasn't covered in the hot sauce I asked for on the side was a disappointment compared to the ones that were. \\n\\nBy far the best part of the meal were the pizookies. For those unfamiliar (including me before this meal) a pizookie is a warm cookie in a small deep dish pizza plate with a scoop or two of ice cream on top. It is as incredible as it sounds and they have upwards of 10 different kinds. If you're with a large group I recommend sharing a few and immediately slipping into a food coma. \\n\\nOverall, nothing too special, but for 3$ pizookies on Tuesday you can't go wrong."},{"name":"Ramen Danbo","address":"1333 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"This is one of the best Ramen places around.

When 2 people got up, Philip said we couldn't sit there- that he had promised the seats to people further up in the line. Philip went to the VERY front of the line to grab 2 people.  We told both he and Katie we preferred the bar. Philip said he would come get us if spots opened up. \\n\\nWe stayed in the line. And after we ordered and sat down at the table (by the bar), we saw that 2 spots had opened up and 2 new people were sitting there with drinks and were ordering food.  So, we were once again denied a spot though he said he would grab us.  \\n\\nHe then brought us our fries one we sat down, and he threw them down on the table while saying in a snarky tone, \\"here\\". \\n\\nWe ended up getting our fries and burgers before a waiter(brian) came to get our drink order.

Not quite warm enough to dine outdoors, but absolutely pleasant enough for a walk outside - or a short road trip. Indirectly, we did the latter.\\n\\nOne of the best things about Schmidt's Sausage Haus is it's setting. German Village is the one of the two first places any visitor to Columbus should go (an Ohio State-Michigan football game being the other). The streets are cobbled with brick, the houses are 2 1/2 story old Bavarian builds, most of the restaurants are staples to Columbus: Max and Ermas, Hosters, Beck Tavern, the High-Beck, and, of course, Schmidt's.\\n\\nI won't bore you with the history, because you'll see it from the moment you enter German Village or Schmidt's iself. You are transported to an imaginary Bavarian place that is simply delightful; a perfect place to spend any sunny afternoon, no matter where you end up stopping for a brew or a bite.\\n\\nAs soon as you enter, you are wrapped in old German style: the honey-oak wall paneling, the 5-globe brass chandeliers, and the high back wooden booths.\\n\\nOur server arrived immediately and we ordered two buffests, a soda, and a water. Even though we served ourselves - she was fantastic: quiet and efficient. The only time she interrupted us was to ask me if I was finished, since I left my fork on my last plate. I nodded and she returned soon after with our check.\\n\\nThe food of their buffet is just about the best I've ever had. It's the appropriate temperature and taste, and they have three varieties of wurst (Bratwurst, Knockwurst, and their specialty, \\"The Bahama Mama\\" cut into bites and served via warmer trays along with cole slaw, three different preparations of cabbage (kraut, salad, and boiled). There is a complete but small salad bar as well as a host of 5-8 more side dishes. The buffet is clean and always well-stocked - even on very very busy Sunday mornings. Best if you stay away on those days if you don't want that hustle-bustle.\\n\\nWhat else can I say? The meal cost us 24+tip. Although the waitress only served us in the traditional buffet-style, she was fantastic. I tipped her $6 on a $24 order - because her service was excellent and I've paid plumbers and internet techs 75-150 dollars for being incompetent.\\n\\nAlways; Tip the waitress on the work they do more than the cost of the bill. tipping someone 1-2 dollars is better than zero - but it's still offensive for the work they do for you. If you're getting hand-fed by someone and treated like a guest in their house - then an extra 2-3 should really be no sweat off your back. Always reward those who work *FOR YOU*.\\n\\nTIP: Make this an excursion.

We love dinner and a show so we jumped at the chance to get a ringside seat on this special occasion.  If we could give more than a 5 star review, we would. It was spectacular. All the staff is extremely well trained in high end service: personable, friendly, knowledgeable, and confident.  The space has a warm and comfy feel and the layout of the restaurant is sensible and well thought out. Each seating area has its own vibe and all seemed very pleasant. Again, we sat at the Chef's Counter and, while we were seated at the end and next to a service station, we never noticed  the server activity nor conversation nor noise from the staff doing their jobs. All activity was kept quiet and no distractions occurred that took us out of our experience. \\n\\nWe had the multi-course tasting menu and could not have been more pleased. Every dish that came our way was attractive and appealing. Every dish was unique and they progressed from light to rich. Flavors, textures, and combinations of each left us wowed.

Unfortunately this was the latter.\\n\\nI found this restaurant through Yelp when my boyfriend and I were looking for a nice place to go out Friday night. We were in the surrounding area and thought \\"Why not?\\".\\n\\nPros: The environment was nice. It was quiet for a Friday night, the decor was typical of what I would expect for an Italian Restaurant, and it was clean. I was really expecting a hidden gem. I also was impressed with their knowledge on wine and the options for pairings.\\n\\nCons: Pretty much everything else.\\n\\nLet me start with the staff.  The service wasn't bad, just average and wasn't engaging at all. Pretty much was \\"Let me know if you need anything\\" and \\"Are you ready to order?\\" That was it. \\n\\nThe menus themselves seemed a little run down. And while the wine list was comprehensive, their selections for actual glasses seemed small. Most options were for the bottles.  My boyfriend tried the house red and I tried the only Pinot Grigio they sold in a glass. Both were not good. They felt branded to be a nice wine, but I would compare them to Barefoot wine.\\n\\nThe server brought out bread that had cheese and spinach in it and you could TOTALLY tell that this was a pre-made, frozen bread bought from a third-party vendor and wasn't fresh at all. Oh also, you get four small slices of bread and you have to pay $5 for a refill. Seriously?\\n\\nThis is the part that just infuriated me though. For our entrees, I ordered Ravioli and my boyfriend ordered the Linguini Lucy Johnson. Let me just say that most plates were $18 - $28. My plate was $18/19 while my boyfriends was $19/20. I was shocked when they brought out my dish.\\n\\n I paid $18 for FOUR raviolis. FOUR. \\n\\nThey weren't even that big. And like the bread, you tasted pre-made, fresh from a frozen bag. There wasn't a lot of filling either to justify the price point. The sauce was okay, and the only other thing was diced tomatoes. My boyfriends Linguini was soaked in oil, the noodles were overcooked, and the veggies didn't look fresh. My boyfriend and I finished our plates and were still starving from how small the portions were. We came out paying $75 (including tip) for two glasses of wine, a SMALL (I can't emphasize the size enough) bowl of linguini and FOUR raviolis. \\n\\nI have no problem with paying a high price and eating small portions - but you better nail the quality of food and the service. This just didn't deliver. I was so disappointed in my meal and to be honest, I am completely shocked that this has such high ratings.\\n\\nSeriously, save yourself the money and go to Olive Garden. You'll pay less and get better food, wine, and service and actually feel satisfied when you leave."},{"name":"Dagabi Cucina","address":"3970 N Broadway St, Ste 101","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"I generally love the opportunity to sample highly rated Spanish food in any town I visit. Dagabi was a tantalizing option, predominantly because it offers paella, a personal favorite.

On the positive side of the equation, plenty of seafood found it's way into this dish and the portion was large enough to satiate any appetite. \\nMy daughter had the seafood stew (Zarzuela de Mariscos), which again yielded a bounty of seafood.

Tom YUCK. \\nThe Pad Thai has a different flavor than it used to and we aren't fond of it. The noodles are smaller as well. We ordered egg rolls and they were literally dripping with oil. As a matter of fact, everything in our bag was soaked with oil and that's not an exaggeration. The Hong Kong chicken is still good, which is why we are even giving them 2 stars.

There are fewer selections here but the big sign on the wall has an accurate message, \\"Quality over Quantity.\\"  The unique flavors of these artisan style donuts are a tasty treat for any occasion. I had an internal battle with myself on whether or not to order every single donut on the display counter but my rational side won.  I knew I would have a ton of leftovers and hand carrying 4 boxes onto an airplane is just ridiculous. Quality was surely reinforced because I continued to eat leftovers for 4 days and they still tasted scrumptious.  \\n\\nThe entire assortment I ordered were all really good and I applaud Blue Star for their distinct flavors.  Among the items I ordered, the standouts were the Pineapple Pistachio Pina Colada and the Blueberry Bourbon Basil.  Just shear amazing donut goodness.

Now the donut police (hmmm...what do 'donut police' officers enjoy on their coffee breaks?) may barge in and criticize Blue Star for their inflated prices (2.50-2.75/pop) and their lack of the Krispy Kreme sugar bombs or old fashioned cake donuts/crullers, but I say if that's as good as a donut can get, this is not the place for you.  As one of their signs say, these are like donuts for grownups so you are paying for something more sophisticated and complex both in presentation, texture, and taste.  Anyone can dump a pile of sugar, chocolate, custard cream, or store-bought jelly into a piece of fried dough and it will by all accounts be tasty, but this is where people who don't ordinarily like donuts can get their donut fix or open-minded donut connoisseurs can go beyond the ordinary and experience the extraordinary.  They use a brioche dough so that the donut is light, slightly chewy, and delicately sweet, allowing their other locally sourced ingredients take center stage with the donut itself functioning as the vehicle.  Whether or not this violates your principles of the perfect donut is a matter of personal preference/philosophy.  Whereas pessimists may see the hole, I choose to be an optimist and see the donut.\\n\\nPerusing the lineup, there were way too many delectable choices ranging from blueberry bourbon basil, passion fruit poppy seed, hard apple cider fritter, meyer lemon and key lime curd filled, creme brulee served with a shot of cointreau (http://www.flickr.com/photos/sturgill/8264697341/), strawberry jalapeno,maple glazed with real bits of bacon,  and if you come at the right hour, a fried chicken donut served with packs of hot sauce(what the what?!)!  \\n\\nIn the end, my friends and I chose the bananas foster donut, the Valrhona chocolate crunch, and the pb&j donut.  Word of caution, these donuts can be messy so unless you're holding them with lots of napkins, a knife and fork may be necessary to keep your hands clean.   The bananas foster donut tastes like everything you would expect of the classic dessert with a rich banana interior and a crisp caramel rum exterior.  The Valrhona chocolate donut has a velvety ganache of one of the finest grades of baking chocolate enveloping a mildly sweet vanilla custard akin to an ethereal Boston creme pie all the while topped by small crunchy chocolate spheres adding a playful note bringing one's taste buds back down to earth reminding them that this is in fact a mere donut.  My personal favorite was the pb&j since it provided a whimsical take on the humble powdered jelly donut with peanut powder serving as the peanut butter component and a luscious blackberry compote made with locally picked berries as the jelly component, resulting in a luxurious pacific northwestern rendition of a classic childhood snack.  \\n\\nWith one or more of these donuts accompanied with a cup of Stumptown coffee, you have the perfect opening to your day, and you can then venture on down to Lardo or Tasty and Alder for act II.  Simpsons creator and Portland native Matt Groening once said \\"Donuts, is there anything they can't do?\\"  Blue Star most certainly affirms his sentiment."},{"name":"Sr. Tequila Mexican Grill","address":"16745 Cagan Crossings Blvd","city":"Clermont","stars":"3.5","text":"Ordered food to go for the family.

Thanks to their error and giving us more tacos, I was full and thought the price to be reasonable. \\n\\nThe tray came with the fish taco (my favorite for the perfect amount of crispiness), rib eye (wonderfully flavorful), and chicken (tender but not very flavorful).\\n\\nA few months later, I came back to find that the pork belly rice bowl is delicious. The bowl was generous with the amount of pork belly. The meat was glazed well and thin enough to appreciate the evenly distributed flavors. I'd say the meat is the star of this bowl and the brown rice, red and yellow bell peppers, and onion were the supporting cast. I thoroughly enjoyed that pork belly more than the single thick one in my taco. I had to squeeze some lime on that baby to give it more flavor. \\n\\nI wouldn't get the pork belly taco again.

We entered and discovered an almost empty room filled with sparsely scattered bare tables of assorted sizes accompanied by a motley collection of chairs. The ambiance, or lack there of, reminded me of college dives from my long past youth. But we were here so we decided to give it a go. We both had the vegetarian sampler: falafel, salad, domades, rice, humus and pita wedges. The salad was pretty standard fare. The falafel was good, served with a yogurt dipping sauce. The domades were acceptable. The humus was good, tasted home made. The pita wedges were soft and fresh. I have seen a number of people complain that the humus was bland. Well that's chickpeas for you. If you want flavored humus then you have to add some thing to it. Here they put a small amount of olive oil on top and a sprinkle of paprika on top. Nothing fancy. Over all, I thought the food was satisfactory. Not outstanding but not bad either.

The duck is tender and delicious - although just a bit salty for my taste, perfect for my boyfriend though- the sauce is nice and buttery and the rice....

The bartenders will also let you come back after leaving (if you've already spent $) to get one last puff in.\\n\\nFood is decent enough for an airport bar, we had the buffalo wings w/fries and were satisfied. The drink range is typical bar, whatever; obviously it's gonna be a little expensive because it's at the airport. (I think we spent $70 including tip on a few drinks and food, but we were on vacation so fine.)\\n\\nMost patrons were just happy to be there and the community vibe was excellent.

I kid you not! I have wandered enough to know this.\\n\\nEven Marukin ramen (which is one of the best ramen shops in Portland ) cannot make this type of broth to compare.\\n\\nI have eaten a lot of ramen in my life in the United States and in Japan and am always hopeful when a new ramen place opens up. Many times I have been disappointed, maybe my standard (ramen in Japan) has set the bar too high. But again I pressed on to search for true Japanese tonkotsu ramen.\\n\\nThe process here is simple:\\n1. Pick your ramen size and toppings \\n2. Pick your broth \\n3. Decide if you want more toppings \\n4. Eat\\n\\nI ended up getting the Ryoma Special with spicy miso broth. The Ryoma special comes with lots of pork chasu, one piece roasted seaweed and a soft boiled egg. The pricing here is very fare! The size is good for what you pay for. ( you can always get a larger size.)\\n\\nThe broth is simmered for hours upon hours and you can taste the labor! The broth is dense and creamy but not fatty. It harbors a immense smokiness that I have looked for in Portland in every ramen shop! It's just like Japan!! I found out it's because it's a mixture of chicken and pork that create this density.\\n\\nThe chasu provided here is bountiful, it's thick cut and super tender! I am so tired of other places giving you a measly deli slice of pork chasu on the ramen.\\n\\nThe soft boiled egg was perfecttt it oozed when I cut into it.

As it stands however, it is a frustrating experience on a good day.\\n\\nToday was an average day, so it went beyond frustrating.\\n\\nWhen we walked in and asked for a table the host asked us if we would be OK with sitting outside because none of the vacant tables inside were cleaned off. It was 90 degrees, so we politely declined and asked to be seated inside. He went off to bus the tables and he and another server began bussing a 4 top... there were only two of us, but we figured maybe he wanted to put us there for some reason.\\n\\nNope.\\n\\nAfter halfway finishing bussing the four top he proceeds to wander around the restaurant, not really seeming to accomplish anything. 10 minutes later we were still waiting, and none of the tables had been fully bussed.\\n\\nAt this point we decided to sit at the bar instead.\\n\\nThe bartender, for his part, tried to be attentive.  However, between him handling to-go orders and making drinks for the rest of the restaurant, and servers yelling at him across the restaurant about a couple of drinks they had put in (or not put in...I don't know, it was all fairly unclear) he was not getting a lot done in a hurry.\\n\\nBut, we ultimately were able to put in an order for a milkshake, yay!\\n\\nAnd then we waited.\\nAnd waited.\\nAnd waited.\\n\\nAbout 20 minutes later a milkshake arrives. It was good, but was it 20 minutes good? Uh...probably not.\\n\\nDuring our wait we put in an order for some burgers. The computer glitched out on the bartender and he had to restart it...not his fault, I get it.\\n\\nBut then a food runner brought us the burger he was in the middle of crafting when the computer glitched. We politely explained \\"this is not our burger\\" as it had lettuce, cheese, and ketchup on it, while the burger we had ordered only was supposed to have cheese and onions. He insisted this was our burger. What do you want me to say guy? \\"Oh, you're right, I totally forgot that I ordered that burger?\\" and just take it? After a few minutes the bartender came over and was able to explain that the burger was not in fact our burger.\\n\\nAnother 10 or so minutes pass until our correct burgers came out. And they were good. Really good. Delicious in fact.\\n\\nBut was it worth sitting for the better part of 45 minutes waiting for them? Was it worth being ignored by the host and being accosted by the burger wielding food runner?\\n\\nI'm not sure.\\n\\nIf they could get a good manager in there I think they could get this sorted out. Train the hosts to do their job well, and if they can't figure it out let them go and find someone who can. Teach your food runners that being rude to guests is not a great way to figure out why they are rejecting the food you're bringing.  Like maybe ask \\"oh, what did you order?\\" and then compare that order to the thing in your hand.\\n\\ntl;dr?

Place was packed so we had to wait about 15 min, which we did not mind. Food was good, however service was below par. After being seated we were not offered water/coffee for maybe 10 min and when our waitress finally came over she rushed out of there pretty fast. Finally placed our order for which we had to wait a long time. Since we were on vacation we did not mind that so much but the table next to us was getting pretty impatient. I ordered the oyster hash and hubby had the cauliflower kale hash. Oyster hash was very good and fresh but I would have liked if it came with eggs or some greens. The kale hash was amazing. You could tell they use fresh, high quality ingredients. The dishes did not come toast or anything else, we ended up ordering that after our meal came. During the whole experience our waitress was pretty inattentive and not very nice at times and the food lacked proper breakfast brunch accompaniments. Overall we were happy we tried this place, but will probably not go back only because there are too many great choices out there, so why settled for a place that does not impress."},{"name":"Bijou Cafe","address":"132 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I rarely tip less than 20% because waiting tables is hard work, and I don't expect a whole lot in the way of decent service.

It would be nice to have a \\"hello\\" or \\"good morning\\" from the hostess and/or my server, maybe even a smile.  My server generally ignored me, and when she dropped off my plate with a mistaken order, it took me a long time to flag someone down to fix the order.   And there was no, \\"sorry for the inconvenience\\" or acknowledgement of the error.  Overall, I just felt like I was the inconvenience to the hostess & server.\\n\\nThat  is all no big deal.  But the food itself was not good.  The tofu scramble was just dried-out overcooked tofu with garlic and parsley.  It tasted weird.  How about some nice sauteed veggies in there?  Maybe an option of a little goat cheese? It's not hard to do a tasty scramble.  The salad was lackluster too.  \\n\\nThe coffee was amazing.... so good.  But it was strange that my waitress only gave me a half cup on my first refill, even though her coffee pot in hand had plenty in it.

The food really is 4.5 stars. I deducted 1/2 star because the beef rib was a little on the salty side. That made it difficult to finish.  We had the brisket which was so tender and juicy. It had just the right amount of seasoning. The pork ribs were also cooked to perfection. I took one bite and left teeth marks on it without having the entire piece of meat fall off the bone.  For sides we had the cream corn and the potato salad. Both were good.  Would we come back? Heck yeah!!!

It's seasoned well to my liking normally which is medium. \\n\\nDoner Kabob: This is a carved lamb and beef dish that includes a side of rice, grilled tomatoe and salad. if you want mashed potatoes/fries you can request for a substitute charge. I always ask for a side of the yogurt dipping sauce to complement the meats. I like this entree, full of flavors just like everything else they have here. \\n\\nCombo Mezes (3) Appetizer: Normally my coworker and I split this and we choose the grape leaves, hummus and eggplant salad.  The stuffed grape leaves are definitely a favorite of mines to get alone. \\n\\nAs much as I love the food here, their service could improve. The waitress/host are always nice, but it's always so slow when you request or order anything. It's best to look at the menu ahead of time and order as soon as you sit down and request the check when you get your food if you are on a time crunch during lunch. I don't understand why the service is slow when  they are not busy at all during this hour."},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is fire! Hell its better than Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. The chicken was perfectly seasoned, not too salty, you don't have to worry about your blood pressure shooting to the moon. The mac and cheese was delicious, and well as the potato salad. I gave them four stars instead of five, only because  they should add more options to their menu ie: family boxes ,waffles, potato fries, chicken sand- wiches,  salads, and even grilled chicken. Who knows, they may give Popeyes a run for their money when it comes to the famous chicken sandwich.

I wasn't too hungry so I ordered a 2 PIECE from the \\"Snack\\" section. And let me tell you ITS NOT SNACK SIZE! It's a really large breast and wing. The chicken is perfectly crispy! It also comes with 2 slices of bread. I read World's Famous Chicken and ignored the hot and spicy part so the spicy was a surprise to me. My mouth was on fire!! But the SWEET ICED TEA helped a lot.\\n\\nWe also ordered the FRIED OKRA and that was really good."},{"name":"300 Saratoga Cafe","address":"300 Saratoga St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Fan Steak Italian food with great service.

My family and I came here to try the \\"impossible burger\\" because 1. my wife is vegan with dietary restrictions and 2. my father-in-law wanted to have a healthy option of a burger. When we were seated, it was made known to us that they ran out of impossible burgers and that it would no longer be sold in the future because it would be a copyright issue with Burger King since they are planning to release a similar burger. After being disappointed, my wife and father-in-law ended up creating their own with the falafel burger, while I ordered the flip stack and my children shared a cheeseburger and Mac & cheese kids meal. All of our meals came out COLD: burgers and sides. The gluten free buns were dry. As a positive, the kids portions were large (similar to an adult portion). Even though we were disheartened about the quality of the food, our server (Brooke) was extremely accommodating to us which made our experience a bit better. This restaurant provides a great variety of options for folks with dietary restrictions, but they need to improve their quality of their burgers."},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I am from Memphis where the original Gus is.

Better than some places in DC and certainly better than other Ethiopian places in the area in terms of quality and service. Service is excellent. \\n\\nHowever if u have high blood pressure this place is not for u lol. The lines are long and they put a considerable amount of spices, salt, and oil in the food. So watch out for that. Otherwise I had the lamb tibs with a layer of shiro (mashed chickpeas), a side of miser (spicy red lentils) and rice. The miser was good but mixed with the lamb had a somewhat bitter aftertaste but still flavorful and well made. The lamb was very tender and I loved the jalape√±o peppers mixed in there. \\n\\nIt was all great just wished I had gotten a little bit more rice. All in all enjoyable and worth a try."},{"name":"Yalla","address":"99 Krog St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I love Yalla. I recommend getting the dishes in Laffa style.

Not quite creole but no less delicious.\\n\\nWe all ordered different things so we could try it all & absolutely everything was delicious. Eggrolls (A+), shark bites & honey muffins were amazing appetizers. I had the saut√©ed shrimp, okra stew & red rice for my entree... great portions sizes, SO much flavor - all good.\\n\\nThe icing on the cake, literally, was the Chucktown Chewie sundae.

No joke. \\n\\nI'll be back here VERY soon."},{"name":"Gourmet Garden","address":"139 Endicott St","city":"Danvers","stars":"3.5","text":"This location used to be the Mandarin, which was a pretty good Chinese restaurant. Now it's the \\"Gourmet Mandarin\\", has had a makeover (new paint, furniture), and is under new management. That's the good part. The bad part is that the quality under new ownership has gone downhill. (Note: I have been to China several times for business and have been a fan of Chinese food for decades.) \\n\\nService was good but I had a nervous moments when I realized that the waitress's English was pretty shaky. All I can say in Mandarin is \\"thank you\\" (xixi ne), which would have made for a very short conversation. She knew the menu, fortunately, so we were able to order.\\n\\nA few favorites such as Garlic-flavored Chicken are not on the new menu, which is shorter than the old menu and somewhat disorganized and disappointing. We ordered two Tsing Tao beers, Peking Ravioli as an appetizer, Orange-flavored Chicken, and White Rice to share.\\n\\nThe Peking Ravioli was overcooked; the dough was thick, almost burned, and chewy. The sauce on the orange-flavored chicken (dark meat from chicken thighs) was gooey and arguably gluey in consistency. Flavor was so-so. The rice was good. The meal overall was unappetizing, unappealing, and overpriced. \\n\\nWe're not going back."},{"name":"Virgils Gullah Kitchen & Bar","address":"3721 Main St","city":"College Park","stars":"4","text":"The advertise as being open until 11:00.
