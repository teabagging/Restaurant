I ordered the lunch Chicken Parm with salad as you can see here, and went to pick it up:\\n\\n1 x Chicken Parma (1 x $12.49) = $12.49\\n1 x Insalata   \\n2 x Guests   \\nSUBTOTAL $12.49 \\nCoupon Redeemed (Lobster 20%) ($2.50)\\nTAX $0.69 \\n\\nTOTAL \\n$10.68 \\n\\nI told the girl at order pickup my name and that I was there to pick up an order; she looked so confused and had to go and get someone for help.  Another girl came over and said \\"are you picking up the order for Brenda?\\".  No.  Brenda must have had a big party going on because she had several bags waiting to go, and I only had chicken and a salad.\\n\\nMore confusion.\\n\\nFinally, someone realized I was Margot and was there to pick up chicken parm (as I had stated), and it was put in a bag.  I handed over my credit card and the girl said \\"oh no, you paid online\\".  OK, maybe I did in my online account?  I figured she would know and I would see it on my credit card, and off I went to enjoy my lunch... or so I thought.\\n\\nThe chicken parm had very little taste and was burnt (how is this possible?), and the spaghetti was lacking something... it must have been flavor.  No butter was with the rolls, but I ate one while reaching into the bag for the salad and found nothing but an empty bag.  NO SALAD.\\n\\nI threw out the pasta and chicken, did not really enjoy the dry rolls, but ate them because they looked slightly better than the plastic bag.  I couldn't even be bothered with calling them back since it would mean getting back in the car and I was annoyed already.\\n\\nA couple of hours later, a message was on my phone from someone named Tanya at the restaurant telling ME I \\"must have misunderstood because I did not pay online\\" and needed to call her to pay for the order.  Hold on, I \\"misunderstood\\" them insisting that I had already paid???  \\n\\nOK, Bertucci's Waltham manager:  please call me to discuss this order for $10.68.  You forgot half of my order, so we are already down to $5.34, I tossed out most of it but will agree to pay for half of it, so please call me so I can pay you $2.67.\\n\\nOr ask Tanya (or whoever the two girls were at the desk at 2:35 that afternoon) for payment.

I've been spoiled and have had very famous tsukeman ramens before- My favorites are LA's Tsujita & NYC's Momosan by Morimoto.  Ramen Station's version is lamb, which I love!  When Ramen Station started opening for lunch, I hopped over on a cloudy weekday that was perfect for soup noodle slurping.  The space at Larkin on Memorial was fantastic- industrial, spacious, sleek...it's to the right of Full Commission coffee when you are looking at it from Memorial Drive.  As with their other restaurants, it is styled well- clean and simple with pops of color, along with the cool Atlanta Ramen Fest pop art posters decorating the walls. It was not crowded, and the cashier staff was very friendly.  I ordered & paid at the front counter, and was given an identifying card (instead of a number like other restaurants, I chose \\"Avatar the Last Airbender\\") to put on the table. There's a little self-serve station at the front counter to get utensils, napkins, sauces, and water.\\n\\nI was a little hesitant, since I've tried Taiyo and Suzy Siu's and both first impressions had been the same- this restaurant group has a very heavy hand with their salt!  I'm all for flavorful food, but even though tsukemen broth is usually more salty and concentrated than regular ramen broths, this tsukemen broth was so salty, it was inedible. The tsukemen arrived- one bowl of thin dark broth with lamb and chopped green onion, and one small bowl of noodles w/ pickled ginger, chopped onion, sliced avocado (weird), and sliced cucumber. Other items (menma mushroom, shoyu egg, corn, greens, spice, extra meat, extra noodles, extra broth) can be ordered a la carte for extra cost.  Though the broth was super salty, it was very thin...the tsukemen I've eaten in the past have been concentrated and thicker so that it clings to the noodles when dipped. The sliced items looks pretty presentation-wise, but I wish they were cut in a more vertical shape, for easy eating.  The crunchy cucumber and pickled ginger offset the lamb really well, but not sure if the mushy avocado played much of a role, other than the fact that I like avocado (but would have preferred a shoyu egg). The lamb was definitely the start of the show- flavorful, tender, not gamey, cooked to perfection. I would have ordered just the lamb and noodles if I could have- I'm guessing that lamb is seasonal for autumn and winter. At first, I tried adding a little water to the broth so I could consume it, but that thinned it further, without diluting the saltiness too much. \\n\\nSo I fished out the delicious lamb and ended up eating it on the noodles w/ sriracha and a HALF a spoon of broth spooned over the noodles....sort of my own MacGyver-ed dan dan noodles.  I took the 1 remaining cup of broth home and added 3 cups of hot water, along with my own noodles (as much as I wanted!)\\n\\nFor everyone's sake, all ramen restaurants- stop skimping on the Sun noodles!  I know they are premium, and that an extra helping costs more, but the default amount is barely enough for me as a snack- it's about a palm size of noodles.  Yes, I'm a hungry monster, but hey, a bit larger portion would be nice without having to pay extra.  With a bowl of ramen in Atlanta getting more and more expensive, I hate getting nickeled and dimed for everything...just make different sizes at different prices so I can order an XL.\\n\\nI don't really know what traditional or non-traditional tsukemen is like, but I do know what tastes good...in the meantime, I'll happily keep trying all the tsukemen I find :)  I'll probably go back to Ramen Station for their pork belly bao and for tonkotsu ramen, which I've had before from Taiyo and Suzy Siu's. Their other locations had eventually adjusted their salt levels so I'm sure Ramen Station will too."},{"name":"Cafe Java- Austin","address":"11900 Metric Blvd, Ste K","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I have to tell you, this is one of my go to spots.

They're filling! \\nHamburger--well done, decent amount of meat. \\nThey have a spot for condiments: ketchup/mayo/mustard packets, napkins, and straws...however, the straws are UNWRAPPED, which I think is a health hazard, it's gross--everyone reaching and grabbing straws, who knows where their hands have been? \\nAre they trying to pull an 'eco-friendly' move by having unwrapped straws? If so, kill the condiment packets and have condiment pumps everywhere.\\nOkay, now that that little rant is over, I will say it was nice that we were able to sit on the balcony, there was an excellent view of the hulk ride and other rides across the water, and you had pretty bushes and flowers by the balcony. \\nClean-ish tables and seating area, and clean bathrooms, and overpriced fast food at an amusement park...it is what it is.

We decided last minute to go and were lucky to get a table when we walked in around 7:30 pm.  They were having a special dinner that night where it was an 11 course meal for $120 per person and they determine the dishes, so you have no control.  You can also add wine pairings for each dish for an additional $85 per person. We did the 11 course meal, but not the wine pairings.  There were 11 dishes, so I do not remember them all, but I will highlight my favorites.  My favorites were the ribeye with cucumber and nasturtium (amazing) that comes with grandma lillian's potatoe bread, salmon with celery and shoyu (excellent), cabbage with sakebushi (excellent), aged beef with squash and fish sauce (excellent), crab with corn and day lily (good), salami cotto (excellent), beet with dill and pistachio (good) and a chicken liver tart (interesting, but good).  For dessert, they had a peach dulce de leche koji (excellent) and some caramel miso chocolates (excellent).  The portions were small, but by the time we had 11 servings, we were stuffed.  The service was excellent and the place is very nice and inviting.  This is definitely more of an intimate or small group place for adults.  They also have valet, which is convenient.

On the one hand, it's so good - one of few late-night sushi places you'll find in the metro Vancouver area overall - but so bad at the same time. I've been coming to Koto for years, but I think it's time I shared my honest thoughts on it.\\n\\nKoto is a small, Chinese-operated Japanese restaurant serving mostly Westernized sushi rolls and Japanese food in Richmond. While its opening hours start in the early evening, Koto is known for its late-night menu which begins at 9:00pm every night (and ends at 11:30pm which is the last order) except when they're closed on Sunday. I would recommend coming to Koto for their late-night menu, but not for their regular menu as the quality will not be justified by the price. If you come late, you'll learn very quickly why Koto is so popular. The prices can't be beat! \\n\\nOne of the reasons why I'm giving Koto a three-star is because of the service. Unfortunately, Koto is often very short on staff, usually with about one to three servers at any given time staffing the front of the house while a few chefs and kitchen hands operate in the background. Like I said, I've been coming here for years, and usually it's a hit or miss when it comes to the quality of service that you get. Sometimes the ladies are very nice and cheerful, but sometimes you'll notice that they're in a bad mood, quite quickly I might add, and you definitely won't want to agitate them. \\n\\nBefore you order, you should mention to the waitress if your order will be split bills or if it will be just one bill to be paid. If you tell them afterwards, they will tell you they can't split the bill and you'll be stuck! I have no idea why, but it has something to do with their system apparently.\\n\\nAlso, beware that if you stay to long AKA more than 10 minutes after you finish eating, you will most likely be asked to leave the restaurant if it's getting \\"busy\\". I get that they want to serve as many people as possible to make the most money possible for their dinner service, but sometimes it comes off as a bit rude. It's mostly due to how they say it rather than what they actually say. \\n\\nAnother reason why Koto is getting a three-star is because of the food. Let's face it, if you're going out for sushi at 10:00pm on a Wednesday, chances are that you probably want to satisfy a craving pretty bad. Koto will definitely do that for ya, just don't expect Michelin level food. Expect the bare minimum in terms of quality ingredients and presentation. That being said, the portion sizes are pretty decent, and at $3.95/roll, a 200lb guy like me can get full for a pretty reasonable price! I'd recommend the dynamite roll, spicy tuna roll, teriyaki chicken roll, and chopped scallop roll among others. Also worth mentioning is the rice they use; I'm not sure of they use sushi rice or not, but regardless they prepare it in a way that makes it mushy. I guess on the plus side, the rolls always stick together and never fall apart?\\n\\nThe salmon aburi nigiri sushi is probably one of my most favorite things on their menu, but at ~$2.00/piece, it'll set you back quickly if you order a bunch. One or two pieces is definitely a good purchase though for any meal. The aburi salmon is tasty, almost melts in your mouth, and packs a pretty flavourful punch. It'll probably be one of the most satisfying and delicious things that come out of the kitchen at Koto.\\n\\nOther things I've ordered in the past include:\\n\\nHand rolls/cones - mostly okay, good portion size\\nMentaiko don - not good, do not order\\nChicken karaage AKA deep fried chicken wings - okay\\nCurry katsu don - used to be good, but not anymore, do not order\\nAll nigiri sushi - okay, but don't expect much\\nAgedashi tofu - okay\\nChicken teriyaki don - okay\\n\\nOverall, if you're craving sushi at night, Koto is the place to go. To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of Matsuyama, but they do things pretty similar. However, if I had to choose between the two, I'd pick Koto over Matsuyama. That being said, you get what you pay for, and don't expect much when you're coming in for late night. If you're easily disappointed, maybe just stay home and wait a day to go to a proper Japanese restaurant to satisfy your sushi cravings? If you're okay with \\"not bad, but not good\\" sushi, then Koto will hit the spot and save you a few bucks while doing it.\\n\\nChances are, I'll be coming back since options for late-night food are limited and I have pretty consistent sushi cravings. I also live about 10 mins away so accessibility isn't an issue, personally. Its never the service or the quality of food that draws me back. It'll be the portion sizes for the price you pay."},{"name":"Merguez Restaurant","address":"11951 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"One of the worse Moroccan food I ever tasted.

Our waiter also came by with a tray stacked to the ceiling with four different types of bread and offered us our choice. Umm, yes can I try all four please?

And yes, yes I did.) The spot is pretty cozy with a small bar and a small patio (and a small parking lot). Located just past Wally's on North Mills, I'd recommend looking for street parking once you get anywhere in the vicinity.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the Roto Canai, Roast duck, beef Banh Mi, and Singapore Mei Fun. The beer menu was pretty impressive, and featured a good amount of Lagunitas brews, and Florida brews too (bottles only though). The sake menu had maybe 8 or so choices and is something I will explore on my next visit, along with the skewers, fish filet with black bean sauce, and soups! I wasn't a fan of the Hawker's Fish Taco though...it was more like a fried fish stick, and there are just way better fish tacos in Orlando.\\n\\nThe service was super mediocre. The host did a great job keeping everyone organized and educated as to when tables would open up, but the table service was pretty mundane. We waited awhile to be greeted; and although she was friendly and did a good job giving us a tour of the menu, when our food finally started arriving we had to wait for plates, napkins, chopsticks. Drinks were routinely empty. I manage to ignore bad service pretty decently, especially when busy eating, so it didn't impact the experience too much (but it certainly was a factor in not giving 5 stars). I would definitely advise avoiding sitting on the patio though, as the customers there seem to have been the ones that were being ignored the most.\\n\\nOne thing that should be noted is: the word \\"authentic\\" was only mentioned on the skewers and the roast duck soup; and \\"traditional\\" was only indicated on maybe a couple of the rice dishes.

I finally decided to go for breakfast one morning and am so happy that I did.   \\n\\nThe diner is small and always a hoppin' place on the weekends with a line of people outside waiting for a table.  Luckily, your wait will probably only be about 20 minutes max, as they do a fantastic job of getting you served, fed, and out the door quickly, all while not feeling rushed.  Each table has fun salt/pepper shakers on the table (maybe that's where the name comes from).  \\n\\nThey have the usual diner breakfast on their menu, all with reasonable prices, but make sure you look at the chalkboard on the wall...that's where you'll find the fun, unique breakfast items.  They have so many delicious things on there that it will be hard for you to choose what to order.  I decided to be boring and order a traditional ham steak, eggs, and hash browns for my breakfast.  The eggs and hash browns were fantastic, however the ham steak was nothing to be excited over.  It was thinly sliced and overcooked, which made it dry.  I definitely wasn't thrilled with it and it's one of my go-to favorite breakfast items.  I would definitely go a different route next time and order off the chalkboard menu!\\n\\nAlong with the usual traditional diner coffee, they also offer latte's (french vanilla, hazelnut, etc.), and Cuban coffee which is what I got.  The Cuban coffee was delicious!  It's served in a tiny paper cup (as it's extremely strong) and it's nicely sweet to counterbalance that strong coffee taste.  I loved it, and it definitely woke me up a bit.\\n\\nMy overall experience here was great and will returning in the future for more breakfast fun!"},{"name":"Nick's Food To Go","address":"240 Martin Luther King Jr Dr SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"If you looking for customer no service, place a order here without ordering $10 worth of food.\\nI ordered a Gyro without knowing the golden rule and I got, \\"Ten dollars of real money, no shit!\\" First I thought he was cracking a joke and I was so shocked at the way this old man was talking to me in front of my family, my mouth flew open.

After 45 minutes of waiting and wondering where our food was (and our waitress being clueless about anything) all our food came out at once. \\n\\nThe won ton soup was salty and bad (and served with wonton strips or something on a plate hot enough to burn us).

The manager came over and said he'd take the dim sum off the bill (thanks so much - considering it was garbage and I had already sent it back and told them it was clearly microwaved). He gave a cursory sorry but didn't really care and walked off. We ate the rest of the food besides the wonton soup which was horrible. The noodles weren't good but were mildly edible and we were starving so we ate them. My son now has a stomach ache. \\n\\nWe paid and left as quickly as we could (the waitress laughably asked if we wanted to order anything else - we told her we wanted to leave).

Cream. Drizzle. To get the consistency needed to \\"drizzle\\" the sour cream is watered down with... maybe milk?  Maybe some fresh Chattahoochee agua? It's gross. \\n\\nThe homemade buffalo sauce on the Buffalo chicken taco... No.  Buy some Texas Pete's, for the love of God. Whatever's happening in that kitchen is not buffalo sauce. And then they add lettuce, tomato, pickles, and cool ranch.  No. No. No. No. \\n\\nThe grilled fish taco is blackened mahi, slaw, and pico de gallo. Pretty normal, ridiculous purple coleslaw aside. But then they go a step too far and add a tomatillo avocado sauce.  The fish and the tomatillo sauce is all that's needed.  No one needs a full salad bar shoved on top of their taco.  \\n\\nIT'S TOO MUCH KITCHEN PEOPLE...TOO MUCH. \\n\\nThey really need to reduce the amount of \\"gourmet\\" (eye roll) ingredients and drop the price from $4.25 to $3-$3.50/taco. \\n\\nCoco Chanel once said \\"before leaving the house, a lady should look in the mirror and remove one accessory\\"...

Now i hate to bring in race but 1) I've never had a McDonald's macchiato, so i felt stereotyped 2) there's a chalkboard which depicts the different cup sizes and 3) that was poor customer service and she could've communicated it in a much more neutral, less ignorant way. I felt that she made her McDonald's comment because i was a young black woman with an Afro and as a paying customer of any color she could've just held up a cup or stated the size in ounces.

I miss those!\\n\\nThe cinnamon roti dessert is pretty amazing too. \\n\\nHawkers would get 5 stars except the service is always dreadfully slow and intermittent.  I don't mind that my dishes come out willy-nilly - that's the way it goes with shareables/tapas style but whenever I go with a small group or just a two person table we seem to be waiting for our drinks to be refilled, to order more food/dessert or finally get the check."},{"name":"Shaka Shaka Tea House","address":"4038 N Goldenrod Rd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"5","text":"There is a real language barrier here .

A√ßa√≠ pulp is suppose to be even richer in antioxidants than cranberries, raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, or blueberries. A√ßa√≠ is a medium sized reddish-purple berry from the a√ßa√≠ palm tree and native to Central and South America.\\n\\nThe way a√ßa√≠ is used in a blender or bowls is to blend the a√ßa√≠ berry into a thick pulp. Basically, you can stick your spoon in it and it will stand straight up. A√ßa√≠ tastes kind of like a combination of blueberry and strawberry with a hint of chocolate. This is the base to the bowl and on top of it oatmeal, peanut butter, fresh fruit, dried fruit, cocoa, and much more is layered on top. The bowls actually look like a work of art. \\n\\nI'm absolutely in love with a√ßa√≠ bowls and smoothies.

Next up we had the chicken sekuwa, marinated chicken in Himalayan spices cooked on skewers - spicy and different, it fired up our palettes and was perfect with the mint garnish.  Next was the main sharing meal, a vegetable thali - think of a mixed assortment of their best veggie dishes (while the meats are amazing, the veggies might be better), including black lentils in a tangy sauce (balanced and complex), veggie curry (fresh and aromatic), saut√©ed spinach with Szechuan pepper (just ridiculously delicious), and a highlight among highlights was the potato \\"vindaloo\\" which was...seriously I'm out of adjectives...\\n\\nFinished it off with the best homemade rice pudding I've ever had - textured and creamy, chunks of pistachio and cardamom...what a way to finish a meal...\\n\\nAte way too much but glad I did - Hari is a delight and he has put all the best lessons learned from Rang into this new endeavor.

Their hot pot beef bulgogi i is the best I've had and will leave you wanting more. The broth is savoury and very flavourful and the pot comes with an assortment of different ingredients such as rice cake, vegetables, glass noodles, and a heaping pile of beef to top it all off. Oh and a bowl of sticky Korean rice too! This place is probably the best for kimbap. I always get their beef kimbap and let me tell you, it's a damn good deal for the amount of food you get! The roll is thick and super packed with burdock root (I think), yellow radish, carrots, spinach, and egg. Super yummy and super flavourful. \\n\\nTheir seafood pancake is alright. Not too much seafood in there (dai jeung gum is better) and it's not as crispy as I'd prefer.  Their fried dumplings are pretty decent, as is their fried chicken, although neither are usually my go tos (see above!) \\n\\nI've heard good things about their ramen but I have yet to try! \\n\\nProbably one of the best Korean places in Richmond.

And generally supportive of local businesses, especially in a growing Grant Park. And for me, finding a ramen spot that even comes close to the ramen I had in Japan is impossible so far! But, this place has unfortunately taken claim for my least favorite so far. Which really sucks to say bc I LOVE Taiyo and Suzy Siu's. \\n\\nWalked in, cool, casual atmosphere, order at the counter, sit and wait for food. Quick and easy. I ordered the brussell sprouts and the chicken shio and my friend ordered the tonkotsu. \\n\\nThe Brussels were great. But the ramen left a lot to be desired. The noodles in the chicken shio tasted straight up like butter. And the broth was flavorless.  The chicken was good. But the egg had a spiced (like cinnamon or something) aftertaste, which was really surprising and not in a good way. \\n\\nMy friend's tonkotsu was pretty bland as well. We added soy sauce and sriracha to give it some sort of flavor. The worst part is though, when they brought the food out, the girl spilled it on him causing some minor burns to his arm. She was super apologetic and of course accidents happen, but with a scalding bowl of broth, you have to take extra care when it could cause legit injury. \\n\\nAbout 20 minutes in to eating. My friend and I both look at each other with wide eyes and pursed lips...the classic \\"uh-oh, tum tum is angry\\" look. We both immediately felt the same bubble guts coming on and had to find a bathroom almost immediately. Could have been a pretty big coincidence, but I don't think I'm willing to take that chance again. The brussels were good, but not enough to make me go back and try something else on the menu. \\n\\nI hope others feel differently bc I want to see a local business thrive, but would suggest they take a serious look at their menu and revamp it to really stand out. Idk, maybe just bring over the recipe from Taiyo and it would be great. Until then, I'll stick to Lifting Noodles and Ton Ton."},{"name":"Buckeye Chili & Smokehouse","address":"30 S Young St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"I have worked downtown for 20 years and this place has been everything...El vaquero, the Inn Between, some comfort food place, and now this.

We went there to celebrate my husband's birthday.  We have been waiting for this new location to open for months and my husband was looking forward to go. We went there to give it a try even after reading through some not very good reviews on Yelp and after hearing about their bad customer service from another friend of mine when they went there for Mother's Day.  Honestly my expectation at that point was not high.  The interior was certainly beautiful and upgraded compare to the Chamblee location and waiters were all very friendly.  Unfortunately we left the restaurant that day very disappointed with the price and taste of the dishes. We ordered Roasted Duck, BBQ Pork, stir fried straw vegetables, 2 lobsters and 2 steamed fresh oysters in black bean sauce and I will say 1-star for all dishes except maybe a 2 stars for the oysters and lobsters.  Dishes were really overpriced and tastes were very bland.  Both the roasted duck and BBQ pork looked old and looked like they were reheated in a microwave before serving to us.  The stir fried veggies was bland.  The oysters were fresh at $6.00 per piece but the black bean sauce tasted like it came from a store bought jar black bean sauce that I use at home.  The two lobsters that we paid for over $65 were definitely a complete rip-off.  I was told by one waitress that it was $13.95/lb then the next waiter said it was $39.95 for two and then we got charge $67.90 for two lobsters that were at most 1-1.5 lbs each.  I questioned the price and they insisted that they told me it was $33.95 per lobster and I told them in their face that it was overpriced.  We will never go back there again not even for dim sum.  It was a huge disappointment and the most expensive worst dinner we ever had.  I wish them the best of luck surviving in their new location.

It looks really nice from the outside so we made plans to come here on a Saturday night. Surprisingly it wasn't busy at all, maybe because we came around 9. There was a lot of good things here so I'll try to keep this as to the point as possible. \\n\\nDrinks: Moscow mule was just as you'd expect. Two of us got a prickly pear mojito, but I got mine with whiskey instead of rum. Definitely would recommend. The best though, was the old fashioned. My friend was nice enough to let all of us try his, and we all agreed it was the best we've ever had. \\n\\nFood!: Loved that they give you a taste of their pimento cheese right away to munch on. We got the layered queso to start and needless to say, it was gone pretty quick. If you like the Kerbey queso from Kerbey Lane, this is it's older, more sophisticated sister. However, the entrees were out of this world. The star here was definitely the Chicken Fried Beef Rib....oh my gosh. Just get it, trust me. I got the pumpkin seed chicken breast, super rich and creamy. LOVED the goat cheese drizzle and the huge portobello mushroom. Other highlights were the burger (get the sweet potato fries, so yum), and the green chile pork tacos! We were all silent for a good 15 minutes while we ate. Every single plate was clean at the end.\\n\\nDessert: Everyone was hesitant to get dessert since we demolished our other food, but I managed to convince everyone that we needed to try some. We ended up with the peach cobbler and the blondie pie. Both came with Mexican Vanilla ice cream. When I tell you that the blondie pie will change your life, I mean it. Do NOT skip dessert here, even if you have to get it to go. \\n\\nService: I'm kinda bummed that I forgot to ask for my waitress's name, because she was great! Super friendly, had great menu knowledge and recommendations. When she found out we were celebrating a birthday she grabbed us the blondie pie with a candle, and boy I'm glad she did because like I said, that thing was amazing.

We opted to skip several tried and tested fabulous Indian restaurants we have visited in the past to give  Bollywood Bistro a try since we were in area. Our mistake.\\n \\nThe interior of the place had posters of modern Bollywood Stars hung up like you might find in a 14 year old girl's room in India.  The music over the speakers sounded like top 40 India pop which annoyed my dining partner (I didn't mind it).  You could see all the cleaning solutions on the kitchen wall shelves in full view from our booth, showing the sloppy lack of attention that went into details of organizing the place. The customers' perspective did not seem to be taken into consideration.  \\n\\nLooking through the menu there were plently of mouth watering choices.  My dining partner and I both focused in on a select few and wanted feedback from our waitress.  I asked the waitress what she thought of the Shrimp Karahi compared to the Shrimp Masala Tandoori.  She told me the Shrimp Karahi had a sauce and the Shrimp Masala Tandoori did not.  I noted to her in the description of Shrimp Masala Tandoori it states it does indeed have a sauce and she said 'Oh yea' but said couldn't really explain any difference between the 2 dishes.  Another worker (the owner?) was right next to our table and I was surprised he didn't jump in and explain the dishes and their differences. With no feedback I ended up ordering the Shrimp Karahi.  My dining partner asked the waitress what Vegetable Croquettes were which were listed in the description of the Malai Kofta dish. The waitress said they were vegetable balls and were very, good, and one of her favorites.  My dining partner made the mistake of taking the waitresses advice despite witnessing her lack of knowledge just moments ago, and the Malai Kofta dish was ordered.  We also order Vegetable Pakoras and an order of Garlic Naan.  Total price was roughly $30 before tax/tip.\\n \\n \\nThe Vegetable Pakoras with Mint Chutney were tasty, it's hard to mess up deep fried items after all.  Shortly after that our dishes arrived and the sauces in both were far less complex and more soupy and watered down than we had at any Indian restaurants before.  Despite that, the Shrimp Karahi did have a good flavor and the spice level that I choose, 8 out of 10, was right on, the shimp were ok.   The rice was spot on and we both thought the Naan was good.  The Malai Kofta was a disappointment to say the least.  The waitress failed to mention that Coquettes were also made with cheese and there were no vegetables in them like she stated. Essentially, they were flour, cheese bit dumplings. The taste and texture gave me visions of what an uncooked Hush Puppy from Long John Silvers would taste like, something I hadn't had since I was a child and for good reason, it was disgusting.  The waitress while friendly and prompt with refilling our water kept sweeping and vacuumed the entire time around our table. How terribly rude and disruptive during our meal.  If they didn't want customers they should have locked the doors, but I think she was just as clueless about table manners as she was about the dishes.

I was shocked, horrified, and had been admittedly bamboozled!! Talking my date to going to Logan's or Outback was out of the question since hunger was at an all time high so I had to make do with Houston's very minimal steak offerings or a burger. I resorted to a cheeseburger because that was the only thing on the menu that appealed to me. The burger was just okay. They try to be fancy with their food, but honestly is just comes off as not that appetizing and way too expensive for what they give you as your main dish and its side.\\n\\nThe ambiance of the place is too dark for my taste. Even the restroom was dark and sort of weird with the very dim spotlights. It's like being in a scene in a horror film. Now, sitting at the table is very quaint and intimate with the right person (like in my situation), but otherwise if you are coming with friends, it may be super awkward. At times, I felt like I should have a flashlight to leave the table and go anywhere. I thought I was out camping for a minute!

The price isn't bad at this place. I do like the efficiency of making the order and then paying for it. Then sitting down at the table. Once the food was ordered it was quick. The place is clean and modern, so that's a plus. However, I'm Korean. I also know this isn't an area that has a large population of Koreans. But I got the sense that although the food is traditional Korean, the food was definitely sweet. I ordered kimchi jjigae and it was sweet with not a lot of substance and more broth than ingredients. Maybe it's a part of Korea the owners are from but it wasn't my cup of tea. When I go to a Korean restaurant I test the place out by how good or bad the kimchi jjigae is because you can't make it bad. Unless the way you make the kimchi is tasteless. This wasn't bad per say but I was disappointed. I guess I'll stick to making it myself at home. When I go to a Korean restaurant anywhere, there are side dishes, what I got was one side dish of kimchi. I live in Boston, plenty of Korean restaurants around here for the price I paid for this stew and there are multiple side dishes that come with it. I'm sure the Korean BBQ they offer are great because I did try a bulgogi dish my friend ordered and it had the flavor and char that should come with it but it's almost like this wasn't really geared towards Koreans but non-Koreans.

I have been a fan of Serranos for many years now till now.  We would come for the wonderful fajitas and almost always have a margarita with it.  I always call the for premium liquor and ask for mine to be in a tall glass. A little later a waitperson came back and apologized but said they were doing it different now it could only come in a shaker and I would pour it into a glass I said ok but I didn't want it to be overly strong. That's why I asked for it in a tall glass!  The waitperson called the manager over because I was concerned about this and the manager seem unbending about i!!. So the waiter brought out this tiny litter metal shaker probably 6 to 8 oz. at most with the smallest rock glass I have seen, just a little bigger than some shot glasses 3 or 4 oz.  So I go well ok, then I start to pour from this little shaker, which did not pour properly at all. Cheap! The pour on the shaker needs to be flat not rounded.  We ended up drinking out of the shaker.  Now for some they might just write it off that they didn't know how to pour out of shaker, but I spent over 15 years in the past working and managing bars so I have bit of experience in this area.  This little shaker idea needs to go into the trash in my opinion or at the very least put it in a normal size shaker!  The mexican matinees still come in a normal size shaker. So whats the deal?  \\n\\nWe are meeting a friend for dinner next week and normally we would meet at Serranos, but because of this silly change in their premium margs we are meeting elsewhere!  I may come back when I don't plan to have a drink but as long as this new policy I think I can find other places that are not trying to micromanage my drinks!!"},{"name":"Blenders and Bowls - Downtown","address":"206 E 4th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Loved it!

I live up in the north suburbs, so trekking it downtown just for acai is unfortunate. For those of you who have never had the fortune of eating an acai bowl: imagine berry-flavoured frozen yogurt mixed with smoothie. That's about it. I've never had a smoothie (the \\"blender\\" half of Blenders & Bowls), so cannot speak on that.\\n\\nThe good:\\n\\n- Acai is delicious and well blended. I've never had a bowl that was too runny or too chunky.\\n- Fairly prompt service. Others have complained about a long wait, but I've gone in during peak hours (e.g. right after lunch or around 5pm) and have never had a problem.\\n- Toppings are delicious and fresh.\\n- I have never had a problem with snootyness like others have. No, the servers aren't super-upbeat-chipper, but they do crack a smile and act cordially. That's all I expect - I don't need my servers to be my new friends.\\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\n- Prices. Geez, are these bowls expensive. The cheapest/smallest option (a small OG bowl) will cost you $7, while the large Bowl of Paradise will run you $10.25. These aren't \\"large\\" bowls by any means either. The smalls are like a cereal bowl, with the larges just barely bigger.\\n- Limited seating options. There are 3-4 high tables, but sometimes they're taking up by yoga students waiting for class to start, or hanging out chatting after class. Not a huge problem if you take your bowl to go, or use one of the outside tables.\\n\\nMy recommendation: the Chill Berry bowl. It has acai, strawberries, bananas, apple juice, hemp granola, blueberries, goji berries (imagine not-so-sweet craisins), and honey. The proportions are always wonderful, with just the right blend of crunchy and fruity in each bite.\\n\\nLong story short: very delicious acai bowls for a price. And in my case, for a 15-mile drive. But hey, sometimes it's worth it."},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Asian fusion !

I found that though these salons are in completely different countries, the level of service as well as quality of food was consistently high at each one. Naturally I was excited to find a salon in Vancouver which is much more convenient to access from my home in Seattle. Unfortunately though, it turns out that my previous experiences only worked to set me up for extreme disappointment and irritation due to the abysmal level of service. \\nMy husband I hadn't made a reservation but we were able to walk and get seated on a late and slow Sunday afternoon. First, it took nearly 10 minutes for a server to give us menus and water then another 15-20 to take our orders. We had a few questions about a couple of the teas as well as food items but were met with \\"I don't know\\" as an answer. Not \\"I'm not sure, let me ask\\" or \\"I'll find out for you\\" but she literally stated \\"I don't know\\" and just stood there expecting us to continue ordering. At this point I figured that she was either just a bitch who hated life or she was poorly trained by a management team that had no interest in perpetuating good customer service. Either way, I was justifiably irritated and chose our usual- the Chic set menu. The food was decent but definitely not the quality or flavor I had come to expect from the TWG locations in Asia and definitely not the same execution- the finger sandwiches looked quite messy in comparison. \\nAfter our food arrived we literally not approached by our waitress or any other staff member again. I suspect that this had to do with the fact that they were understaffed in the first place as well as the  medium sized group of clearly affluent Asian women that arrived a little later. Rather than assist the other smaller parties in the restaurant the staff went out of their way to provide them the service that I had come to expect from TWG. Perhaps next time I should bring along a current Louis Vuitton bag instead of one from two seasons ago if I want good service.\\nDon't waste your time here."},{"name":"Quincy Market","address":"4 S Market St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"If you visit Boston, you have to at least visit Quincy market before you leave.

I saw old, young, bikers, moms, young professionals, blue collar, hipsters, and artists all dining here last night. \\n\\nFor me it was A-OK. I know this place will thrive in warmer months. Winter, it is not as good a fit. There is no place to wait except a bench that seat 2.5 ppl. Decor was super fun! I could have used a little more non-red light, but otherwise, the theme was well represented and created a great atmosphere. Tables are jam packed in there. Prepare to be bumped by people walking by at any moment. It's not their fault, there really isn't any room. However, seats are comfy!\\n\\nService was friendly across the board. Definitely some confusion with the host. Friendly indeed, but seemed confused or disorganized. A couple left after being left unwelcomed and unsure at the door. Add a bunch of people with no where to comfortably wait and the magic was lost.  Waiter was efficient, not overly enthused, and host was good support to wait staff. \\n\\nFood was pretty good. Everyone who knows me knows I hate the concept of small plates. To me, small plates = rip off. So, of course I ordered a \\"larger\\" plate, which was still small. I got the spicy peanut pasta, which was good. Don't bother adding chicken, it is not worth $2. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was tasty and veggies crisp. My boyfriend ordered the Hawaiian burgers and crab rangoon. He really enjoyed his meal, especially the rangoon, which were definitely made in house by their unique shape. The Burgers, although mini, were juicy and well seasoned. Our friends got Amy's Asian Pasta, which he said was good, and Thai fried rice, which was not a favorite. Sweet potato wedges were enjoyed by them as well. \\n\\nOur bill was under $25 with no cocktails, just an ice tea. I consider that pretty reasonable.  I would definitely return. Specifically for specials once they start running them. \\n\\nAdditionally, they are building a Hills Market directly next door, which is highly appealing!"},{"name":"The Shrunken Head","address":"251 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"There aren't many good live music bars in downtown Columbus, so Shrunken Head kind of dominates that market, especially if you're music type is rock. \\n\\nThey have great daily specials and a pretty good selection of liquor.

To access the restaurant, you are forced to walk in the driveway from the sidewalk. The terrace in front of the restaurant should be opened directly to the sidewalk so pedestrians can enter without being run over by a Lexus SUV and leave -- the exit is even more problematic -- without being run over by a Lexus SUV.

Leroy and Lewis do everything exceptionally well, but its all the tiny details and nuances that they pour their heart into that really elevate the experience. For example, having house made pickles, jalepenos and kimchi that cut through the richness of all their meats or opting to use Martin's potato bread for a classier take on traditional bbq accompaniments. The little things add up quickly.\\n\\nThe meat board changes somewhat regularly so it can be hard to choose between the tantalizing options, but we came on the weekend intentionally to grab brisket and oh boy is it good. The lean part of the brisket, is some of the moistest I've had anywhere (thank you akaushi) and is the mark of a true pitmaster, although admittedly it is expensive. A cheaper, yet equally delicious option are the beef cheeks, which are honestly not that different from the barbacoa. It has a velvety texture that just holds together. Shred it a bit more and add some garnishes and you probably have the barbacoa. They also had a first time item today, curry sausage, which I personally found excellent and would actually put it as my number two choice after the brisket - very flavorful and deeply savory.\\n\\nSides all looked really good so it was also agonizing to choose just two, but ranch pork rinds and sweet potato mash it was. The buttery sweet mash was what thanksgiving should taste like every year, while the pork rinds are crunchy and have just a slight kiss of ranch. Both are good accompaniments to the bbq.\\n\\nOne final note: even though I'm firmly in the no sauce camp of good bbq, I'll make an exception for Leroy and Lewis - that beet bbq sauce is really something else that will change your mind about bbq sauce in general. In the immortal words of my wife - \\"as good as this meat is, it's honestly just a delivery vehicle for this bbq sauce.\\" I wish they sold bottles of the stuff so I could douse it on everything. \\n\\nThis is probably my new go to bbq joint as there's no line, great bbq fare and taste is second to none.

I debated between a 2-star (service, Meh, I've experienced a LOT better) and 3-star (food) review, but decided to look beyond our waiter since the other waiters seemed pleasant. The whole time we ate this evening, we were wishing we had a different table with a friendlier waiter. The other waiters and waitresses seemed to be interested in greeting their tables. Ours was not the case. Not only did it take him awhile to greet us upon being seated, he didn't even bother walking us through the menu. We asked about the much talked about steak tar-tar and other dishes, only to receive a passive-aggressive, \\"Where did you see that? Did you see that on our online menu that's updated daily because we change our menu every day?\\" That would have been good to know, and besides, we were just asking about it. It's a shame really. The space at Dai Due is beautiful and the outdoor patio would be great in the fall. Fortunately for us, our favorite Italian food trailer restaurant was right across the street.

Minimal to no waiting in line on most days, and it's paired in an area that has a nice -- but separate beer garden (Cosmic) -- where you can grab a cold one to compliment the smoked meats. I've had almost everything on the menu -- beef cheeks, pulled pork, sausage, brisket and barbacoa. Also tried out some speciality items during \\"heat week\\" (jungle curry pork belly burnt end). It's all been delicious. \\n\\nHere's why they don't get 4-5 stars in my book: \\n-- The folks in the trailer pushing the meats could be a bit warmer to customers; I have questions anytime I go to a new place -- recommendations, etc --  and it didn't seem like they are into talking with the people buying their product. \\n-- It's damn expensive. DAMN EXPENSIVE. $20 for a two-meat, two-side combo (came out to basically $23 with taxes and a $1 tip). Compare that to the $14 two-meat combo plate at Micklethwait, where the food is equally fantastic. This place doesn't size up to others when you consider the price difference. \\n-- They stopped giving kimchi as a side accompaniment when you order meats by the pound or one of the meat combo platters. This was a staple for a while, and it was one of the ways this trailer differentiated it's offerings from other barbecue spots in town. They've even set up shop at a farmer's market downtown where they specifically offer Korean-fusion barbecue dishes. My first couple of visits they would just plop some kimchi on the side of the smoked meats. It was automatically part of the order. But now kimchi is reserved for sandwich orders only at the main trailer off S. Congress, per my last visit (Oct 27). That's pretty ridiculous, considering the prices are already inflated out the wazoo, a small portion of kimchi costs pennies on the dollar to produce and, again, new-age barbecue is how this place has marketed itself and often has fusion-inspired dishes. It's the small things that keep people coming back some times, and in this case I really enjoyed the side of kimchi with my brisket. I don't like that they've made that offering specific to sandwich orders or that the people in the trailer look at you like an idiot if you ask for a side of kimchi, considering this was part of the standard process until recently \\n-- Have tried almost everything on the menu except for the elusive smoked/cast iron burger. They have this option advertised as part of the \\"dinner\\" offering online. But every time I've showed up during dinner hours they say they aren't cooking burgers on that day (has happened more than once now). They used to update the menu online to reflect all of their offerings daily/weekly. Very helpful. Now the online menu is static, and doesn't reflect when they are/aren't actually preparing burgers (still says you can get one for dinner, even though that isn't actually true). I drove from the other side of town recently and waited until early evening hours to show up, so I could get the burger. Much to my dismay, there was no burger. And I'm not sure that I'll be willing to make the trek across town for the off-shoot chance of scoring a burger in the future. \\n-- For a short bit they had a ghost-chili infused hot sauce/bbq sauce. It was fantastic. I had it during heat week and then again months later. That is no more. Like the kimchi side, it's the small things that separated this place from other dope barbecue joints. And without the side of kimchi and the super-hot barbecue sauce, I can get everything this place offers cheaper somewhere else."},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Dined here many times , most recently last night and now just getting around to my review.

Our waiter also informed us that Stella no longer does the mimosa flights even though they are still on the menu (we called afterward and someone else on staff said that they still do the flights during the weekend brunch--weird that we couldn't order them!). The bar countertop seemed covered in used dishes and other debris. Tables around us took 20-30 minutes to be completely bussed.

The burger looked like a whopper and taste was fantastic.  It tasted just like a real beef whopper.  The taste and look  was the same as the regular whopper.  I could not tell the difference between the  'real beef' and the 'plant beef' whopper.  \\nI did not  have a heavy feeling in my stomach after eating the impossible whopper.  \\nyou have to try this.  \\nas for the dog.  too bad...  I ate it all!!!!"},{"name":"Smoke and Bones","address":"999 Marine Drive","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"For smoky juicy ribs, go to Smoke and Bones.

It's in the space that was formerly Mingos.  It's crazy because it looks really swanky and upscale which is not what I'm accustomed to when having Thai food.

My wife and I stumbled onto this place awhile back looking for Asian type cuisine (for her) on a Sunday. This was one of few places open that day. \\nParking can be tricky at times as the parking lot is pretty small, you will most likely have to park on the highway or possibly on side street if there is a space.\\nThe staff is very friendly and usually attentive. Although, they can be a bit slow once after you've gotten your food which isn't a big deal for me as long as they check up after the serve. They always looked out if I wanted a little something extra without charging the full price which is very nice.\\nSo, now the food. My wife loves their Salt & Pepper Prawns and the Calamari dishes. She appreciates how Decoy does it fresh without overcooking the food, especially, the Calamari.\\nI've had their fish and chips, burgers, fish burger, and basic breakfast with sausage and a side biscuit and gravy. All of it was solid except for the breakfast. The breakfast was just...ok. Because the Decoy doesn't necessarily offer a breakfast that includes an option with biscuit and gravy , that meal got a bit spendy. Ran around $15-16. The biscuit and gravy didn't have much meat nor flavor, the sausage looked and tasted like something out of a Brown N' Serve package (in my opinion, of course).

I had to reaaaally force myself to finish 3 of the 6 falalfel after finishing the plate.\\n\\nThe chicken kebob was good, and the sweet rice was AMAZING. It's made with carrots and orange and literally is the best rice I've had at a Mediterranean restaurant ever. For $15 you can get yourself a really good plate (my coworkers got the turkey shwarma and falafel plate) that'll be more than enough food for a good lunch.\\n\\nWe ordered our meals to go and Jake actually came out with our meals after packing them up. Everyone was just so, so, nice here. When I was paying another lady came in and the cashier asked if she wanted the usual. I love how they know their customers, who also wave and say hi to Jake.

It's a good spot to meet friends and shoot the breeze for a couple of hours.\\n\\nI had no idea that I was going to end up at Waxy's this past Saturday night as my boyfriend kept it a secret. He said we were going \\"slumming\\" in a \\"bad town\\". Har har - if you know Lexington at all - you'll get the joke. Anyway - we met his friends and sat at the bar for drinks and apps. \\n\\nTo be honest, 3 starts is generous as there was nothing remarkable about the food or drinks. I ordered a beverage off their drink menu, but can't for the life of me remember what it was. Nothing grand. For my 2nd drink, I asked the bartender if she could do a hot toddy and she said sure! I got a cup of whiskey water with the tea bag and honey on the side so I could \\"make it like I want it\\". I guess that's nice, but I could have done that at home with no skill. I go out because I want other people to make me drinks.\\n\\nWe ordered the nachos with a side of guac to nosh on. The nachos themselves came out burnt. As soon as it was set down, I was asking myself how they could serve nachos that looked like that (I mean - they're nachos - they're not meant to be pretty, but don't burn the hell out of the chips!). Instead of making a fuss, I picked at it. The guac was pretty good, but there wasn't enough of it for the large plate of nachos (and the fact that they charge extra for it).\\n\\nOur party of 4 then went up a few steps and played a couple games of darts and pool. I really love that it's free to play and set away from the bar and restaurant areas so that you don't feel like you're being too loud or annoying anyone. While up there, my bf got me 2 more drinks - a sad French 75 (which was his bad - this is not a French 75 sort of establishment) and a 7 and 7 which was the only decently mixed drink I had there... note - 2 ingredients. \\n\\nThere was a band playing and they were pretty entertaining. The male singer was good, but the female was quite terrible. In any case - it was a nice addition to the vibe (I thought... the rest of my party just wanted to play songs on the jukebox).\\n\\nAll in all - it's fine if you're in the area and you want something casual or you want to play darts/pool.

We tried a place up the street from us on the Saturday before Valentine's.  They were total chaos, understaffed and a 40 minute wait, so 'bye Felicia!  Then we thought about a place some friends recommended, but it was more buffet style and we really aren't into buffets. \\nThen I heard about Dil Se,  the online menu looked great and prices were affordable.  So I made a Saturday night reservation and off we went.  It's in a slightly less congested part of downtown, so we managed to find street parking, score!  Once inside, the ambiance was very warm and cozy, with dimmed lighting and earth tones throughout.  Our hostess was very kind and friendly.  \\nWe loved the relaxing vibe to the place. For a starter, we had the Chicken 65, which is Indian spiced chicken that's lightly fried and topped with chopped onions and green curry leaves. It was very tasty!  So tasty that someone who was just being seated asked me what we were having. \\nFor entrees, I had the Kerala fish curry and my partner ordered the lamb curry.  I have to have it mild, but he likes it hot-hot-hot!  My curry was wonderful, just the right amount of spice, I didn't have to guzzle water.  I tasted my partner's lamb curry and it was very flavorful as well. He was very happy with it.  They serve the entrees with basmati rice, but we also ordered a side of raita, which is a yogurt and cucumber sauce.  It was good enough, but I did think it could have been improved if they had made it thicker and perhaps added some chopped, fresh mint.   Our other side dish, garlic naan, was divine!  A slightly crispy flat bread with lots of garlic, highly recommended!  \\nService was efficient enough, but a bit spotty.  There were a couple of times they could have been quicker.

I liked it so much I ate breakfast there 3 days in a row!  They don't have a parking lot and street parking is metered so make sure to bring some change.\\n\\nMy visits were on a Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday morning.  On all three days we were able to find street parking right away in front of the restaurant. My college age son joined me the first two visits. On all 3 days we were seated right away. It was busier later in the morning while earlier, say 7:30 am it was pretty empty.\\n\\nService was friendly and quick. The restaurant has an upscale feel with marble tables and framed art on the walls. There are plenty of choices on the extensive menu so you should be able to find something for everyone.\\n\\nThe restaurant asks guests to pour their own beverages with the exception of just a few items like the fresh squeezed orange juice. There was a selection of 4 or 5 different brews of coffee. The coffee I selected was good and strong, just as I like it. I also had the fresh squeezed O.J. and it was excellent... definitely fresh squeezed and made with ripe oranges (I'm an O.J. purist and don't like pasteurized O.J.).\\n\\nMy son loves waffles and really enjoyed the grilled strawberry covered waffle (Monday)and the strawberry-banana covered waffle (Tuesday).\\n\\nI had the coconut French toast on the first visit.  The French toast was massive with good, thick, solid slices of bread.  The slices were dipped in shredded coconut and drizzled with raspberry sauce and topped with super excellent whipped cream.  We splurged and asked for the maple syrup instead of the standard corn syrup provided on the table. It is nice they have the choice of syrups though it's a shame maple isn't the standard choice and costs extra.\\n\\nI had the crab eggs Benedict the second visit which was good but not great.   There was plenty of crab. However the  Hollandaise sauce, though thick, had almost no taste. The diced potatoes were good but could use a bit more seasoning.\\n\\nOn my third visit I had the asparagus-prosciutto omelet. The eggs were nice and fluffy.  There was a good amount of prosciutto and asparagus though some of the prosciutto was overcooked and burned.\\n\\nOverall I enjoyed my visits.

I value the interior decoration highly, and it was very disappointing to see how dark and dirty the restaurant was. The waiter was extremely disrespectful and the service was unbelievably slow. I ordered the Eggless Salad, which was too salty, in my opinion. My boyfriend ordered the BBQ Chicken dish, which was dry and tough; but the corn cake, which came with his meal, was fairly good. Their soy ice cream was, however, exceptional. We ordered vanilla soy ice cream and It was surprisingly light!

Everyone was dressed well (they do have a dress code as I heard people were being turned around for not meeting the criteria) I am not sure the specifics maybe someone else will post them later. \\n\\nAmbiance - very nice, low lighting. It is a cigar lounge and a restaurant blender into one so it's pretty niche. There was a DJ mixing pretty well throughout the evening. The music volume varied, sometimes it was pretty loud with me having to yell at the person next to me other times it was at a reasonable volume for conversation. The furniture and decor is nice and modern. Clean lines, large couches. I feel each couch could hold several people comfortably. On the first floor there are several sections all with their own tables and cigar ash trays. Ok the second floor there are a few sections accompanied by a large table to seat 8 (probably could seat more if the chairs weren't as large). There is also a bar upstairs so don't feel obligated to use the one downstairs if it's too packed. \\n\\nFood - I can speak to the crispy sesame shrimp, fries and portobello tacos. The food was great and reasonably priced, it came out quickly and was very fresh. The chef did an amazing job blending the seasonings and dressings for each not making it too overwhelming. Others in my party also had the wings which they said were amazing, a few people had whole wings delivered and others had regular wings with drums and flats. I'm not sure how the determination was made as to who gets what. \\n\\nDrinks - They have a cocktail menu with about 5 - 6 drinks on it but also have a full bar. Nobody had any issues with their drink in my party and they were also reasonably priced. \\n\\nThe only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because I don't feel as if the ventilation is that great. I've been to several cigar bars although I don't smoke them I typically get a drink there and I didn't feel like there was as much circulation as I'm used to.

So, Mario's was actually my 2nd choice but having liked it previously, I felt confident I was in for a  really good dinner.\\n\\nFirst off, the rolls were very plain, nothing on them and nothing to dip them in, just plain ole butter to spread on them.  I ordered the Baked Ziti which has always been a favorite Italian dish of mine.  The menu said something about the Baked Ziti being their original and favorite dish of their customers, so I was very anxious to try it.  Well, when it was placed in front of me, I thought for sure they had given me the wrong order as it did not resemble any Baked Ziti I've ever had, but the waitress assured me it was what I had ordered.  How to describe it?  It is layered like a lasagna with the ziti mixed with cheese on the bottom and top layers and a huge mound of ground beef as the middle layer.  The tomato sauce was served on the side to spoon over the ziti.  While the tomato sauce had a relatively good flavor and the ziti w/cheese was tasty, the amount of ground beef used in the middle layer was way over the top...too, too much beef!  I'm sorry to say I just didn't care for it at all.\\n\\nMy sister-in-law had eaten at Mario's the day before and she was not happy with her Eggplant Parmesan either.\\n\\nI'm afraid next time I'm in the area, I will have to hunt down another Italian restaurant."},{"name":"Parva Colombian Bakery","address":"220 W Lake Mary Blvd","city":"Sanford","stars":"5","text":"Colombian Bakery so close to my job I love it.

I'm guessing they don't take people seriously when they come to take out the orders and would rather do the ones of the people that are sitting at the table first.

They take pride in the burgers they serve instead of giving you whatever husk or withered leaf they have at hand.\\n\\nThe truffle fries? Barely tasted like anything besides generic french fries, and barely had any parsley. I feel like they forgot the truffle oil and parsley, and we just got whatever stuck from the bottom of the pan they were sitting in.\\n\\nOh, and he asked if I wanted a receipt. I said yes. I was never given a receipt.\\n\\nI guess that's what you get when you have unionized workers and Oregonians who will blow a ton of money on a local food place, regardless of how subpar it is (hey, just like Voodoo Donuts!).\\n\\nSave your money and go elsewhere.

Today I decided to take my 2 year old son to brunch and searched feverishly for the new up and coming breakfast restaurants with good reviews. Lo and behold, Ball Square Cafe came up consistently with happy customers.  Being in the customer service industry for 15 years, reviews are a staple of my decision; so I packed my son up and left.\\n\\nI ordered the \\"Fit for a King (or a Queen)\\" breakfast with a side of eggs for my son.  The food came out very quickly, but once the server set the food on the table I didn't see her again until I flagged her down. Why did I flag her down you ask?  As I was cutting up my pancakes I found a long, white hair baked into them.  I quickly looked up from my food and noticed the kitchen staff do NOT wear hairnets or hats and do not use gloves.  \\n\\nWhen I called the waitress over, she apologized profusely and asked if I wanted another plate. I told her I wasn't sure... mostly because the pancakes are obviously made with batter and if there was hair in that pancake there may be others.  She took the dish away and replaced it a few minutes later.  By this time my son was done eating and started to make a fuss.\\n\\nAfter leaving the table, I didn't see the waitress again for another 10 minutes when I had to flag her down again. By that time my son had dropped his fork and I needed extra napkins, but I couldn't find anyone to help me. I got frustrated, decided to leave, and asked her to box up the food.\\n\\nTo my surprise, as she brought back the food she placed the full-priced bill on my table. By this time, I was hungry, my son was fussy, and I hadn't gotten to eat anything.  Infuriated, I walked up to the owner Mike and told him as nicely as possible that there was a hair in my food, hoping he would compensate me somehow. His response to me: \\"Hair happens. That's what happens in restaurants.\\"  I said, \\"Well she gave me a new plate but I didn't really want it.\\" He said, \\"Okay.

We can be a a lot to deal with all at once and he handled us well.  \\n\\nThe restaurant is nicely appointed and apparently it's \\"fine dining\\".  Listen, I'm not all about being stuffy and fru fru when it comes to food.  I like to eat, so call it whatever you want as long as the food is good.  Quite frankly,I treat these restaurants no differently than any place else.  It just lightens my pocket a bit more than the average.  However, I expect the food to be good at a hole in the wall just as much as I would expect at a fine dining establishment.  \\n\\nMy usual forray into french cuisine is a croissant at Collet in Alpharetta.  That's about as french as I get. So, when my girlfriend suggested Bistro Niko as an option, I figured it was time to give french cuisine a try.  \\n\\nThe menu was a little intimidating for me.  It was late and I was starving, so I didn't want to venture to far out of my lane and end up with something I didn't like.  I tried to stick with familiar items hoping that it would be cooked with a French twist, then I could say I had \\"French\\" food.  LOL!!! So, don't laugh...this is what I ordered: ravioli and scallops.  I really took a walk on the wild side with that combo.\\n\\nMy group ordered all kinds of different things and they enjoyed every bit of it.

No-No CAFO (confined animal feed operation) either.\\n\\nNow I can picture the hog to my plate! I am ready to lick my lips and clamp my jaws on some juicy pork.

You'll like the cozy bar with copper top, low lights and responsive, friendly service.\\n\\nWhy you should steer away from CAFO at other restaurants? Pigs living in the industrial food chain have a stressful life. The sow lives in a pen and cannot even turn around most of her sorry life. They eat garbage! Are shot up with antibiotics and hormones to fatten up and slaughtered inhumanely. CAFO pigs may carry hideous bacteria, like ecoli and C-diff--a gut flora killer that is prevalent today--google it, it's too gruesome to Yelp-out details! I do not want to picture CAFO pork on my plate!\\n\\nWhy should we support Hamlet? This is the sort of place PDX foodie-porker's crave. Good hangout in a hip area with good cocktails and a few brews to compliment delicious pork--you know the pigs lived a happy life and were well cared for--good for me--good for the farmer and land.\\n\\nNow, I digress, I get off my soapbox.

My fianc√©e and I have driven past this place many times, but tonight we finally decided to give it a chance, and it was probably the best decision we've made.\\n\\nUpon entering the restaurant, the hostess immediately acknowledged us and gave us some menus because we wanted to take the food to go. She told us to have a seat and that the bartender will gladly take our order when we're ready. As we read the menu, we looked around the place, seeing how the decor worked well for a place advertising as \\"street fare\\".\\n\\nOnce we felt ready to place our order, we went to the bartender, William, who seemed eager to take our order. We decided on Siu Yoke crispy pork to start, I decided on the Hokkien Mee (egg noodles with chicken and shrimp, sounds delicious!), while my fianc√©e got the Char Kway Teow (rice noodles with chicken breast, shrimp, and bean sprouts, yum!!). He told us it would be about a fifteen minute wait on our food, but offered drinks in the meantime, which was a very nice gesture on his part. \\n\\nAs we sat and waited, we took another look around the bar and saw the various beers and spirits they had in stock, seeing they had a few local brews. William overheard us talking and came right up to us and started talking about a few that he would recommend to us. He was overall very friendly and was able to answer all of our questions and he made us feel comfortable. \\n\\nFirst up was the roast pork. We're not really big fans of pork belly, but one bite from this was amazing! The pork was crispy, but still had a little chew from the fat, which we didn't mind at all. It went very well with the hoisin sauce that it came with. The Hokkien Mee was impeccable, the sauce used to finish the noodles was by far the best I've had. The Char Kway Teow my fianc√©e had was also delicious, but it could have used a little more sauce. \\n\\nOverall, this place deserves the 5 stars. My only complaint- though the menu has many tasty options, it's only limited to rice, salads, noodles and small plates. I would be even happier if they offered bigger portions and entree sizes of the menu. Despite this I definitely see myself coming back very often!!

Eat elsewhere before arriving. You. Are. Welcome. \\n\\nThings to know:\\n*****\\nI. LOCATION & PARKING: Ponce City Market's main building has a smaller one adjacent to it. City Winery on the second floor of it above Sephora and Karoo and behind Dancing Goats Coffee Bar and the Google Fiber store.\\n\\nFor parking, I recommend, first, downloading the Park Mobile App and adding all your information in there. Then, I suggest entering from Ponce City Market's back entrance (right near the bridge crossing Ponce de Leon) and park underneath there. After you drive down the ramp and to the end of the deck, take a left towards the blue zone and then find a spot. Enter Zone 222 on Park Mobile, and then pay for your parking. Their parking system is a mess without it, and this location in this ramp is the least stressful and relatively close to the venue.\\n\\nII. LAYOUT: The City Winery, from what I remember, has a gigantic central dining space, spacious main bar, and huge patio on the entering floor. Their basement is where their concert venue is. What I love about it is that it's where patrons can dine while watching a show.\\n\\nMost recently, I saw (and met) Les Nubians (7/13/17) aka two women have who have some of the sexiest voices ever created. (And they own that French soul genre.) They did a two-three hour show and slayed. Oh, and if you do catch a show downstairs, the acoustics deserve fifty eggplant emojis. The venue did their performance justice, and it helped make it one of the most memorable shows I've ever seen.\\n\\nIII. FOOD & DRINK: Like most yelpers, for the price, I didn't find their food justifiable. I tried both their *Wild Mushroom Flatbread and *Cornmeal Crusted Wild North Carolina Trout.\\n\\n*Wild Mushroom Flatbread: w/ arugula, mozzarella, parmesan-Reggiano, and truffle, it was decent. It would have been better if the chefs didn't douse the dish with truffle. It was a good try, but I would order something else. ($16)\\n\\n*Cornmeal Crusted Wild North Carolina Trout: w/ wilted spinach, bourbon gastrique, and crawfish hash, it was hearty, and the trout was soft, but I don't know if I would get it again, either. ($22)\\n\\nIV. DRINKS: Vino-phile? Then you'll love this place. They have tap wine, which is fantastic. Whether it's a glass or carafe of wine, they have everything from Sauvignon Blanc to Pinot Noir. I tried a glass of their Kaya Vineyards Chardonnay 2016, and I thought it was buttery smooth. ($11) \\n\\nThey also carry bottled wines. (How could they not?) I will have to corral a group of friends together sometime to split a bottle under Sommelier's Selections. Shoot, he or she has an kickass job.\\n\\nV. SERVICE: I had no problems with the host or server who helped last night. If they have any kinks, I didn't see any!\\n\\nVI. PRICES: I did not think the quality of the food met the prices, but I did think the wines were more than reasonable. Oh, and the tickets per person to experience the amazingness presented by Les Nubians? Only $43 for FRONT. ROW. SEATS.\\n\\nVI. OVERALL: If you're too old to hit up a grimy-ass concert venue (stop stepping on my shoes please) and want to listen to fantastic music while sitting down, then City Winery, a unique venue only available in a few other major cities, is the type of place for you. It certainly is for my old ass. \\n\\nI can't wait to return!"},{"name":"Subway","address":"4729 NE Columbia Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"I went in there this morning at 8:50 AM.

Our team name is Freaks Who Drink, but I digress.\\n\\nThe service at this place is lackluster at best.  The very first time we went there we got great service, but as word of mouth about trivia night spread and Tramp's got more crowded on Wednesday nights, it was hard to get noticed at all by the waitstaff.  I would typically head in around 7:30 to grab a table and wait on my mates to show up for 8pm trivia start time, but I wouldn't be greeted or asked for a drink selection for at least fifteen minutes.  And if we weren't ready to order food when the server brought our drinks out, we would easily wait another fifteen minutes before the server would return to our table.  I should have taken that as a sign to not order any food at Mister Tramp's.\\n\\nThe first time we went I ordered a BLT.  For some stupid reason, the BLT contains onions.  Why the hell does this BLT contain onions?  It's not a BLOT, it's a BLT!  I specifically asked the waitress for no onions on my BLT, but guess what?  Yep, onions galore.  Sorry, but that was just a bad sammich.  Whoever thought to add onions to a BLT should be fired.  Even once I picked out most of the onions, the sandwich still stunk.\\n\\nI will say that their pizza is quite good.  I got it on two or three occasions, and it did not disappoint.

They had only two waitors but 9 full tables which seemed to be a little overwhelming for the wait staff but they worked together to make sure everyone had what they needed. No one table belonged to someone. You could ask any of the wait staff if you had a need or want. The waitor checked on us several times, provided updates on our food and drinks if there was any wait at all. I would have liked my food to be hotter but it was tasty. The cucumber salad was also very good. My one Issue is this place is pricey but the portions are large for the price. It is a resturant not take out so the prices reflect a sit down Resturant . I would have liked for the music to be louder to give it a little more of a lounge vibe. We will return."},{"name":"Chris' Caribbean Bistro","address":"4479 S Cobb Dr","city":"Smyrna","stars":"4","text":"I was craving some Jamaican food and this was nearby. Plenty of parking, great service and the food was delicious. I was a little skeptical but everything tasted amazing. The only thing I didn't like was the cabbage, way to soft and lacks flavor.

I ordered 10 piece wings last week with a regular drink, got the total and thought it sounded a bit high.  I decided not to hold up the drive thru during the lunch rush to check the receipt at the time and that was a mistake.   To squeeze more money out of me, and I'm sure many more, they charged me for (2) 5 piece wings instead of the cheaper (1) 10 piece wings.   It's not a lot of difference in price, but it is more money.   They are deceiving their customers to squeeze out as much money out of you as possible.  To make matters worse, they put the wrong sauce on the wings rendering half the order inedible.   I tried reaching out to Zaxbys in an effort to make things right, but I was completely ignored.  It has been a week and nothing.   My plan was to await a response before deciding to post a review.   Since they don't care enough to reach out and attempt to make things right or at a minimum apologize, here's my review.   Avoid them if you don't want to get overcharged and then get an inaccurate order.

There are also some mocktails in the menu, for children or anyone who doesn't want alcohol, but the feel of a cocktail.\\n\\nCapa may be a steakhouse, but also there are also small plates and tapas to go with your entrees. My wife and I started with the Pulpo, Croquetas, bruschetta, and Datilas. The Datilas were AMAZING, the dates were bacon wrapped and provided a savory sweet combination,  and the pulpo was their octopus, and the two pieces were nice pieces!\\n\\nFor the entree, I ordered the Ribeye steak with blue cheese on top, and my wife ordered the NY strip. The ribeye was cooked to perfection and the cheese was a nice touch on the steak! My wife enjoyed her NY strip as well, it tasted almost as good as my ribeye! The entrees are A la carte, so the sides are extra. We had the Setas (mushrooms), broccoli, and Maiz (polenta). The Maiz was the best side we had! The polenta is similar to grits and came with cooked corn on top, and my wife and I were fighting for our portions to share!\\n\\nIf you ever visit Capa, make sure you stay to watch the fireworks from Magic Kingdom, Epcot and Hollywood studios from the awesome balcony view!"},{"name":"Southern Sweets Bakery","address":"186 Rio Cir","city":"Decatur","stars":"4.5","text":"Southern Sweets has pulled me out of Yelp review hiatus!

First, I told the waiter that I liked oolong tea, and asked if he had recommendations. He picked out a specific one (which was $18). I mentioned that it was a little pricey for me, but instead of offering a less expensive choice, he said, it's worth it. I ended up choosing that one, and while I definitely could have been more assertive, I felt slightly pressured and uncomfortable. It was very good, but I'm not sure if it was worth the price. Also, I noticed that I ordered the Signature, but the petit fours I got were a mixture of the signature menu and the west coast menu.

I handed her a $10 bill and then she proceeded to take my friend's order while I began digging out additional money for a tip out of my wallet. The cashier continued to have an attitude and talk down to my friend. At that moment, I decided that this woman was not deserving of a tip by any means. I immediately requested the change from my order (2 cents) back. The cashier began to stare at me and informed me that there are no pennies in Canada and went to retrieve her supervisor to address the situation. Her supervisor essentially told me the same thing and began to cook my food. Ultimately, the issue was not resolved. To make matters worse, when I got my food, it wasn't good.

Nice upscale decor on busy Granville street.  I I ordered the Upstream Maple Benny with truffle potatoes and parmesan cheese.  The benny had some cooked salmon (thus the \\"upstream\\" reference).  It was ok.  I couldn't help but think this salmon looked like it came out of tin can!  The egg yolk was cooked well...  runny the way I like it.  Still I thought our waiter should have asked me how I want the egg yolk cooked don't you think?  My g/f likes her egg yolk on the soft side but it was a bit too runny for her.\\n\\nThe potatoes were tasty but a bit on the dry sides.  I would say the potatoes were baked... all the moisture was sucked out of them making them a bit too dry for my taste.  I think if the potatoes were fried, and some oil was added they may be less dry.  \\n\\nOverall, I would not highly recommend the Rise Eatery for breakfast/brunch...  To me... it's not really a breakfast place.  I prefer Jam, Yolks, or OEB...   Still my gf and I want to come back for lunch/dinner...  they have an interesting menu with some unusual menu items.

I have always gave it high reviews and it was the first place I would recommend to anyone looking for a great place to eat. We would normally hit this place up 4-5 times per month. \\n\\nRecently there have been changes to the menu, seating, and pricing. The menu has changed to a more adventurous flavor to include such things like quail eggs and other odd (but I'm sure delicious) selections. Maybe I just resist change. Maybe I'm not as much as a foodie as I thought. I really enjoyed the previous menu selections more - especially brunch. \\n\\nI like people. But I also prefer to eat and converse with the people I arrived with. There is now a \\"communal\\" dinning table where parties are mixed together. Ok if you are sitting down for maybe BBQ or another style of meal, but if I am going to pay say around $300+ for 2-4 people (includes bottles of wine) I consider that a \\"nice dinner\\" and don't care to share my space with others - especially hipsters. In fairness, there are other separate seating tables, but they are normally taken and the communal style tables is what appears to be open mostly on busy nights the last few weeks we've gone. They have changed out  the seats with metal arm rested patio chairs that if you are a Merican' male who does not like to cross your legs or have yoga enforced posture, you'll be uncomfortable. \\n\\nPricing has increased some what, but I was fine with it because I enjoyed the food that much. Portions have come down somewhat, but again, I was ok with it as i tried more items on the menu. My average (for two people) for brunch with mimosa averaged $85.00 with tip, dinner with good wine $175.00 with tip. So not bad in my opinion. \\n\\nSo, yeah. Not my favorite place anymore. I am a capitalist and fully support the owner and management to do what they want. They may actually have some patrons that like it and it's working for them and I sincerely wish them the best! The staff is and has always been GREAT in my opinion. That's why I have it 3 stars.

Service was good once seated.  Atmosphere was pleasant and clean, and I especially like the private booths that really make you feel like you are truly in a Japanese place.  Variety of food was great and things looked and tasted good.  It got a little pricey for a family meal, but maybe because everyone wanted something different and nobody would share.  It is located on Route 9 West/Worcester Rd. in Natick in a small strip mall on the right immediately after the Route 27 interchange.  Parking can be kind of difficult at peak times, but doable. If it's busy, drop one person off at the door to run in and put your name in, and the other go find parking.  The other businesses located in this strip mall do not command a large amount of customer traffic, so I'd say the largest amount of the cars were at Oga's, which surprised me how popular this place is and much larger inside than it appears to be from the outside."},{"name":"Newport Seafood Grill Broadway","address":"1200 NE Broadway, Ste 10","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. I came to Portland to compete in a BJJ tournament. After not eating for 24 hours and not intaking any water for 12, I wasn't too picky on where I ate and we chose this place because it was close.

We were placed outside and quickly got our drinks. I ordered clam chowder. It arrived quickly and was hot. Worst clam chowder I've ever had. This is when the service declined sharply. Our food took forever to come out. About 45 minutes. One of our guests had to wait an extra ten minutes for his food after ours had already arrived. I ordered the fish tacos. When the fish tacos did come out, they consisted of two tortillas drowning in thousand island, cole slaw that they use as a side for every dish was thrown on, and then two small pieces of fish that they obviously used from leftovers from the fish and chips basket. Terrible. Way too greasy. No one at my table enjoyed their meal. One of us ordered the prawns. They weren't prawns, just tiny pieces of shrimp that were heavily breaded and FILLED with grease. I had my water refilled once this entire time. I finish a glass quickly and would've loved to rehydrate myself after trying to make weight all day. \\n\\nIt took 30 minutes after we had finished  eating to get our check.

Almost 9 years in the \\"City Allergic\\", and many great memories.  The glory days of Delta expense accounts takes us back to the first visit ever, circa 1996 perhaps, entertaining our advertising research friends (Hall & Partners) from New York for dinner - and the New Yorkers and Brits were genuinely impressed.  Incidentally, when we first moved there, we stayed at Calibre Vinings 2 miles away for almost a year - I used to run right past Canoe on those beautiful, hilly, twisty wooded hilly streets.  AH!  Those were the days!\\n\\nFF to this June - what better place then to celebrate our milestone anniversary, with our kids than at Canoe?  After a slight snafu with the seating (taken to a table, and taken back out again, with apology), we were greeted by our server April.  Cocktails involved some tough choices.  This place is so high brow that, when it comes to sweet vermouth - forget your Martini & Rossi, Cinzano, or even Noilly Prat - those are for the great unwashed.  Here, they only have Carpano!!  He's the dude credited with inventing this concoction back in the 18th century.  The modern day wine made supposedly from his old recipe costs about 3 times more than the afore-mentioned \\"peasant\\" varieties.  Truth be known - while it was a nice diversion if drunk on the rocks (for my wife), in my Negroni, it was a bit of a distraction - a touch too floral and overbearing, instead of the perfect balance that a Campari-gin-vermouth is supposed to be.  That said, I STILL haven't met a Negroni I don't like.\\n\\nWe ordered 3 apps to share, but only 2 made it to the table - between going out in the last fading dusk light to take some pictures and too busy enjoying the other two, none of us called out the missing smoked salmon.  The crab cake ($16) was good: fresh lumpy chunks of crab, good size for an appetizer (maybe not for $16), but I'd say I've had at least equally good ones elsewhere; the mussels ($13) on the other hand - they were out of this world.  Perfect app to share as well, with delicious fresh bread for the dipping.  If I have to do it again, we might order two of those instead.\\n\\nThe wine list here will blow your mind. You may need help from the sommelier if you don't know your wines.  I decided to settle for a tried and true and not be adventurous - plus, a Hall '08 Merlot at $50 is some attractive price point!  We had the same that I paid retail very close to $30.  Our entrees were all wonderful.  For once, a duck dish did not disappoint, but my wife (bless her) didn't love it so much that she didn't share.  Our daughter's slow-roast rabbit had just a remarkable flavor to it.  My quail was stuffed, which may explain why it didn't look like quail at all (more like the size of a grouse!), but it was exquisitely blended with the side dishes.  Just orgasmic fare all around.  I mean when a lamb loin was arguably the least remarkable (our son's main course), that's saying something.  This chef and this kitchen has a lot going for it.\\n\\nWe ordered a half cheese course before dessert - delightful cheeses, but too tiny a portion for eight and a half, and I took a small issue with the order in which they recommended the tasting.  Then came dessert.\\n\\nThe chocolate grotto was fine, but you know what - just cut to the chase and get that ice cream sundae thing with the popcorn.  OMG - talk about a perfect ending to a perfect day.  Hope we won't have to wait 30 years for the next one!"},{"name":"Anh Hong","address":"291 Adams St","city":"Dorchester","stars":"4","text":"An absolute delight.

I'm often surprised at how good food can be at these little nondescript places.\\n\\nNow, before you rush over here, just remember to watch your step when you enter the shop as there's a small step down that's easy to miss. On my first visit, I ordered the Lamb Gyro ($6.99) which is served on tikka naan bread unlike their donairs that are served in a pita. This wrap includes lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, and sweet banana peppers along with the slices of spiced lamb meat. The gyro was creamy from the sauce and I liked the grilled naan bread that it was served in... overall, a really good gyro.\\n\\nI returned for a revisit to try their Chicken Kebab Platter ($11.99) which is a large serving of salad, rice, and potatoes. The tender spiced chicken was quite good and the meat wasn't dry (which is often a problem I find with chicken kebab platters). There was a pleasant aroma when they brought this to my table and the hot sauce was really on point.\\n\\nThis platter also comes with a serving of grilled pita bread and a crisp salad with a tart vinaigrette. There's a lot of food in this platter and it's quite filling. Normally, I'm not into eating a lot of potatoes but the lemon garlic potatoes (which are cut super thick) turned out to be really good.\\n\\nIt was another 4 months before I returned here (but I'm not sure why). I remember that I enjoyed their gyro last time (which is served in a grilled naan bread and served taco-style) so I ordered the Beef Gyro. Similar to my experience with their lamb version, there was crisp lettuce, tomato, onions, tzatziki sauce, and hot sauce which was held together within the naan bread.\\n\\nHaving had their gyro twice, I figured I should at least try their donair... specifically, the Chicken Doneras ($6.99) which is very similar to the gyro but served in a pita wrap. They have a number of different donairs but this is one of their standards with just meat and veggies on the inside. Compared to the gyro, the pita wrap is slightly thinner than the naan but easier to hold and eat.\\n\\nI'm not sure why, but on all of my visits, this place was relatively quiet."},{"name":"Houston's Restaurant","address":"3321 Lenox Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I had eaten at Houston's in other cities before nearly 10 years ago.  I was a little but surprised to see that the menu really hadn't changed all that much in over 10 years.  Another reviewer said Houston's in one word would be \\"consistent\\" so I guess that would ring true with keeping the menu all these years.  \\n\\nI'm not sure I agree with the \\"complimentary valet\\" at lunch time, as if you're doing me a favor when I have to make sure I have cash on me to tip the driver.  Add to this the fact that during this time of day, everybody is trying to get back to work at the same time and there is a long line of people all waiting for their cars to be pulled-up by the 2 drivers on hand.  This little service is much like the dudes who sell soap, gum and cologne in men's restrooms.  Totally unnecessary and way over the top...in a bad way.\\n\\nHouston's always has a great ambiance due to the way they keep the lighting down low.  It's usually always crowded as well, giving it a sense of energy within the calmness of the cool lighting.  The Buckhead location was no different.\\n\\nI did notice something on the menu that was odd.  There are 2 different chicken sandwiches that are listed, one on top of the other.  If you look at the ingredients, they are 100% IDENTICAL sandwiches.  The only difference is that one has lettuce and the other has arugula.  Can't this just be listed as one item with your choice of either lettuce or arugula?  I'm just saying, maybe you can use the extra space for a new item, perhaps?\\n\\nMy wife ordered the crab cake special, which happened to be the most expensive crab cakes we've ever ordered anywhere on earth, ever.  At $31, these 2 regularly-sized crab cakes should have been served on a solid gold plate with an attendant to wipe your mouth for you between bites.  She did say they were delicious and made with all crab, no filler, however.  I ordered the French Dip sandwich and it was really quite yummy and very good quality meat, but even this was pricey at $17.  For a sandwich?  Yep, for a sandwich.  After the two glasses of Bergstrom Oregon Pinot, the final bill came to $80...for lunch!\\n\\nOverall, they do a good job with service and the food is pretty tasty.  If they could just lose the valet service for lunch and lower their prices to just above reasonable (instead of outrageously higher than reasonable), we might be coming back a lot more often."},{"name":"Fellaship","address":"110 Centennial Olympic Park Dr, Ste 102-104","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"hands doen my favorite place to smoke!!!!! i have travelled the world ,and smoked in many lounges,however fellaship is by far the best place i have ever been. what can i say to describe this place . classy,friendly,amazing,fly,sheik, etc!!!!! now that damn lobster is the devil lol i had 3 orders. also ask for the liga privada bourbon infused cigar. best smoke in the house!!!!!!!"},{"name":"Southern Proper","address":"600 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"3.5 stars is about right. \\n\\nAmbiance is lovely and very curated.

The grapefruit beer was delicious and fruity and light. We enjoyed that.  As for the food we opted for the platter as it had everything we wanted to try.  We also tried the potato pancake.  We had to send that back because it was extremely salty.  Not sure if they took that off the bill.   The best was their crispy pork, that was to die for. I highly recommend that and I would definitely order that again.  The pretzel was just Ok for me. I have had better pretzels and the cheesy sauce that it came with was not necessary.  Take out the cheese and charge less for pretzel.  Miss print on the price, menu price is $19. Should be $11 instead.

It was my first time at City Winery after months of hearing all my friends talk about how wonderful the place is. After having a live music experience of my own I can finally agree with them that this place is truly one of the best venues to have an intimate concert in Atlanta. The sound system was great and I had really good seats but even walking through out the venue as the artist were performing I could hear the music very well. The concert area is downstairs in the main restaurant and winery is upstairs. The sound does not spill over into the restaurant upstairs. \\n\\nAlthough the sangria is seasonal and was not available on the main menu, the waiter offered to make me a red wine sangria from scratch. It was tasty he had absolute confidence in his bartending capabilities. My only wish was that he had written down the ingredients so I can come back or another one in the future!\\n\\nFor food I just got something very light to eat I was not very hungry for a big meal. Recently I've been obsessed with brussels sprouts so when I saw them on my menu I had to order. They did not disappoint! The brussels sprouts were perfectly crispy yet soft in the middle.

I've been on many occasions for dinner &/or drinks but I wasn't inspired to write a review until my most recent visit. \\n\\nWe went on a Thursday evening at ~9pm & the place was extremely busy. Let me begin by saying, the food was phenomenal - but there were some hiccups before we got to the meal. \\n\\nSomething seemed amiss when the usually accommodating hostess engaged in a verbal tug of war with another employee about where to seat us. We were eventually escorted to a small table for 2 in the main, very crowded dining room. Several minutes after being seated, our server came & took our water order. Pause. This is when we should've ordered - everything!! But of course we had barely looked at the wine list, let alone the food menu! \\n\\nWe hardly saw the server all night, unless he was scurrying across the room to tend to other tables. We had to flag him down to place an order or ask for bread. At one point I got his attention & motioned for him to come over - he came to the table next to us, picked up their check & darted off! I understand it was busy & he was overwhelmed, but get help! Ask another server to deliver a drink, a bus boy, a manager - something! The manager at the least should've checked on us. It was very out of character to have such inattentive service at a Buckhead Life establishment. My date & I were on high alert the entire time, wishing we had eyes in the back of our heads so we could spot our server & get his attention. Really unacceptable. \\n\\nNow for the food & wine - outstanding! I ordered the day's special, lemon sole beurre blanc with capers & saut√©ed spinach. The portion was very generous & the fish was perfectly executed. Lemon sole is one of my favorites & this may have been the best I've ever had. It was light yet filling, not too lemony & not too buttery. We started with a salmon croque Monsieur & it was amazing as well!! I love a croque Monsieur & had never had a rendition with salmon - so decadent, so delicious! I could've eaten this alone but I had to save room for my entree. My counterpart had the boeuf bourguignon & he enjoyed the classic dish, but we both agreed the lemon sole was the winner! For dessert, I had the creme br√ªl√©e & it was the perfect sweet finish to a delicious meal. \\nOrdinarily I would've knocked more stars for the abominable service, but I think it was an off night as they're usually more attentive.

In any case, inside or out, you'll find yourself one party of many at a large long picnic table. The atmosphere reminds me of a cross between grandmas basement and a bar in Europe- rustic and homey. \\n\\nThe tap wall was very impressive even though I generally don't drink beer- I can't because I'm gluten free, and yet try had the largest selection of gluten free beers and coders I've ever seen on a menu- I think they had about a dozen between their standard beer menu and their seasonal beer menu. I ordered the beat box; not sure what was in it but it was delicious! \\n\\nAs for the food it was easy enough for this experienced Celiac to navigate their regular menu, but once I started asking questions they brought out their gluten-free menu. I had never heard not imagined some of the possibilities when it came to their sausage selection but I stepped out of my comfort zone and ordered the currywurst and it was incredible! Never thought that was something I would eat or say I loved! Just a touch spicy, I didn't care for it with the curry ketchup. It came with a side of fries with garlic aioli.

BUT if they also control your staff, especially BOH (\\"back of house\\" for you non-industry folks. It means the kitchen) then the product will suffer. Banquet chefs and breakfast grill tenders are not like regular line cooks in their approach or motivation. They have less skin in the game, and that lack of focus on customer satisfaction will inevitably show up on the plate.\\n\\nAnd it's contagious. FOH (you guessed it: \\"front of house\\") staff will get tired of customer complaints that will impact their tips. Often they become surly, numb or uncaring, and jaded over time.

The server comes over with the usual \\"awhatcha- wan?\\" Under muffled silent exhaustion because under Flames' employee handbook, you are only allowed to speak several decibels higher than the sound a butterfly's wing makes. \\n\\nI answered his \\"awhatcha-wan\\" with \\"can I have a medium plate with rice and peas?\\"And stopped there because if you go too fast, they'll be annoyed and roll their eyes and ask you to repeat (with attitude of course).

Ended up going here looking for a big breakfast, not realizing it was more of a hangout place.  \\n\\nYou order up at the counter, have a seat, and wait for them to bring it to you.  We ordered a lot.  Way more than the average customer at a place like this.  Most people are there to grab a cup of coffee and work on their screenplay or something.  My girlfriend and I were there to stuff ourselves.  \\n\\nWe ordered a couple of the small plates.  One was similar to the Starbucks egg bites but way more fresh tasting.  Another dish was called the Breakfast in Bed and was a flaky, buttery puff pastry crust stuffed with bacon, spinach, egg and cheese.  Both dishes were really great.  \\n\\nMy girlfriend got the Belgian Waffle and enjoyed it immensely.  I got the goat cheese and fruit salad with a raspberry vinaigrette.  That was really good as well.  The goat cheese contrasted nicely with the sweetness of the fruit.  I only wish the salad came with a bit more dressing.  If I had asked for more I'm sure they would have been more than happy to give me some, but it really wasn't a big deal.  Still loved it.  Also ordered the Avocado Toast... because why not.  That was super tasty as well.  The bread they use is really good quality and had a nice crisp to it.\\n\\nAnother big selling point to this place is the coffee.  They have really creative flavors.  I ordered the Columbian Yominson Trujillo, which had a nice hint of Dark Chocolate and Pomegranate to it.  Wasn't overpowering though.  I also got the Decaf Columbia El Tablon.  That had chocolate sauce, caramel, and a Belgian Waffle flavor in it, but I really didn't taste much other than coffee.  Either way, still a good cup of joe.  \\n\\nI couldn't leave this place without trying one of their signature lattes.  They just looked too pretty.  I got the Fall Spiced Latte and it was pretty awesome.  Blows the Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte out of the water in my humble opinion.  \\n\\nOverall, this place was not at all what I expected.  Still, I was really pleasantly surprised.  The employees are all insanely friendly and accommodating.  The food is way better than it should be for a coffee shop where most people aren't even eating anything.  The drinks are really fun and creative.  The seats are really comfortable.

The only downside was that the beef was a little fatty, but once I trimmed it away - it was pretty much perfect: tender and flavorful. \\n\\nPad Thai - one of my favorite dishes on any Thai menu, but I'm kind of a wimp when it comes to spices. I noticed the chili pepper marking on the menu, and asked our server how spicy it was. Recognizing my hesitation, our server told me that the spice could be toned down to mild, which really made my day.

My friend had the chicken and waffle, and others in our party also had chicken fried steak and some sort of Elvis French toast situation. \\n\\nMy meal was, yep, bland. While the steak looked great, all breaded and crunchy, none of it had a hint of flavor - not the steak itself, not the breading, not the gravy. The hash browns didn't appear to have been salted or peppered at any point in their lifetime. The only good part of the meal was the small cup of fruit that I'd paid $2 to swap out the eggs for, which was probably the best decision I'd made because I'm sure the eggs would have been dead bland too. (Also, can we please stop with the surcharge on substitutions? A cupful of chopped fruit is not more expensive than two eggs. Stop.)\\n\\nMy friend and I had the garlic and pickled veg Bloody Mary too, which was - you guessed it! - bland.

Usually I go to Publix and grab something that I feel is more reasonably priced and move on with my life.  However, this time I was going outside of the box and decided to purchase a sweet treat for my BF in preparation for a birthday celebration that was taking place later that day.  I went inside and chose a slice of Red Velvet Cake.  I wasn't interested in purchasing an entire cake.  While I do admire sweets, I try my best not to overindulge.  Then again, maybe I'm just cheap.  Anyway, There were other options, but the Red Velvet Cake looked so inviting. So I got one of those, and it came up to $6.37.  The slice was huge, so it was worth the money in my opinion. It actually was like getting 2 regular uncut slices or 3-4 slivers for those of us who are just trying to keep our sweet cravings (aka dives off the deep end) at bay. Anyway, we both enjoyed the cake.  I had just a few bites and couldn't believe how delicious it was.  He had several more bites and said he really liked it.  I will definitely be going back (not really for me, per se), but for other special occasions that require desserts.  I would really like to try the vegan options the next time I go.  It also seems that for lunch they have some sandwiches or something.  Because I was on a birthday cake mission, I didn't have time to check that out, but maybe next time if/when I happen to be in the area during the lunch period time frame."},{"name":"Zorba's Greek Restaurant","address":"115 East First St","city":"Sanford","stars":"4","text":"If you find yourself needing a reason to drive out to Sanford; Zorba's alone is worth the trip. I know you don't think of Italian food when entering a Greek restaurant but their pizza is something else, literally. I don't know of any other spot in central Florida that not only makes a Greek style pie, but then also executes it so perfectly. \\n\\nI had the opportunity to speak to various people there who tell me the cook makes the dough from scratch every morning so that if they run out for that day; you're unfortunately out of luck, nothing is frozen. Their pizza is so popular that if you already know you want to order it, you should call beforehand to make sure they haven't sold out already and that is actually what happened the first time we visited, we drove all the way to find out they were sold out, but the second time around we were fortunate enough to try that along with their garlic knots which were absolute heaven! Look at the picture I posted and tell me you don't want to devour the entire plate, you hungry yet?\\n\\nTo keep it somewhat healthy, I ordered a small Greek salad before my meal, very simple, but that Olive oil used in their homemade dressing was just something else, very good quality and very delicious.\\n\\nDuring both my visits everyone was super friendly and accommodating, food always came out promptly, and delicious.

I had never had lobster from the hibachi, but it was definitely a welcome addition. \\n\\nHowever, since everything is cooked together, I think I'll just stick to my usual steak and something else option.

It's kind of like watching these home chef cooking contests where for some reason there's a chef who has never cooked meat, and yet somehow they win the episode. The optimist in me says, \\"Incredible.\\" The realist in me thinks, \\"That was rigged.\\" So, when people rave about a restaurant, I reserve judgement until actually tasting the food myself. \\n\\nAnd some restaurants do live up to the hype. S&I Restaurant is a fantastic Thai place in Allston that is your typical dive with amazing food. Lime Leaf Restaurant in Weymouth is another, and Craigie On Main in Cambridge sits atop its own gastronomic apogee.\\n\\nPho and Rice in Somerville is a place I've frequented often. Chef Bobby is this cherubic and smiling guy who is hands down an amazing chef. When he's cooking - and especially if he cooks a special dish that's not on the menu - all the crappy, overseasoned, and MSG-laden versions of East Asian cuisine which we've all experienced far too often fades quickly into the background. What remains fixed in the foreground is how good his food is.\\n\\nMy friend suggested to go to his other restaurant in Melrose, and he said that it's small with very limited seating (i.e. 5 small tables). The way he described it, I was prepared to walk into a place that was kind of dark and dirty but had great food. I was wrong.\\n\\nI walked into a place that was bright and airy and despite its diminutive seated section, the place has been very tastefully designed. There were 5 of us, so we occupied 3 of the 5 tables, and then we decided to go nuts and have Chef Bobby just keep sending plates out until we were ready to burst. \\n\\nIn many ways, it was like those Ancient Roman feasts where the whole goal was to keep bringing out more and more shockingly amazing dishes to wow the crowd. Okay, so unlike those ancient feasts of gluttony, they didn't bring out the fully roasted pig where the moment you cut into it a bunch of doves fly out. No joke, they did that kind of craziness back in Ancient Rome.\\n\\nWhat happened was one of the most mind-blowing eating experiences I've ever had. It started with steamed gyoza (pork and vegetarian) and rapidly escalated to the Som Tum salad, Tom Yum soup, and then a massive number of dishes appeared, including the best Chicken Gra Pow I've ever tasted, an amazing stir-fried pepper rice noodle dish that I've never had anywhere before, and a beef curry dish where the meat tasted had this amazing consistency of soft butter. There were other equally amazing dishes, but I have no idea what they were because Chef Bobby just unleashed and was sending out all sorts of stuff. \\n\\nAll five of us were stunned because we've eaten a ton of Thai food, and we've all eaten at his Pho and Rice Restaurant in Somerville. But the food at this restaurant is on a whole different level. \\n\\nWe didn't try any of the Vietnamese dishes because when you know that the chef can make amazing food that he grew up with, and that it would be impossible to try all those dishes in a single sitting, then why waste a dish ordering something else?\\n\\nHow good was it? Well, by the end, we probably went through 15 dishes, and then we ordered two orders of the Chicken Gra Pow and two orders of the Beef Curry because they were that outstanding. \\n\\nSeriously, it was like eating the Thai version of Craigie On Main Restaurant, which along with a place in Wellesley that I'm not going to name because it's already way too busy are my two favorite restaurants. So, now I have the gustatory trinity of restaurants with the addition of The Bangkok Thai & Pho to the group. \\n\\nThis place is a must-try if you like Thai food.

The weather is lovely and the flowers are in full bloom left and right at there. Even though living at Walton on the Chattahoochee affords me a great view of the river, I enjoyed Canoe's view greatly because it presented the calmer side of the river. You are also surrounded by vibrant azaleas among other flora. There's also a path that leads you to a sitting area near an outdoor fireplace and a small garden. It's all very charming and picturesque. The outdoor space also has a small bar space which hosts live jazz music on Wednesdays. \\n\\nBrunch is very popular at Canoe. According to our server, Kevin, Canoe's busiest shift is perhaps the brunch shift. Reservations are highly recommended. I would make a reservation through opentable and earn some points while you're at it. \\n\\nWe were there for dinner on a Sunday evening. I am incredibly impressed by their menu.  Although there's a whole gamut of meats to select from, Canoe is well known for their game meats dishes. The pheasant dish is one of the restaurant's popular entrees. Even though the menu is seasonal ( it changes 4xs/yr), the pheasant dish has been on the menu 14 out of the 17 years Canoe has been operating. You don't have to worry about small pheasant bones because the white meat is presented in cutlets and the dark meat is used to make 2 croquettes. It's served with sweet potato puree and spinach. The pheasant was incredibly tender. It was very good. \\n\\nThe rabbit dish is also very delectable. I have never had rabbit before and was hesitant to try it, but I'm so glad I did. The meat is quite similar to chicken, but more stringy and has a stronger flavor. It was served with bacon ravioli, which was amazing! I tried to dissect the ravioli to pinpoint the bacon flavor, but all I found was chard. How...the...h...?? The lamb portion was smaller than the pheasant dish, but it was as equally filling. \\n\\nTheir appetizers are equally worthy of ravings. I tried the warm \\"Artisan Cheese Salad with Bacon, Baby Spinach, Golden Raisin and Wheat Berry Vinaigrette\\" and the \\"Marinated Golden and Red Beet Salad with Whipped Vermont Goat's Cheese, Candied Walnuts and Basil Oil\\". Both salads had a beautiful and artful presentation. The Artisan Cheese was served warm. It has a multidimensional taste. It's rich and creamy, and not too bold. The beet salad is not a traditional salad. It's a layer of pickled beets atop some really creamy cheese. I think a picture is more helpful than my description.  \\n\\nThe servers also brought us a selection of bread to pick from. There was olive bread, sourdough bread, cranberry bread, and jalapeno flat bread. There weren't served warm. My favorite was the olive bread and the jalapeno flat bread. Oh the the butta; it was incredibly soft. \\n\\nThe service was great. Our server, Kevin, was attentive and helpful. Even though he's relatively new to Canoe, he was very knowledgeable about the establishment; citing noteworthy things about Canoe, including the flooding of the restaurant in 2009. If you look at the brick walls, there's a white marking to show how high the water flooded the restaurant. \\n\\nBecause it was Daniel's birthday, Kevin presented him with a very indulgent treat. It was the \\"Chocolate Grotto with Salted Caramel and Pretzel Dust\\" presented on a dish with Happy Birthday in chocolate writing. After you crack the chocolate, caramel goodness oozes out. How did they make this dessert?! When you order this dish, you'll know what I mean. How did they manage to put the caramel inside the chocolate dome? AND HOW CAN YOU MAKE CHOCOLATE LOOK AND TASTE LIKE THAT?! It's magical. \\n\\nThe servers here wear collared shirts tucked in dark jeans.

The real star, of course, were the sausages but they ran out of most of their \\"exotic and wild game\\" so that was a little disappointing. We ordered the smokey & boar, drunk chicken, and jalapeno cheddar bratwurst. All three sausages were delicious, my favorite was probably the drunk chicken because of the Serrano peppers and caramelized onions. We ordered honey blonde beers and it was exactly what we wanted, really light and refreshing. \\n\\nHere's why I wasn't blown away with Banger's: we waited over 45 minutes for three sausages. Service left more to be desired because our waitress didn't check up on us and was nowhere to be found. We went at 9:30 on a Thursday night, so I can't imagine what it's like on the weekends. Indoor seating was pretty packed but it didn't look that hectic outside (where most of the seating is) so not sure why it took so long. The noise level was incredibly loud. I usually don't comment on those kinds of things, but I could barely hear what my friends where saying and they were sitting right next to me. \\n\\nOverall, Banger's has a fun atmosphere and it's a great place to go with friends. Although the food was good, the wait is keeping me from returning right away, it's like I've had my fix for awhile. I'd recommend going a little earlier (but after 6pm so you can snag that free parking, there's a lot just down the street). I think Banger's is more fun at night anyways 'cause...well, it's Rainey Street."},{"name":"Dino's Brick Oven Pizzeria","address":"389 Lowell St","city":"Wakefield","stars":"3","text":"Cheese slice is very salty; couldn't finish it.

She reminded me of the nice service and managers that have made things right at times when we have dined in. Tonight we got take out. Not so good IMO. In deference to Nan I should say the chicken Picatta she got she liked very much and the portion was nice. Lot of fettuccine which is always great. I wished I had gotten that. She will have a small lunch tomorrow. (Unless I hit it first haha). Not cheap at $16.99 but if it's good and plenty, it's worth it. I'll say the minestrone soup was very tasty we actually split that. \\nOk here we go with the negatives that dragged the score down. I had the 4 cheese ravioli and was disappointed that the entree barely covered the bottom of the take out container and for $13.99 and not coming with a side I wasn't pleased. Only 7 raviolis so $2 per is just nuts. Not a fan of the tangy marinara either but maybe you would be. I won't have to be reminded to never get this again. Thumbs down on ravioli.  I may take the advice of a few Yelper's here and stick to the pizza in the future should we order again as that is really the best thing about Betucci's. So as bad a value as the ravioli was the Tiramisu while delicious at $6.99 please can I call it $7 was a very small portion thereby making it grossly overpriced. \\nIn conclusion we weren't feeling like dining out and we weren't cooking so this seemed like a decent option.

I brought my appetite (didn't eat lunch haha) and two others to help me eat through the menu. The Jubilee Tea Set and Finger Sandwiches I would order again, but the Fortune Tea Set not so much. \\n\\n--- Finger Sandwiches ---\\n- Wow! The presentation was stunning, and the ingredients of such delicate selection. They were small enough to be essential two-bite sandwiches, the sandwich filling held at the bottom by a firm circular piece of bread. The most beautiful piece was the egg sandwich with the carefully cut quail egg on top. Too pretty to eat! (But I ate it anyways haha).\\n- There was quite a large chicken bone in the pesto sandwich (large relative to the small sandwich, maybe the size of your thumb to the first joint). I was a bit surprised at the presence of a bone. Considering the prices, it's expected that the high tea experience be no less than 5 stars. Our server brought us a replacement sandwich, which was bone-free. \\n\\n--- Jubilee Tea Set ---\\n- I loved how the combination of the characteristics of each item balanced really well and were strategically placed on each tier. I'm no high tea snob, but I guess you eat from top to bottom? \\n- Top tier - savouries: Wagyu slider (heavier) and the salmon confit with panna cotta (lighter, citrusy). The salmon was so light, and the citrus burst of the panna cotta provided a much needed contrast to the slider. \\n- Middle tier - savouries: the miso cod was so delightful. The fish is superbly melt-in-your-mouth, and enhanced by the caramel-infused tea.  \\n- Bottom tier - sweets: The maple eclair and red macaron were the standouts. \\n\\n--- Fortune Tea Set ---\\n- Croque Monsieur: this was not that special, I wouldn't order it again (and not worth the price). It's essentially just a ham and cheese sandwich (sure, with fancy ingredients but still...). I would totally go for the finger sandwiches instead - so much more variety, unique ingredients, and with a much more stunning presentation.  \\n- Salad: the sandwich was served on a bed of a variety of greens. It was a nice balance to the heavier ham and cheese sandwich; however, the vinaigrette was too sour, in my opinion. I also found a little bug (that was alive...) \\n- Macarons: Matcha, Earl Grey, and Lemon Bush Tea were our surprise selection, and they were great. I especially enjoyed the lemon one - there was something really special to it that was not only lemon but other citrusy-type flavours - I guess from the Bush Tea.\\n\\n--- Beverages ---\\n- Tea: I don't drink tea or coffee (shocker, right?), so I have no palate for a good tea vs a bad tea. It smelled really good though!\\n- Orange juice: freshly squeezed oranges! My niece didn't like this (\\"this orange juice tastes BAD!\\" *makes a face*) le sigh there goes $8 haha. I guess she likes the Artificial Minute Maid stuff better - kids these days haha. I, on the other hand, quite enjoyed the juice she took 3 sips of.\\n\\nBesides the chicken bone in the pesto sandwich and bug in the salad hiccups, the rest of the high tea items were presented beautifully and were bursting with many unique flavours.

At the time of writing this review, Umi is in my top three sushi restaurants in Atlanta along with Sushi House Hayakawa and Taka Sushi.\\n\\nCo-owner Fuyuhiko Ito is the head chef. Before Umi, Chef Ito worked at MF Buckhead. Fitting in with the Buckhead neighborhood as an upscale restaurant should, Umi is trendy and stylish, even a bit pretentious, but it's not as excessive as MF was. It's simpler and more intimate. Book reservations on OpenTable. If it's just you or you and one other person, I suggest requesting seats at the sushi bar (must be made with reservation). While the sushi bar is nicely lit, the main dining room is very dim. It's also loud.\\n\\nNotable and interesting appetizers/small plates include the popular yellowtail jalapeno, monk fish liver pate, uni (sea urchin) tempura, and otoro (extra fatty tuna) tartare with caviar. There's a limited selection of soups (e.g. osuimono - clear broth fish soup), salads, and cooked dishes including rock shrimp tempura (popular), baked lobster tempura, and foie gras. Expect to spend about $15-20 per appetizer and $20-30 per hot entree.\\n\\nThe sashimi and nigiri are where it's at. Surprisingly, Umi doesn't stock as many different types of fish as I thought they might. The variety isn't as wide as Hayakaya or even Taka. However, Umi's inventory is still respectable and the quality of the fish the sushi bar does stock is phenomenal. You can taste a difference in even the most basic and common types of sushi such as maguro (tuna), sake (salmon), and hamachi (yellowtail).\\n\\nSome of the more unique sushi offered include live scallop, anago (saltwater eel, not to be confused with the more typical unagi, which is freshwater eel), shime saba (pickled mackerel), shima aji (striped yellow jack), mirugai (geoduck clam), chutoro and otoro (medium and extra fatty tuna, respectively), uni, bincho maguro (or shiro maguro, seared albacore tuna), kanpachi (amberjack), iwashi (sardine), kinmedai (golden eye snapper), and hotate (sea scallop). Umi also offers aburi, which is seared sushi, and sousaku, which consists of non-traditional nigiri created by Chef Ito.\\n\\nI've tried a good variety of the sashimi and nigiri and have to say there isn't a bad thing on the menu here. In general, the fish is incredibly fresh and delicious. Most of the fish (not squid, clam, octopus) have buttery, melt-in-your-mouth-like properties with subtle differences in both flavor and texture, save for the saba and iwashi, which taste saltier and have a more \\"pasty\\" consistency. If you make it out to Umi, then I encourage you to try types of sushi that you can't often find such as those mentioned in the paragraph above.\\n\\nIf you like unagi, the anago is softer and mildly sweet. Umi's saba is pickled, whereas most other sushi chefs serve the mackerel as is. Some of my all-time favorites include the hotate, otoro, shima aji, kinmedai, and uni.\\n\\nSashimi orders (2-3 slices) cost about $10-25 each. Nigiri orders (2 pieces) cost anywhere from $6-22 each. If you can't decide what to get, order a chef's choice sashimi or nigiri plate (9-15 sashimi slices, 8-12 nigiri pieces, $24-39).\\n\\nIf you want the ultimate Japanese dining experience, order one of the omakase dinners. These are filling multicourse meals, selected by the chef, that include appetizers, hot dishes, sashimi and nigiri, and dessert. Umi offers three levels of omakase: Umi ($75 per person), Miyabi ($120), and Ito Kase (market price). The more expensive the omakase, the better the dishes/ingredients.\\n\\nOutside of sushi, I've tried:\\n\\n*Spicy Tuna Tartare - tuna, lychee, pine nuts, Asian pear, masago, Sriracha hot sauce, sesame oil, avocado, quail egg\\n*Madai Carpaccio - Japanese red snapper, sea salt, lemon, olive oil, yuzukosho\\n*Black Cod Misoyaki - grilled black cod marinated in miso\\n*Chilean Sea Bass Yu-An Yaki - Chilean sea bass marinated in yu-an sauce\\n*Seared Diver Scallops - soy ginger sauce with toban grill\\n*Kobe Beef Nigiri - seared Kobe beef nigiri, ponzu, green onion, garlic chips, yuzukosho\\n*Otoro Caviar - otoro nigiri with truffle soy, serrano slice, caviar, fresh wasabi\\n*Special dessert - white sesame panna cotta with green tea sauce and a black bean with edible gold\\n\\nSince I'm about to hit the 5001 character review limit, I'll be brief with these dishes. Everything is fantastic. Mix the quail egg yolk into the tuna tartare for maximum enjoyment. Yuzukosho is a spicy, citrusy paste. The cooked fish filets are amazingly succulent. The black cod is sweet and delectable. The diver scallops are served still cooking in a bowl with a blue flame underneath. When steam starts coming out from the lid, it's ready. The desserts are made by Chef Ito's wife.\\n\\nImportant: The Kobe Beef Nigiri and Otoro Caviar are must-orders. They are simply euphoric.\\n\\nService is terrific. Ask for Autumn - she is wonderful.\\n\\nValet is located in front of the St. Regis hotel off West Paces Ferry Rd."},{"name":"Ball Square Cafe","address":"708 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"Scroll to the bottom and look for the \\"not recommended\\" reviews, you will see 100 one star reviews with 100 modifying stories about the place.\\n\\nMy experience:\\n\\n1. My friend and I arrived there around 2 pm on Saturday. There were two 2-people parties waiting before me. I was told by the first waiter politely that I need to wait outside. I gladly agreed since I read about the long lines outside the cafe here at Yelp. Since we were the first party waiting outside, we stood couple steps away in front of the door, not by the window.\\n\\n3. Couple minutes later, another party came. The guy saw us waiting outside, and he went inside the cafe himself. The woman with the guy chatted with us, telling us that he went inside to check how long is the wait. We stood side by side with the woman.\\n\\n4. The first waiter came outside, and asked us to go inside -- they just seated one party, so now we are the second 2-people party, and we can wait inside.\\n\\n5. Out of nowhere, the second waiter came out, and claimed that we left the line, so now we need to go to the end of the line.\\n\\n6. The couple waiting in front of us, behind us, and the first waiter explained to him that we didn't leave. They all saw us. One thing to note is that when the second waiter was talking to us, he was deadly serious and firmly ordered us to stay outside. Though when the American young lady in front of us was trying to tell him that he made a mistake, he was much nicer and instantly agreed to go back and check with the manager.\\n\\n7. While the second waiter went back to check with the manager, the first waiter and the couple behind us (now the guy came back and naturally knew we were before them) asked us to go inside, so we did.\\n\\n8. The second waiter came back, and told us it's their policy so we have to go outside again. To this point, it's pretty embarrassing for us to be ordered to go outside twice. We might even agreed -- even though the waiter made a mistake, it would be 10 extra minutes the most. However, his attitude really annoyed us, especially when everyone around volunteered to speak up for us. He ordered us cold-faced, then turned to other American customers with a smile (I am sorry that I have to point this out, because I saw no other difference between us and them, so I don't see why he is talking to us in totally different tones). \\n\\n9. The second waiter realized that he is the only one saying different things from everyone else, he told us that he didn't make the decision, he is only passing what the manager said. So he went back.\\n\\n10. Several seconds later, the manager came out and shouted at us that we need to go outside. Then she opened the door, told the couple waiting outside that they need to come in because now they are the second party in line, and we are after them. The couple didn't move. By this time there is a line outside, and the manager went through the line to take everyone's numbers in the party, and told them an estimated waiting time. \\n\\n11. My friend and I waited by the door until she is done taking the numbers. And we were trying to explain to her that we are not trying to violate their policy. If we had left, we would go to the end of the line. The thing is we never left and everyone but the second waiter saw it. At this time she suddenly blew. She shouted to us to stay out of her way, she didn't want to hear anything anymore, and she didn't care what had happened, and it was the end of the conversation. The 2 people party before us were again trying to explain to her, but she raised her arms, making a blocking gesture, saying that stop I don't want to hear it.\\n\\n12. We followed her back to the kitchen. At the time, I told her that I didn't think it's her fault, since she was not outside, and she didn't see anything. She made her judgment based on the second waiter, and if only she would just listen to me for two seconds, and hear what everyone else was saying, she would understand. However, to my disappointment, instead of hearing me out, she raised her voice, and said \\"I am very busy. You are embarrassing us. You are making a scene. I don't care what you say. I don't care what happened.\\"\\n\\n13. One man heard us and came out from the kitchen. The second the man reached us, the manager brought a smile to her face, and lowered her voice to a normal volume. He told us that he is not discriminating against us. He saw there is a problem, and he wanted to solve it, by seating us right now and pay for our brunch. However, I couldn't care less about food by that point, so I asked the manager if he would hear me out and he would know I never left the line. I don't appreciate being ordered around and yelled at. An apology and acknowledgement of them being unnecessarily rude is sufficient. However he refused and again told us that he is too busy so he wouldn't listen. \\n\\n14. I thanked him for offering the brunch, and expressed that I don't appreciate being hassled around for other people's mistake and left.\\n\\nWeigh for yourselves"},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent food and service in this relaxed environment.

It met all our expectations and more. You really couldn't go wrong on their 2 year anniversary, all the beers they had for that day were good. My boyfriend and I ordered 6 different type of beers that day and enjoyed each pint. However, on their non anniversary days, they still have an amazing selection of beer on taps (all decently priced too!).\\n\\n[Atmosphere - 5]\\n\\nOutside seating, lights hanging from tree to tree, live music (or country music on off days), dog friendly environment, and picnic style seating makes this beer garden THE beer garden to go to. I simply love the southern charm that this beer garden has even though I don't really consider myself a southern kind of gal.\\n\\n[Food - 4]\\n\\nMost of the time, I expect beer gardens to have a small selection of food that includes your sausages, burgers, and fries. Well, Banger's has all of that, but more. They have unique sausages that were divine. I got the jalapeno & cheddar, which is more spicy than cheesy. My boyfriend got the venison one and it was divine.

The quality of the food is hit and miss.  The mac and cheese does taste like it's made with Velveeta cheese, which is not inherently problematic, but an unusual choice for a restaurant in the South End. \\n2. Be aware that there is a Kitchen Appreciation Fee tacked on to your bill.  It's a miniscule amount; however, there is no prior notice given about it so it comes as a surprise. You're expected to tip 20% and the Kitchen Appreciation Fee, as well.  This is not really a big deal, but after food of questionable quality and aggressive treatment by staff, it comes as a bit of a slap in the face to be guilted into giving the restaurant even more money because they don't pay their kitchen staff a living wage.  If you don't want to pay this fee, speak up and it will be removed.  \\n3. Inevitably, the need for comparisons arises and the elephant in the room is Darryl's Corner Bar & Kitchen (located nearby in Roxbury). Even though the product and experience both restaurants are selling is different (authentic soul food w/live singing and music vs. a mixologist's take on soul food), Darryl's has better food. If you like soul food and want an authentic experience with a fun, lively atmosphere, Darryl's is the way to go.\\n4. There does seem to be an issue with rude staff, which other reviews have noted.  Not all staff is rude; however, when I questioned the Kitchen Appreciation Fee, I was told by a staff member (short red hair, female) in an exasperated tone what it was for, then, when I asked if it was compulsory, told - loudly and in front of other customers, as if to shame me - \\"Unless you don't want to show your appreciation for the cooks and kitchen staff.\\"  When I asked that the charge be removed, this staff member threw the new receipt onto the receipt tray in anger and then walked away indignant.  I've never had an experience like this at any restaurant in Boston and am frankly shocked that the ownership would allow staff behavior to get to this extreme.  This tells me one of two things: there are larger problems with operations (quality of food, etc.) that is impacting morale or ownership simply does not care about the customer experience."},{"name":"G.

Yes, please! I was pretty excited when I heard this place had just opened up, not gonna lie. Little Sheep offers AYCE hot pot for 18.95 for a person but with a 2 hour time limit for your table. They don't take reservations for groups smaller than 6 so make sure you get there early at night because it gets pretty crowded and there will be a wait...\\n\\nWhen we arrived, we received a sheet of paper that had all of our options on there such as soup broth, sauces, meats, vegetables, baked goods, etc... For the soup broth, you can choose two styles they have a divider for the pot so we went with one spicy and one regular style. The spicy broth was not as spicy as those that I have had before was still flavorful. They list sauces on the sheet as well but I am not sure why since the sauces actually are at your table already...so that was a little puzzling. Next you select all the meats, vegetables, breads, noodles, and other stuff that you want by writing the number of portions next to the item. There's also other items that you can order for an extra charge that aren't included with the AYCE price. \\n\\nOnce you finish choosing your items, you hand the sheet to a server and they will fulfill your order. There is a meat slicing machine in the restaurant that slices all the thin meat upon order and then they bring all the vegetables, breads, noodles, and other stuff on a layered cart to your table. They leave the cart at your table so you can take items off the cart at your own pace and put the empty plates back on the cart for them to take. When you are ready to order more, you just ask your server for your sheet again so you can pick some more items. Each time you order, they give you a different color pen so they can track the differences between the orders. \\n\\nThe one pretty big miss for this place is the service. No one really ever checks up on you or explains how to do the ordering. Luckily, I had been to a very similar setup in Asia so I was able to order for our group. Also, we had to ask for own refills of water as they never refilled our cups. The worst part was that every single round of food we ordered was incorrectly fulfilled. I am pretty sure I was a vegetarian for most of the night because it always took forever to receive our meat orders and at one point we just kept telling one of the other servers that we needed meat and he directly brought us meat. It was the same issue for our baked goods as we did not receive multiple items we ordered as well as some of our food got sent to the wrong table. Somehow they never had trouble with the vegetables though... The root cause is that they don't have an established system of how to track where food goes as they just have all the sheets for every table scattered on a small wall so it ends up being very disorganized.\\n\\nLittle Sheep is a new spot and clearly it is a work in progress. The variety of offerings for the hot pot is very solid as well as AYCE for under $20. The service on the other hand is a bit of a struggle so our 2 hour time limit felt just a little rushed since we were constantly waiting on our food. Once this place figures out a system, it will be a very solid hot pot place to go to but I suggest giving it some time to let it figure some things out.

Also, it is cost effective. Cons are that it seems to take forever in the drive thru. The last time I was there I was in line for a total of 40 minutes from the time I pulled in to the time I got my food. That seems a little excessive.

I came here last night with my brother after singing their praises quite a bit. We split their supper club dinner and then got a few other items al la carte. Of the 5 dishes we had which included dessert, 3 of them were great and the other 2 were far from good.\\n\\nThe Great:\\n\\nFish Soup\\n--It had a great depth of flavor, the accompanying bread was great, and the red snapper was cooked perfectly.\\n\\nSkirt Steak Empanada\\n--This $6 item was the cheapest thing we ordered and by far the tastiest! My brother specifically said \\"I could have had nothing but that tonight and would have been totally satisfied!\\"\\n\\n--Mesquite Carrot Cake. Just like the last time I was here, their dessert was on point. I'm not a big sweets person, but both times their desserts have been so freaking good. From inquiring I found out that their pastry chef used to be the pastry chef at Qui which gives them some street cred.\\n\\nThe Not Great:\\n\\nCold Meat Plate:\\n--Was very blah. Nothing stood out as being very flavorful at all. And when speaking with a friend about my experience today, she mentioned a cousin of hers who didn't like their cold meat plate either, but who also loved their empanada. There is some consistency in our separate experiences.\\n\\nVenison Tartare:\\n--This along with the pork confit was the highlight of my last/first visit. It was definitely different this time and was completely bland. Long gone was the burst of flavor in each bite that I experienced with this dish the last time I had it.

We hoped to find cheap drinks and pool, but we were disappointed. First off, I like to drink whisky and club soda in a pint glass, the proportion of a single shot with ice and club soda in a pint glass suits me best. The bartender said, at the CI, they do not serve whisky in pint glasses, and can only serve liquor in what I call a \\"rocks\\" glass. I was confused and willing to pay extra, but apparently there is a \\" house rule\\" prohibiting this. I've never heard of such a rule before. I was dumb struck by this.\\n\\nAlso, the cramped little pool table cost a dollar a game. Now, I play a lot of pool and games go fast, so a dollar a game is an exorbitant price. We had one drink and played one game of pool and left to go down the street where pool is fifty cents a game and whisky is served in pint glasses. My guess is that the pool table sit idle most of the time. \\n\\nThe CI lost our business because they do not put the customer first and do not provide a reasonably priced game of pool.\\n\\nI'm giving the CI two stars because the service was otherwise good, lunch crowd was sizable and the place had a fun retro \\"last century\\" feel, which I liked.

I should have left it at that - inside, it's a little outdated and could use some sprucing up. The rug is really worn, and I we sat in what is the only booth - near the kitchen entrance - which looks quite romantic. Once sitting in that booth, the back of the booth has a good amount of dust on it - which was near eye level, seeing that is just not a good way to start out a meal.\\n\\nI have to say that the service was great. The host and server were both prompt, kind and overall I would say that it was pretty flawless service.\\n\\nThat being said, we went to Passport for their Gluten Free Menu, which is quite extensive online. My plus one has celiac disease - this isn't just a preference. We were so happy to see all the GF options on the menu when we looked online, we decided ahead of time on several dishes we were excited to try: on the Duck Confit Cassoulet, Mac & Cheese w/ Corn & Bacon, Cajun Shrimp & Grits and the Scallop Risotto. All these items are (still) listed on their website.\\n\\nWhen we sat down to review the GF menu, they said they had new GF menu, but it hasn't been updated yet to show what they are currently offering. Our server said she would edit the menu to reflect the current GF offerings, which turned out to be a menu with more than half of the GF options crossed off in pencil (no new dishes added); not one of the items we had planned on going for were available.\\n\\nWe landed on the following GF items: \\nWarm olives - no complaints, pretty straightforward, good olives.\\n\\nScallops with Candied Bacon - was just ok, but not spectacular, which I feel like it should have been considering we are eating two of the best foods ever. The scallops were overcooked for my liking and a bit tough on the edges - not seared quite right. \\n\\nTomato, Basil, Mozz plate - was the highlight, very fresh and delish basil EVOO combo.\\n\\nLemon Cod - Fish was so dry! it was very tough around the edges - just cooked poorly. The lemon was mild and barely there, and the rice that came with it was bland - I think it was supposed to be risotto, but it was lacking flavor.\\n\\nOverall, I just wouldn't be able to go back. We were so disappointed about the \\"new\\" GF menu, their website is really a misrepresentation of what they offer.  Then the food we did have continued the disappointment. \\n\\nWhile I do realize that it may take some time to update online menus- it has been over a month since our trip to Passport, and the menu still lists all the GF options that they did not have available."},{"name":"Mission on the Bay","address":"141 Humphrey St","city":"Swampscott","stars":"3.5","text":"If it's food that is the reason to go out to eat , then this is your first choice.

On dot avenue.\\n\\nService: waitresses were attentive and friendly.  We asked for things and it came out ASAP.  Best service I've received at a viet establishment and this is coming from a. Guy that has been eating /5 Vietnamese restaurants since he was a kid.\\n\\n\\nFood:  my friend said the 7 courses of beef was what he always got here so we went with that.\\n\\nFirst dish that came out was the vinegar beef.  2 platters of thinly sliced beef and a mini pot skillet in the middle of the table with vinegar. You throw the beef in. While it cooks, you prepare the rice paper by dipping it in water, adding some vermicelli, and adding all the accoutrements provided.   When it's done, throw it on the roll and wrap it all up. Then dip it in the sauce (pungent sauce that might not be for everyone). \\n\\n\\n2nd course was butter beef. 2 new plates of thinly sliced beef once again were brought out, but with lemongrass sugar and fish sauce this time.  The hot plate was switched with a plate with butter instead. Again you cook it yourself.  My friends said they liked this one the best.\\nIt was slightly sweet, fatty, and savory.  Once again you make the roll the same way. I didn't dip this in the sauce though. I thought it had enough flavor as is.\\n\\nThe next dish was basically a beef carpaccio and ceviche style dish.  Thin slices of beef cooked in marinated in lime juice so it cooks slightly on the outside. It came with peanuts on the dish so ask for no Peanuts or let them know about your allergy.  You eat this by squeezing more lime on and throwing it straight into your mouth. Pretty refreshing after the butter beef.\\n\\nNext came the 4-6 items. One was finally chopped, almost ground, beef encased in a Vietnamese herb. I liked this one the best. Slightly smoky and rich. The meat was still juicy. You eat this by rolling in the rice paper with vermicelli and herbs.  The thee beef dish were rolls of beef with whole \\nblack Peppercorns stuffed in the middle and what I believe were charred (purposeful) onions too.  This was slightly bitter and again was eaten like the vinegar beef. The last item on the plate was a steamed beef meatball with mung bean noodle mixed in. This was eaten with shrimp crackers.  \\n\\n\\nThe last dish was a beef Congee. This reminded me of the congee my dad makes. Simple but tasty. It had chopped beef through it and slivers of ginger.  My favorite dish along with the beef wrapped in an herb leaf.\\n\\nCost: $60 total for 3 of us including tip\\n\\nVerdict:  this is good stuff.

I've heard for so long how nice this place was (in fact, years ago, I can remember a rather delicious steak dinner). That's over now. They can keep this place. \\n\\nAs the hostess was taking us to the main dining room, I could tell right away we were in for some trouble. A group of roughly 20 people were sitting at three tables RIGHT AT the entry to the main dining room. They looked like they were almost through dinner, and sounded like they'd had more than a few. The hostess put as at a table directly behind them. I guess this is where I should have said something and asked for a new table, but I thought they were on the way out and it wouldn't be a big deal. \\n\\nThe waitress came over and took our drink orders. I decided to go with the lobster ravioli as a starter. Bread is on request; it's a sun dried tomato type roll with very little flavor, and only some actually have the sun dried tomato. \\nThe table right next to us got louder. Mind you, this isn't a private party in the back or something--these people can be seen (and heard) from the entire main dining room and parts of the bar. I noticed an HP shirt on a couple of them. Great. I knew it was a work deal; it's the only explanation for such a motley crew. I'm not sure if this was before or after the ravioli came out, but in the meantime, we were treated to the musical stylings of some gargantuan man with zero self awareness who decided to start singing songs from the 70's loudly and proudly. The petite blonde next to him joined him, and they did a little jig. Much to the delight of their coworkers, who were the only ones who thought any of this stupid bullshit was entertaining. \\n\\nThe ravioli came and it was a \\"meh\\" event. I hate using \\"meh\\" but I can't think of any other way to describe it. The pasta was tough on the edges and there was way too much sauce on the plate for the portion (4 large-ish raviolis, but swimming in sauce). The lobster filling was watery in some, but better in others. I ordered the Cobb salad for my entree, as it sounded so good on the menu and I wasn't into anything too rich tonight. My brother only wanted a large Caesar. \\n\\nFor the next 25-30 minutes, we stared at our dirty dishes and I fielded work emails while the loudmouth asshole next to us started to get liberal with the profanity. Keeping it classy in public I see. I have a foul mouth and a raucous personality, but I also have manners when at a restaurant. \\n\\nThe table of 20 were receiving their desserts, and we hadn't seen a thing. Our waitress also seemed to be MIA. No one so much as acknowledged us for the entire time. FINALLY, sensing our discomfort, the waitress reappeared and said that the entrees were delayed because of all the desserts that had to go out. Oh, fine. Wonderful. Not only do these drunk techie bastards have to ruin the ambiance, they get to hold up our meal. She asked if there was anything she could do, and asked \\"Would you like some more bread?\\" No, I wanted my salad. I told her we were feeling a little ignored at the table and she said it'd be right out. I said that was fine. \\n\\nFive minutes later, someone I assume would be the manager came out to serve us our salad. The table behind me was still as riotous as ever. He, too, apologized for the delay and asked if he could get us more bread. No, I don't want any more of that fucking bread. What I want is for my food to come out on time and for loud obnoxious groups of twenty to be put in an inconspicuous part of the restaurant. No one who came after us sat down on either side of us. He acknowledged it was loud and asked if we wanted to be somewhere \\"more isolated\\". NO, I didn't want to isolate, and it was too far into the meal to justify a troop movement. I just told him no, and he walked away. \\n\\nThe Cobb salad didn't make up for anything. As I was bumped by a man behind me who was now walking over to the loud man behind me to give him a hug, I realized the Cobb salad was bland and unremarkable. This was literally a Cobb salad I could have made at home with a Fresh Express bag and some crumbled blue cheese. The chicken was dry and tasteless, and there was exactly one bite of avocado. I've had a better Cobb Salad at Chili's, and I expected NXNW to be at least a step above that. No dice. I finished half of it. \\n\\nFinally, the table behind me was leaving. I turned around to make sure, and a previously unnoticed guy from the work table gave me a snarky little salute and a wave goodbye. I wordlessly mouthed 'Fuck you\\".

EVER.\\n\\nBought the Easter egg hunt brunch for three which was $120. They said they would have an egg hunt for three age groups at different times. We showed up five minutes early for ours and discovered they'd already started... They'd also included older kids from the other age brackets, who were much faster and stole the fun (eggs) away for all the younger kids. Apparently these same kids had stolen more than their share of the golden-egg grand prizes sitting out in an unmonitored basket; and since no one remembered Event Planning 101--always bring more than you think you need--many kids lost out on the prizes they'd earned.\\n\\nAfter at least six other families and their crying children came asking what the hell happened, they assembled a consolation confetti-egg hunt. Luckily most kids didn't know the difference, but they missed out on all the eggs with actual prizes in them. They did at least refund the child's admission ($24).\\n\\nNext was the actual dining experience. We saw our server twice throughout the entirety of a three-course meal, and had to remind him to bring each item on the fixed menu well after he should have (appetizer after ordering our main course). We waited at least 45 minutes after the main course before complaining we've yet to be asked which dessert we were having, only to be told they were out of the one (of four) my fiance ordered. Only once did someone take drink orders. The food was nothing to write home about. The lack of service was very disappointing.\\n\\nAt the end of everything, when we went to leave, the voucher for 2-hours of free parking (part of the package) scanned with zero funds. Thoroughly convinced they wouldn't deliver on ANYTHING they'd promised, we didn't bother going back to complain, and paid for the parking just to get out of there.\\n\\nI will never go back there, this was the most disappointing experience I have ever had."},{"name":"Bertucci's Italian Restaurant","address":"95 Washington St","city":"Canton","stars":"2.5","text":"Mike the bartender hooked it up!

There are SO many options for the hotpots you can make it contain almost any combination you could possibly think of.

Leroy and Lewis is a food truck. My friend and I just sampled another bbq spot so here we shared a plate of 2 meats and 2 sides. Our meats: beef cheek and pulled pork, our sides: barbacoa taco and frito pie. The plate also comes with potato bread that was unremarkable and a beef bbq sauce that wasn't too sweet and perfect for the pulled pork. The pulled pork was good but nothing special and was even a little dry so it was hard to eat without using the sauce. The beef cheek was very peppery and just absolutely melted in your mouth. It was my first time having beef cheek so I'm not sure if melty goodness is characteristic of cheek or if it was just very well made. The barbacoa taco wasn't bad, the jalapeno salsa I dont remember it being too spicy for me but it definitely had a kick. It also had a bunch of cilantro and onion on top. And finally the Frito pie, not sure why it's a thing but it's Frito chips with chili and cheese.

The buffet on the weekends is among the best. It's not an impressive looking business from the outside but don't let it keep you from coming in. It's a family run restaurant and there's usually the same workers each time. The food is good for the price and the buffet is a good sampler if you aren't sure what you want. \\n\\nI like the buffet because this is the best value. It has plenty of vegetarian options. The menu specializes in Hyderabadi cuisine, in north India. It usually has some biryani and samosas. The chapati bread was fluffy and moist. It is also fairly priced at about $9 for all you can eat. The menu is available for the rest of the week. It has the same items on the buffet plus many others. The spicy items there are actually spicy. The eggplant is creamy and spicy. It has knowledgable staff and they can help you choose. There are only a few employees there each time so the service is kind of slow. If you're ordering take out then call ahead. The inside was pretty clean the last few times.  \\n\\nI think Reethika should be among the best Indian buffets in Columbus. It has a lot of choices for vegetarians.

The food is delicious and always has something original about it. For example, the fried rice has an umami taste (probably from white miso or something) that I just can't find anywhere else. Each dish is delicious, perfectly seasoned and served in a stylish, sleek and modern plate or bowl. The decor is simple and modern, which works well with the silverware. The kitchen is right next to the seating so you can smell the dishes cooking, which is a mouthwatering experience. If you are looking to eat \\"healthy\\" (aka low cal) try getting shrimp skewers or chicken skewers as well as some type of soup (I recommend Tom Yum).\\n\\nCons: It's small, so get there at a time you know will have fewer people. \\n\\nConclusion: This Thai Cookery has amazing food but a tiny amount of seating.

I've heard great things about it from many different sources and it won the Best of Orlando for best Chinese restaurant in 2018. Why has it taken me so long? I'll never forgive myself, because this place was absolute perfection. \\n\\nIt's about a 30 minute wait for a table for two, not bad. We get seated and inquire about the menu. The server says everything is good, and I suspect she might be right. I got one main dish and four small plates. This was also the only place that I've ever seen with a sake flight. That's a unique thing. Keep that in mind. \\n\\nThe main dish I got was the Pad Thai (rice noodles, shrimp, chicken, eggs, bean sprouts, carrots, spring onions, red chili pepper, roasted peanuts, lime). Everything was very umptious, and the bean sprouts and carrots helped ease up the richness of everything else in the dish. Delicious. The peanuts were also crumbled up more finely than I'm used to, so there were more peanuts in each bite, but it wasn't an overwhelming amount of peanut. You'll see. \\n\\nSmall Plate 1: Korean Twice Fried Wings (garlic Gochujang sauce, peanuts, sesame, cilantro). I didn't get a strong taste of gochujang, so it's not actually spicy, but the flavor was good, strong with sesame. Super duper crispy, If you like your wings crispy, get these immediately. \\n\\nSmall Plate 2: #DimSumCrunchyBalls (shrimp, pork, crispy spring roll batter). This was the weakest dish, but it was still good. The shrimp and the pork were formed into a solid mass, like a dense crab cake, and fried in strings and strings of batter rolled into balls. It was very interesting. I'm a fan. \\n\\nSmall Plate 3: Roti Canai (Malaysian flat bread served with a side of our signature curry sauce). This was kind of like naan, but less dense, more light and airy. The sauce was heavy with curry taste. I couldn't get enough of it. Order extra roti, though, for $1.50 each, because a lot of what you eat will have some extra sauce left over that you can sop up like a tortilla. You'll thank me. \\n\\nSmall Plate 4: Singapore 'Chilli' Crab (national dish of Singapore, soft-shelled crab, house-made chili garlic sauce, fried bao bun). This was the best dish of the night. The crab was fried to perfection and the sauce was so flavorful. It wasn't spicy at all. It was very rich with chili powder and garlic and deliciousness. This is what I sopped up with my roti, after I ran out of the fried bao bun. \\n\\nOverall, I over-stuffed myself trying to try everything I wanted on the manu, and I still left like a dozen items unordered. This makes it to where I have to come back very soon. The food and the atmosphere, right in the heart of Mills 50, makes this place a six star restaurant, but alas, I can only give it five."},{"name":"Chris' Caribbean Bistro","address":"4479 S Cobb Dr","city":"Smyrna","stars":"4","text":"This place is by far the best Jamaican food I have had since living in GA!!!!!

I took a few photos. Our server was really nice and was very attentive. She didn't know a lot about the food but she told us that she doesn't normally work there, that she helps out when they need someone, so I understood she might not have learned about the food and maybe they had someone not show up or sick or something. \\n\\nThe food was hit or miss. We started with Empanadas, they didn't have a lot of flavor and they tasted a little dry. They came with some like salsa to put on them but I think they really needed a flavorful sauce. So that was something I would not order again. Next we got the the meat and cheese board, which was great, came with pickled veggies and nice toasted bread and I enjoyed the cheese and meat selection (Raw Cow Milk Cheese).  Would get that again. We then ordered Plantains and the street corn. The plantains were awesome, they came with an avocado aioli which was so delicious! Really want to get these again. The street corn is served off the cobb, it was good but not a strong flavor, not something I would get again. And finally we ended with the Pork Belly over scallion pancakes. This seemed like it would be great, but there was a flavor that didn't go well with the dish, like a sweet and sour that should not have been there. I actually couldn't finish this dish. So wouldn't get that again.\\n\\nI would go back but I feel like this is the place where you have to know what to get or you will be disappointed.

Absolutely delicious sauce, crispy fries piled high, strongly recommended if you visit. \\n\\nI wanted to try the peanut butter caramel cheesecake, but the meal left me too stuffed to make an attempt on it.  Maybe next time (as there will definitely be a next time).  If I had any complaint, I'd say the service was a little slow and the prices a little steep, but they were packed to the brim, so I can't really fault them on either.

They were ok, not something I would order again.\\n\\nThe desserts were downright awful.  Every time I have ever had creme brulee, it was in a shallow dish so you got a lot of the caramelized sugar with each bite of custard.  This was a deep dish of custard with a BARELY caramelized top.  Really icky.  But the chocolate tort was even worse.  It was rock hard, like it had just been pulled out of the fridge.  It was more like having a truffle than a torte, no soft center. \\n\\nIt's pretty depressing when the highlight of your $70 dinner for 2 was the two scoops of ice cream accompanying your dessert.

You'll walk in, choose your base (rice, lettuce, a combination of both, or a flatbread); add your protein if desired (grilled shrimp, grilled chicken, or grilled portabella); and then add your flavor. There are six choices for flavorings: \\n- Chile Citrus BBQ\\n- Apple Curry Peanut\\n- Tahini Cucumber Feta\\n- Chipotle Mango Avocado\\n- Sweet Soy Sriracha\\n- Buffalo Buttermilk Blue \\n\\nI opted for a half-and-half (i.e. lettuce and rice) bowl topped with grilled shrimp and the Chile Citrus BBQ flavor. The portion was quite nice - more than enough for a simple lunch, especially with a side of sweet potato chips. I tossed a little extra heat into the mix by adding jalapeno vinegar (offered on the condiment stand).

Like most people, I get to pick my favorite restaurant to eat at on my birthday and for the past four years, that has been Hawkers. To someone who loves food and a whole lot of different foods, there is nothing better than a restaurant with shareable plates that encourages the over-ordering of food to ensure you and your table guests get to try a myriad of items every time you go. The only downside to this type of ordering style is getting enough people together to really be able to order as much as you want to order. Doesn't ever stop me - I always order at least six dishes whether it's just me and a date or there's five of us at the table! There is nothing that I've had at this location that I wouldn't get again and I have most definitely tried everything at least once. I guess if you aren't super duper hungry or if you eat with moderation (boring!), you could order a noodle soup, or noodle bowl, or rice bowl and still get the great experience of all of the different flavors Hawkers has to offer. If this is your first time, you MUST get the roti and order extra because it will be gone as quickly as it's set down on the table. (The dessert roti is scrumptious too!)

I live nearby and occasionally walk my dog down Rainey so we sometimes observe, it's usually busy and seems like a nice place to hang out, they even have a fenced in dog park in the backyard.  Today it was raining so no one was outside, however,it looked packed indoors.  Since they don't allow dogs inside I opted to put in a to-go order.  The experience here started well but gradually declined due to breakdowns in service, execution, and expectations.  In the end I felt a bit underwhelmed, especially for the amount of time and money I had spent. \\n\\nThe Highs:\\n- I'm greeted by a very nice hostess who brings out a menu and patiently goes over some of the popular items as well as her faves.  She was sweet and also ran in to grab a waitress to come out and take my order.  \\n- The waitress is also patient with me as she also offers me her feedback on some of the sausages, I end up making my decision and go with the Antelope + Venison, Duck + Bacon + Fig, and the Chicken + Spinach + Sun Dried Tomato.  I'm figuring they're 8 bucks (no sides included) a piece so they gotta be good.  \\n- The waitress asked if I wanted something to drink (yes), she took my credit card and came back w/in a few minutes w/ my receipt and a tall glass of water.  Total = $28.56, and even though it's to-go I tip her $5 for the effort and service.  Grand total for 3 sausages:  $33+.  Pricey but I'm still anticipating these will be unique and excellent\\n\\nThe Breakdowns and Declines: \\n- A few minutes into my wait I get phone call and start talking to my friend.  I soon check the time elapsed on my cell, 25 minutes have passed (!) and I haven't seen anyone since - - no follow up or anything.  I've been standing out there w/ my dog on the phone waiting for nearly a half hour.  \\n- I opened the door and ask the hostess what's going on??  She's surprised and runs to the back to check on my order. \\n- Couple of minutes later a guy comes outside (empty handed) and asks \\"are you the one waiting for your order?\\".  YES!  \\"Well it's done but have you settled on the bill?\\".  YES!  He has to go back to get my order - - why not bring it with you in the first place?   My waitress (who got a respectable to-go order tip) put in my order and neglected to follow through on the service.  Thank you, and you're welcome. \\n- He leaves and doesn't come back, and 2 min later I see him add an extra handoff step (and delay) but giving my order to the hostess and telling her to give it to me.  She came outside and gave me my order and apologized for the inconvenience (she felt bad). Total wait time - - 35+ minutes.  Sweet.  \\n\\nThe Icing on the Cake: \\n- I get home (2 min walk) and open up the large styrofoam containers and I'm a bit perturbed, 3 sausages but not all consistent in size and smaller in comparison to the sausages I've had at the Draught House, Sprouts, and Whole Foods.  Okay, but how do they taste? \\n- Chicken was the best, the garlic aioli had no garlic in it and was more like plain mayonnaise.\\n- Duck + Bacon + Fig = I didn't get any of the bacon, it didn't taste \\"exotic\\" tasting by any means, did not meet expectations.  I will not order this again. \\n- Venison + Antelope = tasted very mild, I've had venison so I know the taste but didn't get any of that on my palate.  Underwhelming and I will not order this again. \\n- All sausages were lukewarm (barely), probably from sitting on the counter longer too long.  The buns were not fresh at all, somewhat stale as if they were sitting out all day in the open.  Disappointing.\\n\\nBottom line:  If I'm paying a premium price then I would expect overall premium quality - that means customer service, execution, and the menu.  As for the portion sizing - if they want to skimp like the franchises to stretch out a few extra bucks then that's their deal, it's simply meat on a bun and they're doing very well for themselves.  Yes I know it's the 78701 and they gotta pay the rent but I expect to be wowed as opposed to 3 small + mild + bland + luke warm sausages  w/ stale bread and a leadtime of 35 minutes for a grand total of $33+.  The sausages I've had at Sprouts and Whole Foods tasted better at half the price with excellent customer service.  1-star wouldn't be a fair assessment, but 2-stars (I've experienced better) accurately fits the bill.  \\n\\nThe Jury is still out, and since we're neighbors I'd like to get along and have an amicable r-ship, and maybe this was a Murphy's Law moment for them.  As of right now I can't say that I would recommend this place to my friends, but to be fair I would likely tell them to proceed with caution with no expectations.  Even though I saw several other sausages I was eager to try I'm definitely not motivated to go back anytime soon, yet I don't think they'll miss me either (especially the dude who came out and asked if I paid - - I think I scared him.  Yikes!).

More so, none of the staff came by to see if we were doing okay or to let us know that maybe there's some difficulty around getting our order ready.

When we tried saying that we would just like our entrees, skip the apps as we needed to head out, the staff became agitate, somewhat rude, showing attitude, and it seemed to just completely ignore us. \\nWe finally got our entrees and might i say for a pasta dish at 20$ per entree, the dish was just disappointing.

No. The waitress (who I think is one of the owners) offered to \\"add more beef to it\\", or \\"make another dish\\" but I was so turned off by what I'd gotten I couldn't even THINK about eating any more.

Overall, the food and service were great. However, there were some issues, like the pile of dirty dishes that were there before I arrived and never cleared. There was an annoying fly, but I think that was primarily due to the dirty dishes. It also bothered me that the restaurant score was an 89. I don't normally eat in places where the cleanliness is questionable, but the bathrooms were clean, the price was lower than other restaurants in the area taking into account the amount of food, and I was getting hangry.\\n\\nI got the medianoche sandwich, which came with fries. The fries were so delish and piping hot that I didn't need ketchup. The pork in the sandwich is seasoned with Papi's special sauce. I was picking up and devouring every morsel that fell out of the sandwhich. It was that good. I LOVE the artwork. It really adds to the ambiance. If their restaurant score improves and their tables are clear of dirty dishes, I'll definitely be back.

All of them for under $6 each and they will fill you up. I like the Shepherd's pie a lot. I'm not an European food expert, but nothing says comfort food like mashed potatoes with chunks of meats covered with gravy and cheese on top. \\n\\nYou can pair all these delicious happy hour food with refreshing German beers. A pitcher for $12.50 that's a mighty steal. If you are a cocktail lover like me, go ahead order the \\"Love for Sale\\". It has Absolut mandarin vodka in it and the taste resemblance the Orange Creamsicle soda drink. \\n\\nOur server was very friendly and gave good suggestions on their menu. I love it when delicious food, tasty drinks, and good service combined together and make a perfect harmony. Hip Hip Happy Hour indeed!"},{"name":"The Rise Eatery","address":"3121 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Made a reservation on Saturnday afternoon for 7 at 630pmÔºådid not expect to be able to attain our seat but there wasn't any problem.  We got thereÔºåthe atmosphere was very chill & trendy.  The waiters were really helpful &friendly.  I started to order the items after bookmarking this place since we were all sharing.  The first thing that came was the Heart attack Rice bowl. The rice was perfectly cooked & seasoned and comes with a perfect poached egg and chicken strips.  I believe it was 8 or 9 bucks for the bowl.  The portion was about 2-3bites for the 7 of us. ÔºàRice bowl was meant for my son but we couldnt resistÔºâThe portion was perfect amount for a cocktail bar.  We also ordered a pinot noir EX Nihilo. I highly suggest this select since it had a good kick at every sip.  The bottle was $33 which I can still pay for*  I also ordered a large pint of pale ale and it was very refreshing!  The belly to belly was my favorite dish that eveningÔºåthe meat was perfectly smoked and the meat was super tender n well presented.  My 2nd favorite was the asparagusÔºåI have never had asparagus like that and I think more ppl should. My 3rd reccomendation would be the salmon! Really tender salmon with a crust of seasoning topping the salmon that made it sweet and savoury at the same time.  Unfortunately I must talk about the downs as well.  FirstÔºåI did not see the wheel of sweet horderves on the menu anymore but I asked the waiter if its still avaliable and it was.  I was told that it was all chefs selection and we couldnt choose any selections for the wheel.  I continued to order it with a higher expectation I guess.  When it cameÔºåthere were 8pieces of 4 selections with 2 each.  It was 2 heated macaroonsÔøΩ? blueberry cheese cakesÔºåand 2 other that I didnt try.  The wheel was cool but its not worth $35.  2ndlyÔºåthis may be my personal opinionÔºåthe tuna ceviche or the tartare was pretty flavourlessÔºåit wasnt salted nor zested enough with acidity.   LastlyÔºåwe ordered both the uni squid ink pasta and the other rice noodle dish.  They were both really well presented but still lack flavour and sodium.  These are purely my personal opinion so its my thick taste buds talking.  OverallÔºåI will definately visit again!ÔºàNot bringing son next timeÔºâThe restaurant sits at the end of busy granville street where your going up towards King Edward.  They really tries to present their food well and tries for better customer service! Its got a nice bar alsoÔºådefinately going back to try their cocktails! cheers"},{"name":"Tutto Bene","address":"7291 SW Bridgeport Rd","city":"Tigard","stars":"3","text":"I have never bought into the whole panini craze and have up until recently avoided the overly trendy practice of smashing a sandwich flat with a hot surface.

It came with the green tea waffle, green tea pocky, Mochi, condensed milk, and green tea ice cream but they didn't have anymore of the ice cream which resulted in me getting coconut. I wasn't really a fan of the Mochi or pocky but the waffle had the right amount of crispiness on the outside and softness in the inside and the coconut ice cream was refreshing with the coconut flakes mixed in.

It's in a strip mall on Pharr Rd. flanked on either side by the Atlanta Fish Market, Aqua Bistro, and Taka Sushi.  The cafe is cute and cozy.  Brunch is a popular option.  Lunch and dinner are served as well.  A limited selection of from-scratch baked goodies are available inside a glass display case (e.g. cakes, tiramisu).\\n\\nThe restaurant is named after the wife of the husband-wife owner-chef duo.  The restaurant interior consists of a single, almost-office-space-like room.  Decor is simple and minimalist -- white walls, white curtains, white paper tablecloth, etc.  Atmosphere is intimate and casual.  Sidewalk patio seating is available.\\n\\nThe brunch menu is filled with items like pancakes, waffles, and eggs in different forms (e.g. omelets, eggs Benedict).  Soups and sandwiches are the specialty at lunchtime.  Dinner consists of various house specialties like shrimp and grits, chicken enchiladas, steak frites, and house-ground meatloaf.  The menu can change often.  I visited for dinner where the price for starters/salads were in the $7-10 range, entrees in the $10-18 range, and sides $3.50 apiece.  Check out my photos to see a sampling of the dinner menu.\\n\\nThe owner-chef was accommodating.  The salads (Greek, spinach, Caesar) looked good, but I only wanted a side portion.  I asked the server if a side salad was available and she said no.  However (and I didn't ask for this), the server asked the chef if he could make a smaller portion of one of their salads and charge me as if it were a side.  It wasn't a problem.  Well that was nice of them!\\n\\nI had the Caesar salad which came with garlic croutons, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, romaine lettuce, and Caesar dressing.  The salad was light and refreshing.  The lettuce was crisp and the dressing and shredded cheese were tossed and mixed together well.\\n\\nSalmon Pan Poele ($18) was my entree.  It looked and tasted great.  The presentation was superb.  The plate consisted of sauteed salmon, garlic spinach, portobello mushrooms, asparagus, and a citrus beurre blanc (white butter) sauce.  The mushrooms and asparagus were overlayed in a crossing pattern with spinach in the middle and the salmon fillet placed on top.  I was asked how I wanted my salmon cooked (that doesn't happen all the time) and I chose medium (recommended).  The fish was fresh, tender, and flavorful, as were the other ingredients in the dish.  The beurre blanc sauce helps.  The entree was filling and relatively healthy.\\n\\nI also tried a side of the Brussels sprouts.  These came with bacon bits and puffed rice along with a side of Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc mam) and Sriracha spicy sauce.  The server and the chef delivered the dishes.  The chef described the sauces as \\"nuoc mam\\" and Sriracha.  I guess \\"nuoc mam\\" sounds more exotic and appetizing than \\"fish sauce.\\"  The Brussels sprouts portion was generous.  The sprouts were roasted and the exteriors crispy.\\n\\nComplimentary bread and olive oil are given to each table.  The bread was made from scratch and baked in-house.  It was super soft and fluffy.  It also had a lot of flavor baked in.  I couldn't put my finger on it, but there were definitely some seasonings or perhaps cheese in the bread.  It was tasty.\\n\\nThe group I ate with enjoyed all of their dishes, from the shrimp and grits to the chicken burger.  Generally, the dishes felt homemade with personal touches.  As mentioned previously with the salmon, nice presentation.\\n\\nOur server was friendly and the chef came out to check on us along with every other table in the restaurant.\\n\\nParking is free inside the strip mall's parking lot as long as you are going to Joy's.  Otherwise, it costs money.

So if you want a show with your pizza that is the place to go. My rating for them, pathetic would be an improvement."},{"name":"Ebisu On Robson","address":"827 Bute Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"The only reason I'm giving Ebisu on Robson one star is because most of the food we ordered actually tasted okay. The two of us came here for happy hour around 4:20 PM and were seated promptly. Only two other tables were occupied so we kind of expected faster or even better service. We were given menus but no water were given until we asked the server for them. One of our plates had scotch tape on it. I wasn't too sure why that was but just those two unnecessary errors just turned me off. Service was also horrible and I will elaborate later on.\\n\\nWe ordered an order of brussell sprouts ($5.99), mango roll ($6.99), vancouver roll ($6.99), spicy salmon roll and chopped scallop roll ($7.99 for the two rolls), and spicy tuna sashimi ($6.99). I was disappointed at the brussel sprouts because they were poorly made. They were not crispy and were extremely salty. They gave us some sort of vinaigrette  to go with them but I avoided it because it was already super salty. The Vancouver roll was literally a california roll with a piece of smoked salmon on top. It was okay but nothing outstanding. However, I did enjoy the mango roll. Although it was also a california roll except topped with masago, mayo, and mango, it actually tasted good and refreshing. \\n\\nMaybe I am used to the stringy texture of tuna but their spicy tuna sashimi was very soft and mushy. By their appearance, the pieces definitely did not come from parts of the fish that would \\"melt in your mouth\\". As a result, I didn't even know what I was eating, and at $6.99 for only a handful of unknown substances, I would not recommend this dish. The chopped scallop roll were stuffed with chopped scallop and it wasn't drenched in mayo, which was good. Okay, the best dish out of all that we ordered was probably the spicy salmon roll. It isn't your ordinary spicy salmon roll. Aside from the basic, you also get some spicy salmon on top of each roll. Addition of chopped green onions enhanced the overall flavour. This roll probably saved Ebisu in this review.\\n\\nAs mentioned above, service was just terrible. I thought we would get some service at a downtown restaurant but I was wrong. It was close to nonexistent. There was absolutely no interaction between the server and us. The restaurant was so quiet that we thought the server would at least try to make an effort to come to our table and make sure everything was good. Unfortunately, we experienced none of that. My cup was refilled once when it was literally just a cup of ice waiting to be melted. The server took away only half of the empty dishes but not the other ones. We weren't sure why she didn't just take all of them since she had a tray with her. The only time she smiled was when I asked for the bill, maybe she really wanted us to leave. I was quite surprised at the tip option they had on their machine: 15%, 18%, and 20%. Given the service I experienced, they absolutely did not deserve any of that. Not even a simple \\"thank you\\" or \\"enjoy the rest of your night\\" was heard at the end of our dining experience. I would give this place a 0 star if I could but that spicy salmon roll deserved a recognition."},{"name":"Bertucci's Italian Restaurant","address":"475 Winter St","city":"Waltham","stars":"3","text":"Very low quality in terms of how this location makes their food.

When I moved to Olympic Village I figured I would try it out. \\n\\nMy first time out was just strange. It was like the staff didn't want to serve me, or didn't see me even tho I sat at the bar. Complete lack of urgency and awareness. The food was very inconsistent. Sloppy overly sauced baos, with little meat. The lobster salad roll was almost entirely spinach (which I don't mind) but there was maybe one ounce of lobster. When I told the server/bartender, she said \\"oh\\" and then continued with what she was doing. Later I ordered the wings. They did have a nice breading, but there were only 5 of them in the order. Strange number for an order of wings. Upon biting into the first one, it was very raw at the bone. I don't mean pink or a bit red, I mean basically bleeding. That time a manager was there and he said \\"wow\\" and took them away (before I could get a pic, oh well). He comp'd me a crab meat bao ... yuk, very salty and heavily mixed crab meat, no lump.\\n\\nThe next time I had the tuna stack. Nice presentation but again little tuna, and it was very flat overall, lacking seasoning and acidity to balance out the sesame oil and avocado (I asked for a couple lime wedges for a DIY solution). Some Yuzu or tamari would have been ideal I think\\n\\nThe third time I came in sat down and ordered the house white, after waiting about 10 mins. Bartender couldn't find her wine crank, so I asked about a couple other wines at which point mid discussion she became distracted and said \\"hang on, let me take this table's order\\"... table of 4, with lots of questions, and just left me there. Still no drink. Then upon returning behind the bar she tried to open the bottle with a wine crank, and didn't know how to use it. Screwed it in and just started pulling, instead of using the crank, perhaps she had never used one or seen one used. She then proceeded to the kitchen  order window to ask one of the cooks how to use it, and he too was just pulling on it. Good grief Charlie Brown! She then again became distracted and started looking at order chits and discussing them with the kitchen guy.\\n\\nThat was enough for me after 15 mins in a place with only about 10 customers... so much for my Sunday lunch at Boa Down.\\n\\nPS, do NOT get the oysters"},{"name":"Mikado Revolving Sushi & Hot Pot","address":"8371 International Dr, Ste 60","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I've eaten here 2 times.

As always, we ordered a ton of food last night. We got the dumplings, twice fried wings, beef lettuce wraps, some crab dish, duck and pork belly baos, and four different noodle bowls. Everything was absolutely delicious with great flavor. If you like crispy wings with lots of flavor, these wings are for you. I typically don't like fried wings but I can't deny how yummy these are. The lettuce wraps have always been a favorite item of mine. While I usually order the duck, I went with beef last night and omg so good! Again, full of flavor and the lettuce was very fresh. The noodles were the pad Thai, beef haw fun, some curry rice noodles, and another that I forget the name. They all were very good with their own spices and flavors. My favorites were the curry rice noodles and the beef haw fun, but really and truly they are all so good. There are peanuts in many of these dishes so be weary if any allergies. I recommend going with a group of friends and ordering a bunch of the small plates to share and taste everything."},{"name":"CAVA","address":"515 Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Love a good build-a-bowl.

The harissa has some kick!\\n- 1 protein: seasonal roasted veg medley of brussels sprouts, carrots, squash, cauliflower were cooked just right- not too mushy, not too raw\\n- Top it off: no limits and they are all good!: pickled onions, cabbage slaw, tomato + cuke salad, kalamata olives, cauliflower quinoa tabbouleh, cucumbers, feta, spicy pickled peppers, sweet carrots + currants. You only get a bit of each, but all together it fills the bowl\\n- Dressings: yogurt dill + red pepper chickpea make a nice combo.\\n- Pita on the side nothing special\\n\\nThe end result is a large, filling, healthy, colorful bowl.

I thought it was very odd that a tea house wouldn't offer the normal platters of finger sandwiches, cookies, scones, etc... 3. There are NO substitutes and you cannot change anything on the menu AT ALL.

It might not seem a lot of sushi on the belt, that is bc they want to keep those fresh. The server did a good job of reminding us that we can order off the menu and you should definitely do that. They will make a whole roll based on your request, but only give you half, leave the other half on the belt. That is a brilliant idea. If you don't like it, it's only half and other people get to try it as well. They have the biggest selection of sashimi I have ever seen in Japanese restaurants (normal stuff + lobster, sweet shrimp, albacore, and etc). It might seem a bit pricy at first, but once you see their food quality and choices, you'll know every penny is worth it. \\n\\nOne thing that they need to do a better job is promoting their food inside and outside the restaurant. Many people are not familiar with Asian hotpot culture and don't know how hotpot works. They have many TV in the building, perhaps they can put some educational/introduction materials on couple of the TV so people can follow along. Some videos or posters outside of the restaurant might help spark people's interest.

This restaurant appears to be the only \\"sit down and be served\\" eatery here.  We stopped for a late lunch on a recent Sunday and were seated right away on the outdoor patio that features 2 TVs (one was tuned to NFL football and the other to soccer), a few cool looking overhead gas heaters for the cooler months, and a view of the hoards of shoppers as they enter this mall.\\n\\nThe menu at Vinito is relatively small and simple, without being limiting.   We ordered a bottle of pinot grigio which was probably a touch overpriced at $35 considering the quality.  We ordered the Antipasti to share as a starter; it featured mozzarella, fresh tomatoes, roasted red peppers, eggplant, prosciutto, bruschetta, lettuce and black olives.  The Antipasti was good, not great, and though mozzarella is the first item mentioned in the description of this dish, our order only contained 1 small dollop of it.  The bruschetta was more like a pile of diced tomato on a slice of baguette, topped with a layer of shaved parmesan - it wasn't the most creative or flavorful bruschetta I've had.\\n\\nFor our main courses, I ordered the chicken portobello, while my partner had the New York Strip steak.  I liked everything on my plate - the chicken, the sauce, the sliced portobello mushroom and the roasted potatoes.  When I tried my partner's New York Strip, however, I found it to be dry.  Personally I'd have needed steak sauce if I'd been the one to order it.  Also, when trying to cut his steak, he found a fair amount of connective tissue and stringy bits.  That shouldn't have been the case with a $30 cut of meat. \\n\\nService on this day was a bit lacking: After we were first seated and we ordered the wine and the appetizer, our server asked right away what we wanted for our main courses, which felt a bit rushed.  When she served the wine, she gave both of us a decent pour and then asked if we'd like to taste it..Normally, of course, the person who ordered is presented with a small pour and allowed to taste and approve. Once our meals were served, we never really saw our server again until it was time to clear the table and we requested the bill.  It would've been nice if she'd checked in on us at least once while we were eating, and to possibly top off our wine.  As it was, we had to keep filling our own glasses; At least she did provide an ice bucket.\\n\\n3 stars for \\"A-OK\\" is about right for this place.  It's good, not great, and the prices are probably a few bucks higher than they deserve to be considering the quality of this restaurant, the decor, location and service.  Unfortunately, as mentioned above, this is the only real option for dining aside from the food court and a few kiosks, so if you plan to eat something decent when shopping at this mall, this is what you're stuck with."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Great atmosphere, tons of beer on tap (207), and a lot to offer.

The food? Haven't been to a more hit-or-miss spot in recent memory.\\n\\nPassport serves small (Teasers) to shared plates in storefront reminiscent of an HR Block pop-up. It's sterile and stark, especially during the early service hours when sunlight damps any flava brought by dusk-dealing lighting fixtures. Cooks popped in and out of the kitchen, marching through a small dining area and popping out of Emergency Exits to clearly smoke on the sidewalk. \\"Clearly\\" because windows. Does nothing for the appetite.\\n\\nConversations at the bar entailed a former employee asking the keep about \\"who was still around?\\" (the answer: only one person). Perhaps this shift in staff led to the wildly inconsistent experience from the menu.\\n\\nDelightful!\\n- Fried octopus ($6): tender, salty with a hearty crumb but not heavy on the tongue, and sided by a nicely spiced arrabbiata gravy. It's easy to overcook these guys, especially in a deep fry setting, yet they were stunning. The clear winner for me.\\n- Mac & Cheese ($7): indulgent, rich and resonating the sister resto's signature dish. Thanks Fat Cat for exporting the homiest of comfort foods.\\n- The Hayride cocktail ($11): Four Roses Bourbon, Amaro Abano, chai tea, a housemade beer simple syrup, and grated nutmeg. Rocks with raspberry/orange twist. Everything you love about fall\\n\\nDecent.\\n- Tuna Nachos ($8): I guess a lot of people really dig this commonplate, with a lightly dressed tuna sashimi overwhelmed by pickled ginger and seaweed salad on crisp fried wontons. Nothing enlightening if you've had this dish anywhere else.\\n- Steak Frites ($14): see above. Fries were cool, steak very rare on a medium-rare request. It was a replacement plate, and it was palatable, so decent is spot-on. \\n\\nDownright Awful.\\n- Burrata ($8): Or at least, I think there was a burrata somewhere in the resting pool of sweet balsamic glaze. The tomatoes looked and felt like they were cut out of a magazine, avocado cold, hard and scant in supply, and the actual cheese is best described as ball mozzarella - there's no cream (let alone creamy) center.\\n- Short Rib Bolognese ($10): Metallic, soupy \\"bolognese\\" with rubbery, tough beef pulled straight from a Lean Cuisine. I've never had a worse iteration of this dish. Pamela offered a another plate (see the Steak Frites), because after one bite, we couldn't believe this came from the same kitchen as our Delightful! starters.\\n\\nI love Fat Cat, and I love the potential of what this menu offers, but the polarity of the execution, not to mention the $30 price tag on a SPLIT of JJ Vincent's Marie Antoinette Pouilly-Fuisse, leaves Passport near the bottom of the \\"Try Again\\" list."},{"name":"Ramen Station","address":"519 Memorial Dr SE, Ste A6","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My review of this place reflects more on the atmosphere and service rather than the food (which was fine/good but not mind-blowing). A group of us from out of town showed up at 8:40, admitting we understood it was close to closing soon (9:00pm) we asked if it was too late to order counter service or we had no problem heading out. The gentleman taking orders assured us it was not a problem at all and made us feel comfortable doing so. He was extremely nice and helped us pick out some dishes. Unfortunately, there were 5-6 comments loudly made from the chef/ kitchen staff about wanting to go home, how we were inconveniencing them, etc - after our orders were in and paid for. I absolutely respect kitchen closing times - it is definitely okay to tell someone that the kitchen is closed. We were nervous about even coming in late, but expected they would be honest about our bad timing versus passive aggressively making us feel uncomfortable while saying it \\"was fine.\\" This could have been dealt with more appropriately. We ordered spicy chicken ramen, pork ramen, edamame and pork bao. The food was fine. I did think it seemed odd that any additions to ramen were served separately (often 5-7 min later than the bowl) and sometimes cold. I wish we had tried this spot under different circumstances. The shopping center and restaurant are both very cute, hip places and have a lot of potential. Again, the counter staff couldn't have been friendlier, I just wish there wasn't so much hostility. \\nFYI- they turn off the fryers by 8:30 so a lot of their menu is not available after that time."},{"name":"Hanako Japanese Restaurant","address":"15135 101 Avenue","city":"Surrey","stars":"4","text":"Finally got to come in.

Really good guy and I hope he succeeds.\\n\\nLike most Louisiana dishes there are as many recipes for a dish as there are chefs.   When I think shrimp and grits to me it is usually cheesy grits with shrimp grilled and put on top.  Mumbo's added small grilled bits of the trinity, sausage and a gravy of sorts.  Totally different than I had before but I really enjoyed it.   Quite tasty.\\n\\nI also tried the boudin; I am a sucker for boudin (Cajun rice sausage).  He served it sliced and on a bun with ground mustard.  So this to me was crazy.  Wasn't bad but way different.   Usually the best boudin is sold at small gas stations or mini marts steamed and served as a link wrapped in a paper towel and foil.  You eat it out of the casing or spread it on a saltine.  Think low country food.   I asked for mine whole.  It was fine but lacking in flavor plus grilled which changed the texture.

Kind of funny, with all the more Chinese and Vietnamese mom and pop shops on Mills (heart of old de facto Chinatown) that this shiny, hip, pan-Asian, local chain should setup shop and do so well.  At lunch on a Friday, looked to be pretty much chock full of young (non-Asian) diners.

Pretty much a greatest hits list of Asian noodles was on the menu, like Beef Haw Fun, Mee Goreng, Pad Thai, Curry Laksa, Stir Fry Udon.  Same for small plates, I tried the Five Spice Tofu (crispy tempura-ed cubes of medium firm tofu lightly dusted with five spice powder (subtle to almost bland, no sauce, ask for Thai sweet chili sauce on the side).

Chicken Satay skewers were chunks of breast tenders, rubbed with tumeric and mild spices, grilled until very dry.  I moistened it with a generous dunk of spicy peanut sauce on the side.  The usual pickled garnish of red onion and cucumber were served in large chunks, raw and unseasoned.  Roti Canai was a cup of nicely spicy, creamy coconut curry with a decorative slick of chili oil for added burn, roti was ultra flaky, crisp on edges, tender inside (def order extras for noshing).  One unusual item, perfect for the vegetarian in your party, the Curry Mashed Potatoes with their spicy curry sauce.

There were items we never got or were messed up- never got glasses for our beers, 3x they messed up our prosecco order, our salads weren't right, and our bill was incorrect 3 times. They kept charging us for other people's food and locating anyone to fix it was nearly impossible. It's a cramped, dark, often loud space. \\n\\nPerhaps since there is no table turnover, they try to give each server a large number of tables? There is a semblance of a system where you put a card up on the table if you need service, but the servers don't take the cards down and don't pay attention when they are up. \\n\\nThe food is mediocre. My salad (that was supposed to come with no cheese) tasted only of cheese, which was odd because their sparse charcuterie board doesn't include cheese. The only item I would order again was the french fries- surprisingly yummy. Be careful if you are allergic to rosemary or other spices though as the fries are seasoned. \\n\\nGreat artists will bring me back to CW I'm sure, but I recommend eating a little something beforehand because the food is subpar.

You could tell they use fresh ingredients just by the smell. \\nFor the entrees, my husband ordered lasagna and I ordered linguine in clam sauce. My linguine lacked any kind of flavor, it seemed like they just tossed it in olive oil and served it on a plate. Unable to continue another bite, I had to send it back. The server immediately apologized and said they would be happy to sub in another entr√©e. \\nAt this point both my husband and I are having lasagna. Now, why did I give this restaurant 5 stars ? because their lasagna is the most perfect Italian dish I have ever tasted. The pasta was perfectly cooked, but the layers still intact. The sauce had SO MUCH FLAVOR. Fresh garlic, tomatoes with an impeccable amount of cheese on top made up for the sad linguine I had previously ordered. I felt really bad for sending back the linguine and I apologized profusely , but the lasagna was really out of this world.\\nWould come back in a heartbeat.

You write your name and number down and when a table is ready they will seat you. There is no waiting inside (except a small bench if you have mobility issues), so you have to wait in your car, on the sidewalk, or take a small walk around the area. We opted to walk around the area and enjoyed the beautiful night and wall murals across the street.\\n\\nWe were seated relatively quickly in a small table in the back near the kitchen. It is definitely a hole in the wall with maybe 10 tables close-together. In other words, just like any other good Asian restaurant. (Their bathroom is large and relatively clean.)\\n\\nWe shared family-style and had the classic hand-pulled noodles with shrimp, beef bulgogi noodles, braised pork ribs, and korean cabbage with pork. We could watch them pull the noodles behind us while we waited for our food. We didn't get our food crazy fast, but it was decently timed--we weren't bored waiting. \\n\\nThe pork ribs were my favorite, and the noodles had a great consistency. What stood out the most was that each dish tasted different and had a different sauce.

The scones were incredible & the berry jam and honey butter were delicious. For our main entrees, we split the Riverside and the Salmon Eggs Benedict. They smoke their salmon there, and it tasted incredibly fresh. The Riverside's french toast was some of the best french toast I have ever eaten. Be sure to get the pastries at the beginning, because the french toast with some of the berry jam is amazing.

Considering that breakfast is suppose to be your biggest and most important meal of the day, the portions here don't disappoint.  My omelette was absolutely gimongous ... big sized pieces of portabella and red peppers--  left me having to cut, cut, and cut every single bite I took.... but such enjoyable bites they were.... all that work was worth it.  Coupled with my side choices of grilled english muffin (wheat of course), and grilled mashed potatoes.  Talk about being pressured under spot with so many choices.  Luckily, they turned out to hit the spot.\\n\\nThey don't kid around with their fruit as well.... a side fruit dish, could have partially covered a meal.
