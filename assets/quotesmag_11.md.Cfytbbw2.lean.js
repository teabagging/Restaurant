I visited for a late breakfast on my way to visit my Grandfather in the hospital so I was looking for a hearty breakfast and they certainly delivered.  However, as other reviewers have mentioned - the d√©cor and service are nothing to write home about.  I arrived a bit after 11 am on a weekday, so I was a bit after the breakfast crowd but before the worst of lunch.  The restaurant is seat yourself, which can be lovely, but I was a little disappointed to find a number of empty tables overflowing with dirty dishes.  I hung about at the front waiting for them to be cleared and must have confused one of the servers terribly, as she kept telling me \\"wherever you like\\" and finally was near enough for me to answer \\"Um, nothing seems to be clean\\".  Maybe I'm just prissy but I have no interest in sitting at table full of someone else's dishes and then waiting for the server to come clear it off.\\n\\nOnce seated, there was a bit of a wait to order and for my food, but I did wonder perhaps if I'd annoyed them by not wanting to buss my own table.  Regardless - the food added another star to what would have been a decidedly two star experience.  I went with the Crown Turkey omelet.  My server made a point of saying that it was what the Orlando Sentinel reviewer had raved about. I had no idea what review she was talking about but smiled and nodded. The omelet was divine - smoked turkey and spinach inside, a very good hollandaise, diced tomatoes and Jack cheese outside. It reminded me of an even better version of an old favorite from First Watch that they no longer offer.  The rye toast was good - but toast.  But their house potatoes were lovely - slices just thick enough, tender, but with some really nicely brown and toasty bits from sitting on the griddle.  I did have some trouble finding my server to request a drink refill, which seemed odd since the entire restaurant is one large room.  I made eye contact with two other servers, but maybe they just weren't feeling the team spirit that day because no one asked if I needed anything.  If I lived in Orlando, I would have visited a second time before reviewing, but unfortunately I can't see making a 2 hour drive (one-way) just to give this place a second chance.

The juggernaut was good but pretty pricey at 12.99. Eating only half of it is enough to fill you up (or at least me). The chicken is a bit dry so I used generous servings of the hot sauce they kindly provide. The waffle was also very sweet and I recommend avoiding Red #5 and requesting the normal waffle instead of the hot-Cheeto red one it normally comes with. The strawberry jam that they gave was very good, and the egg and cheese complemented the whole thing well (wish I had requested to hold the American cheese, though). The blueberry waffles were a huge mistake. They give you a huge stack, which is nice, but though they claim to be layered with a cream cheesy whip (the white stuff on the top pancake in the photo) they were not. The whip and the streaks of blueberry jam on the plate were the only good part. The pancakes were a little dense and had those fake blueberries in them that are just little blobs of cornstarch, sugar, and food coloring.

But I guess I'm a contrarian to the contrarians. Sorry. ANYWAY...they make fresh pasta in that truck and it is delicious, al dente, perfection! I also love the staff here, and how they joyfully offer a tour of the menu as you step up to the line. We really enjoy the laid back atmosphere here. There are few good Italian options in Austin, and this place is so good, I'm surprised it is not constantly overflowing with peoples. Grab a bottle of the Malbec from the Butterfly Bar (not Italian I know, but that's ok, right?), enjoy some pasta, and have a wonderful evening here!\\n\\nAlso, we ate our Italian food while a SXSW metal concert was occurring in the same backyard.

I said I'd never go back. Well, I gave it another try tonight and the sandwich was not edible. $11 meatball sandwich with 3 meatballs, little to no sauce and bread that was burnt and hard. This time I brought it back and the woman claimed she was the owner but I don't believe her and even if she is it wouldn't make the food any better. I would have preferred my money back but they made another sandwich. When I asked for more sauce, she said \\"there's tons of sauce on there.\\" There wasn't and meatball sandwiches are meant to be eaten with a knife and fork, but what's the big damn deal? Give me some more sauce. It still isn't good, still isn't worth $11 and explains why there are never many people in this place. I live across the street and it is never full. Now I know why. Also, check your order before you leave and pay attention while you are there. No one ever washes their hands, not the cooks or the waiters, not ever.

My companion ordered the pork and calamari appetizers, which he said were good but not great. His main entree was the half chicken which looked really good and was on a bed of lemon potatoes. I ordered the Burrata was an appetizer, which had figs and pistachio. It was delicious, though I wish it had been served with bread. I also ate the Campanelle pasta which was actually delicious! There was a hint of red pepper for an unexpected hint of spicy. I loved it!\\n\\nService: We ordered three appetizers, one of which was brought about 20 minutes before the other two. The waitress was very gracious and brought us a free appetizer on the house. However about 40 minutes later we were brought the dessert menu and asked if we wanted a dessert.. without having gotten our main course. We let the waitress know and again she was very gracious and apologized, but our food came until like 20 minutes after that. By then my companion was not even hungry anymore, though I still devoured my pasta, but was really tired. We were brought expressos on the house, which smelled delicious, but it was almost 10:30 pm. \\n\\nFinal impression: Loved the place and location, the food was good, the service was unfortunately bad though the staff was delightful.

It was rice, bulgogi, kimchi, sprouts, gojuchang paste, a fried egg and cracked raw egg on top. The point of this dish is that the stone bowl it's served in is so hot that you have to stir and stir, or \\"stir like crazy\\" as they say in their menu, so that the egg continues to cook.

It came with pickled onions, some mushy orange stuff that was pretty good, and two roasted garlic cloves. \\n\\nThe pomodoro was disappointing. The pasta was clumped together as though it hadn't been mixed with olive oil, and the sauce lacked any tomato flavor to the extent that it was essentially pasta in light cream.

I was in heaven when I walked in and saw all the latkas, and rugelach, and cheese blintzes. I was like a giddy little kid in a candy store.\\n\\nI really wanted to like this place.So much so I kept going back even though the service is indifferent at best and down right rude at worst. I have now been there for Breakfast, (Had the Challah french toast one time and an Eggel twice), Lunch (had Matzo ball soup and a latka ) and Dinner (had the New Yorker) Each time taking home either a half dozen bagels and/or some other bakery items. (Cinnamon buns, lemon cake, Babbka, blintzes, Rugelach or baby pies) I kept going back hoping against hope that I would find something, anything to redeem this place. Until today! I picked up a half dozen bagels on the way home and I think they were the worst bagels I have even had. They were, small, and hard on the outside, and the inside were so chewy my jaw got tired. Inedible! Either someone messed up the dough on this batch or they were day olds.\\n\\nTo give some context, I am from back east (Ottawa, Montreal , and Toronto) and my family owned and operated a chain of Bagel shops and deli for the better part of 20 years So I know a thing or two about good bagels and good deli sandwiches. As someone else put it, this is FAUX Ashkenazim food. How does this place stay in business? Kitch factor I guess..... \\n\\nThe Chalah french toast is pre made and sits in a big pile in the cooler covered in plastic wrap. I didn't realize they were just going to give me the stuff from the cooler I figured they would make it fresh to order. I'm not sure but I think they actually microwaved it to reheat it. You don't microwave bread it gets all hard and nasty on the edges. It was not good. Soaked it in syrup and choked it down cause I was hungry. Poor first experience. \\n\\nThe Eggel was so greasy it needed to be wrapped in a napkin just to avoid covering my hands in grease. I would expect this from a burger not an egg sandwich. I decided to cut them some slack for a second time and give it a try another day when they were not so busy. The second time I ordered the Eggel the lady took my name but apparently couldn't be bothered to call it out when my food was ready, because after 20 minutes I walked up and saw it sitting there. When I asked the lady if it was my order she turned her back on me and walked away without answering. By then it was cold and unappetizing. On the plus side at least I didnt burn my hand on the grease like the first time. LOL\\n\\nThe New Yorker sandwich tasted like corned beef from a can but in meat slices. Tossed it in the compost after eating half. Was that bad!\\n\\nCinnamon buns were dry and hard. No icing included. Babbka was terrible threw them in the compost. Baby pies were overcooked and who knows how long they were sitting around by the time I picked them up. Compost again! \\n\\nI am stretching to find something nice to say .........I can say the Lemon cake was very good. It was moist  and full of flavor. The Matzo Ball soup was average. The latka was ok. \\n\\nI am heart broken that I just couldn't make it work with Solly's. I tried so hard to like this place but it is just time I face the facts. Service is bad, food is bad, and on top of that it is overpriced. As I'm new around here I cant even suggest an alternative. If you are a hipster doofus you will probably love this place but if you know what a real bagel place and deli should be, avoid the disappointment. \\n\\nSorry Solly but its time for me to start seeing other restaurants.

The host person took our name down and said \\"let us know when all of your party arrives since we don't seat any incomplete parties.\\" Okay, fine that is your policy. What I felt furious about was that he did not even give us the time to explain that our party won't be completed for another hour. We were completely shut down as soon as we try to find other options for our party since all we wanted to do was to sit down, order appetizers and 2 drinks each while we wait. He didn't even try to give us another option, maybe of \\"you're more than welcome to grab a drink at the bar while you're wait in the waiting area\\". When it's someone's first time at your establishment, please be a little more accommodating and give us some options because we were there to spend $$$$$$!!! Instead of 3 appetizers, 6 entrees and 10 drinks, they got 6 entrees and 5 drinks... Imagine the revenue lost from this party multiply by how many other times they have done this!? \\n\\nI freaking get it; the restaurant gets super busy for dinner service.

The mole sauce of the enchiladas turned out to be barely acceptable, but what was the most shocking was that in both plates the enchiladas were fridge cold, and felt as if they had been poorly warmed up in a microwave. The chicken was dry and plasticky, as if it had been poorly boiled, and the rice was lumpy and had no flavor. The food was so bad that we could not even finish it.

As put off as I was, I figured someone mixed up their leaves and they would simply send me my correct order. So I called and whoever I spoke to unapologetically told me that they ran out of basil so used mint instead.  I tried to convey how inappropriate it is to exchange ingredients without notifying the consumer because of allergies, etc and how it would have been appropriate to notify me in advance so I could change my order if desired, and he simply said \\"if you are allergic to it we will come pick it up and issue you a refund.\\" He argued with me over the phone trying to justify using mint: \\"It's in the same family as mint...we only get 2 shipments of basil a week\\"  It was an incredibly frustrating and futile conversation.

Considering they are open until 2:00 and the place was packed I would have thought they would have done a much better job of keeping the food plentiful.\\nAt $40 a pop I felt they could have done a much better job.

Actually its a good place that the kids enjoy, while offering the adults a spacious and comfortable atmosphere and a decent food and bar menu. And when I asked my son what restaurant he wanted us to take him, the Raccoon Lodge was his immediate answer. His favourite item is the Hawaiian Burger (with ham and pineapple of course), of which he has described to me in great detail. \\n\\nThe 4 of us (Mom, Dad, Step-Mom, and Son) met here last Sunday for a family meeting. Actually, it was more of an adult discussion, as my son figured out that this meeting was all about him, and wasn't about to cooperate in what he thought was an interrogation. And although I remain disappointed with my son's school progress in some areas, it was still pretty neat to see how closely my ex and current wives were on the same page regarding the well being of my son.\\n\\nI'm sure my son thought that his Hawaiian Burger was the highlight of his evening. As for Gayle and me, we had better. Her salad was smothered with dressing, when she specifically didn't order it that way. And although the waiter admitted that he screwed up, we didn't appreciate his long absences and an overall lack of attention.\\n\\nAs for me, I tried to show both wives that contrary to their experience, that I was capable of ordering something beyond my standard choice of a blue cheese burger. Instead, I ordered a pulled pork burrito (with mole sauce) that not only was meh, but had an aftertaste that gave me the gift of long \\"finish\\" into the evening. At least my IPA was good and my son's mother paid the tab.\\n\\nBecause I love my son, I'll come here again if he wants.

(Which means, I finally got to eat at Thurman's, as there is so much fantastic food in the city that I rarely have the patience to wait an hour for a burger.)  If you're having the same problem that I've had for the past couple of years, take this advice:  go when the weather is so crapola that very few people in their right minds would want to get out in it.  We went on a snowy evening and had a 20-minute wait.\\n\\nWe were seated at a large booth where I felt a little uncomfortable taking up alllll of that space just for two, but I was so happy to be in and sitting that I didn't mind overmuch.  I ordered an A-1 burger (as A-1 is my secret guilty pleasure--I won't eat it with steak but I love it on a burger) and hubs ordered a bacon burger.  We split a basket of fries.  \\n\\nThe food came out pretty promptly and it was good (and huge).  I would not say it is the very best burger I've ever eaten, and I wouldn't say that it's worth an hour wait, but I'd probably wait up to 30 minutes to eat here again.  My main beef (har har) with my burger was that, after I tasted that initial zing of A-1, the flavors dulled on my palate a few bites in.  Hubs got the better deal, I think, with his bacon burger, but he felt self-conscious eating such a huge, drippy, messy burger in public.  The fries were good enough but needed salt; nothing special there.\\n\\nAll-told, a great place to get a burger except for the potential for a wait.

It is here, and it is good. Went for dinner and beers on opening night. Early close time is a bit sad, but hopefully hours will extend later. Got the chicken/blue cheese/cuke/greens wrap -- delish except for WAY too much blue cheese, despite me having asked to go easy on the blue. They have wonderful local beers on tap, and the Wormtown Blueberry was lovely and refreshing. It is also wonderful to see a few familiar faces working behind the counter, and Stacey from Allston Cafe is managing which is a very good thing... she came out and chatted it up with us for a bit.\\n\\nI then went in this morning for a coffee and bagel sandwich to go, on my way to work. The coffee, which I had heard was on the weak side on opening day, was SPECTACULAR. Seriously, have not had a cup of hot strong black coffee this good in Allston since Blue State opened. It was the \\"Love Buzz\\" and I hope that is an option every day, because I would drink it in place of water to survive.\\n\\nThe bagel sandwich was confusingly expensive and their bagel selection was VERY minimal which was off-putting, but then I realized that it cost $5.95 because it comes with homefries! This was a pleasant surprise, although there should be an option to have just the sandwich if one so desires. Unfortunately, the homefries were slightly undercooked and VERY underseasoned. They definitely needed some salt, spice and a little more browning. But the bagel sandwich, even on a plain bagel (boooring), was tasty!\\n\\nAll in all, I am purty impressed for opening week. And knowing that Jennifer Lee, who owns the restaurants flanking Refuge, knows Allston like the back of her hand, I am sure it will be up to 5 star status very soon. I hear that there will be local art displayed eventually and hopefully a bulletin board will go up soon for band flyers and such, so it will maintain the support of the local art/music scene.

I ordered a turkey sandwich, which was quite unimpressive and no better than what you might find at a casual dining restaurant. The side items were disappointing as well. There had been a communication issue with our server regarding the number of sides coming with the item vs. sides ordered separately. My husband and I had each ordered two sides because we we under the impression that you could replace the spicy pickle with a side item. However, when the check came, we were both charged for an extra side - and not a nominal fee. Instead of getting the manager or trying to resolve the discrepancy in a calm and reasonable manner, our waitress was rude and proceeded to argue with us in front of our entire party (5 other people)!

When we arrived we waited about 15 minutes to be seated, and we sat at a table outside overlooking the lake (would have been a great view of the fireworks show if we had gone at night).  Our server was friendly and prompt, bringing us menus and drinks right away, and he stopped by to see if we needed anything several times throughout the meal.\\n\\nThe food here didn't really seem to be anything to write home about, but it didn't take them too long to bring it out, so we were able to eat and get back to the park without a long wait.  The prices seemed on par for Disney dining (aka a little too expensive for what you get) on both the food and the drinks.  Since it was the middle of a hot day and we wanted to continue to walk around the park, we opted to share an appetizer and an entree so that we didn't get too full.\\n\\nFor the appetizer we opted for the House-made English Pasty, which was a chicken and leek filled puff pastry; $13 seemed a high price tag for this dish, but the flavors were definitely there.  The chicken and leek filling was creamy, the puff pastry was toasted and gave a nice crunch and the pickled onion and tomato salad that accompanied the dish was tart and crisp.  The entree that we ordered was the Bangers and Mash: a traditional English sausage with Colcannon potatoes, roasted mushrooms, caramelized onion jam, and red wine demi.  The sausage itself was pretty standard, and the mashed potatoes were too liquidy for my taste, but the real star of the dish was surprisingly the combination of the roasted mushrooms, red wine demi and onion jam.\\n\\nOverall I thought the food at the Rose & Crown Dining Room was good enough to bring me back to try some of their other menu items, especially if I am at the park in time to catch the fireworks from their dining patio.  I wish they had more of a \\"small plates\\" style menu for lunch, but I'll probably stick to the food kiosks for that when at Epcot in the future."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Good biscuits.

I could go either way on this.\\n\\nHow's that for the start of a review?\\nNo really, it's difficult for me to say 5 stars or one, do I went with 3.  And here is why!  :-P\\n\\nThe location itself, isn't the easiest to get too, especially if you're not from the area and following directions via your Sprint Cell phone.  Really, it's just not on the main street, and if you kept going down the main street while being focused on traffic/pedestrians.  You'd completely miss this place.  This was mainly just a quick note to anyone on the hunt for this place, it didn't affect my star decision in this instance.  \\n\\nOnce you're inside there is \\"mostly\\" limited seating.  Enough for most likely 50 people, but in close quarters.  Me and the table behind me kept bumping chairs, and constant apologies followed.  The menu is giant, in size and options, and is two sided so if you don't find what you're looking for on one side - simply rotate and continue.  Although - I'm sure you would have figured this out... I'm just saying.  :)\\n\\nFor this \\"event\\" we had complimentary cornbread, corn fritters appetizer, 'small' baby back ribs with cole slaw and beans, and a pulled pork sandwich with beans and fries.\\n\\nThe Cornbread wasn't too sweet or dry, I guess you'd say it was a bit of both.  I've had cornbread that would make me want to order a whole loaf for the actual meal, and this wasn't it.  Although, it was a tasty starter.  Soft, moist, and tasty.  :)\\n\\nThe corn fritters came drizzled in Maple syrup, which had also taken over the bottom of the bowl/dish it was served in.  I felt there was more fritter and less corn, but for the most part these were made well and tasted good.  Again, the ones I've had before had a bit more sweet corn in the mix that really added the flavor you wanted, and these just seemed to be moderate at best.\\n\\nBoth the ribs and pulled pork were really good.  However, it was lacking that \\"something\\"... that \\"kick\\"... that you wanted from it.  Usually I would solve this with BBQ sauce, and bring it all together, however their BBQ sauce selections were not that fantastic.  One was pure heat (so if you like spicy more than flavor that might be your winner).  The sweet was more like... sweet teriyaki... it's hard to describe, but it had a really not-so-pleasant flavor to it.\\n\\nAll that said, I want to point out that the meat was good, cooked well, tender, almost perfection minus that hint of flavor.  And to prove it, I went home and had the ribs again the next day for dinner, then basted them with a little store bought sauce before reheating.  Fantastic!!!  Possible the best ribs in Boston.  LOL  The pulled pork will be reheated later tonight.  :-P  LOL\\n\\nThe beans are a bit of a letdown, I was expecting BBQ/baked style beans, but they were black eye peas.  Not at all what I was expecting.  The cole slaw is decent, but nothing to write home about.  (Just Yelp - LOL)  And the fries are actually quite delicious.  You can tell they are fresh cut potatoes so that is a HUGE plus!  I love homemade fries instead of ones that are frozen.  Delicious.\\n\\nI wouldn't tell anyone to avoid the place, in the end it was tasty and a good choice for a day out.

Our top 12 were closed because of boxing day, so we went to this based upon some favorable reviews. We made a reservation, but had to wait even while walk ins were seated, that arrived after us.

Well, Neptune's isn't as great as my husband but it's a close second.  Quite possibly my favorite restaurant not just for the superb food but also the sentimental value.  When I moved to Boston in 2005, Neptune's was my first meal in this city and continued to be where I would come to celebrate special occasions and milestones.\\n\\nI come for 2 reasons, the oysters and the lobster roll.  The selection of oysters is fantastic and I particularly appreciate the descriptions of each oyster.  I have found that the descriptions are right on and I have rarely ever been disappointed in the quality of the oysters or the taste.  The oysters are unique, rarely do I have oysters with a champagne or buttered popcorn finish!  The prices have gone up a bit and the oysters are around $2.60.  It's amazing how quickly one can devour $100 worth of food!\\n\\nThe lobster roll is served on a brioche bun with either a mayo sauce or hot butter.  It's very traditional without anything extra to detract from the real lobster taste.  Definitely not frozen in any way.  The chunks of lobster is huge and there is so much lobster goodness crammed in that little bun that I have many bites of just lobster alone.  Absolutely to die for.\\n\\nOther notable dishes I've had are the clam chowder, the steamed clams, and the oyster minestrone.  The first two are standard but so delicious.  I don't usually like my oysters cooked but the minestrone has the most delicious oyster flavor.  The broth is rich and the spices add interest to this tomato based soup.  So good, not to be missed!\\n\\nThis restaurant really doesn't need any more reviews, but I love it so much, I just couldn't neglect it.

I had a taste for something spicy, and this looked pretty good.  (Fire of Brazil - which is on the bottom floor of this building - first caught my eye, but I was looking at spending about half what that would have cost me.)\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is pretty unremarkable-looking.  I wouldn't say it's uniquely furnished at all, but it's nice enough.  The staff were all wearing extremely loud Hawaiian shirts, which made it pretty easy to pick them out.\\n\\nWith the exception of my waiter, the staff wasn't very pleasant - kind of short with me, perhaps because I was on my own and not bringing a big party.  My waiter, however, was extremely attentive and very nice.\\n\\nI ordered their \\"House Special\\" - Molcajete (with chicken).  It's an unusual dish, which is why it caught my eye.  It was described as \\"Carrots, celery and your choice of meat line an oven heated lava rock filled with bubbling Ranchero sauce. Served w/ warm tortillas.\\"\\n\\nWhat this amounts to, if you can't read between the lines (I couldn't), is basically \\"really unique fajitas\\".\\n\\nThe main part of the meal came in - as advertised - a heavy, hot lava rock.  It was carved into a sculpture of a cow (or maybe a sheep) with a nice deep bowl in the middle, and it kept everything inside very hot - indeed, bubbling, as advertised.  The ranchero sauce was perfectly spicy and absolutely delicious.  The chicken was nicely cooked, and the dish was served with a side of rice & black beans.  I was given 3 tortillas at the outset, and more were provided free of charge.\\n\\nI wasn't quite sure what to make of the carrots and celery.  Maybe my palate isn't refined enough, but they didn't fit the rest of the meal very well.  They were best when eaten on their own rather than wrapped with the rice, beans, and chicken.\\n\\nI would definitely eat here again, were I to come back to downtown Atlanta.

My favorite was The Sea, aptly named for the squid ink and seaweed in it, which show up in the form of whorls when sliced. Of course, because the menu changes daily, I can't recommend the same dishes I had. But they offer half-portions of everything, and you should definitely experience at least a couple of different things when you dine here. Between the two of us, we shared 5 half-portion plates, and it seemed to be just the right amount of food. They were: Bondir Charcuterie (includes head cheese, duck rillettes, chicken galantine, and foie gras terrine), Perigord Black Truffle, Whole Wheat Garganelli, Olive Oil Confit Rosefish, and Vermont Lamb Shoulder. I guess it wouldn't make sense for me to review every dish, because it might not show up on their menus again, but I will say my favorite was the lamb shoulder, which was smooth and moist enough that it almost resembled the feeling I get on my tongue with foie gras. I didn't have to use my knife. The top layer was charred and tough, but flavorful enough that I could still enjoy the chewiness. The rosefish was served with two slices of apple and brussel sprouts, all seasoned lightly and delicious. \\n\\nEach dish was so beautifully simple, yet every detail and ingredient augmented with intention. The flavors in every bite were uniquely uncomplicated, solid yet subtle. Complex but not confusing. Can simple and complex coexist in one dish? I think so; it's called true sophistication. In an era when many chefs attempt to ride absurd creativity as the vehicle to their claim to fame and sui generis, the straightforward flavors here are unexpectedly refreshing. Chef Bond's mission is transparent in his food --to deliver honest, organic, and delicious food to the table-- and it shows. It is consistent, but never boring. \\n\\nAmbiance/decor: Just like the food, the decor is intentional yet unpretentious. It's intimate and cozy, with a fireplace and exposed brick walls. The space is decorated with birch tree stumps and tulips hanging arbitrarily yet tastefully all around the place from the entrance to the tables. The space could feel a little cramped, but I couldn't dismiss a restaurant based on their space alone.\\n\\nPrices vary, half-portion plates ranging from $14-35, and full portions anywhere from $26-60. With a couple of glasses of wine, our meal, and dessert, the bill was $182. So that should give you a good idea of what you might be spending.\\n\\nI'm no \\"foodie\\", but I'd imagine a true foodie's raison d'etre is to constantly seek out simple, honest, exceptionally elegant food.

After I got to the pick-up window, I was told that what I wanted to order was not ready and that, if I still wanted it, I'd have to wait about 5 minutes until it was prepared. I didn't really mind that, although it was a little unexpected and inconvenient. I drove over to the side of the parking lot and waited for my food to be brought out to me, and as I was waiting a guy walked up to my car and started asking me for money, and using a story about how he left his debit card in Lake Mary and needed some gas money so he could drive up there and pick it up. I would've been sympathetic and given him a dollar, maybe, but unfortunately for him I'd experienced his act before. The same guy used the same story on me at the 7-11 just down the street (jct. Princeton and Orange) maybe a month or so prior. So, I had to deal with him again because a) the food wasn't ready when it should have been and b) the store manager didn't do anything about people loitering in the parking lot late at night.

I also read it's $3 to split a plate of food - wha? That's right, tres dollares. So my buddy and I hatched a plan: she would order $11 eggs benedict, and I'd order potatoes. I grabbed my egg benedict (singular) and she grabbed some $2 potatoes. So we split $13 on brunch.

I never expected to see such big pieces of seafood in a curry at a place like this. Granted, it was a bit tasteless (probably pre-frozen), but still. Nothing's perfect...

But that becomes all the more real when you get to the roof deck and gaze upon...the giant, abandoned, brick building and highway. But whatevs.\\n\\nI went on a Friday night during Rush Hour: every Tuesday, Thursday and Friday there is a free food buffet. The website calls your attention to sliders, steak tips and pasta. I was there around from 6-8 and saw none of that. Instead we had meatballs in marinara, mozz sticks, buffalo wings, ravioli AND fried ravioli, tuna sashimi cups (?) and pizza. Perhaps if I had stayed later, the food would have changed. But for, what I would say is dinnertime, that's we got. I will point out though that these items were delicious.\\n\\nDrinks are expensive. Cocktails are $13, wine is $10, beer was much cheaper at around $5. \\n\\nThe main floor of this lounge has many sections including a particular closed off room with red leather couches. I would totally consider, grabbing my girls and chilling in there...if the drinks were cheaper.\\n\\nThe roofdeck is a decent size. It has many luxurious cabanas along one side, tables in the middle and tall tables along the other side. Unfortunately the pool is tiny. As soon as we sat in a cabana, we couldn't even see the pool. Nice touch, but I was hoping for a bigger one. As we left, we all wondered what the roof deck would look like at night...probably awesome.\\n\\nAlso, the toilets. When I first saw them I thought they were custom built for some old people who need a little lift to get off the pot. But they're modern bidets! Yes, I tried them. Yes, it was weird. No, I will not try them again. I think I let out a yelp when I turned it on.\\n\\nI loved the ambiance of the place, but it definitely can't be on my shortlist because of the price.

Most of their meat has an appearance and taste of being reheated in a microwave.  Prime rib is gray lol.  This seems to be a practice here, as their French fries (which they do take the time to fresh cut) taste like they have been sitting for long periods of time and then reheated.

We shared the garlic prawns appetizer, followed by the Penne Ricardo for hubby and Fettucine alla Vodka for me.  We ended the meal with tiramisu.  Maybe we just got lucky with the dishes we ordered, but we enjoyed everything.\\n\\nGarlic prawns:  Must've been at least 15 shrimp on that plate. Well seasoned and cooked perfectly (neither underdone, nor overdone) but we were a little disappointed in the lack of garlic.  Maybe Canadians don't like garlic as much as Californians?\\n\\nCaesar salad:  Love that salad comes with the meal.  This was quite basic, but tasty.  Lettuce was fresh and crispy. Can't say much else.\\n\\nGarlic toast:  Appreciate that this is included with the meal, but it was dry and again low on garlic.  I'm assuming this is a regional thing; not sure.\\n\\nPenne Ricardo:  This was penne with a gorgonzola rose sauce.  I hate blue cheese, but took a bite of this and found that the sauce was mild but had a pleasant tangy flavor.\\n\\nFettucine alla Vodka;  This was fettucine with prawns in a spicy tomato cream sauce.  It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a shrimp pasta where the shrimp were not overcooked.  This dish made me very happy.  I do think it could have used something to brighten in up a little--some fresh basil or spinach or feta or something else to break up the texture a little.  But I'm not complaining--this dish really hit the spot.\\n\\nTiramisu:  Good portion for sharing; tasted fresh and well balanced.  This is the only dessert they make in-house.\\n\\nService:  Very attentive and friendly.  Our waiter, Mitchell, made excellent recommendations and I'm certain he's the reason we enjoyed our meal so much.\\n\\nAtmosphere:  Cute neighborhood joint that offers great value and a casual, friendly environment.  Our only complaint is that it was very hot inside.  Apparently, one of the servers tried to open windows, but other patrons complained.  Those of us in the back would've appreciated some air.\\n\\nWe leave Vancouver tomorrow, so I won't be able to try any other dishes, but we both thoroughly enjoyed tonight's dining experience.  We were tired from a day of sightseeing and wanted a good meal without having to get dressed up and spend a fortune--Cafe Luxy delivered exactly what we needed.

They serve breakfast all day, it was too late for their brunch specials, the Tex-Mex sounded good, and there were salads, entrees, and sandwiches.  \\n\\nThere's a front room that feels very diner-y and a back patio that was enclosed in the cooler weather.  You can wait in their tiny foyer where there's some seating or outside or in the sister shop next door.  Their PA system ensures you'll hear when your party is called.  After we were seated, I asked the waiter for recommendations and settled on the portabello melt.  Although it's listed under sandwiches, it felt more like a burger with the portabello mushroom thick and juicy with the sauteed red bell pepper and onions juices spilling on my plate, all served on a whole wheat bun.  My partner got the flamingo sandwich which also looked tasty.  It came with avocado, sprouts, and cheese and looked more like a normal sandwich.  We both got the home fries, which are really fried potatoes.  \\n\\nThe prices are inexpensive and they accept credit cards.

Oysters were BOMB. The kumamoto(?) oysters were tastier although smaller than the wellfleet IMO. So goot. The chowder was thin which was eh to me because I like my chowders thick. The taste was pleasantly oceany. The chioppino was not so spicy, even my bf could tolerate it. It had some rice and red (Cajun?) soup with assorted variety of seafood from clams to mussels to shrimp to lobster to salmon and some other white fish (white dish was so delectable!). Lobster roll looked small but it held a lotta lobster. I think $27 is expensive for a roll but it comes with fries if that makes it any better lol. Fries were better than fast food fries.

Rasmalai is one of life's little pleasures I allow myself at Indian restaurant. I know what it is and what it should be. So does my family. So when my wife bit into it and started to retch, I knew something was amiss. The milk sauce was thick, yellow and soured. Ugh.

Really spoiled the meal.\\n\\nUnfortunate, because the Lamb Bhuna and Baigan Bhartha were both excellent. Just the right amount of spice and very authentic behavior.

I have been going to one place that is relatively decent but can be hit or miss. Some friends recommended Pu Yi and I have to say I was not disappointed!\\n\\nFirst of all, I placed the order online and the food arrived in less than 30 minutes (which is more than I can say for some places). When I opened the bag, the order was HUGE. My usual standby for new places is an order of friend dumplings and sesame chicken and the both were delicious.\\n\\nThe dumplings were crispy but not dry, the meat filling was moist and flavorful and the sauce that came with it had a little spice to it. The chunks of sesame chicken were very large but also tender with not a lot of breading or batter on them and the sauce was more like a sweet, savory and zesty glaze rather than a watery broth. On top of what I ordered, I also got a small bag of those fried noodle things which is bad news for my cholesterol.\\n\\nI have ordered from Pu Yi twice, now, and I think I have found my new go-to place for Chinese food. The food is delivered quickly and the delivery people I've spoken to have been friendly. Everything is flavorful and, while the the cost is slightly higher than what I would like, as I've said, the portions have been larger than the going rate so there could be enough for 2 meals (or 1 meal and a snack).

I get their roast beef sandwich once every couple weeks and never leave disappointed. The ingredients are always fresh and though the sandwich looks small, it's actually fairly filling. I also love the crispy fried onions and horseradish sauce they put in there. Those are definitely the elements that differentiate it from your normal boring sandwich.

My mom couldn't eat the onion soup bc it tastes like bbq sauce and she wasn't even sure if it was onion soup.  Creativity is great with food but if the item isn't recognizable that's maybe a step too far.  The quality of the chicken wasn't appealing to me but I think fried chicken lovers may be pretty happy with it.  \\n\\nThe worst part of the meal was that we had s late dinner (it was slow/off peak hours), ordered immediately and didnt get any apps, and we were sitting for 40 minutes before our food arrived.

This is how pasta is genuinely meant to be enjoyed. The carbonara was awesome and was super rich, flavorful, and hearty. The pancetta pieces were hearty and had a wonderful smoky flavor. The special that we ordered was advertised as a spicy red sauce with a smoky flavor as well, but was extremely lackluster and disappointing. It was very spicy, but that was all the sauce tasted like -- no depth or complexity in flavor like the carbonara. Meatball made up for it! Get this!! Garlic bread was also delicious but was cold so it wasn't as good, which was disappointing because the flavor was delicious and rich. \\n\\nOverall the dining experience was wonderful and I would come back here for date night, but the flavors in the pasta were good, not great.

The breading on the chicken wasn't too fried so as to feel heavy and greasy while the vegetables felt fresh within the wrap.

The tuna was delicious; but I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce as it was a little too sweet for me.  The Panzotti was amazing... small ravioli pasta filled with rich creamy cheese.  Kristen selected the Scampo Duck with Plum and Peppercorn Sauces with Duck Fat Fries.  I had serious food envy... the duck was outstanding.

There is enough to make them sweet and flavorful, but you can taste the yeasty, doughy goodness - not just pure sugar.\\n\\nI also ordered a Caramel Latte, and the barista has a skillful hand.

Ordering around last call is not an excuse for shabby cooking. However, the waitstaff was attentive, and the ambience was amenable to conversation. The patrons were mixed with date nights, girls' nights out, and party hardy groups alike. Menu = 2, Service = 4, Ambience/crowd = 3.\\n\\nBAR: I'm in even more love with this bar now! The bartenders are still very attentive and personable. The whiskey sour was perfectly blended with a real maraschino cherry (i.e., not the flashy red ones we're accustomed to).

This may possibly be the worst location in town for a number of reasons. I have to preface by saying that I'm a huge Chipotle fan, and I usually go there about once a week, and unfortunately, this is the only one close to my house.\\n\\nYou'll notice if you look through Yelp reviews of Chipotles that most of them have around 20 or so reviews, but this one in particular has over 50. That's usually the case for fast casual and fast food (not many reviews). There's not much to comment on... but not here. \\n\\nFirst off, as everyone has noted, the parking lot is atrocious. If you somehow manage to get a parking spot, odds are you'll nearly hit someone or get hit trying to leave. But let's face it, you're rarely going to get a parking spot here and have to park on Northwest across the street and make the trek back across a busy intersection. \\n\\nOnce you get in here, the line moves so slowly that it starts to back up through the tables of people eating. It gets to the point where, if you decide to dine in, you'll have people standing next to you for your entire meal (more than likely with their ass next to your face). \\n\\nYet after all these times, I've managed to just deal with it, because I like Chipotle, but this past Sunday, after waiting in line for an unnecessarily long time (they had just opened), we were treated so rudely by the lady wrapping the burritos that I was just pissed off the entire time. She already seemed annoyed that she was working at all, and she tried to charge my girlfriend for steak, and when my girlfriend said it was chicken, she kept saying, \\"No, it's steak!\\" to the cashier. I had to step in and all but tell the woman to unwrap the damn burrito and have a look for herself.\\n\\nDid I also mention the pico de gallo at this place is basically just diced tomatoes and nothing else? My roommate and I have noticed that it doesn't look anything like the salsa at any other Chipotle.\\n\\nThe one shining moment of this Chipotle is the line cook in the back. The tall guy back there always has a smile on his face, and he always comes out to remove food from people's tables and ask them how their meal is. Isn't that the manager's job? Who knows? I haven't seen management there. The closest person to looking like management was the lady that was incredibly rude.\\n\\nI've gone on a rant long enough, and I really hope Chipotle does something to fix this location.

The server was really accommodating though and gave me my meal plus a dessert of my choice for free.  I appreciated that considering my meal was close to $30 if I remember correctly.  My husband ordered the tuna (not the appetizer), which was more of a sushi style tuna because the piece of fish he got was 3\\"+ in some areas and cold throughout the whole thing.

Good pizza can make up for a multitude of sins.  \\n\\nI am greeted by the young staff; they were polite and helpful in explaining the menu options and cooking instructions.  I ordered a large pizza with pepperoni and green peppers, paid, then sat down to wait for the pizza to be put together.  The chairs where one can wait are in front of a window with a large recessed sill which was littered by dead flies and other insects.  It's quite off-putting, but I'm after work tired and reviews say good things about the pizza.\\n\\nAfter a short wait, the pizza is made and the cashier offers a free order of breadsticks with marinara because it's my first time in.  Certainly thoughtful.\\n\\nUpon arriving home, I preheat the oven and plan on cooking the breadsticks first, then the pizza.  They come out and the pizza goes in.  We open the container of marinara sauce, try to dip the breadsticks into the sauce, and the bread kind of bounces off the sauce.  We laugh and think perhaps the sauce is frozen, and decide to microwave it when we discover the sauce isn't frozen or even cold, it's congealed.  It's the consistency of a jello shot and stomach turning to realize how old this sauce must be.\\n\\nWe followed the directions and exact cooking time on the pizza, but the cheese wasn't melted on top.  So, we left it in for two more minutes.  By that point, it was burnt and inedible.

Also, there was a complimentary happy hour buffet served until 7.  It has salad, some veggies, lasagna, bread and bbq beef.  There was definitely enough food out that you could eat here and skip dinner.  We did order some of the calamari and should've stuck to the buffet instead.

The set up of the tasting just takes a little longer but it also gives you a more personable experience with the bartender as well. I got the meatloaf dinner as well as the mussels and my friend ordered the half chicken. All of the food just lacks flavor, or the bang and ummumm good sensation that I need. It's just okay. The sausage meatloaf with spinach was good but sat on a bed of bland mashed potatoes and green beans. The mussels had a great sauce but also lacked the flavor I looked for. The half chicken and truffle mac and cheese are the two dishes that I would order here and be satisfied with. Both had good flavor!

Some of our first impressions: The guy at the counter who we ordered from was not very friendly.  The chai latte was bland and they did not offer soy milk.  There was no obvious place to pick up silverware and plates, and when we asked for some, we received some that were dirty, so we had to ask for more.  The samosas that came out were lukewarm and we never received any napkins.\\n\\nAll of this would have actually been okay, but then my friend took the first bite from his goat curry and discovered a rubberband in his food.  After pulling the curry soaked object from his mouth, we all were a little wary of the bowls of food in front of us.

He said he would let the manager know and asked our friend if he would like a new plate.  \\n\\nHowever, no manager ever approached us and no second plate of food was brought out.

It's inexpensive, delicious, and there are mimosas to be had. With that said, We have been to just about every place there is to go for brunch in Austin, TX.  So I do feel like I am a bit of an expert in this arena. So here are my thoughts on Wildwood Bakehouse (we have been a few times recently):\\n\\n1.) so the small buffet is not so appealing when you first see it, but once it's on the plate it is very appetizing.\\n\\n2.) this is perhaps some of the best brunch I have EVER had. The food is ahhhhmazing! Now, I am not a fan of buffets. I get overwhelmed and usually feel underwhelmed once I sit down. Not here! Every single item they offer is delicious. The last person who gave this place 2 stars for brunch must have a palet for cardboard and Burger King or something. \\n\\n3.) I lived in El Paso, TX for 25 years. Now I know spectacular Mexican food. I am so sick of Austin's \\"Tex Mex\\" crap. This is the real deal at Wildwood. And not only is the Mexican food delicious, it's not terrible for you. They use brown rice and good, sustainable quality of food (Greenling approved!). And it all works well together. You never get this smorgasbord of mismatched stuff. Is it Sunday again??\\n\\n4.) my most favorite heavenly thing to get here is the French toast. Now every time I come, the chef has always offered to make it fresh from scratch for us. Even if there are already a few pieces left on the buffet. I love that and it shows they really care about your experience. I judge a place by its French toast. So many places get a big red F here for me because its usually lame and typical. Oh not here! I can't place the bread but its unique and its oh so cinnamony and glazed just right (not too sweet). Today it was served with the freshest, most beautiful strawberries and the best whipped cream I have ever had.\\n\\n5.) mmmmmm.......the coffee here is delicious! Pecan coffee and I love getting their espresso Americano served up in a big old mug. I like the mimosas, but it does need more champagne. Kind of lacking in this area. But hey, it's free!\\n\\n6.) you don't have to wait a million years to eat here.

However the seating situation left much to be desired.

No sign saying \\"please sign in here\\" or anything. It was very upsetting. After waiting almost 30minutes the people who came in after us were sat at a booth before us and we were stuck at the community table by the waiter with the lotus tattoo on his arm. He saw us waiting before those other people and still took them first. That is not the way to keep customers, and then to sit them in the middle of the room. Luckily our waiter gave exceptional service, and ever came over and cut and flipped over our BBQ, which I had never had happen in almost 20 years of having Korean BBQ.

I believe it might be fried without batter, but still was pretty juicy and crispy.  Gravy was awesome and I think the second best thing about the meal.  It has a depth of flavor and lots of little chunks of sausage. Bacon was highlight for me. It has a deep smoky flavor.  Biscuits were not quite what I expected.  Maybe a little denser than I expected. Egg was good, but I could do without it.  The Tilamook chedder was extra heart attack waiting to happen.  Overall I liked it, but might get the non deluxe version of the Reggie next time.\\n\\nWe also tried the Chetfield. Apple butter has a sweetness that balances out the savory elements.

I became the yelp duke once and wasn't sure if it was a good thing (because the food is SLAMMIN), or a bad thing (because I may need to get my cholesterol checked).  I decided I would hit the gym a little harder and go with the former because this place is bomb!\\n\\nOn weekends, be sure to go early because a line forms very quickly after opening.  As far as Pine State etiquette goes: you order and pay for your food at the counter before finding a seat, and bus your own table after eating.\\n\\nI've had almost everything on the menu.  You really can't go wrong, except for maybe the shrimp-n-grits.  I'm not a grits connoisseur, but I've also had it at Screen Door and prefer theirs to these hence the 0.5 star deduction.  Not a perfect 5 stars, but damn near perfect!\\n\\nHighlights: \\"Reggie Deluxe\\" - This is a meal in itself.  MASSIVE!!  Fried chicken, bacon, egg & cheese topped with gravy all nestled in between one of their signature biscuits.  If this is your first time here, get this!  $9\\n\\"Shiitake mushroom gravy\\" - Pretty self explanatory.  Vegetarian version of country gravy.  When doing a side by side taste test, I preferred the mushroom gravy over the sausage gravy.  As a side: small $2, large $4\\n\\"Hash ups\\" - I love their steak.  It's very nicely seasoned and marinated in something I can't really put my finger on.  Probably unicorn milk or something on that same magical level.  Golden hash browns with chopped steak, grilled onions, mushrooms and melted cheese.  $7\\n\\"Blueberry cornmeal pancakes\\" - I was feeling adventurous one day and decided to order these and boy was I pleasantly surprised.  I love pancakes and these are insane!  Very different from other pancakes because of the made from scratch cornmeal batter, and the local blueberries set this dish off!!  Stack of 3 pancakes $6\\n\\"Sweet potato biscuit\\" - Seasonal fave.  Just like their signature biscuits, but sweet potato mixed into the dough. (not sure on pricing)\\n\\nWhile the prices are already very reasonable, they also have happy hour when you can get some of their most popular dishes for a couple dollars off.\\n\\nSouthern comfort food at its best!!!"},{"name":"Philly Connection","address":"2980 Cobb Pkwy, Ste 200","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I have a vague memory of this place.

I also remember cringing, along with many others in the community, when the beautiful, historic, brick structure was then painted all white. \\n\\nWell, two years later and the iconic 1930's train depot in Reynoldstown is now the home to not one but two restaurant concepts--Muchacho by day, Golden Eagle by night. The restaurants recently opened late last year and did not disappoint. This review is for the Golden Eagle only, the after 5pm bar that \\"opens\\" when Muchacho \\"closes.\\" There's a wall mural on the side of the building facing the parking lot that will direct you to the green entrance for Golden Eagle. The other side actually faces onto a spur of the Beltline (remember I said train depot?).\\n\\nThe interior of the space was fairly interesting. There are sort of two sides; we sat in the more intimate living room / lounge area (right) as opposed to the more formal dining room (left). The lounge area had ample seating--variously sized couches, banquettes, arm chairs, and small, wooden side tables. I think it could accommodate small to somewhat large groups fairly flexibly. The aesthetic is a mix of mid-century and a sort of 60's/70's dining club. A lot of dark green velvet and red plaid. Sounds a bit weird as I describe it but somehow was working well together in the space. The lighting, I think, is what makes it feel so enchanting, as the candles and pendant lighting reflect off silver half globes on the walls and metal starbursts hung from the ceiling. Definitely a good date location. \\n\\nAs for the menu, we arrived a little after midnight, so the kitchen was already closed.  The food menu did look enticing so will return to try it soon. Luckily for us, on Fridays and Saturdays they do have an after Midnight snack available: \\"pigs in a blanket.\\" We got one order for each of us. Each order is a rather delicious milk bun wrapped around small pieces of sausage served with a side of mayo. I am here for it, all about those buns. \\n\\nThe drink menu looked great both visually and in terms of variety. We came specifically for the cocktails ($10-$12) and were very pleased. This establishment is owned by the creator of Ladybird (another restaurant bar on the Beltline), so there's a similarity in the graphics that will feel familiar if you've been to both, including little cartoons of each cocktail.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the Blue Hawaiian ($12) and I ordered an off menu recommendation, one provided by our excellent waitress based on my love of whiskey, the Remember the Maine (rye whiskey, vermouth, cherry heering liquor, and absinthe). They were both really good, solid cocktails and service was quick and often. We very much enjoyed the experience--solid cocktails, nice snack, pleasant service, and intriguing ambiance.

Also, I normally don't eat grits so I can't really compare how this is compared to what grits should be like. But, the overall dish was flavorful and make sure to not forget to squeeze the lemon and mix it in. Shrimps were a good sized. I had about 5 pieces.

Terms that not only describe erectile dysfunction but cheeses with a range of density and textures.

I don't want to just review based on the worst or best experience because neither of those are necessarily indicative.\\n\\nMy first couple of experiences at this restaurant were with beef dishes, and that's no accident.  After ordering an incredible beef tenderloin with crab meat and b√©arnaise sauce on my first visit, I thought to myself, \\"This is a kitchen that knows their beef.\\"  It was beautifully, expertly cooked to the medium rare that I requested, and was so soft and tender that I found myself cutting the thinnest possible slices I could manage, just to make it last longer. \\n\\nThe tournedos was an equally amazing dish, a tenderloin on shredded short ribs with mushrooms and a wine sauce.  Again, I found myself going as slow as possible to draw out the enjoyment of the meal.\\n\\nI haven't always stuck with the beef, though.  The Oscar-style scallops are another favorite, and always hit that just-right sear on the outside without being cooked to the point of rubbery on the inside. My wife often has a hard time passing up this dish, regardless of her usual initial intention to try something new. The duck is also beautifully done, and may very well be the dish that I revisit the next time we eat here.\\n\\nThe only dish that I was less impressed by was the rabbit.  The meat itself, like everything I have seen so far, was cooked with precision, and was extremely tender and moist.  The macaroni and cheese with ham, a side elevated to be worthy of the price point of the dish, was exceptional in every way. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, maybe it was the sauce drowning the meat, but the meal wasn't as amazing as I had come to expect.  Don't get me wrong, it was good... it just didn't have the \\"wow\\" factor that the other dishes have had. Also the rabbit was to have been served boneless, but two tiny bits were missed when preparing the dish, so I had a couple of unexpected surprises.\\n\\nThe escargot appetizer is an absolute must here, a six-pack of buttery perfection. Save some of the bread on the table to soak up what's left in the cup after you eat the snail.  It's incredible.\\n\\nWe're not usually much for deserts, but on one visit we did decide to share a raspberry souffl√© (best to order at the beginning of the meal, as they take quite some time to prepare). It was exquisite, luckily a little less sweet than we had thought it would be, light and delicious. Then the waiter came out with a chocolate one (the kitchen had inadvertently made two and we were offered the extra for free), and it was right on par with the other one.  I've had to change our feelings on the matter of desert, now: \\"We're not usually much for deserts, unless it's a souffl√© at Le Coq Au Vin\\"."},{"name":"Margarita Factory - Downtown Vancouver","address":"1004 Washington St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Best service!

I mean, a star is valuable freaking thing, but it's pretty flippy-dippin' important to only give accolades when my throne is sufficiently sniffed.  If I just give away my stars like high school girls cast their pearls at swine on prom night, how in the name of freak am I going to make it into that hall of holies, that pantheon of palates, that great gastric gymnasium in the sky: Yelp Elite.\\n\\nBeing Elite must be pretty cool, because I hear all these guys in polo shirts yelling it out the windows of Tahoe's a lot, and they seem like they are having a pretty good time with all that Natty Lite and stuff.  I wish I could be Elite.  I dare to dream, my friends.\\n\\nSo apologies to the good-hearted brethren of Manuel's who so lovingly reached out to the douche community- I hate to return your kindness with only two of my very, very important stars.

He asked me to tell my friends to come out and try their food, and I let him know that I'd come back. I left with great food and a place I wanted to come back to. For the combo plate I ordered, it was love at first bite. \\n\\nI told my friends, and I came back, but no more Halal Guys in West Campus. It wasn't until later that I found out they were now downtown. I never venture downtown, so it was a love that ended quickly.\\n\\nHowever, a month ago, I noticed \\"The Halal Guys\\" sign as I drove down Guadalupe, accompanied with a \\"coming soon\\" sign.

It's a small location, and they're still figuring things out. There's maybe 2-3 parking spots in front, and there's enough seating for ~20 people in bar seating and tables. There was a lot of people coming in and out for lunch at 1230pm, but with the fast service, it wasn't getting crowded. \\n\\nMy order came within minutes and at $8.23 for the combo plate alone.

The food came out piping hot, carried out in an aluminum box. \\n\\nI'm now back at my office, enjoying the chicken and lamb over rice. Folks, there's a lot of food. The red sauce is spicy, but it's not overkill on the heat. I'd actually recommend getting extra red sauce if that's your thing. The white sauce is rich and savory.

Decent prices. A very unique ambiance for Cambridge. Great music selection. The bar, though, is awesome. Amazing rotating selection of local beers, interesting artisanally-carved taps, and even a huge wheel that you can spin a la Wheel of Fortune in case you're overwhelmed by the wealth of options. A great place to grab a seat and catch up with an old friend.\\n\\nThere seems to be a crowd of regulars at the bar, too, including one dude that I sat next to that always ordered the salsa verde (which looked amazing! Note to self: order that next time) and brought in his own hot sauce to go along with it.

We love Portland because it's a wonderful city near home with equally wonderful people. It also has a great food all over much like New Orleans dose. We had 3 children a teen a 5 year old and an 18 month old with us. We took the children shopping at the Loyd center mall and enjoyed very much that our dollar went farther paying no sales tax, we stayed until it closed. Our idea to pig out at street carts was crushed when we got there and only two of the trucks were open. So we went back to our best friend Yelp and just typed in \\"American food\\" we looked for good reviews and one that was open late we saw this one. One way streets, GPS and a city full of people on a Saturday night did not mix well for us so we got lost, but made it only 10 minutes late. Parking is free when validated thank you very much. The elevator was very fast going up the 30 flights we loved that. We saw a lot of people dressed up very well. We in contrast were in jeans running shoes and hoodies, My teen and I were both in yoga pants so we felt out of place. We smiled when we saw it was dark to help with the ambiance and the great views. We were seated near a window not at one' but it was good enough to enjoy the views. The noise level was great in this busy restaurant  because it masked the sounds of my children as they spoke up loudly a few times. The server we had was very good about helping us make our choices. We asked her about child friendly items to witch she verbally told us about buttered pasta with Parmesan cheese, grilled cheese, and cheese burgers great choices for children  from the bar menu. We ordered drinks very good ones with top shelf liquors very yummy soda for the children and water for me the assistant server kept my water coming , a blue cheese iceberg wedge with pork belly and roasted tomatoes, the beat salad with pesto, pistachios, Parmesan, frizza and a nice wedge of brie cheese. Both salads were nice not over done or lacking in substance in any way. Well beyond the worth of $9 and $10 they were priced at. The little ones were given there grilled cheese and cheeseburgers along with our salads. My teen loved the sourdough bread and had more with the spreadable whipped butter. We were told that the 10 oz sirloins were prime steaks at $34 and the short ribs were tender also around $34. So I went with the prim top sirloin medium rare rather then the wonderful sounding seared goat cheese and  prosciutto stuffed chicken with lemon sauce for around $27 It would have been a great choice though. My teen also ordered the top sirloin medium rare we also ordered the short ribs. We had  a choice of what starch we wanted and were told the mashed potatoes are very good so we all went with it. Good size portions this is not a place that you will leave having to hit up a McDonald's after ( I hate that about some other restaurants I have been too) we could not finish are meals none of us not even my 5 year old, but we did save room for sweets we had banana cream with peanut, strawberry rhubarb tart with mascarpone geloto and were given a complementary chocolate mousse. Everything was very good and well worth the $189 plus the nice tip, They were child friendly even though you may get the impression they are not form the looks of the place.

Let me say that this meal exceeded our expectations. Gaslight did everything right this time. I had the scallops and they were cooked perfectly, just right... sweet and buttery and just really good. My friends got the pork chop and risotto as they did last time. The risotto was creamy and delicious and the cook on the pork chop was absolutely perfect- and that was a serious pork chop. We shared the cheese plate, it was simple and delicious. And the truffle fries were amazing- not overly truffled. There arent words for the aioli. It was outstanding.

Then I noticed they forgot the first roll I ordered, the one I said was my favorite. So, I went back in and asked for it again. They were about to close and the chef was standing in front of me. The cashier told me they couldn't make it for me even though they forgot it because they were closed and the chef was done. He kept refusing. I walked back to the car and my boyfriend got out again to ask for the roll and tell them they also got the shrimp tempura wrong because I hadn't mentioned it, I was mostly confused about the yellowtail. The cashier started yelling at him, telling him he refused to give us the roll and that we were the ones who were mistaken. He claimed he repeated the order back to us and it was our fault which never happened. He was super impolite to my boyfriend even though he was the one who messed up the entire order, not just one roll.

She truly added to my dining experience and it was refreshing to hear information about the food I was about to consume with knowledge and passion.\\n\\nMy friend and I started with a plate of breads and spreads.  House-made brioche and ciabatta were our carbs for the evening.  We kindly refused the refried beans and asked if we could \\"double-up\\" on the other choices. We got a homemade curry blueberry butter along with a local strawberry jam.  The breads were fresh and the spreads had great textures and taste. A perfect start.\\n\\nOur next small plate, was actually a small basket, of hand-cut potatoes fries with fresh oregano & saffron aioli. These were quite possibly the best, hearty, crisp and indulgent fries of my life.  The show stopper for me was the saffron aioli. I normally eat my fries with no accompanying sauce, but this aioli was the perfect extra flavor pop.\\n\\nFor my main small plate I got the Pork Belly Adobo; soy-glazed pork belly, calamansi juice, micro cilantro, carrot puree, black rice, and scallions.  There was so much going on in this dish and it blended together so beautifully.  The pork belly was so tender and flavorful, and the black rice (which I had never had) added a nice texture. This dish was far beyond my culinary prowess. You can just eat cilantro?  YES, you CAN! The only problem with this dish was that I was left wanting more. Darn small plates.\\n\\nI suppose it was a blessing in disguise that I was still drooling over the pork belly as she took my plate away, because I had the perfect amount of room in my stomach to fit in dessert. My friend ordered the chocolate pistachio torte while I went for a classic creme brulee.\\n\\nI've had some really good creme brulee in my 31 years, but this was perfection.  I almost didn't want to try my friends dessert because I didn't want to take this taste away from my buds for a second.  Not only was it rich and creamy but it was very generous in portion. The chocolate torte was amazingly intense.  I would probably order it for pick up on a monthly basis...if you know what I mean.\\n\\nIt's places like Scratch that get me really excited about the the food scene in Orlando. Less fast casual, quick serve in-and-out, turn those tables as fast as you can for a mediocre experience. More about fresh ingredients, made by talented passionate people, who want you to have an experience; not simply be a guest count. Scratch offers all of that and more.

Our original plan was to attend a special event at Oblivion. But, when we realized there was a 1hr 45 min wait to be seated, we headed to Tibby's, as it had been FOREVER since any of us had been there.\\n\\nI want to like Cajun food. I have had some food in Louisiana that I absolutely loved, and I guess that set the bar high. But I'll get to the food in a moment.\\n\\nFirst, we arrived on a Saturday early evening. It was SLAMMED!

The hostess and staff were incredibly friendly and went out of their way to amke sure we had a table that would allow us to put the car seat in a chair, safely.\\n\\nOur server was nice, funny and very attentive. Always a plus. I ordered an appetizer of friend green tomatoes and crawfish, and my friend Peter got fried pickles. Both came out quickly and were very good. I think I actually liked his pickles more than my tomatoes, but the crawfish were awesome.\\n\\nFor main dish I ordered the standard seafood gumbo and Peter ordered a blackened chicken dish. Just so you don't think my wife starved, she's vegan and had already eaten a light snack, so she just munched on plain fries..quite happily I'll add. \\n\\nThe food was..good. I am always overwhelmed with what to order at places like this. I wanted to get a specialty dish, but we are trying to save a bit of money. The gumbo was tasty. I think I was just in the mood for something else. Next time I go there, I am going with my gut, regardless of price.\\n\\nOH! and I forgot to mention we arrived at happy hour. Being a New Orleans/Louisiana-themed restaurant, they had 18oz Abita draft beers for $3. Umm yes please!\\n\\nLastly- be prepared to have to speak loudly and/or yell.

Very healthy restaurant :)."},{"name":"Narcoossee's","address":"4401 Grand","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Narcoossee's lived up to every high expectation I set for it. Booking the reservation months in advance, it's very difficult to choose which restaurants to pick, especially if you don't have any prior Disney World experience to work with. Yelp and other sites are helpful, but if restaurant meals are key elements on your vacation itinerary like they are on mine, fear of disappointment can still cause a little anxiety heading into a new dining spot.\\n\\nMaking the reservation about three months in advance, I was already limited to either very early or somewhat late times at either California Grill or Narcoossee's. They both had great views of the fireworks at the castle, but I was more attracted to the menu at Narcoossee's and I liked the fact that you also got a chance to be on the lake with a prime viewing spot of the electrical boat parade. What a special touch to have not one, but two fantastic shows to watch while enjoying your meal. If you book a reservation and don't mind eating late, I would strongly recommend booking a time that will allow you to see both shows. The fireworks show times can be found in advance on the Disney website at https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/search/?searchQuery=fireworks+times&autoSuggestedQuery=fireworks+times&typeOfLink=suggestedTerm  No need to worry too much about trying to score a window view in the dining room as most people filed out to the wrap-around patio that looks out over the lake. Servers were very accommodating about making sure meals were timed so that fireworks viewing didn't detract from food quality.\\n\\nWe started our meal with mussels and a Caesar salad to split. The mussels were phenomenal! Tender, meaty and swimming in a delicious broth with juicy slices of tomatoes and onion sprinkled in, they were a perfect appetizer. The salad was also impressive. Crisp, fresh romaine and garlicy croutons in a very savory dressing had us racing each other to get the last crunchy bite.\\n\\nAnother selling point for me was the two-pound lobster tail on the menu. We had set this night aside for our big splurge, and I knew going in that's what I was ordering. It was everything I hoped for. Buttery and succulent, that was the best lobster experience I've ever had. Although it was outshone by the gorgeous crustacean, there was also a small side dish of corn souffl√© that on any other plate would have been a highlight. Rich and creamy deliciousness, I only wished I had another stomach to put it in. The nicely steamed broccolini offered a little green break from all this decadence.\\n\\nThe BF got a veal rib chop that was so good he wasn't caught eye-balling my lobster once. Beautifully presented with a Frenched bone poking out, it was perfectly cooked. My bite (that I practically had to grovel for) was juicy and very flavorful.\\n\\nWe ended the meal with the amazing almond cheesecake. In addition to being the best dessert we had during our stay, it was also the prettiest plate. If someone appreciates artfully done presentation, this is the thing to order.\\n\\nIf traveling to the restaurant from Magic Kingdom, there's the option of going monorail or boat. We had a fantastic time coming across the lake in one of the boats. The boat captain was a humorous entertainer as well as a seasoned Disney vet who passed on some valuable tips during the short five minute trip. It's also nice to be dropped off at the lamp-lined pier that leads right up to the restaurant.\\n\\nService was friendly and professional. Our reservation was at 8:50 and since we were hoping for more of a romantic meal, it was nice to have a minimum amount of children at that hour. The boat parade does a procession around the lake, then hits Magic Kingdom to wrap up. It's visible from the restaurant as it sits by Magic Kingdom for a few photo opp moments.\\n\\nThank you to all the staff at Narcoossee's for giving us a truly memorable night. We definitely made the right decision."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Went to the Neptune Oyster with a friend for dinner.

That process was a little (OK, a lot!) scary, as I had other plans hinging on this one. They also only seat large parties at 5:30 (so they can reset for smaller parties during their peak hours) -- though given th along walk from parking and traffic tie-ups for just about all the guests (traffic in Orlando on a Saturday? A sure thing), our actually gathering inched closer to 6:30 than they probably would have preferred.

They are of such excellence in fact that I am tempted to go so far as to make wild and thoroughly unverified and generally unsubstantiated claims as to their superiority nationwide. Come to think of it, I WILL. Dino's has the best subs in the entire country. There.\\n\\nBack when my workplace was a mere 5 minute walk from Dino's, I would invariably find myself drawn there for lunch (or to carry home for dinner) at least 3 times a week. I would sometimes mix things up, get the Italian or the Chicken parm sub, but when introducing Dino's to a lunch guest, I would insist on ordering them the steak italiano, KING OF SUBS. To describe the steak italiano as a mere steak and cheese sub is to shamefully neglect the appropriately hyperbolic terms one could, nay - should apply instead. Of course, now that I've said that, I actually find that the words fail me. It is beyond words. It's what Gandhi would eat if he were still around today and had just finished a particularly long fast. Yes, specifically even though he was vegetarian. It's what a COW would eat, if no one were watching, and it had the money and opposable thumbs to take the money out of its wallet. It's that good.\\n\\nAlso, the meatball sub is good.\\n\\nBesides the succulent and plentiful meat that goes into their subs, the bread they use is incredible. It's light, and just so delicately flakey - but not too flakey - and serves as the perfect backdrop for whatever delicious sub you happen to have the pleasure of eating.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is what one would expect out of a small corner cafe in the North End. There are a few tables, although don't expect to be able to have anywhere to sit if you come any time around lunch. The subs are a little pricier than your average sandwich, but of course, these are not your average sandwich. In addition to being the best subs you will ever have the good fortune to taste, they're also 18 inches long, which means if you somehow manage to stave off the irresistable deliciousness of them before you find yourself eating the whole thing, you'll have some left over for dinner! Or to split with a friend.\\n\\nIf you're stricken with some horrible sort of reasonable and clear thinking aversion that prevents you from eating meat, the Lady Special sub is actually pretty good too. I can't vouch for them myself but companions have assured me their salads are actually also quite tasty.\\n\\nIf you happen to be in Boston, the only reason you could possibly have for not taking the time to stop by this mecca of subs is that you're feeeling unbearably guilty about something and wish to punish yourself as harshly as possible, and really, whatever it is you did, it can't be so horrible as to deny yourself a Dino's sub."},{"name":"OAK Long Bar + Kitchen","address":"138 St. James Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This review is for the food only.

Eating here was a really well rounded experience that wasn't significantly lacking in any area. \\n\\nFor starters, this place is very cute on the inside and fits well with the feel of the Mississippi area. I loved the colors in the restaurant and the view of the kitchen/pizza oven. The restaurant was very clean and I liked the ice cream case right up front in the waiting area so I could salivate before dinner. \\n\\nThe service here was absolutely outstanding, although I believe that the owner was the one waiting on us which I'm sure makes a difference. The gal who first sat us seemed a little frazzled, but I'll chalk it up to them being a few minutes late to open. Our server was very kind and professional, and really indulged us in answering all of our questions about the menu. She didn't just tell me what an ingredient was, she explained where it came from, how it is generally used, and what flavors it enhances and compliments.  I really learned a lot and felt truly taken care of. I also appreciated her encouragement to split an entr√©e and save room for dessert. We were planning on doing this anyway, but it was great not feeling like I was constantly being up sold and instead that she was more concerned that we had the best experience possible. \\n\\nNow to the food. Everything was very good, although what is holding me back from 5 stars was the pizza. We ordered the salami, mamas peppers, and olives. It was a red sauce pizza and I loved the crust. Thin and crispy on the bottom, and the crust had a nice crunchy outside and fluffy inside. Each ingredient on the pizza was spectacular by itself. The salami was a grade A++ homemade pepperoni with crazy flavor. The roasted peppers were delicious and I wish there had been more on the pizza as they tended to get slightly lost in the rest of the flavors. The olives were a rich, pitted greek olive...not at all like the ones you're used to on mass produced pizzas. Together, this made or a great pizza, although I found it too greasy for me between the cheese and the cooked olives. This may just be a personal thing, but my stomach started rebelling after half a pizza due to the grease. Next time I want to try one of their olive oil based pizzas. \\n\\nLast, we tried a scoop of the malted milk ball and the tarragon vanilla bean ice creams. The malted milk ball was delicious and texturally sound. We both, however, preferred the tarragon vanilla. My better half actually hates black licorice and usually wont be around me when I eat it, but the licorice flavor is subtle and delicious here. The best execution of this flavor in ice cream that I've seen. We both agreed that these flavors were both slightly better to those at Ruby Jewel, right down the street. To pump up the licorice flavor (because I can't get enough) I added the candy coated fennel seeds. Oh my god, best decision ever. Enhanced texture and flavor. Our server recommended I use a dish so the fennel seeds didn't fall off and get everywhere, so  I asked for my cone on the side. She gave my ice cream a waffle cone hat which put a smile on my face. The cone tasted good but I didn't like how small it was. It was actually doubly wrapped around itself, making it twice as thick and half as wide. This make it harder to eat in my opinion and left less room for stuffing with ice cream!\\n\\nOverall, a great experience and wonderful food and service. We will definitely be back for both ice cream and pizza."},{"name":"Mary's Cafe","address":"3209 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Such a cute little place.

The best things we had were the Matsutake mushroom dish, and the main bavette of beef course. The beef was rare and delicious! The optional fois gras course was also great. Three of us split one serving and it was the perfect little bite!"},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"This is my favorite restaurant in New England. Yes, the wait is going to be agonizing on any weekend night. But you give your cell number and can walk around for a while so who cares - just don't make other plans for later, and let's be honest this is probably the highlight of the night regardless.  I have to mention that the hostesses at Neptune are patient and unfailingly professional in dealing with cranky, hungry people in a tiny space. I just don't think the atmosphere would be even close if it were Legal Sea Food-sized so the trade-off is worth it. \\n\\nAnd the food, \\"worth it\\" would be an understatement. Good selection at the raw bar, served flawlessly at surprisingly-not-that-bad prices.  All the various crudo and other specials of the day hit the mark.  The hot lobster roll is, in my opinion, the no.1 singular dish to recommend to an out-of-towner on their first day in Boston. \\n\\nNeptune deserves its religious following.

While I'm no BBQ expert, I've been fortunate enough to have had BBQ in the South and Midwest before so I've tasted some decent BBQ before.\\n\\nAs others have mentioned, it's in the sketchier side of Hastings St close to the DTES so you'll have  to dodge the occasional homeless person to get here.  The homeless folk here in Vancouver are pretty harmless so don't let this detract you from coming here.  The restaurant itself is decorated like your typical Outback steakhouse.\\n\\nThe service was great - I sat at the bar since I came in solo.  The bartender (I think her name was Siobhan) was extremely nice and attentive and came to check on me every so often and refill my drinks.  Food did take a little while to arrive but honestly, for me this isn't necessarily a bad thing.  You don't want something that comes out so quickly it seems like they just microwaved it and brought it out.\\n\\nI had the 1/2 lb brisket, 1/2 rack of ribs and a piece of the fried chicken.  Although it doesn't mention it on the menu, you can get the chicken by the piece.  As most reviews here have already mentioned, the brisket is fantastic.  It's moist, juicy and flavourful.  It's probably one of the best brisket I've tried in Vancouver.  I'd highly recommend it if you come here.  The fried chicken like others have mentioned is boneless which I was surprised by but it's well seasoned with a little bit of a kick.  This too was very good.  Another must try at this place.   Surprisingly I was most disappointed with the ribs.  They were on the dry side and pretty tough.  Usually, most of the time when I have ribs, they meat is pretty tender.  I had a hard time cutting the ribs with the knife.  It seems others have had the opposite so I'm going to count this as maybe a bad day and perhaps give it a try again another time.\\n\\nOverall, I think the place is certainly worth a try.  Vancouver isn't really known as a BBQ mecca so you'll never find fantastic BBQ here.  However, compared what what we can choose from, it holds it's own pretty well.  I think maybe because the place is fairly new, they're struggling with maintaining consistency with their food.  I'll give this place another try in the summer and hopefully I'll have better luck with the ribs."},{"name":"Sushi Tsunami","address":"7415 NE Hwy 99","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Try the jalapeno, it is delicious!

My fave dishes are the mushroom bomb, jalapeno and volcano roll...but their soups are also great for if your feeling peckish and weak. Try the udon soup.

I make it a point to research the places I am going in search for good restaurants to dine at so to avoid the chain places so many people settle for. Le Coq Au Vin is a place I found on Yelp before I left for my trip so I made reservations for myself and a few other fellow foodies.\\n\\nThis place is amazing! It is a very casual atmosphere in which I would consider French country along with the menu. The service was spectacular, from the moment we were seated till the check came; we never were looking about for someone to help us. \\n\\n To the menu, all I can say is, everything I love about food is on this menu. I had the Foie Gras which was served pt style with crispy bread and fig preserves. It was incredible even though I prefer my Foie Gras served whole. I then had what they call \\"duck two ways\\"; duck leg confit with crispy honey skin, and breast served medium rare, cut on a bias with a grand marnier sauce. I was licking my plate at the end it was so good. \\n\\nDesert - raspberry souffls - if you don't get this, you will be missing out. This is the best souffls I have ever had, and yes, I licked this bowl clean too. \\n\\nOne last thing about this superb restaurant is the overall vibe I got while dinning there. The place is like a house with each room a dinning room which I'm sure has been mentioned on this page already. The feeling you get from this is the sense you are having dinner with your family, I can't explain how comfortable I felt there. What really hit this home was what happened to me on the patio while waiting for my cab. \\n\\nThe restaurant has an outside patio that because of the cool weather at night this time of year was not being used but all the tables and chairs were still out. On a few of the tables, there appeared to be very large ashtrays. Being a smoker, I lit up and started to enjoy my after dinner smoke when in the corner of the patio, I say two cats wrestling. These two cats looked almost identical, mostly black with the same white puff under their chins and on their paws. Having cats at home and missing them, I tried to get closer to see if these cats were friendly. As I got to one of the tables with the big ashtrays, I called to them and to my surprise, they both came running toward me and jumped on the table to get a little petting. That's when I noticed that the big ashtrays were actually kitty water and food dishes, set out for what I could only tell to be the house cats. And at that moment, I realized I found a truly special place. A place, that if you are traveling will make you feel like you are at home. \\n\\nAmazing place!\\n\\nOh yeah, I forgot one important item.

It's not 'bad' per say, but like others have said, it's forgettable.

For example, we all had the soup of the day, which was a tomato bisque, and it was too sweet for my (and my wife's) taste, but as our calzones and pizza came, we all noticed that the soup tasted like the sauce on the calzones, which tasted like the sauce on the pizza... and all were too sweet... almost ketchupy like.  The calzone tasted like I made it (which isn't a particularly good thing), like all the basic ingredients were just stuffed into some dough and baked... just kind of blah.\\n\\nLike I said, I want to like this place.

Maybe in one of my past lives, I had gluttonfests involving various dishes from the region.\\n\\nI found owner Mo Menzalji to be an easygoing individual. Not much of a line when my friend and I showed up hungry beyond comprehension.\\n\\nI opted for the Super Halal Lamb Gyro ($7), lamb strips with hummus, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, and tzatziki in a rolled pita. This particular pita is more wrap-like, thinner than the thicker pita that you may find at Greek food establishments. Personally, I just prefer the thicker pita.\\n\\nMy lamb pleaded for more seasoning. It was cut in chunks (not strips), with some pieces being juicy and others slightly dry. I liked the tomatoes and grated cucumber here, but felt like the hummus and tzatziki needed to assert itself more flavor-wise.\\n\\nI probably should have asked for Mo to include feta cheese in my gyro, even though I didn't see that as an option. He does have it; the feta is on his Greek Salad ($7; $9.50 when adding chicken or lamb).\\n\\nFor being called a \\"super\\" gyro, it didn't feel like a larger portion. I can easily point out three other places for gyros that would live up such a \\"super\\" name. The gyro was OK, but didn't necessarily wow me.\\n\\nAs for my friend, he got the Super Falafel ($6.50), also wrapped in a pita with tahini, lettuce, cucumber, and tomato. He said the falafel was a bit dry. Being ravenous pandas, we still ate everything.\\n\\nMo also has baklava ($2), Turkish coffee ($2), and smoothies ($5), if you have cravings for those.\\n\\nAgain, the food was not bad, but merely being OK in a city filled with great choices lessens the chances for a repeat visit."},{"name":"Tsuki Sushi Bar","address":"509 Abbott Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Wow their sushi is really good!

If you're getting breakfast, then maybe your pancakes or french toast will be hot, but the eggs and meat will be ice cold. The nachos are bland. How do you make bland nachos? But they do. Bland, cold nachos. The ice tea is not very good, but I'm also an iced tea snob. It's got that musky taste like they haven't cleaned the brewing carafe. The coffee is bad. Imagine if they served coffee at the DMV....I think that sums it up. In my opinion, good coffee, good tea, and hot breakfast are all things that should be standard at a diner...right? Service is somewhere between apathetic and surly, depending on who you get. It's pretty loud in there, so it's hard to follow a conversation with your meal companion unless you're also yelling at each other, and thereby contributing to the overall noise. Last time we were there, one of the servers literally started BANGING ON THE CARPET WITH A HAMMER. It was really loud and unpleasant. I get it, loose carpet nails are a safety concern....but surely there's a slow time when they could have done this, not when they've got a dining room full of people yelling at each other. Price wise, it's on the expensive side for diner fare, and the dinner specials are $15+. \\n\\nOn the bright side, the french toast is pretty good. There's never been a wait any of the many times we've gone, but we also don't go during peak brunch hours. It's more laid back than Kerby Lane, but with some obvious sacrifices.

I have tried most of the vegan items on the menu and generally go back to the loaded hash browns (a huge pile of hash browns, you pick the toppings - why oh why doesn't every place have this?!). The chai pancakes are pretty delicious too. Non-veg friends have been pleased with the omelettes and other offerings as well. They had coffee outside to keep you warm while you waited, and service was fast and furious (you were not encouraged to linger, given the lack of seating). Jam was a pretty much grownups only space with strong drinks (note: the Bloody Marys are NOT vegan, but the mimosas are huge) and huge portions.\\n\\nFast forward to now. Jam is about 4 times the size it used to be since it moved into the cavernous space next door. The pleasantly snarky menu lists the rules of the house: limited substitutions, don't bring a big group (they won't accommodate more than 6 people), no reservations, etc. You no longer have to wait an hour and a half in the freezing cold warming your hands on a coffee cup (most of the time), but this has come with some sacrifices. The space isn't very well temperature controlled, so it can be freezing or way too warm. The service isn't as fast, and they don't seem to have enough waitstaff. They no longer serve Stumptown, and the brew isn't as good as it once was. There are children EVERYWHERE, and even a designated play area, which is great if you want to take your friends who never go out anymore since they had kids, but not so great if you want to take the casual date who spent the night before tangled in your sheets. It's kind of loud and echoey for conversation. Also, the portion sizes seem to have shrunk by roughly the same amount that Jam's space has grown. \\n\\nStill, where else can you take your drinking friends, your parent friends, your vegan, veg, gluten free, and omni friends all to brunch together? Nowhere, really. So I still count Jam as one of my favorite spots. Plus, they still have the loaded potatoes I love, and a huge ass mimosa to go with them."},{"name":"Commune Kitchen","address":"203A Broadway","city":"Arlington","stars":"4.5","text":"Best poutine I've had in the area.

However, in New England, it's truly exceptional...the sort of authentic Southern barbecue you normally can't get in the North.\\n\\nI've been here several times, and had the lunch combo, the pork plate, and the pork sandwich. The lunch combo, as others have noted, is huge -- a massive plate of assorted ribs and, sometimes, sausage and chicken. The combo ribs can, admittedly, be a bit dry at times, but you're typically given some fattier, jucier ribs as well. Plan on taking home enough for at least another meal -- I'm a big eater, and have never finished either the combo or the pork plate. The pork sandwich is also huge -- it plus two sides is a pretty massive lunch.\\n\\nMost meals seem to come with cornbread (at least, I've always gotten cornbread with every meal)...the cornbread's rather good, but Northerners may be a little surprised to find that it's unsweetened and contains less flour than they're used to. It's still a fairly soft cornbread -- clearly it contains flour -- but it's denser and crumblier than much of the \\"cornbread\\" served around these parts.\\n\\nThe sauces are a pleasant surprise. Normally, I'm used to bbq places having a single style of sauce, possibly with subtle variations. Redbones offers four sauces in very different styles -- the mild and hot are both red, Deep-South-style sauces, the sweet is a dark, St-Louis-style sauce, and the vinegar is a North Carolina vinegar sauce. Try them all -- my favorites are the mild and the vinegar. (Even though I'd never cared for NC-style sauces before coming here.) The sauces are served in little paper cups, but they'll bring you extra if you ask.\\n\\nMy primary gripe with Redbones would be the sides: some of the sides offered (e.g., the collard greens, fries, and mac & cheese) are really, really good. However, most meals are served with slaw & beans, both of which are really subpar. You can substitute, but it costs $1 per substitution. Substituting is very much worth it, but I almost just wish they'd raise their prices a little and let you pick your own sides. Incidentally, they don't serve the collard greens with pepper vinegar, so I usually just ask for an extra thing of the vinegar sauce.\\n\\nOh, and they have sweet tea. Real, properly brewed sweet tea.\\n\\nConclusion: very much worth it, but a little on the pricey side, and add $2 for substitutions when considering prices."},{"name":"Classic Cafe","address":"1313 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"3","text":"Food was good especially the pancakes !!!

The whole ambience reminded me of going to a friend's house for dinner.  I really like that neighborhood feel to the restaurant.\\n\\nOk, on to the food.  Note that they change their menu all the time so it's unlikely one would be able to order the same thing.  I like how they make their bread on-site.  We were served 3 kinds.  My fav was the seaweed one.  Interesting combination but it worked.\\n\\nWe ordered the parsnip soup which was delicious.  I really like how they used clove and it added a nice spicy finish to it.  We also got the home made burrata, which is home made mozzarella with shaved veggies.  We love cheese so this was the perfect dish for us.  The contrast in texture between the mushy cheese and crisp veggies was excellent.  \\n\\nThey ran out of the mallard duck so they gave me the duck confit instead.  We also got the mutton shoulder and the scallops dishes.  They offer half sizes for their entrees, which allows for guests to sample more dishes.  The dishes here are very small though.  I had expected to be more full given all we ordered.  \\n\\nThe duck confit was okay.  It was good, but not exceptional.  The white asparagus that it was served with was very interesting.  It had a bread crumb topping that was delicious.  The mutton was awesome.  Very little gaminess and was cooked perfectly.  I really had a problem with the scallop dish.  The scallops had this fishy taste to it and I'm not certain that it was cooked all the way through.\\n\\nFor dessert, we tried the Tangerine dream, which is a cake with tangerines and thyme ice cream and topped with a meringe.  The thyme ice cream was awesome!  I wish I could buy that somewhere.

Inside reveals the same understated, humble decor with only one painting on the wall (a crayon sketched pig). \\n\\nThe basic facade gave way to a menu that was simple but very carefully designed and difficult to choose - which is likely why they allow 1/2 dishes and that's what we did. I started with lobster broth, clearly built on a perfected roux. The chili oil was a little lost - I though a creme fraiche could have substituted. For the main, I went halves of the homemade cavatelli, ricotta and basil topped with duck confit. Let's step back for a second here and think about these ingredients. This dish was one of the single best I've ever had and I'm kicking myself for not ordering the full. The other half portion I ordered was a local grass fed and house marinated (1mo) corrned beef. It was excellent, however, I'm not seasonally at the hearty, rich, slow cooked meat place yet.

After we left my sister stated \\"Eggo waffles taste better than those\\". I was extremely disappointed. The eggs were just as bad. A single waffle cost $9.99 and the side of eggs was $2. This food is not worth the money. Maybe I have high standards when it comes to food.

They're just a bit smaller than store-bought tortillas.\\n\\nThe space looks really nice. I like the patio area. I have no idea who was saying that they need shades. They're sitting right up against a stand of trees that I figure would block all that late afternoon sunlight. Of course, I was there at night.\\n\\nMargarita:\\nThey serve their rocks margarita in a martini glass. Makes one feel like they are getting gypped off a $6 margarita. They also use that fun pellet ice, so it makes it look and almost taste like they really made a crappy chunky frozen rita. I didn't taste much booze, and it was overpowered by tartness. Like just a bit too much tartness.\\nI switched to a glass of Pinot Grigio, since they were out of the Torrontes that I wanted.\\n\\nThe salsa and guac:\\nNice flavor. I liked the thick chips. Mine weren't stale. The guac was tasty, but nothing terribly special. The salsa was the same, except a little more disappointing as there was not even a hint of heat in there.\\n\\nPulled pork Tostadas:\\nThese were really freaking good. I just tried one even though I don't eat meat. There was goat cheese and some kinda agrodolce (which is Italian for sour and sweet) on top which incorporated watermelon. Really small, but very tasty.\\n\\nAhi Taco: \\nThis was the taco del dia, so I got one ala carte. \\"Ahi tuna seared to medium rare with a spicy guacamole and lettuce...\\" Well, you had me at medium rare. Except that it came out medium well. I mean, it wasn't even close to medium rare. Don't know how that slipped past the expo. The \\"spicy guac\\" was a barely visible (or taste-able) squirt of some avocado sauce. Overall the taco was pretty decent, but I don't think I'd get it again.\\n\\nMushroom/corn quesadillas:\\nVery tasty. 3 small ones served with a cliantro sprig and garlic-ancho chile sauce. Still, I was confused by the absence of any heat in the sauce anywhere, and I didn't get much garlic flavor either. I really wanted these to be flavor explosions, but they were more like flavor pats on the head.\\n\\nMy friends said their favorite (other than the pork tostadas) was the mahi BLT.

There are better burgers to be had in Atlanta and I've had them--Folk Art, Vortex, Mrs. Anne's, even Five Guys, and others.\\n\\nThe meat was bland (not good for a turkey burger), not well seasoned at all. The bun was dense, seemed like a small pretzel bun or some kind of small, dense brioche. I'll give them props for not making the burger about the bun, which is a usual downfall of burger joints. If that was a 1/2 pound of meat, I'm a tree, although a preferred portion from my perspective. Probably more like a 1/3 pound. The greek sauce on the lamb burger was rich and not very flavorful. The shoe string fries weren't just thin, they were short, so we really feel like we got the dregs of the frier out of these, best eaten with a spoon.\\n\\nIf they happen to be next door, sure, even if a bit pricey for what you get.

Great local beer selections that change often, and lovely cocktails (the white sangria is my favorite). The buffalo-caribbean chicken tenders are my favorite app, with pineapple salsa. Great flavor and taste, and just the right amount of spiciness. The butternut squash cannellonis are my favorite entree, though the pizzas are great too. None of the desserts really do it for me, though on your birthday you get a free entree and free dessert, so I get the molten chocolate cake, which is really good, especially when free. But of course the ONLY reason I come here so frequently..... is the bread and dipping sauce. This stuff is insanely addicting. It's a onion foccacia with an oil/cheese/garlic/red pepper sauce.

We sat at the bar and ended up getting oysters, chowder, and a burger, of which the chowder was the weakest link.\\n\\nI got a Kumamoto and an Island Creek oyster, both of which were very fresh and very tasty, and different enough to make both worth getting.  The Kumamoto had a smaller meatier body and the Island Creek, which I'd never had before, was wonderfully briny.\\n\\nThe clam chowder, which was what drew us to Neptune in the first place, was a sore disappointment.  The clams were quite good, plump and substantial, but the chowder itself was thin and watery and a little bit sad.  It tasted okay, but the soup went down like sick person food.\\n\\nThe service was on the slow side and it took a while after we were done with the chowder for the burger to come out.  We were pretty ready to write this place off when out came one of the best burgers I've ever had.  The Neptuneburger is a cheddar cheeseburger with fried oyster, garlic mayo, and relish, served with skin-on potato fries.  The bun is nice and brown and good without being distracting, and it couches a tall stack of fat patty and oyster that isn't really conducive to hands-on devourment.  The patty is gorgeous, with impossibly juicy meat enhanced by a house-made relish that is really out of control.  The fried oyster was actually hard to detect, drowned out by the other flavors, but I wouldn't change a thing about this burger other than to make it available in a state where I might one day reside.  The fries were great too, with the potato skin adding great texture.\\n\\nOverall I left Neptune happy.  The bar seating was pleasant even with the lax service, and the atmosphere was nice, both leisurely and lively.

My husband is from Mexico and we travel to Mexico a couple of times a year. I cook authentic Mexican food at home and I do know and understand both Mexican street food and gourmet Mexican food. Unfortunately, this restaurant doesn't understand either. \\n\\nThe only reason we visited this establishment was because of a deal they offered on Living Social. We actually booked out weekend around coming to the restaurant and stayed at the Twelve Atlantic Station hotel so we would walk to dinner. \\n\\nThe offer on Living Social included the following:\\n\\n $59 for a four-course Tacos & Tequila dinner for two\\n* All dishes presented to share: award-winning tableside guacamole, Mahi Mahi tacos, and two selections of regionally inspired specialty taco trios\\n* Plus, an order of churros en bolsa served with three dipping sauces; and your choice of three specialty tequila pairings, or a margarita al gusto for each person\\n\\nIt said you had to use the voucher by October 13, 2014 and you needed to email the restaurant ahead of time to make reservations and let them know you were using the Living Social deal. \\n\\nWe went in August and I emailed the restaurant on Monday to let them know we were requesting reservations for Saturday, which we received an email confirmation of. \\n\\nWhen arriving at the restaurant at 6:55 (our reservations were at 7), we were seated. We let the waiter know we were using the Living Social deal and he brought us the special menu. \\n\\nThe guacamole was brought to our table before we received the water and before the waiter took our drink order.  \\n\\nI ordered the margarita and my husband chose he tequila flight of 3 different tequilas. My husband also ordered a draft beer. We only chose the tequila and the guacamole because that is what was included in the deal. \\n\\nThe mahi mahi ceviche tacos arrived. These weren't great. I do eat ceviche and make it in my home, but this was way to fishy tasting and almost tasted ruined.  \\n\\nWe then ordered the taco trio.  I ordered the cochinita pibil and my husband ordered the fish tacos.  After we ordered, a supervisor came to our table to let us know that they didn't have the tacos I ordered and would I like something else. I said ok and ordered the pork carnitas tacos.  Then he tried to explain that they were no longer offering the living social deal (even though it clearly stated on the voucher good until October 13, 2014) and that their payment system had no way to offer the discounts anymore, so they would only be offering us a $59 credit off our bill. I was shocked. When he left the table I started thinking about what we had ordered. \\n\\nI would NOT have ordered the guacamole or the ceviche tacos. I would have chosed the queso dip instead. We would not have ordered the tequilas, nor would we have ordered the taco trio. We only chose those things because that was the menu from Living Social and it was the menu they gave me when we sat at our table.\\n\\nSo far here this was our charges:\\n\\nGuacamole $14.00\\nTacos MahiMahi Ceviche - $13.00\\nMargarita $12.00\\nTequila Flight $13.00\\nTaco Trio  $20.00\\nTaco Trio $20.00\\n(plus one beer and a michelada (horrible) which we were planning to pay for) $6.00 and $7.00\\n\\nTotal $105.00 and they only wanted to give me a $59 credit???\\n\\nI then asked to speak to a manager. Finally a man came and I told him how UNHAPPY I was with only getting a $59 credit when I would have NEVER ordered most of what was on the menu. If I were choosing, I would have chosen other options.  He tried to explain that their cash register system had not way of computing the charges and that the promotion ended on the 13th. I said yes, but the paper says October 13th and tried to show him my voucher, he wouldn't even look at it.  My husband then spoke up and said how unfair that was and that we didn't want to pay anything except for the extra drinks we ordered. He said he would fix it and then came back to our table to let us know that he had comped everything and that we would over $10.82 plus whatever else we ordered, including he churritos for the desert that was supposed to be included with the special. We don't normally eat desert and we didn't order it, but they still weren't offering the entire special. \\n\\nI was angry, frustrated and it really left a bad taste in my mouth.  Just bad business.  We didn't finish our meal. We paid and left. The tacos were not good, no spice, no flavor. The WORST mexican food I've ever had. and It's a shame they call it Mexican food. We ate tacos at another Atlantic Station location for lunch and they were great. We ate at a  taqueria in Marietta the following day and the tacos were great. \\n\\nThe service was slow, the food was horrible and the management/business decisions were by far the WORST I've ever experienced.

Yes, you can buy a bottle of water, but come on. Who won't give a customer a glass of water after a 86 buck bill? The food is flavorful. The portions are generous. But the place has zero atmosphere. I ordered a glass of red wine, and the owner poured it out of a big jug bottle.  Seven bucks, and it tasted like it had been opened a week already.

The star of the dish was the slightly tart vinaigrette sauce on the base that mixed into the smooth mash potatoes so seamlessly that this should be an option on the menu to add as a side for any meal. The enoki mushrooms on top were an interesting addition and tasted fine as is, but the problem was that none of the components on this dish were quite married together. The Double Brie Burger on the other hand delivered on its simple execution where the usually overpowering brie complemented the burger in a perfect ratio of cheese to meat with neither side overwhelming each other on a wonderfully toasted brioche. At the end of the meal were two miniature green tea macaroons from a dessert chef not belonging to Little Bird that surprisingly retained the crispy outer shell with a soft chewy middle even at its small size and tasted every much as delectable as it looked.\\n\\nPricing: Priced at the higher end of the spectrum, but still at the lower side such that enjoying a fancy meal is not going to be a giant splurge on the wallet thanks to the relatively more sensible price.\\n\\nService: The strange part was that we were seated next to an older couple who had the same server and she lavished them with attention. She came by very often to check on them and had long conversations before leaving without another look at us, but when she does remember us, she is friendly and would explain any questions we had so just not sure how to feel about this.\\n\\nAmbiance: Little Bird is surprisingly small with small tables crowded close together in a narrow space, but dim lighting and strategically placed partitions offer some privacy for patrons. The gray-teal walls with dark wooden accents is drab at first look, but when lit in candlelight and paired with the specials written in colorful chalk on blackboards and random ceramic knickknacks, the restaurant is transformed into something akin to visiting a relaxing vacation cottage.

Glad I got that e-mail.\\nWith a full liquor bar and a good wine list, craft beer is also available on draft. Being a SweetWater 420 fan, I ordered a few pints with my meal. I do wish that Cork and Fork had a lighter ale or pilsner on draft to go with my meal. IPA can be a bit heavy, especially with dinner. The craft beers available are the usual suspects: Sam Adams Seasonal, Shock Top, Fat Tire. Nothing really exotic. Although I did try a bottle of Green Man IPA, which was good. \\nFor starters, I tried the Soft Pretzel Sticks served with a lager fondue dip. The pretzel sticks have the appearance of small bread loaves with a hard salted crust and chewy center. These are delicious! But be careful, these are brought out hot from the kitchen. So careful when handling. Do try these on your visit here, three for $6.99.\\nI had planned on getting either the Fish and Chips, or the Cork and Fork burger. But tonight's special was Fried Clam Strips with French Fires and Cole Slaw ($16.99). These were also delicious! Fried crisp and served hot, with a dipping sauce for the clam strips and the house made ketchup for the french fries.\\nAs you enter, there is a smaller dining area and bar to the left, and as you pass the hostess station, the main dining area is to the right and the bar along the left. Outside dining is also available. Both bars have televisions, so it was easy to keep an eye on the NCAA Mens Basketball Tournament. The dining rooms are clean and the tables are well spaced, so it is not like you have another party sitting right up against you, as in other restaurants. The band performed in the front of the dining room, to the right as you enter. I was told that on Saturday evenings, Cork and Fork will have live jazz. Which makes for a great evening of food, drink, and music. The service is friendly, and quite helpful with going over the menu and any specials for the night. I did not have any problems with waiting to be served, and my food was served immediately from the kitchen.\\nPrices for food and drink are rather pricey.

The carpet was very grimly and dirty(I wish I've kept my shoes)  When the server came we were asked to wash our hands but not given the full reason (you eat with your hands,which we already knew). Whe our food came we seen the portion size for salad was much smaller . We were also given forks(which we did not use). The belly dancers were GREAT! They were the best part of the night. The dessert was AWFUL. Cheap fruit salad with tooth picks. Really!,??!  The plates here start at $45 and go up to $75.\\n Because of the belly dancer $45 to $50 buck is worth it.  Not the food alone! The bread was cold, soup was good, salads was to small to be told we had to share it. The fish had a lot of bones, rice was hold and cold. Fruit salad was a joke!.

The calamari and pesto were pretty good but we didn't really care for the tortellini. I thought the portion size was a little small and it could have used more pancetta. The oregano tomato sauce was really good though. The lamb was cooked well but again, I was a little disappointed with the portion size. I know we split each course but even if I got both of our portions on one plate, I still would have been disappointed for a $30 entr√©e. That being said the meat was flavorful and cooked perfectly, there was a nice balance of mint, and the fingerling potatoes were great. \\n\\nThe service was ok although it did take us a long time to order a bottle of wine after we were done with our martinis.

Man, already failed at minimizing.\\n- I ordered two dishes: chicken over rice with a salty egg, and noodles topped with duck and chicken. One of the chickens was supposed to be soy sauced, but they ran out. Also not something I docked point for. The points came off when I tasted the food.\\n1)  Chicken over rice with salty egg: lots of rice, little veggies, and what little meat I had was at least 42% bones. Rice was on the dry side. Veggies were plain (even by standards of steamed greens). Meat tasted bad and was topped with oily, flavorless scallions. The salty egg was disgusting. Rancid. Ugghh I can't even..\\n2)  Duck and chicken over noodles: Noodles were decent/good. But again, skimped on the veggies and protein with lots of bones.\\n\\nI've seen shitholes before, but at least those places served up some legit food to justify their Earthly existence.

We were talking (shouting) and laughing to each other at how loud it was.  We had a server in training and a trainer and between the two of them we didn't get very good service.

You are especially pushing your luck when you serve a chewy piece of meat on a chewy piece of bread.  Chewy and hamburger do not belong together.\\n\\nAlso, don't ask how I want it cooked.  Is this a joke?  If I said \\"bloody raw\\" would you really cook it and serve it like that?  Or is this just an opportunity to let people who like their beef charred to speak up? \\nNo matter what I say it always comes out the same.  From now on any place that asks how I want my hamburger cooked is BFL (Banned For Life).  \\n\\nThe burger was edible but so bready and chewy it was a close call.\\n\\nTwo people had pulled pork tacos which apparently someone spilled a bottle of salt in to batch.  I tried a bite to see if they were that salty and holy crap they were really salty.  \\n\\nAnother minus came in the form of the 2 spoonfuls of guacamole which cost $4.50.  It was the amount I would normally eat on a few chips but to not be greedy we all had to dab a tiny bit on a chip so we could all get a little bit.\\n\\nThey messed up one order, probably because they couldn't hear the order.\\n\\nI had a frozen margarita which was pretty good and fairly potent but a bit on the small side for the price.  \\n\\nThis is probably going to be a popular place for people (UT Students) to hang out and have drinks but I'll probably steer clear and stick to Crown & Anchor where the burgers are on hamburger buns and you get what you pay for in a more laid back atmosphere."},{"name":"Monica's Mercato","address":"130 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I lived in the North End for almost a year before I finally visited this little mercato and now I'm there all of the time!

Let me preface this by saying that part of what made this place phenomenal was that everything was fresh and made to order. TRANSLATION: you should anticipate a bit of a wait and build that into your dining time. Having read some of the other reviews I knew to allot for more than just my typical grab and go lunch. But another option could be to call ahead with your order and pick up- something we saw a few regulars do while we were there and something I'll definitely try in the future.\\n\\nWe started by splitting a carne empanada--fresh flavorful shredded beef encased in a corn flour-based dough. Absolutely delicious. They were out of the queso that day but I imagine that would be just as mouth watering. Next, we each had a Pernil arepa - ground cornmeal arepas griddled to perfection with a heaping filling of tender roast pork. Outstanding.  Flawlessly seasoned they were phenomenal on their own and even better when topped with the house made garlic sauce.\\n\\nBeing a baby, I stuck to the regular garlic sauce that was a great complement to the empanada and the arepa while the boy jumped at the chance to try their spicier house version. The kind gentleman working that day noticed D's enthusiasm for this stuff after he unceremoniously downed one containers-worth and brought a whole bottle of sawse for the table. This sticks out as just one of the moments that highlighted the friendly and stellar service here.   \\n\\nThe sides were equally tasty- our plantain tastes ran the gamut. I went for the sweeter platanos maduros (fried sweet plantains) while Damien opted for the tostones (fried green plantains). You can't go wrong with either and the \\"side\\" was most definitely large enough to split. From start to finish, our meal was amazing. It was the kind of meal where between every couple bites I felt the need to say \\"I can't *wait* to come back\\". \\n\\nGet yourself to West Roxbury and try this spot- you won't regret it."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I very highly recommend Tasty for breakfast.

We were comped an appetizer, discounted $15 off our bill, and treated very, very well.  The food and drink we had was delicious.  The Bloody Mary was unique, a meal unto itself.  The gumbo soup was tasty.  The shellfish boil we shared was definitely enough for two people.  The King Crab legs were great and the shrimp were quite large.

Other businesses are proactive and apologize and are absolutely wonderful- I will always return to them. A negative experience coupled with good customer service can lead to a lifetime customer. Word!!!\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nUpdate 8.5.11: I wrote this as one of my first Yelp posts, two stars and much harsher words. When the owner flipped his bird (dog?) on me, I felt like an awful person and changed everything. But looking back on it I was basically a pushover because I was \\"new\\" to Yelp. Forget that, I'm changing it back to what I first did. I should drop it, but I still feel angry after all these years. Here I am writing about things that can be improved, and what I get back is an indignant, angry, and self-righteous reply (aka \\"how dare you!\\", \\"my hot dogs are the best, they're so gourmet!\\"). Well let me tell you some news- places that don't heed customers are the ones that never really become big. \\n\\nOne thing that gets me is how the owner keeps on saying how awesome his hot dogs are and that we don't understand what goes into them and what makes them top-notch, importing them, etc, etc. \\n\\nLet me tell you something- hot dogs, as a general rule, are made from meat by-products and fat. By-products include just about everything we can't get at the local grocer's (like kidneys, gall bladders, intestines, brain, lungs, etc.). If you're talking gourmet, the franks are usually made of some type of beef, again nearly indistinguishable in taste in the end product. \\n\\nBut unless the beef/meat is grade A1 Kobe (stupid, no one makes hot dogs with kobe) or hand made by Tom Colicchio or Thomas Keller, being made by by a fifth-generation person in a company that dates from 1869 doesn't really mean much. Especially if you don't even list the name of the company or person. Not much to credit there, is there? \\n\\nPlaces like Bacchanalia (often named #1 in Atlanta)- have to import majority of their ingredients and procure local/organic as much as possible. Their menu is completely transparent. Niman Ranch, Flat Creek Lodge, etc. They don't complain about hidden costs, and they have a mini-gourmet grocer, deli, upscale dining room, and less formal upstairs to maintain as well. I don't know about 800 degree ovens, but Antico definitely has 1000+ degrees ovens and they don't close until waay later at night. They also import majority of their ingredients (their freaking ovens, too) straight from Italy. No complaints, just pride in their food and culture.\\n\\nSecond, I don't like how you say your food is fresh, not fast, like \\"your buds at Brandi's.\\" Nothing like poorer sportsmanship than calling out fellow hot dog enthusiasts. They were named as one of Atlanta's best hotdogs by AJC, one of Cobb's Seven Wonders, and has a higher rating than Barker's (without any ugly messages, too). Maybe instead of insulting them, you should try learning from them. \\n\\nThird, when you wrote on Daniel B's review (which was nothing but professional. He is one of the top in Yelp.), I found it incredible that you had the audacity to say how \\"painfully ignorant\\" he was, but invited him to visit your new location up in Roswell.\\n\\nThat, screams painfully ignorant in customer service."},{"name":"Mantra Restaurant","address":"52 Temple Pl","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"I went here for the restaurant week menu and LOVED IT.

We were planning on staying for a couple more rounds, but I guess those waitresses just decided we were done.

The manager, however made sure we didn't leave without a scene, following (harassing) us as we made our way to the door. I'd be rich if I had a dollar for every time this man scoffed at us like we had just commit murder. My guess is if you are managing a BAR, you've had your fair share of unfortunate boozy nights. There was no general concern for my friend as she stumbled onto the curb and he laughed \\"she's going to get hit by a car!\\" in front of a line full of people, because God forbid we left without feeling embarrassed.

Period. \\n\\nThe service was phenomenal. The waiter was very attentive to my party and knew the menu very well. I forget his name, but definitely a great guy. He was able to recommend what he thought was best for us to order off of the menu and even gave suggestions to better improve our order. Since we were out of town (from NYC), he also wrote out a list of other resturants/places/sights to check out during our time in Columbus. \\n\\nIf I can sum up by burger, the Western Burger, it was DELICIOUS. I savored every bite and you will too. One great thing about the burger, is it's price. Coming from NY, a burger the size that they serve would easily cost something between $15-$20. This burger was only $13 and I enjoyed every moment of it. The western burger was stacked with bacon, cheddar, your basic condiments and covered in a tangy bbq sauce and let me tell you, it'll drive your taste buds crazy. \\n\\nI highly highly recommend coming here, even if there is a wait and you're not able to go another day like my group fortunately was, you wait.

We've seen a lot of turn over in the neighborhood, and as always with the food biz, you're taking a risk. So bravo for stepping out and doing something so whole-heartedly.\\n\\nOf course, the next most important thing: the food and drinks! I admit that I've never sat upstairs, in the dining room, but I've gotten plenty of food downstairs in the bar. I love that ST has a menu of original cocktails. I get bored ordering the same handful of drinks at every bar, so it's a treat to try new and different things. My personal favorite is the Small Axe, which has rum, lime and Ting! (Ting is a Jamaican grapefruit soda - amazing!) As for the food, I love the street-meets-sit-down vibe. The Spatchcock Grilled Chicken is wonderful, and I have to order the Cece Fritos - fried chickpeas - every time I go in.\\n\\nSound Table also has a FANTASTIC staff, really knowledgable about cocktails and very cool under pressure. It gets crazy in there on the weekends, and the guys keep it together no matter how slammed they are. I really appreciate that even if there are 6 people waiting at the bar ahead of you, the bartender will give you a nod and let you know that he's getting to you as quick as he can.\\n\\nIt goes without saying that one of the major draws of Sound Table is the incredible amount of DJ talent that they bring in on a regular basis. Not only are 2/3rds of the owners fantastic  spin doctors in their own right, but they've tapped into the local, national and international music scene perfectly. From hosting European phenoms to our own local Edgewood Electronic Music Fest, they're constantly changing it up and encouraging patrons to get into all kinds of different sounds.

We've also tried the Acadian redfish and chips which was also excellent. Clam chowder was on the soupier side but it may have been because we were there for lunch when they had just opened for the day.

This is my second time here and this time was just as good as the first time.  We ordered the Steak Salad and Mahi Out of Control.  The Mahi Out of Control was insanely good and a must try.  It was cooked to perfection in a lemon-herb bechamel sauce.  It came with an assortment of goodies including shrimp and broccolini.  The Steak Salad was also good.  It was drizzled with a caramel red wine sauce that was somewhat analogous in taste to a sweet and sour sauce but better.  It was a spinach based salad adorned with tomatoes, craisins and squash.  The ambience is very hip with fun artwork on the walls.  Standout artwork this time was of Salvador Dali in the back.  Last time I spotted a cool cat picture in the front by the bar.  We also noted a wine tasting room in the back that looked fun.

Second time around, I came for lunch around 12PM again in the middle of the week. I'm glad I gave this place a second chance because the quality vastly improved.

My husband and I enjoyed the dragon roll, spicy salmon and spicy tuna roll. First and foremost, the prices are super reasonable. The two more basic rolls were only $5.75 and the spicy salmon roll had huge chunks of salmon (nigiri like). The Dragon roll was small and unimpressive. The Tuna roll had chopped tuna in it, which they r upfront about and I guess is pretty common practice. The service was super slow. Not sure if it was our server or the restaurant.

The beer selection here is incredible, and totally unexpected for what looks like a typical \\"southern comfort food\\" kind of place. \\n\\nAfter the novelty of the wheel has worn off (or you wind up with three Guinesses in a row), you need to set yourself up with a mountain or two of meat, pronto.

Make sure to get lots of sides to go with it, as the corn bread is another thing you can't miss out on.  Lastly, a warning: do NOT try to finish everything on your plate, it just isn't possible, and probably not good for your health either.  You are already going to be near-comatose by the time you walk out, don't make things worse by risking cardiac arrest.

She kinda messed up our orders and forgot alot of things, but we were hungry so we didn't want to send back food.  The food was passable but nothing to rave about.  My dad ordered the veal cacciatore and it was a mess and it was missing for the most part the veal.  Prices seem to be a bit higher than the competition in the area.  can't say that I will go out my way to come back as the competition is better in my opinion.

The scallops, in addition to being so well seasoned prepared and presented, came on top of a fennel salad that I thought was a nice addition. The boyfriend thought it was a bit overwhelming.\\n\\nFor the main course I ordered the wonderfully braised short rib which comes placed on top of mashed potatoes so that the gravy from the meet gets incorporated and made the mash even better. With dinner they had a bottle of my boyfriends favorite wine, Sokol Blosser pinot noir. Our waiter made sure we never had an empty glass and refilled when appropriate.\\n\\nWe still had wine when we were finished with our main course so we got the creme brulee for dessert. One of the best I've had and comes with delicious lemon cookies.\\n\\nThe reason why I tried to give 4.5 was because it felt like our first waiter passed us off to another which was ok because I much preferred how our final waiter treated us.

After my third soggy buckwheat roll I asked one of the employees what changed, and they said that they started storing them in the freezer.

My only complaint is that the tortilla did taste slightly buttery, which I personally don't mind. But for those out there who are more health conscious or just don't like the taste of butter, it's something to consider.

I couldn't have been more amazed by the options of ALL GLUTEN FREE items ranging from breakfast to Mexican dishes and they were all delicious. I've never had gluten free waffles, biscuits or French toast that even come close to this quality. My favorite items on the buffet were the chipotle shredded chicken stuffed into a baked avocado, the authentic pork carnitas, and the ground beef chile rellenos. The stuffed avocado is topped with melted cheese and served on herbed white rice, but it's the chipotle sauce that really puts it over the top. My fianc√©'s mom even put a custom order in to make it dairy free and the chef create a separate plate just for her at no extra charge! The Belgian style waffle also was delicious topped with their strawberry compote and fresh whipped cream. Other entries for top contender: cheese migas, ham migas, black beans, home fries, fresh mixed fruit, chorizo gorditas, bacon, biscuits with optional white gravy, steamed veggies, fajita veggies and rice.

Keep in mind (an open mind) that there are thousands of coffee shops in the U.S. With that being said, you should realize that Propagation is not and simply cannot be the best, and that should be entirely okay with any humble business owner.

This was the first restaurant I visited during my trip to Portland.\\nAs soon as i walked in, I noticed that the interior was intimate and beautiful- cute decorations of small birds on the walls, good romantic lighting- perfect for a special occasion dinner or date night. \\nHowever, as soon as we were seated, I noticed that our waitress seemed rather cold and had a \\"i'm tired and I don't care to be here anymore\\" attitude. She didn't even greet us! She literally came up to our table and immediately listed out the dinner special (halibut). She then asked if we were ready to order... we literally had 2 seconds to read the menu before this!\\n\\nWe ended up ordering the \\n1. Octopus appetizer- very very small portion size. The octopus dish didn't consist of a huge leg (like the ones I've seen at Tasty and Alder's yelp page- a place that I wish I went to instead of here!) Instead, it was a very very thinly sliced layer of octopus- probably 1 g worth of octopus- VERY small portion. It came with some pickles that I thought tasted good with the octopus. However, for the price this portion was very very disappointing.\\n2. Side of mushrooms and Macaroni gratin- both average. I'm a huge fan of mushrooms so I think mushrooms are always really good. However, the macaroni was disappointing. It was just plain baked macaroni and cheese - no interesting texture or any interesting cheese flavor added into it- definitely skip the mac and cheese.\\n3. Halibut special- fish was cooked really well. However, the green sauce that came with it had a very very very strong smell that overpowered the whole dish. I'm not quite sure what was in it but I think it was some sort of asparagus/green pea. \\n4. Chicken fried trout- Although they claim they debone this dish, I found TONS of bones in this dish. I even ended up having to cough one up! ew. It comes with some lettuce to make wraps with, which is kind of cool..BUT this is a very standard form of eating fish in any chinese, korean, vietnamese restaurant! NOT worth the price. My mom makes this at home very frequently and the flavors are pretty similar to what she makes... I always find this a problem at fancy restaurants- chefs try to do an asian inspired dish but ends up adding an extra zero on the price tag for a dish that can be made by most asian mothers...this was literally just panko fried fish with some fancy chopped up herbs on top!\\n5. steak frites. SKIP SKIP SKIP. the steak is a very very sad tiny piece (literally three bites!) of steak with 75% of the dish being average french fries. I normally don't mind a small steak portion on a steak frites dish because i love fries but at least make the fries SPECIAL for the price...maybe add some parmesan or truffle oil? From a place like Little Bird I expected something more elevated. The flavors were really off too...the steak had a HUGE chunk of blue cheese on it that was so overpowering that I couldn't even taste anything else but blue cheese after one bite. The sauce that came with the steak was super rich and tasted too salty. a HUGE HUGE disappointment.\\n\\nI normally do not hate on fancy restaurants for the price because I understand places with famous chefs like Little Bird aren't cheap. However, usually the balance of flavor on the dishes or the innovative menu choices make up for the steep prices! Little Bird, to me, lacked both good flavor and innovation. Perhaps we went on an off day...or perhaps the quality of the dishes has declined since it first opened (maybe due to the increase in popularity).

So what we should have done was put in our name and number, then gotten ready for dinner, and returned.  Instead we put in our name at 7 PM, were told it was a 2 to 2.5 hour wait.  We had a drink elsewhere, wandered the North End, then checked back in at 8:45.  They said it would be closer to 9:30.  So we sat outside and waited.  When our table was finally ready a bit AFTER 10 PM, I was tired, hungry, and annoyed.  It's bad to wait 2.5 hours, but to wait over 3 hours was beyond reasonable.  \\nThere are two steps into the restaurant, and the staff helped me in (I use a wheelchair), but then I saw that even their low tables are high.  I was going to simply sit with the table at chin height, and then I realized that I had to transfer to the bench because otherwise my chair would have been in the way (the place is tiny).  \\nOnce we were seated, it was a lovely experience.  It's a beautiful, clean, cozy, space, with comfy bench and marble top tables. \\nThe oysters were delicious; our waiter selected 6 for us.  We also had an amazing octopus salad, which might have been the most inventive, delicious dish of the evening.  The octopus was warm and perfectly cooked.  The crab claw was good - I really like the aioli dipping sauce.  Then we had a hot lobster roll.  Yes, it was big, tons of lobster.  We split it.  It was very good - just a roll, lobster, and butter.  The fries are made in house, and they are OK.  My glass of cava was great.  \\nThen the bill - over $100 for the two of us.

What did I ever do to you? :( I almost walked away.. I would have been robbed of one of the most amazing seafood experiences of my life. \\n\\nLuckily we were able to snag some seats by the bar after realizing that they were indeed letting more people in. Total wait time was around.. 15 minutes. Did I mention this was a Saturday evening? Yes, we were very close to their close time, but we were extremely lucky.\\n\\nEntered hungry and ready to eat an aquarium.. and we sure did. 22 oysters, clam bake, uni toast and a bowl of clam chowder.. all consumed within 40 minutes or so. We overheard people sitting next to us saying that they came at around 4pm and there was a four hour wait.\\n\\nLet's start with the amazing:\\n\\nOysters: SO GOOD. SO FRESH. I'm a fan of big, meaty oysters -- the oysters called Katama Bay from Edgartown MA and Thatch Island from Barnstable, MA were my favorite. Only negative I have to say is that I wasn't a huge fan of the mignonette sauce, but the cocktail sauce was good. It's also nice that they let you keep the order sheet you check off for oysters so you know exactly what you're eating and you can keep note of it. Katama Bay and Thatch Island.. hope to see you again, soon.\\n\\nClam bake: The buttery sauce is what's magical about it all, but honestly you could probably put anything on the lobster and it'll still taste amazing because it's SO FRESH. Possibly the best lobster I've ever had. Also, the corn that comes with the dish deserves a shout out. It was sweet, succulent and I'd order it if it were a separate item on the menu.\\n\\nAnd then there's the not-so-amazing:\\n\\nUni toast: Not sure if it's always on the menu, but it was written on the wall. It was okay, but a bit too ocean-y. I'm a big uni fan, but there wasn't any uni visible.. it was slathered all over the toast and it tasted salty and a bit too fishy.\\n\\nClam chowder: The clam was amazingly fresh and meaty, but the soup itself was slightly underwhelming and watery. Not bad, but not mind-blowing, either.\\n\\nNonetheless, the oysters, clam bake and service blew everything out of the water. (Bartender/server was exceptionally nice and attentive considering how busy and packed the place was!)"},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The view is amazing if you are lucky enough to get one of those couches next to the window.

I told my server it was the best vegi burger I've ever had and he said he's a meat eater, but totally orders the vegi burger all the time.  How's that for an endorsement?  I've since converted many beef burger lovers to this thing.  Hand-cut fries are pretty good too.\\n\\nHot tip: Coming here on Friday or Saturday?  Make a reservation or wait you'll have to wait an hour."},{"name":"Halal Bros","address":"2712 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"You can't go wrong with the lamb over rice.

Ordered the curried tuna sandwich, very delicious. The roasted chicken with Brie, very Yummy but bread is hard making my roof and bottom mouth scraped. The Boston cream pie wasn't delicious, more like a tiramisu but No flavor. The bottom cake is too wet. Overall, stick with the sandwiches. They also have other desserts."},{"name":"Pepino's Mexican Grill - Portland","address":"3832 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I used to love this place but yesterday's meal was pretty bad.  I ordered the Potato and Chipotle Burrito which was on the small side and had way too much mayo based chipotle sauce in it.  My daughter had a taco salad which she really liked.  \\n\\nWe ordered a basket of chips which were served with enough grease they were actually dripping.  The establishment was less than cleanly.  \\n\\nI doubt I'll return."},{"name":"Bubor Cha Cha","address":"45 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Food is pretty good here, possibly warranting 4 stars, but the service is just about the worst I've ever experienced in a Boston restaurant.

That being said I've been to numerous vietnamese restaurants throughout the US and I was sorely disappointed with what I was given here.\\n\\nI wonder if they sacrifice quality for quantity. I took my friends here who were visiting from out of town. We all love vietnamese. I got my usual which is a pork vermicelli plate. The meat was leathery and seemed as though it had been sitting out/re-cooked for a while. I also got some spring rolls and they were mediocre. My friends didn't think the quality of their dishes was up to par either. Not to mention service was bad also (but that I could handle if only the food had been good!)\\n\\nOverall, I should have gone to Dorchester."},{"name":"House of Louie","address":"331 NW Davis St","city":"Portland","stars":"2.5","text":"What a disaster.  \\n\\nIf I could give no stars, I would.\\n\\nThis is what I get for not Yelping first.\\n\\nNever have I been as in fear for my life when eating at a restaurant. \\n\\nThanks Louie for making my first Dim Sum experience likely my last.\\n\\nYuck.\\n\\nP.S.

Very large and juicy with a great bun. Also served with potato chips, but I didn't have any room for those. I've been here twice and each time I've sat at the bar which had the benefit of getting my drink refilled as soon as I needed it. One thing I will say is that you should be careful when you go to this place. The time and day of the week is crucial, because at popular hours this small place is packed and service will be slow! Therefore I recommend going at off peak hours, such as on a Tuesday around 2-3 PM. Fortunately, even if you do not manage to go at a slow time, the food quality does not suffer."},{"name":"Porto","address":"Ring Rd","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"So this review is for when I went early September (a little late my bad...) after they had been open for a few weeks. Main concern was how long the wait was for food to arrive, but the executive chef Jody Adams did check in on us, asking how our food was, how we heard about the restaurant, etc, so props for her to reaching out and demonstrating that they really care for the guests opinions.\\n\\nThe restaurant is located right outside the Prudential Mall, and within walking distance of Copley, so very easy to get to by T or bus and has a decent about of tables. The cuisine is Mediterranean seafood and I ended up getting the squid ink bucatini, fried oysters, and hamachi tartar. I liked the oysters the least because of the overwhelming flavor coming from the peppers that came with them, the tartar was fresh, and the bucatini I liked the texture of the noodles but not so much the flavor as it also concentrated on the onions and peppers.\\n\\nMy friends got the seafood stew, cheese and olives, and poached halibut and they all enjoyed their dishes. Aside for the wait time and not being extremely impressed with my small dishes, I would come back and try something new since they're menu is always changing. I wish the restaurant had a website as well to access the menu and basic information since I ended up making a reservation through facebook and had a hard time finding the current menu."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing as always!

The ajo shrimp tacos were flavorless, the ribeye taco with habenero honey was wack.  There was no heat, no flavor no passion!!  We got a couple of other things, but there were all forgetable.  We told Allie how disappointed we were in the meal,  she gave us a nervous smile and a sorry.  Well that is not enouph.  Thank god we got some HH prices so we didn't get gouged too much.

However the restaurants poor structure made the experience an annoyance instead of an enjoyable time. I came in at midday to find the bar seats were full and the dining area was being prepared for dinner which was fine, but the aspects they may not see is that you could feel people breathing on each other to grab bar seats. I had to tell my guest joining me to no longer come because the seating was unavailable (loss of money for you). I had to fight for the seat I should of been offered by the staff too from another guest since I was the first one there. My burnt chicken I ordered got cold because I could not sit and enjoy my meal. I think this place can compete with the big dogs if they improve some old rules.
