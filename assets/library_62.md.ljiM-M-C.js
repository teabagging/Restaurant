What do i think of Highland Kitchen? Lets start with the food.\\n\\nFood: Not worth all the hype, actually its not worth any sort of \\"hype\\". i ordered their \\"famous\\" pulled pork sandwich and it was just a sandwich. nothing about it was exceptional or out of the \\"blah\\" ordinary. i've actually had a better pulled pork sandwich at blue glass cafe, a lunch place on the first floor of the john Hancock building in back bay. \\ni also tried their beef chilli and it was once again a let down from having expected so much (deceitful menu). i went there one last time and ordered their bolognese however, it was sub-par, any ONE of the plethora of bad italian restaurants in the north end can dish out a better bolognese. Their food is just that, food, not an experience; therefore nothing sepcial and ive experienced a lot better. 5 horses down the street in Davis square is way better.\\n\\nAmbience: Ok ambience, its usually packed in there from 6pm until about 9:30pm or so. My biggest issue with this place is for being so small theres no reason on earth the music should be this loud which in turn forces everyone to raise their voice and turn the place into this extremely loud to the point of being uncomfortable bar. \\n\\nService: no issues with that, i think the hostesses do a great job and one of the bartenders is pretty good and attentive.\\n\\nAll things considered, if you live close enough to HK its the perfect place to hangout with a friend and have some cheap beers and maybe even eat a burger. nothing more! \\n\\nFINALLY: i will keep going there (proximity) for the occasional drink or two when i do not feel like walking more than 30 seconds."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"What I Ordered: Moroccan Chicken Hash - $15\\nThe order has potatoes, bell peppers, spinach, shredded chicken & an over-easy egg on top.

The ribs were very tender and fell off the bone, but the flavor was not very impressive, and these had some fatty sections, more than what I am accustomed to. The beans however, are delicious. \\n\\nMeats are available by themselves, or on a Kaiser roll bun. The Brisket at Fuel is pretty impressive. It has great char and bark, and really good flavorings. This one was served up on a Kaiser Roll with nothing else except for choice of available housemade BBQ Sauces that are at the table.\\n\\nHigh Octane Pulled Pork is made with the traditional pork butt that you would get on the basic menu selection if you order Pulled Pork, but this one is made with a High Octane Jim Beam Bourbon sauce to give it a little extra kick.\\n\\nThe Bus Stop, is a sandwich creation of Brisket and regular Pulled Pork with Coleslaw, although the coleslaw is on the side. As you can see from the above photos, I am not very impressed with the creativity at Fuel BBQ. I understand the part of ordering meats, or a sandwich, but the sandwiches are just really plain and boring, even this one...I feel like I missed the Bus.

Additionally, the lines are terrible! So we stood in line for close to 30 minutes to order the pretzel with beer cheese, roasted vegetables, & the chauchuterie.  About 45 minutes later we received the text that our food was ready and we were still holding out hope that things wouldn't be all bad but we were mistaken.  The pretzel was good (though very salty) but the cheese was cold, grainy, and absolutely flavorless.  If we hadn't put crushed red peppers in then it would have just been a cold flavorless blob.  The roasted vegetables were alright, assuming you didn't get a piece of partially cooked potato and are okay with very charred yet still very firm roasted vegetables; the sauce they came with was good though.  The chauchuterie was the biggest miss of them all with the cheeses really missing the mark with no true discernible flavor, one of the meats being completely inedible, and an odd extremely salty liquid for added flavor; the bread crisps were very good.\\n\\nThe new menu and approach is supposed to be focused on local and \\"farm foraged\\" and I am all for farm to table (many places in Austin do it very well) but what they have going on at Jester King just isn't working.  Everything felt very forced with the new menu being more focused on buzzwords and a high-horse farmhouse experience that just misses the mark.  Additionally the beer and wine selection was extremely limited and extremely niche, with only one or two of the beers that Jester King does very well and everything else being \\"small batch craft\\" that tasted more like beer being added to a wine glass that still had a little in the bottom.\\n\\nI can't say that we will never go back (you never know) but at this point with what they have started to do out there we will save ourselves the 30 min each way drive and go somewhere in Austin that has stayed true to themselves with great local food and drink offerings (i.e. ABGB, Sour Duck, both very family friendly establishments as well!)

Our waitress checked back a couple of times to see if we were ready to order or waiting for our whole party to arrive. After the majority of the rest of our party was there we went ahead and ordered. Along with the entrees, 4 of us decided to add yucca fries to our order. After our order was placed and we were back to enjoying the live music playing our waitress returned to let us know that they only had enough yucca fries for 3 of the 4 orders. I decided I would give mine up so the birthday girl and 2 other friends could have them. We wait again. Our waitress returns and says that they actually do have enoughy yucca fries for all four of us. YAY! Our yucca fries arrive as an appetizer and they are quite delicious. The dipping sauce is like a sweet and sour sauce and it was tasty as well. Here's where things get really \\"good\\".\\n\\nOur entrees, most being tofu dishes were in my opinion inedible (I sent it back). While some were able to stomach the tougher than leather/ dryer than the Mojave Desert tofu strips I just could not. The cabbage was bland as all get out and I've never seen anyone turn their nose up at a fried plantain. It was just not good. The pescetarians(seafood eaters) were only slightly pleased with their shrimp. So basically, the yucca fries were amazing...everything else, not so much. Oh, and the birthday girl had an adult beverage that was subpar and weak. \\n\\nSo it's time to pay and man was that an event in and of itself. Our waitress took well over an hour to get checks to everyone and even had the audacity to claim that there was food unpaid for. No! She just did a very poor job of taking orders and keeping track of who ordered what which caused her to cone back and forth to the table asking each person what they ordered. Sweet girl, just not on her job that day.\\n\\nDespite the atrocius food we received that day the live music was great and the sister bonding even better.  I'd advise the owners to take better care of who they are leaving in charge when they can not be there. Just think of how many  people could have found out about your restaurant vioa word of mouth alone with 13 women going and talking about how wonderful your restaurant was. Instead you have 13 women who won't even consider recommending your restaurant  to anyone for fear of retaliation.

In retrospect the AYCE menu would have been cheaper and includes much of the a la carte menu. If you are looking to chow down on a lot of mediocre sushi, this is the place for you.

I noticed a couple other comments below have pointed that out, as well. Not sure if it's just inconsistently seasoned or that I have a more sensitive taste toward salt. The pickles did help offset the saltiness!\\n\\nWhen I came, they were only doing Thursday-Saturday lunch time, but looks like they've expanded their hours to Monday-Saturday lunches now! Glad to see they're doing well!\\n\\nEven so, I can't wait to come back and have another burger. I've had quite a few classic burger stacks in Atlanta and this is one of the better ones, if not the closest and most convenient. The price for a combo (with fries and a drink) is probably the cheapest burger stack combo I've seen so it's also a great deal!"},{"name":"Gilmore's Meadows","address":"5823 SE Johnson Creek Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Now called Parkers Hideout.

The calamari was breaded very delicately and was quite delicious.\\n\\nThere are three different entree selections to choose from. The Organic Tanglewood Farms Chicken with a citrus braised kale, havarti polenta, and a tomato demi glaze was an excellent dish. One of my favorites was the Bourbon Glazed Salmon with a sweet corn and bacon saut√©. The glaze was not overly sweet, and went really well with the Norwegian salmon. For you steak lovers, the Grilled Hanger Steak with whipped potatoes, haricot verts, and chimichurri will not disappoint. Very tender slices of steak packed with flavor in every bite.\\n\\nIf you want to end your meal on a lighter note, I would suggest choosing one of the Vanilla, Chocolate, Mango, or Blackberry Gelato selections for desert.

I ordered the veggie burger where the guy asked me what I wanted on it.  Since I was assuming there would already be a patty in b/w the bun I ordered my typical on-the-patty fare; cheese, onions, lettuce, and ketchup.  Sounds good right, well at least it does to someone who thought she would be eating strictly fries for lunch.  I received my veggie burger a few minutes later, where to my chagrin, it was litterally a \\"veggie\\" burger as in veggies on a bun.  What in the heck.

I am not a fan of paying (or having my company pay) $2.60+ for some lettuce and cheese on a burger bun, especially not when they got my hopes up like that.

Most Chinatown restaurants only hit upon 2 out of 5 of these qualities and it's usually the latter 2. Winsor has only been open for about 2 months I think, but it's a great new addition to the block. It won't draw away too much of China Pearl's traffic despite being located directly across the street, only because their dining area is comparatively tiny (about 10 tables, although some can be expanded to accommodate larger parties). However, Winsor's dim sum is much fresher because it's made to order. I was chowing down within 7 minutes of putting in my order. \\n\\nThe menu covers specialities ranging from dim sum to noodles and congee. There is even a section dedicated to Northern dim sum items like you tiao, scallion pancakes and soybean milk (as opposed to the typical Cantonese fare which is well represented on the main menu). The dim sum ordering is simple because they give you a checklist with all the choices and you can just indicate the quantity you'd like of each. Also, all dim sum is $2.50 each, except for the \\"special items\\" which are larger plates. \\n\\nOf note, I think their char siu bao (steamed pork buns) are the fluffiest and best in town.  I also really enjoyed the spinach and shrimp dumplings. A few items are hit or miss (like the crabmeat/shrimp dumpling that I mistakenly thought was xiaolongbao), but overall it was an enjoyable experience.

Nachos were on the more basic side but perfect if you just want a ton of food to mow down on. Tacos were excellent. They came with a spicy sauce that really sealed the deal. The bread pudding was full of flavor but a little on the dry side. People have different takes on bread pudding so mine must be of a wetter perspective. \\n\\nOverall, the beer is cheap, the hot toddies are dangerous, the food is just what you're craving and the staff is warm and efficient.

It's a small, intimate, hip space.\\n\\nUnfortunately, it's far from intimate because just about everything in the space reflects sound. That made Swift's Attic perhaps the loudest restaurant I have ever dined at. People are talking loudly or shouting at each other and to the wait staff in order to be heard -- and the restaurant was less than two thirds full. I can't imagine trying to have a conversation here when it is crowded.\\n\\nThe beer menu has some variety but it's a bit IPA and hop heavy (especially for November...). The beer here is among the most expensive I have seen in Austin: Most of the draft beers run around $1/ounce, though it's not obvious at first since it's served in either 8 or 10 ounce glasses (at $8 and $10 respectively).\\n\\nMy wife had the Bowling Alley Burger and I had the Fried Chicken Sandwich. We both had fries as the side. The fries were served at room temperature - which is never great for fried potatoes - but I can tell that they would have been great if they were fresh. The sandwiches weren't hot and the service wasn't quick so I don't really understand what we were waiting on.\\n\\nThe burger was just ok. It had a good crust on it but wasn't juicy and I can't say anything great about the seasoning or accoutrements.\\n\\nThe chicken sandwich was pretty good. The breading was good but wasn't as crispy as I had hoped. Maybe because it had been sitting for a while with dressing on it before it was served? There were some good spices and the dressing and veggies were good on it.\\n\\nOver all It was not a great dining experience and we won't be back.

The taco options are not very flexible. Not like Chipotle that you can choose your own salsa, corn, or sauce. The combinations within each taco is pre-determined. The tacos shells are warmed up using a steam cooker. However, when I received the order, the taco shells could be a bit cold already. \\n\\nThe flavors of the meat in the tacos is really good.

I'd been curious when the place was going in, especially as the signage had hinted that it was going to be a sports bar and a Latin menu.  \\n\\nIn any case, the place was visually appealing (albeit empty), with a sleek, modern vibe.  It had more of a club-like feel than anything else.  Modern black leather couches, sleek/dark coffee tables, a few platform seating nooks, and a bar dominating the center, with a puffy/white upholstered leather wall behind the bar.  The look and feel felt a bit thin, with the couches we sat on looking/feeling like something you might get at a Target or a Walmart, and the general decor behind the bar seeming a big hodge podge (a mix of mirrors, leather, and shelves, with the shelves looking like an afterthought, the brackets exposed and on top of the upholstered wall).  \\n\\nFrom the happy hour menu, I had the tostonachos - tostones (twice-fried plantains) topped with salsa, sour cream, guac, and lechon pork, which I really enjoyed.  The folks I was with ordered the Cubano (she said it was better than Bunk's but worse than Rum Club's) and the chicharron and salsa.  The chicharron's looked and tasted store-bought, and the tiny little plastic ramekin of salsa definitely made it look like an afterthought.\\n\\nDrinks were a little interesting as well - I ordered their signature boulevardier, without looking at what was in it.  Was a little surprised when the bartender brought the cocktail out after my friends had their drinks, saying that it had taken him a bit to find the white wine.  Apparently, they use Hennessy, cynar, and verdelho madeira - the end result was surprisingly decent.  Also had a beer, though the beer choices were a bit limited.  I think they had 3 drafts, including Pono's Pineapple Express, and two other lagers/kolschs and no IPA.  \\n\\nAs for the sports bar bit, they definitely had games on - a large projection screen in the SE corner, and I think 4 or 5 big screens scattered over the place.\\n\\nOverall, the place felt very split brained, trying to pull me in lots of different directions - Latin fusion food, club, and sports bar.

The total cost for my order was $11.34.  \\n\\nThe current location is a lot smaller than the previous one.  There were six small stools near the window and very little space for customers to stand.  Also, it was a humid 93 degree day and there was no air conditioning- just a Walmart fan on the counter that was turned in the direction of the employees who were working hard in all that heat trying to get the customers' orders ready.  Including the people who were seated, there were only about 10 customers in there but it still was stuffy and cramped.  I felt like I was in everyone's way just standing at the counter and looking over the menu.  \\n\\nSince the door was open the whole time, I just stood outside near the doorway after I placed my order.  Once another customer got her food, I came inside and stood up until I could finally sit down.

As we attempted to order our food, our waitress had to continuously apologize due to the fact that many of the items that we wanted to order were sold out...which included their signature biscuits and even cheddar cheese for their sandwiches. After picking out alternatives for what we wanted to eat, our food arrived with even greater disappointment. My girlfriend's sandwich didn't have any cheese on it...instead, the cheese was substituted with a single black hair. Deciding not to make a big deal out of the single hair, my girlfriend ignored it and simply wanted to get some cheese for her sandwich. However, getting a hold of our waitress was nearly impossible because she was telling her life story to the table next us. After a couple of minutes and when our waitress finally finished telling her epic personal biography, she finally decided to acknowledge us. We told her that my girlfriend's sandwich didn't have any cheese, and without even asking what cheese she had wanted, the waitress just brought her back a bowl mysterious white cheese. By the time the cheese got to us, the sandwich was already cold and everything had seemed very unappetizing. Everything that could have possibly gone wrong had happened. Ultimately, we would have been better off going to McDonald's for an Egg McMuffin."},{"name":"Clean Juice Winter Park","address":"480 Orlando Ave, Ste C-126","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Solid 4 stars!

Below is the email I sent describing my experience:\\n\\nOn this past Saturday evening (12/10/16), our group had dinner reservations at your restaurant for 7:30pm. It was our first time dining there and overall, it was a lovely restaurant. However, my individual experience was less than stellar.\\n\\nWhen our waiter, John, asked for my order, I explained I was interested in the lobster ravioli and the risotto. After discussing it further, I chose the risotto. I explained to him that I did not like tomatoes and was concerned about that part. He informed me that he had just had this meal recently and that while he too does not like tomatoes, he couldn't even tell they were there. So, I proceeded with ordering the risotto as it is normally prepared. Additionally, I ordered a side Cesar salad. After waiting a while, an arugula salad was delivered to me in which I had to send back for the correct Cesar salad. John apologized, I said no problem. Shortly thereafter, the entrees were delivered to the table at which point it was noted that my risotto was absolutely covered in tomatoes all over the entree. John walked by and I explained that I felt he misled me in the description of this entree. He replied, \\"that's two off on John\\". Instead of immediately offering to bring the dish without tomatoes, he stood there while I continued to pick them off of the risotto and then offered to buy me a dessert. I was so disappointed at this point. As a little bit of time passed, John walked by and said, \\"let me at least top off your glass of wine\\". I stated, I did not expect him to do so, but that I did wish to order another glass of wine. It was delivered and we continued to dine. Eventually a couple of us ordered dessert. In particular, I ordered the creme br√ªl√©e.\\n\\nFinally, at the end of our dining experience, our checks were delivered. At that moment, I realized that I was charged full price for everything, including the dessert. Since this experience had already impacted my dinner experience with the group, I did not want to have a confrontation with John about why he charged me for a dessert in which he had offered to me at his expense. Instead, I paid the bill in full without speaking up. I am writing to you personally as this is not the level of service I would expect from this type of establishment in Atlanta.

I know none of this sounds innovative but it was all so delicious. The croquettes I could've eaten several, the steak was perfectly done and butter is the best compliment, the gnocchi were also nice and fluffy with a poached egg on top.

And the boudin arancini was insanely flavorful- we wanted more of the spicy chili pepper and pickled pepper on top.  \\n\\nThe service was a tad slow but our waiter was friendly, helpful and added to our dining experience. Also, a few of the wines weren't available and we would have appreciated a bigger selection. \\n\\nCameron Mitchell should call this chef for some tips. ;)"},{"name":"Honjin Ramen","address":"12-228 Schoolhouse Street","city":"Coquitlam","stars":"3.5","text":"Shoyu Ramen $9.95\\nReview: Well, my parents and I ended up eating here since it was on the way to where we were going. For first impressions, the restaurant was very clean and the waiter was also very polite!  This ramen shop has an average range of options, regular & light shoyu, shio, miso, tantan men and vegan/vegetarian options! I decided to order shoyu only because it was the first ramen on the menu and I sort of assumed that it would be what they are best af making?! Maybe my assumption was wrong? The location of the restaurant isn't very \\"convenient\\" so I am assuming the broth was brewed for too long since it was very RICH. The broth was very heavy and too rich for me. Usually shoyu ramen is light but this shoyu broth was so filling and salty. However, the bite and texture of the noodles were perfect. I really liked how they handmade their noodles!!! Some ramen restaurants buy their noodles and I feel like it doesn't sincerely show their effort and dedication? Maybe it's just me and I'm dumb  The toppings were not very plentiful and quite underwhelming (not anything special) just two slices of chasu, a marinated egg, bamboo sprouts, green onion and a sheet of nori. ‚ÄºOH ALSO I ALMOST FORGOTÔøΩ?When I go to a ramen place, I always drink some of the broth to taste the depth and flavour, however this broth was SO OILY THAT I IMMEDIATELY GOT A HUGE PIMPLE ON MY FOREHEAD AFTER EATING IT. I've been trying so hard to keep my skin clear and look somewhat decent/ presentable it makes me sad  The price is this ramen isn't bad at all, everytime I find a meal that costs less than $10 it SHOCKS me and makes me EXCITED. I MIGHT  come here again since I am extremely poor but if you want that quality broth don't come here expecting that. The noodles are really good though! \\nRating: 7/10"},{"name":"Hand Roll Sushi","address":"12200 Menta St","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I personally like this location better than the Metro West location, even though the commute is twice as long.

Not sure where the apple or fennel went, because all we got was cabbage with some red onion. The taste was also solely of raw cabbage with there barely being any sauce on it.\\n\\nPork belly taco - Lots of asian flavors with the peanuts and mandarin oranges. Mainly overloaded with the slaw, but the pork belly was at least decent when I finally got a bite of it.\\n\\nPork al pastor taco - Wish there was more pineapple even though it tasted like it was from a can. The pork was meh, overly chewy.\\n\\nButter chicken taco - We all agreed that the rice in the taco was unnecessary as it didn't impart any flavor at all and just gave an odd texture. The sauce was mildly close to the real thing.\\n\\nKorean kimcheeze taco - We didn't even realize this was the kimchee taco when we saw it on the plate, because there was practically no kimchee on it. Literally only 3 minuscule pieces. How does that even count as a kimchee taco??\\n\\nIt's cute that they serve their drinks in Mason jars, although I've never seen beer served that way.

Terrible Apple Crisp 0/5: Sabrina, our server, rambled off some deserts (wish they had a printed desert menu for the table)- i asked her to repeat what she said the second desert in her list was and she said she didnt know.

My advice to management: PLEASE train your servers to be more graceful and warm in the way they put down plates on the table- they seemed so rough and ill mannered to serve properly.

I was the only customer.  They had the buffet set up for $7.99.  It looked and smelled delicious, but, I just can't dig buffets.  I asked if I could order from their menu and they said yes, no problem.  Cool.  Immediately after being seated the waitress brings me a carafe of water and a fresh salad.  \\n\\nAs I sat reading the menu I started wondering where the customers were.  I mean it's almost high noon and I'm the only one dining.  That is never a good sign.   Given the fact it smelled so damn good I wasn't about to leave.  I liked how the menu was layed out.  Apps; Wraps; Soup; Rice; Grill & Tandoor; Curries; Vegetables; Bread; Desserts; Drinks; Kids; Sunday Special.  Simple and easy.\\n\\nMy waiter comes over and I begin to order.  I asked for the chicken lollipops for my appetizer and he says \\"they're not ready yet\\".  \\"Oh\\".  \\"Well, how about these pastry things?\\", I asked.  Again I got a \\"no\\".  Suddenly he says \\"let me show you what is ready\\".  Turns out a few appetizers and a couple of the main entrees.  Apparently the full menu isn't available for lunch.  :(\\n\\nNot to worry though.  In a place like this I know I'm gonna find something that I like.  I did Chicken Wings for my appetizer and Chicken Tikka Boti Masala for my main course with Paratha Naan.    I couldn't wait to begin my feast.  As I sat waiting I finished my salad and really wished I had a glass of red to go with the Masala dish.  That would've been swell.  Food took 25 minutes to come out, but, I really didn't mind because that tells me they are cooking that shit fresh.  :)\\n\\nMy salad was nice, chilled, fresh and full of cucumbers and onions and lettuce.  Not just all lettuce like you mostly get at the majority of places.  Big score on the salad.  The appetizer and main course came out together.  Sigh.  I got six wings for $7.  My waiter was worried that the wings would be too spicy for me!  Ha!  I was like, \\"Dude, I can fart ghost peppers!\\".  \\"Bring it!\\".  They were deliciously covered in Tabasco (which had some added kick) and were meaty and juicy.  I was thinking \\"How the Hell do these guys know about Tabasco wings?\\".   Good job on the wings!  I have a new wing stop now!  \\n\\nThe Chicken in the Masala was Boti.  I guess that means the meat came from the thighs and drumsticks.  I'd believe that because it wasn't all dried out like regular Tikka Masala can be because it is breast meat.  I could be confused here, but, I am still educating myself with the wonders of Pakistani and Indian Cuisine.  Excellent Masala dish.  Finger licking good it was indeed. Paratha Naan is probably my favorite of the Naans and this one here did not disappoint.  Wasn't the best I've had, but, I wouldn't turn it down.  Ever.\\n\\nThis place was really clean and everyone was really nice and I sweated like a pig.  If ever I am tempted to try a buffet I do believe I would get here promptly at 1100 (when they open) and try this one.  The reason I say that is because on my visit I was like their first customer and I got there shortly after 1140.  Can't wait to go back and try more of their dishes.  Maybe once they get established they'll be able to open the full menu during lunch.

He told me that the nacho bar would be 27.99 and with tax, it would come out to be about $30 per person. In addition he said that the Room would be $80, $40 per hour. I decided that I would cover the Room charge and I went with his suggestion of the $30 per person when I asked for the people to send me money in their invitation.

The oysters were fresh but the mignonette left a strange after taste. The halibut crudo was quite literally flavorless, not lacking robustness of flavor, simply lacking flavor.  None.

My favorite mixes have been the Stumptown Coffee and Salted Caramel (soooo good).\\n-Any weather is ice cream weather so don't think the cold or rain will make it less busy.\\n-They have their usual flavors and they have monthly seasonal flavors, which are DIVINE and change according to what's available locally.\\n-Lastly, they just opened up a store in L.A. for all the Cali folks but the flavors are a little different because they use locally sourced ingredients.\\n\\nTheir ice cream is always just right: not too dense with just the right amount of ice crystals in it.

Naturally, we left our mailer coupons in the other car.  Upon entering, it reminded me of Spoleto's with a brighter atmosphere.  There are clear ordering menus visable for standard recipes, but only a price for the kids menu and not on the build your own pasta, pizza or salad.  You have to ask how much something will be, or how many toppings are included under that price.  The staff is very welcoming, accessible and friendly.  They put good size portions of toppings on adult dishes.  Overall, the cooking time is amazingly quick.  They have a cool conveyor pizza oven and everything is fresh.  It was almost like a Subway for Italian food.  The chicken cacciatore pasta at $8.95 was plentiful and tasty, with a good amount of sauce, just what I was craving and quickly but well prepared with veggies and chicken.  \\n\\n  We went with the house red sauce, but there is a selection of others like blazing (spicy), Alfredo, pesto, bbq, and more.  The mozzarella cheese tasted great as well, and apparently you can choose which type.\\n\\n  We will definitely be back, as it was a quick weeknight option without the lack of parking as at many Dr Phillips Sand Lake Rd restaurants - which made me go elsewhere.  It may feel like it's going to take a long time, like at Subway when you are in a rush, but they are organized and cooking was so efficient.\\n \\n Hopefully we will have our coupon too, but without fear of it breaking the bank.  Our total for 2 adult and 1 kid entrees with beverages, was $29.10 inc. tax.

My husband tends to get a salad (maybe a grilled chicken salad, I think).  My husband and in-laws are big beer fans and so there are some good options here and they are always happy.

Get here by 11:30am during the week, and the line may, if you are lucky, be just at the door.  Their menu is easily marked and provides many options for those with food allergies.  They have a vast selection of gluten free items, even wraps!  I have been here many times, eaten in, and taken food away, and have always had a great experience. The quality of the food is on point, and cooked fresh to order.  I think my favorite food option on the menu still is the wraps.  The food does come with a price ticket.  It adds up fast as you add protein into anything, or add on a drink.  You could argue that Whole Foods lunch can add up fast if you select the heavy salad options from the salad bar.  But, my price tag at Flower Child is consistently around $20 or more for lunch.  So, averages out higher than my Whole Foods runs.  But, it's nice to pamper yourself once in awhile.  \\n\\nThey have Kombucha on tap, as well as wine and beer selections.  The white wine on tap is tasty.

Looking for a nice restaurant while we were in the area, we almost passed on Tre Monte because of the negativity. However, the bartender at another place said that it would be the place he would go, and I've learned that the recommendation of a bartender is worth more than any amount of reviews on Yelp. \\n\\nWe showed up just at opening, sans reservations, on a Saturday evening (12/7). There was already a line at the door, which is a good sign about the food, but we wondered if we would be able to get a table. The fear was unfounded, as the hostess graciously showed us to a table and dropped menus.  Our server, Christina, took our drink order, and was very apologetic that they didn't have onions for Bestie's gibson. No worries - olives work just as well. She came back with our cocktails, recited the specials, and we asked her to give us time to enjoy our drinks; we'd flag her down when we were ready to order. \\n\\nThe menu is a great selection of Italian cuisine, balanced with a few standards. We took our time with our cocktails (the martinis were perfect, by the way) and Christina came right over when asked her about wines. She apologized for us not having a wine list, and returned immediately with one (some excellent bottles in their cellar, and a great selection by the glass). \\n\\nBestie decided right away on the Shrimp Gran Manier [sic], egg-battered shrimp in an orange-flavored sauce, as an appetizer. I fell in love with the Melazana, breaded eggplant with marinara and cheese, covered in a creamy pesto sauce. For entrees, I picked a simple sauteed chicken, covered with prosciutto and cheese, while the rack of lamb caught her fancy. Christina came right over when we were ready to order, and congratulated us on our choices. \\n\\nWe were able to watch the kitchen as they worked. Both of us, having a lot of experience in the industry, marveled at how well the staff worked together in the tiny space. It wasn't long before our appetizers arrived, and they were as delicious as they sounded on the menu. As soon as Christina cleared the empty plates away, she returned immediately with our entrees (which we saw were plated just as she headed to the kitchen area). \\n\\nBestie's lamb was perfect. She had a choice of two sides, and she picked an herbed polenta and grilled vegetables. I accompanied my chicken with a gratin of potatoes, and sauteed spinach with garlic. We took our obligatory pictures and dug in. Needless to say, there was no conversation while we ate, with the food taking all of our attention. Bestie's lamb was cooked perfectly, with a generous portion, My chicken was flavorful, with the right balance between the sauce and the meat (I have a love/hate relationship with cheese - I like a lot of it, but not when it overpowers what's under it). \\n\\nTo finish things off, we ordered coffee and cannolis, something light to balance the richness of the dinner. Both were delicious. When it came time to settle our check, Christina was right over.  \\n\\nI am so glad that we listened to the bartender and not the reviews.

Chopped fried coconut shrimp on a bed of thinly sliced red onions, red cabbage and Jicima topped with fresh totato salsa. The sweet coconut breading from the chopped fried prawns contrasted nicely with the mild bitterness of the cabbage. The addition of the aoli sauce provided a bit of spicy flavor to the overall taco. Both soups were delicious but the black bean was superior to the chowder (IMO). The tostones with chicken was good but could have been presented better and included more chicken.

When you walk in on the street level on 6th street it has a small walk up counter for to go orders, but you can smell the fresh breads being baked and you can see them making bread through the glass.  If you then walk downstairs there is a bunch of seating.  You seat yourself and a food server quickly brings you menus.  The servers are very friendly and they provided very prompt service which is sometimes rare with seat yourself type arrangements.  I ordered a half pastrami sandwich and a snack board as well as a couple of coffees.  The iced mocha was refreshing with just the right amount of sweetness.  The macchiato was bold and hit the spot if you are the non froo froo bitter coffee drinking person like me.  \\nWhen the food came out I thought there was a mistake because the half pastrami was huge.  It wasn't a New York piled high as the sky pastrami that I'm still in search of, but it was good none the less.  \\nThe snack board comes with a sampling of a few different things such as pretzels, beer cheese, chex mix, and homemade mustard. The pretzels seemed to be a tiny bit stale, but they were still good when dipped in the mustard or beer cheese. The chex mix is addictive.\\nThere is also outside seating right next to the river and a couple of ping pong tables.  At first glance you would think you are in San Antonio at the Riverwalk.\\nI love the atmosphere, food, and service here.

I made the waitress clear of what I was doing, but she did not even bother to put the food in so that even one of my plates came out with everyone else's food. Now, I'm not one of those high-maintenance GF folks. If all my friends are going out for pizza, I'll be happy to make due with a salad just to hang out with friends. But seriously, sitting there waiting to eat while I watched everyone else get to eat was torture. Finally, I find out that the waitress has just put my order into the kitchen. After everyone else has eaten. Um, seriously? At this point I'm about to fall off my bar stool because I've had nothing to eat, and as I said, the Cuidado cocktail is pretty awesome.

We stood there for about 5 min and not a single greet was given to us. After standing there we started feeling awkward so we proceed to make our own way and grab a table hoping that the young waiter would notice us. Nope.  Another 7-10 min went by and we still had not been helped. Keep in mind there was barely any people in here and by no means was this place packed by any standards. \\n\\nSo then I decided to get up and went up to this lady who was making sandwiches and asked her if I could have a menu, she had the audacity to tell me that someone will help me out and bring a menu to the table, but not making a big deal about it I insisted I just wanted to see real quick so she went ahead and handed one over. We went back to the our table picked our choice and sat there for another 5 min highly optimistic that the waiter will finally notice us and come to take our order. N O P E. \\n\\nI had to get up and literally go to the cashier and place the order with him directly. We ordered 2 paninis, a creepe and a coffee. We went back to our table and sat there for another 20 min and still no waiter, no coffee, no water. At this point I was starting to get a Lil bit aggravated by the whole situation, so I decided to flag the waiter down (which offered no aoplogies, I should note) and told him my wife had ordered a coffee 25 minutes ago. He said ok and I thought he went to get the coffee but it took another 10 mins for the coffee to show up. Really? 35 mins for a freaking coffee?  Ok, so we got the coffee but still no food. After another 10 minutes the food finally showed up. Yes, it took them a total of 45 min to put out 2 paninis and a creepe. I can only imagine how long it would take them to put out food if the restaurant was remotely full. At the very least the paninis were actually good and so was the creepe, but not good enough to stand for the type of service they have to offer.

I've never been, so therefore I didn't know what to expect. Upon walking in to the establishment, I was blown away at how beautiful the restaurant looked! We walked to the host stand, and when the hostess asked our names, we were led upstairs to our table. The table was adorned with flowers (my lady had brought them earlier as a surprise) and bottle of my favorite wine, which she had also managed to have surprisingly set. Our server, Hanna, suggested the crab cakes as an appetizer, so we said yes! They came out promptly and tasted good. The red onion marmalade and Old Bay aioli really set them off! For our entree, I had the bone-in Ribeye with Maytag gratin potatoes, grilled asparagus and a pancetta truffle jus. My girlfriend had the Chicken Milanese with red pepper cream, basil, and asiago stuffed gnocci. I was blown away! The presentation on both were like a work of art! The steak I ordered, medium rare, came out perfectly cooked, which in the last 2 restaurants we've been to, were over cooked. Her chicken entree was superb; not too much breading, and juicy when cut open. The gnocci were like little asiago pillows that burst with flavor! We couldn't get enough! As much food as we ate, we were starting to feel full, but the manager, Jerad, came by our table to wish me a happy birthday and to let us know that he was sending out dessert! I have a really big sweet tooth, so I was extremely pleased to hear this! The chef was experimenting with a new dessert that wasn't on the menu yet, and wanted to test it out. We were sent a blondie brownie with vanilla bean ice cream, toasted pine nuts with a balsamic fig reduction. The intricacy and sheer genius behind this dessert needs to be recognized. I've never had such an interesting melange of flavors, and I hope it makes their menu.  The service, ambiance, food, and management were perfect!

However, I do have an issue with one particular employee after especially after yesterday. She has made my meal a few times and I will mention one and another of someone else's lunch she made. First with my sandwich. When I got to the counter, she was dragging and lifting boxes on the floor. She noticed I was there and she came to me to take my order....WITHOUT WASHING HER HANDS!!!!  Now everyone else that has assisted me there in the past ALWAYS washes their hands after handling other foods or the register. But not this one!  I was so shocked I just stood there for a moment and then asked her \\"weren't you just moving all those boxes on the floor?\\"  She replied \\"yes\\". Me, \\"don't you think you should wash your hands?\\"  She turned around and washed her hands. Then I told her what I wanted and she was doing the opposite when another co-worker came and I then asked the co-worker to make my lunch. I went there another time and she assisted me, again, she DIDN'T WASH HER HANDS and I had to ask her to!!!!  REALLY?  That's one of the first things your parents teach you when you're young!  Ugh!  So this past Sunday I was there and the person in front of me had ordered a crepe with Nutella and looked like strawberry jam. So another worker made the crepe and had a hard time getting the Nutella out onto the crepe. So the girl that has not washed her hands in the past assisted her and started hitting the Nutella filled spatula onto the crepe making it splatter all over the place and then when she was trying to smear the Nutella in the middle of the crepe......the crepe started moving around and she held it down with the bottom of the Nutella jar!  Yes!  The bottom of the Nutella jar that's probably been in boxes, the bottom of the cabinets, etc!  I'm not a crepe expert because I don't like them but I sure know that's not how they're made!  Couldn't she had gotten another kitchen utensil to hold the moving crepe instead of the bottom of the Nutella jar????  That would have NOT been ok with me. The customer that bought this didn't see any of it because she was at the register but I'm sure if she saw what I was witnessing she would have cringed. As much as I like their sandwiches, if this person is working there I'm going to pass. She seems to work on the weekends.

Years ago, my coworkers and I would come here during our lunch break to shoot pool or play shuffleboard.  I recently returned to D&B with some friends and we all had a lot of fun.  D&B is an adult-oriented establishment, 21 and up only.  Minors must be accompanied by someone at least 25 years old.  I like this restriction because it keeps the atmosphere mature and there aren't a bunch of kids running around.\\n\\nPrices for pool, shuffleboard, and the arcade games are reasonably priced.  The pool and shuffleboard tables are rented out by the hour.  You have to have a D&B \\"Power Card\\" ($2) in order to play the arcade games.  Game credits and game tickets (tickets you win from the games) are stored on your Power Card.  The Power Card makes things very convenient since you don't have to carry around change/tokens or stacks of tickets.  Everything is on the card and you just swipe it in the card reader to play games.\\n\\nArcade games aren't as impressive as they used to be with home consoles becoming more and more impressive.  In fact, some of the games at D&B have graphics akin to the original PlayStation (PS1).  Fortunately, the company has brought in some new machines such as Fruit Ninja and other giant touchscreen games.  Typical of many arcades, there are shooters, racing games (most of them dated), and even a tiring boxing game.\\n\\nAway from the video screens, there are games of skill and games of chance.  Some of the skill games include shooting basketballs, throwing footballs, air hockey, skee ball, and virtual horse racing.  Of course, there are those machines where you have to maneuver a crane to pick up various prizes (such as stuffed animals).  There are also games where timing and chance are involved, such as trying to time moving lights and hitting the stop button when the lights land on \\"jackpot\\" or \\"bonus.\\"  It's tough to do, but very possible.  I was able to hit the targets twice in one night.\\n\\nThe prize room is neat.  You can bring a whole wad of tickets and the employees count the tickets not using a ticket counting machine, but by weighing the tickets on a scale.  They immediately transfer the value of the tickets to your Power Card for you.  Most of the prizes are junk, IMO, but there are some cool gifts to be had such as video games and even an iPad 2.\\n\\nD&B serves food and they do have a dining area with comfy booths and a fireplace to boot, though you can also eat your food in and near the gaming areas.  D&B's menu mostly consists of bar food -- nachos, fries, burgers, sandwiches, salads, steaks, etc.  I've tried a few things off the menu here, such as the chicken tenders, and the food is pretty standard chain quality.

We all started with a different Appetizer.  The mezzaluna was very tasty and a nice surprise. The muscles were substantial in size and again, very tasty. There were three Arancinni balls per serving, however they were over cooked and lacked flavor.  \\n\\nWe ordered the pork chops, chicken parmigiana, veal piccata and the salmon as well as the bolognese.  The pork chops were huge and very, very tasty it could actually feed two. The veal piccata was tasty but not over the top as it should have been because it was a special.  The Salmon,also a special and was very good. The bolognese was served in a cream sauce which was very watery and the pasta was over cooked.   The Chicken Parmigiana was a decent size put seemed it was pre cooked and just reheated.  Overall the food was fair.  Now on to the desserts which are a totally different thing.  The chocolate cake was huge and tasted amazing.  The carrot cake too was huge and so moist. You can't go wrong and ordering a dessert.  \\n\\nOverall the food is good but some dishes could have been better.   \\n\\nThe atmosphere was nice and the bar was fun.

Why? Because they're the perfect solution. In fact, they're such a good solution that \\"they'll ruin your life.\\" My experience at Istanbul'lu felt like what I imagine the intense high of drugs would feel like.  \\n\\nStay with me . . .\\n\\nI grew up in Dubai.  Dubai draws people from all over the Middle East and Southeast Asia to its prosperity.  They bring with them authentic, unblemished recipes. These recipes are unfiltered and straight from grandma's recipe book, in direct contrast to the amateur \\"ethnic\\" food in Boston.  As a result, I'm an ethnic food snob.  I gave up on currries, shawarmas, and kebabs in Boston in 2011.  Then I read a review of Istanbul'lu by Tim G. and half-heartedly suggested it to my girlfriend for a date night because I couldn't think of anything else. She's from Jersey so at least it would be novel for her. Enthusiastically, she made a reservation for Saturday evening.\\n\\nSaturday evening came and we walked into the restaurant. I was cautiously stoic and she was excited. The second I walked in, I was in a different world. First, there was an explosion of color. (This is where the drug metaphors kick in.) Hanging on the walls were beautiful carpets with psychedelic embroidery.  The booths were embroidered with similar patterns and shades. Any wall space that was not filled by carpet was filled with paintings and photos from a different era that elicited a mellow sense of nostalgia. This felt like smoking genetically-engineered weed.  It put the both of us in a serene mood throughout dinner.\\n\\nThe waitresses were warm, friendly, and all smiles. They greeted us as if they had been waiting for us their whole lives. Not that it matters, but they were cute too. And not generic, all-American cute, but exotic, exchange student cute. I'm not saying it's crucial for business but it helps.  Speaking of which, they were extremely helpful. They didn't hesitate to point to their favorite dishes when my girlfriend asked. And I was impressed that they didn't point to the most expensive dishes on the menu. They seemed genuinely passionate about the food and were overjoyed that we were taking an interest in the details. We placed our orders and they brought out Turkish bread and a tomato-chili dipping sauce.\\n\\nEnter heroin-like high. The second I bit into the sauce-dipped bread, my eyes rolled back into  my head. Thank goodness my girlfriend is avoiding carbs or we would have had a cutlery fight to the death to get the last drop of sauce.\\n\\nAfter finishing all the bread and shamelessly licking the square container of sauce, I felt like a junkie who was coming down. The high was subsiding and I wanted more. My neck jerked, bird-like, towards the waitresses who were watching and laughing their heads off. I grinned maniacally as my girlfriend began texting all her exes.\\n\\nIt worked.\\n\\nFive minutes later, they brought out two heaping plates of hot food.  My girlfriend ordered the Tavuk Kebab, a chicken breast dish served with a side of: (1) a really hot chili pepper; (2) two potato wedges; (3) a sweet pepper; (4) roasted tomatoes; and (5) rice.  \\n\\nI ordered the Askin Dorugu (pronounced OSH-kin), a thinly sliced lamb dish with sides of: (1) a really hot chili pepper; (2) two potato wedges; (3) a sweet pepper: (4) roasted tomatoes: (5) rice; (6) on a bed of buttered pita bread.\\n\\nI immediately speared a piece of lamb with my fork like it was still alive and trying to escape.  The second it hit my tongue, a whole palette of flavors exploded in my mouth. I had finally gotten my fix after withdrawing from the tomato-chili dipping sauce. I immediately went into autopilot. I started shoveling the food in. My girlfriend no longer existed. The LSD decor no longer existed. It was just me and the constantly mounting pleasure from the flavors and textures exploding in my mouth. Occasionally, I broke off to babble romantic nothings to the cringing beauty sitting across from me. Then I looked down and saw that there was only a small piece of pita left. Cringing beauty had done nearly as much damage. But she finally gave up and put a slice of chicken on my plate. I went through it like a wood chipper.  It blew my mind further. It was chicken breast, but it was as succulent and flavorful as chicken thigh.\\n\\nAfter paying the (very reasonable $40) check, I scooped my belly off the table and dragged it across the carpet and out of the restaurant. I looked like a pregnant Basset Hound and was still high as a kite from the perfection that was the Askin Dorugu. Sooner or later, withdrawal will set in and I will need to go back. Until then, I will be singing the praises of Istanbul'lu to anyone who will listen.\\n\\nI give Istabul'lu 6 stars out of 5.

Part of the reason I love Sunshine Seasons is because it diverges from the typical assortment of theme park food options (burgers, nuggets, etc.) and offers a range of healthy, fresh, and flavorful fast-casual cuisine. Satu'li takes this concept to the next level with innovative, dare I say immersive options that make you feel like you've been transported to another world (or in this case, a moon orbiting another world).\\n\\nSatu'li does not necessarily have an extensive menu, but you have a few choices to make off the two main options - bowls and pods. With the bowls, you can select a protein (wood-grilled chicken, sustainable fish filet, slow-roasted beef, or chili-spiced crispy tofu), base (quinoa and vegetable salad, red & sweet potato hash, mixed whole grain & rice, or romaine & kale salad), and sauce (charred onion chimichurri, black bean vinaigrette, or creamy herb dressing). The steamed pod options include either cheeseburger or vegetable curry, served with root vegetable chips and vegetable slaw. All options range from $10.99-$12.99. Desserts include chocolate cake and Satu'li's famous blueberry cream cheese mousse.\\n\\nOn both visits, I opted for the chicken bowl with mixed whole grain base and creamy herb dressing sauce. Wow was it delicious! The ingredients tasted incredibly fresh in what can only be described as a high-quality fast casual dish. The chicken was full of flavor and the sauce played a perfect complement to the mixed grains and rice. The serving size was also generous and the presentation outstanding (just look at the photos and you'll see). My wife ordered the fish bowl with potato base and chimichurri sauce, which was also incredibly flavorful and fresh. Meanwhile, another member of our party ordered the cheeseburger pod, which he described as \\"good\\". The presentation makes the pods look truly alien, but I suppose it's not quite as delicious as a typical cheeseburger. Additionally, the blueberry cream cheese mousse was incredibly unique and very tasty. It has a cheesecake consistency with a light flavor that neither overpowers nor underwhelms. I would certainly order it again.\\n\\nThe other nice thing about Satu'li? The ambiance! I never felt rushed and I really wanted to spend time enjoying the details scattered around what's supposed to be an old RCA facility from the Avatar movies now taken over by Alpha Centauri Expeditions. As you enjoy your meal (indoors or outdoors), tranquil music from James Horner's Avatar score puts you in a relaxed mood.\\n\\nAnother element that diverges from the typical theme park meal is that you get real utensils! Picture Panera Bread here. Your meal is served in a real ceramic bowl or plate and you pick up real silverware to eat your food with. It's really a nice touch!\\n\\nFinally, the service here (as expected) is excellent. On both occasions I brought my dishes and utensils over to the garbage to clear off the little food left and sort the dishes... only to be interrupted by a Cast Member saying \\"no no... you go enjoy your vacation. I'll take care of this.\\" I also enjoyed the efficiency of the line and the courtesy of every Cast Member in the place (again, as expected).\\n\\nSatu'li has won my affection.

I once heard a rumor that the vastly inferior Bangers tried to buy their sausage recipes and were sent away empty handed. The breads from the bakery here of such quality that any sandwich shop worth salt uses bread from Easy Tiger. \\n\\nEasy Tiger has an amazing selection of beer and whiskey. The employees always seem to be very knowledgeable about both and always offer the best advice! \\n\\nThe inside bar is a great place to chill alone and discuss the beer selection with the bartender but the beer garden outside is an awesome place to sit and enjoy beer with a group of friends as well. There's a little bit of everything you could hope for in a bar at Easy Tiger. They have an amazing happy hour that always has great deals on craft beer. They also have a rather nice wine list if that's something you are interested in. \\n\\nI'm a huge fan of the giant pretzels and beer cheese. All of the goods from the bakery are top notch and you'd have trouble finding better baked goods anywhere in town. I can never resist a good cheese/charcuterie board and Easy Tiger never disappoints there either. They have something for everyone's taste and being able to build your own is a giant plus!\\n\\nThe inside bar is beautifully designed and has an old world bakery/pub look and feel that really relaxes me. The patio has large tables that make the place perfect for business meetings or large groups of friends. The only negative here is that sometimes I feel like the patio has a weird order that I think may come from its proximity to Waller creek. Its totally not their fault that Waller creek sometimes smells like bum pee so I can let that slide but its a good thing to be aware of.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and visit Easy Tiger, bring friends drink laugh and have a great time.

I do love myself a wide array of Mexican food, and feel as though I am a good judge of what is good/authentic Mexican food, Tex-Mex, and the like. I can definitely tell you that Chuy's is not it. \\n\\nI made the mistake of choosing Chuy's because I read in a local Orlando newspaper that it was a new restaurant in the Orlando/Kissimmee area. Thinking we were experiencing some sort of local, authentic fare, you can imagine my surprise when we arrived to find it, eerily similar to a Mexican version of TGIFriday's. Being open to the experience, we sat down scanning the drink menu, wanting to numb the situation as quick as possible. We ordered our margartias from our server who was a bit too over-the-top excited, but not knowledgeable about the menu at all. \\n\\nWhile we are talking about the menu, let's discuss the fact that it is limited of authentic tex-mex options, and they have something actually called \\"Elvis Green Chile Fried Chicken\\". What? Why are we bringing Elvis into this? And what does Elvis have to do with anything? They also have what they refer to as the \\"Elvis Presley Memorial Combo\\"- WTF? Elvis is rolling over in his grave as we speak about this issue, I just know it. Let's have a bit more respect for the King, shall we?\\n\\nWe ordered a couple of veggie options, and without hesitation, the server brought out the wrong meal to us. Having worked in the restaurant world for many years, I send nothing back to the kitchen, so we made do with what we had. What we ordered were the Veggie Combos, what we got were the Veggie Enchiladas, which were bland and tasteless. Thankfully, we had a basket of tortilla chips to do the trick with our margaritas washing down the pain.\\n\\nThere were WAY too many servers on staff, many of them were standing around stalking tables looking for something to do. I felt for our server who only had us, and one other table in her section, but with the lack of menu knowledge and messing up our order, maybe there was a reason for that.\\n\\nSo, visitors to the Kissimmee area, do yourself a favor and drive away from the Irlo Bronson Hwy area for dining options.

I rated them five stars after a single visit a couple of years ago, which honestly, in retrospect was more like 4 star, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt that service was usually better as there was an unusual customer situation going on at the time. \\n\\nAnyway... let's just get this out of the way. The food is DELICIOUS. I'm a vegetarian and truly appreciate the veggie broth option. I've ordered from here countless times (both dine in and take out... ). They have a lot on the menu, and we usually stick to the pho, but I've had a noodle dish in the past that was amazing. \\n\\nMy issue with iPho time and time again, is that the front staff is LAZY. They're very friendly and funny, but they are slow to clean tables, slow to pack food up, slow to pick up the phone, and just generally... not interested in delivering the best customer service they can (often goofing off chatting in the front even with customers trying to get their attention). I've worked in food service before, and this isn't the norm for me in the slightest. \\n\\nWhether they are packed to the gills and legitimately busy, or have just 1-2 tables dining in, I have always experienced this same slow service. For this reason (and the fact that we like the way they package their take out in a way we can completely customize our soups and keep the noodles from getting soggy) we always end up just ordering our food to go. I'll keep coming here for the food, and the food alone (and whoever's running the show in the kitchen because the food is consistently great!).

B","city":"Happy Valley","stars":"3","text":"I fell for the hype~!!!!\\n\\nI normally wouldn't write a review for a chain franchise, but this one was worth doing, and since I'm the first review here I'll do a little more in depth.  Jimmy John's has been springing up all over our city, and this one is close to me, with another opening soon down in the Clackamas Promenade.\\n\\nSo okay, I've seen the fun commercials, and heard people at work talking about it, so I gave in and decided to check this place out a few times, try a few different subs and see.  My first thought is always, it's a freaking sandwich let's not get too excited.  I'm a marketing and promotions guy after all, so I know what I'm saying, or so I thought.\\n\\nJimmy John's does a lot of things right.  It is 'freaky fast' for sure.  At the height of the lunch hour you will not be standing in line very long, and by that I'm guessing 5 minutes max.  No waiting for the nervous couple wondering aloud if they should try siracha mayonaise or whether toasting the bread will ruin the essence of the 'meat product' with turkey flavoring.  \\n\\nThe subs and clubs here taste like real food.  I could actually taste provolone!!!!!  Yay!  It's 5.25-6.25 plus drink, chip, and pickle options. There are only two bread options, square 7 grain(not so hot) and the white french bread which I really liked and I'm a hearty whole grain guy.  Sure, you don't get 100 different sandwich options, and you don't get a lot of specialty things, but you don't need it.  They have really captured the young professional/blue collar vibe that just wants four things.  Affordable, healthy-ish, tasty, and fast.  I know of cafe's that serve the same quality foods and gut you for $12 and you better believe that drink would be extra!\\n\\nOne thing I like is that there is a truly positive vibe flowing.  You walk in and everyone jumps for joy and welcomes you.  Very refreshing, especially for a new (to PDX at least) franchise trying to get a foothold in the market.  You get simple fixings, i.e., tomato, cucumber, lettuce, peppers, meat and cheese and a few extra nice things like oregano and oil and vinegar.  Spreads are also simple, mayo and mustard.  Thing is, there is a very easy ordering system and you can leave off what you don't want.  They are very customer service oriented, and even if the manufactured excitement is required for each employee, you don't feel as if they are forced to wear pieces of flare and up-sell you on something.  They hire the correct personalities for the job, and it certainly isn't for everyone.\\n\\nThey deliver in a very fast manner, responding to multiple phones and within minutes it's on the way.  Not easy to organize this in Portland but they manage to capture the 1-3 mile area around each store pretty well.\\n\\nStandards could be a bit higher for cleanliness when it comes to seating.  There were footprint marks on my seat, and the table hadn't been wiped.  Mildly frustrating when you see eight employees on the floor.  Bathrooms have a sense of humor, you'll have to see for yourself.  Also there is some great signage around the lobby.  If you are an uptight conservative, you should probably pack your lunch and sit in your car by yourself.......which you probably do anyway.\\n\\nOnly other thing that could be an improvement is the loudness when you are sitting and eating inside.  Music is a bit high volume, and with so many employees there is a lot of background noise that makes sitting and enjoying your meal a bit difficult.  Considering 90% is take away and delivery, I'm guessing this isn't an issue for most people.  For me I like to sit and enjoy.  It won't keep me away, but it would be a more pleasant atmosphere.\\n\\nBottom line: If you relax and have fun with it, this is an awesome place to grab a quick and tasty lunch.

We visited on Sunday evening , arrived and watched 3 or 4 groups that came in after us get seated first. Finally the hostess realized the mistake and sat us. We ordered two 28 oz. porterhouse steaks medium, fries crispy and salad with no onion. Salad arrived after a nearly 20 minute wait with onion, and eventually our steaks came out with a manager to ask us to cut into the steak to make sure they are cooked properly because his words \\" steaks are tricky to cook near the bone\\" ?? Well he must have been right because the meat was rare just past the edge and raw near the bone. Told the waiter when he returned and he replied sorry about that and left. No manager no take the steaks back or even an offer to do so. The waiter came back a few minutes later and asked if we needed anything I replied a grill to finish cooking our steaks, his reply and I quote \\" sorry about the meat\\" . We again waited for the manager or something , again no visit, on the way out the manager was standing by the hostess stand and I showed him the unfinished steaks and the rare to raw meat, again he remarked about the trickiness of cooking steak by the bone. I told him the rare was no where near the bone . His reply was can I give you a dessert ? We told him we were leaving and he said when we come back we should ask for him???? What a waste of money and I hope this keeps others from having the horrible experience we had.

I mean, there isn't much of a view for sitting on the outside anyway since it's just off on a highway. But on a positive note, this is relatively close to Disney World and a great place to unwind after having a heavy day of activities.\\n\\nOur waitress was fairly nice but inattentive in my opinion. We started out with free chips as starters, and our waitress only gave us the salsa as a dipping but by the bar area, there is a meat sauce that you could choose, a cheese sauce and some green colored sauce. The cheese sauce was my favorite and had a kick of spice in it. \\n\\nWe ordered the fish tacos, steak burrito, Monday special (enchiladas), and beef soft tacos. Please do not get the beef soft tacos because it is basically the meat sauce that you can get for free to accompany the fries, put onto a soft shell and served to you!! However, I enjoyed my fish tacos. They were cooked to perfection and I enjoyed the sauce that they lathered on top as well. Topped with the tomatoes and salad that they have on the side, you could not go wrong with this. The enchilada was a little spicy for my liking and I wasn't too pleased with the tortilla used to wrap it. \\n\\nWhen paying for our bill, we waited so long for our waitress to come back that we just stood up and went to the cashier ourselves to pay for it.. where our waitress told us to sit down and she would handle it.

The menu is large and everything sounds delicious. I ended up going with the Vietnamese Crunch salad and adding chicken. I don't know, but $14 for a salad is a little pricey in my opinion, but I may be in the minority here. \\n\\nI don't know, nothing really stood out and was exceptional here. I did notice that there didn't seem to be any recycling receptacles which was disappointing - both their water cups and the other drink cups could be recycled. \\n\\nOverall, I just feel like this is an overrated restaurant; it's expensive and I feel like you can go to Whole Foods and get similar items for slightly less.

The milk tea took five minutes to come out, and I immediately dove into it, hoping for that delicious sweetness to hit my tongue. Instead, I found it lacking. Very lacking. Very little tea flavor. Watered down. The pudding, too, tasted a little unusual, also lacking sweetness.

To sum up my experience: food was amazing, service was awful. Here'a a breakdown!\\n\\nThe Wait: So we knew the wait would take a while and when we arrived the next available time for inside seating was 9, two hours after we showed up. So we opted for the outdoor seating, a 45 min wait. The cool part was that I gave them my number so I could receive a text when the table was ready. That gave us an opportunity to walk around and explore, which was fun! \\n\\nThe Food: The food was absolutely amazing. We tried the gator tacos (which tasted like chicken, so you should try some) the chipotle creamed corn, the biscuits, and split chicken and waffles. I was happy to split the food with my boyfriend because the chicken and waffles were huge. The biscuits were so good that I would've eaten them all myself, so if you're going with 3 or more people, order many biscuits. \\n\\nThe Service: The service was probably the worst part of this place. We were seated outside, and it was a little windy, but that's ok, can't control the weather. When we sat down our napkins were wet for some reason, odd but oh well. Our waitress came over and didn't say a word, just looked at us, so we tried to order quickly. My boyfriend couldn't figure out what to eat and we asked for more time, and our waitress didn't really get it, and continued to stand there. After asking again for more time, she walked away and don't come back for 25 minutes. When we ordered, we waited a while for food, which I understand because it was so busy. But our food seemed to take a longer time than everyone else around us, who sat down at the same time as us.\\n\\nWe didn't really see our waitress again until we were almost finished and she refilled our glasses with water. The manager came by and had more personality while clearing our table than our waitress did all night. I think what bothered me the most was that our waitress sat down a couple behind us and gave them such a nice welcome, talked to them and was so attentive. When we sat down all we got was a cold stare. \\n\\nOur meal overall took an hour and a half, a little took long when you're seated outside when it's chillier. I would rate this 3 stars off of the service but the food absolutely saved it. I'd love to come back but I'll definitely try to sit inside next time!"},{"name":"Chevys Fresh Mex","address":"12547 State Rd 535","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"Definitely don't understand any bad reviews posted for this restaurant!

My boyfriend ordered a combination with an enchilada, flauta, and Chile relleno. We both loved our meals. The flautas were amazing! And the little side corn thing was really good as well.

First off, our food came on in less than 10 minutes and throughout the meal we must have had someone checking on us to make sure we were all smiles about every 10 minutes (with Thomas, the owner, coming by to say hi as well).

Highly recommend!\\n\\n- The Shrimp & Sausage Taco: Holy. Moly. This thing was equal parts tangy, sweet, savory, and creamy. I loved the pickled onions on top that added just a hint of spice. \\n\\n- The Butter Chicken Taco: Heavenly. Buttery. Perfection. Ok, I'll admit I picked off the jalapenos (I'm a wimp), but there's no doubt why this is a fan-favorite. \\n\\n- Sweet, Ripe Plantains: Ok, so I hope I'm not way off base in saying that everyone's favorite part of a sweet plantain is the burnt crunchy/chewy edges. But it's a fact. Pig Floyd's seems to understand that and celebrate it with plantains that are wonderfully caramelized and pair perfectly with a savory dish.\\n\\n- Apple Fennel Salad: This salad is PLENTIFUL. Meaning, a side of it will feed two people. It's a much more subtle flavor than most of the other dishes which makes it the perfect side. Sweet, vinegary, refreshing!\\n\\nWhelp- there you have it!

Most of the ingredients in each dish are replaced with whole grains, reduced or fat free and zero carb alternatives. Basically, the \\"bad\\" stuff is swapped out.

I can eat a frightening amount of sushi, so pay as you go mean I'd be paying more than I make in a week. Might be a slight exaggeration, but you get the idea. \\n\\nThe go to place for the fam was Minado in Natick, an AYCE buffet. However, all things considered, I think this place is a little better on several fronts, namely overall quality and price. I do have to give points to Minado for selection, service and ambiance, though.\\n\\nQuality of fish is spectacular: the sashimi especially shows this. No weird smells, textures, or anything that would suggest the quality being anything less than five stars.\\n\\nSome other highlights, if you will: Tartar (both Tuna and Salmon) were A-OK. While overall the dishes were pleasant, it felt more like a pur√©e (i.e. almost as if it was ground). Flavor was there, certainly, but texture is important to me, and it didn't quite hit the spot.\\n\\nPepper tuna was awesome! Thin slices with sauce, and not overly peppery. Through, to be fair, I have reduced sensitivity to black pepper (if this was the ingredient). My only note is that I did find it, perhaps a little overdressed (over-sauced?). The flip side of this is if you also get sashimi, you can use the sauce to enhance it!\\n\\nAs for the rolls, I don't have specific remarks about each one. However, overall they were just right! They weren't the kind you get at a gas station or pre-packaged, and they weren't extravagant either. \\n\\nThe rice was of high quality. Alas, Minado went to machine-made rice, whereas here it is still made by hand. Say what you will about our future robot overlords, but give it up for the humans!\\n\\nAlso, the deserts! Usually places like this have deserts that are \\"meh\\", but here they were great. I especially remember the fried ice cream.

I am used to eating family style, though the portions are not what I consider family style. They are individual portions and on the smaller side.\\n\\nBurmese Red Pork stew - Just okay. It was a braised sweet pork served over a bed of white steamed rice and topped with an egg both ways (fried and boiled). Having grown up eating Burmese cuisine, there was nothing reminiscent of Burmese flavors and spices. The marinated boiled egg with the sweet pork reminded me more of the Taiwanese pork rice dish. \\n\\nBreakfast Board - Good! I liked the simplicity of the ingredients that all came together.

The decor is fun and speakeasy-themed, the staff are friendly and attentive and the location can't be beat - right off the T. \\n\\nThey change up the menu depending on what's fresh, but you can't go wrong with the veggie scramble. On this occasion, the eggs were scrambled with spinach, fresh mozz and something else that's escaping me. Served with a mixed greens salad topped with summer squash and lightly dressed with a vinaigrette, thick cut lightly buttered multi grain toast and the best breakfast potatoes this side of the Charles IMHO. Sliced long, extra crunchy, lightly salted and mixed with crunchy kale bits...potato perfection!

Now time for the cons, so we showed up around 8:30 and they close at 10, we were informed they were out of all of the meats but chicken and pork. I 100% understand if I came in right before they closed and they said this but an hour and a half before is bad, I was annoyed because most of the entrees I wanted had brisket but they were able to sub the meats for the entrees, ok fine. When we get ready to order, we were informed they now only had chicken (at least I was able to narrow down what meat I wanted ÔøΩ?. We got the corn, fries and rice and beans as sides. We then sit down and some on staff came to tell us they were out of rice, eek ok, so we got green beans and beans.

I ordered the bourbon burger which uses actual liquor so anyone under 21 cannot order this burger. Their are other items on the menu aside from actual drinks that also feature this disclaimer so look out for that. The burger was pretty good, juicy! The fries were crisp to perfection. I also ordered a martini which was a little on the strong side. While it did pack a punch the fruity flavor combination complimented the drink.

A cool option on the menu is their mix and match where I got the brown rice, sweet potatoes, and brussels sprouts with chicken ($14). When it comes to sweet potatoes and brussels sprouts, I am very easy to please.

I got a Groupon some time ago wanting to try this place out. The menu items seem very good. There weren't many options but a variety that's enough for everyone. The price is a bit on the higher end so you'd expect the food to be somewhat pretty good. \\n\\nWe ordered the mussels to share, which was very good. It was cooked just right, not overcooked where the meat was still tender and moist. It also came with 2 thin slices of grilled bread which was the best I've had. \\n\\nI ordered the Filet Mignon which came with mash and asparagus. The meat was more on the Rare side that I ordered but it was better than if it was overcooked so I was ok with it. The mashed was very creamy. The Asparagus wasn't as good as I would have liked. You can taste the vinegar on asparagus and it wasn't necessary since it was grilled. \\n\\nMy daughter ordered the Pasta con Frutti de Mare, which came with half a lobster (this was not specified in the menu) shrimp, scallops (a few VERY thing slices, again not specified in menu), over roasted tomatoes, basil in a Lobster saffron sauce with house made pasta. The dish was very tasty. The pasta was fresh and firm. The menu didn't say much about lobster but was hopeful it was a whole tail but it was only half. The dish by itself was very good. \\n\\nFor Dessert we ordered the cheesecake which was topped with pineapples and asian pear bits in a pineapple sauce, i think. The dish, again was very good. The cheesecake wasn't too creamy-like nor heavy so it was very tasty. \\n\\nThe service - this was where I was disappointed. The waitress seem like she was in her late teens, early 20s. She came around and poured water. It took awhile before we ordered and she wasn't coming back to the dining room to help or make eye contact with us. I can see her cleaning around the bar from where I sat. My daughter had to raise her hand to get her attention. After we ordered, she brought soem bread slices over. The bread was warm and slightly toasted with a plate of olive oil. It was very good. We were now starving so we ate the bread pretty quickly. It took her another 10 minutes before we had to call her attention again and asked for more bread. The Appetizer didn't come out until 20 minutes later. We finished it within 10 mins and we sat in silence as we waited for our entrees to come out. She returned a couple of times to ask how the food was. Finally we were ready for the bill. I gave her the groupon as we ordered Dessert. \\n\\nWhen the bill came, everything was taken off as it should, except there was a 18% gratuity added. Not that I mind much about it being added but it's the principle of me, as the customer, wanting to give the amount I felt appropriate for my dinner experience. \\n\\nIn my previous experience with dining with my friends we've always been generous tippers, averaging 18-20% depending on the places we go. I asked the waitress why was gratuity added it. She said it was company policy for groupon users. That again made my heart sink. What if i wanted to give more because service was great? you've just lost out on money. This was just not exactly the best service considering we sat there for 2 hours and we were the only 2 people in the entire dining room, and only a handful of people at the bar side. \\n\\nI was extremely disappointed in the service although food was pretty good. This was the reason why i gave it 2 stars.

The phony family atmosphere, the true Italian food = love message, servers with perfect teeth and straight A smiles? If you're anything like me, the very existence of multiple Olive Gardens puts you off any sort of Italian food - any time, anywhere. \\nRino's is the absolute antidote to any sort of poison fed us via the \\"unlimited salad and bread sticks\\" empire. This tiny restaurant is flawless. Worth the trip to Eastie? You bet. It's basically a small room with a curved diner-style ceiling with no more than twelve tables. For whatever the room may lack in character (if you're friggin blind), it's more than made up for by a handful of some of the most colorful, endearing, and lovely waitstaff I've ever had the pleasure of bantering with. Indeed, my friends, diners here either feel lucky to have arrived at the local restaurant, or are themselves one way or another \\"part of the family.\\"\\nUpon being seated, grab some wine (they have a really nice bottle of Chianti on the menu for approximately $25), and order up appetizers. Our table's choices:\\n1) The calamari - Not much to say here. With a squeeze of lemon, each succulent piece was lightly breaded, giving way to perfectly fried seafood. (You know... as in not rubbery.) The large portion was also scattered with rings of pickled banana peppers, one of my favorite things. I can't see how anyone would be disappointed with this dish. In all honesty, I was a little surprised that there were no dipping sauces. But guess what? They didn't need them.\\n2) Arancini special - Order this. One order comes with four bigger-than-a-golf-ball, smaller-than-a-baseball arancinis. Each risotto ball was crispy on the outside, creamy and a bit sweet on the inside, perfectly matched with a tangy tomato sauce coating the bottom of the plate. The dish was also topped with shaved Parmesan and a bit of parsley. I will order this again, and fight anyone that stands in my way. \\nThe Big Show:\\nEager to see a good version of a dish I constantly \\"don't get\\", I ordered the bolognese with a pasta that started with the letter F... (wikipedia has failed me in figuring out the exact type). A heaping shallow bowl of pasta arrives at your table: curly, fresh, homemade pasta... swimming in a hearty sauce of ground veal, pork, and beef. Each bite gives way to bits of onion and carrot, completely infused with that incredibly rich, savory sauce. I don't know if I've ever had pasta prepared to order with so much care. I didn't give a crap about bolognese after being burned time and time again by douche bags that love shitty Italian food. I now give a crap. You did that, Rino's. \\nOne of my fellow diners ordered the veal parmigiana. If she had gotten up to go to the bathroom, I would have slid her order into my purse and claimed no knowledge. I think she definitely won the best entree prize, with veal that was pounded until just thin enough: tender, but not so thin that it was overpowered by a crunchy, fantastic breading. Tomato sauce and melted mozzarella wrapped up the best version of veal parmigiana that I've ever tasted. Though the bolognese was good, I will order the veal next time. \\nThe rest of our table also had quintessential, pedestal-worthy versions of classic Italian dishes (pollo braciolentini, lamb shank, braised pork with risotto), but clearly I am running out of room to wax poetic.\\nSo in conclusion, get to Rino's, and bring some people you like. People you don't like aren't allowed here. In getting here, a few tips: 1) Rino's is walking distance from Airport stop on the blue line. 2) If you must park, especially when there's aluminum chair/trash can warfare in Eastie during the winter, take a look at the school a few blocks away. Sometimes there's a spot there, and then you won't be pissing anyone off. 3) Call before venturing out to the restaurant. Remember, it's small, so don't be surprised if they're not taking anymore reservations, but definitely get on the wait list. Odds are, you'll get out to the restaurant, and you'll have a reasonable (completely worth it) wait before being seated inside. \\nGodspeed diners, and to Olive Garden / Carrabas / Buca di Beppo / Bertuccis / Papa Razzi / Macaroni Grill - you all suck and you know it."},{"name":"Beast","address":"5425 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Communal dinning is one thing. I am of the opinion that is acceptable when I am expecting to be entertained by how the waiter will wrap my leftovers. \\nThere are some odd quirks to this restaurant which may throw some people off. Because of its size (im guessing) they have different seating times for dinner. I would recommend making a reservation for one of the times. There are sometimes spaces available on walk up business. However, in the two times I was there the communal seating made it difficult for a party of even two to be seated together. So, plan ahead. The food is outstanding. Some of the best culinary combinations in Portland. Every attention has been given to satisfy our whimsical odd request. \\nWhat can you say about the food? Delicious is not a worthy adjective. Orgasmic comes to mind. Each plate takes you on a journey through your taste pallet. As you finish each plate you could say I am satisfied and yet there appears before you another culinary journey ready to whisk you away. \\nThere are some issues with service. Mainly, everyone is served and cleared and served at the same time. It is not that they take away food however, if you are not done the next plate is hitting the table. Contrast to that is I ate it all and now I am waiting scenario. Sometimes it just works out. Seating with everyone or anyone can lead to less than desirable eating environment.\\nIt is an idea to say this is what the menu is and serve it only. It makes the meal that much more savory in my tasteful opinion because so much detail is given to that course. Food presentation and the visual enjoyment of the meal is top quality. \\nMake reservations. Be prepared to be on everyone's time. You can bring your own wine or take their flights suggestions. I believe the flight suggestions are given the same attention to detail as the plates.

Although our connection wasn't the best, they were very polite and patient.\\nPro: Speedy Delivery. They estimated 35 to 45 minutes for delivery. I expected it to take over 50 min because my apartment is usually hard to find. I am certain the guy was at my door in just under 40 min flat. very impressive for the size of my order, distance, and normally difficult unit to find.\\n\\nCONs: the Food. Where to begin?... the Steamed Dumplings I ordered were so dry and chewy I really had to take pause and remember what I was eating. The accompanying sauce was lackluster in flavor and missed the mark. What I normally love about ordering chinese was only the beginnings of the let downs. The soups... My Hot and Sour Soup was so mundane, I am guessing the gave me egg drop instead. That could be the only logical answer for a soup that could have went from a bag, to microwave to serve. The Wonton soup although uninspired and had no real attention, at least was cooked correctly. My rule of thumb for how well soups are done speaking volumes of the kitchen definitely applied in this case. Now for the overpriced entrees We had the Cantonese Chow Mein, and the Kung Pao Beef. Both were very sorry dishes...  Flavorless although that word is an understatement. Vegetables were not cooked all the way through, and the strips of pork were so tough, chewy, and overdone, I wondered why there was so little of the flavorless sauce. The Kung Pow Beef, yes flavorless, and with undercooked veggies as well... also had one serious pain. It had Zero spice, Zero heat. I double checked the menu just to make sure it was supposed to be a spicy dish, and yes it was. Altogether our dishes were not executed well, and had no flavor or seasoning in them. Did they loose all their salt in the kitchen, Or were these taken from a buffet line that had been sitting out for hours?\\n\\nAnd for the last Con, the Price. I thought I had ordered crab puffs with my order, and with the total coming out to as high as it was, I was certain that I did. When our order came, and I split it up, I noticed the missing crab puffs. I called back; Again the very nice ladies explained that due to our poor connection they did not hear me when I asked for them. They had my order still written down and they repeated it to me this time (they did not repeat the entire order the first time). So yes, going over the menu, I noticed how much higher all the prices were compared to some of our favorite places. That was the nail in the coffin, I feel foolish for spending that much money on terrible food, and what we could have gotten from a number of other places.\\n\\nI have absolutely no intention of going back there.

I liked the congee and the meat, but the person I came here with said the plate of vegetable looked old, and after she had a taste of it, she was right. A moment later when we asked the server about it, she apologized and admitted that was the case because apparently this type of vegetable is more expensive so it's harder for them to financially get them to the restaurant more frequently or something.... that seemed odd but whatever, at least they admitted and apologized for it. \\n\\nBut then that doesn't end there, when we were about half way through that vegetable, she noticed this little worm that you normally find on plant life. We immediately stopped eating it when she found that. Despite how it stunned we were, we kind of laughed it off because at least that worm made us believe their vegetable weren't full of pesticides. That and in the end, the waitress and chef did gracefully apologized for what happened and offered to give us back our money for it.\\n\\n\\nWhile the food wasn't entirely that good, but at least the service was actually very decent.

It is a wonderful experience. The lick your fingers when you're done type of experience. But when you eat it with this bum with a little bit of sauce... It will definitely knock your socks completely off. \\n\\nI also got the street corn and the brisket baked beans. The seasoned corn. Is spicy so if you are not used to spicy corn, remember that I warned you. The baked beans. We're by far the best brisket baked beans I've had in Central Ohio.

There have been times where we just walk right in and go up to the counter, but that is a rarity. Last time we went it took an hour to get through the line. I think it's mostly because everyone is trying a bunch of samples, which, it's really cool that they let you try as much as you want, but not for people who come in knowing what they want. Maybe they should have a sample line and a \\"I know what I want\\" line? But I'm not sure how that would work logistically at this cramped location.

A couple arrived behind us without a reservation and I'm not sure if they were able to accommodate. It was busy and packed. \\n\\nWe ordered an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert. We got the mezzanine ravioli as our appetizer which we thought was ok at first. Then it grew on me after I mixed the sauce a little bit more.

I think maybe there was a bit too much basil for my taste. \\n\\nMy husband ordered the Tortelli di Mele. He loved it. It was savory with a hint of sweetness. You get a taste of apple with the first bite and then the sausage flavor follows. I ordered the Pappardelle Pasta with saut√©ed Sea Scallops. It was equally tasty!

Once you order on your phone, you wait, grab a seat, take a breather, and pick it up. The seating in this cafeteria is plenty. They don't allow you to go inside until you have your food in hand. Since my boyfriend and I didn't have any food in our hands because we were waiting for our mobile order, the \\"host\\" stopped us before we can go into the seating area. But we simply let them know we have a mobile order and they let you in. \\n\\nThis canteen is nicely air-conditioned, spacious, and it's got an African vibe. It was THE place to eat and rest at after long waits for Pandora rides! \\n\\nOverall, the food is decent! The quality and portion were 4/5. We ordered the wood-grilled chicken dish because we literally saw them cooking 20 chickens! It was hard to resist. We did make the right choice. The cheeseburger buns was ordinary but they did filled the spot. However, the veggie chips that came with the dish was BOMB. The blueberry cheesecake mousse was tasty (We totally got it for the presentation -win!)"},{"name":"Maki Maki","address":"40 Cummings Park","city":"Woburn","stars":"3","text":"This is my go-to all-you-can-eat sushi place! Even though it's about a 50 minute drive, it's always worth it. For an AYCE place, the menu is expansive and the quality of the sushi is good. There's lots of amazing specialty rolls, I highly suggest the magic box! In addition to rolls, nagiri, and sashimi, there's lots of side dishes to order from like seaweed salad, shu mai, and fried rice. Some desserts are also included in the $27 price, but even for those where you have to pay, they're only $3-$5 extra.\\n\\nThere are also happy hour drinks, $5 for each. I got a mai tai and my boyfriend got a lychee martini which was very strong but still tasty. I'm already looking forward to my next trip here!"},{"name":"Guy Fieri's Tequila Cocina","address":"110 Causeway St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Terrible Service and overall bad food.  Went to dinner with friends.  The server seemed to want to get rid of us from the moment we sat down. She was inhospitable and rushed us more than once with our order. Then when our food came out it was incorrect and the man who brought our food tried to tell us it was what we ordered. When you order octopus, and a chicken taco arrives, it isn't correct.  We waited several minutes until someone came over to help us with the incorrect order.  Our server was not available for some reason during this.  We were told a manager would be notified but we were never visited by said manager and we were not docked anything from our bill for this mishap, which delayed one guest's meal while the rest of us ate. Food was meh, guacamole was bland, tacos were dry. Redeeming feature was the decor is cool. Now I see why NY Times food writer gave Guy's restaurant 0 stars.

It's a very small shop, with counter seating and limited table seating. The lamb meat was good; it was presented in meaty chunks instead of the usual lamb strips, but they had good flavor. The pitas they served tasted good, but with the amount of meat (I didn't even get double meat, mind you), the pitas need to be bigger, or else you're going to have most of you gyro toppings off to the side of the wrapper. \\n\\nAlso tried the original coney, and that was good; not sure if it was better than Skyline's coneys, but it was definitely bigger.

Brunch exceeded expectations... probably because it entailed oysters and barleywine at lunch on a Sunday. That's a rarity in Orlando. Try finding one other restaurant in the area that offers both of those items at brunch... you won't!\\n\\nOn to the highlights:\\n\\n-Food: We ordered a round of oysters. They were so good that we had to order a second round! Then, I had the Southern Forager Salad, with ham and tender golden beets. My friend and I also split the biscuits and gravy, which made me reminiscent of breakfasts on my family's farm in North Carolina. I highly recommend ALL of these items.\\n-Beverages: I ordered the barleywine, which is strong and delicious. I also ordered a corpse revivor. Then, I napped really hard that afternoon.\\n-Ambiance: As always, love the ambiance here. My friend had been here twice, but had never noticed the brew room, which can be reserved for special occasions. He was wowed. Be sure to explore the restaurant a bit... you'll discover beautiful design details throughout.\\nService: Our server was quick and made WONDERFUL recommendations.

The funny thing was that we went in, saw how busy it was, walked out, and then went back in through the back since it did not seem as busy outside (probably because it was hot as hell outside too). Out back, there were several tables and benches. This was a great first stop to kick off the start of the bachelor party night.\\n\\nAnyways, we walked in through the back as 2 patrons were departing the ping pong tables. There was a perfect place to sit next to the ping pong and the server came out to us to bring us menus. We ordered a round of beers and enjoyed them while playing some ping pong. I can't remember which beer we had but it was pretty decent. The server was quick to get us our beers and check so I guess that's what really matters. \\n\\nI only stepped foot inside the establishment to use the restroom but you could this was a popular spot because the place was packed out.

Thankfully there was never a lack of seats.  The decor inside is nice. A little but industrial and a whole lot of fiesta! \\n\\nFor my meal, I had 2 tacos - 1 chicken and 1 al pastor. The tacos are only served with meat, then you add your own toppings at the toppings bar. I also had a side of chips and guacamole. \\n\\nThe guacamole was good - but for the price of $5.25 I was a bit disappointed with the serving size. Thankfully there were a few homemade salsas in the toppings bar to finish up my chips. The tacos were yummy. The chicken was nothing extremely impressive, but the al pastor has great flavor. Overall, with the addition of the toppings, I was very satisfied with my meal."},{"name":"Salt & Straw","address":"2035 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"We were recommended Salt & Straw by a friend from Pennsylvania that had heard of its delicious reputation and unique, quirky flavors, and it definitely lived up to its hype. The service couldn't have been much more friendly, with our server encouraging us to sample as many flavors as we'd like. The caramel pecan apple pie and the Stumptown Coffee & Burnside Bourbon flavors were my favorites. I opted for the latter and splurged for the house-made waffle cone. Always splurge for the waffle cone. Beware - the portion sizes aren't skimpy. The single scoop was more than enough for me, as much as I would have liked to gorge myself on more creamy deliciousness. As other reviewers have pointed out, be prepared to open your wallet.

We have allergies and while they're not life-threatening, are not something anyone wants to deal with just because they're starving. Management seems to have no clue how to run this place effectively and has no standards or quality control. And no priority to correct the issue other than issue a refund. Thanks for my money back, but we are now STARVING and will have to wait regardless to find something else to eat.

Each dish was very small, and could be ordered separately at $5, which I think would have disappointed me, but the three together made more sense.  Chickpea crepe had goat cheese and eggplant and was my fav of the three.  The other two were also very good, deviled eggs with a punch of roasted pepper and cold mushrooms with an herby champagne vinegar marinade.  We split the lobster gnocchi, as we were not that hungry so it was perfect. Savory and fluffy gnocchi, with tender lobster chunks and shaved roe napped with a buttery nage that had us politely clashing spoons, angling for a last bite.  Sadly refused dessert, as we had some business with a dessert wine waiting at home.

The menu isn't very extensive here, but what you get here is good quality food with what they do offer.\\n\\nI had the slow roasted roast beef with potato hash. The beef was fresh tasting and moist with good seasoning. I liked the potato hash as it was a good compliment to the beef and the fresh taste of the Chimichurri sauce just enhanced everything. The portion size was just enough to fill me up and I didn't leave feeling hungry. \\n\\nThe restaurant had outdoor and indoor seating area, but it can fill up quickly with big amount of people eating here.

Only the small minded who never go anywhere else would think this place is any good.\\nThis is an added comment: \\nAfter having an email exchange with David Cohen about these comments I made I found him to be an arrogant idiot living in denial about the filthy conditions ( which he refused to address.) He pretty much told me Not to patronize his establishment and that he didn't need customers like me. Customers like me meaning someone who doesn't want to eat dirty ,inferior food, served up in minuscule dried up buns and cheap meat prepared by filthy ,hairy, homeless looking people. I would avoid this place like the plague. I have filed a complaint with the health dept. Try Hoodys in Round Rock , Jersey Mikes ( who BTW make a great Cheese steak) or Firehouse Subs ALL of which are far superior to this slop this place serves. They should change the name to Thundercrap subs"},{"name":"Condado Tacos","address":"8958 Lyra Dr","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Super disappointed with our last visit.

My wife is generally less enthused about barbecue than I am, because her love of Pigs keeps her away from pork (on this point we are Poles Apart, as much as I think pigs are adorable, I also think they're delicious).  So when she said she wanted to check it out with me, I wanted to Run Like Hell before she changed her mind. In fact, I've gotten her to come back a couple of times (wow, I was Lost For Words), so you know they're doing something right.\\n\\nThe wait can be pretty crazy, but both time we got lucky and showed up just minutes before the rush that had people waiting in a line out the door.  On my first visit, I ordered the Big Floyd, a masterpiece of meats on a bun, served with really tasty fries.  All of the meats (sausage, pulled pork, and brisket) on the sandwich were amazing together as well as separately. It's a meal that really did Speak To Me, I had to remind myself to Breathe.\\n\\nOn our next visit I decided to try the pulled pork banh mi.  I was concerned at first that it wouldn't be enough for a meal since banh mi is often small, but it's my concern was unwarranted; after finishing the meal I was full and Comfortably Numb. The combination of smoky BBQ flavors and Asian cilantro/daikon flavors was really great.\\n\\nThe menu is small, but the specials change regularly and we haven't yet had anything we didn't care for.\\n\\nWish You Were Here?

Each of the bars - pasture bar, kitchen bar, and brewery bar - holds a different selection of JK's beers... So you have to go to each if you want to catch 'em all. We got a couple \\"tasters\\" that included a 4 oz pour of each beer!

Since that day many moons ago, we have fantasized about the handmade Lobster Ravioli. Finally finding ourselves in Boston last week, we made Rino's Place a priority. And it was AMAZEBALLS.\\n\\nIt was about a two hour wait for a table, so we went for drinks across the street at a cordial bar (also owned by Rino's). I had two delightful espresso martinis.

I decided on Tasty n Sons because the menu seemed very eclectic and not your ordinary brunch menu.\\n\\nThe restaurant is located in North Portland, a few blocks west of MLK Jr Blvd in the HUB Building which itself is a quite an interesting mix of retail shops and restaurants. Tasty opens at 9 am and after getting there just before it opened, I saw a large line waiting outside.\\n\\nThe line moved quickly, but the number of seats available in the restaurant quickly began to lessen. As I went inside, I noticed that there are a number of seating arrangements. Regular tables and countertop seating in the main dining room area. While there is bar seating, a large communal table and a windowfront counter seating. The restaurant has a high ceiling and open feel to it.\\n\\nBy the time I got in front, the staff were telling people that it would be about a hour wait. I was fortunate that I saw and got the last available seat at the bar.\\n\\nThe brunch menu has small and large plates. There are plenty of great offerings here, but I decided on the Moroccan chicken hash ($12). Since I was the last person in, I expected it would be a while till I got my main entree. Hence, I decided to order Stumptown cofee ($2) while I waited and one of the chocolate potato doughnuts ($1.50).\\n\\nI think that I probably had 2 or 3 cups of coffee before my entree arrived. Not a bad thing since Stumptown is good. Prior to the entree arriving, I tried out the doughnut which was hot from the kitchen. It has a somewhat hard exterior, but tasted quite dense. I did like the creme anglaise that the donut came with.\\n\\nFinally, the Moroccan chicken hash came and it was well worth the wait. It has some familiar elements like potatoes and peppers, but some left field additions like cauliflower and olives. Mixing the harissa cream over it does wonders for its flavor. I now have a new interest in cauliflower as a result of trying this dish. It goes without saying that the chicken hash and over easy egg was wonderfully done.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a brunch place with an exciting menu in Portland, Tasty n Sons is a great option.

As soon as we had settled into our seats, co-owner Vincent Vela greeted us with champagne and wished us a happy anniversary. He and his team are also owners of 80 Thoreau in Concord.\\n\\nWe were giddy with joy that evening. My husband and I decided to do the 5-course Tasting of Local Fishes. Instead of doing the Wine Pairing, we opted for a bottle of wine. Their wine menu is extensive (26 pages long), but I was on an Oregon kick, so we ordered a bottle of Brick House Gamay Noir from Willamette Valley. It went quite well with the Tasting Menu. \\n\\nWe actually started off with a complimentary appetizer not included in the Tasting Menu. It was a pair of mini lobster cakes. As if I wasn't giddy enough, after popping this into my mouth, I said to my husband, \\"This is going to be an AMAZING night! Free champagne! Now free food! Yay!\\"\\n\\nOur 5-course began with Scallop Tartare sprinkled with caviar and lentil pancakes. Caviar. Need I say more? It was amazing. Then the 2nd course was Crab Agnolotti, which is a fancier term for crab ravioli filled with crabmeat and mascarpone, then sprinkled with some funky mushrooms called morels. Exquisite! Next was the Bluefish, my favorite! It was broiled to perfection with the skin being crunchy and the fish itself was very moist. If you've never had it, it's very rich and succulent. At this point, I was getting full. Next came the seared tuna with some Uni. What an interesting combination on one plate! The seared tuna was on a bed of kelp, radishes, and fava beans and then some uni thrown in like an afterthought to please their customers. Bravo! Our 5-course Tasting was sidetracked when they gave us 2 complimentary desserts: mini chocolate chip cookies and orange sorbet. More free food! Really? You guys are so amazing. Final course was soon to come....Goat Cheese Bavarian platter enjoyed with a couple of port wines. Perfect finish to an exquisite dinner. And at this point, I was beyond full and thankful I wore a dress one size too big.\\n\\nToward the end of our meal, Vincent visited our table again. Asked how our evening went. Delightful! We congratulated him for receiving Best Seafood Restaurant, and after what we had just experienced, it was well deserved. If you are not into seafood, not to worry, they have a grilled ribeye.

The steak tartare was probably the least impressive dish of the night--and it still had decent flavor. What really made the dish were the mini toasts that were served as vehicles for the tartare--they were very tasty. The rabbit agnolotti was so flavorful and the noodles were perfectly cooked. I loved the texture of the sauce mixed with the currants and pine nuts, as we practically licked the bowl clean.\\n\\nFor our main courses we split the tagliatelle and braised veal cheeks. The tagliatelle was delicious as the flavors of the meat in the bolognese was delicious and the pasta was so perfectly cooked--it was somehow meaty, but light at the same time. The braised veal cheeks were also a huge success. The meat was so tender and paired well with the veggies and polenta that it was served with to create a really scrumptious bite.\\n\\nOverall, though our table wasn't the best (it was right next to the door), we enjoyed our dinner here. The service was friendly and attentive and made great recommendations for food. The food came out pretty quickly and everything was at the top of the charts in quality and flavor.

(For more on that, check out the fun Scott Joseph from the Orlando Sentinel had with his comments on the name). But yes, this is a simple & quiet Vietnamese spot located right across from the WaWa on Curry Ford Rd. The space is nicely renovated - with the perk being that once inside, you can easily ignore the hustle & bustle of cars buzzing by outside. After being open for a few months now, I think they are starting to fall into a groove and business seems to have allowed them to bring in some additional service staff (not that I mind an owner/operator serving tables - but, it is not always a guaranteed strength). \\n\\nThe food is pretty delicious. The beef pho broth is really tasty - a nice earthiness to it, It may be just slightly on the salty side at times, so - as with any pho - I strongly recommend you taste the broth before you start dumping hoisin and soy sauce all over it. The basil, limes, chiles, and sprouts are all very fresh - and I was happy to see the inclusion of culantro with the herbs & condiment plate for my soup. The top round steak is good quality as well. The soup portion here might not be the biggest in Orlando, but you get a pretty healthy portion of nicely cooked al dente noodles - although the portion size of the meats in the combination choices (tripe, meatballs, etc.) can be a little lacking.The summer rolls are good - nothing game-changing - but they get the job done. The banh mi are surprisingly good, too - and probably a little forgotten in all the pages of pho!\\n\\nThe service has always extremely friendly here - attentive, but reserved enough that you can enjoy your lunch/dinner in peace. Feel free to ask for recommendations and allow them to steer you towards something you might like, if you are new to Vietnamese food (or just want to put them to the test). I think they are still working on adding beer & wine, and they should definitely get a website at least with their basic menu on it (after all, it IS 2015 - and this is a must-have for a food business).

I ended up ordering the brisket meal and my friend ordered rib meal. \\n\\nLet's just say when the food came I was not exactly surprised. Both the brisket and ribs were on the plenty of  dry side. Though the food came out rather too quick as if all they had to do was to carve the meat.  Despite asking for the fattiest piece possible, 7/8 of brisket was dry and gamey.  Gave the old gums a workout. Nothing served was hot, as if they were all sitting under some sort of heat lamp. \\n\\nOn the slight plus side, they give you a choice of fries, or potatoe salad.  Coleslaw was meh.  The chilies were lukewarm.  The bbq dipping sauce tasted like cherry cough syrup. The brisket was so dry, had no choice but to dip in the cough syrup to aid swallowing.

Despite booking the reservation on line weeks in advance and getting the reminder of said reservation the day before, when we arrived at our scheduled time they were not ready for us.  While I do not consider a party of 6 to be large, it seems that they were unprepared for a group of that size as the hostess sat us at a small round table that was set for 5, but would have been more comfortable with 4.  They scrambled to get a 6th place setting from an adjoining table as we were handed menus.Needless to say, we were packed in pretty good especially when the lunch plates arrived.\\n\\nLunch was ordered and delivered with mixed results.  The roasted half chicken was well prepared and certainly more then enough food to fill the hungriest of patrons.  Similarly the pork chop with red hot apple sauce was skillfully prepared and delicious.  However, the chicken schnitzel, central burger, and Central BLT sandwiches were dry and accompanies by buns that seemed less than fresh. \\n\\nAll in all I would recommend going with a group of 4 or less or even sitting at the bar, and enjoy an entr√©e or a salad instead of a sandwich."},{"name":"Chianti Cafe","address":"285 Cabot St","city":"Beverly","stars":"3.5","text":"I liked this place a few years ago.

This was my first time trying Winsor. I came with one other person at around 12:30pm on a Wednesday, and almost every seat was taken. We managed to get a table quickly as another party of 2 was just finishing up and leaving.\\n\\nThis place is unlike HLM (and a lot of other dim sum places, I think) in that it's pretty small with limited seating and there are no servers walking around with carts. You get a menu and a slip of paper to mark what you want to order, and servers will bring you the food as it's prepared. This set up makes sense considering the limited space. I also think it's more user friendly for non-Chinese customers like myself, because I can look at the menu (which has pictures and English descriptions) and check off what I want on the paper. I always go to HLM with someone who is fluent in Chinese so they can order for me / ask for certain things from the servers with the carts. Sometimes my friends will order something and I won't really know what it is. At Winsor, the menu/paper slips describe everything in English so I know exactly what I'm getting.\\n\\nAnother pro of this ordering system is that you don't have to wait for carts. At HLM, if the cart that comes by doesn't have what you want, you have to either walk around and find the right cart or just wait until it passes your table. At Winsor, you can order everything at once.\\n\\nThe food was really good. I'd say the taste and quality are similar to HLM (I keep comparing the two because HLM is the only other dim sum place I've tried, and they're very close location-wise). The steamed roast pork buns are my favorite. The congee was also surprisingly good-- I thought it would be bland but it had enough flavor that I kept going back for more. The steamed shrimp & chive dumplings were another favorite of mine.\\n\\nOverall I would highly recommend Winsor, especially if you get intimidated by the ordering system at HLM without a fluent Chinese speaker. The food is comparable but the ease of ordering really sold me. Winsor also has quite a few round tables that can seat larger groups. Just be aware that there might be a wait if all the tables are full, but to be honest this can be the case at HLM as well depending on what day/time you go."},{"name":"La Casita","address":"101 W Cordova Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Ok first let me preface this by saying that , I don't know if Canadians taste in Mexican food is different than mine , but I found this place to be just average ! A bit overpriced !

Oh excuse yes the escabeche , the salad garnish that accompanied the meal was great and pretty authentic , I did eat that all up ! While I left half of everything else on plate ! The sangria was good too , with a little dash of cinnamon , I have not had sangria that way in years which took me back , I don't even make it that way anymore which is an acquired taste , good but unexpected ! The other food that came out was decent and their presentation was nice but nothing really  stood out other than the aforementioned items !

Play area for kids. Geared toward families\\nCons: Had to ask for prices. Sub-par customer service\\nBottom Line: I had a really negative experience in terms of customer service so I won't be going back. They have a basic selection of froyo and lots of toppings so if you have small children you'll probably have a better experience here. Not a trendy or young person oriented froyo place.\\n\\nMe and my gf were having a late night craving for some cr√™pes when we decided to stop by Yogurt Breeze. It had a fun-playtime atmosphere with several small children playing in the designated children's area. This is definitely a froyo place aimed toward families and small children. You'll find way more toppings than you'll know what to do with here! They have some common froyo selections with nothing out of the ordinary (Vanilla, Nutella, Mango Sorbet, tart, etc.) Unfortunately the negative thing for me was my experience with the customer service.\\n\\nThe first strange thing we noticed was that the prices for the Froyo/oz and the cr√™pes weren't listed anywhere. We asked the employee, an older gentleman, what they were and we learned that it was 59 cents/oz. and $6.99 for a cr√™pe (although he wasn't entirely sure before he checked). Pretty strange considering every froyo place I've ever been to have had prices clear as day, but it's alright. What I really didn't like is that the employee stood right behind me as I was sampling the different froyos. I'm not sure if he thought I was sampling too many (5-6) but I always like to sample the consistency and quality of product at a new Froyo place especially if it's been a while since I had froyo. I definitely got the feeling he was judging me, and my gf felt uncomfortable enough by his presence that she wondered whether she should use the bathroom since it said it was for customers only and I hadn't yet bought anything.\\n\\nI ended up getting one of their specials which was a $2.99 waffle cone that you could fill with froyo and toppings. At first you might think it's a good deal, but honestly it's tough to fill much froyo and toppings without spilling in that cone, and I didn't feel like making a mess of the topping bar. At checkout I tried to use the Yelp Check in Offer for 15% but was told I couldn't use it because the cone was already a special offer. I was a little turned off by this because the check in offer make no indication that I couldn't use the offer for specific items. Even worse when I suggested that they add that limitation to the check-in offer he just brushed me off and just repeated that I couldn't use the check in offer. Felt so uncomfortable that I decided to leave with my cone rather than sit in.\\n\\nAll in all I did not enjoy being shadowed as I sampled froyo, unclear check-in offers, and dismissive employees.

With the entire chasm of casual food that exists worldwide, the last thing Disney needs is another chicken place. I know they have to appeal to the mass market, but this is just lazy. However, I'm all for the \\"don't knock it\\" mentality, and obviously GF is successful for a reason (despite my already bad taste from Planet Hollywood next door) so we decided to have lunch there during a recent shopping trip. \\n     I'd heard good things about the sauces, so I went with the \\"classic\\" chicken sandwich with the house sauce. We each got combos, and I mistakingly thought they would have some sort of thoughtful, modern iced tea choices, you know, like your basic Panera Bread has across the country? Nope. Coke products, and sweet tea. I asked about non-sweet tea, and the staff member was kind enough to go upstairs to PH and grab a pitcher for us both. So the food shows up, and looks good, but not great. I guess I missed the memo that this is a chicken-tender-only restaurant. Again, this is lazy toddler food. The sandwich was made up of 3 chicken tenders, with all the toppings. And here's the deal: it would take them $0 of effort to make the sandwiches with chicken breasts, thus making a structurally sound sandwich. But they didn't. Furthermore, the chicken is frankly, not that good. It looks like the Tyson tenders you can buy in bulk at Costco.  The sauces MAY be made from scratch, but it is clear that nothing else is. And I'm sorry, but in today's quick casual game, you have to have quality, especially on Disney property. \\n     The best quick casual chicken place I've been to is called PDQ, and if you haven't been, it is the benchmark for quality in the quick casual space. There is one about 20 minutes away from DS. Do yourself a favor, and enjoy less crowds, lower priced, locally sourced, higher quality food. I really hope this mistake of a restaurant (and quite frankly the entire Planet Hollywood space) goes away soon, and replaced with something that actually took time and effort to produce."},{"name":"Border Cafe","address":"356 Broadway","city":"Saugus","stars":"3.5","text":"Wasn't really sure about coming in here because it's always packed but we tried anyway.

After a few visits here I have the chance to give a better evaluation.\\n\\nThe food is a real highlight. Their New Haven style brick oven pizza is really on par with some of the best in Portland. There's practically some guy named Bruno working that oven like no tomorrow and he's not messing around! Quality toppings with some really swell vegetarian offerings, big plus for plus size vegetarians like myself! I highly recommend \\"The Bruno\\" which puts mozzarella and crumbled goat cheese, kalamatas, peppadew peppers, and basil on a pie and let me tell ya......that ain't bad!  The \\"Truffle Shuffle\\" is also a good one, a white sauce pie with goat cheese and portobellas. They do some greaet salads as well.......the Greek one is a pretty hearty choice and compliments the pizza well.  2 people ordering a salad and splitting a pizza are plenty full here.   Sandwiches and subs round out the menu here, and they have a nice little kid menu in this very family friendly pub.\\n\\nThe beer for me is just so so.......but that's just my opinion so don't let it sway yours.  The Kolsch was rather flat and the IPA just doesn't pop for me.  That aside, they have great draft ginger brew and root beer and I'm always satisfied with some good iced tea.\\n\\nWhere it loses a star for me is service which can be spotty. I've had some great servers here who are super helpful and make great suggestions.........and the apathetic ones who go through the motions and then get everybody's ticket wrong at the table. While it won't keep me away, I would like to see some better training and have a better staff experience.

Nearly infinite parking, short wait times, a huge menu, and aforementioned 24 hour operation are the main attractions. Come here between 2AM and 5AM and you can almost guarantee someone has either vomited in the bathroom, dining room, or in the parking lot. \\n\\nAs a people watching opportunity then, No. 9 is one of the best yet doesn't carry the baggage of being in a high crime area where you might get stabbed or shot. Despite their hours and the rowdy crowd they attract, I can count the number of serious violent incidents here in the past two decades on one hand. \\n\\nAny one who is reviewing the food here and comparing it next to legitimate restaurants that don't offer the same attractions is doing Yelp a disservice. The food is only part of the equation and as mediocre as it might be, it's still probably better than your typical Chinese restaurant/buffet in any North American boondock town.\\n\\nHere's my bbq rice (pictured) for example, at $14 the portion for a \\"large\\" is significantly smaller than established BBQ places like HK BBQ Master, Tak Fook, Parker Place Meat, or Chinatown BBQ.

The quality of the meat itself is not too bad though and it's hard to get mad at the prices when I know I've personally made a mess here on numerous occasions in the past. \\n\\nHere's a TL;DR about my feelings for No. 9.

I get it, it's packed. But, someone must have had the tickets order jumbled because we got served after tables that sat well over 20 minutes after us, and for sure did not order before us. Still not a big deal, it happens. Remember the place is packed.\\n\\n45 plus minutes later our meal finally shows up... yikes... wrong dish for the both of us. At this point my wife is so famished she does not care and eats 0.o Me on the other hand get a little frustrated and, after trying something I really did not want, returned it.\\n\\nLet me also stress that even with the order mixup our server was very understanding and sweet. Maybe a little overwhelmed but genuinely wanted to \\"make it right\\" for my wife and I. She offered to replaced our plates, even insisted when I politely declined. \\n\\nThe kitchen kindly expedited my reorder and properly got it to me. At this point I'm not sure if it is me or just the way the food is here. My bistec beef was very tough and the onion not so caramelized. The yellow rice was too salty, pass the well seasoned point. \\n\\nI was not going to say anything else and just take my lost at this point. However, our awesome server would have none of it. She offered to make something else and again I politely declined.\\n\\nWell... A couple minutes later our server brought not one but two flan. One to eat now and one to bring home o.0 what a superstar. Guess what? The second flan did not make it home. Yes, it was that delicious... or maybe I was just hungry lol\\n\\nThroughout this meal experience the owner also got involved. Contrary to our server I would say our interactions could have easily escalated quickly. I see this often, when an owner gets strong emotionnal attachment to their process and products. An example of our interaction would be when asked if I liked my refired dish and mentioned the yellow rice being too salty i was told that maybe my taste buds were off today o.0 \\n\\nI could easily give a few more examples, including being charged, mind you with a 10% discount, for the meal I did not eat. In the end the owner realized I was not here to get a free meal and made it right. But it's beside the point. The bottom line for me was, the food was not at all what was expected.

It's not one-starred because the bartender did, indeed, handle the basically-abysmal experience there correctly, by comping the one alcoholic and one non-alcoholic beverage we were served, but they just dropped the ball pretty badly tonight, overall (bartender excepted, I suppose).\\n\\nWhen we arrived, the place was basically full, but we were able to be seated at the one two-top that they had, even though it clearly wasn't bussed yet (the table still had standing liquids on its top).  Not a big deal, since they were obviously quite busy, but it did seem odd that the table was completely clear of anything at all, yet wasn't wiped down.  They eventually did clean it, and mostly dried it, but it wasn't the most auspicious start.  They did tell us that \\"the kitchen was running 20-30 minutes behind\\".  They could also have told us that \\"The Pope is a little bit Catholic\\" and it would have been just as accurate a statement.\\n\\nLook:  I understand when you're short-handed, and if you're *that* short-handed, whether it's in the front of house, back of house, or both, you just plain need to either stop seating and serving people, or you need to be dead, honestly clear with those you seat about what waiting times are going to be.  After waiting 45 minutes while you're hungry, there's only so much conversation and phone scrolling you can do before you're all-too-keenly aware that:\\n\\n1.  Your food is not here, it's not *going* to be here any time soon, and\\n\\n2.  Your server(s) have *completely* disappeared from the floor in a way that would make Houdini think he's a novice.\\n\\nIt's sort of interesting that, when I inquired of the *bartender* what the holdup was, he kind of acceptedly sighed and tried to explain what we'd already surmised, quite plainly.  I was quite certain that our food was sitting in the window waiting to be brought out, and that our server(s) were just falling down on the watch.\\n\\nNo, sir.  Our food wasn't anywhere *near* being done, as the bartender came back out and apologetically told us that it was going to be \\"another 5-10 minutes\\" for us to get our food.  I've been around the food industry long enough to know that that means our orders were never put into the kitchen, and I'm not rewarding that kind of incompetence with my money...it's just not in my wheelhouse to do so.  We'd been there for about an hour at that point, and while there were customers, yes, it WAS NOT *THAT* BUSY.  And even if it was:  why wasn't our server around to inquire of?  Why weren't we offered or brought anything (anything at all!) to nosh on while we waited?  Why were they absolutely, completely *GONE*?!?!??\\n\\nThe answer is, \\"I don't care anymore.\\"  And that's what you've got from me, now.  Don't know, don't care.  The second star is simply because the bartender knows how to properly handle a bad situation of their own making.  Otherwise?  This place, to me, is an utter loss.\\n\\nAvoid.  There are many other, better places to spend your time, much less your appetite, and *certainly* much less your money.  At least The Dwarf House in Hapeville could provide goods and services for money.  Such a novel concept.\\n\\nThis, here?

The waitress arrived to take my drink order (I got a big Diet Coke). I was given a complementary basket of chips and salsa. The chips were hot and very crispy, but there was too much salt (cut out the salt please and the chips would be great). The tomato salsa was good, but I ran out of salsa halfway through the chips.\\n\\nFor a starter, I went with a Bowl of Gumbo with chunks of sausage & chicken which was decent and had a spicy and salty taste. For dinner, I ordered the Catfish Fajitas with fixins (lettuce, cheese, sour cream, tomatoes) with side of jambalaya and guacamole (extra). The cajun seasoned catfish with sliced onions was served on a sizzling platter, was pretty decent. The catfish filets were firm outside, but dry inside.

I'm a brisket slut and Memphis has the most tender smoked brisket in Vancouver.  The only fair criticism is that their BBQ sauce is too sweet and molasses-y for my liking.  Sure, it's solid BBQ, especially for the price.  ~$40 will get you the Memphis Feast which will give you all the meat (ribs, brisket, pulled pork, BBQ chicken, rib ends, smoked sausage) and all the sides (corn bread, coleslaw, potato salad, fries & beans) as a sampler -- enough for 4 'normal' people.\\n\\nPerfect if you're indecisive or you follow my maxim: 'The deliciousness of a meal is positively correlated with the number of animals that had to die for it'.  Stay tuned for more of Johnson's laws of gluttony.  I'm like Newton... if the apple fell from the mouth of a roasted pig.\\n\\nSo why sad?  In a city like Vancouver, that's renown for selection and quality of food, Memphis Blues is pretty much the zenith in Vancouver BBQ.  Maybe I watch too much Food Network and tales and images of southern BBQ prepared by idiot savant hermits that have mastered the BBQ dark arts shouldn't get me sexually excited -- but really, Vancouver: a BBQ chain started by a couple of entrepreneurs is the peak?\\n\\nIn addition, Memphis Blues came into being during my crew's teenage years.  The original Broadway location was the site of many of teenage food challenges where bravado and hunger overruled common sense.  Have you ever had the urge to watch someone eat 1/2 a Elvis Platter (like the Memphis Feast but with more meat) and downing an additional 1/2 lb of pulled pork, watching them vomit and then incessantly laugh and jeer at them?  If you answered 'No'; congratulations, it proves you have a modicum of sanity.  Especially with BBQ pork, we were what we ate.  If YouTube was around when my friends and I were in high school and undergrads, we would have been the original \\"Epic Meal Time\\" crew [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIzzx2OolfI] mixed in with \\"Jackass\\".\\n\\nHowever, I am literally \\"getting too old for this shit\\".

Very weird that they put a sheet of parchment? paper and added oil and placed it on the grill before we put meat down.

I am unsure if she felt that she was able to do that because we are kids (16 years old) or because she does that to everyone.

I ended up getting the Pasta Al Forno (with Fusilli per the recommendation of the waiter).  I can't say enough good things...once you go homemade pasta there is no going back.  It is so tender and delicious and the sauce was incredible.

We started with the bluefish fried cakes and the short rib potato gnocchi that was melt in your mouth delicious. We moved on to the curried goat stew and flat iron steak. The stew had just enough heat to start my husband's bald head to gleam in perspiration. Their stew is not to be confused with an Indian curry, but a true delicately cooked goat dish with deep and subtle flavors. The steak was the perfect cut of meat, with a nice tenderness that you rarely find outside of a steakhouse. We wrapped up the meal with the warm  banana bread pudding and ice cream. The banana bread pudding was the perfect texture, served piping hot that made me nostalgic of Sunday family dinners in the south.

It's not too sweet, contrary to what you're probably imagining right now. \\n\\nThe burnt ends is my favorite meat here. It's so smoky and tender and juicy, you don't even need the sauce on there for it to be delicious. The smoked jalapenos are always amazing. They're smoked with a piece of cheese in them and wrapped in bacon. My only complaint is that I only get two as a side. French fries were crinkle cut, standard. The fried okra is always hit or miss, honestly. This time, it was a hit. I loved them. Super crunchy with the okra still ok and delicious inside the breading. \\n\\nMy girlfriend's pulled pork was also delicious. I like pulled pork that's not like, too fatty. Just meat. So good.

It's not that they were bad, I've just had better in other places. Still, I'm not an expert so feel free to give them a shot! The rice and beans were excellent, too. The rice has a nice salty flavor and the black beans come mashed into a paste, similar to refried beans.

I am a bit of a gnocchi snob, as I'm only entirely satisfied with the gnocchi that my grandmother makes and the ones I can get at Cantina in the North End, but these joined the elite ranks.  They were light and delicious.  I don't know why I don't get to Rino's more often, but I will make a point of it now because last night's trip reminded me how good it really is.  Their food rivals the best food in the North End, and it's right in Eastie.

Many of the dishes contained elements that blew the entire course.   Examples - the Bone Marrow was so sweet it tasted like Ragu spaghetti sauce gone bad.  Thankfully there were a couple of slivers of untouched marrow underneath that cloyingly sweet mess.    The charcuterie plate was uninspiring; the Foie Gras bon bon was served on a crust that was so hard it was almost inedible.  The Gelee was huge, and rubbery; not silky.   The duck confit was overdone and tough.  The dessert was inedible.\\n\\nThe bottle of wine we chose (Cassis) started off OK, but tasted like salt water 15 mins later.  I should have sent it back, but had already consumed a glass by then and felt bad doing so.\\n\\nBut what made it a truly unbearable was a pathologically obnoxious woman at our community table who insisted on being the lead conversationalist for the meal; who became increasingly invasive and personal the more wine she consumed.   She was downright repulsive.   We tried not speaking with her, but she was so drunk / stupid / ignorant that our aloofness only made it worse.   We generally don't mind community tables here in California, but at a high-end price-fixe restaurant with wine pairings, it's a poor idea.\\n\\nAfter attempting to stomach a couple bites of the disgusting dessert, we just desultorily left.   \\n\\nBeast seems like a wedding caterer who set up shop in a small dining room, going for a theme that just didn't resonate.

I recommend grabbing one to hold while you are in line, I found the menu boards a little difficult to read at a distance. \\n\\nThe most popular item here are their bowls. We all found that it was enough food for us to share, but we eat a lot at Disney and always have another meal coming up. First you choose your protein; beef, chicken, tofu, fish, or a combination. Then you can choose your base and your sauce. Simple and done! After you order you wait at the next counter and grab your food. It is a pretty quick process once you have ordered. \\n\\nI have also tried their cheeseburger pods- nothing out of this world, but definitely something I find myself craving when I want a quick snack.

I don't know if its because i don't speak Chinese and majority of their workers do not speak English & they prefer to deal with Chinese ppl, but it was very insulting and rude.  I turned to the waitress and told her that my family was here first and she ignores me!  I wanted to leave, but my Mom was craving seafood/crab and plus they were hungry so i just dealt with it.  When we got there it was noon and apparently they were serving Dim Sum, which is crazy cuz they only have ONE lady pushing a cart with barely anything in it.  Everytime we asked for something in the cart they wouldn't have it.  To make matter worst I tried to order from their menu and they tried to tell me that I could not order from it and can only get dim sum.  I guess i went kinda beserk after that because the table on my left and right obviously ordered from the menu since i saw steam tilapia and a bunch of stir-fried dishes on their table.  I informed my waitress if I could not order from the menu then we would leave because it was obvious other ppl can order from the menu and not us.  \\n\\nThe manager comes out and she tells me i can order from the menu so i asked her for some crab and she tells me that they do not have any crabs.  Seriously, how can they call themselves a seafood restaurant if they do not have crab??!!  She tried to tell me they ran out but i can see the crab in her fish tank.  This double standard of service was really starting to piss me off.  My mom knew i was getting upset and tried to calm me down and insisted she didn't want any crab, but the whole purpose of going there was to eat crab. By the time we left that restaurant I knew for a fact i would never come back.\\n\\nThe service is terrible, down from them not seating us, not getting our fork or bowls we asked for, the soy sauce that never came, the dim sum that ran out (it was gross), the lack of english speaking employees and their obvious double standard for customers that speaks or is Chinese vs. those that are not.  This place obviously caters to Chinese ppl.  \\n\\nThe food isn't good anyways, the oil they used to fry their food needed to be replaced and they use A LOT of MSG!  I can tell because i get migraines from eating it and i left there feeling sick and when i got home i threw up.

Why do you leave paying customers to wait at the door when you could be making money? The 2 guys waiting in front of us had the same issue, they said they were waiting at the door for 10 mins before anyone swung by.\\n\\nWe finally were seated at a table towards the back....and the empty table mentioned above, yeah, still empty! Our server brought us water, told us the specials then walked away. This is usually when they ask what you would like to drink?! We waited another 10mins to put in an order of Bloody Marys. I was already irritated with the service, er lack of service shall I say. The Marys were not the best we had, they tasted watered down and no spice to them. Just meh! \\n\\nThe food coming out looked awesome, so I had hopes there. I ordered the Croque Madam and my sweetie ordered the Crab Benedict. Tick tock, tick tock...the wait continued. OK, this place is small, so I couldn't figure out why the kitchen was backed up and slow to get out the orders? The food finally comes and we are so hungry! My sandwich was good, not a Wow factor, but good. My sweeties Benedict was meh. After a couple bites when the sauce cooled off, he said it tasted very buttery, not good at all. \\n\\nWe were sad this brunch experience turned out disappointing! Most other reviews are 4-5 stars, so what was the deal this day? Did we catch them having an \\"off day\\"? With so many other great places Portland has to offer, I won't be back for brunch to find out."},{"name":"Logan's Roadhouse","address":"2364 Taylor Park Dr","city":"Reynoldsburg","stars":"3","text":"A-OK. \\n\\nI've been to other Logan's, and this one is not the newest or freshest, but it's decent. \\n\\nI like their sirloins better than their strips or ribeyes.

Upon his return to the table, he said that the kitchen staff said that they didn't even use such a thing in their kitchen.  I replied that I didn't know where it came from, but it was most certainly in my salad.  He left without even apologizing.  \\n\\nNext, our table was visited by some \\"front of the house\\" guy in a suit.

The beef taco was filled with fresh ground beef and his favorite item served on the platter. My son decided on a tostada, beef taco and a chili relleno. He liked all three equally.

The blackened chicken burrito (which comes with chips), with no queso or salsa, but with the veggies I prefer in it and some shredded cheese and sour cream in a wheat tortilla, totals near as makes no difference 1000 calories!

The easiest way to get there is via the beltline, but if you're driving I would recommend looking on Edgewood - there is plenty of street parking across from the storage place. There is also rumored to be parking in the Studioplex parking deck but as they wrap construction you might be better off with street parking. I visited the GyM on a Friday at 5pm right when they opened. I was greeted immediately by the 3 employees who were setting up the bar, tables and umbrellas on the patio. The space itself isn't very big but the walls splashed with vibrant art from local artists @squishiepuss and @letsgopaint welcome you with open arms!\\n\\nAt the register I ordered the Keepin' it 120 (skinny) marg because ya girl likes to chew her calories rather than drink them. So at 120 calories and a short list of fresh (basically good for you) ingredients, I was feeling good about my decision. The GyM doesn't mess around with sugary mixers, they use the good stuff. My skinny marg had tequila, lime, agave and a cilantro garnish. \\n\\nAfter I ordered my marg, they gave me a card holder with a playing card size picture of Will Smith. Will and I found a table outside to commence people watching and waited for my friends to join. Just a couple minutes later they delivered my marg and it was nothing short of delicious. The ice cubes are legit cubes, keeping the drink cold and not watery until your last sip. The tequila:lime ratio was awesome and I enjoyed this guilt free marg so much I ordered a few more that evening....\\n\\nDuring our workout sesh at the GyM (what, we were doing bicep curls while drinking our margs weren't we?!?) we also took a dip in the queso. It was tasty. Like, really tasty. The chips were not my fave, but they were a pretty good vessel to get that queso into my mouth.

I had wanted to check this place out for the longest time. Now that I've seen what it has to offer, I can say that I won't be back.\\n\\nThe dining space at Beast is pretty small. You must book reservations online beforehand since there are only a few specific times when brunch is served. Be prepared for a communal dining experience as there are only a couple of long tables at which everyone is seated. The kitchen is open and located directly behind one of the tables so you can see, smell, and hear everything that is going on during the preparation of the courses.\\n\\nThe first course was a cherry clafoutis with a chunk of glazed bacon on top. I thought it was a bit strange to start with something so sweet, but I was starving so I inhaled it anyways. The clafoutis was extremely dense and tasted strongly of eggs. It tasted somewhat like a bread pudding and unfortunately, I loathe bread pudding. The taste also reminded me of a pancake made with too many eggs. For me, the clafoutis was much too heavy. I did enjoy the one piece of glazed bacon on top, however.\\n\\nNext, we were served a rather pretentious-looking plate of trout, ricotta, and rye crisps. Normally, I do not think of these artsy types of dishes as pretentious since I appreciate the thought and effort that goes into making them. Perhaps it was due to the fact that this dish was so skimpy that I couldn't help but scoff a bit. The trout was good and had a nice smoky flavor. I finished my entire plate in probably 10 seconds and I was not even scarfing it down. Since I ate my course so quickly, it was hard for me to form an opinion on how it tasted. At this point in the meal, I was a little nervous since I was still starving and there was only one main course left.\\n\\nThe last main course was a hash that consisted of oyster mushrooms, pork shoulder, squash, and purple cauliflower. This was served with a poached duck egg and a piece of bread. This course was definitely the most filling, but once again, it was so small that I was barely satisfied. In my opinion, this course was the best but it was nothing special. The addition of the juicy oyster mushrooms was nice, but other than that, this dish tasted pretty similar to a regular eggs Benedict.\\n\\nFor dessert, we were served petit fours which were as small as my hope of being satisfied at this point. This \\"course\\" consisted of a chocolate macaron that was the size of a quarter, a generic candied cube, and a dark chocolate disc. Everything about this course was extremely mediocre. I'll say that the presentation was cute since everything was so dainty, but it did nothing to leave me wanting to return to this place.\\n\\nGratuity is included in the bill and for brunch, that brings the total to $35 per person. The quality and quantity of the food is definitely not worth the price. I would recommend saving your money and going elsewhere for a better tasting brunch at a better price. I am willing to pay more for exceptional food and service and unfortunately, I experienced neither of those at Beast."},{"name":"Burger 21 - Mall of Millenia","address":"4192 Conroy Rd, Ste 109","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Looking for something different and we found it here.

For a place that just won Restaurant of the Year, I expected much much better. I ordered steak and eggs. My hanger steak was cut into 4 unevenly sized cubes and cooked well beyond \\"rare\\". There was no pink inside. The eggs came scrambled somewhat rubbery and topped with orange cheese. I wasn't asked, but I assumed that the eggs would be fried over easy. Everything else at Tasty n Sons seems to come topped with a fried egg. My husband had the fried chicken and biscuit which was also disappointing. The chicken was dry and the whole dish needed something like a sauce or gravy to tie it together. We shared an order of potato bravas, which were just fried chunks of potato tossed with a tomato sauce and then served with a giant glob of garlic mayonnaise. Greasy and gross. The ambience in the place is lacking. There are about 20 tiny tables lined up in a row against the wall and the place is very noisy. When the waitress would help the people next to us, she would squeeze between our two tables and basically stick her ass right in my face. They claim to serve food \\"family style\\" but most of the dishes are difficult to really share. I mean, how do you share one biscuit sandwich?

If you are thinking of getting the fries, it is definitely a 2 person portion if you are also getting and entree. \\n\\nThe vibe of the place, always bumping good hip hop music, and the overall camaraderie amongst the staff create a welcoming and enjoyable place to eat your meal at all times of day."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"2230 Guadalupe St, Ste 32","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Been here several times.

I loved the okra and Cajun rice and ended up devouring most of that while my friends took care of the chicken.

Quite a different style of friend chicken from what I was use to.\\n\\nEven though the place was quite crowded with people constant coming in and out picking up and ordering stuff, everything moved surprising fast. It looked pretty chaotic but the folks working here seemed to really know what they are doing and manage to be fast, efficient and still be pleasant about it.  The bathrooms were a mess but I suspect that the staff concentrate on moving chicken to the take out customers more than the bathrooms.\\n\\nThis is a nice change from KFC when you start lusting for some friend chicken.

Most just order cocktails while they wait for a table to open up, but small parties will find it quicker and easier to sit and eat at the bar. Which is just what we did-- zero wait time.\\n\\nService was just south of being too hipster for my taste. However, I cannot complain because orders were taken, drinks were delivered, and food was presented in a prompt fashion. \\n\\nI ordered Highland Kitchen's signature bloody mary (with gin instead of vodka) and was over-the-moon in love with it. I'm infatuated with the homemade mix, complete with spicy grated horseradish that floated gently to the bottom. I could order these all day erry day. That would probably cause a problem. While their cocktail and food menu is interesting and varied enough to make your eyes pop out of your skull, the shrimp and grits dish jumped off the page and made my stomach growl with anticipation.\\n\\nLet me tell you-- not only must you get one of their signature bloody marys, but you must try the shrimp and grits at least once. Creamy, rich grits, without being too heavy; deliciously seasoned shrimp, decadent mushrooms, smoky bacon singing through. If heaven existed, Highland Kitchen has it prepared on a plate.

I think Ittyo is the best, mind you, out of this little strip; the only thing bad about it is 1) the occcasional wait, 10-15 minutest, 2) that it's near the bathrooms.  Honorable mention: the ever-present popular Cafe Mami  (where numerous college friends worked... for nothing, ha), and Kotoboya the sushi place (don' t know if I spelled that correctly).. which doubles as a grocery store.

I love getting the awesome bento box combo dinners which come a choice of: Sukiyaki Beef, Hamburg with Fried Egg, Grilled Salmon, Pork Cutlet, Chicken Cutlet. The hamburg I heard great things about, and the salmon is nice and hearty. I usually get the mackerel, don't know why it's not on their current menu- maybe we don't have it anymore!! :(  Too bad because that mackerel was grilled so perfectly, with a zesty lemon sauce atop and sans fishy taste (a common complaint with mackerel).  Not to say that the sides aren't totally amazing: fried spring rolls, shrimp rolls, seaweed salad, regular Japanese house salad, potato cakes.. white rice dotted with black sesame, and pickled radish.  AND miso soup.  Everything is really fresh and delicious- hard to imagine such good value and food are produced from their minuscule kitchen!

Located around the corner from the main street running through Downtown Sanford, Celery City is a little bar that doesn't look like much from the outside. However, once you go in, you definitely see that it is a unique little piece of Sanford.\\n\\nWe encountered two things when we first went inside: 1) a huge wall of taps that shows off the various types of beer they have, and 2) a weird soup smell. Both of those unique features of Celery City actually serve a purpose. The taps on the wall allow them to show off their beers and keep their taps marked with numbers so that it is easier for the bartender to quickly pour beers. The soup smell was some type of beer soup that the bartender was making at the end of the night. She actually let one of the people in our group take some home, which was really nice.\\n\\nI went up to the counter and decided to order an Old Chub, which is a tasty scotch beer, while. everyone else with me decided to try one of their 50+ draft beers. After getting our beers, we decided to hang out for a few minutes inside to watch part of the Heat game and play a little shuffleboard. Once we got bored with that, we went out back to their patio area to sit at some picnic tables and chat. Celery City has an entrance back in their patio area, so you may be able to park in the back and come in that way if you want.\\n\\nOverall, Celery City is a fun little bar that has a wide selection of beers and a nice back patio area that combines to provide a quality bar experience."},{"name":"Los Comales Mexican Restaurant","address":"2136 E 7th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"A friend brought me here for lunch and I must say the tacos and the chips and salsa are great.

It was very busy on a Friday night, and parking was hard to come by.  It is a great location in Old Dublin and is nicely decorated with a large balcony, which is where we sat.  Unfortunately, the food leaves a lot to be desired.  We started with the ricotta balls for an appetizer, which were incredibly bland.  We then each got salads--house, Caesar, and wedge of iceberg--all agreed salads were incredibly bland and, like the appetizer, were doused with salt in an attempt to give flavor.  I ordered the mushroom ravioli, which then thwarted my expectations and was incredibly salty with a pungent gorgonzola cream sauce.  I did not mind it after having such bland starters, but only ate a small portion because it was so pungent.  My girlfriends ordered the lasagne, vegetable lasagne, and cannoli, and all agreed it was just blah.  Very little flavor.  We ordered the chocolate mousse tart and cheesecake for dessert.  They returned with creme brulee because they had run out of the tart and the cheesecake.  Again, both were just OK--and we are not particular when it comes to dessert!  We left over half on the plate between the 4 of us.  It was very dissapointing considering we spent 60 dollars a piece on our meals.

Not anaphylactic-shock allergic, but makes-my-mouth-itch allergic, so I just assume stay away from them.  After all, you never know when a food allergy may randomly get worse.  So I purposely ordered a roll that specifically, according to the menu, did not include avocado.\\n\\nThe food was very slow getting out of the kitchen.  Molasses in January grows more quickly than the food grew out of Dokdoya's kitchen.  We all somewhat knew it would be slow because this place is fairly new, but our food wasn't even all ready at the same time.  Other people in my group were patting their stomachs and sighing from fullness before my roll finally arrived.  And guess what?  Three of the ten pieces of my roll had a slice of avocado in them.  Yep.  I merely pushed the avocado out of the roll, despite my tablemates trying to convince me to send it back.  I did not want to wait an extra 30 minutes for a new roll to be ready, and I just didn't think it would turn out right anyway, so I did what I could to get around the avocado.  Had I had a severe allergy to avocados, I may not be alive right now to write this because, despite my efforts, I could not rid my roll of every speck of avocado.\\n\\nWhat normally happens at other sushi places is that I will order a roll that normally comes with avocado and will ask them to nix the vegetable, explaining with WIDE EYES that I am allergic to it (thus hoping to create a sense of urgency in keeping the avocado away from my roll).  Most sushi places have mastered my request just fine, but one place (whose name I cannot remember) failed to take out the avocado and I had to send back the roll.  But never before tonight, in all of the sushi places at which I have eaten, have I ordered a roll that the menu said did NOT have avocado, only to have it magically appear in my roll anyway.  So I have to lower my rating of Dokdoya because of this.\\n\\nOther than the avocado issue, the roll was just okay.  I have had better shrimp tempura rolls.  I expected the tempura to be hot, or at least warm, but it was as cold as the rest of the roll.  I doubt I will ever make a return trip to Dokdoya.  \\n\\nSorry, Dokdoya, but I do not appreciate menus that lie to me, especially when my life might be at stake.\\n\\nThe one positive thing I can write is that they have half-price sushi rolls in the evenings.  My mediocre allergic experience only cost me $7.58, and that included miso soup and a small tasty salad.\\n\\nOff issue, I think Mediocre Allergic Experience would have made a great '60s rock 'n' roll band name."},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Awesome little beer garden.

The dining room was beautiful, with nice touches adorning a relatively dressed-down aesthetic, the menu was actually a bit big bigger than I had thought it would be, the service was friendly, fun, and familiar while still being professional and our cocktails were AWESOME, and ended up being a real standout that night.\\n\\nServing traditional, single-plate dinner portions, there's also a large, varied selection of tapas-style small plates, which is what we decided to go with.  We ordered several dishes, including crispy duck, seared scallops in a cauliflower puree, papardelle pasta with prosciutto and mushrooms in a cream sauce, ricotta-stuffed ravioli in a lemon sauce, and shrimp cooked in rock salt.\\n\\nOur favorite dish of the night was the seared scallops, which were perfect.  They were seasoned and cooked beautifully, and the cauliflower puree really made that dish.  The duck and the papardelle were our second favorites, they were both seasoned well but still balanced.  The ravioli and the shrimp, however, were not.  The shrimp ended up being VERY salty, but that was probably because (to really drove home the point) they were served on rock salt, making it very difficult to eat them without all the excess salt.  The ravioli needed some of that salt, and was too lemony, too acidic, for the ricotta to balance out.\\n\\nThe drinks were also REALLY good, meaning they are balanced and delicious but NOT overly sugary or sweet.  I've recently begun to appreciate great cocktails, and how much skill and thought goes into making them.  We tried a few different ones that night, but by far my favorite was called A Step In the Right Direction, which had cucumber and mint.  It was the best thing I had that night--delicious, refreshing, and perfectly sweetened.

He ordered ribs which were served on a cute pig shaped cutting board with a wet nap. These were the best ribs either of us had tasted. They were not baby back sized, but they were incredibly tender and juicy and did not require extra sauce. We got the 1.5 lb, but next time will likely splurge for the 3 pounder. It seems like a lot, but it will disappear before you blink (I'm lucky he saved me one). \\n\\nI asked the server/cashier to choose between their signature sandwich (the name is escaping me) and the banh mi and chose the banh mi. The meat was great and the bread was nice and soft, but I was not to crazy about the pickled veggies on top. They were certainly colorful, but lacked that vinegary punch and crunch :-\\\\. Honestly it was a 3.5 star sandwich, but those fried plantains were delicious and that meat was great, I just think it  didn't go together  ...  also had to add lots of sriracha because the meat needed some tie into the rest of the sandwich. \\n\\nAnd the sides. Fried plantains were just that and fries were great. Fries were crunchy and salty, just the way I like them.  However, that corn... maybe it was because we came later on a Monday night (around 8), but it was dry and just not really flavorful. Could have been just a bad ear.... They put the cheese and green onion on which honestly was sparse and all fell off before it got to our mouths. \\n\\nWe will be back with no doubt. Those ribs alone are just so worth it.

The owners, hosts, servers, bartenders, and chefs are second to none. Each person is knowledgeable and friendly, and they all work together to create a special experience for the guests. \\n\\nFinally, let's talk about food and drinks. Epicure's menu is small while still offering a range of options for meat eaters, people with gluten allergies, vegetarians, and so on. You can also ask for a dish to be customized to your liking. I've had a hard time ordering anything other than their iconic mac & cheese since I'm such a carb fiend, but they also have a great shrimp and pasta dish as well as delicious salmon. Make sure you go hungry, because their appetizers are also not to be missed. A favorite among me and my companions would be the bacon wrapped dates, meatballs, and a customized charcuterie tray.  \\n\\nTell your server what you're planning on ordering, and they will be happy to recommend the perfect glass of wine or cocktail to pair with it.

There's a couple of other places to eat/drink in the Westin, but this one provides the most comprehensive restaurant/bar-type atmosphere.\\n\\nIt's a very dimly lit restaurant and I believe it shares its kitchen with the bar on the other side, facing the lobby, City Bar.  The hotel entrance is a bit far, as you have to walk past the lobby and go to the other end of the building, where a comedy show theater is.  There's a host section when you walk in, an L-shaped bar on the left when you walk past it, followed by a decent-sized dining area on the right.\\n\\nI've eaten here multiple times because I typically stay at the Westin when I travel to Boston for work, and there's not many restaurants in this area of South Boston (even though the convention center is right next door).  Every time I come, I sit at the bar.  They have three TVs at the bar that are playing sports and the bartenders will change it to whatever game you're interested in watching.  Their taps are pretty standard - a few Sam, Harpoon, Goose Island, a few specialties, and your normal beers (Bud, Coors, etc.).  The food is very mediocre, at best.  Their tater tots are great, but then again, it's rare to mess those up.  Their grilled cheese and soup combo is pretty good from what I remember.  I had their veggie burger this evening and I will never get that again.  It is the dryest, tasteless, thing I've ever eaten.  It's homemade and they really need to change their recipe.\\n\\nMy biggest gripe with this place is that the service is extremely slow and nobody looks happy.  They don't greet you with a smile or ask how you're doing - the patron always has to flag down the bartender and tell them what they want, instead of them coming to approach you.  They also never offer or give you water unless you ask, and they never seem to want to make conversations with their guests.  Many times the bartenders are talking with each other and/or the kitchen staff and just not paying attention to their customers sitting at the bar.  I hate to write about poor service, but this is just one of the worst I've experienced, especially since I expect it to be a lot better since it's part of the Westin."},{"name":"Waffle House","address":"900 Wilson Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"The food was great and filling and the price was very reasonable.

Not that it was hard ... it was at the perfect consistency. And when asked what kind of butter it was, the waitress said 'Darigold', which was a good answer ... it just didn't square with the taste.

I cannot replace all my go to departments with Lucky's but on an item by item basis they are gaining on my shopping distribution. As Whole Foods has cut selection of brand name items, like reducing the array of flavors of Brown Cow Yogurt for instance, I have found the missing flavors always available at Lucky's. I live slightly closer to the south than the north location of Lucky's and parking is usually easy here, so I stop in now, about once a week for items I cannot find at Whole Foods. \\n\\nThe staff is nice, now that the opening operation of new staff has left or become regular, it has a homier feel than it did in the beginning. Sometimes there are not enough check stands open for a quick exit, but that's become routine now at most Boulder groceries. The fresh squeezed juice stand is especially nice and though seasonal availability sometimes affects my fave, valencia oj, I enjoy making a trip here when it is.

I came here on a late Saturday night with my cousin and her friends after game day. We had a big party (eight people to be exact) so it took us over an hour to get seated but the food and drinks were worth the wait. \\n\\nWe sat at the bar while we waiting for our table and started off with the Ice Ball Oldie. I definitely recommend trying an ice ball cocktail if you come here. A good amount of alcohol is put in their cocktails and when the ice melts out all the ingredients, you end up with a great drink where you can control how boozy you really want it to be. At the bar we also has the charred edamame and chocolate and cheese plate. Yes, the edamame had pop rocks but it didn't make much of a difference for me and I just ate the edamame straight up. The cheddar from the cheese plate was really great -- not too sharp -- and the chocolate and apple were a great way to balance out the flavors. \\n\\nFinally, we made it to the table and the real ordering began. Below is a list, in order, of what we ordered ranked by my preference:\\n1. The shrimp boil\\n2. Pork cheek\\n3. Goat shoulder \\n4. Lockhart quail\\n5. Squid fries\\n6. Brussels sprouts \\n\\nThe shrimp boil was overall fantastic. The shrimp and potatoes were cooked to the perfect texture, the micro celery salad was fresh and not too soggy, and that amazing sauce that actually made the whole dish. The pork cheek was my next favorite. To the chef that thought fig jam and spicy Dijon mustard would be great with pork cheek, you are a genius my friend. The goat shoulder was cooked very well with pull away tenderness and texture. The quail was great as well but my fried piece didn't have that much meat on it, which was slightly sad. My only reservation about the squid fries was that they tasted a little too processed to me but then again, I'm very sensitive to the taste of preservatives. And finally, the brussel sprouts. I was disappointed by them for many reasons, it was the smallest portion, it was a little too basic for me, there were only like three brussel sprouts total in the entire dish... Next time, I would go for the roasted beets or something. \\n\\nOverall, it was a great meal but the portions were overwhelmingly small. I know it's tapas style but come on, for how much each dish cost, the bang wasn't always worth the buck. I compare Swift's Attic to Bestia based on the vibes, creative cocktails, and creativity in regards to the type of dishes produced -- however, SA is lacking. \\n\\nSo, four stars total: great meal but I've had better and don't feel like I'm missing out that much if I go somewhere else."},{"name":"The Maple Parlor","address":"3538 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I really liked everything I sampled here!

It's a holiday weekend so it's crazy busy in Assembly Row, every square-inch is crowded with folks from all over, so you naturally assume most restaurants are going to have their act together to service and please. We walked in during dinner and were immediately seated in a back table inside (it was still too hot to sit outside) and were given our menus. \\n\\nInitial impressions of the place is what you'd expect from a southern stylized dinning experience, it's a rather large restaurant with plenty of outdoor seating on the patio.\\n\\nOur server Frank, started us off with our waters and we went through the motions of what looked good on the menu with our party of 4. Right from the start, my husband and brother were given a bath with a spilled beer, which wasn't necessarily Frank's fault, but the fact it took their staff 10 minutes to even clean is ridiculous. We sat in a puddle of Bud Light for a long time before some staff member decided to come over and sweep (yes sweep) the puddle of beer into a bin. The floor continued to stay moist and sticky throughout the dinner. I suppose this was a great foreshadowing of the night we were going to have. At the time of the spill, our wings arrived and we had to wait for another 8 minutes for a different server to bring us plates so we could actually begin eating them.\\n\\nWe followed up with our orders trying to play off the unfortunate event, even consoling our server who seemed really worried about the accident. These things happen, right? While we really enjoyed the wings, we have to say the rest of the dinner was pretty disappointing. Nothing was wow, the chicken and waffles were soggy, the ribs were incredibly sweet, the southwestern chicken was mediocre, and the bayou tacos were so terrible, I had to have them take it back after one bite. It might have actually been the most horrible thing I've eaten; though they label it as their highest seller (I don't understand how?) for novelty sake, we were like, hey lets try eating a gator! It was vile. Smelt as awful as it tasted.\\n\\nAfter we begrudgingly 'finished' out meal, we asked for our check and laughed at the fact it was even that high. The service was spotty and mediocre, the food was mediocre to awful, the restaurant was hot and sweltering (we sat inside for the AC, it was still hot and people were melting,) and after all this, we get a large bill only to be delivered by our server, Frank, telling us he hopes we had a good time and that we should leave him a great review on Yelp. Like really? Moments earlier we were contemplating what is the acceptable tip to give so a server that failed to deliver in so many ways and this guy is asking us for raving reviews.\\n\\nOverall, it was a terrible experience and probably will never return. I wanted to be careful and considerate because I've served before and understand it's a difficult job, but there is a fine line between being bad at your job and just being ignorant. They were clearly busy and understaffed, which wasn't Frank's fault, the food wasn't great, also not his fault, the bath he gave us, it was an accident, but to be absent and unreliable during the course of our dinning and THEN to ask for praise seems incredibly strange."},{"name":"Nestle Toll House Cafe by Chip","address":"8001 S Orange Blossom Trail, Ste 1206","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"I love cookies, and I've stopped here a few times on the way in and out of the mall as we usually park on this side.

The soup came and it has shrimp in it which I didn't think was noted on the menu. The soup was fine, nothing special. Then the pad Thai came and I wondered if I got the wrong food. It literally looked and tasted like no other pad Thai I ever had in my entire life. I eat a lot of Thai food, so I was rather disappointed when the \\"pad Thai\\" came.

It's was soggy. It looked as if it was freshly made but it's physically impossible to take a fresh waffle out and within a minute or so it be room temperature and soggy.  This happened 3 separate times where everyone at my\\nTables waffles were not warm....even when they brought them out...the waffles couldn't have been in a microwave for 30 seconds. VERY UNAMUSED. The manager clearly saw I was upset...so he asked if we made room for desert because it would be on the house....(a kind gesture) we of course accepted it. We ordered the pecan pie and my friend got a apple crumble thing I'm not sure BUT the waiter asked if we wanted ice cream on it and of course we said yes......NOW idk how authentic southern kin claims to be BUT pecan pie and apple crumple pie when they have ice cream on top of them...I'm sure it's implied that both the deserts are warm.....it makes no sense to have ice cream on a cold pastry. So I ask the manager if these dishes are suppose to be warm. He says no only if requested. I said \\"fair\\" even though I disagree may I have a warm pecan pie plz. He said yes. The pecan pie returned 15 mins later completely melted with a slab of ice cream on top of it like they were joking with me.....the manager then walks up to me and says does it taste good smiling ? This is comical to me at this point. This presentation of a meal was lack luster and I told him if this was serious....and he jus walked away. He then returned and as I explain to him the issues with my meal he implied that I was lying....I simply paid the bill and left. I did not feel welcomed nor appreciated as a customer considering I spent $250 on a bill and the managers excuse for the desert was well it's complimentary and no other food was sent back today so the issue must be with me.  Because I'm a black man in gym attire I don't think the manager valued me as a customer. I take my food very seriously I'm a professional athlete. Everything besides waffles and deserts were great.

Not this time.\\n\\nI made two attempts to get fried chicken from Hop's. Because of my aversion to crowds/lines and my somewhat unusual hours, I was pleased to see on Hop's website that it was open when I checked shortly after 10AM. I looked closely to see if there were any restrictions on the limited menu in terms of hours. None seen. Unlike, say, Matthews cafeteria in Tucker, which clearly states on its menu that fried chicken is offered during dinner hours only, not breakfast or lunch. I appreciate that information - I'd hate to drive out to Tucker to be disappointed. Hop's isn't quite the drive for me.\\n\\nYou can see where this is going. I arrive shortly after 10:30 and am informed that fried chicken is not available until 11AM. I scan the hard copy menu in front of me. That isn't mentioned. Maybe I missed it, but I do know it isn't on the website menu. I don't want to wait around for 20-25 minutes (which would mean I'd have to move my car out of the 30 minute lot), so I leave and eat leftovers at home.\\n\\nSecond attempt, at 11AM. Yay! My order for half a chicken is taken. I also order two sides - mac & cheese and cole slaw. The food comes out pretty quick, I'll give them that. As the guy is packing my tub, I ask if the sides were inside because I don't see them. He says yes. Cool.\\n\\nYou can probably see where this is going, too. No sides in the tub. Just two rolls I don't want. OK, people make mistakes and things get left out. I understand. But when your customer specifically asks if the sides are packed inside, how do you say yes if you didn't pack them or see that someone else did? \\n\\nSo, my $9 order of half a chicken cost $15 and I don't get the pleasure of trying that M&C that Kristin B says is the best in the universe.\\n\\nThe chicken? Not bad but not write-home-to-Mom good. Pretty good deal, too ($9, not $15). Three stars for the chicken. The frim fram sauce went unused. It was not something I wanted to put on the chicken, although I can see how some might like it.\\n\\nMinus one star for the menu. You know, I'm actually a little tired of these high-profile chefs not being able to incorporate basic customer-driven practices into their businesses. How do you not mention on your frickin' website that fried chicken is only available after 11AM? And this from a chef-owner famous for not serving his signature burger before 10PM. I've run into this type of failure at other new places, such as at Krog St Market. Annoys me.\\n\\nMinus one star for not filling a very simple order (three items) correctly, even after the customer asks. If I hadn't asked, I'd let this one slide.\\n\\nSo, a one star review.

But the blend they use here just makes my tongue wince, and it seems others have the same experience. Their homemade almond milk too, is a bit 'off' for my taste - the flavors of date just don't sit right, and because their coffee is so acidic, it ends up 'curdling' it all the time. Almond/soy doesn't curdle because they aren't dairy, but the acid in the coffee causes the proteins in the non-dairy milk to coagulate, and it doesn't look pretty.  When you're at a cafe and spending around $5 on a coffee, you want your coffee to look pretty! I think pre-warming the almond/soy might help.\\n\\nService is hit and miss.

They actually have a pretty good variety of dishes and larger selection than many places, but unfortunately I thought most of them lacked flavor and heat. The palak paneer is pureed to baby food consistency, which isn't really my thing--flavor-wise I thought it held up but the texture didn't do it for me. The aloo matar was easily the best dish in terms of flavor. The korma and chicken makhani tasted pretty much the same which was disappointing. The samosa and pakora were good but a bit cold (we did come near the end of lunch, so that is on us). Maybe I just have a high standard for the flavor in Indian food. I think if you are new to it, this might be an okay place to start as I didn't think any of the dishes were particularly spicy but as I said, they were a bit muted as well. I was excited for the mango ice cream/frozen yogurt (not sure which it is) and the flavor was nice but I thought it was a bit icy so wouldn't get it again.\\n\\nI do plan on visiting at least once more, closer to the start of lunch or dinner, to give it another try.

Afterwards, we told our server and he took care of the issue.\\n\\nAnyhooo, let's move on to the more memorable (and worth noting) dishes of the night.  \\nThe awesomeness: \\nCharred Edamame with pop rocks - delicious and very tasty, you must add the pop rocks to give it that extra crunchy, popping texture. \\nDevils on Horseback (figs & gorgonzola) - absolutely amazing. I usually don't like gorgonzola but the combination of that with the figs and candied bacon, so divine! Got that salty & sweet flavour. \\nThe beet salad & Grilled Butternut squash were delicious. Both dishes were dressed nicely and the flavours oh so rich for a plate of veggies. YUM. \\nThe Korean BBQ Flank Steak - flavour flavour flavour Wow. Party in my mouth! The steak was tender, the rice cakes were a tasteful addition! And the sweet galbi sauce brings the dish together. Slightly over salted, but nonetheless very good! \\n\\nThe oh-so average dishes:\\nCorn Fritters - nothing special about this dish at all. Just fried batter with bits of corn. \\nOrange is the new quail (on fresh sheet) - quail meat was tough and the dish was rather salty. \\nThe fungi dish - creative use of the different types of mushrooms (even had snow fungus - a delicacy in Chinese food). However, this dish was by far the saltiest dish EVER. Lighten up on the soy & salt! You needed to gulp down a glass of water after each bite. \\nThe fried pig ears lettuce wrap - heavily sauced with not so crispy pig ears were hard to chew and tough. Perhaps the heavy sauce had made the crisp ears into soggy ears. \\nFunfetti tres leches - pretty much grocery box cake in little bite size pieces. Pricey for what it is. \\n\\nSo there it is.

After trying some of our go-tos and seeing that their bars were full, we began walking down the street to go to another place. As we're walking, we noticed Nouveau and before I could even ask, \\"What's that?,\\" a guy opens the door and invites us to come in and try the place out lol.\\n\\nBefore entering, we asked about their happy hour and after seeing the menu, we were sold. We came in and sat at the bar and were greeted and given regular menus. The happy hour menu was not printed but could be found on the restaurant's Instagram (a little inconvenient, but doable). There were both drink and food specials on the happy hour menu, so I ordered the mai tai and jerk wings to start. The mai tai was nice and fruity with a kick, but not as strong as I would've liked it to be. The wings took longer than expected to come out, but when I finally got them, they were delicious. The jerk seasoning was super SPICY though...so spicy, I couldn't finish them...my nose was running and everything lol. Also, these wings are smoked, so as you may know, some smoked chicken has a pinkish tint, which was the case here.\\n\\nI was still hungry, so I ordered spinach dip and another mai tai. By this point, we had another friend join us so we closed our ticket and moved to the table. The place started filling up, so service became a bit slower, but our server was very nice and accommodating. My spinach dip came out and it was not bubbly as the description suggested, but it was still good. I wound up ordering an entree of chicken wings and waffle fries and it came out fairly quickly and was absolutely delicious!\\n\\nThis place is nice...black-owned, beautiful decor, friendly and helpful staff, but definitely a few kinks to work out. I will most certainly be back though!

They had the texture of chips that you buy from the store after you've opened the bag and return a couple days later to have some. The spinach dip itself was just disappointing, I don't have any suggestions for how it could have been corrected short of \\"just throw it out and start from scratch.\\" I took a bite and told the waiter I was not satisfied. He told me he would leave the dish on the table so that the manager could come and talk to me about it. The manager never showed, despite seeing him walk past a few times. \\n\\nMy waiter eventually removed the dish himself and I ordered the steak and salmon combination dish. I requested the salmon and steak cooked medium. After a long wait, the dish arrived and I began eating to find that both items were overcooked. They should not even take a temperature request on the thin slices of meat they refer to as steak. I asked my waiter for the manager and cut into the center of both proteins ready to show that they were a far cry from medium. The manager agrees that the food is overcooked and offers to make me another one. I decline since neither my appetizer nor the entree were acceptable thus far and at this point, I wasn't going to hold out for the third time being the charm. I told him I would be happy to pay for the kid's meal and the two drinks I had ordered if he would give us a slice of cheesecake for the inconvenience. He said he wouldn't charge me for the food I didn't eat, but he also wouldn't give me the cheesecake.\\n\\nI have worked in the customer service and the food service industry, and know that it's far better to give a customer an $8 slice of defrosted cheesecake to ensure a return patron than to sacrifice hundreds of dollars worth of repeat business. But this arrogant excuse for low-level management material would rather sit on his pedestal of frozen cheesecakes than to compensate for their myriad of mistakes. I asked to speak to the GM and was told she wasn't in. He refused to give me any information on how to contact her.\\n\\nBeyond the lackluster food experience, from our table that was near the kitchen, we could clearly overhear the waitstaff speaking negatively about the restaurant's patrons and using profanity while doing so. Any manager worth their salt would not allow such unprofessionalism in the work place and certainly not within earshot of paying customers. \\n\\nWith all the bad reviews and failed health inspections on their record, this place desperately needs some sort of overhaul intervention from corporate.

They accommodated all my boyfriends allergies. This is something 4 rivers and other places don't do. It was nice for him to be able to try multiple sides and all the dishes they offer. They even labeled the sauce that is Glutten Free. \\nService blew us away. Even though you order at the counter we were consistently checked on.

We were seating quickly, had a nice row of reserved table, and were attended to very well by the management, waitress, and all staff in general. \\n\\nA few appetizers were ordered and we tried the blue fish cakes and the calamari. The blue fish cakes were really moist and the sauce was really smoky and tasty. The calamari was a little bland, but they were cooked with hot peppers which gave it that good kick. They could have been seasoned a little bit more for me personally, but the sauce they came with had a good garlic flavor that was really tasty. \\n\\nFor cocktails, Dorian went with the Elderflower Cocktail, which was sweet and delicious and made with (of course) elderflower liqueur. I went with a Somerville Sidecar. It was a little bit less intense than a regular sidecar, and really tasty. The drinks were pretty reasonable and were in the $7-8 range. They also serve Harpoon cream soda and root beer, which was approved by my young brother in law. The beer menu was pretty good as well, along with the wine listing, which was pretty reasonable cost-wise. \\n\\nFor dinner I ordered the Highland Cheeseburger. It didn't disappoint, though I would have preferred my medium rare burger to be a little more rare. The onions were delicious that it was served with, and though I would have preferred it to come with lettuce and tomato, it was good without it. I came with a scattering of sweet pickles on the side, which were good, but I am dill sort of girl. The fries were good but not completely consistent-Jesse's were cooked better than mine, as in a little less on the brown side. They were still good, just a matter of preference. Highland Kitchen has a yummy array of sides for cheap (between $3 and $4) and appetizers are very reasonable and delicious sounding-we'll be back for appetizers and cocktails VERY soon because they sound delicious. Jesse got a side of mac and cheese, which was super rich and just the right amount for how intense it was. \\n\\nDesserts were spot on, and the chocolate cake was warm and molten and came with chocolate ice cream on the side. The boys shared some banana bread pudding that came with vanilla ice cream and there was nothing left in that bowl. \\n\\nWe'll definitely be back and there's been hype about this place for a reason, 'cause it's really great."},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This was our first stop in Orlando, and it did not disappoint.

Not super sweet and great balance. I settled on a flight ($9) which comes with 4 scoops. The strawberry balsamic w/ black pepper is one my fav. Rich strawberry ribbons balanced with the balsamic was a perfect pair. Coava coffee with chocolate flecks were excellent for a coffee lover. The bitterness of rich coffee and chocolate was wonderful. Chocolate hazelnut cookies and cream was a mix of Oreo with hazelnut flavor. Sweet potato casserole with pecan truly tasted like a beloved thanksgiving side. The crunch of the pecan fit into this ice cream flavor flawlessly. \\n\\nI love the unique flavors of salt & straw plus the friendliness of everyone in the store.

My husband raved about the steak tartare with quail egg, while I could have eaten a plateful of the foie gras Bon Bon.  The pork loin was slightly dried out, but the preserves on top made up for the dryness.  Pork rib was delicious, salad (sadly) average, and cheese plate good if not uninventive.

First time i went there, i was charged $9 for a 1/4 link of sausage and a drink, i really hope it was an error. the second time  i went they were out of food an hour before closing time.  so my advice, check the prices and go early"},{"name":"Fullerton Wines","address":"1966 NW Pettygrove St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"This is a hidden gem in NW Portland.  We love the ambiance of the wine tasting room and are seriously considering renting the place for a private party.\\n\\nThe Fullerton family of wines are fantastic especially their Pilot Noir and Chardonnay.

The kabobs is just colorful but lacks any flavor. The tandoori chicken had some amount of pinkish flesh left. Parotas aren't made to order! I would totally about this place.\\nGoat biryani has meat which is chewy indicates poor quality meat or burnt.\\nThis is the review after two visits two months apart!"},{"name":"Flatiron Restaurant & Bar","address":"520 Flat Shoals Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Impossible burger was good. Had a nice charge to it. I have to be careful with that some may say it's burnt. However I liked it. They are tots were crisp. The bun wasn't toasted. \\n\\nThe burger with the spicy queso was not spicy at all."},{"name":"Guac y Margys","address":"661 Auburn Ave NE, Ste 120","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars only because their margaritas are delicious. But the food...it's simply not good. Maybe the reviews are from people who never had real Mexican food? But if you're expecting tasty salsa and guac? This is not the place. The chips taste store bought, the salsa and queso also store bought. The tacos are meh and expensive at 5 bucks per taco. There are so many better places with better food, but if you're walking down the belt line and just want a drink, this place will do."},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"*** UPDATE ***\\nCustomer service is on point here. They offered to give me new ribs to replace the ones I had after seeing this review. Just for that, they deserve more stars!\\n\\n****\\n\\n\\nI got the brisket + ribs plate. The brisket was tender and not dry. It was fatty and glorious. The ribs were good but a little dry. I think if I were to go back, I would just get he brisket. Their fries were also amazing. They weren't just plain fries, they were tossed in spices. So simple, but makes such a difference.
