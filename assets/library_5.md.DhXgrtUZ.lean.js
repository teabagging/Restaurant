It was probably one of the nicest nights of the year, I expected it. When we finally got to our table, our waiter was very flighty and hard to track down, but the real problem was the food! We ordered the crispy green beans first, and those were good, but then I ordered a burger and fries. The burger was so salty I could barely eat it. Other people got the chicken, and they said it was good, but they weren't particularly impressed. Then we ordered dessert -- the chocolate torte -- and it was so underwhelming that half of it went uneaten (if you know me, you know that wasting sweets is sacrilege to me, no sweet should ever go uneaten around me). After dessert, the waiter brought us our ticket, but we were enjoying the night and wanted to stay for a bit -- he never checked on us again! I couldn't even find him! We wanted to order another round of drinks, but apparently he wasn't interested, so after sitting there for an extra 45 minutes, we left and went somewhere else. \\n\\nThe setup at Contigo is so wonderful that I can't believe I'm giving it two stars.

You're told it'll be 45-60 minutes for delivery.  Okay, not a problem.  But then your order taker calls back after 30 minutes:  the bad news is that they have somehow managed to lose your address (so you once again have to spell it out for him).  The good news is that your order is now on its way.  Apparently, they take the long way because your delivery guy finally shows up forty-five minutes later (75 minutes total). You tip him 20% on top of a $31 bill which is for all of one pizza and one salad before realizing he has brought your pizza but not your salad.  \\"Oh, sorry,\\" he says.  \\"I'll go back and get it.\\"  After he leaves, you conclude that you don't want to wait another 75 minutes for a salad that won't be eaten with the pizza, so you call and cancel it, asking them to credit your credit card.  But they can't do that.  They'll have the manager call you back instead.  Uh-huh.  So you and your family return to your pizza.  It's cold.  Yeah, you paid $31 + tip for one cold pizza.  Boy, are you stupid.  \\n\\nBut a few days later, a ray of light manages to shine through the clouds of incompetence when not the manager but the actual owner calls you.  You're impressed.  He apologizes, but he clearly does not want to refund your money.  Instead, he offers to leave a note at the store saying that when you next call in, he'll give you a free medium pizza along with the salad you've already paid for.  Okay, whatever.  You take the free pizza offer rather than insisting on your money back.    \\n\\nCut to:  Three weeks later.  Your family's in a mood for pizza again and you call to claim your pizza and salad.  Cynical you who expects the worst gets a pleasant surprise -- the guy on the other end of the phone actually finds the owner's note.  They actually know what you're talking about.  So you order your pizza and salad thinking this is amazing and Mr. Yaghi is a stand-up guy.  Unfortunately, however, cynical you was right to be cynical and it's all too good to be true:  rather than give you a delivery time for your order, they tell you that the owner's offer is only good for pick-up.  That's right, your delivery pizza has been converted to a pick-up.  Can you talk to a manager about this?  Nope.  Take it or leave it.  You leave it.  You email the company asking what's up and asking for the refund you should've asked for in the first place.  You never hear anything back.  Yeah, it's just a salad but you work hard for your money and it's awfully irritating that these people feel like they can take it without giving anything in return, so you write this review encouraging your fellow humans to buy pizza from somebody else.  Especially if you like your pizza warm and your money well-spent.\\n\\nUPDATE:  the owner did contact me again and offered a full refund.

I posted some photos earlier.  A Groupon offer is what brought us to the restaurant.  The brunch was amazing.  Set up buffet style there was a variety of of  food prepared and presented as if you were in a 5 star hotel grabbing breakfast in the morning.  The taste was matched. There were a selection of pastries, bagels with salmon locks, shrimp and grits, eggs Benedict, bacon, potato pancakes (a different take on what I grew up with bu very tasty), quiche, bacon, and other things I did not have room to try.  So the food alone deserved 5 stars.\\n\\nThe manager or owner did come by.  She was friendly and made some conversation.  She seemed very nice and accommodating.\\n\\nHere is where things fell short and brought down the rating:\\n\\n1.) The groupon was supposed to include 2 brunches and 2 drinks. How ever I still paid 7 dollars more.   Not too big of a feel but I do not like to be misled.  It;s no the way people should do business.\\n\\n2.) The counter service was strange.  The people took our order and gave us a couple cups to get our own beverages.  No big deal. There was a line for tipping as well as a jar stuffed with 5's, 10's, and 20's.  They had only been open for 2 hours and the place was empty.  Now I know that tipping is always optional I do not like when I cannot tell if I am \\"supposed to\\" or not.  I also hate tipping in fast casual before I sit down and eat.  I have not received any service besides you running my card and handing me a cup.  I just don't like that awkward situation or the obviously inflated tip jar to get you to tip more. I always leave the tip, even in fast casual, after I eat.  \\n\\n3.) More on the service aspect.  Not a single plate was picked up until the end of our meal.  Now I tend, at a buffet, to grab or two things at a time in small portions.  After all, I am not sure If I will even like it yet.  As in any buffet we got a new plate when we went up each time.  There was no where to bring them.  The manager/ owner fell short here in that she did not take the stack of plates when she came by either.\\n\\nEssentially the food was fantastic so fantastic that as disappointing I was in the bait in switch tactic of the groupon and the service I am still giving four stars.  But they need to choose to be fast casual like panera/ four rivers where you clear your own things and just have a thing or two dropped off, or have their food runner actually earn the tips that they are asserting they are earning,"},{"name":"Hot Rod Coffee Trailer","address":"6546 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"I moved to Austin in March from No Ca.

Then you run a marathon. Actually, this last aspect of being an Austinite probably won't come into fruition after coming to eating here. What follows is a review on the one item that will not afford you the ability to move after indulging here.\\n\\nWhat the heck is going on here... I was pretty sure that everything biscuit and fried had already been taken care of in Austin, served out of something along the lines of a trailer. And, as always, I was completely wrong. Fried biscuits... they put two novelty true grubbing items in one little--well more like 3-bite--piece.\\n\\nI have no idea where the name Yummy Yecca's originates, but at least it sounds crafty. These new trailer names are hard to come by nowadays, and that is no doubt in part due to the vast amount of trailers to begin with. Along with this, the concept is just funky and fresh--tacos, gorditas, sammies, and BISCUIT BOMBS. Let us see what is actually in this unique concept; I feel like many an eatery-on-wheels will start moving toward trying to imitate this gut-wrenching parcel of fried goodness.\\n\\nIt comes in the form of a ball, well-fried, and chock full of their well-chosen toppings. So, you got a crust, with so much crunch that you would think you were biting into a wonton; it actually looks much like a wonton skin from the outside. Then, I bit into the \\"Night and Day\\" flavor. It was cookie dough. Wow. Literally, gooey and chocolatey as anything in a 50-mile radius.\\n\\nAt $3 a pop, they are certainly not the cheapest thing around, but this fried piece of goodness is far more satisfying than one of those ridiculous $3 cake balls that are all the rage right now.

I have my list of favorites when I come to Atlanta, and Gladys Knight's is now on it, secured as a staple for every future visit.\\n\\nThe Restaurant:  while the neighborhood was a touch sketchy and the construction outside was anything but welcoming, once I got inside I completely forgot all that and was instantly impressed.  Relaxing, upscale decor instantly put me in the mood for chicken n waffles, some jazz, and enjoying a meal with my wife here.  The walls are covered in history - so many celebrities and great musicians - I was tempted to walk around the place like a museum and look at them all.\\n\\nThe Staff:  The staff was very friendly, true to Southern hospitality, and welcomed us like family coming over for a visit.  They took the time to ask us how we liked the food, liked the restaurant, and to learn a bit about us and where we were from.  \\n\\nThe Food:  FYI - drooling on my keyboard as I write this.  The chicken was moist with excellent seaonings and I found myself wishing i had another belly or two so I could keep eating.  The waffles were simple, but well-cooked and a perfect match in texture and flavor to the chicken.\\n\\nWe left there to catch our flight home - and I got some serious fat-belly-shuteye on the flight home (which never happens) - thanks to the tasty deliciousness filling my belly.

Afterall, the best Korean fare I've had was at someone's  (house) outside of Seoul. I've eaten at Shin Jung many times over the years and am happy that they've seemingly improved their ventilation (though it still leaves something to be desired). I enjoy samgyeopsal, but don't enjoy suffocating while myself and other patrons prepare it. I have to rate Shin Jung three stars because during my most recent visit this week I was not really impressed with the quality of meat I received. The samgyeopsal was thin and barely contained meat. I am aware that it's meant to be fatty, but having lived in South Korea I also know it should be cut thicker than the one I received here. The kimchi was not flavorful -- which seems impossible, but true. My recommendation is to skip the samgyeopsal and order kalbi. I'm not sure if the times before I was in a soju stupor, or if this time the quality was just inferior.

They use quality ingredients and that is fantastic.  I don't know anywhere else where they are doing this, not subway, and not thundercloud subs.  So, for that alone, I will always come back.\\n\\nThe People:  I always like to talk to my servers while I am there, and these guys will actually carry a conversation with you, joke with you and talk to you about whatever you want to talk about really, so its real cool.\\n\\nThe Combo:  I don't remember what the combo is, but its actually the best price of the whole place.  Its like 7.50 or 8$.  They combo comes with a drink and a chip and a sandwich.  The other cool thing about that is that the combo is OFTEN DIFFERENT.  So you get to try out all kinds of cool stuff for the price of a regular meal somewhere.  I wouldn't have tried some of the stuff they put out unless it was the combo and I actually really enjoyed it too.\\n\\nIngredients:  They have a lot of fresh nice ingredients and what is cool is I really like a customizable sandwich.  So I can ask them to cut the vegetables a certain way or put the meat on first or second or whatever I want and they don't care.\\n\\nMexican Coke Rating: I give them a 2 out of 5.

(99 bottles of wine on the ceiling ... drop one down, take out a patron ... 98 bottles of wine on the ceiling ...!)\\n\\nI like a wine bar to unwind from a days work or to up-wind for an evening out with friends.  At the Bin, they provide you with choices of  pre-dinner snacks, wine offerings in 100 ml, 250 ml, 500 ml, or bottle form.  Supposedly there are dozens of wines to choose from, but you can only taste from a select list, which resides at the rear of a leather-bound novel ... about the origins of booze.\\n\\nI didn't get a true snooty vibe until I left.  Patrons entering exclaimed \\"your welcome!!!\\" when I opened the door and they patiently held it for me.  What a weird way to exit such a satisfying experience.  \\n\\nAnd by satisfying, I mean that the appetizers I shared with a friend were actually ... satisfying and a good price.  The prosciutto was unlike others I have ever tasted before (but let me tell you, I've had my share of prosciutto!): buttery, thinly sliced, not too salty, the beets were crisp and sweet, everything was served with arugula, and the olive oil was a nice quality.\\n\\nIt was a strange atmosphere, but with the right attitude at the right time, I can see how Bin does good things for you. I suppose I felt the snoot, but whatev, half the wine on the list  I'd never heard of (brand-wise) and the prices were surprisingly decent.  Between me and friend: 6 100 ml wine tastings ranging from $5 to $13, plus four apps (plus bread), brought our tag to $70, just about even.  Split that up, and you have a classy after work joint and perhaps your later dinner not required.  Hm.\\n\\nBut, ya know what?  Do it for the bar. \\n\\nArrive early when you have a late reservation and enjoy a tasting or two ... or three.  Or even a bottle.

Incredibly wrong. \\n\\nI walk into the store to be greeted...by no one. I stood at the counter pondering - What do I do? This is a-w-k-w-a-r-d. I stood there for a bit actually - still no one. Finally, I decide to open and close the front door, hoping to make a noise that will prompt someone to come out from wherever they're hiding. \\n\\nA woman suddenly appears from the back of the store, not looking happy mind you. I feel embarrassed for a second wondering, is this place closed? Because I'm honestly being treated as if I walked in one minute after it was closed. If looks could kill, I swear you would've had to mop the floor of my dead body. She obviously did not want to help me, was annoyed with me while taking my order, and couldn't even crack a smile at the end even though I was incredibly polite and nice throughout the entire encounter. She's right though, how dare I order two wraps at 3:30 PM. \\n\\nAs if matters couldn't get more awkward, she had no idea what was in the damn wraps I ordered and had to continue checking the menu while making them, thus dragging out the process BIG TIME. A gentleman walked in while I was being helped, sensed the poor customer service, and left. No one acknowledged his presence - how hard is it to say \\"hey man, I see you. I'll be right with you\\"?? I finally get my wraps, tell the lady to have a great day, and I get zero response. Whatever, at least I am going to enjoy this delicious wrap once I get back to my desk...lol\\n\\nUpon returning to the office, I quickly unwrap the goods (I am starving at this point), sink my teeth into the wrap - and damn! I bite into something hard! I start inspecting the wrap to discover that the quinoa in my wrap is hard. Like hurting my mouth and getting stuck in my teeth hard. I look over at my colleague to be met with a \\"wtf\\" facial expression and can quickly tell that she's experiencing the same thing. I'm not sure if the quinoa was burnt, or what, but I was sure of one thing - the wrap was awful. In addition to the burnt, crunchy quinoa issue, neither of our wraps had the dressing or sauce that they were supposed to come with. \\n\\nAt the end of the day we ended up with wraps that were bland, bland, bland, that might as well have been stuffed full of popcorn kernels, and after enduring mean customer service.

The rub on it is incredible and the brisket is so soft, it's like butter when it hits your mouth. Delicious! The chipotle cold slaw is spicy which I love. The pulled pork is nicely cooked but lacks a little flavor. They give sides of BBQ sauce which is delicious. I recommend you go early around 10am before it opens so you don't miss out on the ribs and sausage. I heard they are great! We will definitely be back.

We came here to escape a loud environment and ended up in one worse.  Not much they can do about that, but there you go.\\n\\nSLOOOOOOOOOW -  This is the main drawback.  They are so, so slow, that we FINISHED our appetizer BEFORE they brought our strawberry lemonade drinks.  I don't remember this happening anywhere else, ever.  Good thing we didn't choke on our chips.  Our waitress complained that it was the bartender's fault, which became her personal mantra for the rest of our dinner (somebody else's fault).\\n\\nSLOOOOOOOOOW -  Then, after they brought our drinks, it took them more than 40 minutes to give us a pot pie and fried chicken.  The waitress said it was the kitchen's fault, and that everybody put their orders at once.  She also blamed the pot pie, because apparently, it takes a long time to cook.  Mind you, their pot pies do not have full crust, just the top.  Why can I bake them quicker at home than this restaurant can is something they need to figure out.  Anyway, by the time our food got to the table, we were no longer hungry.  That's another first for us.\\n\\nSLOOOOOOOOOOW - Second round of drinks was brought by another employee, then our waitress showed up complaining that she was waiting for the drinks at the bar and somebody else had took them, that the whole restaurant was working against her.

That's a sign your restaurant is in the steep decline to ban-lists, when Cracker Barrel does a supremely better job than you in service and outdoes you in taste too.

I can't say enough bad things about the food. Two of us ordered the grilled cheese, one of us ordered an omelet, I ordered the steak salad, we ordered some truffle fries (not good), and shrimp corn dogs. DO NOT ORDER THE GRILLED CHEESE. It seriously looks like a kid made it. Literally, they give you a big plate, and stick two slices of what looks like Wonder Bread with some Kraft cheese on it. That's it. It was so hilarious when the waiter set it down that we all started laughing hysterically. It was unbelievable. Everything was so bad, we were in awe of the horrible experience we were getting. Oh yeah, not to mention we waited probably 40 minutes for our food: mind you, we ordered GRILLED CHEESE, and an OMELET as our main dishes. And then, the food was cold. Naturally. \\n\\n5.

There was no way we were paying for any of this. \\n\\n6. Once we spoke to a different waitress about our experience, she was apologetic, but didn't bring us a bill so that we could pay for what we ate- namely the fries and corn dogs (which were overpriced).

The portion sizes were ample for the price, and everything was delicious.

My friends and I would deliberately choose the place based on the delicious food and the classy atmosphere was an additional bonus. The last time I had experienced eating at Hunan House was sometime around 2010, celebrating my birthday. My friend noted the odd texture of her chicken and had complained to the staff of the quality. At the time, I had not noticed any substandard meat on my place, so I thought she was just being picky. A week ago I placed a to-go order around 4 pm on a Monday. It was dead. I was the only patron in the building. The ambiance was lacking simply by the entrance fountain that was obviously being examined for repair, but it appeared that the sense of urgency was lacking. I asked the lady who took my order what was going on and she shrugged and laughed. I don't think the staff knows how much the ambiance goes hand in hand with the experience a person has with their palate. You would think that the kitchen crew would have spent an extra amount of time to ensure quality of my food as they were not busy. Besides the fact that the $20+ bill of my order of Crab Rangoon and Mango Chicken almost convinced me to check their math, I accepted the fee and paid. I no sooner produced my phone from my purse to peruse social media then my food was ready. At home, I started digging in to my Crab Rangoon only to notate the fact that the filling was so meager, I almost didn't detect any filling at all. This of course set the tone of disappointment for the meal I was about to criticize. Something was \\"off\\" about the sauce on my Mango Chicken. It didn't have that depth and richness I had experienced before. The mangos were cooked to death and were mushy, not soft and chewy. They also were so reduced, they were almost non-existent. Finally, the \\"chicken\\". Oh the chicken. Not even my cat would eat the chicken. I don't know what that was, but the texture was odd and rubbery. I finally gave up and ate everything else on my plate. It's sister restaurant Hunan Lion has higher standards and has never failed me.

I made a reservation the night before for 7:00. It's a really cool location (second floor of a building with a wrap around balcony) and the place itself is very simple but pretty. We got there at 6:50-7:00 and were seated immediately. We decided to sit outside because honestly it was pretty loud inside, but unfortunately it started pouring rain about 8 minutes after we got there! We were quickly moved inside. While we were outside for 8 ish minutes, we only received our menus. No one came to give drinks and the bread came out 30 seconds before we were moved inside. That seems like a long amount of time from initially sitting down to getting bread but not drinks. Anyway, we moved inside and there were maybe a total of 15 tables that night. Finally we got some water and ordered our food because we were  ready because we had so much time to look at the menu. We ordered the fritto appetizer, I ordered the risotto with braised short rib and my boyfriend ordered the pasta with pork and veal ragu. Our appetizer came out within 10 minutes; not bad. We were constantly refilled with water by people who were not our waiters (they have lots of bussers who refill drinks and pick up plates).\\nI kid you not, 45 minutes had gone by and our food had yet to come. Our waitress had not come over during that entire time to tell us what was going on/offer us something because of the wait. And I'm not saying the wait was her fault at all; it may have been a kitchen error. But throughout the entire night, our waitress maybe came over 5 times. \\nAfter 50 minutes of waiting, our waitress came over and told us the kitchen decided to feed all the big parties first (????) and that everyone else's food was going to come out at the same time. No apologies for the wait or anything. People who got there after us and a little before us had not received their entrees either. \\nAnyway. About 55 minutes in, we finally received our food. If we're going to wait almost an hour, hopefully the food is fantastic, right? Hmm... My boyfriend and I tasted each other's dishes along with our own and I honestly don't think the kitchen knows what seasoning is. A pasta with ragu with pork and veal should taste like pork and veal (AND SOME SALT) right? It was more than bland. It looked pretty, but it literally had no taste at all. My risotto was a little overcooked for my personal taste, but it had a decent flavor. As for the short rib, it was SUPER tough. It wasn't  tender and it was very chewy. Also, beef short rib should taste like beef, right? It literally tasted like nothing other than a slight wine taste they maybe used to braise it in. The beef flavor wasn't even there at all, let alone much flavor. Almost an hour wait for tough short rib, and VERY under seasoned pasta and ragu... Super disappointed by the food because it all looked so good.\\nIt took them around 10 minutes to pick up our plates after we were clearly done. Because they ask you when you make a reservation if you're celebrating anything, they brought us a dessert for my boyfriend's birthday (but she didn't ask us which dessert we wanted)... We had no idea what it was (no description of it, it was just given to us). There was a hard, toffee tasting cake and an odd tasting ice cream and caramel popcorn. The table next to us also had a birthday, but their waiter asked them which dessert they wanted (yet we didn't?). \\nAt this point it's around 8:30. We were ready to get the check and go. Once again, I kid you not, it took 15 minutes for our waitress to come over and get our card! (I literally put the card on the table, clearly letting her know we were ready, and she even made eye contact with my boyfriend who said \\"we're ready,\\" and 15 minutes from that point go by..... I'm not sure how many tables our waitress had, but as said before, she maybe visited us a total of 5 times throughout 2 hours. \\nFinally we paid and left. \\nIt's hard for me to want to give places like this a second chance because I'm not sure if this place always has service/food like this or if it honestly was a bad night. We have both worked in restaurants before (boyfriend currently still works in them/is going to school for restaurant management/marketing) so that's why we were at first very understanding. But all restaurants should have a certain standard to live up to, and 2 plus hours of waiting for mediocre/under seasoned food and meh service is not a very good standard. I feel as though 3 stars is being very generous after the experience. I'm not sure if we'll be back."},{"name":"Local No 7","address":"2316 Main St, Ste A","city":"Tucker","stars":"3.5","text":"Just tried this place for the first time.

I was told food had to be on the table to be served alcohol since it was before noon on a Sunday. I ordered the hush puppies but they never came and got my bloody mary anyways lol. I didn't care for the hush puppies but why tell me I have to have food on the table and not enforce the rule? I thought that was kind of pointless and almost a ploy for people to order sides/apps if they wish to drink before noon.\\n\\nThat stuff didn't really ruin my meal though. My rabbit dumplings at first were pretty good but on the salty side. The first few bites were fine (a little gamey at times) then I started encountering bones and other hard things in my meal. I don't know about you but if you're hungover I'm not trying to choke/die on a toothpick sized bunny bone.

Unfortunately, it was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had! Let me start with the 3 pros:  our table was ready when we arrived for our reservation, the ambience was nice, and our waitress did seem to be trying her best all on her own... she warned us that this was her second day on the job.  (Question: why put a brand-new waitress to wait on a table of 10 alone on her second day?)\\n\\nThat brings us to the cons:  \\n\\n1. When serving the meals, the wait staff gave two of our table's burger dishes to another table.  The other 8 girls were served and awkwardly waited, while the food cooled, for the other two dishes.  When we were able to flag our waitress down several minutes later, she realized the error (partially) and put in one more order for a burger (she needed to put in 2!)  The one burger arrived, we waited several more minutes, and then had to flag her down again to ask for the last one. She realized it was never ordered and our poor last diner had to wait ages for her dish.  One of the managers came over to \\"apologize\\" but it was a poor attempt.  Later the waitress came back to ask if we wanted pancake shots on the house.  A few girls accepted the offer - apparently the shots were gross :-\\\\\\n\\n2.  Some dishes were good, the rest were sub-par.  Maybe we came in on an off day?  Maybe they would have been better if we could have eaten them hot and fresh out of the kitchen?  A couple girls did say that the burgers were not cooked to the temperature that was ordered.  \\n\\n 3.  When ordering the food we had asked the waitress if she could split the checks at the end, she assured us it was no problem.  Come time to pay - it ended up being a huge problem!  Multiple dishes were on the wrong checks, and it took her three lonnggggg tries to finally get it right.  I felt bad that she was clearly struggling and management seemed to do nothing to help.  One of the managers came over to clear a dish and I asked her to help our waitress so we could get a move on (we had already been there 2 hours and 15 minutes!)  She had a completely blank stare.  Ugh! *heads hitting the table*\\n\\nI thought maybe this was because of the size of our group but then noticed other tables of only 2-4 patrons were also spending a lot of time waiting.

Chicken liver mousse was smooth but def needs the pickled onion to cut through the fat, we asked for extra of those! Duck fat fries were good, but prob our least favorite since they didn't taste too different from regular fries. Also the crispy Brussels sprouts were nice and light with all the fatty foods we ordered. Last small plate we got was the crispy pork belly-- OMG, soo tender and nicely braised.

Their dining area is entirely floor to ceiling windows (not much insulation) and it was only 37 degrees outside, so it was really cold inside.  (I need to remember to dress warmly if going there in the winter.)  However, the tastiness of their food warmed me up eventually.  Friendly service by the guy at the counter.  Also good to see curry on the menu.  I ordered curry chicken with rice and it was pretty good.  I like their thicker Chinese style gravy-like curry. . .different than Thai or Indian.  Also appreciated that the side dish was a crisp salad (instead of the ubiquitous pile of limp cooked cabbage that you get at some other places).  The coolness of the salad sort of balanced out the warm spiciness of the curry.  I'll be back to try other things on their menu.

My boyfriend's chicken was gross. Chewy, weird, just plain bad flavor. He didn't even finish half, and he was actually hungry. \\n\\nHe also ordered a mojito - it tasted SMOKEY.

The only things left were turkey (which ran out very soon after us) and pulled pork. Obviously waiting in line for half of the day and not getting to try any of your top 3 choices were extremely disappointing. I feel even worse for the dozens of people in line further behind us who will get stuck with nothing. I understand that this is always a risk with barbecue, but it seems like common decency to let people know that things are running out when the line is 3+ hours long, unlike at a restaurant where you come up to the door and are warned that there is very little food left. I know for a fact that Franklin's does this with the line.\\n\\nOtherwise, the turkey was solid, and the pulled pork was absolutely spectacular. It melts in your mouth, and was the best that I've ever had. We also bought a frozen brisket that we warmed up in the oven the next day, and that was incredible as well.

One got the Palermitana and added chicken which was good but \\"redundant\\" in flavoring. \\n\\nOverall, dinner was good, great atmosphere, great service, good prices."},{"name":"Oishi Japanese Fusion","address":"2025 Guadalupe St, Ste 152","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I wholeheartedly agree with the reviews here that this is the best sushi for the price in Austin, which seems to be flooded with high end sushi joints and has limited affordable fresh sushi.  They have a happy hour here that is basically dinner M-F - (5-9pm), that gives you half price on 6-7 different types of rolls, and discounted prices on other rolls and nigiri (yes, they do offer nigiri - I'd recommend the fatty salmon).  We had the spicy salmon, regular salmon, and crunch rolls - thoroughly enjoyed all of it.  It is in Dobie Mall which is on the sw corner of the UT Campus - they have one hour parking in the building.  If I lived in Austin, I would be coming to this place at least once a week.

I ventured out in the slightly misty and cold night and headed towards the food truck.  The truck had some seats for those who dared to stay in the cold to eat.  I walked up to the ordering window, and a nice man took my gyro order and charged me a very affordable $5.  After 5-10 minutes, my food was ready and I ran back to my hotel to scarf it down.\\n\\nThe gyro was *huge* as others have mentioned in reviews past.  Even for a Texan that is used to over-sized everything, this gyro definitely felt huge.  As voracious as I was, I couldn't even finish it.

The not overly creamy sauce had heat to it and was soooo flavorful.  The scallops on my husband's plate were the size of sliders- they were huge and so tender.

After a bit more discussion and a few questions, it was clear that the waiter didn't know the wine list at all.\\n\\nMy 1st course was the beet salad on endive.  Nothing special, and in fact lacked any kind of interesting flavors.  It was quite bland actually.  My wife ordered the mixed green salad.  It was nothing special, and in fact it was clear the greens weren't cleaned (wilted and worse leaves present).  We would not have served a salad of that quality in our own home, and would not expect a restaurant to do so either.\\n\\nMy 2nd course was a farro pasta.  It was pretty good actually.  Flavorful and interesting.  My wife had the Cocoa Tagliatelle with mushrooms.  Again, quite nice, but not exceptional.  My glass of primativo was a very nice complement to it.\\n\\nMy 3rd course was the flourless chocolate cake.  It was ok.  Nothing special.  My wife had the affogato.  It was \\"meh\\".  Barely any gelatto.\\n\\nThe waiter was increasingly absent.  He didn't refill water glasses.  He never offered coffee or an after dinner aperitif.  \\n\\nSo, I think 2 stars is generous.

As I took it from him I could feel the hot grease filling the palm of my hand. HOW LAME. My son drove home and I held the greasy bag and in minutes I had at least a tablespoon of grease in my hand and the cheap bag was collapsing.

I'll never do that again."},{"name":"Assaggio","address":"29 Prince St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"In the past, I have used Yelp only to read reviews. I was like a parasite. I would gather all the info I needed to make a restaurant decision, eat at the restaurant, form an opinion about said restaurant, but never actually write a review about it. However, after realizing that I've now been to Assagio at least 10 times in my life, I felt obligated to review it. Hopefully this marks the changing of the tides for me and next time it won't take double digit visits to persuade me to write a review...\\n\\nPlain and simple: My family and I LOVE this place. We have come here for just about every family celebration and have always had a great time. Most recently we had a great lunch here for my brother's graduation (Tufts 2013!). The food was delicious and they were extremely attentive to a group of around 20 people (not difficult considering we made up 90% of the customer-base at noon but nice nonetheless). \\n\\nOn to the specifics. I'll break this review out into two categories: food and ambiance. \\n\\nFood - Delicious. I have never been disappointed. And don't worry, I won't go back and describe every meal I've had here over the years (not because I don't want to waste your time, I do, but because I simply don't remember all of  them). Moving on to my most recent meal...I had the caprese to start and though it is difficult to screw up three ingredients simply piled on top of one another, they did it right. Beautifully ripe tomatoes, huge chunks of mozzarella, and even a little pesto on top. I usually douse my caprese salad with balsamic vinegar but this required none. Splendid. Then for the main course, I went for the lobster ravioli for the first time ever (first time ever here - don't get your panties in a bunch people). I don't know if it's because I never saw it on the menu or if it was new to the menu, but I couldn't believe I'd never tried this before. Either way, it certainly won't be the last time. It was fantastic. Sometimes lobster ravioli is more lobster puree than lobster meat, and this was not the case at all. There were sizable chunks of claw meat in the ravioli and pieces mixed into the sauce as well. Best lobster ravioli I've ever had. And though I cannot account for a table of 20, those around me were also very satisfied with their meals (mostly pasta). \\n\\nNo comments on the wine or dessert but the dessert in the past has been solid and judging by the number of wine bottles in the basement, I think even a wine connoisseur would be satisfied. \\n\\nAmbiance - Someone described this as the REAL cozy - not crowded cozy - and they couldn't be more accurate. We always try to sit in the basement because it's such a great set up down there. You feel like you are in a wine cellar. They have vines hanging from the ceiling and wine stashed all over the place. It is truly cozy and whether you're there with friends, family or your significant other(s?) you'll be comfortable in this atmosphere. Speaking of significant others...this place is a little off the beaten path (read: Hanover Street) so play it off like this is a hidden gem and you may impress your date. \\n\\nCannot go wrong with Assagio. Best Italian restaurant in the North End!"},{"name":"Smokehouse 21","address":"413 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Our party of four loved this place!

The food was great, I had the Willie Nelson.  I really liked that the bacon was cooked to the side of the beef patty and the barbeque sauce was a nice complement.  I liked the cheese inside the meat but the burger came out so hot (not a bad thing) that the cheese inside was molten and too hot to eat.  The fries were tasty but could have stood to be a little bit crispier. The seasoning on them was really good - a tiny bit of bite and a lot of tang.   I shared the onion rings with my friends and they were the best onion rings that I've had in a long time.  Beer battered, not too big and nicely crunchy.\\nOne big downside to your mom's: Flies.  Most of the seating was outside and even in 92 degree heat, they manage to make it very pleasant on their porch but I could barely enjoy my food because there were so many flies buzzing around, trying to land.

For entrees, we had the candied pork belly, the pork shoulder, and pork butt. ALL pork dishes were delicious and had unique flavors so it was still good to share.

Immediately as in, there was no one else that was in the restaurant nor entered while were there for an hour and a half.  Also of note is that we were there during their 20% off EVERYTHING during happy hour (on a Friday, even).  The location is on a very busy intersection and should have been packed.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is reminiscent of what I imagine a German beer hall to be like before opening for the day.  Clean as far as I could see, with long tables down the middle.  The bar was to the left as you walk in and is in an L-shape.  The height of it is VERY bizarre though.  As you sit, your knees bang against the too low bottom part of the lower part of the bar.  Then there's another level of the bar above you that the bartender stands behind and almost lords over you with their presence.  It's very awkward and painful if you forget your knees.\\n\\nI also want to make a comment on the kitschy sayings all over the place that are obnoxious and not appropriate.  There's an overall feeling of \\"trying too hard\\" and it's off-putting and distracting.  Remove all of the HOPS BOSS sayings all over and annoying \\"drink beer, save water\\" signs and replace them with art.\\n\\nWhile deciding on beverages, we were served with these little bowls of what basically was fried wontons made with their beer and dusted with a seasoning.  This just felt weird, though I did enjoy the seasoning.  I like the idea behind a little snack, but I think there's better choices here.  Even just nuts roasted with that seasoning.\\n\\nLuckily there were only 6 beers on draft and 6 beers included in their \\"meter\\" (flight).  They tout the Reinheitsgebot as a key to their brewing process, but I think they misinterpreted it because they included honey in two of their beers.  The blonde was more weak in flavor than bud light.  The wheat was unpalatable, honestly the worst beer I've ever had.  The porter missed the mark on the SRM completely (it was more red in color) and tasted like light roasted water.  The honey light and dark were muddled in flavor, and tasted more like weak honey than anything close to beer.  The golden was the best out of the bunch, and barely earned a meh.\\n\\nWe ordered food because we need the full experience.  The menu is kind of goofy, with burlap glued around the outside and a little three ring binder inside.  The selection wasn't what I expected, but did include some basic German style items like house-ground sausage (that I ordered), lamb shank (which my friend ordered), potato pancakes (equally shared), and pork schnitzel covered in an onion gravy (pork as the only option and the gravy as an optional add).  There was very little in the way of sides, though I didn't ask if I could swap.  Fried cabbage and potatoes were the only ones offered, and I would prefer a much bigger variety.\\n\\nThe two sausages were the best tasting out of what we ordered, but I feel they need work on the texture (too loose and fall apart when cutting).  The fried cabbage was ok, with great seasoning, but lacking in flavor overall and I could really go for some sauerkraut.  The one schnitzel (just one?) was somehow soggy (maybe serve the gravy on the side?) with little flavor.  The lamb shank was cold and rather small.  The potatoes looked to be thinly sliced and fried, not something I would personally order, but my friend seemed to like them.  There was a mustard served with the dishes, but was forgettable and could have been store-bought.\\n\\nThe brew house (at least as much as we could see) looked to be well maintained and sizable for serving the location.  There were gorgeous copper brew kettles inside and about 7 fermentation vessels.  Unfortunately based on the beer, they are very underutilized.\\n\\nOverall, I feel like they've failed in way too many areas.  They were non-existent in the community before they opened and yet complain no one knows about them.  They have a very high-trafficked location, and are completely empty on a Friday night.  The beer is the worst I've ever had, the food is just ok, and the prices (even after the 20% discount) were not appropriate for what it was.  There is so much potential here, and I'd love the opportunity to eventually update this with a better review."},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"„Éï„É©„É≥„ÇØ„É™„É≥„Éê„Éº„Éô„Ç≠„É•„Éº„Åß‰∏ÄÁ∑í„Å´ÂÉç„ÅÑ„Å¶„ÅÑ„ÅüÊñπÔºàË∫´ÂÜÖ„Åã„ÇÇÔºâ„ÅåÂßã„ÇÅ„Åü„Éê„Éº„Éô„Ç≠„É•„Éº„É¨„Çπ„Éà„É©„É≥„Åß„ÅôÔøΩ?„Åì„Åì„ÇÇ„Åã„Å™„ÇäÁæéÂë≥„Åó„ÅÑ„Åß„Åô„ÄÇÔºíÔºêÔºëÔºî„Å´Ë°å„Å£„ÅüÊôÇ„ÅØÂæÖ„Å°ÊôÇÈñì„ÅåÈï∑„ÅÑ„ÅÆ„ÅßÁÑ°Êñô„Éì„Éº„É´„Çí„ÇÇ„Çâ„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åó„Åü"},{"name":"Rosa Mexicano","address":"155 Seaport Blvd","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Greg is the best and most knowledgeable bar tender ever!

That being said, I've had plenty of outstanding experiences during Boston's Restaurant Week/Dine Out...this was not one of them.\\n\\nI can't complain at all about the service or setting.  The restaurant is in a cute little house in the North End and offers a perfect atmosphere for date night or dinner with close friends.  Our servers insured that we were well tended to throughout the meal, and everyone was very friendly.  The service and physical location brought the place up to three stars; the food though was certainly a disappointment.\\n\\nFirst, the online menu seems unchanged in quite some time.  Their restaurant week menu is no different than their standard menu aside from some restrictions that aren't included in their restaurant week offerings, but very few of the options were listed online.  Between the two of us, we started with appetizers of clams with pasta and baked oysters, entrees of spinach pasta with shrimp and mushroom tortellini, and deserts of panna cotta and blood oranges with mascarpone.  Everything sounded good, but it was all just very mediocre.  The only item that wasn't mediocre was the blood oranges for desert...but that was memorable for the wrong reasons.  They were practically inedible!  Imagine sliced oranges warmed in an oven with a dollop of mascarpone in the center...not a desert I'd ever like to have again.  Everything else, as mentioned, was relatively expected; nothing seemed innovative or even basic but exquisitely executed.\\n\\nOverall, I don't see myself returning here or recommending it to others given the abundance of less expensive, equally appetizing offerings in the area as well as a few standout places nearby.

Now that the weather is finally perking up all I want to do is be outside. Local 7's patio is the perfect place to fulfill this fantasy.

She's attentive, has a great memory, good timing, AND has real, full-on conversations with us every time we're there. We like her so much that I actually don't know much about the rest of the staff. Oops. \\n\\nThe sweet potato fries. Hubba hubba, swoon-tastic, be still my beating heart. They're light and fluffy, but have a great crisp on the outside. The half&half basket (pickles & jalape√±os) is gosh darn good as well. \\n\\nI can't decide if I'm up or down about this, but...the proximity of the train tracks. Woo woo shots (even though they make me cringe) are a plus, but halting our conversations every 20 minutes to wait for a particularly large or loud train to pass by sometimes puts a bit of a damper on our meal. I'm leaving it in the positive section because there's obviously nothing they can do about this one. \\n\\nDownsides: \\n\\nThey seem have a hard time handling some of their weekend nights. We tend to stick to early weekday dinners or oddly-timed weekend lunches because we've had such a hard time getting good service on the weekends. The last time we attempted a Friday date night it took my boyfriend more than 4 attempts to get a beer refill & many more than that to actually put in a food order or get a check. The servers are still decent, just overwhelmed? Understaffed? Sad they're working on a weekend night?\\n\\nBeware, this next part is definitely snobby. I know this, I admit it, I sort of apologize. But I'm a total burger fanatic & I'm incredibly picky about the way my beef is cooked. I am a firm believer in the fact that the temperature of certain beef can change the entire taste of the meal. Since I already know how annoying I am about this (obviously), when I ordered the Hawaiian style burger I tried to make it as clear as possible to our server how I wanted it cooked. Sadly, my \\"warm pink center\\" ended up thoroughly well done and cooked until it was tasteless. It's hard to convey how disappointed I was. I think I'll stick with my BLT&A's from now on. \\n\\nOverall, 3 stars because I like this place & I'll continue to come back, but it doesn't stand out & it doesn't warrant a visit more than once a month.

I ate around it and at the end of the meal told my waitress, hoping to not get charged the extra $5 for it. She insisted on bringing me more, but I was turned off to the shrimp at that point, and wasn't really hungry anymore. We also ordered a pitcher of the blood orange margaritas.  While delicious and strong, we were charged the same price as ordering four individual margaritas.  Everyone knows the point of ordering a pitcher to share is that it's cheaper!

It was served with really tasty black pepper fries and red cabbage slaw. The real stand-out was the dessert, though. I still can't believe the lemon meringue pie was vegan. Seriously mind-blowing!\\n\\nOn my second visit, I had the Reuben sandwich -- so great to have one of my favorite sandwiches veganized. I didn't notice the vegan cheese, though. Not sure if they left it off or if it just didn't have much flavor and I somehow missed it . . . The horseradish Russian mayo was hot but delish. It doesn't exactly create a true Reuben tasting sandwich, but it is still tasty. For dessert, I had a chocolate sundae. Yeah, a freakin chocolate sundae!

I attempted to try them this past Sunday, but little did I know, not only the Wagon, but the entire WORLD apparently turns in early after the sun goes down on a Sunday evening. Oh well. Take two.\\n\\nMe and the manfriend would not be defeated. This time, the Red Wagon was open for business and prayers were answered as we read the words \\"Breakfast All Day\\" on the menu.\\n\\nSittin' pretty on the corner of Hastings, what this little dive spot lacks in decorative pizzaz, it makes up for in other areas. Funky, quirky, diner atmosphere with a laid-back, casual feel and friendly, hipster-folk staff. Choose a table, and then grab your menu and pick your poison.\\n\\nBefore I even read the menu, I was sold on the pulled pork pancakes. Even though my last Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives experience fell short, after seeing it on the show, I was convinced that this one would be a winner. Manfriend orders the pork belly sandwich under my direction, and the waiting begins.\\n\\nFirst bites taken, and there are no words. No sounds at the table, only gestures of amazement and wild looks of disbelief. Three fluffy pancakes layered with tender barbeque pulled pork, and drenched in Jack Daniels maple syrup. Do I really need to say anything more? It sounds a little odd, one of those things that could either go horribly wrong or delightfully right. The syrup is a great creation, the flavour of the Jack really comes through nicely without being too boozey and overpowering. The combination of that and the juicy pulled pork had me saying \\"Wow!\\" from start to finish. This sweet and savoury meal had me in five-star heaven before I even tried the pork belly sandwich.\\n\\nI definitely didn't need to ask how the sandwich was, as clearly my dining partner was in a state of mind-melting awe. All that needs to be known about this one - pork belly. Essentially, bacon cut real thick. In my friends own words, it's greasy, meaty, fatty. This is the way you'll always want to eat your bacon. \\n\\nI may be no food critic, but to me, the cachet of a great meal is not only silence at the table, but a comfortable, satisfied silence on the drive home. For the majority of the trek from Vancouver back to Coquitlam, there were very few words. Silent contentment, food coma, call it what you wish.\\n\\nExcellent, excellent food, and absolutely worth giving that second chance.

I checked my email tonight, I saw the receipt reflected 7 dollars. I did not order any extras. If their menu reflected the price as $7, I would have no problem, still a reasonable price, but the fact that they over charged me and did not show me their iPad screen or ask for a signature is absolutely wrong. In fact, I will more than likely return tomorrow and ask for the difference back.\\n\\nNow as for the food, it was alright. The rice was a bit al dente for my taste. The chunks of lamb were very flavorful, but a few of the larger pieces were a bit pink in the middle (I was unconcerned since lamb is traditionally cooked medium rare) and were tough on the edges like they had been sitting in a warmer for awhile. Not pleasant to get a tough bit that's gritty like sand. I thought the pickled veggies were alright, nice touch for a different flavor and some crunch.The tzatziki (if you can call it that?) had huge chunks of cucumber in it, and did not have that bold, tangy, garlicy flavor I have come to love and expect from that sauce, but it was still good and I smothered everything in it.\\n\\nI would try it again, but be wary of what they are charging you!\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nI went back to the cart to dispute the charge and they told me the extra dollar was a credit card fee. When I tried to argue with it, he claimed \\"everyone knows there is a fee\\" yet he does not have it posted anywhere and I never was allowed to see or sign on the ipad he swiped my card on.

And I had to get a birthday present for a friend of mine. Sonny's BBQ has gift cards available, and my friend and his wife love Sonny's. So this is a no brainer. Buy a gift card, and order lunch at the same time.\\nDianna, who was working the bar, was my server. She got me a gift card and rang up the transaction with my lunch order. A few other patrons came in for lunch, and Dianna served all of her customers in a prompt and friendly manner. It is nice to have great service, especially after going to other restaurants in the area that lack in providing great service. A shout out to Dianna!\\nFor lunch, I ordered the Sliced Pork Sandwich ($6.49) and a side of the Crinkle Cut French Fries ($2.00). And for my beverage, I had the Duke's Cold Nose Brown Ale. This is from Bold City Brewery out of Jacksonville, Florida. www.boldcitybrewery.com. I usually order the Sonny's Red Lager, which is good. But give this a try. And in case you are wondering, Duke's Cold Nose Brown Ale is named after Duke, the brewery owner's late, beloved boxer. Hence the cold nose!\\nOn another visit, I came in here on a Friday evening for dinner, and this place was slammed. People were waiting for a seat in the dining area. I was fortunate to find a seat at the bar and order the All You Can Eat BBQ Sliced Pork ($12.99). Which is great, especially when you put the sliced pork on Sonny's garlic bread and cover it with one of several sauces! \\nThe only problem I had on this visit was the wait time for service. This is not a complaint with the bartender, since he provided great, friendly service to all customers. But for being the only bartender working the bar area, he was quite busy. Not only having to serve every guest at the bar, but also having to make drink orders for the dining area. Several servers helped out by bringing out orders from the kitchen to the guests seated in the bar area and the patio area, but I think that a second person tending the bar area would be helpful.

Just enough for the anonymity that background noise engenders but not overpowering to the point where I couldn't hear my date.\\nNow to the food. For starters we split a delicious caprese salad which came with fresh roasted tomatoes. The lightness and creaminess of the motzarella was a delicious combination. Light enough to where it won't disrupt the appetite for the main course, yet creamy enough to still be satisfying. For the main course I got the Osso Bucco based on both the recommendations here and of our server. It did not disappoint. Tenderly placed atop a medley of roasted potatoes it was easy to tell that it had been cooking for hours. The meat was tender, the sauce deliciously complimentary, and the potatoes the perfect side for such a tasty dish. I highly recommend it.\\nFor dessert we got a tart of some sort, it was a bit sweet for my liking but my date seemed enamored of it.

Place is pretty quiet with dim lighting...definitely a nice place if you want to study and have some dessert in the meantime. \\n\\nThe dessert itself is good...not the best. I've had better but it suffices. Sometimes I question its freshness but for the most part, its good. The staff is pretty laid back and friendly. Sometimes it can take a bit more effort to get someone to help you get a dessert from the display or help at the register. At times, I feel like nobody works there because it seems empty around the cashier area. So you stand there waiting and feeling kind of awkward. \\n\\nOverall, its a nice bakery. Very different from other places I've been. Not the best quality dessert. The atmosphere of the place is pretty chill and its a good place to have some study time or chit chat with friends over dessert and drinks.

I showed up with my date and we asked for a table but when we learned the wait would be an hour, decided to take a chance at the bar.\\nWe probably waited about 10 minutes before a lady came to take our order (chips + guac, a beer and a water)- which was completely fine considering it was a pretty busy Thursday night. I asked if the guac had any gluten in it and she asked what I meant, but listed the ingredients. Gluten-free, awesome!! I asked about the chips which she confirmed were 100% corn. Again, awesome!\\n We then waited over 20 minutes for her to come back with the Corona we'd ordered (no lime), no water, and asking if we wanted to order food..... We reminded her we'd already put in for the guac and that I would LOVE a glass of water. \\n20 minutes more passed and we finally got our water, and she made no mention of the guacamole. We inquired about it again but at this point we knew we should cut our losses. \\n\\nAfter waiting over an hour, we moved from the high top in the bar area, to the actual bar, and were IMMEDIATELY taken care of by an awesome server who completely turned our night around by even bringing us vegetarian menus and letting us know what was or could be made dairy-free. (Yeah, I'm an awful millenial who's allergic to dairy and doing a gluten elimination diet and mostly vegetarian.... So sue me.)\\n\\nThe tacos we ordered were DELICIOUS and the guacamole, when we finally got it, was bomb.

Within our party people had Crazy Alfredo, Sunday Dinner, Carbonara, Spaghetti and Meatballs, Linguine and Clams, etc.  All wonderful.  Nice wine list also.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is just what you would want.  The feel of a small, modern, warm Italian restaurant, with none of the hokey decor or standard fare.  Nick, our server, was excellent.  The chef is a true talent.  The location is also perfect, with Mike's pastry across the street and Modern just a short walk away.  \\n\\nI will definitely be returning to this gem and thank the staff for a wonderful evening at a beautiful and special restaurant.

I decided to give it a shot since I won't be back in Austin again until next year at the earliest. It took about 75 minutes to get to the front door where another sign said the wait inside could be another 45 minutes to an hour and a half! What caused anxiety was when a worker would come outside and place a 'Sold Out' sticker across a particular item on the menu board. The jalapeno sausage was alreadyÔøΩ?sold out when I entered the line. During my wait, both the beef ribs and pork ribs also sold out which elicited groans of despair from some folks around me. Interestingly, they were offering free draft beer inside at the bar so some people went to grab cold ones to bring back while others in the party held their place in the queue.\\n\\nIt took about another 40 minutes of waiting inside before I finally got to the register to place my order. I selected a half pound of brisket, a half pound of turkey and a regular sausage. They quickly placed the meats on butcher paper on top of a cafeteria tray and away I went with my food.\\n\\nThis was certainly the best brisket I had tasted in Austin as it was moist and tender but not too fatty. The turkey skin was nicely spiced, and the meat was not dry at all. For regular sausage, the link certainly had a bit of kick to it which I did not mind one bit, however it made me wonder how spicy their jalapeno sausage tasted?\\n\\nMy one complaint was their setup inside. There were more tip jars (4) at the counter than there were open registers (1) taking barbecue orders. If they could add one or two more cashiers to receive customers, then it would greatly help to shorten the wait which for me lasted just under two hours. Everything was bottlenecked with only one girl taking orders and two guys slicing the meats and preparing the trays. Overall, I would give five stars for the food and three stars for the service because of the wait."},{"name":"Green Lemongrass","address":"1086 Kingsway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I ordered takeaway from here whilst travelling in Vancouver and I was very impressed by the size for the cost.

If you liked the outdoors would you decorate this much with woodland animals and such?  Oh wait, I guess that idea has already been taken.  We had a reservation for a Saturday night at 7pm.  When we arrived the host was nowhere to be found, but the friendly bartendress invited us to hang up our coats and wait.  The host suddenly appeared and couldn't wait to get us to our table.  I had to run after him to let him know that we had a reservation so that he didn't have to keep holding up a table if he thought we were walk-ins.  We were led to a nice corner table with plenty of room, but a waiter was standing in between us and this wonderful dining spot.  Instead of asking the waiter to shift a little to the left, the host led us to another smaller table right between the restrooms and some random door that let in cold air everytime the waitstaff went through it.  The wine menu is more than just a menu - it's an encyclopedia complete with maps and long histories of the wine making process.  I do not like the different glass levels you can order.  Why would anyone want to pay for a sip of wine?  I go to the Sunset in Allston quite a bit and if I would like to try a beer before ordering a whole pint, the nice bartenders pour me a gulp to try.  Our food was delicious (I had the Tuscan Tomato Soup and the Monkfish).  When it came time to order dessert we were informed that the cheesecake was no longer available so the two people who had ordered it at our table were offered the molten chocolate cake instead.  Shortly after, three desserts came out - two cheesecakes and a strawberry millefeuile.  Okay, we ordered four desserts.  We sat and stared at them for a while until someone came by and said that he dropped the desserts off at the wrong table and could he take them back.  What?!!  Good thing we didn't start digging in!  Then we waited about 20 minutes for our desserts.  We informed our waitress that we were delivered desserts that were then taken away just in case she thought we had already been served.  She informed us that it takes a long time for the molten chocolate cake to be made so it would be a little longer.  Thanks for giving us the head's up.

My most recent visit prompted this review not only because the food took so long to make (there was only 2 other people eating there at the time) but they screwed up on my friend's egg order not once but twice. The other 3 people in our party were done eating by the time our friend got his meal. They also didn't comp it or give him his drink for free which most other places would have done. I know they are capable of doing it because I've gotten a free drink when my meal took longer than normal. Anyways, back to this particular meal...The first order came out and the poached eggs were not even recognizable. There were no yolks and it looked like shrivelled egg whites. He sent it back and exchanged his order for chicken and waffles with a side of eggs. Now those fried eggs were even worse looking than the first order. It was fried in butter that already turned brown so they looked unappetizing and was more of a fuck you for sending back the first set of eggs. The waitress should have caught both errors and acknowledged the first set of eggs did not look right so why even bring them out? I also now know the food takes a while to come out and I gave them some slack in the past because they were new.

I have long been searching for such a restaurant in Boston, and I think I may have found it.\\n\\nI have tried a bunch of the different menu items during the two times I've been here, and everything is good. The meal begins with chips and salsa on the table - they had two salsas, a classic pico de gallo style salsa and a creamier/spicy salsa. I loved the creamy salsa. The calimari is a little bit salty, so I ask for a wedge of lemon and squeezed it on top, which makes it perfect. The quesadillas are great, with juicy, oozy cheese and a crispy tortilla. Tacos come in pairs, and are delightfully presented, though the fish tacos were mildly disappointing (try El Pelon nearby for fish tacos). And I tried the steak fajitas one time, which were also quite good. For drinks, they have an extensive margarita menu, and all the drinks I've had were pretty strong and had me buzzing for the night. :)\\n\\nBarrio Cantina is a huge improvement over Happy's, the previous restaurant at this location.

Nevertheless, I waited 45 minutes for an order of Shyamosas, and watched as several people who ordered after me were served first. The employee taking orders was very magnanimous and repeated lines like \\"no microwaves in here!\\" and \\"it'll be worth the wait, I promise,\\" but perhaps should have been focusing more on ensuring orders were going onto the chef's stack in the proper sequence. I was not the only one who asked when my order would be out, nor the only one perturbed that others had skipped me.\\nOnce I finally received my food, it was delicious and ample. $7 for two huge samosas is a great deal, and fed me for both lunch and dinner.

The food, simply put, was delicious.  \\n\\nOther things:\\n- It's interesting to note that I went here and Pittypats within days of each other, and the racial segregation is remarkable...\\n- Even though the peach butter is not peach-flavored butter and more like peach jam, it is still pretty tasty!

I would venture they're the best in the country, but I haven't been to Buffalo so I will reserve that judgment for now.

Sadly, they didn't live up to the hype.\\n\\nAlong with the pulled pork pancakes, I also ordered a smoked salmon omelette, subbing out toast for an english muffin and then a side of sausage. First, the good. The omelette itself was pretty tasty, the bottom was ever so slightly running and didn't feel quite done but that's more of a personal preference on how I'm used to eating omelettes. The english muffin was toasted properly and had a good amount of melted butter on it and the sausage was excellent. Favorite part of the meal was probably the sausage and I would definitely recommend getting a side of that.\\n\\nBut the not so good was the pancakes. The only other pulled pork pancakes I've tried are the ones they serve at Jam Cafe and because that stack was so delicious, I was eager to get a taste of these ones. The pulled pork on it's own was good but the Jack Daniels maple syrup completely ruined the dish because it was so overwhelmingly strong. Even if I were to eat these with regular maple syrup, they still wouldn't of been something I would brag to my friends about. Just a regular stack of buttermilk pancakes, regular pulled pork, and a twist on maple syrup that didn't do anything to elevate the combination. I ended up eating the top pancake and about half of the middle one, then picking out the pulled pork and eating that as well but everything else was too saturated in the JD spiked syrup to eat.\\n\\nIs this place worth stopping by if you're in the area? Yea, I think so. But their twist on pulled pork pancakes is definitely an acquired taste. Maybe some people prefer this version over the ones sold at Jam Cafe but I'm in the group that 100% prefers the Jam Cafe pulled pork pancakes over these ones.\\n\\nOn a final note, we did have the loveliest waiter. She was extremely friendly with lots of smiles which always makes the time at any sit down place more enjoyable. If I ever found myself in the area again and needed some quality food, I would probably eat here again and just try something else, but as it stands, the food just didn't 'wow' me as I thought it would reading through these yelp reviews."},{"name":"Ike's Caf√©","address":"1961 East Mall","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Specifically came to UBC to search for any place that offered the fabled UBC Cinnamon Buns.

I go to Thai restaurants to eat Thai, and Japaneese restaurants to eat Sushi, call me old fashioned but I don't like to mix my ethnic cuisines (especially when they are so different).  The noodle bowls are the thing here, and are quite large.  I enjoy the creamy red curry bowl with tofu and shrimp.  At about $10 this bowl is a bit pricey for my lunch budget, but it is very good.

That was completely inexcusable but that was just the beginning.\\n\\nBurgers arrived and looked and smelled great!

Something tells me they are planted.\\n\\nLet me start by putting it out there; Tucker isn't the restaurant haven like Decatur. I don't expect it to be, but it would be wonderful to have a decent local bar to go to that exudes the flavor of Decatur, Oakhust, or East Atlanta. That being said, the bar isn't set that high to warrant a decent burger, fries and beer. I know I'm not the only one that thinks it would be great for this to be true. There were enough locals there that seemed to be wanting the same as I do, a coolish local pub.\\n\\nPart 1:\\nNeighbor texted me about new place downtown, \\"great we should try it.\\" Not much info in the web, just a local write up about a new place downtown. Went on a Friday night. Place was hopping. No one to meet us at front of house, thought that it was a bit strange, being new and all. Finally got seated, by someone. Waitress was nice, took the drink orders, and they came out soon.\\n\\nWe all took a look at the menu, and thought great, looks like it could be good.\\n\\nSo we all thought, pub food, can't go wrong. Wow, they have tots, always a winner. The waitress took our order. So we got the loaded tots as an app, a tot, brunswick stew and cheese bit. I ordered the fish and chips, others order burgers, etc. A mac and cheese was ordered for the 3yr old.\\n\\nSo about an hour later, no food yet. People all around were getting distressed. I'll give them, the second night thing for the time. More time passed, we did order more beer and got that. The 3yr old was hungry, so her dad had to hike it over to the Burger King to get her something to eat.\\n\\nFinally the tots came out. Looked like a mess. They weren't very hot, and didn't taste very good. It looked like a first grader had took a slice of cheese and tore off bits and threw them on top.They weren't even melted.\\n\\nMeanwhile, during all this time our waitress apologized, but there was no manager, or owner to be seen. Wouldn't you expect on the second night they would be going around checking on customers?

The \\"hand cut fries\\" were burnt tasting, and so soggy with grease that one would of clogged your arteries. The burgers were over done, and a bit on the meatball shaped side. My order of fish was missing, this seemed to be a great mystery.  Well it did finally come out after the waitress had a few words at the kitchen window. Being that the fries were bad, just imaging how bad the fish was. First it was so small, I thought they forgot to put the second piece on there. Second, it wasn't really fried, more like poached in the oil. It had absorbed so much grease that it look liked it was uncooked; it was not white, more like translucent, and definitely not crunchy. The really sad part was the mac and cheese for the 3 year old. It was $5 and very small, like about half a cup size. It was not creamy, like the cheese had been over cooked, and all the oil drained to the bottom. Just nasty. Not even fit for an adult. She didn't even need it after the Burger King.

We did order the bone in filets, medium rare, but the first cut into the meat was well done. We told Christina and she immediately took it back to the kitchen. Then a few minutes later she returned with the steaks completely cut up in bit size pieces and asked if that was the temp of the steak we were looking for. We said yes, so she left the cut up steak on our table and went to the kitchen to get a plate of mushrooms and sauce to go with it. It was very off-putting and pretty distasteful. We spoke to the manager Chadd who was surprised that Christina had behaved this way, and was apologetic. Chadd did have the kitchen remake the filets and sent us home with the kitchen's cut up filets Christina had left on our table. However, I don't think we will go back.

However, the bartenderess could not have been more helpful. She immediately leaped in and gave Ann perfect directions, via my cell, of how to get to Mamma Maria's from exactly where she was lost at (which was Southie...don't ask).\\n\\nBy the time Ann arrived it was 6pm. But, though it was 45 minutes past our reservation, the ma√Ætre Dee (a real good guy) actually held my table (my preferred spot by the window) so Ann and I could enjoy the spectacular sun set view! What a nice gesture!\\n\\nOur Waiter, a bearded gentleman, about 40 years of age, may well have been the best waiter I have ever been served by. He was courteous, helpful, informative, funny, patient, unassuming, and preemptively knew our every need. And best of all: he did not rush us at all! So Anne and I could have our usual HR \\"inside ball\\" conversation completely uninterrupted. Which went something like this:\\n\\nAnn: \\"I am @#$%& dead! I have to hire 50 OTs, PTs and RNs by August! Do you know how hard it is to get good RNs???!!!\\"\\n\\nMe: \\"Umm...well... I have heard of this web site called Monster. Maybe you should try it out?\\"\\n\\nAnn: \\"Smart Ass comments like that is why you're still single Claude!\\"\\n\\nOkay...maybe at that point I kinda wished he did rush us a bit. But all in all, he made our evening a delight and THAT is why I keep coming back to Mamma Maria.\\n\\nBut here is where they REALLY went over board for us:\\nAnn put her BMW with Mamma Maria's Valet parking (a real steal at $18 for the whole evening) But we decided to go for dessert somewhere else in the North End. Ann was amazed that when I asked the ma√Ætre Dee \\"But can we still leave the car with you guys until where done?\\" that he actually said \\"Yes\\" at no extra charge! What other Restaurant in Boston would do that?\\n\\nAll in all: This is why I say Mamma Maria's is the BEST restaurant in Boston.

The menu sounds like it has all of the dishes that we love, but when they come they are not as they would be in Mexico.  Everything has a twist that frankly does not improve on the original dish. I am not saying that the food is bad. The guacamole is great.  We have been using their recipe at home for five years, since we were in New York, and you just can't beat it. Four of us had the guac, the ceviche, and three dishes. The beef short ribs (forgot the name) were really good, the tacos al Pastor were disappointing. Why not put all of the ingredients together like in Mexico? Why big pieces of pineapple on the side instead of combined? And the Enchaladas Suissas again not bad, but not as expected.  In that case I can understand that too much cheese might seem very trendy, but since it is supposed to be a cheese dish, it would seem that it would have more.

I was fully prepared for whatever they had to offer.  Except for the side dishes of nickel and diming.\\n\\nThe sam ros scallop appetizer was pretty good. Scallops were cooked nicely and the sauce set them off well.\\n\\nI ordered the massamun curry and asked if it came with avocado [a common find at inauthentic spots worldwide and something I enjoy]. I was informed avocado was not part of authentic Thai cooking by our white server.\\n\\nHeh.\\n\\nThe curry was way too sweet and there was no heat to speak of.  I would not order this again, even if three luscious avocados sat on its face.\\n\\nPad thai with glass noodles: much better in flavor texture and heat. We enjoyed this the most and it was the only reason we didn't walk away completely starving, after shelling out $40 on lunch.  \\n\\n\\nAnd that's my biggest gripe with Spoon - the reasonably sounding price [$8] is literally only for sauce/curry. Or for noodles.  But then you have to add complements unless you're some kind of sauceatarian abomination, who doesn't require vegetables or protein.\\n\\nThe portions aren't very large and the prices get a little too steep quickly with this complement business.  Tis bullshit, my friends.\\n\\nWith rackets like these, there's no reason to feel bad about ice cream for breakfast."},{"name":"Rosa Mexicano","address":"155 Seaport Blvd","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I loved the ambiance and the location but the wait/logistics were awful! \\n\\nWe arrived a few minutes early for a 7:30 reservation and were told that they were running a little behind but a few tables had their checks and they were going to turn the tables over as quickly as possible.

Chipotle has tasty food, good corporate policies, and everything else. I love Chipotle, and it is one of the only fast food restaurants I ever patronize.\\n\\nThat said, this Chipotle is TERRIBLE. It is the only location within walking distance of my house, and so I drive miles out of the way to visit more suburban Chipotles.\\n\\nWhat is so wrong about this Chipotle? The service. After numerous general minor incidents (extremely sloppy burrito assembly, lax sanitation practices, obvious cross contamination between meat and vegetable ingredients, undercooked chicken [obviously did not order after seeing this], ringing up my order separately from my fiance's and then forcing us to buy our burritos separately- just little things), something finally pushed me over the edge: first, I ordered carnitas and was served steak. I had to argue with the server over what I had ordered for some time before she finally tossed the steak back along with considerable amounts of rice/beans. Then, when I finally had a carnitas burrito with my desired toppings, when she rolled the burrito it split all the way along the side. She simply rolled the foil to cover up all the spillage and passed it down the line. I had to then speak to the manager before they fixed my burrito by adding another (cold) tortilla around the whole mess, without any kind of apology.\\n\\nNeedless to say, this was the messiest and most disgusting burrito I have ever tasted. The service and sanitation at this location are consistently bad, and I would never voluntarily visit this location again. \\n\\nI'm begging you, Chipotle, fix this location so I can walk to your burritos once more!"},{"name":"The Red Wagon","address":"2128 East Hastings Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Stopped by the Red Wagon a month ago and we have already gone back twice. Expect to wait for a few minutes to get a table on the weekends, the location and atmosphere are great. Service has always been friendly and the portions are generous. Free range eggs only cost an extra 50 cents which is well worth it. \\n\\nOn the negative side, watching the staff constantly refilling the coffee machine manually with water and not allowing a full brew on the coffee before serving is a NO NO! Different taste will always throw a customer off if every cup of coffee taste differently. Egg cooking was never consistant on both time we went.

The other HH apps were tasty too - especially the eggplant fries. I didn't like the fried chicken app much because it was crazy sweet (tons of honey sauced all over the plate). I didn't try the tacos but they were reasonably sized for the price ($5 each) given that we were in a crowded sit down restaurant and not at a drive through at a gas station. \\n\\nBecause I'm an absolute glutton when it comes to brussel sprouts, I went whole hog and ordered the brussel caesar as my main. It came with almonds and cranberries and of course, brussel sprouts. These were bigger pieces than in the app. The dressing was fantastic, and the salad was coated with just the right amount of it. \\n\\nWine by the glass was $5 per glass for house white, which was pretty tasty. \\n\\nBig parking lot made getting inside fast to stuff our faces easier."},{"name":"Tamo Bistro & Bar","address":"1 Seaport Ln","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Runs by group of women and they are amazingly talented, very sweet and nice.

Ordered the steak tips Knowing it was sirloin and not rib eye. Plate came out with a bountiful amount of tips. Found it well seasoned and very very good with the rice pilaf.

I'd say use that Open Table app and go for the indoor Salty Sow experience. Oh yes, please. \\n\\nIf you enjoy sharing small plates, you'll enjoy the tweaks they've done recently: On a chilly Sunday night, the two of us shared the $20 four-course prix fixe daily menu, and added an extra app, entr√©e, and the obligatory side of Brussel sprouts, because they're just that good. Seven creative plates for just over $50 is a good deal no matter where you sit, and I hear the Happy Hour menu is even better. Well, sign me up. \\n\\nThe artichoke soup was delicious, and the fris√©e salad superb; the heavily-touted deviled eggs were indeed worth the razzle-dazzle rootin'-tootin'. But the swordfish was a tad overcooked for my liking, and I thought the \\"Candied pork belly\\" was just silly - a goo-encrusted nuclear seasoning bomb that overwhelmed the point of p/b in the first place. You may see it differently. But a big thumbs-up for the polenta, a somewhat quizzical glance at the collard greens, and a solid brownie point for the flourless chocolate cake finish, which was very nice. Our server Alicia was great, new plates and cutlery kept appearing out of nowhere every time we looked up. \\n\\nMaybe it comes down to \\"Where do you go on Sunday Night, Joe?\\" since Sunday can be the hit-or-miss food night in Austin. If the Almighty Himself needs this day for personal time, I won't fault a professional kitchen for closing down and taking their moment either. If you're going to be that Yelper working on a list called \\"Sunday is Funday and the Best Day Ever To Eat,\\" you probably already have Salty Sow pegged and ready to go, and I won't be the one arguing with you.

But I barely remember it. For a Boulderite, I'm sure it's great because where else would you go for Ethiopian in the area? I happen to live where the biggest Ethiopian community outside of Ethiopia is so that's not my situation. What I'm really here to review, though, is not the food so much as the clothes! Yes, they sell them. I like the cotton, so smooth and soft and light, perfect for a summer drive from, say, Boulder to Taos to Espanola, Santa Fe, Roswell, LaMesa and then Austin ... this is the kind of thing you can wear for days on end and still get amazed compliments on how cute you look!\\nI do need to mention the honey wine -- I got the non-Ethiopian one and for me, what a waste of seven bucks that was for one glass! Not sweet the way Ethiopian honey wine is.

Let's just begin by saying I love BBQ and although I definitely appreciate a better built plate of BBQ, I'm also not super hard to please. Give me a bunch of hot meat that isn't dry and tasteless and I'll probably give you three stars without batting a lash. There really isn't any reason this place shouldn't have a five star dining experience. The food is very good, the sides are great, the portions are large, the atmosphere is nice and it's near where I live and work. \\nBut let's talk about the things that at the moment leave me hesitant to return frequently and more likely to drive far out of my way for comparable or even subpar BBQ. \\nFirst, the service is awful. It took me awhile to put my finger on it because like everything else at this place, it SEEMS like it should be better than it is. It just isn't. The guy who greets, takes orders and brings the food has a nasty attitude. It's not in your face nasty, it's more like \\"I'd rather be anywhere but here and you better make this worth my time.\\" I don't appreciate feeling like I'm burdening a person by asking for their service. And believe me, I know both sides of this because I work in food service myself and I understand that some times it just runs you down. I wouldn't have batted a lash if this guy was a bit off his game the one time I went in, but I've felt like I was a pain in his ass he'd rather not deal with each and every time I've come in here, with or without friends. I'm also a fair tipper who believes in tip karma. I don't know if he didn't recognize me or if he didn't care but my initial 25% tip did little to change his attitude towards me and quickly made me hesitant to be so generous in the future. \\n\\nSecond, and this one really bums me out, because I can brush off nasty service for the sake of incredible food, the last time I came in my plate of BBQ was lukewarm at best. We're talking hardly even room temperature. I don't know what it is about a big plate of hot meat that leaves me feeling so satiated but let's just say I left this time feeling a bit blue balled. \\n\\nJust two complaints that have unfortunately made this place less that compelling for me. A bummer because I'd love to fall in love with this restaurant."},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"My wife and I visited Carmelina's for dinner about a week ago.

For the entr√©e I had my favorite Italian dish: Carbonara. The restaurant's version was enjoyable. The pasta was creamy and filled with crispy pancetta. However, the pasta seemed to lack eggs and the noodles were on the soft side (not Al-Dente).

I have had omelets and breakfast sandwiches - both were wonderful (especially if you add that sundried tomato pesto to something).  I have had the club sandwich as well, which is was just \\"eh\\" (that thick tempeh bacon doesn't do anyone any favors - you need some crunch in the sandwich and floppy tempeh bacon isn't getting you there any faster).\\n\\nThey have an incredibly friendly waitstaff - every time.  They also have amazing desserts.  They use Taza chocolate for many desserts, which I love.

I chose pork ribs, brisket, and brisket burnt ends.  As soon as my meal was set on the table in front of me, my first impression was that the meats actually looked kind of dark and dried out.  Unfortunately, that first impression was correct.  The ribs and brisket were very dry. . .no moisture at all.  The brisket burnt ends were probably the only thing that turned out as intended. . .since they are SUPPOSED to be burnt.  Also, everything was extremely SALTY.  There were big white flakes on the meat and I asked the waiter what they were.  He told me they sprinkle Jacobsen Sea Salt and additional dry rub on the meat before serving it.  In fact, as I looked on the menu again, I saw where it says, \\"We proudly finish our dishes with Jacobsen Sea Salt\\".  Well, maybe they should stop doing that, because all that salt actually detracts from the (desirable) smokiness, and it does make the meat way, way, way too salty.  Really, this was not only the saltiest BBQ I've ever had, but probably the saltiest restaurant meal I've ever had, and I am not exaggerating.  I'm so glad there was a jug of drinking water on the table."},{"name":"Athan's Bakery","address":"1621 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"So, this is what I have to say about this place.\\n\\nI think their coffee is mediocre, their wait staff has NEVER been nice to me, almost borderline quite attitude-y and apparently they get mad, if you move the tables around.

This place is really conveniently located across from the T station and is good for all weathers, well except maybe when you're waiting outside for the T, but you can wait inside and see the T approaching and make a run for it and most probably will catch it.  I digress.  \\n\\nEven though my food intake experience here hasn't been THAT positive, I do enjoy the atmosphere at this place and the fact that 10-15 of us have come here twice a month for past few months and everyone else seems to enjoy their hot chocolate or baked goods.  Maybe I am making the mistake of ordering actual food rather than eat the cookies or gelato this place has to offer.  \\n\\nAll in all, I recommend this place for people to go and grab a hot beverage and enjoy conversation with your friends.

I assumed that meant it wasn't offered in the bar so I said I would walk back to the front counter to get my beer. \\nAs I started to walked away to order my beer at the front counter, I heard the bartender say something along the lines of 'the menu is the same.' So I turned around and said, \\"this is the beer they told me I could get up front.\\" His response to that was when I got really put off by the whole experience. He told me that he is the bartender, and they (front counter) didn't know, and that was just how it was (I think he actually said \\"when in doubt, ask the bartender,\\" as if he was the decider of all)... At this point I just wanted a beer, so I ordered the non IPA happy hour beer, a red of some kind I think, and decided to walk back to the front counter to let them know the blonde ale wasn't on happy hour, so no one else got confused like me. \\nThis is the only reason I am giving 3 stars, instead of 2.... Upon me informing the front counter server of the mistake, the server grabbed the manager, he apologized and seemed confused as to why that beer wasn't the happy hour beer, he then offered to get it for me anyway. I already had one beer, and wasn't planning on drinking 2, so I said thanks but no thanks, but still appreciated the gesture.\\nThe decor is industrial and modern, just what you would expect in this neighborhood, and the beer is served in super frosty glasses, and that was lovely. However, it was not my mistake that the two service areas hadn't communicated on the happy hour deals for the day, but the bartender sure made me feel that way.\\nI wanted to like this place, but the attitude presented was \\"the bartenders always right,\\" and as a bartender myself, I know that just isn't true."},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"2855 NE Town Center Dr","city":"Hillsboro","stars":"4","text":"Because of incompetence, you must check your order if you go through the drive thru window.

So let me keep this take on Contigo brief.\\n\\nThe portions were a bit small for my likings, but what I tasted was excellent.\\n\\nThe Ox Tongue Slider was slightly smaller than a normal slider that I expected. The bread was cripsy and the tongue was cooked to perfection. So so juicy. Whoever cooked it, was an expert. Compared to the tongue I had at Salty Sow, I liked this variation at Contigo better.\\n\\nConsider also ordering the Crispy Green Beans for apps. They are awesome! The sambol aioli dipping sauce just takes it to a whole new level!\\n\\nAlso sampled the Rabbit & Dumplings. Everyone seems to recommend this here. Was very pleased with the result. Definitely southern comfort on a cold day. The onions were not overpowering and the carrots were delicious. It really did hit the spot in my tummy.\\n\\nChose to go light with the Spicy watermelon for dessert. Woo, that has a kick when you bite into it.

Okay, I thought, I'll just try back next week.\\n\\nThe next week it happened again.  I got to the food carts, and this time they were at the Northwest Reggae Festival.  Damn it!\\n\\nThe third week we rounded the corner and could hear their generator going, and we were ecstatic.  Finally, we were going to be able to try this cuisine that neither my girlfriend and I had tried before.\\n\\nI proceeded to order the Red Red with jerk fish, and my girlfriend got the Ites Gold and Green plate, also adding the jerk fish.  It was delicious.  The tomato sauce that covered my food was unlike any tomato sauce I'd ever had before.  I was also impressed with the flavor of the faux fish.  While the texture wasn't really there, the flavor seemed dead on, as far as I could remember.  The fried plantains that came with the Red Red were also delicious.  I hadn't had fried plantains before, and the mingling of flavors was amazing.\\n\\nI'll definitely be going back to try more of their food, I'm especially interested in trying the jerk chicken, and if they hadn't had two weeks of not being open, they probably would have gotten that fifth star from me."},{"name":"Your Mom's Burger Bar","address":"1701 E Cesar Chavez St, Ste B","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"After reading all of the reviews I decided to give this place a try.

The kimchi has fish in it, but otherwise everything (including the miso) was veggie friendly. We tried the bibim bop and the dub bop, both with tofu. Bibim bop was very simple cold veggies on a bed of hot rice, very mild flavored but fresh, healthy, and delicious. I personally liked the dub bop better--it was pleasantly spicy but not overly so, and tasted rich and indulgent.

The burgers themselves are made from Angus, so no mystery meat flavor, and the toppings are creative enough. Any burger joint that considers a fried egg to be a topping is in my good graces, let alone put that fried egg on a burger stuffed with chorizo. It all works together too, it's not a bunch of random shit thrown on a burger to catch your interest. \\n\\nThis place does deliver as well, but when I called the driver was out. It still made my day to find out that I can get delivery to Riverside that isn't crap pizza or crap chinese food. This place is already a rare gem for being on east cesar chavez and not being a taqueria.\\n\\nDelivery aside, I would definitely call in your order ahead of time unless you've got time to kill. The wait for your food is interminable. I'm sure this has to do with the fact that the burgers are stuffed. Order some fries (they're extra) for the wait and god help you if it's busy.

I'm not saying it was bad, but it didn't work for what I was doing.  I'm not sure the guy really even cared what he sold me.  There's got to be a better source of fresh local bread out there.\\n\\nOn a positive note, the sweets and desserts were very good.  They have a great selection that makes it difficult to try just one thing.

The Melomakarona (the honey/walnut cookies) I've found to be a little too dry. I can honestly say I've never been disappointed with their gelato. And unfortunately, their beautiful colorful desserts in the glass case near the register are no where near as good as they look.(Just tonight I tried a piece of the CItron cake and a friend had the heart-shaped Sara cake...sad to say, the cake components of our dessert were dried out. This resulted in what we both agreed was a gritty texture in our mouths. Yuck!)

Almost without fail it is always packed and not only do I begin feeling bad for keeping others from a table by staying so long in my attempt to get work done, but sometimes the chatter gets so loud I can't come anywhere near being able to focus. If you find these kinds of things don't bother you then you might find it an okay study place.

I have lived and worked in the Commercial Drive area for 17 years, and I also lived in Thailand for 2 years before that, so know what Thai flavours are meant to taste like.    Over a decade ago after the name changed from Thai Away Home to Take Thai Home, the quality plummeted and stayed that way, with quite a consistent mediocre set of dishes over the years, until. . . . well, until tonight!    Very occasionally I would order take-out there, not because I expected great things, but because I was tired of other things, and so tonight, seeing an expanded menu, and ordering with three others at our table, I was quite pleased with the offerings of the new Thai-speaking crew in the kitchen.  I would concur with another yelp reviewer:  these flavours rank among the top in the city.     We had the satay, the mixed veggie salad, royal pad thai, green curry, and thai fried rice.  All were excellent:   well balanced flavours, decent portions, authentically Thai.  \\nMy 5-star review is based on the food quality.

The meat is tender, full of flavor, and not overly salted.  It has the right smokiness, not nauseating.  Sometimes pitmasters oversmoke and it really takes away from the flavor.  Their meat is also not as fatty as many places you come across.  Brendan knows what he's doing back there and it shows. There is a method behind the madness in the family history of course but they really have created their own brand.  \\n\\nI definitely recommend the sausage and brisket.  Both are up there with the best of the best.  If you want to keep it simple, you can't go wrong with the Sancho Loco.  It's an inexpensive filling sandwich that gives you all of the flavors.  If you are a first timer, it is a write of passage to order a beef rib.  Get your cameras ready to roll as you effortlessly pull the bone right out of the meat! \\n\\nAll in all, the place is meat-sweat heaven and its a fun spot to check out.  I love their new spot, it is comfortable and welcoming.

I ordered a hot turkey w/ white american cheese and pretty much all the veggies. i turned down the oil and oregano mxture they use, and the guy just gave me the \\"c'mon man\\" look, and i said \\"sure, go for it. youre the professional.\\" and man, im glad i did. That was probaby one of the best sandwiches ive ever had. I was impressed by three things....customer service, quality of ingredients, and how it was prepped. I know this sounds trivial, but they use those thin sliced clausen pickles, instead of those cheap \\"million to a jar\\" pickles subway uses. they were crisp, and had a crunch to them, they werent soggy like cheap pickles. they use high quality meats, and its cooked (yes, i said COOKED) on their grill. unlike other sub shops, that just toast it. trust me it makes a difference.

My fianc√© and I have been ordering from Big A for the last 7+ years with no complaints until recently. The last year has been a disaster. Every time we order, EVERY TIME, there is a mistake. Order is never right. We explain what we want, several times, and it's never right. We're not ordering anything out of the ordinary. I typically get a roasted mellanzana wrap (not sure if I spelt that right) and he gets a cheese pizza. Then of course drinks. How can this get messed up? 9 times out of 10 the drink never gets delivered. They have to go back to get the drink, which by the time we get it, a full hour or longer has gone by. Or if we get a drink, it's the wrong drink. The wrap I get, I order extra dressing on the side. We're asked repeatedly what dressing, we say what dressing, and we end up with a completely different type of dressing (As far as I remember, the menu in the restaurant actually lists the dressing in the wrap. All they have to do is turn around and take a look). The pizza tastes like something that came from the frozen section of a grocery store. My fianc√© enjoys it so that's all on him. I'm honestly not one to complain about service, and tend to avoid confrontation, but there was a time I had to call and complain because enough was enough. We continue to get this restaurant chances because we've been customers for such a long time, but the only way we can be sure the order is correct is going to pick up our order ourselves and checking before going home.  Maybe they need to hire someone reliable taking the orders on the phone.

For instance, one of their chile rellenos is a black bean and cheese stuffed pepper, which sounds plain, but it's covered in a roasted avocado leaf sauce which makes it amazing. Trust the chef.

On the expensive end but quality shows. The menu changes daily so don't expect the website to have the most up to date offerings.  As a table we had everything from the scallops to the black bass. Surprisingly, there weren't too many options for pasta given it was an Italian restaurant. Many meat options for entrees. And surprisingly only 1 salad option as an appetizer. Still, from what I tried, the bass was fantastic and blackened/charred. The scallops were a little sweet but overall very tasty with a move pasta bottom. The tartare was subpar, served over a bed of cucumber that honestly overpowered the beef.  Drinks were great but cocktail list was on the small end and seemed more gin concentrated. Mamma Maria is one of the best in the North End. But also one of the more expensive.

She suggested The Fours in Norwell and since it had been awhile since I've been to this particular location... I figured, why not.  There is a lot of free parking and the restaurant looks well maintained from the outside.  I was early and I had no problem getting a table for the two of us and grabbing a drink while I waited for her.\\n\\nOur server was extremely efficient, if not borderline overbearing.  My friend barely slid in her seat before he was standing over us, \\"What would you like to drink?\\"  When I put my finger on the menu, he was ninja-like in getting over to our table, \\"What would you like for dinner?\\"  I appreciate good service, but even I know when to back off.\\n\\nAt any rate... we split the potato skins appetizer which was grossly disappointing.  Halved potatoes topped with cheese and they looked nearly fried (very dark brown and crispy) with about a tablespoon of bacon bits on top.  \\n\\nShe ordered a caesar salad with steak and I had the chicken caesar wrap that came with roasted red peppers and fries.  Sandwiches are also served with a cup of baked beans, too.  Not sure if I necessarily get it, but whatever.\\n\\nThe food was very status-quo.  There was nothing special to it and certainly no outstanding flavor.  Between the two of us and two sodas, our bill was $43 with taxes, so it was just over $50 with tip.

But if you are in Central Square and in the mood for all the chicken tikka masala you can eat, this might not be a bad choice. (And you have choices... four of them best I can tell. We've been to Shalimar, Gandhi and India Pavilion and will check out Desi Dhaba soon.)\\n\\nMore than many of their competitors in Cambridge, India Pavilion feels like an Indian restaurant. It has a well-lit atmosphere and Indian music playing at just the right volume. The shape of the place is odd... I didn't even realize there was a whole other side until we were on the way out. As a result, it feels cozy, but can actually seat quite a few people.\\n\\nThe buffet was pretty standard... plain rice, naan (in the buffet), some pretty salty veggie pakoras and five main dishes. I used to think that five was on the low side, but I've come to accept it as the standard, and am happy as long as they taste good.\\n\\nThe saag (no paneer) was pretty bland, but for some reason I liked it. I still think Shalimar's is the best, and if you love saag, go there instead. The aloo mutter (potato and pea curry) was really good, however, as was the navratan korma. I got seconds of both of those dishes. The chicken tikka masala and tandoori chicken were both middle-of-the-road for Cambridge, which is to say that they were pretty good.\\n\\nThey also had the four standard sauces/chutneys (mint,sweet,onions,yogurt) and a box of lettuce and tomatoes. No full salad bar here and no extras like soup or chai tea.\\n\\nThe rice pudding was pretty good. Not the best we've had, but flavorful, a little runny, but not too bad.\\n\\nService was very good with water refills and keeping the food in the buffet fresh and restocked frequently.\\n\\nThat's about all I can say. India Pavilion didn't wow us, but they did everything fairly well. For the price of $6.95 I it's a good choice in the Central Square area.

The biggest part that attributes to the lower rating is that their waffle is not that buttery and the syrup is not good. I prefer the Hungry Jack to it.

They attempted to cover up the \\"spoiled\\" taste with heavy seasoning but it didn't work.  My taste buds and palette are pretty refined so I easily knew they weren't fresh and there was no way I was going to risk getting sick over bad seafood.  At any rate, I sent them back and ended up ordering fried shrimp.  The shrimp was nothing to write home about at that point my appetite had waned.

I wasn't aware that the only option was the BBQ buffet or Shrimp/Fish stew +buffet, generally speaking I avoid any establishment where buffet is the only choice (hey now I know). \\n\\nEverything started out okay and slowly went downhill. First, the buffet was sketchy(strange objects in the various beans) and everything was mostly bland, the only redeeming items included the meatballs and plantains. After getting a plate of food to supplement the parade of meats that was about to ensued I noted all the cool things people said they tried from yelp(chicken hearts, etc). Unfortunately, I had no such luck, as I think it was likely a weekend thing.\\n\\nOn to the meat! From memory the parade went something like this.. Bacon-wrapped Chicken (skipped - looked really dry, Luke didn't seem to care for it), \\nsteak tips (not terrible but a bit tough, 2.5 stars),\\nroast beef (one of the better items, 3 stars), \\npork (super dry, could be used for kindling, 1 star), \\nKielbasa (nothing special, 2.5 stars, jimmy dean could give it a run for it's money), \\nChorizo  (3 stars, slightly better than the kielbasa), \\nshort-ribs (1.5 stars, all fat and gristle), \\nLamb ( 3.5 stars, good flavor but surprisingly fatty). \\n\\nI have to hand it to Ryan C for summing it up nicely- \\"I wouldn't return if you paid me. Fatty meat, poor service, and nothing of taste\\" (spot-on). It looks as if the business model is to over-charge for D and E quality meats, recycle meat bones and fat into the beans, under-staff and seriously over charge for beverages.\\n\\nI think I could have forgave the quality of the buffet and meat parade, but the poor service has put the kabash on me ever wanting to return. I was really heated when I sat for an inordinate amount of time waiting (more than 10-15 minutes) for a refill on my warm, overly syrup-y soda, only to find out I was charge almost $4 each.

Our entire dinner lasted two and a half hours - it took about a half hour for our first course to arrive (a cheese plate and a meat plate) - both were delicious, but clearly shouldn't take that long to prepare.  Appetizers were then another 20 minute wait after our first course had been cleared.  Once the appetizers were cleared we waited ANOTHER half hour for the main courses.  \\n\\nAfter each course the plates were cleared promptly...and we were just left sitting.

It's a sad thing when it's prepared badly. This, however, was nothing short of amazing.

Sometimes the music is too loud for my taste, but it's very hipster and family friendly, so I keep returning. I think the only thing to remember is to make sure you ask the server to tell the cook how well done you like your meats, b/c sometimes the bacon comes out cold and too crispy, and there's so little of it, which I hate at breakfast places.

It's obviously not a gourmet place - but it's good food.\\n\\nWe ordered in and picked up food on Friday for ourselves and 2 friends. He and I decided to try the Siamese Peking Ravioli - we got them fried and it was 7 very small dumplings. Very tasty, but a very small portion (we are used to Chinese restaurant dumplings - 8 large ones). We also shared our standard Chicken Pad Thai, which was very good, albeit a bit drier than we would like. When I first started getting Pad Thai, it always came with a lime. I am now used to that and forgot to ask for one - that definitely would have helped the dryness (we didn't use the chili sauce that comes with it, but my friend did and still said it was dry).\\n\\nSaid friend got Shrimp Pad Thai and our other friend got the  Golden Shrimp - Shrimp sauteed with Ginger, Mushrooms, Onion, Curry Powder, Scallion, and Baby Corn. She got brown rice with it. It looked and smelled awesome, but since I don't eat shrimp, I wasn't able to taste it.\\n\\nSince this location is walking distance from our place, we will definitely be going again.

Seemed like precooked frozen meat that they ran under the water and then microwaved really quick.The beef tasted like it had been marinated in kitchen cleaners, like Lysol or something. They use to have pretty good fajitas but clearly their standards have changed. Tried their new spinach queso as well. You shouldn't call it \\"spinach\\" queso if there's one piece of spinach in it, and the cheese they use tastes like dirty feet have been soaking in it. Also, the air conditioning was out. It's 100 outside. They didn't even have a sign up informing of that or inform you as you enter.

Primal instinct took over.\\n\\nI have to agree...you can't beat the price. However, with 9 interior stations with 8-12 different dishes then the sushi bar, hibachi grill and noodle station - that's a selection around 70+ dishes. You would THINK there's some decent edible resemblance of fine cuisine. NOT!!\\n\\nWild Rice is a feeding trough for the touristy or the low budget local. Where else can you go for $10 and feed on raw oysters, shrimp, crawfish, rubbery sushi, etc... I tried basically 1 small bite of sushi,salad, fruits, noodles, hibachi and different meats. There's nothing to resemble fine dining. I tried...\\n\\nI'll give them credit b/c they try. But this is the epitome of Americans gone bad. Large quantities to fill the obese bodies of the clientele.

Very simple decor. \\n\\nOur order: With the $7.50 charge in mind, we ended up ordering the pumpkin ravioli appetizer with the pesto gnocchi entree. The made in-house gnocchi alone would have been plenty, but it seemed silly to pay $7.50 and get nothing else. The ravioli was delicious - it almost could have been called a dessert with the sweet flavors and hints of cinnamon. As for the gnocchi, it was on the meh side of things. Knowing what it costs to create an Italian dish and even a homemade pasta one at that - it seemed on the high end for price and low end for flavor. \\n\\nNot the worst experience --- probably not a spot I'll be running back to anytime soon."},{"name":"Grand Chinatown","address":"21 Billings Rd","city":"Quincy","stars":"2.5","text":"I've came here several times with family and friends.

I've been to some carts around here that reheat food in microwaves, and it was super cool to know my food was being made fresh in a clean and inviting cart.\\n\\nNow onto the review. Wow, that's a lot of food! It had to have been more than two pounds. I think the two flat bread wraps that you can get for $5-8 (depending on filling) will be enough for two of my lunches. My wife, and also our vegan housemate agreed that the mushroom and lentil fritter with the creamy-tomato based curry was seriously delicious, way too much flavor for our toddler. Ha! The panfried noodles were good, but less flavor because I think they're sauced differently than when you get the other bases. I can tell the noodles are probably not the base that I'll go for again because I really want the most intense flavors this place can dish out. But based on other reviews, the noodles might be a different recipe when combined with another topper like the curried beans. Those two dishes were enough for one adult lunch (full to the point of needing a nap) and then two adult dinners. I can't wait to try everything else on the menu, really. The tropical breeze curry sounds so intense, the pressure cooked curried lamb must be good, and I'll be trying the soups too.\\n\\nThe owner is a lovely person, and I really liked that he says he's \\"allergic to cooking books\\".

It is hard to serve me too much garlic but this pushed my limits and slightly overshadowed the more subtle fungi.  The scarpetta was enjoyable. \\n\\nOur secondo was 6-7 oz.

First of all you don't have enough parking for your employees or your customers even after you paved your parking lot. As a resident we only have access to the street parking after 10:00pm 7 days a week, 365 days a year. We pay rent and we can't have parties or invite people over because they will have to park all the way over by Alamo recreation center. We pay rent. This is so..... Inconsiderate and unfair. I live in a duplex and the other resident a disabled man in a wheelchair has the misfortune of living in the alley that separates him and the little house the Salty Sow owns next to their restaurant. He has endured so... Much. Your employees take their smoke breaks in the alley by his driveway so when he opens his door he smells cigarette smoke. He is not a smoker. I love @ the hose on the corner and I have come out of my house to fine your employee, the white mail with dark hair sitting in the ledge outside of my home smoking and drinking his star bucks( the one who drives the tan 4 door sedan). I asked him could he smoke somewhere else. He hurriedly went to his car, put on his work jacket and went to work. How come they can't PAY to park @ the lot across from you restaurant. How come they don't smoke by your outdoor area designated by for your customers. I'm sure they wouldn't like it and we residents don't like it either. My poor disabled neighbor injures the smoke, the power washing, and leaf blowing during the week during the day from 8:30am in the morning until you open @ 4:30 pm. My neighbor has told me that he has watched the Hispanic employees blow leaves into his front yard. How rude and inconsiderate. He is in a wheelchair, he can't sweep, rake , or pick up leaves. I see these guys everyday. They park by my house early(8:30am) in nice sports cars one yellow one and one silver one. They chill in their cars before they report to work W/ music playing so... Loud( oh, I forgot to tell you, the car windows are rolled up) I have to come outside and asked them to turn down there music, that I can hear it inside my home, they always say, sorry, sorry but they continue to do it. I have come out 3 times for this, biggest problem is being able to put out our garbage, recycling, and compost cans. I put out my cans and my neighborscans since he is disabled. And I have to play the babysitting me and my neighbors garbage cans. I have spoken to so many managers @ salty Sow and the City of Austin solid waste department but no one can help us. We call 311 and when they come out they seem more annoyed that we called, therefore they can't be of much and have been absolutely no help because it's not a police matter. Why should we put our cans OFF THE CURB, for the thiousandth time Salty Sow The City of Austin WILL NOT pick up are garbage, recycling, or compost if they are ON THE CURB. My poor neighbor has had his garbage not taken so... Many time since you Salty Sow have been open and the 1st question that 311 asks is did you have your cans out by 6:30am on Friday morning our regular trash day. Our cans our always out either on late(after 10:00pm when you close) Wednesday or early Thursday Morning (7:00am) I have to try to get the cans out before the UT Plant workers, students and the AM Salty Sow workers who prepare the restaurant for the 4:30pm opening. Well tell me why your employees and customers repeatedly move our cans so they can park their cars? It would be ok if they would put them back but they NEVER DO!! How rude and inconsiderate!! Who gives you all the right to touch our garbage cans? You ought to watch Judge Judy. She made a women pay another women $2000 for moving the other women's garbage cans so she could park in that spot. Judge Judy told that lady,\\"you have no business touching that women's garbage can, and your going to pay! We feel so disappointed, disrespected, and defeated. I have spent thousand of hours o the phone with 311 but I hVe yet to get some REAL HELP. Why can't we get the sme help that I afforded to Zilker Park, west lake, or West Austin? We pay taxes just like they do. And lastly Salty Sow, an employee shared some disturbing information with me about you while I was sitting on my porch on a nice day during the holiday's. It solved a mystery for me. He even went as far as to say that we should call 311 and say that we believe that Salty Sow is involved in illegal activity so that the health department can come out and investigate you. That person said that your employees poor their mop water down the sidewalk on Poquito St. He also said that your grease is coming down that same sidewalk. That explains why our leaves are always wet W/ a dark black slime,and an absolutely putrid  smell. Someone blew all of those filthy leaves and power washed the sidewalk over the holidays."},{"name":"Fresh To Order","address":"One Cnn Ctr, Ste 220","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"4 star fast food.

I guess I'm glad we got a lot of pretty good-tasting taro, but the bowl was under-salted and not as fun as a taro weave.

I'd rather have that than the waiter that disappears for an hour but we were there celebrating my birthday and if they weren't filling up our 3/4 full waters (whyyyyyyy?), they were checking in every 4 minutes about ordering/how's the food/can I get you anything else. It was a bit much. Didn't allow for a nice, relaxing conversation is all I'm saying. Pick your battles, I guess.\\n\\nDecor - they have some really fun and quirky art pieces on the walls made mostly with wine accessories (corkscrews and whatnot). The only thing it was missing was some of those acoustic boards. You can kind of hear E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G everyone is saying since there's really nothing to absorb some of that sound.\\n\\nThe food though! Oh my gosh. So we started off with the soup special of the day which was corn butternut squash bisque topped with a nice aioli. Good heavens!! We shared the bowl and I'd be lying if I said I didn't wish we would have gotten our own. Yowza. We also got the mozzarella heirloom tomato appetizer. It came with a little bit of fresh basil and charred toast - TO DIE FOR. Those tomatoes...I'll dream about them forever. For an entree I got the handmade potato gnocchi with pears, gorgonzola and almonds and I added sausage. The sausage I didn't care for - I think it had fennel seeds and I can't stand them - but I won't count it against the dish as a whole. The original dish by itself without the sausage was divine. The gnocchi was the perfect texture; just soft and chewy enough without being mushy and falling apart. I just really really liked it. The boyfriend got the seafood stew - a bouillabasse. The flavor was good but there were a few things that just weren't...great. The mussels were grainy and very tough, and the scallops were a bit rubbery. Obviously stewed seafood is going to be different than a seared scallop but it was a little off-putting.\\n\\nLastly - and this is the thing that really burst my bubble - was that when I asked for a box for the 1/2 of my meal that I couldn't finish, they took my plate away (I assumed to box it up in the back) BUT THEY NEVER BROUGHT IT BACK. We didn't realize until we were half way home. Oh come on. We're not the only ones ever to have forgotten our leftovers, right?! But seriously!! That was a $21 meal that I wasn't able to finish because no one ever came back. GAAAAHHHH. I probably should have called but I felt dumb for not remembering to ask before we left.

However, their capreze salad was a standout, with some of the freshest, soft mozzarella I had ever had.  This was my favorite dish.  Also, my lump crab spaghetti was outstanding.  It was served tossed with olive oil so the flavor of the crab stood out.  Finally, their after dinner coffee was outstanding.  Not sure if it was Illy or not but it was certainly from a French press.  Definitely a high quality meal overall.  1  1/2 Star.\\n\\nWill I Return? - Yes.  Lupo is a phenomenal fine dining experience.  While it's pricy, you're guaranteed to have a great meal from start to finish along with outstanding service.  1 Star.\\n\\nMy Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):\\n1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.\\n1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.\\n2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.\\n1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. \\n\\nEach Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score"},{"name":"Rocanini Coffee Roasters","address":"115-3900 Moncton Street, Steveston","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Cool place in Steveston for a coffee.

Plus, the menu appeared to offer some foods that other restaurants lacked in.\\n\\nFor RW, Casablanca is a fabulous choice!  The portions actually filled me up versus other restaurants, like Rialto which completely leave you hungry after restaurant week, and I ate foods that tasted AMAZING.  One thing that I would note, is that the appearance of the food on the plate doesn't necessarily look ... pretty, but the taste, quality, and cooking far outweigh the look on the plate.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere is cool in Casablanca.

One was a bit more fatty than the other, but the flavors were awesome.  These were matched with couscous in what tasted like a porcini broth and wilted greens.  Yum!\\nDESSERT Almond blancmange?:  almond-flavored flan-like pudding, creamy and rich with a strawberry, apricot sauce?  super rich, and too creamy for my tummy.  But elegant!\\n\\nWINE  Malbec: red wine from Chile or Argentina...I can't remember which.  But it went perfectly with the meal and tasted smooth and sweet and was light on tannins and high in alcohol (14%).  \\n\\nBEER  Wolaver's Organic Brown Ale (draft):  so smooth and sweet and delicious.

The restaurant is pretty small (but more tables than Daily Catch next door) and their biggest table can only seat 6. \\n\\nThe menu has dozens of appetizers, pasta dishes, and main dishes to choose from. With four of us, we ordered pasta dishes such as Sunday Macaroni (one of their most popular dishes), the Crazy Alfredo, Spaghetti with Clams, and more. The Sunday Macaroni was a lot to the point where I ended up taking 2/3 of it home due to the amount of meatballs, sausage, and the beef rib they included with the pasta. However, my personal favorite of the dishes we had was the Crazy Alfredo, personally since I thought the spicy alfredo sauce that was used in this dish was rich in flavor, was unique, and was not heavy in cream.\\n\\nI highly recommend coming to Carmelina's if you are in North End looking for great Italian food.

It's a 1/2 lb burger stuffed (YES, all burgers come with the cheese STUFFED!) with American cheese and topped with lettuce, tomato, onions and mayo on a toasted bun.  For my side, I choose the OHH!! rings, which are basically just beer battered onion rings with a cheeky name for good measure.  \\n\\nI really hope my dad never reads this because he prides himself on making a mean burger in the backyard, but, sorry pops, this place has you beat.   I've never had a better burger in Austin, maybe in my life, than the one I had here. I'm contemplating going back right now as I write this. And I'm not even a big burger person. The 100% Angus beef is cooked to perfection, not too raw or too done, juicy and the cheese takes it over the top.  The toppings are fresh and, along with the toasted bun, compliments the meat without distracting in the slightest. HEAVENLY.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that the service is kind of slow and we had some problems getting our sides but I'll give them a pass because they're fairly new and I'm hopeful that these kinks will be ironed out as time goes by.

The pork ribs, pulled pork and turkey were also on an above par level compared to most I've had throughout the region. The BIG and I mean BIG Beef Ribs are amazing and as moist as the brisket. The meat slid off the bone as nicely as a dress off a woman. Yes, I'm getting  little R-Rated here! The flavors were intense with a combo of just the right amount of salt and pepper, with deep smoked flavors only brought on by Texas Oak. What I loved was the convenience! I got there about 10 minutes after they opened and was treating my food soul to great barbecue within 45-minutes. That's not a tough wait compared to other joints here in the ATX.

When we used to live in Medford, we would travel all the way there at least once a week just to get their food. The service was good then until this petite lady showed up. At first I just didn't understand why she acted so rude towards us. But then when I heard her having a confrontation with a man customer who was obviously confused but was it the right way to approach him?  And then we haven't been back, we just got busy. But one day our family was in town and wanted Thai so we brought them there. I haven't seen them in awhile, and they know us as regulars. And it was really nice to be met with a question \\"youre pregnant?\\" when you are not. So I ignored it, some people just dont know anything about being tactful and respectful. I feel like she is the version of the soup nazi in Jerry seinfeld's. If we didnt like their food, I would never go back there. But then again, there are other thai places around. The last time we went there, she wasnt there at all and boy did I feel relieved.\\n\\nTheir food is really great and the service is fast. they only accept cash but if you dont have any, they have an atm inside the place. The other people are very friendly, completely the opposite from this petite lady. The only bummer thing sometimes is that, I bring my family sometimes 7 or 8 of us and we spend so much money in there and we can only eat in styro plates. We've been use to it by now but if you have to cut something, be wary as to you can cut through the plate and have your food leaking out.\\n\\nOur favorites are tom yum soup, my toddlers favorite is vegetable and tofu soup, Ka Na Moo Krob, Panang, the pad thai is worth driving to, I think their pad thai is the best around town. Their Bangkok duck is one of our favorites, its crispy and the sauce is a tad sweet and soy and really yummy, The whole fish with chili sauce which we order on the side, because my toddler cant handle the heat but loves the fish is amazing too. The Pad see you is also delicious. But dont just over fill yourselves yet...the thai donuts are really worth ordering after your meal.

Based off two factors, prior experiences and locations. Therefore I was thinking this would be about the same as those two others.\\n\\nMy first time ever at a P.F. Chang's was the Easton location and didn't like whatever chicken entree I had ordered at the time then the second time was in West Chester, Ohio by the Rave and that one just tasted like rubber. So you can imagine I have two very bad experiences and get asked by friends if we want to meet here and I'm thinking in my head (what the heck, these people must have really bad taste in food). \\n\\nWe arrive to the restaurant and I don't have an issue with the image, it's always good, nice and clean. Service is okay for a higher than average price Chinese restaurant. So when I came in last night, I pretended to have never eaten here before even though I've experienced it twice and both bad experiences. I came in with open perspective I guess, no speculating anything. \\n\\nMy friends and I ordered the appetizers, sushi rolls, dumplings and hot and sour soup to share. Then we got the main entree and inside (not showing it outside expression) I was like God help me that's where every restaurant tends to make the mistake. So as you can imagine I placed a very heavy burden on this location for the quality of their main entree dish because I was not pleased with their other locations. \\n\\nI received the main entree and it's cooked to perfection and I have no issues with it because it actually tastes normal this time. It's cooked better and the cook actually took their time to make the meal good for each of us. This was really the deal breaker if I would ever show up to a P.F. Chang's location again because really who wants to experience bad food? Though I didn't this time and that was good. \\n\\nThanks P.F. Chang's for taking the time to thoroughly cook the main entrees at this location. Maybe you can teach a thing or two to the Easton and West Chester, Ohio locations on quality. Especially your West Chester branch, I'm sorry but that location made me sick. Good job, Tuttle Crossing P.F.

We found both excellent, but I was really taken by the French toast myself. The sides or even better. The fried home fried with aioli and scallions was very good.

This is hands-down the best breakfast place I know in Beaverton or Portland: their portions and prices are amazing, the servers are so friendly and positive, and their omelettes just can't be beat. For $9.85 I get an ENORMOUS omelette stuffed with onions, peppers, chicken, beef, sour cream, salsa and pepperjack cheese, a side of seasoned red potatoes, and English muffins with a side of deliciously thick, warm sausage gravy. It's easily two meals, sometimes three, and my colleagues are always envious when I bring my amazing leftovers to lunch. The CD Scramble (formerly called Carma's Scramble) is a delicious blend as well, and better for those who favour lighter meals.\\n\\nYes, the atmosphere is ordinary or downright plain. They're definitely not selling you an interesting environment. But it's bright, airy, open and clean, and what more could you want for breakfast?\\n\\nNo, it's not for health fanatics.

But man, your tastebuds will dance in delight if you give in to the temptation.\\n\\nYes, Bruce's direct, familiar humour can take some definite getting used to, but it's all harmless ribbing.

Michelle was skilled and patient with some of the fussbuckets in my group; some of them requested side dish substitutions which were honored. My friend's husband always orders this drink that no one has ever heard of but him, and they were kind enough to indulge him and make it, and from what I understood did that well.  My zucchini blossom appetizer was nice, and my chicken with Brussels sprouts was tasty as well.  I tried my boyfriend's pork dish which was delicious.
