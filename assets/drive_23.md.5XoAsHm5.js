Is this location even part of the brand? \\n\\nWe went before a concert and every place in Kenmore was over an hour wait. I separated from the group to find anyplace to sit and eat. I strolled into Bertuccis and I'd say the place was dead. At least 10 tables open. However when I asked for a table for 6, the panic began. I followed the 'hostess' to 2 tables back to back that would work fine since they didn't have any tables for more than 4. I should have known by the fact that one of the two tables back to back was full of dirty dishes, almost as if every server for the last 2 hours put all their direct dishes on the table in the booth. Hilarious. Regardless, the hostess told me it would be cleaned in 5 minutes. I went outside grabbed the group and we went in and sat down. \\n\\nWe sat for 10 minutes before the plump sweaty week old waiter came over and told us he'd be back in 1 minute. 10 minutes later he came over to sweat on us and ask us what we would like to drink.

Maybe. We all chuckled and ordered. 15 minutes later, said we had no menus and he came over with 2 of the 6 drinks. When asked for a menu he responded with \\"oh yes, of course, let me get you menus and some rolls\\" (really, why would anyone go to Bertuccis these days other than the rolls). When we didn't see him for another 10 minutes I grabbed menus from the hostess stand myself and we all began looking. He finally came back with the remaining 4 drinks and said \\"be right back to take your order\\"...we never saw him again until we told someone else to get our bill. He shows up 5 minutes later and says \\"ok let me take your order\\"...no rolls, he never brought the full allotment of menus, 1 round and we were there for an hour. \\n\\nIt was hands down the #1 worst experience in a restaurant I've ever had and I've had many.

I've had a really good sandwich when I first tried Parish Cafe last year which is no longer on the menu, but recently when I tried the Zuni Roll, I was disappointed. I ordered it to go and it came in a huge container so I expected it to be larger than what it was. Instead, there was a large empty space on one side and two halves of a thin wrap on the other with a side of their cranberry sauce and sour cream. They probably should have put the potato salad with the wrap instead of it being in a separate container. The sandwich itself was good and I really liked the cranberry sauce, but it left me wishing that there was more bacon and that it could have either been a larger portion or a cheaper price."},{"name":"Schmidt's Sausage Haus","address":"240 E Kossuth St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Even though I no longer live in Columbus, it is worth the visit when we are visiting in town.

We had a couple in town visiting from Dallas and the girl who is a foodie, really wanted to try this place, so I was happy to oblige. I spent the few days before our reservation looking over the menu and reading reviews online just to get amped. I was particularly excited to see how impressed all the diners are with service and I was prepared for a dinner of a lifetime. Maybe I just hyped it up too much in my mind, but the experience just was not something that warrants \\"best restaurant in Austin\\" types of feelings. \\n\\nI'd echo some of the other mediocre reviews and say the space and design is just \\"okay.\\" There is not a proper entryway, so we could either stand in the parking lot or huddle around the hostess stand waiting for our drinks because the patio was beyond packed.Minimal parking in the shared lot with Bufalina, so hopefully more becomes available when construction is done The service was pretty on point, but some of the first smaller plates we ordered seemed to get lost and did not come out until the end (even after the second round of small plates we ordered 30 minutes later), and we almost had to ask if our server had forgotten to place the order with the kitchen. We received two orders of the shiitake pasta by mistake (server placed wrong order), but my friend liked that best, so it was no big deal. \\n\\nWe all had two drinks, and shared ten plates (11 if you count the extra pasta) and we were all unsatisfied. The plates are SO small. I can appreciate small plates, but it's hard to even get a taste of the flavor combinations when it's such a small bite per person. When we sat down and looked at the a la carte menu, I wanted to try everything, but in the end, I thought some of the dishes were good, but mostly I just felt like it was either too odd, or just nothing that interesting. I distinctly remember eating at other restaurants and remembering certain dishes for days, if not weeks and craving those flavors again and again, and I can't say that about anything I ate at Barley Swine."},{"name":"Truva Turkish Kitchen","address":"60 Andrew Young International Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The Chicken Kebab was delicious.

While walking through the NW area, my friend and I stumbled across Anna's and I've been back ever since (although until last night, it had been few months since I stepped foot onto NW 21st).

You can get Stumptown in so many places in Portland, so it's nice to have a break. And I wish I could remember the name of the coffee, but it escapes me at the moment. Some reviews have complained about the pastries and I can't chime in either way. They sure look good...but I think I'll hold off and just have my coffee. Another huge plus for me is that it has a lot of seating, some comfy...some not so much...and it's open late. Lastly, is the subject of hipsters that several reviews have included. I don't think anyone would would put me in that category and I feel really welcome here being a 'non-hipster'.

Hmm. Modest location, modest exterior, nice-but-modest interior. That said, what awaits when you sit down is anything but modest, and that's mostly a good thing. Andiamo doesn't just dispense with pretense on outward appearances, it hides itself in a low-rent jungle, challenging you to find it and figure out it's the most sophisticated and spendy joint in the whole neighborhood. Fairly tilting against those fast-food windmills, aren't we, Andiamo?\\n\\nFortunately I knew to expect more than the modest digs indicate. We find the menu sophisticated and our server pleasant, knowledgable and articulate. So far, so good. For starters: a shaved fennel salad and bowl of chilled cantaloupe soup. The soup is excellent, with flavors of orange, nutmeg and perhaps cloves all getting along with the fresh cantaloupe. The fennel salad is simple and pleasant - the truffle oil subtle, letting the fresh fennel do most of the talking. Warm herbed bread comes to the table and commands our full attention.\\n\\nI chose a second course to fully gauge my opinion of  Andiamo's obvious confidence in their food. It's ballsy, after all, to seek a niche defined almost exclusively by the food: The environs aren't just neutral, they're downright hostile to the cause of a restaurant serving upscale food at upscale prices. I put my expectations to the test with Penne con Salsiccia: pasta and Italian sausage in a saffron cream sauce. I love all of these flavors, but was skeptical they could come together without some compromise or some degree of trainwreck. The dish did indeed work, but the compromise came from the Italian sausage, which tasted to be little more than slightly sweetened ground pork, not the sweet-but-bold, fennel-infused kind of sausage I love so much. That worked well for the dish, but was hardly a flavor synergy to defy every expectation, leaving me a good plate of pasta but not a transcendent one.\\n\\nIf I was determined to find some shortcoming, the entree wouldn't be much of a gripe. Unfortunately, though, our bottle of red was more substantially disappointing. Three reds are offered by the glass for $11 or $40 for a bottle. Curbing extravagance, we chose to stay within that modest selection. No expert in Italian wines, I simply asked for the driest of the three. It tasted no better than wines that might cost half that price at a more humble restaurant (and half that again at the supermarket), and wasn't commensurate with the quality found elsewhere on the table.\\n\\nTo sum up the ramble, un-squint the critical eye and get to the take-away, Andiamo is certainly a surprise and certainly very good. It seems they are carefully focused on authenticity, with the structure and offerings on the menu, with the focus on Italian wine, and with articulate servers. The food and service are equal to many swank restaurants with fantastic location and ambience. The catch is that the prices are also equal. If the numbers next to the menu items met even half way with the realities of the humble environs, I'd be enamored with the place. As it is, I remain just about as puzzled over the lowbrow location and highbrow prices as I was before sitting down to eat here."},{"name":"Gourdough's Public House","address":"2700 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The first three words that come to mind when try to describe the food at Gordough's Public House: mouth watering goodness. I had my hesitations when it came to the idea of eating a donut burger, but damn was I pleasantly surprised when it came time to sink my teeth into my food for the first bite. I think I was under the perception that the donut was going to be glazed and sweet, but it was actually flakey and toasted, almost like a croissant.  \\n\\nI ordered the Double D's burger, and I substituted the bleu cheese with the three cheese blend instead since I'm not a huge fan of the sharpness of bleu cheese. The patty was seasoned well and the over easy egg was a great compliment to my burger. I got a side of fried okra with my meal, which was ok in my opinion. I actually eat okra quite often when I cook meals at home, but it was my first time having it fried, which I personally thought was a little greasy but still good none the less because the breading had good flavor in it. \\n\\nOut of all the great eats in Austin, I would have to say this was my favorite spot!

As is service. \\n\\nChain food can seem better with solid service, which wasn't the case, at least in our experiences and after reading other reviews, it seems standard.

A nice combination of flavors, with a good crisp texture and sprinkle of parmesan.\\n\\nI almost always get the Butcher's Cut and highly recommend it. But this time I tried the bacon cheese burger. It was good, but I realized there's a reason I get the Butcher's Cut. I ordered the fries for the first time, actually. I was pleased to see a good quantity come out - probably meant to be shared; but not tonight. Oh, no, they were all mine.\\n\\nFor anyone not familiar with the concept - these are gourmet burgers, meaning it's not enourmously huge and mass-produced. Fresh, quality ingredients.

In fairness, though, I haven't been to any of the other \\"gourmet\\" burger places that have opened up around town. So many restaurants, so litlte time.\\n\\nI also had a beet salad w/gorgonzola. Don't let the beets fool you. There's nothing healthy about this salad - it was drenched in dressing. It's got a great combination of flavors, though, that make it delectable. I was famished going in and it provided the right holdover til the main attraction.\\n\\nThe Nutella shake didn't disappoint, as usual. If you like Nutella, this is a must! If you've never had Nutella, try it. I had only had Nutella (hazelnut chocolate spread) once in Spain; my relatives there spread it on warm crepes for breakfast. I thought I had died and gone to heaven when they made me some for breakfast. So when I saw Nutella shake on the menu the first time I went to FLIP, it took me back to the Old Country.

It's a small place and of course we understood as there were six of us.  We we got inside after about 20 minutes and were presented with the menus.  The food items all looked incredibly inviting.  Between us all we ordered an array of items.  One teenager ordered the trio of appetizers (he chose the Gurkha platter with prawns, chicken and a potato salad) and enjoyed it thoroughly.  It was beautifully presented.  I ordered the Lhasa Chow Mein which was a stir fried soft noodle with vegetables and chicken (there is a vegetarian option with tofu) seasoned with soy sauce and coriander.  Beautifully presented, fragrant, tasty and presented well.  It was absolutely delicious!  One order was good for an average appetite.  Someone else ordered the Pokhara Lamb which  was boneless and marinated in yogurt, ginger garlic paste and Nepali spices and grilled. Again fragrant and delicious, also presented beautifully with rice, roti and a small veggie salad.  One of our other diners ordered the Thakali Carom Soup which was lentils mixed with diced, boneless chicken and vegetables and mild Himalayan spices including cardamom seeds.  I had a taste and it was so good I got an order to bring home!. Two others had the chicken special,, Sherpa Chicken which was fresh chicken cooked in a broth made from herbs and mixed with curry sauce and flavoured with Himalayan peppercorns.  Again served with rice, roti and a small salad. Another diner ordered the other evening special, Aalu-Kaauli, cauliflower, potatoes, green pees and tomatoes cooked with herbs and spices.  This was a vegetarian dish.  Wonderful aroma, apparently delicious, I didn't taste this.   All entres I believe came with rice and roti.  I had the Himalayan masala milk tea which is like a chai latte.  It was beautifully scented and tasted of exotic spice.  We all ordered desserts, Chai Flavoured Creme Brulee which had moderate review and was a small portion.  A couple of us had the Kheer, a traditional Nepali sweet rice/mild pudding flavoured with cardomom, raisins, cashews and coconut flakes.  I loved it.  Our teen ordered the Dudhbari which was a Nepali dessert, much like an Indian Rasmalai, a cheesy milky dessert with pistaschio flavoured cream syrup.  I did taste it and thought it was very good.  Our teenager didn't care for it.  All in all it was a delicious evening, good value, fabulous, kind and attentive  service with  a smile and so concerned that everything was done right and that we enjoyed it!

The restaurant is nicely decorated in what I would call a contemporary Greek decor.  Mostly white, subtle blue accents nice setting.  The server was very attentive and prompt.\\n\\nWe ordered a starter which was a bowl of tiny whole fish deep fried with a dipping sauce.  We felt that the fish were very oily, not fish oily by cooking oily.  We didn't eat more that two each and the server noticed and offered to replace it and brought us some, also fried, potato thingies which were like spicy home fry disks.  They were OK but also fried and oily.  For our entrees, we both ordered the halibut.  I love halibut.  When the server put the plates down, it looked nice, however, I got a waft of fishy smell.  When we both took the first taste, we paused and looked at each other.  The flavors/spices used were weird and were not complimenting the fish in any way.  We both took as second bite and put the forks down.  Off-putting flavors.  The server came over and asked how it was and we let her know.  We both felt we'd be force-eating these dishes.  They accommodated us and took the plates back.  They offered to substitute anything else so we had the lamb chops and the Giant Prawns.  Both of which were better.  We also had two sides, one was an Eggplant Stew which was also very oily and the other was a braised kale, also oily. \\n\\nThe manager commented that the chef said their was something wrong with the Halibut dishes as well.  Both he and the server were very accommodating and tried to do the right thing.  While I greatly appreciated the manager's and server's accommodations and efforts, the food must be good. The amount of oil used seemed excessive at every turn and the seasoning of the Halibut was, I can't even describe it.  \\n\\nWe really didn't each much.

This place is located out of the way of any major streets which is nice, because its totally quiet. We chose to sit outside because we knew we would be smoking hookah after dinner (which was one of the major selling points for us). We ordered the sampler platter as an appetizer and the lamb kabobs as an entree. The sampler platter was pretty good, coming from middle eastern descent, I'd say the best thing on it was the hummus and the tzaziki. The dolmas had a nice touch of balsamic to them, so we liked that alot. My husband really enjoyed the baba ghanoug (eggplant) and the tabouli salad. The entree came out and it was served with Basmati rice (which I am a huge fan of) and grilled veggies. The rice was of course, fantastic and the veggies were good. The lamb was overcooked and dry. I've had some amazing lamb in my day from places like this...and this was so NOT up to par, I was really saddened by that. \\nOn to the Hookah. We ordered the guava flavored one, and it was brought out by a belly dancer (which I thought was cute). The flavor of this specific one was incredible. It was light, and soo deliciously tropical. They have these new coals that last FOREVER so you really don't need a refill, but the belly dancer gave us one anyway. We were there smoking for about an hour, and the flavor never dissipated, which is awesome. I would come back here for Hookah, but not for the food...and the food is not cheap either.

Botticelli's was getting some \\"eh\\" reviews, so we put it off. Then one day, one one of my Yelp surfing marathons, Andiamo popped off as one of the most bookmarked restaurants and well, the rest is history.\\n  We headed out the other night for the trek to Andiamo. And it is a trek for those of us that live downtown. But it's worth it. It was also somewhat difficult to find given that it is located in a tiny strip mall with a karate studio on one side and a beauty school on the other. That is okay with me. I love hidden gems. \\n  And Andiamo is certainly a hidden gem. So hidden in fact that my friend and I were the only couple in the restaurant for our entire meal. One other group wandered in as we were leaving about two hours later, but that was it. This was to our benefit as we enjoyed IMPECCABLE service and outstanding advice. Our waiter had obviously been there a while and knew everything on the menu forwards and backwards. He was totally straightforward and let us know when he thought we were ordering too much food. (We're greedy, what can I say).\\n The menu can be overwhelming. They have a very extensive regular menu with pages of dishes ranging from seafood to pasta to meat to poultry. On top of that they have a specials menu that changes daily that is also quite lengthy. It took us a good half an hour to finally wade through all the options. (They have a great deal on a tasting menu/chefs choice for both the specials and the regular menu, and that might be worth trying if you can't make up your mind.)\\n  I started with the scallops and they were perfectly cooked in a light cream sauce with capers. The capers weren't over-powering and the total taste was an exceptional mix of flavors. Highly recommended. My friend started with the tomato/basil/mozzarella plate which he also highly recommended. \\n  For our entrees I had a pasta with sausage and goat cheese in a delicious and hearty red sauce and my friend had the linguine and claims. They are VERY generous portions, so bring your appetites. My pasta was perfectly al dente and the goat cheese paired with the sausage well. (They had a lobster ravioli that looked amazing and may be what I get next time.) My friend said his linguine was perfectly seasoned, and it certainly must have been because their wasn't a drop left on his plate.\\n  OH, and I almost forgot: The wine list is EXTREMELY reasonable and very thorough with detailed paragraphs about each region and a list of the wine characteristics. We had an AWESOME Chianti. \\n   So I highly recommend this little place for incredible food in service in a low-key environment. This is one hidden gem I hope becomes more popular.

Desta is a nicer setting than any of the other places we have tried.  It is comfortable, somewhat intimate, and versatile.  They have a sun room kind of thing and a darker, cooler sort area full of dark wood.

Our server was memorably sweet and took excellent care of us.  I couldn't remember the names of my favorite things but she made suggestions and pegged everything perfectly.\\n\\nWhich gets us to the food.  Wow.  This is how Ethiopian food should be.  The yummy flat spongy bread stuff, called injera, was moist and perfect.  My beef dish was spicy and rich and just wonderful.  My wife's dish, made with ground beef, was also much appreciated.  The honey wine (it's, like, mandatory to drink the honey wine with Ethiopian food, right?) was just like the stuff we've had in other places, and just as good.

We were so hungry we used our regular forks. Everything is back on track... until dinner comes - no steak knife for bf. He makes it half way through his steak before our waiter realizes he has no steak knife and brings him one. It appears to me there's a guy that is supposed to bring out the appropriate silverware, but he's not doing it, but our waiter should be on top of that. When our deserts come - we have no spoon or fork to eat them with and once again have to wait for them to be fetched for us. \\n\\nIt was just really weird to have this happen.

It was the first of many examples of the exemplary service of the staff at M+C: that they were always aware of our needs without being boorish or overbearing. They joined, not interrupted. They acted as new friends and confidantes, not people working for a paycheck. Bravo!\\n\\nThe hostess came and found us and offered us a spot at the end of a long communal table. The hand-over from hostess to waitress was one of two kinks in the otherwise fluid service of the night. We waited for 5-10 minutes before a very sweet waitress offered us water and drinks. We wasted no time in placing our order (which, we were assured, would arrive in succession). We had quite a bit of conversation to distract us from the rather long wait for the first course: sweet + sour Brussels sprouts, a wait even our waitress apologized for, which was duly appreciated! The Brussels sprouts were flawless. Perfectly salty, sweet and savory, I'm salivating just thinking about them. It was the first of four courses that highlighted the playful, creative twists of the Myers + Chang menu.\\n\\nSoon after, a rather frazzled runner dropped off the Korean BBQ sloppy joe and the mushroom lo mein. The sloppy joe had just the right amount of sweetness and a nice kick at the end of each bite. The lo mein was seasoned nicely, which heaping chunks of delicious mushroom. And as our last course, our waitress dropped off the infamous duck wing. These were, as the bartender recommended, the star of the night. The wings were sticky, sweet and slightly crispy on the outside, but so, so tender and juicy on the inside. The marinade, if I could guess, tasted like a reduced pomegranate juice, and the pistachios added a nice texture and earthiness to the plate. A resounding bravo!\\n\\nOur waitress, apologizing for the wait between our order and first course, brought us each a complimentary sangria. Such a truly professional touch, and the sangria was incredibly good to boot! We paid our very reasonably priced bill, tipped our waitress 30%, and upon exiting the restaurant, were greeted by at least 5 of the staff members who all told us some version of 'have a good night!' My friend, incredulous with the fantastic service, turned to me and proclaimed, \\"is this what it feels like to be famous?!\\"\\n\\nMyers + Chang is a gem in the crown of the usually stiff Boston restaurant world.

The answer; none.\\n\\nWhy we chose to eat here:\\nSarah had the day off and after thirty years, I figured I should give this local landmark a try.\\n\\nThe food:\\nAbsolutely amazing, everything we had was top notch.  It's a small menu (a far cry from the very large menu at its more commercial rival Pizzeria Regina), but when what is offered is so fantastic, who cares.\\n\\nWe shall start with the lamb and sausage combo with hot peppers and fresh italian bread.  Not a combo I would usually think would go together but regardless, it, like everything we ate was damn near perfect.  The house made sausage was the best I have ever had, to the point where I asked our server if they sold it raw to take home, which they unfortunately do not.  The sausage had a perfect blend of spice and also paired great with a bit of the hot pepper for some real kick.  I can't say enough how good it was, really.  The lamb, though not as super-crazy-good, was still extremely delicious, cooked perfectly with just a little gaminess to let you know it's not beef without being overpowering as some lamb can be.  Cut a nice little piece, eat it with some of the Italian bread and pretend you are a gangster from days gone by, seriously, try it, it really works.\\n\\nNext was, of course, the pizza.  We ordered two, one cheese, because really any great pizza place should be judged on its cheese pizza, and a pepperoni sausage combo pizza.  Starting with the cheese, this pizza was simply outstanding.  He sauce had a very pure tomato taste, and the cheese, when fresh from the oven, stretched a good six inches if you let it.  The crust was thin but not too thin and crisp without being burnt.  This my favorite of the two pizzas for its purity and balance of flavor.  As a side note we took some to my nana's on the way home and even she, who notoriously doesn't eat pizza that is not her own had a little bite, then another bigger bite, then a small piece of her own.  Her seal of approval was simply stunning and a vote that should be taken very seriously, as this woman is full off the boat Italian, fed a husband, five children and umpteen grandchildren for the last sixty years, she knows her Italian food.  \\n\\nThe sausage and pepperoni pizza, while also fantastic, especially with that house made sausage, didn't have the same perfect balance to me.  Don't get me wrong it was still up there as a top five or ten pizza in my life and the crisp crust did not suffer from the extra topping grease and weight, but I would opt for the cheese given the choice.  Sarah on the other hand preferred this pizza hands down.    \\n\\nThe service:\\nThe server was outstanding, talking to guests as if they were family.  We even over heard a conversation with another table where the patron began talking about their love of jazz.  Seconds after the server left their table what comes piping through the speakers but Ella Fitzgerald.  I have never seen anything like it before.  Every restaurant needs someone like him waiting tables, it just makes you feel at home.\\n\\nBeyond the server the establishment is extremely old school.  You really can imagine years ago, a few wise guys meeting in the back over some lamb and bread, discussing \\"business\\".  They don't sell by the slice, but you wouldn't want just a slice anyway.  The pizzas aren't huge but enough for two people in most cases.  Receipts are hand written and I'm not sure if there is a computer in the building, but that just adds to the charm.  Finally, the place seemed very well kept and clean.  For the age of the business and building, you can tell it is very well taken care of.\\n\\nThe final rundown:\\nAfter all these years imagine my surprise when I plugged the address into my GPS and found out it was 9 minutes away from my home, NINE MINUTES!  Sure maybe I have to pay a toll to get home, but it's a small price to pay for one of the best pizzas in Massachusetts, and possibly the country, yeah I'm looking at you NYC, I'd put this up against anything you got."},{"name":"Wild Ginger","address":"124 Washington St","city":"Norwell","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been here several times in the last few months and I have to say it has become one of my favorite restaurants and undoubtably my favorite thai restaurant.

Based on the reviews we read on Yelp and Google, we expected a lengthy wait, but had time to wait because our flight back to the states was not until the evening, and we were looking for things to do to kill time. When we got to Medina, there was a line outside the door -- expected. When my boyfriend went inside to put our name on the waiting list, as it stated you're supposed to do per a sign on the door of the restaurant, he was told by the host to \\"go wait outside.\\" When my boyfriend came back outside, the only two people standing in line outside said they were told the same thing. So a line proceeded to form behind us, but we saw a few people walk in, talk to the host, and appear to be seated. \\n\\nFinally, a woman walked passed us and asked \\"Did you put your name on the list?\\" When we told her that we had tried but had been told to wait outside, she walked past us and said she was going to put her name on the list. At that point, we were confused and fed up. We followed the woman and two people in front of of us inside and told the host that we had been told to wait outside while he allowed people to walk in and be seated/put their name on the list. \\n\\nHe immediately apologized, which was nice, but then he said \\"I couldn't see that there was a line outside because I can't see around the corner.\\" That excuse would have flown if the two people in front of us hadn't been standing to the side of the glass front door. The host then said that he would put our names on the list, and everyone else needed to form a line a behind us and those that couldn't fit needed to go outside a form a line. He also told the two people in front of us to go outside. We explained to him again that they had been there before us. He finally seemed to understand his error, but then added that is was currently a one hour and 15 minute wait for parties of two. \\n\\nLike I said, we had time to wait, and would have waited, except that our first and probably only experience with Medina was poor, which made us decide we didn't want to eat there. \\n\\nWe understand that things happen. The restaurant was super-busy when we showed up -- it could frazzle anyone, but it has been in business for a while and should have the basics figured out. \\n\\nI ate at another very popular Vancouver breakfast/brunch establishment during my stay in the city, and while there was a 45 minute wait, the restaurant had ropes set up for people to stand behind which provided order and allowed people walking by to not be impeded by people standing in line waiting to eat at the restaurant. The host would come out on occasion to ask those standing in line how many people were in the dining party, make note, and update everyone on the wait time. It made the wait completely acceptable even before trying the food."},{"name":"Cherrywood Coffeehouse","address":"1400 E 38th 1/2 St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This has everything I was looking for in a cafe.

We had their fagioli with shrimp and tomatoes as an appetizer and it quite good, though very small for the price. We split calzones and veal marsala and both were delicious, though we don't pay these prices at other restaurants in Columbus that are on par with Giuseppes. We shared a spumoni bombe and while the strawberry, pistachio and chocolate gelattos tasted wonderful, the dessert was rock hard and we spent several ungainly minutes trying to stab into it with our spoons and hands. Service was not attentive, but that could be because of how busy they were. I would gladly come back for the bar service and appetizers. My review would increase dramatically if Giueseppe's altered their direction-either more elevated flavors to match their current prices or reducing the cost to match the quality."},{"name":"Amrheins","address":"80 W Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I flew in tonight from my home in California and a friend took me here.

My husband and I finally tried Gusto last night after living 1 mile away from it for 3 years, and we are definitely fans. The ambience is nice- it's a little noisy, but in a relaxed, comforting way, and despite the noise it's a cute, romantic spot. The host was friendly and genuine, and our waiter (Steven) was perfect. He was sweet, helpful with wine and food choices, and seemed happy to be there! Also, he told us that they have a fairly new (and much improved) chef on staff, which I feel yelp should know about as that chef did it right for us. We had the mussels as an appetizer- the rich white wine garlic sauce was so delicious that we sopped it all up with the (tasty!) bread after finishing the mussels themselves. My husband then had the spinach lasagna, which was a HUGE portion and absolutely fantastic. The red sauce has just a hint of sweetness to it, which really ups the ante of the dish. I had the salmon with risotto- the risotto was like a caprese salad made into a carb: heavenly. The salmon was almost wonderful; the meat was definitely a good cut of fish, and it had a lovely smoky grilled flavor, but it just a tiny bit overdone and needed a little more flavor. A dash of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and pepper would probably have done the trick. I still thought it was great, but that's me being picky. Our recommended bottle of pinot grigio (Tiefenbrunner) was a spectacular find for $38. If you like pinot grigios with a lot of flavor that sit just between sweet and dry, this is the wine for you. We were way too full for dessert, but the choices looked nom-alicious. The price is right, too- yay!

Parking anywhere close to downtown scores points.\\n\\nInterior is clean, loads of seating inside and there is an outside deck but not for August heat.  Can be a little confusing as to where to start getting your food if there is no line to show you.\\n\\nYou grab a plate or a To Go box and start with sides.  Potato salad was pretty good and had a nice chunky homemade feel. Not too much mayo which i like.  Coleslaw was also pretty darn good.\\n\\nOn to the meat.  I had moist brisket and pork ribs.  The ribs were really nice. Meaty and lean with a sweet glaze with a hint of pepper.  I actually prefer it if the meat doesn't just fall off the bone but I know that is the popular choice for most patrons.  The brisket was good.  Tender as could be but a little bland. I really don't like the caked in pepper rub that most places seem to use but these could have used a touch more seasoning.  Bark could have been better too. Good smoke though. I'd say better than most but certainly not up to Franklin standards, which is the very best I ever had by a long shot and I was lucky enough to have it brought to me and didn't have to stand in line for hours.  Nothing is that good.\\n\\nAs a bonus they have live music. The night I was there it was a really good singer-songwriter with a fine line in jokes and patter.  The volume was just right, low enough to hold conversation easily but loud enough if you wanted to listen.

Are restaurants going to start charging cover too? It's completely ludicrous! You are charging me to come into your establishment so I can sit on a chair and spend more money on a drink, which was probably marked up 200% already. You've got to be kidding me. Between the three of us that would have been $30 cover, plus at least $30 on drinks/ $10 each I'm sure. So $60 to come in for 30 minutes for one drink.

But, in Portland, one inevitably comes across the top donut talk. My friends endorsed Pip's, but my dislike of their corndog batter left my donut experience quite lacking. I wasn't willing to wait in the long outdoor line at Voodoo, so I made a point to swing by Blue Star multiple times to sample their offerings. There were slim pickings on a Monday at 2 PM, but all flavors were available when I swung by on a Tuesday at noon (and again at 2 PM...yes, I may be slightly obsessed).\\n\\nMy favorite type of donut is the yeast donut--more specifically, French crullers. I usually find cake donuts, including old-fashioned cake donuts, to be too dense and heavy. So I was pleasantly surprised to find that their brioche dough recipe works sublimely in both yeast and cake form. Add buttermilk to the cake batter, and it's just as good as the original cake batter. Honestly, one could use a Blue Star cake donut to convert a cake-donut-hater into a cake-donut-lover.\\n\\nAlongside the perfect batter, Blue Star has put a lot of thought into combining flavors. Among the 7 I tried, my flavor preferences go:\\n\\n1) The lemon poppy buttermilk, $3.75, an old-fashioned buttermilk cake donut glazed with a lemon glaze and poppy seeds. A comforting flavor, and the lemon glaze has the perfect dab of tartness. It's like eating a lemon poppy seed pound cake, mmm.\\n\\n2) The blueberry cake, $3, a vanilla traditional cake donut with the same blueberry Bulleit bourbon basil glaze as its $3.50 brioche yeast sister. A close second to the lemon poppy, with my only complaints being that the basil and bourbon flavors are pretty much absent (granted, they state that the bourbon is only added for a hint of caramel depth).\\n\\n3) The raspberry rosemary buttermilk, $3.75, an old-fashioned buttermilk cake donut glazed with raspberry and rosemary. The raspberry is very tart, and the herby rosemary works surprisingly well.\\n\\n4) The real maple bacon, $4.25, a brioche yeast donut glazed with maple glaze and fresh bacon chunks. The maple glaze isn't too heavy, and the bacon chunks are goood. Only downside is that it's really dang expensive for a donut.\\n\\n5) The chocolate almond ganache, $3.50, a brioche yeast donut glazed with French dark chocolate and salted Marcona almonds. Not bad. Would recommend if you're a dark chocolate fan.\\n\\n6) The OG (orxata glaze), $3, a brioche yeast donut glazed with housemade horchata! The cinnamon does indeed peek its head in an otherwise solid glazed donut.\\n\\n7) The passionfruit cocoa nib, $3.25, a brioche yeast donut glazed with passionfruit, cayenne pepper, and cocoa nibs. The passionfruit is too sour, the cayenne pepper is too spicy, and the cocoa nibs did not make an appearance.\\n\\nTo my own surprise, cake donuts reign supreme in the ranking! Though I ranked moreso on flavor than donut type. Because their donut batter deserves more than a blue star--it deserves a gold star."},{"name":"Punjab Palace","address":"109 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"They will sell you watered-down food.

It's perplexing at the very least. Every time I have come here there has been at least one amazing, friendly and knowledgeable bartender. Yes they employ more than their share of mindless women but I normally eye the one competent bartender and they are my go to guy or girl for the rest of the night. And they are always amazing. Super friendly, have no issue chatting with you and always offering up a new drink or beer to try. AND they always let you try a beer before you order a pint. Most places in Boston would look at you like you were crazy if you asked to try first. The doormen have always been polite. My guess is if you're not an asshole and not looking to cause trouble, how  much interaction other than \\"ID Please\\" and \\"Have a nice night\\" are u having with the door staff? 15 cent wings are delicious and HUGE. Honey buffalo? I'm in love. We had 5 beers and 10 wings last night and our bill was 25 bucks. Not bad, beers anywhere in Boston run 5 bucks. It's expected and the norm. I like the staff, the atmosphere and the fact that it's like MTV circa 1989 on the TV's where they always play the video for the song that's playing in the bar. FUN.

I asked for extra gravy on my rice given that Jollaf is of dry consistency.\\nWhen I received my bill there was a $5.00 charge for gravy or what the waitress referred to as \\"stew\\". Excuse me? $5 additional bucks for a red gravy sauce? When I brought the matter up she said that it's their practice to charge extra for \\"stew\\". \\nGreat, do that but when a customer asks for extra gravy on the rice make them aware that your intention is to call it something different and charging the HELL out of it. Come on guys-maybe an extra dollar for gravy but be clear and not sneaky. $5 dollars? No.\\n\\nNext issue which I believe is illegal:\\nAdding tip/gratuity to parties OF 2. When you get your printed reciept -which they will try NOT to give so that you won't notice- you'll see that they add a 15% gratuity to the bill. Now, we know it's customary to have gratuity added to larger parties but isn't it illegal to add it to parties of 2?!! \\nI typically leave nothing less than 20% but why be underhanded about it by adding and then requesting additional gratuity fees through Apple pay?

The dim-ish lighting was nice, this would be a great date spot.\\n\\nThe front of house staff was super friendly and attentive. They kept bottles of water at the table but were great about keeping our water glasses full. They gave a brief description of each plate they brought out. This is definitely a place for foodies! \\n\\nThe dishes were beautifully plated and yes, TINY portions - we kept saying we wished there was more because everything was amazing, but 14 tiny plates left us feeling full - not overly so - satisfied. The food is DELICIOUS. \\n\\nWe paid $85 each to sit at the table and enjoy our very own menu. Working in the food service industry myself, I know that we paid for the quality and uniqueness of the food and for the very talented and passionate chefs who know that cooking is truly an art form.\\n\\nMaybe this isn't a place some people could frequent, but if you're at all passionate about food it's a totally different and unique dining experience that you MUST try at least once.\\n\\nOh!

As someone who does not regularly eat Italian food, I would never have discovered Andiamo.  Rebecca R. and Asher L. decided we should get dolled up and have a fancy double date.  Rebecca R. made reservations and we met them here.  When Eric R. and I walked in, the hostperson was already checking to make sure everyone had reservations, as it is a quaint spot, so make sure to have those before showing up.\\n\\nI did a little yelp review reading before getting here and had a general idea of what to expect.  Eric R. and I went to Lago di Como last year for a wedding, and I certainly have an appreciation for fresh pasta and authentic Italian food, so I was anticipating a wonderful experience.  We had an awesome server who was efficient, patient, and responsive.  Eric R. wanted moscato d'asti, which elicited a quizzical look (\\"that's sweet!\\") but that is what he wanted and he got it!  I got prosecco and Rebecca R. got pinot niero.  The complementary bread was very delicious, with spinach and cheese marbled inside.  We dipped in olive oil, raspberry balsamic, and parmesan to our delight.  Though it is indeed obvious that a bread refill costs money on the menu, I told Eric R. about the many reviews that complained about this.  Eric R. joked with the server about it, and we ended up with a second bread basket gratis!\\n\\nTo start, Eric R. and I shared the tartare di salmone (Fresh raw salmon, mixed with capers, green olives, green onion, Dijon mustard and lemon juice in extra virgin olive oil) - it was served on a thin slice of watermelon radish, and the carpaccio di manzo (Thin slices of beef fillet mignon (Stock Yard), marinated in lemon olive oil, topped with organic baby arugula and all-natural Italian pecorino cheese).  Both were tasty and delicious.  Rebecca R. and Asher L. split the involtini di melanzane which looked amazing and I love eggplant, but they had no reason to share with me :) They also got the insalata braccio di ferro.\\n\\nWhile they finished up, I had the insalata di finnochio (Shaved fennel, walnuts, farm goat cheese, tossed with white truffle oil and fresh lemon juice).  My first shaved fennel was at the Enoteca San Marco-turned-Otto Enoteca at the Venetian in Vegas, and I have been a fan ever since.  I just loved every element of this simple salad, and I did in fact share it with Rebecca R. because friends deserve a little white truffle oil every time!\\n\\nFor our mains, Rebecca R. and I both opted for the ravioli di barbabietola (Homemade beet ravioli, filled with beets and all-natural Italian ricotta cheese, saut√©ed with pistachio basil pesto), Asher L. got the zucchini noodle dish, and Eric R. got the Spaghetti Luci Johnson (Wild caught shrimps, cherry tomatoes, mixed mushrooms, organic arugula, and crushed red pepper flakes in a garlic olive oil sauce).  I LOVED mine because I love beets and ricotta, and the pesto was divine (Eric R. kept scooping it for himself).  I also received 5 raviolis which was generous since it showed 4 was common in previous reviews and pictures.  Eric R.'s dish was also delicious - the noodles were al dente, the flavor was great, his mushrooms and tomatoes were tasty, and the shrimp was delicious.\\n\\nOverall, it is hard to find fault with the meal - the food was great, the service was great, we had wine and fantastic company.  Then I convinced everyone to go to Snow Monster for dessert in lieu of tiramisu!"},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Amazing place to dine!

The friends we were meeting were already inside, almost to the register to order, when we arrived, so Plus 1 star for no wait! \\n\\nThe special this night was a Peking Duck Burger - 5-spices ground duck, with pickled radishes, and lots of other Delish ingredients.  It sounded awesome, so I had to have it.  It did not disappoint!  The flavor was like eating roasted peking duck at a top notch asian restaurant, ground up and served on a bun.  AMAZING!  My date ordered The PrimeTime (I think) and it sounded wonderful too, with the truffle aioli and the brie cheese... But I found my burger was far superior... Of course, she disagreed...  Our friends both ordered The Goodnight, on gluten-free buns, which they said were really tasty and could have fooled a discerning bread eater!  We all shared one order of truffled fries, which were my second favorite item tasted all night!  The aioli is served on the side so you can decide for yourself how \\"truffled\\" you want your fries!\\n\\nOf course, being downtown on a Friday, celebrating whatever we chose to that evening, we ordered drinks too.  I had the Lil' Prick - which was refreshing, not over-powerfully alcohol flavored, with a delightfully light prickly pear flavor. My date had the Mighty Mule, which she enjoyed, and I didn't taste due to being so infatuated with my \\"Lil' Prick\\"!\\n\\nAll in all, great atmosphere, no rush feeling, despite the line that is ever-present at the door.  I do appreciate the requirement to wait outside, as it keeps the inside space dedicated to food and drink enjoyment, undisturbed by the anxiously waiting next parties.

Prior to that, it had been years since I had one. I eat reasonably healthy and keep to everything in moderation.\\n\\nSo why did I end up here? A buddy who i hadn't seen in over 3-4 years was up here on a business trip and he wanted to go to Blue Star. By the way, if you're an Eagles fan like myself and my buddy, Blue Star is a bad name (ie. dallas cowboys) just saying. Anyways, he was staying downtown and it was a short walk over to the donut shop. Surprisingly, it wasn't too busy. I've passed the Hawthorne location and seen about a chicken fried donut, but this location does not do it. A chocolate almond ganache was pretty inviting, as was a maple bacon. Both were purchased and my buddy was happy with his and I quite enjoyed the chocolate almond ganache one. It was very light and the chocolate was oh so good.\\n\\nThe place is very clean looking and I enjoyed all the signage and branding around the place, the art director in me and all that... I can't say I'll be back just because this was a special occasion, but if a place like this can get me to eat a donut, then it must be really, really worth it.\\n\\nEnjoy."},{"name":"Dancing Goats Coffee Bar","address":"419 W Ponce De Leon Ave","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"I've been here numerous times and have enjoyed each of them, but today, I may have had the best cup of coffee of my life.\\n\\nThe employees are always nice and personable.

Service was ok. The online menu is outdated. \\n\\nI want to review everything we had, but I want to focus on the wedgie salad because that's what I had and it doesn't seem like anyone has mentioned it/photographed it yet. \\n\\nWe had fried Brussels sprouts (yummy, but a little salty) & fried okra as an appetizer. The okra was the best fried okra I've ever had. \\n\\nDH had their version of the monte cristo and I had The Wedgie (wedge salad).  Hah sadly, my decision to order something lighter and go with a salad was not wise since my salad seemed to have more calories that DH's fried sandwich. \\n\\nSome things to note about the wedgie:\\n\\nThis salad is huge and can easily be shared (or taken home). It comes with 2 wedges of lettuce.  You can satisfy the desire to try one of their donuts since it comes with a garlic donut on the side. The three strips of chicken fried bacon are huge (and overkill). Good to know if you're considering adding chicken or catfish to this salad. The chicken fried bacon seems to be battered and fried in its raw state contributing to its size (and fat content). It's deliciously crispy on the outside because of the batter, but without the batter it would be pretty soft bacon. The CF bacon is also incredibly salty because the batter has lots of salt (in addition to the saltiness of the bacon itself). \\n\\nOne great thing about the salad is that it's reasonably priced for the amount of food you get ($8 I believe) and the leftovers keep well since it's an iceberg wedge, it stays pretty crisp. To heat up the leftover bacon I just warmed it up on a cast iron griddle and it got nice and crispy again. \\n\\nI might go back in a year after I've worked off all the calories I just had :)"},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Not sure how long this place has been around since none of my friends from UT have mentioned it..but boy, they are seriously missing out.

The stronger IPA, Alter Ego, could particularly benefit from more flavor to counter the almost 8% alcohol.  The Bourbon Stout was pretty good, getting some flavor from the oak barrels.

For example the guacamole and chips (which should be like an appetizer) came out last at the end of our meal.  It took three trips with about 5 to 7 minute wait between each trip before all of our food came to the table. The service was great everyone is super friendly. The only drawback is when you have questions you have to put a card up. Your waiter or waitress doesn't actually visit your table unless you have that question card up.

The parking is a freaking nightmare, as everyone has pointed out. I do not think I should have to spend more time scouting for parking than it takes for them to make me a freaking burrito. It didn't used to be as bad for me I guess when I was working as a teacher in the area and I could grab dinner here before people got off at rush hour. However, the last time I made the mistake of coming here with my boyfriend at 5:30. WHAT WAS I THINKING?! Clearly I had gone temporarily insane.\\n\\nThe tables are always filthy, also. I mean, it's a fast food place, but McDonald's owns Chipotle and their restaurants are cleaner than this one. C'mon.\\n\\nThe last time I was here though, made me decide I don't want to come back to this location anymore. I have had so many burrito rollers break my burrito and not do anything about it. And it's not like I'm one of those people who asks for one of everything in their burrito! It irks me to no end. To top it off, both my boyfriend and I got vegetarian burritos, and I saw chicken get spilled on his. Thankfully, he's not vegetarian, because if that had happened to me, I would have been PISSED. And then I saw another person sloppily mix in cheese into the guacamole. Should be a nice surprise should a vegan have the misfortune of getting some guac.\\n\\nThen, we got sweet tea, and it was .... well, it wasn't sweet. It tasted like regular, unsweet tea. It was certainly labeled sweet tea. It's a shame, because their sweet tea used to be awesome.\\n\\nAnd to finish things off, after eating, we wanted to wash our hands and found that they now make you go ask for keys to get into the bathroom. I'm sorry, but I really don't think I should have to ask anyone permission to pee. That is just annoying beyond belief.

My sister had the paella, which she said was excellent, as did my brother in law about his pizza. All dishes were a good size, and we took about half the pizza home (my sis and I had pretty much picked out all of the seafood in our dishes, so it was pointless). overall price for 5 people, a lot of food, and 2 glasses of wine: $125, which I think is very reasonable.\\nI would have given them 5 stars, had it not been for the service.

It's one of those places where you like the first burger you try so much that it becomes almost impossible to convince yourself to get anything else, even though everyone else is stuck in the same captive burger equilibrium, coveting the intriguing options on the rest of the menu but unable to escape the powerful gravitational field of their own choices.\\n\\nYou'll see this place a lot on Best Burger lists and it's definitely there for a reason. Great ingredients, including their buns, and they always taste super fresh. They've got a good variety of burgers, from your basic bacon cheese ($7.50) to more offbeat stuff like ahi tuna ($12, with sprouts, honey wasabi, and ginger) or Greek lamb ($8.50, with feta, arugula, and tzatziki), and judging by my conversations with other people, those seem to be just as good as my beloved Llano Poblano ($8, with bacon and chilies). Grab some awesome fries as well ($2.25), or an amazing milkshake for $5.\\n\\nThe only annoyances are things like parking (which is hardly unique to any business on SoCo) or the lines, but those really aren't Hopdoddy's fault. One trick is to sit at the bar and order instead of suffering through the main line with the proles - I did that today and I got my burger like 5 minutes after I ordered. I was honestly shocked at how quickly it arrived (and not shocked at all at how quickly it disappeared). The always-cool staff even managed to convince the woman sitting next to me to break out of her ahi tuna rut and try the lamb; she totally loved it and started telling them how she kept evangelizing Hopdoddy to her friends back in Atlanta.\\n\\nThat in itself should tell you something about how much people like Hopdoddy.

Driving down the brick streets, with their narrowly spaced, European style houses and quaint businesses, sets the tone for as close to authentic German food that you'll find in Columbus. The restaurant itself is welcoming, with hardwood floors and brick walls. You're surrounded by art and photographs that chronicle the history of the famous restaurant and district. Put simply: the place is a wonderful location to eat a bratwurst and some German potato salad. \\n\\nThe Food: I got a Bahama Mama with German potato salad, chunky apple sauce, and tons of sauerkraut. The sausage was delicious, the German potato salad to die for, the apple sauce a nice, refreshing side dish, and the sauerkraut (virtually)  good enough to bathe in. I remember starting to eat, and then I kind of got lost in the food and came to with a packed stomach and a smile on my face. Yeah... it's really good.\\n\\nThe Drinks: me and a family member shared a 6-beer sampler. There were some dark brews and some lighter lagers. All were very good. They had a nice selection of German beers, and some other things on draft or available in bottles (but why would you come here and get anything other than German beer?!)\\n\\nThe Price: For a delicious sit-down meal, it was well worth the change dropped. If I remember correctly, it was around $25  for the two of us -- two entrees and the beer sampler. \\n\\nThe Staff: No complaints. We were seated immediately, served immediately, and taken care of effectively. \\n\\nOverall: I must say that I love German food, so I wasn't surprised that I loved this place so much. Schmidt's feels like a bit of an escape, nestled within quiet German Village. I highly recommend a trip south of downtown to chow down on some Germanic deliciousness!"},{"name":"JaCiva's Bakery","address":"4733 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Anazing.

I went with the middle-of-the-road standard in most respects, except for opting for \\"thick\\" noodles - which are actually about the thickness of spaghetti, as opposed to the \\"thin\\" type, which are something akin to angel hair in size - and getting them slightly firm. \\n\\nAnd I was extremely satisfied with what I got. This was another one of those amazing times when I actually finished all the broth in my bowl, so tasty and rich and creamy it was. (Danbo certainly represents a BIG improvement in quality from the previous ramen shop in this location, Maruko.) It is crowded, the way a good ramen shop should be, but don't worry, this is Vancouver, you're not expected to talk to the people you're sitting next to at the shared table or bar. Only to be conscious of the line growing at the door and not be a slug when the slurping is done. \\n\\nDanbo (I keep typing Dando, as in Evan, I guess) is a highly respectable contender for the ramen stakes in Vancouver, and I like that it isn't too far from downtown.

Seriously!*** \\n\\nAfter months of waiting tonight I finally got to try Five Guys Burgers & Fries.  Located just off of route 27 in Natick this simple, small restaurant chain sits between a tanning salon and a Panera Bread.  For those who can remember, from way back when, this was once the location of one of the few remaining Brigham's restaurants before they began closing all over New England. \\n\\nWalking into Five Guys customers are greeted with a very plain, yet simple design.  Nothing fancy just two basic colors: red & white.  Tables are blonde colored and are sectioned off by bags of Idaho Potatoes and boxes of Peanut Oil.  The menu is simple and uncomplicated: BURGERS & FRIES.  If you've come here looking for anything else then you are a moron.  \\n\\nI've never seen so many people at a grill before in my life.  I enjoyed the open kitchen and watching the various staff move the cooking burgers in a progression.  It seems that every few cooks had a job to do which makes for quick service.  From start to finish everything is well organized and prompt.  Your order slip is itemized with each burger numbered so matching your burger is easy.  \\n\\nHonestly, the burgers here are not well presented but it's a F*#KING burger!  What do you expect?!  What I like about this place is that it goes back to the basics of what burgers and fries really are: simple and good, no messing around.  It's nice to see a restaurant that isn't trying to sell you a fancy, overpriced piece of meat with lots of crap you don't need.\\n\\nI will go out and say that Five Guys has some of the best french fries I've ever tasted.  I'm a big sucker for the kind that are served here.  They are like someone shoved a potatoes through a grate you'd find on a Play-Doh toy then the remains are tossed into hot oil.  Your two choice of sides: the obvious ketchup or malt red vinegar.  \\n\\nSizes.  Typically large is big, yes.  But here large is REALLY BIG!  I would suggest on your first visit here get a Regular size.\\n\\nSo that's it in a nutshell.

Tucked away behind Lucky's Market this a nice place for an adult night out. The decor is eclectic and rustic, dark and nicely appointed. We went for a romantic Valentine's dinner. The hostess was friendly when greeting us and accommodating when we didn't want to sit next to the back door in the bar. \\n\\nService was a bit slow after we sat down. Our glasses of wine took almost 10 minutes to arrive after ordering. They were busy but no one seemed to be running around. For appetizers, we ordered the baked oysters which were underwhelming, uninspired and small. The 'shared' caprese salad consisted of 3 hearty tomato slices topped with mozz and a single basil leaf.  Again, underwhelming, but at least tasty. \\n\\nWe waited probably 20 minutes before our entrees arrived. Our server blamed the 'kitchen being slammed' for the slow services, but several tables who had sat down after us were already eating their dinners. Once the food arrived we were pleasantly surprised after the disappointing appetizers. My seafood paella was delicious with lots of clams, mussels and squid. It could have included a few more shrimp, but the rice was delicious. My wife had the special seafood stew off the Valentine's menu which came with garlic flatbread. Also very tasty and the broth was wonderful.   \\n\\nHaving been happy with our dinner, we moved onto dessert. My tiramisu was very good and my wife's creme brule was decedent and heavenly. A definite save after a disappointing start. \\n\\nOverall a decent experience, but the service and apps could have been better.

As you can tell from my other review for Barcelona, I really do like the Summer St. Sling. My friend's drink was alright, we both were \\"meh\\" about it. While we were deciding on food, the GM checked to see how we were doing and give us his recommendations. We started off with the patatas bravas, spicy beef empanadas and another dish I forget the name of. Patatas bravas are the typical tapas dish but I always order them. They are good and filling. The empanadas were not spicy and a light lick to them. The dish I can't remember was my least favorite and not what I expected. \\n\\nWe decided to order the spicy eggplant caponata as we were still a little hungry. It was a cold dish but was well flavored. I wish it was not as drenched in the sauce and bigger pieces. The GM we spoke with earlier sent us a few complimentary dishes. We tried the jamon (ham) & machengo croquettes, spinach chickpea cazuela and one more I can't remember. The croquettes were cheesy. My favorite was the spinach chickpea.

Absolutely delicious with the right amount of char to add flavor without being too burnt.\\n\\nThere's a nice variety of rice dishes as well.

I did notice, however, that the chicken kabobs and the fish were a little on the dry side.

I didn't try any of the food.  And to be honest, the menu didn't really appear all that appetizing to me.  Query: does the owner or chef here have something against ducks?  I mean, was there some traumatic childhood event?  Because they take a serious hit on the menu (even the burgers are cooked in duck fat!).  But I digress.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is very nice.  It's very open but not too open.  You won't be crowded up against strangers and there are lots of windows, which makes the place seem much larger than it really is.  There is a decent sized bar which allows ample access to the bar help (who are very knowledgeable about the beer) and allows you to see the various ways ducks can be prepared for human consumption.\\n\\nThe beer.  The beer is a bit different for Portland but very good.  Most PDX breweries really stress their IPAs.  While Burnside has an IPA, it isn't a standout.  It's decent, but not fabulous.  Four days after having had it, I cannot remember a single thing about it (except that it didn't really impress me or sicken me).

Nutty and a bit hoppy.\\n\\nAnd now for the standouts:\\n\\nSweet Heat.  WOW!  I loved this, despite drinking it during one of the coldest Decembers in PDX history.  While I have a love for hot foods, I have a few food and beverage rules I like to live by.  I don't put fish in my tacos.  I don't put citrus fruits in my salads.  And I am somewhat of a purest when it comes to beer.  So when brewers go far off the beaten path, I become very wary.  The Sweet Heat was just awesome.  Yes, it does have a hotness to it that really builds if you drink a pint.  But it doesn't hide the beer that underlies this most excellent concoction.  This would be the perfect drink on a hot summer day.\\n\\nThe Osyter beer.  I have no idea what the actual name is.  \\"Oyster\\" is the only thing that stands out.  Not because it tastes like oyster or is slimy.  To the contrary.  I don't like oysters.  I tolerate them but don't go out of my way to eat them.  So I was astonished when I found that I loved this beer.  It's a mellow dark beer that has a somewhat nutty and musty flavor (is that the oyster issue?) and a potent kick, so don't drink too much.  \\n\\nHappy hour prices appear to be very competitive (and on Wednesday they're simply awesome)."},{"name":"Ron's Restaurant","address":"8869 SE 82nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"I've eaten at Ron's several times and have always found the food unremarkable but at least forgivable.\\nWhen we arrived today, we found about 25% of the dining room full, and every single other table covered in dirty dishes.

I thought about not writing this update (every restaurant has an off night once and a while). Yet what isn't fair to Coast would be doubly unfair to yelp readers for me to pretend like last night didn't happen. I truly believe the restaurant was under-staffed last night which resulted in a slammed kitchen who couldn't prepare the amazing dinners we have come to expect from them and which resulted in wait staff who were running around miserably trying to keep their cool instead of topping up our glasses, competently attending to our table, and providing us with the easy, relaxing dining experiences we know they are capable of delivering.\\n\\nTo celebrate my partner's father's birthday, we made reservations for 8 people at 6:15pm 3 days in advance with notice of many of our family's vegan diets. Apparently we were assured the ma√Ætre d' and kitchen would be informed. We even phoned back the morning before our reservation to re-confirm we could be accommodated and were assured the kitchen was prepared. It is frustrating to think that there was nothing else we could have done on our part to ensure a smooth, enjoyable family birthday dinner. If we had been made aware that Coast was simply too booked to provide an acceptable level of quality and service, we would have booked another evening for dinner at Coast. No big deal. But no one gave us this warning or advice.\\n\\nThings started out alright. We were seated immediately upon arrival. The door girls took our coats cheerfully and escorted us to our table where some of our family was already seated. The ma√Ætre d' welcomed us and introduced himself. Hiro came out from the kitchen to inform us that Pedro was away but he was pleased to be cooking for us. Hiro is a good guy and it was nice to have the personal contact. Then suddenly the restaurant was slammed and what started out as a normal dining experience at Coast began to unravel. I knew something was up when we were left pouring our own wine into dry glasses and when staff could be seen running up and down stairs with looks of panic on their faces. We were served a sushi-type amuse-bouche with dry wasabi and pickled ginger but no soy sauce (did somebody forget it?)....then a caprice salad followed shortly....then we waited....and waited.....and waited. Oh boy. By the time my partner asked to speak with the manager, it was 2.5 hours past our original reservation and a good 45 minutes since the salad course. In other words, we arrived around 6:15 starving and excited for dinner only to have to wait until well past 8 for anything substantial to eat. \\n\\nThere were complaints among our family that the dishes served seemed uninspired and out of character from what we are use to at Coast. To make amends for our complaint, the manager took off a sushi roll that our omnivore family members had ordered √† la carte. But a main course did not follow shortly. Still we waited. And frankly, by this time, the restaurant's inability to deal with what was an unreasonably busy Sunday night started to become our family's problem: dishes unbussed, candles burnt out, water bottles left empty. Not cool at all. And then the vegan main course came: 2 rectangles of medium firm tofu plainly \\"seared\\" (barely cooked) covered in curls of pretty red beet atop a few spears of steamed asparagus all floating in a thin, watery, (way too) spicy sauce with soggy pieces of brownish zucchini. That's when even the easiest going of our family started to laugh a little (what else could we do?) and say that we should have cooked at home. By the third or fourth time the manager returned to our table, he offered to cut the bill by 25%. But it was too little too late. If money was the issue, we wouldn't be at Coast. We got the bill and left. I later discovered that when some of our family first arrived for the reservation, they were very crudely given a time limit of 2.5 hours for dinner. Hilarious. Coast couldn't even feed us in time to get us out of there on their own schedule.\\n\\nAs we left Coast, the entry way was chaotically stuffed with a crowd of bustling wet folks from outside.

Portland? \\"blue star donuts, forget voodoo, and get the signature buttermilk glazed.\\" \\n\\nThat was it. No lengthy discussion about why blue star was better or if there was room to consider other flavors. Intrigued by the confidence of this brief post, I re-routed to Blue Star. \\n\\nI thought it might be a little less touristy than voodoo, but the line was still 100% tourists, which made me nervous--was this donut shop all hype? I can get some pret-ty solid donuts in Boston, so I didn't need to wait in line for thirty minutes for a mediocre ring of dough 3,000 miles from home. \\n\\nBut we decided to risk the investment of time and waited patiently for our time at the counter. The flavors were amazing--matcha? pb&j? basil? By the time it was our chance to order, we had picked three, including, of course, the original buttermilk glaze. Due to a fortuitous mistake, we ended up with four donuts to split between two of us. \\n\\nThe contenders: key lime/lemon custard, cinnamon vanilla sugar, chocolate with buttermilk glaze, and original with buttermilk glaze. (I'll admit, the buttermilk glaze would not have caught my eye in the case, but I was going on friend's advice.) \\n\\nThey were all totally worth the wait. I like that there was a mix of regular donuts and cake donuts, and they were all amazing. And the clear winner? The original buttermilk glaze. \\n\\nSo now I can confidently share the same Portland donut advice with you!

I ordered the chicken n' dumplings with cornbread and broccoli slaw. The chicken stew beneath the light and plump dumplings tasted like it had come directly out of a fresh chicken pie. The heaping serving was full of vegetables and large, stringy pieces of chicken. I often wonder how I was able to pace myself through this meal....oh that's right, I didn't! The cornbread was firm and buttery, but did not have much of a lasting impression. Even less impressive was the slaw which used mayo as its main ingredient. Perhaps it was my first time trying broccoli slaw since I did not enjoy it. My boyfriend, who enjoys chicken fingers anywhere we go, was thrilled to see chicken fingers on the menu.

When you enter, there is a clipboard to write your name and your party - and be sure to read through the house rules while you're there. \\n\\nLet's start with beverages: the juices are expensive, but worth it. I had a screwdriver with the fresh-squeezed OJ, and it was amazing. I don't have fresh-squeezed juice often, so this was a real treat. \\n\\nI had a unique entree that resembled a cross between biscuits & gravy and eggs benedict. My fluffy, buttery biscuits were topped with ham, eggs, and then covered in gravy. My sister ordered an omelette, which was unlike any other omelette I've ever seen. It was served French-style, which means the eggs were extremely soft and airy, and the fillings were actually fillings in a egg pocket rather than all mixed in. It was extremely well-done and incredibly tasty. \\n\\nFinally, we couldn't not order one of the specials: the strawberry-rhubarb German pancake. Wow. I've never had anything like it. It was thick and fluffy, eggy, and crispy on the outside. I can only describe it as a hot, sweet, quiche. When paired with the berry syrup on the table... just amazing. \\n\\nI loved - LOVED - that all the dishes came to the table piping hot. Nothing is worse than cold eggs. To me this means Bijou takes great pride in ensuring their guests are able to taste the dishes as-intended.  I could even see the steam from dishes at other tables. Great timing and communication between the kitchen staff and front of house. \\n\\nService was excellent as well. It seems like it's a lot to ask for friendly service in Portland, and I was please that we received warm, friendly service without going off the deep end of being overly happy to serve us. Everyone we encountered was perfectly pleasant. \\n\\nWe couldn't have ended our PDX adventure in a better way - this was the type of food and type of experience we had hoped every meal would be on our vacation.

Both working late, dinner not looked after, a party to go to...I called them because they are close by, and could have a pizza for me ready in 15 minutes.  So I grudgingly placed my order.  \\"Grudgingly\\" because our last experience there was not that spectacular - over-priced and not \\"BAD\\", but just \\"UNREMARKABLE\\" food.  My wife said I dissed them for not using prosciutto in their veal saltimbocca, which definitely sounds like me, although I cannot verify that it was Paisano\\n\\nI was a pesky customer from the get go: asking the young lady on the phone how long would this take and how long would that take, not having a menu in front of me. Every time I ask, \\"How long would the lasagna take...\\" she said, \\"let me check\\"; she could tell that time was of the essence for this customer - so props to her patience and thoroughness.  I ordered the 14\\" (their \\"large\\", I found out after) \\"deluxe\\".\\n\\nPizza was ready to roll when I arrived (promise kept!)  Place was a-hopping on a Friday night, with lots of diners taking advantage of the patio on a beautifully warm December evening.  The drive home was just about 5 minutes, but I was already dreading the \\"steamed pizza\\" syndrome.  \\n\\nUpon laying into the pizza, we were pleasantly surprised.  I wouldn't quite say we were blown away, but my wife and I both deemed the pizza very good!  The deluxe turned out to be onions, black olives, green pepper, mushrooms (fresh), sliced sausage, ham, and hamburger.  The crust was totally delicious, and how it all came together was pitch-perfect.  For instance, the hamburger was not seasoned, and eaten by itself, was tasteless.  But in combo with the other ingredients, it worked great, giving it a beefy bite without offsetting the sodium balance!  Now did I over-rule my arteries and wished there'd been pepperoni, or perhaps a nudge more cheese?  Sure.  But as it was, this was the best pizza I've eaten in the last year, especially taking the \\"take-out\\" factor into consideration.  And they did it without \\"cheating\\", by making it too salty or overly greasy/cheesy.\\n\\nAt $17 + tax, this was not bargain pizza, and the main reason for coming short of 5 stars.  While I don't really begrudge them the \\"premium\\" pricing given how good the pizza was, there's something they could have done to make me a happier customer (or given me the option).  So here's a suggestion.  \\n\\nAnyone ordering a large, the order-taker could have provided the facts and the option, without making it sound like just a desperate up-sell.  \\"Just so you know\\", she could have said, \\"the extra large is only $2 more, and you'd be getting one-third more pizza (well at 16\\" compared to the 14\\", 31% more, but close enough)\\".  If the customer says that's the size he needs, she could point out that cold or reheated pizza the next day would have made it a much better deal - think of it as (incld. tax) feeding 2 people for $18, vs.THREE people for $20 (and change).  Indeed, by that same logic, the XXL, at $21 for 18\\" (two-thirds larger than the 14\\" for only $4 more) is a downright bargain.  You could even impart a useful math refresher tip: when it comes to calculating the surface area for a pizza, it is (pun and spelling mistake intended) 'pie'-r squared!\\n\\nFor next time, I have my eye set on the rustica if we're doing pizza again (that ghost of \\"bacon\\" haunting my psyche again!\\").  At some point, we may wish to give their other offerings a second chance.  Either way, glad to rediscover this meal option so close by."},{"name":"Thai Lagoon Bistro","address":"888 E Dublin Granville Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"I have been coming to Thai Lagoon at least once per week for the last five years.

I asked for an iced coffee with cream and sugar, and got \\"There's sugar right there on the table\\" as a snotty response.Once delivered, I had to take a large drink of black coffee in order to make room for the cream and sugar! I ordered the Count Gourdough Cristo sandwich. I loved the side of homemade chips, but was not impressed with the sandwich. Very small for a monte cristo.

It would have been fine if he would have said he forgot. Finally, the food was underseasoned -- all of it, from the fries to the burgers to the milkshake (although the candy cane milkshake may have been this way on purpose so as not to induce both ice-cream-cold and candy-sweetness at the same time).

Still, the bottom line is that it's a Greek invention. Plato's got patent pending.\\n\\nSo what has happened in the 2500 years since those primordial pizzas to make Italy far better at pizzas than Greek-run places like this? I'm not sure -  the relatively recent discoveries of mozzarella and tomatoes has probably got a lot to do with it though. And maybe the Romans. Where would we be without the Romans?\\n\\nIn any case, the ancient worlds collided when my Sardinian friend and I got takeout pizza from this Greek run takeout joint. What we experienced was a great illustration of why Greeks aren't famous for pizzas - on the whole they just don't care about the quality much. They'd rather provide a long list of possible pizza topping combinations and give you a big greasy pizza for a low price. With bad faded 1980s decor. And plastic chairs to wait on. And who can argue? After all, we only wanted some tasty junk food to gorge on whilst we watched Champions League round the corner. \\n\\nSo don't go here for the great pizza - there isn't any.

Yesterday, I took my daughter out to dinner at Bugatti's on Cedar Hills Blvd. When we entered  we could see that there were a number of open tables.. None-the-less, they had us wait 5-10 minutes to be seated. It took approx 5-10 more minutes for a server to approach and take our drink order. When he did, we ordered our dinners as well as our drinks. \\n\\nMy coffee was bitter  and very strong as if it had set too long. My caesar salad was crisp & perfectly dressed. The bread was tasty (although it would have been nice to have balsamic vinegar as an option.)\\n\\nThe salad and bread plates were never removed. When the entrees were delivered without a word & our server quickly disappeared. He did not check back. He dropped a refill of soda for my daughter on the way by, but I was not quick enough to ask for a refill of bread. I was never offered a refill of coffee.\\n\\nThe entrees were very good. My daughter loved her Chicken Parmesan. The Chicken was crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. By the time we finished dinner, the table was cluttered with dishes.\\n\\nWhen the server approached with a dessert menu  we declined & said we were ready to check out. He produced a check & left before I could give him the credit card I was retrieving from my wallet--resulting in another 5-minute wait.\\n\\nAll-in-all the food was very good but the service was lacking even though half of the tables were empty. \\n\\nBugatti's has the potential to be a VERY good restaurant but service brings it down to a 3-star rating. If they would work on service, I would be a regular customer."},{"name":"Phoebe's Diner","address":"533 W Oltorf St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Phoebe's is a super good breakfast spot.

I'm surprised it isn't more packed in the morning. If I was commuting downtown, I'd be in heaven sitting at the bar, sipping some good diner coffee, reading the paper.  Ahhhh, bliss.  The service is great.  There was one occasion worth mentioning where I ordered some pancakes that tasted like the buttermilk had gone bad. They gave us our money back and then some to compensate.

Service is fine, except for the fact that we weren't allowed to leave without paying $100 penalty, and it is small and therefore quiet, which is nice, but really, its the food that matters.\\n\\nIf you prefer food that tastes good in addition to being inventive, Uchi or Uchiko is far better."},{"name":"Dancing Goats Coffee Bar","address":"419 W Ponce De Leon Ave","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"I always order an iced-coffee black or an Americano, so I can't say much about their fancy coffee drinks.

I have been to Rafiki a few times before for things like drinks, a burger and some appetizers and things were ok. They certainly mix a great drink.

The restaurant was almost full (though not quiet) but severely understaffed. There were what looked like 2 servers being helped by the manager and hostess. \\n\\nOnce sat, we were not greeted for almost 20 minutes. When the hostess realized this she very graciously comped our first round of drinks. However, the problems just kept piling on. The food took a long time. We did not get our wine with the food, but had to remind them once the food came out. \\nThe oysters and clams were not washed well and were certainly not shucked well. There were bits of shell in almost every piece and it was obvious that they were opened from the wrong side as can be seen by the cracks. \\nI had a \\"beef burginion\\" but it was anything but that. It had no carrots and hardly tasted of wine. Just a chunk of (decent enough) brisket on mashed with green beans. blah. My husband's \\"steak frite\\" again was nothing like one would expect.

In college we used to go to the original one on Linworth and 161 for $0.10 wing night, now I frequent this one as it's closest to home.  I still stop in every now and then for lunch at the other locations and have the wings, although they are up to around $0.45ea now and recently they have started charging extra for celery and blue cheese/ranch.  Back in the good ol days they even gave away complimentary pieces of cornbread.\\n\\nOne of the main reasons I love the wings here is what you get for what you pay.  Compare a Hoggy's wings to one from BW3's and you'll find that the Hoggy's wings and drumsticks are twice to three times the size of the BW's wings for the same price, and they taste better.  I've had some big wings here, drumsticks the size of KFC chicken legs and I'm not kidding.  \\n\\nThe must try list:  Wings with Jamaican and Hoggy Garlic (formerly Honey Garlic) sauces, the onion rings, and the cornbread.  If you're a ribs fan the ribs are great.  If you get the loaded baked potato as a side...be warned, it is the biggest and best baked potato you will ever eat.  My other favorite is the smashed sweet potatoes...it's almost like eating dessert.  I also like the carolina pulled pork sandwich if I'm not  in the mood for wings.  \\n\\nThe desserts are to die for...be warned, they can feed a family of 4.  I remember having a birthday party at the Linworth store before it closed and having a slice of the chocolate cake...it fed myself as well as several of my friends.  All of the desserts are like this and they are outstanding.\\n\\nI find most items on the menu to be good and tasty.  They recently started serving steak, ribeye, it tasted like it was charcoal grilled.  Not bad.  \\n\\nOne of the things I am disappointed with is the tea and the lemonade.  The tea is no longer brewed.  It's great that they serve sweet tea in true souther bbq fashion...but it's terrible stuff that comes from a pop machine.  I'm not sure how they are making their lemonade but it must be with a syrup.  I remember that it used to be prepared fresh by the chef, then they went to having your server hand make your glass, now it's back to something bad.  Rest assured though, you can get a soft drink instead.\\n\\nThe other disappointment with this store is the service and the atmosphere.  The service here is hit or miss.  Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad and I don't even want to leave 10% as a tip, but I do since I eat here often.  My wife and I even considered having our wedding rehearsal dinner here but decided not to due to some of our family who would find the place a little low class.  At the original Linworth restaurant it was a tight fit, small space, great atmosphere.  All that's left of that store (due to whatever problem the owners couldn't workout with the building lease holders) is the original sign which is displayed in the bar.  I find it sad that this Hoggy's is wide and open and well lit.  Your server can slip away into the back for long periods of time...at the Linworth store you could always see your server, they had nowhere to go.  I think this has a lot to do with the service at this store.  \\n\\nRegardless of the service or the new location, I am a fan of Hoggy's and always will be.  At one point in my life I could eat 20 of their wings...now I can only handle about 5 with a side and that's dinner for me, followed up with a piece of cornbread for $.40, the perfect dinner.  Kids eat free on Wednesday with the purchase of an adult meal so we go there on Wednesday's a lot.  \\n\\nNext time you are craving wings, skip the disappointment of BWs, the high cost of Quaker Stake, and head over to Hoggy's and be wowed."},{"name":"Santarpio's Pizza","address":"111 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I love this place.

Both dishes came with basmati rice. We also decided to get some naan. \\n\\nThe cool thing about our dishes was that we got some nice hot, English style tea to drink to warm up from the cold weather. While the tea was not Indian Masala chai, it was decently creamy after putting a little cream in it.  \\n\\nI really loved both the Chicken and the Lamb dishes. The Chicken Tikka Masala at medium spice had a pretty good amount of spice to keep me warm. The chicken itself was very tender and not dry, making it probably one of the tastiest chicken meats I've eaten in an Indian restaurant so far. As for the Lamb Masala at mild spice, I did not detect much spiciness, but the meat was also tender, chewy and flavorful. They tasted really good with the basmati rice. As for the naan, it was fresh out of the oven and the Masala sauces were great enough to make the naan tastier. The dishes also came with this small plate filled some sort of cabbage. It had some spice and oil on it, but it was also tasty as well. \\n\\nBathrooms were really clean, almost like a hotel bathroom. Service was also pretty good. There's a giant flat screen TV that shows some old music videos from India.

Just seems like they've gone a little too far outside the box in attempts to be different but when you're in Texas some things just need to be kept traditional or at least format your menu to accommodate both types of consumer. Or maybe it's just me and this is some type of gourmet breakfast food that I don't understand but if that's the case maybe the title of diner, a description of traditional and a strip center location aren't the best indicators for a restaurant like that.

Oh no! This is going to be some crazy fusion BBH!\\"\\n\\nSo when the bowl came, I was expecting prawns. But there were none! Not that it was a bad thing, I was happy there were no prawns. I was happy the BBH was delicious! And so then I thought maybe they made a typo in the menu. I inquired and the guy said that they put PRAWN CAKE SLICES and pork cake slices. Ahh! It all made sense.\\n\\nOh and they have pretty interesting desserts for Pho. Deep Fried Banana w/Ice Cream. Tiramisu! Toasted Coconut Cake!? What! Might try that next time.\\n\\nWas it pricey? Yes!\\nWas it delicious? Yes!\\nWas it a clean restaurant? Yes!\\nWas the service good? Yes - They came to ask me how my food was tasting during my meal! This never happens at Pho!\\nWould I come back? Yes! I think it was worth $10.

After reading really great reviews, I had hoped this would be a great new place to grab donuts. We both ordered the hard apple cider fritter, and ended up having to wait 6 or 7 minutes to get them. I understand there were people in front of us with large orders... But how hard is it to grab two fritters off your racks and give them to us? I was highly annoyed and didn't want to eat the donuts there, so we left, got into the car, and I tried to take a chunk of my fritter to have a bite. It was difficult to do so, because it was extra crispy. I thought a little crisp would be good, and put it in my mouth. It was burnt. Burnt. How you hand select two burnt donuts to give someone is beyond me (His was also burnt). I cannot ever see myself coming back here again. I normally detest leaving terrible reviews, but I am so displeased. It's bad enough spending $6 on two donuts, but to have them be burnt?

I got a cheese pie.  Here's my opinion of it:\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed was the taste of cornmeal.  They use a lot of coarse cornmeal so they can slide the pizza off the peel into the oven, and it causes the slice to have a distinct cornmeal taste.  When I'm making a pie, I don't want people to first notice the stuff I use to keep the dough from sticking.  I want them to notice the great taste of the pizza.\\n\\nOf course, the most important part of the pie is the crust.  A bad crust is not worth all the great toppings in the world.  The good thing is that their crust is crispy and thin.  The bad thing is it lacks flavor.  I think they need to age the dough more.  I just had no desire to eat the crust... it was just too dry and flavorless.\\n\\nThe toppings were just good.  I got a cheese so I'm evaluating the cheese and the tomato.  I could tell they made their sauce with tomatoes instead of a premade canned sauce, which I appreciate.  However, the topping was not balanced.  The tomato was too strong, and overpowered the cheese.  Also, the crust was so thin in the middle that the center of the pizza was not crisp, but soggy and the too-wet sauce exacerbated this.\\n\\nYes, I'm being harsh.  I should be.  This is supposed to be a quality pizza place.  I wouldn't even bother writing a review of any of the dozens of crappy pizza places around where I live in Boston.  I make most of my pizza at home so I will only go out for pizza rarely, and only go back if it was exceptional.  To be honest, I was disappointed.  Most good places in NY are better.\\n\\nPS:  Any elite pizza place in the world needs to have a dedicated \\"pizzaiolo\\" running the show.  As soon as you relegate pizza-making duties to line cooks, you're going to take a quality hit, as does this place."},{"name":"Yak & Yeti Restaurant","address":"Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park 775 Werikhe Way","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Our friends were dining here and invited us to join them, so we did. \\n\\nThe weather was horrible outside, but inside it smelled delicious, and it was comfortable.

I have never had a bad meal or bad service from Wingnuts, and am so surprised by some of the bad Yelp reviews.\\n\\nWingnuts is exactly what I am looking for in a wings place. First and foremost, the wings are delicious. They have bone-in and boneless options, and SO MANY flavors. I partial to honey BBQ. My husband is partial to sweet Thai chili and garlic parmesan ranch.

Ordered it medium rare and asked for it closer to rare. Got a steak the shape of a doorstop, super thin and well done on one side and thicker and medium on the other. Also, they need a new butcher, it was barely recognizable as a ribeye. One of my dining companions had a similar problem. If this wasn't such a well respected restaurant, I would say they were dressing up cheaper cuts to look like ribeyes and charging $29 to fleece the steak eaters.

The setting is lovely and upscale in an way that is unusual for an Indian restaurant, and I was charmed to spy the buffet not in the main room, but set off in a little banquet room to the side. It was when I actually entered the banquet room that things went off. First of all, the fumes from the Sterno heating cans they use to keep the food warm fill the room, building up at the edges so that you have to kind of walk through this wall of gas fumes to get to the food. Not only was this unpleasant, but it has got to break some kind of health code, right? \\n\\nBut there was some good-looking food on the table, so I set aside the gas fume issue for the moment. On one table there was rice, dahl, an empty tray where malai kofta was supposed to be, aloo eggplant, an empty tray where tilapia tikka was supposed to be, lamb biryani, a watery-looking chicken makhani, and tandoori chicken that, interestingly, was not the pinkish-red color it usually is.\\n\\nOn the other table were some good-looking pakoras and samosas, along with several fine-looking salads, most of which I found puzzling in an Indian context, such as spinach with strawberries and something that looked like an upscale cole slaw. In front of the salads in fancy salad dressing containers were the traditional Indian condiments/sauces such as raita and tamarind, and to their right were two soups, confusingly, sweet potato soup and another that I can't remember but that didn't seem Indian at all either.\\n\\nSo, eating the food - the pakoras were delicious, and the samosa was tasty, with an unusual spice that made it just a little different than the norm. The chicken makhani was pretty good though watery, and the plain salad greens I got were very fresh and good. The not-pink tandoori chicken was pretty tasty too. The naan was alright, though it lacked the slight crispness from the tandoori and the coating of ghee that normally makes naan naan instead of just tasty flatbread. My husband tried the sweet potato soup, which was quite well-done if a bit sweet, but again, what does sweet potato soup have to do with Indian food?\\n\\nWe ordered some chai from our friendly waiter, and were surprised to receive a tall iced glass of (unsweetened) chai. It was kind of a cool surprise, an interesting idea, though I think the heat actually helps the flavors of the masala come out and up in the chai. Mostly what stood out in the iced chai was black pepper. Plus, it was $2.50 per glass, which is a lot to pay for something that you didn't even really order (since were understandably expecting hot chai and had no menu to tell us it would be iced).\\n\\nI made a second trip back to try to get some of that malai kofta, since it's one of my favorite dishes, but alas, it was still empty. My husband pointed out that the sauce was actually starting to dry up and stick to the tray. Oh dear. The tilapia was refilled, but I wasn't interested, so I decided to try the lamb biryani and the aloo eggplant. These dishes were pretty good, but somehow it didn't add up to \\"delicious meal.\\"  I did wish that there was some kind of cohesion to all these dishes - nothing related to anything else, no thought seemed to go into making the buffet a meal instead of a collection of random dishes. \\n\\nI went back again and found the malai kofta had finally been replenished - score! The usual small, slightly cigar-shaped form was replaced here by large meatball-shapes, in a sauce that was brighter and more orange than normal. Hubby and I split it just to taste - it was not bad, but the sauce was very tomato-y, too much so. He didn't even finish his half. I tried to use the sauce to dip the naan, but it just wasn't that good. \\n\\nAs I walked back and forth from the buffet, it struck me that in order to get from the dining room to the buffet room, we had to actually walk right between the kitchen door and the bussing station. I can't even imagine how annoying it must be for the staff to have to weave around customers wandering right in their work area as they try to do their jobs, and it didn't make me feel too comfortable either. I wonder why they chose to do this instead of putting it in the main hall, especially given the build up of Sterno in that little banquet hall?\\n\\nFinally, we tried the desserts - gulab jamun and kheer, two of our favorites! The kheer had fruit in it and was called \\"fruit pudding,\\" and it was not as bad as it could have been, but certainly nothing close to as good as kheer can be.  The gulab jamun looked promising, kept warm in a serving container, but the balls of dough were not firm, and some of them had actually come apart in the syrup, making the dish look unappealing. Going to eat it, the softness of it also made it taste unappealing, and the syrup had some kind of fruity or fragrant addition that I didn't like. Both dishes were left uneaten.\\n\\nMeh. On to the next Indian buffet."},{"name":"Truva Turkish Kitchen","address":"60 Andrew Young International Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My First and Last Turkish Experience \\n\\nFood: Mediterranean\\nAttire: Dressy Dinning\\nPrice: (baller status) \\nLocation: Downtown ATL near Georgia State\\nRecommendation: lo and behold \\n\\nI normally refrain from negativity and would much rather not do a review if I have nothing good to say; However, my experience at Truva was soooooooooo poor that I wish to spare fellow yelpers from the same.\\n\\nFirst, the only place to park is the public parking lot located adjacent to the restaurant (normally $5 per vehicle till 2am--it is downtown so this could be expected). The atmosphere had a retro-Moroccan slash Indian club/rave feel to it, which is perfectly okay with me because I prefer loud booming music to help ease my hunger and alleviate my ability to yell my order at the waiter. I guess it made some sense, seeing how they only had 6 guests (including myself and my significant other) on a Friday night, to crank up the music and make the place be seemingly busy.\\n\\nThe menu was relatively small consisting of maybe five appetizers, three choices of salads, two beef dishes, two chicken dishes, tres seafood dishes and the rest was made up of lamb and/or their counterparts. Oh, and a few desserts as well (it won't be a complete dining exp. w/o dessert). Please note that there is no wine menu or any kind of alchy served, but I believe the waiter said that \\"people usually bring their own.\\" I will remember to bring my cooler of bud and henny next time I come--thinking to myself at the time-. Seeing how half of the menu was devoted to lamb dishes, I thought it would be wise to order lamb with the suggestive belief that their specialty must lie here. After yelling out our order, we were then entertained by a live show performed in the reception area (yes the area where customer wait to get escorted to their table, but @ Truva they don't expect many guests so it is ok to host a live show there in the meantime). The show was prompt but full of energy: a disgruntled emp (now probably ex emp) storm out of the kitchen followed by a chef/cook with a spatula. Words were exchanged in the form of language that only a select few individual in the World's population could fully interpret and comprehend. Upon the finalization of the show, more oral precipitation exchanged while management intervened. \\n\\nAs we were waiting on our dinner, we were gladly stuffed with burnt pan toasted flat bread and oil with olives. \\n\\n20 min after order: appetizers arrived\\n1.) Calamari - resemble the dish that i had @ Bonehead's in Atlantic Station. This is probably the only dish that is notable but overpriced by about $5\\n2.) Shrimp stuff shrooms - I only took one bite. Had a very distinct aftertaste - - after you swallow the brown sugary glazing flavoring.\\n\\n30 min after order: entrees ....yum!!!..........NOT!\\n3.)Lamb Chops - Beautiful Presentation (nothing that a young lad from culinary 101 couldn't put together, but at least we know what the 30min wait was for). I eat most of my red meat medium rare and understand that different places have different medium rares. This medium rare was a lot more rare, but I cut into it and ate a piece anyways. When I neared the bone it was a little too intense so i went to the next chop and that one was even more rare than the last. At this pt, I totally wimped out and signal for the waiter. When I ask if I could have my dish cooked a little longer, I was told that because I've already eaten 1/2 a chop that they would gladly make a new dish. I smiled and said OKAY! The waiter picked up my dish and put it on the vacant table next to me, then left. WTF? 15 mins later a new dish of chops came out and to my expectation it was overally cooked, as a matter of fact, toasted. Not wanting to disturb our waiter again, I politely took the plate of uber cooked chops and put it next to its oozy red chop friends. YES, they did charge me for TWO plates, which is probably why she put the plate beside me -- thinking that I was going to take it with me or something *gags* \\n2.) On a brighter note, my gf shrimp pasta dish was equally unimpressive by her standards and was set aside after she ate all of the shrimps.\\n\\nOn to dessert:\\nAt this pt, I got slightly un-opionionated and allow my company to order the dessert for us. I believe there were three very nondescript items to choose from and our glorious waiter recommended the rice pudding (seeing that we were of Asian decent -- rice would be a smart rec, lol ...kidding). Blah Blah Blah ....rice pudding = overly cooked rice with calorie driven intent amounts of sugar.....served cold......just the way I like it....of course.\\n\\nMy dinning excursion for 2  totaled $114 + $20 tip + $5 parking\\n\\nI would give this place Zero Stars if I could.\\n\\nIf this is the only line that you are reading, then you must try this place!!!"},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Amazing donuts!

To be direct, there aren't a lot of options for anything out here, and the absence of a reliable pizzeria may be the most glaring. Signal Station stands out, being a quirky gas station renovated with a friendly (if slightly crammed) interior that retains the gas pumps outside. It really looks like a perfect find for a drop-in slice, and upon first impression you're likely to get that \\"Ah-ha!\\" vibe that will convince you prematurely that you'll be back again and again.\\n\\nSadly, the food doesn't hold up. Although the pizza is properly cooked, the crust is soggy and limp underneath, making for an unappetizing bite. The ingredients are poor (I admit I liked the sausage a bit) and don't provide much depth of flavor. Pizza doesn't have to be top-shelf quality throughout to be a fun, but when it becomes a chore to finish (who wants to chuck a half-eaten pie?) it feels more like a bad investment than a good time. I've previously confessed that I'm not a fan of cheese in general, but the cheese on our pizza was greasy and unappealing enough that it served better as a glue for sparse toppings than as an ingredient.\\n\\nNow here's the funny thing: I've eaten here twice with similar results, and I expect I'll probably go back there again. Unfortunately, there just don't seem to be quality options in the area that match up. You want convenience? Signal Station is will tide you over.

No matter..I was starving so I had no patience to go back and complain so I took a hopeful bite. The sandwich, even though it was vegetarian stunk of shrimp.

Large chunks of potatoes and minimal clams.\\n\\nWild Striped Bass - The fish was grilled and served with brown buerre blanc on the side. The fish fish itself had no taste and was undercooked (didn't flake when trying to cut into it). I then tried it with the sauce. Disgusting! Bad buerre blanc and was way too overpowering for a white fish. Very sloppy presentation.\\n\\nTabasco - when will chefs learn that Cholula is infinitely better!

Brothers Mark and Mike Black were going to use the name Black's Barbecue Austin, but Uncle Kent was not having any part of it. Kent Black, who manages the one in Lockhart, did not want to create any confusion for customers. To make things even more confusing/interesting, the owners of Black's are opening a location in Austin on Guadalupe. The brothers ended up naming the place after their father in his honor. Now that I got the family drama out of the way, let's talk about Terry Black's Barbecue. They have been open for over two weeks. I have been anxious to try them out, but I fought off the urges. I gave them a little bit of time to work out any kinks.\\n\\nTerry Black's does have a great location. They are located downtown which makes them a great lunch spot to meet up. Traffic getting there was a nightmare for me, but that is Austin for you on a Friday. When I arrived there to meet some friends for lunch, the parking lot was full. I wanted to meet after one in the afternoon to hopefully avoid the lunch crowd. Inside, the lines were relatively short. There were three chopping blocks so the line moved at a good pace. Everything on the menu was competitively priced. I order two slices of moist brisket, one pork rib, and a ring of the regular sausage.\\n\\nThe brisket was good. It was cooked perfectly. It was tender with a nice bark, and the fat was rendered well. Although it was good, I felt like it was missing something. More smoke and more flavor? The pork rib was tasty. It came off the bone without any effort and had a sweet glaze on it. The rib was cooked a little too long which made it a slightly dry for my preference. Terry Black's makes two types of sausage in-house. Regular and jalape√±o. The grit was coarse just the way it should be, and the fat content was ideal. It tasted fine, but the casing was hard and crunchy. Some of the meat was sticking to the casing. It was like the sausage had a candy shell coating. It was either cooked too long or too high or both? I tried both barbecue sauces they had. I liked both of them, but I prefer the mustard-based spicy sauce more.\\n\\nI am excited about Terry Black's Barbecue. Sure I was not blown away from the barbecue, but they are still relatively new. It is possible that their huge smokers are not well-seasoned yet. Though the barbecue is good, but they do show a lot of promise of being even better. They serve quality barbecue right in the heart of the city inside an air-conditioned building. I know I do not enjoy eating barbecue outside when it is 100 degrees in the blazing sun. This is the ideal place for me to take out of town guests too. Central, indoors, good Texas barbecue, short wait, and parking."},{"name":"Ristorante Serena","address":"18 Lebanon St","city":"Malden","stars":"4.5","text":"Nice place to eat. No complains.

First of all, it was $9, which isn't bad if you get a good burger and one big enough to satisfy a regular person, but this was embarrassing.  It had to be smaller than one of those junior patties on the McDonald's dollar menu.

I chose the appetizer. \\n\\nMeanwhile, I had posted on Facebook. One friend said she thought spaghetti was if you ordered it without cheese. One said \\"I have a friend who's a chef there and nearly everything has some sort of animal product. They also don't use separate cooking areas, etc...\\" Two thought the pizza with just sauce and veggies. Someone in Jersey said nothing. Another friend told me that at the Bertucci's by Alewife Station, the waitstaff can list the ingredients in the food. She also said that the rolls there are Vegan (Christin told me she thought they weren't Vegan and a friend told me that if you asked, they can make rolls without cheese). \\n\\nI don't understand why if Bertucci's can have a Gluten-Free menu, they can't have a Vegan one.

The leg of lamb was delicious and might have been the highlight, but when the waitress set it down she said - \\"oh, we're out of the sauce so we gave you a lemon wedge\\".  Really? Not even a sorry 'bout that? That seemed pretty offhand and again, careless. The trout in parchment was very bland.  The crab cakes were kind of rubbery and had a strange sweet flavor, and came a VERY sweet sort of chutney.  The eggplant parmesan was kind of a undecipherable pile - no parmesan or even cheese flavor detected, and again overly sweet.  Mostly, sweet tomato sauce, overcooked eggplant and oil.  Devil's food cake was good, but not memorable.  Our wine was delicious.\\nBelieve it or not though, I am willing to give it another try - more out of curiosity than anything else.

I get the trend these days to put the whole pantry on a burger but there are limits.  All of the elements were top notch, the beef was fresh and juicy, the roll way above average, but the net sum of it was disappointing.  I guess fried clams don't make everything better and it's sad to have to say it. The only thing I was not a fan of was all of the food, including the broiled fish special, came on metal trays with no plates, just a sheet of fake news paper.

I've finally had enough and will not be going back. \\n\\nEverytime I've gone in there I have been greeted by strange looks from the wait staff and managers and never really  understood why. The first time I went in with a couple friends and thought maybe the rudeness of the staff and the poor service was a fluke, yet this seems to be the norm. When I went in the second time the place only had about two tables taken. The hostess proceeded to lead us back to the furtherst table hidden behind a wall. Now at first, I justified this as just being due to servers sections and trying to seat each server. When I started noticing how the two waiters were standing there appearing to argue about who had to take us I was more than offended. The only reason I can think is because I'm young (in my early 20's) and some servers think people my age don't tip. I on the contrary worked in the restaurant business for 4 years and always tip well. Even though they couldn't possibly know this that fact that they're standing 4 feet from the table appearing to argue about this was ridiculous. When the loser of the arguement begrudgingly made their way over to the table we were greeted with an icey demeanor that only added to our level of discomfort. The food was good--not outstanding but good, but when my friend was served a soda sans carbonation she was extremely hesitant to tell the server since she didn't want him to be mean about it. This fact alone is preposterous. A restaurant's patrons should have a feeling of comfort and graciousness not shame over having to request something. When she finally did ask if she could have another soda the guy seemed pissed. When he went over and got a new one he started pointing at us again with the guy manning the bar! At this point I was fed up with the place and was happy to leave after the meal, still leaving an undeserved 20% tip.\\n\\nAlas, my want for Indian food came over me again and I finally decided to go back. I found a coupon for $10 for a $25 gift certificate on restaurant.com and this solidified my decision. I still was wary of the place because of how I was treated but decided to give it one more shot. What a mistake that was. My friend and I decided we would order delivery in order to save the humiliation we feel everytime go in. I made sure to read the fine print on the gift certificate to make sure it didn't say anything about not being valid on delivery. I copy and pasted the exact restrictions below:\\n\\nMinimum purchase of $50. 18% Gratuity added prior to discount. Valid for Dinner, Food ONLY. Excludes: Other Offers/Promotions. Not valid for special dinners. Not valid toward special dinner for 2. Not valid on buffet. Valid for Dinner menu only. Valid only one per month/per party. No split checks . \\n\\nIt looked like I was in the clear until I called and made me order. At the end I mentioned the gift card, gave the number, and offered them the validation phone number in case they wanted to call. The guy started laughing at me and said I was making this up. I was so furious I wanted to hang up on him right then. I then told him no, and I would just bring in the stupid certificate and pick up the food (basically just to prove him wrong). When I went in and said I was picking the food up the cashier called over the manager pointed at me and said my name to him and started laughing at me while holding the coupon. I was confused on what was funny and again on how you can be so overtly rude to a paying customer (even if it was discounted). The man then continued to tell me I couldn't use it because it says no take out on the coupon. I informed him I had already read all the restrictions and this was not one of them. He started pointing at where it said \\"Valid for Dinner food ONLY\\". I told him I was under the impression this meant I couldn't use it at lunch. He just started laughing at me, yet again, (seems to be a theme) and finally just said \\"I'll take it this time but not again\\" like he was doing me some sort of favor. I graciously thanked him and went ahead to pay. I didn't ask for an itemized receipt becaus I was in a hurry to get out of there but the check somehow ended up being $37. With the certificate that would mean our meal was $62 for 2 curry dishes and 3 $4 orders of naan. I honestly  just didn't care at that point, paid the bill and left. \\n\\nNeedless to say, I will not be returning ever again. The rudeness of the staff cannot outweigh the mediocre food. I love supporting local businesses in JP and am sad that I have to cross this one off my list completely, but Bukhara's staff and their horriblely rude and offensive service has lef me now choice. \\n\\n*I know this is an epically long review but I'm still steaming about my encounter.*"},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I brought my husband and son here for my husband's birthday tonight.

Aside from the fact that communal plate sharing and the serving of raw meat is absolutely horrifying to me on multiple levels, I simply do not care for the flavor profiles of most Ethiopian dishes and absolutely despise the sour taste and ShamWow-like texture of injera. Nonetheless, I can appreciate well-executed food when it crosses my plate. That being said, Desta is arguably the most authentic Ethiopian dining experience that you're going to find in Atlanta. \\n\\nFood: The menu at Desta features an impressive assortment of traditional Ethiopian offerings, including kitfo, dulet, shiro, and various tibs. During my recent visit, our party opted for the vegetarian and meat lover combos. The vegetarian combo included an assortment of approximately eight different items such as fir-fir, fit-fit, shiro, and various wats. The meat combo included our choice of three different meats (beef, lamb, and chicken). Both dishes were served with an unlimited supply of injera. Although I wasn't particularly impressed with the flavor of the food, it was generously portioned and expertly prepared.\\n\\nService: Both takeout and dine-in service are available. The staff are generally friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient. During my visit, the waiter, as well as I woman I presume was the manager, checked-up on our table throughout the meal at appropriate intervals.\\n\\nAtmosphere: Casual and clean. The interior dining room is somewhat cramped, so I would recommend sitting on the outdoor patio if the weather is cooperative. Inexperienced diners should also note that the restaurant does not furnish silverware; however, hand sanitizer is located at each table for your convenience and continued survival. \\n\\nCost: Inexpensive. Appetizers are $3-$6, sandwiches are $7-$9, salads are $5-$7, and entrees are $8-$13. Wines are $6-$8 per glass and $20-$25 per bottle.\\n\\nOther: Desta is located in the Williamsburg Shopping Center at the corner of Briarcliff and Clairmont.

I have told every friend about this restaurant. Every time I go, I am reminded of how good they are. Their flavors have never disappointed me. I've been here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner before.\\n\\nFor breakfast, I've tried the Foul and their Scrambled Eggs with Prime Ribeye Steak. I really like the Foul. They also come with fresh baked bread and I like to put the crushed beans and diced onions, tomatoes and pepper inside the bread. Delicious. The scrambled eggs with steak was okay. \\n\\nFor appetizer, I've tried the Kitfo Wrap and the Kitfo Slice. I LOVE these two. I order at least one of these every time. I always order it rare. I used to order the wrap all the time. If you're by yourself, it can be considered a light meal like any wrap with meat inside. Recently, I've been more into the slice. If you don't mind the oil, it's truly a delicious bite. I love the jalapeno peppers because it leaves a perfect kick in your mouth in combination with the meat. This appetizer isn't for everybody though. I love the meat rare. Kitfo is steak tartare so to me, it's best when served rare. I've had friends who loved it too, but my aunt and sister tried it before and weren't fans because the meat was rare. Let the waitress/waiter know how you want it served. This doesn't disappoint. Great start to your meal at Desta.\\n\\nFor entree, I've had their Lamb Tibs, Ribeye Tibs, Filet Mignon Tibs, Chicken Tibs, and Fish Tibs before. I love their lamb and ribeye. They're my favorite. The flavors are amazing. These two are my go-to. If you're with a friend and are true carnivores, then order the meat lovers entree. It won't disappoint. Everything at Desta is so flavorful. For their side, they have this beets and potato dish that I just love. It's a little sour and I love it. I have also tried the Shiro and Miser before. Once again, so so so flavorful. If you look at the stuff hanging on the wall, you will see that they are well known for their Vegetarian Platter. I tried it once before moving away and I have been craving for it ever since.

I ended up at Bartaco by chance really when a group of random young professionals got together here for a dinner club event.  Perk #1, the complimentary valet--zoom right up.  As I walked in to meet the hostess, I instantly noticed how inviting the bar was--what a great place this is going to be for me to come hang out.  The restaurant itself is all open air when the weather is right, with garage doors that open along 2 sides of the restaurant.  The walls--take note of all the local photography.  The ceiling--check out the wicker-woven light fixtures--are you feeling tropical yet?  The best part is the outdoor dining...the garage doors open on to a large patio that is surrounded by a white fence adorned with green vines and hanging above are romantic strings of white lights.  Catchy music is in the background.  Yes, this vibe is me.  Are we even in ATL anymore?  It's like Naples, FL or Cali coast, really.\\n\\nSo it sounds like from some reviews that early on they may have had a few kinks like all restaurants do, but there was no hint of newness flaws tonight.  But, at this point, they have been open 3 weeks and they have found their groove. \\n\\nThe 13 of of us settled down outside and started out with...wait for it...PITCHERS of delicious cocktails.  They have a witty list to choose from and a few them are available in super-sized party versions.  The mojito was my favorite and this was no standard mojito--sleek and smooth--they actually juice all the limes per order so no pulp to choke on.  We started chatting it up over the guacamole and salsa verde (which was surprisingly fantastic).  Check out this taco list! Fish, pork belly, chicken, chorizo, portobello, fried oyster, curry shrimp, wild boar, sesame ribeye, and duck! The tacos come by orders of 1, 3, or a chef-picked tray.  Since we had a large group and we wanted to try everything, we decided to order family-style.  We got several taco trays for the table which came out with about a dozen tacos, 2 tamales and a few sides per tray.  I didn't get to try every taco--LOL, Miss Piggy--but I did try 4 or 5, which was plenty.  My favorites were the pork belly, duck and the sesame steak.  I think the hand-held size is perfect so you can try quite a variety and they were all packed with meat, wedged in soft corn tacos.  Tamales were also a hit and worth ordering a la carte if you don't go for the tray.  The must-have sides are the grilled corn (a diced cob blended with cayenne, lime, and cotija cheese) and the chipotle slaw.  I am the pickiest person ever about my slaw and I loved this slaw!  Throw some on your tacos and just shove it your mouth.  \\n\\nWe laughed and talked and enjoyed the beautiful evening--there was this perfect little breeze that would dance on our shoulders every few minutes just to remind you that these are the kind of experiences that life is all about.  \\n\\nTo top it of, our waiter Mario was super sexy as he waltzed over with our tray of ice cream cones.  The coconut ice cream was possibly the best coconut ice cream I have ever had--not too overwhelming with coconut flakes, you know?  Just creamy wonder. I love when hot guys serve me ice cream.  \\n\\nThere is no question that I will be at Bartaco all the time.

And best thing? The Pa Los Gringos is just 10 bucks for a large amount of food!  The Cachapa Pabellon was also a massive amount of food (definitely feeds two girls) and really delicious. It is a corn pancake, with real corn kernels in it, stuffed with everything you would want at a Venezuelan restaurant: savory beef cooked until it falls apart, rich black beans, sweet fried plantains, and, of course, cheese. \\n\\nAnd, it doesn't get crazy busy on Sunday mornings unlike some other places, which is great for eating in groups!

A large patio space outside hosts a number of tables with umbrellas and spots in the sun, water fountains around, beautifying the space and the calming sounds of the peaceful neighborhood coffee shop and roasteria. Ava's is open 24 hours and offers free wi-fi.\\nWhat I ordered: Being my first time at Ava's, I was happy to partake of the recommendation of my friends, and opted for Ava's Very Veggie ($6.50). I ordered half of the toasted sandwich on a ciabatta roll (made at a local bakery); garlic aioli, pesto, tomato, fresh mozzarella and spinach. On the side, I ordered half of a spinach salad ($1.00 more) with candied pecans, red onion and feta cheese, drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette. One dining companion ordered the full Very Veggie, toasted, with Ava's House Salad ($3.50), spring mix of greens, crumbled feta, dried cranberries and pecans. She also returned for a blended mocha ($4.75) with real caramel and real milk chocolate, topped with whipped cream. Another dining companion ordered the chicken cordon bleu sandwich ($7.50) - wheat bread, grilled chicken breast, ham, provolone, tomato, red onion and spring mix, toasted. He also enjoyed a strawberry smoothie, which was creamy and slightly sweet, but not sweetened. Our last eating dining companion ordered the chicken cordon bleu sandwich, toasted, on ciabatta, with a side Greek salad ($6.25) made with tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, feta and a Greek-style dressing. She also enjoyed a vanilla cappuccino blended beverage topped with whipped cream and caramel sauce. The two who introduced us to Ava's opted for coffee beverages. One ordered a large real milk chocolate mocha. The other, a blended Oregon chai and a cream cheese turnover ($2.95).\\nWhat I loved: The salad was awesome! The sandwich, warm, fresh and full of flavor. The strawberry smoothie perfectly unsweetened and filling. The blended mocha sweet, with a rush of caffeine and a great dessert.\\nWhy I loved it: The company and enjoying food in the sun outdoors, peacefully and un-rushed made for a fabulous dining experience. If I lived closer, I would thoroughly enjoy the 24-hour establishment more regularly!\\nCost: Average ($6-$8 for sandwiches)"},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This place was packed for a Tuesday morning. My friend and I arrived here around 11:30 and there already seemed to be a 30-40 person line out the door. We went inside, put our name down, and the hostess said it would be about 45 minutes--no problem, as we had plenty to do since it's downtown with some shops all around. \\n\\nFrom what I could tell initially, this place is very very popular, with cute decor all around and a coffee bar close to the front entrance....we went on our way to meander around a bit and came back exactly 45 min later--and about a minute later we were seated! Perfect timing.\\n\\nWHAT WE GOT:\\n\\n1) I got the Mocha with white lavender pistachio rose with soy milk---actually really good! I really tasted the rose in the mocha, and it wasn't overpowering.\\n2) Poisson Lem Marrakech--poached egg, cured salmon,wheat berries, pistachio salad with sesame yogurt : my friend and I really enjoyed this, especially the cured salmon! For $17 it was a bit pricey but I especially enjoyed the crunch from the pistachio and addition of the wheatberries.\\n3) Avocado Toast: on grilled focaccia, with a tomato salsa and egg on side..this was a different version than what I was imagining but none the less good, I just which the portion was a bit bigger for $6.\\n4) Liege style waffle: with the white choc pistachio rosewater---we shared 1 which I think was enough since we shared everything else. The liege was piping hot, a bit chewy, a bit fluffy, but a very nice sweet snack. I do prefer the Blue Bottle liege waffles in SF though!\\n\\n\\nOverall food was pretty good, it was super busy so service wasn't great (our waiter forgot about our waffle and didn't really check in on us).

Plus, a very deep, diverse menu with a lot of options, including a full slate of options for kids. It's family friendly in that way. I didn't have any this time, but they have a nice selection of micro brewed beer.\\n\\nThe bad: the prices are a bit steep, so it can't just be your neighborhood weekly place, since it is a bit overpriced. They have a ton of TVs so when we walked in, I asked the bartender if they could put one of the TVs on the Astros-Braves game and she said she would but never got around to it. \\n\\nMaybe it's because it's a chain, not sure why, but our server was over zealous. As someone who used to wait to tables, it's always better to check too much on a table than too little, but we couldn't even get a bite of food in our mouth before the server was in our faces asking how the food was - \\"don't know, haven't eaten a bite yet - it just arrived this second\\" - was my response with both the appetizer and dinner.\\n\\nIn addition, when you're dealing with a toddler, if you look at him and ask him if he wants \\"chocolate\\" he will say yes - which is why a good server should be thoughtful of parents and look at the parents and simply ask if we want dessert - we had to cut our server off in mid sentence since we knew our son would create a problem being offered chocolate and us having to say no. Not OK for the server to go past us just to try and make a buck. \\n\\nThe manager was a nice game and came over afterwards to check on us so overall, they are friendly, but they could relax a little more & have their servers tamp down their upselling and overzealousness. \\n\\nIn addition, while the adult meals they brought us were good and had nice presentation, my son ordered mac n cheese and it was clearly the same 'instant Kraft' we could make him at home. \\n\\nOverall, I'd go back but they need fix a few things."},{"name":"There","address":"305 Brookhaven Ave, Ste 1200","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Visiting Atlanta for the weekend and searched the web for the best burgers in ATL. \\"There\\" was high on the list and I thought the name clever so why not. \\n\\nThe weather was good and we made use of Their outside seating.

I've read a lot of good reviews on this place, so I had real high expectations. For my first visit, I went during the lunch hour, since I wanted maximum food tasting and minimum price paying. They have a nice buffet for $6.99, so that works just fine for me!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Clay Pit is in its own building, and it is a beautiful one once inside. It looks like they have at least two dining areas on the main floor, plus an upstairs and a downstairs. Their buffet was immediately to the left of the entrance, and the smell of the food was very inviting. I opted to sit in the bar area since there weren't as many people there. Note-to-self: next time, come either later or earlier if eating in, since the place gets PACKED!\\n\\nI came on a Friday, and their buffet offerings were exactly what I had been craving. They had a creamed corn soup that was so creamy and complemented the naan very well. Upon sitting and getting your drink order, they bring you out a basket of naan. I also sampled the Aloo Ghobi, Veggie Korma, Chicken Tikka Masala, Tandoori Chicken, and of course, the glorious Indian basmati rice. I did really well this time, pacing myself, and getting just enough to be able to sample. In fact, I made myself a table of little tapas, maybe a spoonful or two of each of the dishes. I saw their Kheer and wanted to make room for it, since I had a hunch I might be having a bowl or two of it. (And I did!)\\n\\nThe food was simply amazing. Back in Boston where I used to live, there was an Indian restaurant I frequented on Newbury Street called Kashmir. It is my all-time favorite place to go for Indian food, and I must say, the Clay Pit comes very close to matching Kashmir.\\n\\nI highly recommend this place. The price cannot be beat, but most importantly, the food is just darn good! I came back to try the \\"Butter Chicken\\" that I read about in other reviews, which they serve on Saturday, and well, it was okay, but be warned that the Saturday buffet, inexplicably, is $1 more at $7.99. The Saturday buffet is an \\"expanded offering,\\" but I didn't find that much of a difference from the other weekday I was here. They have a rotating buffet menu from Monday to Saturday, and no buffet at all on Sunday. I haven't yet tried ordering a la carte, but I figure why would you, with the buffet offering so much selection?\\n\\nUPDATE 1: I've since gone back twice, but got the buffet to go. They give you one large container and two small containers. Let's just say that with some creative packing, I managed to get enough food for both lunch and dinner... and a little breakfast the next day.\\n\\nUPDATE 2: Got the buffet to go again... Ummm, I think I will not be having Indian food for a LONG while. I've had my fill. :-)\\n\\nUPDATE 3: The price of the buffet has gone up to $7.49. I guess everyone is having to make adjustments in this wacky economy. Still a pretty good deal, but I guess it's psychological that it's no longer under $7.00."},{"name":"Uno Pizzeria & Grill","address":"280 Huntington Ave.","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"John and Lori are amazing on the bar and always provide amazing service!

I was trying to be good and ordered sparingly. Yeah right! I HAD to go back for seconds and then I found something new. \\n\\nRound 1, I tried the brisket and pork ribs, which happened to be fresh out of the oven. See my pic for the array of meats laying on the cutting board for you to choose from. I asked for a rare piece of brisket, but apparently it cooks so long there's no such thing as rare cuts here. No problem, it was so soft, moist, and flavorful, it practically did melt in my mouth. The pork ribs also were so soft, it didn't take much tugging of the teeth for the meat to fall right off the bone. Both meats were super flavorful in their own right and definitely worth trying some of each. I did get some green beans, which were OK, but save room for the meat. \\n\\nRound 2, I wanted to try the beef rib, which they claimed was the best. It was a little fatty hut. awesome. It was clearly a three way tie, each with their own unique smokey flavors, but all with ultra soft and moist textures. You have to be hungry or have someone to split the big beef ribs with. It was $20 for just one huge rib on its own with no side. I also got a jalape√±o cornbread for the plane ride which was nothing spectacular, but only $1.\\n\\nMake time for a 5 minute free tour of the smokers outside. I met James, one of the master stoker/smokers, and he was really cool taking time to explain the heating and rotation process (see pics.)

The main issues were:\\n1. When we walked in, there was no host/hostess to seat us. Instead, there was a woman sitting at a reception desk on the phone who failed to acknowledge our existence despite me trying to make eye contact with her multiple times. After about a minute of this awkwardness, one of the waiters finally flagged down the host.\\n2. The chicken fajitas for two was very unimpressive for multiple reasons. First, it was more like a single serving of chicken (about two breasts), and the peppers and onions were almost raw. It was actually not surprising that they were almost raw, since there was not one iota of steam coming off of the platter when they brought it out. It's amazing to me that they went to the trouble of buying the iron skillets, but they aren't even using them for their intended purpose.\\n3. The waitress had no idea what she was doing. First, she brought me and my wife two different sizes of bean/rice/lettuce plates to go with our fajitas (my wife's plate was normal size, and mine was about half that size). When I said something, at first she tried to brush me off, but upon my insisting, she finally brought me a normal size plate. Second, at the end of the meal after she had swiped my credit card and I had signed the receipt, she came by and picked up the receipt while we were still sitting there. Everyone in the restaurant industry knows this is extremely impolite, because she was effectively checking to see how much we had tipped her while we were still in the restaurant. Luckily, I'm a good tipper.\\n4. The bathroom was a disaster. First, there was an oily substance on the floor, so I almost slipped on the way in. Second, the toilet was nasty, with urine all over it. Third, the little knob on the sink faucet Fell off while I was using the sink because it had been improperly assembled. I won't even go into the fact that there were random wires sticking out of holes in the wall.\\nAs I said, this place is not worth going to in its current state.

The staff are so friendly, manager is delightful. They make an effort to get to know me and I feel valued as a regular customer. Only thing I can complain about is the fact that they don't seem to know how to keep up with demand.

They have a wide variety of sweets but some of our favorites include:  lychee macaron, chocolate tart (they make this occasionally but it's seriously the best!), tiramisu, and raspberry gelato!\\nChocolate Tart (6.5/7)\\n\\nThis is amazing!  The entire tart is made out of this solidified type of mousse that's extremely creamy but not too sweet.  The chocolate isn't too overpowering even though it's very dark, and we thought that it was a lot less bitter than other chocolate tarts that we have had.\\n\\nLemon Tart (5.5/7)\\n\\nThis sour treat was loved by only a few of us.  The tanginess of the tart was definitely enough but unfortunately, it was just too sour. \\n\\nChestnut Cake (6/7)\\n\\nTo be honest, we've only had chestnut cakes made in Asian bakeries before!  We wanted to try this as soon as we saw it and we have no regrets!  This was made very well as the ratio of chestnut to chocolate tasted perfect.\\n\\nTiramisu (6.25/7)\\nThis is honestly a piece of art.  The tiramisu here is made beautifully and we've tried both the small individual size and the full size.  Even though the tiramisu isn't authentic, the aesthetics of the cake makes up for it!  The taste is quite good and we always come back for more.\\n\\nPear Cassis Charlotte (4.5/7)\\nThis wasn't very good.  Saying this so bluntly makes us want to apologize to the patissiers of Thierry but this cake was honestly not good.  We only ordered this because it looked really nice but it was honestly very plain and something that we could never order again.  The green outer shell was questionable and didn't taste very good. \\n\\nOpera Cake (6/7)\\nThis is a very dense cake that is comprised of hazelnut sponge, chocolate ganache, butter cream, and coffee.

However, I have to say: Did you restaurant planners not consider that AT ALL? How about being Tavern ON the Square, or Tavern in A Square? You could have avoided this situation.\\n\\nTavern in the Square is one of the area bars where University of Michigan fans congregate to watch games. Living someplace where Wolverines are relatively rare, I appreciate hearing a roar from the crowd whenever U of M made a good play. Fun atmosphere for fans.\\n\\nThe beer selection is surprisingly good for a restaurant that takes its style cues from Pizzeria Uno. They have about 15 beers on draft, including a good selection of New England brews and a few rotating taps. All beers are available in pints or tall 23 ounce pilsners, and prices for the large ones seem to hover around $7.\\n\\nThe food . . . oy. You know when the menu has over 10 pages and covers a range of world cuisines that you're dealing with a jack of all trades and a master of none. I opted to play it safe with a burger, which was fine--very slightly overcooked, slightly burnt bun, but overall decent. It came with a huge mountain of fries. My husband's chicken sandwich was even more mediocre than the burger, though he too enjoyed a ludicrously large pile of fries (waffle, in his case).\\n\\nNext time I come back to Tavern in the Square (do not type acronym, do not type acronym . . .) for a U of M game, I'll stick to beers.

There was a small bar area, but there was a couple sitting there, so there was practically no where to sit.  I would recommend a waiting area with benches.  Since it was cold that evening, we all wore thick outercoat, but we were not asked for hanging our outcoat until 25 minutes later.  We were standing by the entrance of the door, kind of embarrassing to block the diners getting in & out.  We have been having enough time to watch the operation of the open kitchen, and found them very streamlined and smooth by knowing what they were doing.

I was back in the city for a week, so I decided to check it out. After queuing for 1/2 an hour or so, we managed to get our table. \\n\\nService was really genuine and friendly which is refreshing! I had a cappuccino while my friends opted for the raspberry caramel lattes (apparently it's that good). One of the best cup of coffee I've had in the city, honestly. \\n\\nBelgian waffles arrived cold, and they were okay. The lavender/milk chocolate topping wasn't to my taste, but the mixed berry compote was good and not too sweet. My fricasse arrived in a skillet pan (great presentation) and I immediately tucked in. The braising sauce was SO good, and the poached eggs when combined with the meat, and a bit of watercress to cut the heaviness of the dish was divine. I barely ate bread because the small cubed potatoes were actually quite filling.\\n\\nDecor reminds me of restaurants that you would find in New York with the vibe of Lower East Side or Meatpacking District.

In my opinion, it tasted awful...the man said it tasted average to him.

The man had the Pollo Ripieno - it lived up to my description in the previous review...tasty risotto...ok stuffed chicken...kind of a mess of a presentation.  I ordered Filetto di Manzo - Filet mignon with saut√©ed porcini, Portobello, and shitake mushrooms in our chef's gorgonzola cream sauce -  $25.5  Sounds good right?  BOOOOOOOO!  I received my plate at it looked like I had ordered a chopped steak smothered in gorgonzola stroganoff sauce.  WTF?  Doesn't filet mingnon conjure up a specific image in one's mind?  Was this filet butterflied and then tenderized to the point of resembling roughly chopped beef?  Why?\\n\\nThen the bill came...with tip was just over $100 for a glass of wine, a bottle of pellegrino, an appetizer, a salad, 2 entrees.

I've had almost all the tacos, the corn, the tamales, the guac, the beans, the bowls and it's always consistently tasty.  The service is usually pretty good as well.  I really like the ordering system; you mark down what you want on a paper menu and they pick it up.  I think it definitely cuts down on incorrect orders.  What also helps is how simple the menu is.  It's pretty straight forward so substitutions and/or modifications to items are less likely and as a result, you will probably get exactly what you wanted.  \\n\\nThe reason I can't rate this place higher is the price.  When you first look at the menu, you think \\"oh, that's a pretty good price; only $2.50/$3.50 each taco\\".  But the tacos are small and you need anywhere from 4-8 tacos per person depending on how much you eat.  On top of that, the drink prices are crazy high.  A can of ordinary beer is $7 and the mixed drinks are about $12 if I remember correctly.  It easily adds up.  Dinner for two with a couple drinks each cost me $75 + tip.  That's about $90!  cRaZy!  NOT the kind of place I should be spending $90 at. smh!\\n\\nHere's my recommendation, go here AFTER you grab a bite to eat at Delia's Chicken Sausage Stand down the street.

The tomatoes, cheese and basil did come together in that nice \\"soupy\\" consistency you want to see, but the crust. The crust was not good at all. It was definitely overbaked and I'm afraid they may be firing the oven at low temperatures, which leads to a dried out and charred up crust. Too long in the oven?

The sauce is tangy, the cheese is gooey, and the crust has a nice flavor that you can only get with a brick oven.

Anyway, years have gone by and suddenly I see it's the 'Best in Austin' for years straight and friends are talking about how great it was.  I guess it was worth another shot.  First off, this place is BUSY.  The parking lot and the food lines are akin to driving in the Fiesta parking lot (either one will do as they both are pretty much packed with horrible drivers).  The interior decor is actually somewhat tasteful and lots of natural light.  Lunch buffet was $8.50!  They have a TON of choices, TON!  I started off with their 'sushi' rolls.  They had all kinds of weirdness that I've A. Never seen.  B. Would NEVER thought of.  They had one roll that was topped with spicy Cheetos!  CHEETOS ON A ROLL!  I ate pretty much my whole plate of weird sushi rolls and enjoyed them about as much as you can at an all you can eat \\"Chinese\\" buffet.  Don't you look at me that way!  I then moved onto the hot food.  I had some Generals chicken and terriyaki.  The General's was OK and the Terriyaki was actually pretty good.  Kinda like the stuff you get from the mall food court.  I say that in the best way possible.  Who doesn't like a giant to-go box stuffed with fried rice and grilled chicken slathered in sauce for $6-7!?!?  I think from there I tried their beef and pork bulgogi.  I've had the pork version at a real Korean place and LOVED it.  This stuff?  It was pretty damn gross.  I had a couple of bites and probably made the same face you did about the spicy cheeto rolls and pushed it aside.  The beef version was freaking GOOD!

I usually get dessert to go since I'm way too stuffed from the buffet. The staff is always friendly as well.  Be ready for a wait to get a table as they always seem to be crowded.

Simply the best falafel, salatim and Laffa this side of the Mediterranean. So fresh, so flavorful. Had it with Israeli pickles, pickled cabbage, hummus and tahini sauce. The Laffa is thin, chewy, crepe-like. Their homemade sodas are also delightful--not too sweet, very flavorful. I had the tarragon-lime. I also sampled the Shawarma (chicken) which was delicious and succulent (though they need a sharper knife and an experienced carver--I got chunks instead of shaved curls, which were difficult to chew). The only thing they should ditch is the pita. I know they make their own, but it's dry and crumbly, not the fluffy, chewy kind that really makes an Israeli or Arab falafel (technically Israeli pitas are smaller and fluffy; Palestinian Arab style is wider and grill-marked but also fluffy; Lebanese style is much thinner).  If they can't fix their pita dough, they might consider using Eli's pitot from Best Bread Baking Company, which are possibly better than the best Arab style pitas I've had in the Middle East. Cannot wait to try the Labne (yogurt cheese with za'atar) and the Sabich (Iraqi Jewish egg and eggplant sandwich with Amba, a fermented mango hot sauce) and the Skhug (Yemeni hot pepper and tomato sauce).

I'm embarrassed to be a Nigerian right now and sad that it seems like incompetence is an inherent trait.

Last time I was here I had MEAT! My guy is a 'vegimeatarian' and eats meat on the weekends. \\n\\nAs usual HD was packed. The lines are kind of confusing, we got bumped back about 10 people and given margarita's for being \\"good sports\\" by the manager. It's sort of awkward, he's always dressed in muggle clothing so you never really recognize him. Great idea on his part!\\n\\nJanis Joplin and Poblano Burger. Our fries didn't have enough seasoning - not like the first time! Still amazing covered in their kick-butt mustard! The boy happily ate his, no complaints. \\n\\nThey have some great brews on tap, Live Oak and (how fitting!) Jester King. Try the Commercial Suicide.

It is situated in a very secluded area and you won't even spot it at first. \\n\\nHospitality: The lady who served us made us feel like home, and was very kind. I have tried Ethiopian food earlier but this was my first in ATL, and it was a good choice. They have a 20% discount on your first check-in so don't miss out on that!\\n\\nFood: We tried the veggie plate and it was A LOT for 13 bucks (we had to get a to-go box in the end as we got tired of eating). The veggie plate was amazing, served with lentils and rich in nutrients and no oils (for all you healthy food goers out there). We tried the Ethiopian coffee too (which serves two people, with three rounds of servings each), and it was very strong. \\n\\nAmbience: Surrounded by traditional photos and furniture, it brings a sense of belonging to Ethiopian culture.\\n\\nOverall, a good ethics restaurant with amazing, oh-my-god-I-can't-eat-more food."},{"name":"Bukhara Indian Bistro","address":"3698 Washington St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is good or really good depending on the night.

They seem to have a lot of older regulars, and as such the flavors are not very bold. Everything I have tried has been solid, though, and the house potatoes are the hotness. Seriously, try the potatoes. The lunch menu is a great value, and they deliver, too. Chris' has become my stop to satisfy a quick tzatziki craving. I would give three and a half stars if I could, but the service has always been pleasant so they get four."},{"name":"Veracruz All Natural","address":"2505 Webberville Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Currently our favorite breakfast tacos in town.

You order your food on a menu sheet and everything is served \\"family style\\"...ie. all on a big platter.  They also warn you that everything cooks at different times so they don't all come out at once...um...ok.  \\nA few points:\\n-Price point: too much for too little.  They have 2 price points for their tacos.  With around 8-10 tacos on the menu, about 1/2 cost $2.5 and 1/2 cost $3.5 or 3 for $7 or $9.5.  So fine...except these tacos are SMALL...comparable to the mini tacos are El Rey.  So we each got 3.\\n-Flavors: much to be desired.  None of the tacos were particularly memorable and the accoutrements didn't enhance the taco filling at all.  Here's what we tried:\\n*Chicken - 4/5: Definitely one of the better/more balanced fillings.  The chicken was moist and lots of flavorful seasoning.  I'd get this one again.\\n*Pork Belly - 3/4: Great flavor, a tad sweet.....but dry.  Not sure why they chose to keep the pork belly in 2 thick slices--meaning it was exceptionally hard to bite into and tear a piece off.\\n*Chorizo - 5/5: The best of all the tacos!  Not overly greasy or fatty, big chunks of sausage! Would definitely get this one again!\\n*Veracruz - 2/5: the grilled/pan seared/non-fried fish option.  I could not taste the fish at all!  Unfortunately the abundance of pickled jicama salad they topped it with just overpowered the entire taco and covered any fish flavor from the 2 small pieces of fish it came with.\\n*Baja - 2/5: the fried fish option.  The fired coating was a too thick, though it was pretty crispy.  Overall just bland.\\n*Pork Tamale - 4/5: I'd definitely get this again! the sauce was delish and the pork tender.  The masa was a little grainy, but acceptable.  But a think a tad expensive for $5 each.\\n*Margaritas - 3/5: Definitely a solid drink...but way expensivo--$50/pitcher! cray!\\n-Service was great!  Everyone was very attentive and clear with instructions on how to order.  Can't complain here.\\n\\nWe'll see if I ever decide to go back....\\n\\nPS.  Parking is cray! If you are going during dinner time...I really recommend trying to find some street parking.  The valet gets EXTREMELY backed up--like extreeeeeme....we got into our cars in the street after waiting for a good 15min.

This location doesn't offer as much outdoor seating as their other shop, but does have a handful of tables that are great for a nice day. DG is very dog friendly, with a designated tie-up area out front, and a clientele that is easy going. \\n\\nThe drip coffee is good, the lattes, cappucinos, etc are really good, and the pastries are GREAT. If you have a chance to get the peach pop-tart, don't miss out. The staff is really well informed and can answer any coffee related question you may have. If you're looking for any kind of accessory for your home-brewing operation, chances are DG has a good solution for sale.\\n\\nThe environment is open & well lit, with a lot of nice sized communal tables/countertop space for working. They also have a counter overlooking the baristas which is nice for conversation. Plugs are available, but due to their placement, sometimes you have to play musical chairs with your table mates. The environment can range from library-silent to buzzing.\\n\\nParking can be tough in the small lot behind the shop.
