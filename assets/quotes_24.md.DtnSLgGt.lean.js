Nothing \\"oooh\\" or \\"ahhh\\" about it though. \\n\\nMONTE CRISTO: was the special that they had for the day. It was an open-faced 1/2 sandwich and took up only 1/4 of the plate, when the other 3/4 of the plate came with a salad with a light dressing that I think I could've made at home. Although the portion of the monte cristo was decent for portion-control. Yes it was a bit rich, but I think the side salad shouldn't be overwhelming. \\n\\nFOUNTAIN SODA: they make their own type of soda concoctions. I thought it was quite creative. But at the same time, wasn't blown away. Good vibes for the effort though. \\n\\nAlthough service was kind, they were quite MIA and it took a while just for us to get an order out.

But were able to take a lot of cards if you came in a large group. \\n\\nFYI:\\n- Parking on the street\\n- Accepts CC\\n- FOOD CHALLENGE JUNKIES: \\"The Poutine Challenge\\" where you eat 5 pounds of poutine (french fried potatoes, cheese curds and brown gravy) within 30 minutes!

We sat down and a few minutes later ordered drinks.  Immediately after the waitress left, a different waitress came to our table asking if we wanted drinks.  Small mix up, but that fine.  The chocolate shake and glass of water took about 15 minutes.  I thought my shake was pretty good until my boyfriend noticed that the adhesive from the price tag was still on the bottom of the spoon.  I promptly removed said spoon from my shake, pretty disgusted.  \\n\\nWe ordered our meal, consisting of a half caesar salad with no tomato, the starlite burger with no tomato, and a coupe de ville.  We waited for a pretty long time, and I noticed that all the waitresses were just standing in front of the kitchen waiting anxiously.  My salad took about 25 minutes to come out (with tomatoes scattered throughout), but the main dishes were brought out about 2 minutes after I got my salad.  Turns out the coupe de ville is a sandwich (the menu suggests otherwise).  My burger was advertised as being grass fed, free range beef, but the patty I received was paper thin and cooked beyond belief.  It tasted like any other burger I've ever had at a diner, definitely nothing special.  The only speedy thing that night was the check, as it was dropped off at our table about thirty seconds after we received our main dishes.

He has many unusual daily specials that he brings in from Japan. I happen to LOVE his ankimo (monkfish liver) with Ponzu (citrus and soy sauce) that tastes like foie gras of the sea- creamy. mild, distinctive. It is, alas, only available in certain seasons. He also makes an excellent 'Yamakake', fresh tuna and mountain yam, with quail egg, which is hard to find in other Japanese restnts. Also noteworthy is his mackerel with ginger, tobiko and scallion-- very refreshing.\\n\\nJunji is at heart a very traditional Japanese sushi chef who believes that sushi should be served the simple traditional way, not all dressed up with dressings and sauces that mask the delicate flavor of the fresh fish.

The lady that was helping us seemed really clueless about the items that they offered, specifically the macarons. She was definitely new. She also had a heavy Asian accent so that didn't make it easier to understand what she was saying. They also seemed to be out of most of the flavors, which was disappointing. We were there later on in the afternoon, so you'd probably get a better selection if you were there earlier in the day. They import their macarons daily from Singapore, so that makes sense. \\n\\nAll in all, their macarons were good, but service and selection wasn't the greatest."},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Canoe is one of my favorite restaurants!

Beautiful wood accents, two sides open onto a terrace that goes all the way down to the river.  Tranquil and elegant.  \\n\\nFantastic service and food.  Southern themed menu is full of premium, small production ingredients lovingly prepared and well seasoned.  Great smoked salmon, crab cake, and an African Squash soup that's velvety and perfect.  The fowls can get a little dry however.  Desserts are again beautiful and delicious.  \\n\\nWhen you express an interest in sharing food with your companion, the chef will try to portion it as it's being plated.   A few places do this and it's very considerate, but I found I didn't like it too much--the intended presentation is inevitably compromised--and I advise you to not take up on the offer.  \\n\\nFinally the brunch.  It's famous and I think rightly so.  But I am not a huge fan.  They've priced and portioned the entrees too high and large, and I have had a hard time finishing it, especially if the Pastry Basket is ordered.  The pastry items are great, not perfect, but great.  Usually lots of \\"stately\\", conservative looking regulars can be found at Canoe.  Overall I prefer the brunch at Watershed better.  \\n\\nOf note is that there is a small but very nice bar area.

We went for the main purpose of checking out the place for a potential rehearsal dinner space. I was immediately intrigued by the decor - it is, indeed, rustic! It's very homey and comforting, but at the same time, it's sleek and modern. \\n\\nWe were seated in a quaint, circular booth (1/2 booth, 1/2 chairs) that makes you feel closed off from everyone else, but still a part of the action.\\n\\nMy friend and I had been drooling over the online menu for weeks and were so excited when we finally got there!\\n\\nThe bread (which came with olives and a white bean dip - I had to ask what it was otherwise we wouldn't have known) was good. It had what were either cranberries or grapes in it (I think grapes). The bread was soft and fluffy and tasty!\\n\\nWe started with both couples splitting the Caesar Salad - I love when places split the salad for you and you basically get 2 full salads. When they first brought the salads to the women, we moved the plates over and the guys dug in. Then they brought their salads! Oops. We all had a laugh and then I stole back some croutons. None of us quite knew what to make of the Parmesan basket (basically a bit, crunchy bit of cheese apparently!) - I had no idea what it was but I ate it all. The croutons were huge and almost fluffy! I couldn't spear them because they kept breaking. Not usually the story with croutons - a very nice change. The dressing was perfect - light, flavorful, garlicky. Mmm. Wow. Didn't realize I could write so much about salads!\\n\\nOn the to other appetizer. I had been intrigued all week by the Italian Spring Rolls (which, unfortunately, came right when the salads did - I would have preferred more time in between). These were DIVINE. These were sweet Italian sausage spring rolls with provolone fondue and marinara sauce. I didn't remember what the sauces were when the food came (and the waiter didn't tell us), but I didn't even need the sauces. These things were AWESOME. Everything I thought they would be. It was 2 spring rolls, cut in half, so everyone got a 1/2. Perfect portion-size!\\n\\nFor dinner, my fiance and I split the 9-ounce Filet Mignon, which came with a Ratatouille - we opted for the Parmesan-Truffle Fries and the Roasted Garlic Butter sauce (mmm). I'd never had Ratatouille before and I really enjoyed this one. The veggies were soft, full of flavor and all melded together really well. The fries were good but I couldn't taste the parmesan. They tasted like regular fries and the bottom ones were soggy from the Garlic Butter sauce.\\n\\nMy friend's boyfriend got the Tagliatelle Bolognese (which the waiter said \\"had a bit of cream\\"). It's \\"a savory meat sauce of beef & pork over rich egg noodles,\\" but there was no red sauce that we could see. I didn't try this, but I think he enjoyed it.\\n\\nThe best meal by far, though, was my friend's Slow-Braised Beef Short Ribs with mushroom risotto and broccolini. These were SO tender, they almost fell right off the fork! The ribs and the risotto almost melted in your mouth. I sort of wish I'd gotten this instead! Amazing.\\n\\nIn terms of service, the hostess knew immediately that we were there to research and was actually the woman I'd been emailing with. Despite being a busy Saturday night, she showed us around and answered our questions (we were there early so we could look around). She even printed me out a menu later in the evening for me to keep.\\n\\nOur waiter was nice, but not overly helpful. My friend asked for a glass of wine with dinner and he ran away before her boyfriend could ask for another drink. He did ask us if were were there for a show, but then said \\"you're not gonna make it if you are!\\" Luckily, we weren't. Not bad service, just not super friendly.\\n\\nWe are still thinking about it in terms of our rehearsal dinner, mainly because it's not SUPER close to a T stop and parking could be difficult.

The fry rice came with crispy pork belly and squid and the fried egg on top was still ooey and gooey and this dish was my favourite of the night. The chicken dish was likewise also spot on with the flavours. The portion size was very good too, a big thigh and a breast. The sweet sauce of the chicken worked well with the crunchy slaw they put on top.

We (senior couple and daughter) arrived at the restaurant about 4 pm, and easily-found an available parking spot.    \\n\\nWe received welcome greetings upon entering, and were shown to a round table, located in a corner, with a great commanding view of the whole place.  Once tucked in and seated, our server immediately brought hot tea (teapot and small mugs) and menus (dine-in lunch and dinner menus) to our table.  \\n\\nThe restaurant is a rather decent size, with tables-only seating, and a good assortment of table sizes (and the tables are not fixed in place, so can be moved about to accommodate varying group sizes).

We really liked and appreciated the ambiance.\\n\\nService was cordial, friendly, timely, and helpful throughout our visit.  And with their rather large and varied menu, we sure appreciated the initial help received when trying to make up our minds on what dishes to order.\\n\\nWhat I ordered ..... all dishes brought piping hot, and \\"looking good\\" (in size and preparation) from kitchen to our table:\\n\\n-- House Special Chow Mein - w/dried noodles, mushrooms, onion, baby boy choy, and assortments of meats (pork, beef, chicken) and seafoods (squid, prawns, scallop) -- Sweet and Sour Pork (ordered small size) - w/cubed and battered pieces of pork, veggies (green/yellow/red bell peppers, onions, and etc), and sauce --  Beef, with Tomato and Scrambled Egg --  Squid and Gai Lan, w/garlic -- Green Beans with Spicy Minced Meat.\\n\\nTasting the various dishes proved how well they had all been prepared.  I believe I did good in selection of dishes ordered - we were able to try a good mix of various seafoods, meats, and veggies, along with the textures, and what I thought were some truly-distinctive flavours and tastes that accompanied each.  Preparations were not greasy, or salty, the sauces tasted 'light', and based in nicely-flavoured stocks, much more than oil, the textures, tender, and if anything, a touch undercooked (yea!).  Some familiar-to-us names, but with some unique and tasty surprises.   \\n\\nI am sure glad to have ordered more than I had to, it allowed us to try more, and my lady and I will savour the leftovers for dinner today.   \\n\\nMy ladies, and the Grand Seasons made \\"my day\\" -- a much-enjoyed dining experience!"},{"name":"Black Horse Tavern","address":"32 Waterfield Rd","city":"Winchester","stars":"3","text":"I will rate the Steak & Blue flat bread a 5.

I have been here twice and both of my lunches were great!\\n\\nWhen i first pulled up I was a little bummed out that they didn't have parking but, then I realized they have plenty of spots behind the building.  The back of the building looks more like an entrance and there is a patio looking area that I am sure they will put tables on for the summer months!\\n\\nThe seating consists of some booths against the wall, a row of tables down the center and some bar/counter seating.  The booths are super high and I loved how it felt like you were in your own private space.\\n\\nDry Lime & Herb drink was good but, I would give it 3 stars because the flavors were too bold to mesh well with my patty melt!  The lemonade was 4 stars and it was definitely made with fresh squeezed lemon but, didn't have that overpowering sugar taste.  It was light refreshing and crisp!\\n\\nThe patty melt was cooked to the correct medium temperature and topped with mushrooms, onions, cheddar, sauce and served on rye.  The bread was crispy on the outside and was at that perfect point where it isn't burn but, has the char marks on it.  The mushrooms and onions were well done and fresh but, didn't steal the stand out meat flavor from the beef.  There was jalapenos on the plate and unless you want your mouth to burn for 2 hours, I would advise skipping them.  I would give this 5 stars.\\n\\nThe Pastrami sandwich was also a large sandwich and the bread was just as good as the other sandwich.  I found some of the parts of the pastrami to be really fatty.  I know pastrami is fatty but, sometimes it's more fatty than others.  The 1,000 and slaw on top had a nice bold flavor.  Also, the tiny bread and butter pickles that they make in house were a nice briny flavor addition.  I would give this sandwich a 3.5!\\n\\nThe sandwiches are all a la cart but, they are a big enough portion where you are fine without sides!\\n\\nI hope this place sticks around as I enjoyed it and I also like that they rotate their menu daily.

The food here is a little inconsistent, but the happy hour prices and cool decor make up for it! I had come here once before when they first opened, but at the time the menu was much smaller and the overall restaurant was 'too new to rate' (aka, wanted to give them some time to work out the kinks). There are so many restaurants in Columbus that I never made it back! I came in for Tiki Tuesday for a long overdue revisit. On Tuesdays they have additional discounts on their Tiki Classics - $3 off! This means you can get a brain-melting Zombie with 5 kinds of liquor in it for less than $10. Also, the rest of the happy hour is pretty solid. $2 off of their classic drinks (think Dark 'n Stormy) and appetizers. Between our group of four, here's what we had:\\n\\n-Island Nachos - a lot of food for the price! Pineapple on nachos? Too many toppings and not enough chips, but really tasty and the guac was awesome. \\n\\n-Sweet Potato wedges with teriyaki dip - HUGE ASS BOWL of wedges. This was an amazing deal, and I really liked the dip. I would never think to put teriyaki with sweet potato, but it was super tasty. \\n\\n-Crab Rangoon - Okay. The filling was really rich and actually had pieces of crab in it, so that was a pleasant surprise. The wrapper was closer to an egg roll wrapper, so it diminished the overall experience. I would have preferred an actual wonton wrapper. \\n\\n-Hush Puppies with honey sriracha butter - The puppies were good, but the dip was all wrong. The butter is WAY too rich with a hush puppy. This needs a spicy honey instead of a butter dip. \\n\\n-Coconut Shrimp - Nope. Just giant breaded shrimp. Total lack of coconut... so if you like breaded shrimp you'll enjoy it, but don't look for any semblance of coconut on the outside.\\n\\nI am a sucker for anything with a fusion of island, thai, and ... maybe tex mex? It's tough to put my finger on where everything on the menu originates, but that's okay. This is your place for big fun drinks served in a funky tiki glass, and a dark tropical vibe. A lot of their decor comes from the Kahiki location that closed in 2000. \\n\\nCome here for a fun happy hour!"},{"name":"Wok' n Guys","address":"4655 SW Griffith Dr, Ste 115","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Grain of salt: This is based off one visit.

What I got was a fairly large bowl of noodles with a lot of grilled onion and a minuscule amount of meat. For 12.50$ it was not on par with what I was really after. There may have been 2.5 oz of pork in the whole thing. The bean sauce was decent, but considering the amount of noodles, probably not enough to flavour everything.\\n\\nThe good thing about it was that it was quick. And while they didn't have the typical array of ban chan, it felt more like a quick-lunch place anyway, so I wasn't terribly upset about it. Another thing that felt a bit off was that they didn't have barley tea, which is sort of a brilliant accompaniment to Korean food. \\n\\nYet, for 12.50$, at most places I get a full array of banchan as well as a tonne of meat.

The 4 shrimp in the cocktail were probably the biggest ones I had ever seen, were so delicious and clean tasting, and the cocktail sauce was so horseradishy yet delicious, I could have eaten a few of these just for dinner alone. The Orange Chicken was grilled chicken breast with orange-rosemary butter sauce, roasted red bell pepper mashers, and seasonal vegetables. The bell pepper mashers were probably the best potatoes I've ever eaten in my life. Since we were celebrating the new year, 2 desserts were ordered by us that night. The creme brulee was to die for, so creamy and delicious, it literally melted in your mouth.

Let me start from the beginning.\\n\\nI was driving up Davie on my way home and having just passed the donair place I normally frequent, I suddenly got the urge for one and not wanting to turn around and drive back a block (whoever said it doesn't pay to be lazy was right) I stopped at this place instead. Right away I should have known it was mistake, because just about every food place on Davie, including my usual donair spot, was full of people, and there wasn't a single person in this place, and none came in during the 10mins that I was there. \\n\\nI walk in and the place smells good, no complaints so far, I order a Beef Donair with all the fixings and while it was being prepared I went to pay for it. I whip out my debit and am told they only take cash. Funny, I look at the door, no such sign, I glance all over the cash register area, no sign saying cash only. I mean come on, this is not a stall or food cart, it's a big enough business to be able to afford the pennies per transaction fees. So I proceed to inform them that I do not have any cash, and that's when I get pointed to an ATM in the corner. So let me get this straight, not only do you not want to pay the penny transaction fees, but you want to force your customers to pay over $2 in transaction fees so you make money off that? Are you kidding me??\\n\\nSo I was forced to walk around the corner to the gas station to get money out of a proper bank machine, and along the way I wondered, well, perhaps the money they are saving from not having to pay transaction fees they are putting into their food instead and this donair will be amazing. \\n\\nWith great anticipation I get home, pull the wrapper off and examine the outside. Ok, nice and crispy just the way I like it. Now for the first bite, and...it's chicken. So now I've been forced to pay an ATM fee and my food is not what I ordered. I'm thinking 3 star review already. But proceeded was by far the most tasteless, bland donair I have had in a long time. There wasn't enough chicken pieces for me to be able to comment on the quality of the meat. \\n\\nWhat a rip-off this place ended up being.

We were in Portland for a week vacation, and stopped in within a few hours of arrival.  \\n\\nThe brewery is a really large, high-ceilinged building with lots of windows and light.  It's done up very \\"Northwest\\" with lots of wooden animal decor, etc.  They have a bunch of outdoor seating, but we were only drinking, and those were reserved for eating only.  It was such a great day and all the windows were open, so we were fine with just sitting inside at the bar.  \\n\\nEveryone from the second we walked in was super friendly and helpful.  Our bartender(s) were awesome.  We each got a pint and then each did a sampler of 6 beers, 4 oz. each...for a mere $6.50!  That's $6.50 for 24 oz. of beer! I can't get over how cheap everything is up here!  This was an awesome way to sample all their amazing beers.  Had a great variety and then got a pint of my favorite one.  \\n\\nWe also ordered the SMOKED PAPRIKA FRIES Spanish smoked paprika, Manchego cheese, spicy ketchup ($6), which were to die for.  Super tasty little bar snack for a day of drinking!\\n\\nI think altogether our tab was $48 for 6 beers, 2 samples, and an order of fries.  In LA, that would've been at least $70....\\n\\nMy only regret is we weren't able to make it back and eat a full meal.

For $8, you are given two toppings, choice of bun, AND two sauces. For all of you sauce freaks, this is your wheel house. Again, the sauces and accompaniments are equally artisan.\\n\\nCase in point: burn-your-face-off hot sauce. This zippy sauce was perfect on the sweet duck-bacon-fig dog. The pretzel wheat bun offers a wholesome character, perfect for pairing with the large, plump wieners.

The olaf sauce, which is a spicy tomato--almost marinara-esque--also gives some of the red meat offerings a kick.\\n\\nI didn't even touch on the booze, moreso because I didn't actually touch booze during this lunch hour, but I thought their menu was quite expansive.

There are only two vegetarian sandwich options on the dinner menu, and  in a group of three it seemed kind of boring to order the same thing as my wife. I asked if it was possible to get a veggie Philly Cheese Steak by subbing portabello  mushrooms for the meat. The extremely polite person at the register asked the cook, but the answer was no, because they weren't sure how to charge us for it, and how it would turn out with the moisture content possibly ruining the bread. I completely understood and ordered the eggplant parm.\\n\\n Not too long after sitting down I was approached by Aaron the manager, he asked if I was the person looking for a veggie Philly and he said he would be willing to make it instead. He said it's an option he has been toying with, but that it's tricky to plan for. The mushrooms are expensive if they don't get used, and it's not really something you can prep ahead of time. I thanked him and said if he was willing to make it I wouldn't hold it against them if it fell apart, as well as pay extra.\\n\\nThis was the best vegetarian sandwich I have ever had, hands down! To be clear, I ordered something that was not on the menu, the manager made it, and they were slow enough to prep the ingredients for my order.  I can't promise you will get the same sandwich if you roll in on a busy weekend night, but I can promise they will do everything in their power to accommodate your requests. \\n\\nMessage to the owner-\\nIt's people like Aaron, and the lady behind the counter that keep people like us locals, seeking out small businesses we feel good about supporting.

Good food, good drinks and wonderful service, can't go wrong on a casual evening out.  We started the dinner with zucini fries which were addictive!  Can't remember the names of the dishes, but we had a delightfully light tomato-based pasta dish and a bit heavier chicken dish with cheese stuffing... YUMMMMmmm.  Both dishes were wonderful!  We had blackberry sangria which was absolutely delicious!  Our server was very attentive without being intrusive.  So what's with 3 stars?  Here's a couple of issues I had... the place was packed so we were seated at a table which wouldn't have been a problem but unfortunately, tables were so closely packed together that we felt like we were seated with bunch of strangers.  The wait staffs were zipping through extremely narrow spaces between the tables which I thought wasn't possible, but they made it happen and in the process, our chairs kept getting hip checked... not pleasant!  At one point, when our very nice waiter was grinding cheese over our plates, I thought that I might get punched by his hand when another server bumped him while walking by.  The second issue was with our dessert... we ordered tiramisu and one of their mini desserts that comes in a shooter glass.  I loved my mini dessert - chocolate mousse, it was on a heavier side, but the portion was small enough to be just right.  Tiramisu on the other hand was a disaster!  The cream base for this particular dessert was waaaaay too heavy to the point of resembling crisco or lard in texture - yuck!  Light cake component of the dish was ok, but it was soaked in coffee liquor rather than expresso... not the way I prefer.  So we only had a couple bites and called it quits.  Overall, good times were had at Carrabba's. We will return here the next time we are in the area, but we will be sure to sit in a booth and perhaps skip desserts."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Super fun place!

The first is that the staff are almost painfully disaffected, and seem to be unaware of any good model of customer service. I wouldn't go so far as to say they're snooty or mean or anything. The service is just really slow and not overtly friendly. My other criticism is the prices. The prices for the pastries aren't listed anywhere and they have varied so much to the point that I'm not sure the pricing isn't arbitrary. Almost $5 for a scone is really, really too much.

I had a simple task, get the friends together, set the reservation, and make it happen. A lot of thought and planning went into this evening, and we had our dinner booked for 8:30PM. Just to be safe, our party of 14 arrived 30 minutes early to have a few at the bar. When we got there we put our names in. It was obviously busy, but how long could it really take us? After all... we had a reservation so everything would work out... right?\\n\\nTime marched on...\\n\\nThere I sat downstairs at the bar, trying my best to calmly reassure my hungry group of friends that the table would be ready \\"any minute now\\" and that, \\"we're up next\\". 15 minutes pass, 30 minutes pass, then an hour, then and hour and a half, and then TWO HOURS. Each time I went upstairs to check with the hostess I met several other groups of people like myself waiting to be seated. I rubbed elbows with a party of 14 that had been waiting an hour, a party of 12 an hour and a half, and a party of 18 a full two and a half hours. I suppose that was the worst part: knowing that as long as I had waited, there were still tables in front of me. \\n\\nTwo people in our group finally had enough and left to get pizza next door at Otto's. At that point I looked to the staff with an expression of pure panic as I realized that my girlfriend's birthday party was being ruined. I saw the hostess urge her manager to talk to me. He ignored her plea and did some cash counting and busy work at the front of the house. I think he finally decided to give me recognition when he caught that lost look in my eye. Even then all he could say to me was, \\"your table will be ready soon\\". No apology, and no explanation, just a quick gloss over and a non reassuring empty statement.\\n\\nBut I digress.\\n\\nAfter over two full hours of waiting the table was ready at quarter to 11. Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse they had the nerve to allow a drunk, and entitled party of people that arrived AFTER us to sit at the same time. In a frenzy they practically snatched our seats away! The fact that we were patient, respectful and polite didn't seem to matter. The group with a reservation time 30 minutes after us received priority. Their drink orders were taken and brought to them before we even got our menus.\\n\\nIt doesn't stop there.\\n\\nWhen we finally did get to order, everyone that requested the \\"hibachi dinners\\" didn't get their salads. Someone in our party ordered a meal that came with a soup, but it was not served to her. We also asked for an order of edamame that we never received even though we were charged for it. On top of all this they neglected to give us our dipping sauces. Upon asking for them the hibachi cook told us to scoop it ourselves, handed us metal pots complete with ladles, and then attempted to pawn it off as part of his \\"act\\". Give me a break.\\n\\nAt the end of the night they gave us 20% off our check. Honestly it still wasn't enough for the frustration it caused us. This was a big night for my girlfriend, and they put it all on the line. Some acknowledgment or a formal apology would have meant a lot more to me. Maybe make us feel special in some way. I don't need a discount, we just wanted to feel like valued and important customers. They just looked at us with dollar signs in their eyes. Obviously money is all that really matters to them.

This was served a top a mound of Brie whipped purple potatoes and young yellow and orange carrots. The dish was surrounded by Brandied Medjool sauce. The birds were deboned and cooked to perfection. They were stuffed with a blend of chopped walnuts and figs that were more sweet than  savory. This I wasn't sure what wine to pair with it. My server Dale bought out two wines. I chose the El Cortjillo Tempranillo from Spain. It was a perfect balance.

It was actually a little difficult to find, because there was no big sign indicating the name of the place. While walking, we actually passed by it the first time, and figured it was another restaurant that matched with the seafood one next to it. Just know that once you reach the 1100 building, it's literally right there, on the right side of the main door for the building.\\n\\nAnyways, we parked previously at a public lot, so parking wasn't an issue we had to figure out when coming. \\n\\nThere's outdoor and inside seating, which makes it a really great spot for brunch on a nice day. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted and seated. Past 11 on a Saturday, and there's a seemingly long wait time. \\n\\nThe interior is actually really cute, and you can get food to go, including menu items, as well as coffee and pastries! \\n\\nAs for food, I got the eggs Benedict with tomato and spinach. Surprisingly, it was actually filling, because the English muffin is a little thicker than most places, and they were generous to pile on the spinach layer. Looking at my friends who also got eggs Benedict, but with bacon, seemed a little more sparse. Regardless, the food was tasty and portioned well for the price!\\nThe peach sweetened iced tea is also refreshing, which gets goes well with your food.\\n\\nService was ok--might've been busier than usual, but our server forgot our refills and split the check wrong. Make sure to double check your receipts! Otherwise, great brunch spot, and cute for instas (did I mention great lighting and marble tabletops?)"},{"name":"Umi","address":"3050 Peachtree Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"A family member recommended Umi for our visit to Atlanta. Got an early reservation on a Saturday fairly easy through OpenTable. \\n\\nThe space is absolutely beautiful and the service is very prompt and helpful. The decor felt something like a lounge, and the lighting is dim. Silly, but they had Japanese washlets on the toilets, which we haven't seen outside of Japan! The overall vibe is definitely perfect. \\n\\nI found the menu to be pretty straightforward. Like, you're not going to get any crazy dishes here - it's just good quality, traditional options. We shared multiple nigiri: lean tuna, fatty tuna, eel. We got seconds of the lean tuna...it was seriously so amazing! I could have done without the spicy tuna roll. It was small and basic. We also did soup and salad. The miso is very good...the salad was nice and actually quite large. \\n\\nTwo comments on the food: they were out of medium fatty tuna. Womp womp. Also, the rice fell apart on multiple nigiri, which means it wasn't sticky enough. I think that would make a sushi master cringe, and for the price of the sushi at Umi, the nigiri should be prepared perfectly. \\n\\nAll in all, this is a high quality dining experience with traditional sushi options. Again, you aren't going to get a 'picture worthy' roll, but you will get amazing quality. The tuna comes from Japan, so it's the closest you can get to Tokyo quality, without making a trip there."},{"name":"Grindhouse Killer Burgers","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"4 stars.  \\n\\nAirport storefront in Terminal D.

The stall will tell you how many minutes, which I think is helpful specially in an airport setting.\\n\\nBurgers were tasty, around $7 for a single, and up to about $11 for a double.  They're not bistro- or restaurant quality, but I think they are at par with the newer chains, like Smashburger.  \\n\\nSeating is limited and tight.  There is a bar with about three or four lines of beer on tap, including Sweetwater 420 (April 2015).  Also spirits and some bottled beer.\\n\\nService was adequate, they get the job done.

Not a big fan of the BBQ places downtown, so I was happy to find out this one was there!  I planned on picking up some BBQ on Sat. for the football game, but they were going to be closed.  Good thing I called because there website says they are open on Saturdays.  Not true.  Okay, so I'll just warm it up in the micro on Sat.  \\n\\nI placed my order and it ended up being way more than the prices on the menu.  Apparently, if you order the meat by the pound, most of it is $9.99 per pound.  If you order less than a pound it is over double the price.  I ordered 1/4 of a pound of $9.99 meat and it was OVER $5!!  What?  I guess they really need to make up for the high rent I'm sure they are charged in that location.  They make up the money on everything else on the menu too.  The three meat platter for lunch is $13.99.  I ordered pickles, onions, bread, etc. on the side.  Nope, right in the to go foam box.  Ordered a pint, was given two individual servings.  \\n\\nThe people were really nice and the food was flavorful.  The place smells great.  The sauce is good.  The chopped beef is perfect!  The pulled pork and brisket is moist(with little fat) and the sausage is not fatty.  Corn had no taste. No bacon in the green beans.  They stated it's for the veggies in the city.  What veggie goes to a BBQ place and expects there to be no bacon in the beans?  Put bacon in the beans!  The person offered to put bacon in after the fact, I accepted, not in there when I got it home.  So, the BBQ gets a thumbs up, but the hours, pricing and attention to order details falls short.  I would have given it 3 stars if parking was easier too.\\n\\nMaybe if they moved some where rent's not so high so the prices are more reasonable because the BBQ is good.  Better than I've tasted downtown.

Soon, the owner/chef appeared -- a big, jolly guy named Ali, with a heart of gold and some amazing cooking chops -- and after a little conversation, he suggested I try his Doner Kebab special, which included chunks of lamb, chicken and veggies, grilled to perfection, with three or four sizable helpings of different rice dishes, hot and sweet peppers... Amazing, just amazing! \\n\\nThe next night I came back with my wife & daughter in tow, and Ali lavished our little one with small samples of one yummy dessert after another, and then flabbergasted us with a check whose total was about half what we'd have paid for such amazing grub, anywhere else! \\n\\nSince then, I've brought over a dozen of my friends, colleagues and associates to Chicken Kebab, as well as my mother --  even one of my clients -- and always, the food and the service are impeccable.

My fianc√©e and I order the Spring Rolls to start. I certainly liked them since they were different than most spring rolls and the sauce to dip in was really good - my fianc√©e thought they were good but nothing to write home about (they do have a bit of a different taste so I can see others having the same sentiment). Then most of our food came just as we finished the rolls.\\n\\nWe got the Pad Thai which has an excellent kick to it - I have to say this Pad Thai was damn good. For smaller plates we got the Five Spiced Calamari with a dipping sauce that was very good. The Calamari was cooked really well and fried nicely. We also got the Roti Canai because of how many great reviews this dish got, but I have to say it certainly didn't live up to the hype. Don't get me wrong it was still good, but it just seemed \\"so so\\". It has a unique taste that we just weren't feeling. \\n\\nFinally we decided since everything was so good to get some desert! I was hesitant since I was so full! Those four dishes for two people is quite filling.\\n\\nWe decided to get the Cinnamon Roti which was amazing. It is a great dessert.

My second visit last night deserved just under 4 stars. So, being the mathematical genius that I am (not!), I decided to give them the approximate average of 3 stars for this review.\\n\\nThe biggest difference between the two visits is the service. It was incredibly slow in the first visit even though the place was quiet that evening. Way too many minutes went by unnecessarily, and I visualized the tip % of our server go down with every tik and tok. \\n\\nIn the second visit, our server was far more attentive, informed us when setbacks occurred in the kitchen, and did everything in as timely a manner as she possibly could. It was far busier this time around, and yet she managed to keep up.\\n\\nThe food was also slightly better the second time around, but not by that much, sadly.\\n\\nHere are the items I've tried:\\n\\nRoti Canai\\nThe roti itself was fried well. It was crispy and airy like it's supposed to be. But really? Only 1? Sad. The curry that came with it was completely bland. So that wasn't worth it.\\n\\nChicken Satay\\nWas this a joke? The satay sauce was borderline disgusting. The oil that separated pretty much made up half of the entire, minuscule cup. Even after we stirred it up, every bite became far too oily than necessary. I've had better satay sauce from a bottle that I get at the Asian grocery store. The chicken was also barely marinated, which made it bland. Again, it wasn't worth it.\\n\\nLaksa Curry\\nThe curry was watery and oily at the same time. I never knew that could be possible. But apparently so! I'm more used to rice noodles being in Laksa, but the egg noodles worked. And the tofu was a nice touch. But overall, this was just borderline OK.\\n\\nChar Kway Teow\\nThis is actually a decent dish, but not as authentic as I'd like. It's one of my favorites from back home, so I was disappointed that the flavors didn't come through, but I would actually recommend it.\\n\\nVegetable Spring Rolls\\nFree with Yelp check-in! Can't complain since it was free, but I wouldn't pay for it. Too much pepper in the filling, but the sauce was good.\\n\\nSteamed Bok Choy in Oyster Sauce\\nNot worth it. And the mushrooms are really unnecessary. Just add one more bunch of bok choy instead. And actually season it with something else in addition to the oyster sauce.\\n\\nChow Faan\\nSo, so bland. Which is such a contrast from the Hokkien Mee. It became a problem when I took another bite after the Hokkien Mee. I think they forgot the salt on this one. I'm hoping this was just a fluke on this night, but the trend would indicate that it was most likely intentional.\\n\\nHokkien Mee\\nHoly pepper! I could smell and taste white pepper with every single bite. I appreciate some pepper, but I think some spillage might've happened in this case. It was overwhelming.

Starbucks in Reading didn't have any parking so we ended up here just because we drove by and saw the coffee and wifi sign. We didn't plan on eating lunch out but changed our mind after seeing the menu. \\n\\nFirst off, the owner was incredibly friendly and attentive. He made sure to fill us in about their coffee beans and roasts, and gave us lots of info about the menu. He also talked us through our orders and gave lots of options for customization of our food - it was just a level above typical service.

This guy (who I assumed was owner) just really cares about his customers and making sure they're completely happy and satisfied. \\n\\nWe didn't have high expectations for food or coffee (in fact we had no expectations as we just stopped in to kill time!) but everything far exceeded the typical coffee joint. \\n\\nI got a medium iced cappuccino (he gave me lots of milk and sweetener choices) and my wife got a coffee - both drinks were high quality. For lunch I got a ham and mozzarella panini but had it on an everything bagel - I was surprised and happy to see they used big chunks of fresh high quality mozzarella. My wife got an avocado, egg, spinach, and cheese on an english muffin. They forgot the cheese but she didn't notice until she was pretty deep in and she decided she didn't need it so she didn't say anything - it wasn't a big deal and you could tell from the prior service that if she'd mentioned it, they'd have been apologetic and fixed it with a smile. \\n\\nWe wish they'd been around all those years we lived in Stoneham - I hope the place does well and lasts!

Seeing a ramen place, I was interested since it was also pretty cold outside.\\n\\nStepping in, I took their special ramen, hoping that it would be a great bowl of ramen since it was their house dish and that it had to be higher quality than other things. However, my first tastes did not lead me to a good experience. The broth was VERY watery. The chashu that came it was just pork with no special flavoring - in fact, I had no idea if it was roasted or not, it just had a cooked texture but no evidence of any special flame treatment, be it a burn mark or at least a savory aroma or taste. Their egg included was also disappointing, because it was soft-boiled but the yolk didn't run nearly as much as others (like Sanpachi's tasty egg, for instance). The noodles were very good though - firm but a bit overcooked so they soaked up broth well (they claimed they were homemade which i believe), and the vegetables were not overcooked either.\\n\\nThe meal came with some genmaicha, which I found very nice. However, that didn't really add much to the experience, which was not that cheap either, at $10 for the ramen. The bowl was large I guess, but the taste overall was disappointing. \\n\\nIt's a bit biased of me but anytime I don't hear Japanese at a ramen place I get concerned.

Dim sum is a system of dining in which waiters have these giant carts that are filled with dumpling, pork, beef, pastries, sticky rice, etc. They will, at regular intervals unless you call for them, visit your table an offer a plethora of food. If you take one they write it down and you pay for it at the end. That's Dim Sum.\\n\\nSo for what I prefer Shumai, Shrimp dumplings and spare ribs, sticky rice. I love Shumai and shrimp dumplings at dim sum and this place was no exception.  Spare ribs were A ok for dim sum. The sticky rice is served in a container. It slightly flavored rice that is stickier. That's all I can say.\\n\\nService was on the line. They didn't talk much and some speak with a slight accent. By the way, they don't have lemonade or sweet tea.

The official opening is August 24, 2013, but there's a \\"soft open\\" starting August 21.\\n\\nI ordered a half pound of moist brisket, one sausage, a side of mashed potatoes, and a side of beans. I just drank water, since I didn't spot any Big Red in the store.\\n\\nThe sausage was pretty good, though could be a little better. The potatoes were great. The beans were fine, but strange - a recipe I can't remember having. But the main reason I went, of course, is the brisket.\\n\\nWhen I got to the front of the line, Wayne was smart enough to ask how I like my brisket - leaner or moister. I went for moist, of course. It's got a really good bark, and great texture. The only things holding it back for me were that it could use a little more smokiness and a little more rub (especially salt). Given that, I believe this is the best smoked brisket I've had in the state of Colorado, and I've had a lot. But it's not quite up to the standard of the best smokehouses of central Texas, which are Wayne's role models. \\n\\nI think the smoke issue may be because Wayne uses hickory instead of post oak. Post oak is the traditional wood for this style of cooking, but of course it's a matter of taste. And maybe he can't get post oak in pellets.\\n\\nOverall, I'm giving this 4 out of 5 stars. Wayne has done an amazingly good job emulating a BBQ joint from Lockhart or Luling, and assuming he keeps up this quality of food or improves on it, I'll be a repeat customer. You can see his love and understanding for the central Texas style of BBQ from his decor, which includes large photos on the wall of all the famous smokehouses from Austin, Lockhart, and Luling.\\n\\nAnother bonus: Wayne's Smoke Shack uses Square, which means if you have the Square app on your phone, you can just pay that way instead of with credit cards or cash. I'm a Square fanatic, so this convenience is a big deal to me. But of course they still take credit cards and cash if you're old fashioned that way."},{"name":"Roadhouse Pub","address":"55 Pulaski St","city":"Peabody","stars":"3","text":"Should be a fun local place, but really isn't.

They're one of the few Korean restaurants that do this!\\n\\nBok Bun Ja (Alcoholic beverage): 4/5. Very sweet black raspberry wine. Taste is similar to Umeshu (Japanese plum wine). Really light, pairs well with spicy food. \\n\\nService-wise, they were really great. No complaints. \\n\\nAlso I should mention that this place on a weekday night was so empty!

Yes, I've had their beer for years.  But while in Portland with its abundance of smaller breweries it seemed, well, very \\"not Portland\\" to eat here. Seemed like going to Disneyland when I'd really rather check out a dive bar. While with a group of not-as-adventurous-as-me eaters, Deschutes fit the bill perfectly, despite a very long wait to be seated.  \\n\\nFood:\\nBrewery Pretzel with Porter mustard was amazing.  I could have eaten four of them.  My steak and cheddar salad (flat iron steak, crispy onions, local cheddar) was a big portion and tasty.  Others at the table ordered the fried chicken and waffles, brewery burger, and the catch of the day.  All were happy with their food.\\nAs for the beers, I enjoyed a couple Inversion IPAs and tasted a cask-conditioned sour as well. I've always liked Deschutes beers, and this visit did not disappoint either.\\n\\nVibe:\\nDeschutes-equals-Disneyland-with-better-food-cool.  Brewhouse vibe, with a laid-back atmosphere and lots of light coming into the exposed brick dining room.  It's a huge place and is almost always jam-packed.  Best part? You can grab beers and drink in the foyer while waiting for your table.\\n\\nFamily-friendly:\\nYup.  My kids started with a carrots, apples, and celery plate (what?  really?  at a brewpub?  awesome).  Then they were busy coloring the kids menus.

It is also the kind of place that makes you wonder what took you so long: there is simply nothing about it not to love.\\n\\nFor starters, you have a gastropub-quality menu served with greasy-spoon portions and prices. We did the cleopopatra (vegetarian) sandwich, chicken tortilla salad, artichoke dip, and spicy (they mean it!) vegan black bean soup--the latter two served in a delicious bread bowl. Nearly everything is made fresh in-house: nachos, potato chips, salsa, and this awesome pickled veggie mix that comes on the side with all sandwiches. I'd have happily paid more for every item, and we were full and happy. (Followup from second visit on 9/21: chicken nachos with avocado and the house-made garlic habanero sauce also fantastic.)\\n\\nThe interior is looks like a dystopian 50s diner, dark and divey in a completely welcoming and unpretentious way. It's big, and would probably work well for groups. That's unless it's warm, in which case you'll want to sit on the picnic benches in the gorgeous adjacent patio. The inside also features pool tables, ping-pong, and vintage 80s and 90s arcade games at a quarter apiece. The diversions help make it the kind of place that you might drop into for a sandwich and happily stumble out of four hours later.\\n\\nThe beer selection is solid, with a number of craft brews and locals, although I went for the $2 low-rent tall boy special: PBR me, ASAP. The staffers were super nice and helpful. It was a Sunday night, so the sparse crowd seemed to be a lot of service people--good people, by and large, in my book.\\n\\nAfter cashing out and leaving with the missus, I wondered what the place could do better at this price point--what, reasonably, could keep me from giving it five stars--and really couldn't think of anything. If I lived closer to the East Side, I'd make it a weekly destination.

From the ultra polite host staff to the super attentive and knowledgeable waiter,  the dining experience itself was the best I've had in Atlanta. Bravo.\\n\\n2. Cocktails are delicious and creative and made by a true craftsman. \\n\\n3. A 10 course tasting menu for $105 really isn't all that bad in terms of value. I would not call it overpriced. \\n\\n4. The menu had highlights: \\n-Eggplant, garlic, pole beans\\n-Crab and zucchini\\n-Okra and egg yolk\\n-Both desserts\\n\\nNow, the bad....\\n\\n1. Okay, if your whole concept revolves around seasonal food, please invest in the best ingredients you can buy. I would have happily paid more for a tomato that didn't taste like it came from Publix.\\n\\n2. Some of the items was dramatically inconsistent.  As an example, my boyfriend and I tried one another's beef side by side and they tasted like two different meals. Mine was far more sour ( almost as though they over reduced the sauce) and his was great. \\n\\n3. Some dishes was sorely underseasoned. I'm very accustomed to high-end foods, and while I can certainly appreciate nuance in the ingredients on their own, some of the foods needed just a little bit of fine salt. The tomato comes to mind most notably here.\\n\\n4. A couple of the dishes were straight-up bad. Not subjectively bad, objectively bad. I think maybe a little too cerebral. \\n\\nOverall, I wish I could give this 3.5 stars, but I can't. I also won't give 4 stars to a restaurant I will likely not return to. So, 3 stars it is.

Yenching doesn't escape the overwhelming greasiness that tends to plague Chinese food, but the food definitely tastes pretty good. \\n\\nI love their beef chow fun (wide rice noodles) - the beef is pretty tender and the noodles aren't so excessively greasy that it's gross. The chow fun at the Kong tends to be thicker and clumped together - Yenching does it way better. It's slightly more expensive than the Kong, and doesn't stay open as late, but if given the choice I would definitely always pick Yenching.\\n\\nThey have a pretty awesome lunch menu - you get a full serving of a dish quite a few different sides: crispy egg rolls, soup, and sometimes fried rice.

Kinda like a Chinese \\"brunch\\" concept. They open early, close midday, and open up again at night. It duals as a wedding venue at night so its decor is quite colorful and gold. They have a menu but they also have little carts that are strolled around with all sorts of food on them. It's split into steamed dishes, fried dishes, and desserts -from what I have seen.\\n\\nYou can wait til they make their rounds or you can call them over to your table and choose what you want and immediately enjoy the food. They mark your table card to keep track of how much you order and then you check out at the end. Each dim sum plate is priced roughly between 3-5 dollars but portions are nice so it's meant to share with the whole table.\\n\\nThey serve you hot flower tea and they have little sugar crystals on your table for the teas. I absolutely love their tea! So warm and not too strong. It's a tea perfect for your meal. If you add a little sugar to it, it makes it taste even better! -I usually tweak the amount depending on how much sugar I already have in it.\\n\\nI got the usual dim sum which is always consistently delicious. Any dim sum with shrimp is probably my favorite. If you don't know the names, you can simply point to what you want and they'll grab it for you. \\n\\nI also tried their Peking duck/Beijing duck for the first time. It wasn't the best duck (according to my friend). The duck skin needed to be sliced thinner but the meat was very nice. It was buttery and the skin was decently crispy. They also cut it at your table and bring the rest back to make a second meal out of it for you. There was so much food we took almost half home! Definitely for bigger groups or you can take it home for dinner.\\n\\nAll-in-all, not the cleanest place but a classic dim sum shop. The Beijing duck is what lost the star for them. It wasn't as amazing as I heard it would be. I might try it again when I'm out in New York but the dim sum is always amazing and their tea is too."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Cool place to just chill, munch and drink some brew!!

From the time we stepped out of our car (complimentary valet), every single staff member was super friendly and attentive. The food was phenomenal. The dishes were medium sized and meant to be shared. We tried quite the variety: beef tartare, beets, agnolotti, aged pork, potato bread, beef sausage, and strawberry dessert. My favorites were definitely the beets and aged pork.

Their bibimbap was delicious since the stone bowl was nice and hot allowing the rice to get nice and crispy. They also provide plenty of toppings including well seasoned veggies and some beef. Next, their seafood pancake is also quite good with a very crispy exterior and an inside that isn't gummy or too floury. They also give a good amount of squid pieces and have an option for small size. Finally, their popular chicken cutlet is a great price with two large pieces, rice, fries and coleslaw for $11. Our table of two ordered all this food (of course we packed half of it) but we were stuffed! The place isn't too big but the two servers had trouble keeping up with clearing tables allowing a line to form during out meal here.\\n\\nOverall, the prices at Samsoonie for the amount and quality of food is great!

I went there for breakfast because they have one of the more extensive array of breakfast sandwiches.  Only Pine State Biscuits and Meat Cheese Bread come to mind as having that wide of a selection.  That's a good thing, but at the same time it makes choosing all the more difficult.  I'm not entirely sure why I chose the Steak & Egg sandwich.  I just have been craving red meat this morning. I think that I really would have been equally happy with the Butternut Squash Egg & Maple Sausage or the Char-grilled Mortadella & Eggs.  Each of which comes on a homemade biscuit.  They also make their own English muffins.  I saw a couple go out and they looked fantastic! So many choices and I didn't even get to the lunch menu!\\n\\nThe Steak & Eggs sandwich comes with a thinly sliced piece of Top Round which works well and has a nice beefy flavor.  There's also a slice of White Cheddar, a little bit of shredded cabbage, horseradish sauce, the aforementioned egg and, God bless 'em - pickles.  You'll have to forgive me, I have a thing about pickles!  All that is nicely situated on a toasted Kaiser roll.  It's a very good sandwich and it held up better than I anticipated.  I simply cut it in half and nothing slipped or dropped out of the roll. The steak was cooked through and I wish that I had requested it medium or medium rare, but it definitely was still moist and juicy.  It was also pretty tender, especially for Top Round.  It was, however, a little under-seasoned and could of benefited from a bit more salt. The flavors were well balanced.  The horseradish sauce was a nice addition, but didn't overwhelm the other components of the sandwich.  I enjoyed this sandwich. It's a nifty and portable way to have steak and eggs for breakfast!\\n\\nShut Up and Eat has beer, wine and spirits.  They also make Bloody Marys and Mimosas throughout the day.  So, they're a pretty good option for brunch and when I was there there wasn't a line, which is an increasingly rare event in Portland on the weekend.  They're out there a ways on Gladstone and 39th, but they're well worth the drive if you love great sandwiches!"},{"name":"Shiki","address":"9 Babcock St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"First, I didn't notice the gasoline smell mentioned in reviews dated 1/9/09 and 1/2/09, so I guess it is gone now.\\n\\nWhen we arrived for a late lunch after 1:30pm, there were maybe three parties there.  We ordered a Kaiseki Lunch (Kiku $16) and Broiled Salmon Teriyaki Teishoku Lunch ($12.95).  I don't eat raw fish (tried it a while ago, didn't like it), so I asked for the cooked item replacement, which turned out to be Avocado Salad - perfect! since I was curious about it anyways.\\n\\nIt was odd, but even though both our orders come with soup and salad, my miso soup and salad came out in the beginning with my friend's salad, but her soup arrived on the tray with the rest of the dishes constituting her lunch.  In addition to the normal seaweed and mini-cubes of tofu, there were some mini rolls of something.  The salad was refreshing with fresh romaine (I think) lettuce, slices of cucumbers, a grape tomato and tasty orange dressing.\\n\\nThe salmon lunch arrived in six plates/bowls on a tray.  The fish was perhaps the length of two decks of card - not too dry, but not particularly moist either.  The chef's choice of appetizer turned out to be Hiyayakko.  But cold tofu isn't very much to my taste... and I like tofu generally.  I didn't try the pickles which came with the dish.\\n\\nI think my Kiku Kaiseki Lunch was the better deal.  A rather large square plate was set before me with a multitude of items decoratively displayed.  A little plate of Tempura of 2 shrimp and 2 pieces of veggies were set to my left along with the usual bowl of tempura sauce and a bowl of rice.  The tempura was nice and light and went well with the sauce.  Okay, let's see... this lunch is supposed to consist of \\"appetizer, sashimi, tidbits, broiled, sauced, fried, steamed dish\\"...\\n\\n*Appetizer - seared white fish???  Part of it seemed too tough... I didn't finish this.\\n*Sashimi - replaced with the Avocado Salad which was placed decoratively on three slices of cucumber... tasty but a little too much dressing.\\n*Tidbits - peapods and radish? were okay; seaweed with sesame seeds were flavorful; I loved the little cubes of sweet egg; the single roll of what looked like seaweed and imitation crab I could have done without.\\n*Broiled - salmon, could be moister\\n*Sauced - I have no idea... as nothing seemed especially sauced... unless it was the little plate of veggies... that was interesting and tasty enough.\\n*Fried - Tempura, yum!\\n*Steamed - this was the easy one to figure out... Chawanmushi, the egg custard; light and tasty with at least four items in that little cup along with the egg.\\n\\nFor dessert options, they only had vanilla or mango ice cream... so we did without.\\n\\nI found service to be efficient, and the bathroom clean enough.\\n\\nI hope to go again sometime to try the izakaya dishes..."},{"name":"Shakers American Caf√©","address":"1308 Edgewater Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Shakers is just an average cafe.

Yesterday may have been my last time. They'll no longer let you get 2 tikka masalas. That's the only thing I would order and occasionally their potato dish when they had it. I had to order their chicken curry which was awful compared to their tikka masala. Apparently they were selling too many double tikka masalas and would run out. So why the heck wouldn't they cook more! They don't even cook it at the food truck. They bring it in from their separate restaurant. They'd sell a lot more of it if there's such a demand. That's business 101. \\n\\nTo make matters worse, they now charge $2.50 for a little spoonful of sauce to go over the rice. Their rice is bland since they don't offer biriyani, so it would be nice to have a sauce on top of it. \\n\\nI might pop my head in a month from now to see if they went back to allowing two tikka masalas, then they'd get my business back. \\n\\n\\nPrevious review at 4 stars:\\nI love the chicken masala here.

It was freezing that night and I was shivering all throughout dinner. Our waiter then proceeded to spill a tray of 6 waters onto the table and myself.

I ordered the drunk chicken brat, which I was excited to try, but our waiter came back 10 minutes later and told me they were out of it. He then proceeded to stand over me while I tried to decide what to order instead. I decided on the fried chicken brat. Both the brat and the biscuit was cold when it came out and was not appetizing.

I loved that they offer ciders for us not as hoppy ale beer lovers. I went with the Fox Barrel Pear Cider and it was very good. \\n\\nFor food, we shared the chili fries app and fried pickles. I did not try the pickles but the chili fries were fantastic!!!!! I had not ate dinner so I also had a side of the jalapeno mac and cheese. The mac and cheese is soooooo good! I highly recommend it! It has cheddar, manchego, jalape√±os, bread  crumbs & bacon lardons. The bread crumbs really give it texture and enhances the dish. \\n\\nThe one con and it is kind of a big one is parking on Rainey St. It is a bit of a nightmare.

We tend to drive all the way to Stoneham to a place called Tulip for Hibachi but thought to give this place a try since it's on our door step.  The interior has been tastefully done and there is nice dividing for more separation, but 90% of the restaurant is the Korean BBQ, 5% is 2 hibachi tables and the rest is the sushi bar.   We decided to try the Korean BBQ since they only had one hibachi chef and the kids were hungry.\\n\\nSo heres the issue:  the pricing is way too high when you want to do the BBQ.  Its $40 per adult and $15 per kid and it's a set price so there is no alternative.  Yes you can order off the menu but why can't you order off the menu one item and cook it yourself?  Thats the point of Korean BBQ.  Order it and cook it.  Not be forced to order $40 worth of food and feel like you have to stuff yourself to get what you paid for.  \\n\\nOur bill was already at $110 on a Tuesday night without anything to drink.  By the time we walked out it was $150 and unfortunately we won't be going back unless it's to do the hibachi.\\n\\nIts also a bit surprising this opened when we already have Dabin, Dikenyama and 2 Chinese.\\n\\nAdvice for the owner:  Fix the pricing"},{"name":"Volcano Sushi","address":"1861 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Okay Okay...I'm that debby downer.\\n\\nIt was alright.

Speaking of full, let's go over the food.\\n\\nI chose the brisket combo plate, or whatever it's called. There were about five or six pieces of brisket that I thought actually tasted better without the sauce. Sweet corn sounded like a...well, sweet side, so I went with that, and I asked the guy working there for a recommendation on another one. He picked potato salad so I went with that. Normally I'm just sorta \\"eh\\" on potato salad, but this is ON POINT. They know what they're doing with that stuff. Fantastic. They also put some sweet pickles into your order, which is a nice treat. Apparently you're also supposed to get bread with this plate, but I didn't get any. I think you're just supposed to grab it yourself from the bag they have out there? At least that's what another dude did. Maybe he was just extra hungry.\\n\\nService is very solid, too. Your food's ready in under 10 minutes, and the lone employee there was really friendly and personable.

But I feel a little like I am betraying a long time friend...the Draught House. Although I shouldn't feel too bad because it's hard to compare the two beer taverns. The Flying Saucer is great because it is new and still smells nice. I love the comfortable lounge furniture and wide open spaces. When weather is bad (like it is this January) then the F.S. is a better choice than D.H. due to the simple fact that you have room to spread out inside. I don't however like the scantily clad waitresses, although my boyfriend didn't seem to mind. They were helpful and very nice to me, but I just don't feel their uniforms are necessary. What else? The beer club is cool and we signed up! Only 197 more beers to drink till I get me a party! Oh, the food! I had their chips/salsa/queso and it was good. I would order it again. But what I CRAVE is their beer cheese soup that is served in a hollowed out bread bowl. YUM! In summary, I like this place but get there at 4:55 PM at the latest to get a spot on the sofas. Use your waitresses to help you pick a beer you will like; they are helpful but try not to stare at the short skirts. Join the beer club, it's a fun and a good excuse to drink more beer. Try their food, it is much better than plain old bar food.

The staff/management didn't seem to care or have any initiative. SLOW, would be putting it nicely. Our waiter even said that most of the staff is looking to go elsewhere.. And when we asked to speak to a manager, we were told \\"Our managers are busy\\"\\n- Food was once again inconsistent. Some of my us got our food, while other waited over 30 minutes, and there were only 4 of us... And we all ordered TACOS!!\\n- Every tacos we had was bland, and the tortillas were definitely sub-par and most likely old.\\n- Queso was served with a small amount of chips and when we asked for more we were told there would be a charge \\n- Frozen drinks were watery. Others tasted watered down.\\n\\nPROS:\\n- The place looks great. The designer/s did an awesome job.\\n\\nIn conclusion, to have the experience Mr. Zimmern wrote about you'd have to know the owners. Otherwise you're setting yourself up for disappointment. Do yourself a favor and go to the North Lamar location or better yet Torchy's to the north or south of Fresa's."},{"name":"Bistro Niko","address":"3344 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We just happened to walk by this restaurant by our hotel and decided to give it a shot.

I love individual hotpot ever since I had it for the first time at Boiling Wok in Dallas.\\n\\nUpon first entering the restaurant, I felt like it was a very typical Asian restaurant. Practical, not beautiful but useable. There's booths on both sides of the restaurants and tables in the middle. We got seated in the back left booth. It was there that I noticed that the bathroom sink is out in the open. Which, I know it's a \\"hip\\" thing nowadays to put a sink/mirror out in the open where everyone can see. It just gives me the sense that I'm eating in the restroom? I know it's probably too late... but a small part of me wishes it was more hidden off to the side instead of staring me in the face. \\n\\nAnyway, once we sit down we proceed to pour over the menu. My friend and I decide to share the chicken drunken noodles and hot pot with Tom Yum soup. The noodles.... were not good. They were kind of dry and chewy and generally not that tasty. If you come here I definitely recommend primarily trying out the hot pot. \\n\\nThe hot pot comes with 1 bowl of rice so naturally I asked for another bowl so my friend and I could share. The waitress points at my rice bowl and says I already have a bowl. Finally, she agrees to bring me another one but never ends up doing so. I flag down the other waitress who is much nicer and promptly brings us two bowls. The fire wasn't lit... which caused our soup to go cold so make sure the fire is lit! We did ask them to light it later and that very quickly warmed up our hot pot. My friend and I felt like the Tom Yum was not the best choice for the soup base. It made the vegetables taste sour. Additionally, the ingredients were interesting? The fish balls tasted kind of old and dry so I don't recommend choosing that. But I did appreciate the number of ingredients we could choose from.\\n\\nOverall, I would say the service was a 3. One waitress was really nice and the other one was a bit off putting. I think since this is a new restaurant they're still trying to figure out a system. I don't think they have set tables since we would get asked by both waitresses if we had ordered, etc.\\n\\nFood is also a 3 factoring in the fact that this is one of the few places that do individual hot pots in Austin.\\n\\nI think this place is worth coming to if it's convenient and near you. Make sure to call beforehand to make sure they're open. I tried coming earlier last week and they were not open.

Everyone was rolling in late for brunch on Friday after celebrations.  However, employee energy was high when I showed up.  Arrived at 11:30AM and sat down at the bar.\\n\\n1.  WHAT A WALL!  You really have to see it.  If I remember correctly they had 104 drinks on tap.  When I was there were 100 beers on tap, 2 or 3 ciders, and maybe root beer. Had a flight of local Texas breweries.  Was not disappointed!  The bartender was incredibly helpful in her recommendations.  She obviously could tell what I was enjoying most and came by with an ABW Pearlsnap on the house.  \\n\\n2.  The food.  Started off with some chili-cheese fries.  Please don't judge me too much for this decision.  I was enjoying a light cider and I felt we needed to indulge a little bit.  After finishing that, we put in orders for Banger's and Mash (my dish) and a Bratwurst (my dad's).  The sausages came out in about 10-15 minutes which did not seem like a long time since the massive wall of taps was \\"entertaining\\" us.  I loved my dish.  The textures were pretty great and the sausage had great flavor.  The Bratwurst had a really good bun accompanying it.  I wish I was a bit more adventurous with my meal decision since something like the dak bulgogi would be right up my alley.  I can't wait to come back soon.  I recommend checking the schedule to see if you can make it to one of the big events Banger's has every month.  I have to just look on from LA at the restaurant's instagram feed, wishing I was there during the huge pig roast or seafood cookout. \\n\\n3.  The service.  My party only interacted with the hostess and bartender.  Both were incredibly friendly throughout the hour spent there.  The bartender was very friendly and would talk to us often since the bar was somewhat empty.  She explained a lot about the local breweries and was very knowledgeable about every beer we inquired about.  I can't imagine how tough it is to keep traffic of 100+ drinks that are continuously changing week to week. \\n\\n4.  Atmosphere.  I unfortunately missed out on one of Banger's big events.  However when I was there, after I ate and got my last beer, I moved outside to enjoy the warm weather.  Despite it being around 103 at 12:30PM, I felt great and refreshed.  The sun came down pretty hard, but I got to enjoy an ice cold beer in the beer garden area.  \\n\\nConclusion:\\nI will be returning this summer.  This is the first place I tell anyone about that is visiting Austin.  I hope that I can check out different restaurants/bars like Banger's the next time I am in town.  I deliberately waited almost 10 months so that I would not give a snap decision review of the place.  Over that time, I have craved going back to Banger's almost monthly.

Easily the best brunch in midtown. Although, the service is a whole different story. Now I'm no expert on how a restaurant should be run but I can say that there is no evidence of training nor team work. I hear almost on every visit that the owners are struggling to have good reliable staff. It's clear that they hire and fire a lot or people quit. The hostess is the only constant I've seen at Joy Cafe. The wait staff is strictly focus on their very small section and completely neglect the surrounding tables. It's a small restaurant so I know that it's can be better managed. \\n\\nMy first suggestion: \\nThe two owners are alway present when I visit but they are doing the wrong things. One cleans tables and the other chats with the guest. Owners; Hire a solid busser to clean your tables and pay them tip share and minimum wage. Please laminate your menus it's so inexpensive, your guest are grossed out by menus that are wet and wrinkled. Stop talking to the guest when the restaurant is clearly in the weeds help your front and back of house stay organized because that clearly need the support. Finally, switch your guest wait list system from a \\"go outside and scream the next available table\\" to a simple text base method. \\"Will text you when your table is ready\\". It's so simple and a more organized setup. \\n\\nI really do enjoy this restaurant and that it's a family run business. You have the food down solid so put your focus in supporting your staff build them up, motivate them pay them well and make a killing.

So, you can imagine how surprised I was when I found out that ATL had at least two clay pot restaurants!  I came here and sampled the frog clay pot.

I was impressed by the authenticity here at Wan Lai.  The rice really did take in the frog and bacon/sausage flavors, making it perfectly delicious.  On the bottom of the pot, the rice was starting to get hard and crunchy, exactly like it should.  Almost all the other tables also ordered a clay pot rice dish of some sort, so I would recommend at least trying it out if you come here - I fully realize frog is everyone's thing, but they have plenty of other options.  Overall, portion sizes were about average, price was about average, too (8 bucks for my pot), but taste was very on point.  Wan Lai left a mark, and I definitely would come back to try other clay pot rice dishes.  \\n\\nOther things:\\n- The server recommended I try their dumplings/wontons here; apparently, they're very popular.

I know everyone loves this place.  I get it.  Airy outdoor Biergarten, tons of good brews, and some interesting and exotic sausages.   Seemingly a nice spot to settle down with a bunch of friends and have a good evening.\\n\\nBut this place sucks.  It has sucked mildly since the very beginning, but it's really accelerated downhill recently.  The food is decent.  I've had a wide assortment of sausages and sides, and they're all...fine.  They rely a little too much on creamy sauces to resurrect what can at times be a dry and bland link, but it's satisfying nonetheless.  Sides are generally good.  Mac & cheese, chili fries, grits, creamed corn, poutine.  All greasy and buttery and creamy and tasty.  \\n\\nBut Jesus is it expensive.  I love to watch the food being delivered, because the eyes of every single patron widen, and then a slight wrinkle develops at the brow, as if to say, \\"That's it?  That's what a $9 sausage looks like?\\"  It's all bun and sauce and toppings, and it's disappointing.  Last night, I paid $58 for two beers, two sausages, a side of mac & cheese, and a side of pickles.  While the price is high due to the overpriced food, a good portion of that bill can be attributed to my main complaint:  exceedingly poor service. \\n\\nThis is a regular old Wednesday night.  I'm there with a bunch of friends.  Business is brisk, as usual.  My group has been there ten minutes, and when I show up, I realize no one is drinking.  Our server shows up at least three times, and we relay each time that we want to get our food and drink orders in immediately.  As a friend raises a menu to her face and begins to speak, \\"Hold on one sec.\\"  And he's off.  For several minutes, he just inexplicably disappears.  This happened three times!\\n\\nFinally, he takes my order.  Without hyperbole, it was 15 minutes from that point until that first beer arrived in front of me--more than 40 minutes from the time I first sat down.  Some poutine and pickles arrived a little sooner, but I couldn't understand why none of us had a beverage with which to enjoy our appetizers.  You're a beer bar!  Serve me some god damned beer. \\n\\nTime continues to pass.  Everyone is hungry.  Empty jars of peanuts and pickles lay scattered around the table.  Pint glasses, drained of every last drop, rest before every patron.  Cold poutine and chili fries grow unappetizing, but I continue to snack because I ordered a sausage an hour ago and it still hasn't arrived.\\n\\nOur server shows up.  \\"The kitchen's a little backed up tonight.\\"  No shit.  It's not just tonight.  This is a routine that I go through every single time I eat at this place.  \\"So, uh, can I drink some more beer while I wait?\\"  The idea seems to surprise him.  He haphazardly hears more drink orders and heads off on another sabbatical.\\n\\nTime ticks by.  We arrived at 7pm.  It's nearly 9:00.  My pregnant wife grows antsy, and I'm frankly impressed by her restraint thus far.  Picnic benches are the worst God damned seating apparatus there is, especially for meals with a greater duration that my grandpa's Passover Seder.  The table is still littered only with empty glasses and cleaned appetizer trays. \\n\\nFinally, the food shows up.  There's a lot of confusion, and I think everyone got what they ordered, but it takes some time and three servers to get it straightened out.  All the while, another runner is desperately searching for someone in our party who ordered a can of cider.  Nobody ordered the cider.\\n\\nBefore me sat a jar of jalape√±o mac & cheese and a Louisiana Lightning sausage.  If you've never had the Lightning, it's freaking spicy.  I'm starving and looking forward to it, so I dig in.  But as my mouthparts heat up, one thing is missing: a drink to wash it down. \\n\\nNot less than ten minutes after our food arrived, the second round of drinks is delivered.  I had ordered another Buckethead which, while delicious, is not a thirst-quencher.\\n\\nSo I'm suffering through this spicy pepperfest with no drink at all, and once my IPA arrives, it doesn't help.  That alone isn't the server's fault.  But I blame him 100% for not refilling water glasses over the preceding two hours.  I fight the heat alone.\\n\\nDinner was uneventful.  Everyone is quiet, because we're all stuffing food in our mouths that we've been waiting two hours to enjoy.\\n\\nAt this point, it's getting late.  Conversations are dying down.  People need to get home to relieve the babysitter.  We need to pay for our dinner and leave.  Good luck with that!  Apparently what we need to do is wait.  Then the checks arrive.  And they're predictably wrong.  He had me paying for two \\"biscuits.\\"  Said he'd take them off.  He didn't.  Instead, added a 20% gratuity for himself.  F that.  I crossed that right out, thank you very much.  Zero effort and a three hour meal of sausage with only two--TWO!--drinks in that time gets you the most modest of tips, even from a generous guy such as myself.\\n\\nBen, clean this up.

Yet I did for this restaurant, and Yelp gave me the impression this place would be dated and stuffy. Somehow, I think the definitions of those words got lost over the years because I found Petite Auberge to be quite the opposite. Sure, my grandparents warned me that even at 7pm it would mostly be elderly people, and they were right. However, I saw a family of 7 (all children extremely well-behaved) and a few couples sitting around enjoying their meals as well. Stuffy? I'm afraid not!\\n\\nThen again, decor should be the cherry on top anyway. We don't go to restaurants to eat the tablecloth; we go for the food. Again, Petite Auberge delivered. The menu isn't too expansive, but there's certainly a little something for everything. A dinner ranged from $9 to $32 depending on what you ordered, something that is on par with most other restaurants in the city. I wound up trying the asparagus soup which was rich and succulent, followed by the almond trout with lemon rice. The fish was moist and packed with flavor, the almonds toasted just enough to bring out the nutty taste, and the rice was cooked perfectly. I enjoyed every bite! Out of curiosity, I convinced my table to order the Baked Alaskan for dessert, and it was quite a show. Liquid flames poured over the cake and browned it to perfection. I'm not a big sweets person, but this was delicious! I especially enjoyed the lemon sorbet at the top. Yum!\\n\\nOkay, so this place isn't the next hottest club spot on the map. Nor is it trying to be. It doesn't want to suddenly shift gears and be known as the Emory night spot; it's going for quiet interiors perfect for a lovely evening out with friends, family, or a date. It's a formula that's worked for this restaurant for the past 30+ years so there's no need to mess with the equation. These sorts of places are a dying breed in a city hell-bent on destroying its history, though, so come try it before anything happens to it (god forbid)!"},{"name":"Jack Allen's Kitchen Oak Hill","address":"7720 Hwy 71 W","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Some good ass food at a great value. \\n\\nThe GF and I came here for happy hour and were both very satisfied with the meal and service here at Jack Allen's. Maybe I just love the Gilmore family. Odd Duck is easily my favorite restaurant in Austin. Glad to see that Pops has a few tricks up his sleeve as well. \\n\\nTheir HH consists of half priced appetizers and drink specials. HH times are as follows: Monday-Friday 3pm-7pm and Saturday/Sunday, 3pm-5pm.\\n\\nThe two of us ordered the Chicken Nachos ($4.50 HH), BLT sliders ($5.50 HH), Red Chili Fries ($4 HH) and the Chicken Fried New York Strip ($13.99, not on HH). No, we did not finish it all. But man, it was very good. \\n\\nChicken Nachos - My least favorite out of the four items we ordered. Nachos aren't really my thang, so it's tough for me to say how good these were compared to others. The GF thought they were good, but noting special. $4.50 for this giant mound of chicken nachos is a great value however.\\n\\nBLT Sliders - Calling this a BLT slider is not doing it justice. Its a thick slice of wonderfully tender pork belly, micro greens, FRIED GREEN TOMATO, and some pimento cheese to top it off. This dish was a real winner. The pork belly was great, as expected. This family owns everything pork belly related. But the fried green tomato was a great addition and offered a nice textural component. I could've done without the pimento cheese, but it didn't take away from the slider. \\n\\nRed Chile Fries -  Awesome fries with a nice garlic aioli dip. Reminds me of a southern version of truffle oil fries with parmasean cheese, except they rub the fries with red chili and top it with cojita cheese. LARGE ass plate of these fries as well. \\n\\nChicken Fried NY Strip - Easily the best chicken fried steak I have ever eaten. And I've had my fair share of them. What separates the one here is the quality of meat. Pounded thin enough so it's chewable, but yet thick enough so that the beef doesn't disintegrate into your mouth. The breading stuck on and was very crunchy, and topped with a very hearty gravy. Served with mashed potatoes and veggies. Awesome. \\n\\nService was great, and the food came out super fast. Helps when you go at 4pm on a weekend I suppose. I was also very impressed with the fact that Jack Allen's gave us FULL portions on these HH specials. A big pet peeve of mine is when restaurants cut down portion size and put that on a HH menu. It is NOT a HH special when you offer smaller amounts of your dish for a smaller price. \\n\\nFor all of this good food, our bill some out to a little over $30.

We had to leave our kids to wait for the food in the form of take out as we had a prior engagement. I spoke briefly to the manager ,  I let him know that I am happy to pay for drinks and appetizers but did not expect to pay for our meals.  $118 later the bill was paid...$30 was deducted from our bill. I am a business owner and know all to well what a responsible owner does when the service is below par. You absorb the cost and keep a customer.

Inaccuracies aside, her tuna sandwich avec frites and my Bouchee salad with lardons (oh my god juicy salty hunks yum), fennel, asparagus, des haritcots verts, egg, and tomato were both excellent.  We also split the 3-cheese flatbread, which was pretty mediocre though for the money it was a good size.

Somebody needs to fix that. This is not at all something that people- or the tavern, probably- care about, so I'm not including that in my rating. Just a suggestion.\\n\\nWe sat in one of the booths along the back wall. No one waits on you so you have to order from the bar even if you're sitting at a table. Weird, but whatevs.\\n\\nWe all ended up getting a good buzz, off of two pitches of Allagash white on draught. The beer was really fresh and they served it with plenty of hefty lemon slices.\\n\\nThe food was kinda gross, not as bad as it could have been for bar food though. We ordered fried pickles initially, and then went for the teriyaki greens beans (also fried) and sweet potato fries. Imo every place that has sweet potato fries does them differently, and at Trackside they had a funny taste to them. I debated ordering the Trackside chili, because of the whole \\"Trackside chili\\" thing and what that might entail, but decided against it. Chili isn't really a share-able dish.\\n\\nOverall not my thing, but it's obviously a popular neighborhood hangout. There was a crowd of people by the dart boards, and a good number scattered around every where else.\\n\\nStrange plus: the outside patio has two tiny TVs for your viewing pleasure.

You won't regret it!"},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This is one of the better restaurants I have been to recently.  I wish I could have given it 5 stars. The food absolutely warrants it. The service however brought it down. \\n\\nLet's start with the good. Just to preface, awe were told all of the food at Canoe is locally sourced. They change the menu 4 times a year to adjust for the seasons. We ordered the Canoe's House Smoked Salmon on a Crispy Potato Cake with Vermont Goat's Cheese. It was good, not amazing. Amazing we'll get to in a minute! The appetizer was reminiscent of  a play on a bagel with lox and cream cheese(sans capers.) I would have in hindsight ordered something else but was not disappointed with the appetizer. \\n\\nAmazing is what ensued.  I ate Thumper. Bambi might have been a little bit upset but at the end of the day, it was GLORIOUS!!! Slow Roasted Carolina Rabbit with Swiss Chard - Bacon Ravioli, Sweet Potato Hash and Candied Garlic Sauce. For those of you who have never had rabbit, it is a slow roasted, tender sweet version of chicken. I have eaten many of Thumper's relatives over the years and the rabbit at Canoe may very well be the best I have ever had. For those of you who are environmentally conscious but still eat meat, it is one of the most sustainable sources of protein you can have. There is a reason why there is the age old adage of  \\" ___ like rabbits.\\" I gave my date a bite as she was leery eating rabbit as she thought they were \\"too cute to eat.\\" Begrudgingly, she loved it. As a side note, I don't have to tell you how amazing the bacon ravioli was. Bacon makes everything taste better!!  This is the only dish that has stayed on the Canoe menu since it opened its' doors in 1995. \\n\\nWe also had fish special. Honestly, I was so engrossed with my meal; I forgot exactly what my date had. She said it was good though. \\nFor dessert we had a trio of Cr√®me Brule. It was a Trio of Baileys, Kahlua and Godiva. As with anything it is a question of taste and your palate. I LOVED the Bailey's. The others were good as well and WELL worth ordering. \\n\\nThe only reason this restaurant did not otherwise receive 5 stars is sadly because of our server. The valet, hostess, bartender( I had a drink before my date got there) and the person who sat us were extremely professional and friendly. The person who sat us even took the liberty of taking my dates coat and told her it would be waiting by the hostess stand. I usually give waiters the benefit of the doubt as I was a waiter for a number of years. She was courteous in the beginning and made recommendations. However, thereafter there were 3 major mistakes she made.\\n\\nThe first and second were making us feel rushed. First, we ordered a bottle of red wine. Overlooking the generous 34 of a glass pour, she subsequently continued to pour generously throughout the meal. I even commented to my date and said, \\"If she pours more wine considering our glass is half full, I will be a little bit perturbed.\\" She did not fail to fail me...Secondly, as we were eating dessert; she drops the check as we are having the 1st bite. I know what many people who have been in the industry are thinking now: We were sitting and she might have been 1st cut. Not at all.... We had reservations on a Friday night at 8:00 PM and she dropped off the check at 9:00PM. The last time I was rushed like that I was at a diner in New Jersey. \\n\\nThe final mistake was my date was kind enough to pick up the tab. She has a very feminine name. Her name is not Pat, Chris or Jesse. The waitress handed me the slip to sign anyway and addressed me with her last name! I know waiters may have bad nights so I will not describe what she looks like. I hope this was an isolated event.\\n \\nOtherwise, the meal was absolutely incredible and would absolutely return.  I would comfortably put this restaurant as a must eat restaurant in Atlanta."},{"name":"Varuni Napoli - Krog","address":"99 Krog St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Undercook bread.

Our three subsequent visits didn't compare to the first, in most respects. I ordered the veal parmesan again tonight. The veal was not tender, and didn't taste fresh. The preparation was okay, but it was skimpy on the cheese as well. I asked for fettucini instead of garlic spaghetti, and the alfredo sauce was bland. The house salad was good, different than I remembered. I wouldn't say the iceberg lettuce was terribly fresh, but there were nice little piles of black olives, grape tomato halves, and pepperoncini. My husband had chicken parm and rated it a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10. I ordered a piece of carrot cake for dessert, and it came with a nice presentation of candied walnuts and caramel drizzle. The taste and quality of the cake were forgettable, but the biggest disappointment of the night was the dollop of Cool Whip on each corner of the plate. The bread, served with garlic butter spread as well as  olive oil/balsamic/grated parmesan cheese, was excellent. Our service this visit was BAD. It took a good 30 minutes to get drinks and submit our orders. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time, but we waited another 20 minutes after dessert to get our check. No water refills, and my husband was only offered a drink refill after the check was put down. The fact that Rosa & Rocco's is STILL running a Groupon tells me they are hurting a bit, and given the decline in the food and the service, I don't think they'll be around long."},{"name":"Sweetwater Tavern","address":"3 Boylston P","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Sweetwater sure is consistent - as in consistently awful, service-wise.

Michael's Bistro & Bar","address":"595 S 3rd St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"I came here for restaurant week and was excited about the options that we had to choose from.  The valet staff was very friendly but it seems rather confusing that the valet held the door open for us but the main entrance (near the host stand) was down at the end of the bar.  For someone who had never been here before, it was a bit confusing.\\n\\nWe were seated right away in a nice part of the restaurant, the only problem was we were at a booth and its a bit difficult to scoot along to get into a booth while wearing a skirt and still maintain some of your dignity.  The waiter had to grab onto the table cloth because it caught onto my skirt.\\n\\nWith a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc, we ordered the cheddar and Bass Ale soup (which was delicious!) and the clam linguine.  For main, the Crab cakes (which were predictable lumps served on top of bland red beans, rice, and spinach) and Scallops (which again, didn't seem to have an outstanding flavor).  For dessert we both had a panna cotta which finally had a nice balance of creamy vanilla and tart fruit.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself was nice and I have to say I like the touch of having a bottle of mouthwash with cups in the bathroom for a post-meal touch-up (although there wasn't enough spice in my meal to really warrant it).\\n\\nBut it was the service that brought G Michael's down in rating.  Our server was a bit too interested in our personal conversation (making comments and such) and took quite a while just taking our wine order and serving the wine before giving us any information on that night's menu.  He had to read the specials from notes and didn't give us any suggestions as to what might be good that night.  We were given our bread with no mention as to what was in the butter and it took us a few minutes to realize it was peppers (luckily, both of us don't mind them) and we were given 3 pieces of bread for 2 people.  Seems as though 1 person didn't get a 2nd piece or we had to share.  He also brought us the check before we had even started our desserts and still had a full glass of wine for each of us on the table.  That certainly sealed that we were not going to stay for a cup of coffee."},{"name":"North By Northwest Restaurant & Brewery - Stonelake","address":"10010 Capital Of Tx Hwy N","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I'd heard lots of excellent things about this restaurant and decided to give it a try during the late afternoon yesterday. Boyf and I arrived around 2 to a very cheerful hostess who engaged us in a friendly (although a bit lengthy) conversation before seating us. \\n\\nOur server didn't introduce himself (a huge pet peeve of mine) and just asked if we knew what we wanted. I ordered the bourbon-aged black ale and boyf ordered the amber ale. Our drinks were brought back promptly; the bourbon-aged black ale was woefully under-carbonated but had a strong (delicious) bourbon flavor. The amber was decent but a bit sweet. \\n\\nWe both ordered the burger rare; boyf got cheddar cheese on his and I ordered Huntsman, which, according to the menu, was a 'blend' of cheddar and bleu cheese. The burgers were cooked perfectly, but the (shredded!?) cheese wasn't melted on boyf's burger, and my \\"Huntsman\\" cheese was nothing more than unmelted (gross) bleu cheese crumbles and shredded cheddar. I would've expected so much more than shredded cheese out of a bag from this place!!\\n\\nI have to admit, the worst part of this experience was Unnamed Waiter's attitude. He was rude, informal, and didn't really seem to care about anything going on. Maybe he was just having a bad day, but his behavior really turned me off and made me not want to come back.\\n\\nOne star for the hostess, one star for the burger, minus one star for the lazy cheese situation (seriously guys?) and minus two stars for Mr. Lackluster.

Last night was one of those times.  As we did the obligatory 10-minute wait in the lobby for a table, I noticed Gustav's is now peddling growlers.  I found that weird.  With all the great breweries and growler fill stations in Portland, why would a restaurant that has good, but inferior German beer, push growlers.  Apparently this was an accurate assessment because I saw no one buying a growler or walking in with their empty growler to get it filled.\\n\\nAfter getting seated we ordered our standard opening act of fondue.  This was the first sign of trouble.  The fondue had lost its flavor and become a bowl of white, salty, and tasteless liquid.  But the bread was the real red flag.  It was hard and stale.  Pigeons would have turned up their nose at this bread.\\nThe next strangeness was my wife's wine which seemed watered down.  I've heard of watering down hard liquor, but wine. I'm sure it was just our imagination.\\n\\nBut even with these oddities, I was confident my palate would be satisfied with some good German food.  WRONG.

Nuff said."},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Hawker's South Asian Fare: Roti Canai... OMG, I die!\\nThis place came to my attention immediately after it opened. It was the name that caught my attention: Hawker's. And I thought to myself  \\"Could it be?\\" So, it was only a matter of time before my mouth met their food. And as a former (and picky) hawker customer, I was really looking forward to it. \\n\\nFor individuals unfamiliar with the term, Hawkers are signature to Asian countries (and arguably, in many other parts of the world). They are street vendors who usually vocalize what's being offered in a loud, aggressive format. Usually on self-drawn carts or makeshift stalls, they are the Asian version of a food truck (well, minus the truck). Hence the etymology of the word 'Hawker'- from middle low German 'hoken', meaning 'to peddle' or 'to bear on one's back'. Typically, they only showcase a handful of cheap-but-delicious items that are often codependent in their recipes (either they utilize a similar list of ingredients or one item is part of another item's creation). The Hawker Stand is an example of a classic business structure- delectable food leads to more money which results in a more lavish display of food, a bigger cart, and, ultimately, a permanent spot on the street where people use the eatery as place to rendezvous and spend even more money. In other words, if your food is awesome, you'll rise to the top.\\n\\nLuckily, the restaurant showcases more than just a handful of choices. But the small-plate concept and cheap prices remain. And now the math- Szechuan style wings $4, Vegetarian Summer Rolls $3, Satay Chicken Tacos $5, Roti Canai $3, Cantonese Ginger Chicken $4.50, and Malaysian Prawn Mee $6.\\n\\nThey were out of Hainanese sauce, so Szechuan happened to be a second choice. Five wings appeared as our appetizer and they were fairly small. The unfortunate part, however, was that they weren't spicy enough. When you think of Szechuan, the connotation is definitely chili heat- and this dish was toned down quite a few notches. The Vegetarian Summer Rolls were fine with the standard fillings of vermicelli rice noodles, cabbage, carrots, and scallions. The adjoining peanut sauce was pleasantly on the sweet side. The Satay Chicken Tacos were nothing exceptional. It was a mild m√©lange of flavors with no single note flying higher than the rest. The tacos desperately needed some acid, which a single wedge of lime atop a small portion of salsa thankfully provided.\\n\\nThe tide turned favorably when the Roti Canai arrived. It was CRIMINALLY DELICIOUS. Alternatively called Roti Chennai/Parata, it's a Malaysian dish with Indian origins. The small portion of curry sauce with a lump of potato was stupendously addictive. My stomach was instantly imprisoned by tasty lip smacks of curry intertwined with some SERIOUSLY FLAKY ROTI (see the adjoining short video clip of it at my blog). I could've easily made a fool of myself and licked the bowl clean. The curry was creamy and well balanced. A range of spices (cumin, coriander, and cinnamon to name a few) sang like a harmonious choir that elevated the dish into a synergetic stratosphere. In short, magic.\\n\\nThe Cantonese Ginger Chicken showed elegance in simplicity. Simple, ground ginger paste accompanied with perfectly moist saut√©ed chicken strips spelled Y-U-M. Ginger paste, though usually used as a pre-cook marinade, worked well just as it was. On the other hand, the Prawn Mee was a toss-up. It was recently prepared and served. Hence, the ingredients were layered and presented just as the menu described. However, a slow cooked approach (as soups often have) would have intermingled the flavors of chicken, egg, chili sauce, and jumbo shrimp more successfully. If this were back in Asia, I would've opted for the Hawker stand selling soup that had been simmering in a giant wok for hours rather than one that served a la minute.   \\n\\nWhen one of the co-owners, Kaleb Harrell, arrived for a quick interview, it came to no surprise to find out that the place is owned by people who have a lineage in the Hawker business. And the menu definitely speaks of the diversity in the ownership as well- Hong Kong natives, Northern Chinese, Malaysian, and Vietnamese bring the Asian diaspora to the restaurant's table. I did manage to ask him about the soup and his responded that the chefs are still deliberating between themselves which technique should prevail. He also pointed out the detail in d√©cor for the place was specific to the concept- right down the very tables styled with laminated Chinese newspapers (so reminiscent of eating food from a Hawker's newspaper cone).\\n\\nIN A NUT SHELL: Go for the Roti Canai. It's great. The place is young and the owners are receptive to your suggestions- especially for a second location that they are planning in the works. The success of a traditional hawker stand is very physically evident- a long queue. Here's hoping this joint has one."},{"name":"Fellini's Pizza","address":"4429 Roswell Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great pizza and great prices.

I got the South End sandwich, waffle fries, coffee ice cream, and had a couple bites of the WuBurger. The South End is one of the better chicken sandwiches I've had. The chicken is juicy and well portioned, and the bun was buttered and had a ton of sesame seeds (seriously, it was covered). I'd probably skip the cheese the next time though. The WuBurger was great, especially the meat, though I wasn't too fond of the mayo-like special sauce. Still an excellent burger, and miles better than any of the fast food places nearby. Waffle fries were great, as well as the ice cream, which is from Richardsons farm. Love that they source most of their ingredients locally. The decor is retro, and the booths are fun for groups.

So finally we drug our asses out on a Friday night, despite the frigid temps.  Sadly, H Harper Station didn't quite live up to our expectations.  \\n\\nLet's start off with the drinks.  The beer and wine list is decent, but the mixed drinks are definitely what to get here.  I had the Sloe Gin Fizz.  I've never had one before but it was surprisingly tasty.  Since I was the designated driver for the night, I had to sober up so no more drinky-drinks for me.  But the husband did imbibe.  He tried 2 of the rum drinks, the Macondo and the Rum Crusta.  I did have a tiny sip of each.  First off, I'm not a big rum fan. So the drinks were just meh to me.  The husband who enjoys rum much more, was just as meh.  Based on the vibe of the entire restaurant, probably the Classic or Bourbon / Scotch / Whiskey drinks are the way to go.  The drinks are pricey, but it's not out of line for a specialty hand crafted cocktail.  As others have mentioned, getting a drink does take some time.  In fact, our appetizer came out before our drinks.  I understand that their drinks do take some time to make.  But if the drinks are that time consuming to make and you have a lot of people in the restaurant imbibing, you might want to get another person in their mixing drinks.\\n\\nNow onto the food.  As an appetizer we had the Chicken and Dumplings.  It was very tasty and the flavor was a bit unique, and was a even mushroomy, at least to me.  The only downside was the temperature.  The Chicken and Dumplings was warm, but cooled off quickly.  Not that I want my soup to be 'burn the roof off of your mouth hot', but it could have stood to be a few degrees warmer.  For the main coarse, I had the Bacon and Egg Fettucini, basically their take on Carbonara.  The flavors were there and the pork belly was heavenly, with just the right amount of sweetness.  But the texture was off.  I'm not sure what happened, but the sauce was extremely watered down for some reason.  Therefore none of it stuck to the noodles.  Boo.  And when I broke open my poached egg, hoping to mix yummy egg yolk with my pasta, it got overly diluted in the watery sauce.  Maybe the noodles weren't fully drained?  The portions are smaller, but I wouldn't say that the food is overpriced by any means.  I've paid higher prices for worse meals.\\n\\nIf I'm to venture to H Harper Station again, I'd probably just come for the drinks and to have small plate or two.  Next time, I'll make the husband be the sober one."},{"name":"Kathmandu Kitchen & Grill","address":"926 Montreal Rd","city":"Clarkston","stars":"4","text":"I would've gave this place 4 stars but I just had to give it three stars for the sake of clarity.

Ok it took the manager like 10 minutes to bring my food (which wasn't the issue) however, upon receiving my food it was placed in several small containers which wasn't a good sign to me.  I say this because I ordered goat meat as the choice of meat.  After arriving home, I began sorting through my food, I saw the container for my goat meat and man it only had like 5 tiny pieces of meat!  Thus, you can say I truly did felt like I just been ripped off, the food was great but the portion of it was an insult.

Dough is flaky and was not overdone when I had it.  The Domathes were well stuffed and had a good flavor as well.  I also tried the Pot Roast and Hummus and what can I say they were pot roast and hummus.  I wish that they had an option to just do a 3 side plate and I would do that on occasion.

IHOP corporate should be ashamed for the lack of professionalism and inappropriate behavior of the cooking staff who were clearly harassing a transgender male employee.  I will likely discontinue patronizing the IHOP franchise PERIOD.  It was about 1:20pm this Sunday afternoon when my child and I arrived for breakfast.  The employee who appeared to be a transgender male was doing his job minding his own business while the male cooks in the kitchen were speaking extremely loud for the restaurant full of customers to hear.  They did not seem to care as their target was the transgender male employee.  The taunting  went on from the time we were seated at a booth to my order was placed and the food arrived.  Initially, I did not know what was happening but noticed that the two male employees cooking in the kitchen were looking over at the employee.  Their speech became louder and louder and looked around trying to figure out what was happening.  It soon became clear to me that what was happening was that the transgender male employee was being taunted as he stood with his back away from the kitchen folding and wrapping utencils in napkins.  The two male cooks then started loudly saying how it's 'Adam and Eve' not 'Adam and Steve'.  They continued this phrase from the time I placed my order until my food came out.  I watched as the transgender man repetitively folded napkins with his head down as if he was embarassed.  He seemed to shrink as if he wanted to disappear from the scene.  I looked around and noticed that all of the other staff members said nothing and just continued working taking food to customer tables and waiting at the kitchen for the food the cooks were preparing.   The restaurant was completely packed this afternoon but that did not seem to stop the two cooks from repeating what appeared to be a passive aggressive taunting at the transgender male employee.  I was disgusted and shortly after our meal came out I asked our female waitress Jenee if I could speak with the manager.  I complained to the manager about what I was witnessing and how inappropriate it was and that IHOP is a national chain and should not allow this kind of behavior and disrespect towards the transgender male.  I told the manager that I did not want to spend my money at a restaurant where this kind of hostile activity is allowed.  The manager abruptly said that he would handle it and walked off.  He did not apologize.   It became clear to me then that he had been present the whole time while the cooks were taunting the employee.  He appeared to not take the incident seriously as I saw the manager stand behind both cooks and they each turned their eyes toward me and stared at me.  I immediately got up and told the waitress that I would not be dining at the restaurant and did not want my food.  She first apologized and asked me if I wanted her to box up my food and I said No I don't want the food and I told her it is horrible what I just witnessed at this restaurant.  She immediately said that she did not have anything to do with it and that she just works there.  But then she commented that the employee (referring to the transgender male) is in on the joke and doesn't have a problem with it.  It is at that point that It was confirmed to me that the whole staff has been harassing the transgender male for sometime. I looked over at him as I did earlier and saw that he did not look at all amused by the incident.  I will be writing a formal complaint not only to IHOP corporate office but also to the Better Business Bureau as this behavior as this incident as someone should be held accountable for this behavior.  I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  There is enough bias and hostility going on around us and we - customers should not be subjected to employee lack of training, sensitivity and unprofessionalism toward anyone including LGBTQ people.   If you are an ally of LGBTQ or anyone who cares about treating everyone with respect and decency, please join me in not patronizing establishments like this one where the manager and staff are creating a horrible environment for customers and employees alike.  Take your money elsewhere as IHOP has not trained their management or staff on how to behave in what should be a professional environment for dining and enjoying family and friends.  I am beyond levid and disappointed by what I witnessed today.  To the transgender employee at IHOP please know that you have an ally and you should not ever be treated less than anyone else."},{"name":"Donair King Restaurant","address":"1028 Davie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"One of my favourite donair/shawarma joints in the city.

There were certain things that they executed well and some that fell flat.  Overall, we had a reasonable meal here, although the dishes felt one-dimensional.\\n\\nWe ate here on Saturday night.  The restaurant is very big and pretty.  Our server was helpful and knowledgeable.  No complaints about the service or the atmosphere.  \\n\\nWe started with a couple of glasses of wine and an appetizer.  We ordered the escargot en croute.  Now, I wasn't expecting Paris-level execution, but I did feel that the garlic butter was a bit overwhelming.  The puff pastry was cute and tasty, but took away from the escargot itself.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  \\n\\nFor my main course, I ordered the bouillabaisse.  This wasn't one of the dishes recommended by our server, but it's listed in the top portion of the menu with a swirly design around it- the area usually reserved for the restaurant's special.  The fish in it (bass, cod, shrimp, scallops) were all good and fresh.  The issue was really the sauce.  It was described as a lobster broth but in all honesty it felt too heavy - like a canned tomato soup.  It came with a piece of bread which appeared to have a mayonnaise based spread on it - skip.  Both other members of my party got the scallops, which I liked better than my dish, but again, very one-dimensional texture and flavor-wise.  \\n\\nWhat really saved this meal was the dessert.  The profiteroles and the chocolate sundae were both good.  They weren't mind blowing, but they were enjoyable and solid.  The profiteroles were mostly ice cream though - not very classic.  In my opinion, a profiteroles should have more pastry to it (see the image).  Regardless, the dessert was good.\\n\\nOverall, this place was just alright.

An artisinal cheese plate should never consist of something that I can get out of a deli at PUBLIX. The waitress said the cheese plate consisted of Tillamook Cheddar, Swiss, and a goat cheese. Really? The charcuterie plate also had Genoa salami. This was sadly underwhelming and took the wind right out of my sails. Could you be more creative here?

The bartender (long blonde hair and acid wash jean shorts) was snacking on a granola bar behind the bar and after licked her fingers and started to serve, same bartender reached in what I assume was a cooler filled with chilled glasses for beer.... As she reached in for glass number 2, her long blonde hair filled the other glass she was holding, and again, went on to serve customers with that glass. My husband finally arrived and we waited about another 10-15 minutes for our server to come over to us, which never happened.

No worries.  You can rest your spine on your chair back, eat your meal, and read the paper.  No host will urge you to feed your meter and while you're outside digging for that elusive quarter, clear your table, seat another customer then upon re-entry hand you the check with attitude.  A fictional story but any one of Sound Bites' regulars could attest to its plausibility.\\n\\nAfter a decade of often regrettable patronage to Sound Bites and nearly a dozen visits to Ball Square Cafe, I say confidently, there are differences.  While SB and BSC share some of the same menu items, their food is not equal.  When it comes to French toast, Ball Square Cafe has Sound Bites beat.  The grilled, challah, French toast reminds me of homemade fried dough.   It's buttery, crisp, and dusted with powdered sugar, is warm, downy and the color of butter on the inside.  After sampling five of the eight French toast selections, all are outstanding and better than any ever eaten in the 'ville.  Those most worthy of mention are the tri-berry, which is dotted with three kinds of fresh berries and homemade whipped cream, the banana stuffed, stuffed with cream cheese and bananas (so good), and the caramelized banana and strawberry.  \\nAfter sampling the savory steak and cheese or the asparagus and prosciutto omelets, an agnostic could think they're worth recalling grace.  The corned beef hash tastes like the one made in a  Jewish kitchen.  The turkey bacon looks and tastes like a favorite brand I buy at Whole Foods.  Even the veggie sausage is good.  \\n\\nWhat Ball Square Cafe does better than Sound Bites is food, service, and cleanliness.  I hate their hard chairs, but maybe I've a touch of Goldilock's Syndrome.

Razor clams were just average.  Kind of dry and unadorned, which is fine, but 7 bucks for razor clams is pretty ridiculous.  I could dig them in Long Beach or buy at ABC seafood for 10 times the value and certainly fresher than this order.\\n\\nRest of meal was OK.  Sushi was fresh, cuts were pretty conservative and small and I think everything on the menu looks at least $1 higher than in the past.  Sushi chef was very nice, attentive and assertive with the staff, but I gotta say, folks who complain about the service are probably right.  It's never been great there and last night was pretty weak.  Yes, they got slammed, but the sense of urgency never seemed to register with the understaffed and seemingly inexperienced wait help.

I know i'm form the South so thats what i prefer. \\n\\nThe parking lot is SMALL. The place is big they will will have a problem with parking. There isn't any parking in the back. You might just have to park at other stores but I did find that in the back there is an empty antique shop with plenty of park available. I'm sure weekends will be a bit more relaxed with parking. Just try to come early or late and avoid the lunch rush. \\n\\nYou can choose where to sit and everything is served in styrofoam plates. YES you have a server and you need to keep in mind of tipping.  Seems like this place is new and most of them or at least our server was still in training. I wish they were a bit nicer and it took so long to get our water. I honestly don't think they need servers for food that comes out on styrofoam plates IMO, but it is what it is. \\n\\nBe prepared to wait at least 15 mins once you order. They fry your chicken fresh so make sure you have time. Looks like to go orders are popular too. \\n\\nIm glad to see this close by work. Other than the server, I enjoyed the food. I think this place is a must come back.

Was I horribly mistaken. Not only my order was not ready on time but I actually think they forgot about it. With 30 min to my guests arrival they delivered the most horrible platter I have ever seen. White toast all cut in different triangle sizes with some kind of either egg/ chicken/cream cheese cucumber salad in between. Some had too much and some not at all. It was so bad that I wasn't able to serve them and had a friend return the platter to the cafe and ran to Publix to get some cheese and crackers. Later I wrote a nice email to Joy explaining my disappointment and realizing there must have been some issues in the kitchen that day. I have waited for almost 3 weeks for an apology response and nothing arrived in my mail. So I am writing this review because I realize we all have good days and some bad but the response to issues and customer service is what makes a business trustworthy and for that reason I would not recommend joys cafe for any catering services.

Chile rellenos is my favorite Mexican dish, and the ones they make here are the best I've ever had. The Chile Colorado is great, the fajitas are delicious, the mole is superb -- I've never had anything that wasn't fantastic. My only critique would be that the salsa they serve with the complimentary chips and salsa is pretty mild, and I wouldn't mind if it had a bit of a kick. \\n\\nOn top of the delicious food, the owners are so kind.

That is not the restaurant's fault, but it is a factor if you're just trying to go in and eat some freakin' chicken.

It is a couple of blocks off the square in Decatur, and on the back side of an office building.  \\n\\nI don't recall exactly when we went, but I know it was warm enough to sit out on the patio that evening.  When we stepped inside inside the waitress told us we could sit anywhere.  The inside space is limited, but very intimate.  I though for an inexpensive dinner date, this place had an incredibly romantic ambiance.\\n\\nWe ordered the appetizer platter and everything on it was very good.  I seem to recall the babaganoush type dish had a really wonderful smokey flavor.  We talked with the waitress a bit about it and the dish is not exactly babaganoush, but very similar.  My personal opinion of the pita bread was that it was very good and I liked that it was slightly crisp on the outside, but not hard or crunchy.  I told my husband that I felt a bit silly for commenting on how good the pita bread was, because I assume that is the one thing that isn't made fresh.\\n\\nFor the entree he had the Andryannis greek platter (with all the meat) and I had the falafel platter.  I thought everything was well seasoned.  Personally, I go back for the lamb gyro meat alone.  I tried it both with and without sauce, and decided that it really was seasoned to perfection alone.  The whole reason I ordered the falafel was because the waitress told us that they grill it.  I'm willing to go out on a limb here and say that I probably takes more time to grill falafel than it does to effortlessly throw it in a fryer.  I think good food is worth waiting for, and the falafel did not disappoint me.\\n\\nThe service when we were there was amazing.  To me it felt very personal and more like I was being hosted into their home.  The waitress that evening was the chef's wife and both were incredibly welcoming and polite.

The food is OUTSTANDING. Absolutely some of the best vegan food I've eaten. However, the service is hit or miss. We've visited three times. The first two times we visited, there were hardly any other customers there so we had no issues. Out table was set. We got refills. Our food was fresh. In and out in under an hour. The second time was the best because the waiter came and chatted with us when we were about done with our food and was super friendly. We talked about how long we had been vegans and what kind of meals we like to cook at home, etc. \\n\\nWe ate there for a third time on Sunday at around 5pm. There were a ton of customers but we were able to find a table with enough chairs. The short waiter (teenager I'm assuming?) has absolutely zero customer service skills. He barely spoke to us at all. Definitely never smiled or seemed interested in our table. We had to ask the nice tall waiter (the one that was so nice from our second visit) for utensils. I finally got our waiter's attention for water and he just kind of hard-blinked at me and I guess nodded? But then a minute or two later he never returned with water. Then I had to motion again and ask \\"Can I get some more water?\\" and he sort of just looked at me and walked away to go get water. He never checked on us to ask how our meal was or if we needed anything. I kept looking over to see if he'd make eye contact so that I could get a to-go box and our checks. Never once glanced at us. The nice tall waiter saw me looking over and looked concerned and came over finally to ask if everything was okay. I wish our tip could have gone to him because he was the only one to help us. When he returned with our checks, he had given us a big discount because he knew our service had been bad.\\n\\nI wish I could give more stars but it was really unfortunate with how that last visit went.

Waiting a while to order my drink I had plenty of time to observe that the bartender is dodging eye contact with all guests and just pointing at people when it's there turn to order. Finally he points at me and I order 3 drinks, pay and he hands me only one. I see the other two glasses of wine on the counter partially full, and since it was the house tap wine I figured maybe they had to switch over the keg. I wait 15 minutes and he again will not look at me for me to ask if this is indeed the case, or if he just forgot to hand me my drinks. It got to the point where he was directly across from me, 2 feet away from me and I said excuse me five times to attempt to get his attention. It became quite clear that he was blatantly ignoring me. \\n\\nAt this point I am so frustrated that I proceed to tell the hostess and ask to speak with a manager. She will not let me speak to the manager however assures me she will take care of it. By this time, after being in the restaurant for 30 minutes still without a drink a high top has opened up so we sit for dinner. I see the hostess tell the manager about the occurrence and neither she the hostess, or the manager follow up with me about this. \\n\\nLuckily, our waitress was a complete sweetheart and took care of the situation and got us the drinks we had paid for.

You will be surprised how many places only toast one side.\\n\\nThe ribs were perfectly cooked and had a great smoke ring and lots of flavor. Sauce was not required in my opinion. The pulled Pork was great. I loved how they let the smoke do the work and did not over season the meat. ALL of the sauces work well with the Pulled Pork. Now for the star of the plate...

I wouldn't quite call it the best brewery in Portland, but it sure is putting up a solid fight for the title.\\n\\nFor the beer. Drink it all. Your best bet is tasting flights, the tap list is usually quite impressive. There will be something to almost every palette. It's a NorthWest brewery, the IPAs are bitter, and lovely. As one of the progenitors of the Cascadian Dark Ale style, they produce one of the best during the Spring Months, the aptly named \\"Hop in the Dark\\".\\n\\nTo the food, I've yet to find something I don't enjoy. Brisket, Clams steamed in beer, pastas, burgers. Everything you'd expect in a decent Portland beer pub. Combined with friendly service, and great atmosphere(Check out the wood carving!) It's an enjoyable meal.\\n\\nHowever, not all is perfect in Deschutes land. It gets *PACKED* You will wait an hour easily on a Friday or Weekend. The prices are a bit expensive. But the ambiance, quality, and double header with the beer selection more than offset the price. \\n\\nIf you're visiting the Portland Breweries. Make sure this one is on the list.

It's definitely a go to for Asian fusion for us. We always order the roti canai which is a light fried bread and a curry dipping sauce. A great starter for the experience here. Also, Yelpers need to check in here for the wok fried lettuce because it's free if you do! Not only that, it's something I would have never tried otherwise but it's really good. The lettuce is crisp and the soy sauce has a sweet and spicy perfect mix. I've been ordering the Asian curry as my main dish but it's very small. I even ordered it tonight with extra chicken but it was still not enough for a meal. However, please note I like lots of protein and I'm not big on the carbs. You can get it with white or brown rice, but I would rather they load me up with protein and not cheap carbs. That's just my preference. I've ordered the Singapore Mei Fun in the past and it's really good. Complete with vermicelli, shrimp, chicken and veggies and a light curry sauce.

I like this. You know that the food is fresh. \\nWe ordered 1 pound of moist Brisket, with 3 sides, baked beans, mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes, along with some jalapenos, onions, and pickles made in the store. We were also given some rolls. There were three sauces, Texas gold (a golden mustard with a kick), a hot and spicy and the house BBQ. All complemented the perfectly cooked meats. The brisket was moist and spiced well. Tender and flavorful, the meat melts in your mouth and the spices are just enough not be be overwhelming and steal any attention form the real star here. The sides on the other hand, were just... OK. underwhelming the rest of the meal.  The baked beans were a bit under cooked and needed some of the sauce to really have a discernible flavor.  The mac and Cheese was bland with faint flavor. The mashed potatoes were pretty good. I kept thinking that a little salt in this place would go a very long way.

Mind you it's been one hour and we had yet to order food....were starving....had yet to see our actual server...AND no one came around to refill drinks/re-order drinks. 8:45 or so we FINALLY got to order food.

I know they add gratuity for parties of 6 or more but ANY resturant I've been to has never had an issue making seperate checks and adding the gratuity still. Our server did not do this either. Fine.

The restaurant interior itself was beautifully decorated and well lit, and we were given a seat by the window which offered us a beautiful view of the creek. As I understand it, the restaurant also has a heated patio. Service was friendly and helpful; our waiter had a great sense of humor and was helpful and descriptive in listing the specials.\\n\\nNow for the food itself. We were first brought crispy pita chips with a zesty spread. For our starter, we ordered thick-cut tortilla chips with a layered dip made from queso, guacamole, and pulled pork. I'm not even usually a fan of queso-based dips, but it was amazingly full-bodied and complemented the rich flavor of the chips themselves. My girlfriend ordered a macaroni and cheese chicken dish, while I opted for a house specialty that you simply can't find at any other restaurant: chicken-fried beef ribs. They were tender, fall-off-the-bone delicious, served with gravy, mashed potatoes, and green beans. In honor of our anniversary, dessert was on the house...we shared a warm slice of blondie pie with walnuts and topped with Amy's vanilla ice cream, an Austin favorite. Despite the heavy nature of the food, the portions were perfectly calibrated to ensure we could enjoy every bite and feel perfectly full and content after a three-course meal.

I am an avid craft beer fanatic and this bar fulfills my needs to try something new and distinct. \\n\\nAs far as food goes, I honestly was not impressed. The food was run of the mill bar food, we had the chorizo nachos and a wild boar banger salad. Both selections were ok but not great by any standard. The chorizo nachos were a special appetizer that seemed to have more beans than chorizo. Then the banger was a satisfying but unremarkable in any other way. It was a sausage. Maybe that's what I should try expect from Bangers, but I felt that it could have been a touch better.\\n\\nEither way, this place is a go to destination for their beer selection.

Now as a general observation, restaurant service in Boston is short and sweet, not as generous and friendly down here as it is in Texas. But even with that in mind, the service here was very disappointing. It started with the hostess when we arrived. I asked if it'd be possible to sit in a booth since the restaurant was only about half full. She looked at me like I was out of my mind and then asked if we had a reservation in an offended tone. I told her no and she said that it was not possible and we'd have to sit in the center of the restaurant at a table. \\n\\nFrom that point on, the staff basically attended to us as little as possible. Our waitress only stopped by occasionally and our food took far too long to arrive. I pondered to why they possibly could have been so inattentive because we surely did nothing to offend anyone. I did see several comments about the bad decor as well. The decor was fine, it just wasn't my taste and didn't bother me. \\n\\nIn the end, I won't be back to visit the Rustic Kitchen.

The food: Always prepared with love and fresh ingredients. The sandwiches are hearty and unique to Cafe Brioso. I am fond of the Tuna on Foccaccia with their special mayo, romaine, and pepperjack cheese, and the Turkey Pesto. Both are filling, and the perfect size for lunch. More often than not, I opt for half a sandwich with a cup of soup. The soups are prepared daily and posted on Facebook and Twitter. You can't go wrong with the Tomato Basil. It has a nice kick to it.\\n\\n2. The coffee: Move over, Starbucks! There's a new Java King/Queen in town. The coffee beans are grinded in the store, and the beans' freshness can be smelled within a one-block radius. If you are a true-blue, no-nonsense coffee drinker, I suggest to bypass adulterating the coffee in any way. Each house blend they prepare has their own personality and should be appreciated as such.  \\n\\n3. The philanthropy: I worked with the owner, Jeff, in 2012 when organizing a silent auction for the Team Buckeye Student Riders. He was more than willing to accompany our efforts. Additionally, I have seen Cafe Brioso support many other Pelotonia efforts in past years. \\n\\nCafe Brioso: Good food, good coffee, good people"},{"name":"Texas Chili Parlor","address":"1409 Lavaca St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Want to give more stars but just not what it use to be.

And our waiter was fantastic.  Truly.  One of the best waiters I've had in a while. I forget his name. He said he was new. Truth be told (and probably the only reason this ins't a 5 star review) I didn't LOVE the atmosphere.  I didn't mind it but I thought a) it was a little too loud and hard to hear your dining companion (the acoustics aren't great in there) and b) not a very cozy or intimate feeling, even though it's a small place.  I did notice one really cool table in the back on the way to the restrooms.  if I sat there, I'd probably up it to 5.  Or, if I sat in the bar area.  \\n\\n\\nAnyway, on to the food.  I had heard this was a \\"tapas\\" place but it's not actually.  It's small plates but they're not all Spanish.  Only maybe a couple are.  They're from all over the world, hence \\"Passport\\".  This is not a bad thing, at all.  I just wanted to put it out there because we had tapas on the brain when we got there and it took us a few minutes to wrap our head around this place.  But, once we did we were oh so happy.\\n\\nWe started with: Steak Tataki. It was very good but not my favorite of all the dishes we had. The steak was nice and sliced really thin, but the ponzu sauce was a little strong.   It was super tasty but it may have overpowered the delicate steak a tiny bit.  Still very good though.\\n\\nThe highlight of the night was the house made tortellini in this lemony cream sauce.  Incredible.  They were soft and delicate and the sauce was fantastic! Both my husband and I said \\"I could eat a whole bowl of this\\" but it's on the \\"teasers\\" menu so it's a small portion.  Big enough to share though if you're getting other dishes.  And, we did. We really did.\\n\\nThe fish tacos were good. I didn't think \\"I have to have these again\\" like I did with the tortelini, but that's probably because I eat a lot of fish tacos and I've never felt that way about them anywhere.  The sauces that accompanied it were quite good (there were 3: bean, avocado and tomato salsa) \\n\\nWe also had the Beef carpaccio.  This is because we were torn between this and the tataki so we decided to have both.  It was delicious.  Great quality meat, nice capers etc with it.  Maybe they could have done without the reddish herb on there - not sure what it was.  It wasn't bad but I don't really think it helped any either. \\n\\nWe also had the mussels that were on special that night.  Delicious, fragrant, garlicky broth and tender mussels, with toast points.  Excellent.  And a good sized portion.\\n\\nOk, 2 sane people would probably be done by now, but No.  We moved on to the heavy hitters.  Like, the Mac & Cheese with corn and bacon.  My husband loved it.  I really liked it but it was a little too rich for me.  Maybe too much bacon in the bacon to noodle ratio.  I know many people would be perfectly fine with that. Don't get me wrong, it was really good.  Just not my favorite (ahem, remember the tortelini). \\n\\nWe also had the cheese plate.  It had 3 cheeses, none of which I remember now.  One was topped with truffle honey.  Amazing! One was topped with a tomato type relish and the other was topped with a savory type relish too, maybe an onion jam.  It was good but I wanted something a little sweet on the plate, like fruit.  You'd think the truffle honey was sweet, but it wasn't.  \\n\\nNot to worry, my sweet fix came a few minutes later with the order of homemade churros we had for dessert. Oh. My. God.  Go there just for the churros.  Warm, crispy, delicious and with 3 incredible dipping sauces.  One was salted caramel.  One was chantilly whipped cream (which we had to look up and it basically means vanilla). And the other was a dark chocolate, with a bit of spice.  All 3 were amazing.  We kept going back and forth on which was the best and kept changing our mind but in the end the slated caramel won out.    \\n\\nThere was also a fantastic French chardonnay and excellent coffee.  It was a ridiculous amount of eating and drinking really, and we enjoyed every minute.  We will definitely go back."},{"name":"Cielo Blue Mexican grill and Cantina","address":"1080 Windy Hill Rd, Ste100","city":"Smyrna","stars":"3.5","text":"I don't ever complain about food, and the food prepared might have been good, this review is about the preperation of the food. I have been to this location and the east/west location and had better service here at windy hill. They are very prompt with delivery of chips and salsa, water, and drinks. The manager always comes by the table. Servers are usually friendly and helpful. I stopped by on 8/20 to place a to go order. My husband wanted a chimichanga. I usually get a burrito, a combo meal, or tortas. I decided to go with a chimichanga as well, but I wanted steak, not ground beef. It was pointed out that they have a fajita chimi, but I abhor green peppers. Which I was very clear in stating. It was explained that the steak would be an upcharge ($3+) and I said I was cool with that....just steak and refried beans.  They were pretty busy, so it was a bit of a wait. I was offered chips and salsa by a manager, but never offered a water or any other drink.  My order arrives, looks like what I ordered, so I leave. It takes me about 25 minutes to get home because the covered bridge is closed, so my normally 15 minute drive home took longer than usual-not the fault of Cielo's. I get home, unpack everything, cut into the chimi....and it's the fajita chimi with tons of green peppers and onions, no beans. I call because I feel it's important for them to understand that they need to follow what's on the ticket-which I did check when I paid my bill. The server rang it in correctly. The manager does offer to cook me another one, but I'm not about to get back in my car and complete a 50 minute round trip drive. So he asks me what I want him to do...I said the tell his cooks to follow the ticket. There are things on most tickets that are based on the customer's preference or needs- in regards to allergies. How hard was it to follow the ticket?

Be ready to wait, though.\\n\\nCame here with Captain Palate for both Sat and Sun brunch this weekend; and overall, honestly this is probably the best breakfast/brunch we've had in ATL yet, all things considered, but in my opinion there is still definitely room for improvement.\\n\\nParking: not a problem, around the time that we arrived both mornings (11:15 one day, 11:30 the next)? There is a lot and usually an open slot or two.\\n\\nWait: variable. Saturday we honestly stood there for at least half an hour, then we're seated (and then so were two other parties, within five minutes). Sunday we learned our lesson and after putting our names down on a list of names maybe six or seven deep, went out for a stroll around the block. The resulting wait was maybe 20 mins.\\n\\nService:variable. Captain Palate and I were starving on Saturday, so the long wait wasn't a great way to get our dining experience started. However, once we were seated our moods improved, as we had read all about these purportedly magical free pastries that are served as a prelude to the meal. So color me p*ssed when the two parties that were seated after us get their orders taken AND pastries delivered to their tables first... It took some serious glowering and blatant staring for our waitress to come over and take our orders, finally, and then a pointed request from CP to get the pastries. Is it bad to demand free things? Yes. (But that is what Yelp has done to me!) And also it's the principal of the matter. Those fools behind us probably had half the wait in line that we did, and were seated after! Harrumph. (We had the same waitress Sunday morning and I felt bad about giving her flak; she was also much more attentive though which obviously helped a lot when deciding how much to tip.)\\n\\nFood: Good, depending on what you get. Don't get the Eggs Benedict. Yes, it comes on English muffins baked in-house, yes you have the choice of canadian bacon or salmon. Yes, you get a small bowl of fresh fruit as your side. But the watery hollandaise might as well not be there at all; you can't taste it. And I had the canadian bacon option Sat, smoked salmon on sunday. The bacon was so salty it overwhelmed the dish; the salmon was super cold (I don't know, maybe I should have expected that?) and really just... I don't know. The whole thing was bland.\\n\\nOn the other hand, CP really enjoyed his 2-egg breakfast, with potatoes and the gingery sausage that you can tell is also homemade. AND the biscuit! The biscuit is huge. He's not a biscuit lover but he really dug it; to me it tastes more like Irish soda bread, which is not how I enjoy biscuits. The homemade strawberry jam that comes along with it is a plus, though.\\n\\nCoffee: Burnt but bottomless.\\n\\nCost: inexpensive! 9 or 9.50, I can't remember exactly, for the eggs benedict; about 8-8.50 for the 2 egg breakfast. And keep in mind you do get those free pastries!\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Ok, come here. But prepared to be patient, and be prepared to not taste much of anything besides your meat of choice if you get the Eggs Benedict."},{"name":"Grindhouse Killer Burgers","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"If you aren't hungry and only need a snack, get a burger here.

Just recently I stopped going because the prices are outrageous for breakfast.  I purchased 2 chalupas (bean and cheese) and the cost was $12.00 and prepared wrong; made another visit still $12:00; made a visit today, 2 breakfast tacos with potato, taco meat and cheese and guess what that total was?  It was $11.00, so I said \\"WOW\\", then remove the potatoes (she removed the cheese instead), then the cost was reduced to $10.00 - a big difference cheese makes, then I asked for the to go cups for the salsa and believe it or not they did not have any, \\"they are expecting a shipment\\", this cups are sold at Sam's Wholesale.

However I find authentic - TRULY authentic - Mexican restaurants hard to come by in the Northeast. Habanero is one of those rare gems of authenticity. Habanero's unique menu selection offers a variety of familiar items - like tacos and burritos - in addition to more uncommon things like Papusas, Gorditas and Tamales. Although these are probably common in Latin American cuisine, I had never heard of them and was eager to try something new. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I ordered two of the Papusas (1 bean and cheese, and 1 pork), the Steak Nachos (because the Yelp reviews raved about them) and 2 Adobada Tacos (because they were less than $2). The entire meal only cost us $16 and we enjoyed all of it immensely. \\n\\nIn summary, here are the two reasons why you should go to Habanero: it's deliciously authentic and very cheap. The Steak Nachos are a must-get, because they are massive, and loaded with toppings. Also noteworthy are the Papusas, because they're very good, not found in any Americanized Mexican restaurant, and cost less than $2."},{"name":"Ruth's Chris Steak House - Buckhead Atlanta","address":"3285 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Buckhead","stars":"3.5","text":"Surprisingly this is the worst Ruths Chris I had so far.

This is not crappy bar food or food shipped straight from sysco.  The soups are yummy.  I really enjoyed the crawfish and corn chowder.  It's nice and chunky with a bit of heat - now, I don't really like heat but it works wonderfully with this soup.  The sandwiches are HUGE.

Perhaps that will change in the future, but for now I recommend calling ahead (their website has their menu) for the speediest service. There are both English and Japanese-speaking staff members, so call without fear. I believe they are trying to set up online ordering, but that is not available at this time.\\nEdit: the picture others have posted indicate that there are pre-made bento available in the hot case. So maybe I showed up after they had run out. Go early to try your luck!\\n\\nIf you just want something quick without calling ahead, there is a hot display case filled with various prepared snacks that made me flash back to Japanese convenience stores and tiny shops. I got croquette (creamy, savory mashed potato on the inside, crispy panko breading on the outside) and daigaku imo. (\\"college potatoes\\" -deep fried sweet potato pieces in a crispy candy sugar syrup coating, sprinkled with sesame seeds). $5.50 for the pair of treats, both were delicious, fresh, and obviously made from scratch in-house. There were also spring rolls, short ribs, and a few other things. The plastic containers do cause the food to steam and become less crispy, so either eat it immediately or try to find out when new food is put out if maximum crunchiness is important to you.\\nI will definitely be trying Ka Ren again."},{"name":"Supernova Vegan","address":"7909 SE 13th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"First time trying supernova, I got the space cowboy and mac and cheese and absolutely loved both.

It is consistently solid all the way around- food quality, service, choice, price, etc.\\n2. It is a local business, not a chain!\\n3. The lunch selection and quality is WAY better than a typical brew place.  I don't do the greasy burger and fries thing well :(  I don't have to sacrifice great food for coming here\\n4. Great service, and great location.  You can easily get to it from Mopac, 183, 360, ...\\n5. Locally brewed beer that tastes great!

There is parking provided (ok Fri and Sat nights it gets a bit crazy over there!).  It actually looks like a brewery inside and out with tasteful architecture.  Everyone is nice and in a friendly mood!\\n\\nI always feel at home there when I hear the familiar \\"watch your step\\" as I am led to the dining area to be seated  ... it's the little things you know...\\n\\nI have tried the Cedar Plank Salmon dish several times before and I highly recommend that one.   For lunch this week they were serving I think it was Hibiscus Iced Tea- tasted great and something different from the plan ol' brown tea.   The Monday special was Tortilla Crusted Tilapia , and while this is not my favorite fish to eat, let me tell you they prepared it superbly and that whole black bean chipotle corn risotto experience matched up with the fish perfectly!   My friend swears by the Tenderloin Steak Sandwich - there is a lot of flat bread that goes with it, but it did look yummy - looked like a Texas-style Philly cheese steak sandwich!\\n\\nDo check out NxNW for lunch if you have not been there yet.   What lunch menu in Austin can you point to that offers wings, calamari, duck, quail, fish, beef, portabello mushrooms, shrimp, scallops, pizza, chicken, pasta, veggies, lamb, and salad as choices AND at reasonable prices AND a homemade brew to wash it down with???

Delicious food, delicious drinks, generous and cheerful waitstaff and a brilliant, humble and BEYOND generous owner."},{"name":"Shiki","address":"9 Babcock St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"This is the tiniest little place tucked under a little corner of harvard st in coolidge corner.  For the past year, I had a steady, 2 visit/week diet to coolidge corner and I've never spotted this little gem.\\n\\nI went early on a saturday evening, and there was some bustle, but there certainly wasn't a line out the door, and it was nicely quiet, enough to never have to raise my voice when conversing with my company for the evening.  We were only two, but somehow plowed through something like 5 dishes.\\n\\nWe ordered as we went, so it was very much a slow, multi-course meal since the food you order at one time doesn't neccessarily come out together.  The first thing that came out was the salad with sesame sauce, Goma Ae.  It was essentially blanched veggies, spinach I think, on top of a raw leaf of radicchio.  The seasame sauce was delicious, but it is one of my weaknesses so I wouldn't trust myself there.  I wouldn't order this again though because it was pretty plain.  I could on the other hand, eat it all day.\\n\\nThe Tuna Tataki came out next, and this was just amazing.  It's barely seared, with a soy based sauce, lemon, watercress, and a spicy radish paste on the side.  I'm not sure what the point of searing it was, since it is cooked ever so slightly.  Unlike Salmon, chicken, beef or pork, Tuna doesn't get much additional flavor after being cooked, so I think it would have been just as good raw.  This was really delicious.\\n\\nMy favorite dish came next.  Yellowtail collar!  I used to get this all the time at New Ginza but it was up and down there.  The version here was beautiful.  I got it without teriyaki sauce.  The outside skin was seasoned pretty heavily with salt, but it was still edible in small bites.  The inside though, was perfectly seasoned, perfectly fatty, but not the same way pulled pork or steaks are fatty, the oils are completely incorporated into the meat which makes it luscious but also gives a lot more flavor than you would get in any other cut of cooked yellowtail.\\n\\nThat wasn't enough, so we ordered stuffed squid and chawanmushi.  The stuffed squid was my least favorite of the night.  It was a little rubbery, and marinated in something that imparted a little bit of bitterness and some other flavor I can't put my finger on.  The sticky rice inside was sweet, and complimented the other flavor well, but the squid was rubbery, and I couldn't taste any of its seafoody sweetness.\\n\\nThe chawanmushi was delicious and interesting.  It's a steamed custard in a little bit of broth.  In this case it tasted like a seafood and seaweed broth.  Imbedded inside the custard are a couple of goodies like mushrooms, chicken, veggies, shrimp a fish cake, and a chunk of eel.  Of course it COULD have done without most of the proteins (my favorite bite was the chicken), but it was fun digging through the custard to find the next tidbit.  The eel was sweet broiled eel, tender, but with the eel sauce that didn't mesh so perfectly with the custard, the chicken was just a hunk of dark meat, but being steamed in a rich custard can mean nothing but incredible tenderness.  The custard itself is very tender, and just like the Chinese version I eat now and then.  It's tasty and rich, but a little gelatinous, almost like silken tofu, and while I'm very down with that, I don't know if the texture is for everyone.\\n\\nThe lighter flavored dishes here, the chawanmushi, yellowtail collar, and tuna tataki are all amazing, the kind of stuff you'd have to pry me away from lest I eat myself to sickness.  For this reason, I'm glad the servings are tapas portions.  I will have to try a fried dish and their tar tar and carpaccio the next time, which can't come too soon."},{"name":"The Lansdowne Pub","address":"9 Lansdowne St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This is a super fun Boston bar on Friday nights.

And Lawwwd, Shiki does it right.  It's a bit hidden as you have to go down some steps to enter.  Inside, it's small but intimate, and we noticed a lot of Japanese people eating there, so that was a good sign.  We came here on a Friday night around 8:30 and got a table for 2 right away.  Our waitress was really nice, friendly, helpful, patient, making service great.  We got a bottle of Sake and put our names on it because they'll save it for you the next time you eat there.\\n\\nFrom reading a bunch of previous reviews, it seemed that everyone raved about the Anikimo (monkfish).  Unfortunately, it was whited-out on the menu.  I asked our waitress and she said it wasn't the right season for monkfish, but also that they wouldn't be offering it on their regular menu anymore (at most, a special in the future maybe).  I lose :(  BUT, our other selections were delicious!\\n\\nWe started with the Tuna-Nagaimo tartar, which was served with a raw quail egg on top, and was presented in a beautiful, colorful stack.  It was tasty, sauce might've been a bit overpowering, but still good.  I thought the nagaimo made it look like like there were strands of mucus hanging off our chopsticks haha.  \\n\\nNext, we had the Sea Eel Millefeuille and OMG this made so deliriously happy!  It's stacked with grilled nagaimo and a poached egg on top.  Let me just say that breaking into runny yolk and watching its yellowy goodness ooze down your food is, by far, one of the most beautiful sights on earth.  Art schmart, runny yolk floods are where it's at.  Anyhow, the eel has a BEAUTIFUL subtly sweet flavor that has a wrap-you-up-in-a-warm-cozy-blanket type of comforting quality.  The nagaimo wasn't really seasoned and didn't do much for me in this dish, but really it's all about the eel and egg here.\\n\\nWe also had the Age Dofu, which was simple and flavorful, and had these yummy tiny little mushrooms.  The Kurobuta shioyaki was less impressive.  It wasn't dry, but it wasn't as tender as I would've expected.  Also, it was a bit too salty for my taste, but I guess the lime wedge it's served with could be used to mitigate that.  We ended our meal with the seaweed Ochazuke, per my friend's suggestion.  It's  basically a bowl with rice, nori shreds, a shiso leaf, and some seasonings into which you pour broth from a teapot.  The shiso leaf is incredibly aromatic and adds complexity to the flavors.  This soup is clean, soothing, and the perfect way to end your meal.  (Ok, it also helps fill you up bc it's the only thing we had w/ carbs)\\n\\nShiki's presentation of food is more sophisticated than other izakayas I've been to.  As noted by my half-japanese dining partner, it really seems to focus on Japanese comfort food, and even though I'm not from Japan, the food can take you home, wherever that may be.  This is by far the best Japanese restaurant I've been to in Boston, and beats out some izakayas on the west coast as well, despite its slightly higher price.  Shiki, YOU WIN."},{"name":"41 West","address":"2279 41st Avenue W Vancouver","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I purchased a Social Shopper voucher for $39.00 for two, and we decided to order additional appetizers off the menu.\\n\\nThe seafood gumbo is highly recommended, which had a rich seafood flavour and a good amount of ingredients. The mussels, scallop and fish were all well-executed and not overcooked. There was also a bit of spiciness in the gumbo which contributed to more flavour. We also ordered their signature shrimp and crab cakes which I found only average and nothing special. The filling was loose and fluffy, and the exterior exhibited a crispy crunch. $15.00 for 3 medium cakes is okay, I guess. Another appetizer we enjoyed are the mussels, which is another recommended dish. The juicy mussels are just cooked and not dry one bit. The cream sauce is also fairly tasty.\\n\\nAs for the entrees, the beef tenderloin was overcooked and tasted dry. I have never had a dry or stringy tenderloin before, but there is a first time for everything. There was also a side of green peppercorn sauce which had a light beefy flavour, it was not bad or too strong. Another entree was the short ribs. One of the pieces tasted fork tender, but the other piece was dry and stringy. Not sure why the inconsistency? There was also a good ginger and star anise au jus, and the flavour was light but rich.\\n\\nFor dessert, we had the caramel cheesecake. The cheesecake is very dry and nothing special, but the caramel was the money. Overall, I recommend the seafood dishes at the restaurant rather than the meat. Asides from the food, the restaurant is cozy and quaint, but the service is lacking. Our server did not ask how the dishes were in-between and only inquired about the entrees after clearing the plates. He also decided to leave the bread knife on the table throughout our three courses which did bug me a bit because I like having a clear and comfortable table setting.

I signed on to Yelp and before I could search for a restaurant Canoe was at the top of the list, with a 4.5 star rating and glowing reviews.\\nI made reservations and was shocked to see on a Monday evening the available times were almost non-existent. I was lucky to get what I did! Good timing...maybe this was a sign?\\n\\nWe were sat right away and our waitress promptly greeted us with \\"Good evening Ms. Pratas, how are you?\\"\\n\\nExcuse you? She knew my name. They took the time to look at my name from my reservation and pass it a long to the waiter. I knew right off the bat that we weren't going to be just paying for the food but paying for the service. It might seem like a small detail, but they're no fools. When you're paying between $30-$40 a dish, it's the little details that matter the most, not just the food. \\n\\nSince it was our first time there, she took the time to go through the menu, highlighting dishes that Canoe is known for. She pointed out the House Smoked Salmon, Crispy Potato Cake, Vermont Goat's Cheese under the appetizers and the Slow Roasted Carolina Rabbit, which has been on the menu since the restaurant opened over 20 years ago. Our waitress set the mood for the rest of the evening...it was simply lovely.\\n\\nNow - to the best part! \\n\\nWe started our meal off with the oysters on the half shell with a cucumber champagne mignonette. There were six in the order, and the cucumber mignonette was already on the oysters instead of on the side. I was hesitant about that...it's always disappointing when a sauce or condiment is slathered all over food that would have been better with out it! But Canoe has these reviews for a reason...they know what they're doing. It was a perfect compliment. Sweet and crisp thanks to the cucumber but not so strong that you couldn't taste the oysters, which were tender and buttery. Yum.\\n\\nFor our entries we got the slow roasted Carolina rabbit with swiss chard on bacon ravioli, sweet potato and a candied garlic sauce ($29) and the venison served with sweet potato and blueberry compote ($32).\\n\\nThe rabbit was tender and moist (which is a feat when it comes to rabbit) and the ravioli was ALL bacon. It was delicious because, I mean c'mon bacon is king. Although by the end of the meal the rabbit was gone and half the ravioli's were left. The bacon was overwhelming.\\n\\nThe venison was cooked a perfect medium rare and the outside had a charred crust to it.  The sweet potato was mashed and under the meat, with a small dollop of the blueberry compote. The sweetness was a nice compliment to the gaminess of the meat, but I'm glad they were conservative with it. I'm not a huge fan of fruit with my dinner, but it was perfect.\\n\\nSure, the prices might be steep but the charming ambiance, the phenomenal service and stand up food makes Canoe a \\"must try\\" in Atlanta. It was worth every penny. I can't wait to get back there to try their brunch and hopefully get a seat outside over looking that beautiful Chattahoochee River."},{"name":"Grecian Gyro","address":"3989 Lawrenceville Hwy","city":"Tucker","stars":"3.5","text":"Don't go here for a first date, or a fancy one, but the food is good!

There was a lot to take in. I liked that the staff appears to be a cool representation of the city. There were no stuffy uniforms, just T shirts and tattoos mostly.\\nWe started with beverages, clams, and a pretzel. Two ordered Pinot Noir wines, I wish I would have tried one also because they said they were good and the description was amazing. I was in the mood for something citrusy so I went with Zarabanda. Excellent choice! I was looking for it when we left.. I was really wanting to buy a six pack. Can we get these in Des Moines, please? :-) \\nThe clams were awesome. I don't think I have ever ate just clams before. YUM. I wasn't expecting much from the pretzel but it was also very good! Especially that cheesy mustard dip!

The noodles and veggies were good and fresh, and the fish sauce served with the dish was tasty, but not the best I've had. \\n\\nThe egg rolls were especially disappointing. The frying oil was not fresh and the rolls were almost doughy. The filling was a mashed paste that wasn't very good. I ordered the chicken dish with white rice for my four year old granddaughter.

The next was ok and then my daughter was oh this oyster has grit in it.  Then my husband said his was gritty.  We ate about four or five of our dozen oysters and realized they were all that way.  I called the server over and told her and she said oh we have a new shucker,  so when she came back I expected a new dozen oyster and she brought us four oysters and proceeded to tell me how they had come in muddy and they don't brine their oysters making all these excuses.

So if you are a newcomer and are used to old school diner with a certain theme obsession, take the Simpson decor comments with a grain of salt. There is not that much.

It's beautiful here at night during the holidays. They have a giant Christmas tree toward the back you must get a picture with.\\n\\nOther great eateries, pizza, pizza bagels, Starbucks... and plenty of souvenir shops. Great for tourists, families, or if you can't decide what to eat. It's worth it. Plenty of sweet stuff as well, like ice cream, Boston creme pies, and candy.

Sadly, I wouldn't contemplate giving them a second chance. Let me explain the one star rating.\\n\\nMy club salad was majorly disappointing. The lettuce was iceberg when the menu clearly states the salad comes with mixed greens. For an eatery that has 'fresh' in its name, the lettuce was anything but fresh. The smallest slices of cucumber and avocado sat on top of this sad lettuce. Also, one of the most important ingredients in a CLUB salad was forgotten - the bacon! I had to flag down the staff to ask for a side of bacon. Unfortunately, it was never delivered to our table, so I ended up eating the salad without it. Thank goodness it at least had cheese on it. I'm not sure what happened because the place wasn't even busy, so I think they plain forgot to bring it to me. My husband wasn't happy with his meal either. He ordered his steak medium and I could tell it was overcooked by simply looking the color of the meat. Why even ask how you would like something cooked if it isn't done right? The only positive about his meal was the side of mashed potatoes, which I had a bite and agreed that they were good.\\n\\nI need to mention the PRICES! (I don't normally yell, but this also deserves caps and an exclamation point) $9 for my sub-par salad and $15 for an overcooked steak - really? I would expect these kind of prices for a casual restaurant, but not here. Another negative included the water situation. The water spout at the drink station was broken, so we couldn't get any water using the tiny cups. I ended up drinking soda water.

I played the yelp roulette and saw something nearby and not far out of the way from where I was and gave it a shot. That, my friends, is how I found Hawkers.\\n\\nIt has a pretty industrial minimalist vibe inside and a sort of modern Asian feel outside. I then saw that at least half of the people working would fit the typical hipster definition (not a bad thing, just a funny observation). My server was a really nice dude with a giant beard who gave me tons of suggestions since it was my first time in. He made a comment that he eats there all the time and even comes in on days he doesn't work. I was hoping it would be awesome. I went with a few different things since it was \\"tapas\\"-like. \\n\\nI took his suggestion and tried the roti and curry (plus an extra piece of roti). The curry sauce was pretty solid; it had a nice heat that would be suitable for the average population. I worked over the roti trying to figure out what it reminded me of. It was super thin, chewy, slightly flaky, it could be separated, but most of all, it had this oily feel and taste to it that (after some thinking) remind me of Pillsbury (or some other brand) crescents/croissants. Part of me wonders if they just roll that stuff out super thin and pan cook it. Disclaimer: I've totally deep-fried Pillsbury biscuits to make fake doughnuts because it's way faster/easier than trying from scratch. With that being said, I think it was a well-intended suggestion, but it's not really something I would do again.\\n\\nNext up I had a meatball skewer with some curry sauce on it. Honestly, I think it was the best thing I ordered out of the entire lot. The order came with 2 skewers of 3 small meatballs each. It too had a nice bite and the meatball was moist. \\n\\nI gave the duck banh mi sliders a shot too. I don't think it's really considered a slider if you took a loaf the size of a publix hoagie and cut it into 3 parts though. I feel like the concept was a bit of a fail. Why not just call it a duck banh mi (minus the slider part)? The bread was incredibly soft with no texture (far from a baguette), so it didn't even hit the mark for being classified as a banh mi. The veggies in it were fresh and crunchy, and unfortunately, the only source of texture. They went light on both the veg and the duck, but frankly, the duck that was on it still wasn't good. Very fatty pieces, chewy skin, and overall just not prepared well or in a manner suitable for a sandwich and chopsticks. There was a bit of sauce on it, but not enough to add flavor. Really, this needs to be taken off the menu. It's neither slider, nor banh mi. It still cost almost twice what my regular place charges, and only half the fillings in comparison.\\n\\nI tried the Pad Thai too since my favorite place in the Tampa area closed last year and I've been jonesing for a replacement. It's not bad, but it's not great. Super thankful it wasn't one of the sweet kinds, but it was lacking the complexity of flavors I'm used to finding in that dish. It did have some heat to it which I definitely appreciate though. Also, I can't put my finger on the chicken, but something was weird about the texture. This dish was middle of the road for me.  \\n\\nLastly, since I checked in, I took advantage of the free summer rolls offer. They would definitely benefit from lettuce that isn't iceberg. Most of the components were there, but it wasn't quite up to par. I'm not basing any part of my rating on these guys because I didn't pay for them.\\n\\nAll in all, the service was awesome and incredibly friendly. The seating wasn't too comfortable (definitely not somewhere I could have an extended meal experience), but it fit with the decor. I want to attribute my feelings on the food to it being catered towards trendy young people. I wouldn't find a little old Thai/Vietnamese/Korean grandma back there cooking, and overall the dishes were made more for the average American. It wasn't bad and it wasn't amazing, so I can only really give it an average rating. I'll stick with the more traditional places where I can't read the menu and point at things lest I embarrass myself with mispronunciations."},{"name":"Urban Cowboy Southern Fusion","address":"","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Chris and his team handled all the food and bar services at our wedding, as well as the set up and break down of the site.

I went to the Ogenki website, ordered online using the convenient button provided on their page for online orders and placed my order. I received a confirmation email about a minute later which instructed me to wait 15-30 minutes for them to call me back to confirm but if I didn't receive a call then I should call them. I waited for about 25 minutes, got no call so I called them.

The tartar sauce for their chicken nanban is very clearly homemade, as it has that distinct sweetness to it that makes it different from American tartar sauce (which tends to be a bit more sour). For being deep fried and carryout, the nanban was still very good even though it obviously was not as crispy after being refrigerated for a few days. The hamburg bento was also amazing.

I stopped in after my flight was delayed at gate D33, and it was close enough for me to keep an eye on the gate. The man who helped me was extremely friendly. It almost seemed as if he might be the owner, and as if I weren't sitting at an airport restaurant. The restaurant is a make-your-own-burger style. They had 3 options for patties - beef, turkey, and veggie - several cheese options, condiments, and quite a few free and premium toppings. \\n\\nI ordered a \\"junior\\" (1/4 lb) veggie burger, without cheese, and added lettuce, onion, a fried green tomato and avocado. The fried green tomato and avocado were extra. The burger was delicious! It would have only been about $5, but the premium toppings ran me about $1+ each. FYI, it was a teeny slice of avocado, definitely not worth the extra money. But I spread it out over the patty and I suppose it added some flavor, despite how little it was. The fried green tomato tasted fresh out of the fryer, and the veggie patty was perfect. It seemed to be made mostly of beans.  You never know how those are going to turn out, so I was more than pleased. \\n\\nI ordered a Sweetwater 420...it came in a huge glass. It may have been just 16oz but it honestly seemed bigger. Maybe I was just fatigued from travel-drinking for days on end. It was $9.50 which is definitely on the pricey side. I suppose that's how they make up for the $5 burgers. \\n\\nI am glad I found this spot and gave it a chance, even though I wasn't craving a burger."},{"name":"Bar Louie Polaris","address":"1611 Polaris Pkwy","city":"Columbus","stars":"2.5","text":"We frequent bar Louie a lot, usually the downtown and Easton locations, but went to this Polaris location yesterday for Valentine's dinner. I was pretty disappointed with the food, but HORRIBLY disappointed in the service. Not once were we asked how the food was. Which is upsetting because the salsa in the salsa trio tasted like it has gone bad and my entree was cold, and I didn't have the option to ask for it to be reheated Bc we weren't checked on or asked if everything was ok or if we needed anything, which is weird since I didn't eat mine at all. I would think servers should notice when a meal hasn't been touched. I try not to be too critical of bad service Bc I have been a server and understand people have bad days and sometimes are extremely busy. but our server wasn't busy and also came across as downright rude. \\"Do you want anything else\\" was literally a statement. It was uncomfortable and I felt like a burden. She would just set our plates/drinks down and walk away without looking at us at all. THe restaurant wasn't super busy and several times I saw her sitting down at a table around the bar lounge area texting. So there's no excuse for the poor service and rude behavior. I should have at least had the opportunity for my entree to be fixed."},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Serene, simple, yet somewhat sophisticated entrance complete with water feature, though no fishes, wait..... is this Asian street fare? Door opens...oh, simple, unfussy, clean, open dining room, high top tables, pub height chairs, metallic zinc panels, black industrial style ceiling, and the grand open tower. This place is really cool.\\n\\nI remembered China Town Restaurant and Market as a dingy and moldy hole. The service was horrible, the food tasteless, even the beer was stale. I went once, 6 years ago, and never even finished my meal. So, it comes as no surprise that this place closed. Now look at the new joint. Wow! What a transformation. New life was given to this old place that really was neglected and time passed it by. Renovate, regenerate, regrow, a greener Orlando. Love it.\\n\\nThe entrance is flanked on the left with a bar and greeter podium, with no greeter. However, a friendly greeting came from the bar area and a person dressed in all black came over and asked, \\"Two?\\" Yes, there was two of us. We were lead to a table along the wall. Nice fit. Surprisingly comfortable. There is even a foot step under the table, snazzy. We were handed two menus and a drink list. One of the menus had dried food on the front cover. Wow alot of beers and food items.\\n\\nThere were over 50 beers all of which I am told were in stock. Although, there are the regular Asian beers that could be found in any Asian restaurant in Orlando there are also a trillion small batch brewed that are not so popular. Great, so there is an option to pair this huge variety of food with specific tasting beer. Will keep that in mind. The wine list was a decent compilation with most of the varieties present but seem to lack focus and was not well rounded. I was told by the server that it is a new list since the previous one were selections from Total Wine on Colonial Dr. At least they recognize the need. Step up?\\n\\nThe food menu was a combination of most Asian dishes. Several dishes reflect the most popular of that particular ethnicity. However, some one really loves five spice. There is a whole section of the menu that is dedicated to five spice inspired dishes. Nice combination of soups, salads, stir fry, and grilled items. However, it is a large menu so study before you go.\\n\\nTechnology has definitely touched this restaurant with the sleek and shinny iPad terminals. They operate on a Point of Sale system that is all wireless called Lavu. Since everything is wireless they have the option to add on iPod and iPhone apps. Cool and techy.\\n\\nAfter going through the menu and taking some recommendations from the server we settled on 6 dishes.\\n\\nRoti Canai\\n\\nMalaysian flat breads served with a side of spicy curry dipping sauce.\\nRoti-A little on the chewy undercooked side.\\nCurry-On point, creamy, spicy, flavorful. The little nugget of chicken on the bottom was oh so soft.\\n\\nGrilled Hawker Skewers\\n\\nPork-Vietnamese lemongrass\\nChicken-Malaysian satay\\nBeef-Korean Bulgogi\\nAll beautifully marinaded and grilled to perfection.\\n\\nChar Kway Teo\\n\\nMalaysia's most popular street fare, Wide rice noodles stir fried with shrimp, chicken breast, egg, bean sprouts, and shallots.\\nGood stir fry dish, noodles plumb not al dente, not soft, but oily, creating a very smooth luxurious texture. Vegetables and proteins cooked well. Good dish, oil puddle forms if left to sit too long. Description on menu does not include bean sprouts, but here they crunchy and earthy, love it.\\n\\nCurry Laksa\\n\\nA Singaporean favorite, egg noodles in a coconut curry stew, topped with a hard boiled egg, shrimp, sliced chicken breast, and garnished with \\"yow choy\\" (chinese kale) and fried shallots.\\nCreamy, lightly flavored, just the right amount of spiciness, proteins cooked tenderly, great bowl of delight.\\n\\nFive Spice Tofu\\nCrisp, five spice flavor present, silky tofu, cooked perfectly.\\n\\nFive Spice Fish Tacos\\nCrisp, five spice flavor present, well cooked fish, fresh tomatoes and lettuce. Soft taco shell.\\n\\nI asked for a beer recommendation that would go well with our selections and was offered the same old common Asian types with casualness of someone who could care less what the other gazillion beers on the menu tasted like. Poor showing, since they have such a large variety. I selected a Tiger beer which complemented and tasted quite crisp. After the beer, I asked for a wine recommendation and the server took my menu and read off starting from the top. I tried the French Grenache blend. Good wine, paired okay with the grilled hawker skewers but not versatile enough as the only blend on the menu.\\n\\nI have to point out the cohesiveness in design. There is a common reddish/orangeish stripe colored theme that transcends on the menu, logo, and around the restaurant. Very nice touch. Now everytime I see this color or stripe I will think of Hawkers. Points for branding.\\n\\nOverall, this is a nice concept with fresh ideas and same old flavors. It is a good attempt to update the proverbial Asian take out  restaurant."},{"name":"Cafe Java- Austin","address":"11900 Metric Blvd, Ste K","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is AWESOME!

The service was ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE and spotty at best. We had reservations for a group of 10 friends for a birthday dinner. While we were waiting for folks to come, our server never once asked if I we wanted to start with appetizers or if we would like some bread. \\n\\nAfter placing our orders, my fiance's beer never came. We had to ask our server repeatedly and each time he gave us a flaky response, which left us more and more unsatisfied. We already knew because we were a group of 10 that gratuity would automatically be included in our bill. However, that does not excuse poor service and callous treatment.\\n\\nBefore our orders came we had to ask for bread and by then our appetizer plates were already cleared away. We felt even more uncomfortable. And when our orders arrived, our friend's order never made it to the table. And the server didn't even bother to notice that there was a dish missing. How is it possible that they could say that the order was never taken? HE HAD TAKEN THE ORDER AND EVEN ASKED HER HOW SHE WANTED HER RIB EYE. Lame ball excuse. TALK ABOUT LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY. \\n\\nBy the time the confusion was nearly cleared away, the rest of us were almost done with our meals and what use would it be to have them prepare your meal now. So our friend decided to not order the rib eye. \\n\\nWhile this all occurred, the server would casually ignore us or walk by nonchalantly like we weren't even there. Never once did he ask how our meal was or if we needed anything. OF COURSE SINCE YOUR GRATUITY IS AUTOMATIC. \\n\\nThe birthday girl asked to see the manager so many times before they presented us with some random person who clearly also was a server. She made excuses as to why possibly we could have gotten such poor service. Her tone and choice of words were insincere and hardly believable even by the most naive person. \\n\\nShe recorded a list of our complaints and said she would try to see how she could accommodate our bill. She even offered free desserts for us all but really why on earth would we want to stay there even longer? The birthday girl said she wanted her cake back from the kitchen (we brought along a cake).  \\n\\nNow this is what I absolutely DO NOT APPRECIATE aside from the already poor service. In the midst our frustration, the random person and the server would stand idly nearby and discuss the situation. EMPLOY SOME PROFESSIONALISM and conduct your business accordingly. I felt as though we were being analyzed and evaluated. She finally came back and offered to take off the birthday girl's order and gave her a $25 gift card. OF COURSE THE GRATUITY WAS STILL INCLUDED. \\n\\nWE WERE NEVER GIVEN ANY IMPRESSION OF ANY KIND OF SERVICE AND YET WE WERE BEING FORCED TO COMPENSATE FOR LACKLUSTER SERVICE?!\\n\\nOur server's name was Emmanuel and the random \\"manager\\" was Christine.

So i ask the manager on duty who out server was because at this point it has been ten minutes before being greeted only for him to reply \\"oh thats normal\\" and then our waitress appeared behind him finally realizing maybe she should talk to her table.

When she did not receive them she ate the regular fries, which I was not happy about. It was longer than 30 seconds before the server brought out the sweet potato fries and my daughter was halfway finished with the original fries, which again was not my first choice for her. Also, the small plate of fries brought out was not equivalent to the side of sweet potato fries my son received with his order. This is why I thought we should not have been charged the $1.50.

If the server had taken a moment to clarify who the food was for, the order would not have been canceled. Also, our server switched midway through our experience, which added to the confusion. Our original server knew I was unable to order my original choice because the kitchen was unable to prepare pizza without using cornmeal and I ordered an appetizer instead.

There was originally a church here and a man bought it with the idea of turning it into a brewery. Oh boy, did that ever make Vancouverites mad! After a long legal battle he agreed not to put a brewery into the church and tore down the original building. So, a few months later he built a new building that looked just like a church and put his brewery in there anyway. \\n\\nSadly for him, the brewery failed, an American style food place failed, and he gave up his dreams and sold the place. The building sat vacant for a few months and then came along Cathedral Tapatia Mexican Restaurant.

This place is perfect for families and large groups. \\n\\nThere are a few vegetarian things on the menu, but my favorite thing to get is their deluxe bean tostada with black beans. Yummy. Our waiter the last time I went was friendly and did not mind my moms trying to speak in broken Spanish while ordering.

I've always wanted to order, but was reticent due to their higher than the norm prices. I'll pay for something that has a great reputation, but no one I know has eaten their pizza. Today, I learned that my company was buying me lunch. They just brought a flyer by the other day so I tricked my coworkers into ordering from here. They're all pretty unhappy with me right now. \\n\\nWe ordered their house specialty pizza which comes with canadian bacon, pepperoni, green peppers, black olives, shrimp (WHAAAAT?!), and the usual sauce and cheese. We also ordered a pound of the hot and spicy wings. \\n\\nWhen the delivery guy arrived and handed me the box, I was instantly concerned. The bottom of the box felt like it had been sitting in water and was ready to give out. The pizza looked good on top, but then I picked up a slice. They cover most of their toppings with the cheese. It's the first time I've seen that and I'm not a fan. Have you ever seen \\"The Ten Commandments\\" scene where the Red Sea splits into two? That's what happened when I tried to pick up a slice. The soggy, doughy bottom fell all over my hands while the cheese and pepperoni remained on their own stiff level. One level aiming for your mouth, the other one aiming for your neck.... No thank you. The hot and spicy wings? The meat tasted like it had suffered from freezer burn, the \\"spicy\\" aspect? There's more of a kick in mayonnaise. \\n\\nAll I can say is that I'm glad that I didn't pay for it."},{"name":"First Watch","address":"1600 Hancock Rd, Ste 105","city":"Clermont","stars":"4","text":"Really good.

Deli Boys was close by. The outside is inviting, and it is easy to find.  There were a few people in there eating, so I figured to give it a try. \\nFirst impression walking in was not good. It looks a bit tired, and seems that not a lot of thought was given to appearance, cleanliness, or function.  The ceramic tile on the floor was probably really nice when it was brand new, but this day it looked like people were dragging in dirty slush from the winter time, like it hadn't been cleaned since last winter.  Not their fault, probably, but it needs to be replaced. The tables and chairs had some miles on them too.  The soda machine is way off to the side, almost like they don't want you to use it. I did notice most people in there were buying drinks in containers. \\nThe menu is pretty simple. They had a couple specials, and then the main menu. Funny thing was, when I heard the name \\"deli,\\" I assumed I could go here and get maybe an Italian-type or salami or something else. The cold sandwich selections were very limited; most of the menu is hot sandwiches. That is fine, too, but the hot selections were not really what I envisioned. \\nI ended up getting a Reuben sandwich.  I thought about ordering chips with it, but the chip rack was located behind the counter, too far for my 20/20 vision to see what types they had, so I skipped it. \\nThe sandwich came out quick, delivered to the table. It looked okay, but upon further review it was mediocre. The meat was like processed slices out of a package, and there was not enough sauerkraut on it. It taste okay, but I couldn't get past the texture of the meat.  \\nWhile I was eating there were flies around, which I kinda understand being Summer, but it made me question yet again the cleanliness of the restaurant. I never did do the true test and check the restroom. \\nI'm not sure I'll return to Deli Boys.

My favorite part was the chutney, especially the mango.  My Indian companion said it was really good, not greasy like some Indian food?  The service was good, we split the check 3 ways evenly for no extra charge and stayed several hours without anyone hurrying us.  Also, several Indian families were eating while we were there, for what that's worth.

Where this establishment is lacking is service, let me explain.\\n\\nEating here on 4 different occasions and on 2 of those my order was incorrect.  Of those 2 occasions, only 1 did I feel like they made the slightest effort to make it right.\\n\\nThe first time it was a party of 2 and our meals came out at totally different times.  Mine was first and my little girls was nowhere to be seen.  I held off on eating mine thinking hers would be right after but no, it was a good 10 minutes more.  By the time hers came out, mine was getting cold.  I ate it anyway and the waitress did ask how the meal was at one point, I told her and she did apologize for the meals being brought out so far apart and offered a desert which I declined as we had desert plans already and informed her of this.  Nothing else was discussed.\\n\\nThe second time was pretty recent and it was a party of 4 this time.  I ordered my meal onion and dairy free (yeah that sucks but if I eat dairy I'm hating life) yet my burger did not come to me that way.\\n\\nAll food came out at the same time however I noticed big fat onions on my burger and a dairy spread - off to be remade it goes while my party is eating.\\n\\nIt is brought back out to me by one of the cooks who apologized (and had to take it back again as the bun had dairy in it) but well after my party has finished eating - after a good chunk of time rolls by.  I awkwardly eat it while they wait.\\n\\nWe get the check and no real effort to make the experience right.  Typically most places will offer something for the kids or offer to comp the individual meal item in partial or full - or at least make a greater effort to make the customer have a better experience.
