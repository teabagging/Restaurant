I ordered a hazelnut Thai milk tea with boba and waited for my order. A hazelnut Thai milk tea was called about five minutes after I paid and no one else appeared to be waiting so I grabbed it thinking it was mine. I took a drink and first noticed that it tasted like hazelnut coffeemate and not tea at all but figured I'd deal with it. Then I noticed there was no boba. My friend was finishing up placing his order and I politely told the cashier I had ordered my drink with boba. She told me boba cost extra and I said I had paid for it. The drink was $4.50 and the boba was an additional $0.50 and I had handed her $5 cash. She told me she must have handed me $.50 back and I said no, she did not. She then took my drink and asked someone to put boba into it. This happened right away and I was handed back my complete drink. The cashier went back to helping customers so I sat down with my friends at a table near the counter. As I was sitting there I noticed some other guests having issues with what they ordered, such as items not being heated up as requested. About ten minutes after I sat down I heard another hazelnut Thai tea with boba be called and heard a child go up to the counter to grab it and say she didn't want boba. Now I see I grabbed the wrong one on accident. I was about to turn around and apologize for the mistake and before I could the cashier told the girl \\"A lady stole your drink so I guess we will make the right one for you.\\" Okay, I didn't steal it, I accidentally took the wrong one. There's no order numbers or names associated with orders so it's an easy mistake to make. During the rest of my time there, I heard the cashier talk to her coworkers about me on three different occasions. Saying I \\"walked out before resolving the issue\\", \\"can you believe that lady that was here that didn't get the right drink?\\", among other things that weren't nice or professional. I was pretty angry sitting there and the rest of the restaurant could hear this employee and were exchanging glances at this point. On top of that, all the other tables had small children that could hear the hostility coming from this employee's mouth. After all of this, I tried to forget about it and enjoy my time. Not long after hearing hostile words about me being spewed around the kitchen, another employee called out two smoothies that no one claimed (we think they duplicated my friend's order) and after a few minutes of no one claiming it he grabbed the drinks and harshly exclaimed \\"well I guess no one wants these then!\\" and threw the drinks with anger and force into the trashcan. \\n\\nI will not be returning to an establishment with such hostile employees that demonstrated numerous counts of disorganization, unprofessionalism and horrendous customer service. On top of everything I previously listed, my friends waited 25 minutes for their smoothie and toast.

Not to mention I have my own homemade back yard full pig smoker.\\nI've been to Fox Bros. five times now and every time no matter what I order the food is perfect. I've had all the app.'s, everyone, and they are all awesome!  I recommend the Frito Pie.  I don't even like fritos but try it, hint, ask for jalapinos.  But those tater tots in any version are the da bomb!  Oh, and try the smoked chicken wings, OMG. I never order chicken either but they way they cook these and add the sauce, I about fell out of my chair.  Amazing wings. I'd go back just for the wings.\\nAnd like fritos I'm not a brisket fan but Fox Bros. has the best I've ever tried. Now onto the ribs and pulled pork - again awesome, perfect smoke, not too much but enough to note it's there.  The ribs show a slight smoke ring, which is a great sign.  The pulled pork is soft, but not too soft with a few blackened pieces here and there to make it crunch every other bite, Perfect.\\nThe sides, all good.  I've tried them all as well.  \\nWhy Four Stars: There sauce is really really good but not the best I've ever had, but really tasty in a not so sweet sort of way.  Wish they had a spicy version instead of handing me hot sauce. Officially \\"it ain't BBQ until there is sauce on it\\". And that sauce better be a great compliment to the pork. :)\\nAnother reason why they don't get five stars is their wait staff needs an attitude adjustment.  Every time I go, five times now, they act like I'm bothering them. Stupid me for eating there.   A smile and a thank you would be great to see.  I get they are busy, because they are swamped every time I go but that's not my problem.\\nLastly, four starts because they also have horrible parking.

BBQ to a Georgian is like pasta to an Italian,   it was as present as milk during my childhood years.  \\n\\nI will go out on a limb and say Fox-Brothers BBQ is bar none the best BBQ I have had thus far (yeah its Texas style,  but I'm not picky).   I will admit that I have not been to the other legendary BBQ place in Atlanta (Fat Matts) so my opinion could change once I get there.   \\n\\nMain:  \\n\\nI am a creature of habit so I have not explored their menu too much as pulled pork plates are my absolute go to at any BBQ place I visit.   Fox Brothers did not disappoint my first go around so I have ordered that each and every time since,   I just rotate my sides.   \\n\\nSides:  \\n\\nFried Okra -  Fox Brothers does not sell okra out of season.   These are not the chopped,  frozen in the bag variety of fried okra.   Fox Brothers takes fresh okra and breads and fries themselves.   It is incredible!    Only downside is it is unavailable out of season,  however I appreciate them not dumbing down their product by offering a mass produced product during the off season.   \\n\\nBrunswick Stew -  One of the best Brunswick Stews I have had just behind my stepmothers homemade Brunswick Stew.   My only very negative comment would be that it can be just a touch too sweet at Fox Brothers,  which brings me to my next favorite side.  \\n\\nFox-a-Roni -  The legendary Brunswick Stew mixed with their excellent Mac N Cheese.   This is one of the best combinations of two different sides.\\n\\nCons: \\n\\nOk there is always a downside to every restaurant and Fox Brothers definitely has a few minor cons.   \\n\\nWait - The wait can get horrific because of the popularity,    I don't even try to go on weekends as the place is bananas.  Even weekday lunches can result in 30-45+ minute waits.   \\n\\nSauce - Fox has their in house made BBQ sauce,  but just that one sauce.  I selfishly wish they would expand the offerings and maybe offer a more vinegar/mustard based southern sauce.   We are in Georgia after all.  \\n\\nOverall: \\n\\nFox Brothers comes highly recommended in my book.

However, the taste, texture and overall salty/sour of the lemon-Parmesan was far more than I expected from a \\"simple dish.\\" We then had the Poutine which was completely new to me as an American. Poutine consists of  fries, gravy and cheese curds. This particular order came with brisket which I asked be removed although I'm sure it would have been just as delicious but seeing as I don't eat meat, it wasn't an option. Absolutely divine. Moving on to the last course, we had the fresh spaghetti with the poached egg on top. I have no words. I was not a huge pasta -eater before this experience but this dish turned my world upside down. \\n\\nJust for any reader's reference, despite being vegetarian, I am NOT a picky eater and I like to believe I have a fairly experienced and diverse palate. I come from a family of professional chefs and good cooks and know my way around the kitchen myself but really, this was just eons above anything I have ever tried. Prior to this experience my super-logic boyfriend used to say \\"I only eat food for sustenance\\" and now he is a believer that TASTE is an experience. Even a few days after the meal I am convinced I will not be enjoying food as much as I did at Oakwood."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Mmmm fried chicken.

It was just a few more minutes until my pizza was ready, but the staff seemed to spend a lot of their time fooling around.

Stopped by to finally try their brunch and realized they have only one veg option (pretty odd for inner SE Portland).  But no worries--he ordered the veggie omelet (the 1 option) and I ordered the eggs Benedict and asked to hold the ham and perhaps add a slice of tomato instead.  Was told there might be an extra charge for that (wha???). Never heard if there would be, but got the bill --ordered a bloody, an oj and a coffee and our 2 meals and spent over $50...thank god they also added the extra $1 for 2 slices of tomato! Talked to the manager/owner and found out the chef dictates that because apparently keeping the more expensive portion of pork off and re-selling it to another customer is a major hassle.  $1 is really not much at all, but the principle of it is highly disappointing for regular customers to be nickeled and dimed when the breakfast for 2 is already quite profitable for them.  \\n\\nWould love to see if the chef could be convinced to be a tiny bit more flexible--otherwise, we'll stick to the other local haunts that are happy to work with customers on simple requests."},{"name":"Safeway","address":"6194 SW Murray Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"2","text":"Where is management????!\\n\\nYoung cashier rushed handicapped customer thru, didn't offer to put her groceries on the cart or offering her assistance to her car.

No bang for your buck, unless you're getting their mussels - so my boyfriend lucked out.\\n\\nI want to point out he did love his bowl of mussels. But I unfortunately had to ask the waiter to return my burger because it was *so salty*, it was difficult to stomach - the mix of bacon, Brie and a salt-crusted, crunchy burger got me (primarily because the meat was so over-salted and way beyond medium, it also ended being really dry). The second burger was more juicy, but still too salty for my taste - maybe that's the way it is naturally?\\n\\n\\nSo I commend the staff for being really nice to me regarding my salty burger and I think if you love straight up mussels like my boyfriend, it seems they are worth it.

Was very easy to make reservations, not too busy for a Thursday evening. The ambience has pretty good dim mood lighting, and I appreciated the large booths - alternatively you could sit at a high top. The hostess and our server were both very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.\\n\\nThe Groupon for two includes: 1 app, 1 salad, 2 entrees, 1 dessert. So our dinner consisted of: buttermilk fried chicken, house salad, steak frites, crispy flounder fillet (an extra side of brussel sprouts), and butterscotch pudding with an added scoop of peanut butter ice cream.\\n\\nThe fried chicken was pretty good, the meat was fall off the bone with very crispy breading/skin. The ranch sauce it came with was also pretty good, and the celery slaw had the perfect tang as a compliment. The salad was a mix of greens with a mound of fried sseaweed on top. At first I was like nah, that's way too much seaweed. But the chef knows what she's doing when she designed this salad. The flavors and the texture contrasts were on point. I'd pay to have that salad again. The steak frites were ordered with the horseradish sauce on the side (will talk about that later), which would normally smother the steak on top of the shoestring fries. This can lead to soggy fries, so if you're not into that be warned. My dining partner didn't mind though and said that the steak was perfectly cooked. My crispy flounder was SO good. The fillet sat on top of two slice of fried green tomatoes, which when dipped in the horseradish sauce from earlier, was stellar. The sauce had tons of shrimp and tomato in it, an overall killer dish. The roasted brussel sprouts were also delicious - and this coming from someone who usually hates brussel sprouts. The ending butterscotch pudding was velvety and smooth and the perfect ending to the meal.\\n\\nSo would I be back? Likely only for drinks as the bar area seemed happening. The food is a little too pricey for me to do on the reg, something that other reviewers have mentioned. Case in point, the side of Brussels sprouts were about the size of a small rice bowl (maybe 1 cup) and cost $7 - yikes! They were amazing....but still. We also had 2 Sapporos at $6 each.\\n\\nIn the end I did enjoy this meal, simply because I felt like I got   a good value from it. I was able to get a 25% discount code on Groupon, so I didn't pay the full $55. Next, Groupon+ gives a cashback of 50% up to $10, AND THEN, I AIN'T DONE YET, Yelp gives a cashback of 10%. These cashbacks (linked to a credit card, so make sure it's the same one), which indeed stack on top of the groupon credit, were applied to the balance due with drinks, the side, and tax. Win, win, win!\\n\\nAlso this shouldn't have to be stated, but do tip on the full amount. Don't be cheap. The receipt actually lists all the food you get as the Groupon sale price at $55. I added up all the items as they were priced on the menu and tipped off of that. Again, dont skimp out on the quality of the food and service that you get."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Don't!!\\n- leave Austin without trying this\\n- Fall into recommendations of similar places\\n- Forget dessert, the mini pies are awesome!

I had the veggie omelet, which was really good, you could tell the veggies were super fresh, with a side of the potatoes (which were so-so but when you add the cheese sauce they become good, and when you add the Frank's red hot sauce they become amazing.) I did think it was weird that you had to order the hash seperate, it's the first time I have ever seen anything like that before.

We were recommended several items on the menu including the popular fried chicken by our waitress (Hannah?).  Ordered the chicken, collard greens and Mac N Cheese which were all delicious. Probably some of the best fried chicken I've had. \\n\\nSo why 3 stars? I had to dock 2 stars for service.  It was really a strange experience honestly.  For some reason, the waitress did not seem to like us. The bar I believe holds 6 people and we were right in the middle with couples to our left and right.  For whatever reason, the waitress checked in with the other couples throughout the meal but never checked in with us once and barely glanced in our direction. When I go to restaurants I don't typically pay attention if the wait staff checks in as it's not that big of a deal to me.  However in this instance, when it appears they are intentionally ignoring you, it really sticks out.  She never gave off a friendly vibe (don't recall her ever smiling once).  I didn't mention it to my GF, since I thought it was probably just me over analyzing things.  However, my experience was confirmed when my GF asked me after we left, if the waitress hated us? Coming from the customer service industry, I know how much of a pain in the ass customers can be.  I tried to play the dinner back and find an instance when we were rude/disrespectful to her and couldn't think of anything, In any case, if either of us were, I would definitely apologize as customers treating service workers like shit are some of the worst type of people imo. \\n\\nThis experience left a bad taste and I don't think I'll be back.

We've come here nearly a dozen times together, making us quite the regulars, and their quality is always consistent and fresh no matter the day. \\n\\nI'm going to let you in on a little secret: the best thing to get here, in my humble opinion, is anything with toro. \\n\\nYou can start with toro as an appetizer with their torched spicy toro sushi (4pcs) ($14.25), for example. The fatty tuna just melts in your mouth. For some of my favorite house special maki with toro, they have the double plus maki ($16.75), double toro maki ($22.25), and super 54 maki ($22.25). They sometimes have daily specials on the aforementioned rolls and the special price on those days is often $16/roll. I live for those days.\\n\\nSome of my other favorite rolls to get include the Idaho maki, Louisiana maki, spicy salmon maki, M&T maki, and Watertown maki. I also recommend the beni toro banana as an appetizer. You might think at first that combining fatty tuna and banana is sacrilegious, but it's really not half bad and would suggest trying it (if you don't hate salmon or banana). \\n\\nOverall, I can't recommend Super Fusion and its food enough. It's a relatively small restaurant, but we've never had trouble getting seating for two at peak dining times and days. My boyfriend and I will usually go for an appetizer, two house special maki, and two regular rolls on a normal night out. We've spent some more special occasions here when we'll spring for more house special maki.

Having scoped out reviews beforehand, I felt like I had a good idea of things to try that should be great.\\n\\nMy husband and I came on a Saturday morning as soon as the store opened for breakfast. Already there were a bunch of cars, a short line, and it quickly became full in the seating area. Get here early for breakfast or brunch!\\n\\nService was efficient in that someone asked if they could start our drinks (orange blossom iced tea and coffee), another asked if we wanted anything from the sweets case and would we like it here or to go (we got an old-fashioned bar cookie and a dulce de leche pretzel pie). These items were then ready and waiting when we got to the front to order. I will say that the orange blossom iced tea was fantastic and I wish I had known there were free refills; I ended up drinking mine before my breakfast was finished and no one offered me refills even though they came over to check on how everything was. I definitely could have used more tea, but I thought there weren't refills :(\\n\\nEven though I had scoped out the weekend specials, I ended up going off of the main menu for food. My husband got the biscuits and thyme sausage gravy and I got the 7th Trimester, a biscuit with bacon and egg and macaroni and cheese.\\n\\nSo, here's where I'm divided. My pie was amazing. The filling was thick and delicious; the pretzel and chocolate cookie crumb crust was the perfect foil to the caramel; there was whipped cream and miniature peanut butter cups on top--all fantastic. I would definitely order it again, even as rich as it was. My husband thought we should split this $6 mini pie again next time, but I don't know that I'd want to share.\\n\\nHis old-fashioned cookie bar was okay. It was kind of like a blondie, kind of like a chocolate chip cookie bar, kind of like an oatmeal bar. I'm not sure what exactly was in it. When I tried it, it didn't taste really distinctively of anything (unlike the straight-up flavors of my pie) so I found it to be just okay. It's pretty big for the $3 we paid but I don't know that I would personally order this item again. \\n\\nI was disappointed in the breakfast items, though, as compared to desserts. The presentation was great--these platters of food were substantial! But my macaroni and cheese was really dry; hardly any cheese flavor was present and there was little sauce to speak of. As a result, the 7th Trimester was pretty dry--I was expecting to be able to sop up cheese sauce with my biscuit, but it didn't really work like that. I will say the bacon was crisp and the egg was nicely over medium, but the combination of all of it was very underwhelming, especially when a bunch of other reviews had praised this particular dish. More sauce on the mac and cheese might have made this much better, but I think I'd skip it and try something else next time.\\n\\nMy husband's biscuits and gravy were better, but the sausage gravy was overly salty. The thyme added a nice note, though. I think we don't eat a lot of salt at home and don't eat out all that frequently, so the saltiness is probably normal for an average American diet, but if you're like us and don't eat a ton of salted or processed things, beware--it seems like this gravy might be pretty salty (or maybe we just got a salty batch that day).\\n\\nI would definitely try Se7en Bites again for breakfast, but right now it's not beating out our regular favorites like Keke's Cafe or First Watch. For desserts, this place seems fantastic--the number of things I wanted to try was huge, and I think we'd come back and try sweet items after dinner or something again soon. But for breakfast, I'll give it another shot and if it's not wowing me on the second visit, I'll probably skip breakfast here."},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"I was very impressed by this McDonalds.

Skip to the end for TL;DR. \\nWhen I arrived late (fashionably ofc), my first thought upon seeing our table was \\"yikes, were crammed in here\\" then, \\"wait, there's no seats for my friend and me.\\" They had given us a booth (meant for 5 ppl max) in the back near the bar and joined two tables. The booth next to us was free but I assumed it must've been reserved. My friend and I had no choice but to stand around the table (can't be fussy with a late reservation!) which thankfully felt natural since it was basically at the bar aka tall bar chairs/booths aka still eye level with everyone. After two more friends arrived and several minutes of hovering, the man who checked our IDs (maybe a manager?) upon entering the bar area came over and asked if we wanted to take the free booth. I had heard him saying something to the waitress about it being reserved but he still let us take it (maybe he saw me nibbling on my friends noodles while standing and felt bad.) \\n\\nNow seated, I ordered myself a stone bowl bibimbap with spicy pork. It didn't take long to come out though time passed as I stole some fried chicken from our other table. It is your standard bibimbap (rice topped with cucumbers, shredded carrots, egg, etc) with a side of gojuchang (mild Korean red chili paste) and I enjoyed it enough to order again. The portion is good for 1 but could technically feed up to 2 people. I could've eaten it all but I gave my friend a small bowl. The soy garlic fried chicken was crispy but could've used more flavor. The ramen dduk bok gi, standard also, was more sweet than it was spicy, which I preferred but my friend did not. We drank more than we ate but I'd say 7/10 for food. Nothing special but would probably get again. \\n\\nThe service was good. I don't know who our waitress was but Tristine (another employee) was seen walking around helping a lot of different tables including ours. I don't think she was meant to serve our table but she was who I could track down whenever I needed anything. Star for her.  There was also someone coming around every so often to clear the table so I liked that. \\n\\nIt was my first time here and my friends and I all had a good time. There was a mixture of Kpop and edm playing. Atmosphere was young, lively, and fun. Only downfall is having to find parking but that's to be expected for the Fenway area. My friend got a ticket cause we didn't see the sign for resident parking  (readings important, friends. Stay in school) \\n\\n\\nTL; DR\\n7/10 on the food- pretty standard korean dishes, nothing special but would order again. Great service- accommodates large parties well on short notice.

My girlfriend and I were lost looking for a friends condo when we saw their breakfast sign out front off of Walker Street. We decided to go in (this seemingly small cafe) and have some breakfast to take a break from arguing.  First few things we saw left us forgetting all about our friend's condo which included 15ft massive hand carved doors to our right and an entire wall of original art pieces to our left. Everywhere you look in the cafe section leaves you speechless. Once you're able to catch your breath a friendly young woman greeted us and quickly brought over some fantastic coffee. The menu was very unique but all based on something we knew and loved. I personally had the No Mas Benedict, different but awesome. We scarfed our breakfast and were drawn into the shop area by all the beautiful merchandise that is visible from the cafe's coffee bar. Ok, long story short this place has great food (still need to try their dinner menu but it looked great) great service, location couldn't be better, and great 'stuff' for sale. To describe their selection of things would be to compare it to the super Walmart of hand crafted goods which include everything from soaps to full farm table style dining room sets. There's literally something there for everyone and is a great place to find something special for someone last minute. One of the owners was even there to ask us if we needed help. I joked about wanting to see the upstairs items (there was a chain up in front of the stairs at the time) and we got a full tour of the high end stuff upstairs. There's no pressure to buy anything but its one of those places where you want it all and imagine having a larger house to put it in.  Good stuff, don't find places like this everyday."},{"name":"No Mas! Cantina","address":"180 Walker St SW, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Avoid this place like the plague! Yes, the decor is gorgeous but clearly that's where the whole budget went. The food is passable at best and the service is horrendous. This is not just my opinion. Every person I've mentioned it to has had the same response about it. You could pick another Mexican restaurant out of the phone book blindfolded and it would be better. By the way, I am Latin and I have several Latin friends who agree. \\nFirstly, the entrance to the restaurant is confusing. If you come in the front the first thing you will see is a ridiculously overpriced gift store. See something you like? Check Ebay, you'll find it for 300% less. \\nOnce you make it into the actual restaurant, good luck finding the hostess station.  I parked behind the restaurant (the only place to park) and when I came up the stairs the first thing I saw was a patio area. There was no sign or anything that indicated I should go to the hostess station to be seated. I was there to meet some friends so I went inside to see if I could find them. As I entered I saw NO servers or employees anywhere. There was something that looked like a small  bar (which I later found out was the hostess station but there was no one there.) I walked all around the place and couldn't find my friends so I went back to the patio to wait for them. When they arrived we figured that we should just seat ourselves on the patio. It was a week night and there were only three tables occupied outside. We chose a table and sat down. We kept trying to get the server's attention for drinks and menus but she seemed to go out of her way to avoid us. Finally I went inside to see if I could find another server. This time there was someone who looked like an employee who was standing close to the hostess station but didn't greet me or anything. I had to initiate the conversation. I asked if we could have someone take our drink orders and she looked at me like I was an idiot and told me we were supposed to be seated by the hostess first. She followed me outside with menus. Even after having been \\"officially\\" seated, the server still ignored us (remember there were only 3 other tables occupied. And, no, she was not covering indoors as well.) I finally called out to here and she came over to take our orders. When the food came my order was wrong. \\nThe food was bland but edible. As we ate, we noticed that there was a female patron in a party of three who was highly intoxicated. She was laughing and carrying on but nothing too disruptive. Halfway through our meal her chair tipped back (the chairs are VERY badly designed. On the patio they are basket chairs that are narrower at the bottom than the seat is.) The girl slammed her head on the concrete floor and was knocked unconscious. I realize that this was not the fault of the restaurant but it was their reaction that absolutely floored us. A server came up and stood there uselessly as one of the people in the girl's party squatted down and held the girl's head. Finally the manager showed up and the first thing he was concerned about was that the server there removed the girl's drink from the table immediately. At this point customers were shouting at them to call an 911. The manager looked around not knowing what to do and then finally asked a server to call 911. This is when I noticed that one of the workers from the kitchen was standing behind us watching and chuckling. When the ambulance showed up the girl, who had revived, was taken away. \\nWe finished our meal and paid our bill. We then asked if we could see the manager. We were very polite but we wanted to tell him that we were appalled at how he handled the situation when a patron injured herself. He explained that it was not their fault that she had gotten so drunk because she drank at the bar inside the restaurant before being seated on the patio. We explained that it wasn't about how drunk she got but about how the situation was dealt with once she injured herself. He seemed confused and kept telling us it wasn't their fault that she had gotten so intoxicated.\\nI am not one for hyperbole.

Hidden away in the corner of the Kilarney Market strip-mall on 49th and Elliot, this place has wonderful food.  \\n\\nThe decor is simple but the server was lovely and very polite.\\n\\nThe food is well portioned, balanced and seasoned just right.  I tried the Beef Deopbap (\\"traditionally marinated beef slices and fresh vegetables over steamed rice\\") and my boyfriend had the Bulgogi (\\"beef that is sliced, seasoned, and barbequed in a Korean style\\").  Both were wonderful.  The Beef Deobap was thinly sliced beef with a soft, almost smokey flavour mixed with thinly sliced red peppers and carrots on a bed of lettuce and rice.  The texture of the beef with the lettuce and rice was a pleasant surprise and perfectly filling.  The Bulgogi was a slightly richer flavour, almost like a sweet gravy, but not quite, difficult for me to describe.  It was on a bed of potato noodles, something I'd never heard of, which held the flavour of the Bulgogi nicely and had a similar texture to rice noodles.  Part way through our meal, one of the chefs came out with a desert for us to try, on the house.  It was a scoop of red bean paste on the bottom and vanilla ice-cream on top with what tasted like some tapioca candies on top.  The combination was great together, very light in flavour, the ice-cream added just the right amount of sweetness to the red bean paste and the red bean paste added a more interesting texture to the ice-cream.  A great treat to enjoy at the end of your meal without feeling like you're over-indulging in something too rich.\\n\\nThe price point is excellent, my dish was $7 and my boyfriend's was $14 (because his was a platter).  Normally when we go out it's $30-$40 for the two of us, so having this place right down the street from us and only paying $22 for dinner for two will definitely have us coming back for more, and often!\\n\\nAll in all, healthy, delicious food at a great price!

For starters, they bring you a 4-piece wing sampler of the 4 types of sauces they have, 3 which are standard and 1 which rotates, so you can pick what you want to gorge on. The standard ones were all solid (2 were sort of spicy, 1 was typical BBQ), but the special sauce of the day Apple Bourbon was outstanding so we all decided to go with that. About 5 minutes later (these things are made to order so it's not instantaneous), a giant container of wings was set down in front of us and we went to town. \\n\\nThese are no wimpy wings, we're talking big meaty drums and wings cooked to juicy perfection and slathered in amazing Apple Bourbon sauce.

It just so happens that sweet/molassey + porkey is a flavor I love in my beans, so I was personally really pleased with them. Additionally, each table has a selection of 6 sauces you can add to whatever you order, ranging from sweet to standard BBQ to hot... I didn't mess with the Apple Bourbon perfection, but I could see this being great for a normal meal here.

I honestly believe the waitress only stopped by originally because she had over heard my comments. She made a comment when she came over that she was going to be our waitress 'apparently'. After this one comment she wasn't bad honestly. Polite but was gone for long periods of time. When our food arrived my fiance's had a hair in it. A service professional then came over and took the food we asked her for more water as well because at this point we had been waiting nearly 15 with empty glasses. His food finally arrived still not water. Another 10 minuted of waiting and we asked to see the manager. Angela was great! She comped our food and completely took care of us. She sent the service professional back over who admitted she had asked someone else to fill the water and that's why it had gone undone. She was quite wonderful as well.

Very rare joints can get it right, and I mean right. Either seasoning of texture lacks.\\n\\nMy eggs arrives just on time, considering they are jam packed. First impression very good plating. No fluff, or unnecessary garnishing. The sauce looks good. To be honest, this was the best hollandaise I had in Vancouver. Silky, lighter than air texture, just clings the eggs very gently, strongly seasoned, wonderful balance of acid and salt, great buttery finish. Perfectly poached eggs, yolk is slightly thickened with heat, not raw and running all over the place, completely coagulated whites with no vinegar notes to it. Perfectly cooked bacon. Or am I still drunk? No, everything is perfect. The home fries on my plate, wonderfully crispy and meaty, beautifully seasoned. Wait, a ha! one round of potato has a rotten edge to it. Maybe I should complain and make a scene... No, these guys made my day, got me back to life...\\n\\nAnd one last impressive note; their service is like a well choreographed play. Everybody is Zen calm and moving in a perfect harmony, considering the full seating, no signs of stress or even rushing.

That was a great introduction to the delicious food - I recommend everyone order this way on their first visit. Here's a quick summary of what we had:\\n\\nAppetizer: picked veggies - very strong..which is a good thing!\\nAppetizer: ham tea sandwiches - I can't even really figure out how this is made, but these sandwiches are great!!\\n\\nSalad: Kale Salad - amazing, and I'm not a generally a kale fan. The simple creamy dressing perfectly ties together the flavors of the kale, cheese and apples.\\n\\nEntrees: We've tried the Meatloaf (see above, my favorite), the shrimp over grits, and the fried chicken. I read a lot about the fried chicken, but I'm not \\"too\\" impressed. But, it IS good. The meatloaf is a wonderful blend well-seasoned beef and pork topped with the dream-team of bacon covered in a sweet glaze (of some sort).\\n\\nThe sides: My favorites are the sweet corn and the mashed potatoes. With honorable mention going to the Mac & Cheese (even if it is a little bit too strong to eat too much of it). All of the sides were great. Oh! And, the cornbread! Excellent.\\n\\nThe desserts are my only complaint. :( In our two visits we have tried: \\nThe pound cake - which I found dry and too dense. I did not care for the pineapple sauce on top of it.\\nThe \\"Awesome chocolate cake\\" - not awesome. :( Just like the pound cake I found it too be too dry and dense...maybe this is just another cake style that the baker is going for, but it is not my/our cup of tea...\\nThe peach pie (more like a tart) with cinnamon strussel topping. \\nThe lemon icebox pie - think key lime pie, but lemon instead.\\n*Both of the pies were good...but, I can't really say they were excellent...I think they could do better. The lemon could use a more \\"tart\\" flavor to go with the very good fresh whipped cream topping. I thought the graham cracker crust could be a little thinner and dryer..not so much like a cake. \\n\\nI hate to complain about dessert, but I honestly think that its Revival's only weakness on an otherwise excellent menu offering. Perhaps they could import a couple of desserts from the local Southern Sweets Bakery? It fits the southern theme and they are local.... they have excellent cakes and pies.\\n\\nOther than the food, we found the service to be excellent on both visits.

I've tried a similar style of bacon at a nearby joint, but I found the other version too nutty and overly sweet. Screen Door has perfected this balance. As far as the entrees, the chicken was certainly flavorful and juicy, but my fiance found himself craving some dark meat on the bone probably should've gotten the drumsticks instead); and in ordering the po boy, I have realized that I do not like catfish. It was my first time, and I just don't prefer the flavor. I ended up removing the catfish and replaced it with a piece of fried chicken that came with the waffle. In the end, we left feeling heavy and unsatisfied.\\n\\nI really think it must be personal preference though because of all the stellar reviews on here. At least, that is what I'm going to chalk it up to this time. I will probably try again someday and see if I can change my review. (The biscuits and gravy looked amazing.)

About 20 minutes later, I missed 2 calls from Domino's. I called back immediately. I asked if everything was ok. She asked for which order, I said the one for 6 pizzas for my 8 year old's party and the venue. She (the same lady that took the order) couldn't figure out who had called. So we just made sure the order was on track and she reassured me that our order was good to go. Fast forward to an hour and twenty minutes later (the pizza is already 10 minutes late at this point) they had NO record of our order. They said they couldn't find the venue and just canceled the order. So now we're one hour and 30 minutes into a 2 hour party with 12 hungry 7 to 8 year olds and no pizza. SO my husband ran to the car to drive to the nearest Little Caesars for some Hot n Ready pizzas. On the way he calls to speak with the manager.

I don't know about you, but I've been yelled at once or twice at Redbones so just being able to walk in and sit wherever is nice.\\n- Sauce caddy at the table. A four-pack container of their four sauces in squirt bottles already waiting for you. You don't have to ask your server, you don't have to have magical pre-knowledge of what sauces they have, and you get a full squirt bottle, not a tiny cup full of whatever.\\n- FREAKIN WING NIGHT. $8.99 for all you can eat. They just keep bringing you piles of wings until you say stop (They have awesome service by the way). Plus you get to choose from a variety of sauces like apple bourbon and spicy jalapeno I think it was.\\n- Mac and cheese: they top theirs with crumbled bbq chips. Just one of those little details that just melted my heart and I fell in love.\\n- FRIED mac and cheese. Don't knock it til you try it\\n- I like their pulled pork better than Lester's and Redbones pulled pork (SORRY!

Dense and kind of cake-like, with little corn kernels in it. Much better than Redbones and Blue Ribbon's cornbread. That stuff is a bbq staple, get it right and it makes all the difference\\n- I usually don't care for collard greens, but I actually really liked theirs\\n\\n\\nThe only downsides of Soulfire:\\n- Only a limited beer menu.

We went here last night for my partner's birthday dinner and had a fabulous experience.  The food was sublime, the service was excellent, and the prices were affordable.\\n\\nI honestly could not believe how hopping this place was on a Tuesday night.  We arrived just before 8:00pm, and there was about a 15 minute wait on the sign-in sheet.  Right after we signed in, several more groups arrived, pushing the wait time to probably 20-30 minutes for those groups.  No worries, though, as we ordered some drinks and perused the menu while waiting.  I got a Scarlett O'Hara (Southern Comfort, cranberry, and lime), and my partner ordered the Texas Black Gold (tequila, blackberry puree, and lemonade).  Both were tasty and STRONG.\\n\\nWe were seated at a tiny 2-person table in the middle of the busy floor, but I didn't feel squashed at all.  The service was truly superb - friendly, attentive, and responsive, without hovering or being in your face.  The vibe you get from the employees is that they are really enjoying themselves, which makes the dining experience all that much better.  My water glass was never empty, even though I had insatiable thirst last night for some reason.\\n\\nWe started off with an appetizer of mildly-spicy pimiento cheese spread with crackers.  Dinner for me was the buttermilk fried chicken, which was divine.  The chicken was moist, bursting with flavor, and not the least bit greasy or oily, and was served with a peppery tasso ham gravy on the side that added perfect kick.  The mashed potatoes and the collard greens for the sides were just okay.  My partner ordered the pecan-crusted trout, which was also absolutely delicious.  I am not a fan of trout, but this was prepared so well that I scarfed up the sample bites that I tried from his plate.\\n\\nThe portions are huge - neither of us could finish our meals.  I agree with some of the previous reviews that the chicken could serve as a meal for two.  Instead we just had our leftovers boxed up and now we have something tasty to bring to work for lunch.\\n\\nWe saved room in the dessert compartments (which as anyone knows are completely separate from your main dish compartment) of our stomachs to split an order of the chocolate cake.  The cake was served with fresh vanilla bean ice cream and a gorgeous drizzle of raspberry sauce...  as stuffed as we already were, we somehow polished off this plate as well.\\n\\nAs we headed out the door after paying our very reasonable bill (about 50 bucks including a generous tip), the manager (owner?) approached us and asked how our evening was.  He seemed more earnest than just the \\"how was everything\\" forced-smile query you often receive at other restaurants.  We gushed about how much we enjoyed everything, and he chatted with us for a moment before we headed out.  All in all, it was a wonderful evening and I can't wait to go back."},{"name":"Honky Tonk Hot Dogs","address":"415 Jessie St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I make a pretty good dog at the house but...

I didn't really know what to expect from a soul food restaurant in one of the whitest cities in America.\\n\\nIt was difficult to choose an entree.  The seafood special sounded amazing, the screen door platter sounded like a good way to try a few of their staples, and the idea of having something nice and meaty like fried chicken, brisket, or pork shoulder was highly appealing.  Ultimately, I went with the pork shoulder, although people at other tables got the brisket and fried chicken, and they looked spectacular.\\n\\nThe pork shoulder was served with a spicy BBQ sauce on top of a bed of delicious beans.  This dish was fantastic; the pork shoulder just fell right apart.  It didn't look like much, but I left stuffed.\\n\\nThe mac and cheese is spot on as well.  If you get the platter, make sure you use mac and cheese as one of your selections.\\n\\nThey also serve local Hot Lips sodas if you're into that; the marionberry soda gave the meal a nice local touch.\\n\\nI don't think it's fair to rate this place based on whether it's worth the wait; its popularity should not affect the rating it deserves.

Classic diner prices!\\n\\nI couldn't say a single bad thing about my experience here.

The chicken was juicy and the grilled marks imparts a great bitter flavor which is balanced by the acidic dressing and feta cheese. The lettuce and onions were very fresh and gave the wrap a nice crispy texture.

I was told this was abnormal, and usually service is much better.\\n\\nFor being primarily a brewery, I wasn't super impressed by any of their beers. Ruby, their famous raspberry offering, is very drinkable but very forgettable. There's far better raspberry beers to be had elsewhere, and while it's not a bad choice of beverage, it's very average. The other brews I tried were similar. The Deep Sea Baltic porter and Valyrian Steel oatmeal stout were both extremely average, and while they are fine to drink, I wouldn't seek out either again.

HORRIBLE experience.\\n\\nI contacted Rami's to cater a ~15 person event.  I sent the date, time, place, and order to the email provided on their website.  The manager (Haim) responded asking for my phone number, and I provided it.  I missed his first call and called him back to finalize.  He answered to tell me he needed to call me back in \\"just a minute.\\"  One hour later, he still hadn't called back so I called him.  Turns out he had totally forgotten about me.  He quoted me a price that seemed a bit high, but I assumed I would get an invoice or receipt later to double check everything, so I provided my credit card info.  Before we got off the phone he asked me if my organization was tax-exempt, which it is, but he did not adjust the price.\\n\\nThe day of the event, Rami's still hadn't shown up 15 minutes after they were supposed to.  I called the restaurant and the man who answered had no record of a catering order and said he couldn't get the food to us until 1PM: 1.5 hours after my scheduled delivery time and also after my event was supposed to be over.  I told him that wasn't going to work and he had the manager call me.  The manager promised to have the food there before 12:30 and promised a discount.  He sort of apologized, but also acted like none of this was their fault because they had a problem with their gas system that morning.  Except that from what I gathered from the man at the restaurant, they had forgotten about my order completely.  Also, it would have been pretty uncool for them not to warn me that they had hit a problem filling my order anyway, since that prevents me from being able to make other food arrangements.  \\n\\nThe food finally showed up a little after 12:30.  Many of the takeout containers were crushed, but it was the least of my worries at that point.  There was no receipt anywhere in my order.\\n\\nAfter I got home I emailed the manager asking him to call me to settle the bill and also to send me a receipt so that I could have the expense reimbursed by my organization.  I also reminded him that the total should be reduced because the man at the restaurant did not provide us with the extra pita I ordered after telling me that it wouldn't be necessary. \\n\\nI called the manager three days later because he still hadn't called me.  He apologized, saying he hadn't had time, although he apparently did have time to charge my credit card $20 MORE than the full, original amount I was quoted.  I opened up negotiations about the price reduction I was promised, and also asked why the bill was so high in the first place given (1) our tax status, (2) the lack of pita from our original order, and (3) the fact that adding the prices from their online menu came to a total almost $90 lower than what he charged me!  The manager said that the pita was never factored into the original quote he gave me (what?!), and that the difference was probably due to their $35 delivery fee.  First of all, $35 for delivery is outrageous - especially when that delivery was more than an hour late - and second of all, $35 still did not make up for the difference even assuming that I was incorrectly charged for both tax and extra pita.  The manager said he would go \\"look into this\\" and promised to call me back within the next hour.  Unsurprisingly, I did not get a call back and never got a receipt, either.  \\n\\nAt that point, I felt like I had gone to great lengths to try and work things out with Rami's, only to face continued disrespect and disorganization on their end.  They had many opportunities to make this right, and they didn't.  So I took the dispute to my credit card company.  I realize that Rami's is one of very few kosher restaurants in the area, but I will not be returning."},{"name":"Applebee's Grill + Bar","address":"2728 New Spring Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"**exhales** I've hated applebees since I was in my late teens and started dating.

Applebees, chilis, tgif, etc. Places like this blow! idk why the food is flavorless, all tastes the same, or upsets my stomach.

What's even more disappointing is the pictures are so pretty and appetizing in the menu but no one around us (including ourselves) food looked like anything depicted!

Which means when you see him express what you want quickly before he passes and you have to wait another 10 minutes before he comes back through.

Why do I have to request addition napkins when you see there are 2 children at the table?! 0_o  I'm assuming all this scatter brain-ness was due to being under staffed, there is a sign on the door saying they are hiring.

We were excited because their five year old loves pirates, and they had where dad's get to eat dinner free. We ended up getting there and signed up for the VIP package for 25 dollars more to where as you are waiting for the dinner you get to go to the VIP lounge and have appetizers like mushroom ravioli, shrimp cocktail, empanadas, quiche, cheeses, water etc. The dinner itself I must say was not very good you get a choice between chicken and steak, I had the chicken my husband had the steak. he said the steak is only good with A1 it was very dry and flavorless, the chicken was pretty much the same. They give you soup or salad prior to the main entree, and the soup i had was tomato which tasted like they were making Campbell's tomato soup and put in flour to thicken it more and had raw clumps of flour in the soup and it was very awful and had no taste, could have really used at least salt for any hope of having a good taste. The vegetables with the main courses were obviously the frozen vegetable medley you can buy in bulk bags and they give those with no seasoning what so ever as well. The rice was the fairest food they had on the entree that had flavor and was the best thing on that plate. The dessert was a frozen sheet cake with very poor chocolate frosting and reddi whip on top with thrown around chocolate syrup. The cake I had to say was the most enjoyable part of the actual dinner, the appetizers in the VIP lounge were even better than the actual dinner. The boys did appreciate they did get unlimited pitches of beer during the show so that was the best thing for them for the father's day celebration. I had tea which in itself was way too sweet and had artificial flavoring in it that was not enjoyable either. The show itself was pretty good once it finally picked up, the beginning was sort of boring. I enjoyed seeing the amount of interaction that the guests have in the show. Where we were seated in the blue section the steps I almost tripped and fell several times on my way to the bathroom because the floor had a cord that was pulled loose and I had to be careful and watch for it in the dark to make sure i didn't fall on the cord or the stairs so I wouldn't go into early labor or hurt the baby. So watch when you are there during dinner for loose cords because obviously you can really hurt yourself. The floor on the way to the bathroom is very uneven as well and if you have to go during the show it is dark and uneven floor that will make you trip if your not holding on to anything. The waitress was very nice but not that attentive during the show. If you have kids beware of the child options for the food our friend's little boy that was with us got the chicken fingers and the mac and cheese dinner they get as their option the mac and cheese was obviously bagged very nasty cheese tasting noodles and the chicken nuggets were cold in the center as if they had been previously frozen and just heated in a microwave which they looked and tasted just like that. We ended up an hour later getting a chicken adult meal to go for him at least after having complained about the kid's meal to our waitress. \\n\\nOver all the experience was bad and apparently dangerous for pregnant women. The food was not great or impressive what so ever. It was something that the dads enjoyed though for the beer and the show was not so bad. Would not recommend or go back again though."},{"name":"Christopher's","address":"1920 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"You know, I tried to write this review before, and was going to give this place 4 stars, but after living away from Christopers for 6 months now, I realize what a good thing it had going for it.  \\n\\nThis is a go to when I used to live in the Porter Square area and couldn't figure out what to have for dinner.\\n\\nIt was a great choice for drinks after work.

Bear with me here and listen to why I'm giving it two stars:\\n\\nSERVICE:\\nWas below par. The wait staff was short with us, in spite of it not being especially busy. They definitely had some of the smug arrogance that comes with certain demographics in Portland. I always have a lot of questions for wait staff, and most handle it politely -- sometimes they're even chatty which is awesome -- but of all the nicer restaurants in Portland Screen Door's staff was, unfortunately, the least polite.\\n\\nFOOD:\\nFrankly, nothing special. They put bacon in everything, which I thought was a really boring way to handle your menu. I like to sample different things, but everything here has similar ingredients (bacon). The collard greens have bacon, the gravy has bacon, everything has bacon. \\n\\nAdditionally, almost literally everything on the menu is fried. I question whether they have a full kitchen in back or just a bunch of deep fryers. \\n\\nI know that bacon is all the rage these days. I do. But I expect a supposedly gourmet restaurant to be able to use ingredients in creative ways that I wouldn't have been able to think up on my own. An example might be how at Toro Bravo the chicken liver was actually delicious and was made with some kind of flowers that just worked really well. \\n\\nI had the trout, the chicken, the collard greens, the oysters, and the cornbread.\\n\\nThe cornbread is dry. Maybe some people like it served that way.\\n\\nThe oysters were bland. They were deep fried in a batter and the batter just tasted like maybe flour, some pepper, and salt.\\n\\nThe chicken is moist, but the batter (the chicken is also fried) just tastes like salt. It's very salty. The chicken wasn't bad though. Just not really anything that interesting. I can't honestly say that the chicken is better than KFC or Popeyes.\\n\\nThe trout was pretty good, but they don't give you much of it. Small portions.\\n\\nThe collard greens just tasted like bacon. I didn't realize they had bacon in them, so I was really disappointed. I've never had collard greens except stuffed, so I wanted to be able to experience what they taste like.\\n\\nDECOR:\\n\\nThe decor is great. It's low light, clean, relaxing. You can see the kitchen, which is always great.

Anyone who really knows me knows that I do not really eat fish. I never had swordfish before, and if this was any other place, I still probably wouldn't have tried it. I give it an A+!

This and the steak were perfectly seasoned.\\n\\nI ordered a drink called Into the Woods, which contained bourbon, ginger, an apple brandy and cynar. The sweetness of the ginger paired nicely with the bitterness of the cynar.\\n\\nSince we loved our meal, we couldn't leave this place without trying a dessert. We ordered smoked chocolate bread pudding, which was oddly interesting. The smoky flavor in the pudding (closest thing I can compare it to is bacon) was a nice juxtaposition against the sweetness of the chocolate and the ice cream it came with.\\n\\nService was impeccable, and our waitress did a great job at answering our questions.\\n\\nMy only really small complaint was the order the food was brought out. We were brought our steak first, when it would've been nice to start with a lighter dish (the burrata, for example).\\n\\nAlden & Harlow really does a great job at elevating simple ingredients to bring out dynamite flavors.

The seating is limited but the space is very well used.  There is a very good chance you will be sitting right next to someone.\\n\\nService: They work similar to Hopdoddy.  You wait in line [if there is one] if they have seating available they hand you a number and you can order.  If there isn't any seating available you stand around and wait until there is.  The person handing out numbers was polite and asked everyone in line if they had any questions about the menu and was quite informative.\\n\\nThey don't really have a wait staff, they have people that bus the tables but nobody asked us if we wanted a refill or another drink or anything, apparently that was all on us.\\n\\nFood:  We both got a #1 with extra noodles and added Naruto Maki.   The Naruto Maki was good, the noodles were good, the pork belly was delicious and the egg was fantastic.\\n\\nThe broth unfortunately neither one us particularly cared for.  I'm not saying the broth is  BAD, it isn't. I imagine it's quite good, I just didn't care for the  taste of it and neither did my husband.  I prefer more traditional ramen broth and this most definitely wasn't that. \\n\\nPrice: Too expensive for my taste. You get a moderate sized bowl of broth, with very few noodles. A small amount of pork and an egg. Extra noodles costs you 1.50 and is a requirement if you're looking for a dinner portion amount of food, I have friends who  get 2 orders of extra noodles because they're a bit skimpy.\\n\\nThe amount of pork you get is small and if you want more pork it's another 3 bucks.   So for a bowl of ramen for myself it was 11.50...for soup.  I mean...it's...it's friggin soup!\\n\\nOverall:  This is a place I still mention to friends when they ask for something Japanese. Especially if they specifically ask for ramen as this is definitely a place a lot of my friends LOVE and I understand why they love it.\\n\\nThe big turn off for me is the price I had to pay for something I though was only \\"alright\\" and I didn't leave all that satisfied.  It's an acquired taste and a LOT of people love it.  You won't know if you love it or not until you go so I do recommend it, just don't expect a traditional ramen as that is not what they advertise and certainly not what they serve! \\n\\n*sidenote* You can not order to go according to signage on the front of the door, so you MUST be willing to sit there and wait for your food. Also, they do NOT have anything to give you if you decide you want to take any home, so be ready to finish eating whatever you ordered.

The salad was sizable and the seasonal veggies were pickled golden radishes, carrot slivers, and fresh cherry tomatoes. I really enjoyed how fresh everything tasted and the tangy vinaigrette. The trout comes beautifully plated - two small skin-on fillets atop a bed of chilled lentil and radish salad. I'd absolutely order it again.\\n\\nMy clients tried the fried chicken tender salad ($17) and the crab cake hash ($18) lunch entree and both were happy with their choices.

We arrived early...about 5:00... not knowing that dinner opened at 5:30. The owner saw us outside and showed tremendous hospitality by opening the doors early. He then reviewed each item on the menu and made recommendations based on insight we provided (one of the four in our party is a vegetarian). We ordered a variety of dishes and shared them to allow for a true taste of Indian cuisine. Spectacular is the best description of each dish. Many times the sauces of Indian cuisine has similar flavors but not here. Each had a distinct and unique quality that stood out. In addition, the naan came out hot and fresh as if the oven was table side. Finally, they were made aware that the vegetarian in our party was celebrating a birthday. The true reflection of hospitality was the dessert the owner delivered with a lit candle. I have long wondered where service went in the service industry such as restaurants. It was obvious to all of us who had such a splendid meal and experience that it is still well and alive at Memories Of India."},{"name":"Masa","address":"439 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This place was a joy.

They also take reservations through OpenTable, which is super helpful! Just make sure you book 2 hours prior to when you want to dine at the restaurant.\\n\\nWe got complementary bread prior to our meals. It was two types of bread, some type of corn bread and something else that I forgot. And they give you two types of spread: a honey maple butter of some sort and a cranberry spread. So so good.\\n\\nOur food came pretty quickly! Or my friend and I were so into conversation time flew by. My friend and I both ordered the Santa Fe Styled eggs benedict. It was so good! I got mine with bacon and she got her's with chorizo. The home fries were just as I liked them. The biscuits were delicious and the avocado creme was yuuuum. The eggs were cooked to perfection.

The service was superb but the food lacked somewhat. I ordered the app sampler and everything was delicious, the spinach artichoke dip stood out the most to me. It was so creamy and just ahh yummy. I was hesitant to try the mozzarella sticks with marinara for the first time, usually I get stuck with crappy sauce and it just ruins the mozzarella app but I was pleasantly surprised. Everything was great and our server was very attentive and all around a great guy. I ordered the 7 0z sirloin... it was just not good. I wanted medium rare got well done, didn't say anything since I was enjoying the time with my family. The veggies that come with it seem like they have been microwaved but I dismissed it happily enjoying the evening with my folks who liked their own food. \\n\\nThe second time I went with a friend, we ordered cocktails I had the margarita special... it was just terrible. It was like drinking straight up lemonade. The food tasteless and out server checked on us twice, she was busy sucking up to a larger table, obviously wanting a good tip but come on. I had to flag her down a few times to get her to get us more drinks, and to make matters worse she brought the check and we weren't even ready! We asked for another round of drinks (patron margaritas) and she got snippy, she even rolled her eyes. LOL!! I was flabbergasted! We decided to leave the moment two men got into a fist fight outside clearly in front of everyone. Some guys cheering the other guy to beat the other guy up. It was awful to say the least so we split. \\n\\nNow the third time I should have known better! Went with friends got the Nappa Chicken... Horrible the potatoes looked that they had been sitting back there all days. The ribs the same, slathered with bbq sauce and my guess microwaved.

Visiting Franklin Barbeque is an experience. I arrived at 7:30 AM on a Wednesday morning. I was lucky enough to snag one of their free chairs (picture posted). I was sixth in line. The restaurant opens at 11 AM, so I chose to read the lastest copy of Food and Wine, which ironically featured Franklin Barbeque as one of the essential places to go while visiting Texas. In between reading articles, I spoke to other people in line. Some were visiting from out of town, the lady who was ahead of me was there to get loads of various meats to bring back to her work (lucky coworkers). Chatting with various friendly strangers helped make the time pass by fairly quickly. Right before the restaurant opened, I turned around and saw hundreds (not even exaggerating) of people lined up to try what some have hailed to be the best barbeque in the country. Well, I became one of those people that day. I ordered brisket, baked beans and slaw. I took one bite of the brisket and was hooked. The meat is fork tender and juicy. It's perfectly smoked and seasoned. That smokey flavor is so complex and unique. The acidity of the slaw helps cut the fat of the brisket. It cleanses your palate and prepares you for the next bite. The beans were delicious as well. I had the opportunity to meet the owner, Aaron Franklin, who was nice enough to take a picture with me. I also purchased a travel brisket. It's fully cooked and chilled. Thankfully, the Austin W was kind enough to keep the brisket in their refrigerator until I checked out of the hotel. I was so happy that I was able to share the brisket with my family and that the quality of their travel brisket matched what I had at the restaurant. I highly recommend visiting this restaurant for a fantastic meal.

After standing in the door for six minutes, and free servers not seating us, I had to say \\"excuse me\\" to get them to come over, even though they saw us come in. Next upon being seated we were told that the Groupon we used that \\"included everything and two drinks\\" limited a portion of the menu, and two glasses of water (carbonated or regular), and the kicker: WE STILL HAD TO PAY $10 for the hot pot soup! Talk about false advertising. That's correct they demanded an additional 10$ on top of the 32 we paid for the Groupon. So the \\"HOT POT & SUSHI Groupon.... CHARGES EXTRA FOR THE HOT POT.... (and doesn't serve the Sushi, read below).\\n           Next, this is where it gets funny: First the waters were brought to us one glass at a time (talk about screwing the pooch), and then items one at a time randomly with people who sat after us receiving their orders faster, albeit also totally out of order. Sometimes it would be one or two pieces of this, or one or two pieces of that, and then a few later, totally out of order or reason whatsoever. It also goes without saying that I had to wave the order paper around in the air for eight minutes and then wait another three to have the order paper taken, as the staff just sort of walk around in circles not doing anything. What is this place?\\n           Of our order, we only received 26 of the 80 or so items we ordered.  Really easy stuff like this type of noodle or that type of vegetable, or this kind of sushi etc, nearly nothing arrived. I nicely asked the waitress if our food was coming, and was brushed off never to see them again about it. At one point the waitress even mocked us for being too white to handle the spicy dish. Imagine pulling that shit anywhere else? Can you believe the offensive audacity? \\n              Round two is where it's really fun: During round one, we received maybe half at most of the Sushi we ordered: round two however JUST DIDN'T COME. NOTHING. I even told the waitress who brought a random bowl of rice out of no where that we didn't order that we were waiting on more items, and again, nothing. I've been a waiter, I know how staff kill time, but this is completely unacceptable. I've also been a manager, and this entire experience made me cringe and lose my appetite. McDonald's has better service than this, and most of them are baked.\\n            Look I get it, this place is bottom of the barrel quality. It's cheap, right? Well no it's not, it was still $40+ out of my pocket for a terrible time, poor quality, and to even be racially mocked. Had I known any of this (I trusted the Groupon reviews, not the yelp ones.... first mistake), maybe I wouldn't have gone in; and if I didn't have other business tonight I would have refused to pay entirely for this ABSOLUTE RIP OFF- but I didn't feel like arguing with absent management and/or police tonight.\\n          As for the food: The hot pot was standard fare, the meat was fresh and acceptable, and everything else was obviously just thawed out hours before. The Sushi, the SIX OF TWENTY FOUR PIECES ORDERED THAT ACTUALLY ARRIVED, was supermarket quality, and I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.\\n         Again, to clarify, it was not busy in there, nor did we order anything complicated, and we could clearly see the kitchen staff just goofing around and not actually doing anything. Korean guests received faster service than everyone else, and even then, I could see they were getting screwed over too. I couldn't believe the comatose manner with which the server didn't care that we were still waiting for our order.\\n           Bottom line: a $32 all inclusive sushi and hot pot all you can eat with drinks was a complete let down that over charged us and couldn't even deliver water (great drink selection there guys) properly, let alone half of the ordered items."},{"name":"Club 185","address":"185 E Livingston Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Upon entering the place it seemed nice, and people appeared to be enjoying themselves.

You see I'm not that much of a carnivore but If it's rated this high and given the reputation you know I had to do what I have to do to add this to my Bucket list of TO DO's before I find my peace on earth.  After discovering about this place and hearing all the RANTS and RAVES, I finally checked it off my list.  \\n\\nSo it's a Wednesday and it's my last day vacationing in Texas so I made the commitment to brave the estimated 3-5 hour wait in mid December in Texas. Well with a little push from my sister \\"Alysse\\" who is such a foodie who also was there to experience it with me.  \\n\\nBeing a weekday and in December we leave San Antonio at 5am and arrive in Austin at 7am to find ourselves 25th-27th in line.  Come to find out the first persons in line arrived at 6:15am.  With all my extensive research before making the trip (bringing camp chairs, beers, liquor, games and etc) I felt we were good in place and would definitely get to enjoy some BBQ.  We did forget our chairs and games and pretty much everything suggested except a bottle of local Texas whiskey that my Sis cleverly brought for us. However I noticed they have a good amount of chairs for the patrons to use while waiting.  This place reminds me of a old diner with the nostalgic sign and decor.  Well the wait begins and T-minus 4 hours begins.  With the 48 degree weather, thank god we had that bottle of whiskey because time was dragging although the smell of the BBQ being slow cooked made the excitement of the wait bearable.  \\n\\nFast forward, opening time and the door is open as we were herded inside the restaurant and the anticipation grows with the smell of sweet deliciousness food aroma fills the room.  After about 20 mins in line, we were there standing in front of the carving board putting our orders in.  Although we had our game plan set of what to order,  your stomach was like a lil more of this and that was in the brain. \\n\\nFor the three of us I think we made a good order\\n\\nOne Pound of Brisket 1/2 Lean & 1/2 fatty\\nOne pound of Ribs\\n1/2 pound of Turkey\\n1/2 Pound of Pulled Pork\\n2 Links\\nPint of Potato Salad\\nPint of Baked Beans\\nPint of Cole Slaw\\nHalf Loaf of White Bread\\n\\nThe dining area has seating occupancy for about 36 and we were fortunate to get a table to enjoy our lunch.  The first bite had to be the Brisket and before I can even comment I hear my sister floating away to heaven and immediately I was right behind her. I mean the meat was cooked so perfect that you did not need a OUNCE of energy to even bite into the meat.  It literally broke off in your mouth and after a few soft chews it was gone.  Flavor WAS on POINT which made it hard to believe that all it was is Salt, Pepper, and spices.  I'm not a fan of fats in my mean but the fatty portion of the brisket was something I would never regret.\\n\\nMoving on tho the Ribs which I rarely eat also was a change of heart for me at least for this place.  Again as I went for the bite and expected the resistant pull apart from the bone,  the meat came off without a struggle.  The way it was cooked and the balanced seasoning made it one of the best ribs I EVER had.  I've never had eaten a rib without leaving meat left on it and this bone was completed stripped. OK i gotta stop.\\n\\nThe Turkey and Pork was nice and moist with the peppery taste and hint of smoked wood on it made it interesting.  With these two items I made me a slather of a sandwich with the White Bread and Cole slaw.  Oh, be prepared to get down and dirty because you'll need to or want to lick your fingers clean. I felt bad for the sides due to the fact of the gorging on the meats but best believe we did our damage to every single item ordered. The House made Slaw was lightly dressed and so refreshing with that light crunch with every bite. Baked beans was so flavorful with pieces of pork inside and the mix of the salty sugary confection of a good BBQ baked beans.  \\n\\nOh I didn't forget about the Potato Salad, as I like something cold for dessert so the salad it was.  Perfectly cut to size where its not so big or mushy and dressed to where you can taste the potato and not all the dressing overwhelming your palette.  \\n\\nIf you haven't been here, PLEASE, PLEASE don't go because you'll make the wait in line longer for me:)   Just Kidding............

I was initially sitting on my scarf on the ground but my butt got really cold so I grabbed one of the many chairs they have available and used my scarf to cover my lap.  They really try to make waiting in the line as easy as possible - like with the chairs.  Also the restaurant is open for you to buy drinks and/or use the restroom, which is super accommodating.  \\n\\nThe main door opened promptly at 11:00 and the line started moving!  I made it to the front just before noon, so my total wait time was a little over 2.5 hours.  When I got up there, they were running low on turkey, but that's okay because I'm all about the brisket.  So I got a couple of pounds because after all I do have to share with my husband.  I also got the coleslaw, potato salad and lemon chess pie. The sides are good, but the obvious star of the show here is the brisket.  The brisket is just brilliant; it's tender, moist and tastes amazing without sauce.

We were told it would be an hour and a half but it ended up being 2. This place was definitely popping and I can see why.\\n\\nWe all ordered the Chicken and Waffles. It's one of their signature dishes so it was a must, and when oh my goodness, when it came out we were all stunned. The portions are huge! 2 people could share one plate. I looked around to see what other people were eating as well, and all the portion sizes were ginormous. This place really knows how to serve their customers.\\n\\nThe chickens and waffles were so good! The waffle is made out of sweet potato and it was super fluffy with a light crunch. mmm! just thinking about it makes me want to go back. You get three huge fried chicken breasts on top with an orange slice for decor. The chicken was tender and moist. The seasoning was great ( not too salty) which was a bonus. \\n\\nOverall, this place is a must try! Their super busy so don't expect the best service.

Bartenderess was pleasant, but disconnected; she didn't seem to be all there.  \\n\\nThe food - once we were greeted, we started with a couple of margaritas. OK, but a bit too sweet for my tastes and not enough tequila (see first paragraph).  Salsa was yummy - smokey, rich and delicious. Chips, not so much.  They weren't bad, but they were all broken - the largest piece I had was maybe the size of a quarter. \\n\\nOrdered off the DARW menu and started with some really, really good calamari.

Then, I moved on to a chicken dish which was so-so - can't even remember what it was comprised of now other than some mashed potatoes (really?!?) and green salsa - not enough cheese, either.  Flavor wasn't bad, but it wasn't sensational, either.\\n\\nAfter eating more of the smashed chips and salsa, I was stuffed so I brought my flan home and it's calling my name from the refrigerator right now.

These were fairly standard but it's difficult to mess this up.\\n\\nThe Eggplant with Shrimp Paste ($6.50) was our first dim sum item here that contained shrimp. Looking back now, we actually wound up ordering a lot of shrimp dishes on this visit. Fortunately, they do a pretty good job with their shrimp.\\n\\nThe Chinese Donut Rice Roll ($7.25), however, wasn't my favourite. Sure, the rice roll was velvety soft but the Chinese donut on the inside was far from crisp... which is pretty much the most important textural component to this dish. For the price, this definitely wasn't worth it.\\n\\nThe next dish was something that I really wanted to try... the Lobster Dumplings ($6.75). The thing to know about this dish is that the lobster is only on the top of the dumplings. Underneath the lobster is a large helping of shrimp. Again, the shrimp was nice and bouncy with a snap to the bite, however, don't order this expecting the whole dumpling to be filled with lobster meat.\\n\\nIn keeping with our \\"shrimp adventure\\", we ordered the Steamed Bean Curd Rolls ($5.50) with a filling comprised of pork and shrimp.\\n\\nLastly, and we really should have rethought ordering this dish given all the shrimp we had at the table... the Shrimp Balls with Bean Curd Sheets ($6.75).

Example: landing in Japan at 5 am on March 11, 2011. This time for visit #4. By late that afternoon, we're looking for ANY flight out of the country - to anywhere. It would have been on an Aeroflot plane bound for Russia had we not needed visas. A digression though. Wandering around in the freezing weather trying to figure out what to do, we stopped into a narrow ramen shop, which we later figured out is a small chain throughout Japan called Hakata-Tenjin. Tonkotsu ramen, extra green onions. So delicious, so comforting, such a diversion from the chaos that was going on outside the restaurant. \\n\\n30 hours later, we were on a plane to Los Angeles. Sleep deprived, but damn, missing that tonkotsu ramen. And of course, feeling a sense of loss and sadness for such a beautiful country filled with beautiful and kind people. And amazing food.\\n\\nFrom then on, it was an all out search for decent tonkotsu ramen in the U.S. A place called Hide-Chan in NYC 'won out' as the best on our list. Another small place called Hashiguchi Jr. in Atlanta was decent, but has since closed. Even the touted Ippudo Ramen in NY didn't really \\"do it\\" for me. It was just ok. And in Texas? NO THANKS. I didn't think tonkotsu ramen existed here, especially in Austin. I tried Kome's ramen for lunch once. I think I described it as \\"acceptable\\" because I had to. There was no place else.\\n\\nI just cannot believe how GOOD Ramen Tatsu-ya's tonkotsu is. Don't even worry about the spicy bombs - get the original #1 with extra green onions and an extra egg if you're feeling hungry. The fact that this place is here in Austin is like a dream come true for me. It's THAT good. And the salt-and-pepper Japanese guy who might be part owner? founder? is quite cute and adorable and friendly!"},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Great meal  we had a spicy roll to start and my husband and I tried hamburgers!

The food is average for the price, but the service is abysmal. They assume everyone is a local and knows the menu fluently. They have a sign saying please wait to be seated, yet look at you like an alien when you wait to be seated. After waiting for a few minutes, an employee asked \\"Can I help you?\\" Yeah... Seat me maybe? I decided to come here a second time because the reviews are so good. Last time I was here was a year ago. Same story. The bar is tightly packed. If you're alone for your half hour wait to be served, your entertainment is cartoon network. They play only local music, which would be cool if you could hear it. This place is overcrowded and loud no matter when you go. Don't be fooled by all the good reviews from locals. They are cheap, small, probably store brand dogs with cool toppings for $3.50 each.

They were having some garage sale in the parking lot right next to us, which added to the ambience.  They don't sell drinks - you get them next door at the party store.\\n\\nThe pizza was tasty - not as good as the best wood-fired pizza Ive had, but up there with the best in the midwest.  My wife and I each had a different pizza, and both were good.  Some olive oil drizzled over top after they were cooked would've been nice.\\n\\nThe crepes are AWESOME.

First thing, the place was PACKED. We had to park 1/2 block away and walk. The wait to be seated was about 25 mins so we decided to go inside and have an adult beverage. Great selection of draft and cans. We get seated outside, man it was hot and order smoked wings and fried dill pickle chips. Both were amazing and awesome. The sauce on the wings is great, a little sweet with a little heat. Great taste and smoke flavor and hella juicy. The pickles were very good, the batter was light it needed a little salt. Next we tried the fried ribs......it was different. Not really anything special to be honest.  Just different. We got the large combo plate with ribs, brisket, pulled pork and chicken. The brisket was dry with just a hint of smoke, the pulled pork was also dry and a little over. The ribs were ok, good bite, no tug and I could barely taste the rub. The chicken was very juicy but the skin was rubbery and not crisp. I think maybe it was because they were so busy but the meat felt and tasted like it had been waiting to be served. Maybe the influx of business has affected the product.

The potato salad was pretty good, but you can get that anywhere.

Partially below ground, dark-moody lighting, full bar at the center. \\n\\nThe cocktails I tried were not very enjoyable, especially for $15. Not sure if it was an issue with execution or the recipe, but I definitely wouldn't order what I tried again. As an example, La Paloma was an over complicated an inferior version of a straightforward cocktail. It just didn't taste good. Serving it with a full-sized straw on a red wine glass was odd.\\n\\nThe pop-up kitchen idea is interesting.  The beef hummus plate tasted fine, but for a dish clearly meant to be shared, serving it with just two pieces of bread is bizarre. \\n\\nWhat was most disappointing about my visit though was the service. The wait staff was mostly friendly and efficient, but the restaurant must have some strange rules that I don't quite understand. I was with a group in one of the areas with couches and standing space. I went to the bar to ask for some water. The bar and the restaurant was mostly empty, and yet got some surprising sass from the bartender about how I should only order through the wait staff. Maybe you can't just walk up to the bar and order stuff from the bar in a bar . I don't know. Also, even though I originally came with a group, I was interested in getting a separate table for dinner. Asked the staff, apparently all the tables were reserved. I was in the bar for 3 hours or so and the restaurant remained 80% empty the whole time. Again, I don't know, maybe only some tables are actually open for dinner. Wasn't offered a spot at the bar or anything. \\n\\nOverall, Wink & Nod may cool, but I don't think the price, service, and food are worth it.

Their pork ribs however, were second to Oklahoma Joe's...to this date, I still haven't had better pork ribs. \\n\\nWe met a couple from Pittsburgh who were doing a BBQ tour around the US and they also agreed that Franklin was the best they've ever had.

Come Friday at noon, after 25 minutes in the heat, I make off with a pound of brisket and half a pound of pulled pork. Gotta say, the price was kinda steep, but I guess it's commiserate with its central Austin location. Some of the best barbecue in the world goes for less than $10 a pound...\\n\\nSo, the food. The pulled pork was fatty to the extreme, well seasoned, but I daresay it needed a bit of acid. I've reserved this to fry up later in its own juices, as in this state I'd rather leave as much stomach space for the brisket. Speaking of which, this is the best brisket in Austin, moist and tender, even the \\"lean\\" kind (suck it up and get fatty; you're missing the point with lean). The crust on the outside provides a pop of salty spiced goodness. Also got to give a nod to that coffee-flavored sauce. I'm keeping my to-go tin to barbecue some chicken later on.\\n\\nThis is the best barbecue in Austin, above Rudy's, Ruby's, Stubb's, and Green Mesquite. I think it equals the Salt Lick, but then, that isn't technically in Austin. Against the Hill Country legends, such as Kreuz, Snow's or Louie Mueller, Franklin's doesn't stand up; flavor doesn't permeate through the brisket as it does in those places, but then sometimes you just don't want to wake up at the crack of dawn to trek out. Franklin's is perfect for an introduction to Texas barbecue."},{"name":"ADios Cafe","address":"180 Walker St SW, Ste D","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Fantastic breakfast place!

There was garden porch seating when we were there (it's May 2nd) as well as bar and booth and table indoors. You can grab a cup of joe while you wait, just walk up and get one, or order your poison from the bartender. Lots of bloody mary's were tearing out of there, and few screwdrivers as well.\\n\\nAfter a mere 50 minute wait, and it was SO WORTH IT, we were seated at a table inside, and I was luckily facing the kitchen.

This is a fattsy talking, with lots of poundage of fried goodness from up and down the West Coast. I've got POUNDS of experience, and this is IT.

I was in town for business and it decided that I would try this place out for dinner. It was a Wednesday evening I arrived around 6 PM. Dining solo I sat at the bar. They seem to have about 12 different beers on tap and what looked to be 50 or 60 different brands of beer in bottles. They also have a full bar and wine list. I must admit after watching many different reality restaurant shows on TV I have become fond of places that concentrate on one type of food and do an excellent job at that particular taste. As the name indicates this place is centered on burgers and beer. They also have an assortment of appetizers, a listing of salads, a couple of different flavors of soup and some unique side items such as, \\"Duck Fat Fries\\" and \\"Mushroom Fries\\".\\n\\nIt was a three-way tie for me, I was either going for \\"THE OCEAN\\" which is a Butter broiled Mahi fillet or the \\"WILD THING\\", a 1/2 lb.Bison burger or lastly the \\"SURFIN' U.S.A\\" a 'burger' with Chilled Maine lobster salad. I asked my bartender Jamie which one he recommended and he suggested I get the \\"Wild Thing\\". On the menu this burger is listed as 1/2 lb.Bison burger, tomato jam, and bleu cheese, on a brioche bun. I was a little leery about the tomato jam but Jamie insisted that it was delicious and he did ask if I'd like it on the side but I went ahead and went with his suggestion. He also suggested the mushroom Fries so I tried those as well. The beer I chose was the Samuel Adams seasonal which was Oktoberfest. Happy hour is until 7 PM so my draft was only three dollars for the pint.\\n\\nWhile I waited for it to arrive I attempted to watch one of the four TVs located directly above the bar. Whatever was playing on SportsCenter looked interesting to me and I asked Jamie if he could turn on the close captioning. He informed me that their system had no ability to do that. This is a huge letdown for a place with so many HDTV's present and should be addressed immediately by the ownership.\\n\\nFor Wednesday night the place was doing a fairly decent business with an assortment of college kids, a few business people such as myself, and one or two couples rounding out the crowd. Jamie was behind the bar by himself and he was also handling all the bar side tables which to be honest was a bit much. Although he provided me with service that made me feel welcomed I could tell he was a little taxed with the amount of tables he had to handle as well as deal with the service bar aspect. I got the impression he'd be a great bartender to sit and chat with if he had a little bit more time.\\n\\nWhen my burger arrived I was pleasantly surprised with the presentation. True to the name the burger did indeed look like a half a pound which was great. The mushroom Fries turned out to be long strips of a super large portobello mushroom wrapped in some light batter and deep-fried. They were served up with a remoulade sauce that had a little bit of a bite to it but was quite good. I used a knife and cut my burger in half. When I picked it up I could see the layers of bleu cheese and tomato jam and a beautiful pink center. This burger looked to be cooked to perfection with a crispy outside and a pink inside just like I like it. When I took my first bite I'm certain that if someone was watching me they'd would have seen my eyes roll back in my head this was simply heavenly! The flavor was spot on. Even the bun was great soft and moist like they steamed it. I was pretty impressed and I really plowed through the first half without even putting it down it was so good. I was pretty full after I finish the burger and all but one of my mushroom Fries. I decided that I should try to settle for a few minutes and try something on the dessert menu. Have an assortment of mostly ice cream based desserts. I decided I would try the banana split. Although it is presented well and looks extremely huge I discovered that the majority of the large goblet it is served in was filled with whipped cream. The whipped cream itself is topped with a light stream of caramel and a maraschino cherry. It seemed like this dish contained one half of a banana. The ice cream that was used might have been freezer burned, as it had a peculiar taste. It was especially present in the strawberry which tasted extremely artificial and not very pleasing after the super wonderful burger and fries I just had. It was really a big disappointment. I didn't really have an opportunity to complain because of Jamie's busyness not that I would've done so since I was surrounded by other patrons but it really should be something that they pay attention to and perhaps give as much detail to the desserts as they do the burgers and fries. It is because of this I am going to reduce my rating by one category.\\n\\nNext time I visit I will probably skip the dessert, but I'll definitely be back the next time am in town"},{"name":"Flat Patties","address":"33 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Flat Patties has a solid burger!

However, we knew it was going to rain one day and really, who plans to spend the day at an amusement park knowing it's supposed to rain all day? We knew we wanted to see a dinner show and while my husband and I had seen this exact show at their Buena Park location in California, our daughters wanted to see this over the other shows in the area so we went ahead and booked it. Initially we'd planned to buy tickets through a military ticket office but when my husband called to inquire about the menu options, we found out they offer a military discount if you book through them so that's what we did. I went with the steak and shrimp upgrade, while my husband had the pot roast and our daughters both had the chicken nuggets with mac and cheese. As for the kid's meals, they weren't anything spectacular. I wish they had other options because if I remember correctly, the only upgrade option for kids was to upgrade from a kid's meal to an adult meal, and that would be entirely too much food for my kids. Anyway, I have to say that I was genuinely pleased with my meal. The steak was really good, especially for being at a dinner show. My husband was also very pleased with his meal. I'm pretty sure the group next to me kept gushing about how good the pot roast was so I can't say that I agree with other reviewers who negatively reviewed the food. The entertainment was just that, entertaining. My husband and I both were asked to participate.

Fortunately did not experience the super long lines mentioned by other reviewers.\\n\\nI had the #1 Tokatsu Original + spicy bomb. I tried some before I added the spicy and I found the broth to be very rich and flavorful and probably worth the trip by itself. With the spicy bomb, I got my spice fix but it didn't significantly add or detract to the quality of the dish. The noodles were a sort of al-dente chewy, I suppose they could have been a little chewier. The mushrooms were a bit rubbery for my taste which I think is normal for that type of mushroom but still tasted good. \\n\\nI will admit that the toppings are a bit sparse but what you do get is AMAZING. The half ajitama egg was very well flavored and just the right amount of gooey yolk. The pork was very \\"porky\\" and so tender you could cut it with your chopsticks.

The amount of liquor selection at their small bar was impressive. The atmosphere is bright and actually fits into its little industrial corner with the open warehouse feel and mix of metals. Service was attentive and friendly, pretty standard stuff there.\\n\\nThe food was generally great and plated beautifully. I'd pass on the escargot because I've had much tastier and less rubbery elsewhere. But, the beef tongue was unforgettable- tender but crispy and full of flavor. I grew up eating beef tongue and have had it at many fine dining establishments, but never like this. The cooking and seasoning of all the items I've tried has been great, but the menu a little limited and doesn't seem to change enough for my taste.

Ask Reichl or any food critic for that matter, the most authentic ethnic restaurants are not those high profiled along the Upper West Side, but are truly hidden gems, found in shopping centers, next to the DMV, or in the basement of a Chinatown grocery.

It's hard not to be redundant in terms of previous reviews, but this place is so good, I felt compelled to add my own to the mix.\\n\\nRamen Tatsu-Ya is as much an experience in culture as dining. Don't go expecting a quick fix like what one might receive at Pho places in the area...you'll wait in line. Standing. Crowded and crouched next to your party and complete strangers. And get comfy, the line isn't super fast...impatience is probably one of my most utterly unattractive qualities but this is worth it.\\n\\nWe came into the Ramen house and sampled nearly their whole rolodex of ramen offerings--- vegan, pork, ground pork, extra eggs, brussell sprouts...you name it. I'm told that, similar to pho joints, what distinguishes the fab from the faux is the broth...and Ramen TatsuYa's delivers. Intricate, rich with a hint of game and a punch of spice, RTY hits the mark. Perhaps the coolest thing about RTY's bowls of awesome is the mix of textures, food groups, flavors and spices and how they all come together to make a friggin' fab meal and there is no way in hell you'll leave hungry.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"So this is a continuation of my bbqq adventures in atlanta. Compared to lost mountain bbq (aka sam's bbq1) and fat matt's bbq, fox bros is the same price with (in my opinion) better food. OK, so this is what I had:\\nribs\\npulled pork\\nbeef brisket (chopped)\\nmac and cheese\\npotato salad\\njalapeno corn bread\\nbrisket chili\\nbrunswick stew\\nbanana pudding\\n\\nLets start with the meats. The ribs here are def the best I've had so far. The rub hey use on it has a kick to it that no other place has, and I had several bites where the meat lierally just fell right off the bone. omg im drooling just thinking about it. Anyway, so the ribs are juicy, tender, and very very well seasoned. More so than either Fat Matt's and BBQ1. Onto the pulled pork. Def leagues beyong Fat Matt's (which had the worst pulled pork out of these 3 by far). I'd say a bit better than BBQ. (my friend disagrees because he thinks the pulled pork is supposed to be bbq  sauci-fied before you get them) i like putting the sauce on them myself. WHAT CANNOT BE DISPUTED though, is that the pulled pork here is def juicier, and comes in bigger chunks, which i personally liked. So i guess its a tossup, leaning the way of fox bros. Onto the beef brisket. now I always get brisket whenever it is available, and i can say for sure here that the brisket here is better than bbq, it was juicy, fatty (which my friend also doesnt like *hes weird ok*\\" and when mixed with the bbq sause just awesome. I could eat a whole sandwich of it. Though next time i think ill get it sliced instead of chopped. it just seems more authentic. HOwever, it was definitely more moist than any other brisket ive had. \\n\\nOnto the sides. The mac and cheese here was good. Better than fat matts, mmmm I'd say its a toss up with BBQ 1, depending on which way you lean. at BBQ1 its creamier, here its a bit cheesier. So take your pick. The brisket chili was fantastic tho, with chunks of brisket floating around along with a smokey flavor. With brisket chili available, theres not even a point in getting the brunswick stew, not that its bad (in fact the brunswick stew here is pretty decent, with tons of veges and pork) but the brisket chili is just fantastic. The potato salad was potato salad (im not a big fan of potato salad in general) \\n\\nBut if your coming here, def get the jalapeno corn break. its spicy moist corn break, put some brisket chili on it and it could be a meal in itself (well not really since ur going to a bbq place to pig out). \\n\\nBUT the topping on the cake was def the banana pudding. Like one of my friends said, for this place to really be that much better than BBQ 1, it had to have a awesome banana pudding. AND IT DID. the pudding itself was thick, with TONS AND TONS of bananas along with a wafer crust on top and bottom. I didnt think i would have any better banana pudding than what i had at BBQ 1, but i was wrong. Not only was fox bro's banana pudding better, it was SIGNIFICANTLY better. \\n\\nSo because the cost is about the same, and in my opinion, the food was better, im giving fox bro's 5 stars. def worth the money. \\n\\nBTW, a full rack of ribs, a brisket plate and a pulled pork plate, = 6 sides, and 2 banana puddings = 14.10 a person w/o tip. pretty good deal in my book. So, if you live in atlanta, aka go to school here like me, def check out fox bros bbq."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"\\"i cant wait to fucking go home\\" is what the cashier said out loud immediately after the costumers in front of her moved away. she was probably having a really shitty day. then she kept on making all sorts of funny faces like, im really fucking annoyed to be here and i get it, sometimes life is harsh and i dont know this ladys story. maybe she owns the fucking place but all im saying is that customers should not have to deal with that. im not offended by profanity. i use profanity on my reviews but if you dont like it, you have the choice to stop reading and thats it. when your cashier is annoyed to be working, giving shitty attitude to all customers and on top of that i have to hear her say 'i cant wait to fucking ho home', well lady, please go home. youre ruining peoples meals. seriously. when it was my turn to order, i could tell she was not going to be pleasant to interact with. believe me lady, what a fucking drag. she asked me if i was gonna eat it there or take it to go to what i responded that i was going to try to eat it there cause i was really hungry but didnt know if i was going to find a spot to sit down as they were pretty busy. she gave me this blank stare and rolled her eyes at me like what the fuck. im hungry yo. why you judging me? then she asked me for my name (i really dont know why some biz do that. just give us numbers. really, its not like you care what my name is. just keeping it real) as i said jose. she again gave me a blank stare, pen on her hand, frozen, so i figured, i will spell it for her. she ripped the paper off and threw it away and said again \\"i cant wait to fucking go home\\".\\n\\nribs and sides were ABSOLUTELY delicious. live band was cool too. \\n\\nhope this lady finally fucking went home. smoke some weed lady. get another job where you dont have to deal with people like in a fucking lab or something."},{"name":"Rice Junkies","address":"3545 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"My partner and I used to eat here often, and the food is normally fantastic...

Fortunately, I don't have to worry about parking since it's walking-distance from my workplace.\\n\\nI've attended a Community Yelp Event and had several lunches with co-workers at Cypress, so I've been able to try several things on their menu.  Although I recently one of my favorite menu items, the beef brisket platter, is no longer served here, I've tried several of their burgers - the famous Sublime Burger, Cypress Burger, and Pickleback Burger.\\n\\n* Sublime Burger ($14) - It's been a few years since I tried this burger, a beef patty sandwiched between two glazed Sublime doughnuts and topped with cheddar, caramelized onions, and applewood bacon.  Although it sounds weird and is terrible for your arteries, it's actually delicious!  I recall splitting this burger with a friend, which I highly recommend doing if you want a taste but not a heart attack.  Definitely try this burger at least once!\\n\\n* Pickleback Burger ($12) - I'm normally not a fan of pickles, but the pickles in this particular burger are deep-fried.  All of the other toppings - Jameson whiskey glaze, pepper jack cheese, applewood bacon, and garlic mayo on a brioche bun - sounded too good to pass up.  I'm so glad I gave this burger a try!  I've had it twice now - in the past 2 weeks - and it's been cooked to the perfect medium-rare I requested both times.  While the burger patty is a bit bland/under-seasoned, the meat is juicy and the amazing toppings sort of make up for it.  It's a large burger served with a choice of one side.  I always get the fries and usually only eat half of the burger (and take the rest to-go) because it's a lot of food!\\n\\nWhile they charge you 50 cents for a tiny container of sauce, the BBQ is worth it!  It's delicious and perfect for dipping fries!  A server informed me that they charge for sauces since they're made in-house.\\n\\nI'm not a beer-drinker and haven't tried any of Cypress' cocktails, so I can't really comment on the adult beverages.  However, they don't have Coke Zero, my fave soda, so that's a bit of a bummer.\\n\\nOverall, Cypress Street Pint & Plate gets 4 stars for their tasty food, which is great for lunch or dinner.  Service has generally been fine, and food is served fairly quickly - even during weekday lunch.  If you are walking-distance or otherwise don't need to worry about looking for parking, I recommend you check out Cypress.  Unless you're a vegetarian or vegan, definitely try the Sublime Burger (share with someone!) and Pickleback Burger!"},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Came in on a Saturday night with a group of 10.

I ordered the steak and chicken fajitas and shared with my gf who ordered chicken enchiladas. Overall the food is probably 2 stars. Just your typical Mexican American. Nothing that really stood out.

We ordered poke, which usually comes in a marinated sauce, Hana provided the sauce in a container, however it was difficult to know which of the several sauces provided was for the poke.  The poke order was small in my opinion compared to price.\\n\\nI think overall it's OK, but may suffer from consistency issues.  \\n\\nCalifornia Roll was good, spicy tuna was as well, so for the 'staples' of sushi they are fine.  I ordered the Hamachi collar, and it was as good as I've ever tasted, so it may be the cooked entrees are more consistent.  \\n\\nThe take out was ready at the time promised, and the servers were friendly and efficient.

Almost never is food supposed to be gray, and everything we ate appeared with this pallor....even the veggies were gray!  Meat dishes were composed of bone and fat, the BBQ buns were cold on the inside, and my ever-favorite sweet sesame rolls were swimming in oil.  Did I mention everything was gray?  Let me tell you, gray meat is a disturbing sight to behold.  We were very mentally disturbed by what we forced down, and heavily considered purging for about 2 hours after leaving.\\n\\nWith that said, I've yet to be impressed with any dim sum in Boston.

This place is perfect. I have been three times now. Usually a vodka soda guy I went outside my realm and tried one of the specialty drinks, the julep. It is now my go to which is surprising as I was never much of a whiskey guy. The bartenders are on point as it is entertaining to watch them mix  up the different concoctions. They also serve \\"40's\\" of Colt 45 that I saw a few of the patrons ordering which I though was very trendy/different. For food I have ordered the duck wings every time and have not been disappointed. For an entr√©e I tried the short rib. It is top notch and the meat fell right off the bone. My girlfriend started with the Caesar salad and then went with the salmon for her entr√©e and said she will definitely be ordering both again. A lot of the people at the bar were ordering the small plates, all which looked delectable. Especially the French fries sampler as I am a sucker for sweet potato fries. More bars/restaurants should offer small plates especially at the bar itself.\\n      This is the type of place the garden/north end area has really needed for quite some time. It is a nice step up from your typical sports bar and Italian eatery. It is more upscale and attracts an older crowd that most bars in the area do not. The bar itself takes up the majority of the space as the large cushiony leather stools pull you right in when you walk through the doors. The atmosphere is vibrant with loud music playing and an upbeat crowd. The price point is higher than your typical garden area spot but I feel you are getting a much better quality here as it is worth the extra buck.

Boy, are we glad we did!\\n\\nWe did our due diligence and read that lines get long, so we hauled our behinds to Franklin's to start doing line by 6am. There were already 8 people in line before us, some awesome people, might we add. Making line waiting for the place to open is part of the experience. It is very indicative of the type of place Austin is - Everyone welcoming, having a good time, and just generally inviting.\\n\\nIt was awesome to see that they have folks selling beers and drinks as it nears time for store opening. Certainly a great way to start your Franklin' BBQ Adventure, while lounging in chairs with others, chopping it up. We thoroughly enjoyed our time in line, and it didn't appear to be that long, especially since we have a couple in front of us that were celebrating 50 years of marriage, and they were telling us stories of how life was when they first got married and how society has changed in that time. Highly interesting.\\n\\nOnce we made our way into the restaurant after they opened, we went HAM (literally).. We ordered 8 lbs of ribs, 8 lbs of that mouth watering tri tip, 5 links, and a pint of their potato salad.

We were promptly seated at a table in the bar area. So far so good.\\nOur server, one Andrew S. according to our receipt, arrived eventually and took our drink order. It was a long wait for the drinks, but it was busy, so everything was fine. When Andrew delivered the drinks we ordered several items from the Happy Hour menu, and the Wagyu hamburger from the regular menu.\\nEverything was generally fine up to this point, although we both noted an air of disinterest on the part of our server. I certainly didn't expect him to be our friend, but there were some rather long periods when we sat, waiting to get his attention, and his attitude when we did have his attention was peculiar. After we had finished off the last of our ordered food, we decided to finish it all off with an order of crab/shrimp cakes, again, off the regular menu. So we were heading towards $100 in all. No cheapy table, for certain.\\nWhen the cakes arrived, we each took one, and simultaneously took a bite. I immediately detected that ammonia-like stench of seafood gone south, and spit my bite into my napkin. I spoke up to stop my S.O. from eating hers, but it was too late. She'd swallowed it. I told her I was sure the cakes were bad, but she couldn't smell it. I tripled checked, and the crab/shrimp cakes definitely stunk. It was relatively subtle, but it was there.\\nI flagged down our server, and this is where it gets interesting. I told him, very politely, with no air of negativity or hostility, \\"These cakes have turned.\\" And then Andrew laughed at me, with a contemptuous smirk on his face!\\n\\"Which way?\\", he asked, still with the smirk. \\n\\"Bad\\", I said, a little taken aback by his attitude.\\n\\"I just served them to another table, and they Loved them\\", Andrew stated, apparently completely unconcerned about my issue.\\nI explained that I had quite a bit of experience with seafood (15 years cooking in some of Portland's finest restaurants - albeit quite a few years ago, and 45 years of cooking at home), and that the cakes were definitely spoiled. Still smirking, Andrew picked up the plate and walked away laughing, saying nothing further. No \\"Sorry\\", or \\"I'll go talk to the kitchen\\", just that same contemptuous smirk. A few moments later I saw him coming out of the kitchen, chuckling and smirking and shaking his head. And then he proceeded to ignore me, and refused to meet my eye as I tracked him around the restaurant. He passed by our table several times, still rather pointedly refusing to make eye contact with me. So we finished our drinks and waited for our ticket. Andrew finally came by to drop off our ticket.\\n\\"I took the cakes off your check\\", he said, addressing my S.O. and very purposefully refusing to look at or address me. He returned a while later, again refusing to meet my eye as I handed him our check and credit card. And when he came back with the credit card ticket, the same. He handed it to my S.O. and then, without a word, walked away.\\nWe were both shocked at his attitude and behavior. I was stunned, having never received that sort of treatment from a food service worker in my life. So after discussing the matter for a while, we left Andrew a $1.50 tip. I suggested $0, or perhaps $1 to make our point to Andrew, but my S.O. decided to make it $1.50 to round out the bill to a nice $65 (she likes to do that). Had Andrew not been such a shit, we would have ended up spending $80 on food and drinks and would have tipped him $15 or $20. In retrospect I should have insisted on $0.\\nAs we stood to leave, my S.O. crinkled her nose and said \\"Ewww!\\". At the same instant, I detected the very distinct stink of rotten seafood permeating the entire restaurant. \\"What is that Stink!?\\", asked my S.O. \\"Crab cakes\\", I replied. As we headed for the door, I stopped a different server and politely and quietly suggested he talk to the kitchen as they were serving spoiled seafood. He looked at me with a quizzical expression, and replied \\"OK, thanks\\". And we departed, with an agreement between us that we would never return.\\nI must stress that, other than the crab/shrimp cakes, all the food we had was decent. Not \\"Oh My Gawd\\" stellar, but good. The drinks were good. The space was interesting (although a bit loud). And we had been enjoying ourselves. But the freakishly contemptuous attitude and treatment we were served by our waiter was shocking, unprofessional, and inexcusable.

There was evidently a mixup with the table zones so after we were seated and given chips and salsa no one came by to take drink orders for 15 minutes. We finally flagged down a server (not ours) who was very helpful. When our own server arrived, he took our orders and was mostly absent for the rest of the night.

I didn't find the fish to be as fresh as it could've been.  I've had fresher takeout sushi elsewhere.  What really turned me off about the nigiri was that the cuts of sushi were huge...almost twice the size of the rice packed under it.  Presentation is a big part of sushi and bigger portions doesn't necessarily mean better.  I like creative maki every now and then but if maki is \\"too busy\\", ie lots of garnish etc...it takes away from the flavor of the most important ingredient, the fish itself.  I find that the crazy maki and the house maki were overly done, so to speak.  It's almost as if they were trying to hide the less-than-fresh seafood.  \\n\\nAs far as the accusations/suspicion of New Ginza's 1 star reviews, I'd be very surprised if that were true.

The falafel wasn't totally crispy and light. The pita provided a deep and inviting pocket slathered with creamy hummus, about 4-6 small falafel balls, and the works (pickles, cabbage, onions and parsley). \\n\\nThe hard part was the fact that this normally cheap eat was $7.95. That's crazy, especially for something that is no more than chickpeas and some salad bar. It tasted good and the falafel was definately better than Sharwma King's in the neighborhood but the top Falafel sandwich in my humble opinion belongs to Falafel King in Quincy.

Unfortunately, most nights that's later than I'd like and I'm not in the mood to go home and cook.  So I am often popping into one of the many places in Harvard or one of the other Cambridge/Somerville Squares for a bite to eat and a glass (or two) of wine (or a beer) at the bar (I refuse to eat at a table alone).\\n\\nHowever, every time I've popped into A&H it's been standing room only in and around the bar.  Not good if the plan is to have a drink AND eat ;-)\\n\\nOn this occasion I was going to a show a Club Passim at 7:00 on a Friday night so I made sure I arrived very close to 5:00 (when the doors open).  At that hour I was able to easily get a seat at the bar... but by 5:30 there were people already standing behind me (and every other seat) waiting for a place to open up.\\n\\nInterestingly, the bar tending staff at A&H consciously tries to manage bar seating on a first come first serve basis so that it's the person(s) who have been standing the longest who get the next seat -- not the person who just walked in and happens to be lucky enough to be near the seat that's just being vacated.  I'm sure it doesn't always work as planned, but I applaud them and mgmt.  for making the effort!\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nAnyway, now I know why everyone raves about this place...  I'm a flexitarian and the A&H menu had more than enough vegetarian items to explore so it was easy to eat vegetarian this night.  I had the Charred Broccoli with Squash Hummus and the Kale & Fennel Salad.  I was also served a complimentary small plate of pickled green beans.\\n\\nAll of the food was fresh, interestingly prepared, and just outstanding; as was the cocktail and the glass of wine (both of which were recommended by a very helpful bartender based on my description of what I like / normally drink).\\n\\n5-stars in my book!

My experience last night was largely better than my previous experience at brunch.\\n\\nFirst off, the food (a prix fixe menu for the garden party) was for the most part very good. One dish (a duck egg dish) was rather bland but the rest of the food was good. The pours for the wine pairing were a bit light but the selections were excellent. \\n\\nMy biggest problem was again the lack of foresight on the behalf of the kitchen staff regarding sharing. The way this event was set up was a family style service. However several dishes came out with a number of items that were not able to be shared equally among the group of 8 individuals (4 couples) at our table. For example one dish was served with some oysters however there were only 7 oysters...for 8 people. Another course were small smoked oyster buns. There were 12 of them at our table of 8. Some people were able to have seconds and others were not. It was a bit awkward at a table of strangers to decide who got the extra food. Portions should have been allocated in a way that they were divisible by the number of people at the table (and they certainly knew this in advance. It was a pre-ticketed event with two tables. One 4-top and one 8-top. It should have been easy to portion accordingly, but clearly it was not thought about by the kitchen staff. \\n\\nAnother small quibble was that for an event like this it would have been nice to have a dedicated server that had no other tables. There were times when the table needed something but she took a rather long time to return because she was working other tables in the restaurant not part of the event. \\n\\nUPDATE: the management at Alden and Harlow has reached out to me to apologize which I think is an excellent gesture.

Nope, this is where I go when I am having one of those days where everything sucks, and I just need a little bit of comfort from the past to ease the pangs of a bad day.   I say this because having spent a big chunk of my childhood in the deep south, Waffle House was the quintessential go to place for a good Sunday morning meal, or late night fare (especially after the bars are all closed).   This was the type of restaurant like in the TV show Alice, and Vic Tayback played the irritable cook \\"Mel\\", and you were always greeted by a huge smile from Flo, asking \\"what'll be sug?\\" then once your order was taken, she would turn around and shout at Mel as loud as she could (even knowing he was only 5 feet away) give me two chickens up, one pork, and a bowl of kiss my grits!.  \\n\\nThat is what this place is to me. This location, is one where I go for coffee and my usual fare of cheese scrambled eggs, sausage, grits, raisen toast and a piping hot cup of coffee.  This is also the place where I can still go to and between the cook \\"Nick\\" and his crew, they all know me and know what I am always going to order each time I come in and treat me like family.  \\n\\nIf you are  looking for fine food of top quality, then keep driven sugar because this isn't the place.  This is the place where the food is cheap, but the comfort and good feeling it can give is totally worth every penny.  I can tell you, even when I am on long road trips through the south land, Waffle House is my preferred stopping place for early morning breakfast and coffee, or just a late night pick me up to keep me going.  \\n\\nI believe that this is the main thing that has truly kept the Waffle House in business as long as it has over the years.

Our table of four ordered the beer cheese fondue, bobotie crepes, foie gras pancakes, curry crab, ostrich burger, ostrich bolognese, duck confit, and some other dishes I don't remember. \\n\\nThe beer cheese fondue was really good (4/5). It had a lot of depth and was served with an array of South African sausages, vegetables and perfectly stale bread. My only concern was that the vegetables were a bit undercooked. However, the fondue itself made up for it. \\n\\nI tried my boyfriends foie gras pancakes. They were savory and good. Each individual thing tasted good by itself but the combination of the two wasn't anything special. While interesting in theory, the taste wasn't as complex as foie gras is on its own. Foie gras pancakes (3/5)\\n\\nThe ostrich dishes: the bolognese was good (3.5/5) but the burger was superb (I'd give it a 5/5) The burger was perfectly cooked, served on a bed of crunchy arugula and wonderfully roasted cherry tomatoes. It was simple but done very well. \\n\\nMy curry crab dish was pretty good. The dish was cooked well and came with a ample amount of crab claws. The rice was covered in yellow curry sauce, but I wish there were a bit more sauce in the dish. (4/5)\\n\\nOut of all the dishes the BOBOTIE CREPES were the star of the show. At first, I was skeptical that they would just be like any old crepes but I ordered them because the waitress recommended them highly to us. And boy they were delicious! The inside of the crepe hosted a delicious stewed ground beef, and the crepe itself was soft and deliciously chewy. It was finished off with a creamy sauce and garnished with a handful of raisins. Everyone at the table practically fought over bites of it. They were extraordinary. If I were to return, I would definitely just order three of the bobotie crepe appetizers and as an entree.

It had been raining a LOT so I thought that might thin the herd a bit. Wrong. A Staff member told us how long we could expect to be waiting - 2 hours - alerted us all to the selection of chairs and umbrellas. Then, I suppose to gauge the inventory turn, tallied the orders of everyone in line. Later, snacks - chopped beef sandwiches - were provided. Yum. Someone else came by to ensure that we all were aware of just how long was the wait. Then the drink \\"cart\\" arrived, promptly at noon, as promised. Once inside, I discovered the next line, about which we had all been warned. Got to the counter within 2 hours, just as predicted. After ordering and swiftly receiving my order, took a seat - which was easy to find - and consumed the brisket. And sausage. And ribs. All excellent. Was checked On several times during the meal. Was thanked several times for my patronage, and the staff seemed to mean it. My guess is that staff has likely been told that fame is fleeting and you're only as good as your last review.

My favorite was the hoisin duck (because i'm a sucker for hoisin sauce); others favored the firecracker short rib (holy spicy batman).\\n\\nThe scallion pancakes were decent, the lettuce wraps phenomenally salty, but a good portion.\\n\\nThe vegetable lo mein was pretty much the only vegetable dish we could find on the menu so we ordered it, and it was surprisingly good!  Not smothered in sauce, not too salty.  Wish they had more veggie selections though.  Definitely don't go here if you're a vegetarian.  The black pepper shrimp was also good.\\n\\nI don't know where they get their fortune cookies from, but they're THE BEST FORTUNE COOKIE i've ever had.  \\"But a fortune cookie is a fortune cookie,\\" you say?  Absolutely not.  Try these.  They're amazing.\\n\\nOverall I'd say this place is decent.  It's a little off the beaten path with a nice atmosphere (though perhaps a bit overloaded on the generic asian stuff) and friendly staff.  I imagine, though, it might get a little loud/roudy when busy as they were pumping club style music the whole time we were there.  If you want chinese food but don't want hole in the wall grease and don't want to pay for the quality of Golden Temple, it's a perfectly good choice."},{"name":"Seasons & Regions Seafood Grill","address":"6660 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Except for parking space this was a wonderful place!

One is the meat.  It needs to be of good quality and not frozen.  Two is the bread and toppings.  They need to be fresh and of good selection and quality.  Third is the fries.  Anybody who uses frozen fries is out in my mind (That means you Bartley's)..\\n\\nAnyways, Flat Patties meets those needs on all counts.  The beef is fresh, they have a lot of different toppings, the bread is quite good, and the french fries are fresh cut and cooked.  A major surprise was the onion rings.  They use a tempura batter instead of the heaving breading most people use.  This makes them light a tasty.  They actually taste like a cooked onion instead of heavy breading.\\n\\nFlat Patties is as close to the mecca of flat top grilled burgers (in-n-out) that I can find on the east coast.\\n\\nPlus the pickles are dill instead of the sickly sweet ones most places supply."},{"name":"Casa Vacca Italian","address":"7800 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I have to say this place is amazing.

I had a \\"modified\\" Burner Burger -- juicy and tender freshly ground (no hormones or antibiotic) beef patty with American and Tillamook Medium cheddar cheeses, sauteed onions (instead of fried onion straws), flanks of roasted jalapeno and shredded lettuce on a bacon brioche bun (yes, bacon -- they were out of their regular brioche buns so the option was the bacon bun they make or store-bought regular buns ... the bacon flavor was slight so it didn't interfere with the other goings on). I left off the Srirancha (it's not a typo -- they make their own sauce with Sriracha) ... and added straight Sriracha. I loved the creaminess of the American cheese melded with the soft cheddar taste of Tillamook medium cheddar (which I grew up on). Perfect seasoning. Not too juicy (as was the burger at Wildwood (see that review)). Simply delightful and spicy. \\n\\nMy husband had the Foster Burger with cheddar cheese (also with the bacon brioche bun). He thought it was very good but it didn't wow him the way mine did ... mine, of course, had the sauteed onions, roasted jalapenos and American cheese added ... \\n\\nWe ordered the fries crispy and they came that way ... and, were fantastic. Hand cut, fresh potatoes. They come with ketchup and mustard from a bottle, but you can ask for 1,000 island (which I think is their Foster sauce) or the Srirancha for dipping. \\n\\nWe were there around 11:30 am on a Sunday and I was amazed at how many children there were ... they even have a \\"mini-Foster\\" and they serve drinks for children in these little sippy-type plastic cups with a lid ... so, very kid friendly. It was also Portland marathon weekend (which is why they probably ran out of regular brioche buns) and there were quite a few finishers coming in as we were leaving ... if were dumb enough to run a marathon, Foster Burger would be high on my list of next stops (when I was dumb enough to complete the Tour de Tucson (110 miles of cycling in one day) last year, the first stop for me (in a car) was In-N-Out so as to avoid the certain onset of a steep blood sugar crash and the attendant bad attitude.\\n\\nThey have outdoor seating, and an indoor restaurant and bar area (no kids allowed at the bar). They also have a hour menu which runs from 3 -5:30 pm Monday through Friday. \\n\\nI can certainly see why Bon Appetit listed it last year as one of the top 10 new burger joints in the country. We will certainly be back. \\n\\nWondering why not 5 stars? They serve RC cola ... huh? (but they did have some good root beer.) And, I'm just not certain it's the absolute best burger I've had.

I highly reccomend trying fries with gravy which may be unfamiliar to people overall in the northwest. \\n\\nAlso had the Kiwi burger (lamb!) which I was eager to try because I love lamb burgers, a more earthy taste than an average beef patty ...and this was topped with yummy pickles, a fried egg, and aged cheddar. Win! Also had pickled beets, which my Dearest love wasn't quite sure about...so got them on the side. He didn't like them but I put them on my half and they evened out the sharpness of the cheese. A very solid burger.\\n\\nAlso they have happy hour. Which means I will be back.

We started with the praline bacon, which let's be real, was one of the best things I've ever eaten in MY LIFE. Lucious praline and thickly cut, and not overwhelmingly sweet. My husband had the Chicken and Waffles, which was perfectly breaded and had an excellent flavor. I enjoyed the Blueberry Lemon Curd Buttermilk Pancakes, which had a nice sharp flavor contrasted by the sweetness of the berries, but probably my least favorite out of the three. \\n\\nThere is a reason this place has a reputation and long wait times on the weekends - it's freaking delicious!

I love the way the restaurant itself is on the second floor. It's like a little adventure traveling up the stairs and getting to design your own fish on the digital aquarium.  I love how I suddenly have an urge for sushi after swearing off it for most of my life because of this place. Also, they have so many options for people with different tastes. There are rolls for the experienced sushi eaters, rolls for people who are still being introduced to this type of cuisine, and there are so many other things on the menu for people who don't even like seafood! Burgers and sushi? There's no better combo! I also love the kitsch, kitsch, and more kitsch decor including the live cowfish swimming in his noodle fish bowl and the Japanese to English translations over the intercom in the restroom.

They put two long tables down the room and allowed us to use our own music and the projector/screen. All of our guests were from out of town, so we wanted to show off a little bit of Austin, TX to them.\\n\\nThe food was absolutely perfect. The service was top notch. They tweaked the menu that they offered to suite our needs, and everyone was quite entertained with the selection of wild game and other unique offerings. They even made special dishes just for the kids (and I have to say, the chicken strips were lookin' good even from the adults eyes!)\\n\\nWe worked with Haley Dawson to book this party, and she was extremely professional and quick to respond. She was very easy to work with and I highly recommend asking for her to help host your next event! It was only our 2nd time dining at Lonesome Dove. The first time was a couple weeks prior during our vetting process to find the perfect location... we had a server named Ryan who mentioned he was recently engaged.

When asked \\"What is the best seafood restaurant in Portland?\\", Jake's Famous Crawfish is mentioned more than once.  Not just in Portland, either.  Some say this could possibly be the \\"best seafood restaurant on the West Coast.\\"  Now, I don't think I can make that claim simply because I haven't eaten at nearly enough seafood resetaurants on the West Coast yet.  But damnit, this place is freakin' awesome so it gets my vote for now.  \\n\\nAs you can see from the pictures, Jake's doesn't look like much from the outside.  In fact, if you walk through the wrong entrance like I did on a Friday night, you'll be surrounded by people at their bar, which was PACKED by 5:30pm.  Luckily, one of their staff saw that I was looking around for a place to sit and asked me if I was there for the restaurant.  I nodded anxiously and he led me to a table.  The restaurant wasn't nearly as busy as the bar, but then again, it was 5:30pm.  The only other people in here eating at that time were senoir citizens.  lol.  \\n\\nOn to the more interesting stuff - what we ordered:  I started with a cup of the Crab Bisque ($8), which was amazing.  Creamy, rich bisque topped with a very good portion of fresh lump crabmeat.  Oh god, yes.  I would definitely order this as a starter every time.  My wife ordered the Valentine's Day Special ($30), which came with a House Salad with walnuts to start.  She liked it a lot, although she said there were way too many nuts in her salad.  *snickering*  We also ordered a half-dozen of the Fanny Bay oysters - which are smaller in size than some of the other oysters, but they have a very sweet taste and when fresh, are among some of the best oysters you can have.  And these were very fresh.  Delicious.  Even my wife, who usually looks at raw oysters with some kind of a hesistancy, downed her share happily. \\"We should've ordered more!\\", she would go on to exclaim.   For the main course, her Valentines Day Special came with a 7oz. top sirloin, which isn't the most tender cut of me, but she ordered it rare so it was just tender enough.  Served with seasoned butter on top, it was excellent.  It also came with half of a stuffed lobster, which was also delicious.  Served on the side were mashed potatoes and asparagus.  For MY main entree, I ordered the Whole Dungeness Crab ($33), served hot and with drawn butter.  Ooooo good.  Crab was fresh and very well cleaned.  I'll admit, I looked pretty ridiculous with my bib, but thankfully it saved my shirt because I tore into that crab like it was my last meal.   As I continued to clean the crab out, my wife got the last part of her VDay meal: a chocolate pudding with whipped cream.  It was good, don't get me wrong, but neither of us really had any room left for it.  Haha.   \\n\\nService was excellent.  Our server was super-friendly and answered all of our questions knowledgably.  Our drinks never went empty and despite the restaurant being packed at about 6:30pm, she was always around.   Oh that reminds me, unless you come in really early like we did, I'd recommend making reservations on the weekend because it did get extremely busy and by the time we left at 7:30pm, there were a lot of people waiting.  \\n\\nOverall, a 5-star experience.  The interior was from another era and lent a very cozy and relaxed atmosphere.   Parking can be difficult to find, but again, we were there early and found a metered spot directly across the street.  Prices are not too high - especially considering the grade of food you get here.   The only question I had was about the name of the restaurant.  I didn't even see any crawfish on the menu.  Hmmm..

This is a default because whenever the boyfriend and I are hungry, we know we will be seated and fed quickly. \\n\\nIn the winter and on colder days they have a great roaring fireplace in the back left corner of the restaurant. It is great for some downtime (pre-dinner) with a winter ale and a good friend. \\n\\nThings I don't like:\\n\\nHuge groups of families and birthday party groups love coming here which, for a date night, can be annoying. It is a pet peeve of mine but the fact that Christopher's is great for groups means that some nights you get the younger children screaming and running around while you are trying to ask your significant other how his or her day was. It can get pretty loud which is a little frustrating but on no fault of the restaurant for being group friendly."},{"name":"Foster Burger","address":"5339 Se Foster Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This place has pretty good burgers.

Both exhibited poor preparation, earnest effort to impress, and profound failures in execution. Where to start?\\n\\nSo we showed up around 2pm on a Sunday; they promptly informed us that they were out of everything Bluefish (2 of the entree options) and the Secret Burger, which is apparently their flagship dish. So secret, that we never got to find out what it even looked like. The manzanella appetizer was easily split between 4 hungry men, very good portions and the standout for the meal. The halloumi added great texture and flavor balance to the plate which had a very tart finish to it. Three of us got the oxtail melt because...we didn't have many other options. One of us got the ham sandwich. They forgot his side of chips and he had to ask for them to be brought over in the middle of his meal. Also they brought his sandwich out about 8 minutes after the oxtail which meant Dave had to watch us eat which I'm sure he took copious notes on. The oxtail melt....confused us. It was cold, and so was the cheese. Quite strange for a \\"melt\\" based sandwich. Upon further inquiry it appeared that the kitchen closed shortly after we sat down which made me believe it was a rush job to get the food out. Also it was a bit on the smaller side but still very filling. The side chips were standard, nothing to write home about. Overall the food warranted this place a 2 star review but the service saved one star for me.\\n\\nService was quite good, water glasses were filled almost instantly and we were checked up on frequently. Very large dining availability with a large bar area where a full menu is served means it has good availability for patrons.\\n\\nBetween the lack of food availability, and poor food preparation I don't think I will be returning here.

Half of it is a bar set up and the other half is dining. Most of it is communal seating and then there are some two tops along the wall. There's a booth along the back wall. The chandeliers are interesting and provide enough light for an intimate setting. The music is a little bizarre when you can hear it. Due to the small size of the establishment, it's a bit difficult to really hear who you may be dining with.\\n\\nAs far as the food goes, it's really solid. The appetizer round was the beer cheese fondue. It comes with sliced green apple and grilled pretzel bread. I wish there were more of the dippers and maybe even more of a variety? That said, the cheese is VERY tasty. I broke one of my general rules and ordered the spaghetti. It comes with one large meatball. The meatball is PRETTY awesome. It's very tender, flavorful, and stuffed AND topped with mozzarella. The pasta is cooked well. Unfortunately, I wasn't really struck by the sauce. It's very simple and light and lacking in flavor. That said, it's still a nice dish. I was able to sample some of the \\"Silence of the Lamb\\" burger and it was quite good. The lamb burger was cooked through and the feta really offset the strong gamey flavor of the meat. The meat to bun ratio is really spot on and you really get to taste the flavor of each component. The chickpea fries on the side were interesting. It's kind of like they made little fritters out of hummus. They're paired with tzatziki and would make for a really great appetizer on their own. For dessert, we ordered the joey bag of doughnuts. It's nothing surprising, but it's good. It's just a little paper bag of beignet pieces and salted caramel dipping sauce. I found myself wanting more of them after it was over, but after the appetizer and entr√©e, it really is a good portion for sharing.\\n\\nOur server was attentive and it seemed like the entire staff was on point with the various parties in house. \\n\\nOne thing that did stand out to me, for I am a man of simple pleasures, was the iced tea. It's your normal everyday black tea, but they blend in cinnamon and star anise seed. UH. WHAT? GAME CHANGER. Delicious. And if your server is as great as ours was, your glass will be full the entire time. And she'll be sufficiently amused when you dance in excitement as she returns with more.\\n\\nI'd definitely go back to Porter, and likely will as I have a lot of friends who live in the vicinity, but again, I'll be curious to see menu changes as they grow and find out who they want to be.

Pasta carbonara entree was solid, but everything else was okay to poor. Calamari was all rings with a decent batter, but no sauce and a pile of plain arugula on the side. Very bland. Veal with pappardelle special in porcini mushroom sauce tasted little of mushroom, especially something as flavorful as porcini. Pasta was good, but overall very disappointing for $27. Veal Milanese was a decent sized piece of breaded veal with a spoonful of sauce on it with a bunch of arugula and four grape tomato halves thrown on top of that. Really? Spaghetti and meatballs was another mixed result. Meatballs were good, but sauce lacked depth and was too salty.\\n\\nIf it was 2/3 the price we would go back, but topping out over $100 for 4 before drinks or tax for a mediocre meal means we'll never go back to try the pizza or crepes."},{"name":"The Mighty Cone","address":"1720 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Pretty good all around.

But that's what we found.\\n\\nThere was a bit of debate on whether we would wait or go to Casa Del Matador which we could see just down the street, but decided to wait instead.  A wise decision, it turns out, as although we were told a table for 2 would take a half hour, within five minutes we were seated and had menus in front of us.\\n\\nThe menu isn't huge, but it encompasses a lot of tastes.  I can honestly say, this is one of the few times I was truly torn about what to order.  Generally, one thing stands out as a must-have in a particular genre of food, or one side, but I was over-whelmed with the choices that all looked amazing.\\n\\nFried chicken, thin-sliced fried pork chops, grits, macaroni and cheese, corn-bread, brisket, pulled pork, hush puppies, etc. etc., the list goes on and on.\\n\\nWe got an order of hush puppies with a side of pepper jelly to start and, I warn others, as tempting as it is and as delicious as they look, do not put an entire hush puppy in your mouth as soon as they arrive.  They are very hot.  I did this and even though it was worth it, as the hush puppies were amazing, I probably should have taken a smaller initial portion.\\n\\nMy date had the brisket and as much as I wanted grits and corn bread, I decided that due to it being dinner, I would get the pulled pork sandwich.\\n\\nWe both had a different microbrew and they were quite good.  I know hers was called Turbodog and mine was an amber, of whose name I sadly forget, but it was enjoyable nonetheless.\\n\\nWhen our food arrived, the portions were really pretty huge.  My friend started to use a knife on her brisket, but it was so well cooked and tender that it fell apart with the fork and she had no need for the knife.  My sandwich was also stuffed full of pork with a delicious sauce.  The fries, however, were rather pedestrian, but I didn't mind so much as they were more a means of sweeping up dropped bits of pork and sauce.\\n\\nWith tip, our meal came out to be about 50 bucks, which is not bad at all for downtown Portland, the size of the portions, and the quality of the meal.  The noise level was -very- loud, though, so this is not an intimate romantic location.  We did not opt for desert and decided to leave without loitering as, even though we couldn't see the front door, I didn't want to hog a table if people were waiting.  All of the tables I could see were still full, and it was now after 8 o'clock, and sure enough, as we walked out, there was a large mass of people waiting to eat.\\n\\nThis would be a great place to bring a lot of family and friends, for a raucous good time.

Together my party sampled a bit of everything and all was fresh, including the sushi. They also had a fresh pasta station with several options of pasta and sauces. P√£o de queijo (cheese bread) was brought to our table warm and it was delicious. We tried three different pastas and they were all good, though ultimately I'd save more room for other salad bar items and meat. \\n\\nSpeaking of meat this is where Black Fire let me down. Nothing was bad, but most of the meat did not live up to the standard I expect from a Brazilian steakhouse. Under seasoned and a few items were slightly overcooked.

Normally I don't mind this at all, but they don't have a menu posted. They have ONE menu laying on their counter, and the man working there just stared at us while we looked it over. My wife ordered an ibiza panini, and I ordered a lamb gyro. He asked if I wanted the lamb gyro platter, and I said sure, then picked my sides. I got their grape leaves and tabouli(sp) as sides. I ordered a drink, and my wife said she just wanted a cup for water. Apparently you pay for water cups, too, but that's fine I suppose. The total was $25, which after looking at the menu, did not add up at all. When he brought the food to us, my gyro was nowhere to be seen. Instead, there were 4-5 tiny pieces of dried lamb sitting on rice, with my sides next to them. I told him I ordered a lamb gyro, and he very rudely replied \\"NO, YOU ORDERED A PLATTER\\" I again told him that I ordered a gyro, and he says \\"oh, so you want some bread or something?\\" I told him not to worry about it. I took one bite of the lamb and it was bland and extremely dry. The grape leaves were flavorless, and the tabouli tasted EXACTLY like what they sell at publix.

When I first went to Kung Fu I thought it looked like any other \\"trendy\\" bar. \\n\\nTwice now I've been here, both times late at night and it's packed. So much so that there isn't any place to dance to the live DJ that's spinning. What's the point of blasting tunes if there isn't room to get your groove on? There also aren't that many games to play. Not enough to warrant going there on a weekend night to have a beer or two and win all your pal's quarters. The bar staff is Terrible with a capital T. There are no signs that I noticed telling you of their $10 minimum on credit cards. Surprise! You buy one beer and you're stuck paying the rest as a tip to the jerk who never mentioned their minimum in the first place. So bring cash unless you plan on buying the bar a round. With that said, beer prices are okay, not cheap but not going to break the bank, (except with that ridiculous minimum).\\n\\nAll in all just another W 6th bar, I look forward to seeing what moves in next."},{"name":"Porter Ale House & Gastropub","address":"3715 S 1st St, Ste A","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Great beer selection, ambience and friendly staff make this pub my new neighborhood destination.

For those of you that like being served, I suggest you do not go to the Dark Horse during happy hour because it is self serve for both food and drinks, meaning you have to go to the self-serve kitchen to order your food and go to the bar to order any drinks you may want.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I ordered 3 pounds of wings and a basket of curly french fries for only $18.98 (obviously the happy hour rate). The wings were pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary. My favorite part of the meal was the french fries to be completely honest, which were really yummy. \\n\\nThe ambiance of this place is pretty cool though, the name Dark Horse is fitting because when you step inside the lighting is very dim which may bother some but I find it to make the restaurant more intimate.

Originally they told us they were making up our table, but 20 minutes went by and we were still waiting. We were then told that there was a party at our table and they wouldn't leave, so we needed to wait for them to leave. Another 20 minutes went by. The party at \\"our table\\" left, and another party was seated there, not us. We were then told we were getting a different table, and another 20 minutes went by. Finally we were seated. The man who seated us thanked us for our patience, but no one ever apologized to us. The waitress was very friendly, but definitely nothing out of the ordinary. They added the tip in since there were so many of us, which normally I would be fine with, but after waiting an hour for our table with a reservation we were all a little frustrated with that.  One of my friends ordered an orange juice, which came half full. When she ordered a second one, it came a little more then half full. And she was charged for both. Everything was just very inconsistent. I will say, the food was great. The two stars I am giving is only for the food.

I was in the area because I had attended a screening at Atlantic Station and I knew they were doing the eat like an employee promotion, so I thought it would be a good time to go try it out. \\n\\nMy main problem was with my waiter because he kept disappearing. Normally I wouldn't care, but I had a 7 year old with me and it was getting close to bed time. I kept looking around for him to get to go boxes, drink refills etc., but he was never where I could see him. Then at the end of the meal, after I had already paid, I needed a box for my leftover half of pecan tart and I couldn't get his attention because he was standing behind the bar drinking wine, so I finally asked someone else walking by to box it for me. He also missed part of my order and didn't put in my cauliflower mac n cheese.\\n\\nAs for the food, it was very uneven. I had the pimento cheese dip, which wasn't as good as Watershed's, and was served with celery tops (literally an inch or less of leafless stem per stalk) and very tasty cornmeal crackers and fantastically crunchy sweet pickles. I also had the cornmeal crepe with BBQ, which was ok, but the sauce was just overwhelmingly sweet and some of the meat was tough. My dining companion had a tasty grilled cheese with very stale french fries and was charged for her soda, although I thought a drink was included with her meal. As mentioned previously, I had the pecan tart which was gooey and sticky with plenty of pecans, but served with ice cream that was full of ice crystals.\\n\\nWould I go back? Hard to say. I find it very annoying to have to pay to park at restaurants and the service and food I had wouldn't bring me back, but maybe I just ordered wrong and went on an off night.

Luling, Lexington, Lockhart, Taylor, to name a few. Unless it's horrible (which is rarely the case), I try to visit an eatery at least 3 times in order to get a real sense of the meal. I always order the same thing at each place I visit. I've had much better brisket, sausage, and ribs at other places. \\n\\nI visited Franklin's with the sole purpose of ordering the same items. The wait was ridiculous. I still can't understand why it takes so long. I've been to smaller places with long lines and the wait has never been this bad. Walk up to the counter, order, get food, move on. Why does that take so long?\\n\\nAs far as the food, the pork ribs were overcooked. The sausage was cooked nicely. The fatty brisket was EXTREMELY greasy. The cost? EXPENSIVE.\\n\\nIs Franklin's a place to try? Yes. It's an experience and the food is good. Is it the best? Hardly. I'm all for advocating great Texas bbq. We have a wonderful tradition that makes for some of the best food in the U.S. \\n\\nDefinitely try Franklin BBQ.

This is a peeve I have about many places, not just Bandini.\\n\\nLast night was the anomaly. I ordered with their easy online system and sent a confirmation email at 5:05 p.m. They say delivery usually takes about 45 minutes. In past experiences, it's been about that or faster.

The cocktails were good, we tried three different kinds. They don't exactly blow you away like some of the other cocktail bars in the area, but they're good. We had stopped in to grab a quick bite before a show at the Sinclair, and just wanted to try a bunch of things. After my bf had a conversation with the bartender about his favs, we ordered the cauliflower (to die for), the mussels (surprisingly de-shelled and piled up on one crostini - flavorful, but not what we were hoping for), the burger (amazing flavors with delicious homemade chips.

I must have tasted pretty much everything on the menu and can confidently say that the food is superb. \\n\\nFor my entree, I had the sauteed local trout with stone-grits and brussel sprouts in crawfish brown butter. It was so wonderful--the sides complimented the fish perfectly. The portion was also very large and filling. You can't underestimate the density of grits. Also, the dish was full of flavor--seafood, crawfish butter, the slight bitterness of brussel sprouts, etc. \\n\\nI also sampled the meatloaf, the special fried chicken (with collard greens!), the buttermilk fried chicken, the shrimp & scallops in grits and the crab hash. The meatloaf was very good. On the portion side it was a little small, but it was bursting with flavor and the meat was juicy (not dry). Both fried chicken entrees were delicious and the portions were enormous. The shrimp and scallops tasted similar to my trout entree (very good), but it was small on the portion side. The crab hash was an interesting entree--not something I personally would order as the potatoes, poached eggs and chive hollandaise has too much of a \\"brunch\\" feel to it, but it was good nonetheless. The ingredients definitely worked together well.\\n\\nThe last entree I tried was the cider & chile braised pork shanks. Now this dish is in complete overdrive--the portion is ENORMOUS. My friend, who has quite the large appetite, was unable to finish it. The meat was absolutely tender and falling off the bones however. It was very, very good. My only gripe about this dish is that some parts were so salty (the Benton's bacon and the green tomato \\"chow chow\\")  that it was simply overwhelming. If you're patient and meticulous enough, you could arrange each bite with a little bit of each component on the plate for a more balanced flavor. However if that's not your thing, some bites can be offensively salty. There's a lot going on in this dish, but the tender pork shanks are so good as a standalone that I'd order this entree anyway.\\n\\nThe ambiance here is certainly social and bustling. It was a bit on the overly loud side. However, the crowd is great as is the wait staff. It's very chic and lively. Overall, a wonderful place to have a big dinner or a fun date.

We were actually able to make a last minute reservation on a Saturday evening. The restaurant is very large so we probably could have gotten a table with a short wait but I would recommend a Rez if you don't want to wait as there was a line outside. We started out at the bar as we arrived early and got lucky when 2 seats opened up.  Bartender was lovely and very helpful in assisting with some of their specialty drinks. I am a wine drinker but decided to try the mule for a change of pace.  It was a bit more fruity than ones I have had in the past but nice. We were seated promptly  at 8:30 which was refreshing as most busy restaurants keep you waiting for some time past your reservation. My least favorite part of the restaurant was actually the table itself. We were seated in one of the many wooden booths, which was really uncomfortable.  It actually marred the experience. So if you do go, request a table and not a booth! On to the food...we tried the roasted beet salad, crab cakes and 2 separate entrees. The salad was strange. The beets, cucumber and picked onions were all sliced on a plate.  Zero appeal. The taste was okay...bland and uninteresting. Wouldn't order it again. The crab and shrimp cake was good. Again, nothing to write home about but good. I had the cedar plank salmon for an entree which was good. It arrived boiling hot; so much so that I actually had to wait for it to cool off to eat it. Odd for salmon. It was served with an uninteresting side of mashed potatoes and carrots and green beans. I will say that the salmon in the Northwest is delicious. It's a much milder fish than we know here in the south and never disappoints. My husband tried the cod stuffed with shrimp and said it was delicious. Came with the exact same mashed potatoes and veggies, which I found strange. \\n\\nAll in all, the food is not at all inventive but it's solid and fresh.

I've only been in Austin for two weeks, but I've already frequented Ramen Tatsu-Ya twice! First with my parents when they were helping me move in, and then once again when I introduced a fellow ramen-loving coworker to the restaurant. \\n\\nThe first time, we went on a Saturday and we were met with a crazy wait!! The line moved fairly efficiently though, and their order at the bar and then be seated process is a well-oiled machine. This time, we ordered the Tonkotsu Original and Tsukemen. Admittedly, the Tsukemen is more of a dipping sauce than a broth, in that it's rather heavy unlike some other places I've had it. Because we were sharing, the Tsukemen was not overwhelming, but I can imagine that for lighter eaters, a meal of just the Tsukemen could be a bit much. However, the two ramens between the three of us ended up being perfect (the servings are a little larger), and we added a soft boiled egg so that we would all have one. Trust me and the other Yelp reviews -- THOSE EGGS ARE THE BOMB!! Soft, yolk perfectly yummy, a little sweet, ultimately delicious! The tonkotsu broth wasn't too heavy and it was a nice meal to end the day with. \\n\\nThe second time I went with a friend, I recommended her the Tonkotsu Original and ended up trying the 'Ol Skool myself. While the 'Ol Skool was good, I found it just a touch oily and next time will probably be returning to the Tonkotsu, as I probably just prefer the pork broth! My friend enjoyed her Tonkotsu order, and we've already made tentative plans to make many more returns over the rest of this summer!\\n\\nSummary: First timers, definitely try the Tonkotsu Original, Tsukemen is good for slightly more adventurous diners, and if you're into chicken broth over tonkotsu, do try the 'Ol Skool!"},{"name":"Fox Bros.

My boyfriend and I checked in with the host outside the building.  He was extremely pleasant, one of those people who make you smile just because they are who they are.  Anyways, he informed us it was a 30-40min wait and they would send out a text message when the table was ready, which was very convenient.\\n\\nDuring our wait we went upstairs to the outdoor bar, at Cowfish.  The smells weren't food friendly blowing through the location.  But the selection of cocktails, beer (domestic imported and IPAs) and wine was quite enticing.  I ordered Hokkaido Nights, a specialty cocktail, and it was amazing.  I would make that drink without the alcohol, freshly squeezed lemonade couldn't hold a candle to this drink. The drinks were a tad pricey too, no less than $10.\\n\\nWell finally when our text came through telling us our table was ready we rushed to front to be seated, the drinks made us even more hungry...So the a lovely lady walk us to this tiny little child's half table, I'm thinking I didn't just wait 40 minutes to feel confined. So she sat us at another table, two of those little tables pushed together, but hey it was better than one. On to the food.\\n\\nOur waiter, I believe his name was Mike, was wonderful and informative.  The menu was nice, not much variety at all with the sushi, mainly tempura shrimp, avocado and cream cheese with various fish laid on top.  There were some tuna rolls and classic simple rolls.  I love sushi so I'm a little critical.  The special rolls were 14+ and simple rolls 9+ which didn't seem too bad.  The burger menu portion was extravagant, a lot of options and at the bottom they listed all the toppings, cheeses, etc.  I like having options.  The burger-sushi infusion part was interesting but just made me want a burger and those rolls were 17+ sooo no.\\n\\nI ordered the boursin burger, I think I spelled that right, with an herb boursin cheese.  Except I requested cheddar instead.  My boyfriend order the Texas long horn burger and we got a firecracker roll.  I got water, while he got sweet tea.  I'm southern, born and raised in Florida, so I love my sweet tea, but this was diabetes tea.  He could barely get that one glass down, we figured it could've been at the bottom so we got another glass n another water for him.  Sure enough this glass was just as sweet. So we gave up on the sweet tea. \\n\\n20+ minutes later our food finally arrived.  The sushi was good, a little fishy.  The fish on top was almost as thick as the rice and it covered from one side to the other and just the top.  The burgers were big and looked amazing.  My burger had a weird taste, like they had accidentally put the wrong cheese on then scrapped it off.  The apple wood bacon was definitely a miss, not crispy and tasted funky.  I had to take mine off and I love bacon.  The long horn burger was great according to my boyfriend but he disliked the bacon as well.  The fries were the tiny string fries that you have to eat 4 at once to resemble a regular fry, but they were tasty.  Overall it was good, nothing I would drive back down there for, but if I was already there I might go back.  That concluded my $60 meal for two minus the cocktails."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"1.)

I finally came to Austin and had the time to dedicate an entire morning to sit at Franklin BBQ. This is something I've always wanted to do but every time I go to Austin I have something else to do. Well this time I planned it. \\n\\nLet me start off by saying my obsession with BBQ and Aaron Franklin (well more of a fan not obsessed.lol). I bought his book and it inspired me to start learning how to BBQ using real wood only and using a side by side stick burner. I've taken my BBQ obsession and have been pushing myself to make the best BBQ that I can do. Each time is better but I know I can get even better!  \\n\\nSo visiting Franklins was a must do. Well we came on Easter Sunday..thought most people would be at church, then again I met many people that probably thought the same thing. I got my place in line at 0810 and I was probably 50-75 people down!!!  Determined to make it through my buddy went for a taco run, I went for a coffee run on the property, we had chairs, board games, water and beer. Oh yea my Franklin BBQ book too!\\n\\nGot super lucky I spotted Mr Franklin himself. I went inside to talk to hi, and he was super nice and even signed my book and too, a photo with me. We even had a chat about my new BBQ that he inspired me and what wood I use in AZ. Totally made my day. \\n\\nNow for the bad part...we finally ate at 1:15, so yep count 5 hours in line!! Wow....but was it worth it??? Yes! The brisket and pork ribs were best I've ever had. I was sad that they ran out of turkey, and pulled pork was about average and sausage was good. But for the experience the fatty brisket just melted in my mouth! Amazing. Also the ribs were suck the meat off. Very good and very tasty!\\n\\nOk I have to admit I'll never wait 5 hours for anything ever again...but I'm glad I did this one time. I feel like I have a goal with my own BBQ to taste the gold standard and for me to keep working on. And after our meal I was given a tour of the smokers and got a full run down on their cycles and wood. So overall my experience was like Disneyland for BBQ fans.

The thing that kept me coming back was the Whipped Sweet Potatoes with Pecans. If you go to Red Lobster and the entree you order lets you pick 2 sides, get double sweet potatoes and ask for a spoon so you can scrape out all of it from the bowls. They are the best I've ever eaten and are so good and tasty and rich, it feels like eating a dessert! They put a dollop of what must be real butter right in the center to start melting before it gets to the table and it's just the right amount when you stir it in. The texture is perfect -they are creamy with no stringy bits and delicious. The first night, I wanted to try the Mediterranean Shrimp, but didn't want to pay for the Endless Shrimp in order to do so, but the waiter just charged me for the Garlic-Grilled Shrimp entree and I was so happy I got to try the Mediterranean kind because they were delicious and tasty and the sauce was delicious mixed into the bed of Rice Pilaf (second best side) which was under the skewers of shrimp. Just note that they do leave the tails on, so you do have to get those off yourself, but I found them to be better than the 4 dinky, tough Scallops I ordered the second night or even the Rock Lobster tail which I ordered the third night. The Lobster was tasty because of the wood-grilled technique used, but was slightly dry from being overcooked.

This is the real deal! After eating some amazing ramen in San Fran a couple of years ago, I have literally craved the stuff and was so excited to see that a few places in Austin had finally begun serving ramen. But my excitement quickly turned to disappointment when I tried them and found their ramen to have flavorless broth, soggy noodles, and none of the right toppings to make them special. Until now that is. We tried coming here a few times but were scared off by the long lines. Tonight we decided to just hunker down and wait and I am so glad we did. The place itself is hip and cool, the beverage selection is extensive and original, and the gyoza are crispy delightful pillows of perfection with a tasty dipping sauce. But all of that pales in comparison to the ramen, which is the real show stopper. It is exactly what ramen should be - rich, deeply-flavored broth filled with goodies of various flavors and textures. I got the original and added nori, corn, and Brussels sprouts. Sheer perfection! The pork belly was crisply cooked so it held up well in the hot soup and tasted sweet and smoky, the Brussels sprouts were roasted to a lovely nuttiness, and the corn, mushrooms and scallions all added dimensions of flavor that made the whole bowl sing. Plus the noodles aren't the sad soggy kind like you used to eat in college, instead they are al dente and ideal for slurping. It comes in huge bowls and although I liked it so much I thought I'd want to keep eating it all night, it is surprisingly filling and one bowl is more than enough for a substantial and oh-so-satisfying meal. I'll definitely be back in line for more soon."},{"name":"The Greenery Creamery","address":"420 E Church St, Unit 112","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This is the best vegan ice cream in Orlando.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This has recently taken over as one my favorite BBQ restaurants in Atlanta.  I'm usually attracted to the smaller hole-in-the-wall joints, as I'm more about the food than the fluff.  I'm a big ribs guy, and previously, I thought Fatt Matt's had the best ribs in Atlanta until I attended the Atlanta Fall BBQ Festival last year (2009).  When I saw that Fox Bros took #1 in ribs, I decided to try them out.  I'm really glad I did.\\n\\nThey specialize in baby back ribs and use a dry rub, with a slight glazing of sauce.  They really are outstanding.  If you drive by in the morning, you can smell the smoker already.  All their meats have a deep smoked in flavor that only time and patience can deliver.\\n\\nI still like Fatt Matt's ribs, but I've had too many occasions there where I get a semi-ok batch that are too fatty.   Fox Bros' ribs are always consistent.  They don't \\"fall off the bone\\" but the bites come off very easy and clean without any struggle at all, if you know what I mean.  The meat is always tender and is truly a competition quality rib.\\n\\nThe choices of sides are amazing, so you can even bring in your wimpy vegetarian friends and they have enough choices.  Beans, brunswick stew, mac and cheese, greens, potato salad...they have it all.  They also serve a kick-ass beef brisket which is hard to find in Atlanta.\\n\\nWords of wisdom for the curious who have never eaten there:\\n\\n1. Order 2-3 combo meat plates and split them.   Beteween the meats and sides, you'll be full.  \\n2. Parking is atrocious.  Bring a small car, or car pool if you can.  If you get there after 7:00 pm, good luck.  Just know going in that parking is a struggle, sometimes you'll need to park on a side street.\\n3. Even when they are absolutelty packed, the most I've ever had to wait for a table was 20-25 minutes.   No problem, just grab a beer or drink and soak in the atmosphere while you wait.\\n4. You must try the ribs. Beef brisket is 2nd best meat.  Their pulled pork is just ok, in my opinion.  Chicken is pretty good too.\\n5. Order the tomminator appetizer.

Upon our arrival around noonish, there most certainly was a line wrapped around the building. We were greeted by the friendly staff who told us it would be a two our wait. With not much else to do in Austin, we decided to wait.....With very high expectations,  I might add. We each grabbed a chair from the pile of lounge chairs available for us and the rest of the crazy people willing to wait outside for great BBQ. The excitement was building as we learned that the chef had just won the James Beard award. So, I was willing to overlook the annoying flies that were pestering us during our wait. The minute we made our way through the door, my excitement turned to disappointment when I saw so many empty tables. A two hour wait to walk in and find empty tables. It didn't make sense until I noticed the one and only cashier at the counter ringing up each customer one at a time. Really???!!!!  Why??  No second or third cashier. No table service.  Wow!!! We stuck it out and made our way to the cashier. To our dismay, the side items were limited to slaw, potato salad and pinto beans. No fries and no garlic bread. Plain white bread right out of the bag. Where I come from, we like our fries and garlic bread. BBQ is not the same without it. I will say, yes, the brisket and ribs were absolutely delicious. Side items, not so much. The sauces on the table were more runny than saucy. Not too tasty either, which was fine because the meat was delicious without sauce. While the meat may be amazing, it is not worthy of waiting hours on in. Especially  when it is not necessary. The line outside is deceiving.

What a shame.  One of only a couple positives from my dining experience was the quaint location in Downtown Celebration.  The other was my somewhat knowledgeable and nice server.\\n\\nHostess experience: the worst.  We arrived with the restaurant half full.  No one was at the hostess stand and we looked around for someone to direct if we could just sit down.  Eventually the hostess showed up (looking like someone casually dining) and asked us how many.  \\"2\\"  It'll be a 10-minute wait.  \\"Ok\\".  Another couple walks in with the same question and answer.  But they got one additional question: \\"do you want to sit inside or outside?\\"  \\"Outside\\" they said.  15 minutes later the hostess comes back up to us and says \\"I'm going to seat you guys first\\" while the other couple waited near by.  \\"Inside or outside?\\" she asked.  \\"Outside please\\" we answered.  She peered out the window and said \\"oh.  We only have one table outside and it's reserved.  You'll have to eat inside\\".   So we sat inside.  She sat the couple that arrived outside on the patio immediately after she sat us.\\n\\nServer experience: nothing exceptional.  Probably worth noting that the appetizer I ordered came after my sushi was served.  My boyfriends soup came at the appropriate time.\\n\\nFood experience: it was generic sushi!  But can we talk about the menu. I wanted edamame, but strangely enough it was nowhere to be found. So we placed our order, and no sooner does the waitress walk away then I noticed a small card on the table notating four different $4 appetizers, including edamame.

A proper description wouldn't do this dish justice, so I must simply implore you to put it in your face. Adjectives: unexpected, experimental, extraordinary, simple, complex; where new and old worlds collide, and pumpkin is spaghetti. \\n\\nThe infamous secret burger: I suppose I shouldn't ruin the surprise with too much detail, but the 'fun cheese thing' I found entirely superfluous. Other than that, awesome burger, but that is all. \\n\\nQuick mention: I could've saved my appetite for other things than the Pickled Verrill Farm Corn Pancakes.\\n\\nTheir menu is constantly in flux, claiming a dedication to seasonality, although they obviously know which dishes are well received, and those seem to stay a constant of the options. Boiled down, this is a fun and adventurous place to eat. Some things will have staying power, and others deserve the soccer trophy in your basement from when you were 6 that the coach gave to everyone. \\n\\nTerribly hip ambiance and decorum. The front room booth amongst the plethora of living leafy greens cleanly draped below pretty brittle ceiling windows allowing you to peer up into the flickering lights of civilization and the spritely passing pedestrians of Brattle Street (peering down at you) could single handedly talk me out of a four month stint of seasonal depression.

From what I can tell, the place is mainly filled with older UBC faculty who are meeting for lunch. \\n\\nI ordered a parpadelle with braised veal and a shrimp chowder. The chowder was too soupy and didn't have the potato thickness I expected. It felt like they added in frozen shrimp after. The parpadelle, sauce wise was okay. The veal could have been braised much longer and much gentler.\\n\\nThe presentations were fairly nice and the service was moderately good. We didn't order wine but the winelist looked decent. \\n\\nThis place has lots of potential. If they opened it up for dinner then maybe they can transform the place. It has a lot of potential to be a showcase restaurant for the UBC farm and also a place for seafood because its right by the water.

Obviously, it's one of the most well known dining establishments in Columbus, but I think it's legacy has far surpassed the actual dining experience here. I'm more worried people from out of town will hear of the 'amazing-ness' of what is Dirty Frank's and then be extremely disappointed. I then realize it may be their fault to have such expectations for a hot dog joint. If you find yourself down here on a weekend night, just don't, unless you enjoy waiting over an hour. You can't even really grab a drink at the bar while you wait either, since it's so tightly packed (I'm pretty sure they wouldn't let us grab a drink to wait anyway). Well, if you really, really need to try this place, you can grab a drink next door at 16-Bit but make sure you're there when they call out your name, or you're out of luck.\\n\\nThe last time I was here was on an off night (Sunday), and we were seated immediately. I went with my favorite, the Slappy Pappy, as well as a Chicago dog and the Dog From Hell. I've been here enough to know I like these hot dogs, but other than the Slappy Pappy, they don't really leave me craving wanting more. Don't get me wrong; for the price you're paying, it's definitely good eats and very filling, but I wouldn't consider them the best dogs I've ever had.\\n\\nThe service here can be rough. This last time around the guy helping us was off on his phone half the time texting, and some other server had to cash us out. It's usually not like this during their prime hours, but then you run into just the whole chaos of a completely packed restaurant.\\n\\nMy advice if you really want Dirty Frank's is to check out their newer location on the West side. It's hardly busy, and you'll get to try all of their food without the craziness. If you want the chaos, then go to the one down on 4th.

What we've decided from several visits is that there are several things on the menu that are outstanding and a couple that are meh (in other words, don't waste stomach space on them).\\n\\nFirst off, the good news (and if you read other reviews, my thoughts shouldn't come as a shock). The falafel is the best I've had, certainly in the Boston area, and maybe ever. Each falafel ball is on the small side, but they are the perfect texture and spice. Throw in the hummus and a pita and you'll be a very happy camper. The pita is definitely the best pita I've ever come across.  It's thick, fluffy, warm and delicious.  If you've never had one from Rami's before, it's really hard to explain.  Just go try one.  \\n\\nNow the bad news -- the shwarma and salad. I'm a big time carnivore, so the first time we came to Rami's I got a falafel and shwarma plate. To put it lightly, the shwarma was disappointing. It was little bits of meat, reheated on the flat top and dripping with grease. I'm not even sure how they pulled it off. It didn't look or taste anything like anything I know to be shwarma. The salad that came on my falafel and shwarma plate was likewise disappointing. I wish I could remember what was on it, but it has already been shut out of my memory.\\n\\nSo why four stars overall?

The servers are dancing and signing and the table the dessert is delivered to has the time of their lives. \\n\\nWith our Yelp check in (yes, everyone at the table pulled out their phones for the discount), we got a free appetizer (with limitations) with any $30 purchase. All the drink goblets are $30+, so for every drink we ordered, we made sure to split the check in a way that allowed for a free app! The server was super nice and helped get us the hook up, although I'm not sure we were supposed to be able to use the discount that many times per table.\\n\\nMy sister and I shared a drink goblet (which I can no longer find on the menu, actually) which had vodka and rum and watermelon. It tasted borderline medicinal since there was way too much alcohol. However, our server definitely let us know that the alcohol on our drink is more premium than some of the other drink options. We tried our friend's raspberry watermelon mojito goblet which was much sweeter and easy to drink. \\n\\nIf you order a dessert with sparklers (cost extra), you can choose a song (as long as it's within their limited selection) and the servers will come out with the dessert and sparklers and sing and dance to your selection. It's a great time and honestly worth the additional cost. \\n\\nOverall, I would definitely recommend Sugar Factory for the right group of friends you have in your life. It's a good time and drinks are strong, but sugary. Reviews are bad here but I think you should come in not expecting much on fast service or high quality food."},{"name":"Sonsie","address":"327 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"For some reason, Sonsie only has so-so reviews.

We ordered the double medium cooked burger with grilled onions and bacon with a side of fries. I thought it was ridiculous that they charged $1.50 for grilled onions when it comes with onions. How hard could it be to slap the onions onto the grill while you grill the burger? but hell, I was hungry and wanted grilled onions. \\nWhat we got was double over cook bland burger with half grilled onions (other half was raw) and invisible bacon with a side of shorty fries. \\nWe called Foster back to verify if we placed the order correctly or not (mind you that we picked up the burger around 9pm so the place was not busy). The server sounded really nice but informed us that she couldn't find our order to verify it. So she said she'll assume that it was their mistake and offered that the next time we're in, she will not charge us for the bacon on our order. I was disappointed at the way it was handle.

The floors here were extremely dirty and the tables are so squished together. There was a whole hamburger bun and a cup of macaroni noodles on the floor under our table that had not been cleaned prior to us sitting down. It was pretty gross. After reading many of the yelp reviews (after the fact), it is clear the restaurant is not known for their cleanliness. The food was just ok.

Everyone's food came out except for mine....mine (a veggie flatbread) came out 15 minutes later after my family had finished eating their meals. The manager did comp it, but I was still very disappointed. It was soggy and kind of blah. Also the presentation of the drinks is SOO much better at the Chicago location, where they really make it all about the experience....that's why I was excited to bring my family here while we were on vacation. I think the Orlando location has a lot of work to do to step up their game to be on point like Chicago.

The Local Striped Bass was interesting, it was Asian-inspired, and had a hint of Asian fermented fish sauce. The Korean Beef Short Ribs was a bit overcooked, but it was still flavorful. The Shrimp Toast lacked shrimp and so it wasn't what we expected to be. The Blood Sausage was amazing (we would love to see it on the menu again). It reminded me of being around a campfire on a starry summer night. The desert charcuterie was fun and had everything we like about childhood.

Their mouths fell open and partially chewed food fell out and onto the table. I almost threw up. Then, rather than approaching the offender  and saying \\"hey, that's not cool\\" they began freaking out, craning their necks about to see if there was anything else that they might could find offense in. Did the bartender just say \\"Oy vey\\" even though he's not Jewish?  Did that white guy just say \\"word up, bro!\\"? I was afraid to get any of  Fox Bros fantastic sauce on my face for fear of these people (obviously not from around here, I might add) thinking that I was painting my face to mock Native Americans. I don't want to eat around stupid people any longer. Dear Fox Bros, since I will be spending more money at your establishment eating the best BBQ variety in ATL than these people who swear they will never be back for trivial non-food issues, would it be possible for you to set up a special, sterile dining area complete with paper suits and blinders for people who care more about controlling what people say and do around them than what's on the plate in front of them?

I noticed that when we walked in there were two booths already cleaned and ready to go. We had to wait 15 minutes for them to finally seat us in those seats.

Briny, velvety, smooth.  We immediately regretted not ordering a full dozen.  \\n\\nSmall Plates - Our server recommended 2 - 3 plates per person.  We chose the sunchokes, mushrooms with spinach, ribs, and fried chicken.  All were exquisitely executed.  Meat eaters absolutely must try the Fried Chicken.

Eventually she came around to refill, but that was the last time we saw her before she brought the check. The pizza itself was not bad. Better than Domino's or Gatti's but not what I had hoped for. The buffalo sauce was more vinegar than heat and it pretty much obscured the rest of the ingredients. After we ate and paid we stayed because they were having trivia night.

Eventually, they pressured us into ordering our beers - before we found our seats.\\n\\nFrom that point, they did a decent job of getting orders. All 100 of us got pizza to make things easier.

I adore the Davis square location. \\n\\nWe came here early afternoon on a weekend and it wasn't too crowded. We had a 30ish minute wait at the bar. We ordered the sausage flatbread at the bar. It was um, okay. It was really sweet. I guess my fault for not noticing that it has a sweet ingredient in the pizza. But even then, it felt more like a sweet pizza than savory so that was super disappointing. The dough was also okay- itself was kind of chewy. I don't think I would be ordering another flatbread from them again. \\n\\nWe played for 2 hours and I also got a sundae because bowling builds up an appetite! I got the brownie sundae and it was alright. The brownie itself was not exceptional at all. It would have been a totally different story if the brownie was warmed up and served with the ice cream. I love the mix of hot and cold!\\n\\nSo for 2 hours of bowling, shoe rentals, brownie sundae, one drink, taxes and tip, it came out to $100 (the pizza was paid for on the bar tab). I'm not sure $100 was well spent here. It's kind of expensive in my book.

Came here finally, after years of knowing about this place after picking my mother up from the airport and in need of food. Ever since the closing of 'Michigan' it has been a sad journey to find a good wonton noodle/congee shop in Richmond, taste buds vary but this is just ridiculous.... isn't Richmond, as the writers in the papers say, the crown jewel of Chinese food... well yet another one that has failed my expectations of nothing!\\n\\nOne of the things before even stepping foot in this place is the crazy poor parking situation in this plaza. Chinese drivers are bad enough (I am one of them by the way, yet not as bad as these clowns in this lot), but dealing with a narrow passage, spots on both sides of this plaza, and a number of restaurants and businesses vying for all these spots... well a mess is what you get! Finally after finding parking, and probably much cursing in your own brain, you walk into this restaurant. First thing you see on the door is the trusty Yelp sticker... ok... maybe safe? Then you see the sign at the cash register... 'Cash Only'.. you have been warned! We were sat at a table right in the middle of the restaurant and quickly given two menus. We quickly placed an order of a bowl of egg noodles with wonton and beef brisket and another bowl of spicy pork mixed with noodle and soup on the side.\\n\\nDuring this time, 4:30 PM on Saturday, I noticed many tables having full on meals, multiple plates, just feasting away, it looked promising, and also made me a little bit more hungry. Our food eventually arrived, piping hot from the kitchen with the steam rising from the bowls. We were already given smaller bowls so we can share, without asking..... a really nice touch. I quickly started eating mine first, I was not really impressed as this dish as the spicy pork mixed noodles (ÁÇ∏ÈÖ±ÔøΩ? are usually a hit or miss and no place makes this thing the same... no one! The pork was fine, but the sauce was less to be desired! I eventually helped my mom finish her bowl of noodles, the wonton's were big, firm, not bad, the beef brisket I found a little too fatty for my taste.\\n\\nThe food sleepiness did kick in after the whole meal while driving home which means that the MSG kicked in.

The eggs were cooked perfectly, a soft poach, which is what you want on any Benedict dish. The Hollandaise sauce was good, and it was just the right amount so that it doesn't overpower the dish or make the underlying English muffin go soggy.

My milkshake was super liquidy.. diarrhea-like.. but the flavor was great, tasted just like funfetti cake. The burger was pretty average..

I also appreciate that they serve the Mars Bar Toastie (a deep-fried Mars bar on a Belgian waffle with whipped cream, bananas and strawberries) , even though I may never order it.\\n\\nI was kind of boring and ordered variations on the same thing in my two visits last week. For lunch, I got the Proscuitto, Fig jam, and Gorgonzola sandwich. Oh em gee...SO good. It could have used a wee bit more fig jam, but it was lovely. Just delicious. The greens I ordered (and paid $2 extra for) on the side was disappointing. I'm not a fan of pepper or arugula and this had both in spades (arugula being peppery, I know). I mentioned this to the waitress when she checked in on us and she said that it must be the dressing. So next time I know to get the dressing on the side and request less arugula if possible.\\n\\nFor dinner Friday night, I got the Proscuitto, Fig jam, and Gorgonzola pizza. Just as delicious, if not better, because they'd upped the jam content. My one and only complaint is that they should really shop up the proscuitto into more bite-sized pieces. The big pieces made it nearly impossible to eat gracefully.\\n\\nThe service is usually pretty good, although on my Friday evening visit, we noted that we didn't seem to have one waitress assigned to us- there was a team of them circling which made it difficult to place our order and get things followed up on like water refills (never happened). It was strange. Not preferred as a customer.\\n\\nThe Pig is a great hangout. The food is tasty (yes, I've had other menu items besides things that involve proscuitto, fig jam and gorgonzola), even if you want things to cost at least $1-2 less. Great place to drink, too.

We were there on a Friday around 7pm (table for 3). We were told the wait would be about 30-40 minutes when we signed in, but it was a bit over an hour when we finally got our table. Then it was another 40-minute wait when we finally got our food (2 orders of fried chicken and a pork shoulder). The food was just okay, but the portions were big. The famous fried chicken had good flavor, but the batter was just too thick. We couldn't finish our food given the huge portions, so we had to box the leftovers. Good news was that the leftover fried chicken still tasted pretty good after we reheated it the next day."},{"name":"Foster Burger","address":"5339 Se Foster Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Hands down the best spicy burger in PDX.

I highly recommend their Family style meal, which is a premium night out, but you get your money's worth. On that note, come hungry! They provide so much delicious food. \\nWe were completely delighted by the fondue to start. The bread was firm and flavorful. The mushrooms were AMAZING. I would go back just for the fondue and a great cocktail after a long day. \\nI had the trout and my boyfriend had the fried chicken. This was by far the best fish I've ever had. They layered in the flavors, so you get a hint of the buttery fish, pesto, seasonings... it melted in my mouth and took me on an adventure. The chicken was perfectly cooked and seasoned and was complimented well by the Mac-n-cheese. I've never had Mac so rich and flavorful and thick. I wasn't sure I liked it on the first bite, but once I acclimated to how savory it was, I really loved it. I ended my meal with the cocktail and it was amazing as well!

But with each question came an answer that only kept me asking myself one thing. What the hell am I going to order? It's been a long time since I've felt intrigued enough to study the menu. It took a lot of investigation but I came to the conclusion that I needed the Jammin Jalape√±o Burger. All of our dishes came out with haste. One dish unfortunately, (the Black Truffle burger), came out as the Black and Brie burger which wasn't what my friend ordered originally. But! Within two delicious bites of my burger, my friend had already received his correct order as it was put on the fly and a drink on the house to boot! The rest of dinner went by with offers to try each dish for everything was either \\"the best sushi roll ever!\\" or \\"the best burger ever!\\" As we all know, mistakes happen...but it is, in my opinion, how you recover from those mistakes that make you who you are as a restaurant.

We waited about 15 minutes on a Saturday to get in for brunch, the server was quick to get us water, coffee and cocktails. Recommend the mimosa! The fried green tomatoes to start are creamy, hot and perfectly balanced with the tomato based sauce. For mains we had the signature fried chicken with mash potatoes & collard and the crab cake with sunny egg & fingerling. Mash potatoes were knockout and so was the crab cake. Fried chicken was good but nothing wildly special, same with the collard. Complimentary biscuit and corn bread with whipped butter & seasonal jam was sensational.

While we were waiting and drinking coffee at Heart (also lovely, and conveniently close to Screen Door), we debated whether the food could possibly be worth an hour and 45 minute wait.  \\n\\nOnce we were seated with Bloody Marys and coffee, and our biscuits and gravy for the table arrived, we felt that we'd made the right choice.  When the fried chicken and waffles, and various bennies arrived, we marvelled at how close we had come to missing this experience.\\n\\nThe portions at Screen Door are enough for at least two meals.  The fried chicken was perfectly crisp and juicy, and the waffle underneath was nice, though a bit overshadowed by the meat.  We also had the benny with fried oysters, which I was also a big fan of, but they didn't go over as well with the person who ordered them.  I think that it's not unreasonable to split the mains if you are not looking to take home leftovers.  That said, having fried chicken again the next morning without a two hour wait was also nice.\\n\\nService was fast and friendly.  There is a warning on the menu about the fried chicken and waffles possibly taking a while to cook, but our server explained that once the kitchen was busy, there wouldn't be any delay.  \\n\\nWould definitely head back on my next trip down there."},{"name":"Foster Burger","address":"5339 Se Foster Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I like your pickle plate, i like your staff, i like that i can get a shake with alcohol in it.
