I've been to other Ramen shops; Jinya for instance; and they don't compare to Tatsu-ya. If you're a vegetarian why are you going to a ramen shop in the first place? Now, if you've read reviews from vegetarians/vegans or someone who ordered the Ol Skool (chicken broth based), ignore them. I'm going to tell you all about this place because I've been here 100 times (both Austin locations, and the Houston shop) and am an addict. \\n\\nDon't get veggie. Don't get the chicken Ol Skool. The pork-based ramen is where it's at. Honestly, I don't really care for the #1 and #2. They're still lightyears better than Jinya, but not my favorite. Numbers 3 - 5 are the sweet spot on the menu for me. Specifically, my go to is #4 (Mi So Hot). My second favorite is the Tsukeman (pronounced Skoo-Men) (#5). \\n\\nOn average, I probably eat here once a week. 90% of the time I'll get the Mi So Hot with extra Chasu (pork belly), Ajitama (Egg) and some Yoda's (Fried brussels sprouts). 9% of the remaining times, I'll get the Tsukeman. The other 1%; when I'm feeling like a wus; I'll get the Mi So Not (#3). \\n\\nLet's start with the Chasu. It's some of the best pork belly I've ever had. Seared and caramelized on the surface. So tender, and melt-in-your-mouth on the inside. It pairs perfectly with the broth and noodles. If you add it on, it comes with two extra slices. Order extra. You're welcome.\\n\\nNow let's talk about the Ajitama. I don't like hard-boiled eggs. They've got a nasty texture and the whites are flavorless to me. That said, I freaking love these boiled eggs. I guess you'd call them soft-boiled, but the yolks are not liquid. More of a firm gel. Rather than flavorless, the Tatsu-ya guys marinate these in soy sauce, the pork broth, and something else that's sweet. They taste AMAZING. Without exaggeration - the best eggs I've ever had. Jinya's ajitama are nasty. These are heaven. You'll want to order at least one extra - again, you're welcome in advance. The extra is a whole egg. For reference, the ramen comes with half an egg. For the whole egg, I recommend biting an end off, then letting the broth soak into it before devouring the rest. I'm salivating profusely just thinking about this. \\n\\nNow the Yodas... I'm a big brussels sprout fan to begin with, so these are a given for me. They're fried, but not greasy, and somewhere in between crispy and tender. On the yodas, they put a sort of sweet and sour sauce. I like the sauce, but sometimes they'll put too much for my taste. Not a big problem for me, because I dump them in my ramen. The sprouts combined with the broth combined with the sauce is SO. DAMN. GOOD. If you don't hate brussels sprouts, get them and thank me later.\\n\\nFinally, let's talk about the #4 and #5 Ramen (Mi So Hot and Tsukeman, respectively). The Mi So Hot is one of the best things I've ever eaten. It's spicy, but not to the point of being unenjoyable. Yes, it makes my eyes water and nose run, but it's so worth it. The broth, coupled with the spice, coupled with the ajitama, coupled with the chasu, coupled with the yodas, coupled with the noodles, is the most perfect combination of any flavors and textures I've ever put into my mouth. If I'm not feeling like spicy, and I want something a little more sweet and strong; I'll get the Tsukeman. The noodles are separate from the broth. You pick some up, dip them in the broth, and then slurp them. The broth is delicious, but can be a little overpowering. Again, the chasu, ajitama, and yodas compliment the broth/noodles perfectly. This might be a better option for a sweltering summer day when steaming hot broth doesn't sound good. \\n To sum this long review up: You should eat here. Now. You should order the #4 or #5 with extra Chasu, Ajitama, and Yodas. You will love it, and you're welcome. If you're a vegetarian, go to your favorite hippy vegan place, and leave Tatsu-ya for the mentally-stable, productive members of society."},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been here twice and I think my expectations were just too high.

Chewy, but not in an appetizing way. The biscuits are part of most of the menu items, it seemed.  The skillet potatoes were undercooked, and my grits were swimming in butter- pooling on the sides of the bowl. Just overall really \\"meh.\\" Other things were too buttery or salty to make the whole meal taste good. The menu prices are also FAR too high for what this place is serving.  To pay over $30.00 for two people to have an eggs Benedict, biscuits and gravy, and two coffees, just didn't seem right.

Mind you, we weren't loud or acting ridiculous, we're all eating, having conversation and that's about it. The manager then came out and told us again that we were shut off and that \\"people like us are the reason why their liquor license gets taken away\\"- why, because my friend and her boyfriend are Hispanic and black? We once again asked why we were being treated this way and no answer. Once this happened, we were completely shunned by the waitress, manager and bartender.

I had the tasting menu which included the charred octopus, baby beet salad, lemon spaghetti, cioppino, followed by the tiramisu for dessert.\\n\\nThe octopus was one of the best I've tried recently. Brilliantly charred with a sweet mesquite smell; Crunchy out on the outside and tender on the inside and flavored nicely with the harissa.  The baby beet salad, although good was prepared very traditionally so no surprises there.  \\n\\nThe lemon spaghetti however, was the dark horse.  I didn't think much of the presentation when I was first served with it.  Maybe just a lot of bland looking colors but I was so wrong!  The lemon zest really shown through and I kid you not, when I got home, I immediately googled lemon spaghetti to see how to replicate it at home.  It was amazing.\\n\\nAnd finally, the piece de resistance, the Ciopinno.  I don't usually fancy a Ciopinno, not because of the seafood, mind you.  Quite the contrary, I live and die by seafood.  I've just always hated the bland broth but fear not my friend, there is nothing bland about this dish.  Explosions of flavors come right out of the fragrant spicy based tomato saffron broth and it's accompanied with 2 pieces of nicely toasted bread for sopping.   \\n\\nWe were so full that we had to ask for the tiramisu to go but overall, I couldn't have been happier with our experience at Serafina!"},{"name":"Barrel & Boar Creekside","address":"121 Mill St","city":"Gahanna","stars":"4","text":"I went here after checking out the Halloween Creepside event. \\n\\nThe bbq smell outside the place drew my friend and I in.

I was SO disappointed, it was literally the worst I've had.\\n\\nMy beet salad was also disappointing.  The beets were tiny little cubed beets - I had never seen that in a beet salad.

The entrance is so weird and confusing. When we drove up at 7:15pm there were three cars in the parking lot, not looking fantastic. \\n\\nWe walked in and every single table was empty. It was silent and the owners were sitting behind a counter. As we walked in they stood up, greeted us and seated us. As we walked further in we saw one more couple behind a corner. So we aren't the only people here. \\n\\nLooking over the menu it's very steep, $7 for some hummus, $12 for a Greek salad, $17 for chicken kebab, and $25 if you want chicken and beef kebab. The menu offers 7 entrees with the cheapest ringing in at $16 for eggplant parmesan. \\n\\nStill, the yelp reviews are keeping me here to try the overpriced kebabs and falafel. \\n\\n10 minutes later the other couple leaves and it's just us. Talk about eerie. As our appetizer comes, another patron walks in (thank God) and asks if they are open for dinner. We begin eating our combo appetizer and the other patron asks if we like it. We do, it's actually very good, you can tell it's all fresh. \\n\\nThe hummus is very creamy and not overly garlicky, the falafel might be the best I've ever tasted, and the tabbouleh is so fresh! \\n\\nThe decor is nice, white walls covered in wrought iron designs, some tables are decorated with flowers that are either very dead or fake and purposefully look dead. Either way I don't get it. \\n\\nThe entrees come out, I got chicken and my other half got kefta (beef) kebabs. They're both delicious, seriously, I understand the yelp hype about this place, however the plates are pretty regularly sized. Just two kebabs and some rice for $16 I just can't rationalize the price, even for the flavor. The chicken was moist and you could taste the grill, it was amazing, the beef was flavorful, mixed with herbs almost like a sausage. The rice was just okay for me, a little dry. \\n\\nWhile we were eating our entrees another group of 4 came in! Wow! Three parties in here! \\n\\nOne last note, they have a bell to signal when the door is being opened. It is so loud and high pitched I almost always thought a car was screeching into the building and I jumped every time! That needs to go, or be changed at least. \\n\\nOverall it's really good, there's nobody in here because it's so overpriced, which is why I won't be back. The food is good, the service was alright. Took about an hour for our meal, the owners made us a little uncomfortable but maybe that's because we were the only customers for a good portion of the time. \\n\\nUnfortunately, I probably will not be back.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I have lived in Atlanta over 20 years and have been to many BBQ restaurants in Georgia as well as Texas including the famous Franklins in Austin.  I also compete in BBQ and our team won best brisket at the Atlanta BBQ festival last year. So I figured I would try the BBQ at Fox Brothers. The wait was about 50 minutes on a Saturday afternoon at 3:30.\\nI tried the chicken fried ribs and the Fox Bros Burger sandwich.  The chicken fried ribs come with an Alabama style white sauce.  The ribs were cooked perfectly and the frying and crust made them like eating fried chicken wings.  I thought the white sauce was very watery and a little bland, but when I mixed it with their spicy sauce, it was very tasty and unique.  The brisket burger is not a ground beef burger. It is chopped brisket on a bun with some spicy mayo and cheese melted on it with onions and pickles.  I was very disappointed with this.  When I picked up the sandwich, it was mushy and the bun was soggy.  I think they drench the bun in butter or something that makes it soggy, or perhaps  the mayo. I told the server that I didn't like it and they took it back. They asked if I would like something else instead.  I got the sliced brisket with cole slaw and mac and cheese.  The sliced \\"fatty\\" brisket definitely made up for the disappointing brisket burger.  The brisket had the smoke ring and the texture was spot on.  The flavor was good and I could taste the hickory smoke.  This was one of the best brisket slices I have had in a restaurant.  In most restaurants in Georgia, the brisket is dry by the time they serve it to you.  Not here.  The brisket was tender and not too dry or juicy.  As for sauces, the \\"spicy\\" sauce tasted like Texas Pete's hot sauce mixed with Ketchup- very disappointing.  However, the \\"traditional\\" sauce was very good with a good balance between the tomatoey, sweetness, and kick at the end. Service was excellent. Total price was $32 including tax for 1 person which included the ribs appetizer and the sliced brisket platter."},{"name":"Pollo Bravo","address":"126 SW 2nd Ave, Ste 10","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Love everything I've had here.

After a long day of walking around Harry Potter's realm and experiencing the first day of Grinchmas, my girl friends and I were ready to chow down majorly.

Totally fresh fish! Super big plus in my book! And the drinks...Woooo! My bourbon was topped with candied bacon...and I felt like I could have asked for a plate full of it.

There's a bar and traditional seating area with booths and long tables for larger parties. \\n\\nThe menu is quite expansive, with margs and tequila drinks and small and large plates. For drinks, we've tried the watermelon habanero tequila drink and the house margarita. The drinks are generally $10-12 for one glass, or $30 for a pitcher (about 4 glasses) which makes so much more sense. If you get the pitcher, make sure to ask for your glass salted beforehand because they will forget. The watermelon habanero drink did not taste like watermelon nor was spicy. It tasted like watered-down simple syrup and was honestly difficult to finish. The house marg on the other hand, was simple and delicious. \\n\\nFor food, we've sampled the nachos (pictured), the plantains, and the chips with trio dips. The nachos were actually pretty good and filling with a generous portion. The plantains were also lightly fried with a delicious dipping sauce. The chips with trio dips, though only $10, got a C in my book. The sauces come in TINY ramekins that make it impossible to scoop out and the dips themselves weren't that tasty (though it's hard to say, with only about a tablespoon of each in a small ramekin). \\n\\nFor larger plates, we've tried the pork tacos and the tuna tartare. Though it's only 2 tacos, there is a ton of tender meat. They're \\"street taco style\\", meaning don't expect any fancy toppings. They are not street taco price unfortunately. The tuna tartare was just okay. Kind of bland and they only give you 3 small crostinis. \\n\\nOverall the food and drinks are 4 out of 5 but this place loses points for its service. The waiters are nice but inattentive and the service is SO SLOW. It's definitely a hard balance to be the right amount of attentive to diners, but our waiter rarely checked in and we constantly had to flag them down. Additionally, the food and drinks take a long time to come out and the restaurant wasn't busy both times. Again, the people are very pleasant but don't come here if you're in a rush. \\n\\nWe would come here again for the house margs and street tacos if we had plenty of time and couldn't get reservations elsewhere."},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"They are getting away with murder here!

The place is quite large, with upstairs and downstairs seating, and the atmosphere is generally pretty lively with a bunch of people clustered around the bar area.\\n\\nThe first time I went, I got the corn and black bean empanadas which I would highly recommend - definitely large enough for an individual meal or a shared app. Most recently, I got the black bean tostada grande. I was hoping this would be a lighter option since I wasn't that hungry - it ended up being the biggest tostada I've ever seen and was incredibly filling. I really liked it, but wish there had been a little more guacamole :)  My friends got the bean burro and swordfish tacos, which they both thoroughly enjoyed. The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because the service left something to be desired - my vegetarian friend ordered jambalaya as a side to his vegetarian burrito and when we got the dish, we realized they had given us jambalaya with meat. Instead of offering to replace it with the vegetarian jambalaya (an option on the menu) they sent over white rice, which was a little disappointing.

I have severe anxiety and so ordering online is my go-to method. You can either pay online or pay when you get there. I also tend to write quirky requests in the request box; my last order was on Super Bowl Sunday and I asked them to doodle on the takeout boxes.

Their menu is quite interesting, offering items that aren't outlandish, yet not found in almost every other place.\\n\\nI popped in for a Pesto Bowl, a popover with cranberry & black pepper jam, and the Paw-Paw soda. \\n\\nThe Pesto Bowl has baked potato wedges (baked very nicely), sliced tomatoes, a soft boiled egg, and a green pesto (made from veggies, not quite the oil-based Italian creation). It was definitely different as far as bowls go, but it missed the mark for me. \\n\\nSince there was no seasoning, the flavor came primarily from the pesto at the bottom. When I got to it, I encountered an onslaught of acidity (and salt in the initial bite). This masked the delicate flavors from the greens to the point where they might as well use vinegar! \\n\\nThe popover was solid, it had a delightful crust, and was light and airy. Though, I must say I prefer popovers from The Popover Lady in Boston Public Market. The black-pepper cranberry jam was interesting, but with my insensitivity to black pepper that portion was lost on me, becaming just an ok cranberry jam. My advice: make it chunkier, and substitute black pepper for chilies or another spicy element. \\n\\nPaw-Paw soda was interesting! Nice to have something fruity but without a chemical taste. I liked that it was lightly carbonated, but the sweetness I wasn't too fond of. While the fruit flavors weren't hidden, dialing back just a little on the sweet (10-20%)  may make it a bit more crisp and allow even more fruit to shine through.\\n\\nRegarding price, it is on the expensive side. They do use fresh local ingredients so, there's at least some justification there. \\n\\nThe location itself if clean, and the service is nice and fast. The only thing I'll add: it would be nice to have some salt and pepper available (sriracha was)."},{"name":"No Mas!

I did the 6 coarse tasting menu at Bisq recently and the experience wasn't quite as fabulous as I was hoping for. I believe the restaurant has potential but it needs to take a step back and kind of define what it wants to be. I felt like there was a collision of too many ideas that lead to an overall confusing experience.\\n\\nI initially made reservations for Bisq with the assumption that it was an upscale place based on the high priced, small sized dishes. My guest and I got dressed up, so forth with this expectation. On arrival there we were greeted by folks in jeans and seated next to a very mediocre bar. \\n\\nAdditionally, the high cost of the food wasn't warranted. Pretty much every ingredient in the dishes were items that could be found in my kitchen on most days. There was nothing that made me saw wow. \\n\\nI also felt like the restaurant was going for a trendy and untraditional flavors type idea. That can work really well if it's executed properly. If you're arbitrarily adding in strange flavors, it's going to be obvious and I really believe that's what happened here. Some of the dishes had a lot going on but didn't come together well at all. \\n\\nThe service was reasonable. They did make a mistake related to a food restriction but I was able to easily pick up on it so it didn't lead to any consequences. Otherwise, it just seemed like there were 3 different people serving us and we weren't quite sure who to ask when we needed something. But in the end, we were able to get everything we needed. \\n\\nSo overall, my thoughts are this: It's trendy but in no way upscale and the meals should be priced and designed as such. Leave the very unique flavors to the experts and just go with more traditional meals that can be executed well.\\n\\nIn terms of visiting again, I'll continue to read reviews as others post them and make that decision should the time ever come.\\n\\nMy oysters didn't come with lemon. Just as words of wisdom to the restaurant from a well seasoned foodie, oysters should always be served with lemon! I saw another reviewer had the same problem.

I recommend do not even go there, It's very light and tasty. It's a crepe with cream and fruit filling. \\n\\nThe Nutella French toast is good too if you like something rich cause the French toast is stuffed with Nutella and marshmallow. \\n\\nThe service was really good. After three hours of waiting they gave us a place in the bar, but when I asked then to change our table they accepted.\\n\\n\\n\\nTip: add your name to the waiting lis. I added my name at 11 and there were 110 parties ahead of us. We checked at 1:06, but there were still 31 parties ahead of us.

I do not eat/want Italian often, so when I do, I expect it to be scrumptious.\\n\\nI ordered to-go. I wanted alfredo sauce and vegetables, so ordered fettucine alfredo. I asked the hostess if I could get a variety of vegetables added to it, like a veggie alfredo. She said they have grilled mixed vegetables. I was happy to hear that and ordered that. I also ordered the white chocolate bread pudding. When my food came out, they forgot to give me my dessert. When I reminded them, they brought it out. Then, as I checked my order, I realized I had no ice cream. I informed the hostess and she told me that the bread pudding does not come with ice cream, only the tiramisu. I grabbed a dessert advertisement out of one the booths and showed her that it states the bread pudding comes with ice cream. She then ordered the other hostess to get me some ice cream. At no point did she apologize for the mistake, misinformation or anything.\\n\\nWhen I got home, I uncovered everything and realized that the \\"grilled\\" mixed vegetables are actually steamed and had absolutely no seasoning on them, smh. The alfredo sauce wasn't very good either, it was just ok. I ended up having to add seasoning to both. The bread was weakly seasoned as well (butter and garlic) and kinda hard/tough. I was expecting soft bread. The bread pudding was pretty good though. That was the highlight of the meal.\\n\\nI may give this place another shot, whenever I get the craving for Italian again, but it won't be anytime soon. Hopefully, that'll be enough time for them to make improvements."},{"name":"Elisa","address":"1109 Hamilton Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Bravo! To the Aquilini's and The Top Table Group, Bravo!!!\\n\\nWe love to go fine dining to celebrate occasions and each other, and Elisa the new Yaletown masterpiece was just the place.\\n\\nIf I'm to be honest, it takes a lot to impress me, and the attention to detail in this restaurant really did it for me. From walking down the street before even entering, you can catch the aroma of the hardwood fire for the grill, which just wet the appetite for the joy to follow.\\n\\nThe restaurant design is just beautiful, and understated yet so sophisticated. I'm impressed by the featuring of the old growth timbers, and just the right amount of stone wall treatments to accent. It's so West Coast Vancouver without the garish gaudy features of Vegas over the top decor. Doing less here, accomplished so much more. It's a really hard balance to achieve and this restaurant looks great!\\n\\nThe bar with its Louis Cognac as its feature, is really  where it's obvious that really no expense was spared when creating the environment. The Earl Grey Martini was super elegant and yummy. The classic Old Fashioned also executed well and the bar keep was even cool enough to heed my desire for less simple syrup, cause well... I like it that way!\\n\\nWe had the King Crab Skewers with Chilli Oil and Chick Pea sauce. This is just the type of fusion style West Coast cuisine that really excites me as it takes a yummy ingredient, treats it with flavours reminiscent of dim sum, that takes it next level with the smokiness of the hearth. Yummy! Definitely a knife and fork dish as the crab leg is generous.\\n\\nNext up was the seafood platter and the variety and quality of appetizers for the price point is really well executed. Favourite dish here was the Hamachi Sashimi with Uzu. \\n\\nNow when describing Elisa, it is at its heart a steak house and here is where the restaurant really knocks your socks off. The meat program here is best described as curated. It's not just a selection of cuts and features, but you can choose each artisan farmer from where the meat was procured, with each having its own flavour profile and method of feed to produce marbling. Magnificent!\\n\\nTruly great chefing as the aged beef was aged tastily and the meat not over salted so the true flavour rang true. Super Yummy Rib Eye from the Blue Dot Farm.\\n\\nBig shout out to our server Luca, who was interactive and attentive. He answered all our requests professionally and we truly enjoyed the evening because of him.\\n\\nElisa is a statement to the Vancouver High end scene that it's time to up our game, and The Top Table Group knocked this one outta this park."},{"name":"Which Wich","address":"410 Artisan Way","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"I spend way too much time day dreaming about the Turkey Club Lettuce Which at Which wich, it's getting distracting!

Our waiter was very nice, too bad after he took our orders he was gone and we got a new server who did not even introduce herself.  More on that below... \\n\\nWell, to start, my soup appetizer was not hot, so I was still cold after my walk, and the portion would not even have been enough to fill a 5 year old up.  My wife's appetizer, the spicy wasabi tuna roll, was good, but sadly it was actually larger than her main course.  We did get a small basket of bread and dipping sauces, but that was taken away as soon as we finished it by our akwardly quiet, somewhat rude but trying to be friendly waitress without an offer for a second basket.  \\n\\nFor the main course I had the steak frites which was a a few thinly sliced strips of steak and about 7 skinny string fries.  It was good, but because it was a child-size portion, I didn't really get to enjoy it because I finished it so quickly.  My wife ordered the mahi mahi, which was good, but small.  It was a little circle of fish on an enormous plate.  When my wife was finished, she asked me where the rest of her meal was.  So, after bread, an appetizer, and our main course (and the $10 waste of money called a \\"Margarita\\"), we were still starving.  \\n\\nThe desserts were good, but again, child-sized portions.

Sorry, honey, that's not a good first impression on ANY of us. $50 isn't the end of the world, but it's a big enough chunk of change to make a stink about it- we're college kids who tip well and have all worked in the service industry, don't waste our time with pathetic excuses like \\"Someone will get back to you about that.\\" or \\"it's out of my control.\\" Please, you pay for a drink when you fail to do your job as a server. We've all been there. \\n\\nI usually would give this place a second shot, especially since I hear they have a killer food menu, but I think three strikes in one night is enough for now."},{"name":"Goodbowl","address":"1630 4791 Mcclelland Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"4","text":"Service was over the top friendly and professional and they whipped up a delicious bowl within minutes, right before our eyes.

On this visit I was there with a friend and my two children. The overall service was less than par. We had a waitress named Laurice that seemed to lack the proper training to properly serve our table. When I ordered my children's food she brought out different items that weren't ordered. I then ordered a sundae for my children and she brought it out in soup form. When I asked her what all the liquid was that was supposed to be an ice cream sundae she said that's the way it came to the window. I wondered even if it did come to the window that way, why on earth she didn't ask for another one instead of serving that to us. When asked to bring us another sundae she inspected it as if it was unnecessary to get my children another sundae. Upon completion of our meal I gave her $60 for a $52 bill, assuming she would bring the change so I could inspect the bill once more before we left. She walked past our table several times after that and never came back with our change.

The donut wasn't too sweet. The burger patty was cooked just right. The sweet potato fries are mmm mm good. I had them with some cheese dipping sauce. Red recommended I try them with honey mustard and that was bangin too! \\n\\nI really cannot wait to come back to this place. I was gitty the whole time while i ate, drank and socialized. I felt at home the whole time. I felt really sad when the experience was ending. I said a sorrowful goodbye to my plate. Ra and Piola were my spots for a while but I really think this is my new spot.

To start I had the thinly sliced smoked Atlantic salmon, served with red onion, capers, creme fraiche, and crispy potatoes. It was beautifully presented with sprigs of dill and some nice micro herb greens. Extremely delicious. My main course was the very substantial Angus center cut NY Strip au poivre, cooked perfectly at medium rare. It was moderately sauced with a bourbon green peppercorn sauce, and black garlic puree... and served with parmesan potato gratin and Brussels sprouts. My only minor complaint was that the steak was a little too salty in it's seasoning, but otherwise it was still very tender and delicious.

I'm almost embarrassed to say that at this point I've tried almost everything on the menu. Their burgers are awesome, and they have the BEST fries (little crispy potato wedges), their homemade veggie burger is one of the best I've had, the salads and soups are always gourmet quality, and even their Mexican-inspired menu options hit the spot. Oh, and veggies, try the buffalo tofu! Yum. Only at Christopher's can you order a pizza, a stir fry, a burger, or a fajita plate all the in same place. I mean, artichoke chimichangas at a bar?

One of the roving staff members walked by and asked if I was still working on this sample piece of brisket that was on the counter and I told him it wasn't mine but I'd definitely like a little sample, even though I knew it'd be good, and he told me to ask for a fresh sample and not to be shy. I then told the meat carver that it was my first time there and he said, \\"is that right!\\" With saying that he put a generous sample portion in front of us to snack on and I do mean generous! After getting our food we went outside to eat and the food is definitely as good as everyone says it is! I got the brisket and rib plate and some extra brisket and ribs to go.

I couldn't eat this fast just to get out of there. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the staff is nice and welcoming. The environment not at all. I don't want feel like I am sitting in a hyphy night club while eating a meal. This meal just made me sad. The broth had zero depth to it.

I'm not a drinker however I did purchase a drink for a friend that was celebrating her birthday.  She said the drink was very strong. Sitting at the bar I was about to see how a free pour state gets down.  Mike was the bartender taking care of us.  He kept making different drinks for the young lady we met at the bar. She bought a round of shots for my friend and I and it tasted like watermelon whatever it was. The turkey burger was ok nothing to write yelp about.  (I'm sure I'm not the first person to say that.)  The burger, fries and many glasses of water (I had half a shot so I was trying to flush it since I was driving) did me in so I didn't have room for dessert so I cannot comment on those either.  If you just want to go to a trendy place for someone to dance with you on your birthday then this is the place for you.  There were a lot of kids in there surprisingly even with the amount of alcohol pouring and candy based drinks in there.  The celebration is what brings them.  They have different desserts sizes to celebrate with. She had the chocolate cake slice. Different songs at different tables play during each celebration.  However if you stay long enough the songs start repeating.  Cheers to those that decide to visit!\\n\\nUpdated per June 2019 visit: The sugar factory redeemed themselves the second time around.

I love chicken and waffles for its savory and sweet mixture. It's one of my favorite combos, but the chicken could have been more savory (or seasoned). I'm used to getting chicken & waffles from mom and pop shops in Oakland for a fraction of the price of what we paid here. I guess you can say I was extremely disappointed. \\n\\nPaline Bacon: Another item that was overly hyped. I think it was drowned in syrup or whatever they used to sweeten it. Whatever it was, it totally overpowered the bacon and praline. I wasn't a fan.\\n\\nBeverages: It's cool that they have different juice options for the mimosa rather than the typical orange juice, so that was a plus.

We live in the area and go often. But I had an unfortunate experience last time we went. We were asked by the nice bartender serving us whether we wanted still or sparkling water. We said sparkling and were served out of a generic glass bottle (not branded or anything). When we got our check, there was a $7.50 charge for water. We expect to spend money on good food and good restaurants. But that was extreme and excessive. I didn't want to take this gripe to Yelp and sent the restaurant an email (at the address on the website) asking if that was a mistake or for an explanation. Unfortunately, I never got a response, even after following up twice. Like I said, this was disappointing because we generally like this place a lot.

I used to come here 3-4 times a week easy. That was 4 years ago. \\nOver the time they have dramatically declined. \\nWhen I try to give them another chance they disappoint me more then they did since the last time. \\nIt's been about 8 months since I came back from the last time. \\nThe last time I was here. I was with my girlfriend and a few friends who hadn't been here before. \\nIn 4 hrs we were only served 2 drinks. Their system had went down and no one could close their tabs. \\nWhen asked if we could just have them close it when their system came back up. They said they could but it would be counted as an open tab and add a $25 charge for leave. So basically we were held hostage there with no offer of any kind. No drinks (to even pay for) and no way to leave.  Finally I asked our waitress for the manager. The manager didn't want to come talk to us. When he finally did it's as if it was rehearsed in his head. We asked him if there any way he could help us out because by this time we had already been here way longer then expected. He said there was nothing he could do and walked off.  Eventually I got smart and payed cash. That was never an option for them....\\nI contacted the manager and he apologized for everything and sent my girlfriend and I $50 in gift certificates. \\nWe finally decided to give this place another chance.

My bad for picking this place to celebrate my boyfriends and I anniversary. \\n\\nLet's start off that I had made a reservation online. We got there like 5 minutes early and checked in at the front. There was like 4 girls there. Why? I don't know. Other than to pretend to do some stuff on the computer screen and tell us to wait. \\n\\nThe place was pretty large - with a cafeteria type set up. Not cute. And I would say it was only 20% occupied. Tons of open tables and seats yet they insisted they were busy and we had to wait. \\n\\nSo we get seated. It's legit like a high school cafeteria. Big open space. Along the walls are booths but the kind where the other side sits a chair. And these chairs were so cheap. I feel if I used any actual muscle I would have flung it clear across the restaurant and outside. And the seat it self was too small for any normal sized ass if you aren't a child. \\n\\nThe tables are small and are all pushed together into long horizontal tables. So you are literally up in your neighbors business. \\n\\nAfter we sat down the hostess said our server would be in shortly. 10 minutes later our server came by so I was sure to hurry and order our drinks. She was nice enough. \\n\\nBut then 15 minutes passed by before she came by again to tell us our drinks would be ready soon so I stopped her to make sure we ordered our food. I wasn't trying to be there for 2 hours. \\n\\nWe put the timer on. It took 25 minutes from that time for our app and then later food to come out. And the food. Wow. Is there a word that is less subpar to describe it being so subpar? \\n\\nThe drinks were delicious, yes, but then the bill came. My boyfriend got the fish bowel drink and excuse me? $30! It was fucking $30! No wonder they didn't have the prices for the drinks on the menu. Because then who the hell would buy that?! We have had expensive shots not even that much money! I ordered a martini. And it was $15. It was good but not that good. \\n\\nI got the pizza burger which was described as mozzarella with marinara sauce and pepperoni. May have just left out all of those ingredients because all that you could taste was burger. Just the meat of the burger. I opened the bun up to look and see 3 thin as tissue paper slices of pepperoni and one slice of cheese. I couldn't even taste the marinara either. I'm not sure it was even there. Because what I ate literally only tasted like a dry burger. \\n\\nMoral of the story is.... Don't fall for the hype of this place. No need to ever go again. \\n\\nIf a bunch of friends want to go to JUST the bar to SPLIT and SHARE one of those fish bowel drinks I'd say that's the only justification for going. Even then. I'd pass. \\n\\nFor the amount of money we spent on a shitty experience we could and SHOULD have gone across the street to Yard House and gotten twice the amount of food and drinks that would have been outstandingly delicious with great service."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Did it live up to the hype?

It is practically an Austin institution at this point, and anyone who's a foodie knows that you must try Franklin if you're visiting.  My husband and I arrived right before 8:00 a.m. (I think around 7:50ish) and we were the 16th and 17th in line!  At this point the staff seems so accustomed to the long lines that they know what to do.  They run like well-oiled machine and take your (meat) order well before opening.  While you wait in line, the doors are open and you are free to use the restroom (you're going to have to, due to all the alcohol/BYOB you consume while waiting!).  Once inside, everyone's in a good mood and you're just buzzed enough to get ready for some BBQ grinds!  \\n\\n\\nTHE FOOD: Hands down this is the best BBQ I've ever had in my life (at least for brisket).  Everyone should try the lean AND fatty parts if it's your first time.  They're both amazing, but the fatty one is just soooo much juicier!  My husband and I got 1 lb of each, and we had leftovers for two days!  Good thing we stayed in Austin for four days and this was just our second day here.  The BBQ meat was everything I expected: smoke ring, juicy, fatty, and FULL of flavor without needing any sauce.  The sides could've been better (I'm partial to Mac and cheese with my bbq, and they did not have it on the menu) but for strictly the meat, it's worth it.  Like I said before, I probably wouldn't wait in line for 3+ hours again unless I was with friends, but the next time I'm in Austin I'll probably call in a phone order ahead of time to pick up.

She thanked me and said she would wait inside to get out of the heat. Within a minute, she was at the door waving for me, and I went inside to find an agitated male yelling at her and saying that he did not want her inside. The whole event felt very unkind, even cruel, and definitely unnecessary. She was very embarrassed and left the store. I took the food outside to her and apologized.

Again heavy sauced. When digging into the white meat it was a little dry, but don't worry I have a side of sauce to dip it into. \\n\\nIt's hard to judge these ribs compared to the other cause they are so different.

Being from Peru, I've tried my fair share of them in my lifetime and this one was a great rendition. Perfectly tart with a hint of sweetness and great texture from start to finish.\\nOur bartender Peter elegantly crafted our cocktail and took our food order as he did so. Top class.\\n\\nIn our second visit we ordered a Hot Apple Pie cocktail that had just the right kick to go with the sweetness. Their whip cream is made on the spot, which makes a royal difference when it comes to finishing the drink.\\n\\nMy most recent visit was on Black Friday 2016, which meant getting there as close to the start of happy hour was a must. The place was nearly full and we found sitting close to the window by the bar, we started off with a Dry Pear cider and a Spanish Coffee (the flaming version), it was by far the best I've ever had.\\n\\nOur bartender took Rum 151, Kahlua and Cointreau and set it ablaze, crusting a superfine sugar rim all around the glass, then proceeded to add cinnamon and nutmeg to the bottom, which added to the fireworks -- finally, he added 3 ounces of fresh brewed coffee, topping it off with their fresh-made whip cream and a few more dashes of cinnamon-nutmeg.\\nNote, this is a 6-ounce rendition of it, which I tend to like better because it makes the drink more honest and not just a load of hot coffee with a few spirits.\\n\\nOne item I've always had since first coming to Jake's is the spinach and artichoke dip. It is to die for! Plenty of flavor, cheesy and the artichoke is incredibly soft, coupled with warm chips, which they'll refill if you find yourself out of them. Our server Marissa was kind and attentive while serving a packed house -- top notch.\\n\\nTheir happy hour menu overall is pretty damn cheap for the great quality of food they put out. Yes, you are paying full price for drinks at all times, but that is a fair trade when you're given great food and quality drinks to pair with it.\\n\\nIf you don't happen to be a liquor person, there's plenty you can get to satisfy the $3.50 minimum drink per person required to order happy hour items.\\n\\nNeedless to say we'll be back someday for dinner to try their Cajun Catfish soon.\\n\\nIf you had your doubts, give this place a try, it's been there for over 100 years for a reason, you won't be disappointed."},{"name":"OEB Breakfast Co.","address":"1137 Marinaside Crescent","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"My new favorite brunch spot in Vancouver.

We did go on a Saturday night which was busy so we waited over an hour and a half. We did try the magical dining menu which includes the dessert. We were seated toward the back end of the restaurant. We barely had any meats come to our table and by the time they did get to us it was the rarest part of the meat. The few pieces we did try were good but wish they would've come around more because we only tried the garlic steak, sausage, pork ribs, and the chicken and barely tried the sirloin since it was too raw. The food bar was good and I liked that they had sushi. The magical dining comes with dessert so when we finally found our waitress after about mins waiting we asked for dessert and said they only had flan and a chocolate cake with marshmallow frosting. We asked about the creme br√ªl√©e and said it wasn't included which I thought was strange since it shows on the website. We were already tired of waiting and didn't want to argue that so we just ordered the dessert and asked if we can take it to go since again we had already been waiting for so long. She than proceeded to give us attitude and said no she can not we have to eat it there. Was a little upset at this point but let it go. We asked her for the bill and specified to split it since we were a party of 6. She rolled her eyes gave us a confused look as if she didn't understand. Than turned around to another waitress and said \\"these people asked need their bill separated so I need to go ask someone to help me\\". I'm sure it's something that gets requested all the time and we were the first table to ask that. At that point we asked for a manager because her attitude was very unpleasant and unnecessary when we were being polite.

I wanted to go somewhere I'd never been to before, so I checked the \\"What's New\\" section here on Yelp. Bem Bom caught my eye. \\"Portuguese? That's not something I see everyday in Orlando.\\" My friend thought I was recommending a food truck, which isn't a bad thing, because Bem Bom started out as a food truck, and food trucks tend to be pretty awesome. Now, they have their own permanent home on Corrine, and I cannot recommend this place to you enough.\\n\\nFirst things first, the interior is a tad small, yet cozy. There is outdoor seating as well. Seeing as how our Florida Winter is almost gone, patio dining here seems like it would be lovely. Also, they're on Corrine Drive, so you know parking is a bit limited. It's not their fault, and there are plenty of parking lots nearby that will accommodate you.\\n\\nThe decor is comforting and lovely. I never felt a, \\"What the heck were they thinking?\\" feeling with the design of the interior. My buddy and I were seated very quickly, and our waitress came by to explain the gist of Bem Bom and what they have to offer. Along with their usual menu items, they have some specials of the day, which is always a plus in my book. For drinkers, they have a selection of alcohol in house but they also have some options from the nearby Red Light, Red Light. Our waitress was happy to have us sample things before we made a final decision.\\n\\nWe started off with some chips and dip, and both were extounding. The chips and salsa are all made in house, and I probably would have been satisfied by the appetizers alone. \\n\\nI ended up ordering carnitas tacos. I'm a bit of a stranger to Portuguese food, so I chose what I felt was the safest option for a beginner. Also, I love spicy food, so when the waitress told me the sauce would be hot, I was like, \\"Bring it on!\\" To me surprise, their hot sauce is actually pretty damn hot. Most places oversell their hot sauce, but Bem Bom is not screwing around. If you want hot sauce, you better be damn well prepared for some hot sauce.\\n\\nI loved my carnitas tacos as my main entree. Orlando has a great number of taco places, but this one has an edge above the rest. The flavors were beyond satisfying, and I can't stress that enough in a Yelp review. If you like Portuguese/Spanish food, this place definitely deserves your attention. All of the ingredients tasted fresh like they were right off the boat. \\n\\nI am looking forward to my next visit to Ben Bom to check out their other entrees. Their daily specials keep consumers on their feet while their regular menu has plenty to offer for casual diners.\\n\\nI with Ben Bom the best in the future. If they keep going with their quality of food and excellent customer serve, we just my have a new contender for one of Orlando's best independently owned establishments."},{"name":"Eastland Sushi & Asian Cuisine","address":"16519 SE Mcgillivray Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Everytime shushi here is fresh and yummy, I love the octopus salad"},{"name":"Twigs Bistro and Martini Bar","address":"801 Waterfront Way, Ste 103","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"The Management and staff are amazing!

Sushi was not \\"meant\\" for take-out, so while my one take-out experience was \\"only okay,\\" I also realize that it's probably not fair to judge the restaurant based on that!

Avoid the bagel sandwich.\\n\\nMornings are hard. Mornings when you have to wake up at 4am for a flight are harder. I was physically nauseous from being up so early that I needed something with carbs to tide me over until my early morning flight home. I thought a bagel sandwich would be a good idea... it looked tasty through my hazy eyes. Sadly, that was not the result. It's warmed in one of those speedy convection ovens so the bagel is stale tasting, the sausage was flavorless, and the eggs were floppy. It was a sad moment. Thankfully, the coffee helped perk me up. It was actually decent and strong. \\n\\nI'd stick with one of their smoothies or juices, or a simple pastry if you're going the food route. They have some gluten free options. Coffee is worth it.

OEB turned up, so we decided to try.

The restaurant was casual and spacious with patio seating available. We got bar seats by the window. They aren't my favourite choice when I'm with company, but can't do be too picky since we were limited by time. So, it was all good. \\n\\nI ordered the EHHHH ITZA MEATBALL!! which was their breakfast poutine with chorizo meatballs and the SWEET DREAMS ARE MADE OF THIS! french toast to share. For the breakfast poutine, you have the option to get half fries and half green. It's a poutine, I had to go 100% fries. The hollandaise sauce makes this dish heavy and creamy. I relied on hot sauce and ketchup to balance it out. The fries were quite nice, but felt that the chorizo was a bit dry. My friends who each ordered their own poutine were left full after orders. Thank goodness this was the case because I ended up eating most of the french toast. Let me tell you, this dessert was amazing. When I had my first bite of the chewy french toast with a small chunk of the cheese cake dipped in the baileys sauce, I was hit with rich and decadent explosion. I had to take another bite as if chasing a high. I would absolutely want to have this dish again. Be warned, this will blow up your macros count for the day. \\n\\nOverall, I really liked what I had at OEB.

While not nearly as pronounced inside the restaurant, it was still noticeable and off-putting. It's hard to enjoy a meal with that smell.\\n\\nNow, on to the meal itself. The service started off nicely, with the server being extremely attentive without hovering. When we ordered our food, my daughter ordered the child's steak and asked for medium. The server informed us that on the kid's steak, they only had a button to push for 'pink' or 'no pink' and couldn't cook them to special order. Oooookay. Puzzling that a steakhouse can't cook a steak to order, but whatever. I ordered the filet medium, my wife ordered the ribeye medium rare. \\n\\nOur meals arrived shortly, and both mine and my wife's was horribly undercooked. My medium was on the rarer side of medium rare; my wife's medium rare was even bloodier than mine. They took them back and corrected the problem, and they tasted fine. Not spectacular. Just fine. My daughter's steak was unevenly cooked, with half medium and half well done. They must have pushed the button wrong. \\n\\nIt was around this point that our server just kind of vanished. We sat for long stretches of time after done eating, waiting on a dessert menu. When the owner came to check on us and we asked for one, he said the server had to let us know what the desserts were. It was puzzling. Finally got our dessert orders in, and they messed up a simple request of ice cream on the side of my daughter's dessert rather than on top. As the desserts take 15 minutes too arrive (not a complaint-- we knew that before ordering), waiting on a new one wasn't really an option so they just removed the ice cream. Her brownie was severely undercooked, with the center complete liquid. We were sick of sending things back at this point. \\n\\nWith all the things that had gone wrong with our meal, I would've expected a token comped dessert or something. Nope; not a peep.

One of our friends left Toad and didn't come to eat because she had a sore throat and was feeling tired, this will be important later. There were 5 of us all weekend, so every Uber and reservation we made, we were used to saying there were 5. We were seated at Toad and when our server Tom brought us over some water I apologized to him that one of our friends had left because she wasn't feeling well and we were so used to saying 5. Since we were at the parade for St. Patrick's Day, all 4 of us were still dressed in green. My male friend ordered a Long Island right away while we perused the menu. After placing our dinner order with Tom, before he left our table, one of my girlfriends asked him about a featured drink that Toad's bartender Dan had told us about. Tom knelt down next to my friend and told her that she had been tagged as someone who couldn't be served. My friend said, \\"oh, ok.\\" To which I asked what had been said and Tom stated that my friend couldn't be served. I asked why and he said, \\"you have been tagged as someone who can't be served, specifically the three of you; I hate being the one to do this, but it's coming from above me, it's out of my hands. Especially since you said that one of your friends went home because they didn't feel well.\\" The three of us he pointed at were women. I was flabbergasted as none of us were intoxicated and I said that just because she doesn't feel well, doesn't mean that she was drunk! I happen to carry a breathalyzer with me (again, I am from WI and we know how to drink) and decided to pull it out, I blew a 0.00! I called Tom back over and asked him to bring his manager over as well. He asked why and I took my breathalyzer test again; it again showed a 0.00! Tom then asked what I wanted to drink; I stated I did not want anything to drink, I was simply proving a point that I was not intoxicated and that his manager was being judgmental. Tom stated that I should stop talking as I was only making the situation worse and asked why I bothered doing the breathalyzer if I didn't intend to have a drink; he also stated that we were free to leave as he had not yet rung in our order. I again stated that I didn't appreciate being judged just from walking in the door. After about 5 minutes the manager on duty, Veronica, came over and spoke to us. She asked what was going on and apologized that due to the new hotel next door, the management and ownership had decided to start enforcing new rules to deal with their foot traffic and new clientele. Since they had so many unruly customers coming in for St. Patrick's Day weekend, they decided to not serve alcohol to anyone wearing green (what?!). My male friend who was served the Long Island had on more green than the 3 of us girls combined, yet he was immediately served! When I pointed this out, Valerie stated that Tom must have felt that he was coherent enough to have a drink; despite Tom previously saying that it was management's decision, not his. Since I was wearing a white shirt with a small amount of green on it, I asked Valerie that had I not taken my coat off, would I have been served and she ignored my question, stating that they were not serving anyone wearing green... I again pointed out that my male friend was wearing all green and she smirked. I asked if any of us had stumbled in, fallen over or were slurring our words, Valerie stated no and I then asked what gave them any indication that any of us were intoxicated... she could not answer that and she apologized by saying that Tom felt awful and they would buy us a round of drinks. At this point, we were all livid and refused the offer. Our food came out shortly after and the chicken pot pie I had was fantastic. My male friend got nachos (which he would not recommend) and fish tacos that made him very ill late last night and he is still feeling the effects today. When we were getting ready to leave, Valerie came back and asked if she could take care of my male friends Long Island and nachos for the inconvenience; he wasn't even the one who was being judged! My girlfriends and I were! I was still visibly upset and I couldn't believe that she had just said that! Eventually, they ended up taking care of the whole bill, which was not what we were looking for. We were simply looking for an apology from Tom that we never got. Moral of the story is: this restaurant's staff, management and ownership is judgmental and unless you look like a \\"regular\\" customer that lives in Cambridge, don't bother going here and heaven forbid you wear green!"},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Underwhelming.... we ordered chicken fingers and wings.

You see I got to eat at Franklin BBQ without a line and for free (Big shout out to Verizon for their SXSW #ATXunite event).

So the expectations for this brisket, I was hoping, would send me over the edge into barbecue nirvana. I tried it first with a bit of each sauce, there's a coffee sauce, a vinegar sauce and a Texas sauce. My favorite was the Texas sauce, what can I say, I'm a sucker for a good old-fashioned sauce with a little heat. It definitely was good barbecue, but then I took a bite without the sauce, to see what this meat really tasted like. And I have to say I was impressed. Everything was great, it was absolutely worth the hype.

The shrimp was perfectly cooked, as were the black mussels - albeit with a few cracked shells, but they were just casualties of the process. The \\"Juicy Special\\" was actually way more flavorful and spicier (in a good way) than I've had at their other locations, which I was pleasantly surprised to taste, so kudos to the chefs! The only miss for us was my mom had more than a few of her clams that weren't even close to being done (quite a few were still unopened), but since she ordered a pound of it, there were plenty left for her to eat her fill. We also ordered the fried calamari appetizer, and while it was decent, the breading kept falling off, and overall it was just lackluster. Probably wouldn't order an appetizer again here.\\n\\nService: Our server Steph was amazing! As were the managers - shout-out to the one who wrote his name upside down so we could read it easier - can't remember his name but it started with a J.

I think next time if we skip the clams, we should be in our ideal price range.\\n\\nParking: Huge shopping center so this'll never be an issue.\\n\\nOverall, Tucker has been begging for more diverse and established restaurants, and where Papi's and others have failed at this location, I see Juicy Crab thriving - provided they actually do some consistent local marketing unlike previous tenants (hint- hire me! )"},{"name":"OEB Breakfast Co.","address":"1137 Marinaside Crescent","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Went on a Sunday morning at 8:15 - walked right in.

This is a brand new place and we were greeted by a welcoming group of what seemed like hostess and fam and owners and aunts and uncles when we opened the door. The place is clean and organized . The menu is ample and simple. I like straightforward choices and descriptions. I got the Mamas chicken noodle and my daughter got the Signature Ramen. Hers was layered and complex with complimentary light spice sauces floating on top of pork broth and noodles. There were two kinds of pork- sliced loin pieces (mouth sized) and a portion of ground seasoned pork. Accompanied by the \\"jammy\\"egg- a term used by chef to describe the close your eyes texture of the perfectly poached half egg garnish. Mine had slices of roasted chicken floating with string beans and an a egg. This was pure comfort food - a great ending to thanksgiving and in walking distance of Icon and mother apartments and hotels in midtown Atlanta.

The pleasant experience begins with a phone call to confirm your reservation and see if you are celebrating anything.  You know you are in for a treat when you walk in and see this place.  You walk through a classy looking bar area, where the bartender is making delicious looking cocktails.  Once you get through the bar area, you enter the dining room which is unbelievable.  The main piece of art in the room is the chandelier in the middle of the room.  Our server said that it was supposed to be a plant that was struck by lightning. Very cool.  \\n\\nThe wine list here has to be the best Atlanta has to offer.  We took a good twenty minutes just trying to figure out which bottle to order. We finally decided on the Nanfre Valpolicella 2015.  This was an Italian red that was so delicious we ordered a second bottle. \\n\\nFor appetizers, we had the black truffle burrata and grilled tender beef.  The burrata came with toasted ciabatta bread and was amazing.  The grilled tender beef came on skewers and I could not get enough of them.  They were so tender and juicy, basically melting in your mouth. \\n\\nFor dinner, my girlfriend had the slow braised berkshire pork.  I had a bite and wanted to take it from her it was so good.  This was top ten tastiest pork I've ever had.  I had the filet. It was cooked perfectly.  A huge piece of meat, but I could not let any go to waste.

Not super flavorful nor was it the best benedict I've ever had but the biscuit awesome. Their signature orange blossom mimosa isn't anything to brag about because it taste like every other average mimosa, just orange juice and champagne. The benedict was almost $9 not including a side and the mimosa ran about $8.

Definitely better than Pizza Hut or Little Caesars. They have a really good two topping two medium pizzas special, 6 dollars per medium pizza, and they also have some really interesting specialized pizzas you can order as well (look at the menu) for whenever you're in the mood for something different. Mondays through Thursdays they have a large 3 topping special for just 8 dollars for carry out! So cheap! Their Memphis barbeque chicken speciality pizza is delish.. if you never had a pizza with barbeque sauce in it instead of pizza sauce definitely try that out, I highly recommend it it's sooo good. They usually deliver in around less than 30 minutes by the time you order, though sometimes it could take over an hour if you order whenever they're real busy. It helps to think first before you order: is there something going on that could make Domino's take a long time to get to my place? Don't ever order whenever it's raining outside, that's when it takes the longest to get there since usually Dominos gets slammed on rainy days... or if you do order on a rainy day always call before the rain hits so they will get to your abode first before all the other customers order. The hot wings here are amazing, try some of those if you order any of their sides. Cheesy bread is decent snack food... especially when u got a buzz going on. Boneless chicken is pretty good as well... make sure to order dipping cups with it. They have a variety of dipping cups. I'm not big on their deserts, sandwiches, or pastas, and they just have generic soft drinks... but I guess they go well with the pizzas. And a lot of people like all of that stuff so I guess I'm alone in disliking them."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"So middle of Austin summer,  no ramen is not the dish that comes to mind. \\nBut after watching some sport today,  I felt like having some ramen for dinner later. \\nCool, Ramen tsat tua is in the neighborhood,  lets grab some ramen to go for later. \\n\\nAfter looking for parking for a few minutes,  I get inside the restaurant.\\nO sorry,  we recommend that you have it here.

I admit, I wasn't impressed this first time. I had the gorgonzola burger which was quite good with the pear and beet salad. I was not impressed with the pear and beet salad. There were 2 pieces of beet in it and no pear. Mostly leafy greens with a vinaigrette. I had the \\"sweet meets heat\\" cocktail which was a sweet jalape√±o cocktail. It was pretty good. For dessert, we each got our own. My husband enjoyed his peanut butter mousse. I had the salted caramel cheesecake. For those that are wondering, it is literally just cheesecake with salted caramel on the top. It is just plain cheesecake. It says the cheesecake is made in house, but I can't tell the difference between their \\"house made\\" cheesecake and frozen store bought cheesecake.\\n\\nThe second time, we went with friends. I shared the fig flatbread. The flatbread is quite delicious. 5/5. I would totally order this again. I ordered the signature burger with fries. It was good, would also order this again. I will say, the waitress was not prompt in refilling our water glasses. I sat with an empty water glass for 15 minutes and had to search for someone to refill it. \\n\\nThis last time we have gone was again somewhat lackluster. We arrived for lunch on a weekday. It was moderately busy though we were able to seat ourselves in the bar/lounge area. I ordered the truffle penne which did not have any truffle taste. The sauce was thin. It was supposed to be truffle and parmesan sauce though I didn't find any of that sauce. Not even in the bottom of the bowl. It was like when you toss veggies in olive oil, and just get the taste. Only, there wasn't a taste of truffle oil. There was thinly shaved parmesan though. Your protein to add includes steak, chicken, shrimp and portobello mushrooms. I picked chicken. I got mushrooms. Honestly, the mushrooms really worked in the dish so I didn't complain, but still, it's a mistake. My pasta wasn't hot. It was warm. It had been sitting out for a few minutes, I'm sure. The flavor was good, though. My MIL ordered the signature burger and my husband ordered the chicken sandwich. They both got fries with their sandwiches. They were cold when they came out. They did speak up and the waitress brought out fresh hot fries, though this was after they had finished their sandwiches. \\n\\nCompared to some other restaurants in Vancouver (not all, just some), this is a good place to go. The view is fantastic. The food is good (as long as it's served hot). I think its good for once in a while. I just do not think the quality reflects the cost.

I look into the dinning area to see two other gentlemen with their hats on, and two of my colleagues with there hats off. I'm from the south and my parents always taught me to not wear hats at the table while eating so I know how to act and carry myself in a public setting and the respect to have while sitting at a table.

You MUST try the following:\\n\\nCotton Candy Marshmallow - subtle sweetness of the stated flavors with a hint of coconut\\nCoratina Olive Oil - lovely citrus flavor (the best collab/special flavor in my opinion!)\\nBlack Ash Coconut - it's literally coconut ice cream that's black\\nUbe - imagine a bowl of milk after finishing froot loops, that's your flavor reference\\nSpeculoos - the cookie with a hint of coconut flavor\\nLots of toppings to choose from but Stroopwafels are a must (you get two of them!)\\nBlack Ash Sesame Cone (hint of vanilla for flavor and a must with all your ice cream)!\\n\\nThey have a lot planned for the tiny space that they are given but thus far, the ambience is fantastic! Plenty of backdrops to take unique photos with great natural lighting. Not a lot of indoor or outdoor seating but Lake Eola is about two blocks away!

Tasting all the standard dishes was definitely in order for this first time.\\n\\nThe first item worth a taste is the Santa Fe Eggrolls. Filled with chicken, blackbeans, cilantro and other delicious assortments, its a great way to start the meal. This spin on the eggroll is nothing all that new, but Rodeo does it incredibly well. Paired with a creamy avacado dipping sauce, the flavors of the lime chicken and ever present spices work well together. Not too heavy, one order provides 6 egg rolls.\\n\\nNext up was the traditional Taco Salad.  The shell came separate from the actual salad, giving the chance to create your own, rather having it premade.  The shell itself was large to begin with, providing a meal on its own.  Pouring the salad contents of cheese, black beans, romaine, peppers and seasoned chicken was a nice chance to mix everything yourself.  Even though it came with a vinegrette, the salad was very fresh on its own.  There wasn't too much of one thing, and each item was great. The chicken was seasoned with some great spices and from time to time, pulling bits of the shell off during consumption was an added bonus. The shell was so very crisp and not all too heavy. The lightness of the shell and combination of the salad itself was very good.  \\n\\nLastly were the soft tacos, filled with steak, lettuce, cheese and your choice of various salas and some sour cream.  Granted, the taco by itself was good enough, but additional items are needed to provide more flavors in the mix.  With suprisingly simple mexican rice and black beans, it too was a meal by itself.    \\n\\nAll in all, everything was simple in the way that no special or unusual things were ordered the first time around for take out. The meals were not trying to be too ambitious, but they took simplicity and made it great.  If you ever find yourself wanting to get some solid Mexican food in the Winchester/Woburn area, The Rodeo Mexican Grille is a solid bet.

The ribs were full of flavor, and although it didn't fall of the bone immediately, the slight chewy texture was appreciated. The brisket was good, but nothing to rave about. The smoked wings were delicious. You can get them tossed or dry. We got it dry and used the bbq as dipping sauce. A lot of smoky flavor to the wings and nicely fried. The sides were also on point.

I enjoyed the prosciutto tartine and salmon tartine, and boyfriend said the belgian waffles were very tasty. The pomegranate lemonade was great, very tart and tasted super fresh.

I have been visiting for years and have witnessed many menu changes and staff whom have come and go. Recently I have noticed a change in chefs behind the sushi bar. Gone are the craftsmen, ripe with experience whom have honed in on their skills for decades, replaced by young new-comers priding themselves in achieving the slimmest slice of fish, possibly to help cut costs. During lunch hour, this place is usually packed and you'd have to wait patiently for a table, but not anymore. My party and I arrived just after 12pm on a Saturday, shocked to see that the restaurant had only managed to fill three tables for the hour we had spent there. Two waitresses came to greet us and sit us down while another came by to offer us hot tea. They were so attentive it was a little creepy. Upon glancing at the menu, a member of our party had commented that there were a lot more filler options available. Heavily battered vegetable tempura, spring rolls, fried rice and imitation crab sticks graced the menu amongst old favourites. Of course the miso soup arrived first. (Liquid inflates rice, making one feel fuller) Highly salty with a big wad of miso paste still in the spoon shape floating amongst clear liquid. I took a sip and it taste like the Dead Sea. Then came the rolls. Freezer cold, and mushed together with less than fresh ingredients -plopped onto our table like a dog's breakfast. Needless to say, we weren't looking forward to the salmon nigiri that followed. Freezer burnt salmon sliced paper-thin on top of beds of day-old rice. My cat would have rolled over! Hopefully the cooked items were better? We were wrong. Everything was piping hot and freshly microwaved, the texture, rubbery at best. Out of the items which all showed up on our table in the first twenty minutes into our meal, we all agreed the gyoza and jello tasted amazing. Upon inquiring if the gyoza were made in-house the waitress replied, they were store-bought at the grocery across the street. In the end, we left hungry and felt robbed of our time and money.

Second the Otto is amazing, avocado in my breakfast taco. Um, yes please! \\n\\nTaco Turn Offs: \\nQuacamole: Sad to say I really don't like their quacamole. And Avocado is my favorite thing in the world. Way, way too much lime! I know you don't want to make it turn brown, but the lime needs to be toned down. Also, a little over priced on the quacamole. You can get quac cheaper at most other taco place. \\nCatering: I love the food and the meats are juicy, tender, and delicious. However, the catering prices are rather ridiculous. A friend of mine had tacodeli catered for a boat party. Good lord that was one hell of a bill!! \\n\\nNeedless to say come for breakfast or lunch and check it out!

Maybe the stars were misaligned or I stumbled into a parallel universe but oddly nothing in my visit seems like other people's visit. First off, my family and I just walked right into the place. No wait. No line. Odd right?\\n\\nI liked the look of the place. It's a little cramped but it's funky and fun. They had green tea Kit-Kats so I know they are the real deal. Nice selection of beverages both American and Japanese (my kids love Japanese soda). The menu is somewhat limited but that's fine by me, I'm only interested in the ramen. \\n\\nNow I'm not going to say I'm a ramen connoisseur by any stretch, but having a Japanese roommate in college and living in NYC (don't mean to sound snobby but there are lots of great ramen places there) does tend to expose one to some really good ramen.\\n\\nI ordered the tokatsu sho-yu and it was OK. The broth was good, but the slice of chashu was kind of thin and not as succulent as I would have expected. After reading all the reviews I was expecting an explosion of umami but it just wasn't there. Maybe it was an off night? I was also expecting a little more stuff in the bowl, like some naruto maki or ribbons of nori. I know you can get these added but I was expecting just a couple of these thrown as per my usual experience at ramen joints.\\n\\nI was disappointed in what they call their 'bombs'. My old place would make a bomb with ground pork and red pepper paste called a fireball. I loved having a few of these thrown in as part of my order at my old ramen haunts. Here it was just a little dish with some red pepper paste. That was kind of a letdown.\\n\\nSo overall I'm going to say this was an average experience for me. I wasn't wowed but I wasn't disappointed.

You'll probably pay like $12 right off the bat not including tip, extras or a drink. If I'm super hungry (see the above add ons I pick) it'll be like $18. \\n\\nOther things to note:\\n\\nJust know the service isn't really a waiter per table kind of thing.

In order to place an order online we must order a minimum of 5 lbs which is like $125 ($25/lb). So we ordered 3 lbs brisket, 1 lb ribs and 1 lb pulled pork. It was so much meat, we ate it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. For some reason I didn't think it was that good at all. Just tasted like regular BBQ meat. Maybe because it wasn't fresh? We did heat it up using the microwave. Well I saw that they have a  chilled brisket that you can order too so I had ordered the chilled brisket to take back to LA. After leaving the brisket in the freezer for 2 months we finally decided to heat it up around Christmas time. This time around, straight out of the oven, it was soooo soooo good. So tender and juicy. It was so tender that we had trouble slicing it into pieces because it was just falling apart. Wished we could have bought back the BBQ sauce that it came with cause it would have tasted even better.

If later meant 30 minutes, then I guess they were right.\\n\\nSecondly, we were given attitude by some male employee who spoke in a condescending tone. He came by the table to say it was last call and to put in our final order. We decided to order an abundant amount of chicken and Jello as our last order. BUT! We were given a snarky reply when he said \\"You have a lot of meat. Can you even finish that?\\" Unbelievable. If I wanted to go for an all-you-can-eat experience, I better get an all-you-can-eat experience and not some rude waiter telling me what I can and cannot eat.\\n\\nThirdly, we were actually scammed. I kid you not. This was a blatant lie on their part and I am disgusted by how they handled the situation. When our group was ordering and writing down what we want on our order sheet, we did not order any sushi other than a few California rolls and some maki rolls. And when it came to the second round of orders, we didn't add anything new, but rather added on to what we ordered the first time. Then this is where it became a hassle. A plate of tuna sushi was placed on our table and we were puzzled. None of us ordered it and we told the waiter that we didn't order it. Instead of checking, he just said that we did in a know-it-all tone. We asked to see the order sheet to double check any flaws. He left and didn't return for a good 5 minutes (didn't think it would take that long to find a sheet of paper). When he returned, there was a number \\"4\\" scribbled right next to the tuna sushi on the order sheet. Right away, we knew we were scammed. Not only was it the only thing in the second round that was not in the first round, but it was also written in penmanship that didn't match any of ours! That man wrote that in himself! He scammed us! So instead of acknowledging they made an error, he chose to lie to us and write it in himself. I am disgusted by his behaviour.\\n\\nHonestly, the food isn't that bad for the price at late night. However, the orders are always smaller than what is ordered on the sheet and clearly, they can scam you. So I warn any of you who decide to go here to double check everything to make sure that you are not being scammed. Ninkazu, you need to really step up your game, because this is NOT how a customer should be treated at a restaurant."},{"name":"No Mas!

I got a coke, mozzarella sticks, chicken tenders, and fries! It was one of those days and I had skipped lunch. I ate all of my food! My husband got a foot long corn dog and my mom got a foot long hotdog. My husband also got the Mac n cheese bites because we've only had them once before a long time ago. Everything was in massive portion. Disney hotdogs look more like sausages because they are pretty big. Everything was worth the price. It was about $40 with everything we got which sounds crazy, but Disney wise...it's great! The Mac and cheese bites were really good for what I expected and weren't terribly greasy or funny tasting. Those mozzarella sticks were on point and so were the fries. I would come back for those 2 things! We spent less and the food was super yummy. I will definitely come back here and maybe hit up some ice cream on the boardwalk after. If you don't have reservations, this is a great place to come and eat.

Here they are simply about really good home cooked food that's a cut above the average breakfast joint yet very reasonably priced. Here your money is not going to support a franchise-able decor and menu concept - it's paying for just plain good food, served up in a clean no frills space by incredibly friendly and attentive people.\\n\\nMarty stopped here on his own a while back and raved about it so we headed back together recently because we love places that serve up breakfast fare all day.\\n\\nThis visit Marty tried a corned beef omelette with peppers, onions and Provel cheese $6.99. Provel cheese is a signature cheese from Missouri that is made from a blend of cheddar, swiss and provolone. It's particularly oozy, gooey and melty. He opted for grits and a homemade biscuit as his sides. His omelette was huge (he took half of it home), the biscuit was flaky and buttery and the grits were perfectly cooked.\\n\\nI ordered from the lunch menu and tried their slow cooked corned beef brisket on rye with grilled onions, sauerkraut and more of that Provel cheese $6.99. I got a side of baked potato salad. The corned beef was flavorful, the cheese really melted down melding into the rest off the ingredients coating everything with what could almost be described as a mild, creamy cheese sauce. The potato salad was chock full of all the fixings of a baked potato like cheddar cheese, bacon, green onions. I took half of the sandwich and side home. It was way too much for me to eat the whole thing.\\n\\nNext time you are heading down 436 in Casselberry between the hours of 7am and 3pm and find yourself hungry, be sure to stop into the Order up Cafe. You'll be glad you did.  You may see us there, we still want to try out their fresh ground burgers, homemade meatloaf, chicken and waffles ... oh and the pumpkin cranberry french toast!"},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing BBQ!!

I don't usually choose to eat in a food court. I have been there to shop at Burlington, but that's about it. I wasn't really sure which entrance to go into, but luckily I picked the right one.

I guess I will have to go back another time. I got the chicken and the barbacoa. The cashier didn't speak very much English, but we made it through my order.

Literally every bite was like jizz in pants fantastic. That being said, some of the worst service/treatment I have ever received at a restaurant. \\n\\nMy friend and I came in here around 5:30-6p on a Friday after I had spent about 4 hours getting tattooed in Davis Sq. We were also celebrating some good news on her end so, given our location, I thought this would be a great place to visit. Needless to say, we were in high spirits. The hostesses seemed less than impressed to see us; we were taken to a table that was right next to the entrance to the kitchen so I asked if it was possible to be seated in one of the empty 2 party booths. The bar was packed, but only about 1/3 of the tables were occupied so I didn't think this was unreasonable. We were told that those tables were saved for parties with reservations. This was mildly annoying since we weren't planning on lingering forever, but ok.\\n\\nIt took a while for our server to show up, when she did she started going through the menu for us. At that point we had both had a solid 5 min to peruse it so I asked if we could have a second drink menu since I was taking a while to pick. She snapped at me and her response was literally \\"why don't you let me finish speaking and then I'll get you a menu.\\" Let me tell you, that shut me right up. If I hadn't been famished at that point, this would have been the end of our evening at AH. I don't know who trained her, but I work in the service industry and, frankly, no one cares if you're having a bad day. Fake it till you make it and don't have to wait on people, darling. Not to continue dwelling on this, but I have NEVER had someone speak to me at a restaurant this way. Especially at a place of this caliber.

Maybe with the exception of the green bean comp appetizer [where normally you would get bread for the table?]. \\n\\nWe tried a few glasses of wine but the pours were not generous.

At this time I asked to speak to a manager then when he finally spoke to me he reassure me that my order would be out momentarily. I figured he would bring it himself instead he had another girl bring it out & parts of the order were WRONG! Not only that they offered no real apology or even a discount. Instead I refused to take the order & left unsatisfied. I then drove 10 miles away to another Cracker Barrel in Kennesaw where they happily helped me & were able to have my order prepared correctly.

Here are the good, bad and ugly aspects of my pre-theater visit:\\n\\nGOOD: \\n50 cent tapas (only when ordering the combo plate):  I really liked 7 out of the ten items on the plate (the sashimi tuna was excellent!).  The quality for the price can't be beat.\\nThe decor:  It was well decorated, cozy and comfortable.\\nThe service:  I sat at the bar and the bartenders were very pleasant and attentive.\\n\\nBAD:  \\nAt least three times in our 90 minutes stay. they tried to bring us the wrong food.  They also added two extra drinks to our bill and overcharged me for a glass of wine.\\n\\nUGLY: \\nThe drinks are way overpriced!  The sangria pitchers are $24 (not $20 as someone had indicated in a previous post).  It was fair sangria loaded with tons of ice (both in the glass and in the pitcher- which only yielded one and a half glasses a piece).  They are definitely trying to compensate for the low food prices by royally reaming you on the drink prices.\\n\\nMy advice: Go with $20 cash and get yourself a mojito or other house special drink, a beer, and a tapas combo plate.  It's the only way to make the deal remotely worthwhile.  My partner and I spent $85 with tip on two combo plates, two pitchers of sangria, a beer and a glass on wine (and we didn't even get buzzed).

Entrees were served on a small cookie sheet and were just beautiful to look at. I was a little surprised that the two entrees were more similar than I anticipated, but that doesn't mean they weren't delicious. Both entrees were constructed around a really sizable and rustic homemade biscuit. I think the biscuit is the most important part of these dishes because it serves as the foundation. It was fluffy, soft, but not overly greasy or buttered. I also really appreciated the hollandaise sauce which was well put together and had a light but flavorful consistency, instead of the heavy oily sauce I usually find elsewhere. The grits were really creamy dreamy as well. Finally that bacon!!!! MHMMMMMM. It had great thickness and smokiness, I only wish I had a whole plate of it!\\n\\nThe 7th trimester although similar, shines differently because of the generous portion of mac and cheese that they top the dish with.

We're talking no signs, office building with multiple floors labeled weird things like U12 level difficult. I wandered the building with another lost diner for a bit before we stumbled our way into a side door.\\n\\n- Once you get there, the place is beautiful; lush colors, plants, molded ceilings and chandeliers. The previous occupants at BarLola had one of the best patios in Back Bay, so come summer this will be the place to go.\\n\\n- The service is choppy; as in, your server will ask you every 5 minutes for the first half hour if you're still happy with everything, then disappear halfway through the meal.\\n\\n- The food is served \\"shotgun style,\\" which at most restaurants means you get 1 or 2 plates every 5-10 minutes; here it means you get EVERYTHING YOU ORDERED in 4. We'd made it two thirds of the way through our cajun guacamole when our one bowl was joined by two soups, short rib croquettes, fried chicken, and a kale salad. \\n\\n- The cocktails are awesome! Marie Laveau goes down like water, and The French Quarter tastes like adult juice. I can't wait to try the Frozen Voodoo Grenade next time.\\n\\n- You can opt to get the standard New Orleans fried beignets for dessert, but you can also order vanilla bean soft serve on a salted pretzel cone, and it is delicious.\\n\\nOverall, I'd say Buttermilk and Bourbon has a ton of potential if they can just iron out the timing of their food/service - and maybe add a couple signs to the back of the building."},{"name":"La Cava del Tequila","address":"1200 Epcot Resort Blvd","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4.5","text":"We discovered this gem by accident a few years ago and have made this a regular stop each and every time we are at Epcot, and as Florida residents that means often.

Yeah, I know ballpark food typically isn't cheap, especially when it's name-brand food like Fox Bros, but come on, man.\\n\\nThe Fox Bros stand serves two kinds of sandwiches:\\n\\n* Smoked pork sandwich ($11.50) - slow-smoked pulled pork on a \\"bakery fresh\\" bun\\n* Chopped brisket sandwich ($11.50) - hickory-smoked chopped brisket atop a brioche bun\\n\\nSides include coleslaw and kettle chips for $2.50 each. Bottled Coke, Coke Zero, Diet Coke, and Sprite are $5.75 per 16.9-ounce bottle. Two sandwiches, slaw, and a bottle of Coke set me back $31.25 (tax included). What a rip-off.\\n\\nI tried both sandwiches and the BBQ and bread were delicious, particularly the brisket. However, I'm not sure they're worth the ballpark mark-up. The quality of the meat was very good; tender, smoky, and savory. The sandwiches were big and messy to eat. I ended up eating the brisket \\"sandwich\\" with my fork. Based on the menu descriptions, I was under the impression that each sandwich would come with a different type of bun (though I wasn't sure exactly what to expect of the \\"bakery fresh\\" bun). Both sandwiches were served with brioche buns.\\n\\nThe mayo-based white slaw was fine. There's a cramped counter on the side of the stand with BBQ sauce (two kinds: regular and spicy), plastic forks, and napkins.

Todays offerings flour tortillas, biscuits, pancakes, chorizo  scramble, chilaquiles, bacon, fried catfish, mac n cheese,  roasted potatoes, sausage gravy, brown gravy, green enchiladas, fruit. At the carving station, was brisket, jalapeno cheese sausage, bone in chicken, and between the two of us, we got it all. \\nThe good, the bad, and the ugly.\\nThe good stuff for us was: enchiladas, chorizo, potatoes, chicken, fruit. All really good flavors, and the chicken was so tender. The enchiladas were amazing with salsa verde. The potatoes were seasoned well and complimented the enchilada. Who can pass up sweet fruit. Big chunks of watermelon, honeydew and cantaloupe with red grapes. The bad: the mac n cheese were very pasty, horrible mouth feel. The chilaquiles weren't so good either, bland and runny.  The brisket was tough, cold and lacked that rendered texture that Austin is known for. \\nThe Ugly : while eating chilaquiles we found a plastic tab in it.

This was completely false as I check my phone constantly for work and had never received such call. The manager came out (or at least who I thought was the manager) and said that she would like to sit us outside with a free app. I guess that's good enough for the hassle that we had and missing out on the skillets.

First off, the place is weird decor - kind of like the purchased a bunch of used bad restaurant furniture - really bright lighting and just not nice.

Unsightly.  Service was horrible.  The waiter was a smart ass from the start and made you feel stupid.  For instance, both my companion and I wanted to start with a salad, and in lieu of the romaine problem, just nicely double checked about what lettuce was being used - his response was so snappy and degrading that I was a bit speechless.  Same when it came to having to order bread and butter three times, only to be told by the nasty asshole waiter that it was cooking - so we thought fresh bread.  No it was heated in a microwave and shy we had to order three different times with two different servers, is a question I am still wondering about since there was NO ONE in the place.

I had expected better from the Moody Waltham group, I am a big fan of the other restos. I only had one sample of the Fried Chicken Sandwich and the Minted Snap Peas from Pollo Club. To quote a YouTuber, Report of The Week, \\"My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined.\\" \\n\\n1.) The food. The chicken piece the anticipated Fried Chicken Sandwich is too small, about the size of a burger slider or 2-3 chicken mcnuggets worth. Parsimonious and expensive servings probably encourage the worst tendencies inside me when it comes to food reviews, to let you know my bias. The breading is also fantastically overseasoned, totally masking the actually good moist chicken underneath. To compound the issue of flavorbombing, the pimento cheese sauce is also overwhelming, plus they have pickles and other condiments on it. Personally pimento flavor seems to strong for chicken. It could work with Roast Beef perhaps. The bun is fine, and regular burger sized, but it's a problem when the chicken is so small. It's like you took a burger bun, and slathered it with a go at the condiments bar. It's very pricey at $12, you can get (3) excellent chicken sandwiches at Popeye's for that price and each of them would have substantially more chicken. Dollar for dollar it would amount to maybe 6 to 8 times more chicken, and it's a way better balanced sandwich. I know it's unreasonable to pit a localvorian shop against a national fast food chain, but the reality is that Pollo Club put themselves up as a competitor as all restaurants are cruelly substitutable for one another. On to the Minted Snap Peas. These were tasty, perhaps the vinaigrette was tad too strong. (Too much seasoning seems to be a trend lately in many restaurants.) But it was extremely vexing to have to de-string each snap pea in my teeth and have to pull out stems of my mouth with my fingers or just spit it out. Not properly prepping the vegetable is lazy, shows a surprising lack of craft, especially at $7 I believe it was. Even if they just chopped the ends instead of properly peeling away the tough fibrous strings, it would be at least edible for the most part. In terms of menu, it's pretty sparse and it's apparent they are focusing much more on a drink program, so it's really not a proper restaurant in my opinion, it's a bar with a minor food program. So why call it \\"Pollo Club\\"? How about Pollo Bar? \\n\\n2.) They are not open for lunch and so it's dark outside, but almost pitch dark inside. These are the dimmest Edison bulbs I have ever seen and they have many of them. It is a black hole in there. Sorry this review is getting mean, I know. You can barely see the nice mural they had an artist paint. In fact I did not notice it until I saw photos on Yelp. Therefore because only dinner hours plus low lighting, the murals here are invisible from November till March. That's disconcerting. \\n\\n3.) Service is fine as you would expect from this restaurant group. \\n\\nMoody's can do much better with this space. The former short-lived BBQ and Taco joint was also over-priced, but at least the meats were excellent. Yet the people rebelled against $4 mini tacos. (How Naco Taco in Cambridge survived, I have no idea. That was one my most negative reviews, ever.) I'm sorry for this scathing review, but I know Moody's can do much better, and I look forward to the next revamp, as I am still a fan of the group and will continue to patronize the other restaurants.

This behemoth black box on wheels, called \\"Bubba,\\" is rumored to be a retired Army rig that used to tow tanks. Gives the term \\"monster truck\\" a whole new meaning. For realz.\\n \\nOkay, onto the important stuff. Unlike the few other Mighty Cone food trucks in Austin, this one currently (indefinitely? - the restaurant group is still trying out their future endeavors after the recent closing of HOTB 2.0) located in the Hudson's on the Bend parking lot, only offers three edible options: avocado, avo and chicken, or avo and shrimp cones ($7, 8, & 9, respectively). No burgers, fries, etc. \\n\\nI recently tried the chicken and shrimp options. As a MC virgin, I was tad hesitant for a few reasons. Prices for food quantity, I've never been a fan of fried avocado, and the spicy sauce they drizzle on top is VERY mayonnaisey (I dunno)  - and the hub despises mayo. \\nAfter one bite, it was clear where the name Mighty Cone was derived from. The ingredients packed a punch. Simple yet complex:  flour tortilla lined cone (think paper snow cone) filled with crispy mango jap cole slaw, \\"hot 'n' crispy\\" battered fried goods of choice, topped with their signature ancho chile sauce. \\n\\nThe cone serves as the perfect vehicle to \\"eat neat\\" and also helps prevent the paper cone from getting saturated with juices. The corn flake, almond breading is unique (it was actually created by one of the former HOTB's chefs) in that it is slightly thicker than a normal flour or breadcrumb batter. It provided slightly crunchy, flavorful bites, especially if you mix the cone ingredients up and take a single bite of everything together. \\n\\nIt was really good. Surprisingly good, and in some way almost had an addictive quality. When your fork suddenly reaches the bottom of the cone it's as if you want more; however, one will suffice. Very filling!\\n\\nOverall: Yeah, I liked it. My hubby did too, mayo based sauce and all (so shocked!). The price tag per cone is slightly steep (their margins must be huge), but I was very satisfied with the quality...and what was going to be a snack ended up being dinner. \\n\\nCarry on Mighty Cone, carry on."},{"name":"Eastland Sushi & Asian Cuisine","address":"16519 SE Mcgillivray Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Wow, this place is really not that great at all now.

I'm glad I gave it another chance. This time, at a more reasonable dinner hour, the full menu was available and service was great. The beer menu wasn't huge, but there were a few good local craft beers on it that went well with smoked meat. The brisket was exceptional, nice and smokey and well seasoned, but not terribly dry, though a bit more dry than some of the best BBQ joints I frequent in NYC. Luckily there is ample sauce at Stubb's to go with it. The ribs were surprisingly excellent as well. I have grown used to the mediocre ribs one finds on the East Coast that tend to be dried out, and the Stubb's version was a surprising reminder of what good ribs can be. The sides were good, but not exceptional. I found the fried okra to be a bit dry and the mac and cheese to be extremely heavy. Luckily the excellent local beer helped wash both down.

Upon closer examination, in my dining room table at home, I found that while the underside of the pizza was cooked nicely, the cheese side was a lot more cooked than I would like.  It had a signature look of a Greek pizza, where the cheese is slightly browned on top.  What happens is that the cheese becomes more of a solid than something gooey.  I like the look of Italian style where the pizza still looks white and is gooey.  Greek is also more oily and filling, leaving me unable to eat dinner later this evening.

I don't think I've ever eaten a sandwich so quickly in my life - I just wanted bite after bite of sweet and savory goodness.

Unfortunately, I found the burger to be completely pedestrian. I ordered the BBQ Bacon Cheddar burger. It was cooked well done and was not juicy. This should be hinted at by the name of the restaurant: Smash Burger. If you press a patty down while cooking it, you'll basically squeeze any rendered fat (juices) out. This (and the lack of seasoning when the burger was made) left the burger (despite the bacon and cheddar cheese) kind of bland. Why didn't I mention the BBQ sauce you may be asking? Well, they didn't put any on the burger. I was just just so preoccupied with getting my thoughts together for my continued shopping adventure that it didn't occur to me until after the fact. I actually forgot that the burger I ordered was supposed to come with sauce on it. Although it would've helped a burger in need, it wasn't a big deal.\\n\\nThe interesting thing really came from my decision to order the fried pickles instead of the regular fries. I've had fried pickles many times in many different restaurants and I enjoy salty foods (that much should be obvious) but these fried pickles were extremely salty. One of the saltiest things I've ever eaten.

I did, however, put Micklethwait on my list, which Franklin was conveniently on the way to, so I figured I'd pop in, see that the line was way too long, then keep going to Micklethwait. So I popped in, the line (around 2:15) was estimated at only 45 minutes, and I said you know what, let's do it. \\n\\nI also accidentally gambled heavily, because a few minutes later, they came out, told us we would most likely only have chopped beef left, and then cut off the line completely a few people later. I figured even chopped beef would likely be mindblowing given their reputation, so we said sure. So almost exactly 45 minutes later, we get to the front of the line, and they still have brisket and sausage, score! So we get a huge plate of brisket, obviously, and I also order one sausage so I can try the sausage. Then they charge us for one sausage, and hand us a dozen, cause they had extras - mega-score! So obviously given that totally unexpected windfall, it was a crazy good deal, but also obviously you can't count on that. But even without it, if it were just the brisket... I don't normally totally trust \\"best in America\\" type lists, certainly not at the granularity of top 5, but yeah. The brisket is *literally*, and I do actually mean literally, life-changing - I did not think brisket could be that good, now I know better and I will be forever spoiled on any other brisket. If I were back in Austin, I still wouldn't stand in line for 3 hours or wake up at 4 in the morning for it, but if I had a kitchen, I *would* be tempted to buy 5 pounds of to-go meat just so I could have that brisket again and not have to stand in line, it was that good. It's expensive brisket, but absolutely worth the price. \\n\\nI also learned why the line moves so slowly, which is actually a totally smart thing for them to do - I was confused at first why it wouldn't move much faster, since they already have all the meat, they're just giving it to you and taking your money, but they slow it down so that a. they can give everyone personal attention, and more importantly, b. everyone can have a *table* (I've been to too many places where finding table space is basically impossible, and you end up having to take it to go.)\\n\\nAnyway, the brisket was life-altering, the sausage was just great. I also got a side of potato salad, which was also just great (but a great accompaniment to the meat). The bbq sauce was also fantastic, of course. They have a great (and surprisingly reasonably priced, all around $5) beer list including a couple ciders, so I tried a local cider for $5 and it was also great. Finally, we ended with their lemon chess pie, which was basically a lemon bar in pie form, which was also excellent. \\n\\nI doubt anyone will even read this review, though, given how many there are (for good reason!), so mostly this is just so I can brag about how I got to eat here for only a 45 minute wait. I would absolutely come back for that brisket for only a 45 minute wait any time, and there are really very few places I'd say that about. In fact, I'm not sure there are *any* other places I'd say that about - 45 minutes is a crazy long time to wait for food, objectively, but it's worth if for that brisket."},{"name":"Twigs Bistro and Martini Bar","address":"801 Waterfront Way, Ste 103","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Giving it almost 5, because I felt the beginning of our service could've been more welcoming, especially it being our first time being here.

The yelling lasted for approx 5 minutes. Every patron in the restaurant was staring at the argument and felt extremely uncomfortable.

Might have over did it on ordering, but we ordered everything we wanted to try. \\n\\nWhat we ordered: \\n- Rack of ribs\\n- 1lb of pulled pork\\n- 1lb of brisket (sliced)\\n- Chicken fried ribs\\n- 6 Smoked wings\\n- Spicy green beans\\n- Fritto pie\\n- Cole slaw\\n- Corn bread\\n- Fried pickles and jalapeno\\n\\nHands down, the favorite meat was rack of ribs.  It was moist and had just the right amount of sweetness and flavor.  \\n\\nSecond choice was the sliced brisket, which they ask you if you want more of the fatty side or not.  We went with the fatty side and it was delicious.  Had the chopped version before and I prefer the sliced better. Pulled pork was a bit on the dry side that it needed to be eaten with the BBQ sauce, which is super good.  They have 3 sauces, white, spicy, and BBQ sauce and glad that they had at least one sauce that I could smother my food in. Smoked wings were meaty but bit bland that I regretted not chosing the sauced version.  Chicken fried ribs tasted like fried pork chops.  \\n\\nFor sides, fried pickle and jalape√±o was the best. I've had fritto pie at the que osk and loved it, but it wasn't the same here. Must have been that it was the family size and didn't bring the same flavor or had enough onions.  I love cole slaw in general and it was good balancer against the meat, but it wasn't one of the best that I've had that I thought the sides were a bit lacking. \\n\\nThe reason we haven't tried this place until now, which is the most reviewed spot on Atlanta Yelp, was the fear of long wait and not finding a parking spot.  Although it got crowded real fast, we came here on a Saturday 11AM on the dot and was able to get a sweet spot right in front of the restaurant.  To my surprise, there's also some parking spots making that right turn onto five points, on the bypass turn so would recommend and making a stop here."},{"name":"Moonshine 152","address":"152 Dorchester Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Killer dishes.

It's got a slightly sweet and smokey flavor. We asked for a side of bread so we can finish off the extra hummus and nuts. I wish I knew how to make this at home.\\n\\nCorn Pancake with popcorn - pretty good. It's a little sweet, a little sour, and a little salty. Like an explosion of flavor in my mouth. Surprisingly the flavors went very well together and my tastebuds were not confused. The popcorn was probably unnecessary though.\\n\\nSwordfish belly - It was skewered, firm, and not too dry. It was less fatty that I was expecting from fish belly. It was served on top of greens and apple slices and together this dish was refreshing. A good contrast from the other heavy and strong flavored dishes we had.\\n\\nFried chicken thighs with snail sauce and pork fat biscuit - Braised chicken thighs cooked in oil, covered with toasted rice flour and fried. The resulting crust didn't feel greasy; it wasn't like your regular fried chicken crust and was almost like the crispy rice you'd get stuck on the bottom of your pan when making fried rice. The snail sauce was very rich but went very well with the chicken thighs. Snail was delicious, it wasn't too earthy. Biscuit was not dry at all, delicious but felt very buttery.\\n\\nI'd definitely come back and order the broccoli, but not sure about everything else.

He had to consult with a woman in the back whose name I unfortunately didn't catch and she began to talk poorly about me Spanish in front of me and several other customers. I personally speak and understand Spanish and I decided to tell her that I understood every word of which she was saying and that she needs to be more careful about what she says around customers.

It was a refreshing vodka, lime, and grapefruit drink.  For my second drink, I went with the Buffalos and Bacon.  This drink was basically an old fashioned with a piece of bacon.  Delicious.\\n\\nFor my meal, I ordered the \\"What's Shakin' Tuna Bacon\\" sandwich.  It's a very unique sandwich.  The meat of the sandwich is the seared yellowfin tuna with bacon on top.  The bread of the sandwich is a bun composed of spring roll wrapper stuffed with rice and the imitation crab sticks.  Its garnished with spicy mayo, slaw, tomato salsa, and jalapenos.  It was an unusual sandwich but it tasted great.\\n\\nFor my side, I opted for the seaweed salad over the fries.

Nope but you get one anyway. \\n\\nWAIT: this is what was the hardest to gauge. Some locals said 8am would be fine on a Thursday, others said before 7. I ended up going around 7 to be safe. There were 9 people in front of me (with the person who got there first at 4:45am ). But shortly after I got there, people really started showing up and the line was to the end of the building by 8.\\n\\nPREGAME: a lot of people turn this into a tailgating experience, bringing coolers of beer, chairs, and games to pass the time. The people in line were super nice and it was a real fun vibe. They open the doors at 8am at which point you can use the indoor restrooms, order beer, grab water, or buy their merch (if you want their merch, get it sooner than later since sizes sell out).\\n\\nPro tip: if Aaron Franklin is working there, he'll come out to the front of the restaurant and be willing to take photos and sign his book. Super nice guy and was thrilled to meet him. \\n\\nOnce it get closer to opening, a guy comes around to get approximate orders of your food. They do this so they can gauge how much food they have. At some point, they will tell someone that they are the last lucky person to be guaranteed meat and after that, you'll be at the mercy of the bbq gods.\\n\\nORDERING: they opened promptly at 11 and the line moves reasonably fast. You can order in increments of 1/4 pound and can get a single sausage link (one rib is pretty much a 1/4 lb).\\n\\nFOOD: I won't dwell on that too much here since there are plenty of reviews about the food. But the brisket is king, so moist and flavorful. The turkey is the best bbq turkey I've ever had, so don't underestimate it. Pork ribs were very good and the sausage was REALLY good. You're there for the bbq but the sides help cut through all the meat. The potato salad is tangy and good. And the beans are cooked in the meat. A must order. \\n\\nAll in all, totally worth the experience. Now onto Terry Blacks to see if it is in fact a true rival to Franklin's."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

We got tea right away and asked the server for hot chili oil and he seemed confused. He came back with soy sauce which we needed too but we asked for the chili oil again and had to describe it before he (kinda?) understood and hesitantly put it on our table to make sure it was what we were talking about...

I don't usually care for the shu mai in most places because it just tastes like a glorified meatball to me but it was really good here!\\n\\nAs for service, it was very mediocre and not what I expected. I know this is a dimsum restaurant and we are in Chinatown so my expectations aren't very high to being with. There were carts all around but it seemed like they would go to the tables with bigger groups and skip over us even though there was usually very little food on our table and we were clearly waiting. I typically had to wave the aunties down or ask the waitstaff for specific dishes because most the carts that did come by only had the fried items. Eventually, towards the end of my meal I noticed some people, especially in smaller tables, go up to the carts with their paper and get the dishes themselves. I didn't know this was typical here because I am so used to carts going around constantly and multiple dishes being at my table within a few minutes. Maybe because we went past peak dim sum time around 2pm? Still... the place was crowded and it was a weekend at that time. \\n\\nThe food was good here so maybe I will give here another chance.

I wonder if they did something different this time, because the chicken on the nachos were really tasty. Seriously. It was this shredded, lime flavored, herb induced taste. It was really good. The melted cheese was great as well. With nachos, it can be a crap shoot, considering the cheese isn't always melted all the way through and there isn't nearly enough cheese on there to begin with. With the chicken nachos this wasn't the case. With a nice pico de gallo, it was a great taste and multiple flavors were hitting me at once. The chips were nice and warm as well.  \\n\\nAs for my main entree, I got the Christopher Club. Usually, when I get a turkey club, I expect it to have REAL turkey. Especially when the menu says that its real turkey.  It was served on onion/garlicy wheat or something. And it was processed. It was kind of a let down. Everything else about the sandwich was fine, but its amazing how little things can take away the moment. The bread it wasn't working for me as far as tastes. It kind of overwhelmed the rest of the sandwich. It was still good, but the processed turkey and the bread took away from the experience. Their fries, however, were good. They were more like little seasoned potato wedges. They usually make every meal slightly better.\\n\\nAgain, this is one of my favorite go to places in my neighborhood.

Well, as we were eating our appetizers, the 13yo daughter and her father looked up and saw a MOUSE on the other side of the room chewing on something that had been left on the floor. The daughter has a phobia about mice and this just freaked her out.

For one thing, my husband's ex works there and I am the kind of person who doesn't handle that (or anything else) well, which makes visiting unpleasant. Now that I've admitted my psychosis to everyone, I'll move on to the food!\\n\\nThe first of two times I went there, I sat at the bar and ordered a dog to go because I was on my lunch break. It was back in October or so, so the restaurant was still relatively new and they were working out the kinks. I had to wait about half an hour for just one corndog, and that dog was like $8. It was fucking tasty, don't get me wrong, but it was still a corndog, and it was a la carte. I will be honest about another of my flaws: I love Krystal. And their cornpup is delicious, and it's like $2.  I know the quality is totally different, and that's cool and everything, but when I'm eating fried shit, quality isn't my top concern.\\n\\nWhen I went last night, I ordered a Mexican hot chocolate shake, and a Cobb salad, add corndog garnish. The shake was good, not great. I think it could have been bigger and thicker and spicier considering the quality aspect of Pallookaville. The smoked chicken on the salad was awesome, but other than that, the best thing was the corndog. The salad dressing wasn't homemade or even doctored up, and the other ingredients were fine, but lacked oomph. I know it's just a salad, but I've definitely had salads that knocked my socks off before. This wasn't one. \\n\\nMy husband got fries and a Reuben--both good, but not better than The General Muir, or the Brockett Pub. \\n\\nOur bill was around $40 and for once I have no complaints about that. I'm glad they appear to be successful, and I hope the steady business continues. I live really nearby and I hope other businesses follow suit and move in! I just don't know if I personally will be a very regular customer. I get yet impression they're going for a Vortex-style experience but with dogs instead of burgs, so maybe Avondale Estes (as we call it) will be Little 5 in ten years."},{"name":"The Greenery Creamery","address":"420 E Church St, Unit 112","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Toasted Almond Cherry.... and that's the end of this 5 -star review... that flavor of the two melded together is making my mouth water for more..haha"},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I guess we will be happy with any restaurant if we only go for \\"happy hour\\" and pay few bucks an order.

And when we were informed that they only do \\"local\\" crawfish in \\"season\\", we were like... and why so?  If you want to be Jake's Famous CRAWFISH, just import them.

How many times that you have customers walk in, sit down, and ask for crawfish and then you all waiters have to say... oh we... bla bla, because bla bla...\\n\\nAnyway, after we got lost on the menu we decided to go with a dish that's supposed to have parts of crawfish.  Somehow we trust the restaurant way too much and ordered 2 √âtouff√©e.   And so we got $25 (EACH) for SUPER SALTY √âtouff√©e.... that even you don't know how to cook but you can tell that it has been scoop out the pot which has been cooked for days.  The veggies in the dish were tasteless, yes because it's not just made for you or at least recently.  The tiny bits of crawfish taste like previously frozen you can get from supermarket.  Again, not $10 or $15 bucks, it is $25!!!   \\n\\nThe big thing is what I still remember spoon of salt over and over.  Probably I should double or triple my rice so I can balance this salty dish.   After half way thru, I don't know what to say but only miss New Orleans so much.  People, if you want Southern taste of √âtouff√©e DO NOT come here, they have no such thing.  I don't know where they get recipe which just made me mad at every bite and felt like I got ripped off.  \\n\\nMy mission tomorrow is to find some √âtouff√©e from mall or food cart to compare.

My husband and I really wanted to eat at a restaurant that was actually at Creekside so we didn't have to load up our baby just to drive down the road. We haven't been too impressed with any of the other places we've tried, but we were optimistic about B&B because of the great reviews. \\n\\nWe were fortunate enough to visit on a gorgeous sunny Saturday afternoon so we got to sit out on the patio. The patio is great! Really comfortable seating, a cool fire pit, and you have a view of the Creekside fountain and the actual creek as well. This was definitely the high point. If I was wanting to just have a few drinks, this would be a great spot. Our server was really nice and efficient too, so that was a plus as well. \\n\\nOur main issue here was just the food. It wasn't bad, but it just wasn't really good. My husband got the fire burger, and I got the winter spinach salad + added smoked chicken. We also ordered the fruit cup for our little one. My husband thought his burger was just okay, and said he wouldn't order it again. I was surprised because it seemed like something that would be right up his alley. My salad was honestly kind of gross. I guess the actual salad wasn't horrible, it was your typical spinach salad w/ spinach, pears, candied pecans, goat cheese, dried cranberries and a blueberry vinaigrette. It also had jalapeno cornbread croutons. Those were not impressive. They just tasted like fried chunks of nothing. No cornbread taste, no jalapeno taste. It just tasted fried. But my biggest mistake was adding the smoked chicken. First of all, when I thought smoked chicken I didn't realize it meant shredded chicken with way too much super sweet bbq sauce. Ugh, that sickeningly sweet chicken on top of a super sweet salad made my stomach hurt immediately after eating it. I should have sent it back, but nothing else on the menu appealed to me, and I didn't want to make our baby wait for them to make me something else. So yeah, I don't recommend ordering that, and I don't recommend adding the smoked chicken to any salad. It's the type of meat that belongs solely on a sandwich. \\n\\nWe definitely won't go here again to eat, although having a drink on the patio wouldn't be out of the question!"},{"name":"Wendy's","address":"1050 Mccoy Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Wow  this has to be the best Wendy's I've ever come to!

The salad bar was very well stocked and had great variety of salad options, veggies, beans, potatoes, chicken salad and tuna salad. The lobster bisque was something special! The meat options were fantastic. There was something for everyone. Offerings included various cuts of beef, pork ribs, chicken and lamb. I was slightly disappointed that there was no grilled pineapple. The fantastic dessert menu included cheese cake, creme br√ªl√©e, and chocolate lava cake. There was an excellent drink menu including a wonderful Caipirinha. \\n \\nThis was our first time visiting so we thought we would automatically get the advertised discount. We did not realize that we had to ask for the discount prior to receiving our bill. That was the only issue that we had at this restaurant.

Very good BBQ, not like other places either. Meaning great brisket, great ribs, good pork, good sausage, great beans. Sometimes a place does one or two of these well. Franklin does everything exceptionally well. It truly was the best brisket I've ever had. The ribs were a close tie for the best ever with the Cozy Corner in Memphis. The sausage was delicious as was the pulled pork. I did live in the Carolinas for about 10 years so I've have some amazing pork but Franklin did it right! The pinto beans were real yummy too. I wish they did Mac and cheese but its all good. \\n\\nI showed up at 12:35 on Saturday and was inside by 2pm. Its nice they come around the line with drinks and beers for sale. They also provided us with a sampling of sausage which was a great treat. I had 3 pilsners while waiting in line trying to keep cool for a meager $3 a beer!\\n\\n We ordered a lb of brisket half lean half fatty, a lb of ribs, the beans, and the Tipsy Texan sandwich although I made it a Tipsy Carolinian as I subbed the pork for the brisket. Even the slaw on the sand which was enjoyable! We had 2 more local drafts with our meal, got a baby onesie and a T-shirt and spent like $65 or something. What a screaming deal for all this food! The sandwich itself was at least 6 inches tall piled high with pork and sausage.\\n\\nI'm so glad I took a couple hours and came here. It just happened to work out great and the food was phenomenal.  They even hook you up with an extra burnt end or 2 and a nice sample when you hit the counter.

I had a decent $6 glass of white wine, shared a margherita pizza with nice chewy crust for $10, and enjoyed chips and guac for $3. Where it came a bit off the rails was in ordering one of the non-happy hour items--a fried calamari with fried red pepper and pickled onions ($14).

I work late, and it does take a little bit for me to get from Point A to Point B so I want to give you a heads up with my experience. \\n\\nI was craving sushi and most sushi places close by 10.. so I knew that Universal Citywalk closed pretty late. So, with this knowledge, I suggested to my friend that we should try this place called the Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar. One, it's in Citywalk which doesn't close until 2 am AND people watching is great here. Two, it has boozy milkshakes. Win. Three, it has burgers AND sushi.. or a combo of both. (Weird, I know but AMAZING as well!) Damnit, I will get my sushi.\\n\\nSo I've been reading about the waiting factor. Side note: if you don't want a 90 min wait.. my suggestion.. eat later. (Heh.) I know that sounds silly but this experience has made me see that waiting 90 min for your meal and the place is crowded, and you have to wait an ADDITIONAL x more minutes to place your order and wait for your food to arrive is.. well, I admire your commitment to wait. XD I believe 90 minutes was how much time we spent there, ordered, wait and finished eating.\\n\\nFirst, to soothe the hanger of our tummies.. we ordered the Stick In The Mud. It included Collingwood Canadian whiskey, vanilla ice cream, malt, caramel drizzle, pretzel rod. You can find this under the \\"spiked shakes\\" portion of the menu. If you need to mask the flavor, I don't suggest this as this was heavily lined with the whiskey (Yum!). Otherwise, I endorse this boozy shake! (Whisky fan, so yay!)\\n\\nMan, typically I feel guilty for ordering so much but it was decided that it would be a while until we return to try any other items so we treated ourselves! Get you a friend that understands how much you're willing to spend on food. (Haha!)\\n\\nDoug's Filet Roll is the Burgushi that is the result of a burger and sushi having coitus. (HAHA, sorry ya'll!) Anyways! Although this isn't common in Orlando (yet??), it is fun to have options like this available, so that I am thankful. Moving on, I mean the filet mignon portion was oooook-ay. I liked it. It's not my favorite but it was good. I'm glad we got to try it. We were hungry, and because of that, it was inhaled. Next!\\n\\nThe Jalape√±o Popper Show-Stopper.. oiy. This burger was pretty meaty heavy. If you are into jalape√±os, meats and burgers, this one is definitely for you. Not pictured is the seaweed salad, since I knew I was going to get the heap of fries. They serve a good portion of the seaweed salad but if you don't like it or never had it, don't order it. Please don't waste food!\\n\\nWhat's Shakin' Tuna Bacon Sandwich. Win win. This. The winner meal of the night. I'm proud that I ordered this because this is exactly what I had hoped it would come out. Sushi but sandwich style. Win for me. That yellowfin tuna.. *sighs*\\nIt was a MESSY sandwich but that's no problem! It is a pretty thick chunk of rice there. AND there's fries. So I think the carb department was covered. I don't know what else to try to tell you about this. Order it.. or not! But I will tell you this, if you come here and you like sushi and you don't try this.. you're missing out!\\n\\n| https://mmk10q.com/ |\\n| check it out for other reviews! |"},{"name":"Foster Burger","address":"5339 Se Foster Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm over it. Whatever made me think that this burger was not worth the price, whatever made me not want to give FB the benefit of the doubt, whatever made me uncomfortable about the whole situation. I'm over it. Foster Burger has made some changes, I've changed my attitude, and all I can say is that I'm pretty stoked with the outcome. \\n\\nFoster Burger has changed up its burger a bit. They now make their own brioche buns in-house. The burger patty no longer has pig back fat in it. The price has increased by $.50 but it seems to me (and maybe I'm wrong) but the helping of fries seems more heaping. \\n\\nWhat motivated me to come back to try the burger again? Kurt, the owner, reached out to me, and to Yelp, to follow up on a year's worth of trial and error, criticism, and unexpected fame. He told me they changed up the burger and that they had never intended the hype. The always wanted this to just be a chill burger joint. Of course with names like Ricker and Mondok attached, how could there not be hype, right? But whatever - the motives were genuine. He offered to invite the community back in to try the burger. And they did. And it was good. \\n\\nI sampled the burger on the day they hosted an Elite event and I could taste the difference. Whereas before the burger was simply alright, the new buttery bun and perfectly-cooked patty marked a striking upgrade from the prior incarnation. The perfectly-greasy quality meat flavor gave me that smile that only a really good burger can impart. \\n\\nSo I returned recently on a Sunday afternoon to try the real deal for myself, and ordered a medium rare foster burger with cheese and grilled onions. For $9, it came with a huge helping of fries, iceberg, house-made pickles and Foster Sauce. It was cooked perfectly, nice and greasy, and so delicious. The new brioche bun holds up to the burger so much better than the prior An Xuyen buns did (and that rich buttery taste doesn't hurt much either). I want to balk at the $9 price tag but the pile of fries was so big I couldn't finish it all. \\n\\nSo I guess I'm over my resistance to the trend that the average price for a burger these days is up near $10. I've tried so hard to deny it, but it is what it is. \\n\\nThe new incarnation of the essential flagship dish of Foster Burger is enough to have me wanting to come back more often than my heart and waistline desire. I'm sold. I'm sold by the positive changes, I'm sold by the A-grade effort that the owner and staff have made to create a truly neighborhood spot to come grab a delicious burger and beer. I'm sold by the new patio (yes, with big screen for games!). \\n\\nAdded bonus points for the delicious cock-shakes: cocktail milkshakes that are downright delicious. Mmmmmm.... soft serve. \\n\\nFoster Burger is one of the better, if not one of the best burgers in Portland.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"5 stars: Great Service, Great Food, Good Price\\n\\nI was looking for Atlanta's best BBQ and many said Fox Bro's is among the best, and they most definitely did not disappoint. I arrived to the restaurant around 11:45 and we had to wait around 40 minutes to get a table. I liked the fact that the waiting system was really organized, they text you when to come into the restaurant when the table is ready. The place was packed for a Thursday lunch but our server took our drinks and food order almost immediately. We ordered the beef short rib plate, half a pound of the beef brisket and two jalape√±o cheddar sausages. For sides, we got the frito pie and tater tots. \\n\\nBeef Short Rib: This rib was gigantic, enough meat to feed at least two to three people. Of course it was covered in rub/seasoning and smoked for hours, so the meat was very tender and flavorful. Wish I could have tried their pork ribs to compare, but it would have been difficult to top this beef rib.\\n\\nBeef Brisket: We got the beef brisket to be sliced and fatty, and oh boy, these were definitely the highlight of the meal. It was tender, juicy and VERY fatty, melted like butter in my mouth. Did not need any BBQ sauce, the meat was delicious as it is.\\n\\nJalape√±o Cheddar Sausage: I did not expect much from these sausages but they were actually really good, very smoky and the jalape√±o bits balanced out the ridiculous amount of cheddar in the sausage. Don't sleep on sausages at these BBQ joints.\\n\\nFrito Pie: Very unique, I think the best comparison to these are chili nachos? But instead it was brunswick stew and frito chips. Served in the small fritos bag, I would definitely recommend this as a side. Tator tots were pretty standard, on the other hand.\\n\\nService: Other than the wait, we had no problem with the service at this restaurant. The server came by very quickly to get our orders, food came out at a reasonable time, and our drinks were refilled without asking. Great service!\\n\\nOverall: These are one of the best BBQs I have had, went toe to toe with the BBQ I had in Texas. Combine that with the great service and good price (our check came out to around $75 including tip) and this is is a 5-star worthy restaurant.

Ever since he was at Woodfire and then on the Gunshow, my wife and I have followed (read: stalked) and so it was a no-brainer to try his newest brick and mortar, Revival. Gillespie's play on the meat-and-three plate concept and Southern Sunday supper is on point. As with Gunshow, reservations can be had several weeks out, but make them anyway.\\n\\nThe wife and I visited early on a Sunday evening. We were 35 minutes early for our reservation but were seated immediately after taking a seat at the bar. You cannot help but have your head on a swivel, drinking in the decor. It is homey and inviting with family pictures everywhere. There are artifacts on the bookshelves along with books to give the feel of a wood-paneled study. The waiting area is like a small sitting room; very casual and relaxed. The building is a restored house with a family history dating back to the early 1900s. The story can be found on the website.\\n\\nOur journey began with cocktails and our server explained all of our dining options. Prior to arriving, we already had decided to try family-style. As can be read from the other reviews, the family style is an excellent value at $42 per person. The wine list is short, but the wine by the glass was very good. So we both selected our entree and dessert and then, it began.\\n\\nUp first was the deviled ham on toast with pickled veg. This tasted nothing like the potted meat of my youth. It was hammy and creamy and delicious. Next up was the apparently-soon-to-be-famous kale salad with caramelized onions, peaches, dressed with southern boiled dressing, and finished with shaved parmesan. This salad looks pedestrian, but it will make your toes curl. I had never heard of southern boiled dressing, but I googled it right there at the table...bookmarked! This completed the hors d'oeuvres. I had hoped to get the marinated heirloom tomatoes, but I was not disappointed with anything.\\n\\nOut came the cornbread with sweet butter. The wife didn't really care for the cornbread. She is a southern girl who likes her cornbread sweet. This bread was more like a cornbread-biscuit. I loved it. The butter added all of the sweetness necessary to me.\\n\\nThen things began happening. The table was being transformed by a small swarm of servers setting serving spoons and removing dishes. The trimmings were delivered by the same swarming servers in small serving bowls and one mini Dutch oven oozing with cheese from the macaroni and cheese. As soon as my meatloaf was set down in front of me my wife had already stabbed it with her fork. Wow, she says, that's awesome. So the deal is that the sides, or trimmings, are the chef's choice, but out of the seven offerings on the menu, we got five. Not mad at all. The wife got the quail as an entree and it was tender and juicy with just a kiss of smoke. The smoked collards, the mac-n-cheese, the fatback fried corn, the butter beans with field peas, were all super delicious. The cabbage was okay, although the piece of ham hock in there was pretty tasty.\\n\\nWhen dessert came along, both of us were ready for a serious nap. We persevered because we're troopers. I made it three-fourths of the way through the toasted vanilla pound cake with pineapple and cream, and the wife got halfway through the peach pie with almond ice-cream. \\n\\nSo all tolled the cost was moderate - meaning we can dine here more than once a year.

I did a fly-in - fly-out day in Austin. Franklin's was my first stop after getting off the plane. There was a line and I did not get my food until a little after 12:00. Which is not too bad. I used a ride share app for my arrival, but it seems there is ample parking in the area. \\n\\nService: All of the staff was pleasant. They allow you inside to get water or to buy beer or soft drinks. They come around prior to opening to get a count of what you would to order. This is how they let people know if they have enough. They are swift about cleaning off tables when someone leaves and frequently offer assistance. I truly appreciated this from the staff. \\n\\nFood: You order a la carte and as a single diner this can add up if you wish to try different things. I ordered a Tipsy Texan, .5 pound of brisket both lean/fatty mix, .5 pound of ribs. My bill came to around 37.00 including my beverage. I did not get sides as the sandwich has coleslaw on it. I did not get a sausage because it also on the Tipsy Texan. The Tipsy Texan is a great deal. You get brisket slaw and sausage. I highly recommend it. The ribs were ok. Not the best I have had. The brisket was really good. However, I did go to La Barbecue later in the day and I liked the brisket better there. I wanted to compare the two. I don't know if I will ever visit Austin again so I wanted to visit both. It is hard to give fair judgment after one visit. Maybe they just had a better day. Franklin's has three sauces to choose from. I preferred the darker sauce that has like an espresso flavor and the sauce that had more of a vinegar base.  I enjoyed the experience. I think it is an experience if you are in the Austin area. I doubt if I return and stand in a three hour line, but now I can say I have had Franklin's Barbecue."},{"name":"Lonesome Dove Western Bistro","address":"419 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Hush puppies and blue crab were phenomenal.

The pig, which they told me I was the very first person to order ever (who knows), was also good but not exceptional for the price.  As I understand it this place likes to highlight the food's true flavors - like a celebration of meat - I just feel like I've had the same thing somewhere else but not as good.

But since it was summer and a Thursday, I figured it would be a good way to spend the morning.\\nSERVICE: And so I lined up at 7:20AM to get a taste of THE Franklin Barbecue. At this time, there were only about 10 people ahead of us. The staff was nice enough to let us borrow lawn chairs, offer us water, and greet us all individually. You can really tell that they love what they do- their energy and kindness really made a positive impact on the waiting experience. \\n\\nFOOD: We were served at around 11:10AM and the meat was delicious. We only got the fatty brisket as advised by Yelpers and it was a good decision. The charcoaled outside was ridiculously flavorful and the fat just melted the meat into my mouth. The brisket was perfect- probably the best brisket I've ever eaten. \\nI think it's also cheaper to get the sausage sandwich ($8) rather than an order of sausages ($17). The sandwich gives you 3 links while the order of just sausages gives you 4... Save the $$ and get some free buns!\\nAs for sides, they don't have many sides to pick from. They focus on what's important, which is the meat. I would skip the sides (Rudy's has the best cream corn IMO and I had a dream mid-meal that it would have paired beautifully with the meat from Franklin). I wish they had more options like Mac and Cheese or Corn. \\n\\nOVERALL: 5 stars for great service, experience, and food. \\nWas this place worth the wait? Probably not to people who AREN'T barbeque fanatics, but I do think it's worth the experience.

I am a seafood lover and a lover of classic, old fashioned fine dining and this absolutely hit the mark on both. Literally, there was not one thing I'd have changed, except maybe the fact I had to wait 5 minutes at the hostess stand to be seated as the hostess was MIA.\\n\\nI was doing a quick 24 hours in Portland and got into town around 9:30 pm on a Friday so by the time I checked into my hotel and ventured out it would be 10 p.m. Surprisingly few dining options after 9 p.m. within walking distance of my hotel. Thankfully Jake's serves food until 11 pm in the dining room and midnight or later in the bar.\\n\\nMy waitor was fantastic. Great recommendations, very knowledgeable about the menu and didn't try to upswell me where not necessary. Speaking of the menu ... I was a bit concerned when I learned this was a McCormick and Schmitt owned restaurant. I have found much of their seafood to be farmed and menu choices to be rather limited and uninspired. I ate lunch at McCormick near the waterfront the next day and the menu was pretty different than Jake's. The Jakes menu was more extensive and seemed less corporate.\\n\\nI did find it odd that at $40 per portion the Washington Steelhead was farmed given that the river right next to Portland has Steelhead in it. Regardless, that's what I got. Steelhead is hard to find on menus. It's basically a trout which sims out into salt water and eats Krill, a tiny plankton like pink shrimp. The krill turns it pink which makes it look more like Salmon while having the light texture of a trout. It was delicious. I got it grilled with the lemon butter sauce on the side. I used the sauce for the asparagus and potatoes which came with it. Probably one of my favorite fish dishes I have ever eaten!\\n\\nI also had a cup of the Crab bisque soup. Absolutely delicious. There weren't many Crab pieces in it as it was blended to a liquid but I loved it. The sour dough bread was fantastic as well. If only I had room for dessert ... instead I wasted the calories on a Ramos Gin Fizz. They have an extensive list of old school cocktails ... the stuff you only see in pre-Prohibition bartender books. It was delicious but I must admit I could not really feel a buzz after drinking it. $15 drinks should be pretty stiff.\\n\\nThe decor was good ... very old fashioned. Lots of wood trim and old painted scenes from Lewis and Clark's days on the walls above the booths. So glad I decided to stop in here ... it was absolutely everything I was looking for and thankfully seemed to be run independently from McCormick and Schmitt's corporate brand.

When we each had ordered an entree she asked which dessert we would like.  We hadn't picked desserts to she let us delay that for a few minutes while she placed the dinner order.\\n\\nThe wine list was even smaller than the last time so we opted for cocktails.  They did seem to take a while to appear.  \\n\\nOur appetizer was the small sandwiches again.  They were very good.  The salad was a kale salad that was not bitter because of the dressing, apples and pears.  \\n\\nThe entrees chosen were two pork chops, fried chicken, chicken and dumplings and the meatloaf.  The pork chops were the winner but the others were very good.  The meatloaf, although wrapped in bacon, was a little dry and could have used more gravy than the decorative schmear that was on the plate.\\n\\nThe sides provided were red beans & rice, macaroni & cheese, grits, peas with ham and collard greens.  If you aren't going to do family style, I suggest that you just do a bunch of side items as your meal.  They truly trump the entrees.\\n\\nThe evening we dined there were five desserts on the menu.

We didn't care because it was wonderful.  The desserts were the lemon icebox pie which was deliciously tart and sweet at the same time.  The strawberry fried pie with vanilla ice cream...delicious but could use more filling and less crust.  The chocolate cake which was chocolaty goodness but super rich so a forkful or two was enough.  The bread pudding with ice cream was exactly what you would expect.

I was displeased with how little of the toppings they put on my pizza (like 5 Pepperonis, 6 tiny pieces of Canadian bacon and a tablespoons worth of bacon).\\n\\nWhen our pizzas were ready they came out pretty crispy and kind of burnt. One pizza wasn't cut, at all. \\n\\nOverall, it still tasted pretty good but they didn't live up to the expectations the other location set for us. We will eat MOD pizza again but we may very well drive farther to eat at the Sherwood location.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"We went to Fox Bros because they had beef brisket which is hard to find at bbq joints in Atlanta.  We started off with the tots w/ cheese and the fried pickles.  Me being a fried pickle snob I knew that the taste of the pickles would make or break the place for me...thankfully they were great. Totally addicting and totally bad for you.  My husband had the tots appetizer which he apparently liked as he ate all of them. I personally think they would have tasted better with some Texas chili on top.  I had the sliced brisket sandwich which was a very large portion of sliced beef on a bun. Much like the other reviewer, it definitely needed the bbq sauce but thankfully it was good sauce. I order the mac and cheese as my side.  I personally didn't like it but I'm also not a fan of sharp cheese. The cheese was also a little grainy which also didn't help. However, my dining buddy who I gave the mac and cheese to enjoyed it.  \\nWhile we were there the manager came by and was very nice. Being a Texas native it was cool to find out that the owner's are from Texas and carry Lone Star beer.  \\nI will definitely come back when I am craving fried pickles and a good ole slab of beef."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I gave Alden & Harlow another chance and what a mistake. \\n\\nService\\nIt took 20min to get drinks and they didn't even have the hybiscus to make one of the drinks. Waitress had to ask twice what beer I ordered. Some of the dishes took 30+min to come out so some people had to sit and watch others eat. Water was poured all over the table when filling our glasses. \\n\\nFood\\nTuna crudo: A bit fishy and served with basil. I don't get it. Basil just doesn't go with tuna. \\n\\nPatatas bravas: Potatoes were super mushy and underwhelming.\\n\\nBaratta w/ waffles: Again a dish that just doesn't make sense. Burrata on top of a Belgian waffle with syrup all over it. The only place that has ruined burrata so badly. \\n\\nPork meatballs: Super dry.\\n\\nPork belly: Super dry. You have to let pork belly sit out a long time to get it this dry. \\n\\nKale salad: The only dish that was any good. Very good, light, lemon flavor. \\n\\nBathroom\\nI felt like I was in a bathroom in a Chinatown restaurant. A stack of toilet paper for the whole year and graffiti on the wall (see photo). \\n\\nOverall\\nJust not the experience of a restaurant that costs what it does ($12-18 per tapas size dish).

Today we were driving up from San Antonio on our way home from vacation and decided to drive through Austin to get cupcakes at Hey Cupcake. First driving through Austin just for cupcakes should tell you just how good these used to be. The cake itself seems pretty similar, but the frosting, which was the best part, is completely different. It tastes like the frosting on a donut. Not even a good buttercream.

Let me be clear, the sushi is five stars. It is consistent. I come here once or twice a week, and they don't have good or bad days, it's just always effing amazing sushi. It is my favorite sushi and my go-to, hands down. \\n\\nI always order the salmon sushi, alaskan roll, crunchy roll (just the right amount of spice) and sometimes salmon sashimi. The sushi is delicious, fresh and respectably sized. I mean the size of the salmon on that bed of rice is just mouth watering. \\n\\nHere's the catch. The service is abysmal and the restaurant is fairly decrepit. The seating has literally opened up to ooze out its contents. I also saw an ant on the table the last time I was there and you know what that means.\\n\\nThe majority of people who work here (the hostess and a couple of the waiters/waitresses) do not speak English. It's usually fine. However lately I ask for no ice in my water, and it comes with ice. I ask for no cucumber in my Alaskan roll and it comes with cucumber. Sometimes we order via the telephone to pick it up and take it home. JH and I usually challenge each other to a game of rock, paper, scissors because talking on the phone with the hostess is THAT painful. Recently, I ordered my go-to order over the phone to pick up on my way home from work, and the woman could not understand me when I said \\"crunchy roll\\". She's like, sunshine roll? And then started spelling something. She had no idea what I was talking about, got the menu and said \\"no we don't have that\\". Lady, I KNOW you have the crunchy roll, I just ate it three days ago. I was so beyond frustrated I just aborted the whole mission and went home and had Cheerios. A few days later I tried again. It started the same way with the person on the other end of the line saying a roll that was not the crunchy roll. However after repeating myself only once this time, she was able to figure it out and I successfully placed my order WITH the crunchy roll. Hallelujah! \\n\\nAnyways, come here for no other reason than the sushi.

My one critique is the confusing menu-- they have several sauce-less options and it's not really clear on the menu which ones those are. Sometimes even the cashier is confused on which are sauce-less and has to ask another employee.

Alas, the group in front of us were those dicks, ordering the final 3 pounds of brisket for all of 5 people. DICKS. My group was quite irritated by this, so we started booing those in front of us. The rest of the line did the same. We were then given a plate of \\"leftovers.\\" Fine. Whatever. At payment, I told the staff they should probably comp us a bucket of beer or something along those lines for our troubles. The manager proceeded to chastise me for being drunk and refused to serve us alcohol at all. For the record, I had two beers in line and was not even close to intoxicated.

Its darkened corners with just a little light between the wood slats has a way of transforming the midtown street gloom into a satisfying melancholy. It's a bar that's often best experienced alone, but bringing a friend never hurts. I've lived in Atlanta for four years, and this has been a reliable local since Day 1 (though I don't live in the neighborhood). Billy used to tend bar every Wednesday night, and I'd roll in after my shift ended at midnight for conversation and a discount on their always cheap house beer. They take their beer seriously, and it's a good spot to try some new craft options. The Cypress Street Ale has been one of several reputable craft brews over the years and what i get every time. it's always tasty, they change the kegs regularly and it costs about three bucks. \\n\\nThe setup at the horseshoe-shaped bar is good for talking to randoms, and there's always good people watching if you're more in the mood for the self-loathing, silent type of drinking. The bartenders are extremely friendly. Billy is one of the coolest proprietors I've met and I think he drills that hospitality into his employees. I just wish he'd still pick up some bartending shifts.\\n\\nThe only weak spot is the menu, which changes often with mixed results. The last time or two I've had a sandwich, I felt like it could have used more meat. I'd rather pay an extra buck. Also, the music has at times skewed a little toward mid-90s post-grunge, but I can live with it. I've noticed some more 80s in the rotation lately, which is a good thing. \\n\\nAnyway, Cypress I love ya.

Crab appetizer, lobster hush puppies, wedge salad, great bread choices, beef tenderloin and a chocolate cake with ice cream along with the best margaritas I've ever had and we were thrilled.

However, my chef friend had initiated the night out and he was willing to give it a shot.  We were told we could have an adult beverage while waiting in line so we grabbed a beer and chatted as the cue progressed.  When we made it to the front of the line the hostess immediately removed our beers.  There was motioning to the other workers inside and mumbling of some choice words in another language.  It was a very odd reaction to something we thought was not an issue but we continued to the ordering station just the same.  Food was ordered and the attempt to order beers was made and instantly shot down.  The four of us turned to one another puzzled at this reaction.  No explanation was given and we were hurried to a seat post payment.  We sat down to eat and inquired as to the reason we were not being served alcohol.  I might add that we were in no way intoxicated or exhibiting any inappropriate behavior.  The server looked at us and shrugged.  We finally gave up on the pursuit for another cold beer to pair with our Ramen and enjoyed the food as it was.  I still have no clue what the issue was or why we got shut down so abruptly.

The pork was wonderful - very tender, flavorful, and accompanied by a glaze that enhanced the pork, and was a very nice accompaniment to the polenta.  The broccoli was cooked just right and was the most tasty broccoli that i have had.  My wife had the snapper which was crisp on the surface and tender and flaky on the interior.  The cauliflower puree that accompanied it was delightful. We preceeded the entrees with a little gem lettuce salad which was presented with apple slices, a few very thinly sliced radishes, blue cheese, and croutons.  The crumbled cheese and the apple slices were great together.  \\nWe usually do not have dessert when dining out (it just does not fit into our calorie budget), but decided that with Kathryn King as pastry chef, we must have one of her desserts. The crisp exterior gave way to a tender and finely textured interior.  The lemon curd provided beside the cake provided an extra accent of sweetness.  And the ice cream accompaniment was also appreciated.  \\nI should not forget to mention the house-made focaccia that was provided at the beginning of the evening.  The crust was tender, unlike many focaccias that are a bit tough, and the interior was also tender as well as fine grained.  This is the best focaccia I have ever had!\\nMy wife and I have dined at some very nice restaurants, including Alice Waters' Chez Panisse in Berkeley.  Aria has a seat amongst the finest.

The feel and tone of this place is welcoming. So far as I think I've tried all of the current beers in my first night opening beer filghts, (as thy have only entered their soft opening there is really a small but strong collection of house beers) I can say they have a tasty premiere of quality fresh craft brews and my favorite so far is the Purple Skink IPA. Hoppy but not too hoppy and easy on the palette. The kind of beer that the taste stays in your mouth a few hours later making you remember why you drank it in the first place. I've tried the Humpity Bumpity double IPA and the and the Gila Monster Stout which were a nice alternative from my regular loves of Stouts and IPAs. I love milk, coffee and chocolate stouts and the Gila Monster seemed right there on a \\"will try again\\" list. For those new to craft beer and want to try something different but not to bitter or hoppy try both the Chameleon Vanilla, Orange and Key Lime Cream Sicle ales. The brown ales are flavorful as well. The tasting room as well, has a good amount of guest brews as well as many in the can and bottled in the behind the bar fridge. It's a great friendly place. Much like your standard local bar that makes you feel welcomed when you walk in the place. Being able to the see the brewery from the taproom is a great feeling knowing you're seeing where your beer that you're drinking came from. I look forward to making this place a regular place. Can't wait to try the KOMODO \\"KOKO\\" STOUT on my next visit. Tire are many coming out as they travel into the grand opening. I think the only thing I would like for them to add is...more pics of the place on Yelp and elsewhere. Oh yeah, and by they way, they not only invite tours of the brewery they grow they're own fresh hops in their own hops farm. Something you don't see in many breweries. Great place, great beer.

The blueberries all floated to the top and were far from abundant. Muffin base was moist, but also dense. \\n\\n3. Breakfast toast is all the rage and Guilder is happy to hop on that train. Too bad the toast wasn't toasted and the egg was broke so it was a slimy mess, which isn't terrible because the ripe avocados saved the day.

First things first, they have valet as well as plentiful parking, even on a busy night. We were immediately greeted at the host stand and promptly seated. Our waitress, Courtney, was a perfect balance of attentive and unobtrusive, which is exactly what you hope for on Valentine's Day. The boy ordered a Pinot Noir and I had a Malbec and we both loved our selections. The bread and butter were delightful, and I don't even typically eat bread! For appetizers, we started with gumbo and a caesar salad. Although both were great, I have to say the gumbo stole the show! For our entrees, he had the filet and I had the petite filet and shrimp. I must say, grilling the steaks in butter is a phenomenal idea. Both of our entrees not only met, but far exceeded, our expectations. For dessert, he had the chocolate turtle cake and I had a fruit cup. Now, I don't have much of a sweet tooth so I usually skip dessert but this fruit cup was TO DIE FOR! During the course of our meal, we had 2 managers, Devin and Dustin, stop by to check in on our dining experience. This is always a nice touch, and even more so on such a busy night! And, having worked in the restaurant industry myself, I was especially wowed when I saw all the managers, including Dustin and Devin, helping the servers any way they could - whether that meant delivering hot food from the kitchen or bussing tables. From the service, to the food, to the overall team approach, Ruth's Chris definitely delivered more than we could have hoped for on Valentine's Day.

Sure, there are several private lots around the restaurant, but they all charge money. I know this is to be expected in midtown, but money is still money, and I spent more on the $15 that Sunday than I did on my entree! Anyways, the restaurant is on a small road off 14th Street. Probably going to encounter traffic if you're trying to come here for dinner. \\n\\nMajor bonus points for allowing you to make reservations! I wish all brunch places did this, as the poor folks walking up behind me were told they had a 2 hour wait if they wanted in on a Sunday. \\n\\nPRO TIP: Goes without say, make a reservation ahead of time to not spend your entire afternoon waiting to eat brunch!\\n\\nAmbiance: The outside is unassuming, but the interior makes you feel like you're walking into an old southern home in Savannah or something. There's a charm to it. We were seated upstairs by a window, so that's always nice for taking pictures of your food, haha. The tables are a bit too close to one another for my taste, maybe a little too cozy of a vibe.\\n\\nService was outstanding! Olivia was our server, and she definitely elevated the experience a fine dining experience instead of just another brunch. She made suggestions, made jokes, checked on us frequently, super attentive and a ball of energy, but kept it real. \\n\\nFood: There's an extensive cocktail menu, but I would have preferred more coffee options. Even plain hot coffee wasn't on the menu, although they brought out some when boo asked for it. I'm an iced coffee guy, so if that's not available for my brunch, I'm not going to be 100% happy. \\n\\nThankfully their complimentary basket of rolls AND cornbread made up for it. Guys, this is some of the best damn cornbread I've ever had! Flavor was perfect, it was soft without crumbling all over the place. And the biscuits were just as amazing. Perfect with a dab of butter and the jam they provide (may have been apple, as it was a brown color and tasted nothing like berries of any kind). Seriously, probably the highlight of my meal! \\n\\nMy friends and I also split the Fried Green Tomatoes appetizer. Olivia was kind enough to add an extra tomato since there was 4 of us. I've actually never been a fan of this southern staple, but this was a great rendition. Crispy, flavorful, and visual presentation was top notch. \\n\\nI kept going back and forth for my entree, but I finally decided on the Smoked Brisket Benedict. For better or worse, the main Benedict was the weakest food item I had that morning. It was fine, but didn't blow me away. The brisket may have been a little dry. It was overshadowed by the unsuspecting red mule grits. One of the, possibly THE best, bowl of grits I've ever had. And I'm not even a big grits guy, as I almost asked to have it subbed out. So glad I didn't. It's super creamy, bursting with flavor, just perfectly balanced! I will say the portions are very generous. I didn't have much room left after the bread basket and appetizer, even though I came hungry. I still had half of my grits and one Benedict to take home. All in all, the price is very fair for the quality you get ($9 appetizer, $13 plate). There's a ton of other items I'd love to check out, like Shrimp & Grits, Jumbo Crab Cake, Chicken & Waffles, and as Olivia suggested, the Carolina Trout. Some of these will get a little pricey though. \\n\\nClosing Thoughts: It's really close to a 5 star, definitely one of the top brunch places in town. I can see why it has a high rating after 1500+ reviews. But I still prefer some of my other favorites by the slimmest of margins."},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"So much has been written about Seven Bites that I was excited to give them a try.

The sandwich was delicious and the grits were the best that I have had. \\n\\nMy husband ordered the spinach and sun dried tomato quiche  and added a sausage biscuit and gravy plate. The quiche was an epic fail. It was served in the shape of a plank and was incredibly bland and underwhelming. The crust was soggy and doughy. It was a huge disappointment.

After eating at this restaurant while visiting Calgary-and loving it, I was excited to hear that it was opening in my neighbourhood. Unfortunately both times I have visited have been poor experiences. Both times my partner and I tried different breakfast poutines. This restaurant does not know how to cook poached eggs. And you would THINK a restaurant with a 5 hour waitlist and so much hype--one that specializing in dishes with poached eggs--- would know how to cook them properly. Both times I visited, I ordered my eggs medium poached-which means there should be an outer circle of cooked yolk, fully cooked whites, and the inside of the yolk should be soft. Well the first time I visited my eggs came out so soft that the whites were not cooked. Instead of asking it to be re-made I just picked out of all of the uncooked whites. Usually I don't send things back to the kitchen. I figured it was a one-off and was just bad luck. \\n\\nWell the second time I visited, it happened again except the eggs were so soft that ALL of the whites were runny. It was literally impossible for me to even pick it out. The server did not come around for approx. 5-10 minutes to do a quality check-- at which point I told her that they were not cooked properly, and asked for them to be remade. She didn't apologize, and just asked me if I had previously asked for them to be cooked medium or hard. I repeated that I had asked for them to be cooked medium originally. She also gave me attitude as if I was inconveniencing her. I waited about 10 minutes and my dish returned and what do you know?! The eggs were cooked HARD. The server did not come back for at least 15 minutes to check on my food, which is such poor level of service. I didn't even see her. I just decided to eat the food but visually left the egg so she could see that they were cooked hard. And decided I would just never come back to the restaurant. \\n\\nIn case you're wondering, my partner got his eggs cooked soft and his whites were also runny. WHICH I understand, as that it typical when someone asks for soft eggs, however it is not right when someone orders medium. I cannot wrap my head around the fact that they cannot/choose to not cook eggs properly. Even HURRICANE GRILL knew how to poach an egg lol And also, Provence (next door) doesn't even ask its customers how they would like their eggs poached because they know that Eggs Benedict is supposed to be cooked with a medium eggs. Also there was a small spoonful of hollandaise on the poutine during the second visit. \\n\\nI expected a higher level of service and food especially due to the $20 meals and several hour waitlist. Also, although I appreciate the waitlist app- it still has several kinks to work out as both times we used it there were issues. We will not be returning."},{"name":"Arby's","address":"4484 E Main St","city":"Columbus","stars":"2","text":"Went they to order lunch for 4 coworkers waited in the drive thru for 12 mins finally get to window and try to give my order and the guy worker at the drive thru speaker wouldn't shut up long enough for me to give my order every word I said he repeted so I drove off went to Burger King across the street and spent 24 bucks  moral of the story shut up and listen"},{"name":"Revival","address":"129 Church St","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"Went for Sunday brunch and wasn't impressed. Two people in our party ordered preemptive cocktails at 10:52 that were expected to be served at 11:00 AM once drinks are legally allowed to be served but didn't receive them until 11:25 AM. To be clear, one drink was brought out between then, but it was the wrong drink and the server seemed to be very overwhelmed and flustered by this. Took way too long to get our food order in but the food came out quick which I guess was a plus. Given the fact that parties that were seated after us received their drinks before us, it seems as though our table was just forgotten about. I get that mistakes happen but compensation or a simple apology for the oversight would have been nice. The cinnamon roll is decent. Their entrees a just meh. They do not come with sides which honestly isn't a big deal but at ~$14 each, a small side salad or breakfast potatoes would really help with presentation.

I want a chewy crust, loads of browned cheese, great toppings, great sides/appetizers, great prices and specials, reasonable sizes, and friendly faces. When I saw that Odd Moe's opened up a few months ago, I looked them up and saw that they were still getting their bearings (based on the Yelp reviews), so I decided to wait a few months before I ordered from here, and I am so glad I gave them the opportunity to really deliver, because they knocked it out of the park.\\n\\nWe took advantage of one of their carryout specials and threw in a specialty pizza and cheesy garlic bread on the side. Everything was hot still when we got home, fully cooked, and truly everything that I was hoping and praying for. The cheesy garlic came with ranch without even having to ask for it, as all cheesy bread should. The cheese on the top of the pizza had to be pinched in order to keep it from staying attached to the other pieces, but the entire thing didn't slide off- it had the perfect amount of stretch. The crust was perfectly cooked throughout, no soggy or raw spots, and the outer crust was something that you actually wanted to eat instead of give to your dog/trash bin. The toppings were anything but scarce- my pepperoni pizza had multiple pepperoni in every bite. The cheesy garlic bread had real bits of garlic on it and cheese on every inch- even the edge pieces were just as good as the middle pieces. I've been desperately waiting so long for a pizza place like this that I could write poetry about it.

I got the brass monkey as a cocktail and it was unexpected what our waiter brought out -- maybe since I had not been there before I didn't realize I was going to be receiving a Colt 45 mimosas -- a beermosa as I like to call it.\\n\\nThe meal was great though -- the food was very solid. Received 2 fish tacos and some good fries with my order.

Also, I know Ramen Broth is suppose to be nice and fatty but this was a lil too much. Fatty pieces of pork everywhere and too overwhelming. Too salty to. OH, and I was not expecting the kind of noodles they serve here. They are thinner, and not what I'm used to. \\n\\nTsukemen ($10) - The dipping ramen. Same small portions as described above.

I asked if that information is found on the website and he admitted it wasn't and told us we wouldn't our kids in such a \\"rowdy place\\", as if it was a biker bar.

We took our receipts, chose a table, and enjoyed complimentary self-serve iced water. 15 minutes passed; more and more people arrived; some people hadn't placed their order yet, while others had made their orders online in advance and were waiting for their food. It soon became clear that the kitchen was backed up with orders - mostly online orders - and there were tons of ppl standing, waiting for their food. The lady at the counter was clearly overwhelmed and she started to direct people to another Bao Down location nearby to relieve the pressure. \\n\\nIn the end, we waited 45 minutes for our number to be called. We weren't in a rush, so that was okay, but the wait time bumped this review down to a 4. Otherwise, the baos themselves were great!! They were humongous and incredibly filling.

Cocktails have been terrific, and they have a large and eclectic liquor slection which lends itself to experimentation.  Having spotted several bottle of cachaca recently I asked after a Caipirinha, something a lot of local barkeeps may not be familiar with, but the drink I was delived was perfect.
