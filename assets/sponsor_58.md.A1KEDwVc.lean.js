Congratulations, Petit Robert, you're DEFINITELY the winner.\\n\\nI had heard good things about Petit Robert for a while, so tonight I decided to give it a try.  We were whisked through the kitchen (lovely gimmick), presented with at least two audible \\"bonjours\\" from the bus boys, and found ourselves in a busy-yet-quaint dining room.  I'd say the French Bistro theme was humming along nicely.\\n\\nMy attention was soon (very soon) drawn to the haughty gentleman and his female companion at the next table.  Apparently, the soup that the man was presented with (the soup du jour) was not satisfactory.  When the waiter arrived, the man paused, gave the waiter a look (the kind of look admissions officers must flash to students while preparing to say: \\"I'm sorry, young man, but you're just not Yale material\\"), then informed him that, \\"It just wasn't what I expected.\\" The discerning patron then proceeded to hold up the soup in eager anticipation of the waiter hurrying it back to the kitchen. Oh. My. God.  I had never had the pleasure of seeing someone reject food at a restaurant in such a disinterested-yet-obviously-douchey manner.\\n\\nAnyway, after that display, I decided I had to: 1) Find out what the soup du jour was; 2) order it immediately; and D) consume it with great enthusiasm.  It turns out that the soup du jour was a broccoli and pear cream soup, served slightly chilled ($5).  The soup was a triumph; the crisp, slightly tart pear flavor perfectly supported the creamy broccoli background. And, despite being cream based, was a light, refreshing dish on an oppressively humid summer evening.\\n\\nI ordered the steak frites with bearnaise sauce ($19).  The steak was ordered medium-rare and came out perfectly cooked--the outside was seared and the middle was a light-purple color.  The matchstick fries were aptly salted, but the bearnaise sauce tied the two together perfectly.  It had a sharp aroma of lightly saut√©ed shallots with a tangy lemon follow-up.  In short, this dish was a home run.\\n\\nMy companion ordered the panko-crusted pork loin with caper butter and mashed potatoes. This was another hit.  She remarked that it tasted like a pork piccata. The service was attentive if not a little overwhelmed, as the dining room appeared to be full. Our waiter was very laid back and pleasant, an impressive feat considering the behavior of our neighbor.\\n\\nPetit Robert exceeded all of my expectations (except for the quality of my fellow diners... yikes) and I would definitely like to go back sometime soon."},{"name":"Herbs and Spices Cafe","address":"925 West Georgia St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I feel, because of the last review, I should write one.

When I ordered, I was told by our waiter, who informed us that his name is Ned* (seriously), that the Marlin was one of his favorites and he highly recommended it.\\n\\nAll in all, the food was passable but certainly no better.  The patio(we sat outside) did add some positives including some decorative Christmas lights and fake garland and a little combo playing some background music which was really pretty fun.\\n\\nOur service was actually quite good and I felt bad for our waiter, who informed us...you get my point.  He did tell us his name several times and threw out some pretty cheesy phrases, but it was pretty clear that the staff had been instructed to behave this way.  He did a great job and that's why I'm leaving his real name out it.  He wasn't a jerk or even a goofball.  Just a guy doing his job and trying to pay the rent.\\n\\nI'm giving the Tree House 2 stars.  As is a common lament, I'd like to give it 2.5 but since I can't I've got to break one way or another.  Since the other ratings are a little higher I'm going to use my 2 cents to get us a little closer to reality.\\n\\nI will add that if the parents or grandparents are in town this place might merit a visit.  Here's a sample of our dinner conversation:\\n\\nMy Date:  \\"My grandmother would love this place.\\"\\nMe:  (looking out at the sea of white hair around us) \\"It appears everyone's does.\\""},{"name":"Gunshow","address":"924 Garrett St, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This was our first visit for the six of us.

Very pretty.  They also have a restaurant, bar, convenience store, pool, gym, and conference rooms.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, the front desk wasn't very welcoming.  The man at the desk gave us a bit of attitude regarding our reservation.  My mom had booked the hotel as part of our Christmas present so her name was on the reservation.  We had to call her to get her to call the hotel to work everything out even though we had the confirmation which was fine but the gentleman was very rude about it.  I went ahead and chalked it up to being because it was a very busy weekend for the hotel.\\n\\nThey charge $15 for overnight parking in the lot.  The only problem?  There aren't enough spots for all the guests they gave passes to.  We had to wait for someone to leave so we could park when we came back from dinner.\\n\\nThe room was quiet and the bed very comfy.  The bathroom was a little cramped but they had a Keurig, fridge, and microwave in the room which was great.  We ate at the restaurant for breakfast and were very disappointed.  They didn't have nonfat milk, only soy.  They didn't have white toast, only sourdough.  I ordered an egg white omelet and when it came it was so oily, the ketchup I put on actually slid off.  You couldn't even tell it had been on there!  We shared an order of blueberry pancakes which were very good, though.  Next time I will go for the buffet instead of the menu.\\n\\nWhen the checkout bill came under the door, they had miscalculated and told me they were going to charge my card $113.

We picked it because we needed a restaurant near the Prudential Center that was not too expensive and had decent food (and we didn't want to go to Cheesecake Factory or PF Chang's, although perhaps in retrospect, we should have). \\n\\nPetit Robert isn't outrageously expensive, but we left feeling like we had gotten a bad deal. The food just wasn't that good. I ordered the French Onion soup and the Moules Marinieres, and neither were as good as what I have had elsewhere. (NB- Central Kitchen in Cambridge had AWESOME moules marinieres!). I also got the sauteed cauliflower on recommendation from the waiter, and felt that it wasn't worth it (maybe the spinach would have been better? That was my other choice, but the waiter recommended the cauliflower). They forgot our friend's glass of wine that he ordered, and he had to ask a second time. My husband ordered skirt steak, and thought we have made it better at home. \\n\\nAs for dessert, my husband and his friend ordered the chocolate mousse, which was overly viscous. I had the creme brulee, which was fine, but the palmier was not crunchy and light; it was almost soggy. \\n\\nOverall opinion: adequate for what we were looking for, just not worth going there again.

He seemed like he did not want to be there & tried to avoid coming to our table as much as possible. All the Gaucho's (men serving the meats) were all friendly & awesome as well.

The quality and selection of interesting healthy foods is always great. The prices can be pretty ridiculous for basic groceries that can be purchased at Safeway or Freddies.  I have never understood how the prices of those basic, national brand  grocery needs can be so drastically higher.  But for us, that is not why we go to New Seasons..I wouldnt buy my toilet paper or cereal here etc.  Yes cereal, even Kashi cereal is way more expensive here.  That being said, their meat and fish are amazing, bakery is out of this world. Especially the raspberry almond bars...holy hell.\\nNow for the University Park specific review.  Clean, convenient, people complain about the parking, but I have always gotten a space, always.  I never do at Interstate.  It is small and less chaotic than Interstate. Unfortunately, because it is so much slower than Interstate, the employees seem like they get bored and care more about socializing than working.  At Interstate, they are so busy, they seem to have no choice but to work their asses off, which (mostly) leads to really good, quick (mostly) service.  I know thats a broad statement, but I seriously have been disappointed by the service at University Park  A LOT.   ESPECIALLY at the deli counter.  They are incredibly inconsistent.  Sometimes the sandwiches are decent, most times they are really sub par and have mistakes.  The most frustrating thing is their ordering system.  You use a dry erase marker on your own menu, then drop the menu in a basket.  The problem is, they rarely make the orders from the bottom up...meaning if you put your menu in first, and someone puts a menu on top of yours...guess whose sandwich they inevitably make first.  It happens all the time.  And if its busier, and 4 people drop their menu on top of yours, you can literally wait 30 minutes for your sandwich (that can happen at ALL New Seasons because of this system).  It really shouldn't be that hard...The other night, an employee who was trying really hard to do a great job behind the counter was CLEARLY getting frustrated with his co-workers that seemed to be just dragging their feet.  You see a lot of employees just dragging their feet back there....I know New Seasons likes to appear young and hip, which is perfectly fine, I love the diversity and casual feel, but trust me.  You CAN be young, hip and still have a good work ethic. New Seasons needs to add the requirement to their interviewing process. In fact, its hilarious how the type of service I get sometimes depends on what I am wearing.  If I am in my professional shirt and tie, I tend to get ignored.  If I am in my jeans and tShirt that shows my tatt sleeves, i get WAY more friendly service. Ive always thought that was so funny, and that has happened at numerous New Seasons. That being said, the butcher and seafood dept employees have always been awesome at this location.  It is really the deli/hot food area that consistently struggles.\\nWhich brings me to my sandwich last night that prompted my first New Seasons yelp review after shopping there for 10 years.  I waited 15 minutes for two sandwiches.  They had ONE sandwich maker at 7pm... dinner hour.  I got the UP Turkey Cranberry sandwich (my absolute favorite..when its made well, it is outrageously delicious).  I got it home, only to find a smooshed tiny sandwich with unbelievably dry, stale bread.  For 8 bucks.  I really couldnt believe the bread that was used.  I should have taken it back, but had already put the comfy clothes on, was camped on the sofa, you know how it is.  The inconsistency is what is so crazy...my husbands sandwich looked amazing. He had a different bread, which was fresh.  The constant inconsistency in the deli sandwiches, service etc etc is why I am starting to go back to the Interstate store.  7 times out of 10, they miss special requests on the menu cards (ie:  hold the lettuce...you will get lettuce.  Extra tomato...you will get one slice )\\nGo for the meat and fish, go for the bakery, go the cashiers (who are always super friendly), go for the huge selection of soft drinks.

Other more memorable selections included salads with poached then fried egg.  I don't recommend the vegetarian terrine - it's a very pretty dish with its multiple colors, but the flavors just don't stand out.\\n\\nDinner is more French bistro style, with many classic French dishes like steak, roast chicken, mussels.  I would be very happy dining here simply for bread and wine.  The bread is the freshest and most amazing baguette I've had in Boston, and rumor is that the dough is trucked in from Montreal a couple times a week.

I've never had any problems with their spice scale.  1 = no spicy ingredients added period, 5 = guaranteed acid reflux.  Blow your brain out the nearest hole-style spicy can be negotiated. With all of this said, you could also use the chili caddy to spice your dish Goldilocks-style at the table.  Remember that these are shared plates too; the prices are what could be called moderate but it's meant to be split between people.  Two people can easily feast on one entree, and if you add an appetizer they'd be rolling out the door.

They were fairly crowded and it seemed that the server forgot about us -- it took 15-20 minutes for them to bring our menus out. We didn't notice since we were chatting -- the only way we were able to figure it out was because they brought us free chocolate fondue at the end of the meal as an apology! Sweet. (Additionally, they did a good job with my little birthday cheesecake.) \\n\\nAt our booth (cozy U-shape), we ordered the lavender leshiis, the sweet tea and the molokai mule. The leshiis were the favorite of the table as the tea and ginger in the second and third options were a little too overpowering.\\nTwo of us ordered the Berkshire pork vietnamese sub (not sure if it's on the menu this cycle) - a really large quantity for what we paid ($12) but the meat was...dry?! One friend ordered and enjoyed the vegetarian risotto. The others split a white truffle pizza, which they really liked (though they found the aroma a little strong). \\n\\nThanks to what we thought was a good small event, I also booked a large group there. That wasn't as successful -- first, the prix fixe (mandatory for large groups) is a little pricey at $45 and ordering a la carte would have been a much tastier option. That is, though you get a small discount, the non fixe entrees are better and cheaper as a whole. The soup was average. The steak in the steak frites were good, but the fries were not up to par. (As a note, I would not pay $25 for the steak frites here.) I'd recommend getting a chocolate dessert here instead of the fruit-based ones; it looks like they use preserved fruit.\\n\\nI understand that having a mandatory prix fixe for groups is likely an issue of coordination and making sure the entrees between all of us come out at the same time. That said, we believed that there'd be space to sit together, given that we'd all been there before, but upon arrival, we were split into several smaller parties which slightly defeated the purpose of going there as a large group.

This became more apparent as the restaurants tables started to fill and other tables wine glass looked literally double the ounce size portion in comparison to ours. \\n\\n3, The appetizer was the Pear and Mache Salad which they split for us. Most other restaurants just plop the plate in the middle so the guests can eat from the same plate like Nubians. The presentation was above average and the flavor was as expected but nothing to throw a parade about.\\n\\n4, Our entrees were the Hazelnut Agnolotti her and the Wild Striped Bass for myself. The Hazelnut Agnolotti was bland and not very hot and without much sauce, although the presentation was nice. The Wild Striped Bass presentation was beautiful and the flavor was bland. Both entrees could have used a heavier portion size given the cost. Both entrees were delivered in a timely manner.\\n\\n5, A long wait for the check. I understand that by the time we completed out meal the restaurant was now full.

I looked up their website and finding myself pleased with it, we wanted to give it a shot. So i joined their email club online, and instantly received a coupon for \\"buy on entree, get one free\\". It was settled. We were both curious, and figured we should drive the half hour to get there from Douglasville, GA.\\n\\n     We had a hard time parking my dad's 08 Toyota Tundra into the small parking spaces and the parking lot was packed even though it was 9 am on Wednesday, May 19, 2010. Once we parked we walked inside.\\n\\n     The restaurant was loud with talking people and it there were quite a few people there, but we could still hear each other talk just fine and we did not even have to wait for a table. The waitress came and asked for our drink order, and our coffees were in front of us within two minutes. The environment was brightly decorated, and the table cloth had pictures of bright red strawberries on it. On the table were unusual condiments such as sugar cubes and butter (see picture)\\n\\n     I am a vegetarian and am usually an extremely healthy eater as i rarely eat anything that has an animal by-product in it, but i decided to order the orange-scented french toast\\" without the raspberry sauce and i had the honey creme anglaise on the side (the waitress assured me it was organic). My father who is not a vegetarian, ordered the \\"flying biscuit breakfast\\" which included two eggs (he got over easy), chicken sausage, and grits. He also ordered a biscuit.\\n\\n     Well i must say i was very impressed. The french toast was very good, though the orange was almost unnoticeable. I put a very small amount of the honey creme anglaise on the french toast, and it tasted great! The french toast in general was very very good. I savored one bite after the next as the french toast had a lightly crispy crust, but soft whole wheat bread that melted in my mouth.(see picture of french toast)\\n\\n     As for my father, he said he enjoyed his breakfast. He usually is not the biggest fan of sausage (either beef, turkey, or chicken), but he said that he really enjoyed the one served here. He also said everything was cooked very well. The biscuit was hard on the outside, but the inside was soft and moist and he enjoyed every bite (it was served with apple butter). He said the entire meal was excellent.(see picture)\\n\\n     Our waitress was very nice and though she was very busy and seemed somewhat rushed, she always smiled, checked on us regularly, and got our food out to us within 10 minutes of us ordering. And the price of the meal was only $12 with my coupon (so $12 for one entree, an added biscuit, and 2 coffees)\\n\\n     I enjoyed my experience here, and recommend it.

This is the kind of place where you expect the rumble of chatter and general stir of excitement to accompany your meal whether you care for it or not.  Fortunately, it worked for me.  \\n\\nWe went inside to request a table, standing awkwardly in a small entrance space before being told we had to wait and promptly marched outside to sit on some painted benches.  Even though it was only a Friday afternoon, there was still a very minor wait.  I can only imagine what a high volume time would be like.\\n\\nI ordered the special that day, which was a three egg scramble with goat cheese, chicken, sundried tomatoes, and spinach.  I got the field greens side salad and a whole wheat biscuit.  I was actually really pleased with the meal as a whole.  The scramble actually contained equal parts of all ingredients listed and was a really delicious even though it was quite simple.  The field greens were fresh and the dressing was the perfect amount although at first glance their didn't appear to be any.\\n\\nI was quite excited about the biscuit as it seemed like it would be the thing to come for, and while I enjoyed it, it was by no means the best biscuit that I've ever had.  It was rather dense and cakey which I kind of happen to like, but it really wasn't the flying fluffy stack that I was expecting considering the logo with the wings that I kept seeing.  I did pass the regular biscuits sitting out on a pan while we were being seated, and I thought they looked a little more white and less golden brown than they should have been as others have noted.  What really brings the biscuit home is the cranberry apple butter.  I didn't think I was going to like it as I don't like jelly very much, but it was very lightly sweet and mildly spicy.  I'd go so far as to say that it's craveable which is something that definitely enhances my view of a restaurant.\\n\\nAnother meal ordered at our table was the tofu and taters salad which was a generous serving of tofu and taters and a not-so-generous serving of wilted (from the heat, not freshness) salad.  Although it sounded good, we'd probably not get that again.  On the other hand, the Vegan BBQ Burrito was great, and a great value as it was massive and tasty.\\n\\nAn additional bonus of this place is that it serves alcoholic beverages and coffee drinks which are pretty good although as busy as the place is, it doesn't seem to promote lingering.\\n\\nAll in all, Flying Biscuit is a place that I would definitely want to go back to again as I enjoyed the ambiance, pace, and the food.

My guest and I did nothing else.  We arrived promptly at our 7:30 reservation time and we were quickly seated.  Sadly, I failed to request a window seat to see the EPCOT fireworks show, because this would be a great location to watch it from.  The staff was attentive, water was always refreshed and bread was routinely delivered, I never went without.  So attentive, in fact, that when I was leaving two hours later, the manager stopped us to remind me that I had an umbrella when I entered the restaurant, which I had forgotten under the table.  I ordered the Maine Lobster soup to start with, and it is potentially the best soup I've ever experienced.  Darn good thing, too, considering the price.  For the entree, I ordered the roast duck, chefs choice on temperature, and my guest ordered the beef tenderloin.  Both were fantastic, tender, tasty, and served in amazing sauces.  I was slightly disappointed by my \\"grated potatoes,\\" which were effectively hash browns.  I suppose I was expecting something more creative, especially after trying my guest's mashed potatoes, which were incredible.  However, though simple, my grated potatoes were still good.  For dessert, I told the waiter to bring us the two most traditional French desserts they offered.  One was the La Vacherin, and I'm not sure what the other was, something with pineapple cake and rum.  The pineapple one was good, though maybe a bit overpowering on the rum, but the Vacherin was extremely good and exactly what I was expecting.  I've been to several of the EPCOT restaurants and I have to say, this very well might be the best one.  Toss up perhaps between here and La Cellier.  \\n\\nSide note, aside from the obvious troll reviews here, I see a few complaints about slow service.  In France, they don't shovel food down as quickly as possible, nor do restaurants rush you out the door to turn tables.  Dinner is supposed to be lingering and enjoyed, with time between courses to cleanse your palate and enjoy company.  This is not the restaurant to go to for a quick dinner and then more rides.  You should probably allocate at least 2 hours to eat at Monsieur Paul properly, and thoroughly enjoy the experience."},{"name":"Kenobi Sushi","address":"10000 Research Blvd, Ste 138A","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Good sushi & sashimi.

The pita was fantastic and tasted like it was fresh out of the oven, and I could not get enough of the tzatziki sauce! Moroccan food has a taste that is a little different than the cuisine of other Mediterranean countries (think: saffron and mint), so don't go expecting Greek food like many other Mediterranean restaurants offer (although there are many recognizable options, such as pita pockets and my personal favorite, baklava). Do, however, expect a meal that is fresh, healthy and delicious.

After a fairly long wait for our food to arrive, my burger and fries were quite good, though there was a LOT of food.

The \\"baby\\" sized bottles of ketchup, mustard and mayo they had on the table were a nice touch and a good conversation piece.\\n\\nThis bar/restaurant feels a bit disjointed, as it's an aviation-themed space, but along with the American aviation bits, much of the decor and accents like parasols and carved statues are decidedly Asian.  They're obviously trying to go with the theme of an American GI bar that's located in the South Pacific during the war.

My best friend and I often come just for the oysters and will often order several orders.\\n\\nI must say that this time, we both were sadly disappointed to find that the HS charbroiled oysters that we ordered were so tiny that you could barely see or taste them. Even the guy that brought them to our table agreed that they were extremely small and initially said that the manager would likely give us a couple of more oysters to make up for the size. If anything, we should have been pre-warned that the oysters were smaller than normal so that we can decide if we wanted to pay full price or just not order them at all upfront.\\n\\nWell, when we mentioned it to our server Darrin, who was great by the way, he was advised by the manager, Erin, to advise us that the oysters were priced at market price and that she could not do anything outside of take them back and remove them from our check. First of all, the oysters were and are always listed as 9.95 per order of six on the menu (not market price). Second of all, we have always gotten nice size oysters when coming here. If anything, in the past if the oysters were running small, they would add on 1-2 more to compensate. \\n\\nWe asked to speak with Erin, again thinking as the manager, she would offer us a better option. We really wanted to enjoy several orders of oysters and were willing to pay for them. She, unfortunately, was not friendly at all and was rather quick and blunt about it stating that the only option was to take the oysters back and not charge us for them. Very disappointing as we just wanted her to be fair. \\n\\nNeedless to say, we went ahead and just paid for the serving, however it was not our usual experience. I went ahead and ordered the whole flounder as my main entr√©e with a cup of she crab soup. The flounder was good, just needed a little more seasoning (7).

Starving and not wanting to wait long we came along this establishment with only a 5 minute wait!  I was a little hesitant at first because of this but figured what the heck.  Bella Vista is small as most restaurants are in the North End with little decoration.  It did have the whole front window opened allowing for the cool air to come through, but we were seated in the back which made it more comfortable for me.  Tje menu offers all your basic Italian meals and prices are very reasonable.  I ordered the veal picatta and had a choice of different pastas with red sauce which I only wish they let me choose a different sauce.  The meal was good and I loved the staff and their humor which all may not appreciate but it gave me the feeling of being at one of my Italian friend's house for dinner with the family which made dining here even more enjoyable.

After Silk closed at this location, it sat empty for a while. Then all of a sudden there was frantic construction going on and a total gutting of the entire space! Warm wood walls and lighting suddenly appeared and it went from a former Japanese modern restaurant (because the restaurant is in a modern glass high rise) to something I just can't describe. Some can say the decor is gaudy and others say it's old school Europe. Whatever the decor categorization, we had to check this place out. \\n\\nKnowing it was a Friday night, we decided to make a reservation. They are not on Open Table. You do have to register in order to make a reservation online. Or you can just simply call them! We were able to get a reservation that same night and we were greeted by friendly smiling faces. We were brought to our table which was more towards the back next to a window looking into the kitchen. The place wasn't overly crowded but it was fairly busy. Our table location was interesting because it ended up being a little tight for the servers to get around. So there was a bit of traffic backup along the aisles. \\n\\nSo here is the rundown:\\n-this restaurant is family style (you will not want to order your own plate!)\\n-menu is highly overwhelming but plenty of options for the super picky diner\\n-staff is very knowledgable about the menu items. So ask for recommendations!\\n-there is no bread service. There is a selection of breads that are really good for $4. We felt it was worth it. You can also get the oil to accompany. The oil was crazy good!! It was infused with herbs and peppers. So it had a bit of a spicy kick! \\n-wine list is decent and they have three beers on tap. Thankfully one of them is Sweetwater 420. \\n-all servers take orders down on this little mini handheld tablet. They use this also to swipe your credit card. \\n\\nWe ordered the salad with crab stuffed salmon roll. The carmelized tomato halves were interesting. Overall good flavor. You have your choice of dressing. We opted for the aged balsamic and OMG it was soooooo good! My husband couldn't get enough of the dressing alone. The salad was enough for two people to share. I can't imagine one person eating that entire plate unless it's their entree. They only had one vegetarian friendly salad option. \\n\\nThe pasta ordered was the ricotta with seasonal vegetable ravioli. It's called the Ravioli Nero and the pasta is actually made with squid ink. I've never had pasta made out of squid ink but we decided to give it a try. The sauce to accompany was Pescatora which is seafood in a cream sauce. Really wished there was more seafood. We only got one tiny scallop and one shrimp. So a little disappointed with that. But the ravioli was really good and the portion size is generous. The nice thing about this place is that you can do whichever combination of pastas and sauces. So you can be adventurous. \\n\\nGive this place a try if you're on the fence. It's worth checking out. A bit of warning - it is a bit pricey but you are getting a lot of food for the price. This isn't the Olive Garden!!! All staff was really nice and we are looking forward to going back to try other pasta and sauce combinations!"},{"name":"Jimmy John's","address":"2941 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"Whoever baked the bread today- you're killing it!

The place was decently busy and we were lucky to not wait too long as a couple had just left. We were seated between two 2 person tables and it was a tight squeeze. I get that the restaurant is probably going for an intimate atmosphere and Beacon Hill property is expensive, but when the chair is vibrating because of the person sitting behind you is speaking, it's too tiny. I also got elbowed several times during the course of dinner. \\n\\nWe were given our menus and decided pretty quickly on what we wanted: half fig and prosciutto and half eggplant. The waitress had left and hadn't noticed that we were ready, so we waited a good 7 minutes - a long wait considering the restaurant wasn't /that/ busy and the average time spent looking at a menu is 27 seconds - before she came back to take our order. Also, she asked us if we wanted bread or not while taking our order. Typically, bread is a given and should always be served with or soon after the water is filled. Usually not a big deal, but since we were starving and already impatient to place our order, it was more frustrating than usual.\\n\\nThe bread was decent, if way too filling. The olive oil has a strong taste. Our pizza arrived within 10 minutes of the bread and was generously sized. We ate 5 slices and boxed the remaining 3. The bill came out to around 28 dollars including tip, so each slice averaged 3.5 dollars, which is very reasonable. \\n\\nAll in all, the food is pretty good if you're looking for thin crust artisan pizza without too much oil, but the small interior and sub-par service are a deterrent.

It must be the best thing in the restaurant because everyone is taking pictures of these awesome chicken wings. They also have some carpaccio which they call it butter beef and luc lac which is shaken beef or in english beef in some sauce. \\n\\nWe had to wait about 10 minutes for our table. Thankfully, we were after the lunch hour rush so the wait time was not that bad as we thought. My friend ordered the large order of chicken wings at $15 while I just needed some lemon grass chicken. \\n\\nThe food came out and my friend was having the wings. From what he was telling me, he basically said the wings were a hit and miss. Some of the wings had no flavour and some of them had flavour. I was worried if their reputation is starting to decrease a bit since they were cutting food from their plates. He did tell me that he was a person that enjoys a stronger flavour, but he has said that the wings were in the top 10 which is a good sign...\\n\\nMeanwhile, I ordered the chicken and shredded pork with rice. I was surprised but relieved they served it with long grain jasmine rice instead of the traditional short grain rice. There was good amount of lemongrass in the chicken and the nuoc mam sauce was perfect along side with the sweet and spiciness for the meat. \\n\\nSo you ask why does this get a 1 star review. So, after I paid cash, I kid you not, the cashier was looking at me with shifty eyes. The waitress gave me the change and I noticed something was not right.

First off, their servers were slow and hard to find. We had to get up our seats and look for their servers every time we had a request just to always find them hiding behind the bar. Being there were only 1 other group eating when we came should indicate that they would have been more attentive to their customers but no, they would rather hide. Secondly, their food was way too overpriced compared to the quantity of the food. Ive been to many filipino restaurants and by far this is the first time i had to compain about food servings since most filipino restaurants tend to have big servings. Our $90 bill was wayy too much for the amount of food that we got. Lastly, the taste of their food just cant compare to other filipino restaurant. I honestly believe that they should get a better cook in that place. The taste of their food is just lacking flavour and bland. Their lumpia tasted old and undercooked. Their bistek tagalog was hard to chew and there were barely any meat in it, it was mostly onions. I really dont recommend this place because going here would be a waste of time and money.

This was the first time we went to this restaurant and had high hopes to finally have found a decent, and not over-priced, Indian restaurant. This was not it.\\n\\nThe decor was almost fluorescent blue and the lighting was inadequate for the darkness of winter. We're not old, but it was too dim to read the menus easily. \\n\\nWe ordered a vegetable curry and a chicken tikka masala. The curry was described on the menu as having an assortment of vegetables.  What arrived at our table was a bowl of sauce with four small pieces of over cooked, unidentifiable vegetable slices. My wife and I split the pieces of vegetables up...two each. I thought, the tikka masala will probably be better. It looked appetizing with its deep red hue. That was about the best part. The sauce tasted like tomato sauce with some Indian spices added in. There were six 1 inch cubes of chicken. \\n\\nI usually think the portion sizes should be less at restaurants. I personally think the large portion sizes are are contributing to our obesity problem, but I had the opposite reaction at this restaurant.  The portions at India Grill are equivalent to most appetizers at other restaurant's.

Our experience there, despite being in a rush to catch a comedy show, was not the least bit disappointing!  \\n\\nBeing new to European/Swiss cuisine, we were not sure exactly what to expect or really what to order.  Our beautiful and friendly server Chelsea (sp?) was gave us a great overview of the specials of the evening and answered our questions about the regular menu very well, with very good understanding of the ingredients in the dishes we asked about.  She was very approachable and would come in to check on how we were doing outside and gave us our space to enjoy the meal.\\n\\nThe hot potato and leek soup was good as we sat outside and it was a bit chilly.  The soup had good flavour, but wasn't as thick and hearty as I would've liked.  The side salad was cold and crispy, the dressing was just right.  Simple with a good acid balance.\\n\\nWe ordered the goulash/spatzle as well as the bratwurst/rosti.  The spatzle was super tasty - seasoned beautifully and browned nicely. Lots of flavour in those little dumplings.  The goulash was deliciously light, a tiny bit saltier than I would've liked but bold in flavour.\\n\\nThe bratwurst was probably one of the juiciest sausages I have ever had.  Meaty but not gamy with a great texture - the casing wasn't too thick.  The rosti (potato hash) was a great complement with the juicy bratwurst and sauteed onions as well.  Both great recommendations by Chelsea.  We tried the mustard that was offered to us (in a cute little tube) with the bratwurst, but it didn't taste like any real special type of mustard - just less sharp than your typical hotdog mustard.  The bratwurst and sauteed onions were delicious by themselves and didn't need it.\\n\\nOverall, service was excellent - you felt like they treat you as if you're family. Food was fantastic as well.

I like watching people cook and would rather sit here than at one of the other tables.\\n\\nThe menu is varied and I have never seen it repeat.  The concept is a lot like dim sum.  The chefs prepare an appetizer size dish and then personally bring it around to all the tables.  If it is something you want, they give you a dish of it.  If you don't want it, you pass.  You only pay for the dishes you want.  Be careful though, it can get expensive fast if you aren't careful.  We usually plan out which ones we know we definitely want and then have a couple we want to see first.  The idea of a single appetizer size plate being shared by two or three sounds like you will starve, but honestly we were getting full before we had seen everything come out.\\n\\nIf you have a large party, they create more of a platter size of each of the dishes for a family style plate.\\n\\nMy ownly complaint are the desserts.

Here's what we ordered: \\n\\n- Crispy calamari appetizer \\n- Wagyu steak frites \\n- Filet mignon a la carte \\n- Seared sea scallops\\n\\nI was very pleased with everything we tried - I'm always impressed when calamari is actually better without the sauce on the side.

All of the meat dishes seemed to come with the standard bone marrow butter, which to be honest, I didn't care for - I couldn't taste the difference between it and the normal butter I use at home (maybe less salty?) and I thought the steak/butter combination was a bit odd. Is it just me? Who eats their steak with a side of butter? \\n\\nThe Wagyu was my favorite dish by far - our waiter described it as \\"similar to American Kobe beef\\" and I thought it was delicious - it had a fairly large grain (wasn't as tender as my brother's filet mignon) but was unbelievably tasty. It came with a side of truffle-oil fries, which had a subtle but noticeable hint of added flavor. \\n\\nDesserts: \\n- Chocolate stout cake \\n- Strawberry rhubarb tart \\n\\nThe chocolate cake was so-so. The strawberry tart may be a seasonal item, as I don't see it on their regular menu - but it was fantastic. Let's put it this way - I ate about half of mine, and while my mom was too ashamed to ask for a separate take-away container, she did try to surreptitiously sneak the rest of it into our existing take-away bag.

So I am baffled at an experience that my wife and I just had at Bella Vista. We stopped in at 10:00 to order a plate of pasta and a couple of potential drinks and desserts. We had a long fantastic day visiting (first time to Boston) and had eaten dinner earlier at Parish Cafe Boston(fantastic food and service!).  We stopped in to Bella Vista after our journey to the North End because we were hungry for a late bite. Bella Vista was very dark when we walked in. We ordered a plate of pasta to split and have a couple glasses of wine. However everything was cut short. Before the last word of our order came out of my wife's mouth, our server quickly grabbed the menu's out of of our hands and said that us being there was a waste of her time (she used the F word) and that we had to order an entree each - and then abruptly left. Needless to say we have never been treated this way before in a restaurant, and were left there at the table baffled and embarrassed as if we had done something wrong. My wife had the manners to go up to her and explain that we would order two entrees and take one home, but the server was extremely rude and told us to go to a competitor's establishment (which will go unnamed) which would \\"serve us late.\\"  The server was an older woman with short black hair and an Italian accent. \\n\\nI'm appalled and extremely offended at how we were treated in terms of a customer-restaurant experience.

So, needless to say, I don't hit this sort of place up all too frequently. But sometimes I want to feel fancy, so this is where I go. I should go more often.\\n\\nFirst off, you walk in and look at the left hand wall, and it's like a wino's wet dream come true. I think there were bottles of wine up there that don't even actually exist. I don't think all of these wines are available by the glass, but if there's more than one of you and you're going to a wine bar and you're not ordering at least one bottle, well, you're a dork.\\n\\nThe food is also pretty tasty, although I don't usually eat a lot in one sitting. So, I usually just get the buffalo sliders. I also get them because they are friggin' awesome. \\n\\nBut the main reason to go to Vino Vino more than anything else is the service.

Teradactyl is my FAVORITE and Jumbo's did the flavor combo justice.  The chicken was battered to perfection and smothered in sauce that wasn't runny and really clung to the meat.  The Italian was pretty standard but absolutely stuffed and did the trick for my hangover.  I ordered via Foodler and my order came promptly and correctly while the tenders were still steaming.\\n\\nMy ONLY gripes: \\n\\n-The cheese on the steak bomb was a liiiiiiitttttle too runny, but that's a personal preference.\\n\\n-If it were my shop, I'd probably opt for a sturdier sandwich bread.

Portion sizes are quite large within their Family Dinner Selection, big surprise.  Food was brought out quickly and very fresh tasting.  For those people who prefer stronger flavoring, this is not the place since the Cantonese style used here is more of an emphasis on freshness and light on the seasonings.

I ordered shau mai because I was trying to order something that isn't too calorific to go with my 500 calorie beverage.  They came fast and were oddly reminiscent of gefilte fish in color, consistency, and flavor.  I will pass on gefilte fish in wonton skin on my next trip.  There was a drink on the menu that boasted 5 different kind of liquor that was calling my name, but coconut cream was one of the ingredients.  I asked the waiter if it was very creamy (i can deal with a 500 calorie drink, but a 1000 calorie drink is pushing it...) and he said that it wasn't.  So I ordered it and this pina colada looking thing was dropped in front of me.  Whaaaat?  The waiter was kind enough to swap it out for a delicious mai tai.  \\n\\nI finish my gefilte-mai and we want to dance so we ask for our check. It comes and I drop a $20 in there and my friend puts her card in.  The waiter takes the $20 and charges my friend the full amount on her card.  Seriously??  I spend several minutes trying to track him down before I finally asked another waiter to resolve the situation.\\n\\nSo we are clearly headed into two star territory here, where did these other 2 stars come from you may ask?  Why from the sketchy ass dance floors and the middle aged DJ pumping delightfully cheesy beats, of course!  (holla at me Miley Cyrus!)  This was sketchy beyond words in the most amazing way.  We enjoyed dancing our pants off and watching the spectacle around us for quite a while.  Around 1:15 we left to join a disgraced friend at another bar, and I think it was a good time to make an exit because more orange skinned women in trashy clothes than I have ever seen (excluding Bravo TV shows and the Lohan family) were swarming in. \\n\\nI must have said \\"I love the Golden Temple\\" at least 10 times last night, so I will return for more mai tais and fewer gefilte-mais."},{"name":"Mooo Restaurant","address":"15 Beacon St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Best steak house!!!!

We showed up approximately an hour late for our reservation. Luckily some of our party of 10 was on time and had been ordering appetizers, etc. We arrived to some snarky comments about our lateness that were in poor taste. It's hard to accept these comments when the restaurant is not even close to full capacity on a Friday night. Our waiter Christian was friendly and boasted Charley's famous steaks elevating the excitement. We ordered several of the filet mignon specials and sides among other things. Unfortunately, my steak, which was ordered medium rare , was received as medium well. I typically do not like to complain of meat temperature at casual restaurants but a steak house MUST get the temperature right in my mind. They cooked me a new steak. It was juicy and the edges were a nice medium rare. However, when I cut through the center it was raw, and still COLD! Christian dropped the ball here. He had a chance to make things right but fell short. I think a visit from the manager would have been appropriate. Overall I feel like Christian did the minimum necessary to serve us (guaranteed 18% gratuity played a role here?). Some other complaints to note:\\n- we had to request a kids menu more than once \\n- we had to request a car seat sling multiple times \\n- there was no offering of fresh pepper or cheese on our salads and Christian was MIA during our salads\\n\\nChristian stated that Charley's was once a top five steak house in America.

I want to feel warm and loved and all gooey inside.  I want to leave in a better mood then when I arrived.  I do not go out to eat to have someone challenge the validity of a food allergy, to belittle me through my lack of knowledge on proper bread plate placement, or to generally feel like shit about yourself/life.   \\n\\nLike River R. I too had the oh so lovely privilege of being served by the weird/scary bald waiter man.  I couldn't help but think \\"mobster\\" the entire time (Cash and American Express only?  Somethings fishy).  Where did he go wrong...\\n(in chronological order)\\n1.  My mom wanted to share one of the lunch specials with my sister after confirming that the ginormous plate of pasta a man at the next table over had was the lunch portion.  The waiter almost refused, declaring \\"Boston looks down on sharing\\" but lucky for us he decided he'd forgive us and allow it.  Thanks for helping you cut down on wasted food?\\n2.  I asked if I could order the eggplant parm without cheese.  Reply: Absolutely not.  I told him that I am allergic to milk.  Matter of factly he stated, \\"you're lactose intolerant.\\"  \\"No, I'm allergic.\\"  Even more strongly, \\"You're lactose intolerant.\\"  \\"No, it's different.\\"  I gave him a brief explanation, to which he came back with a skeptical \\"Huh.  That's a new one.\\"  It was horrible, and I nearly cried.  He was a very scary man.\\n3.  When he brought out our entrees, I pushed my bread plate higher up in front of me to make room for the enormous slop that was about to be given to me.  Weird mean waiter man grabbed my bread plate and slammed it down in the correct spot, muttering \\"BREAD GOES ON THE RIGHT\\" in that yelling-whisper voice.\\n4.  Since he refused to give me a piece of eggplant without cheese on it, I defaulted to the totally blah choice of pasta with marinara.  It's hard to get that wrong.  When the 1lb. serving came, I noticed what looked like cheese bits in the sauce.  I couldn't specifically taste cheese, but my sister agreed that it looked like the type of parmesan sits out on the table.  The horrendous upset stomach I got a half hour later agreed.  I almost wish I had eaten more of it and had a stronger reaction so I could have thrown up on him in the restaurant.  \\n5.  Towards the end he tried to make small talk with my dad.  Somewhere along the way it was made-known that my parents were visiting from California.  Mobster man made some blanket statement that I'm 99% sure cannot possible be true about how \\"ALL the greeks and italians in california came from boston\\" and when my dad politely responded \\"you're probably right,\\" the waiter shot back \\"i know i'm right.\\"  He then proceeded to give a whole (unwelcomed) talk on the history of Greeks/Italians in California.\\n\\nI liked the cute, cozy atmosphere including all the entire wall of wine and the glass purses in the front window.  But seriously, worst. dining. ever.  I'm still all panicky and anxiety-riden even in recounting such trauma for this review.  \\n\\n**Absolutely DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU HAVE ANY FOOD ALLERGIES!!!

Not exactly intimate or romantic.   \\n\\nWe started with a martini each while we started looking through the menu, but it was ages before they finally arrived at our table, to the point where I almost said something.  I started with the crabcakes while my boyfriend ordered the fish chowder, which took less time to get to the table than the drinks did.  The chowder was excellent, and we consider ourselves to be chowder aficionados.  The crabcakes, however, were almost inedible.  They were extremely overcooked, even slightly blackened on the outside and totally dry and bland. \\n \\nThe wine list is IMMENSE, but thankfully our server was well versed in their selection and helped us pick something suitable for our meal selection.  For dinner we ordered ala carte, lamb for me and New York strip for him, along with mashed potatoes, pommes frites with truffle oil and asparagus on the side to share.  Wow, what a waste, the sides were bigger than our meals, you'd think they might mention something like that.  The New York was pretty good, cooked the way it was ordered, but still no better than a million other places you could get it.  The lamb, like the crabcakes, were overcooked (I just couldn't catch a break!), and really not that tasty.  Lamb is one of my all time favorite foods and I want it to taste like lamb, the added sauces and spices should complement the flavor not conquer it.  \\n\\nFor dessert we got one cr√®me brulee to share, another favorite of mine that I order everywhere I find it.  It was just your basic vanilla flavor with berries, completely uninteresting and lacking in the sugar department.  Overall very blas√©.  \\n\\nThe one saving grace was the service.  It was very formal, but not pretentious at all.  Our server was a very funny guy, with a sharp dry wit and entertaining personality which helped us stomach the food.  They replaced my boyfriend's napkin when he went to the bathroom, marked everything properly and crumbed as needed, but that should only be expected in an establishment like this.  \\n\\nI'm paying for more than just good conversation here though, and Grill 23 didn't offer me anything else.  There is too much competition for steakhouses out there and they fell very short.\\n\\nOverall it was overpriced, overcooked, overly bright, overly loud and completely disappointing."},{"name":"Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET","address":"1110 W 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Aaron was so great!!!

The selection of chocolates presents itself with an arrangement of handcrafted beautiful designs, colors and simplicity. Just ahead of the case is the beverage bar and dessert case. Past the beverage bar is more seating, restroom and another entrance. \\n\\nCustomers have the option of buying a pre-made box or build your own box. I rather build my own box (4, 12 & 16 ct is a available) for myself and as gifts. This way I can truly pick what I or they like. Each chocolate has its own price anywhere from $2.00-$3.00. I always pick up any sea salt Carmels or dark chocolate truffles (favorites) for me. I have also tried other pieces as well. Moonstruck makes amazing chocolates. It's so good and rich. \\n\\nOne of my favorite times to go is during a holiday week/season which is when the holiday pieces are presented. I was there yesterday and I saw a Frankenstein head, aliens, pumpkins, bats and a few other ones. A couples years back after Christmas the seasonal chocolates were still there and it was 50% off. Needless to say, I purchased a belated Christmas gift. \\n\\nMoonstruck is conveniently located in a shopping area of a Fred Meyer and Olive Garden landmarks. There is plenty of ample parking and they don't close until 10pm on weekdays. This means if you need a quick fix on chocolates, desserts, gift or a drink Moonstruck will help.

I was given a delivery estimate of 50 minutes later, which was fine. That's pretty normal for a Sunday around lunch time. I never received an updated time estimate, and an hour and ten minutes later, I called Cambridge Coffee & Pizza Shop. Not only was I immediately put on \\"hold\\" (which consisted of the person answering the phone to rudely slam the phone down on a counter surface so I can hear him talking to other people), but when he picked the phone back up, he was not apologetic for our order being late. He told us they were very busy, proceeded to put me on \\"hold\\" again while I sat and listened to him talking in the background for a good 5 minutes. The only reason I stayed on the line was because I was very hungry and wanted my food. He then picked up the phone again and told me my food was with the driver and he would call him and make sure he delivered my food soon. I started to speak and he rudely put me on \\"hold\\" again. Our food did not come until another HOUR later. It took 2.5 hours to get our food. This is a lesson to me, because I ALWAYS read reviews, but for some reason didn't look this place up before we ordered.

To start with, the grounds and building are breathtaking.  At night the outside is lit up with white lights that gives it a whimsical feeling.  The inside of the restaurant was a little interesting to me.  To say it was dated is an understatement.  Don't get me wrong, it is beautiful inside, but the dark wood, hunter green carpet,  and floral printed chairs gives the impression that you have just stepped into a 1970s smokers lounge. \\n\\nAttire: I also must mention that my husband and I were the youngest people in the restaurant by at least 10 years (we are 28/29).  The attire is marked as \\"casual\\" on yelp, but to be honest, about 1/3 of the men had on dinner jackets and the women had on skirts.  Then again, this was the old crowd.  I felt a little under dressed in dark jeans and heels.  \\n\\nFood: Now on to the good stuff, FOOD!  It was outstanding.  I had the classic caesar salad.  It was lightly dressed, but full of flavor.  My husband has the film duck.  He ate it so quickly that I didn't even get a bite.  For dinner, the braised short rib had a strong flavor but was the most tender meat I have ever eaten.  I was not a huge fan of the fried palenta.  It did not have much flavor, and with the seasonings of the short rib, the side really needed to pop a little.  My husband ordered the \\"soda pop\\" pork.  It was marinated in root beer, which gave it a sweet and warm seasoning atop mashed potatoes.  This too he almost inhaled before I could get a bite.  It was tender and sweet and full of flavor.  Lastly, for dessert.  The creme br√ªl√©e was classic with reduced pear slices and honey comb onto.  The husband had a pear tart w/ creme fraiche ice cream.  It had the homey spices of nutmeg and cinnamon.  At the end of dessert, we both wanted to lick our plates. \\n\\nWine: As for the wine, the list is extremely impressive.  I settled for a $11 glass of Conn Creek Sauvignon Blanc.  They had about 1 page of wine by the glass, with a large novel of wine by the bottle, with the least expensive starting at around $30.  \\n\\nIf you can afford it for a special occasion, I highly recommend it.

My husband went to open the bill holder to look at the bill to see what the total amount owed was and to make sure the bill was accurate.  He opened the bill holder and picked up the receipt.  To our surprise, the server ripped the bill from his hand and held onto it while she entered the amount owed into the  card reader.  Then she put the receipt back in the bill folder, grabbed my husband's credit card and put it in the terminal. Then she handed the terminal to my husband and hovered over him, looking annoyed and impatient waiting for him to finish the transaction.  The restaurant was not busy so I'm not sure why she was so irritated. Was she offended that my husband wanted to look at the itemized bill?  He was so shocked and felt so pressured that he didn't look at the bill and just approved the charge on the terminal.

Not sure of the bad reviews on here but this is pretty authentic Thai food! \\n\\nThe way I review a Thai restaurant is based on their sticky rice.  \\nSticky rice is a staple of Thai cuisines as well as several other South East Asian Countries (Laos/Cambodia).  When one grows up eating Sticky Rice, he/she will know if that rice is made fresh or if it was cooked earlier & warmed prior to serving.  NOT THIS PLACE!!  My sticky rice was FRESH!!  Therefore Thai Boo Boo, I am your #1 fan!!  For those other restaurants who do not, please take notice rom Thai Boo Boo!! \\n\\nAlso, if you own a Thai restaurant and do not have Papaya Salad on your menu, then you CAN NOT call yourself a Thai restaurant!  Thai Boo Boo has Papaya Salad!  Another Win!!! \\n\\nIn my honest opinion Papaya Salad is the staple of Thai cuisines ....like how pasta is to Italian cuisines.  Imagine an Italian restaurant without pasta on their menu...same concept.  There is one other Thai restaurant near the area, won't mention the name, but feel free to read my review on that one!!\\n\\nNot only does Thai Boo Boo has papaya salad, they have a rating scale!!  Rate your own spiciness on a level of 1 through 5.  1 is equivalent to very mild and 5 is super spicy!!  First time I was there i had the 5!  Wow, be careful!  if you're new to papaya salad - try a one instead & move your way up!  \\n\\nReally sad to see there was no chicken wings on the menu, however, Chicken Satay was outrageously good!  \\n\\nIf you're local and live in this area, it is really a gem! Try it out! One of the things they offer is a discount card where you can get it stamped each time you order a entree.  After 5 or so entrees, you get your next one free!  How cool is that?!!\\n\\nI would love to meet the owner! Not sure if you cater, but it will be great if you did!\\n\\nThe 4-5 times we've been here, our server is the sweetest!

Low lighting, surprisingly comfortable wooden chairs and tables, and music that was not too loud or too soft. \\n\\nThe prices have gone up, and we found that the best value was to order a bottle of wine for the group, rather than by the glass.

He was the only one that was interested in dinner later.\\n\\nWe chatted with the owner for a bit. He is a super nice guy who really wants to provide options for vegans. He has done an amazing job.

The ambience is noisy and hectic but the service is extremely attentive (albeit currently with numerous experienced wait personnel from other FdC franchises in other sites in the USA).  The $50 prix fixe experience includes a nice, expansive salad bar, where you should plan to fill up on charcuterie, bread, lox, cheeses, and a wide assortment of fresh veggies and salads.  There is also a delicious prawn cocktail which is an additional $19.  Thereafter the experience falls apart.  Meat should be the centerpiece of a Brazilian restaurant and they do offer 16 different cuts.  Turn your little marker from red to green and you will be repeatedly offered different pieces of beef, pork, chicken, and lamb.  Many of these will already be a little cool from having been paraded around the dining room prior to arriving at your table.  The very attentive servers will ask how well done you like your meat and then confidently cut you a piece that could be anything from rare to well done no matter what you had requested.  Two of the cuts I received were so bad and so tough I actually had to spit them out..I haven't done that since I was a child!  It is a sad commentary on a Brazilian steak restaurant when the best part of the meal was a chicken leg.  The side dishes were also mediocre.  Bland mashed potatoes and polenta sticks were also served nearly cold.  The fried bananas were good but, c'mon, we're eating steak here.  Dessert was good: papaya cream and carmelized pineapple were delicious.  Overall, this is a good place for salad and dessert...but terrible for steak.

I understand a chef has their idea regarding how a steak should be prepared and this is often medium-rare to medium (I agree). However, the four people at the table that ordered steak asked for medium-well (or hockey pucks). The steaks all ranged from medium-rare to medium. As a chef, if the patron wants to murder their steak by cooking it to near jerky, then you do it.

I told him the next time I was having a Sushi attack I would do come by. Friday I let him know I would be by on Saturday for lunch, unaware they open at 4:30 on Saturday, and Chef AB let me know the hours. I told him I would be by and gave him a basic idea of what we like and left it up to him what to serve us. Personally I love being surprised with food.\\n\\nWe arrived a few minutes before they opened and saw him standing out out back. After introducing ourselves he told me about himself and the restaurant. I could have chatted with him all afternoon but we all headed inside. Since we were the first to arrive I took advantage of the place being empty and took some pictures before sitting down at the sushi bar. Chef AB let our server know that we did not need menus and he took our drink orders after giving us hot towels to clean our hands. Saki for my wife and Iced Tea for me. (No Lime for my tea)\\n\\nWe were brought a bean sprout starter and I really liked it. Fresh sprouts lightly dressed with sesame seeds. Next was a Tuna Roll and the presentation was stunning. Next was a plate of Sashimi Roses. Next was a Sushi Carpaccio. Next was a popular roll I forgot to ask the name of. Next was some Octopus and last was some Sashimi topped with a thin slice of Jalapeno. \\n\\nLet me just say that ALL of them were fresh and delicious. A few of the dishes are things I would not normally order because I am not a huge fan of sushi topped with sauces but that seems to be what is popular with other people. But I have to admit that the Carpaccio won me over. When I first looked at it I was not sure what to think but it had me on the first bite. The Octopus was also a hit with me and flavor wise was a hit with the wife but she does not like the texture of octopus. \\n\\nOne of the regulars sat to the left of my wife and others were coming in as we dined. Chef AB seems to have a great rapport with his guests and many seemed to be regulars. The service the others were receiving around us was great and one thing I noticed was the attention to details many other places miss. Starting off with the hot towels for example is something many other places have gotten away from and I don't understand why.\\n\\nThis place is a hit with me and I will definitely be returning.

A few minutes later, the Sheriff comes over and appologizes that he has to do so, but asks me to leave. Again he thanked me for the way I handled the situation, but that the manager or owner had expressed his desire for me to leave. Being that it was private property the Sheriff had to honor the requests of the establishment.\\n\\nI finshed my beer, tossed the bottle, and calmly exited the building. As I am walking through this maze of a parking lot I turn around to find the manager or owner (a shorter fella with dark hair) has quietly made his way out to the parking lot behind me. He awkwardly asks if I was okay and if I would like to come back in. By this time, I was fuming a bit over being tossed out for no good reason, so I declined his offer quite vehemently (something along the lines of  \\"Fuck, no! Why would I want to come back in!?\\"), which he seemed to have the nerve to take personally?\\n\\nIn the words of the late, great Rick James (care of Dave Chappelle) \\"I've been kicked out of nicer places than this!,\\" so I wasn't so much upset about being asked to leave as I was at the fact that out of loyalty my four buddies left as well even though I was the one that was specifically asked to leave.\\n\\nIn hindsight it is quite hilarious, but at the time I was so turned off by this incident. Needless to say I never once went back to Sam's Boat.\\n\\nI give them one star because later...much, much later I did get a good laugh out of their ass-backwards way of handling a conflict and it does make for a funny story years later."},{"name":"Black Rooster Taqueria","address":"1323 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent fresh homemade tacos and fresh guac!

We chose Fogo De Choa for our anniversary dinner. Decided to go all out. Passed on the \\"Portland dinning month\\" special and opted for the full experience. Huge mistake. We checked in for our reservation and were seated right next to the market table. It took 15 minutes for someone to greet us. 4 waiters walked by us....4! Not a word. Just as we were about to walk out someone came up. I regret asking my husband to be patient. He explained to us how things worked and took our drink orders and set us free. We went to the market table twice but both times all plates and bowls were pretty much empty. Huge disappointment. The meats. Almost everything was over cooked and lacked flavor. After a while it just all tasted the same because there was nothing wowing the meat. Getting someone to stop was hard enough because of our seating. Not to mention the couple next to us doing the Portland dinning month special was getting the same cuts we were when we were told premium cuts were off with that special. Waiters around us were asking if guests were celebrating anything, ours did not. By the end of our \\"meal\\" we were over it and decided to not bother.

The decor is very nice. It reminds me of a few places that I've been to in California and Las Vegas. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. I wish I could give separate reviews for food and service, because he certainly deserves more than one star. However, the food was abysmal.\\n\\nWe started off with edamame and the lobster gyoza. The edamame was pretty good, but really, how difficult is it to cook soybeans? I'm sure my four-year-old daughter could pull it off successfully. The lobster gyoza left something to be desired. I assumed I would taste the sweetness of the lobster and shrimp, contrasted with the tangy flavor of the goat cheese. What we received were dumplings with an overly-cooked exterior, and a soggy, fishy interior.\\n\\nIn fact, the theme of the night was \\"fishy-flavor.\\"\\n\\nWe next ordered two rolls, and six pieces of sushi. Our rolls were the lickety split, and the caterpillar roll. Our individual pieces of sushi were the unagi (fresh water eel), hotate (scallop), and hokkigai (red tip clam). \\n\\nOur food was delivered promptly, and looked very good. Their presentation was very nice. We started with the caterpillar roll. It was very mushy on the inside, and had a distinct fishy taste to it. The avocado was pretty thin, and a bit slimy. We next tried the lickety split. While it looked great, it suffered from the same fishy and mushiness we experienced with the caterpillar roll. The only thing that saved it were the two end pieces. They seemed to actually have all of the ingredients in it. It still had a fishy flavor, but it wasn't mushy.\\n\\nAfter a break, so I could wash the fishy taste from my mouth with a nice cold Kirin, we got to work on our pieces of sushi. We opted for the hokkigai. I've never had it before, so I really had no idea what to expect. It didn't really have any flavor to it, and it was very chewy. The soy sauce helped to add some flavor to it. We next tried the hotate, which is usually a favorite of ours. The scallop was fairly bland, and they added a dollop of something on the top that really ruined it for me. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't fantastic either. We finished off with the unagi, which is my favorite. This really solidified it for me. The unagi was horrible. It was spongy, and fishy. It was like eating canned tuna.\\n\\nI'm really not sure how this place can receive more than two stars from anyone. Either those people work at Kenobi, or they were so drunk that their taste buds shut down. There is no excuse for poor quality fish. I understand that some places might have a bad night. Perhaps the rice is a little dry, or a bit too moist. Perhaps the rolls just won't stay together. That's understandable, and if your food is fresh and tasty, most people will overlook those things. However, it is impossible to overlook fish that is that low quality. I've honestly had better from HEB. Hell, I've been to DK's Lamar location, and watched him cook up some unagi on a glorified toaster oven, and it was the best damned unagi I've ever had. If he can do it, Kenobi can do it too. They need to focus less on building a trendy atmosphere, and focus on making quality food."},{"name":"The Thirsty Gator","address":"3040 N Goldenrod Rd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Came here with a group of friends simply because we wanted some Oysters.

There is a menu of about 12 items, all small plates that are shareable. The chefs will bring the plates around to the long community tables as they are done and describe them. You have to be prepared to decide right then and there if you want that dish or not. If you pass it up, it won't come back to your table. The dishes change regularly, so there's not a lot of point in describing them individually, but there is a good variety; the night we were there, selections included octopus, short ribs, grouper, rabbit (delicious as a hot dog!), and a lovely grilled vegetable salad. Most of what we had was spectacular, the rest a mere very good. Most dishes run somewhere around the $15-$20 range. \\n\\nThis is best done in groups of two or four. Many more people than that would get unwieldy and heaven help you trying to figure out seating and sharing logistics for odd-numbered groups.

Had I known about this feature of their brick and mortar, I'd have supported their business many a time, in those wee hours. Hopefully they'll consider tryihng this tactic again at least seasonally (Summer will be here before too long...).\\n\\nAfter having had so much sub-par BBQ these past few months in Southern ORegon, central Oregon, and here in the Metro area, I was beside myself to finally get ahold of these folks on a  day they had brisket in stock. My oh my, was that worth the wait! Some folks might complain about the thickness of the fat sheath on top, but bear in mind, that's where the meat gets most of its natural flavor, and juiciness! The way so many places cook brisket, you'd think it was a mortal sin to retain any juiciness in the beef! OUTSTANDING brisket, Crown Q. Very nicely done.\\n\\nIts only been a couple weeks and I can't remember much about the rest of the food we got here-- the hot links, the chicken, the pulled pork were all ok but just that. The sides (collard greens, principally), again, ok but nothing I'd be in a rush or go out of my way to get anytime soon.\\n\\nThe fish (thank you for at least offering fish on the menu), they completely forgot to place in our large carry out group order. It wasn't possible to come back and grab the fish, as we weren't done at work til after CQ was closed. No effort was made to bring the fish to us, or reduce the credit card bill.

I set out to find a sit down restaurant online just because I was tired of the cafeteria type offerings of many of the other places. We got seated nearly instantly and were left to ponder over the menu for several minutes as they were packed so it was a pinch long to get our drinks but once our very polite sever did greet us, it was wonderful from that moment on.\\n\\nWe placed our orders, I chose the Irish Cobb Salad where our waitress praised their in house made Italian vinaigrette as well as getting me the mustard sauce for the scotch egg that comes in the salad on the side. My significant other ordered the Shepard's pie while mentioning he knows how it is when it's busy as he is a chef as it was nearly packed at around 1 in the afternoon. She came back with the soda bread with apple butter which was scrumptious. Not even two minutes after that were our meals placed in front of us. Both of us not only enjoyed our own meals but each others. The only complaint I can even muster up was I had a pretty big raw onion piece in my salad.\\n\\n We were so pleased by the service and food quality that ordered Apple Raisin Bread Pudding to share. It was incredible how light such a normally dense dessert was. Not too sweet and very satisfying. Fast, efficient, polite staff, wonderful food, and very well priced. The decor is quaint.

We first got the tip off with Urban Farmer because there was a coupon for a few free things during happy hour. Since we stayed on the same floor as the restaurant (8th floor) we were just able to walk around the corner to enjoy our food.\\n\\nThe coupons were for their sliders, which are absolutely sinful. A beef slider as well as a fried chicken/waffle slider with hot sauce and honey (please tell me you're drooling). Instead of a bun, it was two little triangle waffle halves. Incredibly adorable and quite delicious. I crave in constantly, along with many other things from Urban Farmer.\\n\\nWe got the sliders off the lounge menu and they had really nice cocktail options as well (I remember because my boyfriend took a picture of the menu to send to his drink enthusiast buddy). However, we had the pleasure of having the room service come from Urban Farmer as well, but you pay a hefty price for this little gold star. In the morning, I got a Farm Vegetable Fritatta and it came with a morning salad which had the most scrumptious dressing I've had in a long, long time. It was a simplistic salad, but I can remember it perfectly. What a fantastic thing to wake up to. We also decided to get breakfast here on our last day while actually dining in the restaurant. I ordered the Grilled chicken sandwich, which of course, sounds boring, but it was spruced up with bacon, gruyere, apricot jam, and aloli. UM--YUM x3. I cannot remember for sure what my counterpart ordered, but I think he got the chicken and waffles again after being so enamored by the little slider.\\n\\nLike I said, this place is pricey, but the food is so delicious. The thing about Portland is that all the food that we consumed there was delicious, but we definitely spent a pretty penny on it while we were there. The best part were the salads that Portland had to offer even though the ones I had were so simplistic-- and one of them was from Urban Farmer. I loved so many things about The Nines itself--the decor is exquisite. I loved the colours of everything they used within the hotel. Its cool that they have such a delicious restaurant to top it off. I believe they have one or two other dining places floating around the hotel as well. I just love how they were able to add unique elements to dishes that would usually be boring. If you've got a little dough to spend, definitely park your booty here if you're in town, however, if you're hurtin, just grab sliders and a glass o' wine at Happy Hour.

At $15-30 per entree, they are squarely in the \\"pricey\\" category, but the dishes lacked originality in concept or presentation. My \\"chicken duo\\" dish was pretty tasty, but was served with hard mashed potatoes and under-cooked Brussels sprouts.

The only taco with flavor was the shredded chicken taco my 4 yo. son had (but it was a little spicy so he struggled eating it). The burrito had beans that tasted as if they came from a can - goopy. Even our fries lacked any type of season such as seasoning salt or regular. I think you guys get the picture - it lacked salt and flavor. It's an easy fix but will they take the time to listen? Marinate your meat at minimum for 4-5 hrs, use lime when marinating, salt and garlic salt or powder. Offer lime wedges for those that want a tangy meat flavor and please purchase small individual salt and pepper packages or have one consumers may use at their leisure. I'm not sure if I'll be back, I'm still debating but as of now probably not. I'm from LA so maybe this place is good if you've never had CA / LA real street tacos. Check them out on your own and be your own judge - don't take my word for it but read the review of a person that actually knows and has a pallet for street tacos - the real kind.\\n\\nI didn't mean to make this review negative, so here are some pros:\\nPolite guy took our order & took the time to read it back to ensure accuracy - big KUDOS!\\nVery fast service, food was ready in less than 6 minutes\\nThey gave us a good enough amount of napkins and utensils \\nThey gave us a lot of salsas!

Dang Coffee is about to be the new hot spot for Vietnamese in all of Columbus. I should let everyone know right now while you can still get in the door. \\n\\nSo I was greeted by a nice steeping pot of hot green tea infused with jasmine. It was kinda minty and not sweet as I would like it. I've never had it before but I liked it and it was complementary plus the more you drink it the more you'll appreciate it ;-)\\n\\nNext for my appetizer and this should be the first item you order which was also hands down the best spring rolls in all of Columbus and coming in at only $3 bucks. It's a must try. Matter fact, I'm just gonna have to order these every time just because they're so damn good. \\n\\nI also ordered #12.) Tai, Nam Thin sliced steak & Flank w/rice noodle Pho. Right off the bat had a WOW factor. Best broth for me to date. So at this point I'm realizing they're not playin around.

Yeah it too was ridiculous. I kinda wished for more meat... \\n\\nThe second time I came and wish I had the first time was #8.) Lemmon grass Pork Sub. This is the one you want!\\n\\nI met the owner Sigh, (I'm sure I didn't spell his name correctly) he was so humble and kind. I felt bad there was a little language barrier.

I'm gonna do something I've never before & that's to use my Yelp street cred and vouch for this spot! It's straight OG af! You can thank me later that you came.\\n\\nUpdate ** Take note to ordering #15 or #16 Pho's. Also don't be afraid to ask them a bizzilion questions. Also their Bun is off the F#%!?*n hook!

Also because there is such a long line when you do finally sit down its not as relaxing as most places because you feel the need to rush through your food to let other people come in and enjoy as well.

Anyways he was extremely rude, talking down to his customers and super creepy with his constant hitting on the female customers and sleezy one liners to every single woman who walked into the bar. Even worse was his blatant sexual harassment of the women who work there. I've witnessed on multiple occasions him saying inappropriate things to his female staff and slapping them on the butt. The employees were obviously uncomfortable and so was I. I'm also not the only one who felt this way. A few of my girlfriends have told me that they will not go in when he's working. As a woman I felt more comfortable when he wasn't there. I go there to drink and hangout not get hit on over and over by the bald Casanova wannabe.\\n\\nI don't want this guy to chase away all the good things that happen at the Cheerful, like $1 beer night, karaoke, and my favorite service industry appreciation night.

I love their sangria and other specialty cocktails.  \\n\\nBut there are a few things I don't like about eating there.  1 - It can get really loud if every table is full.  Not a huge problem, but it makes it next to impossible to hear people across the table from you.  Just don't go on a first date here during peak dining hours on Fridays and Saturdays.  2 - When it's crowded, service can stink.  On several different visits recently, our water glasses were empty for some time before our waiter came back with a refill.  The servers are very friendly, but just too busy when the place is crowded.  3 - I personally think the specials are overpriced, usually 10-20% more expensive than anything on the menu, and really not worth it (not any bigger or more exciting). The items on the menu are delicious, so stick to what's there.  \\n\\nBut overall, a great place!

But sometime around 2014, I noticed I wasn't going as much anymore.  Last night's dinner reminded me why.\\n\\nTo keep it short, the food just isn't up to their prior standards.  And while I know any restaurant can have an off night, this is not the first time in the last year or so where I found myself thinking, \\"Hmm...I don't know that I will be coming back\\".  In fact, it's taken me three separate mediocre meals over the course of a year to unhappily write this review.\\n\\nThe smoked octopus used to be a favorite.  Last night, it was chewy, and inexplicably, accompanied not by a hickory-smoked sauce, but a peanut-butter(?) type sauce.  I was hungry, so I ate it...but it was not good.\\n\\nFor an entree, I ordered \\"The Three Pigs\\", another favorite dish of mine that I've had numerous times.  It's a collection of three types of pork (hence it's name)...pork loin, bacon, and pigs ears.  At least, that's what it is supposed to be.\\n\\nMine arrive featuring several pieces of pork loin...but no bacon nor pigs ears.  And the pork loin itself was relatively flavorless and terribly dry.\\n\\nMy guest had a somewhat similar experience, judging the food as \\"It's...okay.\\"\\n\\nTo end on a positive note, their deserts were fantastic.  Toffee pudding and the chocolate tart were absolutely fantastic.  Absolutely delicious.

I really wish the place well, and thank them for the great memories and meals in the past.

They have a beautiful garden and a neat playground for the kids.\\n\\nBut the food is not good. It tastes like nothing and some of it even tasted bad to me. Now, I'm not obsessed with flavorful food and usually prefer much plainer food (I used to be a boring meat and potatoes girl from the Midwest, but I'm trying to branch out now!), but this just didn't taste good to me. I eat lots of vegetables and healthy food, but it tastes good. There was only thing I recall liking and I can't remember what it was. I didn't even like the tea. :oP\\n\\nAnd it was CRAZY expensive. $14 for the meal! I know you get seconds, but yikes! \\n\\nI was also not amused by some of the misinformation they were spreading. Eating raw vegetables is actually harder on digestion, because your body has to work more to process it. And there are many nutrients in vegetables/other food that your body won't be able to process and digest unless the food is actually cooked. Like spinach. You won't get the good stuff out of it unless you cook it and break down the cell walls. \\nAnd we went to a little free seminar after the meal where a girl talked about how changing to a macrobiotic diet changed her life (she used to be depressed and now she's happy), but the same could be said if she had just eaten healthier (she lived on junk food before). She also talked a lot about Chinese Medicine and shared a lot of information that was not correct at all and my classmates and I had to correct her more than once.

Just a glance at some of the offerings from their menu alone is enough to get my mouth watering (Red Velvet Pancakes, Charlie Bowl, Pulled Pork Pancakes and many, many more). They are quite a popular place, and there was a considerable lineup when I visited them today (11:15 am on a Wednesday), and I can only imagine the lines to be even greater on weekends. Fortunately however, their service appears to be quite efficient (and their staff were also extremely friendly), and I only had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated. It was a difficult decision for me to pick from their menu since literally EVERYTHING sounded delicious, but I finally settled on their Chicken French Toast, along with a cup of coffee to wash it all down. While I was a tad disappointed by the french toast, I did quite enjoy the food overall (details below). The portion sizes are quite generous, and even though I had no trouble polishing off my plate, I noticed that many other wimpier patrons (or, more accurately, people with normal appetites) around me weren't able to finish their orders. I cannot wait to revisit this place and try some of their over offerings.\\n\\nChicken French Toast ($16.5):\\n3.5/5\\nThis consisted of 4 pieces of french toast and a generous piece of fried chicken, with jalape√±o maple syrup and some pickled cabbage.\\n\\nFried Chicken (4.5/5): I was initially a bit disappointed to find that they used white meat (dark meat tastes much better in my opinion), and was pleasantly surprised by how good the chicken was. While white meat tended to be dry, this chicken was actually very moist and tender. The coating was flavourful and retained its crunch in spite of being covered in sour cream and syrup. Speaking of the syrup, I must admit that I was a bit let down by it. I expected that there would be a bit of heat from the jalape√±o. Instead, it just tasted like regular syrup with a slightly odd smell from the peppers that I personally didn't really like.\\n\\nFrench Toast (2.5/5): This was unfortunately quite disappointing. Now, I've only had french toast once before, so I'm by no means some aficionado, but this just tasted like regular bread to me. Granted that it was quite good bread - being really soft and fluffy - but I was expecting it to be hot and crispy, and to have more flavour.\\n\\nCoffee ($3):\\nI'm no coffee aficionado - I just drink it for the caffeine, which is what all graduate students need - so I can't comment on whether or not it's \\"good\\" coffee, only that they use beans from JJ Bean.

Run by an older Japanese fellow who was quit friendly. Small menu which some people like but personally I love options. No brown rice which was disappointing for me because I like to try to eat healthier when I can. The tuna sashimi was to die for. Excellent quality, melt in your mouth. Very pleased. My spinach Gomae, which had great reviews, was forgotten completely in my order. Very sad! Miso soup was good but the bowl was only half full. Chicken teriyaki was very lean with no skin which I quite liked. Sauce on the side. I liked it because it seemed very healthy, but it didn't have the rich flavors you get when the chicken is cooked in the sauce itself.  Vegetable roll was alright. Something amazing, somethings not, paid for spinach and tipped and didn't even get to try it. I would say this is a 3.5 star joint but I can't give half stars.

I understand that it was Portland dining week, but didn't pay for that discount (those who pay for the discount had limited selection of meats). I felt like my time spent there was waiting for them to bring the meat around. I even started asking for specific cuts but still, had to ask 3 different people to get it. Usually it takes one person. I also noticed that the meat wasn't not seasoned adequately, some were overly salty and some bland. The grains of salt on the beef ribs overpowered the delicate texture of the tenderness of the meat.

They are definitely experimenting with portion control: the size of the \\"dim sum type tapas\\" were smaller than most appetizers at other restaurants, and the price was at least as high as most entrees. For instance, the beef ribs were $17 for one piece of meat...shared four ways, that was one medium size bite for each of us. And the okra, though quite deilcious, was $8 and very meager, so we had to order two plates of this.... abouit 6-8 slices of fried okra per person.With these extremely high prices, it's no wonder they don't list the actual prices of their dishes on their website.

We had escargots and octopus for appetizers.  Escargots were not that good- they were very small and the sauce was missing something.  Usually I want to scoop up all the butter and sauce with bread but this time the flavor wasn't there. The octopus was prepared nicely but the salad that came with it was boring. The ingredients didn't mesh well. We had steak frites and beef bourginon for entrees.  Both were good but nothing amazing. Our side dish never came out so we had to ask for it.  The spinach was very good but portion was extremely small. Our waiter/bartender was nice but clearly he had too much going on and needed help. I guess that may be the downside of sitting in the bar area.  We finished our entrees and sat there for about 15-20 minutes with no one checking on us nor clearing our plates. I ended up going to the bar to order our dessert. We had creme br√ªl√©e which was probably the best dish of the night. Overall the dinner is not worth if paying full price.

What a shame. Don't they have any real work to do?\\n\\nI walked over to ask if the space they wanted came through and the man said no. He said they may have a location at the other end of the lake on church property. There is a little park at that end also. He explained how he can only be in his present lot for two hours. Two hours! Then he has to pack up and leave. He actually starts the green egg at home so it will be ready when he arrives. Even so, it still took him precious time to set up.\\n\\nHe said once he had a very long line of customers and he went over the two hours. The police showed up gave him a hard time. So, hopefully the space near the church will come through. He said the church is on private land and he'll have to pay to be there where his current space is on State land. At least the police will stop breathing down his neck. Good luck with the church property space!\\n\\nToday, I finally tried a mini Shnurble. I usually get Chorizo or a Pearl hotdog. It was soo good!

It seems insulting to say no to the dish which makes it uncomfortable.  \\nAnother aspect I was not fond of was having to start and stop the conversations we were having with each other at the table because new dishes keep coming out and chefs have to explain and sell you what's on your tray.

My rating is entirely based on the fact that my usual food choices come from Buford Highway, where one can get flavorful, authentic, and very reasonably priced foods in hefty portions. \\n\\nWhat I loved about Gunshow was the concept. It's so unique!  Southern dim sum, served at your table by the hand of the chef himself (there were no female chefs the night I was there). Everything looks and smells delicious so it's great that you can see the night's menu ahead of time and choose the dishes you want to hold out for. We started with a salad that knocked my socks off and followed soon with a fried quail that was amazing. It became hard to turn anything down after that because the first two dishes were so good.  We also tried the scallops, red snapper, and a chicken kebab. At this point we were slowing down but knew we still wanted to try the brussel sprouts and the pork bibmbop.  Not only were we getting full but everything was starting to taste too salty and rich. \\n\\nAll in all, the concept was fun and the food was impressive. It did get very loud so it felt more like an adventure than an intimate dinner.  But I did love how casual it felt. The only thing pretentious about the experience was the bill at the end, which we knew would be high and we could calculate as we ordered each dish.\\n\\nGoing back to what I mentioned about reviews being relative, while the overall experience was probably a 4 for me, I gave this a 3 because the price, loudness, and rich/salty-ness of most of the choices took away from my enjoyment.

On the night of the meal, our primary server Chris made sure to confirm that all I items I wanted to eat were also free of soy.\\n\\nThe story of this meal to celebrate my parents' 50th wedding anniversary goes from good, to potential disaster, to redemption by the restaurant staff.\\n\\nMy sister's boyfriend suggested Sullivan's when we were discussing where to treat our parents for their 50th wedding anniversary. A month prior to the possible meal date, I called the restaurant to ask if they could accommodate someone with a soy allergy. The host transferred my call to the kitchen, and one of their chefs, Peter told me the info above. I was very glad to hear that, so he transferred me back to the host, and I made our reservations for eight people on December 26th. The host confirmed that making the reservation that far in advance wasn't a problem, and that yes, they would be open for lunch that Monday.\\n\\nA month passed. Christmas Eve at 9 pm, the staff left a message on our answering machine that the corporate office had changed the holiday schedule. They were no longer going to be open for lunch on the day after Christmas. They said that they wold still be available until 11pm if we wanted to talk to them. We were able to call back at 10:30pm, and they told us that the schedule had been changed two days prior, and that our reservation was being canceled. (The reservation the we made more than a month before.) We were mad that it took them two days to inform us, and after making sure they knew this, (there was no cussing involved,) they offered to move the reservation to that evening. Luckily my parents weren't scheduled to go back to Dallas until the next day, so we grumpily accepted the change.\\n\\nTwo days pass. We arrived in time for our reservation, and after being seated, our waiter Chris introduced himself. Without any prompting from us, he let us know that he knew about the problems with the reservations and said that Sullivan's would be giving us complementary appetizers in apology for the problems this had caused. We were glad to hear this, and it showed that they were trying to correct the communication problems that may have caused the two-day delay in letting us know.\\n\\nThe two appetizers were their Cheesesteak egg rolls, and the Crispy Shanghai Calamari. My mom had never had Calamari before, but after we convinced her to try it, she said she really liked it. The rest of the table gave it rave reviews as well. However, since that was a fried item that I couldn't have, Chris was kind enough to bring me a serving on their raw oysters. I'd never had them before, and after eating two of them I thought they were OK. I guess I'm not really into raw oysters, but my sister's boyfriend is, and after giving him the third one, he said they were excellent.\\n\\nBecause there were multiple hearing-aids in use, when it came time to order, we found it hard to hear Chris describe the specials due to of the volume of the music. At our request, and after a couple of tries, he was able to get it turned off during this early part of our meal.\\n\\nI started with the Lettuce Wedge salad with Blue Cheese dressing, which was really good, and had a nice saltiness and tang. However, I'd place it just a shade below the wedge salad I recently had at Tillman's Roadhouse in Dallas. (Tillman' version had a good amount of bacon on it.) It was also nice to be able to have some of the bread and butter that they brought for the table, because in most places I eat, the bread isn't safe, or they can't tell me if it is soy-free. (And quite a few places serve margarine rather than butter.)\\n\\nMy entree was the 8oz Fillet Oscar with Asparagus and lump Crab Meat, and just like my recent meal at Bistro Vitel, I thought that the steak didn't need seasoning. I ordered the steak medium rare, and it came with an appropriate amount of pink inside.\\n\\nAll the ala cart sides are served family style, so I ordered the Au Gratin Potatoes. Unlike the other things I ate that night, this was this was the only dish I felt needed more salt. In a bit of a twist, they make theirs from potato cubes, rather than slices. I also tried the Sweet Potato Casserole, and it was good, but I'm picky about sweet potato dishes, and think the best I've had is from Whole Foods.\\n\\nFor dessert, I had the wonderful Peanut Butter Pie. \\n\\nThroughout the evening Chris and his crew were on top of things, attentive, and always striving to keep us satisfied. They did just that, and we think they more than redeemed themselves from the scheduling difficulties. By the end of the evening, we were full and very satisfied.\\n\\nI can recommend this place not only for their food, but also for their efforts to recover from mistakes, and to maintain a high level of service."},{"name":"Little Billy's Steak House","address":"6785 Hastings Street","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3","text":"After reading the reviews we came here expecting a nice dinner.

If you want to be in a place that is laid back and conducive for having a conversation, this is a great place. The main reason BB Rover's rocks, is the beer selection.

You can find brews from everywhere in the world (I don't think I've seen Vietnamese beer in any other bars in the area) along with a good micro brew selection.

The oysters were the single best shellfish dish I have ever eaten and I was lucky enough to have them all to myself because, despite my wife's incredible taste in picking me out years ago, she still lacks taste in some areas and can't stand oysters ;-)\\n\\nThe cocktails were each works of art, with the caipirinha being the standout showing of the night; not too sweet with a funky green color caused by some vegetable infusion if I remember correctly.  It's a nice treat to have a master mixologist roll up a cocktail cart to your table and craft the masterpieces right in front of your eyes the same way the open kitchen allows you to catch glimpses of the birth of each plate of glorious food.\\n\\nWe finished the meal with the banana pudding and couldn't have been happier with our final choice. It was warm perfect and we would have had a second one if we thought we would be able to move after because of our stuffed bellies.\\n\\nDespite the unique dining format and the absolutely amazing tasting food, the best part of the evening was truly the staff. There was such a visible dedication to their work in the attitude of every employee and the almost tangible atmosphere of inclusiveness, no matter everyone's personal life choices, made them all seemed like the coolest people in the world. One staff member even told me that my \\"facial hair game is on point\\" which was the flattering cherry on top of a perfect night.\\n\\nMy wife and I showed up that night not really knowing what we were getting into but everyone there made us feel welcome and special and served us the best meal of our lives.  We are already planning a trip back to Atlanta centered around one or two more dinners at the Gunshow. It really is worth a trip to the city just for dinner.\\n\\nAlso, don't leave without picking up a t-shirt. Just like you can't go to an amazing rock concert without leaving with a memento from the merch table to remind you of the awesome night, you'll want something in your wardrobe to rekindle the memories of the fantastic performance you experienced at the Gunshow. \\n\\nOne final note... The prices there are incredibly reasonable for what you get. For perspective, we are an American middle-class couple and would have happily paid twice as much as we did for the food and drinks. Across from us was a large party with the ladies wearing various  diamonds probably in the $100k range so there is clearly a segment of customers there who can afford a high priced meal, but they still keep the tapas sized dishes around the $12-15 range. That choice seems intentional and increased my respect for the owners/operators even more. The lack of pretension and dedication to great food and an awesome experience makes the Gunshow truly special.  Our only regret of the night was that we were too busy freaking out over the amazing time we were having (while trying to play it cool) that we didn't take enough pictures of the food or drinks.\\n\\nThis ends the longest review I've ever written... Hope it encourages you to not miss out having your own \\"Best Meal Evar!\\""},{"name":"Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse","address":"930 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Definitely a great place to bring a group of people for a special event.

Had a good char taste.  The sauce was a little sweeter than I would have liked, but not necessarily sweeter than the kalbi at Hae Rim, for example.  The kalua pig was decent, but nothing special.  Not enough smokiness, I don't think (not very memorable so I don't remember exactly what it tastes like- I remember it just tasting like slow cooked pork- NOT kalua pork).   The hamburger steak was my favorite out of the three.   The brown gravy had good flavor and the hamburger was nice and grilled.  However, it was too charred and had too bitter of a taste.  \\n\\nAll in all the food is pretty good- when you can get it!

I selected the lemon ricotta blueberry pancakes and my bf had a regular breakfast with eggs, hash browns and sausage.

We talked to the manager and he apologized and took it off the bill, but still it's not something that will make me want it again. Other than that, my Pork Porterhouse was delicious.

Imagine an elegant classic american brunch cafe infused and mashed into a european bistro, both in the decor and the food. The menu is full of excellent southern classics made elegant without losing any of the down-home goodness. I mean it. This is what happens when you take a european neighborhood cafe and drop it deep in an Atlanta neighborhood like Kirkwood. Sun in my Belly is literally hidden on the other side of the tracks. (At least from my house.)\\n\\nSince I moved to Atlanta a few months ago, I've had an on again off again craving for some shrimp & grits. Sure they offer the plate at other places, such as Flying Biscuit and Six Feet Under, but for some reason, I held back and didn't order the dish at those spots. I saw it on the menu at Sun in my Belly and I knew what I was getting that morning. Their menu has it printed as shrimp and grits served with sausage + parmesan crouton. Oh, it's so much better than those printed words would have you believe.\\n\\nThe grits themselves are great. Different in consistency and texture than most places I've tried here in Atlanta. The grits are a little grittier and they're not as wet as most places.  These are the grits I would want the uninitiated to eat. Don't feed them grits that are anywhere close to reminiscent of cream of wheat or any other ground up grain. Serve them the grits at Sun in my Belly. Oh. The shrimp? They're large, succulent and the seasoning floats off the shrimp and melds with the grits stretching the flavor throughout the entire meal. Where some people might give you uneven quality by having good shrimp, and just so-so grits, Sun in my Belly seems to go all out.\\n\\nThe scrambled egg pressed panini served with hook cheddar + bacon on Brioche, served with mashed potatoes - while obviously the panini is going to be good, they downplay the quality of their 'mashed potatoes'. These are not simply mashed potatoes. These potatoes are seasoned and cooked with in a way that rivals those at Ria's Bluebird. This is good stuff.\\n\\nThe service is timely, appropriate, knowledgeable and accomodating. They have a full case of cupcakes and other pastries, including such creative fare such as gummi worms on cupcakes made to look like a piece of turf. The space is an old harware store and there is ample seating. A european neighborhood cafe smack in the middle of Atlanta, within view of MARTA train tracks.

Lambert's is a place where you can go, get a freaking awesome, fresh sammich on awesome, fresh bread, where they slice the deli meat in front of you (thin!) and pile it on high. They have a wide (WIDE) variety of meats and cheeses (Havarti Dill? What? I love you, Lambert's), as well as a decent little baked-goods section to indulge your sweet tooth. It's clean, good-sized, well lit, and has a pretty good salad bar. Also, there's a small grocery section with take-away foods (for when you know your ass ain't cookin' when you get home), dairy, yogurt (Chobani, nom nom nom), and most importantly, fresh fruit and prices that are competitive with most supermarkets in the Boston metro area. \\n\\nI agree that Lambert's should not be considered a \\"One Dollar Sign\\" establishment - I realize Boston is expensive, but so is a sandwich for eight bucks.

However there is nothing 'buffet' about the Borrego's chow. Tasty, cheap and fresh Mex-Mex and Tex-Mex food is served up here by a friendly family of staff. The corn tortillas are made on site, the enchiladas (go with the verde sauce) could give the stalwart Fonda San Miguel a run for the money (at less than half the price!), and the fajitas/carne Mexicana platter are very good. Borrego serves some pretty authentic Mexican food like birria (lamb stew - a house specialty, hence the name) and machacado (sort of like beef jerky?), too.\\n\\nThe waitstaff is friendly and tolerant of this reviewer's Spanglish (with a slightly 'borracho' Panamanian accent at times). Only downside to the Borrego is watery salsa with the chips and meager side portions of guac/pico to go with some of the entrees. Minus a star for that.

Because of our youngest child's Needs I have to be uptight so he (and therefore, we) can have a positive, enjoyable experience. Some places get a bit uppity, but truly, I was just thrilled with how thoughtful their responses and ideas were so as to make it a successful brunch for our whole family.\\n\\nWell, this is clearly a well-oiled operation because there were quite a stream of us arriving a la meme fois and the cheery, attentive ladies at the front desk had us all squared away in good order.

If I'd ordered it off a menu I probably would have been disappointed, but I have a different expectation of both a buffet and of a buffet on a very busy day. The food was all at the right temp, it was plentiful (we never opened a container to find it low or empty), and there good choices -- not a ton of choices (which I LOVE but which mightn't be feasible in such a small restau). Given that it was April 20, I was THRILLED with the delicious watermelon (my second favorite fruit), and the pot de cremes were terrific. My eldest child raved about the creme brulee, and my husband and youngest were very keen on the bacon and gravlax (or smoked salmon -- I didn't get close enough to thoroughly investigate).\\n\\nThis was our first time at the Greenbriar Inn so I can only say that given my expectations on a busy Easter Sunday for brunch I was pleased with the food.

While the filet was nicely cooked, and overall pretty flavorful, the lobster was the complete opposite. Honestly, this was the worst lobster tail I've ever been served. No flavor, no seasoning, no nothing. Just boiled lobster tail. I'd even be more forgiving had it been served with something, like melted butter, but even I had to specially ask for that. I'm kind of a food purist in that I dislike having to add salt to prepared food, so when I actually had to salt my $50 plate of food, I was pretty irked. \\nI was also a little put-off by our waitress.

When our dinner arrived, I could not believe how small the portions were.  I ordered the beef short rib, mashed potatoes, brussels sprouts.  They basically put my meal in something the size of a cereal bowl.  One small 2\\" in size short rib, at best a tablespoon of brussels sprouts, and a small serving of mashed potatoes.  The flavor was decent, but I walked away hungry and for a price tag of $15, the meal was way overpriced.  My friends too were also disappointed with their meal.  All of our meals came in cereal bowls or a small narrow plate.  How ironic that they call them, \\"Big Bites\\".  It should more appropriately be called, \\"Three Bites\\".  We ordered a glass of wine and it was about a 4 oz pour and it was $13, ridiculous!  Frankly, I do not understand why people think this place is great.  As I said, I've been there for lunch and breakfast also.  The breakfast was the best meal by far, but not worth the wait.    Lunch, very disappointing too.

Also, last year the tails were prepared so that the \\"meat\\" could be literally lifted out from the shell.  This time it was left untouched and was difficult to cut away.  In addition, the usual lemon-butter dip was now replaced with a tasteless oil which was disappointing, too.  My steak was brought fairly rare; though I had requested medium well.

I walk through the crowded restaurant to let them know we wanted to be put on the list as more people were walking in. They said someone will greet you at the front.

Wow I would definitely recommend everything but the pho. The pho had a distinct taste that we couldn't make it. It was not up to par for us. The chicken wings were delicious and crispy. If you've had the traditional salt and pepper crab at Chinese restaurants, this is very similar but in chicken wing form. Garlicky goodness. The butter beef is like beef carpaccio with tons of fresh cilantro, vinegar and friend onions/shallots. Sooo refreshing and light. The shaken beef if not the typical Vietnamese shaken beef that I am used to. We typically eat it cubed with bell peppers and red rice.

The website needs a little work and is a little difficult to navigate, but there was a menu available for download.  \\n\\nThe restaurant is tucked nicely off the main street (N. Highland) with a nice view of the trees.  There is a medium-sized patio area where there was a small jazz ensemble.  At noon on Sunday, the place was packed.  I was able to grab one of the few valet parking spots available. Once the valet lot was filled, patrons had to search for a spot on the street - kind of a pain.\\n\\nInside the restaurant, there are a few rooms for seating and a bar area in addition to the patio seating.  We sat in one of the side rooms which had about 7 or so tables of various sizes.\\n\\nAmbiance: overall good.  A little loud but not overwhelming.  Tables are a little close together, but plenty of room to get in/out of your seat.\\n\\nFood: The brunch menu is a mix of items: fish and grits, eggs benedict, belgian waffles, chocolate chip and strawberry pancakes.  I had the chicken and waffles which was a large belgian waffle with some cinnamon in the batter, topped with fried chicken tenders, a couple of raspberries, some confectionery sugar and a small bowl of maple syrup on the side.  The waffle was cooked just right - not too dry, nice taste of cinnamon.  The tenders may have been slightly overcooked but still good and surprisingly were complemented well with a pouring of maple syrup on top.  My friends had eggs benedict (biscuit+crab+eggs) and  steak and eggs (with some type of green, mexican-style sauce).  We all enjoyed our meals and the portion sizes were definitely adequate.  We were all full when we left.\\n\\nDrinks:  Standard drip coffee was very good.  They have $10 bottomless mimosas and bellinis.  The online menu said they were $8 and didn't comment on the 'bottomless'.  The staff is pretty good about refilling water/coffee/mimosas.\\n\\nCustomer service: pretty good.  Hostess seated us quickly despite large # patrons and despite the fact that our full party hadn't arrived yet.  This was definitely a bonus.\\n\\nOverall, I would say this place is worth visiting.  I would go again if in the area or with a group of friends.  Food was good - not the best I have ever had but far from the worst.  Probably a 4 out of 5.  Definitely a great brunch option - especially if you have a friend who likes to get their money's worth of bottomless mimosas.

I've worked and lived in the Allston - Brookline area for several decades, but had never been here previously.  \\n\\nI hadn't had moo shu in a very long time, and was feeling hungry for it.  I realize there are other places I could go in the Brookline area, but always had an impression of Golden Temple as the standard bearer of local Chinese restaurants.  I gather it's been at this location for some five decades.  They claim they open at 11 AM, but I seemed to be today's first customer at 11:45.  The interior is quite nice, especially when compared to the less than lovely exterior, although quite dark.  What lights there were, seemed intended to illuminate the dramatic angled, bare wood beams.  The waiters are very good.\\n\\nThere were various moo shu dishes on the full menu, but only a vegetable version on the lunch menu.  These dishes came with a very limited variety of side dishes, most of which didn't appeal to me - I selected brown rice and seaweed salad.  I was disappointed when the plate arrived, and there were two moo shu already assembled.  For me, a lot of the pleasure of dishes like this - and Fajitas, is the process of assembling your own, from brushing the Hoisin sauce on, to loading the pancake up with such an abundance of filling that it will never stay together.\\n\\nThe rice was good, but the seaweed salad had a most odd taste that ruined it for me, having grown accustomed to that offered at Jin's in Coolidge Corner.  The moo shu wraps were fine, with an unknown (to me) mushroom providing a substantial bite to it.  I think if I return I'll order off the full menu, as the lunch menu isn't the value that it is at other places, and the side dish options are not inspiring.  Other reviews suggest that the meat is generally of a good quality, which is often a sticking point for me with the majority of Chinese restaurants.\\n\\nAt the end of the meal I wanted to wash my hands.  One of the automated water faucets in the men's room wasn't working, as were neither of the soap dispensers.  I went and told this to the woman at the front, and she acted like I was passing on some FYI news.  I put out my wet hands and made it clear that I wanted some soap immediately.  She went back with me and grabbed a dispenser bottle from the women's room.  I started to take it for the men's room, but she pressed some into my outstretched hands and then brought it back where she had found it.  So much for the \\"employees must wash hands\\" principle - unless they have separate toilets, with soap and hot water available."},{"name":"Counter Cafe East","address":"1914 E 6th St, Ste A","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Quality food and service are such a good combination.

I go out to eat 3 times a week; and on top of that, I am a steak-lover. With that being said, I've been to all the popular steakhouses in Boston: the Del Frisco's, Capital Grille's, Grille 23, Ruth's Chris, Smith and W's, Boston Chops, etc. of the 617.  \\n\\nMooo beats them all out due to three simple things: quality, service and ambiance. \\nLet's start with the quality - no matter what cut you get, you will get the steak you crave exactly the way you want it - whether its well done (gross), Pittsburgh style (my preference) or even \\"just a little bit after medium rare but right before medium\\" - they will cater to you; and will educate you - whether its the steak, the amazing apps, or even their wine selection. I was able to find a bottle for under 40 dollars that paired perfectly with our dinner - of course with some guidance from the server. \\n\\nService - this was also top-notch, as the server was helpful but not too over the top where you feel like you have an unplanned guest at your table. Whenever I had a question, it was answered attentively and I never felt that I was bothering the service. Additionally, during one of my dinners at Mooo, I met one of the managers, Bill, who not only introduced himself but asked for me to let him know if there was anything they could do to make that reservation or the next better. \\n\\nAmbiance - this ties the service here; as the decor is beautiful inside. Not your typical dark wood/low lighting place - Mooo has amazing lighting to show off some of their art and, my favorite part - the chairs and tables. Small tip: if you prefer privacy or intimacy for your dinner; request the table with the high-backed chairs. They are not only beautiful, but it really makes it feel like the dinner is just between you and your significant other. \\n\\nBill and team at Mooo - you have converted me into a loyal customer; and Mooo will be my go-to steak house in Boston  - no one even comes close."},{"name":"Fellini's Pizza","address":"1991 Howell Mill Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Service was superb.

Something about \\"taking too long\\" to cook. Really? If you have something on the menu for all-day, it should be an all-day item. It's not like I ordered something off of the lunch menu for dinner. I didn't arrive 15 minutes before closure, or even 30. I arrived well over a hour before the establishment closed and they refused to make a dish. Unbelievable. Never has this happened to me in any restaurant I've ever come across, with the rare exception of, \\"Sorry, we're out of ______ item,\\" which is understandable. \\n\\nI opted for a safe choice--beef and broccoli. The food took very quick to make, and it was piping hot. I got a large plate of beef and broccoli with a side of fried rice. The verdict? Extremely bland. Apparently, the restaurant is \\"lite\\" in their sodium and oil when cooking, but it didn't matter--you can use herbs and vegetables to make a dish taste great despite very little sodium. I didn't get flavor. I don't even think the fried rice I ate had anything except rice and some light-sodium soy sauce. Egg? Pork? Carrots? Peas? Nothing of that sort.\\n\\nAll in all, I was extremely disappointed. I have had great Chinese food from many different spots all across Orlando, but I guess this must be Longwood's finest.

Yesterday I tried it, with them of course, and have to say it is great! \\n\\nVery clean, and NPWH. Busy at lunchtime, even on the late side when we went close to two. They have everything from soups to sandwiches to salads and pizza. My dad simply raves about this hot grilled chicken sandwich they have and since I was torn be two of their (large) salads, I went with his fave: sliced grilled chicken, swiss, tomato, bacon, and leafy (not shredded iceburg which I simply detest- no Subway for this girl!) and it was awesome. As usual, I didn't finish it so I had the other half for dinner. Know that mayonnaise normally comes on it and homey mustard on the side, so ask if you want it differently. You get your choice of chips, pasta salad, or soup as your side. The soft drinks/ice tea cups are huge. Free refills but none of us needed one! They do serve a small selection of wine and (bottled) beer.\\n\\nA lot of their salads sound great and they really are huge. Mom is on some diet so she went with the Asian pick with chicken and balsamic on the side; she enjoyed and I thought it looked tasty. I want to try the Ultimate Salad on a future visit- it sounds delicious with that grilled chicken, turkey, ham, cucumber, tomato...though I might just get it with chicken, you know?\\n\\nParking is always a challenge at Brookhaven Place, so it's no surprise that a popular place like this is a task getting into most times of the day. You may have to go down to the garage, but it's dicey to park in the Publix lot right next door since they've gotten close to starting to boot cars and that always sucks!\\n\\nThey also cater and there seemed to be a solid number of catered orders going out (maybe it's the time of year but that seems to be a good business for them and I'd definitely be happy if I worked somewhere that ordered it!) and the to-go cooler section (you can also get it if you call ahead or ask at the regular counter) is stocked with more simple sandwich (also, they are cold, no hot options) and all the same side choices, chips, etc. A separate counter makes it quicker to get in and out.\\n\\nThis place is so close to me, reasonably priced (hard to get a good lunch, especially if you take part home and will actually eat it later), with good food and a pleasant atmosphere.\\n\\nTwo thumbs up!"},{"name":"Jam Cafe on Beatty","address":"556 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Despite the wait (we waited 35 mins at 8AM on a Thursday), the food and service was amazing and worth the wait!

Pizza ranges from acceptable to very good, and service is usually friendly but slow.

Vegetarians and carnivores will be equally pleased.  The red sauce is a little off -- thin and watery with large chunks of possibly canned tomatoes.

I heard about the new bar bites menu and the 23 dollar wine list they offer on Sundays and Mondays so my boyfriend and I hitup the upstairs bar this past monday. We go to Grille 23 alot and love the regular menu, but we figured we'd try it out mostly for the wine list. We sat in our usual spot in the usptairs bar and had Josephine as our bartender again. She is really sweet and knows just when to chat with us and when to let us enjoy our meals. Having been a bartender I always find this is a great quality to have. We ordered a bottle of Sangiovese off of the 23 dollar bottle menu and it was delicious. Such a great deal. We then asked her for the bar bites menu and ordered quite a few things. The deviled eggs topped with Jonah Crab meat were delicious. We also ordered Grille23's version of a corn dog with a nice remoulade sauce to dip in. It was delicious as well. The best thing we orederd was the pulled pork slider topped with wonderful homemade coleslaw on a mini brioche mmm could have eaten a couple of those. My boyfriends favorite was the mini arrancinis (rice balls) with truffle and cheese inside. They are small portions but when you order a bunch like we did it is enough. However, we could not feel complete without getting a steak so we ordered the twin filet to split with a side of their mac n cheese (my favorite thing). My filet was cooked perfectly although Tim's was slightly more cooked than he usually likes. I didnt notice to be honest I was too busy loving my filet and mac n cheese. We finished off the night with Bourbon (masterfully poured by Josephine) and the caramel profiteroles- it was our first time trying this one and YET AGAIN we were finishing off our meal really really happy and full. We escaped for about 110 total bill for ALL OF THAT. Delicious. GO GO GO on a monday and see Jospehine.\\nI really cannot say it enough... This place is amazing. The 14 oz filet began out courtship and their additions of the bar bites and the 23 dollar wine menu on mon and sun will continue our love affair.\\n\\nHave fun in back home in  Ireland Josephine!

This place is immaculately clean and neat When you walk in you can see them preparing the fresh dough for pizza, so that when you order your pizza it is made fresh. The dough is great, and while the inside of the pizza is thin, the crust is a bit thicker and so if you like thin crust all around if you do not let them know it might not be thin enough the further you bite back into your slice. Additionally, their selections of types of pizza is quiet amazing. Whether you do boring margarita which they sprinkle fresh basil on top of and is amazing. Or something a bit more fancy like prosciutto and arugula. The menu is divide between white and red pizza. As soon as you order your pizza is made fresh. So it might not be instant and take a few minutes but it is worth the wait and frankly for fresh pizza I could wait 10-15 minutes all the time.

It was my first time going to a dim sum style restaurant with non Asian food. They bring around all the dishes on the menu that particular night and you have them leave it, or you can pass. \\n\\nOne of my favorite dishes of the night was the fried chicken. They were promoting it hardcore because it was a few weeks before Kevin Gillespie's southern restaurant was opening, but it was easily one of the best I've had in Atlanta. The pork belly buffalo wings were also phenomenal.

Pretty much a perfect white pizza, crust, garlic, tomato, spinach,  and all.  No complaints.  The cheese pizza which we probably shouldn't have ordered here in the evening seemed like it had been made earlier and had been sitting around after that for a good long while.   Barely edible.  The contrast between the pizzas was huge;  they didn't even seem like they could be from the same place.  It would really have made a difference if our cheese pizza had been made fresh.  They have good quality ingredients here and one would think they would use these ingredients to make fresh pizzas as they are ordered,   since nobody really wants a pizza that has been sitting out under a heat lamp for a long time.   \\n\\nBy the way, they have a good menu, with sandwiches and other items, too.

The crust on the bread, while artfully rustic, was so hard that I was in some discomfort trying to find a way to eat the sandwich. However I will admit that the french toast stuffed with ricotta is great and that their honey glazed bacon is tasty. Also, they seem to use very fresh ingredients. \\n\\nAs with most brunch places in Atlanta, there was a bit of a wait though people in general seemed to be in a relatively decent mood. Also, be warned that it seems to take a while for the food to come out.\\n\\nOverall, the experience took way too long for what, in my book, was only ok food and subpar coffee--the cafe au lait and the cappucino tasted disappointingly watery.

The concept is fresh food the chefs make daily and they make however many they can, come to your table and describe the food to you and you decide whether you want it or not! Fear not, people who want to see your dish before you eat it! You'll not only see it, but smell it too!

There were a few of us, and we all ordered different things and shared.

Having said this, I really don't understand why it's so hard for the Boloco staff to get it together with my order(s). I'd started relying on online ordering because a) I have several food allergies and it's hard to constantly be like \\"no,\\" and \\"yes,\\" to literally everything. b) I just got tired of the fact that the staff doesn't listen to my needs and wants to put me in a box. c) I generally hate people. \\n\\nAnyway, since I started working in downtown I thought that going to Boloco Commons was going to be SO the norm for me.

I've had things missing even though I've explicitly entered them in my \\"Goloco.\\" There's a reason I stopped ordering a \\"buffalo\\" and adding things to it. Today was by far the worst. I ordered online. A simple order (buffalo, no meat with cucumbers, and tomato) and I went to the location to pick it up. While I was there I decided to stand in line and buy a water and chips and guac. I had to tell the girl THREE times that I wanted chips and guac and she rang me up for the water. Then I picked up the chips and showed them to her and she was like \\"oh, chips and guac.\\" Then I told her I also had a pick up, after I paid for this. Guess what happened? She didn't give me the guac. Yes, by that time, I rolled my eyes and I was rude. The location was empty and it wasn't the lunch rush, since I was there at 11:10 am. Then I get back to the office to find MEAT in my burrito. The burrito that clearly had my name on it and the ingredients that said what I wanted...

Now let me say they are not as tender as Rib City or Russel St. the taste and the Char on the rib is out of this world and they do it right. The Garlic Red-Skin Mashed Potatoes are Red-skin potatoes mixed with butter and garlic and they also were very good. The Hot & spicy Green Beans SUCKED.

The cheeseburgers are also quite excellent.\\n\\nI got to know most of the waitresses a little bit (crushing on some a _lot_) and made Charlie's part of my weekly schedule... either stopping off for dinner on a weeknight, or an afternoon pint and grilled cheese on the weekend after one of my Harvard Square walkabouts.\\n\\nUpstairs, it's a different scene entirely. There's a jukebox. The crowd is younger. They're more about getting their drink on. And there's occasionally live music, with the band crammed at one end of the long, narrow space. On non-music nights, the upstairs is perfect for larger groups. Grab one of the large tables at the end, and camp out for several rounds.\\n\\nI wouldn't call it a dive bar.

We live close and frequent Tasca, so we gave it a shot with a friend's recommendation and the help of many supportive yelp reviews. Bad idea.\\n\\nLet me start off my stating that the one sever that was working informed us that they no longer serve alcohol. Frustrating, because recent reviews mention margaritas, but alas, we continued our meal sans alcohol, which is not how we like to enjoy tacos. I'm not sure if it's something new management is instilling, or if too many underage college kids flocked to this restaurant, but someone ruined the fun for all of us.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is tiny - I can't imagine the place holding more than 30 people, and that's a stretch. When we first got in, the restaurant was incredibly hot - it was ~80 degrees outside and they hadn't even touched their AC or the windows. We waited outside for the rest of our party because it was so uncomfortable, and had to ask for the windows to be opened when we did sit down. This appeared to surprise the server, but he complied.\\n\\nI ordered one chicken taco without cilantro, which from the menu, appears to just be a topping - I was wrong. I'm a \\"super-taster\\" if you will, so cilantro is the devil to me. The sever said that it's in the pico de gallo, so I asked for my taco without. My taco arrived coated in their \\"guac sauce\\" which is 50% cilantro. I was unable to eat my food. Don't you think the server should have mentioned the cilantro content in the guac sauce? Which, if taken off, would have left my taco as just a chicken and cheese taco...no thanks.\\n\\nWe also ordered a side of guac which never came (probably a good thing, because cilantro), and the vegetarian in the party was served one veggie taco and one chicken taco, which for obvious reasons was not what she had ordered.\\n\\nOverall: bad experience, will not return, and do not recommend."},{"name":"Catfish Parlour - North Austin","address":"11910 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I liked the fish, nice flavor, both the spicy and the regular were good, but the regular had the best flavor of the two.

From start to finish, just \\"wow\\" 4th & Swift. I'm so glad that Brent H. decided to make this restaurant the fifth his UYE Numbers series. It was an excellent choice.\\n\\nI'd heard about 4th & Swift for ages, it's reputation, the food, the space, the service, the hundreds of glowing reviews, the whole spiel. But despite all that, I'd not found an occasion warranting all the hullaballoo, so when Brent decided this was the place to go, I was in (and so was my boyfriend, my almost quintessential partner in crime for Yelp events).\\n\\nWe arrived on a Wednesday night at 7:30 with a reservation for 12, and as soon as I saw the industrial-warehouse looking building in the Fourth Ward, I had a good feeling about everything.\\n\\nThe majority of the party was already there waiting for us at the bar, and as soon as the last stragglers arrived, we were seated at two tables along one wall. The inside of 4th & Swift is one large open space, just like the warehouse it inhabits was originally built. The bar is situated in the center offering easy access from all side, the walls are exposed, weathered brick, the ceiling is still exposed beams and trusses, and although it's large and airy, the dark colors make the whole thing feel quite intimate and comfy. Also, on the front side overlooking the parking lot is a wall of windows looking out onto a reasonably sized outdoor patio. And I noticed the art decorating the walls consists of rows of bottles of wine or pieces or ornate ceiling tiles painted over with different scenarios.\\n\\nOur server that night was Bethany, and judging by the number of Yelpers (not always the best decision makers when it comes to food), she did an excellent job. We had full glasses, clean silver ware, replaced bread baskets and she checked on us all very well throughout the evening and split the checks according to our request with no problem.\\n\\nSo now, to the food, the part everyone's been waiting for. The menu is divided into different sections, but it's all seasonal, fresh, and as locally sourced as is possible within reason. There were about 20 items total between the small plates and large plates and everything sounded exotic and enticing at the same time.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I have developed a pretty good system where we'll order an appetizer and main plate and share or something along those lines, and we did that here as well to sample a few different dishes. We chose two small plates and one large one: the braised beef and lamb and ricotta meatballs to start, and the Wagyu beef steak to finish.\\n\\nI'll be honest, I think I like the appetizers better than the main dish. And the presentation for everything was impeccable.The meatballs came out with spring peas and a slightly spicy sauce underneath each, which provided a really nice kick to complement their more mild flavor, and the braised beef was pull apart tender and also very well seasoned with some nice peas and pesto to complement it.\\n\\nThe Wagyu beef was served with sauteed spinach, red mole (very good), and a special onion(?), I'd never eaten before. It was also well prepared and presented, but I felt the dish was a little small for the larger price tag it commanded.\\n\\nWhen it came time for dessert, I couldn't pass up the steamed English bread pudding, and that was an excellent choice: very sweet, very moist, and topped with a dollop of fresh whipped cream and crispy, roasted apples for garnish. Delish.\\n\\nAnd last, but certainly not least, the company was great. I love it when Yelpers get together because it's such a unique community of people from all over Atlanta and all walks of life. That's what was really the cherry on top.\\n\\nWhile I don't quite think 4th & Swift is worth 5 stars, it's definitely a strong 4, and if you happen to be going on a company's expense account, even better. Nice job 4th & Swift.

Appetizers were good.  Order seemed to take a long time to come but we were happy to get because we were hungry. My sister noticed her fish seemed to be old & did not look right.  Another guest also had the same fish & said the same thing.  The lobster in my meal, my daughter's, & another guest were over cooked.  It was very chewy & almost rubber like.  We had to call the waitress over several times to complain about the issues & then finally told her we needed to speak with a manager. As we were telling the manager the issues, I said let me try my sausage.  I go to split my sausage in half & while Rafael is looking & standing next to me, there is a straight blonde looking hair in the sausage.  My stomach was turned by then & I told him I did not want another lobster nor the rest of my food.  I had only ate a few shrimp & most of my snow crab.  He said that has never happened.  My daughter opted to receive another lobster to replace her over cooked one.  I am not sure how the other guests solved the problems they had on their tickets.

First, the Portland Dining Month special excluded their top cuts of meat. We each went ahead and did the regular $52 meal so we could have some rib eye and tenderloin. For that $20 additional per person, we each got one tiny serving of each of those cuts. Literally 2 bites of each. They sure did bring the lesser quality sirloin and chicken to our table often though. \\n\\nWe only got served sides once. The \\"sides\\" consisted of less than a cup of mashed potatoes and three pieces of polenta, and three caramelized bananas (for a table of four!). We had to ask for more bread, repeatedly. For \\"all you can eat\\" they sure are stingy. It's not like you can help yourself to those things - they are each brought by different servers, so there is no continuity at your table, no one keeping track of what you might need - you are simply at the mercy of who brings what and when. The servers come and go so quickly with no regard for what else you might need - they are just focused on what type of meat they are delivering.  \\n\\nThe second helping of bread I requested for the table didn't arrive until our party was finished eating. I was not allowed to take it to go, since that is against their policy. It seems like they want it both ways, the price and rules of all you can eat, with the smaller portion and high price of a high end restaurant.  We won't be back."},{"name":"Sullivan's Steakhouse","address":"300 Colorado St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I think Sullivan's has declined as far as price vs. quantity of food ratio goes.

What they claim is \\"The Best Burger in Town\\" is overpriced and the cut of meat is somewhat small.  \\n\\nMy basis of comparison is the Sullivan's in Houston, where the portion of meat is consistently much larger than what I get at the one in Austin.  Not only that, but when I say I want it cooked \\"MEDIUM\\", I mean it.  Not \\"WELL DONE\\".  In addition, the bun is rock hard and almost a mile high, making the burger experience quite a bit difficult to enjoy.\\n\\nFinally, to add insult to injury, when I sub fries for potato chips, I get half a handful.  That is reprehensible, considering that potatoes are one of the cheapest bulk items to purchase in the food service industry.  \\n\\nI mentioned my complaint to my waitress, and she said there was nothing that she could do, and so I asked to speak with the manager but was told one was not available.

The reason is that you are dining at an airport and they can't take the chance that you get sick on the plane from undercooked food.  This seems silly and overly parental, and all the more so because it is outside security (you are not necessarily traveling; you could be waiting for someone).

So, you definitely need to figure out what works for you and if you'll have to order a side or appetizer as well, just to get full.\\n\\nService was so slow though. I get that it was Friday night, but reading some other reviews - it looks like it's a common occurrence. Also, when we got there, we only had two girls and were waiting for one more.

If you can get one of the coveted parking spots next to the drive through lane, you can go in, order, and then enjoy your food outside on one of the many semi shaded picnic benches. We went with a group of wet swimmers after just having left Barton Springs pool, so sitting outside on picnic benches suited us perfectly. It's nice to find a place that wet people can go and not have a problem (this is a Houston person talking, I bet these places are much more plentiful in Austin).  I was amazed at how pleasant it was in late July outside at 1pm. Bizarre. In the shade, it just didn't feel that hot. I guess that humidity that we Houston people feel every day just doesn't make it to Austin. Lucky them. \\n\\nOur food was pretty quick. The chicken burger is not a chicken breast. It is a ground and then formed chicken burger. It wasn't bad, just be aware of what you are ordering.  The burgers are small, but the prices are cheap! The french fry portions are actually quite large.  One order of fries can happily feed two not starving people. We also ordered the veggie burger to try. They really should rename the veggie burger the \\"mushroom\\" burger, because it has a very strong mushroom taste. It wasn't bad, just a little unbalanced. Oh, and the kids we were with loved the chocolate milkshakes.\\n\\nCheap with lots of outdoor (only outdoor) seating fit our needs perfectly, but I can see where you might want to eat something and be shielded from the elements (not that it ever rains in Austin anymore)."},{"name":"El Borrego De Oro","address":"3900 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"So I've never actually been to their brick and mortar location but I eat their breakfast tacos almost every morning from summermoon and it's the best part of my morning!

The fries are thinly sliced onion and potatoes which look like a fried web. They are a delight for fries fans like me. Coming to the pot pie, who wouldn't call pot pie a hearty dish. The crust is cooked to perfection, the filling is creamy and flavorful. This was our group's favorite. \\n\\nThe entree items gave a tough competition to the starters. Fish and chips are regular beer battered fried fish served with fries. The fish is moist, flaky and tasty. Coming to the newcastle chicken, it is well cooked chicken breast with lemony flavour served over a bed of mashed potatoes and veggies. The veggies are tasty and are packed with butter, lemon and little pepper flavours.

They have other, non-seafood items as well such as smoked turkey and burgers. \\n\\nLike the name implies, it's all about the seafood. We tried half dozen of their Blue Point Oysters. It came with cocktail sauce, horseradish, and cilantro mignonette. The oysters were fresh and delicious. I loved the condiments too. I wished I ordered a whole dozen of this, not half. \\n\\nI tried their lobster Roll. It came on a nice, toasted bun. It was okay. It was too small and bland. It did come with melted butter. That helped with the flavor a bit. But I think they needed something extra to make it taste like something. The lobsters tasted fresh though. It wasn't a bad lobster roll. I wished it was bigger, meatier, and more flavorful.\\n\\nTheir fries tasted good. Their cole slaw tasted good. Their hush puppies tasted good. The hushpuppies tasted like they had a bit of heat to them. Or maybe it was leftovers from the cocktail sauce. Whatever it was, I liked it.\\n\\nTheir Mahi Mahi sandwich is a messy sandwich to eat. For some reason, the bun disintegrated fast. Instead of using shredded lettuce, they should've used a whole lettuce on the bottom to protect the bottom bun from the liquids. Also, I think they should toast the bun as well. It could improve the sandwich. \\n\\nThe Po Boy was okay. This was hard to eat. There's no way to hold it like a real sandwich and eat it. All the contents spilled out. It looked good when it came out, but it was another small sandwich. It felt like it was mostly bread instead of shrimp. I liked the sandwich though. \\n\\nOn Thursday nights, they have 50 cent Gulf Oysters and .75 Blue Point Oysters. So that's the night to go have some cheap oysters. \\n\\nI liked this place.

While we were waiting in line, a waitress brought out waffles for us to try (10/10 convinced us to stay in line). Since we had all that time to wait, we decided on what to order as soon as we got seated: Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict ($14), The Gravy Coupe ($15), and a single slice of red velvet pancake ($6).\\n\\nWe started with the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict. It was incredibly flavourful, and definitely the lightest one out of the 3 dishes we ordered. It was paired with a few pieces of fruit and hash browns. And my goodness - those hash browns. So nice and crisp. I could've ate just a bowl full of hash browns. The portion is large enough to make you full, but keeps you wanting more. At $14, the portion size and quality makes this the salmon benny with the most bang for your buck in Vancouver.\\n\\nNext up we had The Grave Coupe. This was my favourite out of the three dishes. It is definitely a heavy meal. I mean, it includes a large biscuit, fried chicken, 2 eggs, hash browns, AND sausage gravy. Carbs on carbs on carbs! I would've never thought that eggs and chicken would have made such a nice pairing. It's extremely delicious, and although I felt like I was going to explode by the end of it, I didn't want it to end.\\n\\nThe red velvet pancake is not your average pancake - it's huge. It was super fluffy, and tasted exactly like a rich red velvet cake would. The cream cheese icing was a great addition, making maple syrup unnecessary.\\n\\nAs annoyed I am that they don't take reservations and I'll have to wait a lifetime to get a seat next time...

The concept is fun and innovative and with so many options presented I felt like a kid in a candy store.\\n\\nNow for the food. As one  would expect from a Kevin Gellispie restaurant the food is excellent.  Each dish is small and meant to be shared. However, I think 3 or 4 people per dish is the max that can be shared and still be able to tour the entire menu of 15 or so dishes, plus the awesome cocktails. My fave out of the 11 dishes we had was the Brasstown Beef Shortrib Sauerbraten with Beef Fat Potatoes and Braised Cabbage, which took a traditional German staple dish and turned it on its head.  The flavors were amazing and each of the small sides were perfectly executed.  My favorite cocktail was the toasted old fashioned, which with bourbon, bitters, burned sugar on the rim and topped off with a br√ªl√©e cinnamon stick (actually lit up in front of you) and then squeeze a bit of orange peel oil onto the burning cinnamon stick, you end up with a burnt orange/cinnamon flavor and small show when the  oil lights up into the glass. Classy. \\n\\nDessert was really good and although my two friends and I were reaching maximum density from all the food and imbibement, we chose the white chocolate mousse, dolce ganache, passion fruit and banana cake.

The first time, I was with 3 other people and the Elite Eight (March Madness for non-sports people) was on TV. We expected a crowd, but the place was empty. Only a couple of other tables had people and so while our service was good, it wasn't great. The food was delicious, but my order was screwed up and I had to wait for them to fix it. Service issues when the place is empty is always annoying.\\n\\nMy second visit was horrible. This time, there were 3 of us on a Saturday night during the Final Four. We showed up at 720pm and there were a few people standing at the front. Turns out most were picking up to-go orders and there was one other group of 3 waiting before us and noticeably 3 open booths within our line of sight. We were quoted a 20 minute wait, so my friends went to the bar to get drinks. The hostess grabbed me after 4 to 5 minutes and took me to a table while my friends paid for their beers at the bar.\\n\\nAfter we sat in the booth for 25 minutes without so much as a glance from anyone, one of my friends stopped the hostess as she was walking by to ask why we had not been even greeted by a server. She apologized and took a drink order (by writing it on her hand). She came by a minute later and said the manager would be bringing our drinks. The manager did deliver our drinks - I never got his name, but he looked like Rick Flair. He said a server would be right over.\\n\\nAfter another 20 minutes, no server had been by. We were starving (at least now I had something to drink). My friend again, stepped out of the booth and grabbed the first server she saw, Bonnie. She explained we had been here for over 45 minutes without anyone coming by (on their own) and she was very apologetic and took our food order. She also noted what we were drinking. It was great of her to take our order, but she disappeared.\\n\\nLuckily, our apps showed up in 20 minutes and we inhaled them - good thing too as our entrees showed up 7 minutes later. At this point, my friend stopped the manager, \\"Rick,\\" and explained the issues we had been having. He actually blamed us for having gotten drinks at the bar - we clearly confused the staff to thinking someone had handled us already. This was atrocious - we had let him know of the issue 30 minutes into our experience and he told us a server would be over - yet no one came. Had we not stopped Bonnie, we would still be sitting their, starving.\\n\\nThe food was good, half my wings were cold, however. I ordered a double and split the sauces. The Spicy BBQ wings were cold, so clearly had been sitting a bit. The Lemon Pepper were piping hot. I did get one refill on my iced tea when the food was delivered as I asked the server (don't know her name), for one. \\"Rick\\" did comp the beers ordered at the table - great for my friends, but that did not do anything for me as I was the DD and not drinking. $25 worth of free beers for my two friends, nothing comped for me.\\n\\nThey were in the weeds, but in no way were they properly staffed or trained to handle a full restaurant.

Of the 4, I thought the chicken and vegetarian fillings were good (if a little underseasoned), the pork was lacking flavor, and the sweet potato (lacking flavor and with a soupy texture) was not my favorite. On top of that, as others have said in their reviews, the dough to filling ratio seemed to favor the dough, too much. \\n\\nI am generally a believer that we should value and price Asian cuisines comparably with European/American cuisines, so I don't mind $3-$4 per bao, but with the dough ratio imbalance, it felt skimpy on the filling for the price.

I took small amounts of a lot of things, but still only ended up with a partial sampling of what they offer.  There were even a couple of sliced meats (a salami and proscuitto, if I remember correctly), along with cheese and just about everything you might classify as a salad or a salad component.  \\nThe big surprise of my evening came during the tableside service, when meats are sliced for you, right onto your plate.  The ability to flip your indicator over and tell the wait staff that you do not need anything more (at least temporarily) lets you both have a constant supply of new, different, hot items to be eating, but it also allows everyone at your table to be at slightly different points in their meals, allowing for easy conversation as some people may be taking a break, and others happily chewing.
