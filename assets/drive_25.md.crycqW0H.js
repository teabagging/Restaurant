The servers were extremely friendly and professional and although we had a big party, they kept the drinks flowing and the food arrived hot and so freaking delicious!!!! So, first I started with a Spiked Mango Lemonade....It was good...It was made with mango Vodka... For the appetizer, I had Sambusa with ground beef in it. It is sort of like an eggroll without the cabbage and carrots...It came with this spicy sauce...For my entree I had the Chicken Tibs, with rice, and Gomen, which is basically sauteed collard greens....Everything was sooooooo amazing!! My friend ordered lamb which tasted great and another friend ordered the short ribs which were delivered to her sizzling from the skillet!!! Another lady was vegetarian and she got a beautiful looking vegetarian platter, so there's something for everyone!! All in all everything was awesome....The food, drinks, staff (Nansanet and Jodana, I don't think that's correct) Oh and the music had me feeling like I was on an island somewhere... The food prices weren't bad...My chicken entree was $11...The appetizer was $3...and the drinks were about $8.....I love that there was a private lot, so you don't have to worry about paying for parking but it does stay packed!!!

He even showed us a brand new drink menu, etc.  All of the food sounded so luxurious and tempting...but you only live once so we went for it.  I had a Greek salad with kalamata olives, feta, and a beautiful big garlic doughnut on the side....MY GOD, it was unreal!!  The greens were fresh and crisp and the garlic doughnut was a tempting delicacy I had never consumed until that day...and I will never forget it. The Feta was forgotten upon serving but the ever vigilant bartender took care of that.\\n\\nMy man had a cheeseburger, sandwiched in between to glorious donuts....he was skeptical of this flavor concoction too but, quickly became a believer.  His burger was fat juicy, and full of flavor.  We didn't speak the entire time we ate :)\\n\\nThe dessert doughnut we split, and of course it was another menu win!! Overall the food menu and its offerings were executed wonderfully, and were definitely well worth the  glutenous caloric adventure we embarked on.

I tried to talk to a few waitress (as were seated at the end near their cash register checkout, by the bathrooms) and quite honestly not one even mustered a hello back...and sometimes that is all it takes to kill an otherwise good experience.  \\n\\nThis food is not for everyday consumption however, we will certainly go back for another visit.

We took a short drive out of the downtown area over to the original FLIP Burger Boutique. We arrived here during a hot and muggy mid afternoon and it was the perfect time to grab something to eat and cool off at the same time.\\n\\nThe restaurant has a modern and casual atmosphere with a bright open dining area. In the middle of the dining area, there are several white tables spaced very close lined up in communal fashion with metal high chair seats surrounded by comfy booths along the left wall, table seating in the front and counter seating in the back and at the bar. We were promptly seated at a communal table and our waiter arrived to take our drink orders. We looked over the long paper menus contemplating which of the delicious burgers and appetizers we were going to try out. \\n\\nMy friend, who is a big Top Chef fanatic , on a whim, suddenly asked the waiter if \\"Chef Richard\\" was in the building, but was told the Chef was out of town that day. It was a long shot, but my friend decided to ask that question since we were already in the building and we drove over 1,000 miles to visit Atlanta.\\n\\nFor starters, the Parmesan Zucchini Fries (no longer on the menu) were nice and hot with a crispy breading (not too greasy) with soft zucchini sticks inside and topped with grated parmesan cheese. \\n\\nFor burgers, I enjoyed the Chorizo (chorizo spiced pork, hashbrowns, fried egg, manchego, Spanish paprika, romesco ketchup, smoked mayo) with a side of house made fries. My friend enjoyed special burger of today, which was the Cuban (spicy pork, cured ham, bacon, smoked dijon mayo, Swiss cheese, pickles, comichons, moja & cilantro) with a side of steamed vegetables medley (broccoli, red onions, red peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms). Our burgers were cooked perfectly which had very interesting combinations of ingredients and flavors, but nonetheless very good. The fries were very crispy outside and light & soft potato inside. \\n\\nFor dessert, I decided on the KRISPY KREME MILKSHAKE (blended with vanilla ice cream, milk and a Krispy Kreme glazed doughnut) which was very sweet and refreshing. This was the BEST MILKSHAKE I've had in a very long time and a fantastic ending to my interesting meal. Krispy Kreme doughnuts are one of my guilty pleasures and back home in NH, I have to travel across two state lines for my Krispy Kreme doughnuts fix. \\n\\nThe service was good for the most part. The waiter was very informative and made suggestions about the food. The food arrived in timely fashion, but we were initially given Fried Pickles instead of the Parmesan Zucchini Fries. This snafu was corrected after I pointed out the wrong item to the waiter and Zucchini Fries arrived 5 minutes later.\\n\\nOverall, we enjoyed a good early dinner, just in time before the evening rush hour, as we headed back to our hotel in Marietta. We would definitely return to FLIP Burger Boutique next time we're back in the ATL.\\n#2500 Yelps"},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I am not a doughnut fan, but I am writing this on behalf on the family because they love donuts.\\n\\nDoughnut Ordered: Verona: Chocolate Ganache on Top, Cream Filled\\n\\nThe verdict was that it was delicious, but I am glad that we only purchased one because it was soooo sweet, they had to split it anyways....the chocolate ganache goes everywhere. very melty.

I like a little more sugar and juice, but props for not using neon green fake mix. \\n\\nAnother easy fix to a complaint would be portion size. For example a side of black bean salad although quite delicious was basically a couple of bites in a ramekin. Another easy fix: These Yankees don't offer brewed iced tea (only bottled). \\n\\nAll in all this is a fun place especially for a casual date or group outing. My favorite dish was the sesame beef taco. Yum.

Highly recommend this place for someone appreciate food.\\nThe bread they use to wrap up the food is made out of a specific type of grass( based on my wife's assumption lmao). So you can taste a little bit sourness in there but it also balanced out the strong flavor from all the dishes. \\nWe also ordered the fresh made coffee which is a big surprise to me since I only drink Cuban coffee(a really strong coffee). I know some people don't like the bitterness from coffee in general. But if you ever wannna give coffee another shot, this is the place you should go. Their coffee is made from their fresh ground coffee beans. It smells like the air after a heavy rain. The best part is that it does not have the bitterness that you probably would get from most coffee.

That's three mammoth pies with toppings of your liking for under $29. Pretty wild if you're throwing a get together!  Their seating layout is basic, comfortably seating less than 20 people in vinyl booths, but for prices and quality as admirable as those offered by Napolitaly, I can comfortably say that this is one of the few places where I wouldn't mind eating while standing up, or just grabbing my food to go.  \\n\\nIt's just that good.

They called and told her they had another order from our building come in after hers and pushed her delivery time out to 12-12:15 so they could deliver both orders at once.  Our lunch breaks are from 12-12:30 and we don't have an option to modify our break times.  She said 12:15 would be an acceptable delivery time since it would still leave her 15 minutes to eat, but it is a little insensitive and inconvenient to change delivery times for a customer when you really should modify things on the store side.\\n\\nYesterday, this same coworker ordered lunch for both her and myself.  She ordered more than an hour before and was given the 12-12:15 delivery time.  We didn't mind because we thought we would for sure have time to eat and it was better to know up front when the food was going to be delivered instead of expecting it and then getting a call saying it would be late.  Well... we got a call anyway and they requested to push our delivery out until 12:30.  My coworker explained that this was the second time in a row that they bumped our order out and that our lunch is over at 12:30 so we would not have time to eat.  The person she spoke with said she would send the order out as soon as it was ready and it would arrive by 12:15.  Shortly before 12:15 we got a call saying that the order wouldn't be here until after 12:30.  We pleaded with the worker to please try and get our sandwiches out to us, by this time we were already on our lunch and didn't have time to consider a back up option.  We were hungry!  She said she would speak to her manager and see if he could run it down to us.  Apparently the manager didn't feel like doing that because we didn't receive our food until after 12:30.  We were late coming back from lunch and didn't even get to eat any of it until 2 hours later.  Even worse, the delivery driver was completely unapologetic, she didn't even say sorry or anything.  The company did absolutely nothing to make things right and clearly does not value customers.\\n\\nRegardless of how good the food and shakes are here, I most likely will not return.

It was good- definitely gourmet style burgers, but I think I would have enjoyed it much more if I was not vegetarian. 1st of all- Austin has been good to me so far in terms of veggie options, even at non-veg places, but WHY do all of the veggie patties have to be black bean?! I hate black bean burgers. They make everything taste southwestern even if that is not the style of dish you ordered and they mix them with grains so it ends up a pile of mush. I wish for a \\"meat\\"-ier, more textured fake patty like Boca! I also ordered the wheat bun, which I did not like because it wasn't so much wheat as multigrain with tons of chunky sunflower seeds all over it. Blah. \\n\\nI ordered the Primetime, with the aforementioned veggie patty, & it came with carmelized onions, arugula, brie (YES!), tomatoes, & steak sauce. I also added a fried egg & avocado. The toppings were delicious. It was the juciest, messiest burger I have ever eaten, so don't come here on a date if you care about looking dainty, ladies! It would have been SO good except for the patty & bun, which, well, is pretty much what a burger is. I can't help the patty, but next time I would def order the same burger with a regular bun. & extra brie. \\n\\nMy friend had the Greek burger, which was good, but he wasn't so excited about. I told him it was because he had to order a weird one with lamb meat. He did love the truffle fries & say they were the best fries he has ever eaten- & he had never tried truffle before. He was expecting chocolate truffles at first...\\n\\nThey also serve 512 Pecan Porter, which has quickly become my fave local beer. &  am not typically a dark beer lover. Next time I am trying the Coronita dumped in one of their frozen margs! They also have red velvet shakes with a chunk of cake on top. I was side-eyeing our neighbors order.\\n\\nYes, the wait was LONNNNNG, but it moved as fast as possible, although prepare to wait a good hour or so, outside, out the door, around the corner.

The chicken is pretty solid here, not overly greasy at all like most places. Decent texture with a slight kick in spice, not really that noticeable. Some things that need to change:\\n\\n1 - Stop the use of plastic utensils (my friends plastic fork actually melted while trying to dig in) that coupled with the fork just bending and offering no useful purpose whatsoever on the chicken was frustrating. And yes, I know you can obviously eat with your hands, but if you are leaving the office and trying to get back in a hurry while not trying to make a mess of yourself, well.. then...  \\n\\n2- No need for Styrofoam plates either (I get what you are trying to accomplish here, but it's downtown and it just causes a mess)\\n\\n3 - Why is there a random woman's high heel shoe hanging off a sign on the wall? did someone say \\"hey, lets put a single high heel hanging up off that sign\\"\\n\\n4 - Add a handle to the rear corner exit door so if people need to step out for a call to be answered, they can walk back in without having to walk around the corner of the block and back in the front main entrance. \\n\\n5- Napkin dispensers on the table...once it reaches about 50 percent full, good luck sticking your hand in trying to wiggle your fingers down trying to grab a napkin.  \\n\\nThe sides, I DO NOT recommend the sides. Mac was cold and cheddar on top wasn't even melted due to the temp of the dish. Beans, well they tasted can-like and nothing special going on here. The coleslaw, well... it was coleslaw. \\n\\nLike i said at first, the chicken here is pretty solid, it's a nice change up for a lunch spot downtown, is it worth going out of your way for?

Whenever a new burger joint opens in Austin, I am one of the first to try it. I've also flirted with vegetarianism in the past, only for my ambition to meet demise at the hands of a juicy burger. It is my favorite soul-meal, therefore I am extra critical in my critique. So here we go..\\n\\nI recently experienced Hopdoddy Burger Bar for the first time and left feeling slightly underwhelmed. But firstly, let me talk about the positives.\\n\\nHopdoddy's atmosphere is terrific. Unpretentious Old Austinites beware- this place is the definition of New Austin-chic. Personally, I'm okay with that. The high ceilings with exposed A/C, liberal employment of cold cement, and exposed feaux brick make this restaurant seem straight out of Dallas's Mockingbird Station. This definitely attracts a certain demographic of So-Co-er's embodying a \\"cooler-than-thou\\" vibe. Having been born and raised in Austin, I do agree with some of those reading this description: yes it's disgusting. However I believe there is hope for this typically cold, impersonal aesthetic. Think GQ gastro-bar. The uber-chic vibe successfully mates with the rootsy SoCo locale somewhat entirely to the blown up photo portraits of Willie Nelson and other Austin notables. This charming touch offers a refreshing (and much-needed) sense of originality. This, in addition to taking advantage of one of Austin's best people-watching opportunities in South Congress- due to an all glass facade- tie the whole package up in a decent, palatable way.\\n\\nThe menu reads widely tantalizingly. I ordered the Buffalo Bill (I'm a sucker for anything with bleu cheese, much less combined with buffalo sauce). Soda fountain options featured the somehow expected Maine Root drink line and Dublin Dr Pepper (the pretentiousness begs for it).\\n\\nThings went south when, after 45 minutes, people who sat down after me began to receive their orders. As it turned out, my order wasn't processed correctly and essentially never happened. This was a definite downturn.\\n\\n I didn't give Hopdoddy a one star review due to the swift response of the waitstaff, as well as the full-refund. Many restaurants in a similar situation might give a coupon redeemable for a free burger next time, at best (a bonafide ripoff). But instead they appropriately refunded my lunch.\\n\\nWith momentum back on their side, I eagerly awaited my burger. The Buffalo Bill was pretty good. It wasn't belt-bustingly filling and didn't underwhelm. I personally prefer my beef medium-well.. My tastes became in direct conflict with a very medium-rare patty.\\n\\nAfter over an hour, I left Hopdoddy with a very \\"meh\\" attitude. They earned their points back after the derailing order mishap, but there's a lot of room separating them from old guard favorites such ad Phil's, Hilbert's, huts, and dirtys. Nevertheless I'm optimistic about where Hopdoddy will be in 6 months. Considering their eagerness to cover up potential PR fiascoes, i believe that Once the feedback is in, they will respond appropriately and evolve their product as needed."},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I don't leave Austin until I get my chicken.

So much so, that I would say that the restaurant helped us build our relationship, as it became \\"our spot\\"...This being said, we have not been there even once the past 6 months. \\n\\nI have been a patron at the restaurant about 100 times, and 80% of these visits were positive (good food, ambiance, service, prices & conveniently located on Western Ave). With that said, the last 5 times we ate there, we were treated horribly. The last experience in particular was the final straw. \\n\\nThey are open until 3pm on Sundays, and we arrived at around 2pm on this particular day. Upon arriving, the waitresses completely ignored us, so we sat and waited for someone to take the order. After waiting 10-15 min my hunger/impatience got the best of me, and I simply placed the order myself directly to the chef who cooks behind the breakfast bar...Now it gets better...I understand it was later in the day, and they had lots of orders well before we arrived, but the chef screwed up our order not only once or twice but three separate times. To make matters worse, there was only one other couple eating there at the time. How can they screw up orders when there are only 2 groups eating in the restaurant???? Not to mention, they made snotty remarks, and complained about us \\"coming in late.\\" If I remember correctly it was along the lines of: \\"what do you expect considering were closing in an hour?\\" I don't understand how a restaurant can treat their customers like that. I'm sorry, but if your sign says you are open until 3, I should be able to walk in at 2:45 and still expect to be served. If you don't want to serve people past a certain time, don't seat people or put up a sign.\\n\\nAfter all this, we were still charged in full, and simply cut our losses moving forward. We gave The Breakfast Club 5 opportunities to make up for the poor service we received our last few times going there (along the same lines of the experience mentioned above), but unfortunately, they failed...In conclusion, there are better restaurants in Allston to get breakfast, and I'm saddened that my girlfriend and I can no longer call The Breakfast Club \\"our spot.\\""},{"name":"Veracruz All Natural","address":"2505 Webberville Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"One of the best fish tacos in town.

So today, when it was wrong again for at least the 8th time I  a row, I asked how I should order so that it gets made right. It was suggested by the trainer (or maybe the name tag said trainee, not sure) to order it as the Buffalo ranch chicken wrap with mild instead of medium. Gee thanks. That's exactly how I've been ordering it. So he suggested that I order the tender wrap and add mild and ranch. Somehow he must have thought that would be more easily interpreted. Sigh.

The donut really complimented the burger, giving it the same soft yet crispy bite.\\n \\n-Dirty plucker (a brunch item) - so good as well. Basically pieces of fried chicken plopped on top of a hot donut. Comes with honey butter sauce. Just a fantastic combination of flavors.\\n\\n-Miss shortcake - very good dessert donut with cream cheese filling topped with strawberries.

Some of my favorite items there just tasted completely wrong and gross. This has happened many times over the past year of visits. It's really become obscure to keep spending money at an establishment that can't keep consistency. There's other buffets in this town that are actually better.

Relaxing and laid back, I've never had a problem getting a table or great service. Even when there was a question with our order, the chef personally came out and clarified things with us.

Our evening did not start well as our reservation was not ready and we ended up waiting at the bar for about 15-20 minutes. The bar and waiting area is not set up for a large amount of people therefore it was fairly overcrowded and uncomfortable, not to mention the bar had several empty beer cans from previous customers that hadn't been cleared. The decor is also very tacky with neon green Xmas lights, Asian decorations and outdated contemporary rock music being played.\\n\\nOnce we were seated we were given our choices from the price fix date night menu. We order the \\"hot date\\" selection. The first plate arrived about 15-20 minutes later, but it was the wrong order and was promptly taken back by the server. We waited another 10 minutes and were served the \\"tiger\\" steak salad. The meat was cooked perfectly although served cold ( I was expecting a hot dish). The seasoning was way too salty and unnecessarily seasoned but included a nice bed of peppers that were flavorful.\\n\\n The next dish served was the Hakku eggplant. This dish was steaming hot, but the eggplant was extremely bland and the consistency was mush ( almost like babyfood). This dish was basically inedible as it had zero flavor and awful texture.\\n\\nThe 3rd plate served was the chicken stir fry. We didn't think this could be any worse than the previous dishes since its a basic item on most Asian menus but we were wrong. The dish again was overly salty and very oily. The chicken was cooked fine, but the veggies( broccoli, bok choy etc) had a burnt taste that could've been from using previously used oil in the wok ( just my guess). \\n\\nLastly we received our final dish, the pork lettuce wraps. These \\"wraps\\" were a bizarre mixture of skewered pork sausages on a bed of wilted oil soaked lettuce. We were instructed to wrap the pork with the lettuce to eat. This was a difficult and messy process as the pork pieces were very thick and cooked onto a skewer and the lettuce basically fell apart from being soaked in the pork fat/ oil dripping from the meat. Along with the terrible presentation of this dish, the pork just tasted awful. Very bland again, much like a pork \\"burger\\" in the shape of a small sausage. We both agreed this meat would've tasted much better on a roll with some ketchup. The pork needs to be a smaller serving either shredded/ ground or bite sized pieces in order to properly wrap ( a la PF Changs lettuce wraps....they could learn a thing or 2 about modern Americanized Asian fusion dishes from the other Chang chain.)\\n\\nWhen our waitress ( who was very nice and pleasant) returned to ask about our meal we told the truth....it did not live up to our expectations, the food was flavorless and bland, masked by too much salt and the consistencies were not very appetizing. \\n\\nThe waitress returned with a complimentary dessert. The vanilla bean and mango crushed ice. This too was underwhelming, flavorless crushed ice and freezer burned generic vanilla ice cream is not my idea of a make up gift. \\n\\nWe will not be returning to this restaurant anytime soon."},{"name":"Parish Cafe and Bar","address":"361 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Went here one evening for a dinner with some colleagues and it was a great little spot.

The shrimp was cooked nicely, but the sauce was overpowered with vinegar flavor and very runny...it was hard to keep any sauce on the shrimp to eat. Would not order again.\\nThe corn quesadilla with chicken was good, but I would have preferred chicken breast vs dark meat chicken. The corn was yummy and the cojito cheese was a perfect addition, but it wasn't served as I would have expected...more like a soft taco than a quesadilla. It was really awkward to eat. Would probably not order that dish again either...wasn't 'wowed', just more curious to try the combination.\\nThe (Cod) fish and chips were the best dish ordered. The fish tasted fresh, and you could tell they were freshly battered and fried. They were a little greasy, but not too bad. The fries were good too, nice seasoning and not too greasy. The cabbage slaw was good and the caper tartar sauce was delicious! Would definitely order this dish again.\\nOverall, we would come back to try more dishes.

I do not care. \\nSpeaking of grandmothers, mine loves Richard Blais. But, she cannot get his name right ever, which is actually some sort of genetic thing because my mom does this too on occasion with people who are not Richard Blais (like Formula 1 World Champion Nigel Button). My grandma calls him Henry Blais, and every time I talk to her she makes sure to ask if I have been to his restaurant lately. \\n\\nI have tried plenty of burgers, but I have to say my favorite has been one that was a special for a couple days last week: a Chicago Dog Burger. I was kind of let down by the fact they couldn't even get actual sport peppers for a couple days worth of burgers, but whatever. I at least got over the fact they listed ketchup as an ingredient, because YOU CAN ASK FOR NO KETCHUP. There is no need to worry about the genuine Chicago hot dog-ness of the burger because...it is a burger. In any case it was a fascinating thing to do with a burger to me, although it obviously doesn't taste like a hot dog, it was still really, really good, right down to the taste of the celery salt. The farm burger is another of my favorites, although now everything comes with grass fed beef so its price point seems a bit high now. \\n\\nI can never go here without having a shake. I can't even decide which one is my favorite. I tried the Krispy Kreme because it was the cheapest, even though I don't like the doughnuts, and I have ended up ordering that one the most because I absolutely love the shake. The turtle shake is another favorite, because I am addicted to caramel, but last time I had a rice krispies shake.\\nYes. Rice krispies. It was seriously like drinking a rice krispies treat but better. I almost cried of joy.\\n\\nI never feel like the burgers are too small, granted I am not really a fan of having a half pound burger because that is just overboard. If you get a shake, you're set. If you do that whole lunch special, you are probably stuffed. It does cost a bit more, but I will spare everyone the economics lesson.

The menu was spot-on compared to the restaurants where I dined in Turkey. \\n\\nGo for the food. For heaven's sake, go try their food.\\n\\nNow, the service is a little of a different story. A colleague and I went to Truva for lunch, at a time where most people are getting the buffet, and the kitchen is focused on producing food for the buffet. But we didn't want the buffet--we wanted the pide, Turkey's unique and delicious pizzas. We left our self a ton of time--an hour and a half--before we even would have to leave to get back to our conference.\\n\\nWe got our drinks, and then we waited. And waited. And waited. Once, the waiter came by and said it would be just a minute longer. And we waited some more. Nearly an hour went by where we only sipped soda. We only had another half hour before we would have to be back. Another fifteen minutes went by. We finally asked our busy waiter (the restaurant was quite crowded that day) what was going on. Apparently another server had taken our meals and served them to another table (which didn't order the same thing as we did, so the table next to us had our untouched entrees the entire time, ay!) and they had to do it over again, but our waiter said the remakes would be right out. Another ten minutes--we were going to be late--still nothing. We informed the host we had been waiting for over an hour and not received our meals, and that we had to leave, which we did.\\n\\nNow, you're probably wondering, after that experience, why in the world they got four stars.\\n\\nWell, there's no Turkish restaurant where I live. Nowhere NEAR where I live, so the next day, for lunch, we went back. The restaurant was similarly busy, but I was determined.\\n\\nWe ordered the same thing as the day before, and the waitress said it would take a little longer than usual because of the buffet thing I mentioned earlier. We said we'd give it a try. And it did take a little time--but this time, it was quite reasonable--and the lahmacun, or lamb, tomato, pepper, and onion pizza--was beyond superb.\\n\\nIn short, if the buffet looks good to you, get that at lunchtime.

The North End was one of the areas I explored, and I just wanted to give my opinion.\\n\\nPROS:\\nJust has an awsome \\"raison de etre\\" about it, the Italian, Irish, and to a smaller part Jewish culture here is REAL, not just fabricated and sold on a shelf. \\n\\nGreat Natural Beauty- the park that is now where the old overpass that was removed in the big dig (not sure what it is called) is incredibly beautiful, and you can see most of Boston's landmarks in dramatic views from it. The dimly lit, flower lined streets are magical.\\n\\nSome of the Best Italian Resturants in Mass (or greater area? Don't really know) Most have great service and food. \\n\\nThe Improv Asylum is Awesome, just go there. \\n\\nCONS:\\n(Why I chose not live there)\\n\\nFact: There is not a single MBTA bus route or subway stop ANYWHERE in the north end (yes you heard right, and don't say Commerial St, because thats the street the encircles the north end, its not part of it.) So have fun getting to work every day if you work in another part of boston.\\n\\nThe concept of \\"a street\\" is a novel concept to the north end, most of them there would have trouble accomidating horses, let alone cars. In my first two days of walking around there, I saw two cars get their side view mirrors smashed off by cars trying to pass them on an already completly double parked street. I don't think a single st, besides mabey Hanover, has any actually paving on it, and most are just uneven, crazy sloped trails of asfalt and rocks.\\n\\nIt has become the \\"Little Italy Theme Park\\", most of the resturaunts and businesses cater almost exclusivly to tourists and it would be almost impossible to eat at them regulary, exept if you are a millionare, which some posh \\"perminant tourists\\" that live there are. One third of the people in the North End at any given time are tourists, one third are people from other parts of Boston, and the other third are people that live there, born there, college students, and well to do proffesionals. All there are in the North End are Italian restaurants, bakeries, and cafes, there is practically nothing else. I think there is one Chinese Restaurant and its a store front. \\n\\n90% of the buisnesses are CASH ONLY, have fun going to the ATM, paying $2 just to get your own money, and then fumbling with and mabey dropin some of it while you have it falling out of your pockets. \\n\\nThe apartments in the north end are, while a good value size wise for your money, are horribly antiquated (I don't mean not well mantained, they are ) I mean that a large number (basically the ones you can afford) don't have electric heat, and the heat comes out of the side of your stove(called gas on gas), which is anyoning because you have a big cooktop right in the middle of your living space. Most don't have laundry in the building, so you have to shlep your laundy every week to the next street over and wait there for a couple of hours to do it. Most landlords don't include utilites in the rent so you have to pay everything in fluctuating amounts every month (even hot water). Some don't even have sinks in the bathroom, only one in living area. \\n\\nThere is not a single \\"normal store\\", besides mabey true value, in the north end. No supermarkets, no big pharmacies, no electronic stores. Most are family run businesses that have widly varing degrees of quality and inventory from one day to the next, and guess what they're CASH ONLY. \\n\\nConclusion:\\nIf you are thinking of visiting there, DEFINATLY DO, you will have a memorable and long lasting experience,  give these people you money, they deserve it. \\n\\nBut if you are thinking about living there, unless you want to cut your self off from the rest of the world, and become a permanant tourist in the Italy section of Epcot, don't do it.\\n\\nI'm sorry if this review offended any one the lives or works in the North End, but this is just how I feel, and I think I've painted a pretty acurate picture, please correct me on any details if I am wrong. But the North End just isn't for me and I think it isn't for most people.

Here's the skinny (which you will not be if you eat here regularly): (1) Charming and intimate space. The communal table idea makes the best use of the space and cuts down on what would otherwise be very long wait times. We ended up discussing the various dishes with our neighbors, which added extra fun. Note that all seating, including the bar, is controlled by the host/hostess. (2) Inventive, delicious food. Straight-up meat-and-potatoes types probably will not be happy here -- some of the best dishes involve \\"parts\\" (foie gras, sweetbreads, pig trotters), so bring the more adventurous eaters in your crowd to really appreciate the experience.   Everyone will have his/her favorites, but I found the food to be uniformly very good to stellar.  (3) Four would be the ideal number in your party. If you are an omnivore, you will likely want to try everything on the menu. I wouldn't say the menu is \\"limited\\" -- there's good variety -- but we figured out that for about $150 you could order one of everything.

Note to other restaurants - this is the kind of waitstaff who can upsell a menu.\\n\\nWe had garlic naan (very light), mussels as an appetizer. For a main course, we had lamb kabobs which were beautifully cooked - juicy - but stingy with just 6 morsels. And this very nice chicken korma croquettes - again, a tiny portion that would be called a tapas (or dim sum) in any other restaurant. We finished our meal with this really refreshing mango and guava sherbet. The mango sherbet had ginger and spice so you had an ice dessert that had heat! Very cool!\\n\\nI definitely thought the food was better than the Round Rock Tarka - much more flavorful and perfectly cooked. A couple times I've been to Tarka (the fast food outlet of Clay Pit), the food has been overcooked.\\n\\nAnyway, Clay Pit is a wonderful discovery for me.

The WSJ reference in article about the stand said this was the dog to measure all others against, which set my expectations high (not usually a good thing).\\n\\nMessy, but worth it! I give it a 5 because the only other specialty place I've done is Pink's in Los Angeles, which didn't survive my high expectations.

Myers + Chang is incredible.  We had them \\"cater\\" (aka I, being the office go-for called in an order and schlepped on over to pick it up) a business lunch.  Even though I ordered from the dinner menu, they made everything exactly as we ordered and were extremely accommodating (especially considering they had to work with 4 different allergies and 2 vegetarians).  The food was fantastic, though ran us a pretty penny (portions are really only good for 1, mayyyyyyyybe 2 not-very-hungry-people, so to feed 12, that's dropping a bit o' cash).  Once again, the shrimp dumplings were fantastic, but the nirvana chicken really stole the show.  It was moist, flavorful... man, so good.  You just have to check this place out.\\n\\nI'm a big fan of Flour, and a big fan of Chinese food, so when I heard Ms. Chang was opening a Chinese restaurant in the South End my immediate thought was: SCORE!!\\n\\nAnd after going tonight, my initial reaction is:  heyyyyy, not half bad-- still working out some kinks, but for a relatively inexpensive after-work dinner, Myers + Chang serves it up nicely.  I sampled the crispy spring rolls, lemony shrimp pot stickers, and the dan dan noodle salad.  All three were fantastic!  You HAVE to get the shrimp pot stickers-- we ordered a second round because they were so good.  The Dan Dan Noodle salad was delish with the perfect plend of peanut and spice.  Also, I had a Butternut Porkslapper beer-- never heard of it before!  It was pretty great, if only because it's called \\"porkslapper.\\"\\n\\nSpeaking of pork-- my only real gripe with the place was that there are very very few options for those who don't eat pork or beef.  Most dishes contained meat, though they were very accommodating and willing to omit pork from a dish so one of my dining companions could partake.  However, if you're full veg-- your options are extremely limited.  Also a little disappointing was the lack of a dessert menu (Joanne Chang!  I'm looking at you!).  Though, the check came with bite-sized meringue clouds, which was a nice touch-- but left me wanting more.  \\n\\nPortions are quite small, so I don't understand how they can call it \\"family style,\\" but despite the size I was definitely full after the meal.  Nothing (except the dish with lobster and the wine) was over $15.  The decor was trendy, but not imposing-- clean lines and neutral, welcoming colors-- however, the seats weren't all that comfortable (no booths in sight! ).  The staff was very friendly, though obviously new.\\n\\nThis place definitely has a lot of potential.  I will certainly be back."},{"name":"Cafe Paisano","address":"182 W State Rd 434, Ste 1000","city":"Longwood","stars":"4.5","text":"First impression  always  count and this place looked the part, clean and good atmosphere ;  We were greeted  by friendly  staff and good music .Menu has a great selection  and reasonably-priced .

My bellini was not on special, but it was still good and came with a cute little plastic moose on top.  The plastic toys on top of the drinks is definitely a nice touch.  My boyfriend had a corona because those were on special (I think they called it a guy's night out special, and the server said that was because people complained Milestones was being sexist).  We both ordered the grilled chicken salad for dinner (price: $13.99).  The salads were alright, but didn't have much in them besides chicken, lettuce, cabbage, and tortilla chips drizzled in peanut sauce.  The peanut sauce was great, but I was still a bit underwhelmed by the salad in general.\\n\\nLet's talk service.  Our server was really friendly and service was relatively quick.  The only problem I had with her is that she took the plastic moose away after the meal!  I keep those and have a small collection because I think they're cute.  Minus one star for that.  \\n\\nOverall, this Milestones is pretty good, but with so many other good restaurants in the area I think I'll choose a different one next time."},{"name":"Dancing Goats Coffee Bar","address":"419 W Ponce De Leon Ave","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"love Dancing Goats coffee! i need to go back soon - not in my neighborhood but i'll make a special trip out on occasion.  very classy coffee place"},{"name":"The COOP: A Southern Affair","address":"610 W Morse Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"What's not to love here!?

These chain restaurants have succeeded for a reason: they do what is expected.\\n\\nTypically in a restaurant, you go through the following order of operations: Seating, waiting a few seconds for a waiter or waitress, placing drink orders, getting drinks and simultaneously ordering food, waiting for food, eating food, getting checked by the service, finishing food, paying bill, and giving the proper tip. Some may experience other random events, but that's how it goes.\\n\\nNot at La Mongerie. After waiting 15 minutes for a table (they were crowded, so it's no big deal) we were sat in a sticky, humid section of the restaurant. Then we waited. For 20 minutes. 20. We waited that long to place our drink orders. Since the doofus waiter took so damn long, he also took our food orders. Along with my coffee beverage, I asked for lemons for my water. So, after acknowledging our orders, the waiter left. And we waited. And waited. And waited some more. I soon learned there's nothing worse than having to sip lukewarm coffee and ice water without the ICE CUBES because the ice melted. Yes, we got our drinks. Unfortunately, they were all that we had to survive upon while, our hunger levels were increasing and more and more sweat started dripping from our brows. Seriously, it was humid as an August day in there. I still didn't get my lemons, but my water was gone so I wouldn't dehydrate.\\n\\nBut then! A glimmer of hope! The waiter, bless his heart, refilled our waters! Maybe things were looking up. No, they weren't. For you see, it took an hour for three food items to arrive. Was the food good? Honestly, I couldn't tell you because I scarfed it down like Kirby scarfs down enemies. i.e. I inhaled it. I didn't even have time to taste it. I just needed food. Oh, and still no lemons for my water.\\n\\nBy the time we were done, we used our Scout Mob app and got a whopping 15 dollars off. Yay? I guess? It still wasn't worth it. None of it was worth it. This is the most disorganized, nasty, and scummy dining establishment I've ever seen/attended. Never again. Readers of Yelp, avoid this place like the plague and go somewhere else if you want to support a non-chain and get good breakfast.\\n\\nBy the way, where the **** are my lemons?!"},{"name":"Song La","address":"411 W 23rd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I got the Bento Box, with pork, to go.

At first I was hesitant skeptical about trying out a place that offers sushi and noodles but the fact that they were one of very few places that have \\"hand pulled noodles\\" peeked my curiosity. Today most noodles are machine made and to find a place that actually do it the traditional way was definitely worth a visit. : Hand- pulled noodles are originally form China and is considered an art form.  It involves stretching out the dough like a rope and brings the ends together then stretch out again, twirling it and then stretch the dough again to its original length. This is done over and over and over again until the dough reaches the right consistency.\\n\\nConsidered an Asian comfort food, noodles have always been my favorite and Xian really blew me always.\\n\\nThey have 6 different types of noodles to choose from and they make it easy by describing the noodle type like Italian pasta. Vermicelli, spaghetti, thick spaghetti, Fettuccini, pappardelle and triangle.\\n  \\nYou also choose the flavors from soup or dry.\\n\\nWe tried one from the soup section; Tom Yam Chicken noodle soup.  Which was like the chicken coconut soup you may find in your local Thai place with a twist, the shredded tender chicken breast that was swimming with our noodle choice spaghetti style in a light tangy coconut based broth, red bell peppers enoki mushrooms bean sprouts and cilantro was to die for! \\n\\nThe other noodle dish was one from the Dry section; Dan Dan noodles.\\nNow I have eaten many Dan Dan noodles in different restaurants but this version we picked the fettuccini style noodles that accompanied tender big chucks of beef, baby bok choy, pickled vegetable, which was very unique in taste so I ask them what it was and the waitress said only that it is pickled vegetables. (After tasting, I think it may have been picked mustard greens or some secret special pickled greens that if they told me then they would have to kill me kind). Anyways, all these amazing ingredients were soaking in their Sichuan red-chili oil. It was exploding with flavors and was not your typical Dan Dan noodles from other places. \\n\\nThere were so many yummy looking things on the menu we had a very hard time choosing what to order. Finally we decided to share the spicy lobster dumplings.\\n\\nWords can't describe the taste as it was nothing like we have taste, not only the presentation was beautiful, but also the flavor was incredible. Little bundles of lobster filled dumplings, deepfried and placed on top of creamy avocados, then drizzled in some sort of a creamy spicy sauce accompanied by smelt fish roe for crunch.\\n\\nNot to be Missed!"},{"name":"Punjab Palace","address":"109 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"Relatively mediocre Indian place.

Sososo much happies. Was surprised at the lack of people, considering it was peak dinner time (6pm). Got there, and the staff were immediately attentive, even though my friend and I were not ready to order. The menu looks really appetizing--ended up getting the braised pork over rice and the pork belly buns. They guy on the truck apologetically told us that the buns would be 5-7 minutes, but we were willing to wait. Since this truck is behind the co-op, we sat down at one of the tables not in front of the actual truck, ready to get up when they called our names to pick up. They actually ended up personally bringing it over to us, and made sure we were good on everything (napkins, extra bowls for sharing, etc.).\\n\\nAnd ah yes, the food. So very filling. For the price, the portions are really large and taste delicious too!! The braised pork over rice comes in a brown to-go box, and the serving size is definitely more than enough for 2 meals (unless you eat a lot). The box comes with the pork, rice, cabbage, daikon, and an egg. Lemme just tell you now, better quality/taste/price than Coco's or Tap House. Also, they pork belly buns are a MUST TRY. Ohmygoodness, they were so tender and juicy and a delightful little bun all in one. The pork belly literally  melts in your mouth, and the cilantro is just enough. The added sprinkled peanuts are pretty good--it is a little sweet, but I like the extra addition of texture and flavor. Their milk tea is also pretty good and well worth the price. At $2.75, it comes in a regular size and WITH pearls!! The milk tea is a little strong though, so if you're weak to caffeine, I would advise trying a different flavor. I personally like their boba because it's  not too sweet and a little chewy, but my friend preferred sweeter boba and wasn't a huge fan.\\n\\nHonestly, I would come back just for the service.

A gathering of great Boston chefs, with a sandwich of their crafting all on one menu should be heaven, but it completely missed the mark. The Zuni Roll was an odd wrap/sandwich/eggroll-esque hybrid (no, it wasn't fried) and the potato salad was pretty good.

I have only had Indian food one other time and I honestly do not remember the names of what we tried unfortunately.  It was all very tasty.\\n\\nOur entrees were a variety of dishes: Mixed Grill, Daal Mahkni, Khuroos-E-Tursh, Biryani, Channa Masala.  I know there were about 7-8 entrees for us all to share but I can't remember what they all were.  I can promise that they were all absolutely delicious!  All of the spices and flavors mixed together are so fabulous!  I got very full and I had a hard time making myself stop shoveling food in my face.  I think whatever you decide to order will amaze you.  If you have never had Indian food you need to head over to The Clay Pit immediately and try it out!  Dessert was the Kheer.  I am  not usually a big fan of raisins but it was so good I barely even noticed they were in there.\\n\\nOn another note, not only did we get to enjoy a fantastic meal but one of the Chefs actually took us around for a tour of the place.

About half way through the meal, the impatient I decide to ask - how long for the salmon/avocado appetizer? To my astonishment, the waitress says \\"You didn't order that\\". \\"Yes I did\\". \\"No, you didn't\\". \\"Yes. I did.\\" \\"Do you want to order that now\\". \\"No, that's ok\\".  We keep eating, and keep waiting for the kimchi pancake (empty restaurant). After most of the food is finished, I have the audacity to ask the waitress again \\"Is the kimchi pancake almost ready?\\" \\"Oh, I don't think I put that in\\".  Looks at her notepad, which has kimchi pancake written on it. At this point we have nothing to say, and just continue with our meal.\\nNo apologies, no effort to smooth this over in any way, nothing.

The burger itself is quite a meal in itself, as the patty is about 2/3 lb. The great thing about this burger is that the meat is perfectly tender and seasoned, and appears to be some quality grade meat, unlike what you'd get at most other specialty burger places like Fuddruckers or Hut's. I'm not quite sure how to communicate how different it is, but you'll just have to eat it for yourself. I suggest ordering it medium or medium rare. You can also choose bleu, cheddar, or swiss cheese. They serve the burger on a perfectly toasted bun with lettuce, tomato, and onion and cups of dijon mustard and house mayonnaise. I love the freshly cooked, thick-cut chips that accompany the burger, and they're great for dipping. All that to say that that I've brought friends here to experience the burger for themselves many times, and no one's ever been disappointed. Call for hours.

Inside the pita came hummus, fried eggplant, babaganouh, israli salad and pickles all topped with Tahini sauce and stuffed in a pita.\\n\\nThe chicken were in nice little strips, juicy and flavorful, and the flavors were also popping with fresh flavors.  What I didn't like about the pita is each bite was completely different.  Often the meat would spill out and some bites would have no meat at all, others would only be the salad or eggplant, and I do wish the Pita was more uniform.  Having a nice chewy chicken mouthful was much more appealing than a mushy salad one.\\n\\nStaff was actually super nice and after I asked off handedly if they used flaxseed in their orders, they responded with no, but they did rattle off several items that I may be allergic to, and even put a lot of garnish and sauces on the side just in case I reacted.\\n\\nLocated right next door to Fred's Meat and Bread, this area can get congested.

It can't cost that much to get a roller or dispenser and it would be much more sanitary. I loved the decor and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves, including us! I did order a drink based on the questions I asked our server, and she was so wrong that it ended up being a waste.

This coupled with crispy potato cakes (a fancy tater tot) was perfect. My partner had the special of the day which was a bacon wrapped pork loin (really? does anything taste bad with bacon?).

His company was the best part about our time at Gusto's. Our waiter took about 15 minutes just to bring us water and a glass of wine to start. We should have left then but wanted to give this place a chance since it was our first time. When we were ready to order, I had to flag the waiter down just so we could place our dinner order. We did get the hot fresh bread to start which was only $4 (but most places provide that free especially when everything else on the menu is about $15-$40 a plate). We again had to wave down the waiter to bring over more oil for our bread which he took another 15 minutes to do. By the time we got it, we didn't even need it anymore. We ate the bread plain. The waiter never came by to pick up the wooded board the bread was brought to us on so when we finally received our food, we had very little space for our dinner plates which was slightly hanging off of the dinner table. When he decided to come by the one and ONLY time to check on us, I ask him to remove the board so I could eat comfortably, he reached over me and dropped a menu in my food. No, he did not ask me to bring me another plate or discount me for dropping a menu that plenty of others have touched into my over price (and very small piece) of lasagna. He just took it out and so \\"oh, sorry\\". I also ordered a bellini which I NEVER received and we were not aware that we could get a free desert for reserving on Yelp.

I never really liked bbq until I met you. It was nearly love at first bite. \\n\\nI was surprised to see that it's cafeteria style set up but don't let that deter you. Get a tray, choose the sides and put then in the paper boats for just $2.25. Not bad. They had a fair variety of sides such as creamed corn, grren beans, beans, Cole slaw, potato salad, peach cobbler, banana  parfait like dessert and of course, mac n cheese.\\n\\nI've had it to go when the hubs picked it up and dined in once. Sadly the last time, the potatoes were not cooked all the way, lending to a hard, slightly granular potato salad. And it seemed to have less dill weed.. that's why it's-.5*.\\n\\nWhat I've ordered:\\nPork ribs: be aware there are diff sized bones going down so if you want different section, don't be afraid to ask like I did. The \\"butcher\\" or shall I say, meat slicer, was nice enough to do so without sass or hesitation. It was tender with the perfect amount of smoke flavoring and rub. \\n\\nBrisket: lean or fatty. Remember to choose and I go all out and choose the fatty one..i don't know the correct terminology..yet who cares! The brismet has a thin rim of fat and isnt too much at all. It is so tender you really don't need a knife. And is slightly smoky and the perfect blend of seasoning encrusted onto the meat. \\n\\nSausage: thought it was okay. I actually don't remember much about it and I normally love sausage.\\n\\nThe sides:\\nThe first time I had it, my mom and hubby went crazy getting nearly all the sides except the sweets. \\n-potato salad: usually good 2/3*. Not top heavy with dill studded throughout.\\n-mac n cheese: love. Must order. Taste like it prob Velveeta in there but the pasta is cooked perfectly and the cheese sticks to it like a glove.\\n-beans: fine good flavor but I don't like beans much in general\\n-cole slaw: I liked it. It's the mayo based version, not vinegar. My friend thought it was too much mayo but I liked it. It prob be good slapped on white bread w brisket or pulled pork. \\n-corn bread: must get. Little sweet and buttery yet very moist! Mmm.\\n-banana dessert in a cup: it's banana infused mousse-like consistency is swirled with something similar to crushed graham crackers and is a nice ending to a meal. It's  the perfect size since the whole meal is belly bursting, belt buckling rich. \\n\\nPs- there's white bread, onions, pickles near the drinks too which is nice. And the three bbq sauces are each good in their own way. The sweet reminds me of a onion like vinaigrette and the spicy is too hot for me but tasty so I add a little to the regular. The regular is near perfect to me. It has seasoning in it with smoky flavor and some sweetness. Not like their meat even need much sauce..but hey it's an option! They have blue bell ice cream too but it looks like no one orders it..(It's off in the corner near the fountain drinks). Also people seem to love the outdoor seating more than inside on a lovely evening. It was full outside at 8pm on a Wed.\\n\\nGood ol' bbq..this is what Texans must be referring to.

I do. Grilled, sauteed, skewered, fried, baked, bbq'd....I like it all. Because of this, I always tend to think of myself as a chicken \\"connoisseur\\" and try to keep a pulse on the \\"must go to\\" places when it comes to sampling all things, \\"fried chicken\\". A place in Downtown Austin, TX definitely has the crowd to backup its reputation, but is their fried chicken truly some of the best in the nation?\\n\\nThe Place (4 out of 5) - SItuated in Downtown Austin, Gus's fried chicken is placed right next to a busy street that has a bunch of other restaurants in the immediate area. In addition to that, it's really hard to tell you've actually arrived at Gus's until you see the neon sign situated right above their entrance door. If that doesn't do it for you, it's the place with a bunch of people in it and a line out the door! Here's the thing, Gus's, is actually a place with quite a bit of seating inside. That being said, it gets packed REALLY quick and all of a sudden what you thought was a lot of space easily gets taken up. I went on a Saturday night and the dining hall was packed, the bar was completely full, and there was a line out the door of people waiting to get seated, waiting to get their name on the list, and waiting for their to-go orders. I was one of them. Apart from that, there was nothing too special about the area. It feels like an indoor picnic area and that's actually not a bad thing. The place gives you the feeling of someone just inviting you into their gigantic dining room and showed you where to sit. Sure, there's probably room for improvements and it may not be the best looking place, but let's be real, you're not coming to Gus's to gawk at the interior decorating, seats, and tables.\\n\\nThe Service (4 out of 5) - The service was good. I usually throw out the word \\"great\\"; however, it's not that Gus's wasn't, it's just that Gus's was good. The staff definitely immerse themselves in the hustle and bustle of the evening and sometimes greetings and pleasantries can fall by the wayside. NOBODY was rude by ANY means though. Everyone was a real pleasure to talk to and patient despite all of the busyness that was happening. One thing I DID notice about the service was their unique check-in/waitlist system. Most of the time, restaurants have a clipboard and track check-ins via a spreadsheet or a fancy computer-based system. Nope, not Gus's. Gus's uses a dry erase marker and a random kitchen tile on the wall! You may laugh, but the system is so simple and effective and they absolutely make it work. It's amazing! The fact that they're able to balance that system PLUS all the people that are in the building to place or pick up to-go orders is truly remarkable.\\n\\nThe Food (4.5 out of 5) - Now, onto the most important part of this review...the food. First and foremost, their menu is absolutely no frills. You walk into a chicken place, expect the only thing on the menu to be chicken. Sure, there are other things to consider like desserts and sides, but for the most part, it's basically what kind of chicken do you want (white or dark), how many pieces, and what part of the chicken. Boom. It's simple yet so effective and is absolutely satisfying to see. Now, everyone has their own preference for which part of the chicken to indulge themselves with; however, my preference for chicken are strips and the wings. That said, it was so satisfying for me to walk-in and be really straight forward with what I wanted. Sure, I looked at the menu and saw that they offered, but whatever your requests are for the kind of chicken you want, they're more than willing to accommodate. For my particular order, I got 3 piece tenders and a 3 piece white wing. Ok, here's the deal...we all enjoy our fried chicken many different ways, Gus's chicken is some of the moistest chicken I've ever had. The meat was perfectly cooked, stayed juicy, and was tender with every bite. The crisp and crunch you get from biting into the chicken not only gives you the texture balance, but it also gives you a bunch of flavors that just make the entire experience that much better; Gus's doesn't disappoint by any means. For my sides, I chose to go with the seasoned fries and mac & cheese. The fries weren't anything too special, but were seasoned great and cooked perfectly with that snap and crunch you would expect to get from a place that knows how to fry stuff. The mac & cheese was good and you could definitely tell it was home cooked. It was creamy, the macaroni wasn't over done, it was well-flavored, and the cheese provided that hearty richness you want in a mac & cheese. \\n\\nOverall (4 out of 5) -  Like I mentioned before, you can find Gus's all over the country and there's a reason for that. They truly know what they're doing when it comes to frying chicken, giving you bold and traditional flavors, and I can't WAIT to get to to the nearest one and indulge in it all over again."},{"name":"The COOP: A Southern Affair","address":"610 W Morse Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"The line was relatively short and not moving very fast on my visit.

I've lived in places where the Indian food was awesome and I was expecting the same, according to the glowing reviews for The Clay Pit. However, I've been super disappointed by every experience I've had at this place. \\nI consider myself to have a pretty good palate, as far as food goes, and I think the food at Clay Pit is so-so, nothing at all special. The best thing I've tried there has probably been the Curry Crab Cake, but last time I was there, it came out lukewarm. The first time I went to The Clay Pit, the samosas, pakoras and batata cham were only so-so (also lukewarm) and not very flavorful. I also tried the veggie Murch Masala, which was better than the apps, but nothing spectacular. I have heard lots of good things about the mussels, but I have yet to try it. \\nFrankly, I might not ever go back to The Clay Pi, after my last experiencet. I can overlook so-so food sometimes, but the service was my biggest complaint about the restaurant. I've worked in the service industry for many years, so I can appreciate and acknowledge good service. However, the last time I went to The Clay Pit, I had the worst service I have ever had in Austin. I was so angry when I left, I was steaming. Anyway, I went to the restaurant that night to celebrate my friends 30th birthday. It was just the two of us and I was taking her out for her birthday dinner. We sat in the bar because we were wanting an easy,  low-key kind of night. There was only one other table seated in the bar area, so the low-key wish seemed doable. After we sat down, our server approached our table and he was rude from the get-go. His first words were \\"what do you want to drink\\", not \\"hi\\" or \\"welcome\\". This took me aback because it wasn't the type of greeting I'm accustomed to in a nice, somewhat pricey restaurant. However, I initially dismissed it, hoping that things would get better, as the meal progressed. Every time the server came back, he was as rude, or ruder, than our first encounter with him. He never offered to refill waters with our spicy food, so we had to ask for it. We had to ask not once, but twice, before we got water refills. When our cocktails were empty he didn't ask if we wanted another. He was super inattentive the whole meal and tried his best to hurry us out of there. He didn't clear our plates when we were done, he just asked if we wanted the check. I did want another cocktail and dessert, but since he seemed to want us out of there so bad, I just ordered another drink and no dessert. By that time, I didn't even want the second drink, I think I just ordered it out of spite, since he was being suck a di*k. He never offered dessert or asked if we wanted another drink. We were super nice from the start of the meal (being former servers ourselves), so I was pretty shocked about how rude and awful he was to us. It was as if were an ex who cheated on him or something. I wanted to stiff the jerk, but since I was a server, I begrudgingly left him 20% (of which he did not deserve). Had he been nice and attentive I would have left my standard tip, which is usually much more than 20%. \\nAnyway, I probably wouldn't have such a bad taste in my mouth about this place, had it not been for my awful last experience at the restaurant.

What makes Press Club worth your time is the prospect of scanning/reading all sorts of underground specialist magazines that are just sitting on a shelf for your amusement.  The first magazine I attacked involved some how to build technological thingys.  My second involved counter culture art, and then the third and final magazine was filled with housewife style low calorie recipes.  The glossy low fat photos made me crave something different, exotic and maybe even foreign.  Coincidentally, The Press Club serves a wide selection of crepes.  I'm sold.  All of the food items have names of authors and cartoonists, etc...it sticks with the overall literary theme, and is kinda fun to see how many names you actually recognize.  I settled on a sweet crepe that had some fruit, brie and sugar.  Delicious.  The presentation was quite amazing, with every part of the experience oozing fanciness.  I may not be a crepe expert, but I always thought the filling was supposed to be inside the crepe, like stuffed or maybe even filled.  The crepe I ordered had all the filling on the outside, not that I am complaining...just surprised.  I mean, it still tasted amazing, and I couldn't stop eating.\\nThe press club is one of these fusion cafe/restaurant places where I am never sure if I should be dining with friends amidst pleasant conversation or studying a textbook with a simple cup of coffee.  When my friend and I arrived it felt more like a restaurant with couples dining and having conversations about this and that.  By the time we left the vibe had totally shifted to about 10 people all alone working on laptops or studying textbooks.  Kinda weird.\\nThe last note is the prices...maybe I just don't understand typical crepe pricing, but for the amount of food for the price I always leave feeling like I paid too much money for the amount of food.

You know how people say, this reminds me of my grandma's cooking? Grandma's cooking always soothes the soul. Well, grandma could never make all of these fine foods, at least not in one sitting. Maybe, over the course of a week, grandma could whip up all of these menu items. The enormous variety of southern specialties will satisfy the most discerning palates. That's if you are into southern food. If not, then this is not the place for you. But, bring it on for those of us who love all types of food.\\n\\nThat all identifiable barn red exterior color suggests exactly what to expect. Purposeful aged writings and finishes makes the place feel like it has been there forever. Well this space has been there forever, but this concept is fairly new. The new made to look like old, alludes to the menu direction. Older techniques and recipes handed down from generations makes it to the counter serving line. As in The Coop's older sister 4 Rivers Smokehouse, this is counter service. You walk in this side door, if the line does not wrap around the side street and around the building, to one side of the main dining room. Closer to the counter is a large selection of cold bottled beverages, grab one. Go to the first person in the assembly line and place your order. That person passes a tray to the next person who starts assembling your food. Then passes to the next person who then passes it to the cashier. Simple enough. The hardest part is figuring out what not to order. Everything looks amazing and mouthwatering. The attendants will offer you samples to taste and help you decide. You then proceed, food tray in hand, to the beverage station for fountain drinks or Iced Teas. Grab a cup of Cheerwine soda and be prepared to get hooked. This stuff is liquid crack. Then seat yourself on one of the many mismatched tables and chairs.\\n\\nEvery table and chair in this restaurant is mismatched. Have you ever gone to a place that has evolved over time? The seating is made to appear as another set of tables and chairs was added after a period of time and then another and yet again another. Isn't that how aging happens? We build and evolve. Here again, new embraces old. The result is a warm inviting space that really wraps like only a grandma can. However, don't expect a table by yourself. Most of these dining tables seat more than 4, some are 6 and 8. Be prepared to sit next to someone you don't know. What better way to make new friends than break bread? The concept is genius.\\n\\nThe sun room adjacent to the main dining room resembles what would be found in a majestic southern home. Here, the large glass pane wrap around windows bring the wonderful outdoors in. Bead board ceiling throughout the entire interior rounds out the southern decor. There are several picnic style benches on the outdoor patio. Cobblestone floors and overhead string lights adds to the mystique of being in the great southern outdoors. I can only imagine what this will look like at night. Enough gawking about decor, check out my blog for full food reviews.\\n\\nThis is a good start. I'll work my way down the menu and savor all the goodies in the restaurant. It could take a while, but like my affair with 4 Rivers Smokehouse BBQ, I could easily make it through this menu. The Coop has touched on all senses that make a diner want to return. For a place that is counter service, they have dining room attendants who are cordial and gracious. Many establishments offer plastic \\"To go\\" containers, The Coop offers paper. Why don't I care for plastic? I can't pull it out of the refrigerator and stick it in the microwave. With paper, I can. Thank you, Coop!"},{"name":"Dancing Goats Coffee Bar","address":"419 W Ponce De Leon Ave","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"Dancing Goats in Decatur sounds more bobo than it is.

After failed attempts to find parking at both Chuy's and El Alma, we just said \\"screw it\\" and decided to go to Terry Black's, if only because A) we were all getting hungry, B) it was 98¬∞F, C) we wanted to go see the Congress Ave. bats at sundown, and most importantly, D) they had ample parking.\\n\\nThis turned out to be a very happy accident, because Terry Black's absolutely came through in delivering a memorable BBQ experience. Perfectly moist and flavorful brisket, smokey ribs and honest-to-$DIETY sausages that look and taste like a human being stuffed freshly ground meat into a casing, rather than the kind of dense, processed sausage you'd normally get in a grocery store (or disappointingly, at The Salt Lick).\\n\\nI am of the belief that good BBQ should be delicious on its own, without the addition of BBQ sauce. In the case of Terry Black's, if they happened to have a yummy in-house BBQ sauce to slather over their meat, I wouldn't be able to give any opinion on it, because NONE of the meats on my plate needed it. The texture and flavor of everything was so good, that it never even occurred to me to reach for the BBQ sauce!\\n\\nThe sides were also good, and didn't come off as obligatory afterthoughts. Even though you'd have to work hard to in order make a Mac & Cheese that sucked, I ended up eating so much of Terry Black's Mac & Cheese that I didn't have enough room to finish all of the BBQ itself! And the fantastic flavor of Terry Black's beans are so far removed from the inexplicably useless beans at The Salt Lick, that it makes you wonder why they even bother serving it in the first place. \\n\\nAs I've mentioned in my other Austin BBQ reviews, while I know that there are a lot of \\"better\\", more obscure BBQ joints in Austin, I still can't really find any fault with Terry Black's. Coming from a state where the only way to get good BBQ is to make it yourself (which is doubly impossible for me, living in a high-rise condo), I think you would have to be an insufferable hipster BBQ snob to say that my experience at Terry Black's was not really as great as I thought it was."},{"name":"Bijou Cafe","address":"132 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Stopped in at Bijou Cafe for Saturday brunch around 10am, and we only waited about 2 minutes for our table.

One of the chefs was a realtor I knew who went to one of the culinary schools in Austin.  A good friend of ours was going to have major surgery and we planned to have a great dinner before it (he will be on a restricted diet).  We asked our friend to select dishes for 8 of us, pair them with wine and a good dessert.  It was fabulous.  I've had bolognese before, and their dish was excellent, but the stand outs was bucatini putanesca which is a pasta with tomato sauce, olives, capers, anchovy and garlic.  Wonderful!  My husband is not fond of olives, but he loved this dish.  The gemelli alla crema, a pasta dish with chicken, spinach, walnuts, parmigiano and cream, was my favorite.  The cheese dish before and the chocolate flourless cake were a good beginning and end to a wonderful itme..  I realize that the attention we were given may have been because of our relationship with one of the chefs and because we told them the purpose.  However, I saw the other patrons treated just as well.  My suggestion to those going to restaurants with a large group is to try and call them earlier; tell them how many and ask that they accomodate you.  Keep in mind this special attention deserves a good tip to the wait staff.  Oh, the wine was perfect.

Not quite what I'm used to, but they were tasty and no MSG. Each bowl is a pretty decent size portion and all the meat was also soft, juicy, and flavorful. You get a choice of different noodles: flat, thin, or vermicelli. The flat noodles are big thick handmade noodle that are chewy. The thin ones are basically smaller version of the the flat noodles. We didn't try the vermicelli.\\n\\nN1 Champion Beef Shank with Noodle in Soup - The closest champion soup to traditional beef noodle soup. Solid beefy goodness.\\n\\nN2 Champion Beef Brisket with Noodle in Clear Soup - Uses a light clear soup, hard to tell but perhaps chicken stock based? Wasn't bad, but I'd prefer something heaver to pair with the strong flavor of the beef.\\n\\nN3 Champion Braised Beef with Noodle in Tomato Soup - Has a light tomato broth. Unfortunately I'm not a huge fan of tomato soup.\\n\\nN4 Award-Winning Beef Shank, Tendon & Tripe with noodle in soup - Same soup base as N1, but with different meats.\\n\\nN6 Braised Beef Tendon & Beef Shank with Noodle in Soup - This one actually has a beef soup base similar to N1 and N4 but with a stronger thicker flavor.

It was okay, a little bit dry on the surface since it is claimed to be oven cooked. It's not bad but it was okay. We had the lamb biryani rice. The food was good at the first bite, the lamb was in good portion and size. It was good but then after a couple of bites, I realized the food was not even sizzling hot in the first place and the plate was not slightly hot as well. Then I thought to myself this must be just a microwave food or something. I looked closely to the lamb and the surface is dry and seemed like it is been reheated. I was just not impressed when I looked closely. So we decided not to get any dessert after what I have just seen. \\n\\nAtmosphere\\nThe place is medium size could use a bit of lighting but other than that is good. \\n\\nService\\nService was very friendly.\\n\\nOverall Experience\\nI don't think I would come back again, given that I know there is a better Indian restaurant out there in Boston.

Those are amateur pizza-making mistakes.  I can make better pizza in an Easy Bake Oven.  I've had worse, but I've also had a whole lot better.  Neapoli's in Malden, for example, makes a much better, bigger pizza for about the same price without pretending to be a fancy sit-down restaurant (but you can sit down if you want to).  \\n\\nBy the way, I hope you don't get thirsty because there are no free refills on sodas.\\n\\nBut perhaps I'm being a bit harsh.

Don't be surprised if you wait longer here than at smaller places even though there are a lot of empty seats.\\n\\nThe sushi is just ok. It's not the freshest but it's not the most expensive either. My sashimi still had part of the skin left over. Either their skill in cleaning isn't as great, they are a little more lazy in getting that last bit off, or they are stingy and don't want to lose more meat by cutting off that part. To me it shows less care in your work as presentation is part of the craftsmanship for sushi chefs.\\n\\nFor about the same price though you can get a lot more at Toshi. I would say I think the regular ramen taste a little better here than Toshi, but I would still prefer the one at Toshi as it has a more authentic taste to me. They use spinach, carrots, and broccoli here in their ramen. Not that you can't have those ingredients, but the carrots make the broth taste sweeter which is not a taste I'm looking for in ramen broth personally. I would say less care was taken in keeping the broth clear. It gots globs of oil and it doesn't seem like it was intentional.

There are several good Ethiopian restaurants in Atlanta (Desta, Bahel, Queen of Sheba, Enat, Meskerem).  However, Ghion Cultural Hall is the best...by far.  It took one visit and I was hooked. From the moment I walked in I was greeted warmly by the owner and was given a tour of the restaurant.  Although the formal dining area is nice, I prefer sitting at the bar and watching the very friendly Ethiopian women perform their magic.  As far as the food is concerned you can't go wrong.  I have been working my way through the menu the last few weeks and I have yet to be disappointed.  The food is always fresh and flavorful and also very fast which is amazing considering its quality.  The portions are generous and the prices are very reasonable. It would be quite difficult to nail down a favorite dish because everything they serve is so delicious.  But what I will do is highly recommend the Ghion Cultural Special which contains a combination of vegetables, tibs, kitfo and doro wot. This platter will give you the opportunity to experience the wide range of flavors of authentic Ethiopian food. Additionally the honey wine and Ethiopian coffee are excellent too.

The alcoholic beverages are over priced but they are at least offered, service is hit or miss either amazing or bland depending on the employees on shift.

I mean, KFC is already super great and when you fry a chicken, they all taste and feel the same.  Right?\\"  - Me being naive and ignorant ever since hearing of Gus's.\\n\\nI came to Gus's with skepticism, and sometimes that's a good approach when trying new things.  I'll cut to the chase: Gus's Fried Chicken is better than any fried chicken I've had, from the standard fast food fried chicken at KFC to the relatively gourmet fried chicken from Salty Sow.  One of the reasons is the taste: the chicken (not just the batter) is seasoned well with a spicy kick.  But what makes their fried chicken elite is the tenderness.  Not only do they cook to order instead of letting the chicken sit under a heat lamp, they got the timing and technique down pat.  Once you bite into the chicken, the meat snaps and then instantly begin to break down in your mouth.  The sudden feeling of chicken juice dripping down the corners of your mouth will be normal.\\n\\nDid their fried chicken make me cry?  Did it change my religion?  Nope, but if someone claims that simple, fast-food fried chicken is as good as it gets, I'll be taking them here.

I should preface this with the fact that I haven't been to the famous Franklin's in Austin, which is supposedly the best barbecue place ever. However, I HAVE been to many other amazing barbecue places all over Texas including Cooper's, Heim, Woodshed, Railhead, Lockhart, Mike Anderson's and Pecan Lodge. Of these impressive options, Terry Black's is the best in my opinion.\\n\\nLocated in the south side off downtown Austin, Terry Black's is a cool cabin-like building with a great patio and cafeteria-line style set-up. It just looks and feels like an authentic barbecue place. There is typically little parking and a long line that goes outside the door because of how popular this place is. You won't mind the wait because there is some merchandise near the front so you can check them out as you wait. But also, the line moves pretty quick because everything is cooked and you just go down the line with your tray and grab what you want until you get to the meat at the end where someone will cut the portion you want.\\n\\nMy favorite sides would be the creamed corn and coleslaw. The creamed corn is damn near perfect as it is not overly sweet. The coleslaw is creamy and made with fancier red cabbage. \\n\\nThe star of the show would be the moist brisket and the beef ribs. The moist brisket is seasoned and cooked perfectly, blending a perfect salty outer shell with a juicy and tender meat. The texture and flavor are both impeccable. The same can be said of the beef rib. I'm talking giant T-Rex sized ribs where the meat just falls off the bone. \\n\\nThey also have 3 different barbecue sauces, all of which are different from each other. One is a sweeter tangier sauce, one is a standard original sauce and one is spicier. I love them all, so what I like to do is make 3 puddles and eventually mix them all together. The flavors compliment well. \\n\\nI don't live in Austin anymore but I would definitely go out of my way to eat here every time I visit Austin. It's a shame we don't have something comparable in DFW. Pecan Lodge is supposed to be the best in DFW and it just doesn't even come close to Terry Black's."},{"name":"Santarpio's Pizza","address":"111 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Been going here for over 30 years.

So, if you don't want to stand outside, find a way to go on a weekday- which is what I did.  The system is very organized.  While standing in line to place your order, a server asks you for your party size and assigns you a table number.  This saves the trouble of trying to find a seat after ordering, or trying to save seats while the rest of your party is ordering.\\n\\nMy order:\\nAhi Tuna burger: Tuna was fresh and nicely cooked. The wasabi mayo was a little strong in some areas (got caught in the craters of nori chips). Other than that, the burger kept a full Asian theme with the soy sauce glaze, nori chips, wasabi, and pickled ginger incorporated in it. There are some great Ahi Tuna burger places in Houston, like District 7 grill, but this was the first time I had one without traditional American toppings.\\n\\nSea Salt & Caramel Milkshake: THIS IS THE REASON I WANT TO COME BACK HERE! this shake was so yummy!

I feel for fried chicken to get the praise it needs the breading has to be the make or break point and this is what the coop is lacking on, the chicken pieces where good size but the breading for me was very bland. My brother had the shrimp and grits and said it was fabulous. I was not overly impressed with the green beans with the potatoes in with them and the rice and gravy tasted packaged.

There's a great selection of beers and a decent wine and cocktail list. We ordered our drinks and food simultaneously, and they came out essentially at the same time (it took about 15 minutes). Our table ordered the SoCal Chicken Sandwich, White Clam Pizza, Cold Lobster Roll, and Fried Clam Sandwich. \\n\\nI ordered the chicken sandwich, and I don't want to brag, but I think I made the best choice of the table. It was beautifully plated and delicious. It was served with fries and coleslaw - big fan of the fries, but the coleslaw was on the salty side. It was made with pickles and tasted like vinegar. It could have used some sweetness.\\n\\nThe White Clam Pizza was enough for one, but could be shared for a lighter bite. It was tasty, but too garlicky for my liking. My mom's fried clam sandwich was heaping - too much for her to eat, and it was market price ( it came to $23!!) A little outrageous for what it was. My other travel companion ordered the cold lobster roll when our server told us the buttered, warm lobster roll was sold out.

It had the perfect amount of cinnamon sugar too, and the top was very nicely crisped and cracked. The lemon cupcake was probably the best lemon anything-cake I've ever had. It was layered with a big dollop of frosting. I'm not so into frosting, so I got a little scared, but this frosting was delectable. It wasn't too sweet, and it didn't have any giant sugar granules.

Yeah it was only 7 miles but if there was traffic on 93, it'll probably take you at least an hour to get here on dinner rush but who the hell cares!. Its right by the airport so anyone visiting us always has to stop by this place for the best pizza in Boston.\\n\\nThe pizza is no fancy Upper Crust. This is a hole in the wall, as rough as you can get in Boston type service pizza place. Our usual order is roni, sausage, garlic pizza. They only have one size pizza. There is no medium, or large or small. The prices starts at 11 bucks I think then it goes up per added topping. The most awesome thing about their pizza is the crust and sauce. You got to see their oven in the back where you order to go. The pizza oven is old. So old that I am quite positive no one makes that kind of oven anymore. That oven does the job to make the crust really awesome. Toppings? Dont call them to ask for toppings like pineapple or ask them what type of olives. They have no pineapple and only have one kind of olives and they wouldn't even know what kind it is. It is just some regular olives! Don't ask them for different cheeses or fancy toppings or such, they will just make fun of you! Better yet, get a menu, and pick from what is available and only what is available. They make the sausage toppings here on site. It is very tasty. There is one thing I have heard complaints about and it is the saltiness of the pepperoni. I guess it could be salty for people who are not into salty pepperoni but to me it actually balances the cheesy kind of blandish mozzarella. You just got to try it.\\n\\nBesides from the pizza, here comes the grilled lamb and sausage and the newly added grilled beef tips. The grilled meats are served with a side of bread and with some pickled tomato peppers. It's so good that I actually now have preferred the grilled lamb than the pizza itself. I can't go there anymore without ordering the lamb. It is grilled on charcoal. The grill is on the right side of the bar as you walk in. Usually the guy at the grill, his name is Lefty. He grills the meat really awesome.\\n\\nNo matter what people say about this place, how rough the servers are, or how far it is and how scary the neighborhood it is in. We've been going to this place for almost 5 years now. Always got good pizza and good meats! The servers are fun as long as you don't bug them with so many requests.

The decor was very dark, warm, and shiny.  Those chaffing dishes on the bar in the dining room were almost blinding they were so shined!  The crab scrod dinner was outstanding.  My friend had the Lobster Bisque and said it was heavenly.  The bar area seemed hopping and I would like to come back and check that out sometime.

And we all know that when food is free, we are a little less critical and little more inclined to think it tastes amazing.\\n\\nBut with that said, I really liked Red Robin! I was expecting a boring burger chain, but was actually surprised by the expansive and creative menu. Let's start with the appetizers: they have the usual deep fried goodies and some hot wings, but they also offer a veggie and hummus plate that rivals some I've had at authentic Greek restaurants. The hummus was flavorful, creamy and made with real olive oil. It came with fresh cucumber, carrots, jicama, grilled zucchini and a garlic flat bread that was to.die.for. I recommend forgoing the chili cheese fries and giving this a try.\\n\\nNext to the burgers: so many options. And not just beef, but also turkey, chicken, vegan and veggie patties. You can substitute any patty for any burger (I believe at no extra charge for veggie or vegan). That definitely sets this place a part from Chili's or TGI Fridays. And the burger varieties are great: spicy habanero, guacamole, fried eggs...many unique varieties. My fiance ordered the bacon blue cheese and enjoyed it. I tried the classic all-beef burger and it was very good as well. They use a house seasoning on their meat that offers great flavor. You can also choose your bun (sesame, kaiser onion, whole grain, etc). And wait, there's more! They come with bottomless, YES bottomless steak fries. Maybe not such a great thing for the health conscious, but whatevs. You can also sub a side (no extra charge for black beans, steamed broccoli or carrots). \\n\\nAnd finally, dessert. Perhaps my favorite part of the meal (I have a big sweet tooth). I ordered the Mint Brownie Milkshake. Oh man, this thing nearly killed me with kindness. Creamy mint ice cream mixed with brownie bits, topped with whipped cream and more brownie bits. Not only do you get the fancy milkshake glass, but they give you even MORE in the metal shaker they used to blend it. So basically, 2 milkshakes.

Right away, I thought this place was too hip, with its smooth edges, modern, signage-I figure a burger should be pretty easy to do, nothing ultra fancy. I ordered the burger tartare which was hand chopped filet mignon, a 6 min egg, garlic, chili, capers, pickled shallot, fris√©e, and smoked mayo. A lot of that was honestly way too fancy for me to pick up on but what I know is that the slightly cool, tastiness and the slick texture of the slightly cooked egg made for a really tasty combo and of course the garlic and capers were a nice mix of salty/spicy as well. \\n\\nThe fries though were really good-with the housemade ketchup-did I mention how I really like the phrase 'housemade' and not homemade because restaurants aren't homes but made 'in house' is a valid phrase. Okay, enough ADD time-I do enjoy a good ketchup and this one wasn't just annoyingly sweet but had a nice tart tomato with a slight, almost undetectable spice to it. There was one or two fries left and our server was about to take them away when I told her quickly to leave it there and then I quickly said sorry for snapping at her.

I've had cheap apple pie where it feels like your mouth is covered in plastic afterward and this was NOT the case with this milk shake. A perfect apple pie but in milkshake form. I liked it so much that I got another one the strawberry shortcake which was okay, it was much like a shortcake, so much so that the cake pieces were too big for the straw, everything else was really good and I still think about those burgers when I'm in Atlanta."},{"name":"Southland Whiskey Kitchen","address":"1422 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Shockingly bad food and terrible service.  My husband and I went for a late dinner on Thursday night.  It seemed slow at 8:30, and half the tables were empty.  Good design and decor, even with the bank of TVs blasting sports.  We were seated and given water by the hostess.  Our server finally came to greet us and took our orders since we had been waiting quite a while (15 minutes) and had decided.  I ordered the fried chicken and sides (slaw, mashers, and biscuit) and sweet tea, and my husband ordered the loaded baked potato.  The server said they were out of fried green tomatoes and brisket. We waited 30 minutes for our food. In the end, a different person brought our food. He was dressed like management, but was bussing tables.  The food had obviously been sitting under the heat lamps for a while because the cheese on the potato had congealed, the temps were inconsistent, and the slaw had leaked over everything.  I'm not sure who would ever put these flavors on a plate together --  honey butter, horseradish slaw, cayenne fried chicken, and strange canned gravy flavor mashed potatoes.  Our server never did come back.  We wanted more drinks and I ended up going up to the bar to get our drinks.  Our server intercepted me and I told her that we wanted more drinks.  She proceeded to check on three more tables and finally brought us our drinks (a sweet tea and a soda, so it wasn't complicated) after 10 minutes. We probably interacted with our server twice in more than an hour, had food delivered by an anonymous person, and ended up feeling pretty terrible after our dinner.  I don't think any amount of design can cover the fact that this food would have been subpar for even a chain like Famous Dave's, and the menu was strongly reminiscent of a Guy Fieri endeavor.  Appallingly disgusting and poorly prepared food, and bizarrely poor service."},{"name":"Gourdough's Public House","address":"2700 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Who would have thought that you could wrap a burger into a doughnut (as a bun)?!?!

A lotta people eating chicken with Charmander & chickens in downtown Austin. Hmm.. time to investigate the global chicken bust. Part 2....\\n\\nIf your looking for a place in the downtown area of Austin and like southern food, this is the place. Yea, the parking may be difficult to bind with. But if you decide to come on Sunday's the parking for digital ticketed meter is free. And don't fret on the distance.. because Gus will always make you feel welcomed. (I hope so).\\n\\nThe host/cashier pointed our seat out by the picture on the wall. It was pretty strange to me since I never had a host do that. He said, \\"underneath the cow\\", when actually he was referring the cow to a bull, steer.. uhh cattle, Yep that's a good name for it Cattle.. A Texas longhorn so to speak. \\n\\nMy brother and I sat underneath the \\"cow\\" in a booth/table with proximal neighbors on each side. Though, the right side neighbor was no more than 1 inch away from us. My brother sat in a booth and was in a chair. \\n\\nSeconds after being seated our server, Jack; took our order. He was our waiter and the table adjacent to us also. He was nice and cool. As our partnering table told him they come there every other day for a special. I thought man, Gus had to be delicious. \\n\\nWe all ordered, if you order a fountain drink you'll also get souvenir cup. I was the only one that didn't order an alcoholic beverage since I was leaving for Houston that day. I didn't want to be tipsy on the road. B-)\\n\\nIt took awhile for the food to arrive. When it did, the food tasted great. The fried chicken was so guuud, so juicy, flavorful, with slight yum of grease. It sorta taste like it was seasoned with Tony's, but I'm not telling the secret. \\n\\nYou would think the side orders to be standard. Nope, I was blown away when I ate the macaroni and cheese. Not many southern or restaurants in general know how to prepare mac n' cheese without using the box. Gus's mac n cheese was surprisingly creamy, cheesy, rich, and dreamy. It was so mouthwatering I just wanted more! The noodles weren't mushy or so soft it dissolves in your mouth. It was just right. \\n\\nI also had french fries and white bread. The fries tasted like they were freshly cut and fried. I really do think the base ingredient is Tony's. That too was great and bread was ok just regular white bread. \\n\\nJack was awesome on the refills. If it was Sprite for me, water for the beer drinkers, or more orders to be taken Jack was on it. Though, he kind of messed up my change back. Instead of giving me all of my money back, he gave me half.. minus the coins part. It was only 0.45 on 9 dollars. He gave me the 9, but not the 45. But I didn't worry, I just added that to his tip. He explained the cashier didn't have coins in the register and offered to go around searching for it. I told him it was fine to save the chaotic trip. \\n\\nOverall, amazing experience happy to learn they have other locations in AZ, TN, & MS.

Comfort Italian home cooking, unpretentious, and priced reasonably. I've been here 4 times having the 7 course alla famiglia, and each experience has been amazing. Some of the highlights were:\\n\\n- Vitello tonnato: Elegant and traditional antipasto. Excellent quality veal, and read this: They don't serve the dish pre-mixed with sauce so you can see the real meat, nothing needs to be hidden.\\n\\n- Rabbit and pork rillettes: You need to trust a restaurant to be able to eat such dish. Who knows what meat and animal fat they put in it. I don't usually eat rabbit but I make exceptions for this dish at La Quercia. What is so smart is that they serve it with very light pastry instead of traditional bread or toast.\\n\\n- Veal and swiss chard ravioli: I swear I can have this every day. It's so comforting. Skin is thin as how it should be, good filling, and garnished with veal broth and butter, you don't need anything else.\\n\\n- Fried pheasant: I only had this once and it was the best I've ever had. You don't want to overcook pheasant but it has to be well-cooked. The meat was tender and crispy on the outside.\\n\\n- Braised beef cheek: Amazing dish, well cooked and served with cauliflower puree and my favorite vegetable \\"rapini\\" and finally topped with salsa verde."},{"name":"Ava Roasteria","address":"15135 SW Barrows Rd, Ste 137","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"The coffee is good, but the terrible service keeps me from frequenting the establishment more often.

We generally skip the salad bar, pay, grab a seat, and head to the soup station and bread station.  There are about 8 soups including a standard chunky chicken noodle soup, my favorite.  There really are chunks of chicken and large noodles providing protein and carbs.  Other soups vary.  The breads, muffins, and focaccia  are baked in-house.  The pasta bar has everybody's favorite, macaroni and cheese, along with two other hot pastas.  The potato bar offers baked russet potatoes and sweet potatoes with sour cream, chives, shredded cheese, etc.  The desert bar offers apples, cottage cheese, tapioca, sugar free chocolate moose, etc.  The specialty this month is strawberry shortcake -- pound cake squares, ripe sliced strawberries and topping.

I really do-- the coffee is delicious, the vibe is excellent, and the people are friendly. That said, it's not worth the drive, really, because...there's no where to sit.\\n\\nDancing Goats has a HUGE space for a coffeeshop-- and they've filled it primarily with retail and poor seating options. For example: There are two or three chairs/couches in the front of the store. Unless you want to get really cozy with a stranger, these, at times, only host one or two people apiece. There are four high top half tables facing windows, that in theory, seat four people per-- but in reality, seat two people who don't know each other (and therefore don't really want to be knocking elbows every few moments). Plus, those half tables face, as I mentioned earlier, windows-- which means the afternoon sun comes blaring in them (there are shades, but those are no match for 4pm sunlight, plus are difficult to open and close anyhow).\\n\\nThere's a bar overlooking the baristas; the barstools aren't high enough for the spots to be used by those with laptops (you'd be typing up by your chest). In the back, there are two larger tables that, in theory, seat 8 people. In reality, they seat four people who don't know each other. There's one high top that seats around two people, and one tiny little table that seats two people who DON'T have laptops; with a laptop, it seats one person who doesn't spread out.\\n\\nSo, basically, while this is a lovely coffeeshop, it's nowhere that I'd come and order drink after drink and work on anything. On paper, they have loads of seating, but in reality, it's scant and crowded. I wouldn't blame them at all for this if their space didn't allow for so, so, so much more. They could fit at least six small \\"two-seater\\" tables to the store without it feeling jam-packed or overcrowded. They could fit even more if they got rid of the giant tables (that, for all the space they take up, realistically only seat around three or four people).\\n\\nIt all seems so obvious that I suspect maybe Dancing Goats doesn't WANT to be that sort of coffeeshop-- the kind where people flock to to work and write and hang out and order all the live long day-- and I guess that's their prerogative.

I walked in around 4:30-ish and it was empty (I didn't realize the place actually didn't open for another half hour until I got home to write this review), but I was served anyway! An extremely friendly woman greeted me at the door and welcomed me in, told me to sit anywhere and so I took a seat by what looked like a bar area. I told her that I just moved into town and I've never had Ethiopian before. With that information, the woman offered to take me to the back of the restaurant where the dining area was so that I could get an \\"authentic experience\\" being that it was my first time.\\n\\nI was escorted to the back of the building and entered a beautiful dining area (now I know why it was completely empty), bright with colors, wooden chairs and mural paintings all over each wall -- I felt like I was transported to a completely different place!

Once she saw that I understood (she stood by to watch me take the first bite to make sure I got it right), she let me enjoy my meal and gave me just the right amount of privacy I like. She followed up a few times to see if I needed anything else and provided the check when I was wrapping up (I ate literally everything) -- speaking of which, the food tasted amazing! Again, being a first timer, I don't really have anything to compare it to or have any base knowledge, but I can say that it was well cooked, it was presented beautifully and the sauce, which had a very heavy taste of cayenne pepper (which I have no problems with) complimented the dish very well.\\n\\nOverall, I will definitely be bringing friends and family back and since I'm a HUGE advocate for excellent service, I would definitely recommend this place for anyone who's looking for a cultural experience with a warm and friendly atmosphere!\\n\\nFive stars for sure! :)"},{"name":"Dunkin'","address":"1605 S Orlando Ave","city":"Maitland","stars":"3","text":"This is where  I stop on my way to work when I want to surprise my co-workers with a mid-morning pick me up.

It is just good sense in the business world, or more like, in the world of doing business.  And I didn't come out here with one of those voucher with all those restrictions on time and minimum expenditure and required number of people in the party and what-not.  I came for Summer Dine Out Boston.\\n\\nImagine my surprise when my server mentioned that I could choose two out of the three courses.  How did I miss this when perusing the Restaurant Week menus online?  Fortunately, they had wi-fi (the restaurant is located in the Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel after all), and once I showed her the menu as listed on the BostonUSA website, she checked in with the manager and confirmed my three course work day RW lunch for $20.\\n\\nOne benefit of dining at a restaurant housed in a hotel in the Seaport - I was not the sole solitary diner.  In fact, we outnumbered the larger parties of two (which were but two), by two-fold.\\n\\nThe first course ended up being my favorite despite, or perhaps because of, its utter simplicity.\\n\\n.  Spit Roasted Beet Salad\\nWatercress, Whipped Ricotta, Honey Vinaigrette, Hazelnuts\\n\\nI didn't particularly notice the honey vinaigrette nor the hazelnuts, but the freshness of the roasted beets made the dish.  The pink beets were my favorite.\\n\\nI came expecting to order the Marinated Shrimp Pizza (Mozzarella, Zucchini, Upland Cress, Lemon) as my entree, however, I allowed myself to be swayed by my server as she described the pizza as slightly spicy and the bolognese as delicious, huge, and the pasta as homemade.  Yes, that final tidbit did the majority of the convincing in my case.\\n\\nThe pasta was nearly half meat and half pasta.  Though good, the flavor didn't exactly excite my taste buds.  I can't help but wonder what the pizza would have been like... or perhaps even the veal burger.\\n\\nGiven the generous portions of the first two courses - perhaps because they were initially sized for a two course meal - I was taken a back somewhat by the petite nature of the Sweet Corn Panna Cotta (Caramel Corn, Grated Pistachio).  Although I did wonder, perchance they made me a special mini version as an off menu third course?  I certainly hope so, since last impressions are what diners tend to be left with.\\n\\nThe primary note of sweetness of the dessert was surprisingly from the caramel coated popcorn.  If it weren't for the name, I would have considered this a custard rather than a panna cotta.  The custard itself was nice, but tame.  If there was pistachio in this dessert, it was completely lost on me.\\n\\nDespite being housed in a hotel, M.C. Spiedo rated its own bathrooms, which were located past the bar, where I noticed a blackboard emblazoned \\"Suckling Pig Saturdays.\\"  Yes, that caught my eye.\\n\\nThey roast a whole suckling pig in house and serve it during dinner time on Saturday till it is gone.  $26 along with an accompanying side.

My chicken coconut korma was flavorful and full of real white meat chicken, the boy's goat vindaloo was rightly very spicy and tasty, the basmati rice was plentiful, the peswari naan delicious, and the samosas nicely spiced. Aside from the quality, I was really happy with both the prices and the quantity of food too... my $12.95 korma yielded me two meals, and Punjab only charges $1 for delivery with $15 minimum food order.

This review covers two seperate visits.\\n\\nOn the first visit and being from Texas, I had the sliced brisket and fries.  The brisket was very good, but it wasn't pull apart tender.  The barbeque sauces added some nice flavor to the meat and the seasoning that they add to the fries really make them pop.\\n\\nOn my second visit, I had burnt ends and a 3-piece side of fried pork belly.  The first time I tried burnt ends was 10-years ago in Kansas City and they were heavenly from what I recall.  At Hottie Hawg's the burnt ends were fatty and chewy.  Since I don't have a more frequently tasted comparison, it's hard to rate them relative to another BBQ establishment.  So, I will leave it with my fatty and chewy impression.\\n\\nThe fried pork belly is just a fancy term for BACON.  Since I have started making my own bacon at home, I just had to try theirs.  Now, I am not an expert BBQ pitmaster or BBQ competition participant, but I'd take my bacon hands down over theirs and one of my colleagues concluded the same.  While their fried pork belly is good, it lacked a lot of flavor that really pops in your mouth.  Their recipe could stand to use some sugar and molasses/syrup as part of their curing process, before smoking, slicing, and frying.

It's beautiful interior is simple and classic, with an embracing communal table as the primary sitting area, alongside smaller tables in the large front south facing window.

The guys tending bar are good and can make pretty much anything and will hold your card so you can run a tab, but it seems nobody will come to your table anymore to take a drink and food order.\\n\\nThe dance floor is some kind of linoleum tile, which doesn't work very well.  Its positioned between the bar and dart boards and pool tables, people are constantly crossing the dance floor with drinks in hand.\\n\\nThe current DJ (as of this writing) knows his craft, and spins a wicked mix of beat matched tunes with seamless cross fades and effects.  BUT...its nearly all gangsta rap, and what isn't gangsta rap isn't far from it.  And it also isn't the version you may have heard on the radio.  The combination seems out of place in a suburban strip mall, and its TOO LOUD in a place where almost nobody is dancing.\\n\\nThere is an interesting cast of regulars, including one gentleman that can often be seen dancing by himself.   If you ladies like to jump out on the floor alone or in a group, I can guarantee you he will move into your group and start dancing with and around you.  Don't worry, he is a nice guy and keeps his hands to himself, so enjoy it and consider it part of the atmosphere.\\n\\nIf you are looking for pool or darts, or a drink after work without having to dress up first then you might give this another star.\\n\\nTen years ago Dr. Feelgoods used to be a solid 3-4 star hangout, but since around 2010 this place has been sliding slowly downhill.

Slightly savory because of the basil but it works), maple bacon (still not a fan of bacon in my sweets, but otherwise good), passionfruit w/ cocoa nibs (again, flavors are real and bold.

That sort of service, is, unfortunately, not out of character for TPB. That being said, there are a select few who do a great job.\\n\\nAlso, their happy hour prices change on a weekly basis. Not a huge deal, but I hate being in for a shock when I get my tab. Keep it consistent, guys!\\n\\nAnyway, final advice: if you're coming here for drinks because it's close by, it's not a bad choice. If you're coming here for food....you may want to look for something on the Drag instead (or Plucker's, right next door!)."},{"name":"Schmidt's Sausage Haus","address":"240 E Kossuth St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Love this place.

We didn't order this, but it was substituted when they ran out of another dish.

Very good, but the flavor doesn't focus on the cavier itself.  \\n\\nBraised Greens - Nice hearty and smokey flavor.  Excellent!\\n\\nHalibut - Easily the best item we ordered.  They have the halibut down, so fresh and perfectly seasoned, not overly-so that it overpowers the flavor of the fish.\\n\\nLamb - Probably the least favorite at the table.  I was only one who could stomach how extremely rare it was served.  It wasn't like it was bloody, but it was almost completely raw.  My biggest challenge was how chewy it was.\\n\\nGratin - Not the potato version, but made of cabbage.

Eventually, they gave us a bowl of complimentary steamed rice on the side as an alternative to corn tortilla if necessary and my wife ended up needing it.

I feel toning down the pepper and adding some more spices would have done the trick. In all I was pleased. I picked apart my first piece and was ready for the second, until I saw a huge problem. There was a metal shaving in the chicken. It just so happened as I saw, it a worker cleaning tables saw my face and asked if there was a problem. I showed him the metal shaving and he immediately grabbed a manager. They handled it nicely, gave me a refund and offered me another piece of chicken or anything else. I thought hmm... maybe its a good time to try a chicken tender. So I asked if I can try 1 tender and she brought back 2. The tender had the same amount of breading as the fried chicken. I generally feel tenders should be coated with more breading than fried chicken as tenders are typically breast meat and can be a little less tender and drier than dark meat. I like a little crunch with my tenders. Just a personal preference. \\n\\nFor the sides I went with the mac and cheese and bread pudding.

Once we got closer to the register to order they were having free samples of the truffle fries! We ordered a bunch of truffle fries(the samples sold us), magic shroom, el diablo, ahi tuna burger, the ghostland burgatory (you have to sign a waiver to eat this!), and I ordered the classic cheeseburger with a nutella choco pretzel shake(to cool down).  \\nTruffle fries: delicious and addicting! definitely a must order. its perfectly cooked and topped with garlic and herbs and a creamy sauce on the side!\\nMagic shroom: (mushroom/goat cheese/basil pesto sauce)i wanted to order this but was scared of the harshness of the goat cheese. I did take a bite out of my friends and the goat cheese was very mild and creamy! I would order this for myself next time!\\nAhi tuna: (sushi grade tuna/sprouts/teriyaki/wasabi) I took a bite of this as well. The tuna is seared on both side leaving the middle rare. Its a nice thick cut where you can definitely taste the sushi grade tuna! definitely a good alternative to angus beef patty.\\nCheese burger: Just a very good solid burger. The patty isn't too thin or thick and is perfectly cooked. Juicy and savory. The sassy sauce it comes with is great.\\nGHOSTLAND BURGATORY: (ghost pepper sauce, ghost peppers, onions, habaneros, serranos, ghost pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayo) A friend ordered this and said i have never sweat so much from eating a burger. he said it was very delicious with some serious heat. However it is not too spicy where you can't enjoy your food. It is also not the same spiciness as it is eating 911 wings where you constantly want something to drink if you stop eating. \\nNutella choc pretzel shake: (nutella/pretzel) this was very disappointing since SO many raved about it. you can barely taste the nutella and there is very few bits of pretzel for that crunch. It was very liquidy not thick like a shake should be.

On ocassion, after a night of partying, I like to satisfy my inner fat kid. My lady friend and I decided chinese buffet would hit the spot. Ive eaten there a few times and I know what Im getting into when I go. After I grabbed my second plate I picked at the curry and the broccoli/beef I had on my plate. Thats when I found it. Immediately I thought, that looks like a cigerette butt, but quickly brushed it off thinking, no kitchen is really THAT dirty; thats only in movies right? I picked it up, inspected it, and it 100% without a doubt was a cigerette butt. Im not a complainer really with food. I work service industry as well and understand bugs get into food sometimes. Ive still eaten plates without notifying my server at all. Im genuily not bothered much by it. But this is a f&@$ing cigarette butt.\\n\\nOk. I found it. Believe it or not, it gets better (worse)...\\n\\nI ask for a manager and an employee brings me this older asian lady. I think her nametag said Yon. I show her what I found, and she picks it up, says 'oh what is that?' as she's peeling it apart, exposing the filter inside. Its a cigerette butt, duh. I tell her where I found it, and she nonchalantly says, 'oh Im so sorry,' pats me on the back and walks away. Shocked at such an uninterested response, I say 'but Im not done with you...' I wasnt trying to be mean, but I guess my brain decided that needed to be said. Anyway, I find our server, tip her and say thanks. It wasnt her fault. She actually was great. She kept the sodas and waters flowing and made us laugh. She could probably tell we were hungover. I think her name was Ann? Anna? Very sweet. Manager finally comes back and says 'Im so sorry. I only charge you for one.' To which my brain, again spoke out of instinct, said 'No we're not paying for this at all. Thats disgusting!' as we got up and left. Im still in shock about how the manager handled the situation. I felt I was being overly polite by not making a scene whatsoever. At my job people would be fired on the spot for something so... gross? unprofessional? unsanitary? rude? and every other synonym you can find in the thesaurus for those words.\\n\\nThis whole time Ive been completely dumbfounded as to how it even got inside the food. It was crushed as if it was stepped on. How did it get from being stepped on on the floor, hopefully from outside the building, to inside the food? Do they smoke in the kitchen? But then how did it even get off the ground and into the food? Do they let their kitchen supplies sit on the ground while theyre cooking? Inside and outside?

Service. We arrived early afternoon to make sure we could find parking and dine during non-rush time. We were promptly seated and then...we waited. Waited a little more. Nobody looked our direction. Staff outnumbered guests, but still we waited. Our server finally arrived and realized we had been neglected. He acknowledged that fact and was highly apologetic. Service was friendly, mechanical, but friendly. \\n\\nSecond negative. Fried Green Tomatoes. I won't bash the sides. The mac and cheese was standard and not really noteworthy. No greens available. Slaw was mayo based and sweet, nothing extraordinary. BUT...I ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes based on previous reviews. I was excited. I love FGT. They arrived and the second I saw them, one thing came to mind. They need to change out the oil. Burnt edges. Cutting them open, the tomato was mushy and disintegrated. The outer batter was dark brown, but the inner batter was gummy and under cooked. I was disappointed. \\n\\nThat all aside, I was here for the chicken. I ordered the two piece dark with an additional tender. Do yourself a solid...and get the tender(s). Lightly coated with tons of great flavor. Balanced salt with a nice finishing heat. The tenders were absolutely succulent. I would make the trip back JUST for the tenders.\\n\\nThe chicken was no less fantastic. Leg and thigh in that light coating, perfectly fried. The skin was rendered just right. It had the perfect amount of crunch and toothsomeness. The meat was piping hot and perfectly moist.\\n\\nI can easily write off the negatives to a bad day or some other mitigating circumstance.

Given our large party, we called ahead before our arrival and were able to secure a table easily. The staff was very accommodating and had broken our large table into 4 sections to help facilitate the ordering process. \\n\\nTIP: If this is your first time to Bartaco, be aware that you order by filling out a piece of paper and placing it in a holder on your table that will subsequently be picked up by your waiter. The portion sizes are small, so each person typically orders 3-5 items from the menu. The restaurant does not split checks, so coming here with a large party and with so many items being ordered could result in 1) Incorrect items coming out of the kitchen or 2) Major headaches trying to divvy up the bill. \\n\\nTHE AMBIENCE: The restaurant itself is quite lovely and has a fresh, clean feeling to it. You definitely feel like you have been transported to a hip coastal California eatery, with reclaimed wood on the walls, lanterns made from baskets, and the smell of limes wafting through the air. There is a large outdoor patio area which could be fun to check out during the summer months while sipping a cocktail. \\n\\nTHE STAFF: I cannot say enough good things about the staff. Everyone was extremely helpful and you could tell that they have set high standards to ensure a wonderful dining experience. \\n\\nTHE FOOD: They were out of at least 3 items on the menu (one being the chorizo taco which I really wanted to try). I settled for the Lunch Special, which comes with 3 tacos (they are very small) and a side item (salad or soup) for $10. I ordered 3 pork belly tacos because none of the other ones appealed to me and accompanied my tacos with the chicken soup. The pork belly tacos were delicious!! They don't skimp on the cilantro and provide a fresh lime for added flavor. The chicken soup was also very flavorful and filling, with large pieces of chicken and veggies. I was definitely full from all of this food, so next time I will probably just order two tacos and a side (maybe the grilled corn dish, which FYI, can be cut off of the cob for you). \\n\\nOne major thing that irked me was the fact that the menu lacks descriptions for its food offerings. I like to have a pretty good idea of what I am getting when I order something (i.e. what toppings come on the taco), but it was hard to do that at Bartaco. We had 2 individuals at our table with food allergies (peanut and avocado), so they had to get the lowdown from the waiters on what they could and could not eat (the staff, again, was great and definitely took the allergies seriously and wanted to provide the best they had for these patrons). \\n\\nAll in all, I liked Bartaco but wasn't blown away.

No tortilla, no beans, no rice, no chips, which they usually include in the orders.  There is one very nice employee who knows exactly what I want and rings me up for $8.03.  They've always given me a small to-go box half filled with veggies and half filled with chicken for this price.  The current manager instructed his employee to provide less than a third of the box full of veggies & 1/2 the normal serving of chicken that they've been providing.  He informed me that this really is the normal serving for what they've been charging and if I want what they've been doing for me for the last 5 years...then I'd need to pay more.  That is not the way to treat a loyal customer.  $8.03 for a few pieces of vegetables, less than half a cup of chicken, and some salsa is ridiculous.

I think it's because certain traditional standards are great and when someone comes along and tries to tweak an ingredient here or change up a preparation there, it often feels more like a bastardization rather than fusion.    \\n\\nI think the best analogy I can provide would be if one were a child of the 80s like myself that grew up with The Police's \\"Every Breath You Take\\" and then stumbling across Puff Daddy's \\"I'll be Missing You\\" a decade later.  Now if you have never heard the Police and are hearing the Puff Daddy version for the first time, your first instinct would be \\"that's a catchy ass song!\\" but if you're familiar with the original, there may be an inherent bias that something just seems a little off or that it is an unoriginal knockoff.  \\n\\nTherefore our strategy for the meal (me being Chinese and my friend being Korean) were to choose dishes that veered off course just far enough so that they wouldn't invite comparisons to old classics, and then going with some traditional standards of some non-Chinese/Korean dishes just for comparison.   Predictably, the former dishes were far superior than the latter.  I've attached a cover song along with original artist to give you an idea of how successful the dish was.\\n\\nCourse 1 Miley Cyrus \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" (Nirvana)\\nGreen papaya slaw- not much fusion here, since this is a standard appetizer in Thai restaurants; papaya was well seasoned with nice textures, downfall being that the menu lists it as a full 3 stars for spicy, and it has as much a \\"kick\\" as Miley has grunge.  \\n\\nCourse 2 Jimi Hendrix \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" (Bob Dylan)\\nGrilled razor clams with scallion-shrimp butter, grapefruit and watercress-  one of the few dishes I would actually come back here for, definitely a success since it reminds me more of an Italian preparation and the asian accents of choosing razor clams and the flavored butter was like a new revelation.\\n\\nCourse 3 Guns and Roses \\"Live and Let Die\\" (Paul McCartney)\\nWok charred octopus with grilled corn on the cob, sriacha butter-  another well-executed dish that again reminded me more of a mediterranean style dish fused with an American cookout with the grilled corn on the cob and a genius touch with Sriacha butter (may steal this idea at home) and the wok adds a nice sear to the octopus while evenly cooking the thick pieces to the perfect consistency.  \\n\\nCourse 4 Britney Spears \\"Satisfaction\\" (Rolling Stones)\\nCrispy tofu steak with chilled buckwheat noodles, cilantro, cucumber, and lemon- this dish did not work since the substitution of lemon in place of a japanese citrus like yuzu and cilantro in place of green onion made the flavors clash and seem unnatural.  The tofu was also bland and uninspired, much like this cover.\\n\\nCourse 5 Madonna's \\"American Pie\\" (Don McLean)\\nAsian braised beef rib tacos with asian pear and chili sesame salsa- conceptually this sounds promising since Korean tacos have been all the rage on the west coast food truck scene and the secret to korean short rib marinades has been pear juice as a meat tenderizer, but the texture of the pear was mushy so it did not serve its proper role and they double wrapped it like one of those taco bell concoctions but since neither layer was crunchy, it ended up just diluting the flavors and being overly \\"bready\\"  Would have been better to leave the pear in the marinade and opt for another veggie with more crunch and plate it on a single mini-tortilla like the food truck gurus.\\n\\nDessert(Bonus Track)-  David Hasselhoff's \\"Hooked on a Feeling\\" (BJ Thomas)\\nMy friend did this purely for shits (unexpected pun to follow) and giggles since the racist-sounding title for one of their Sweet Endings (I'm surprised they didn't just go all out and call them Happy Endings) was \\"ancient chinese secret\\"  chocolate mouse with 5-spice meringues....pretty much looked like dog poo with floating pieces of meringue that were difficult to break with a fork and the five-spice did nothing to enhance the unappetizing appearance of this abomination.  The ancient chinese secret is if it sounds like a hot mess, it probably is.  Would have been better if it were an alcoholic hot chocolate with 5 spice marshmallows.    \\n\\nSo there you have it, if these dishes sound completely unfamiliar to you, you might be impressed, but if you are familiar with some old standards, go with the ones that sound the least familiar (we were still pondering if we should have gone for the Asian chicken and waffles).  With a final price tally of 40 bucks/person without even partaking in alcohol, a bit steep for what you get and one must therefore exercise caution with their \\"playlist\\" selection."},{"name":"360 Pizza","address":"6203 N Capital Of Texas Hwy, Ste A100","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The pizza at 360 pizza is fantastic.

We got the white clam pizza, the shrimp scampi, and the salmon poke. The salmon poke was very underwhelming in flavor and I expected more actual fish. The shrimp scampi was watery and again I expected more than 3 pieces of shrimp. The white clam pizza was probably the best entree but it was pretty standard.\\n\\nI liked the atmosphere and service.

Food first.  The food was very good.  Creamed corn was  very delicious probably because of the cream and sugar, the cole slaw was fresh and crispy, the ranch beans ok, and the green beans were excellently cooked al diente yet needed a little warmth - might have been because all is found on a food buffet.  The brisket was the most tender brisket I've had and the sausage was fine.  Yet personally I think they spray too much water on the brisket because if you do it starts to fall apart and looks or acts more like a roast. \\n\\nIt was already after 8:00pm so they didn't have much else.  The portion of meat was very small.  Gee, one piece of brisket with one sausage was $15 or so.  While I really like the building look with all wood, I'm not a fan of food buffets.  That is, when you get there you first serve your own sides and then go get the meat.  The meat also didn't come fresh out of the smoker.  It had been on that wood block for some time - so I can relate when someone said it wasn't very hot.  The staff didn't look very busy but no one really comes around and asks how you're doing or directs you.  Also, I had never been there so when we got there it was a little confusing how to start.

I am not a fan of pure white so I think the place is a bit bright, but then again I do not know anything about decorating.\\n\\nThe menu. To me it is pretty ridiculous to charge upwards of $8-$9 for a burger and have it come with no sides. Luckily, as I like it plain, they had one for $6.50 which is not terrible, but when you have a pretty small burger like they do, you need to include a side. The burger itself was decent, I was glad the chef knew the definition of medium rare which so many around here do not for burgers. The bun was awesome though. I really like good bread.\\n\\nI usually do not eat much for lunch these days so it was a good amount for that, but if I had come here for dinner I would have not been filled up with one burger, and charging $3.50 for fries is a bit excessive.

It doesn't seem to matter what time of day I stop by, the service is always painfully slow! There never seem to be more than 3-4 people working at any one time despite how busy this location is. More frustrating is that at least one of them always seems to be standing around doing nothing, while another is asking, in front of a long line of customers, if they can go for their break!! Seriously I've heard someone ask this at least 3 times. If you really have to take your break right now, how about you do it discretely?! I've worked in many retail and service industry jobs and cannot imagine ever doing this! When I come here in the morning I have to allow a good 20-25mins to grab a cup of coffee - it's ridiculous!! This is not the case at the slightly less conveniently located (for me) store in Brookline, where service is always fast and friendly! Then there's the sloppy drink making, and the fact that no one who works there seems to know the names of any of the drinks they sell!! And I'm not talking about some complicated double pump, extra hot, no foam, triple shot, non-fat, soy milk kind of drink, I'm talking about the standard drinks printed right on the boards behind them! Today was the last straw that prompted this review - store is packed, massive line, only 3 people working there (although a fourth does appear from the back room as I'm leaving only to stand by the little oven with a vacant stare doing nothing), they run out of cups, someone asks to go on their break, the person who finally serves me needs me to explain the drink I want to him 3 times (again a standard drink on the board behind him), there are no little hot cup holder guys, I say excuse me 3 times to try to get one, am ignored, so after a 20min+ ordeal I get scald my hand all the way home.

They've come up with this strange hybrid of counter service and wait service that doesn't make a lot of sense, and doesn't solve seem to solve any actual problems with traditional service.  You get in line, and when you've made it to the bar, you can order a drink.  But then you have to close out and pay.  Then you keep waiting in line.  If there are no tables available you just keep waiting in line until one becomes available and then a staffer will bring you a table number.  You can't order food at the counter until you have a table number. Fine i get that, but how is this better than just having a wait list?  Once you get to the food counter,  you order and pay again.  Then you get seated and your food comes, and suddenly you magically have wait staff. If you want to get a second drink or a dessert or more queso (yes please!) you can order from the wait staff, and then pay out a third time.  Last time we were in there, we waited right at the counter for a long time for a table to open up.  While we were waiting a staffer with in iPad came around and asked us for our order to 'speed things up' once a table was available.

Prior to last night, my meals here had left me longing for the many hidden gems in the dark street corners of Manhattan. \\n\\nBut all kinds of people have raved about the Clay Pit (and even the take out version, Tarka) that my boyfriend and I decided to spend our Valentine's Day dinner date there. With \\"an hour wait\\" according to the hostess upon entry, many guests turned away deciding to spark their romance elsewhere. Thankfully, we held tight, temporarily grabbed a table at the bar and dove into one of the best culinary experiences of our lives. \\n\\n1) Infused Martini: Having worked in food service for years, I'm all for asking the experts what they suggest particularly when I first visit a restaurant. Our bartender said it was dependent on my taste. He gave me a list of options, sweet, spicy- I stopped him right there. Definitely a mix of the two. And without hesitation he said, \\"Oh the infused martini! Ginger, mango, peppers.\\" Three of my favorite things! One sip and I was in ecstasy. \\n\\nNot even halfway through our drink, our table was ready. Yay!\\n\\n2) Tandoori Bites: I usually go with samosas to start but after the success of the unexpected cocktail I was ready to try all kinds of new things and boy was I glad I did. The consistency of the chicken was marvelous, juicy, tender, not even the slightest bit over or undercooked. The seasoning on the bird alone was impeccable and then the sauce to dip it in, a classic tikka masala has never tasted so complex. Usually I get excited when a lemon is provided for extra flavor but neither of us wanted to throw off the beautiful balance that was already happening in the appetizer with a citrus spray.\\n\\nI get the waiter's name, Brad. I ask him what he suggests for a main course. He turns it back on us much like the bartender so as to better respond. Do we prefer beef, lamb, goat, chicken, vegetables, etc? My babe was lamb all the way. As for me, usually I'd go veggie in my Indian indulgences but seeing how we've faired so far with the poultry I took a leap. \\n\\n3) Garlic Whole Wheat Naan: A no brainer in our minds. This was thinner than we'd experienced elsewhere and we weren't sure how we felt about that but the flavors were amazing and our waiter even \\"worked his magic\\" so that we could combine the whole wheat naan with the garlic. This is why Brad's the man. \\n\\n4) Lamb Roganjosh: \\"Tender morsels of lamb cooked in true Kashmiri style creamy onion sauce with a unique blend of spices.\\" My boyfriend liked it but honestly I didn't even try it because I was too busy enjoying this:\\n\\n5) Khuroos-E-Tursh: \\"Medallions of chicken-breast stuffed with seasoned spinach, mushrooms, onions & cheese, simmered in a rich cashew-almond cream sauce.\\" This was another house special, the first one on the list, and there is no question as to why. My mind shut down. My body tuned in. I was talking like the impassioned food critics on TV, dissecting every flavor factor. The consistency, the combination of saag paneer and korma curry, two of my usual go-to dishes all rolled into one orgasmically wonderful experience. Hands down, the best Indian food my boyfriend and I have ever tasted. \\n\\nWe sent compliments to the chef. Double tipped our waiter and already planned our next Clay Pit meal - birthday dinner!"},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Unique flavors and not overly sweet!!!!

It was a small cafe style dining nook at the airport and the display menu looked appetizing. There was a \\"seat yourself \\" sign in front, so I went in and sat at a small table and I waited for a server to come by. And I waited and I waited and 3 servers walked past my table without a word to me. About 15 minutes later, a group of noisy young people came in and began pushing tables together for themselves. I was appalled that as soon as the group of teenagers sat down, the male server started handing out menus to them! I was angry for being ignored for over 15 minutes and got up in disgust and left. I cannot honestly rate the food since I never got waited on, but the service is HORRIBLE if you are dining alone! I hope that the group of teenagers all ordered water to drink and an appetizer for them to share!

We wanted to take advantage of the happy hour specials (FYI - no specials on wine by the glass, just by the bottle) on drinks and appetizers. We ordered: bread and olive oil (you have to request it), a bacon pizza, calamari, bruschetta, the brussel sprouts side, meatballs, and polenta fries. The meatballs and the polenta fries were the best if not small in portion. The bread took way too long to come out. They fresh slice it but I watched the bread sit on the cutting board while our waiter passed by it at least 6 times. The pizza was tasty - nothing special though but for the $2 off at happy hour I'd say it's a pretty good deal. The calamari was bland. \\n\\nThe brussel sprouts took a really long time to come out (we ordered the pizza about 10 minutes after the sprouts and the pizza came out first - I'm convinced our waiter forgot to put in the order). Now, I love brussel sprouts and was very excited for this but was sorely disappointed. The balsamic vinegar tasted unlike balsamic. It tasted briney. I think this dish would benefit from maybe roasting the sprouts then drizzling the balsamic over them - cause something was just not right.\\n\\nI did hear another table complain about how they were already out of one item and it was the first night.

Myers & Chang was first introduced to me... or rather I became aware of it when I was watching Top Chef. There was mention of the restaurant in brief by the executive chef who was on the show. Then over time my foodie friends started talking about the restaurant over and over again and let's be frank, I didn't want to be left out. After 2 weeks of waiting (since that was the earliest I could book a relatively dinner appropriate time to eat there on Open Table, I finally got my chance!\\n\\nOpened by Joanne Chang and Karen Akunowicz (featured in Top Chef) this fantastic restaurant is actually situated just a few blocks from the Tufts Medical Center. It's relatively unassuming exterior contrasts their modern interior and beautifully plated dishes. They are what I would describe as a southeast/East Asian fusion restaurant with a modern twist combining all the flavors that myself as a Chinese person am familiar while introducing new flavors by combining dishes I didn't know would go together. You must start off your meal with the homemade sodas! Once you have ordered that, you can continue reading...\\n\\nI thoroughly researched the Yelp reviews on here and methodically went through the pictures to see the \\"popular\\" items on the menu. It did take a while for them to seat us which irked me a little at first but as soon as we sat down, service was quick. We were first given a \\"on the house\\" untraditional onion pancake which was beautiful. I could eat that all day. Well done, chef and staff. We had the tea-smoked pork spare ribs that were tender beyond belief and the cold Taiwanese Dan Dan Noodles that maybe I was not particularly keen on sharing that night (don't tell the BF because we did end up sharing... I do learn things in school). I think one of the highlights for the evening was the whole fish. This was a whole fish that was fried but preserving the inner juice of the fish such that when you cut it open you could tell you were going to have a delicious dinner. I know some of you are going to squeamish but get over yourself because you'd be missing out on one of the best dishes in the restaurant if you did not order this. Already thinking at this point that we had ordered too much, I still didn't feel quite complete so we tagged on the surf and turf black pepper noodles. Unfortunately this dish is what lost the restaurant a star from my point of view. Although it had all the right elements, the one thing that made it unbalanced was the acidity. Not sure if it was a heavy hand in adding lemon juice but that's all we could taste.\\n\\nDessert --- Guys --- OH THE DESSERT. Nothing Asian about the desserts but clearly whoever is in charge of this has really nailed it (I suspect Joanne's Flour bakery?). We shared the coconut cream pie (small personal sized pie) and the affogato. The coconut cream pie was fluffy and rich and not too over the top with the coconut flakes which can turn me off. But man, the Affogato which is a coffee/chocolate flavored treat that has various textures combined inside is by far my favorite. I wish I could just have multiple cups of that and I could call it a night. There is chocolate cake in there with an espresso ice cream, crunchy caramelized espresso on top.

Here's the skinny: Great environment, wonderful food, okay service. The details: We came by at 830pm on a Saturday night and the place wasn't too crowded. We were seated at a comfortable booth and immediately ordered cocktails. Great Margarita Classicos--lots of fresh lime flavor, light and distinctive, and strong. Then we ordered ceviche, guacamole, and I ordered the mole. It was all delicious. Part of what I loved about the food is that the restaurant's ethic appears to be to let as much of the food's inherent flavors shine through as possible--nothing was overseasoned or oversauced, and it was all light, fragrant, and delicious. It took a little getting used to eating a meal that wasn't overpoweringly flavored, but man once I really dug in and took the cuisine on its own terms I really enjoyed basking in the inherent flavors of my fish and mole veggies--and I'm so glad I broke the vegetarian diet and ordered the fish because it was really quite tender, fresh and delicious.\\n\\nEven better: the menu has a good number of vegan and vegetarian options, AND the entire kitchen is gluten-free.\\n\\nNow, here's where I want to give Verde Cocina four-and-a-half stars instead of five. Our waiter was kind of contemptous of us. He was polite enough, but he definitely made a few disparaging, condescending remarks about our party's questions and choices that we really could've done without. He slightly spoiled what was otherwise a really positive and enjoyable evening.\\n\\nThere were four of us. Three of us ordered two cocktails a piece, we each ordered entrees, and we split the ceviche and guac. The bill came to $135 plus tip.

It was super nommy!"},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Oh my goodness this was the best burger ever. My friend and I split the shroom burger and the primetime.  I preferred the Primetime.  Who knew Brie and burgers went so well together?  We also split the baby kale salad.  It had so many flavors going on, I was overwhelmed with joy.  Also, they carry Lawnmower beer which, when mixed with a frozen margarita, gives a lovely buzz to enjoy while standing in line...."},{"name":"Gusto Italian Kitchen & Wine Bar","address":"4800 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The first time I went to Gusto a couple weeks ago I couldn't complain about anything, however, when I returned bringing my family to this new restaurant I thought was so good, I was very disappointed. We walked in and were told the wait was an hour, which was not great, but we were willing to wait so the hostess was kind of in shock that we wanted our name on this list so we move to the bar to wait and have some drinks. So we wait and wait and the hostess's don't ever come update us and when we question where we are on the list they are not polite. They seated many people ahead of us and then when we finally see a table open we think will be ours they take a good 10 minutes after the table was cleaned to seat a different party. After over an  hour a table opens up and the hostess acted like she didn't want us to have it and walks around the whole bar when we are standing and waiting right there. So we are seated, I am brought a glass of water with someone else's lipstick on it. No one acknowledges our table until 15 minutes later after we had already waited an hour to sit down. The waitress finally comes up and she says she will be \\"right with us\\" then proceeds to fill up some other tables drinks when we don't even have drinks yet. The food was good, but for the wait and poor service it wasn't worth my time."},{"name":"White Coconut Thai Restaurant","address":"211 Middlesex Tpke","city":"Burlington","stars":"4","text":"I went here for the first time since it was the Lemon Tree. I have to say, the food is fantastic. Probably the best Thai food that I've ever had, if I'm being completely honest. The pineapple fried rice was the highlight of the day for me - just the right amount of curry spice for flavor!\\n\\nThe service needs a bit of polishing, though, which is why only 3 stars. We weren't offered anything other than water to drink, and I think at one point the kitchen lost track of tickets, because staff were going to each table with food asking if they ordered it. \\n\\nDespite that, I would probably come back. Judging from prior reviews, I would guess that today was an off day. And, like I said, the food was wonderful."},{"name":"Kyma","address":"3085 Piedmont Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Excellent service. Excellent food. The dinner for two was amazing. We got to try 4 different starters followed by a whole fish (Lavraki). The octopus and the calamari were as fresh and as well prepared as in Italy and the wine list really highlighted the best that Greece has to offer. It is expensive but you do pay for the high quality food, ambiance, and service. \\n\\nMy only complaint was the Lavraki. It is normally such a flavorful fish but that night came out bland. I don't know if it was the amazing starters the superseded it with their individual amazing flavors or that it just wasn't up to par? Either way I highly recommend this place. \\n\\n*My inside tip... if you call ahead you can have your Lavraki salt baked which is the best preparation of the fish and will change your life."},{"name":"Tavern in the Square","address":"1815 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"This place has the best mac & cheese I've had in a long time. SO good. Their nacho style fries were also fantastic. I even had plenty of mac & cheese left over to take home for an entire other meal. My husband also loved his burger and sweet potato fries. I don't know about everything else, but everything we had was awesome!"},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Went to Hopdoddy on consecutive days during my visit to Austin. The happy hour special is great, get those truffle fries and green chile queso! I can't say enough about them - the fries were all crisp and delicious on their own, and then throw in that queso and I'm in heaven. The cocktails were very tasty as well, and we had very helpful and attentive service - yes it was the middle of the afternoon on a weekday, I can't speak to how it is when the place is super crowded as it clearly is often."},{"name":"Desta Ethiopian Kitchen","address":"3086 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This restaurant is a popular spot I had never been to. I met up with some friends here and had a great time. I had no idea what to get as I had never tried Ethiopian cuisine but fortunately their menu has a list of definitions to words that people may not know. \\n\\nI ordered the fish tibs with a side of potato and beets salad and miser (delicious lentils). I do wish that they included two sides with the tibs because the sides are small but you only get one side free. I ordered an Ethiopian beer called Meta which is the lightest one they have and I really enjoyed it. The fish was seasoned and cooked perfectly. I ate everything with my hands specially because the tibs comes with a choice of breads. The sides were amazing specially the beets & potato salad. I ordered the whoIe wheat bread and dipped it in the lentils. I highly recommend that you try the injera bread because it is very unique both in flavor and texture. In English I would call it a sour pancake. I will definitely be returning to try other dishes on the menu."},{"name":"Fuji 1546 Restaurant and Bar","address":"1546 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"Came back for a real meal last night and WOW!! the Salmon Wonton Chips  are to die for, and I am kind of obsessed with them. If the Fuji in Wollaston added them to the menu, I would probably go there every day for an order. We stuck with sushi for dinner, it was exactly the quality I have come to expect from this company: delicious, fast and filling. Their drink menu is still basically a variety of martini's, but I did see a table-tent with other drinks on my table, so maybe I missed it last time because I was at the bar.\\n\\nOur server was great--very quick to clear empty plates, and was very hands-off when, after we finished eating, we didn't order dessert while finishing our scorpion bowl, which took a while. \\n\\nAs I mentioned in my first post, the prices are higher than I would like, which is a deterrent from going too often, even if parking was better. But I do have a huge complaint--the bathroom was COLD. Downright freezing. It was as if there was a direct line from the refrigerators to the ladies' room because the vents (which are directly above the toilets) were blowing cold air--I was chilled to my core by the time I returned to my table. Maybe it was just a SNAFU, and I did note it on the comment card, so hopefully it will be fixed next time."},{"name":"Burnside Brewing","address":"701 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This used be a favorite place. Something happened over the last few months. Management change? I am trying to figure it out. Nutshell - while the beer is still excellent, every other facet from service to menu options to ambiance has gone to pot. Serious bummer. You can see the defeat written all over the place. The death knell for me was the shrimp with poop vein still in it.

Fresh Sushi, cheap drinks, and amazing hand pulled noodles. I can't remember our waitress's name but she was fantastic. She was very helpful and explained the menu as well as what were the best picks! We found out on Sunday they do happy hour all day and they do reverse happy hour every day from 7-10 We ended up getting the Lobster dumplings, a spicy yellow tail roll, a California roll, a big bowl of noodles that the waitress so graciously prepped for us to share (with scissors because it was one long noodle) and we each had two drinks all for a grand total of about 40 bucks. An absolute STEAL.\\n\\nWe will most definitely be back."},{"name":"Cappy‚Äôs Pizza & Subs","address":"82 Westland Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"New resident in the Fenway area so I've been making my rounds to all the pizza shops but I was disappointed with my visit here.

We were recommended the $25 platter that had the most variety. I can't recall the name of the dish but it came with Injera which is basically African spongey flatbread with a little sour hint to it. Dishes included veggies, lamb, beef, chicken and spicy flavor which I LOVE. Although it was a little pricey for this platter, my buddy and I couldn't even finish half of it (sponge bread so filling X_X) so had about 2 leftover meals for both of us so I would say it was well worth the money spent.\\n\\nThe service was also exceptional. The waitress we had was actually the daughter of the parents that they named the place after. \\n\\nConclusion: All in all it was a great experience, great service, awesome food, and will definitely be going there again soon!"}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},j={class:"search-container"},N={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],R={key:0},D={key:1};function G(n,e,s,f,i,r){const u=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",j,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",N,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(u,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",D,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",R,"See more"))],8,O)):w("",!0)])}const F=c(H,[["render",G],["__scopeId","data-v-c09c9e8d"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/25.md","filePath":"drive/25.md"}'),L={name:"drive/25.md"},Y=Object.assign(L,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(F)]))}});export{V as __pageData,Y as default};
